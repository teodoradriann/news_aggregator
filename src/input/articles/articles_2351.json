    "title": "Win over India massive for us; South Africa have really gelled as a unit, says Shukri Conrad",
    "text": "Centurion, Dec 29 : Following a win by an innings and 32 runs over India in the first Test at SuperSport Park, South Africa head coach Shukri Conrad thinks the victory was a massive one for his side and believes the hosts' are starting to gel well as a unit at home. South Africa's win was set up by opener Dean Elgar, who will retire after the two-Test series, scoring a majestic 185, followed by Marco Jansen making a career-best 84 not out and debutant David Bedingham making 56. The trio's efforts meant South Africa made 408 in their first innings and took a 163-run lead on day three. Led by left-arm pacer Nandre Burger's 4-33, taking his match haul to seven scalps, South Africa skittled out India for just 131 in 34.1 overs, to complete a resounding win in three days. \"This win was massive for us and what makes it bigger is that it makes sure India have never beaten us in a Test series here. We know what a quality side India are, but we also know what we are, especially at home. We are a brilliant team at home and we have really gelled as a unit.\" \"A lot of the time that has been about freeing the guys up, allowing them to be the best versions of themselves. People have questioned whether South Africa still produce good players and we have shown that we do. Sometimes we are too humble as a group.\" \"We are so easy to talk up other players and we don't give our own players the credit. Nandre (Burger) is massive and (David) Bedingham too ... its time we start drooling over our players. These guys are absolutely phenomenal and we have put succession plans in place. You need a bit of luck and things will fall into place,\" said Conrad after the match ended. Elgar's 185, on his final Test match at his home ground, allowed South Africa to not just survive in hostile batting conditions, but also feast later on an Indian bowling line-up which did well only in patches. \"Maybe the retirement decision had everything to do with the way he played. I thought Dean was phenomenal. I haven't seen Dean play any better. If you look at Dean's record, he is second to Graeme (Smith) in terms of opening batters (in South Africa) and that's something to be really proud of. \"That's something we want to start highlighting: obviously the team comes first but we also want to talk about individual performances that put us up in lights. With Marco we know his ability and we've seen him do things before. It's with the ball that he has been a bit off the mark,\" added Conrad. With a 1-0 lead in the two-game series, the second Test at Cape Town starting from January 3 presents the opportunity for South Africa to seal the series in what will also be Elgar's last international game. \"Everybody is looking forward to the New Year's Test. There hasn't been one in a while where crowds were allowed in, and if rumours are to be believed, I think the first few days are pretty much sold out. \"I think the guys will really be up for it, there is a series to be won. Series wins are special, especially series wins against India, and then we can send Dean off properly – that would put the cherry on top for us,\" concluded Conrad.",

    "text": "The Amazing World of Invertebrates: Exploring the Tiny Creatures That Rule the Earth When we think of animals, we often picture majestic lions, playful dolphins, or soaring eagles. But the animal kingdom is far more diverse than these charismatic creatures. In fact, the majority of animal species on Earth belong to a group often overlooked: invertebrates. These creatures, lacking a backbone, are the unsung heroes of our planet, playing crucial roles in ecosystems and contributing to the intricate web of life. What are Invertebrates? Invertebrates are animals without a backbone, or vertebral column. This seemingly simple distinction sets them apart from vertebrates, which include mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. While vertebrates may grab the headlines, invertebrates make up a staggering 95% of all animal species. This vast group encompasses a mind-boggling array of creatures, from tiny insects to massive squid, showcasing a remarkable diversity of forms, behaviors, and adaptations. The Incredible Variety of Invertebrates The world of invertebrates is a kaleidoscope of colors, shapes, and sizes. Here’s a glimpse into some of the major groups: - Insects: The most diverse group of animals on Earth, boasting over a million known species. From the buzzing bees to the colorful butterflies, insects play vital roles in pollination, decomposition, and food chains. - Mollusks: This group includes snails, slugs, clams, oysters, and octopuses. Mollusks are known for their soft bodies, often protected by a hard shell. They are important food sources and contribute to marine ecosystems. - Arthropods: This diverse group includes insects, spiders, crabs, and lobsters. Arthropods are characterized by their jointed legs and exoskeletons, which provide support and protection. - Worms: From the earthworms that enrich our soil to the parasitic roundworms, worms come in many forms. They play crucial roles in decomposition, nutrient cycling, and food chains. - Echinoderms: This group includes starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. They are characterized by their radial symmetry and spiny skin. Echinoderms are important members of marine ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling and providing food for other animals. The Importance of Invertebrates Invertebrates may be small, but their impact on our planet is enormous. They contribute to: - Pollination: Insects like bees and butterflies are essential for the pollination of many plants, ensuring the production of fruits, vegetables, and seeds. - Food Chains: Invertebrates form the base of many food chains, serving as a vital food source for birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. - Decomposition: Invertebrates like earthworms and dung beetles play a crucial role in breaking down dead organic matter, returning nutrients to the soil. - Ecosystem Health: Invertebrates help maintain the balance of ecosystems by regulating populations of other organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling. - Human Health: Some invertebrates, like honeybees, provide us with essential products like honey and beeswax. Others, like earthworms, improve soil fertility, benefiting agriculture and food production. Threats to Invertebrates Despite their importance, many invertebrate populations are facing threats from human activities, including: - Habitat Loss: As humans expand their footprint, natural habitats are destroyed, reducing the space available for invertebrates. - Pollution: Chemical pollutants, pesticides, and fertilizers can harm invertebrates and disrupt ecosystems. - Climate Change: Rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events can negatively impact invertebrate populations. - Invasive Species: Introduced species can outcompete native invertebrates and disrupt ecosystems. Protecting Invertebrates Protecting invertebrates is essential for maintaining the health of our planet and ensuring the well-being of future generations. We can all contribute by: - Reducing our use of pesticides and fertilizers: Choose organic options whenever possible and minimize chemical use in our gardens and lawns. - Conserving natural habitats: Support organizations that protect habitats for invertebrates and create wildlife-friendly gardens. - Educating ourselves and others: Learn about the importance of invertebrates and share this knowledge with others. - Making sustainable choices: Reduce our consumption and waste, support sustainable agriculture, and advocate for policies that protect the environment. The world of invertebrates is a fascinating and vital part of our planet. By understanding their importance and taking action to protect them, we can ensure a healthy and thriving future for all.",

    "text": "El actor venezolano Édgar Ramírez no pudo ocultar su entusiasmo al enterarse de que la película «Emilia Pérez», en la que participa, ha recibido un impresionante total de 13 nominaciones a la 97º edición de los premios Oscar , prevista el 3 de marzo en el teatro Dolby de Los Ángeles.\nEn un video publicado en su cuenta de Instagram, se puede ver a Édgar Ramírez, quien se encuentra actualmente en Milán, Italia, saltando de alegría al conocer la noticia de las nominaciones de la película en la que interpretó al personaje Gustavo Brun.\n“13 nominaciones al Oscar para nuestra querida Emilia Pérez. ¡Esto es increíble! Muchas gracias, Academia. ¡Qué día tan feliz!”, escribió Ramírez en Instagram.\n“Emilia Pérez” , una película francesa en español de Jacques Audiard, dominó las nominaciones con 13 nominaciones, incluidas mejor película y mejor actriz para Karla Sofía Gascón. La película también recibió nominaciones a mejor dirección, guion original, dos de sus canciones y para Zoe Saldaña.\nNominaciones a Mejor Película Otro musical, “ Wicked ”, la exitosa adaptación de Broadway, recibió casi la misma cantidad de nominaciones. La suntuosa versión de “El mago de Oz” de Jon M. Chu obtuvo 10 nominaciones, incluidas las de mejor película y mejor interpretación para sus protagonistas, Cynthia Erivo y Ariana Grande.\n“The Brutalist” , la epopeya de posguerra de Brady Corbet también obtuvo 10 nominaciones, incluidas mejor película, mejor director y nominaciones a la actuación para Adrien Brody, Guy Pearce y Felicity Jones.\nLas 10 nominadas a mejor película son: “ Anora ”; “The Brutalist”; “A Complete Unknown”; “Conclave”; “ Dune: Part Two ”; “Emilia Pérez”; “I’m Still Here”; “Nickel Boys”; “ The Substance ” y “Wicked”.\nOtras nominaciones en los Oscar Las mayores sorpresas fueron la película brasileña “ I’m Still Here ”, un retrato de la resistencia política bajo la dictadura militar de Brasil que también le valió a Fernanda Torres una nominación a mejor actriz, y “ Nickel Boys ” de RaMell Ross, un drama en primera persona audazmente elaborado que reconsidera cómo se representa la vida y el dolor de los negros en la pantalla.\nUna de las películas más audaces de 2024, “ The Apprentice ” obtuvo un par de nominaciones sorprendentes, para Sebastian Stan y Jeremy Strong. La película dramatiza los años de formación del\npresidente Donald Trump (Stan) en el sector inmobiliario de Nueva York bajo la tutela del abogado Roy Cohn (Strong).\n“A nivel artístico, hoy es un día increíble para mí y me siento muy feliz”, añadió Strong sobre su primera nominación al Oscar. “Tengo sentimientos encontrados sobre el personaje que interpreté. Fue el papel de mi vida y, al mismo tiempo, su legado es real y se está desarrollando in situ, ante nuestros ojos, de maneras muy aterradoras”.\nMejor actor y actriz En la categoría de mejor actor, donde estaban nominados Stan y Brody, los otros nominados fueron Timothée Chalamet (“A Complete Unknown”), Colman Domingo (“Sing Sing”) y Ralph Fiennes (“Conclave”). El que más se quedó fuera fue Daniel Craig, aclamado por su actuación nada al estilo de James Bond en “Queer”.\nEn la categoría de mejor actriz , que Demi Moore parece tener asegurada por su actuación en “ The Substance ”, Moore, Gascón, Torres, Erivo y la estrella de “Anora”, Mikey Madison, recibieron nominaciones. Posiblemente la categoría más competitiva del año, que dejó fuera a Marianne Jean-Baptiste (“Hard Truths”), Pamela Anderson (“The Last Showgirl”), Nicole Kidman (“ Babygirl ”) y Angelina Jolie (“Maria”).\nAnte la situación tan grave que afecta a la industria cinematográfica, algunos pidieron a la Academia que cancelara los Oscar por completo . Los líderes de la Academia han argumentado que la ceremonia del 2 de marzo debe seguir adelante, por su impacto económico en Los Ángeles y como símbolo de resiliencia.\nLos organizadores han prometido que los premios de este año «celebrarán el trabajo que nos une como comunidad cinematográfica global y reconocerán a quienes lucharon con tanta valentía contra los incendios forestales».",

    "text": "Conditions were mostly nice this year for travelers flying ahead of and on Christmas, but some naughty disruptions again plagued those flying with Southwest Airlines. For millions of people traveling over the holiday, this year was much better than last. Christmas morning put a bow on a relatively smooth weekend. Only 157 flights within, into or out of the U.S. had been canceled and 2,111 were delayed as of late afternoon on Monday, according to the tracking website FlightAware. For this holiday season, U.S. airlines prepared for massive waves of travelers by hiring thousands of pilots, flight attendants and other workers — in an effort to avoid the delays and cancellations that marred travel in 2022, culminating with the Southwest Airlines debacle that stranded more than 2 million people. People are also reading… Still, Southwest experienced hiccups again over the weekend that the airline was looking to clear by Monday. Check out how airline performance has been recently at Midway and O'Hare airports.",

    "title": "Pakistani Christian Community Attacked after Blasphemy Accusation | Newsmax.com",
    "text": "Reuters Saturday, 25 May 2024 03:53 PM EDT At least 10 members of a minority Christian community were rescued on Saturday after a Muslim crowd attacked their settlement on blasphemy accusation in eastern Pakistan, police and a community leader said. The crowd, which accused the Christian group of blasphemy, also hurled stones and bricks at the police, said Shariq Kamal, the police chief of Sargodha district. At least one house and a small shoe factory was set on fire by protesters who had gathered after neighbors alleged that the Muslim holy book, the Koran, had been desecrated by a minority community member, according to a police spokesman and Akmal Bhatti, a Christian leader. \"They burned one house\" and several Christians were badly beaten, Bhatti said. A large contingent of police cordoned off the settlement, Kamal said, adding that the crowd had been pushed back. One member of the Christian community who was taken to hospital was later said to be in a stable condition. The situation had calmed down by late evening, with leaders from both sides calling for peace, police said. A Christian rights group - Minority Rights March - said a 70-year-old man accused of the blasphemy was beaten and dragged by the mob. It said video footage showed that the police did not intervene. The police have denied the claim. Videos posted on social media showed protesters looting items from burning properties. Others were seen throwing the items in a heap on fire in a street. Bhatti said the videos were images from the scene. Reuters could not independently verify the pictures. The independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said the Christian community was \"at grave risk to their lives at the hands of the charged mobs.\" Blasphemy is a sensitive subject in conservative Muslim- majority Pakistan, where just an accusation can lead to a street lynching. Human rights groups say Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores. While blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan, no one has been executed by the state for it, though numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs. A Muslim crowd attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan last year, vandalizing several churches and setting scores of houses on fire after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Koran. © 2024 Thomson/Reuters.

    "title": "USA und China: Ansehen beschädigt - und der Tourismus leidet",
    "text": "USA und China: Ansehen beschädigt - und der Tourismus leidet\nUS-Präsident Trump wird seinem Land Experten zufolge einen Rückgang der Touristenzahlen einbringen. Bisher allerdings muss Großmacht-Rivale China im Reiseverkehr größere Einbußen hinnehmen.\nMünchen/Peking - Im globalen Reiseverkehr haben Krisen und Konflikte der vergangenen Jahre China bislang mehr geschadet als den USA. Die beiden großen deutschen Flughäfen Frankfurt und München melden auch nach dem Amtsantritt von US-Präsident Donald Trump in diesem Jahr bisher einen Anstieg der Passagierzahlen auf den US-Routen, im China-Verkehr hingegen einen Rückgang. Und im direkten Vergleich der jeweiligen weltweiten Besucherzahlen haben die Vereinigten Staaten China seit 2019 überholt.\nFachwelt erwartet Trump-Krise im US-Tourismus\nDer Münchner Flughafen zählte von Januar bis Mai knapp 1,2 Millionen Passagiere im Flugverkehr mit den USA – fast 37.000 mehr als ein Jahr zuvor. Auch in Frankfurt legten die Fluggastzahlen in den ersten vier Monaten – noch ohne Mai – um 7.600 auf 944.300 zu. Das deutet bisher nicht auf einen riesigen Trump-Effekt. Allerdings ist diesen Daten nicht zu entnehmen, ob die Flieger mehrheitlich mit US-Bürgern oder Europäern besetzt waren. Die Zahlen beinhalten sowohl abfliegende als auch ankommende Passagiere.\nDass Trumps zweite Amtszeit dem US-Tourismus schaden wird, ist Konsens in der Fachwelt: Nach Schätzung des in London ansässigen Welttourismusverband WTTC und des Beratungsinstituts Oxford Economics kommen auf die USA in diesem Jahr Einnahmeverluste von über zwölf Milliarden Dollar zu, weil Ausländer fernbleiben. Der „Spiegel“ widmete der Trump-bedingten Reisekrise die Titelgeschichte seiner jüngsten Ausgabe.\nChina-Tourismus: Pandemie wirkt nach, Ukraine-Krieg schadet\nAuf den China-Flugrouten von und nach München und Frankfurt sind die Passagierzahlen in diesem Jahr bereits geschrumpft: um 1.300 auf knapp 203.000 Passagiere während der ersten fünf Monate in München. In den ersten vier Monaten in Frankfurt waren es 180.300 Fluggäste, die nach China flogen oder von dort ankamen, 27.000 weniger als ein Jahr zuvor. Ein quasi identisches Bild zeigt sich auch beim längerfristigen Vergleich der Jahre 2019 und 2024: Gesunkene Passagierzahlen nach und aus China, im Saldo höhere im US-Flugverkehr.\nWoran liegt das? „Die Erreichbarkeit Chinas hat sich erheblich verändert“, sagt Dennis Utzerath, Tourismusfachmann bei der internationalen Unternehmensberatung BCG in Köln. In der Corona-Pandemie wurde das Flugangebot sehr stark zusammengestrichen.\nUnd wegen des Ukraine-Kriegs umfliegen europäische Fluggesellschaften seit 2022 den russischen Luftraum auf teuren Umwegen, chinesische nicht. „Für europäische Fluggesellschaften ist es dadurch erheblich schwieriger geworden, gegen chinesische Airlines wettbewerbsfähig zu sein“, sagt Utzerath. Mehrere europäische Fluggesellschaften – darunter die Lufthansa und British Airways – setzten Verbindungen nach China aus.\nReiseveranstalter sehen wieder steigendes Interesse an China\n„Die immer noch schwachen Fluggastzahlen aus Deutschland Richtung China lassen erstaunlicherweise keinen Rückschluss auf die tatsächliche touristische Nachfrage für China zu“, sagt Holger Baldus, Sicherheitsmanager beim Münchner Reiseanbieter Studiosus. Hintergrund der Fluggastzahlen seien die Streckeneinstellungen europäischer Carrier Richtung China. Der Reiseanbieter sieht sogar ein erstaunliches Wiedererstarken des China-Tourismus aus Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz, nach Worten des Managers „derzeit von der knappen Verfügbarkeit an Flugsitzen noch gezügelt“.\nAuch der größte deutsche Reiseveranstalter Tui berichtet, dass das Interesse an China wachse – „aber natürlich von einer recht übersichtlichen Ausgangsbasis“, wie ein Sprecher des Unternehmens sagt.\nChinas Ansehen in der westlichen Welt leidet schon länger\nOffenkundig ist jedoch, dass China seit der Corona-Pandemie international an Attraktivität verloren hat. Reisten 2019 nach offiziellen Zahlen noch knapp 96,6 Millionen Ausländer in die Volksrepublik, waren es 2024 nur noch rund 64,9 Millionen – ein Rückgang von etwa ein Drittel. Der Reiseverkehr in die USA hat sich nach dem Ende der Pandemie deutlich schneller erholt: 2019 zählten die Vereinigten Staaten 79,3 Millionen Besucher, weniger als die Volksrepublik. Im vergangenen Jahr waren es 72,3 Millionen – mehr als in China.\nChinas Ansehen in der westlichen Welt leidet schon erheblich länger als das der USA. Welchen Effekt die Berichterstattung – etwa über staatliche Überwachung und Schnüffelei, brachiale Corona-Lockdowns, Umweltverschmutzung oder Kriegsdrohungen gegen Taiwan – hatte und hat, lässt sich nicht bemessen.\nTourismus lebt von „positiven Bildern im Kopf“\n„Das Thema Image spielt beim Thema China sicher eine Rolle“, sagt Unternehmensberater Utzerath. Schlechte Publicity hinterlasse immer Spuren. „Und das liegt weniger daran, dass ein Land „unten durch“ wäre, sondern dass der Fluss an schönen Erfahrungen, positiven Reiseberichten und Eindrücken abreißt.“ Damit verlagere sich das Interesse. „Ich würde dem keine übermäßige Dramatik beimessen, aber das zeigt, was für ein volatiles Geschäft Tourismus ist. Die Branche lebt von Schlagzeilen und positiven Bildern im Kopf.“\nDieselbe Volatilität gilt auch für die USA: „Es ist im Moment nicht so, dass viele Schlagzeilen dafür sprechen, ausgerechnet jetzt in die USA zu reisen, wenn man letztes Jahr nicht dort war“, sagt Utzerath. Auf der anderen Seite ist der Dollar-Wechselkurs derzeit für Europäer durchaus günstig.\nChina braucht Touristen als Stütze einer schwachen Konjunktur\nAnders als die US-Regierung will Peking ausdrücklich mehr Reisende ins Land locken. Mittlerweile hat die chinesische Regierung ihre komplizierte und teure Visapolitik gelockert. Deutsche brauchen für Geschäfts- oder Tourismusreisen kein Visum mehr. Wer einreist, darf mittlerweile 30 Tage bleiben. Diese Regelung gilt auch für zahlreiche andere europäische Länder.\nAuch die Zugänge zum digitalen Bezahlsystem Chinas sind durch übersetzte Apps und Akzeptanz ausländischer Kreditkarten einfacher geworden. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres bezifferten die Behörden die Einreisen von Ausländern auf etwa 17,4 Millionen – im Jahresvergleich ein Zuwachs um etwas mehr als ein Drittel.\nPeking hofft, dass der Tourismus auch der heimischen Wirtschaft unter die Arme greift. Die schwache Nachfrage und eingetrübte Konsumlaune, die der Wirtschaftsleistung zusetzen, will China auch mit mehr Inlandstourismus wieder ankurbeln. Neue Angebote – etwa speziell für Senioren ausgelegte Zugreisen mit Krankenversorgung und Pflege an Bord – sollen auch die ältere Bevölkerung zu größerem Konsum bewegen. dpa",
