    "text": "The Buruli ulcer is most likely spread by mosquitoes. Photo: Еrop Kamalev.\nThe authors of a new research paper have warned that a flesh-eating ulcer could spread along the NSW coast after three cases were found in the southern part of the state in recent years.\nThe Buruli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans , is an under-recognised and debilitating soft tissue infection that usually causes non-healing ulcers, The Australian Journal of General Practice says.\nThe authors of a new research paper , published on PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases last week, examined two locally acquired cases of Buruli ulcer in Batemans Bay.\nIn the first, a 94-year-old eventually had a finger amputated after his wound progressively worsened in December 2020.\nThen, in May 2023, a 71-year-old noticed a mosquito bite on his arm. The bite eventually turned into a 4 x 4 centimetre ulcer, which improved three months after starting a strong course of antibiotics.\nThese two cases were linked to an earlier case in Eden, about 200 km to the south.\nREAD ALSO Are we looking at the wrong culprit in white-tailed spider-bite horror stories?\n“It is proposed that Batemans Bay is a new endemic focus of human Buruli ulcer transmission,” the research paper’s authors said.\nThey also said surveys confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium ulcerans in Batemans Bay’s possums.\n“Victoria has seen a significant public health challenge with Buruli ulcer, where the evidence points to zoonotic transmission from native possums to humans via mosquitoes,” the authors said.\n“The new cases we report here in Batemans Bay could be a harbinger of a disease expansion in NSW similar to Victoria.”\nIt is believed Buruli ulcers may spread to humans from possums via mosquitos. Photo: Ian Bushnell.\nThe authors said the strain of ulcers in Batemans Bay showed the propensity for Mycobacterium ulcerans to become established in new geographically separate possum populations.\n“The risk for further spread along coastal NSW is significant,” they said.\n“Given the many similarities in wildlife composition and insect presence between coastal Victoria and Eden and Batemans Bay in NSW, it is likely that NSW Public Health authorities are now facing the progressive expansion of Buruli ulcer endemic areas and an increase in human infections, just as has been in Victoria.”\nWhen contacted for comment on Wednesday (18 December), a spokesperson for the Southern NSW Local Health District (LHD) said there were no updates to provide since the LHD released a statement about the local cases in September 2023.\nREAD ALSO ‘It felt like the whole world was on fire’: five years on, we’re all still haunted by the Black Summer\nAt the time, the LHD urged the community to be alert to ulcer symptoms and to avoid mosquito bites after the three local cases were discovered.\n“All three people are understood to have been infected locally and are the only local transmissions observed in New South Wales to date,” the LHD’s senior medical officer, who is also one of the authors of the research paper, Dr Anton Forsyth said.\nThe discovery also resulted in ACT Deputy Chief Health Officer Dr Sally Singleton issuing a warning to Canberra’s clinicians in December 2023.\n“Please consider a diagnosis of Buruli ulcer in your patients who have spent time in the Batemans Bay area or in other known endemic areas, including coastal regions of Victoria, Far North Queensland and the Northern Territory, if they have a non-healing, enlarging skin ulcer with undermined edges, with no alternative explanation and not responding to routine antibiotic treatment,” she said.\nBuruli ulcers have been routinely reported in parts of Queensland, the NT and Victoria. The number varies widely from year to year but has increased to 200 to 340 cases each year since 2017.\nTwo cases of Buruli ulcer have been found in Batemans Bay over the past few years. Photo: Kim Treasure.\nDr Forsyth said it was not spread from person to person and was most likely spread by mosquitoes.\n“Residents can prevent mosquito breeding by removing items around their home that might collect water, such as old tyres or empty pots,” he said.\n“Drainage issues should be addressed so that water does not become stagnant. Ensure coverings for windows and doors have insect screens with no holes or gaps in them.”\nAn LHD spokesperson said the Buruli ulcer typically starts as a painless nodule or papule, often mistaken for an insect bite, and eventually progresses into an ulcer, which can last many months.\nPatients usually report symptoms around four to five months after being bitten by a mosquito, but symptoms may not appear for up to nine months.\n“Early recognition and treatment are important. Effective treatment consists of eight weeks of special antibiotic therapy. Anyone who is concerned about a non-healing skin ulcer should see their general practitioner,” the spokesperson said.",

    "text": "Hizbulá reivindica seis nuevos ataques contra Israel, que carga contra su infraestructura La formación chií se limitó a decir que en todos los casos sus combatientes emplearon “armas adecuadas” El grupo chií libanés Hizbulá reivindicó este jueves seis nuevos ataques contra objetivos militares en el norte de Israel, que por su parte anunció una serie de acciones de envergadura contra infraestructuras pertenecientes al movimiento armado en el sur del Líbano. En una serie de comunicados, Hizbulá se atribuyó la autoría de tres ataques contra posiciones del Ejército israelí, así como otros dos contra grupos de soldados y uno más que tuvo como objetivo un vehículo militar aparcado en el interior de un cuartel en las áreas septentrionales del Estado judío. La formación chií se limitó a decir que en todos los casos sus combatientes emplearon “armas adecuadas”, sin especificar de qué tipo. Sin embargo, las fuerzas israelíes aseguraron que hoy interceptaron un dron procedente del territorio libanés e informaron también de “lanzamientos” perpetrados desde el otro lado de la divisoria. El Estado judío atacó hoy infraestructura utilizada por Hizbulá con cazas, tanques y fuego de artillería, además de lanzar dos acciones contra sendos grupos de combatientes a los que acusó de haber disparado proyectiles contra el territorio israelí en las horas previas. Desde el pasado 8 de octubre, las partes están enzarzadas en un intercambio de ataques a través de la divisoria, fuego cruzado que se ha ido intensificando con el paso del tiempo y que ha desatado los miedos a que el Líbano se convierta en un segundo frente de la guerra de Gaza. Al menos 118 personas han muerto y otras 536 han resultado heridas en el Líbano desde el inicio de la violencia, que también ha obligado a más de 72.000 personas a abandonar sus hogares a ese lado de la frontera, según los últimos datos difundidos por el Ministerio de Salud Pública libanés.",

Nagkaruon nga tuloy ako ng anxiety attack dahil hindi ko akalain na at my age mahihiga ako sa hospital bed,” Lolit wrote candidly.\nShe described waking up each morning disoriented, confused by the unfamiliar surroundings of a hospital room. “Every time I wake up in the morning, shock ako na nasa ibang kuwarto ako… parang at a lost ako tuwing gigising. Pag umaga parang hinahanap ko ‘yung magulong kuwarto ko,” she shared.\nThe well-known entertainment personality admitted she had never been used to hospital scenarios, and the experience felt like a cultural shock. “Ang hirap pala ng maysakit. Hopeless, helpless, weak ka. Para bang hindi mo alam where and what to do,” she wrote, adding that she even felt like crying at times.\nDespite the emotional toll, Lolit found comfort and gratitude in the care she received from FEU Hospital staff, calling them “spoiling” and deeply attentive. “SALAMAT sa staffs ng FEU Hospital dahil napaka caring nila… Talagang spoiled patient ang feeling ko,” she expressed.\nReflecting on her situation with spiritual acceptance, she said: “Pero alam mo naman si GOD, alam niya when or where ibibigay sa iyo ang mga bagay. So grateful na ngayon older na ako nangyari ito. Meron na ako ng pasensiya at wisdom na tanggapin mga bagay.”\nLolit ended her post on a hopeful note, expressing her desire to recover and return to the life and work she loves:\n“Wishing na sana gumaling ako agad at maging active uli. I love life. I love my works. I love my friends.”\nLolit Solis is a well-known personality in the Philippine showbiz industry. Born on May 20, 1947, in Sampaloc, Manila, she started her career as an entertainment news writer and later became a talent manager and host of television talk shows.\nIn another report, Manay Lolit expressed disappointment over the partial senatorial election results, particularly Bong Revilla’s low ranking. She was alarmed by the number of votes Willie Revillame received and said she couldn’t accept the idea of him becoming a senator. Solis claimed that electing someone like Revillame would make the elections feel like a comedy and even called it a bad dream. The columnist urged voters to be wise and to choose the best leaders as a reflection of trust in those who will run the country.\nPreviously, the veteran columnist posted a heartfelt birthday message for Lani Mercado, who turned 57 on April 13. She praised Lani’s strength, loyalty, and her role as the legal wife of Senator Bong Revilla despite his child outside their marriage. The showbiz columnist emphasized the value of being the legitimate wife and highlighted Lani’s dignity and grace through personal challenges. Lastly, Lolit expressed pride in Lani’s children and called her a loyal, unchanged, and admirable woman through the years.\nBagong feature: Tingnan ang mga balitang para sa'yo ➡️ hanapin ang \"Recommended for you\" block at mag-enjoy!\nSource: KAMI.com.gh",
