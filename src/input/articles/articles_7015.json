    "title": "Fears for whānau as Whakatāne Hospital obstetric services collapse",
    "text": "Midwives in the eastern Bay of Plenty fear pregnant women and their babies will be at serious risk of harm with the collapse of obstetric services at Whakatāne Hospital.\nAll four specialists have resigned and although Health New Zealand is working to recruit more, in the meantime high-risk cases will be transferred to Tauranga Hospital from mid-January.\nAbout 650 babies are born in Whakatāne Hospital's district each year, 19% by caesarean.\nAbout half of those — nearly one in 10 — are emergency operations.\nOne local midwife, whom RNZ has agreed not to name, said and her colleagues were extremely worried for the whānau in their care.\n\"We feel sick about it, midwives don't want to come to work. What happens if something goes wrong? Will it be on me? It's not my fault there's no doctor available.\"\nTe Whatu Ora said Whakatāne would shift to a primary birthing service on a temporary basis from mid-January.\nHowever, midwives said the district was already without obstetric cover at times.\nThere has been been no obstetrician at the hospital since 8am Wednesday, with the next one due on shift at 8am on Saturday.\nAnother midwife, who also spoke to RNZ anonymously, said communication from hospital managers has been \"very poor\" and midwives did not feel adequately prepared.\n\"You could have a normal pregnancy and birth and then have a post-partum haemorrhage — there was one of those the other day, who had to be rushed to theatre.\n\"You could be labouring normally and then suddenly the baby is in distress and you need a caesarean,\" she said.\n\"Getting to Tauranga Hospital by ambulance, that's going to take an hour-and-a-half.\n\"We've already had problems with ambulances not being available. There's the chopper, but wouldn't a doctor be cheaper?\"\nMidwives calculated about 300 women a year may need to be transferred.\nLocal staff have been told it could be a year or 18 months before Whakatāne Hospital again has an obstetrics services.\nThe national chief midwife, Laura Aileone, said Te Whatu Ora acknowledged it was \"a difficult and unsettling time\" for the community.\nHowever, they could be assured that clinical safety came first.\n\"We have these escalation procedures and policies around the country in our other primary units and at our rural units. We have those in place and we'll be implementing them.\n\"This is our top priority.\"\nHealth NZ started recruiting internationally for obstetricians two weeks ago, she said.\nShe was not able to comment on why four specialists had resigned at the same time, nor what had been done to try to retain them.\n\"I can't talk to local district solutions, I sit at a national role obviously, but my understanding is that people have been working as hard as they can to both attract internationally and nationally, and work across districts and work across regions to see where we could get cover from some of our other centres.\"\nHowever, Whakatāne mayor Victor Luca, who was born in Whakatāne Hospital himself, said it was not acceptable that mothers and babies were being put at risk.\n\"It's very sad that people have to take risks to have their children now.\n\"You can assess a person, that's all very well, but if the unexpected happens, we won't be well placed to deal with them here — they'll have to be transferred to Tauranga.\nI'm just hoping this is a temporary thing, but unwinding these things once they've happened is not easy.\"\nHealth NZ had assured the College of Midwives that there would be supports for whānau who had to travel — and for midwives who would lose out financially with their clients transferred, chief executive Alison Eddy said.\n\"We don't want to lose any midwives from the region because their work becomes financially unsustainable.\n\"So I think those plans, as I understand it, are being put in place, and there's a real effort to ensure the midwifery workforce is retained, regardless of what's happening with the [obstetric] service at Whakatāne.\"\nBy Ruth Hill of rnz.co.nz",

    "title": "Douglas Anderson teacher guilty of offenses against student asks for minimum sentence, says he helped dozens of pupils",
    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – The sentence for disgraced former Douglas Anderson School of the Arts music teacher Jeffrey Clayton could be handed down Friday. In April, Clayton pleaded guilty to four felonies relating to grooming and touching a 16-year-old student and on Friday he will be back in court for a sentencing hearing. RELATED: Longtime Douglas Anderson music teacher pleads guilty after touching 16-year-old student, professing romantic feelings Clayton’s attorney is arguing for the minimum sentence, a little less than three years in prison, and laid out the reasoning in a memo filed last week. He faces up to 40 years. The memo lists dozens of students he claimed to have helped succeed, but some have come out and said they don’t want their stories used to argue for a lighter sentence. On Friday, he will also be confronted by the testimony of four female students, including the victim he pleaded guilty to touching last year. As part of a plea agreement, a total of seven additional female students were set to testify at Clayton’s sentencing, although the State Attorney’s Office said four of them have decided they will not participate. Clayton said he never abused anyone but the victim in the case at hand, and the state has also agreed as part of the plea agreement not to bring additional charges against Clayton related to his time at DA. RELATED: ‘My high school hell’: Letters from former Douglas Anderson students detail years of anguish involving accused teacher | Warrant shows what led to arrest of Douglas Anderson school music teacher In a court filing, Clayton’s attorney notes his client’s lack of prior criminal history, good behavior on bail, and support from former students, parents and colleagues who have written him character letters. He also lists the initials and brief bios of dozens of former students, that “Mr. Clayton trained, coached, and helped go to the next level, whether through college or outside of college, in furtherance of their musical career.” Former DA student Shyla Jenkins said this is ironic because Clayton’s power over students’ careers was a tool he wielded to abuse. “He had absolute total rein to direct your career, whether you succeeded or didn’t and so to use those names in the way that he did, to show that he’s such a great person is a betrayal because it’s not the truth,” Jenkins said. Some of the former students listed said they didn’t give permission to be included in the filing. News4JAX received an email from someone who said they were identified among the success stories. She said Clayton picked her as a favorite and groomed her as a vulnerable teen, and although it never got physical, it led to backlash from peers and staff. “I, and many of my fellow alumni find it perplexing, pathetic, and offensive to not only attempt to take responsibility for OUR hard work and accomplishments but to go so far as to use them as cover to excuse his abhorrent and inexcusable behavior,” she wrote. MORE: Douglas Anderson music teacher’s disciplinary history shows record of being accused of inappropriately touching students She said she used to think of Clayton fondly, but “Now when I think about all the time I spent with him, just texting, or all the hours completely alone and behind closed doors, I feel ill. I feel betrayed and I hate him.” “I loathe him absolutely for thinking he could use me, even in this small way, to vouch for him,” she wrote. “He shows a clear pattern of this type of behavior, a disregard for the safety of children, a lack of respect for his career, community, family, and common decency. He is sick, he is dangerous, and he should get the maximum sentence available.” News4JAX asked Clayton’s attorney about the student’s claim that she was not asked to be included in the statements. “No confidential information of any former student was used in any portion of the sentencing memorandum and nowhere was it represented that any of these former students supported or support Mr. Clayton in any way or condone his behavior. Out of respect for the concerns of some of these individuals that have reached out to my office, however, that entire section of the memorandum has been redacted. Separately, multiple former DA students, former DA parents, and friends and family of Mr. Clayton, while of course not in any way condoning or supporting his conduct that led to these charges, have offered their support which will be presented at sentencing tomorrow,” attorney John Rockwell said in a statement. The sentencing hearing is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Clayton’s arrest last spring unleashed a barrage of other allegations of abuse and a toxic culture at the school and led to other teachers being removed from the classroom amid investigations .",

    "text": "ALTA MUNTANYA\nAigüestortes lloga GPS a excursionistes per a les emergències\nLa informació s’ha reforçat amb cartells en refugis i en taxis d’alta muntanya\nEl parc nacional treballa per resoldre la falta de cobertura de telefonia i que es pugui contactar amb el 112 des de més punts de l’espai natural.\nL’únic parc nacional de Catalunya, Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici, ben just disposa de cobertura per trucar al 112, el telèfon d’emergències. L’orografia de la zona és complexa i els repartidors no són prou potents. Aquest problema històric suposa un risc greu, ja que aquest espai natural és una de les zones d’alta muntanya més freqüentades per excursionistes, que en molts casos gaudeixen de la famosa ruta Carros de Foc. En cas de tenir un accident lluny dels refugis, sense un aparell de geolocalització, és gairebé impossible demanar ajuda.\nAra, la direcció del parc i el Departament de Territori, Habitatge i Transició Ecològica s’han proposat remeiar-ho, segons ha pogut saber aquest diari. El gran repte és aconseguir que la cobertura s’expandeixi cap a més punts d’aquest lloc protegit. \"Estem treballant amb els sistemes d’emergències per arribar a un acord que permeti ampliar la cobertura i fer trucades d’emergència via satèl·lit\", explica Lluís Florit, director d’Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici.\nNo obstant, mentre aquesta mesura definitiva no arriba, el parc ha ideat una solució nova que estarà disponible a partir de la setmana vinent: \"Oferirem als alpinistes que ho desitgin uns dispositius GPS des dels quals es podrà enviar un missatge de socors a través d’un botó\". Es tracta d’uns aparells més petits que un mòbil que es podran llogar per 30 euros als centres d’informació d’Espot i Boí, tot i que en un futur també es trobaran als refugis.\nDe moment, com que són artefactes molt cars, n’hi haurà 10. \"Però n’adquirirem més en funció de la demanda\", assegura Florit en conversa amb EL PERIÓDICO. En paral·lel, també s’ha reforçat la informació, perquè els visitants siguin conscients que en la major part del parc nacional no hi ha cobertura.\n\"Ho advertim en cartells als refugis i als taxis d’alta muntanya\", precisa el director. \"Parc sense cobertura mòbil, ni per a trucades al 112. Entres en un espai d’alta muntanya amb riscos intrínsecs, el parc disposa d’aparells GPS per a més seguretat\", diuen els rètols, que pretenen incentivar la gent perquè utilitzi aquests nous artefactes que actuaran com a xarxa de seguretat. Recentment també s’ha habilitat un helistop, un petit espai nou perquè l’helicòpter pugui aterrar.\nNotícies relacionadesAccidents recurrents\nA Aigüestortes, cada any es registren accidents. I, en diverses ocasions, el drama s’ha agreujat per la falta de cobertura. Aquesta primavera, els bombers van evacuar dos excursionistes ferits i amb hipotèrmia. No van poder alertar els serveis d’emergències i la recerca va començar perquè no havien tornat al cotxe. El 2022, va morir una parella de francesos a l’hospital després de ser trobats inconscients i amb hipotèrmia a la vall de Boí. En aquest cas, els que van donar l’avís van ser altres excursionistes que els van localitzar prop d’un estany.\n-\nOfert per\nEmma Vilarasau arriba a la Villarroel amb ‘Un matrimoni de Boston’ sota la direcció de Josep María Mestres, que revisita el seu mític espectacle sobre el text de David Mamet -\nIncapacitat temporalLa Seguretat Social estudiarà un retorn \"flexible\" després d’una baixa -\nLa jutge degana de Barcelona apressa a crear sis nous jutjats penals -\nEl sistema sanitari públicSalut injectarà 2.800 milions per revertir el dèficit que acumula la sanitat -\nS’acomiada el futbolista dels gols miraculosos\n-\nGuerra a l’est d’EuropaRússia ataca les infraestructures energètiques d’Ucraïna -\nLa carrera a la Casa BlancaEls nord-americans deuen 220.000 milions de dòlars en despeses mèdiques -\nhttps://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/internacional/20241004/sanitat-entra-campanya-108893751La sanitat entra en campanya -\n30% d’augment93.000 morts per sobredosi el 2020 -\nEl conflicte del Pròxim OrientIsrael amplia l’evacuació del sud del Líban mentre bombardeja Beirut",

    "title": "Study Finds Blacks & Hispanics Most Affected By Toxic Air In NYC Subway",
    "text": "Everyone is aware that air pollution has been a problem for decades now, but a new study is finding that Black and Hispanic people are more susceptible to its negative affects in New York City. [Gothamist](https://gothamist.com/news/toxic-subway-air-is-worse-for-black-and-hispanic-commuters-nyu-researchers-say) is reporting that the toxic air in the New York City subway system is having an impact on low-income riders, who happen to be Black and Hispanic men and women, due to their longer commutes and train transfers throughout the day. With that being the case, commuters are being exposed to tiny particles, known as particle matter, which can enter the lungs and make its way into the bloodstream causing all kinds of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Masoud Ghandehari, a professor of civil and urban engineering, says that he actually tends to “hold my breath before I come out of the station because I know that’s when the concentrations are up,” whenever riding the subway as the “air quality in New York’s subway system exceeds the World Health Organization’s exposure guidelines by up to 15 times.” But it doesn’t stop there. He also found other disturbing data. Gothamist reports: He said the research found that longer commutes with more transfers and time spent waiting on platforms led to higher exposure to polluted air. Black and Hispanic riders experienced 35% and 23% more polluted air, respectively, compared to Asian and white commuters, Ghandehari said. “When the train comes by, all the metal in the bottom of the tunnel gets turned up,” he said. “Every time the door opens, concentrations in the train go up because the outdoor environment, the platforms, are higher in concentration.” The paper showed the stations with the highest levels of particulate matter are 168th Street and 181st Street on the 1 train, Bowling Green’s 5 line, the Broadway-Lafayette B station and the High Street train. Ghandehari’s team developed an [online map](https://nycsubwaypollution.pythonanywhere.com/) so straphangers can plot their typical commute and approximate their particulate exposure. Yeah, people might want to actually wear N95 masks again whenever riding public transportation in New York City. This time around, it’s not to protect themselves from COVID. Still, MTA Communications Director Tim Minton didn’t agree with Ghandehari’s findings and said his research has been debunked in the past. “This recycled ‘study’ based on years-old ‘data’ has long since been debunked,” Minton said in a statement. “Every serious person knows transit is the antidote to climate change, the one reason NYC is the greenest city around, and an engine of equity for people of all communities who need an affordable, safe way to get to jobs, schools and opportunities of every kind.” Yeah, we’re leaning towards going with the professor on this one. No shots. Are y’all going to take heed and wear masks when riding the subway in New York City? Let us know in the comments section below.",
