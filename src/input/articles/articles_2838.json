    "text": "Almost one in ten UK workers increasingly trapped in precarious work\n29 November 2024\nIt is concerning that 8% of UK workers are ‘increasingly precarious’ – likely to be stuck in low-paid, insecure or otherwise uncertain work – say researchers from UCL in a new report on the UK labour market.\nThe report, commissioned by the Director of Labour Market Enforcement (DLME), is the most comprehensive research to date on precarious work in the UK and the first to assess workers trajectories over time to chart their changing career fortunes. It is the foundation for the UK’s biggest survey on labour market exploitation, the Working Lives Survey, which will open in 2025.\nThe researchers analysed data from the Understanding Society survey (2009-2022), which tracks members of 40,000 households to understand how life in the UK is changing.\nThey found that 10-10.7% of the UK workforce is in precarious work and that, contrary to some recent assessments, this proportion has been relatively stable since 2009 when tracking began1.\nPrecarious workers were more likely to be female, younger and working class. They also tended to be concentrated in the hospitality, retail and construction industries, and were half as likely to work in unionised workplaces compared to non-precarious workers.\nDespite the stability of the headline number, the longitudinal analysis revealed that 8% of UK workers are in a group defined as ‘increasingly precarious’, which means that they are more likely to remain in precarious work over time, rather than progressing to more secure opportunities.\n‘Increasingly precarious’ workers were also clearly different from other groups: a third of them lived in three regions of England (London, North-West, and South-West), half of them worked for four industries (hospitality, retail, agriculture, and construction), and 90% stayed within the same industry over the studied period.\nThe report comes at a time when there are growing concerns about precarious working, including ‘gig economy’ jobs like food delivery drivers and zero hours contracts in industries such as hospitality and retail.\nDr Krisztián Pósch, lead author of the study from UCL Security & Crime Science, said: “Concerns about precarious work have been growing in the UK in recent years, which have seen the rise of the ‘gig economy’ and other forms of what we refer to as non-traditional work.\n“Though we didn’t find an increase in the proportion of precarious workers relative to more stable forms of employment, the fact that 8% of UK workers are increasingly likely to get ‘trapped’ in precarious work over time should be a matter of concern.\n“These people don’t move on to more secure jobs, as many people who start out in precarious work do as their career progresses. Instead, the chances of them falling into and staying in precarious work only get higher.”\nThe report classified UK workers, which includes around 37.2 million jobs (ONS estimate for March 2024), into five groups according to factors such as income, age, and type of work:\n- Traditional workers (49% of workforce), such as those on permanent contracts with steady salaries, were highly unlikely to fall into precarious work.\n- Transitional workers (25%), such as people with caring responsibilities, were those who came in and out of precarious work.\n- Early career workers (10%), such as school leavers or recent university graduates, were younger and likely to find better paid, more secure employment over time.\n- Non-traditional workers (8%) were those in gig economy or self-employed roles, who were also likely to progress to less precarious and more traditional work over time.\n- Increasingly precarious workers (8%) were those who became more and more likely to enter and remain in precarious labour over time.\nThe authors also looked at the legislative landscape around labour in the UK, which they concluded is complex, fragmented and patchy in terms of state enforcement of workers’ rights. They found that insufficient funding for and the narrow scope of state enforcement agencies meant workers are often responsible for exercising their own rights via the employment tribunal system, which can present major barriers to accessing labour justice.\nProfessor Virginia Mantouvalou, an author of the report from UCL Laws who specialises in human rights and labour law, said: “The legal framework for labour in the UK and its weak enforcement leave many people trapped in precarious work and vulnerable to exploitation. For precarious workers to be able to access better jobs, we need stronger protection of workers’ rights in law and in practice.”\nThe report lays the foundation for the UK’s biggest survey on labour market exploitation, the Working Lives Survey, which will be conducted by the same team behind this report and is due to begin gathering responses in January 2025. Survey data will be complemented by qualitative data to understand workers’ experiences and co-create ways to help prevent labour market exploitation and respond more effectively when it does occur.\nThe findings come at a pivotal time, with major policy moves to improve the labour market for workers currently underway.\nThe Employment Rights Bill, which addresses aspects of non-traditional labour such as zero hours contracts, was introduced in the House of Commons in October 2024. The Bill includes the creation of a new Fair Work Agency (FWA), whose remit will be to enforce workers’ rights and curb labour abuse.\nDr Ella Cockbain, the project co-lead and an author of the study from UCL Security & Crime Science, said: “Perhaps the most striking finding from this initial study for me has been that for a significant proportion of the UK workforce, precarious work isn’t a fleeting phase when they are first starting out or studying. This is something that many people get stuck in for years on end, which can have far-reaching negative impacts on their quality of life and ability to make ends meet.\n“This raises important questions from a policy perspective, particularly how best to support increasingly precarious workers. Having a sizeable chunk of the working population stuck in precarious jobs should not be seen as an inevitable part of a modern workforce. The key next step for us is to understand the extent of violations of labour rights experienced by precarious workers, widely thought to be a high-risk group.”\nMargaret Beels, the UK’s Director of Labour Market Enforcement, who commissioned the study, said: “I’m glad to see this report published today and the progress this report has made toward revealing the precarious nature of working in the UK.\n“As discussed in my strategies, I’ve always been concerned about the data gap which exists in understanding both the scale and nature of non-compliance across all working populations in the UK. This report goes some way to increasing my understanding.\n“As the UK’s state labour market enforcement moves towards the Fair Work Agency this report, and the final report available next year, will provide invaluable insights as to the scale and nature of labour exploitation which will help to shape the focus of the FWA’s work.”\nLinks\n[Read the full report on gov.uk.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessment-of-the-scale-and-nature-of-labour-market-non-compliance-in-the-uk-interim-report)[Dr Krisztián Pósch's academic profile](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/77908-krisztian-posch)[Dr Ella Cockbain's academic profile](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/28318-ella-cockbain)[Professor Virginia Mantouvalou's academic profile](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/22589-virginia-mantouvalou)[Professor Ben Bradford's academic profile](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/62705)[UCL Department of Security and Crime Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/security-crime-science/ucl-department-security-and-crime-science)[UCL Faculty of Engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/engineering/)[UCL Faculty of Laws](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/)\nImage\nCredit:\n[Simon Shepheard](https://www.istockphoto.com/portfolio/SimonShepheard?mediatype=photography)on iStock.\nMedia contact\nDr Matt Midgley\nE: m.midgley [at] ucl.ac.uk",

    "text": "Job opportunities exist in Latin America and the Caribbean, but the quality of employment remains a significant challenge. According to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), urgent measures are needed to ensure workers can escape poverty and enjoy social protection.\nLatin America and the Caribbean face a persistent issue: while many people are employed, the quality of those jobs leaves much to be desired. According to the 2024 Better Jobs Index from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the region’s employment quality scores an average of 41.2 out of 100, highlighting the prevalence of informal, low-wage jobs that lack benefits and social security.\nInformality is a massive issue—nearly 55% of the workforce is employed without a formal contract, meaning these workers lack access to social protections like health insurance and pensions. Additionally, 3 out of 10 workers do not earn enough to rise above the poverty line. This is a critical issue for a region where 70% of people rely on work as their only source of income.\nTake the case of Peru, where street vendors, domestic workers, and other informal sector employees make up a significant portion of the workforce. Many workers lack stable income, health insurance, and retirement benefits, leaving them vulnerable to economic shocks. The pandemic further exposed these vulnerabilities, with thousands losing their livelihoods almost overnight.\nThe IDB’s report shows that improving job quality is not just about increasing employment rates. It’s about creating jobs, providing economic stability, and protecting social welfare, requiring policy changes and targeted efforts by governments and the private sector.\nGender and Youth Disparities in the Labor Market The IDB report also illuminates significant inequalities in employment, particularly for women and young people. Women in Latin America consistently find themselves in lower-quality jobs than men, with a 16-point gap in the Better Jobs Index.\nIn Brazil, for example, women often face additional challenges in the labor market. Despite progress in education, many women remain concentrated in low-paying sectors such as domestic work or informal retail, which often lack benefits. Furthermore, women are more likely to experience wage gaps and struggle with balancing unpaid caregiving responsibilities with paid work. This has resulted in many women taking up part-time or informal work, reducing their access to quality jobs.\nMeanwhile, young workers—particularly those between 18 and 24—are also disadvantaged. The report highlights a 15-point gap in job quality between younger and older workers. In countries like Uruguay, which scores relatively well on overall job quality, the disparity between young and older workers is the highest in the region. Young people often find themselves stuck in precarious, low-wage jobs or unemployed, unable to enter the formal labor market.\nFor instance, many young workers in Argentina are employed in temporary or freelance positions with few protections. This situation makes it difficult for them to save for the future, contribute to pension plans, or access health insurance. As a result, they face a much higher risk of poverty and economic instability compared to their older counterparts.\nEfforts to close these gaps must be at the forefront of policies to improve the overall quality of employment. This means promoting gender equality in the workforce, offering vocational training for youth, and ensuring that formal jobs are accessible to all.\nPractical Solutions for Improving Job Quality The IDB report highlights problems and proposes practical solutions to improve regional employment quality. One key recommendation is to invest in human capital by aligning workers’ skills with the labor market’s needs.\nTake Costa Rica, for example. The government recently launched programs to improve technical and vocational education to ensure workers are prepared for higher-quality jobs. Costa Rica aims to improve its labor market outcomes and reduce informal employment by upskilling workers in high-demand fields such as technology and green energy.\nAnother important solution is promoting formal employment by reducing the costs associated with hiring formal workers. Many businesses in the region avoid formal contracts due to the high cost of providing social security and health benefits. Lowering these costs or offering tax incentives for businesses that formalize their workers could help bring more people into the formal labor market.\nIn Mexico, for example, programs like Seguro Popular have provided health insurance to informal workers. But there is still much to be done in terms of bringing these workers into formal employment, where they can access a full range of benefits. Extending social protections to informal workers—through policies like universal healthcare or retirement savings programs—could help mitigate some of the risks faced by those in precarious jobs.\nFinally, strengthening public employment services is essential. Many countries lack effective job placement programs that connect job seekers with formal employment opportunities. In places like Chile, public employment services have been bolstered through digital platforms and partnerships with private companies, which have led to better matching of workers’ skills with available jobs.\nThe Long Road Ahead for Employment Quality While the 2024 Better Jobs Index shows some improvements since its inception, progress remains slow. At the current rate of improvement, it could take nearly five decades for Latin America to reach an employment quality score of 70 out of 100, which still falls short of ensuring that all workers have access to decent, formal employment.\nCountries like Uruguay, which tops the index, demonstrate that it is possible to achieve higher employment standards, but even there, inequalities persist. The IDB’s data shows that even top performers in the region are grappling with significant disparities between different demographic groups.\nAs the region moves forward, governments must prioritize labor market reforms that focus not just on job creation but on the quality and sustainability of those jobs. Policies that promote formal employment, protect vulnerable groups like women and youth, and equip workers with the skills needed for a changing economy will be key to improving job quality across Latin America.\nWhile the road ahead is long, the IDB’s report offers a roadmap for progress. Countries that take a proactive approach to improving job quality will be better positioned to foster sustainable economic growth and ensure that all workers can access the benefits and protections they deserve.\nImproving the quality of jobs in Latin America and the Caribbean is not only an economic necessity but a social imperative. As countries continue to grapple with high levels of informal employment and inequality in the labor market, targeted efforts must be made to ensure that all workers have access to decent, formal jobs.\nAlso read: Google’s $850 Million Bet to Transform Latin America’s Digital Future\nBy investing in education and skills training, promoting formal employment, and expanding access to social protections, governments can help lift millions of workers out of poverty and create a more equitable labor market. The solutions are clear, but the challenge lies in their implementation.\nWith the right policies, the region can move toward a future where work is not just a means of survival but a path to economic security and personal fulfillment.",

    "text": "Locals guard temples, houses after attack on Bidyadharpur Hindu community\nThe Bidyadharpur village is in Bakshimil Union of Mohanpur upazila, Rajshahi and the Mohanpur upazila central temple is located in this village. 95 Hindu families live around this temple. Following the fall of Sheikh Hasina government on 5 August, a group of people from a victory procession carried out attacks on this neighbourhood.\nMembers of the Hindu community said attacks carried out on 25 of their houses. The attackers struck everything with sticks during their march.\nAs the violence erupted, the village women fled to nearby fields in fear, while those who could not escape locked themselves inside their homes.\nSince the incident, the residents of Vidyadharpur have been living in constant fear. Young men from the neighborhood have been remaining awake at night, guarding the temple, homes, and shops. In response to the situation, the upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) accompanied by law enforcement officials visited the area on 14 August. The UNO assured the frightened Hindu community that there would be no further attacks.\nVidyadharpur village is located on the eastern side of the Rajshahi-Naogaon highway, about one kilometer south from the Mohanpur police station. A road leads into the village from the highway. The road of the Hindu community leads to the south.\nThe road of the east leads to the Muslim community.\nWhile visiting the Hindu neighborhood on Wednesday, Prothom Alo correspondent spoke to two young men at the entrance to the village. When asked whether attacks were carried out on 5 August, Rakibul Islam, 20 and Akash, 18, claimed that nothing had happened in this village. Pointing to a broken shop, when asked when it was damaged, they said they did not know. However, a man sitting nearby quietly said, \"It was broken on the day of the vandalism.\"\nResidents of the Hindu neighborhood recounted that on the evening of 5 August at around 7:30 PM, a group of people armed with sticks entered their homes and began attacking. There was no electricity at the time. The attackers did not chant any slogans. They entered from one side of the Hindu neighborhood, vandalised for half an hour, and then left from the other side.\nSukumar Pramanik, 45, a teacher at Amrail High School in the upazila, was beaten up by the attackers when he tried to stop the attackers. One of his arms was broken. He underwent a surgery on his hand on Tuesday and was resting at home today, with a bandage on his left arm.\nSpeaking to Prothom Alo, he said, \"In the evening of 5 August, after 7:30 PM, some boys from the village came to attack my house with sticks. I couldn't believe that these boys would attack me. The Hindu and Muslim villagers all respect me as a teacher. Whenever they see me, they greet me with salaam. I have good relations with everyone, and I help them in any way I can. It was my courage that led me to try to stop the attack.\"\n\"I asked them, 'Why are you doing this?' Two of my close friends were also in the procession. While they were trying to stop them, the boys attacked me with sticks. When I tried to defend myself with my hand, I received strikeon my left arm. An X-ray at the hospital revealed that my arm was broken,\" Sukumar lamented.\nThe home of Shyamal Kumar, a teacher at Bhimnagar High School, was also attacked that day. The tin roof of his house was vandalized. Shyamal Kumar was not at home.\nBut his wife, Suchitra Rani, said, \"When they tried to break the gate of our house, we were so scared inside that it felt like we were about to have a stroke.\"\nThe tin roof of the house belonging to Bobin Kumar Sarkar, a teacher at Mohanpur College, and his brother, Bipul Kumar Sarkar, was also vandalised. Two windows of the house and the pipes of the toilet were broken by sticks. Bipul Kumar Sarkar's wife, Poppy Rani Sarkar, said that they had locked the outer gate and stayed inside. The attackers tried but failed to break the door.\nThe glass windows of the house belonging to Bishwajit Pramanik were shattered, and their water tank was also destroyed. Two glass windows of Ashutosh Pramanik's house were also broken, one of which has been repaired. His wife said it cost them Tk 3,300 to repair just one window.\nThe roof of Upendra Pramanik's cattle shed was also vandalized. He made a shop by the side of the road, which was also attacked. Upendra’s wife, Arati Pramanik, said that the shop had not yet been stocked with goods when the attack occurred, leaving it damaged. They do not have courage to run the shop.\nThe attackers vandalised the glass windows of the house of Sudarshan Chandra Sarker. Sudarshan said that there were no men at home that day. The women locked themselves inside, and the attackers tried to break the door. When they failed, they smashed the glass windows and the electricity meter before leaving. Additionally, the glass windows of three of the houses belonging to Deepak Sarker were broken, and they remain unrepaired.\nThe veranda roof of Narayan Sarker's house, Ajit Sarker's shop, the veranda roofs of two houses belonging to Parshuram Pramanik, the veranda roof of Narayan Pramanik's house, the tin roof and toilet pipes of Sushen Pramanik's house, the window of Asit Kumar Sarker's house, and the window of Ratan Pramanik's house were all damaged by sticks. Some were broken, while others were bent and twisted.\nThe veranda roof of the house belonging to Binoy Pramanik was also damaged, and they have now covered it with plastic to keep out the rain.\nThe glass windows, kitchen roof, and ventilator of Avinash Saha's house were also broken. Avinash’s wife, Molina Saha, said that half of the house belongs to her brother-in-law, Nitai Chandra Saha. The glass windows of both houses were broken. During the attack, they locked themselves inside, and the attackers tried to break the door as well.\nAjit Sarkar’s tea shop, which was located by the roadside, was completely vandalized, with the roof and goods all destroyed.\nAt the Mohanpur police station, it was learned that none of the residents of Vidyadharpur's Hindu neighborhood had filed a case regarding the attack.\nThe officer-in-charge of the station, Haridas Mandal, visited the village and met Yunus Ali, the general secretary of the BNP's Maugachi union.\nHe said, \"This is the manifestation of people's long-standing grievances.\"\nWhen asked about the situation, Mohanpur's UNO Ayesha Siddika told Prothom Alo, \"Around midnight on 14 August, I went to the central temple of Vidyadharpur village with law enforcement. The villagers were guarding the temple that night. I assured them that no such incident would occur in the village again.\n\"Later, in the afternoon on 16 August, I held a meeing with local leaders of the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami. Members of the Hindu community of Vidyadharpur village were also present. In front of them, the local leaders assured them that no such incident would occur again. They promised to take care of the matter. Since then, no such incidents have occurred in the village,\" the UNO added.",

But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing.

Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "Mike Chu\nOnly 9 percent of Hong Kong enterprises are fully prepared to deploy and utilize artificial intelligence technologies, significantly lower than the 25 percent last year, a survey found.\nCisco, a global leader in networking and security, conducted a double-blind survey that involved interviewing 3,660 senior business leaders responsible for the integration and preparation for the use of AI from companies with more than 500 employees in 14 different Asia-Pacific economies.\nAmong the 200 interviewees from Hong Kong, 97 percent believe deploying AI is an urgent need for corporations in the past year, while 48 percent of corporations have already allocated 10 to 30 percent of their IT budget to deploying AI.\nDespite the high awareness of implementing AI, 60 percent of corporations reflect that they see little to no gains in augmenting, assisting or automating their current processes and operations.\nIn addition, 63 percent of companies believe they will face negative impacts if they do not get their AI strategies right.\nSome 14 percent plan to put more than 40 percent of their IT budget into AI in the next four to five years, jumping from 3 percent of respondents last year, indicating that the unexpectedly low returns and the fear of lagging behind had prompted them to accelerate their AI investment projects.\nThe survey also highlighted the importance of talent in developing AI from companies across the Asia Pacific. Attracting global talent has been a top priority of the SAR with policies like Top Talent Pass Scheme and Quality Migrant Admission Scheme expanding their scope.\nHowever, low AI penetration also came as a red flag to the city's attempt at new industrialization and development into an international IT center with increased government investment.",
