    "title": "Big Sean To Focus On Mental Wellness In His First Book 'Go Higher' | iHeartRadio",
    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nBig Sean aims to tell his story about mental wellness in his first book.\nOn Wednesday, April 3, the Detroit native has teamed up with Simon & Schuster's Simon Element to publish his debut book . In a video he posted to his Instagram timeline, Sean explains how he started his mission of self-realization by embracing methods his mom showed him when he was a child. He also revealed the moment he was inspired to write a book about his mental health journey after he appeared on Jay Shetty's podcast . Afterward, he announced the title of his book Go Higher.\n“Besides the music, another project that’s been years in the making and it’s finally time,” he declared. “I can’t even believe it for real. But anyone who know me since I signed my record deal knows if you look at my old YouTubes, I’ve always been about speaking from the heart, following your intuition and checking in with yourself mentally, because that’s how I was raised.”\nAccording to a press release, the book is \"filled with step-by-step instructions for the tools Sean has been using on a daily basis for the last decade—journaling, agreements, affirmations, and meditation, as well as prompts to guide you on your own journey of self-reflection.\" The book comes amid all the new music Sean has released.\nLast month, he dropped a freestyle in which he talks to the \"Old Sean\" over a classic J Dilla beat. He also debuted his latest single \"Precision\" at the end of his set at Rolling Loud in California, and dedicated his upcoming track \"On Up\" to his newborn son Noah during his \"Tiny Desk\" performance . His latest releases is leading up to his forthcoming album coming soon.\nBig Sean's first book drops October 8, 2024.",

    "text": "Brisbane weather report: Rain threat casts shadow over India vs Australia Gabba Test Day 1\nThe weather could play a significant role in the outcome of the third Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test.\nThe [2024/25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/series-india-vs-australia-2024) is poised on a knife's edge with both India and Australia enjoying big wins in the first two Tests. Both matches were hotly contested, as opposed to what the results at the end of the Tests would indicate, which has increased the anticipation for the third Test at the Gabba in Brisbane. However, there is a chance that fans would have to wait for a little longer for the match to kick off.\nWhile the weather forecast for the rest of the match remains somewhat favourable, there is a very good chance of rain disrupting Day 1 of the Test. AccuWeather shows an 88 percent probability of rain on Saturday in Brisbane. While only a morning shower and humidity is predicted for the second day, there is 65 percent probability of rain shown on the third and fourth days which could interrupt the match even further.\nIndia looking to strengthen hold over Gabba fortress\nThe third Test marks a return to a venue where India recorded a historic win the last time they turned out in whites. India beat Australia by three wickets in the 2021 Test, which confirmed an extraordinary second consecutive Test series win in the country for them. They were also the first team to beat Australia in a Test match at the Gabba since Viv Richards' world-beating West Indies side in 1988.\nWhile that was the last Test of the previous tour, it marks the midway point of India's tour Down Under this time, which consists of five matches instead of the usual four. While India started the tour off with an emphatic 295-run win in Perth, Australia fought back by winning the second pink-ball Test by 10 wickets in Adelaide.\nAustralia captain [Pat Cummins](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/players/pat-cummins-56964) has said that fast bowler Josh Hazlewood will return to the squad at the Gabba in place of Scott Boland. This is despite Boland taking five wickets in Adelaide. \"It’s tough. He was fantastic in Adelaide and unfortunately he’s spent quite a lot of time on the bench in the last 18 months and whenever he plays he’s fantastic. It’s a shame for Scotty but there’s still a fair bit to play out this series so I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t get another crack at some point,\" Cummins said.\n[live cricket score](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/live-score),\n[cricket players](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/players), match schedules and\n[ICC rankings](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/icc-rankings).

    "text": "Desemprego cai para 7,5% no trimestre terminado em novembro Ao todo, 100 milhões de pessoas estão ativas no mercado de trabalho; valor é o maior da série histórica iniciada em 2012 A taxa de desemprego no Brasil foi de 7,5% no trimestre que reúne os meses de setembro, outubro e novembro. O dado consta na pesquisa Pnad Contínua (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios Contínua), divulgada pelo IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística) nesta 6ª feira (29.dez.2023). Eis a [íntegra](https://static.poder360.com.br/2023/12/pnacm_2023_nov.pdf) da apresentação (PDF – 671 kB). Esta é 3ª queda consecutiva na desocupação registrada pelo levantamento. Em comparação ao trimestre anterior, encerrado em agosto, o índice reduziu 0,2 ponto percentual. Ao todo, 8,2 milhões de brasileiros estão desocupados no país. O valor é 6,2% menor quando comparado com o mesmo período em 2022. A pesquisa estima, ainda, que 100,5 milhões de pessoas estão ocupadas, o equivalente a um crescimento de 0,9% em comparação aos 3 meses anteriores. A variação representa um adicional de 853 mil pessoas empregadas na força de trabalho. A taxa de ocupação constatada é a maior da série histórica da Pnad Contínua, iniciada em 2012. A maior parte dos novos brasileiros empregados foi absorvida pelo mercado de trabalho no setor privado com carteira assinada. Nessa categoria, foram 515 mil novas pessoas ocupadas. A informalidade permaneceu estável e contempla 39,2% da população ocupada. O índice equivale a 39,4 milhões de trabalhadores. Nos 3 meses anteriores, a taxa era de de 39,1%. Com relação ao rendimento médio real da população, a Pnad Contínua registrou uma alta de 2,3% para o trimestre. O valor chegou a R$ 3.034. O crescimento foi maior para aqueles que trabalham por conta própria com CNPJ (7,6%) e para os com carteira assinada no setor privado (2,1%).",

    "text": "An Israeli military spokesperson reported that Hizbollah had fired multiple missiles at a church in northern Israel, injuring nine soldiers and two civilians. “Hizbollah is committing war crimes by indiscriminately attacking places”, he contended. “Hizbollah is trying to drag the country of Lebanon and the region into this war that Hamas started. If Hizbollah continues, they will bear the consequences and the responsibility for the outcome: an unnecessary war aimed at fulfilling an ISIS ideology, that could bring unwanted destruction to the people of Lebanon in this war… We are preparing for all scenarios should a diplomatic solution not be found to Hizbollah’s constant violations of UN Security Council Resolution 1701”. Throughout the day, Hizbollah claimed responsibility for several strikes at Israeli targets near the border. The Israeli military struck the origins of the launches, in addition to Hizbollah infrastructure; four individuals were killed, including two Hizbollah fighters.\nReceive the best source of conflict analysis right in your inbox.\nThis site uses cookies.
