Food processing company Olymel confirmed that affected nuggets contain “extraneous material”—aka unexpected bits of bone.\nDetails of the recall:\nBrand: Swiss Chalet Product: Chicken Breast Nuggets (Frozen) Size: 700 g UPC: 066701011479 Best-before dates: BB 2025 SE 07 and BB 2025 SE 26\nThe nuggets have been pulled from shelves across Canada, but if you already have a box, don’t eat them!\nThe CFIA says you should either toss them out or return them to the store where you bought them. And no, you cannot sell, share, or redistribute recalled food—it’s against the law.\nThe agency hasn’t said how many injuries have been reported or exactly how many packages are affected, but they’re investigating further. More recalls could be on the way if other products are found to have the same issue.\nThis recall has been classified as Class 2, meaning there’s a moderate health risk—enough to be cautious, but not necessarily life-threatening.\nMike Kelly Founder of Victoria Buzz, Vancouver Island's fastest-growing local media outlet.

If he asks me, I say yes. President, with your help, with the fans behind [us] hosting the World Cup, all is possible,\" Pochettino said.\nDOD BRIEFLY TAKES DOWN ONLINE FEATURE ABOUT JACKIE ROBINSON'S MILITARY SERVICE, INCLUDES 'DEI' IN LINK\nPochettino recently noted the added pressure on his team for playing host.\n\"I think the pressure is going to be there, because we are a host. And then it's a country where the mentality is about winning. You know, in sport, in everything that Americans are involved in, they want to win,\" he said, via The Mirror. \"That is the culture. It's cultural. Of course, it's going to be a pressure, but a welcome one. That means that we are going to feel the adrenaline that we need to feel.\"\nIt's safe to assume that Trump will make an appearance at the World Cup, which will stretch roughly a month with games at 11 NFL stadiums; nine stadiums played host in 1994, where then-President Bill Clinton officially opened the tournament.\nTrump has been spotted at major sporting events since taking office, including Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans and the Daytona 500 on back-to-back Sundays last month.\nHe's often attended UFC events, with his last being at Madison Square Garden the week after he won the election. Trump will also be at the NCAA Division I wrestling championships in Philadelphia this week, and he attended the Army-Navy game in December.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nPochettino took over for Gregg Berhalter in September.\nFollow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.",

    "title": "$750 a month, no questions asked, improved the lives of homeless people",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES — If 100 homeless people were given $750 per month for a year, no questions asked, what would they spend it on? That question was at the core of a controlled study conducted by a San Francisco-based nonprofit and the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. The results were so promising that the researchers decided to publish results after only six months. The answer: food, 36.6%; housing, 19.5%; transportation, 12.7%; clothing, 11.5%; and health care, 6.2%, leaving only 13.6% uncategorized. Those who got the stipend were less likely to be unsheltered after six months and able to meet more of their basic needs than a control group that got no money, and half as likely as the control group to have an episode of being unsheltered. “I felt there was enough interest and the initial findings were compelling enough that it was important to get those results out,” said Benjamin Henwood, director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the Dworak-Peck School, who led the study. People are also reading… “It may not be earth-shattering that providing money is going to help meet basic needs, but I do think it dispels this myth that people will use money for illicit purposes,” Henwood said. “We weren’t finding that in the study.” About 2% of the total went to alcohol, cigarettes and drug expenses — the largest portion of which was cigarettes, Henwood said. The participants submit monthly reports on their spending and are surveyed in more detail quarterly. A follow-up report will be published after participants have received the funds for a full year. But Henwood said the main findings were robust enough that they were unlikely to change. The study arose from Miracle Messages, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that sends volunteers to the streets and shelters to befriend homeless people and try to make connections with the loved ones who lost contact with them. Next founder and chief executive Kevin F. Adler started Miracle Friends, matching homeless people to volunteer phone buddies for weekly calls. That evolved into Miracle Money when volunteers began asking Adler whether it was OK to give their buddies a few dollars. “You asked me to be a friend to this person, but they don’t know what they’re going to eat tonight,” Adler said they would tell him. Adler didn’t think the volunteers should hand out their own money. But the idea of cash support appealed to him. After a pilot showed promise, Adler got a grant to expand to Los Angeles. He hired two recruiters to canvass homeless shelters. They enlisted more than 200 clients who met the criteria of being at least 18 years old and homeless and expressed interest in having a phone buddy. Rather than just give money away, Adler hoped to document its effect. He teamed up with Henwood, who devised the controlled study. The participants were divided randomly into two groups. One group of 103 received stipends. The others were told they were on a waiting list. After six months, only 12% of those who received funds reported being unsheltered at any time in the prior month, a dramatic decrease from 30% at the outset. Those on the waiting list also reported fewer unsheltered episodes, but by a much smaller margin, from 28% to 23%. The cash recipients also said they were better able to meet their basic needs. On a scale of 1 (completely) to 5 (not at all), they dropped from about 3.75 on average to just over 3.25. The control group did not budge from 3.75. Among those receiving the funds, some found permanent housing, even though the money fell far below average rents in the area, Henwood said. “It seems like it’s opening up possibilities in different ways,” he said. “They might have a friend or relative that may not be willing to support them completely, but if they have something to contribute that opens up a room.” In other cases, the money created opportunities, even for people who remained unsheltered. “I spent a lot of the money on food on the go,” one participant told the researchers. “Simple, cheap things like bean and cheese burritos. I eat on the run while I bike/work for DoorDash. I also bought a membership to REI, so I could get my bike fixed for free.” “It’s not a single path forward,” Henwood said. “It’s a lot of resourcefulness and creativity.” 20 facts about homelessness in the US According to HUD, there were 582,462 people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. in January 2022 The U.S. has seen a 0.3% increase in homelessness since 2020 Conversely, the U.S. has seen an 8.6% decrease in homelessness since 2010 Experts from HUD believe that resources from the American Rescue Plan directed toward homelessness assistance lessened the impact of COVID-19 on homelessness As of August 2022, one year after the federal eviction moratorium was lifted, nearly 12% of Americans experienced a rent increase of $250 or more per month The marked increase in rental prices during COVID-19 likely contributed to the recent rise in homelessness HUD's Emergency Rental Assistance program received more than 12 million applications for assistance between August 2021 and January 2022 A greater proportion of people experiencing homelessness were unsheltered in 2022 compared to 2020 40% of all people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. during 2022 were unsheltered Chronic homelessness has increased 15.5% since 2020 Veteran homelessness has decreased by 11% since 2020 and more than 50% since 2010 Family and youth homelessness have both decreased since 2020 50,767 families with children experienced homelessness in 2022 Since 2020, unaccompanied youth homelessness has decreased by 12% 6,398 parenting youth taking care of 7,898 children experienced homelessness in 2022, down 13% since 2020 In 2022, 37% of people experiencing homelessness identified as Black, while only 12% of the overall U.S. population identifies as Black From 2020 to 2022, the number of people who identified as Hispanic or Latino who experienced homelessness rose by 8% The number of people who identify as Hispanic and experienced unsheltered homelessness in 2022 rose 16% since 2020",

    "title": "Elgin to big boost with 41 new full- and part-time city employees",
    "text": "Dec 29, 2023 at 3:25 pm Expand With the city of Elgin committing to reopening Lords Park pool this summer, money has been budgeted to hire a new aquatics supervisor. (Elgin Parks and Recreation / HANDOUT) Adding 42 full- and part-time jobs to the Elgin payroll, including six new police officers and a management analyst, is going to have a big impact on city services in the coming year, a city spokeswoman said. “The positions approved in the city’s 2024 adopted budget reflect the community’s desire for maintaining high levels of public safety, parks and recreation amenities, cultural arts and special events programming, and business development,” said Edell Fiedler, director of communications and engagement. Advertisement Of the 31 new full-time posts, nine are designated for the Elgin Police Department, where for the second consecutive year they’ll be hiring six new officers in addition other employees, she said. “The police department has been operating at less than its authorized strength of 190 officers since 2008, employing about 180 sworn personnel since then despite the city’s increasing geographic footprint and population,” Fiedler said. Advertisement Once the new officers are on board, the total number of sworn personnel will be 195, she said. The department also is hiring two tech specialists to manage and maintain the city’s camera system and support surveillance and criminal investigations, among other duties, and a new community outreach specialist will help implement and expand programs for adults leaving the criminal justice system for civilian life, Fiedler said. Another department to be bolstered by new staff is parks and recreation, which plans to hire a parks planner and an aquatics supervisor in addition to filling 11 part-time positions. The new parks planner, a post Elgin hasn’t had since 2008, will be charged with getting a handle on the significant park infrastructure maintenance backlog, establishing park standards and assisting in the implementation of the Parks Master Plan, according to details in the budget. An additional aquatics supervisor is needed because the Lords Park Family Aquatic Center will be reopening next year. The water department will be hiring a new assistant superintendent, and four other positions are being added to meet the demands of the lead service line replacement project, Fiedler said. Three new roles are being created in the city manager’s office: a management analyst, a grants specialist and a sustainability coordinator. The management analyst will help implement Elgin’s strategic plan with a focus on housing and homeless initiatives. The grants specialist will be responsible for researching and applying for grants to help fund projects. And the sustainability coordinator’s job will be to create and implement a Climate Action Plan while promoting sustainability efforts. Advertisement The budget, available on the city’s website, outlines each position and its duties. Other new positions are: An additional Human Resources employee will oversee the city’s hiring processes and provide day-to-day support for HR needs. An assistant purchasing director will be hired to manage supplier diversity, contracts and purchasing efficiency. A property maintenance inspector will focus on enhancing the safety, compliance and aesthetic appeal of commercial properties to support economic growth and create a secure environment for businesses and visitors. A new position overseeing training is being created for the Elgin Fire Department. A programming manager and events manager for the cultural arts and special events department will help organize the additional events being funded through an increase in funding approved this year by the Elgin City Council.
