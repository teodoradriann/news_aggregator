[ANI](https://www.devdiscourse.com/ani-stories)| Updated: 30-12-2023 09:20 IST | Created: 30-12-2023 09:20 IST - Country: - India Expressing his joy over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Ayodhya, Shri Ram Janmabhoomi head priest Acharya Satyendra Das said on Saturday that the people of the state will be happy after seeing PM Modi in the temple town. Prime Minister Modi is slated to inaugurate an international airport in Ayodhya and the redeveloped Ayodhya railway station today. \"It is good that PM Narendra Modi is coming here and he will inaugurate the railway station and airport today. He will also hold a road show. People will be happy after seeing PM Modi in Ayodhya,\" Shri Ram Janmabhoomi, head priest, told ANI on Saturday. He further said that the airport would help people from abroad and across the country come to Ayodhya easily. Around 11.15 am, Prime Minister Modi will inaugurate the redeveloped Ayodhya railway station and flag off new Amrit Bharat and Vande Bharat trains. He will also dedicate several other railway projects to the nation. Around 12.15 pm, he will inaugurate the newly built Ayodhya airport. Around 1 pm, Prime Minister Modi will participate in a public programme during which he will inaugurate, delicate to the nation and lay the foundation stone of multiple development projects worth more than Rs 15,000 crore in the state. These include projects worth about Rs 11,100 crore for the development of Ayodhya and its surrounding areas and projects worth about Rs 4600 crore related to other projects across Uttar Pradesh. On Friday, PM Modi, in a post on X, stated, \"Our government is determined to develop world-class infrastructure, improve connectivity and preserve the rich heritage of Ayodhya, the city of Lord Shri Ram.

    "title": "Study: Electric School Bus Reliability, Cost-Effectiveness Stand Up in Montana Extreme Cold",
    "text": "A recent study conducted for the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) claims that electric school buses (ESBs) are not only viable but also advantageous in Montana’s harsh winter conditions.\nThe study published last September by clean energy nonprofit VEIC evaluated all 17 ESBs that are currently operating across six school districts: Bigfork, Billings, Clinton, East Helena, Fairfield, and Havre. The findings indicate significant fuel cost savings, reliable performance in subzero temperatures, and positive feedback from both drivers and transportation managers.\nA Montana DEQ spokesperson told School Transportation News the agency partially funded 11 of the 17 ESBs studied. The EPA Clean School Bus Program also provided funding.\nOne of the primary concerns regarding electric vehicles in Montana is their performance during severe winter weather. The study found that ESBs operated effectively even when temperatures dropped to 25 degrees below zero. While vehicle efficiency decreased by up to 40 percent in such extreme cold, the buses consistently met the required daily route distances. Notably, the study said ESBs demonstrated more reliable start-up performance compared to diesel buses, which often face challenges like fuel gelling in low temperatures.\nBrian Picariello, the principal consultant and clean transportation lead at VEIC, emphasized the efficiency of electric school buses in extreme weather.\n“One major takeaway from the study was that, on average, the electric school buses were almost four times more efficient than the diesel alternative,” he told STN. “The buses also had sufficient range to complete their assigned routes, even under extreme cold and hot conditions. In fact, during a significant cold front, the temperature dipped more than 20 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, and the diesel buses at one agency had to be taken out of service while the electric buses continued operation, albeit with a 30- to 40-percent range reduction.”\nHavre Public Schools near the U.S-Canada border launched its electric school bus program in late 2022, putting two Lion C electric buses into service by early 2023. Allen “Woody” Woodwick, the district’s fleet manager, said skepticism was high at the start of the program.\n“There was a lot of people that said you couldn’t run electrics up in Montana, so that was somewhat of a challenge,” Woodwick told Montana Public Radio earlier this month. “And it looks like we’ve been proving the simple fact is yes, we can.”\nHe shared with STN that the Lion ESBs “have been largely problem-free,” but he added that obtaining parts and service has been an ongoing issue, largely due to Havre’s remote location in north-central Montana.\n“The few service techs they had were nowhere near Montana. They were expecting to expand but other issues arose,” Woodrick continued. “So, we plan on running the buses as we have been and figure out the challenges as they come, and source our parts from the suppliers or manufacturers.”\nOther Montana school districts that participated in the study include Bigfork (one Lion C), Clinton (two Lion Cs) East Helena (one Lion C), Fairfield (three Lion Cs), and Billings (eight IC Bus CEs), with all buses deployed between January 2023 and January 2024.\nRelated: Lion Electric Defaults on Credit Repayment, Says It is Avoiding Bankruptcy\nThe transition to electric buses has also resulted in notable cost savings. Each ESB averaged $1,575 in annual fuel savings compared to traditional diesel buses. Additionally, maintenance costs are expected to decrease over time due to the simpler mechanics of electric drivetrains, which have fewer moving parts and do not require oil changes or exhaust system repairs, the study noted.\nHowever, the study highlighted that per-mile energy costs could vary, with fleets subject to utility demand charges seeing energy costs twice as high as those without such fees. This discrepancy emphasizes the role of local utility pricing structures in determining the overall cost-effectiveness of ESBs. According to VEIC’s full report, understanding these factors is critical for districts considering electrification.\nBeyond economic advantages, the adoption of electric buses contributes to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants. ESBs produce zero tailpipe emissions, leading to improved air quality for students and the community. Even when accounting for emissions from electricity generation, the overall environmental footprint of ESBs is significantly smaller than that of diesel buses.\nPicariello noted that even with the use of auxiliary diesel heaters in winter months, ESBs significantly reduced emissions compared to diesel buses.\n“The buses in this study with auxiliary heaters, maintained efficiency and range during winter months better than buses in previous studies,” he explained, citing the example of NREL’s 2022 report on electric transit buses in Duluth, Minnesota . “Although the significance was not assessed directly, it does seem likely that the auxiliary fuel heaters allowed the buses to continue operating efficiently at extreme temperatures compared to buses that use electric resistance elements for cabin heating.”\nMeanwhile, transportation managers and drivers have reported positive experiences with the new electric buses, according to the study. Drivers noted better acceleration and quieter operation, enhancing the overall transportation environment. Despite a slightly lower top speed compared to diesel buses, the performance of ESBs has met the daily operational needs of the districts.\nPicariello emphasized the enthusiasm among drivers and school managers.\n“We were also pleasantly surprised to hear how much drivers and school managers loved the experience once they were trained and got used to the new equipment,” he said. “It’s promising to hear that on-road performance across driving conditions met or exceeded that of internal combustion alternatives. It was also encouraging to hear all the folks who manage these fleets year after year would recommend them to other districts in the area.”",

    "text": "¡Adiós a las altas temperaturas! Concluyen ondas de calor Para lo que resta del año 2024 se espera que haya 'fresco' en Quintana Roo Para lo que resta del año no se prevé ondas de calor en la región, por el contrario, se espera un refrescamiento con la disminución de las temperaruras mínimas que se situarán por debajo de los 22 grados centígrados. Aunque las máximas seguirán sobrepasando los 30 grados, este no se disparará como en los meses anteriores, cuando provocaron incluso decesos por golpes de calor. Lo anterior, de acuerdo con Luis Antonio Morales Ocaña, meteorólogo de la Secretaría de Protección Civil Prevención de Riesgos y Bomberos de Solidaridad, significa temperaturas más agradables para la población. “Estamos entrando a una época del año que como ya se ha percibido, hay una ligera baja en las temperaturas, esto se deja ver en que tenemos mañanas más frescas y noches de la misma manera. Esto pasó a partir de que tuvimos el paso del huracán Milton hace algunos días”, dijo Morales Ocaña. Todavía en septiembre se percibían amaneceres con temperaturas mínimas de hasta 29 grados, lo que significó mucho calor para la región, la cual apenas estaba saliendo de la temporada de la canícula, la época de altas temperaturas más importantes del año. Además, durante la segunda quincena de octubre, se prevé la llegada del primer frente frío a la península de Yucatán., que impactará a Quintana Roo. “Esto traerá un refrescamiento agradable para la región, que impactará en Playa del Carmen y es porque ya nos estamos acercando a la época de los grandes frentes fríos en esta zona del planeta, que se dejará sentir bien en la última parte del año”, precisó. No obstante, Morales Ocaña dijo que pese a esta situación y por el cambio climático, no se descarta aún la formación de un ciclón tropical, aunque no con las características del huracán Milton o Beryl, que alcanzaron la categoría 5. “Entonces esto nos lleva a decir a la población que con estos cambios de temperaturas abriguen bien a los niños y a las personas adultas mayores para evitar enfermedades en el sistema respiratorio”, dijo Morales Ocaña.",

    "text": "JACUMBA HOT SPRING.- A pesar de las nuevas restricciones migratorias anunciadas por el presidente Joe Biden , la corriente de migrantes que buscan ingresar a los Estados Unidos continúa, desafiando los obstáculos y peligros del desierto californiano.\nLa situación en la frontera entre Estados Unidos y México ha sido un tema candente en la política estadounidense durante años, con diferentes administraciones lidiando con el aumento de la migración y las demandas de seguridad fronteriza. La llegada de Biden a la presidencia trajo consigo expectativas de cambios en las políticas migratorias, pero las recientes restricciones han generado un nuevo debate sobre cómo abordar el flujo migratorio.\nLee además GUERRA contra HAMÁS Israel toma control de corredor estratégico en la frontera entre Gaza y Egipto MIGRACIÓN Biden busca suspender solicitudes de asilo en la frontera, informa la Casa Blanca Según datos recientes, el número de cruces ilegales a lo largo de la frontera de 3.050 kilómetros alcanzó nuevos récords durante su gobierno, llegando a totalizar 10.000 en un único día en diciembre del año pasado. Aunque la cifra ha disminuido en los últimos meses, sigue siendo alta, lo que refleja la persistente demanda de migrantes por ingresar a los Estados Unidos en busca de una vida mejor.\nFreddy Sánchez, un guatemalteco de de 37 años, y su familia son solo un ejemplo de esto. Después de caminar durante horas bajo el ardiente sol, lograron entrar a territorio estadounidense aprovechando una brecha en la frontera, apenas un día después del anuncio de las restricciones. Para ellos, y para muchos otros, la posibilidad de trabajo y un futuro mejor supera cualquier barrera impuesta.\n\"Aunque digan que cierren fronteras, nunca se va a poder cerrar porque quiera o no, es una fuente de trabajo para muchas personas\", dijo Sánchez.\nAlex Román, un colombiano de 31 años que también cruzó el desierto, compartió esta determinación. A pesar de conocer las nuevas medidas, decidió seguir adelante, consciente del esfuerzo y el dinero invertido en su búsqueda de oportunidades en tierras estadounidenses.\n\"Pues había que sacarlo adelante. Porque todo el dinero que se invierte para venir a esta tierra ... como para ¿devolverse sin intentarlo?\", aseveró Román.\nLas restricciones de Biden, aunque buscan controlar el flujo migratorio y aliviar la presión en la frontera, han sido objeto de críticas por parte de diversos sectores. Algunos argumentan que estas medidas son necesarias para mantener la seguridad nacional y gestionar de manera efectiva la inmigración, mientras que otros las consideran inhumanas y contrarias a los valores de los Estados Unidos como país de acogida.\nA los pies del muro fronterizo, se congregan migrantes de diversas nacionalidades, todos con la esperanza de que sus casos sean escuchados y considerados. Aunque Biden haya firmado un decreto ejecutivo para restringir la entrada de solicitantes de asilo fuera de los puertos oficiales, la realidad en la frontera parece no haber cambiado. La cifra de migrantes aprehendidos sigue siendo alta, demostrando que las restricciones no han detenido el flujo migratorio.\nPara muchos, Estados Unidos sigue siendo la tierra prometida, el lugar donde pueden encontrar mejores oportunidades y una vida más segura. A pesar de los obstáculos y los riesgos, la búsqueda de un futuro mejor impulsa a miles de personas a enfrentar el desierto y los decretos restrictivos en su camino hacia el norte.\nFUENTE: Con información de AFP",

    "text": "New Delhi: India experienced its warmest October since 1901 with mean temperature recording 1.23 degrees Celsius above normal, the weather office said. It predicted a warmer November, giving no indication of the upcoming winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAddressing a press conference here, India Meteorological Department (IMD) Director General Mrityunjay Mohapatra attributed the warmer weather to the absence of western disturbances and influx of easterly winds due to active low pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mean temperature in October was recorded at 26.92 degrees Celsius, the warmest since 1901, against the normal of 25.69 degrees Celsius, Mohapatra said. The minimum temperature also clocked 21.85 degrees Celsius against the normal of 20.01 degrees Celsius for the country as a whole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"In north-western India, north-westerly winds are needed for lower temperatures. The monsoonal flow was also there that does not allow fall in temperature,\\\" Mohapatra said. He said the temperatures will continue to remain 2-5 degrees above normal in the north-western plains at least for the next two weeks, before a gradual decline towards normalcy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMohapatra said the weather office does not count November as a winter month. He said January and February are considered as winter months, while the hints of the cold weather are available in December.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the southern peninsula, the north-east monsoon is expected to bring above normal rainfall in November in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal, Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam, Rayalaseema, Kerala and Mahe and south interior Karnataka.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The above normal to normal rainfall is likely over most parts of the country except northwest India and some areas of central India,\\\" the weather office said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe delay in the onset of cold weather conditions could also be on account of the continued prevalence of the neutral El Nino conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The weather office said the probability forecast indicates a higher chance of La Nina conditions developing during November-December in a gradual manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"ENSO (El Nino–Southern Oscillation) conditions are slowly evolving towards the negative side and La Nina can set in by December,\\\" Mohapatra said, acknowledging that the weather forecasting agencies the world over have got their El Nino forecasts wrong this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the winter months, the La Nina causes a very cold wave-like jet stream to flow across Afghanistan, Iran and the Hindu Kush mountains. These strong and cold winds impact the degree of cold in India.",
