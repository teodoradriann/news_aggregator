    "title": "90 Day Fiancé: Is Jasmine Pineda's Boyfriend Matt Branis Bad News? (Leaving Gino Palazzolo Was A Mistake)",
    "text": "90 Day: The Last Resort star Jasmine Pineda is rumored to be dating a man named Matt Branis with whom she’s allegedly having a baby after her split with Gino Palazzolo. Jasmine and Gino met on a website where the Michigan resident Gino was looking for sugar babies. Jasmine started living off Gino’s money as she was fired from her teaching job in Panama, even though she also launched an OnlyFans to profit off her newfound fame. Getting together with Gino proved to be a blessing for Jasmine career-wise, but she wasn’t happy with how he treated her.\nJasmine came to the U.S. in 2023 to marry Gino. By the end of the year, Jasmine and Gino had parted ways, proving Jasmine did not marry him for love. The couple has now been pointing fingers at each other on social media, blaming each other for why their marriage fell apart without really revealing the real reason, who is Matt since it would spoil their storyline. Jasmine, who has soft-launched Matt on her Instagram, is now having to defend him and keep him safe from some pretty damaging rumors.\nHow Did Jasmine Meet Matt?\nWhere Did Jasmine & Matt's Relationship Start?\nIn May 2024, 90 Day Fiancé blogger 90dayfianceupdate shared some shocking information about Jasmine and Gino’s relationship status. What the blogger revealed suggested that Jasmine and Gino were lying to fans to be on the show since they had reportedly broken up much before they filmed 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? Tell All. As per the blogger, Jasmine met her current boyfriend Matt in Michigan in November 2023. The two went to the same Planet Fitness gym in Belleville. Jasmine and Matt allegedly had an affair, but Gino only found out about it in December 2023.\nDid Matt Convince Jasmine To Start An Open Relationship?\nWas It Matt's Idea All Along?\nJasmine and Matt pretended to be friends, which is why the innocent Gino didn’t suspect what was happening right under his nose. Gino and Jasmine filmed 90 Day Fiancé's: The Last Resort season 2 in March-April 2024. Matt was introduced as a friend that Jasmine was speaking to on call. Matt urged Jasmine to not give up on therapy as she cried about Gino and her having yet another argument. It looked like Matt was looking after Jasmine like a friend. He seemed to be wanting Jasmine not to end her marriage with Gino.\nIn the same season, Jasmine broached the topic of an open marriage while discussing intimacy issues with Gino. Jasmine was not getting physical attention from Gino and wondered if she could get it from someone else while still being married to Gino. However, it may have been Matt who convinced Jasmine to get Gino to agree to an open marriage. It meant that Jasmine could be with Matt without having to hide their relationship, and she could continue reaping the benefits of being Gino’s wife, such as demanding money from him whenever she wanted.\nMatt Is An Aspiring Actor\nIs Matt Using Jasmine To Become A Reality TV Star?\nMatt is supposed to be a mechanic by profession. Originally from Romania, it appears Matt used to own a garage in Michigan. However, 90dayfianceupdate discovered Matt’s LinkedIn profile and revealed details about Matt’s career. Matt mentioned that he was a student at Eastern Michigan University and listed “T of C contracting” as his place of work. However, the description said that Matt has been in the acting industry since 2007. He referred to himself as a “SAG eligible Actor” who was doing a 9-5 job in the Detroit entertainment industry.\n“I just want to make a living off of my acting, make a difference in this world, and drive fast cars.”\nIs Matt Using Jasmine To Be On TV?\nDid Matt Stalk Jasmine For A 90 Day Fiancé Gig?\nIn January 2024, a Reddit user Maggie_Returns posted a deleted a thread about Jasmine being allegedly abused by Matt. Blogger Shabooty shared a screenshot of the same which included an anonymous DM that alleged that Matt was “stalking” Jasmine from day one at the gym to get on the show. Matt will make his debut with 90 Day: The Last Resort season 2. Once Jasmine and Matt start officially dating, he will start his reality TV career by appearing in the next season of 90 Day: The Single Life, which the Michigan man has supposedly been filming with Jasmine.\nMatt & Jasmine Have Moved To Florida\nIs Matt Alienating Jasmine From Gino & His Family?\nJasmine and Matt could star in several seasons of 90 Day: The Single Life before they head to something like 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? like Big Ed Brown and Liz Woods, who did not have a visa storyline but still appeared in several seasons of the spin-off until their split. Interestingly, Jasmine and Matt have left their life in Michigan behind after having lived together for a year. Jasmine posts pictures of Michigan snow which are old to fool fans when she’s been spotted in Florida plenty of times by fans, even though there isn’t photographic evidence yet.\nMatt Is Reportedly Having A Baby With Jasmine\nMatt Is Making Sure Jasmine Won't Leave\nShabooty and George Mossey claim that Jasmine is pregnant, and that Gino is not the father. Jasmine is supposed to be seven months pregnant by now. Considering she is still with Matt; he has to be the father if the rumors are correct. The bloggers mentioned that Jasmine was going to announce her pregnancy during the 90 Day: The Last Resort season 2 Tell All that was filmed recently in New York. With Jasmine supposedly having his baby, Matt has made sure that she would never leave him. A baby also adds seriousness to their storyline.\nJasmine has again, not been photographed yet with a pregnant belly, so some viewers remain skeptical about the rumors. However, Jasmine’s face appears fuller in her recent pictures. She avoids showing her midsection in her pictures, videos, and even TikTok lives, where she wears baggy, loose clothes to hide her apparent baby bump. Jasmine’s next step might be to get married to Matt once she gets a divorce from Gino. However, amid the accusations of him allegedly mistreating her, it remains to be seen how long Matt can keep Jasmine by his side.\nMatt Gifted Jasmine An Expensive Car Amid Alleged Abuse Rumors\nMatt Is Trying Everything To Get Jasmine To Stay\nIt appears Matt has found a way to keep Jasmine happy amid rumors. Jasmine has been going out of her way to prove that Matt is not the man these rumors claim he is like. Since fans haven’t met Matt yet, they will have to either believe the bloggers or Jasmine. Jasmine recently posted a picture of her holding hands with Matt and calling him her support system. More importantly, Jasmine posted a picture of a pink car which she had been eyeing for a while. Matt seems to have gifted it to the 90 Day: The Last Resort star.\n90 Day: The Last Resort airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSource: 90dayfianceupdate/Instagram, 90dayfianceupdate/Instagram, Shabooty/Instagram, Shabooty/Instagram, 90 Day Fiancé/YouTube\nYour comment has not been saved\n90 Day: The Last Resort\n- Release Date\n- August 14, 2023\n- Network\n- TLC\n- Franchise(s)\n-\n90 Day Fiancé",

    "title": "Steelers' George Pickens (hamstring) ruled out for Week 16 showdown vs. Ravens - CBSSports.com",
    "text": "Getty Images For a third straight game, the Pittsburgh Steelers will be without their No. 1 receiver. George Pickens , who has missed the past two games with a hamstring injury, has been ruled out of Saturday's game against the Baltimore Ravens as he continues to work through the injury.\nPickens, who leads the Steelers with 55 receptions and 850 receiving yards, did not practice all week. He has not practiced since he sustained the injury during Pittsburgh's final practice prior to its Week 14 win over the Cleveland Browns .\nThe Steelers are 1-1 this season in games without Pickens, the team's leading receiver over the past three years. In Week 14, Pittsburgh's offense overcame a slow start before finding its rhythm in the third quarter of its 27-14 win over the Browns. Russell Wilson threw a pair of touchdowns passes in the second half after throwing for less than 50 yards in the first half.\nPittsburgh wasn't as fortunate last Sunday, however, as the offense scored just 13 points in a 14-point loss in Philadelphia. The Steelers gained just 163 yards, controlled the ball for just over 20 minutes and had just two possessions in the entire second half.\nWithout Pickens, the Steelers will need more production from fellow wideouts Van Jefferson and Calvin Austin III . the Steelers will also need more from a running game that rushed for just 56 yards on 17 carries against the Eagles .\nGeorge Pickens PIT • WR • #14 View Profile While they won't have Pickens, the Steelers will have star pass rusher T.J. Watt for Saturday as he was not given an injury designation. Watt practiced in full on Thursday after injuring his ankle near the end of last Sunday's loss to the Eagles.\nAlong with Pickens, backup quarterback Justin Fields (abdominal) is also out for Saturday's game. Safety DeShon Elliott (hamstring) is doubtful, while cornerback Donte Jackson (back) and defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi (groin) are questionable. Elliott, Jackson and Ogunjobi were limited practice participants on Thursday.\nOur Latest NFL Stories Broncos vs. Chargers picks, TNF odds, DFS advice, more CBS Sports Staff • 3 min read Week 16 NFL injury report: Latest on Smith, Mahomes Jeff Kerr • 7 min read Broncos vs. Chargers odds, Week 16 TNF expert picks CBS Sports Staff • 3 min read Chargers vs. Broncos odds, TNF model picks CBS Sports Staff • 4 min read Broncos vs. Chargers props: Bo Nix over 1.5 touchdowns CBS Sports Staff • 3 min read Agent's Take: Franchise tag projections, candidates Joel Corry • 7 min read Share Share Video Link copied!

    "text": "A yellow weather warning for rain and snow has been issued for much of Scotland on Saturday. The warning is in place from 8am until 3pm on Saturday and up to 25mm of rain is expected in lower levels of Scotland, according to the Met Office. A period of sleet and snow, turning to rain on Saturday, may lead to some flooding and travel disruption. Bus and train services may be affected, with journey times taking longer, with some spray and flooding on roads. Some interruption to power services is also likely. This week, Storm Gerrit caused travel disruption across the UK. Hundreds of homes in Scotland remain without power as the post-storm clean-up begins, but electricity bosses are “very confident” that the remaining properties will be reconnected on Friday. Travellers faced disruption across the rail network with operators urging passengers to check their journeys before setting off. Andy Page, Met Office chief forecaster, said: “Parts of the higher ground of Scotland may see temporary snow accumulations of 5-10cm (1-2in), while up to 25mm (just under 1in) of rain is expected in Wales, Northern Ireland and lower levels in Scotland. “Across Wales and southern England, wind gusts of 45-50mph are likely to be quite widespread, while gusts of 65-75mph are possible in the most exposed coastal areas.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "text": "Six killed, 15 injured in Nyeri-Nyahururu highway crash Six people have died while 15 others were injured in a road accident in Solio area on the Nyeri-Nyahururu highway. The Thursday 6pm accident involved a 14-seater matatu, a saloon car and a motorcycle. Confirming the incident to Nation.Africa, Kieni West Deputy Sub County Police Commander Bernard Muthomi said one of the motorists had swerved to avoid hitting a pothole when the accident occurred. \"The accident occurred in Solio area and six people died, 14 are seriously injured while one sustained minor injuries,\" Mr Muthomi said by phone. \"The driver of the saloon car was avoiding potholes on the highway and this is believed to have caused the accident,\" he added. He urged motorists to drive carefully during and after the festive season. Mr Stephen Ndegwa, an eyewitness and a regular motorist on the route, said the road had claimed the lives of many motorists and appealed to the government to fill the potholes. \"So many people have lost their lives along this bridge. It is a sharp bend and a very dangerous black spot at the entrance to Solio Ranch. Something should be done by the Kenya National Highway Authority to ensure the safety of most of us who use this road regularly,\" said Mr Ndegwa.",

    "text": "Inteligencia artificial crea música a través de Udio | Especial La inteligencia artificial generativa ha marcado un verdadero parteaguas en los últimos años en incontables áreas y disciplinas, aunque han sido productos como ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Midjourney o Dall.E, que en los últimos meses han acercado la IA a un público más amplió, permitiendo que la creatividad e imaginación de millones de personas, tenga nuevas herramientas que potencian la productividad para hacer distintas tareas. Las imágenes generadas con inteligencia artificial fueron el principio de una nueva manera de crear todo tipo de materiales visuales que solo existen en los servidores y algoritmos de la IA que los crea, pronto veremos más plataformas generadoras de videos hiperrealistas impulsadas por IA, pero un terreno donde estas tecnologías también han empezado a tener un fuerte impacto es el de la creación musical. Nueva forma de hacer música Udio es el nombre de una nueva plataforma de creación de música con inteligencia artificial, fundada por cuatro ex científicos de Google, quienes participaron en la creación del modelo de IA Deepmind, y que esta semana ha causado sensación a nivel global por la alta calidad de la creación de música no sólo instrumental, sino con letras detalladas en distintos idiomas. La interfaz de Udio es similar a la de otras plataformas de inteligencia artificial generativa, con un espacio donde el usuario escribe su prompt o descripción escrita del tipo de canción que quiere hacer, detallando el género músical, el idioma, los nombres que quiere que se mencionen si es el caso, estado de ánimo, temática o cualquier otro detalle que se incluya en la letra, luego el sistema genera dos versiones cortas de 32 segundos y las muestra al usuario. Respaldada por artistas La calidad de las letras es sin duda muy superior a otras plataformas que se han presentado anteriormente, no solo por la armonía o calidad de la música, sino también por las voces generadas por la IA que cantan con distintas entonaciones e incluso demuestran sentimiento al interpretar la canción. Udio ha sido respaldada por artistas como Will.i.am, de Black Eyed Peas y otros, en un momento donde se sigue discutiendo acerca de si este tipo de plataformas podrían eventualmente eliminar puestos de trabajo en distintas áreas, aunque la empresa asegura que no genera música que pudiera imitar de manera deliberada a artistas humanos y que su objetivo es potenciar la creatividad de cualquiera para crear música. Conviértete en productor musical Por el momento el sistema está en una versión Beta que no cobra por la generación de canciones, y las creaciones musicales se pueden ampliar hasta un minuto con 30 segundos, pero se espera que en las siguientes semanas den a conocer sus planes de cobro y lo que incluyen por utilizar la que hasta ahora, es una de las más impresionantes plataformas de IA para convertirte en todo un productor musical.
