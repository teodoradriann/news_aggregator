    "title": "Why Church Small Groups Don't Work",
    "text": "A pastor confesses that he can’t figure out how to make groups work. A popular author grabs a confession and says “See, small groups don’t work. You need to do it my way instead.” Another labels groups as a fad of the last decade. Another leader claims that small groups are small enough to care but not large enough to do anything. Then one of the most prominent churches that promoted small groups and developed an extensive network of churches for small group training is no longer doing groups. It seems like many people are jumping into the blog world to announce that their experience reveals why church small groups don’t work in America. They proclaim the demise of groups as if their point of view is the gospel truth. And the sad thing is that we embrace their limited point of view on small groups don’t work as if it is as valid as any other. Welcome to the post-modern world of flat information dissemination. Everyone is an expert. Or so it seems.\nBut we need to have something that helps us discern the elements of truth that these small group obituaries contain and try to understand why church small groups don’t work in these specific situations.\nWhy Church Small Groups Don’t Work The truth is that groups don’t often work in America. But that does not mean that they can’t work. We have to do the hard work of trying to figure out why church small groups don’t work. Please understand that reasons I will state are not so much about strategies as much as they are about how we approach our strategies. Here’s the first:\nReason #1 that Groups Don’t Work: Fad Hopping\nThe leadership of the church moves on to other emphases. When groups were the hot fad and big churches were promoting them and writing new books on why we should develop groups, it was easy to embrace them as central to church life. But when the excitement wanes, leadership moves on to something else that claims to be able to turn a church around. I recently learned that one of the flagship small group churches in North America, one that hosted annual conference on groups and even started an organization to help other churches develop groups, no longer emphasize home cell groups.\nRELATED: Ways to Guarantee Your Small Group Will Fail\nI have seen many churches in America fail at groups because they saw them as a fad and then moved on to other things that promised greater results. Sadly, in the 1990s and early 2000s, many were promoting groups as the best way to grow the church, including yours truly. And many jumped on this bandwagon because they thought that they could enter into the land of success. And when that did not pan out like they expected, they jumped on the next one that passed by.\nGroups work! And they can be done, even in America, in a way that brings growth. But they work and grow because we invest in them over the long haul. They are not a magic formula for church growth and health. They are not a fad. Far from it. For the last 50-60 years, the American church has seen about four or five waves of interest in groups.\nReason #2: Boredom with the Mundane Church leaders are not usually that good at embracing the mundane. We want results and we want them yesterday. We want something that makes for good testimonies, something that has what they call “sizzle” in the marketing world. After all we are accustomed to building churches on sizzle. In the old days, we had revival meetings, then meetings, and sing-alongs. Then we created seeker-services with all the excellence we could muster. Now we have multi-site with annual growth numbers that are staggering.\nLong-term small group success lacks this sizzle that we so eagerly long for. It has little fan fare. Small groups work when leaders operate like shepherds. They do the under-ground, consistent, steady work of caring for the sheep. That is hard to promote and measure. It’s different from developing programs in the church which can be seen and measured as we build buildings, develop budget-dependent programs and attract more and more people to a centralized venue. Small group ministry happens without such clear sizzle.\nSuch long term success cannot be promoted, inspired or programmed. It’s a little like my farm experience as a kid. My father did not go out and inspire the cattle, sheep, chickens, rabbits, etc. to eat, grow, have babies, and do what they were supposed to do. He did not promote, strategize, develop mission statements, motivate, etc. He did not do all the things that we are told that we must do to be good leaders in the church.\nInstead he was an environment creator. He focused his work the factors that contributed to a setting where the animals could naturally flourish. And to be honest, it is boring, mundane, repetitive, inconvenient, sacrificial, long, hard work. There are no short cuts to environment creation and maintenance. But when farmers do create the right environments, the animals do what they are supposed to do.\nThe reason why small groups flourish is when there are leaders who know how to do the mundane work of establishing and supporting environments for growth. May the Lord teach us what this looks like.\nLearn two more reasons why church small groups don’t work on Page Two Reason #3: Hiring Program Administrators We hire program administrators to run the small group ministry instead of hiring shepherds who will do the mundane, repetitive work of caring for sheep. The reason why small groups can work is an effective small group pastors possess strengths that allow them to focus their energies on caring for people, developing leaders and gathering people around a vision.\nI’m not sure that this is something that comes that easily for those of us who have been in church leadership for any length of time. Our traditional church structures have depended upon those who are good orators and those who are good program administrators. It does not take long to see this when we assess the average M.Div. program. And look at the most popular books that target pastors. The bestsellers speak to the issue of vision development skills, leadership aptitude and communication skills.\nI hope that I am wrong, but my observations on why small groups don’t work have caused me to conclude that we under-value those who are gifted as shepherds, those who take joy in coming alongside groups, mentoring leaders and dealing with difficult pastoral situations. Instead we hire program administrators who know how to track growth, run budgets, organize curriculum, manage the small group calendar and read reports. They know how to run the small group program but they don’t have the strength set that focuses on investing in group life, developing new leaders, sharing life with multiple groups in an area, dealing with group conflict and eating meals with people under their care.\nReason #4: Design Flaws Design principles guide the work of architects so they can build sound structures. Architects and structural engineers don’t copy the work of others verbatim. Every building is unique, depending upon many factors including the terrain upon which it is built. If the architect is not equipped in sound design principles, then he will be forced to copy and thereby build something that might not fit the situation at hand.\nIf we apply this analogy to a small group structure, then we need to identify a few things in very clear terms:\nFirst we need clear small group design principles. There are many good books and blog sites that are available to equip us all in designing good small group structures.\nSecond, we need architects who are able to apply these design principles to local contexts. In other words, an architect is not one who develops a structure that looks like what is written about in other books. An architect is one who designs a structure that fits the needs of the environment.\nThird, we need builders who can build the structure that has been designed. Most architects are not good builders and most builders are not adept at the creative thinking required to apply sound design principles to specific situations.\nFourth, we need maintainers who can keep the small group system working right. This is where the role of the pastoral shepherds comes into play. See this post .\nThe problem regarding why church small groups don’t work has been three-fold. First, most churches don’t think about the need for these roles when developing or growing groups. Therefore depending upon the personalities and strengths of the people involved (either staff or volunteer) they will focus on one of the roles. Usually, I find that churches will focus on the role of the “builder.”\nThe second problem related to why church small groups don’t work is that most churches cannot afford to address all of these needs.\nProblem number three is that there are fewer people who are wired with the strengths to play the role of small group architect or designer. I’ve had to learn this the hard way. I have tried to force myself into the role of a maintainer and a builder because that’s the role I assumed I needed to play. I’ve done both for a while, but I was never that good at it. Now I see that I am an architect, a creative designer who applies small design principles to specific situations. Honestly, I rarely find many who are wired with these propensities. And when I do find someone like this, they are in very large churches and they work with people who are builders and maintainers.\nMost often, a leader who is a builder or a maintainer will buy a few books on small groups and then do the work of building or maintaining groups. This is true because we always do a job or a role in a way that fits our strengths or tendencies. A builder builds and a maintainer maintains, even if the situation calls for something else.\nAs a result, the group system that a church develops might very well have design flaws, even if they follow the instructions laid out in various books. Most of the time, churches need architects to come alongside the builders and maintainers in a local context and to help them apply the design principles in a way that fits the local situation thereby eliminating these design flaws as much as possible.\nIn most cases, an small group designer is only needed for a short time. Sometimes, he or she plays the role of a consultant. Sometimes a trainer. Sometimes that of a coach who walks alongside for a year or two. Good architects in the construction world are expensive, but you don’t want to skimp on the design. You will always pay more for fixing the flaws than you would if you had a good plan up front. The same it true for small group designs. You can go the cheap route and buy a book and start building. But you will most likely end up paying the price down the road, usually in the form of people getting hurt.\nRELATED: Small Group Innovation\nOnce you understand why church small groups don’t work, find a good small group designer and get the help you need to establish a good design for your church. You want someone who is able to help you develop something local, something that fits your situation. You don’t want to just have someone come in and layout a universal plan that they give to everyone. Also note that different designers specialize in different things. Do your homework and find one that can provide the kind of design that you need.\nThis article on why church small groups don’t work originally appeared here , and is used by permission.",

    "title": "Segundo día de huelga municipal en San Isidro | El gremio local recibe apoyo de la federación bonaerense y la confederación nacional | Página|12",
    "text": "Con fuertes críticas al Ejecutivo local, los trabajadores municipales de San Isidro se movilizarán este viernes hasta el palacio municipal para visibilizar su reclamo en el segundo día de paro consecutivo. Hasta allí comprometieron su presencia el titular de la federación bonaerense, Rubén “Cholo” García y el de la confederación nacional, Hernán Doval .\nLos trabajadores municipales de San Isidro transitan desde el jueves un paro de 48 horas, el primero de estas características desde el regreso de la democracia. Además del reclamo salarial, de treinta más veinticinco para compensar la pérdida de poder adquisitivo de este año, piden que el intendente reconozca una serie de medidas no presupuestarias que habían acordado conjuntamente, pero que Ramón Lanús se niega a implementar.\n“Nuestra intención es que se garanticen los servicios mínimos esenciales, pero la verdad es que hay tanto enojo por parte de los trabajadores con el intendente, que no estamos seguros de que se vayan a cubrir”, comentó Omar Arce , el titular del Sindicato de Trabajadores Municipales de San Isidro (Stmsi) , en diálogo con Buenos Aires/12.\n“Desde hace dos semanas venimos recorriendo cada sector, cada repartición, realizando reuniones y asambleas de trabajadores. Ahí presentamos distintas opciones de medidas, de paros rotativos, brazos caídos y retención de tareas, pero en general, nos encontramos que los trabajadores quieren ir directamente al paro. Además del atraso salarial, pesa mucho el destrato y la indiferencia del intendente respecto de nuestra problemática”, explica el dirigente, que encabeza su gremio desde 2016 y nunca vivió este nivel de conflictividad.\nDesde marzo pasado, el sindicato había comenzado a trabajar en una serie de propuestas de modificaciones no presupuestarias . \"Por ejemplo, que los barrenderos trabajen de lunes a viernes en en vez de lunes a sábados, por la misma plata, para que les quede al menos un día para hacer changas y complementar ingresos, pero el intendente nos mandó a decir que está muy bien, pero recién lo va a implementar el año que viene\", explica.\nPara encontrar una medida similar, por el grado de acatamiento, por la duración y visibilidad, hay que remontarse a fines de 1988 , cuando el sindicato organizó una olla popular frente al palacio, que terminó durando cinco días.\nEl Stmsi realizó un cálculo sencillo hace algunos meses. En el tiempo transcurrido hasta entonces de la gestión Lanús, las tasas habían aumentado 200 puntos y los salarios apenas 55. “¿Dónde está la diferencia?”, se preguntaban y los vecinos, molestos, se hicieron eco rápidamente del planteo.\n“Creo que no nos perdonan eso, pero lo hicimos porque casi todos nosotros somos, además de trabajadores, contribuyentes de San Isidro, a diferencia de ellos\", cuenta y agrega que \"salvo Lanús y un par más, el resto tienen domicilio en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires y en Pilar”.\nLos motivos del enojo son múltiples. Uno de los principales son los aumentos por decreto, definidos de manera unilateral y arbitraria . La modalidad preferida de Lanús es similar a la que empleó durante casi todo este año el intendente de General Pueyrredón, Guillermo Montenegro , también del PRO. Finalmente, Montenegro no pudo con la resistencia del sindicato local, que encabeza Antonio Ghilardi y contó con amplio apoyo de la Fesimubo, y se vio obligado a mejorar la oferta salarial.\n“Cuando me enteré de que habían asignado un aumento por decreto les advertí que no era legal y que se exponían a una sanción por parte del tribunal de cuentas. Primero me ignoraron, pero dos semanas después vinieron a pedirme la firma retroactiva para convalidar el aumento”.\nEl diagnóstico de Arce sobre la nueva gestión es muy duro. “H ay una suerte de inmadurez administrativa , tienen un profundo desconocimiento del manejo del municipio, pero además están mal asesorados y reaccionan tarde, duermen\", dice y ejemplifica: \"El miércoles a última hora presentaron un pronto despacho reclamando la conciliación obligatoria, cuando la medida está anunciada hace días”.\nArce tiene como interlocutores habituales al secretario de gobierno José Sánchez Sorondo y la jefa de gabinete Manuela López Menéndez , a quienes les reconoce voluntad de diálogo y negociación. “El problema es que cada vez que llegamos a un acuerdo, ellos se lo llevan al intendente y tira todo para atrás”, dice.\n“Mi mayor preocupación es qué vamos a hacer el lunes , porque después de una medida como esta, debería haber una reunión urgente, pero este Ejecutivo tiene una mirada muy particular de las cosas\", comenta Arce que se lamenta por no tener \"con quien tirar una pared\". \"El lunes los trabajadores me van a pedir explicaciones: ¿qué ofrecieron? ¿nada? ¿entonces qué hacemos? parece que quieren escalar el conflicto en vez de resolverlo, nos empujan a un paro por tiempo indeterminado ”, advierte.\nEl enojo de los trabajadores, aunque por otros motivos, alcanza también al possismo, que gobernó el distrito ininterrumpidamente desde 1983, primero con Melchor Posse y luego con su hijo Gustavo . Al ex intendente le recriminan no haber acompañado la transición con los funcionarios entrantes durante un tiempo prudencial, como se habían comprometido a hacer ante el sindicato.\nLa posición oficial El área de comunicación del municipio sostiene, a través de un comunicado, que \"la negativa, por parte del Gobierno de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, a dictar conciliación obligatoria es puramente política y promueve el conflicto gremial en San Isidro, por tratarse de un distrito que no lo vota”.\nEn esa dirección, agrega: \"Todo apunta al Ministro de Trabajo de Axel Kicillof , Walter Correa , quien se ha negado a dictar la conciliación obligatoria frente a un reclamo salarial de los trabajadores que venía encausado a través del diálogo del Municipio con sus empleados. No es casualidad que Correa haya participado el sábado pasado en un acto en el distrito con el sindicalismo local. El paro es puramente político, promovido por el kirchnerismo quien negó la conciliación obligatoria, afectando a los vecinos por tratarse de un distrito que no los vota”.\nhttps://twitter.com/LuisCaputoAR/status/1834270682676420878 Este jueves, el intendente Lanús estuvo reunido con el ministro Luis Caputo , que lo felicitó a través de su cuenta en la red social X. \"El intendente de San Isidro decidió eliminar la tasa vial de 6 pesos por litro de combustible. Mientras algunos intendentes se quejan, otros gestionan\".",
