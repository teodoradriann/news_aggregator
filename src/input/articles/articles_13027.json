    "title": "Noche de auroras boreales que se han dejado ver en Córdoba",
    "text": "Durante la pasada noche, el cielo de diferentes puntos de España se ha teñido de colores debido a las auroras boreales que se han producido en diferentes lugar del país, como ha sido el norte de la provincia de Córdoba. Durante estos fenómenos, el óvalo auroral se ensancha temporalmente, lo que permite percibir auroras desde latitudes más bajas. Así lo ha dejado constar la astrofotógrafa Ana Moya Fernández, que ha difundido algunas de las imágenes captadas en Los Pedroches y en localidades como Villanueva de Córdoba. Pero, ¿qué es una aurora boreal? Según informa la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet), se trata de un electrometeoro consistente en un fenómeno luminoso que aparece en las capas superiores de la atmósfera en forma de arcos, bandas, cortinas, etc. Por lo tanto, al contrario que los fenómenos meteorológicos habituales, se forman mucho más arriba de la troposfera, normalmente a una altitud de entre 90 y 150 km.\nAurora Boreal en Los Pedroches. Ana Moya Fernández Las auroras aparecen por la interacción entre el viento solar y el campo magnético de la Tierra. El viento solar es más fuerte en momentos cercanos a la máxima actividad solar, que se produce en ciclos de entre 10 y 12 años.\nSegún la Organización Meteorológica Mundial, las auroras polares se deben a la presencia de partículas cargadas eléctricamente y eyectadas desde el sol (el viento solar), que actúan sobre los gases enrarecidos de las capas superiores de la atmósfera. El campo magnético de la Tierra canaliza las partículas, principalmente electrones y protones, que colisionan con los átomos y moléculas de los gases de las capas superiores de la atmósfera (termosfera y exosfera).\nEsas colisiones provocan que los electrones de los átomos de nitrógeno y de oxígeno asciendan temporalmente a un estado energético superior. Al recuperarse los niveles de energía normales, se libera energía que se emite en forma de fotones de luz con distintas longitudes de onda. Las auroras polares se observan principalmente en arcos próximos a los polos magnéticos (los óvalos aurorales).",

    "title": "Ram Temple Inauguration BJP Event Not National, Says Sanjay Raut",
    "text": "\"Shiv Sena workers shed their blood for this temple,\" Sanjay Raut said (File) Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday said the inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on January 22 was a \"BJP event\" and not a national one. He was responding to a query on whether Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray would take part in the idol consecration ceremony scheduled on that day. \"Uddhav Thackeray will definitely go but only after the BJP's event gets over. Why should one go to a BJP event? It is not a national event. The BJP is holding rallies and campaigning a lot for this function but where is the purity in it,\" Mr Raut said. When the BJP decides to undertake a campaign, it deploys its entire machinery and party workers and does not leave any scope for error, Mr Raut claimed, adding the ruling party follows the same pattern nationwide. \"The BJP wants the country to forget about unemployment, inflation, and issues concerning Manipur,\" the Rajya Sabha MP alleged. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com \"Shiv Sena workers shed their blood for this temple. Thousands of Sainiks were part of kar seva. (Party founder) Balasaheb Thackeray visited Ayodhya along with workers,\" Raut said underlining his party's strong connection to the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.

    "text": "Motorists have been warned to be aware of common mistakes which could leave them uninsured this winter.\nPrice comparison experts from Quotezone.co.uk believe thousands of UK drivers could be invalidating their car insurance policies by simply not knowing these winter motoring essentials.\nCommon steps like installing winter tyres to make a vehicle safer on icy roads could be against the terms and conditions on certain insurance policies.\nThe experts are urging all drivers to check their policies and make sure they are driving in line with their\ninsurance providers terms.\nOther mistakes which could lead to invalidated claims are overloading a vehicle, wearing winter boots or failing to slow down on icy roads.\nQuotezone.co.uk Founder Greg Wilson said, “Unfortunately, there are lots of cold weather mistakes which could lead to invalidated policies that are perhaps unknown by motorists.\n“The terms and conditions are so important yet 39% of motorists admit to never reading them in full. We want to\nwarn motorists to check their policies and make sure they are following winter recommendations. The last thing any driver needs in January is to break the conditions of their insurance contract and leave themselves vulnerable.\n“It could simply be due to failing to inform their insurer of new winter tyres being installed, or more serious offences like failing to drive with caution during turbulent weather or wearing the wrong footwear to drive.”\nHere are Quotezone.co.uk’s factors which could leave drivers uninsured this winter\nOverloading your vehicle\nIf you overload your car with too many people or bags of luggage, you could find it difficult to make a claim if you have an accident. If your car is too heavy, essential car systems, tyres and suspension all have to work overtime due to the pressure.\nWearing winter boots\nDrivers may find themselves unable to\nclaim on their insurance if they are found to have been wearing inappropriate footwear at the time of an accident.\nThis is because footwear can have a big impact on driving. Wearing large winter boots or shoes and wellies covered in snow could be noted as inappropriate. This could cause\ninsurance companies to refuse claims. Make sure to always have an extra pair of suitable shoes for driving in your car this winter.\nFailing to slow down on icy roads\nCareless driving is often the cause for collisions on UK roads. Driving too fast or irresponsibly at the time of an accident could give insurers reason to invalidate claims and refuse to pay out.\nDuring the colder months, drivers need to be aware of how to drive appropriately in icy or snowy conditions in order to avoid accidents where possible and stay within the law.\nFrost and ice on roads can cause vehicles to slide, skid and aquaplane, putting themselves and other vehicles at danger.\nDriving too quickly on roads in these conditions puts your\nvehicle at more risk of needing costly repairs, which could be very difficult if your insurance provider determines you were failing to follow their terms and conditions and the rules of the road.\nInstalling winter tyres\nDuring the colder months, many motorists aim to make their vehicle safer for the conditions by installing winter tyres. These are designed to be heavier duty in the winter, to achieve better handling and shorter braking distances.\nHowever, some car insurance companies could invalidate the insurance if they weren’t informed about changes to the vehicle.",

    "text": "MOUNTAIN HOME, Ark. (KY3) - Members of the Mountain Home, Ark. Bomber Football team didn’t spend Thursday practicing new plays, instead, they played a role in helping their community clean up from May’s EF-3 tornado. “Very humbling. Just to see these guys come out here. They showed up early and just absolutely killed it,” Marshall Bockman, whose property was heavily damaged by the tornado, said. The team, including both players and coaches, helped Bockman pick up debris across his property. “Hands on the ground. Piling in areas. I’ll bring equipment in to follow up after they leave, where we can safely remove it from the property,” Bockman explained. For Junior Caden Delsoto, he says before the tornado, the team had already decided to volunteer more, and this was a great opportunity to do so. “We wanted more volunteer hours and to really build our community, so we decided to come out and help people who needed help, and in this case, it was cleaning up debris left by the tornado,” Delsoto stated. The reason why? To give back to the community that supports his team throughout the year. “We have an amazing community. Amazing people support us. When we get the opportunity to support people when we can, it’s always good to take the chance,” Delsoto said. While Thursday’s help from the team was great assistance to those hit, Coach Steve Ary said it’s also a learning moment for his players. “These guys have been leaders of their community on down the road. They need to learn to take care of it. Be invested in it. All those things are going to make sure they’re good citizens on down the road,” Ary explained. The property owner said with so much happening within the last month, it’s nice to see something positive. “Just to see these young men, they’re not kids, they’re young men. Just to see that. It lifts me up. I don’t have a lot of wins every day,” Bockman added. To report a correction or typo, please email [digitalnews@ky3.com](mailto:digitalnews@ky3.com) Copyright 2024 KY3.

    "text": "Nearly two years ago, Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine unified European nations, reinvigorated the trans-Atlantic alliance and forged a spirit of rare bipartisanship in Washington. Now that resolve is fraying.\nPresident Joe Biden’s administration and the European Union are struggling to deliver aid for Ukraine’s military and budget, with even some of the country’s staunchest supporters expressing doubts about its battlefield prospects and calling for negotiations to end the war.\nThis frustration is perhaps understandable, but it’s misguided. It ignores the enormous sacrifices Ukraine’s people have made to defend their freedom and push back against Russian aggression — and underestimates the ability of Ukraine’s military to regain the advantage, if given sufficient weaponry. Abandoning the war effort now would wreck the West’s credibility and ultimately endanger the democracies supporting Ukraine’s defense as much as Ukraine itself.\nIt’s true that Ukraine’s forces failed to advance this year as much as leaders inside and outside the country had hoped for. Russia’s defensive capabilities and willingness to absorb huge casualties have proved formidable, as was its latest missile strike on Ukraine. And while there is much finger-pointing between Ukraine and the West about tactics and decision-making, the supply of weaponry was too little and too late to match the ambitions of the counteroffensive.\nAcknowledging these shortcomings is very different from defeatism. The answer isn’t to do less. Putin shows no interest in negotiations or any history of abiding by agreements he’s made. He has every reason to wait for US and European resolve to collapse so that he can complete his objective of subjugating Ukraine. The West must adapt its response to provide more sustainable support over the long term.\nWhat should that entail? In the coming months, providing additional ammunition, long-range missiles, air-defense systems, drones and fighter aircraft will remain essential. Without the continued flow of Western arms, Ukraine will be unable to hold onto the territory it controls, let alone seize more. At the same time, the US and Europe should ramp up Ukraine’s own ability to produce weapons by providing incentives for joint ventures with Ukrainian defense companies to build drone factories, anti-mining equipment and other defense-industrial capacities.\nUkraine also needs renewed budgetary support, which should be tied to continued demands on Ukraine’s government for transparency and reform. The EU’s decision to start the long process of membership talks with Ukraine and Moldova sends the right message of commitment. Meanwhile, the West should tighten sanctions against Russia and build better enforcement mechanisms to strengthen the price cap on Russian oil and block the Kremlin’s ability to import dual-use technologies.\nDemocratic leaders must also do a better job of communicating at home. It bears repeating that Putin’s invasion is a wholly unprovoked war in which the intention is conquest, prosecuted through deliberate attacks on civilian centers and chillingly documented war crimes.\nHowever daunting the challenges faced by Ukraine and its partners in the year ahead, failure isn’t an option.\nBloomberg Opinion/Tribune News Service\nEditorial cartoon by Gary Varvel (Creators Syndicate)",

    "text": "Bug That Showed Violent Content in Instagram Feeds is Fixed, Says Meta\nUsers report that even with content filters enabled, they saw inappropriate violent content in their Reels feeds.\nMeta, the parent company of Instagram, apologized on Feb. 27 for violent, graphic content some users were seeing on their Instagram Reels feeds. Meta attributed the problem to an error that the company says has been addressed.\n\"We have fixed an error that caused some users to see content in their Instagram Reels feed that should not have been recommended,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement provided to CNET. \"We apologize for the mistake.\"\nMeta went on to say that the incident was an error unrelated to any content-policy changes the company has made. At the start of the year, Instagram made some significant changes to its user and content-creation policies, but these changes didn't specifically address content filtering or inappropriate content appearing on feeds.\nMeta made its own content-moderation changes more recently and has dismantled its fact-checking department in favor of community-driven moderation. Amnesty International warned earlier this month that Meta's changes could raise the risk of fueling violence.\nRead more: Instagram May Spin Off Reels As a Standalone App, Report Says\nMeta says that most graphic or disturbing imagery it flags is removed and replaced with a warning label users must click through to view the imagery. Some content, Meta says, is also filtered for those under 18. The company says it develops its policies around violent and graphic imagery with the help of international experts and that refining those policies is an ongoing process.\nUsers posted on social media and on message boards including Reddit about some of the unwanted imagery they saw on Instagram, presumably due to the glitch. They included shootings, beheadings, people being struck by vehicles, and other violent acts.\nBrooke Erin Duffy, a social media researcher and associate professor at Cornell University, said she's unconvinced by Meta's claims that the violent-content issue was unrelated to policy changes.\n\"Content moderation systems — whether powered by AI or human-labor — are never failsafe,\" Duffy told CNET. \"And while many speculated that Meta's moderation overhaul (announced last month) would create heightened risks and vulnerabilities, yesterday's 'glitch' provided firsthand evidence of the costs of a less-restrained platform.\"\nDuffy added that while moderating social-media platforms is a difficult task, \"platforms moderation guidelines have served as safety mechanisms for users, especially those from marginalized communities. Meta's replacement of its existing system with a 'community notes' feature represents a step backward in terms of user protection.\"",
