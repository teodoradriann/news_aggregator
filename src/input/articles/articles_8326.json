    "title": "New DNA analysis of Pompeii victims reveals shocking truth about who they really were",
    "text": "New DNA evidence from bodies buried in Pompeii is rewriting narratives about the people who lived there.\nThe volcanic eruption of AD 79 and the 20-foot-deep layer of ash and sediment it released provided the right conditions to capture dozens of bodies in their dying state.\nArchaeologists used these impressions to create replicas of the victims, and narratives were woven into books and Hollywood about those who died in more evocative positions.\nOne of the most famous plaster casts showed an adult holding a child in what appeared to be a loving embrace.\nKnown as the Two Maidens, they were previously assumed to be a mother who died with her daughter in her arms.\nBut the new genomic analysis found that the largest body actually belonged to a man who was not genetically related to the boy, who was actually a boy.\nThe team said their analysis clearly debunked “the stories that have long been told around these individuals.”\nInvestigators discovered four Pompeian victims in one house and they were all believed to be part of a single family. They initially thought two of the bodies were a woman with a child on her hip (pictured), but DNA testing revealed the adult was an unrelated man.\nAlissa Mittnik, from the Max Planck Institute, said: “We were able to refute or challenge some of the previous narratives based on how these individuals stood in relation to each other.\n“It opens up different interpretations of who these people might have been.”\nHe added: “But of course we don’t really know, and we can’t say, who these individuals were and how they interacted with each other.”\nThe researchers also confirmed that the citizens of Pompeii came from diverse origins, but were mainly descended from immigrants from the eastern Mediterranean, underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire.\n“Our findings have important implications for the interpretation of archaeological data and the understanding of ancient societies,” Mittnik said.\n“They highlight the importance of integrating genetic data with archaeological and historical information to avoid misinterpretations based on modern assumptions.”\nThe researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that were mixed in with them.\nThey hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.\nTwo people were discovered in the Cryptoportico House (pictured) and scientists believed that two of those found hugging were two sisters, a mother and a daughter or lovers. The new investigation confirmed that the victims were men and women and one was between 14 and 19 years old, while the other was 22 years old.\nThere were several surprises in ‘the house with the gold bracelet’, the house where the supposed mother and child were found.\nThe adult was wearing an intricate piece of jewelry, which gave the house its name, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman.\nNearby were the bodies of another adult and a child believed to be the rest of his family.\nDNA evidence showed that all four were men and were not related to each other, clearly showing that “the story that has long been told around these individuals” was wrong, Mittnik said.\nThe researcher also discovered that the ancient people descended from ancestors who migrated to the region from the eastern Mediterranean, suggesting they had darker traits than previously believed.\nThey were also able to partially reconstruct the appearance of the individuals, finding that one had black hair and dark skin and two others had brown eyes.\nThis suggested that their ancestors originated from eastern Mediterranean and North African populations that may have included central and eastern Turkey, Sardinia, Lebanon and Italy.\nResearchers said they still need to conduct more genetic testing to fully understand Pompeii’s past.\nStudy co-author David Caramelli of the Universita di Firenze said: “This study illustrates how unreliable narratives based on limited evidence can be, which often reflect the researchers’ worldview at the time.”\nPompeii was covered in ash when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD 79, killing everyone in its path and burying the area.\nThe city was forgotten until its rediscovery in the 18th century, when researchers found dozens of bodies that had been preserved from the soot and ash that covered the streets, buildings and people.\nExcavations at Pompeii began in 1748 and although the eruption of Vesuvius completely destroyed the city, pyroclastic deposits preserved the victims, buildings and art.\nThe victim’s soft tissues had deteriorated over the millennia, but its contours remained intact and were recovered by filling the cavities with plaster, thus preserving its DNA.\nA Pompeian man, believed to be the custodian of a house, was found all alone in an upper room (pictured)\nWhen the bodies were first discovered, researchers noted their position relative to each other as well as location, leading to assumptions about their relationships to each other.\nDuring the Pompeii excavations of 1914, nine individuals were discovered in the garden of a house, two of which were found embraced close to each other.\nAt the time, archaeologists said there were three possibilities for their relationship: they were mother and daughter, two sisters, or lovers.\nAfter scanning the skeletal remains, investigators have now determined that the victims were male and female and one was between the ages of 14 and 19, while the other was 22 years old.\nIn another case discovered in 1974, four victims were found in a house and were assumed to be a genetically related family.\nThe first body was that of a four-year-old boy who was identified as a male due to a lump in the cast near his genitals.",

    "text": "Streaming Now The decade's most triggering comedy Law enforcement officials in [Germany](https://www.dailywire.com/topic/germany) and Austria arrested multiple suspected Islamic terrorists this week who were allegedly planning terrorist attacks on Christmas or New Year’s Eve. The [report](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-779351) from the German publication Bild said that several suspects were arrested in the Ottakring district of Vienna and that another was arrested in Saarland, Germany. The report said that the suspected terrorists were Tajiks who were connected to the Islamic State in Khorasan Province, also known as ISIS-K. Police in Vienna said that there was an “increased terror alert level” as Islamic terrorists “across Europe are calling for attacks on Christian events – especially around December 24th.” “The security authorities have increased the corresponding protective measures in public spaces in Vienna and the federal states,” the police added, noting that they would be increasing their presence and at religious events to deter any attacks. In Vienna, St. Stephen’s Cathedral was at high risk for an attack while German officials were so concerned about an attack at Cologne Cathedral, they swept the building looking for explosives. [CLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP](https://onelink.to/dwapp) The Cologne Police said that they were taking “special protective measures” to prevent Islamic terrorist attacks, but they did not disclose details about what they were going to do so that terrorists could not adjust any plans they may have. “We will take everything into account this evening to ensure the safety of cathedral visitors on Christmas Eve,” said Chief of Cologne Police, Michael Esser. “In coordination with the security officer of the cathedral chapter, the cathedral is searched with sniffer dogs after the evening mass and then locked. Tomorrow all visitors will be screened before entering the church.” Related: [5 Suspected Islamic Terrorists Arrested In France After Planning Attack On Christmas Market](https://www.dailywire.com/news/5-suspected-islamic-terrorists-arrested-in-france-after-planning-attack-on-christmas-market-report)",

    "text": "Andres Freund, un ingeniero alemán de Microsoft, notó por casualidad algo extraño en un software en el que había trabajado y descubrió que un pirata intentaba acceder a computadoras en todo el mundo, según relató recientemente en la red social de microblogueo Mastodon. El ingeniero, de 38 años y afincado en San Francisco (California), descubrió “una puerta trasera” -término informático para nombrar a una entrada secreta que se emplea como control remoto para fines maliciosos- en un fragmento de software que forma parte del sistema operativo Linux. Según los expertos, esta puerta trasera podría haber dado paso a un importante ataque cibernético que, de haberse concretado, acarrearía importantes daños. Tras su hallazgo, la Agencia de Seguridad de Infraestructura y Ciberseguridad (CISA) advirtió que la puerta trasera (CVE-2024-3094) está presente en las versiones 5.6.0 y 5.6.1 de una herramienta de datos llamada XZ Utils, y recomendó que hasta que se solucione, los usuarios y desarrolladores usen una versión anterior. Linux es uno de sistemas operativos de código abierto más importante del mundo, y lo utilizan la gran mayoría de los servidores del mundo de bancos, hospitales, empresas y Gobiernos. La hazaña del ingeniero fue alabada por el director ejecutivo de Microsoft, Satya Nadella, quien destacó en sus redes sociales que “Andres Freund, con su curiosidad y destreza, fue capaz de ayudarnos a todos”. “La seguridad es un deporte de equipo y esta es la cultura que necesitamos en todas partes”, anotó Nadella. No se sabe quién creó la puerta trasera y el respaldo con el que contó, pero, según The New York Times, el plan era tan elaborado que algunos investigadores están convencidos de que solo podría haberlo intentado una nación con habilidades tremendas para concebir ataques cibernéticos, como Rusia o China.",

    "text": "(Minghui.org) Con il nuovo anno alle porte, i praticanti della Falun Dafa di Toronto si sono riuniti a Mel Lastman Square il 17 dicembre scorso per ringraziare il loro fondatore, il Maestro Li Hongzhi, per le sue numerose benedizioni e per augurargli un felice anno nuovo. [I praticanti di Toronto augurano al Maestro un felice anno nuovo!](/u/article_images/a1a402a2efa839974318dd116007d0c2.jpg) Video: I praticanti di Toronto augurano al Maestro un felice anno nuovo! “Sono grato al Maestro per aver fatto tornare mio figlio da me” Cristina è traduttrice e bibliotecaria ed è stata immersa nella cultura cinese fin da bambina. La sua famiglia aveva una serie di libri sulla vita in Cina e leggendoli ha avvertito un senso di nostalgia nei confronti dell’Oriente. Un giorno del 2003, ricevendo un volantino, ha scoperto che si sarebbe tenuto un seminario sulla Falun Dafa presso l’Ontario Institute for Studies in Education dell’Università di Toronto. In precedenza aveva letto vari libri religiosi, compresi quelli sul buddismo, ma non era mai riuscita a trovare una risposta soddisfacente alle sue domande sulla vita, così ha deciso di partecipare. Durante il seminario è stato proiettato un documentario che denunciava la persecuzione della Falun Dafa da parte del Partito Comunista Cinese (PCC). Ha raccontato: “Ai tempi dei miei genitori, la Lituania era un paese comunista, tuttavia mio padre non sopportava la persecuzione e la repressione del popolo da parte del governo, così avevano deciso di scappare in Brasile in barca, e poi sono nata io. Tuttavia, prima di guardare il documentario, già sapevo che il partito comunista era dannoso per l’umanità. “A quel tempo, non avevo letto i libri della Dafa o imparato gli esercizi, ma solo ascoltando l’introduzione avevo sentito la rotazione del Falun nel mio corpo. Poiché l’ho sperimentato personalmente, per me iniziare a praticare è stato un processo naturale”. Dopo il seminario, Christina ha iniziato a praticare la Falun Dafa. La sua vita è cambiata; prima di praticare, delusa dal figlio alcolista, era sempre arrabbiata e gli urlava continuamente contro facendo crescere in lui il risentimento nei suoi confronti. Il divario tra loro era diventato sempre più profondo al punto che durante le feste natalizie il figlio si rifiutava di stare con lei e di accettare i suoi regali. Christina si sentiva infelice, piangeva spesso ed era preoccupata per lui. Dopo aver letto lo Zhuan Falun ha capito che la sofferenza nella vita delle persone deriva dal loro karma. Nessuno può influenzare o cambiare il destino di parenti e amici. Ha compreso che doveva rimanere calma nell’educare suo figlio; ogni volta che si sentiva come inghiottita dal dolore, ricordava ripetutamente a se stessa che, come praticante, doveva guardare dentro di sé per riuscire a cambiare secondo gli standard di Verità, Compassione e Tolleranza, invece di cercare di cambiare gli altri. Gradualmente ha imparato a non dover provare risentimento o tristezza per l’indifferenza e la negligenza del figlio, ma al contrario, a lasciar andare l’ossessione per lui e a perdonarlo. Quando ha saputo che suo figlio era un senzatetto, cambiando il suo atteggiamento nei suoi confronti, lo ha aiutato a trovare un posto dove vivere e, in accordo con gli insegnamenti dello Zhuan Falun, con calma lo ha consigliato comunicando con lui con simpatia e comprensione senza imporgli le sue opinioni e critiche come faceva prima. “La coltivazione mi ha cambiato tutto, senza la Dafa, il mio duro atteggiamento avrebbe tenuto mio figlio lontano da me. Sarebbe potuto anche morire per strada poiché era un senzatetto, e io sarei caduta nella disperazione e nella depressione da cui non sarei riuscita più a liberarmi. Da quando ho un atteggiamento gentile nei suoi confronti si è ripreso e ha iniziato a preoccuparsi di me e a volermi bene. Ha anche pubblicato un libro in cui ha scritto ‘dedico questo libro a mia madre’”. Christina ha augurato al Maestro un felice anno nuovo dicendo: “Nel vasto universo, la mia esistenza è come una piccola particella insignificante, ma il Maestro ha a cuore e protegge ognuna di noi piccole particelle. Grazie Maestro per avermi portato a riva dal mare della sofferenza”. Il Maestro mi ha insegnato a trasformare l’odio in perdono Elaine ha subito un trauma psicologico a causa di una violenza sessuale avvenuta all’età di cinque anni e ha dato la colpa ai suoi genitori. Non sopportava che fossero sempre assenti e che la trascurassero, il che l’aveva portata a subire un danno. Quando era alle superiori, il rapporto di Elaine con i genitori si era incrinato al punto che non parlava più con loro. Aveva iniziato a fare uso di droghe con gli amici per sfuggire e dimenticare il dolore dei conflitti familiari. Nel 2007, quando Elaine ha iniziato l’università, un’amica l’ha portata in biblioteca e le ha consigliato di leggere lo Zhuan Falun. Quando ha iniziato a leggerlo, ha subito pensato che tutto ciò che era scritto nel libro era corretto e sensato, così ha iniziato a praticare la Falun Dafa. Elaine ha poi smesso con le droghe. All’età di quattro anni aveva preso lezioni di pianoforte, ma aveva interrotto al liceo. Tuttavia leggendo lo Zhuan Falun e praticando gli esercizi, il suo pensiero è diventato concentrato e chiaro, così ha ripreso a studiare musica ed è diventata insegnante di pianoforte. Ha spiegato di essersi sentita inizialmente confusa e di non sapere quale direzione prendere nella vita, ma la coltivazione l’ha riportata sulla giusta strada, per lei la musica e la pratica spirituale sono simili. Ha detto che cerca le sue mancanze, migliora la sua coltivazione e la sua mentalità, e poi supera le prove una dopo l’altra. È un processo di tenacia e dedizione a lungo termine. È anche riuscita a superare gradualmente il trauma subito durante l’infanzia. Dopo che il ghiaccio nel suo cuore si è sciolto, si è riconciliata con i suoi genitori e, riferendosi allo Zhuan Falun, ha detto che il Maestro ha raccontato la storia di una donna investita da un’auto dove gli astanti pensavano che fosse giusto estorcere del denaro al conducente, ma lei si era limitata a togliersi la polvere dai vestiti e ad andarsene. Elaine ha detto che, dal punto di vista della gente comune, è facile vedersi come una vittima sviluppando ossessioni e risentimenti. “Come praticante, bisogna prendere alla leggera i danni provocati dagli altri e andare avanti. In passato ero ossessionata dal fatto che i miei genitori non soddisfacessero le mie aspettative. Volevo essere amato, ma dimenticavo che anche loro dovevano affrontare e risolvere il proprio dolore e trauma. Ora ho finalmente una mente serena per affrontare le ombre della mia infanzia. “Nella vita ho sperimentato molte difficoltà e prove. Quando affronto qualcosa, chiedo l’aiuto del Maestro e gli sono molto grata”. Gratitudine verso il Maestro Anna è titolare di una società di formazione. Da bambina ha vissuto in Ucraina ed è stata testimone del crollo dell’Unione Sovietica. In quell’epoca turbolenta, ha sperimentato la povertà e la fame lasciandole un segno profondo nella sua mente. Anna si è trasferita in Canada con i genitori quando era ancora adolescente; le mancava la sua città natale e l’adattamento a un nuovo ambiente e a una nuova cultura a lei sconosciuta l’aveva resa depressa, irritabile e nei confronti di sua madre provava rabbia e risentimento: “Pensavo che a mia madre importasse solo che io avessi un buon lavoro e un futuro. Eravamo così poveri quando ero bambina che si occupava solo dei miei bisogni fisici, ma non aveva la capacità di preoccuparsi del mio mondo interiore o di esprimere il suo amore per me”. Nel 2010, all’età di 20 anni, un collega cinese ha visto una statua di Budda sulla scrivania di Anna e intuendo il suo interesse per il buddismo, le ha regalato una copia dello Zhuan Falun. “In precedenza avevo provato di tutto, ma niente aveva funzionato. Dopo aver letto lo Zhuan Falun, ho capito alcune cose che prima mi lasciavano perplessa: molte delle mie domande hanno trovato una risposta. Nel mio cuore, desideravo essere una persona sincera e gentile e ho deciso di praticare la Falun Dafa”. Dopo aver iniziato a praticare, Anna non si è più sentita depressa ma calma e serena e lentamente ha ristabilito il suo rapporto con la madre. “Quando ho imparato ad apprezzare la sua gentilezza e a sentirmi grata, ho capito che mi aveva sempre amato a modo suo. In passato ero fredda nei suoi confronti, ora la tratto con gentilezza e siamo diventate amiche”. Quando il COVID-19 imperversava nel mondo, aveva avvertito il rischio di rivivere nella povertà e nella fame che aveva sperimentato da bambina. Si sentiva preoccupata, spaventata e disperata, ma sapeva che, come praticante, non bisogna rimanere bloccati nelle emozioni negative ma si deve essere pieni di speranza. Così, seduta sul divano, ha chiuso gli occhi e chiesto silenziosamente al Maestro di aiutarla a superare le difficoltà. All’improvviso, ha visto qualcosa di straordinario: un angelo con ali enormi, era in piedi sopra le nuvole. “Ho capito di non essere sola e che gli esseri divini mi hanno sempre benedetta. Studiando la [Fa], mi sono liberata lentamente della mia paura, sentivo che anche se fossi caduta di nuovo nella fame e nella povertà, gli esseri divini si sarebbero presi cura di me e mi avrebbero protetto. Ho imparato a sopravvivere nelle situazioni difficili mantenendo un atteggiamento ottimista”. In occasione del nuovo anno, desidera ringraziare il Maestro per averle mostrato come essere una persona grata. Non si lamenta più e non si sente in ansia, anzi, affronta i problemi con un atteggiamento positivo. Ha detto: “Ho imparato a essere grata. Grazie Maestro!”.
