    "text": "( MENAFN - UkrinForm) Joining NATO will provide Ukraine with long-term security guarantees and ensure economic stability.\nAccording to Ukrinform, Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Rostyslav Shurma said this in an interview with CNN .\nHe noted that Sweden's recent accession to NATO after many years of negotiations is a good example of the path that Ukraine should take. Shurma emphasized that Ukraine's accession to the Alliance is \"an absolutely vital decision.\"\n\"I think that this [Sweden's accession to NATO] is a very good example of the path we have to go through, because Ukraine's accession to NATO is an absolutely vital decision. Russia will exist for decades, hundreds of years, and we have to be able to defend ourselves and pay for this defense,\" Shurma said.\nIn his opinion, to achieve these goals, Ukraine must have a stable economy. Currently, the key factor that hinders the development of the Ukrainian economy is the physical protection of cities, companies, enterprises and seaports from attacks by Russia, Shurma added.\nRead also: Finland's Stubb: NATO drill sending message to Russia \"For the most part, these are military risks that prevent investors from investing in Ukraine. And perhaps the only solution to this problem will be to obtain security guarantees. Not just bilateral agreements, but security guarantees that business will trust, and business will trust NATO,\" the deputy chief of staff explained.\nAs Ukrinform reported, on March 7, Sweden officially became the new 32nd NATO member.\nMENAFN08032024000193011044ID1107954214\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "Between late February 2022 and earlier this month, 19,847 people have been detained in Russia for speaking out or protesting against the war, according to a rights group. ADVERTISEMENTA Russian poet, Artyom Kamardin, received a 7-year prison sentence for reciting anti-war verses during a street performance in Moscow, in September 2022. Moscow's Tverskoi District Court convicted Kamardin on charges of making calls undermining national security and inciting hatred.Yegor Shtovba, who participated in the event and recited Kamardin's verses, was sentenced to 5 1\\/2 years on the same charges.Kamardin had told the court he did not know his actions broke the law and asked for mercy.\"I am not a hero, and going to prison for my beliefs was never in my plans,\" he said in a statement, posted on his supporters' Telegram channel.The gathering next to the monument to poet Vladimir Mayakovsky was held days after President Vladimir Putin ordered a mobilization of 300,000 reservists amid Moscow's military setbacks in Ukraine. The widely unpopular move prompted hundreds of thousands to flee Russia to avoid being recruited into the military.Police swiftly dispersed the performance and soon arrested Kamardin and several other participants.Russian media quoted Kamardin's friends and his lawyer as saying that police beat and raped him during the arrest. Soon after, he was shown apologizing for his action in a police video released by pro-Kremlin media, his face bruised.Authorities have taken no action to investigate the alleged abuse by police.During Thursday's hearing, Kamardin's wife, Alexandra Popova, was escorted out of the courtroom by bailiffs after she shouted “Shame!” following the verdict. Popova and others were later detained for an unsanctioned \"rally\" outside the court building.Between late February 2022 and earlier this month, 19,847 people have been detained in Russia for speaking out or protesting against the war while 794 people have been implicated in criminal cases over their anti-war stance, according to the OVD-Info rights group, which tracks political arrests and provides legal assistance.The crackdown has been carried out under a law Moscow adopted days after sending troops to Ukraine that effectively criminalized any public expression about the war deviating from the official narrative.

    "text": "上海：在游客集中的“网红”地标治理室外游烟\n记者12日获悉，从3月中旬起，上海率先在8个中外游客集中、人员密集的“网红”地标场所重点推进共治室外“游烟”，以形成示范效应。\n这8个地标场所包括：武康路、豫园商城、新天地、外滩、南京路步行街、陆家嘴商圈、今潮8弄、蟠龙天地。这在全国室外场所控烟工作中，属引领创新之举。\n据了解，上海作为常住人口2500万左右的超大城市，成人吸烟率虽已降至19.2％，但人群二手烟暴露率仍达47.6％。室内控烟状况不断向好，但室外二手烟情况却不容乐观。2024年，上海市爱国卫生运动委员会办公室联合上海市健康促进中心、上海市控制吸烟协会开展的万人调查显示：近六成民众经常遭遇“游烟”，逾九成民众对“游烟”表示反感。根据调查，民众遭遇“游烟”最多的前五位场所为室外排队等候区域（如景区、饭店、饮品店等）、人行道和路口红绿灯等候区域、室外游乐场、公交车站、商场及商务楼出入口等。\n上海市爱卫办、上海市委社会工作部等九部门联合发布《关于进一步加强室外二手烟控制推进无烟健康环境建设的通知》，加强“室外不随处吸烟”文明健康行为的倡导与实践，强化无烟环境建设。\n据介绍，8个“网红”地标将结合自身特点，发挥场所管理方（如管委会、物业）及场所内各业态单位的作用，共建共治、疏堵结合，制度建设、宣传倡导、劝阻引导并进，利用各类宣传平台渠道营造无烟健康的良好环境氛围，形成可复制推广的城市治理新模式。\n比如：徐汇区爱卫办联合该区文明办、文旅局及湖南街道，以武康路文化街区为核心，创新打造“控烟＋艺术＋文创”特色宣传体系。通过在武康大楼、武康邮局、武康庭、武康路旅游咨询中心以及“梧桐生活圈”的多家网红商户布设电子屏宣传、艺术化控烟标识和特色台卡，结合规范设置的室外吸烟点，将健康理念深度融入历史街区文化场景。同时相关部门将组织控烟志愿者现场巡查，以柔性劝导结合灭烟袋发放等方式加强现场管理，并定制健康徐汇主题印章、文创杯垫等特色宣传品，融入年轻人热衷的打卡场景传播控烟理念和营造健康环境。\n虹口区爱卫办联合该区文明办、文旅局、市场监管局、城管执法局、街道爱卫办及物业管理方，构建“部门联动、社会参与、科技赋能、文化浸润”的立体化治理模式，通过织密“一张网”跨部门协同共治破难题，将构建“一支队”赋能培训锻造控烟先锋，创新“一机制”弄堂自治实现动态管理，重构“一空间”场景重塑引领健康风尚，焕新“一载体”海派艺术润泽无烟文化的“五个一”控烟模式，为今潮8弄历史风貌街区注入健康新活力。\n据悉，下一步，8个“网红”地标场所管理方将进一步强化控烟管理制度建设，明确将控烟要求纳入员工工作规范及游客引导系统，通过场所地图、指示系统清晰标注室外吸烟点位置，加强劝阻引导，“疏堵结合”控制室外“游烟”。针对驻场商户及租户，管理方将在租赁合同中细化控烟责任条款，建立常态化巡查整改机制，重点督办12345市民热线及控烟热力地图反馈问题，同步依托智能摄像头、语音提示等技术手段强化动态监管，形成制度约束与技术防控的高效协同治理。（来源：中新社 作者：陈静）",
