    "text": "ALCOY. La temporalidad marca la contratación laboral en l’Alcoià y en febrero se situó en el 60,6% del total de contratos formalizados en esta comarca. El mes pasado se registraron un total de 2.003 contratos, de los que 1.214 fueron temporales, 781 indefinidos (el 39%) y los ocho restantes de formación (0,4%). El porcentaje de temporalidad ha descendido dos puntos respecto a enero de este año, pero ha crecido en ocho en relación a febrero de 2024, según los datos de Labora.\nMientras los contratos temporales superan ampliamente a los indefinidos, se da la situación contraria al hablar de aquellos que se formalizan a jornada completa o parcial. La contratación para trabajar a jornada completa fue la base del 64,5% en febrero, frente a un 35,5% de parcialidad, con 712 contratos. Del total de contratos, 1.066 fueron a hombres y 937 a mujeres, un 53 frente a un 47%.\nPor sectores, la contratación estuvo equilibrada el mes pasado entre los dos motores económicos de la comarca, como son la industria y los servicios, que superan el 92% del total. La industria, con 935 contratos, representó el 46,7%, a los que sumar otro 46% que supusieron los 920 en el sector servicios. Mientras, la construcción en l’Alcoià contabilizó 95 contratos y 53 la agricultura, que son el 4,7% y 2,6% del total, respectivamente.\nEn cuanto a la evolución mensual en la contratación, en febrero descendió respecto a enero, con 76 contratos menos, mientras que registró un aumento en 123 contratos en relación a febrero del pasado año.",

По словам Тихой, сотрудники ведомства даже называют её «своей коллегой», несмотря на то, что до конца не понимают принципы работы её способностей.\n«СБУ ко мне часто обращается, СБУ меня смотрит. Меня вообще смотрят многие из политики нашей, потому что очень много предсказаний сбывается», – рассказала Мария Тихая.\nТаролог уверяет, что именно она предупредила об атаке на кортеж главаря киевского режима Владимира Зеленского во время его поездки на юг страны. Вероятно, речь идёт о визите Зеленского и премьер-министра Греции в Одессу в марте 2024 года, когда российские войска нанесли ракетный удар по району рядом с местом нахождения делегаций.\n«Я сказала, что он поедет на юг и его обстреляют. Господин Зеленский едет на юг – и его кортеж обстреливают. Недавно то же самое выпало: я тоже говорила, что ему нужно быть аккуратным в июне», – добавила Тихая.\nОна подчеркнула, что представители СБУ не раз признавали её «своей коллегой».\nРанее Life.ru писал, что\nМировое обозрение\nИсточник",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, online records show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "title": "Trey Murphy Is a “Klay Thompson Level Shooter” Claims ESPN’s Zach Lowe While Rooting for a Starting Spot",
    "text": "The Pelicans made a big splash this offseason and acquired Dejounte Murray in a trade with the Hawks. While most believe the star guard was brought in to fill the void that Brandon Ingram’s potential exit would leave on offense, Zach Lowe feels the team already has a terrific replacement for the forward in Trey Murphy.\nAdvertisement\nOn The Lowe Post podcast, the league insider compared the 24-year-old’s shooting ability to Mavericks superstar Klay Thompson. He added that he had expected the team to trade Ingram before the 2024-25 season commenced, paving the way for Murphy to become a starter.\nLowe said,\n“People treat him almost like a Klay Thompson-level shooter, and how close people play him. He’s smart at leveraging that sort of pressurized defense for driving opportunities… I said all last year that Trey Murphy III has to start for the Pelicans in 2024-25… If Brandon Ingram is traded, what does Trey Murphy scaling on offense look like?… I am curious to see what’s next in the offensive development.”\n“If Brandon Ingram is traded, what does Trey Murphy scaling up on offense look like?… Maybe its using him as a screener more… This is already a really good role player… I am curious to see what’s next in the offensive development”\n— Zach Lowe on Trey Murphy\n[pic.twitter.com/rmJ0jA5kKu]\n— Pelicans Film Room (@PelsFilmRoom)\n[September 5, 2024]\nMurphy is a stellar floor-spacer. Last season, he shot 37.8% on catch-and-shoot opportunities from beyond the arc, and 38.7% on pull-up three-pointers. While those numbers are slightly off what Thompson managed in his prime, they are close.\nHis three-point percentage dropped last season, but he also played fewer minutes. Perhaps with more game time alongside the team’s starters, he could get back above the 40% mark. One of the major gripes with Murphy is his inconsistent defense, which Lowe believes is a major hindrance in his quest to become a starter. He said,\n“Defensively, [Murphy]’s got to reach another level… He’s got to get a little more stable on defense.”\nLast season, the forward had a defensive rating of 114, which isn’t terrible, but also not promising for a player looking to earn a spot in the Pelicans’ starting lineup. However, the potential upside on offense could make up for what he lacks on the defensive end.\nAssuming the team is unable to trade Ingram or gets a starting quality forward in a deal for the 27-year-old, Murphy will likely come off the bench for at least another season. However, an injury to one of their forwards or Ingram leaving the team for picks and role players could push him into the starting lineup.\nIt’s unclear whether the Pelicans would follow through on Lowe’s suggestion. However, Murphy being a key asset to the team is irrefutable.",

    "text": "A much loved father-of-two has been identified as the camper who died on Boxing Day when a tree branch fell on him in a freak accident in Victoria. Greg Jordan was celebrating the festive season on a private property in Caringal, two hours east of Melbourne , when wild storms swept through the region. A tree branch fell and hit him on the head at about 9am on Tuesday and despite paramedics rushing to the scene, he could not be saved. Mr Jordan is survived by his wife Karen and their two children, Serena, 18, and Bailey, 21. Greg Jordan (pictured with wife Karen) tragically died in a freak accident on Boxing Day when a tree branch fell on him during wild weather while camping in Victoria Tributes have poured in from his family and friends with his daughter sharing a heartbreaking tribute on social media this week. 'It is with a heavy heart that on Boxing Day morning we lost a king. My Dad,' Serena said. 'It was a freak accident that ended in tragedy. And no, I don't want to believe it either.' She described him as a 'super man' who would 'go out of his way to help anyone at any time' and 'never gave up on anybody'. 'To mum, dad was a loving caring husband (that wouldn't let her use his ride-on mower), because that was his job,' she said. 'But dad was strong and protective of his family and wouldn't let anyone get in the way. 'To my brother Bailey, we're gonna make dad proud, we will stand tall and promise dad to look after mum we will carry our dad's legacy forward and not look back. Mr Jordan's daughter Serena (pictured together) remembered her father as a 'super man' who 'would help anyone' Tributes have poured in for Bunyip family man Greg Jordan following the accident 'He was a man with a pure heart that wanted the best for us kids, yes we might have been spoiled, but dad taught us to appreciate the little things. 'Dad taught us how to drive and ride dirt bikes and do all the things that not many other dads did for their kids. 'But we will definitely make him proud when your little bubba comes along.
