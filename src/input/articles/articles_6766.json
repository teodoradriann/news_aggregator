    "text": "General News of Thursday, 13 June 2024 Source: [www.ghanaweb.com](/GhanaHomePage/aboutus.php) Richard Jakpa has made another significant revelation regarding Attorney General, Godfred Yeboah Dame's attempts at implicating Dr. [Cassiel Ato Forson](/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=2581) in the ongoing ambulance case The third accused in the case claimed that the AG urged him to cooperate in having Dr. Forson jailed for six months, thereby declaring his parliamentary seat vacant for a by-election. According to Jakpa, this conversation took place at the home of his cousin, Justice Yonni Kulendi, where the AG allegedly pressured him to provide incriminating evidence against Dr. Forson. During cross-examination led by Dr. Abdul Basit Aziz Bamba, Jakpa testified that the AG mentioned being under considerable pressure from President [Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo](/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=-253) and former Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, to secure Dr. Forson's conviction. “… It was then he (AG) told me my brother, I am under pressure and I said, that is not my problem. “Then he (AG) said 'the finance minister and the president are on my neck mounting pressure. They want this case to be finished by the first week in May',” Jakpa said, according to a report by myjoyonline.com. He continued to say that “I (Jakpa) asked him why the first week in May? “Then he (AG) said you may not know but according to the Constitution, you cannot have a bye-election six months to a general election. “So if I can cooperate with him and get Ato Forson just one month in Nsawam, his seat will be declared vacant and we will go for a by-election. “And I told him (AG) that going for a byelection in Central region how sure are you to win that election?” “Then he said, Central region they are cheap, we will pump money in it and we will win the election.” Richard Jakpa added that the AG said when they win the election, the “NDC will come and beg us for pardon and we will use it to get our things to get through in parliament.” In response to Jakpa's testimony, representatives from Dr. [Cassiel Ato Forson](/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=2581)'s legal team have indicated their intention to further scrutinise the audio evidence and statements provided by Jakpa. They emphasised the significance of these allegations in relation to the ongoing trial, particularly concerning the conduct and impartiality expected from legal authorities.

    "text": "Searchers found a 68-year-old woman dead in Boulder Creek Monday after she was reported missing by a family member, the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release.\nThe family member was concerned for the woman’s well-being due to health issues, and she was considered to be an at-risk adult, according to the release. Searchers looked for her in the Boulder Canyon and Fourmile Canyon areas, near where her car was found.\nThe Sheriff’s Office also sent a message to residents who had signed up for alerts in that area that asked people to be on the lookout for the missing woman, according to the release.\nSearchers found a deceased woman in Boulder Creek later that day that matched her description, but due to the injuries sustained while she was in the creek, the woman’s identification was pending for several days. The Daily Camera is not naming the deceased woman at this time.\nThe death does not appear to be suspicious, according to the release. The Boulder County Coroner’s office is expected to release a final determination on the cause and manner of the death.\nThe agencies involved in the search included the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office, the Boulder County Coroner’s Office, Boulder County Parks and Open Space, the Boulder Emergency Squad, Boulder Fire-Rescue, Boulder Rural Fire Protection District, the FBI, the Four Mile Fire Protection District, Front Range Rescue Dogs and the Rocky Mountain Rescue Group.\nThe Boulder County Sheriff’s Office number for the case is 24-02698.\n ",

    "text": "05/03/2025 - 20:51\nCorrente Circumpolar Antártica pode desacelerar em 20% até 2050, ameaçando seu papel como barreira contra espécies invasoras e a capacidade do oceano de reter carbono.O derretimento das camadas de gelo da Antártida vai desacelerar a corrente oceânica mais forte do mundo, de acordo com uma pesquisade cientistas australianos e noruegueses, publicada nesta segunda-feira (03/03) e que alertou para consequências climáticas significativas na elevação do nível e aquecimento da água do mar, e nos ecossistemas.\nMais de quatro vezes mais forte que a Corrente do Golfo, a Corrente Circumpolar Antártica (CCA) forma uma parte crucial da Correia Transportadora Oceânica, que movimenta a água ao redor do planeta, ligando os oceanos Atlântico, Pacífico e Índico.\nA CCA é o principal mecanismo de troca de calor, dióxido de carbono, produtos químicos e seres vivos entre essas bacias oceânicas, desempenhando um papel importante nos padrões climáticos globais.\nO derretimento das camadas de gelo despejaria grandes quantidades de água doce no oceano, mostra a modelagem feita pela pesquisa. Isso mudaria o teor salino dos mares, dificultando a circulação de água fria entre a superfície e as profundezas, e enfraquecendo a forte corrente oceânica que circunda a Antártida.\nConsequências severas\nO grupo de pesquisadores da Universidade de Melbourne, na Austrália, e do Centro de Pesquisa NORCE, da Noruega, mostrou que a CCA diminuirá em cerca de 20% até 2050 em um cenário de altas emissões de carbono, de acordo com um estudo já revisado por pares e publicado na revista Environmental Research Letters.\n“O oceano é extremamente complexo e finamente equilibrado”, disse o cientista Bishakhdatta Gayen, da Universidade de Melbourne. “Se esse ‘motor’ atual quebrar, pode haver consequências severas, incluindo mais variabilidade climática – com extremos maiores em certas regiões e aquecimento global acelerado devido à redução da capacidade do oceano de atuar como um sumidouro de carbono.”\nOs oceanos desempenham papéis vitais como reguladores climáticos e sumidouros de carbono (depósitos naturais, como os oceanos e as florestas, que absorvem e retêm dióxido de carbono). Águas mais frias podem absorver maiores quantidades de calor da atmosfera.\nA CCA também funciona como uma barreira para espécies invasoras que poderiam chegar à Antártida. Se ela enfraquecer, há uma probabilidade maior de que tais espécies cheguem ao frágil continente antártico.\nas (AFP, EFE, DPA)",

    "title": "Did France own Catalonia?",
    "text": "Did France own Catalonia?\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century, Catalonia was occupied by invading French forces. Catalonia itself was even briefly annexed to France during this period until ultimately the French retreated in 1814.\nDid Catalonia belong to France?\nBetween 1812 and 1814, Catalonia was annexed to France and organized as four departments.\nWas Barcelona ever a part of France?\nIn 1812, Barcelona was annexed by Napoleonic France and incorporated into the First French Empire as part of the department Montserrat (later Bouches-de-l’Èbre–Montserrat), where it remained for a few years until Napoleon’s defeat.\nIs Catalonia French or Spanish?\nCatalan can be considered a close relative of both French and Spanish. However, after several centuries, Catalan has evolved well enough to develop its own structure and grammatical norms, and it operates independently from the evolution and current state of Spanish, French, and other Romance languages.\nWho colonized Catalonia?\nPeople have lived in what is now Catalonia since prehistory, when a society of chieftain-led Iberian tribes emerged. In the sixth century B.C., Greek colonists arrived; around 220 B.C., the Romans took over.\nWhat did Franco do to Catalonia?\nDuring the dictatorship of Franco (1939–1975), not only democratic freedoms were suppressed, but also the Catalan language, which was excluded from the education system and relegated to the family sphere. Castillian (Spanish) became the only language of education, administration, and the media.\nWhy is Catalonia richer than Spain?\nCatalonia’s economy is industrially based and rivals any other location in Spain and in Europe. Industry represents 19.8% of Catalan GDP, above Spain’s average, and manufacturing and industry-related services amount to 50% of the global GDP.\nAre Catalan people French?\nThe current official category of “Catalans” is that of the citizens of Catalonia, an autonomous community in Spain, and the inhabitants of the Roussillon historical region in southern France, today the Pyrénées Orientales department, also called Northern Catalonia and Pays Catalan in French.\nAre Catalan and French related?\nCatalan was considered a dialect of Occitan until the end of the 19th century and still today remains its closest relative. Catalan shares many traits with the other neighboring Romance languages (Occitan, French, Italian, Sardinian as well as Spanish and Portuguese among others).\nWhy does Catalan sound like Portuguese?\nBecause both languages are derived from Latin, you’ll find the greatest similarities in vocabulary, while many speakers say in terms of grammar and pronunciation, Catalan more closely resembles Portuguese or Italian. Catalan has a broader array of sounds than Spanish and a tone or pitch that does not exist in English.\nWhen did France get Catalonia?\nWhen the war between Spain and France ended in 1659, the peace treaty ceded the Catalan territories north of the Pyrenees, the counties of Roussillon, and the northern half of Cerdanya, to France. Catalan institutions were suppressed in the French Roussillon; in 1700, public use of the Catalan language was prohibited.\nWas Spain under French rule?\nNapoleonic Spain was the part of Spain loyal to Joseph I during the Peninsular War (1808–1813) after the country was partially occupied by French forces. During this period, the country was considered a client state of the First French Empire.\nDoes Barcelona speak French?\nMany people from Barcelona understand English and French. Here are some of the most frequent Catalan expressions translated into Spanish, English, and French, which will help you get around the city.\nWhy is Catalan so different from Spanish?\nGrammar: Catalan has a more extensive and intricate verbal conjugation system compared to Spanish. It also retains more Latin features, making it closer to its ancient roots. Catalan also preserves the neuter gender for nouns, which Spanish has lost. Word Stress: Catalan has less predictable word stress than Spanish.\nWhat is the richest town in Catalonia?\nCatalonia and its contrasts: Less than twenty kilometers and the Collserola hills separate the residents of the richest town in Catalonia from the poorest. The richest town is Sant Cugat del Vallès, located close to the Autonomous University of Barcelona and High Technology Park.\nWhat is the issue with Catalonia?\nA constitutional crisis took place in Spain from 2017 to 2018 as the result of a political conflict between the Government of Spain and the Generalitat de Catalunya over the issue of Catalan independence.\nIs Catalonia rich or poor?\nCatalonia is one of the wealthiest regions in Spain. It has a strong economy, driven by industries such as tourism, manufacturing, and technology. The region contributes significantly to Spain’s overall GDP and has a higher GDP per capita compared to the national average.\nWhy didn’t Catalonia get independence?\nWith many key pro-independence leaders arrested for holding a banned ballot and others fleeing into exile, the independence bid collapsed. Since then, Catalonia has continued to preserve its own identity and language but with little appetite for doing that outside the larger Spanish state.\nDoes Catalonia want to be independent from Spain?\nAll of the Spanish national political parties in Catalonia reject the idea of independence, except Catalonia In Common-We Can (Catalunya En Comú-Podem), which are pro-referendum but have remained neutral on the issue.\nWhen was Catalan banned?\nAfter the Treaty of the Pyrenees, a royal decree by Louis XIV of France on April 2, 1700, prohibited the use of the Catalan language in present-day Northern Catalonia. The decree forbade use in any official document, under the threat of being invalidated.\nIs it OK to speak Spanish in Barcelona?\nThere are two official languages in the city: Catalan and Spanish. The overwhelming majority of Barcelona’s residents consider themselves fully bilingual.\nAre Spain and France friends?\nFrance and Spain enjoy an extremely close relationship of confidence, driven by law enforcement and judicial cooperation. They have concrete cooperation projects in interconnections (energy and transport) and work together to address common challenges.\nWhy did France invade Spain?\nOn February 16, 1808, under the pretext of sending reinforcements to the French army occupying Portugal, French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain. Thus began the Peninsular War, a phase of the Napoleonic Wars fought between France and much of Europe.",
