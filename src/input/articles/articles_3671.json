    "title": "How Dr. Pernessa Seele built a movement bridging faith and health",
    "text": "Born in Lincolnville, South Carolina, Dr. Pernessa Seele has dedicated over 37 years to bridging the gap between faith and public health. As the founder and CEO of The Balm In Gilead , she has transformed how churches address health disparities in Black communities. Named one of Time Magazine’s Most Influential Persons in the World, Dr. Seele’s vision has grown from a simple idea at Harlem Hospital to an international organization that’s reshaping how faith communities approach health education and advocacy .\n[Editor’s note: This is a truncated transcribe of a longer video interview. Please see the video for the extended version. Some errors may occur.]\nYou’ve built an institution that has lasted 37 years. What inspired you to create The Balm in Gilead for our community?\nIt was just a teeny-weeny little idea that God gave me in 1989 to mobilize the faith community of Harlem. I was working at the Harlem Hospital, and looking back 37 years, I was very naive. Had no idea what I was doing, but I could not understand why at that time everybody in the hospital who was in the bed was dying of HIV, and there were no pastors coming. There were no mommas and daddies coming. The funeral homes weren’t burying people.\nThe second day on this job, God gave me a little idea, because I hated this job, of a Harlem Week of Prayer for the Healing of AIDS. That little idea gave birth to The Balm in Gilead. Today, not only are we mobilizing faith communities around HIV, but also around Alzheimer’s, cardiovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, genetic kidney disease. When you look at African Americans, we have the high rates of everything. And even when we don’t have high rates, we die too soon because we don’t get to the doctor or when we go, we don’t get access to the right information.\nCan you share your superpowers on being able to have a vision that is shared with God and building an institution that authentically serves our community?\nThere’s always someone who has a burning thing in them. That burning really is God saying, I want you to do this thing. I want you to be my ears and my hands and my feet. The key is that you have to get yourself out of the way. First of all, you have to be a believer that God is calling you to do this thing.\nDon’t get sideswept though, because we got a million things of why we can’t do it. The time is not right. We don’t have no money. We too busy. And all of that are just delusional conflicts that get in God’s way of using you. When you say yes to that burning in you, you will be absolutely mystified on how everything that you need will come to you. But first you have to say yes to it.\nHow do you continue to educate and bring churches together through the Healthy Churches conference?\nEvery day I have to remind myself that you have to be called by the Lord to work with the church, especially the Black church. We want every church to have a health ministry. We want every church to be focused on health disparities in our communities. The pews and the pulpit are filled with sickness and disease. And it doesn’t have to be so.\nThe church is still that institution that anchors our community. Just like when we got our freedom, every church was a center of education. Every church has a youth ministry. The church anchored Morehouse, Clark, Howard, Clafflin—the HBCUs came out of the Black church. Today, we want that same kind of intentional focus on health that the church had to make sure Black people learned to read and write.\nWhat specific health information are you trying to share through the conference?\nAt Healthy Churches Conference, we tell the truth. Sometimes we don’t go to the doctor because we are hopeful the Lord is going to heal us. You have to get clear that going to the doctor does not say you don’t believe in God because God is working through doctors. God is working through medicine.\nFor example, when we say dialysis, you go to any dialysis place and it’s filled with Black people. What we don’t know is that a high percentage of kidney disease is genetic. There is a genetic test that if the doctor would tell you about it, you might be able to prevent having to get to dialysis. That’s the kind of information we share.\nThis year, we have Dr. Joy DeGruy speaking about post-traumatic slave syndrome and its impact on our health. It’s hard for us to give up things we have been taught. But it’s also about the healthcare system, because oftentimes Black people are not given access, because they’re treating us the way they treated us back in the day too.\nWhat do you want pastors and members to understand about this year’s conference?\nThis is the 11th annual Healthy Churches Conference, and The Balm in Gilead has been around for 37 years. So God must be doing something right through us. We’re asking you to join us as faith partners—bring at least 25 to 100 or more people from your congregation to this virtual conference. They’ll have access to this information for six months so they can get the information for themselves, their families, and the community.\nWe talk about the role of pastors—the good, the bad, and the ugly—because we have to address it all when it comes to our health. We’re looking at how to overcome these challenges to have a better life for ourselves and our children and our children’s children.",

    "text": "By Angie DiMichele, South Florida Sun-Sentinel ,\n22 hours ago Prospective student Ines Horta and her mom, Isabel Horta. take a soggy tour of Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton on Friday. Carline Jean/South Florida Sun-Sentinel/TNS South Florida will be under a flood watch through Saturday evening as a storm that is expected to bring “considerable rainfall” for much of the region moves across the area, forecasters said.\nA low-pressure system that formed in the Gulf of Mexico started moving across the state Friday. Its greatest effects are expected to be from Friday evening into Saturday morning, possibly into Saturday afternoon, the National Weather Service Miami said in a weather briefing.\nForecasters anticipate between 2 to 4 inches of total rain with 6 inches or more possible in some areas. The flood watch for Broward County is scheduled through 4:30 p.m., and as of early Friday afternoon, the weather service indicated the greatest risk of strong storms has shifted to the south, including the Florida Keys, with moderate to heavy rain still falling that could generate localized flooding.\nA wind advisory is also in place from Friday afternoon to Saturday evening from Jupiter to Homestead. Forecasters said sustained winds are expected to be between 20 and 30 mph with gusts up to 40 mph.\nForecasters warn that the strongest storms are expected to be in the southern parts of the region, with wind gusts potentially up to 60 mph, the weather service said.\n“Exact rainfall totals will come down to the evolution of the low pressure system and its exact track — where some uncertainty unfortunately still remains,” the weather service said.\nThe Fort Lauderdale area is considered to be at slight risk of excessive rainfall, which means isolated and scattered flash floods are possible, according to NWS Miami.\nBeach conditions will be significantly hazardous from Friday morning to Saturday night, and marine hazard warnings exist along the entire South Florida coast.\nFor more stories, Subscribe to South Florida Sun Sentinel.\n©2024 South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

    "text": "The James Beard Foundation announced its 2025 James Beard Awards semifinalist restaurant and chef picks for Texas on Jan. 22, and a handful of Dallas area restaurants are in the running. Finalists and winners will be revealed in the coming months.\nBut what exactly is Dallas-Fort Worth’s legacy in the awards program? Between 2012 and 2024, the region has seen 89 nominees and semifinalists, though no category winners. D Magazine reports the last time the region had a winner was in 1994, with veteran chef Dean Fearing.\nIn recent times, some years have been better to North Texas than others. 2018, for instance, saw a single D-FW contender, with Revolver Taco Lounge’s Regino Rojas receiving a semifinalist nod for the Best Chef: Southwest category. Then 2019 had six semifinalists between national and regional Southwest categories. The Best Chef: Texas category was only introduced in 2020.\n10 Dallas area restaurants, chefs and bars snag James Beard Award semifinalist nods\nHere’s a look at chefs and restaurants in D-FW that have been named nominees and semifinalists from 2014 to 2024. (And if you’re thinking that a lot of these restaurants aren’t open anymore, you’re not wrong.)",

The patient, a 52-year-old man suffering from end-stage liver disease, underwent a 12-hour surgery on December 4 last year. The donor, in this case, was the patient's wife, who willingly contributed a portion of her liver to save her husband's life. Both the donor and recipient have been recovering well, with the patient not requiring ventilator support post-surgery.

    "text": "INGRAM, Texas — In the days following catastrophic flooding along the Guadalupe River, a mobile mechanic from Bandera and a crew of volunteers from across Texas are helping clear the wreckage left behind, one pile at a time.\nDaniel Beedle, owner of Centerfire Services, arrived in Ingram just hours after the floodwaters receded, bringing with him heavy equipment, friends, and a mission to help his neighbors.\n“We’re like five days in on cleanup from the floods out here in Ingram,” Beedle said. “We had probably 20 pieces of equipment and, and 40 people.”\nBeedle and his team used skid steers, excavators, and even a six-wheel army truck to build low-water crossings and gain access to areas of land that had been completely cut off by the flood. They weren’t just clearing mud and debris, they were carefully combing through wreckage, knowing lives had been lost and some people were still unaccounted for.\n“Every pile… every vehicle has to be treated differently,” said Joe Rigelsky, founder of Upstream International and pastor at Pipe Creek Church. “To keep the dignity of humanity, you've got to remember there are people watching this who know their kids are missing.”\nRigelsky has responded to disasters for nearly two decades, but this one hit close to home. Volunteers like him and Beedle say the work may be messy and exhausting, but it’s necessary.\n“This is our community. This is our neighbors. So it’s our job,” Beedle said.\nLocal businesses also stepped up in a big way. Companies like Koviak Built, Reddy Pros, Coyote Dirt Works, Van Delden Wastewater Systems, Singer Services, Bad Company Excavation, Divine Shine and many others donated equipment, manpower and time to support the recovery effort.\nAmong the volunteers is Clifton Dugosh, who’s been assisting cadaver dog teams during the search for missing persons. “We just want to help the families get a bit of closure, if we can,” he said.\nCadaver dogs, like Rocket from Las Cruces, New Mexico, have helped pinpoint specific areas for closer inspection. They're based in El Paso, Texas and came down to South central Texas to help out crews. But the heavy lifting, physically and emotionally, is being carried by the dozens of volunteers on the ground.\n“You find common ground in suffering,” said Rigelsky. “You wake up eager to go help find people—or at least bring closure.”\nOfficials and volunteers are asking anyone who wants to help to check in with local coordinators first. Supplies, manpower and search efforts need to be carefully managed to avoid duplicating efforts and to ensure resources go where they’re needed most.\nDespite the chaos, one thing is clear: Texans continue to show up for one another when it matters most.",
