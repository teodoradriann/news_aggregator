The assassin’s father is carried into the courtroom. He must answer for charges including incitement, insult and coercion.\nStrange scenes at the Hanau District Court: Because he once again failed to appear for trial, the police forcibly brought the father of the Hanau attacker, who murdered nine people for racist reasons on February 19, 2020, before the court. Four officers carried the 77-year-old into the courtroom and sat him on a chair in the dock. But the pensioner preferred to lie on the floor.\nThe man must answer for suspicion of incitement, insult, coercion, false accusation and violations of the Violence Protection Act. The defendant had already ignored the summons two weeks ago.\nJohannes Hock is an experienced lawyer. But he has probably never had such an assignment as a public defender. And he has probably never had a client like the 77-year-old father of the attacker on February 19, 2020. The first day of the trial two weeks ago was canceled because the defendant did not show up and left his lawyer sitting.\nThis Thursday, the court and the audience were presented with a different perspective for hours: the 77-year-old, who can at least be described as a troublemaker, was lying behind the dock and this time left his public defender standing. He refused any contact.\n“The criminal judge, district director Clementine Englert, even asked the pensioner several times whether he was thirsty – no reaction. Whether he wanted to say something about the allegations – no reaction.\nBecause in the morning, at 9:30 a.m. sharp, all the lawyers are present. Only the 77-year-old is not. The criminal judge had suspected this and had taken precautions. She looked at her smartphone. “The police are on their way and will inform me.” She is certain: “The gentleman will come, even if not voluntarily.”\nShe was right, because Chief Inspector Andreas G. and four of his colleagues opened the apartment after ringing and calling the defendant’s house in vain. “It’s like three years ago. We found him in bed, he was fully clothed,” said the police officer, reporting that the arrested man had reported heart problems. So an ambulance and emergency doctor were ordered to the western part of the city, but they left again because the man refused treatment.\nFinally, four officers carry the man into the courtroom. He tries to defend himself and resists being brought before the court – but the martial-looking arrest squad gives him no chance. The defendant gasps for air, lies down and calls for his family doctor.\nA doctor is already present in the person of Hildegard Müller, a recognized psychiatric expert. But she too is rejected by the man on the ground. “Is he fit to stand trial?” the judge wants to know. The expert is clear: “I think this is a staged event.”\nAttorney Hock files a motion for a break until the client’s fitness to stand trial has been determined – the court rejects the motion. Because he is obviously fed up with the 77-year-old refusing to talk to him – “how am I supposed to defend him?” – he files a motion for release from his duties – the court rejects the motion.\nAnd so the lawyers then concentrate on the accusations of public prosecutor Martin Links, who names nine charges: incitement, insulting Mayor Claus Kaminsky, false accusation, coercion and several violations of the restraining order – he is not allowed to approach a house in which relatives of a murder victim live closer than 30 meters.\nDuring a break, lawyer Hock has success. He talks to his client. “I made it clear to him that his blockade attitude is not achieving anything. I hope we can do it.” This would be necessary in view of the previous convictions, because the pensioner has already been legally sentenced to fines totaling 9,000 euros.\nThe defense attorney files the application for release\nThe accused father of the Hanau attacker lay down on the floor of the courtroom, his lawyer standing next to him. thorsten becker © Thorsten Becker",

    "text": "African wild dogs will soon have their own sperm bank. (Photo: Gallo Images / Chris Daphne) By Damien Boyd Bertrand Paul Paris Follow Following 11 Apr 2024 Follow Following 2 Scientists from the Institute for Breeding Rare and Endangered African Mammals have been working in southern Africa for over 15 years to protect endangered African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus). They’ve now decided to freeze sperm from as many genetically diverse male African wild dogs as possible and use this to artificially inseminate female African wild dogs for the first time. Why is the African wild dog in danger?\nWild dogs are a native species to sub-Saharan Africa. They are highly efficient pack hunters but need large home ranges to survive and avoid competitors like lions. The problem is that most of the remaining habitats are so small and fragmented that they can’t support large populations anymore. Usually, when wild dogs are subadults (around two years old) they move far away and form their own pack. But being stuck in small reserves, they cannot do this. Instead they interbreed, reducing their genetic diversity.\nHuman encroachment makes habitats smaller and smaller for almost every species, pushing many reserves to the limit of their carrying capacity. Today, wild dogs occupy only 7% of their former range. According to our best estimates, there are about 550 dogs remaining in South Africa scattered across 14 highly fragmented populations.\nHow can genetic diversity help the African wild dog survive?\nIt helps build resilience to disease. Outbreaks of rabies and canine distemper virus are frequent – either spread from domestic dogs nearby, or from existing virus already present in reserves. Those diseases can spread rapidly among wild dogs and decimate a pack, which is about five to 20 dogs. In 2017, canine distemper virus completely wiped out 21 out of 22 packs of wild dogs in Laikipia County, Kenya in less than four weeks.\nWe plan to use sperm freezing and artificial insemination to help distribute genetic diversity between isolated populations. This will give wild dogs a better chance of surviving disease. We can take sperm from dogs in a region with resistance to canine distemper virus and mix those valuable genes into many other packs quickly. The next time there is a disease outbreak, a large number of their offspring will survive. We predict that this can make a big impact quite quickly.\nWhat conservation methods have been used before?\nTo increase genetic diversity, African wild dogs have been translocated (moved) across South Africa since 1998. Young dogs that are ready to leave their pack are artificially grouped in a boma (temporary enclosure in the wild) with dogs of the opposite sex from a different part of the country. Over several weeks, they form a new genetically mixed pack that is released into the wild.\nBut the drawback to this method is that the new pack is junior and only able to colonise the limited habitat on the periphery of an established pack’s territory. So it can take about 150 generations (about 300 years) for genes from the new pack to spread through the existing population via the formation of subsequent packs and natural breeding. It’s also not possible to simply introduce a genetically valuable dog directly into an established pack to breed – it’d be killed due to the pack’s complex social hierarchy.\nWe can’t afford to wait that long. Most of the challenges facing wild dogs have occurred in the last 200 years. A whole population of wild dogs could be lost with the next disease outbreak.\nHow will sperm freezing and artificial insemination help?\nOur research shows that a hybrid approach combining natural and artificial breeding during translocation will bring in new genes much faster. We could even directly introduce valuable genes into established packs by moving sperm rather than animals. To do this, we plan to monitor the alpha female for signs she is in heat, while the pack is housed in the translocation boma. We can then artificially inseminate her with frozen sperm from a valuable male. This has the potential to produce new, genetically diverse, disease-resistant pups every year.\nOur back-up plan against disease outbreaks is to create a bank of African wild dog sperm from multiple males. Sperm frozen in liquid nitrogen tanks at very cold temperatures can last 50 or 100 years and still produce offspring. This method is very successful in livestock breeding . We were not able to do this until now because African wild dog sperm only lived for 30 minutes after it was thawed, but to inseminate a female dog, the sperm has to survive for at least four to six hours. We recently improved the freezing technique so African wild dog sperm are now able to swim and survive for eight hours after being thawed.\nWe can now set up an African wild dog sperm bank for the first time. The frozen sperm will be taken into the field in portable liquid nitrogen tanks. Our partners, the University of Pretoria Mammal Research Institute and Embryo Plus , will help develop the sperm bank. We plan to build a consortium so that we can have multiple sperm banks throughout South Africa as back-ups.\nWill this be very expensive?\nThe hybrid approach is actually a cheaper way of maintaining genetic diversity in African wild dogs. Some recent modelling in other species found that the hybrid approach was between seven and 84 times cheaper than the natural breeding approach. This is because it needed 13-100 times fewer animals to maintain 90% genetic diversity in the population over a 100-year period.\nWith fewer animals needed, the total cost to conserve the species (including costs for animal and reserve management, sperm banking and artificial insemination) is lower. This hybrid approach could save money and alleviate the carrying capacity of reserves without reducing genetic diversity of wild dogs – something most wildlife managers and politicians will greatly appreciate.

    "text": "Mikel Arteta bemoans Arsenal’s display in both boxes after home loss to West Ham The Gunners missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League on Thursday night. Mikel Arteta admitted his side came up short in both boxes as Arsenal slumped to defeat to West Ham to miss out on regaining top spot in the Premier League.\nThe Gunners remain behind Liverpool as they lost 2-0 at the Emirates Stadium on what Arteta conceded was one of the most frustrating nights of his four-year tenure as Arsenal boss.\nTomas Soucek’s opener – awarded after the VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build up – and a second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos earned the visitors a deserved win.\nThings could have been even better had Said Benrahma not had a stoppage-time penalty saved by David Raya on a night where Arteta applauded the performances of the opposition.\n“I congratulate West Ham and praise my players. That’s what I can tell you,” he said.\n“This is football. When you look at how much we generated in the game, to see the result is very disappointing. But they were better than us in both boxes. They had two shots, with the penalty three. We had 30.\n“If we don’t score with 30 shots, then we have to do 50 or 60 to try to score. That’s the only thing. I can’t imagine a game where we have more touches in the box, more dominance and less situations for the opponent against a really good West Ham side. Today though, it wasn’t enough to win the game.”\nAsked if it was among the most frustrating nights of his managerial career, Arteta replied: “It is. But it’s football. Normally when the team generates so much it’s going to win games.\n“That’s the way we’ve done it. Against Brighton, we generated so much and against Liverpool as well, but we score goals in different ways.\n“We have to make another step in that area to win games more comfortably, that’s for sure, because today the team deserves to win the game. There’s no question about that.”\nArteta successfully fought a Football Association charge after he criticised the officiating and VAR in defeat at Newcastle last month and was less vocal this time.\nHe did, however, suggest technology needs to be further advanced to make close calls, adding: “They’re saying it’s not conclusive. It’s a shame that with the technology that we have, that it’s not that clear so that we can say whether it’s out or in. It’s done. It’s gone. There’s nothing we can do about it now.\n“If the technology we have at the moment is not good enough to give us that answer, what we have to do is without that win the game. With the number of situations we generated in the game, that should have been more than enough.”\nFor West Ham and manager David Moyes, this was a rare taste of victory at the Emirates Stadium – Moyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United.\nWest Ham were 17th at the turn of the year but went on to win the Europa Conference League and now sit just four points off the top four after this hard-fought and deserved win.\nMoyes is out of contract in the summer but, on the four-year anniversary of his reappointment as West Ham boss, feels a new deal will soon be ironed out.\n“We’re getting ready to talk,” he told Amazon Prime.\n“I don’t think any of us are jumping to get it done too quickly, I think we are just happy to make sure we get it done. We will do, I don’t see any problems with that at all.\n“We are not one of the top teams. We are trying to get up and grow the team. For West Ham to be in Europe is a great period.”",

Zur Debatte steht außerdem, ob die Ausnahmeregelung für Wohnungen, die nach 2014 auf den Markt gekommen sind, ein neues Stichdatum braucht.\nKritik an der Ausweitung der Mietpreisbremse kommt von der CDU. „Eine solche Ausweitung wäre nicht nur verfassungsrechtlich problematisch, sondern gleichzeitig auch der Sargnagel für den Wohnungsbau in Deutschland“, sagte der Berliner Abgeordnete Jan-Marco Luczak. „Investoren sind auf Planungssicherheit und verlässliche Rahmenbedingungen der Politik angewiesen, sonst werden sie schlichtweg nicht mehr in die Schaffung neuer Wohnungen investieren.“\nMieterbund fordert Regelung für bezahlbares Wohnen\nFür eine Ausweitung des Gesetzes setzen sich Mietervereinigungen ein. „Wohnungen von 2014 sind 2025 kein Neubau mehr. Diese Wohnungen sind aber nach wie vor von der Mietpreisbremse ausgenommen“, sagte Jutta Hartmann, Sprecherin vom Deutschen Mieterbund im Gespräch mit dem Westfälischen Anzeiger.\nDie Vorwürfe der Union, die Regelung sei verfassungswidrig, hält Hartmann für haltlos. „Das ist ein Eingriff und die Mieten sind dann nicht dem freien Markt unterworfen. Das brauchen wir aber, weil es anders nicht geregelt wird. Das will natürlich die wohnungswirtschaftliche Seite und die Unionsseite nicht. Daher rühren diese Angriffe auf die Mietpreisbremse und dann wird auch das Schwert der Verfassungswidrigkeit gezogen“, sagte Hartmann.\nZoff in der Merz-Regierung – Wirkung der Mietpreise ist umstritten\nDie Mietpreisbremse soll Wucher verhindern und gilt in Deutschland seit 2015. In Gebieten mit einem „angespannten Wohnungsmarkt“ darf die Miete bei Vertragsabschluss nicht mehr als 10 Prozent über dem lokalen Preis liegen. Die Regierung von Kanzler Friedrich Merz (CDU) hatte sich im Koalitionsvertrag darauf verständigt, die Maßnahme bis 2029 zu verlängern.\nDie Wirkung der Mietpreisbremse ist umstritten. In vielen Städten steigen die Quadratmeterpreise nach wie vor stark an. Im Bundestag hatte sich die SPD dafür ausgesprochen, mit einer Kommission zu prüfen, wie die Regelung genau greift.",

    "text": "PLAINS, Ga. (WALB) - A new 9/11 memorial is currently on display in former president Jimmy Carter’s hometown of Plains. That’s all thanks to a Boy Scout who spearheaded all the efforts to make it all possible.\n“It’s raw trade center steel. They pulled it right from the wreckage,” said Grady Young, a perspective Eagle Scout.\nGrady Young spent three years planning and organizing the 9/11 memorial that is now on display in Plains. (walb) Young has been in the Boy Scouts for several years now. He said three years ago he had to start coming up with an idea for his Eagle Scout project—a service project that members do to benefit their community. That’s when his grandmother shared the idea to collaborate with a September 11th organization to bring the historical monument to the small town.\n“The fundraising effort, it only took maybe three or four weeks for everything to come back in and get enough to pay for this monument,” he said.\nYoung raised close to $4,800 for the monument. The Tunnel to Towers Foundation based out of New York provided the actual steel that is shaped to look like the Twin Towers. Grady says it’s important to never forget everyone who lost their lives on that day.\n“I believe it will help the community remember the 9/11 attacks and help the community just have something else special for tourists to see, people who live here. I think it adds to the city pretty nicely,” he said.\nTunnel to Towers Foundation, a New York based organization, sent actual trade center steel recovered from the wreckage to go on the memorial. (walb) The monument not only pays tribute to 9/11 victims but also has a tie to former President Jimmy Carter. Words Carter said a year after the terrorist attacks are also engraved on the back of the monument.\n“Even in the face of potential harm, the United States must lead the fight to secure human rights for all peoples...” Young read off the memorial. “It’s one of those things that people in America--everyone remembers where they were. I wasn’t there but I feel strongly about it and I feel like it’s something we should always remember.”\nThe 9/11 memorial is something that Jill Stuckey, superintendent of the Jimmy Carter Historical Park, says Jimmy Carter would be proud of.\n“Oh he would be just thrilled that this is here in his hometown and I wish he could be here,” she said.\nYoung said he’s in the beginning stages of planning a ceremony on September 11 of this year to formally present this memorial to the community.\nA new 9/11 memorial is currently on display in the center of former president Jimmy Carter’s hometown of Plains.

    "title": "Canada Plans To Shrink Its Population… AFTER Immigration Demand Plummets",
    "text": "Canada’s government just went from labeling critics of its immigration policy as xenophobic to admitting their plan was unsustainable. This morning the Government of Canada (GoC) announced it won’t just throttle immigration, but the country will embrace intentional degrowth . The decision comes after a sharp decline in immigration applications, implying the sudden shift is more about saving face than shifting policies.\nCanada To Embrace Population De-Growth Starting Next Year Policymakers called for a “pause” on immigration, but actually described de-growth. This morning the GoC announced they’ll be targeting a marginal population decline of 0.2% in both 2025 and 2026, respectively. It will then target 0.8% growth in 2027, less than a third of this year’s expected growth. The move will be distributed across both permanent and temporary resident segments.\nPermanent Resident Limit To Be Cut By 22%, A Pace Similar To The Drop From 2021 To 2023 The current permanent resident target will be slashed by over a fifth, over two years. They had originally planned for 1 million new permanent residents over 2025 and 2026, half in each year. That’s now been slashed by 22.5% to 775,000 people over the period, declining from 2025 (395k) to 2026 (380k). It would be a huge decline if this segment wasn’t already on target to fall below that range.\nCanada has already seen a strong decline in permanent residency applications. Canada received 274,456 applications in 2024 as of July, a drop of 3.4% compared to last year. However, this isn’t a recent problem, applications have been falling for years now. In 2023, the country received 546k permanent resident applications. That’s about 20% fewer than it received in 2021. If the current pace of declines persists, the drop would have fallen to just above the 2027 limit they just announced. What a random coincidence, eh?\nCanada’s breakneck population growth is largely from temporary residents. Over the span of just two years, the country’s non-resident population doubled to 3 million people. To put that into context, if just the additional people added over those two years formed their own city, it would be the third largest in the country. It was extremely aggressive growth.\nPolicymakers at all levels are now pretending it was unexpected, but it’s hard to believe. Especially since a state-owned company was established to help it grow, and 2024 marked the end of a $148 million taxpayer-funded plan to grow just one segment . But we digress.\nThe GoC plans to roll back some growth over the next two years. The plan will cut this population by ~30% over two years, dropping 446k people in 2025 and another 446k in 2026. In 2027 they plan to reintroduce growth, with a comically small 17k people. As you may have already guessed, this is getting ahead of the sharp declines.\nCanada’s inflow of permanent residents is already plunging. Annual growth of the net inflow was down a whopping 46.8% in Q2 2024 . The GoC previously announced a 20% decline is planned, but it’s currently on track to double that rate—which is just about in line with the new targets. Hey look, another coincidence!\nA good chunk of non-permanent residents in Canada are visiting on a study visa. Many analysts are likely to attribute the decline of this segment due to the changes to study permits. Those largely came into effect in September 2024, after the drop. More importantly, they only announced throttling to save face after study permit applications began falling . Another coincidence, surely.\nCanada’s Immigration Policy Increasingly Criticized As Exploitation, Not Generosity The drop in demand and sudden decision to embrace it comes amidst a tarnished global reputation. Back in 2019, Canada’s already strong immigration plan was praised as an example of strong global leadership. Since then, it’s scaled considerably and flat-out started to demonstrate its exploitative nature. The UN recently called one temporary resident program “modern slavery,” and the world-renowned reputation for education is a little less bright as international news runs more stories on diploma mills that popped up overnight to scam students. It also doesn’t help that when the immigration minister was asked to defend the policies, he stated that Canada needs international students because they’re “lucrative .” He may not be the smartest, but at least he’s honest.\nThere’s also been a giant uptick in criminals exploiting the immigration system, amplified by gaps embraced to facilitate faster growth. For example, the country didn’t verify student admission letters until recently—anyone could just show up with a printout and get a visa.\nHowever, the biggest external pressure comes from the country’s largest trade partner, the US. Increasingly the country is finding terror suspects with “laundered” Canadian identifications, making it more difficult to control their border. As a result, American policymakers recently warned the country needs to buckle down on immigration or they’ll be forced to reconsider what it means to be Canadian .\nThe decline also shouldn’t surprise anyone. The country can only coast on its historic reputation as a successful immigration hub for so long. Eventually it needs to prove it can continue to do that. It gets harder and harder to maintain that Canada is providing opportunity when 1 in 5 young adults are unemployed , even those with a “domestic” advantage.\nThere’s also strong reason to believe changes set to go into effect will reveal population overestimates. We previously pointed out that tax data shows 1 in 7 recent immigrants likely left the country within 3-years of arriving . The national statistics agency followed up with data confirming the difficulty in measuring those who leave since the country doesn’t track departures unless they pay an exit tax. Next year the country plans on tracking departures, probably to collect that exit tax on assets.",
