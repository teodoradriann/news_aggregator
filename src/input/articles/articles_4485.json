    "text": "- While it is built like other tuk-tuks, the electric-powered model is faster, with a speed of over 60 km/hr - Kenya is looking to fully move towards the use of electric buses by 2027 Zetech University has unveiled an electric powered tuk-tuk in a step towards improving the transport sector and reducing carbon emissions. Prof Gitau Kamau, a lecturer at the university, said the engineless tuk-tuk has rechargeable batteries that can last for more than 100 km. Solar panels integrated across its roof harness energy. \"We have assembled the tuk-tuk, put in electric motors and solar panels to recharge its batteries once they get drained. It is noiseless, cost effective and clean,\" the professor said during the university's Innovation week. While it is built like other tuk-tuks, the electric-powered model is faster, with a speed of over 60 km/hr. The cost is also slightly higher than the normal tuk-tuks, at Sh450,000. Kamau's motivation is to provide an efficient and eco-friendly mode of transport, reducing reliance on conventional fuels and minimising environmental impact. \"The vehicle doesn't use fuel thus reducing carbon emissions as well as making it cost-effective, during this time when the cost of fuel is high,\" he said. The innovation is yet to be released into the market. Kamau cited the high cost of e-mobility equipment used to assemble the vehicle as a major challenge in the mass production of tuk-tuks. To make it cheaper to manufacture, the professor urged the government to come up with policies that support adoption of e-mobility and eliminate excise duty on body parts. \"The tuk-tuks are made of steel, which is quite expensive. If only its cost and that of other accessories can be lowered, the mass production of the tuk-tuks can be cheaper and easy.\" Spaces in the Special Economic Zones should be set aside for the assembly of body parts. \"E-mobility is the way to go and the government has been categorical that by 2027, most of the vehicles will be electric. In order to achieve this, there should be policies in place that support e-mobility,\" Kamau said. He said county governments should allow tuk-tuks to park and operate freely within CBDs as they are beneficial to carbon credit trading. Kenya is looking to fully move towards the use of electric buses by 2027. This is in line with the government’s agenda of transforming the transport industry through reduction of carbon emissions to mitigate effects of climate change. Former Investment, Trade and Industrialisation CS Rebecca Maino said to achieve this, the ministry launched the Draft National Electric Mobility Policy. The policy proposes the establishment of incentives to increase the uptake of electric vehicles. This includes the reduction of excise duty on electric-powered vehicles to 10 per cent, as in the Finance Act, 2023. Other efforts, she said, are the revision of the Integrated National Transport Policy (2009) to accommodate electric vehicles and the requisite infrastructure. The development of an Automotive Policy to stimulate assembly and manufacture, with a specific focus on electric vehicles, also mark part of the efforts.",

    "text": "[PETA](http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/user/peta)on Thu, 12/19/2024 - 16:06\nAustin, Texas – A 17-year-old Vista Ridge High School student is facing charges for allegedly fatally poisoning a goat named Willie housed at the school’s Future Farmers of America (FFA) facility by force-feeding him pesticide\nDecember 18, 2024\nSara Groves 202-483-7382\nAustin, Texas – A 17-year-old Vista Ridge High School student is facing charges for allegedly fatally poisoning a goat named Willie housed at the school’s Future Farmers of America (FFA) facility by force-feeding him pesticide. In response, TeachKind, PETA’s humane education division, sent a letter today to Leander Independent School District Superintendent Bruce Gearing, urging him to ensure that no other animals suffer and die as a result of its agriculture program—whether on school grounds or in slaughterhouses, where many animals used in FFA programs typically end up. TeachKind is calling on the district to pivot to a vegan agriculture program that teaches students to grow nourishing fruits and vegetables and to send surviving animals to reputable sanctuaries—and PETA will donate $5,000 to help get the plant-powered program off the ground.\n“Agriculture programs that use animals demand that students emotionally disconnect from the thinking, feeling beings they’ve spent months caring for, and as Willie’s death shows, the consequences can be devastating,” says PETA Vice President of Youth Programs Marta Holmberg. “TeachKind is urging educators to ensure that no more lives are lost on their watch by embracing a vegan program that helps students cultivate crops and compassion.”\nPETA points out that goats are highly social herd animals who are happiest in the company of others, can become depressed if they’re separated or isolated from their companions, and have been known to wag their tails and jump for joy when pleased. Goats and other animals used for FFA projects are typically sold at auction once projects are completed and hauled off for slaughter or to be used as “breeders” until their exhausted bodies give out and they, too, are killed.\nPETA—whose motto reads, in part, that “animals are not ours to eat or abuse in any other way”— [points out that](http://www.peta.org/media/news-releases/poisoning-of-goat-prompts-petas-offer-of-5000-for-local-school-district-to-switch-to-plants-only-ag-program/) [Every Animal Is Someone](https://headlines.peta.org/every-animal-is-someone/) and offers free [Empathy Kits](https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/every-animal-is-someone.pdf) for people who need a lesson in kindness and free [Vegan Starter Kits](https://www.peta.org/living/food/free-vegan-starter-kit/) for anyone looking to make the switch.

We saw [reports](https://lawandcrime.com/crime/beloved-show-goat-willie-died-after-being-force-fed-poison-by-teen-who-said-she-tried-to-kill-the-animal-twice-police/) out of Cedar Park that a 17-year-old [Vista Ridge High School](http://www.peta.org/media/news-releases/poisoning-of-goat-prompts-petas-offer-of-5000-for-local-school-district-to-switch-to-plants-only-ag-program/) student faces a felony charge for allegedly poisoning Willie, a goat who was being raised by a classmate at the Vista Ridge Future Farmers of America (FFA) agricultural facility. The violent attack was [apparently](https://www.kxan.com/news/crime/vista-ridge-high-goat-death/) captured on a surveillance video that appears to depict the teen entering Willie’s pen, straddling him, and forcing an alleged pesticide-filled syringe into his mouth multiple times as he attempts to flee. Willie reportedly suffered for 21 hours, [convulsing and bellowing in pain](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/local/2024/12/06/vista-ridge-high-school-student-accused-of-killing-goat-at-school-barn/76822155007/) before dying in his guardian’s arms.\nWhile Willie’s life can never be replaced, this tragedy was entirely preventable. Since the numerous security measures provided, including cameras and teacher supervision, failed to protect Willie, we appeal to your sense of safety and compassion and urge you to stop using animals in your agricultural programs. PETA stands ready to donate $5,000 to Vista Ridge High School to develop a plant-based agriculture program if you commit to no longer using animals.\nChanging times call for a reevaluation of agriculture programs and reflection on the underlying messages they send to students, namely that it’s acceptable to exploit others for awards, accolades, and money or to send their animal friends—even if they’ve cared for and bonded with them for months—to a violent, terrifying death at a slaughterhouse. Many young people join animal agriculture programs because they’re interested in animals, but these programs demand that they develop a harmful disconnect from those very animals, the consequences of which can be detrimental.\nIt’s critical to note that the suffering that Willie experienced mirrors what he likely would have endured at the end of the program. When FFA projects conclude, most animals involved are sold at auction—typically for slaughter or to be used as “breeders,” only to be sent to slaughter once their bodies are no longer viewed as profitable. Often, FFA program participants don’t fully grasp the devastating fate an animal will face after being sold, and if they did, they’d likely decline to participate. As students process Willie’s painful and prolonged death, we encourage you to have an honest dialog with them about what animals are subjected to at a slaughterhouse. Presenting young people with broad and accurate details about an issue promotes critical thinking skills; giving them tools to enact change based on their findings empowers them to become lifelong learners.\nWe urge you to adopt 21 st -century programming, which recognizes that the future of agriculture relies on growing crops instead of raising and killing animals for food to combat the climate catastrophe. Worldwide, farming communities are shifting their practices toward sustainability and compassion by recognizing the devastating impacts of animal agriculture.\nAt TeachKind, we’re [former teachers](https://www.peta.org/teachkind/about/) , so we know that educators have the best intentions and want to build on students’ natural interest in animals to cultivate qualities like responsibility and care for other sentient beings, as well as help them develop career skills. But we can share these essential lessons in ways that teach students that animals are some one , not some thing . Your agricultural program could help students better prepare for the future by teaching them how to produce healthy fruits and vegetables, supporting their growth into compassionate, responsible individuals who will make the world a better place for everyone . Humane farming education, like the [LEAP program, an innovative agriculture initiative](https://youtu.be/r4pw6zpvGCU) in which students study animal care and our food system in a sustainable, compassionate way, provides learners with modern information about our changing world while preparing them to meet the needs of our future. Plus, extending respect and kindness to all animals would be a seamless way to expand on your educational goal of supporting students to embody your district’s [10 Ethical Principles](https://www.leanderisd.org/guidingdocuments/) and preparing graduates to be Compassionate Community Contributors.\nOn behalf of PETA and our many members and supporters who live in Texas, will Leander ISD commit to ending the use of animals in its agriculture program? Our staff is on standby to discuss this issue with you further and to assist with this compassionate change.\nWe thank you in advance for your consideration of this important matter and look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.",
