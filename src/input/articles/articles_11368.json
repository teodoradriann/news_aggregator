La FGR montó un operativo en alrededor de la finca de San Julián, ubicada en el campestre Huertos del Pedregal, en la comunidad de Bellavista, al oriente de la capital sinaloense, desde la tarde del miércoles 21 de agosto. En dicha finca, presuntamente ocurrió también el asesinato de Héctor Melesio Cuen Ojeda, luego de que la Fiscalía echara abajo la versión y video en el que supuestamente fue asesinado en una gasolinera.

    "text": "How rock-bottom prices drive shortages of generic drugs used in hospitals Steven Coventry spent 20 years at the Akorn pharmaceutical factory in Decatur, Ill., and worked his way up to operations manager. The plant closed abruptly in February 2023, when the company shut down its four manufacturing facilities. In Decatur, Akorn laid off 400 employees. But Coventry went back to work at the Decatur plant last summer because new owners hired him to essentially resume his old job and bring it back to life. It was a surreal scene. \"Coffee mugs were left on tabletops, personal items,\" he said. \"It was kind of like a ghost town and a little sad to go through and see, you know, people's lives just basically upended.\" Coventry says the factory used to make 100 different products. The shutdown contributed to new drug shortages and made some others worse. He's glad to be back. \"It's like home. It's where I grew up,\" he said. \"I was really driven to ... bring it back up to its glory days of what it was in the past.\" Low prices bring unintended consequences When Americans think of drug prices, they usually think that they're too high. And for name brand drugs, that's often the case compared with the rest of the world. But when it comes to [generic sterile injectables](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/federal-policies-to-address-persistent-generic-drug-shortages/), medicines that are workhorses in hospitals, the opposite problem is true. They can be too cheap. \"For off-patent generic drugs, especially those used in the hospital setting, Americans actually pay lower prices than Europe does,\" said [Rena Conti](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/), a professor at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. Companies compete with each other to offer hospital purchasers the lowest price, driving the prices to rock bottom. Over time, prices can get so low that it doesn't always make good business sense for the companies to keep making some drugs. So they stop. \"It's the same issues that we've been dealing with for many years, especially with these older generic drugs that are having fewer and fewer manufacturers making them,\" [Valerie Jensen](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-insight/fda-insight-drug-shortages-and-covid-19), associate director for drug shortages at the Food and Drug Administration, told NPR. \"There isn't a lot of buffer when something goes wrong on the manufacturing line.\" With fewer suppliers of generic drugs, a weather event – like the tornado that ripped through a Pfizer facility earlier this year or Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017 – can wreak havoc on an already fragile system. On top of that, the bargain-basement prices don't encourage manufacturers to invest in new equipment and other things that would keep quality high and avert recalls and shutdowns. \"I would say, fundamentally, economics is causing this problem, and this problem is long-standing,\" Conti said. \"We've been dealing with periodic and, more concerningly, persistent shortages in drugs ... for the better part of a decade or a little bit more. And fundamentally, the economics of this market has to change in order to get resilient supply.\" What happened to Akorn? Erin Fox is a hospital pharmacist who oversees purchasing drugs, medication safety and more for the University of Utah Health System. Like her peers across the country, she was caught off guard by Akorn's demise last winter. \"We actually got an email from our representative and he just said, 'Hey, we just walked in today. We learned that we're closing. Everyone has to leave today,' \" she said. \"So it was very abrupt.\" The company went bankrupt after operating at a loss \"for some time\" and failing to get acquired by a company that would cover its liabilities, Akorn's CEO said in a [letter to employees last February](https://herald-review.com/read-it-akorn-layoff-letter-to-employees/pdf_833fc5c8-b2e4-11ed-b91b-175da6b5f0d1.html) that was obtained by the Herald and Review in Decatur. As soon as Fox got the news, she and her colleagues at University of Utah Health started poring over lists of medicines to see how the shutdown would affect them. Fox's team asked their Akorn rep if they could use what they had on shelves, and the answer that day was \"yes.\" The relief wouldn't last. Six weeks later, Akorn recalled all the products it had made. There was nothing wrong with the drugs, and they hadn't expired. But no one was left at Akorn to answer the phone or initiate a specific recall if a problem did emerge. \"So you can't use it anymore,\" she said of Akorn's product line. \"There's no gray area there.\" Staffers at University of Utah Health had to log an extra 250 hours right away to deal with the fallout, taking Akorn products off shelves and finding replacements. Products included things like the opioid sufentanil, which is often used in epidurals during labor and delivery. There are alternatives, but anesthesiologists prefer working with what they know best to reduce the chances for medical errors. Akorn was also the only supplier of dimercaprol, an injectable antidote for lead poisoning. There are oral alternatives, but some patients are too sick to take them. Rising from Akorn's ashes A few months after Akorn shut down, Rising Pharmaceuticals acquired the former Akorn factory in Illinois. Rising plans to manufacture several of the generic products Akorn used to make there. \"Our intention is to really focus on those products of greatest need in the U.S. pharma marketplace and bring those back on,\" Ira Baeringer, Rising's chief operating officer, told NPR. These include injectable forms of the antibiotic levofloxacin, the anesthetic tetracaine and droperidol, a medication to prevent nausea. Rising also plans to bring back several former Akorn eyedrop products in short supply. But getting the factory up and running again is tricky because the water, air and mechanical systems had been shut down for so long. Normally, those systems run continuously. \"That takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of effort,\" Baeringer said. \"And once a facility is shut down, it means all those systems have to be revalidated. And so that's the process that we're going through right now to bring ... this facility back up into commercial production.\" He said Rising hopes the factory will be making products by the second half of 2024. But what will keep Rising from going the same way Akorn did? \"Honestly, there's probably very little that can happen to prevent it,\" said Fox of University of Utah Health, explaining that it will depend on many factors, including which products Rising chooses and how it prices them. \"So I think it's really hard to know if they'll be able to make it a success or not.\" She said she hopes Rising can get a leg up from \"people that want to keep manufacturing in the U.S.\" The Biden administration has taken steps toward mitigating drug shortages, including expanding its use of the Defense Production Act to bolster domestic manufacturing of medicines deemed critical for national defense. The administration is also investing $35 million in domestic manufacturing of key starting materials for sterile injectable drugs. \"I'm hopeful,\" Fox said of the Illinois factory. \"But we'll just have to see how it works out.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

    "text": "Hong Kong. El Partido Cívico, una de las principales fuerzas prodemocracia de Hong Kong, cerró definitivamente su sede, al cabo de un procedimiento de autodisolución que Alan Leong, uno de sus fundadores, comenta aliviado y fatalista.\n\"Los tiempos cambiaron\", dijo Leong a la AFP, en una de las varias entrevistas que concedió a lo largo del proceso de disolución.\nFundado en 2006, el Partido Cívico, apodado el \"partido de los abogados\", incluía juristas, académicos y otros profesionales que promovían la democratización de Hong Kong, llegando a ser el segundo mayor partido opositor del consejo legislativo.\nDesde que China impuso una dura ley de seguridad nacional que acabó con la disidencia tras las masivas protestas prodemocracia de 2019 en Hong Kong, el Partido Cívico ha tenido tres miembros encarcelados, sus cargos electos perdieron sus escaños y un ex legislador figura entre las personas más buscadas de la ciudad.\nAnte esa situación, en mayo el partido decidió autodisolverse.\nEn los últimos meses donó sus muebles de oficina y los altavoces de campaña y arrancó los recortes de diarios y emblemas partidistas de las paredes. Leong conservó solamente seis insignias de color verde y morado con la fecha 19.03.06, día de fundación del partido.\n\"Lo que sobró de esos pines iniciales es todo lo que tenemos\", contó a la AFP.\nLeong mencionó la \"realidad política\" de Hong Kong y la falta de dinero y moral entre las principales causas del cierre del partido.\n\"Nunca dudé de la capacidad de la gente de Hong Kong de gobernar Hong Kong, pero hay cosas que escapan a nuestro control\", expresó.\n\"Algunos de nuestros legisladores siguen detenidos. Esa es la realidad. Eso también explica por qué estamos cerrando\", dijo.\nResiliencia a prueba\nNacido de un grupo defensor de la reforma electoral, el Partido Cívico fue fundado por cuatro abogados que eran legisladores: Ronny Tong, Margaret Ng, Audrey Eu y Leong.\nReclutó a figuras de élite de distintas profesiones, como el ingeniero civil Albert Lai.\nHong Kong fue transferida de mando británico a China en 1997, con la promesa de Pekín de preservar sus libertades y la meta de tener dirigentes locales y legisladores electos democráticamente.\n\"Había pasado una década desde la transferencia de Hong Kong, pero Pekín no cumplió su promesa de sufragio universal en la ciudad (...) Eso fue lo que motivó la formación del partido\", contó Lai a AFP.\nEn la actualidad, el jefe del ejecutivo de Hong Kong sigue siendo escogido por personas leales a China.\nEn 2004, China impuso más obstáculos a la reforma electoral, lo que alimentó una disputa ya en marcha sobre la \"miniconstitución\" de Hong Kong, y llevó a cientos de miles a manifestarse a favor de una mayor democratización.\n\"La resiliencia de Hong Kong ha sido probada al límite\", escribió Ng en el manifiesto de fundación del partido.\nEn 2010, el partido colaboró con la Liga de Socialdemócratas para provocar unas elecciones parciales con la renuncia de cinco legisladores prodemocracia.\nLos partidos dijeron que querían crear un referendo simbólico al permitir a los votantes demostrar su apoyo a la democratización, algo que China condenó como \"inconstitucional\".\nRonny Tong, un cofundador que abandonó el partido en 2015 para formar otro grupo, dijo estar alarmado en su momento por su \"radicalización\".\n\"Fue un acto de confrontación\", señaló Tong, integrante del actual gabinete, a un medio progubernamental en junio. Lamentó entonces su papel en la fundación del partido.\nSolo \"patriotas\"\nLa televisión estatal de Pekín llamó este año al partido una \"organización desestabilizadora anti China\".\nSiete miembros del Partido Cívico han sido enjuiciados por dirigir las protestas democráticas, recaudar fondos para los manifestantes y participar en una primaria no oficial para escoger candidatos legislativos, algo que el gobierno de Hong Kong califica como crimen de seguridad nacional.\nPara fines de 2021, todos sus miembros en los consejos legislativo y distrital de la ciudad habían sido removidos bajo la doctrina china de \"patriotas\", en la que cualquiera que sea considerado como políticamente desleal es separado de cargos públicos en Hong Kong.\nDennis Kwok, uno de los legisladores del Partido Cívico removido de su escaño, vive en el exterior y es buscado por \"colusión\", con una recompensa por un millón de dólares hongkoneses (128.000 dólares) sobre su cabeza. Con el cierre del partido y su renuncia como líder, Leong dice estar \"aliviado porque puedo dejar ese fardo\".\nSin embargo, señaló, \"si llegara un momento en que profesionales o similares pudieran volver a servir en Hong Kong (...) estoy seguro de que nacerá otro partido\".",

    "text": "Boas memórias! Sobis visita o Inter antes de jogo contra o São Paulo\nEm 2006, ex-atacante foi fez dois gols diante do Tricolor na partida de ida da final da Libertadores. Agora, traz bons ventos para o Colorado\nO Inter recebeu uma visita ilustre no Centro de Treinamento Parque Gigante nesta quinta-feira (19). O ídolo colorado Rafael Sobis compareceu no local para conversar com dirigentes, comissão técnica e jogadores. Ele aproveitou para passar energia positiva para o restante da temporada.\nO ex-atacante bateu um papo com o diretor esportivo D'Alessandro, com quem atuou no Internacional. Sobis também conversou com o executivo André Mazzuco, o preparador de goleiros Léo Martins, o meia Alan Patrick e o zagueiro Mercado, entre outros atletas.\nA relação de Sobis com o Inter é intensa. Em 2006, o então atacante colorado foi o grande personagem da vitória sobre o São Paulo por 2 a 1, no Morumbis, no jogo de ida da final da Libertadores. Afinal, ele fez os dois gols dos gaúchos na partida, que ajudaram a equipe a conquistar o seu primeiro título da competição.\nDessa maneira, Sobis pode trazer energia positiva para os jogadores colorados. Isso porque o próximo adversário do Inter no Campeonato Brasileiro é justamente o São Paulo, também no Morumbis. O duelo será às 18h30 (de Brasília) e vale muito para as duas equipes, afinal elas brigam por um lugar na próxima Libertadores. Enquanto o Tricolor está em quinto com 44, o Colorado está em oitavo, com 38, mas com dois jogos a menos.\nInter segue preparação para o duelo no Morumbis\nCom os bons fluidos de Sobis, o Inter seguiu sua preparação para o duelo no Morumbis. Para o confronto, o técnico Roger Machado não poderá contar com o jovem Gabriel Carvalho, que levou o terceiro cartão amarelo e está suspenso. Wanderson, Enner Valencia, Bruno Henrique, Gustavo Prato e Hyoran brigam pela vaga no time titular.\nAssim, o Inter deve ir a campo com a seguinte escalação: Rochet; Bruno Gomes, Vitão, Mercado e Bernabei; Fernando, Thiago Maia, Gustavo Prado, Alan Patrick e Wesley; Borré.\nSiga nosso conteúdo nas redes sociais: Bluesky, Threads, Twitter, Instagram e Facebook.",

    "text": "Positiva sesión para el Dow Jones , que acabó la sesión del jueves 28 de diciembre con leves ascensos del 0,14% , hasta los 37.710,10 puntos .\nEl Dow Jones Industrial Average marcó la cifra máxima de 37.778,85 puntos y la cifra mínima de 37.650,98 puntos . El rango de cotización para el selectivo entre su punto más alto y el más bajo (máximo-mínimo) durante este día se situó en el 0,34% .\nSi consideramos los datos de los últimos siete días, el índice acumula un incremento del 1,69% , de modo que desde hace un año mantiene aún una ganancia del 13,44% .\ny un 18,51% por encima de su cotización mínima en lo que va de año (31.819,14 puntos).\n¿Qué es el Dow Jones? El Dow Jones Industrial Average, llamado también \"el Dow\", es un índice bursátil compuesto por 30 de las empresas más grandes de Estados Unidos. El valor del Dow se calcula mediante la suma de los precios de las acciones de estas 30 empresas y se utiliza como un indicador clave del estado de la economía del mercado de valores estadounidense. El índice fue creado en 1896 por el editor del Wall Street Journal, Charles Dow e inicialmente contenía solo 12 empresas. El número de empresas se aumentó a 30 en 1928 y ese número se ha mantenido desde entonces.\nEl Dow Jones es importante porque inversores, analistas y medios de comunicación de todo el mundo siguen de cerca su evolución para conocer el estado del mercado de EE.UU., básicamente porque al incluir a algunas de las empresas más influyentes de los sectores industriales, financieros y de servicios públicos, el Dow no deja de ser un indicador crucial o de la economía estadounidense en su conjunto. Aunque se piensa que es el más antiguo de Estados Unidos, el primero fue el Dow Jones Transportation Average, creado en 1886.\nAdemás, el Dow también sirve como un barómetro de la confianza de los inversores en la economía y en la política económica del gobierno de Estados Unidos. Cuando éste sube, se considera que la confianza también lo hace, mientras que una caída del índice puede implicar preocupaciones sobre el futuro de la economía.\n¿Quieres publicitar en Cronista.com?

    "title": "Dad's Idea Has Worked Too Well!, by Dr. Robert Wallace | Creators Syndicate",
    "text": "DR. WALLACE: I'm a teenage boy who's always looking to make some extra side money. I mentioned this to my father, and he came up with an idea recently that the two of us could clean out our garage and donate a lot of old items we don't need or use anymore to free up space. It's a rather large garage and our family has only one car, so there's plenty of extra room.\nHe then suggested I go out on a Saturday morning and knock on the doors of all our neighbors, letting them know that we have extra storage space in our garage and would store the first item or small box for anyone free, then work out a reasonable rate for any other Items they may want to store with us.\nThis was about a month and a half ago. Things started slowly, but then I started getting calls from neighbors, and before too long we started working out a system to organize our garage into subsets and store various items for many of our neighbors. They were all too happy to pay us what they felt were reasonable rates for this extra storage space.\nNow less than two months later, my father's idea is working out too well! We filled up all the available space, even after building a small wooden rack to increase the height of the storage space available to us. At this point, I'm still getting some offers as the word of mouth has spread quickly around our community.\nI hate to turn down new business, but I'm very happy with the amount of monthly income my father and I are receiving for this extra storage space. He is putting half the money into a family \"vacation account\" and giving me the other half as direct income that I can save or spend as I would like, so this has been an awesome venture for me.\nMy question for you is one regarding my ideas for expansion. Do you think I should try to figure out a way to store more items or just be happy with what I have at this point? — Our New Business Is Flourishing, via email\nOUR NEW BUSINESS IS FLOURISHING: I think it depends on your father's perspective, but I see no problem with running a few new ideas by him.\nHe will, of course, want to monitor the amount of time you're spending on this venture in context with your schoolwork and other personal responsibilities.\nBut if you still have some discretionary time available, I have a couple of ideas for you. Since you and your father did a great job cleaning out and organizing your own family garage, you could spread word to your customers that you are willing to come in and customize anyone's garage with a custom-suited makeover. You and your father, or you and another friend, could do all the physical work — moving things, hauling away things that need to be donated or taken out as trash — and this would perhaps provide you another income opportunity.\nSecondarily, depending upon how much space you may have in your family's backyard or side yards, you and your father could discuss purchasing a standalone shed that you could use for extra storage to allow you to take on a few new customers. Alternatively, if there are public storage units available in your community you feel you could fill via piecemeal amounts of items from your neighborhood, you could consider renting a unit. You'd then sell sublet space at a higher per-square-foot rate so you could turn a profit if you're able to keep it mostly full going forward.\nWHY SHOULD AGE MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL?\nDR. WALLACE: I've noticed you often give advice to teenagers, even ones who are 18 or 19 years old and perhaps already during their first year in college, to wait a bit longer before considering marriage.\nWhy is this? Don't you feel that an 18- or 19-year-old is as capable of making a good decision regarding marriage as a 23- or 24-year-old would be? It seems to me that if you find someone who is \"the one,\" age shouldn't matter at all. — I Find Your Logic Curious, via email\nI FIND YOUR LOGIC CURIOUS: Marriage indeed is a very personal decision for the two individuals involved no matter what age they may be. However, with extensive experience dealing with teenagers, I can tell you that there are times when infatuation can be mistaken as love due to the inexperience of one or both partners.\nI do agree there are instances that work out quite well for some teenage marriages, but statistics show that the success rate at this age range is markedly below those who wait to wed until their early to mid-twenties or later.\nDr. Robert Wallace welcomes questions from readers. Although he is unable to reply to all of them individually, he will answer as many as possible in this column. Email him at [[email protected]](https://www.creators.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
