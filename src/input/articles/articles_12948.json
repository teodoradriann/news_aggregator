    "title": "Founder resolutions: Six Canadian tech leaders share their goals for 2024",
    "text": "For many, the start of a new calendar year is a time of reflection and goal setting. To help you kickstart a new year with renewed enthusiasm, find out what the founders of these Canadian tech businesses have to say about their New Year’s resolutions, and what they predict will be the technology winner of 2024.\nFounder resolutions: yes or no?\nThey’re not for everyone, but for founders who regularly set goals for their companies and teams, January 1st seems like a good time for a check-in.\n“I like New Year’s Resolutions a lot,” said Vin Verma, founder of\nFutureland. “It’s cool that around this time of year, many are asking questions like, ‘What went well?’, ‘what must change?’ There’s a community feeling and support for these kinds of questions that don’t exist at other points in a year.”\n“It’s not realistic to achieve all of your goals exactly when you want to achieve them.”\nHorizon co-founder Peter Kieltyka echoed Verma’s sentiment. “I think the process of thinking about [New Year’s] resolutions is actually a good thing,” he said, “because they give us a moment to reflect and introspect on ourselves which ultimately leads to learning how to improve and accept ourselves.”\nBut drafting resolutions is one thing; following through is a different ballgame.\nVerma pointed out that seeing resolutions to the end is “entirely dependent on your personal systems. Things like your daily habits, how effectively you’ve set your goals, how regularly you review those goals … all of that leads up to the realization of your resolutions … I also think it’s OK for resolutions to transfer from one year to the next. It’s not realistic to achieve all of your goals exactly when you want to achieve them. Failing to achieve your goals, reflecting, adjusting, and then continuing to tackle them until you see them through to the end is how it goes. It’s a natural part of the process.”\nWhile Daniel Patricio, founder of\nAbra, finds resolutions helpful, he doesn’t think the start of the calendar year is the best time to pick them up. “I try to think in many-year cycles with goals that don’t change much … Maybe it’s because I have young kids now, but September or spring feel like the more natural starting points for me,” he said.\nSimran Kang, the co-founder of\nMyFO, a subscription-based software for family offices, believes that if you’re waiting for the new year to set goals, you’re too late. “If you are in tech and wait for a new year to make resolutions, you are probably missing the mark and far behind,” she said. “Things move fast and you have to pivot accordingly.”\nWhat’s one thing you learned last year that you’ll bring into 2024?\n“I had my second daughter in 2023, and as I return to work in January I have to be ruthless with prioritization and how I spend my time,” said Erin Bury, the co-founder of\nWillful and someone who has spoken openly about the challenges of accessing parental support as an entrepreneur in Canada.\nShe continued: “I saw a meme recently that said the only people who will remember that you worked late are your children, and it really hit home. For me, 2024 is all about working smarter. It’s not about hours spent, it’s about impact, and that means saying no to a lot of things to say yes to the ones that really matter.”\nFor Verma, who has developed a habit-tracking app, it’s all about simplicity. This year, he’s avoiding complex plans and focusing on ones that are simple, easy to remember, and easy to understand.\n“To make a simple plan, for whatever I’m working on,” he said, “I write down its current state in 2-3 sentences, then I write down the desired future state in 2-3 sentences. Once that’s done, getting from the current state to the future state becomes my primary focus. I try to do as much as I can to increase the velocity of that happening.”\nAbra’ Patricio reminded us to “listen to actions, not words.” He said, “It’s important to not be distracted by sentiments and commentary … stay grounded in what your customers are actually doing.”\nIn 2023, Wealthsimple CEO Michael Katchen learned about the importance of community and excellence. “I was inspired by\nWill Guidara’s book, Unreasonable Hospitality. It’s the story of what it took to become the #1 restaurant in the world. The day-in-day-out pursuit of excellence. Lots of ideas I plan to take back to Wealthsimple in 2024.”\nAnnual plans can often get trumped by more urgent tasks. How do you keep your team on track throughout the year?\nNo one likes to admit it, but as humans, we get sidetracked easily.\nPatricio, who founded Abra, a tool that helps Shopify merchants make discounts harder to resist, said it best: “Think and debate hard about the most important thing. Equally as challenging but important is keeping the most important thing the most important thing.”\nBury uses the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) to keep the Willful team on track. “EOS includes a pretty rigorous quarterly goal-setting framework, and those goals ladder up to the one-year plan,” she said. “We ensure people stay on track by constantly reiterating that one-year plan; and meeting with team members weekly to review progress towards their quarterly goals.”\nCircling back to simplicity, Verma, founder of Futureland, holds weekly team meetings focused on his current state, future state method.\nHe also suggests working fast and making decisions in the moment. “If something can be done while you are on a call, just finish it on the call,” he said. “Reduce the scope of projects to ship them faster. I find working like this reduces damage from tasks that derail focus [and] reduces unnecessary delays … One other thing, making high-quality sleep part of our team’s culture. The way we work should never disrupt or eat into our sleep schedule. It’s impossible to focus and be creative with poor sleep.”\nDoes your company have office pups? If so, can you share a photo or two?\nSpeaking of distractions: meet Agatha, Casanova, Athena, Henry, Basil, Ruadh, Shep, and Ginger.\nOur founders were all too happy to share photos of their office pets. We received so many photos this time that we almost had to cut some out.\nBut we didn’t. You’re welcome.\nAll our founders manage remote or hybrid teams so office pets live in cleverly named Discord and Slack channels like Willful’s #PawsitiveAttitude.\nKang of MyFO told us their chief people officer, Henry, is an advocate for unlimited treats, which we can only hope applies to both pets and people.\nWhat did your inbox look like on January 1st? Zero or 2,000?\nThere are three types of email people: those who clear their inbox every day, those who know they never will, and those who try and fail but keep hoping. Which one are you?\nWhat technology do you predict will win in 2024?\nYou might be surprised by the answers. Just kidding. Half of our founders said AI.\n“Contrarian take (not!): Gen AI”\n– Michael Katchen, Wealthsimple\n“Hard for me to say anything but AI, and the new functionality it can enable in software and hardware.”\n– Vin Verma, Futureland\n“AI-enabled technologies built by founders with great founder market fit.”\n– Simran Kang, MyFO\n“Blockchains.”\n– Peter Kieltyka, Horizon Blockchain Games\n“Something boring like spreadsheets … The winners from this startup vintage will be those, rather than folks that raised the most money with something AI related.”\n– Daniel Patricio, Abra\n“Smart identity verification”\n– Erin Bury, Willful\nWhat’s one personal goal, habit, or behaviour you want to develop in 2024?\nOne of the best parts about talking to founders is seeing how their work habits translate into their personal lives. Not only did founders respond to this question with interesting goals, but the goals were also specific, measurable, and achievable.\nKieltyka (Horizon) wants to build 20 minutes of strength training into his daily schedule and Kang (MyFO) wants to get back to the gym five times a week. Verma (Futureland) said this year he’d like to log 300 hours of training in jiu-jitsu (100 more hours than he did in 2023).\nIf you’re a morning person, you may relate to Patricio (Abra) who wants to continue working out first thing in the morning, or Katchen (Wealthsimple), who wants to get back to reading first thing in the morning over a cup of coffee.\nWhat’s one big audacious business goal you want to achieve in 2024?\nYou don’t become a founder without a little bit of daring, and a lot of bits of bold. This year, our founders want to accelerate growth and change entire industries.\nKatchen said that, in 2023,\nWealthsimple clients earned millions of dollars from the platform’s high-interest chequing account, and thousands of Canadians trusted Wealthsimple to help save for their first home. Retail and DIY traders also benefited from the platform, accessing private investments and saving millions on commission-free transactions.\nIn five years, Katchen said Wealthsimple aims to quadruple its assets under management to $100 billion. “I’m confident we can get there,” he said.\nKang plans to grow MyFO’s revenue by 20 times, and Verma wants to grow Futureland’s users to 100,000.\nDid you know that electronic signatures cannot legalize a will in Ontario? Bury will continue working to change that this year with\nWillful. “It’s 2023, why the heck are we still signing paper wills like it’s 1923?” she asked.\nKieltyka, the co-founder of\nHorizon Blockchain Games, will focus 2024 on building “a world-class software infrastructure company that helps power the next generation of the Internet.”\nGo get ‘em.\nBrought to you by AWS.\nAWS helps more startups launch, build, and succeed than any other cloud provider.\nStart your cloud journey today.",

However, models are currently predicting that the Cincinnati and NKY regions will have a “very high” chance of significant impact from the storm.\nAs of Thursday, the NWS said the track of the system is uncertain, and it is currently too early to pinpoint how strong the storm will be.\nA smaller amount of snow is also expected Thursday evening into Friday morning with the possibility of around a half inch of accumulation.\nThe NWS also shared some tips on how to best handle strong winter weather:\nWith a potentially significant winter storm on the horizon Sunday into Monday, it is a good time to review winter storm preparedness actions and terminology. #INwx pic.twitter.com/YetWE1PEIl\n— NWS Indianapolis (@NWSIndianapolis) January 1, 2025",

    "text": "Speak Up Women Global 2024 January Virtual Conference Produced by Jennifer S. Wilkov Awards the USTA the Make A Difference Award for the US Open's 50 Years of Equal Prize Money for Women and Men\nNEW YORK - Feb. 29, 2024 - PRLog -- Jennifer S. Wilkov, multi #1 international best-selling award-winning author, founder, and CEO of Speak Up World LLC, ( http://www.SpeakUpWomen.com ), successfully produced the Global 2024 January Speak Up Women Conference virtually online on Saturday, January 27, 2024. Speakers and participants from across the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, and others engaged in virtual talks about the importance of speaking up in women's personal and professional relationships and for others and causes she cares about to create change where change is necessary.\nThe Make A Difference Award was presented at the end of the conference by Ms. Wilkov to recognize the USTA for the US Open's 50 Years of Equal Prize Money for women and men milestone in 2023.\nAs the producer and presenter of the Make A Difference Award during the Global 2024 January Speak Up Women Virtual Conference, Wilkov said, \"As a huge fan of tennis worldwide since I was a little girl, the USTA has always held a special place in my heart. When they reached this incredible milestone of 50 Years of Equal Prize Money for women and men in tennis at the US Open, they reminded us that the USTA and the US Open was the first sporting event in history to offer equal prize money for women and men competitors. It would take the other grand slams more than 30 years to offer the same. There was no question in my mind that I was going to award the Make A Difference Award to them. As I said in my talk, now, more than ever, it's our time to speak up.\"\n\"It is truly an honor for the USTA to be recognized with The Make a Difference Award,\" said Nicole Kankam, USTA Managing Director, Pro Tennis Marketing and Entertainment. \"We are proud that, thanks to the trailblazing efforts of the iconic champion Billie Jean King, the US Open was the first of tennis' major events to award equal prize money in 1973. In celebrating that momentous milestone, we salute all of the pioneering women in our sport who have worked so hard to level the playing field for all. This honor is truly an honor we share with all of them.\"\nConversations at the Global 2024 January Speak Up Women Virtual Conference included discussions on the importance of speaking up at home, in the workplace, and for others and causes she cares about plus talks about speaking up on purpose, being you and how to stop playing small, authenticity, curiosity, speaking up after trauma, having tough conversations and tough talk in tech, manifesting your destiny, infusing humor into the workplace, protecting your potential, unleashing your full expression, propelling your venture, that how you show up without saying a word matters, and speaking up when it counts most. The conference concluded with a rousing talk from Kimberly Mylls and Ms. Wilkov as they relaunched their principles and philosophy about putting boys before business from their book Boys Before Business which they are rereleasing in February 2024.\nMs. Wilkov emceed the conference and leads the Speak Up Women Community platform, the #1 search result according to Google out of the more than 1.5 - 3 trillion results daily for the search term \"Speak Up Women,\" above Forbes, The Harvard Business Review, CNBC, Diversity Woman Magazine, The UN, The California Conference for Women, and more.

    "text": "Astronomía\nInvitan a disfrutar las últimas noches de febrero que finaliza con una alineación planetaria inusual de 7 planetas en el cielo\nAunque es común ver dos o tres planetas alrededor del atardecer, hay ocasiones únicas en las que se pueden observar a simple vista cuatro o cinco planetas brillantes al mismo tiempo, y otros dos con la ayuda de equipos especiales.\nEste ha sido el caso del mes de febrero de 2025, un periodo durante el cual la mayoría de las noches, cuando el clima lo ha permitido, han brindado un espectáculo inigualable con varios planetas brillando en el cielo nocturno.\nEstos eventos, conocidos popularmente como \"desfiles de planetas\" o \"alineamientos planetarios\", generan un gran interés público. Aunque no son extremadamente raros, valen la pena ser observados ya que no ocurren todos los años.\nLos términos \"desfile de planetas\" o \"alineamiento planetario\" no son técnicos en astronomía, donde la palabra correcta para estos eventos es \"apulso\", que se refiere a los momentos en que varios objetos en el cielo parecen estar más cerca.\nA medida que los planetas de nuestro sistema solar orbitan el Sol, ocasionalmente desde la perspectiva de la Tierra se alinean en el cielo y pueden ser vistos a simple vista en horas de la noche.\nEste mes de febrero ha sido especial con cinco planetas visibles sin ayuda óptica: Mercurio, Venus, Marte, Júpiter y Saturno, además de Urano y Neptuno, que son visibles con telescopio.\nEs importante resaltar que los desfiles de cuatro o cinco planetas con visibilidad óptima no ocurren todos los años. Marte, Júpiter y Saturno son frecuentemente visibles en el cielo nocturno, pero la adición de Venus y Mercurio hace a estas alineaciones particularmente notables.\nAmbos planetas orbitan más cerca del Sol que la Tierra y tienen órbitas más pequeñas y rápidas. Venus es visible solo por un par de meses cuando alcanza su mayor separación del Sol. Mercurio, que completa su órbita en solo 88 días, es visible solo por un par de semanas.\nPor eso es tan importante aprovechar las últimas noches de febrero, en las que este fenómeno tendrá la última oportunidad de ser apreciado y no volverá a ocurrir hasta octubre de 2028, cuando cinco planetas se alineen nuevamente en el cielo antes del amanecer.\nQuienes quieran observar el desfile de planetas deberán seguir las siguientes recomendaciones:\n- Estar listos apenas comience la noche, sobre las 6:45 p.m. hora del este.\n- Mirar al occidente, donde podrá apreciar a Mercurio y Saturno muy juntos y con brillo tenue.\n- Un poco más arriba estará Venús, con mucho más brillo.\n- Hacer un recorrido lineal en sentido oriente hasta localizar a Júpiter, brillante sobre sus cabezas.\n- Finalmente, un poco hacia el oriente, estará Marte, con su característico tono rojizo.\nEs importante considerar que Mercurio y Saturno tendrán una altura baja sobre el horizonte durante pocos minutos. Por esta razón, se recomienda acudir a espacios abiertos, donde los edificios, árboles y otras obstrucciones no bloqueen la vista cerca del horizonte.",

    "title": "Denver area man indicted by federal grand jury carjacking | News | denvergazette.com",
    "text": "A federal grand jury indicted a Wheat Ridge man who went on an alleged string of crimes around the metro Denver area over several months, reportedly injuring two people, carjacking three vehicles and robbing five stores. Keenan Clodfelter, 20, was indicted on 11 counts — three counts of carjacking, three counts of robbery and five counts of brandishing a firearm in relation to the carjacking and robbery charges — according to a Wednesday news release by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado. The slew of alleged crimes began on Oct. 4, when two people were carjacked in Thornton in the 9700 block of Welby Road around midnight, according to a previous news release by the Thornton Police Department. One person had their 2013 Toyota Highlander stolen by a man with a gun. Another nearby victim claimed a man with a gun attempted to steal her vehicle. As she drove away, she was shot in the arm. The Highlander was eventually found and two men fled from the front seats. Clodfelter was eventually tracked down, tazed and arrested. Another man, Jaquise Redd, 18, the driver of the Highlander, was arrested. Authorities said he had a black Springfield XD-9mm handgun, a high-capacity magazine and a 50-round box of ammunition in a bookbag. The carjacking spree picked back up on Nov. 20 when a man told the Aurora Police Department he had been carjacked by two men with guns at 1540 N. Laredo Street. Police across the metro then responded to armed robberies at a 7-Eleven located on East Quincy Avenue in Aurora and Pour Boy Liquor on 20th Avenue in Lakewood on November 20th, as well as the robbery of a Circle K on Kalamath Street in Denver on November 21st. The indictment charges Clodfelter in all of these robberies, according to the press release. The crimes ended with a shooting on Nov. 21 in the area of 44th Avenue and Youngfield Street. The suspect allegedly shot into a vehicle, breaking glass and injuring the driver. Investigators connected Clodfelter to the robberies through physical descriptions and video footage, according to arrest records. On Nov. 22, at around 2 a.m., a Lakewood officer found a Scion without plates in the parking lot of a Motel 6 at 480 Wadsworth Boulevard. The vehicle had been reported stolen from Aurora. Clodfelter and another man were found in a motel room. He was arrested by Lakewood police. Though only 20, Clodfelter's criminal history stretches well beyond the string of incidents this autumn. He has previously been charged with assault, disorderly conduct, felony menacing with a weapon, aggravated motor vehicle theft, aggravated robbery, resisting arrest, eluding and others, court records show. His Colorado driving status has been revoked since Oct. 2021. He has six prior suspensions and four prior convictions. The federal case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Lakewood Police Department, according to the release.",

    "title": "Cheese & Nightmares: Study Links Late-Night Eating to Bad Dreams",
    "text": "Could Your Late-Night Snack Be Triggering Nightmares? The Cheese and Sleep Connection A growing body of research suggests a surprising link between diet and the quality of our sleep – and specifically, that late-night consumption of dairy products, like cheese, may be associated with more frequent and disturbing dreams. While the exact mechanisms are still being investigated, recent studies point to the potential role of gut health, neurotransmitter production, and even lactose intolerance in fueling nighttime anxieties.\nFor centuries, anecdotal evidence has linked certain foods to vivid or unpleasant dreams. Now, scientists are beginning to uncover the physiological basis for these experiences. A recent study, highlighted by SciTechDaily , reveals a correlation between late-night dairy intake and an increase in reported nightmares. But why?\nThe Gut-Brain Connection and Sleep The emerging field of gut-brain research demonstrates a powerful two-way communication system between the digestive system and the central nervous system. The gut microbiome – the trillions of bacteria residing in our intestines – plays a crucial role in producing neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which are vital for regulating mood and sleep. Disruptions to the gut microbiome, potentially caused by certain foods, can therefore impact these neurotransmitter levels and, consequently, sleep patterns.\nDairy products, while nutritious, can be challenging for some individuals to digest. CBS News reports that the digestion process itself can influence sleep architecture. The body expends energy on digestion, which can interfere with the deep, restorative phases of sleep. Furthermore, undigested food particles can trigger inflammation in the gut, potentially leading to sleep disturbances.\nLactose Intolerance: A Hidden Culprit? For individuals with lactose intolerance, the effects of dairy consumption can be even more pronounced. MedicalNewsToday highlights that undigested lactose can ferment in the gut, leading to gas, bloating, and discomfort – all of which can disrupt sleep. But the connection to nightmares goes deeper. The inflammatory response triggered by lactose intolerance may also affect brain function, potentially increasing the likelihood of vivid and unsettling dreams.\nDeseret News points out that the body’s immune response to lactose intolerance can also contribute to systemic inflammation, which has been linked to various sleep disorders.\nBeyond Cheese: Other Dietary Factors Affecting Sleep While cheese has received recent attention, it’s important to remember that it’s not the only food that can impact sleep. Newsweek reports that high-sugar foods, processed carbohydrates, and caffeine can all interfere with sleep quality. Eating a heavy meal close to bedtime can also disrupt sleep, as the digestive system works overtime.\nHave you ever noticed a pattern between what you eat before bed and the types of dreams you have? Do you think our modern diets are contributing to increased sleep disturbances?\nFrequently Asked Questions About Cheese, Dairy, and Nightmares Can eating cheese really cause nightmares? While not a definitive cause, research suggests a correlation between late-night dairy consumption and an increased likelihood of experiencing nightmares, potentially due to gut health and neurotransmitter imbalances. Is lactose intolerance the only reason dairy might disrupt sleep? No, even individuals without diagnosed lactose intolerance may experience digestive discomfort from dairy, which can interfere with sleep. The digestion process itself requires energy and can disrupt sleep architecture. What other foods should I avoid before bed to improve sleep? High-sugar foods, processed carbohydrates, caffeine, and heavy meals are all best avoided close to bedtime. How does gut health affect my dreams? The gut microbiome plays a vital role in producing neurotransmitters that regulate mood and sleep. Disruptions to the gut microbiome can impact these neurotransmitter levels and potentially lead to more vivid or disturbing dreams. Are there any foods that can *promote* better sleep? Foods rich in tryptophan, such as turkey and nuts, may help promote sleep. Magnesium-rich foods, like leafy greens, can also contribute to relaxation. Understanding the complex relationship between diet and sleep is an ongoing process. While more research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms at play, being mindful of your food choices, particularly before bed, can be a simple yet effective step towards improving your sleep quality and reducing the likelihood of unsettling dreams.\nDisclaimer: This article provides general information and should not be considered medical advice.

    "text": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug designation to SuVax™ for prevention and postexposure prophylaxis against Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) infection. SuVax is a subunit protein vaccine of recombinantly expressed Sudan ebolavirus glycoprotein. The designation was supported by nonhuman primate efficacy data, which showed the investigational vaccine provided 100% protection against SUDV infection. All the animals that received SuVax remained healthy and survived. The vaccine candidate has also been shown to be stable for at least 2 years when stored at temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). “SuVax is based on our novel vaccine platform which includes 3 major components: a robust protein manufacturing process that has been demonstrated on multiple protein antigens, a novel nano-emulsion adjuvant which induces broad immunity, and a formulation procedure which enables thermostabilization of the combination of adjuvant and antigen in a single vial,” explained Oreola Donini, PhD, Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Soligenix. There are [4 ebolaviruses](https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/about.html) that are known to cause disease in humans. In 2019, the FDA approved the first Ebola virus vaccine, [Ervebo](https://www.empr.com/drug/ervebo/); however, the vaccine only prevents disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus. “With recent outbreaks in 2022 and 2023, developing vaccines for all Ebola type diseases remains an important worldwide priority,” said Dr Donini. The FDA’s Orphan Drug designation is granted to therapies intended to treat or prevent rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the US.
