    "text": "Virat Kohli’s much-anticipated return to the Ranji Trophy ended on a disappointing note as he failed to make a significant impact. Playing for Delhi against the Railways at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, Kohli’s performance fell short of expectations. The crowd, which had gathered in large numbers to witness his comeback, was left disappointed as Kohli struggled at the crease.\nKohli, who last played domestic cricket over a decade ago, was expected to shine in his first innings back. However, he was dismissed for a mere 6 runs, failing to live up to the high expectations set by his fans. Despite his vast experience and past successes, Kohli’s recent form has been a concern, and this match was no exception.\nThe match saw Delhi resume their first innings at 41/1, with Kohli’s early dismissal adding to the pressure on the team. The atmosphere in the stadium, which had been electric with chants of “Kohli, Kohli,” turned somber as the reality of his performance set in. Fans, who had hoped to see their cricketing hero in action, were left disheartened by the outcome.\nWhile Kohli’s return to domestic cricket was a significant event, his performance in this match was a reminder that even legends have off days. The hope now is that he can regain his form and continue to inspire fans with his exceptional play in future matches",

    "text": "New York, Dec 29 : Six members of an Indian-origin family have been killed in Texas when their minivan was struck head-on by a pickup truck driven by a teenager that veered to the wrong side of the highway. The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) said that in the crash on Wednesday, one person in the minivan survived as did the teenager and a companion in the other vehicle that crossed over in a no-overtaking zone, media reported. The driver of the minivan was identified by the DPS as Rushil Barri, 28, from Irving, Texas, while the others travelling with him were visiting from Alpharetta, Georgia. According to the DPS, the others killed were Naveena Potabathula, 36, Nageswararao Ponnada, 64, Sitamahalakshmi Ponnada, 60, Krithik Potabathula, 10, Nishidha Potabathula, 9. Barri's causing, Lokesh Potabathula, 43, who survived the crash was hospitalised in critical condition, the DPS said. The driver of the truck and the other teenager in it were hospitalised with severe injuries and police have not been able to interview them, Fox4 reported. \"This was a no passing zone,\" DPS Sergeant William Lockridge was quoted by Fox4 TV in Dallas. \"We don't know what caused the vehicle to cross into the northbound lane.\" The portion of the highway where the accident happened had a speed limit of 70 mph (112 kph). According to Fox4, among those killed were Lokesh Potabathula's wife and children, parents-in-law, and cousin Barri. Ashok Kolla of the Telugu Association of North America told the station, \"Right now, we are authorised by both the families to send the human remains to India\" and \"we want to do it as soon as possible in the next 24-36 hours.\" Rakesh Barri told ABC8 TV in Dallas that his brother Rushil had spent the day with his relatives in the Fossil Rim Wildlife Safari Park in Glenn Rose, Texas, and were on their way to his home. The Ponnadas were on visit from India. Rakesh Barri told the station that his mother could not come to terms with his brother's death. He said that his mother maintains, \"He is still alive. I'm praying to the God, he will be back with you. You will be back with him to India.\"",

    "text": "Uno jamás sabe en qué persona se fijará para mantener una relación amorosa, pues suele aparecer de forma inesperada, pero un caso registrado en Estados Unidos ha dejado sumamente atónitos a los usuarios de TikTok. ¿Qué ocurrió? Una pareja descubrió que eran primos hermanos después de 6 meses y, a pesar de ello, tomaron la drástica decisión de casarse. [Este momento que se convirtió en viral](https://mag.elcomercio.pe/historias/canada-millonario-construye-99-casas-para-ayudar-menos-favorecidos-marcel-lebrun-historias-nnda-nnrt-noticia/) ha generado una gran cantidad de comentarios. Esta polémica historia de amor tiene como protagonistas a Makenna Hagemeyer, de 21 años, y Eli Hagemeyer, de 25, que son proveniente del estado de Utah. En un principio, desconocían que realmente tenían un lazo sanguíneo y terminaron profundamente enamorados, pues la química que presentaban fue suficiente para que se diera la posibilidad de iniciar un romance. Pero el detonante llegó cuando ambos supieron que eran primos hermanos. Probablemente, existan contados casos de que dos familiares tengan una relación amorosa, pues sería “prohibido” permitir dicha unión, pero esto poco les importó a estos jóvenes quienes no dieron por finalizado su amor; por el contrario, se animaron a contraer matrimonio. Es probable que esta pareja haya tenido que soportar los incómodos comentarios tras revelar esta información, pero supieron demostrar que están más comprometidos que nunca. La creadora de contenido publica diversos clips en esta red social junto a su pareja y se visualiza que están más felices que nunca. Su confesión obtuvo gran popularidad en TikTok Este clip fue obsevrado por más de un millón de personas y aproximadamente 50 mil usarios les agradó el contenido, evidenciando que ha tenido transcendencia, pero no de la forma que ellos hubieran deseado. Gran cantidad de cuentas se sintieron incómodas y determinaron que dicho testimonio no debió ser comentado ante “todo el mundo”. ¿Cuáles serían las consecuencias de que unos primos hermanos tengan hijos? Esta acción tendría como resultado graves consecuencias, pues los descendientes pueden sufrir trastornos genéticos u obtendrían una fuerte represión social por este singular motivo. Gracias por visitarnos hoy. Espero que este contenido de video viral haya sido de tu agrado. Si deseas encontrar más contenido similar visítanos en [Mag.elcomercio.pe](https://mag.elcomercio.pe/).

    "title": "Apple says 'technical limitations' prevented it from bringing the Apple Watch to Android",
    "text": "As part of Apple’s response to the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) lawsuit that [accuses the tech giant of creating a monopoly with the iPhone](https://mobilesyrup.com/2024/03/21/us-doj-lawsuit-apple-smartphone-monopoly/), the company has revealed that it spent three years trying to make the Apple Watch Android-compatible. Apple eventually dropped the project due to “technical limitations,” according to the company’s response to the DOJ (via [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/21/apple-watch-android-apple-work/)). However, it’s unclear what specific issues the company encountered regarding getting the Apple Watch to work with Android devices. In the lawsuit, the DOJ says the following: “Apple’s smartwatch — Apple Watch — is only compatible with the iPhone. So, if Apple can steer a user towards buying an Apple Watch, it becomes more costly for that user to purchase a different kind of smartphone because doing so requires the user to abandon their costly Apple Watch and purchase a new, Android-compatible smartwatch.” This isn’t the first time we’ve heard Apple was at one point working to bring the Apple Watch to Android. In 2023, [Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-11-01/apple-health-blood-pressure-glucose-sleep-apnea-team-issues) outlined Apple’s plans to bring its smartwatch to Android, though the project was eventually ditched due to “business considerations.” The DOJ’s lawsuit states that Apple intentionally limits the compatibility of the Apple Watch. It also states that the tech giant employs several other practices to create hurdles for users who want to use products and services from other brands. It is possible to use a [cellular Apple Watch with an Android device](https://www.androidpolice.com/apple-watch-pair-use-android-tutorial/), but you lose nearly all notable functionality and an iPhone is also required for initial setup (effectively, you’re not really using the wearable with an Android smartphone).

    "text": "TORRANCE, Calif. — A woman was killed after she was attacked with a sledgehammer at a college on Christmas Eve in Torrance, California. The assault happened Sunday just after 7 a.m. in the 16000 block of Crenshaw Boulevard, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said, according to KABC . Investigators say that the victim was collecting recyclables at El Camino College in Torrance when she was attacked, the news station reported. A man with a sledgehammer attacked her and fled the area before law enforcement arrived, according to KTLA. The victim was spotted by the gymnasium by someone passing by the area. Officers found her unconscious and she appeared to be bleeding from her head, the news outlet reported. Her dog stayed at her side. The victim was taken to the hospital where she died a day later on Christmas from her injuries, KTLA reported. The sheriff’s department only identified the victim as an Asian woman between the ages of 60 and 65, according to the Los Angeles Times. Investigators identified the suspect through surveillance footage as Jeffrey Davis, 40, according to KTLA. “The person that we had an idea of who was on the security footage is, we believe, a homeless person we’ve had contact with before,” said Sgt. Francisco Esqueda of El Camino College Police, according to the news outlet. “So we were able to go to the neighboring county park where he sometimes hangs out and that’s where we found him.” Davis was arrested shortly after the incident, the LA Times reported.",

REUTERS/Amir Cohen Reuters\nBy Nidal al-Mughrabi and Bassam Masoud\nCAIRO/GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli forces attacked areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip where residents have been expecting a renewed ground offensive in areas crammed with tens of thousands of Palestinians already displaced by the Israeli-Hamas war.\nWith nightfall on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the southern city of Khan Younis killed eight Palestinians, health officials said. Three Palestinians were killed and six injured in an Israeli missile strike on a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent said.\n\"The task here is to dismantle Hamas - so that it no longer has military and governing capabilities,\" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said at a press briefing on operations in Khan Younis. \"We will be required to show a lot of perseverance and determination.\"\nA Palestinian journalist posted pictures of Israeli tanks near a mosque in a built-up area of Bureij in central Gaza.\nRelated:\nA Timeline of the Israel-Palestinian Conflict The Islamist group Hamas released video it said showed its fighters targeting Israeli tanks and soldiers east of Bureij. Reuters was not able to verify the location or the date the video was filmed.\n\"That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,\" said Omar, 60, who said he had been forced to move with at least 35 family members. He declined to give his surname for fear of reprisals.\nYamen Hamad has been living in a school in Deir al-Balah, also in central Gaza, since fleeing from the north. He said people newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nIn one of Israel's latest airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. Their bombed building was housing displaced civilians, according to local medics and residents.\nSEARCHING THROUGH RUBBLE\nReuters video showed rescuers scrabbling frantically through rubble to uncover and pull out victims including a baby and several children and rushing them through milling crowds of dazed and weeping people to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital.\nPalestinian health authorities said earlier that 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 - nearly 1% of Gaza's population. Thousands more dead were feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nOver the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nHamas and its fighters are dug deep into the Gaza Strip's dense cities and towns and their leaders are still at large.\nIsrael has reported 169 of its soldiers killed in its Gaza campaign after Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.\nSome 110 hostages were freed during a Nov. 24-Dec. 1 humanitarian pause and more than 20 others have been declared dead.\nU.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Hamas killed an American hostage, Judith Weinstein, 70, on Oct. 7. Last week he said her husband Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on the same day.\nThe Israeli military released findings of an investigation into the killings in error by its troops of three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Dec. 15. Soldiers mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding.\nEGYPT'S PLAN TO END CONFLICT\nEgypt confirmed on Thursday that it had put forward a framework proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip that includes three stages ending with a ceasefire and said it was awaiting responses on the plan.\nThe proposal is an attempt \"to bring viewpoints between all concerned parties closer, in an effort to stop Palestinian bloodshed and the aggression against the Gaza Strip and restore peace and stability to the region,\" Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt's State Information Service, said in a statement.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will keep some form of security control of all Gaza indefinitely, though he insists that this would not amount to reoccupying the enclave.\n(Reporting by Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo, Bassam Masoud in Gaza and Emily Rose in Jerusalem; writing by Grant McCool; editing by Howard Goller)\nCopyright 2023 Thomson Reuters .\nJoin the Conversation See Comments Tags: Lebanon , United States , Israel , Middle East , Egypt\nRead More",
