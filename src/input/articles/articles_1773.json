On Thursday, JPMorgan analysts wrote that sentiment over Apple shares is improving with hedge fund investors, partially due to its recent stock slide.\nDespite some negative trends around iPhone sales in China, and recent reports of canceled projects such as its effort to build a car, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said investors may be more comfortable with its current valuation after recent losses and the potential to benefit from AI.\nThe JPMorgan analysts predicted a strong iPhone sales cycle in 2026 due to forthcoming AI features. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told investors to expect an AI announcement later this year. That is expected to occur during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference event in June.\n“Hedge fund investors are increasingly warming up to the opportunity of the AI upgrade cycle, but the uncertainty still pertains to whether the upgrade cycle starts with iPhone 16 in September 2024 or iPhone 17 in September 2025,” Chatterjee wrote.\nSeparately, Apple is also preparing new Mac laptops and desktops with next-generation “M4 chips” that emphasize AI, according to a report Thursday from Bloomberg. Apple declined to comment on the report. The current generation of Apple’s chips is called M3.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON, DC — A formidable new radar satellite jointly developed by the United States and India is set to launch Wednesday, designed to track subtle changes in Earth’s land and ice surfaces and help predict both natural and human-caused hazards.\nDubbed NISAR (NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar), the pickup truck-sized spacecraft is scheduled to lift off at 5:40 pm from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on India’s southeastern coast, riding an ISRO Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket.\nHighly anticipated by scientists, the mission has also been hailed as a milestone in growing US-India cooperation between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n“Our planet surface undergoes constant and meaningful change,” Karen St Germain, director of NASA’s Earth Science division, told reporters.\n“Some change happens slowly. Some happens abruptly. Some changes are large, while some are subtle.”\nBy picking up on tiny changes in the vertical movement of the Earth’s surface — as little as one centimeter (0.4 inches) — scientists will be able to detect the precusors for natural and human-caused disasters, from earthquakes, landsides and volcanoes to aging infrastructure like dams and bridges.\n“We’ll see land substance and swelling, movement, deformation and melting of mountain glaciers and ice sheets covering both Greenland and Antarctica, and of course, we’ll see wildfires,” added St Germain, calling NISAR “the most sophisticated radar we’ve ever built.”\nEquipped with a 12-meter dish that will unfold in space, NISAR will record nearly all of Earth’s land and ice twice every 12 days from an altitude of 747 kilometers.\nAs it orbits, the satellite will continuously transmit microwaves and receive echoes from the surface. AFP\nBecause the spacecraft is moving, the returning signals are distorted — but computer processing will reassemble them to produce detailed, high-resolution images.\nAchieving similar results with traditional radar would require an impractically large 12-mile-wide dish.\nNISAR will operate on two radar frequencies: L-band and S-band. The L-band is ideal for sensing taller vegetation like trees, while the S-band enables more accurate readings of shorter plants such as bushes and shrubs.\nNASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and India’s ISRO shared the workload, each building components on opposite sides of the planet before integrating and testing the spacecraft at ISRO’s Satellite Integration & Testing Establishment in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru.\nNASA’s contribution came to just under $1.2 billion, while ISRO’s costs were around $90 million.\nIndia’s space program has made major strides in recent years, including placing a probe in Mars orbit in 2014 and landing a robot and rover on the Moon in 2023.\nShubhanshu Shukla, a test pilot with the Indian Air Force, recently became the second Indian to travel to space and the first to reach the International Space Station — a key step toward India’s own indigenous crewed mission planned for 2027 under the Gaganyaan (“sky craft”) program.

    "text": "The Indian mobile phone industry has grown, its performance has not.\nIn recent decades, manufacturing industries around the world have been riding the wave of international production networks to achieve an unprecedented expansion in production and trade worldwide. These networks, also known as global value chains, have sprung from production—sharing arrangements across international borders among units producing goods and services. The phenomenon has been facilitated by three interrelated developments in world trade and production of goods—coordinated action by governments to eliminate and reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in goods, technological developments resulting in a steep reduction in the time taken for transportation of goods and advances in communications that made it possible to monitor and control production taking place in diverse geographical regions from one location.\nThe rise of the Indian mobile phone industry\nAlthough India was largely untouched by the global value chain revolution and overall, remained a laggard in manufacturing among emerging economies, the government decided to seize the moment and spark up the electronics industry in the country, particularly the mobile phone industry. It enhanced tariff protection for the product through the phased manufacturing programme and put in place an ambitious production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme, providing a subsidy of 4-6% on incremental sale. These initiatives clicked with a strong rise in the demand for mobile phones, both in India and abroad, to give a boost to the industry.\nA number of external factors added further impetus. The Covid-19 pandemic caused unease among investors in China about the implications of a geographical concentration of the global value chains. Trade wars involving the US and China exacerbated fears that geopolitical tension would cause disruption in global value chains. All this led to the ideas of friend-shoring and nearshoring and of China+1, and India emerged as one of the alternative destinations for all manufacturing industries. But on account of the roaring demand and the relative ease of manufacture through assembly, the momentum converged on the smartphone industry, which recorded a truly remarkable performance.\nThe primary aim of the industry was to benefit from globalisation and maximise production, attracting foreign direct investment, and providing employment opportunities at the same time. It clocked an increase in the value of production from $3 billion to $50 billion during 2015-2025. From a rank of 34 in 2015, India advanced to the fourth position among smartphone exporting countries and territories, placed after China, Hong Kong (China) and Vietnam. In the prized US market, the exports of iPhones from India jumped to 2.9 million units in April alone.\nThe challenge of low domestic value addition\nEven as the impressive rise in the volume of production took the Indian mobile phones industry near the top ranks in the world, the quality of its performance was found lacking. Raghuram Rajan, the former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, was the first to call out on the flaws. In 2023, he drew attention to the fact that the Indian mobile phone industry was importing much of the parts, components, sub-assemblies, and modules; and undertaking only assembly operation that constituted only a tiny proportion of value addition. The general expectation was that as the Indian economy rolled forward and the industry matured, there would be progressive accretion in the domestic value added for the mobile phones produced in the country, but this has not materialised.\nA 2024 report on the Indian electronics industry by the Niti Aayog shows that the position remains virtually unchanged. Normally, the value chain for the manufacture of mobile phones should begin with design and prototype, followed by component making, and end up with assembly. The Niti Aayog report reveals further that in the Indian mobile phone industry, there is a void in a large segment of the value chain. Design and prototype capabilities are missing altogether. The component industry is also virtually non-existent. Dependence on imports for a large proportion of high-tech components constrains assembly operations as well. Despite significant strengths in assembly, the Indian mobile phone industry has been able to localise sub-assemblies only in the two minor areas of battery packs and chargers. In about a dozen other sub-assemblies, including displays and camera modules, localisation has remained pegged at below 25%, due mainly to dependence on imported components.\nHigher tariff protection proves counterproductive\nThe government has been pursuing the policy of imposing or increasing tariffs on components and sub-assemblies in the hope that additional protection would foster localisation. This has not been fulfilled mainly because the local demand for components or sub-assemblies is not large enough to enable manufacturing to be undertaken on an internationally competitive scale.\nInstead of incentivising localisation, tariffs on inputs have become a hindrance for the integration of our mobile phone industry into the global supply chain. Calculations made in the industry show that the free trade agreement weighted tariff in India for the 68 HS 8-digit tariff lines of parts and components of mobile phones is 6.2% against 0.7% for Vietnam, and 4% for China. The system of production in bonded zones for exports, which allows duty free treatment of imported inputs, gives further advantage to China.\nMore domestic value addition\nThe Niti Aayog has identified component manufacturing as the weak link in the chain and recommended steps that need to be taken to stimulate component making. In fact, the government has been fleet-footed in addressing the deficiency and, on April 8, the ministry of electronics and information technology has already issued the strengthened scheme of incentives for identified sub-assemblies and bare components as well as for capital goods used for their manufacture. If the government’s incentives are successful, a big gap in the mobile phone value chain would be removed.\nWe would observe that with respect to tariffs, the government needs to do more than just simplify the structure, as recommended by the Niti Aayog. As the higher prevailing tariff in India is affecting its international competitiveness in mobile phones, decisive action is needed to reduce the tariff level on parts and components of mobile phones, say to the simple average level prevailing in competing countries such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\nAuthored for FE by Anwarul Hoda, honorary professor, ICRIER and Neha Gupta, international trade economist.",
