    "title": "How overindulging during the holiday season can trigger heart issues",
    "text": "(WXYZ) — Eating and drinking are a big part of holiday celebrations. But for some, overindulging can trigger a condition called holiday heart syndrome.\nBy the sound of it, you might think \"holiday heart\" means a heart full of joy. But it's actually the opposite. Holiday heart can happen when too much alcohol, salty foods and sweets put stress on your heart. This can cause your heart to beat irregularly, which we in the medical field call atrial fibrillation, or AFib. AFib happens when the electrical signals in the heart's upper chambers don’t work properly, causing a fast, pounding heartbeat.\nThe reason it's called holiday heart syndrome is that we see a lot of cases this time of year when people are enjoying festive foods and cocktails.\nNow, who's most at risk? People with existing heart issues are definitely at higher risk. However, holiday heart syndrome can happen to anyone. In the short term, it can be a worrisome side effect of overindulging. But over time, it may lead to more dangerous conditions like heart failure or stroke.\nFor some folks, they may feel like their heart is racing out of control. Others might notice irregular beats. Other common symptoms include:\n- Chest discomfort, pain or pressure\n- Dizziness or lightheadedness\n- Shortness of breath\n- Feeling overly tired or drained of energy\nIf you notice any of these, please stop drinking alcohol right away. Most of the time, holiday heart syndrome clears up on its own. But if the symptoms stick around, or you get unusually winded walking on flat ground, these are red flags. It's best to head to the emergency room to get checked out.\nNow, I would recommend that folks avoid holiday heart syndrome, and here are some tips:\n- Watch your alcohol: avoid drinking too much or binge drinking\n- Eat Smart: fill up on healthy options first and go easy on salty or fatty foods\n- Manage Stress: it can take a toll on your heart, so find ways to relax\n- Know Your Limits: If you have a history of heart issues, talk to your doctor about what is safe for you\nAlso, be cautious with medications like NSAIDs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. While they can help with hangover symptoms, they might raise your blood pressure and increase your risk of heart issues.\nThe holidays are a time to celebrate, but keeping things in moderation will help you enjoy them safely.\nTHIS WEEK ON 'THE DR. NANDI SHOW'\nCurious about boosting emotional health? Dr. Partha Nandi, MD, delves into the Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), commonly known as “Tapping,” to show how this powerful practice can help release negative emotions and enhance well-being. Nick Ortner, New York Times bestselling author and CEO of The Tapping Solution, shares his experiences and valuable advice on using this simple, effective, natural healing method. Also, EFT Practitioner Julie Booksh presents a tapping demo, so you can try this transformative technique yourself. Tune in this Sunday, Dec. 22 at 2 p.m.",

    "title": "Big Man on Campus: At 6-foot-9, Rocco Paulson stands out on the hardwood and in the classroom",
    "text": "It’s not difficult to spot Rocco Paulson on the University of Wisconsin-Superior campus. Whether he’s in Swenson Hall between classes, the Yellowjacket Union during the lunchtime rush or in Mertz Mortorelli Gymnasium as a member of the Yellowjackets men’s basketball team , finding the 6-foot-9 Paulson is easy.\nA sophomore at UW-Superior, Paulson is carrying out his basketball dreams thanks to an early introduction by his parents, both of whom are coaches with record-breaking collegiate careers.\n“I went to my first basketball practice when I was four weeks old,” Paulson said. “My dad was holding me. I’ve been dribbling a ball since I was able to walk. So, basketball has always kind of been there.”\nGrowing up in Duluth, Paulson often found himself at UW-Superior for summer league games. His connection with the campus deepened during his senior year when head men’s basketball coach Greg Polkowski reached out.\n“I started coming over to UWS to check out the college side of things,” said Paulson. “I began checking out more of the campus and seeing what attending and pursuing college basketball would be like. In high school, I started taking basketball a more seriously, and that’s when Coach Polkowski reached out to me and then offered me the ability to continue that path.”\nWhile basketball played a major role in bringing Paulson to UW-Superior, it’s what he learned about the university outside of the Marcovich Wellness Center that truly made campus feel like home.\n“A lot of my friends went to much larger universities and at first I thought I want to follow them, so I could still be with my friends,” said Paulson. “But the classes are huge there and you’re walking everywhere. Snow gets annoying when you’ve got to walk 20 or 40 minutes to class. The small class sizes of UWS creates closer community. It really was a big draw for me.”\nThe class sizes have also helped Paulson connect with his professors.\n“I’ll say hi to my professors whenever I see them in the hallways,” he said. “It’s nice that you’re not nervous to raise your hand. You kind of know everyone in your class. I’ve always appreciated that you can make more friends that way.”\nMaking friends hasn’t been difficult for Paulson. He’s currently a member of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAG) and will become co-president of the organization next year. He’s also served as president of the UWS Changemakers student organization.\n“I’ve been able to be a part of a lot of clubs and go to a lot of activities,” he said.\nAt UW-Superior, Paulson can follow another passion ignited by his parents.\n“I want to be a teacher,” he said. “My mom’s a teacher and my dad works at a community college. I’ve always been surrounded by academics. And, I work as a teacher right now of sorts.”\nPaulson, who was named to the Upper Midwest Athletic Conference (UMAC) Academic All-Conference in his freshman year, has already gained experience in the field at Stella Maris Academy – working at a summer program for third to sixth grade students assisting with an extended care program for preschool to sixth grade students during the school year.\n“It’s a blessing,” he said. “It’s really awesome to get that experience so early. It’s just great to be able to go to school, get your education, play a sport you love and do the job you want to do in the future – all in a week.”",

    "text": "Congresso pede suspensão da decisão de Dino que interrompeu uso de emendas Na Câmara, líderes discutem alternativas para garantir transparência no encaminhamento de recursos e fazem movimento contra Judiciário A Câmara dos Deputados, o Senado e partidos entraram com um pedido de suspensão da decisão do ministro Flávio Dino, do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) em interromper o uso de emendas impositivas no Congresso Nacional. A posição foi oficializada nesta quinta-feira (15), e cita todas decisões individuais de Dino relacionadas ao envio de recursos por parlamentares. [+ Câmara adia votação da reforma tributária em meio às negociações por emendas](https://sbtnews.sbt.com.br/noticia/politica/camara-adia-votacao-da-reforma-tributaria-em-meio-as-negociacoes-por-emendas) O pedido está atrelado a críticas de parlamentares à posição do magistrado, com questionamentos à pausa do processo. Por meio de nota, a Câmara afirma que não havia urgência para as posições de Dino. “As decisões monocráticas, proferidas fora de qualquer contexto de urgência que justificasse uma análise isolada, e não colegiada, transcenderam em muito o debate em torno de alegada falta de transparência das denominadas ‘emendas PIX’”, diz trecho do comunicado. [+ Dino suspende emendas impositivas até Congresso criar novas regras de transparência](https://sbtnews.sbt.com.br/noticia/politica/dino-suspende-emendas-impositivas-ate-congresso-criar-novas-regras-de-transparencia) Deputados ainda questionam a posição ao apontar que, em uma decisão individual, o STF desconstitui processos que estavam em vigor há quase dez anos e foram aprovadas em três diferentes presidências da Câmara. “No entendimento das Advocacias da Câmara dos Deputados e do Senado e dos Partidos Políticos, as decisões causam danos irreparáveis à economia pública, à saúde, à segurança e à própria ordem jurídica, além de violar patentemente a separação de poderes”, destaca outro trecho da nota. As críticas foram assinadas por onze partidos de diferentes frentes políticas e, inicialmente, não contou com apoio do PT, mas o partido endossou o documento horas após a divulgação. As siglas que apoiaram a posição foram: PL, União Brasil, PP, PSD, PSB, Republicanos, PSDB, PDT, Solidariedade, MDB e, agora, PT. Resposta ao Judiciário Em resposta ao Supremo, a Comissão Mista de Orçamento (CMO) rejeitou na quarta-feira (14) uma medida provisória que direcionava R$ 1,3 bilhão para recompor o Orçamento do Judiciário. A votação veio de maneira simbólica, sem contagem de votos. A medida ainda será analisada pelo plenário da Câmara, nesta quinta-feira (15).",

    "text": "The sunny weather much of the UK has been enjoying is due to come to an abrupt end as the Met Office issues a thunderstorm warning across parts of the country. The severe weather alert lasting from midday until 10pm on Sunday, May 12, predicts lighting storms, heavy rainfall, and potential flooding across parts of the UK. Plymouth is just outside of the warning zone, with the yellow weather warning covering much of the South Hams , narrowly missing Ivybridge . Read more: The weather forecasters, based in Exeter, are predicting that up to 50mm of rain could fall in just two hours this Sunday, despite temperatures remaining around a pleasantly warm 23C, reports BristolLive . A spokesperson for the Met Office warns: \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms could lead to some disruption in places, especially to travel. Isolated property flooding is possible. \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms are likely to break out in the south of this area late Sunday morning and early Sunday afternoon, moving steadily north while growing into larger areas of rain before clearing the area. \"Some intense downpours are possible in a few places, giving up to 30 mm in less than hour and perhaps 40-50 mm over two to three hours leading to surface water flooding. Hail, frequent lightning strikes and strong wind gusts will be additional localised hazards.\" The warning encompasses vast areas of the west, including Bristol, Somerset, Devon and Gloucestershire, as well as most of Wales. Despite the impending heavy rain and storms, temperatures are predicted to stay high. Plymouth is set to see temperatures of 20c on Friday, 21C on Saturday and 18C on Sunday. Heavy downpours are predicted for Monday, with temperatures of 14C.",

    "text": "George Clooney needs to ‘put Amal first’ before politics to save this marriage: Report\nAmal Clooney is contemplating a return to Europe amid marital strain with George, whose political missteps have reportedly tested their relationship.\nGeorge and Amal Clooney's marriage is said to be “at a crossroads”, with Amal reportedly considering returning to Europe and leaving George in New York. But why so?\nThe Oscar-winning actor's Broadway debut in Good Night, and Good Luck took the stage at New York’s Winter Garden Theatre to strong reviews and record-breaking ticket sales. But while Hollywood stars filled the audience on opening night, one notable absence cast a shadow over the celebration: Amal Clooney, his wife of ten years.\nGeorge told reporters she was home “with the kids,” 7-year-old twins Alexander and Ella. But insiders told Radar Online, “Certainly, they have options when it comes to childcare so that Amal could get away for a couple of hours.”\nALSO READ| How Donald Trump could bar George Clooney's wife, Amal, from entering the US under this new sanction\n“People were whispering, wondering whether there might be trouble in the marriage.”\nThose close to him say George “respects and loves Amal,” and added, he just “needs to rearrange his priorities and put his wife and family first.”\nWhispers of divorce for George and Amal Clooney making headlines\nWhile the couple has long been admired, their relationship appears to be facing strain, and George’s recent political stances haven’t helped.\nJust in July, Clooney sparked backlash by penning a New York Times op-ed urging then-President Joe Biden to step down from the 2024 race. The controversy intensified when, according to a new book, Uncharted, George went “ballistic” after an MSNBC segment implied former President Barack Obama was behind the piece.\nLater, the veteran Batman star’s public support for Kamala Harris also fizzled. “He had to face the fact that his ‘opinion doesn't carry as much weight as he thought,’” the report stated, noting that Amal was “running out of patience with her husband's political missteps.”\nALSO READ| Megyn Kelly fires back at George Clooney over journalism jab: ‘That’s not journalism, George…’\nAmal, named 2024’s International Lawyer of the Year by Legal 500, has reportedly struggled with being sidelined during George’s Broadway run. “She’s willing to support George, but not if it means her career comes second,” a source told Radar Online.\n“It has put George in a bad mood. He can be unbearable to be around sometimes,” added the insider.\nentertainment, right from\nHollywoodgossip to\nBollywoodchit chat.

La alcaldesa de Tampa, Jane Castor, afirmó durante una rueda de prensa la mañana de miércoles que los uniformados lograron \"rescatar\" al hombre. \"Si logramos que el 'teniente Dan' fuera a un refugio, podemos lograr que cualquiera lo haga\", declaró durante una rueda de prensa la tarde de miércoles. No obstante, resultó que Malinowski permaneció en su bote. El hecho fue confirmado por el corresponsal de NewsNation, Brian Entin, quien lo fotografió poco después de la rueda de prensa de la alcaldesa.
