    "title": "Allerta Meteo, Santa Lucia con maltempo: ecco dove pioverà oggi",
    "text": "Allerta meteo oggi, 13 dicembre 2024, giorno in cui si celebra Santa Lucia , per una fase di maltempo che coinvolgerà diverse regioni italiane. In considerazione della situazione, il servizio PRETEMP (gruppo di lavoro che si pone l’obiettivo di studiare e prevedere i fenomeni temporaleschi severi sul territorio italiano) ha pubblicato un nuovo bollettino di previsioni probabilistiche. Di seguito tutti i dettagli e la mappa con le aree a rischio .\nAllerta Meteo, il bollettino “ L’unione del cut off spagnolo con il vortice polare imprimerà un moto zonale alla saccatura così formatasi, la quale costituirà un fronte in transito da ovest attraverso il Mar Tirreno meridionale, in direzione di Lazio e Campania , con delle correnti più calde e umide meridionali in bassa troposfera, associate ad una rimonta di alta pressione dal nord Africa “, riporta il bollettino PRETEMP. “ È stato emesso un livello 1 per forti piogge convettive per Mar Tirreno, Trapanese , coste di basso Lazio e Campania ; un livello 0 è valido per grandine e trombe marine . Un ampio livello 0 è valido per Mar Tirreno, Sardegna , Toscana , Corsica , resto del Lazio per rovesci convettivi , trombe marine e grandine piccola/graupeln “.\nAllerta Meteo, focus sulle aree Livello 1 In corrispondenza del fronte previsto nel pomeriggio, prosegue PRETEMP , “ è simulato l’apporto di umidità di un vento di scirocco e ostro con elevata Theta E tra il suolo e 850 hPa, che contribuirà a innalzare il PWAT fino a 25 mm e il CAPE fino a 7-1000 J/KG specie in mare, in un ambiente con DLS moderato o forte. Per tale motivo sono simulati sistemi multicellulari/QLCS, anche persistenti che potranno dare luogo a forti piogge con rischio allagamenti . E’ simulato anche un LCL basso, un CAPE 0-3 km maggiore di 250 J/Kg e uno shear direzionale di tipo low level localmente sostenuto, motivo per cui non si escludono fenomeni vorticosi. Inoltre, la presenza di un livello secco tra 850 e 700 hPa, potrebbe favorire la conservazione di eventuali chicchi di grandine “.\nLivello 0, Tirreno occidentale Su queste zone “ saranno possibili temporali post frontali a cella singola o cluster irregolari, legati all’aria fredda in quota, i quali potranno produrre grandine e graupeln . Inoltre specie a sud in direzione della Sardegna, i valori di CAPE 0-3 km sono più elevati e le trombe marine potrebbero essere favorite, anche grazie alla scarsa ventilazione al suolo e all’interazione dei deboli flussi sinottici con l’orografia a creare locali convergenze “, conclude PRETEMP.\nPer monitorare nel modo migliore possibile la situazione meteo in tempo reale in questa fase di allerta meteo, di seguito forniamo un elenco delle pagine con tutte le informazioni utili per seguire il nowcasting meteorologico minuto per minuto:\nDi seguito i link per l’accesso diretto alle pagine con le previsioni meteo, particolarmente accurate nei dettagli, per le aree geografiche d’Italia (link sempre raggiungibili anche dal Menù in alto in tutte le pagine del sito):\nLe Previsioni Meteo Regione per Regione:",

    "title": "Climate hasn't been core to the GOP. These conservatives are trying to change that | KPBS Public Media",
    "text": "Climate hasn't been core to the GOP. These conservatives are trying to change that Tucked into a hallway at the Republican National Convention, between booths promoting the Second Amendment and another selling official merchandise of the Trump Campaign, sat a sprawling display of the conservative legacy in environmentalism. Young conservatives ran back and forth asking convention goers with Nixon pins if they were familiar with former President Richard Nixon’s environmental policy. They approached oil lobbyists about the need for climate change conversations. They handed out stickers to rising young Republican voters. “The word ‘Conservative’ is in ‘conservation,’” said Aidan Shank, one member of the American Conservation Coalition, the environmental group that set up the booth. For years, the Republican Party has gotten a reputation for denying climate science and the urgency of global warming. Their statements about the environment usually focus on burning more fossil fuels, the biggest driver of climate change. But this year, for the first time in recent memory, conservatives had a climate showing at the Republican National Convention. The leadership of the American Conservation Coalition (ACC) flew to Milwaukee for a week of conversations around climate, conservation, and energy. They kept up efforts to win delegates’ attention and support, even as their party nominated former President Donald Trump, who doesn’t acknowledge the full effects of human-caused climate change and has vowed to rescind many of President Biden’s climate-related investments. Young conservatives are likely to support Trump this November. Still, they want to see their party talk about climate and energy policy. They see potential for a Trump administration to prioritize domestic production of clean energy. Unlike their Democratic counterparts–and prevailing climate science—they also still back oil and gas development. “We can be hopeful. And our approach has always been to work with people where we can,” said Danielle Butcher Franz, CEO of ACC. She added: “We really are using this RNC to introduce ourselves to the base, and to stakeholders, and to say there's a better way to do environmental policy.” Young conservatives hope to reframe the conversation On their first morning in Milwaukee, six members of ACC got ready at an Airbnb for their convention debut. Decked out with their American flag caps, brown Tevoca boots, American flag belt and button-up shirt with bison, they planned out their RNC reception event schedule: arrive at 1 pm, do a reception hosted by another group, and have time to visit, talk to dozens of people over five hours. ACC was an RNC sponsor, cementing its mark at the Republican gathering. It's considered a significant milestone for the group, which formed in 2017 during the first Trump administration. At its inception, it quickly attracted young politicos like Stephen Perkins, the 29-year-old chief operating officer of ACC. “I grew up going camping and with my dad and fishing and all that sort of stuff. And so we've always had an appreciation for the environment and the outdoors,” said Perkins, of the Texas places he grew up in and loved. “As I got more involved in politics, the issues that I gravitated toward were the tougher ones.” Perkins likes to talk to fellow young conservatives about the impact of climate change on most policy issues. He recalled when one young Republican told him that he didn’t care about climate — that he was more concerned about immigration. Perkins had an answer for him. “Not the only reason, but a big reason why people are coming here is many of them are climate refugees,” Perkins said of the explanation he gave about immigration “There are places where whether it's flooding or extreme heat, they're coming here to escape that. And so there's actually a connection.” Generally, Republicans have not seen climate as their issue. And leaders, like Trump and Vance, have championed fossil fuel production over conservation and climate action. “He’s (Trump) not perfect. We certainly recognize that. He needs to talk about climate change,” Perkins said. “But when you talk about seven years ago when ACC was started, you couldn't get Republican elected officials to even talk about climate change.” Some of that has evolved. During the first GOP debate, an ACC member asked presidential candidates running against Trump how they would ease fears that the GOP doesn’t care about climate. There were few direct answers. Although climate is not a top issue for Republicans, i [t does rank higher on the list of policy priorities for younger Republican](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/25/1195566969/climate-change-made-it-in-the-gop-debate-some-young-republicans-say-thats-a-win)s. The steps are small but ACC hopes a younger generation of conservatives can reframe the conversation. One way of doing so was with the large booth at the convention. Most visitors were curious and generally supportive. They picked up stickers, and fliers and colored a large poster that spelled out the word “legacy.” There was the occasional pushback — like an oil lobbyist who denied climate change. “Approaching every conversation with empathy is the first place to begin,” said Aidan Shank, who was staffing the ACC table. “There's so many places where we can agree, and just assuming that the conversation revolves around finding those agreements, sometimes that's the most constructive way to create dialogue.” The leaders at ACC wanted to create the organization in order to facilitate the conversations Shank is having at the convention now. Like Perkins, Danielle Butcher Franz grew up in the outdoors. Raised in a more liberal family, she said she never thought of the environment as a partisan issue, until she started talking to others. “As we would speak to our peers, we would notice over and over them saying things like, ‘I'm conservative except on the environment’ or ‘I want to support Democrats because of climate change,’” Butcher Franz said. Though she generally feels welcome in her conservative spaces, she at first had to fight stereotypes. “On the right, you would sort of have this skepticism of, ‘Are you really conservatives, or is this like a Trojan horse for big government solutions that we don't agree with?’ ” Butcher Franz said, noting that she also pushes back against stereotypes about Republican interest in climate. “It can be frustrating to have to constantly feel like you're in myth-busting mode, and you have to constantly dispel these preconceived notions that people have about what you believe and what you stand for,” Butcher Franz said. Republicans celebrate being at the convention — at all Later in the day, the group gathers inside the Mitchell Park Domes Horticulture Conservatory to host a reception with dozens of guests and to talk about energy innovation, and Republicans’ long involvement with the environment. Mainly, they wanted to celebrate being at the convention. Nearly all the speakers acknowledged that this kind of convention presence was new and signals a turning tide. In remarks, ACC President Chris Barnard noted that he believed this was a historic event. “This is the first time something like this has happened at a Republican convention — we have a conservative climate reception,” he proudly told the crowd. Talking with NPR, Barnard says he still feels like there is a stereotype that to care about climate or conservation is to be a Democrat. But he wants to see the GOP — even Trump and Vance — to take advantage of the issue. “It's politically very popular,” Barnard said. “And so the first thing to say really is that for anyone in the Republican Party, that's not championing that message: That's really just a lost opportunity.” Barnard saw speaking to delegates and other 2024 candidates at the convention as a foot in the door. And he hopes ACC’s conversations, the booth and receptions encourage them to address climate in their local races. “It's important to talk to them and kind of equip them with the messaging and how they can talk about these issues,” Barnard said. “And hoping that there's a good opportunity to work with Republicans on important environmental and climate policies.” Copyright 2024 NPR",

[Tetrahydrocannabinol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563174/) (THC) is a naturally occurring medical compound with a wide range of medical applications. It is used to treat chemotherapy patients and stimulate appetite. Stimulation of appetite has a number of different treatment applications for health issues such as anorexia and AIDS. THC is produced by Cannabis sativa plants, which also create cannabidiol (CBD). THC can be ingested in several ways. It is commonly smoked or eaten in the form of THC edibles. With THC becoming legal on a much wider basis in recent years, many new products have been made available, and now, more people than ever are learning about and experimenting with THC. It is becoming increasingly common to find a rolling tray sitting on someone’s coffee table or to engage in a casual smoke session with friends and family. Weed usage has become much more acceptable in recent years and may continue to trend in that direction in the years to come. Potential Benefits of THC Marijuana has many [ medical applications](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/cannabis-marijuana-and-cannabinoids-what-you-need-to-know) and has been proven to be effective in the treatment of epilepsy, as well as other serious health conditions and illnesses. It may even provide relief for chronic pain sufferers and alleviate some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis. It is being studied in the treatment of conditions such as anxiety, HIV, irritable bowel syndrome, Tourettes, and many, many others. Potential Side Effects of THC Use of THC use creates an altered sense of time and creates mood changes. It can cause sluggish thinking, impaired memory and even psychosis in extreme cases. Taking high doses of THC can cause more severe side effects, such as delusions and hallucinations. Ingesting large quantities of [ weed edibles](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/sponsor-content/thc-gummies-5-thc-edibles-for-stress-pain-relief-and-sleep/) can lead to these more extreme side effects, as they can be slow to start having an effect, and it can be easy to over-indulge. In younger users of THC, this compound may impair brain development in the areas of thinking, memory and learning. Research is still being conducted to understand better these [ effects](https://nida.nih.gov/publications/drugfacts/cannabis-marijuana) and how long-term they may be. Studies of THC’s negative effects and potential long-term effects remain ongoing, as a lot of things about this plant have not been understood or known for very long, scientifically speaking. Studies and research are conducted all the time to learn more about THC, and as knowledge becomes available, it is tested and re-tested so it can be proven. Establishing scientific facts takes a long time and a lot of study, but scientists around the world are dedicated to learning more. FAQs Is THC safe? Safe is a relative term. When it comes to smoking marijuana, it does not harm the lungs the way tobacco products can. However, marijuana has long-term effects on memory and cognitive abilities. In areas of the world where marijuana is not legal, it is certainly not safe to try smoke shop products and smoking accessories, such as [THC gummies](https://www.seattlemet.com/discover/thc-delta/best-delta-9-gummies-6-thc-edibles-for-a-relaxing-high/), because you could be risking imprisonment merely for having these items. THC also carries with it the risk of addiction, and some say it can lead to additional and more varied drug use. Many studies about whether or not marijuana use can be linked to other drug use have been conducted, with results varying. Individual personality makeup can also play a role in addition, so the question of how safe marijuana is from this viewpoint is highly subjective and depends upon the person. Is THC legal? Whether or not THC is legal and to what degree is an answer with several parts. While [THC use has been legalized either for medical or recreational](https://www.seattlemet.com/discover/thc-delta/is-thc-legal/) use in many states in the U.S., it is still considered to be illegal at a federal level. The legality of THC is an ever-evolving issue that continues to change as this issue makes its way onto more and more ballots. This question can be answered in a number of different ways depending on when it is being asked, so the legality of THC continues to change with time. How much THC can I take? Fatal overdoses of marijuana are “unlikely,” according to the [ CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/marijuana/faqs.htm). However, it is possible to take a dangerous amount of THC. You may suffer from paranoia, panic, increased heart rate, high anxiety, extreme confusion, increased blood pressure, vomiting, and even hallucinations from ingesting too much. In other words, try to avoid washing down your gummies with [ THC drinks](https://www.houstoniamag.com/sponsored/2023/10/thc-drinks-best-cannabis-infused-beverages) while you take bong riffs all at once. Using edibles and beverages is the most common reason people over-consume marijuana, so slow down and pace yourself to avoid these extreme symptoms. If you think you are suffering from symptoms of too much THC use, consult with a physician and know that THC is not typically fatal, even in cases of extreme usage. It is best to remain as calm as possible. Sometimes, eating food can help with these symptoms, but do not eat any weed edibles, as this will only compound the problem. What is the difference between THC and CBD? Cannabis plants produce both [CBD and THC](https://www.seattlemet.com/discover/thc-delta/cbd-vs-thc-similarities-and-differences/), which are two different compounds created by the same plant. CBD, cannabidiol, and THC from the cannabis sativa plants have slightly different chemical compounds. THC creates psychoactive effects, which means the brain is affected, while CBD does not. It does not impair function, and it is not intoxicating, which is why CBD is legal, and THC is still illegal (or debated over its legality) in some places.
