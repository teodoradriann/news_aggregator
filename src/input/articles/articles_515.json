    "title": "Professor Ellie Jin Receives Highest Award from International Organization",
    "text": "Albert Myers Distinguished Professor Ellie Jin is receiving the highest award given by the International Textile and Apparel Association (ITAA) by being recognized as an ITAA Fellow for her outstanding contributions to the field of textiles and clothing.\nPath to Fellow Almost a century old, the ITAA is a professional, educational organization for academics in the textile, apparel and merchandising disciplines created to exchange research and ideas. It’s the only academic organization of its kind, which is why the “scholarly exchange” is extremely valuable, according to Jin.\nThe Fellow is awarded to a member who has significantly contributed to the field of textiles and clothing and/or service within the ITAA. Jin is certainly deserving of this award having served as president in 2021 and has been an active member of the organization since the ’90s, when she was still in graduate school.\n“It feels really great to know my contributions are being recognized,” Jin says. “It’s not just academic, but a combination of research, contribution to the field and organization and leadership – all of those together.”\nOriginally from South Korea, Jin is a scholar in global fashion marketing and business and has traveled to many countries to research fashion markets. Her research is focused on branding, retailing in emerging markets, technology applications and innovative business models. She has published over 145 journal articles, two textbooks – “Fashion Business” (2002) and “Global Fashion Business” (2024) – and an edited book series titled “Global Fashion Brand Management” containing seven volumes. She has earned funding for numerous research projects from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Education and the National Research Foundation of Korea, and received multiple awards including the Distinguished Scholar Award (2019), Prentice Hall Lecturer Award (2007), numerous Paper of Distinction Awards (2007-2024), and the Outstanding Graduate Faculty Mentor Award (2009).\n“I congratulate Dr. Ellie Jin on becoming an ITAA Fellow,” says Kristin A. Thoney-Barletta, interim head of the Department of Textile and Apparel, Technology and Management (TATM). “Dr. Jin’s leadership and years of service within the ITAA, combined with her significant teaching and research contributions to textile and apparel management, make her an obvious choice to receive this great honor.”\nA Legacy of Learning Jin joined the Wilson College in 2018 as the Albert Myers Distinguished Professor. Alongside excelling in her research, she deeply values teaching and mentoring next generations. She is an advisor for doctoral and master’s students. Most of them are now faculty in the USA, Taiwan and Korea and leading the discipline.\nIn 2022, she established the Fashion and Textile Business Excellence Cooperative (FTBEC) – an industry-university partnership dedicated to advancing the fashion and textile industry. It aims to bridge the gap between academia and industry, giving students applied learning opportunities. At the beginning of this fall semester, FTBEC began a partnership with Gerber Childrenswear, LLC on a sustainable packaging initiative.\n“I had the idea because our discipline is an applied science, you can’t just do it in the classroom or lab. Students should have hands-on experiences,” Jin says. “We talk a lot about branding and marketing, but they don’t always have the chance to apply their knowledge to real-world contexts before they graduate. I’m so happy to see my vision coming to fruition and students love to be involved.”\nAnother one of Jin’s recent accomplishments is the AI in the Textile and Fashion Industries conference, which she led with Professors Abdel-Fattah Seyam and Blan Godfrey this August.\nReflecting on the experience, she remarked, “As a distinguished professor, I feel a deep responsibility to guide the profession and industry by providing practical insights to support the current and future workforce,” she says. “Seeing the strong attendance and the inspiration among participants was immensely rewarding.”\nReceiving the ITAA Fellow award and starting a new industry partnership aren’t the only things Jin has accomplished so far this fall semester. Her textbook, “Global Fashion Business,” was released in August. This textbook was developed based on her numerous funded research in emerging markets and teaching for her senior level global brand management class.\n“That’s another legacy I’m leaving behind. Even though I’ll eventually be retiring, I will do my best to revise this book and keep it timely. After me, my students can build as second or third authors so the book continues to evolve after me,” Jin says. “I’m so proud of them; they are the future generations. So in that sense, I feel very proud that I can contribute to the field and the world. I feel it’s my calling from God to have the honor of serving as a professor and leave my legacy in this way.”",

    "text": "A recent server glitch during the 2025 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) conducted by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has sparked widespread concerns, re-igniting debates about the reliability of computer-based examinations and the readiness of examination bodies to go fully automated, OWEDE AGBAJILEKE reports.\nThe server glitch that plagued this year’s Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) has sent shockwaves nationwide, particularly in Lagos and the South-East states, where unusually high failure rates were recorded.\nThe technical issue has ignited intense debates, with many stakeholders questioning the reliability and effectiveness of computer-based examinations.\nComing barely a year to the deadline issued by the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) and the National Examination Council (NECO) to fully migrate to CBT for all their examinations, pundits noted that the development raises critical concerns about the readiness of Nigeria’s examination bodies to transition to full computer-based testing.\nThe Federal Government had announced plans to transition WAEC and NECO exams to CBT by 2026, citing benefits such as reduced examination malpractice, streamlined logistics, and faster result processing.\nMinister of Education, Dr Tunji Alausa, who gave the order recently, believes that leveraging technology in examinations aligns with Nigeria’s vision to create a future-ready educational ecosystem, citing JAMB’s successful adoption of CBT for over 2.2 million candidates as a model.\nGiving an implementation timeline, the minister said the two examination bodies would start conducting objective tests in November 2025, with a full switch to CBT, including essay papers, expected by May/June 2026.\nAlausa also disclosed that a committee is currently reviewing examination standards nationwide, with recommendations expected this month.\nThe minister further added that the examination bodies would utilise JAMB’s existing 887 CBT centres across the country for their exams.\nAs expected, the news has elicited divergent reactions from Nigerians. While some described the initiative as long overdue, others called for caution, referencing technical glitches, unusually low scores and alleged irregularities in this year’s UTME that witnessed an unprecedented 70 per cent failure rate.\n[FILES] Candidates in an examination hall However, some stakeholders have expressed worries that the recent UTME glitch has highlighted issues with technical infrastructure, exam security, and student readiness, which need to be addressed before transitioning to computer-based exams for WAEC and NECO.\nOthers also wondered how the Federal Government plans to consolidate WAEC’s 20,000 exam centres into JAMB’s much smaller network of 887 centres.\nThere are equally concerns that the proposed shift to computer-based exams may put many schools, particularly public secondary and some private ones, at a disadvantage, due to inadequate infrastructure, including lack of computer laboratories, unreliable internet, erratic power supply, and insufficiently trained teachers to prepare students for the exams.\nThose who held this view believe that the timing of the glitch is particularly worrisome, even as they advocated a re-evaluation of the implementation timeline, by giving room for more consultation as well as reassessment of the technical infrastructure needed to support large-scale computer-based exams countrywide.\nSpeaking with The Guardian on the development, the Executive Director, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, said the policy would limit the children’s access to education.\nRafsanjani, who is also Chairman of Amnesty International Nigeria, lamented that the policy intentionally created difficult conditions to prevent students from taking the exam.\nThe human rights activist subsequently called on the government to immediately review and reconsider the policy to ensure that it does not unfairly shut out students and deny them access to education.\nHe said: “Sometimes our policymakers take certain decisions without looking at the capacity of the country to implement those decisions or directives. I think it is important that, in order not to be ridiculing ourselves, as a nation, we should ensure that we have the necessary infrastructure and capacity to implement these directives, and have them in place before we make them compulsory.\n“There is nothing wrong with introducing a policy, but it must be sound and practicable. You need to have them in phases gradually. You don’t just come up with a new way of doing things overnight when you do not have the capacity to ensure that it happens. So, it is important that our policymakers are knowledgeable and consult widely before coming up with any policy or legal framework, in the case of legislators. Because sometimes they come up with things that are inconceivable.”\nRafsanjani emphasised the need to always do a proper needs assessment and ensure that there is adequate manpower to carry them out.\nWith multidimensional poverty affecting 63 per cent of the Nigerian population – about 133 million people, Rafsanjani noted that the policy, if implemented, would exacerbate the existing educational challenges and further marginalise vulnerable populations, pushing more children out-of-school, and worsening the country’s already dire human development indicators.\nSpecifically, he emphasised that the policy would disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, such as rural dwellers and indigent children, as distant exam centres would further complicate their already challenging circumstances.\n“This policy will affect the lives of many Nigerians who are struggling. Most of these children could not even afford to go to exam centres because their parents don’t have the money to give them. Now, you’re going to take them further away from their destination. Who pays for that? You don’t just create difficult situations because you don’t have that problem. And your children are not even schooling in Nigeria. Or even if they are, they are not schooling in public schools,” he added.\nThe CISLAC boss was, however, countered by a schoolteacher, Vincent Otolo, who argued that both exams should transition from paper to CBT, considering the advancement in technology.\nOtolo, who teaches in one of the Federal Government Colleges in the North Central, highlighted Nigeria’s potential to adapt, revealing that the Federal Ministry of Education recently trained over 6,000 teachers on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\nThe Computer Science tutor also downplayed concerns about technical issues, noting that such glitches are common worldwide, even in advanced countries like the United States and the United Kingdom.\nHowever, he emphasised the need for the necessary infrastructure, manpower, and expertise to be put in place before making the switch.\nAccording to him, WAEC and NECO are long overdue for computer-based tests.\n“In fact, WAEC is way over 40 years old, and coming at a time like this, I think it is necessary that we switch to CBT. We just, however, need to put the necessary infrastructure, manpower and expertise in place. Once these things are done, with regular practice, preparation and planning, I’m sure the Nigerian educational system can comfortably switch.\n“And I feel the JAMB issue is not a unique thing. It happens everywhere in the world. It happened in the UK, the U.S., and other countries of the world. It’s a machine, and when not properly prepared, planned or programmed, it will malfunction, of course.”\nOn his part, a public affairs analyst, Ifeanyi Nwoko, suggested that JAMB should be used as a testing ground to perfect the computer-based examination system before introducing it to WAEC and NECO.\nNwoko pointed out that once the system is refined and perfected with the involvement of government and relevant agencies, it can then be expanded to other examination bodies.\nConsidering what happened during the conduct of the UTME, Nwoko said the system should be perfected before migrating both WAEC and NECO to full CBT testing.\n“When we are sure that we have attained perfection, then we can begin to incorporate other examination bodies,” he argued.\nReacting, the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) welcomed the development, noting that some higher institutions in Nigeria have transitioned to computer-based testing (CBT) exams.\nNANS National Public Relations Officer, Samson Adeyemi, tasked the government to be proactive and allow sufficient time to address potential technical and human errors, considering the country’s limited internet coverage, high poverty level and large student population.\n“While the idea of full CBT testing is a good one, the implementation process should be carefully considered,” he stated.\nAdeyemi also pointed out that the timeframe should be looked into, and the process should not be rushed.\n“If the policy will be covering millions of students, then we should have a proper breakdown of time so that when there are issues, we will have enough time to review them,” Adeyemi added.",

    "title": "Nvidia finally open sources some of its GPU drivers. How to tell what&apos;s under your hood | ZDNET",
    "text": "MF3d/Getty Images For more years than I care to recall, Linux users have hated NVIDIA, the world&apos;s leading Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) company. Why? Because years after all the other companies open-sourced their drivers, NVIDIA refused to do so. Nor would it give the Linux kernel developers the data they needed to build open-source drivers for them. That left Linux users stuck with proprietary, second-rate drivers. Now, NVIDIA has finally opened up its GPU driver code .\nHate wasn&apos;t too strong a word. In a famous interview, a frustrated Linus Torvalds said, \"I&apos;m also happy to very publicly point out that Nvidia has been one of the worst trouble spots we&apos;ve had with hardware manufacturers, and that is really sad because then Nvidia tries to sell chips - a lot of chips - into the Android Market. Nvidia has been the single worst company we&apos;ve ever dealt with. [Lifts middle finger] So Nvidia, f**k you. \"\nAlso: Linux kernel 6.10 officially rolls out: Here&apos;s what&apos;s new and improved\nAnd, lest we forget, in 2022, the Lapsus$ ransomware gang threatened to leak Nvidia&apos;s GPU files if the company refused \"to COMPLETELY OPEN-SOURCE (and distribute under a foss license) their GPU drivers for Windows, macOS and Linux, from now on and forever.\" This was not your usual ransomware demand.\nThat didn&apos;t work, but NVIDIA is transitioning fully towards open-source GPU kernel modules as it closes in on a three-trillion-dollar market cap. This marks a major change in its long-standing -- and frankly wrong-headed -- policy.\nThis transition began in May 2022 with the release of the R515 driver, which included a set of Linux GPU kernel modules as open source with dual GPL and MIT licensing. Initially, this release targeted data center compute GPUs, with GeForce and Workstation GPUs in an alpha state.\nOver the past two years, NVIDIA has worked diligently to improve these open-source modules, achieving equivalent or better application performance than their closed-source counterparts. The company has also added substantial new capabilities, including:\nHeterogeneous memory management (HMM) support Confidential computing\nSupport for the coherent memory architectures of NVIDIA&apos;s Grace platforms\nThese features won&apos;t help much with getting the best possible gaming performance, but they could assist cryptocurrency miners or artificial intelligence (AI) developers.\nAlso: How open source attracts some of the world&apos;s top innovators\nWith the upcoming R560 driver release, NVIDIA will complete its transition to open-source GPU kernel modules. This move is expected to benefit the Linux community by allowing for better integration with the operating system and enabling more robust community development and support.\nHowever, it&apos;s important to note that this transition doesn&apos;t apply to all NVIDIA GPUs. The open-source modules are mandatory for cutting-edge platforms like NVIDIA Grace Hopper or NVIDIA Blackwell. NVIDIA recommends switching to open-source modules for GPUs from the Turing, Ampere, Ada Lovelace, or Hopper architectures. Older GPUs from the Maxwell, Pascal, or Volta architectures will continue using the proprietary driver, as they&apos;re incompatible with the open-source modules.\nNeed help determining what you&apos;ve got under your computer&apos;s hood? NVIDIA provides a shell script, nvidia-driver-assistant, to help you. Once that&apos;s done, you can install the CUDA Toolkit and the appropriate GPU drivers using your Linux distros&apos; package manager.\nAlso: Latest AI training benchmarks show Nvidia has no competition\nThis move by NVIDIA is a step towards creating a more open ecosystem for Linux users and developers. It also puts NVIDIA in a better position to compete with AMD, which has long been known for its open-source-friendly approach in the Linux space.\nWhile this is a significant development, let me remind you that NVIDIA&apos;s transition to open-source is currently limited to the kernel modules. The driver&apos;s userspace components remain proprietary, which means that full open-source integration, particularly for gaming applications, may still be some way off.\nAs the tech community digests this news, many hope this could begin a broader shift towards open-source practices at NVIDIA, potentially leading to improved compatibility and performance for Linux users.\nOpen Source\n5 Linux commands you must know to keep your device running smoothly\nThe best Linux laptops you can buy: Expert tested\nThe best Linux distros for beginners\nMy 5 favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one)\n5 Linux commands you must know to keep your device running smoothly\nThe best Linux laptops you can buy: Expert tested\nThe best Linux distros for beginners\nMy 5 favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one) Editorial standards",

    "text": "(ZENIT Noticias / Madrid, 28.12.2023).- En el contexto del día de los santos inocentes, varios movimientos sociales convocaron “Rosarios” ante diversas clínicas de aborto en España, lo que ha provocado el despertar de los grupos de feministas y anticlericales que se han alzado con provocamientos e insultos hacia aquellos que rezaban de manera pacífica en las inmediaciones de los centros abortistas. Por su parte, el gobierno social-comunista de España mandó 5 furgones y 20 agentes que fueron desplegados para la convocatoria del Rezo del Rosario y la contra-manifestación feminista, sin embargo, han fijado su punto de mira en los católicos que rezaban, mientras que a las feministas les han dado barra libre para arremeter contra aquellos que rezaban sin provocar. Un total cerca unas 300 personas han salido a las calles para rezar el rosario por los niños que han sido abortados, más de 99.149 abortos al año, según el último estudio del Instituto de Política Familiar (IPF), lo que implica que al día se producen más de 253 abortos (cada 5 minutos un asesinato de un ser humano en el vientre materno). “Hemos venido para reivindicar que la vida se debe defender, esta batalla es cultural pero también debe ser espiritual”, así lo explica para ZENIT un joven de 25 años, Santiago, el cual no ha dudado en acercarse a la clínica Dátor, de Madrid, para sumarse a la convocatoria de la plataforma “Rezar No es Delito” y participar del Rosario que había sido convocado. Feministas arremeten contra quienes rezan Rosario frente a clínicas abortistas y provocan que Policía sancione y detenga a católicos que rezan ante inmediaciones de centros abortistas La convocatoria del movimiento provida fue contestado por grupos feministas que pretenden convertir el aborto en derecho, haciendo que el enfrentamiento fuese inevitable: los católicos con Rosario en mano y elevando su voz, mientras que las feministas hacían gritos ofensivos tanto para los católicos como para las personas congregadas. “Vamos a quemar la Conferencia Episcopal, con todos los obispos dentro”, “fuera rosarios de nuestros ovarios”, “Qué barbaridad que las que nunca paren nos prohíben abortar”, han sido los cánticos entonados por las feministas que pretendían intimidar a los católicos que, sin embargo, no han querido responder más que con la oración y cánticos a favor de la vida y Cristo Rey. Entre los asistentes, ha destacado la detención de varios jóvenes en Madrid, a los que les han pedido la documentación y exigido que subiesen a un furgón policial, siendo señalados como cabecillas de la convocatoria del Rosario, mientras que a las feministas que amenazaron e intimidaron no les han detenido ni tomado los datos. Así lo han denunciado desde los grupos organizadores del Rosario. Esta mañana delante del abortorio Dator.

    "title": "ABS Approves FEED for New Floating Wind Design",
    "text": "ABS approved the Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) documents for a deep water floating offshore wind platform design from ECO TLP, Inc. and MOCEAN-Offshore BV.\nThe design supports the largest wind turbines on the market and utilizes slip-formed cylindrical concrete hulls and a variety of anchor types. When combined with a hybrid spar tension-leg mooring system, the unit has a smaller footprint than traditional floaters using catenary mooring.\nWith FEED documents approved, the design moves into commercialization for site-specific projects.\n“ABS approval for non-site-specific FEED for a wide range of water depths and wind turbines sizes allows ECO TLP® to significantly reduce the certification process for commercial projects. Achieving this is an important milestone for our solution, allowing us to operate in the water safely and qualify for financial and insurance terms. We are proud to offer an economical, versatile, ecologically friendly platform that optimizes the wind turbine performance, substantially lowering operational and maintenance costs of the array over its lifetime,” said Nicole Johnson Murphy, CEO, ECO TLP Inc.\nSupporting ECO TLP’s marine, civil and structural engineering needs are MOCEAN-Offshore BV and Arup International Projects Ltd.",
