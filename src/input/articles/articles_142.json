Los responsables de la misma han intentado arreglar la avería durante una hora, sin éxito.\nTranscurrido ese tiempo han avisado a los bomberos, quienes tras comprobar que tampoco se podía reanudar la marcha de la instalación, han decidido ir rescatando poco a poco, mediante dos escalas, a todos los usuarios atrapados.\nSobre las 21.00 horas, los bomberos habían rescatado ya a personal que ocupaba diez cabinas de las 24, y seguían desalojando a más clientes, que se encuentran \"tranquilos\", sin que se hayan producido daños personales.",

    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — A Westside apartment complex has to ramp up security or it could risk being shut down. >>> STREAM ACTION NEWS JAX LIVE The City of Jacksonville’s Public Nuisance Abatement Board (PNAB) deemed Valencia Way Apartments a ‘public nuisance,’ on Thursday. It cited 11 qualifying factors of violent incidents, not including the murder at the complex that happened last week. DOWNLOAD: [Free Action News Jax app for alerts as news breaks ] Chief Morris Halyard III with JSO said the property currently has one security guard on the property and most of the cameras are inoperable. “We look out for ourselves,” Destiny said. She had family who lives at Valencia Way and visits often. “I don’t feel safe going outside with them [the kids]. It’s too much shooting, kids fighting, all that stuff.” During the Thursday afternoon meeting, the PNAB took jurisdiction of the complex. According to property records, Millennia Jacksonville owns the property. The owner was not present, but his attorney, Christopher Walker, agreed to most of the stipulations by the PNAB and the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office. Those changes include more security cameras and at least three JSO officers and a supervisor on the property for the next 60 days twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Walker said the owner of the complex cannot afford the manpower. Representatives for the sheriff’s office and the city plan to work with the owner to figure out a cost-effective way to make it all happen. Council member, Tyrona Clark-Murry, who represents District 9 where the complex is located, said those issues should be worked out in the next two weeks. A Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) will also be completed in the next few weeks to determine the exact changes that need to be made to the property. This intense takeover comes after crime has plagued the property for years. Recently, there have been three murders in three months. In October of last year, a teenager was killed at the apartment complex. Just five days later, a 36-year-old man was found dead at the complex. And, just last week, 27-year-old Nathaniel Barnard was also killed outside the complex. No arrests have been made in any of those cases. There have been 43 incidents within a half mile of the property in the last four months, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office crime mapping tool. We filtered it to only show the most violent crimes. The breakdown showed two homicides (not including the most recent murder), 15 burglaries, and 26 assaults in the last 123 days.

    "text": "La Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS), a través de su Escuela de Biología, inició hoy jueves 3 y hasta mañana viernes 4 de octubre de 2024, el Primer Seminario Internacional en Soluciones Basadas en la Naturaleza y Bioeconomía Circular (BIOEC). Este importante evento reafirma el compromiso de la UIS con la investigación y el desarrollo de soluciones innovadoras para enfrentar los desafíos ambientales actuales, como el cambio climático, la escasez de agua y la degradación de ecosistemas.\nCoordinado por el director Centro de Biotecnología & Agroindustria-ABC de la Facultad de Ciencias, el profesor Nelson Rodríguez López, el seminario reúne en jornadas académicas a expertos e investigadores nacionales e internacionales en el campo de la sostenibilidad, con el objetivo de fortalecer redes de colaboración en torno a las Soluciones Basadas en la Naturaleza (SbN) y la bioeconomía circular en Colombia. Estas soluciones, que aprovechan los procesos naturales para mejorar la resiliencia de los ecosistemas, ofrecen una oportunidad única para restaurar hábitats, gestionar recursos hídricos y combatir la deforestación, mientras se reducen los gases de efecto invernadero y se promueve la seguridad alimentaria.\nLa bioeconomía circular, pilar del seminario, busca optimizar el uso de recursos biológicos, minimizando la generación de residuos y potenciando la autosuficiencia alimentaria mediante prácticas como la agricultura regenerativa. La UIS se posiciona como un referente en el estudio y la implementación de estas estrategias, con el objetivo de aportar soluciones locales que puedan tener un impacto global.\nSebastián Rueda Serrano, estudiante de sexto semestre de Biología en la UIS, destaca la relevancia académica del seminario, describiéndolo como una oportunidad invaluable para el crecimiento académico. “El seminario es una experiencia enriquecedora, ya que integra diferentes disciplinas como la Microbiología, la Biología Molecular, la Agronomía y otras áreas relacionadas con el medio ambiente”, señaló Rueda. Además, destacó la importancia de que la Universidad Industrial de Santander tome la iniciativa de organizar este tipo de espacios, que no solo permiten a los estudiantes ampliar sus conocimientos, sino también interactuar con expertos nacionales e internacionales en un tema tan crucial y vigente como es el impacto ambiental y las estrategias para su recuperación.\nDe otra parte, David Johnson Monje, de nacionalidad canadiense y estudiante de la Universidad del Valle, resalta la importancia de la colaboración internacional en esta clase de eventos académicos. “Es gratificante contar con la presencia de personas de distintos países y áreas de investigación, compartiendo en un evento que reúne a grandes expertos en diversas temáticas”. Asimismo, subrayó que estos espacios son fundamentales para facilitar nuevas colaboraciones. “Es crucial crear estos encuentros donde científicos y estudiantes puedan relacionarse, conocer sus potenciales, compartir ideas y visualizar nuevos proyectos. Lo más valioso es que se genera un ambiente de aprendizaje continuo, ampliando el conocimiento. Nunca debemos dejar de aprender”\nEste Seminario Internacional en Soluciones Basadas en la Naturaleza y Bioeconomía Circular (BIOEC) refuerza el liderazgo de la UIS en la creación de iniciativas que promueven la sostenibilidad y la protección de los ecosistemas, reafirmando su papel como impulsora de cambios significativos para un futuro más consciente y ambientalmente responsable.",
