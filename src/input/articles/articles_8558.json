    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Two women who say they were sexually harassed by former chief deputy mayor Thomas Cook [ have sent a letter](https://interactive.wthr.com/pdfs/SexualHarresmentLetterHogsettOsili.pdf) to Mayor Joe Hogsett and City-County Council President Vop Osili. 13News obtained a copy of the letter. It reads in part: \"We write today to continue our urgent calls for transparency, accountability, and bold action from the City of Indianapolis to implement stronger sexual harassment and abuse prevention policies, an independent reporting system, and comprehensive support services for survivors.\" - The women also outlined four steps they want the city to take to prevent future abuse: - Hire third-party experts to audit and study the scale of the problem - Train and educate all employees, not just management, on workplace rights. - Provide an independent, third-party for survivors to report to. - Extend no-cost mental health services to survivors. Here is the full letter the women sent: On Aug. 7, Democratic Councilor Jesse Brown (D-13) shared a statement calling for Mayor Joe Hogsett (D-Indianapolis) to step down. Brown cites allegations of predatory behavior by Hogsett's [former chief deputy mayor, Thomas Cook](https://www.wthr.com/article/news/local/mayor-hogsett-announces-changes-to-cabinet-in-2021/531-ac0ad2b5-af30-4acd-a70d-50916c858b04). \"Any reasonable public official would recognize his culpability in these abuses,\" said Brown [in a statement posted online](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pygpQnOPKzRsS-rzmGsK8nhi2F-wz53y30jxYtjSo8w/edit). \"Any good public official would make sure that such abuses never, ever reoccurred.\" Brown says Hogsett has resisted calls for answers from city-county councilors. \"When councilors demanded a meeting with Hogsett to have their questions answered, only Hogsett attorneys and a silent, junior staffer attended the call,\" wrote Brown. Brown said Hogsett has failed to make sure something like the allegations doesn't happen again. \"Even now, weeks after news of Cook’s pattern of predation broke publicly, Hogsett has not implemented a clear and confidential process for reporting sexual harassment, nor has he provided sexual harassment training for all City employees,\" said Brown. 13News has received a copy of a letter that went out to all city-county employees on Aug. 5. It reads in part \"sexual harassment training is mandatory for all city and county elected officials, councilors and supervisory-level employees of the city and county government.\" The letter said that arrangements were being made for this mandatory training. It went on to say \"any employee who becomes aware of an incident of harassment, whether by experiencing the incident, witnessing the incident, or being told of it should report that incident to their immediate supervisor or any representative of management.\" On Aug. 8 Hogsett said \"every time a complaint was made, it was handed over to my legal team. It was fully investigated. Sanctions were leveled. He no longer works for me.\" Hogsett also said he complied with the sexual harassment law passed in 2019. The allegations of predatory behavior against Cook were revealed in reporting by the [IndyStar](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/investigations/2024/07/19/indianapolis-mayor-hogsett-aide-thomas-cook-accused-sexual-harassment/74444929007/) and [Mirror Indy](https://mirrorindy.org/indianapolis-mayor-joe-hogsett-thomas-cook-aide-sexual-harassment/). (Note: You can read more on the allegations in the before linked stories.) When the story first broke, Hogsett [posted a response on X](https://x.com/IndyMayorJoe/status/1814360034773741989), formerly known as Twitter. The posts read in part: \"Sexual harassment reporting protocols were updated as recently as 2023. This Administration remains committed to protecting the safety and wellbeing of every employee, and we will always seek ways to improve our policies and best practices.\" Brown declined an interview, saying he wanted to give the administration and fellow councilors a chance to respond before speaking to the press. Just before 1 p.m. on Thursday, the Republican caucus of the City-County Council announced they wanted an investigative committee to look into the allegations. They said they would introduce a resolution with Democratic councilors at the council's meeting on Aug. 12. They released a statement that said in part \"the fact that multiple women came forward over the years only to have their serious allegations about a senior administration official ignored is disturbing and need to be properly addressed.\" The statement went on to say \"in order to properly restore the trust in our executive branch, we must have an outside body thoroughly investigate these and any other allegations that may exist.",

    "text": "Barbra Streisand does not mince words. The\nEGOT winner has been vocal about her political views for many years and particularly critical of former president Donald Trump. Amid his bid to return to the position, Trump has been embroiled in multiple legal proceedings, giving his critics plenty to use as reasons for why he should not be reelected. During his first criminal trial, Streisand took to X, formally known as Twitter, to give her thoughts on the matter.\n“Trump is like a broken record endlessly repeating his lies, that he is the victim of a ‘witch hunt,’ is ‘innocent,’ and ‘I’ve never broken the law.’ Get a grip Donald! You have been indicted in four separate jurisdictions with 91 different felony charges,” Streisand\ntweeted. Babs didn’t stop there. Hours later, she took to the platform again tweeting, “It would be wonderful if more people judged more closely the character of a President. You don’t want a vain and vindictive man who is a pathological liar and whose only goals are more money and power to prop up his fragile ego. Like Donald Trump.”\nBarbra Streisand’s Plans if Trump is Reelected\nLike many a celebrity, and like herself during Trump’s first presidential run, Streisand proclaimed in late 2023 that she intends to leave the United States if the former president returns to the White House. The entertainer did not follow through with her 2016 promise, but this time around she has somewhat of a plan. During the interview with Stephen Colbert in which she stated her intent, Streisand said she’d like to move to England if necessary.\nStreisand might not have to leave the United States. As of this writing, oddsmakers have said the likelier outcome of the 2024 presidential election is a Joe Biden victory. The margins are narrow, though, so the fate of the country, and the fate of Streisand, remains to be seen.",

    "title": "Detox and treatment centre to open by March 31: MPP",
    "text": "A 12-bed drug detox and treatment facility that was expected open by November in Peterborough’s northeast end is still not open: the building is under extensive renovation, with a completion date (and an opening) expected by the end of March. The location is 24 Paddock Wood, a large house off Armour Road. It needs far more upgrades than originally planned, said Peterborough-Kawartha MPP Dave Smith. The Ontario government is helping to fund the facility, along with money from the city and County of Peterborough — and there’s an expectation to have it open by the end of the fiscal year (March 31). “There’s been some renovation challenges on it,” Smith said, of the building. He said city building officials have required the property to reach clinic-grade standards — and that hadn’t been anticipated. For years, 24 Paddock Wood had been the location of the Canadian Mental Health Association’s Safe Beds program, a non-medical program that allows people a temporary stay in times of crisis. The Safe Beds program has moved to a new location near downtown Peterborough (no address has been disclosed by the CMHA, for privacy reasons). You might be interested in Meantime Smith said it was expected that 24 Paddock Wood would need no more than “minor (building) modifications” to make it a 12-bed residential facility: six beds for drug withdrawal management, and six beds for people in drug treatment. That’s because the house had previously served for non-medical stays for people in crisis — and this was a similar use. But there is also drug withdrawal management to be offered, and Smith said city building officials wanted the facility to meet standards meant for medical clinics — and that means specialized fire suppression systems, for example. Smith said that some other municipalities haven’t required a clinic-grade building for this type of drug treatment and detox, which focuses very much on social therapy. But he said Peterborough officials “made the decision, for safety reasons,” to require clinic standards. “And that meant the tradespeople that we had to bring in for it were more in demand,” Smith said. “It (the renovation) has been significantly slower.” The renovation cost also escalated from about $120,000 to nearly $750,000, Smith said. He said the plan is to take unspent operational funding — unspent, since the facility was planned for a fall opening — and apply it to the renovation. Meantime Smith thinks the more extensive upgrades will pay off in the end. If the building is a up to medical clinic standards from the outset, he said, more detox services could be added later without need for further renovations. “It means putting in the work upfront — but it gives us the ability to expand at some point in the future,” Smith said. “And I think that's a good thing.” It was on May 2 at the CMHA offices on George Street that MPP Smith and Associate Minister for Mental Health and Addictions Michael Tibollo announced $1.138 million to operate six detox beds and six residential treatment beds as a two-year pilot program. Later, Peterborough city and county each voted to offer $200,000 to get the facility up and running. CMHA is expected to be the landlord and manager of the facility, while the local addiction services agency FourCast will run the programs. In his year-end interview Thursday, Smith said that working toward the funding announcement for the detox facility was his highlight of 2023. And he said he’s looking forward to an opening of the facility in early 2024, sometime prior to March 31. “We still are on pace to have it open before the end of the fiscal year.”",
