    "text": "JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Someone donating their body to science continues to give after their final breath as medical students and researchers learn, treat, and heal. Wednesday, families whose loved ones donated their bodies were honored at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.\nA Ceremony of Thanksgiving was held in memory of Anatomical Donors who gave their bodies to UMMC so the next generation of health care professionals could be educated. Medical students thanked the families of donors who are their first patients.\n“It kind of brought closure to the decision that he made,” said Alma Dixon.\nHer husband, Connie Dixon Sr., died last March at the age of 74. He was a kidney transplant recipient in 2011.\n“He decided that he wanted to donate his entire body to the University of Mississippi Medical Center so that future doctors and nurses, and health care professionals would be able to study the body,” said Dixon.\n“We learned more from them than we ever will in a classroom,” said Ainsley Sinclair, a first-year Biomedical Sciences grad student. She was among the six students who thanked the families.\nRelatives have the option of receiving the donor’s remains or having them buried at the Medical Center Cemetery.\n“For us, it’s really important to put a face of a relative to those donors,” said Department of Advanced Biomedical Education Chair Dr. Norma Ojeda.\nStudents spend countless hours with the donors, learning the body’s anatomy and function.\n“We recognize the family members, and we give a little more humanity to that selfless act, and we kind of consider them our big family now,” said Ojeda.\nOne hundred 20 donors were honored during the ceremony. One hundred 70 medical students are benefiting from the knowledge they gain from the donors.\nWant more WLBT news in your inbox?

    "text": "Il maltempo sta creando notevoli disagi ai collegamenti marittimi verso le isole di Ischia e Procida. A causa del vento sostenuto e del mare molto mosso, numerose corse degli aliscafi sono state cancellate, mentre altre sono state sospese dalle compagnie di navigazione.\nAttualmente, tutti i collegamenti veloci da e per il porto di Forio risultano interrotti, mentre restano regolari le partenze e gli arrivi a Casamicciola. Cancellate invece diverse corse programmate dal Molo Beverello di Napoli verso Marina Grande a Procida e Ischia Porto.\nSituazione più stabile per i collegamenti effettuati con navi traghetto, che al momento operano regolarmente sia dal porto di Napoli Porta di Massa che da Pozzuoli . Tuttavia, si teme che ulteriori peggioramenti delle condizioni meteo possano compromettere anche questi servizi nelle prossime ore.\nLa situazione viene monitorata costantemente dalle autorità portuali e dalle compagnie di navigazione, che invitano i passeggeri a verificare aggiornamenti e variazioni sui programmi di viaggio.",
