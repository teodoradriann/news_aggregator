    "title": "'Ignorant' Lauren Boebert scorched online for 'deeply stupid analogy' about debate",
    "text": "MAGA Republican and accused\ncarpetbagger Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert on Thursday asked the tough question everyone wants to know — why should the commander-in-chief be able to refuse a debate drug-test when U.S. troops cannot?\nBoebert's question echoes a familiar right-wing talking point that's made the rounds in recent days in what appears to be an effort to pre-shield former President Donald\nTrump ahead of the debate Thursday night on CNN.\nTrump and his fellow conservatives have floated the idea for days that Biden will use performance-enhancing drugs as they go toe-to-toe. Political analysts have suggested Trump fears his attacks on Biden have lowered the bar the president must clear to win — and is trying to prepare his base for his own defeat.\n\"There is no evidence that Biden has used or plans to use performance-enhancing drugs,\" writes Washington Post political reporter Hannah Knowles. \"But Trump and his supporters have spread the baseless claim widely.\"\nBefore Boebert, Rep. Nancy Mace expressed similar sentiments.\nALSO READ:\nMarjorie Taylor Greene buys condo in 'crime ridden hell hole' Mace (R-SC) raised the alarm about the terrifying prospect that Biden could be on a popular ADHD medication.\n\"How much Adderall are they gonna give him?\" Mace asked. \"How many vitamins is he gonna be on?\"\nNot one to avoid the GOP playbook, Boebert did her part to cast doubt on the upcoming intellectual exchange of ideas.\n\"Members of our military cannot just refuse a drug test because they don’t want to take one,\" she wrote on X. \"Why is the Commander in Chief any different?\"\nAnd when Boebert spoke, the internet laughed.\n\"This is such a\ndeeply stupid analogy,\" wrote conservative Army Iraq War Veteran Peter Henlein. \"There is no good debate drug. If there was, I am sure both candidates would be taking it.\"\n\"\nWhen can we drug test you Lauren?\" questioned @MailePRMedia.\n\"Members of the military\ncan’t be convicted felons,\" retorted @jeffreymlevy. \"Why is the republican nominee for President and Commander in Chief any different?\"\n\"Hopefully your son is going to be required to take a\ndrug test as part of his probation?\" @DenisonBarbs fired back.\n\"Everyone has the right to be stupid and ignorant, but you just\nabuse that privilege,\" said @ChidiNwatu.\nBoebert was among four of just 18 Republican party-endorsed candidates to\nwin their primary on Tuesday night. She moved to the reliably Republican Fourth Congressional District, where Republican Rep. Ken Buck resigned in March, after facing a near-inevitable loss in her existing district.",

    "text": "AEP: Miles de personas sin electricidad en los condados de Cameron e Hidalgo debido al calor extremo Más de 3.340 clientes de AEP están sin electricidad en los condados de Cameron e Hidalgo debido al calor extremo, según un portavoz. El mapa de apagones de AEP muestra que la mayoría de los apagones están en el condado de Hidalgo, donde 2.283 clientes están experimentando apagones. \"El calor extremo está causando varios apagones en todo el Valle\", dijo Dan Lucio, portavoz de AEP, a Noticias RGV. El calor extremo significa un mayor uso de aires acondicionados, lo que equivale a una mayor demanda y uso de electricidad en la red eléctrica. Algunos de estos cortes han sido breves, mientras que otros están tardando un poco más en restablecerse. Nuestros equipos están trabajando para restablecer el suministro. Advertencias de calor excesivo y advertencias de calor están en vigor en todo el Valle del Río Grande hasta el jueves a las 7 pm.

    "text": "2023-12-28 19:57:47 A young man in “severe hypothermia” was discovered Thursday, December 28 late in the morning at Orly airport in the landing gear of an Air Algérie flight arriving from Oran, Agence France-Presse learned from the Créteil prosecutor’s office. This is a person without identity documents and whose age is estimated between 20 and 30 years old, he said. The man was transported in serious condition to Henri-Mondor hospital in Créteil, according to the prosecution, which specified that the air transport gendarmerie (GTA) was in charge of the investigation. Earlier Thursday, an airport source explained that the young man was “alive but in absolute emergency because of severe hypothermia”. The GTA has confirmed a “seriously injured person” at Orly, without further details immediately. The discovery took place “around 10:30-11 a.m.”a priori lors of “technical checks” of the device, a source close to the matter told AFP, confirming that the man, who was “transported to hospital by firefighters”was not “not deceased”. A mortality rate of 77% Several cases of stowaways hidden in the landing gear of planes, unheated or pressurized spaces, have marked the news in recent years. In April, the body of a man was found at Amsterdam-Schiphol upon the arrival of a plane from Toronto (Canada), but apparently had previously passed through Nigeria. Four months earlier, two stowaways, also dead, were discovered hidden in the storage space of the landing gear of a plane coming from Santiago de Chile to Bogota. At the cruising altitude of commercial aircraft, 12 kilometers, the air temperature plunges below −50°C, while the lack of oxygen can be fatal. According to global statistics from the American Civil Aviation Authority (FAA) cited in January 2022 by the New York Times, between 1947 and 2021, 132 people attempted to travel clandestinely by hiding in aircraft landing gears. One hundred and two of them died, a mortality rate of 77%, according to the same source.
