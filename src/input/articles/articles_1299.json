    "text": "Visit Birds Tell Us to Act on Climate page Beloved by the public, bird enthusiasts, and researchers alike, finches are among our most familiar birds. Yet, they are deceptively complex, presenting some of North America’s most intricate avian life histories and identification challenges. Covering this diverse, multifaceted group in a single, accessible guide requires finesse and expertise. Enter Lillian Stokes and Matt Young. For decades, Stokes and her husband Don have been trusted voices in birding, sharing their expertise through 35 Stokes Guides—selling more than 5 million copies—and a popular television series, reaching millions of homes. As an award-winning nature writer and photographer, Lillian has also managed an active blog since 2006. Young, the founder of the Finch Research Network , is a leading authority on North American finches. Together, they have created The Stokes Guide to Finches of the United States and Canada, an authoritative and indispensable compendium that achieves the rare feat of offering something for everyone, making it a must-have for any naturalist’s library. As a reference guide, it is a breath of fresh air. Going beyond the expected identification tips, the book covers everything from fundamental basics (“What is a finch?”) to advanced topics such as the call types, food sources, and distributions of the birds that make up the confounding Red Crossbill complex, of which Young is an expert. As usual, the species profiles are the bulk of the content, and this comprehensive handbook provides detailed life history information for 18 breeding finches, nine vagrants, and 17 Hawaiian honeycreepers, covering vocalizations, breeding, diet, habitat, migration, conservation, and distribution. One of the book's most notable features is its innovative approach to vocalizations, dividing them into ones given by males, females, and both, not just “calls” and “songs.” This distinction reflects recent scientific insights into oft-overlooked female bird songs, which is important for better understanding and conserving the birds we love. Additionally, the guide presents clear and concise range maps for species, subspecies, and even irruptions, using familiar color palettes and intuitive features like dashed lines and dots. Beyond the species overviews, chapters covering feeding and attracting finches, movements, irruptions , and research and conservation efforts empower readers in meaningful ways with actionable tips and advice. This blend of practical information and thoroughness makes the guide a powerful resource that perfectly balances breadth and depth in a compact and engaging format. Visually, the guide is a feast, immersing readers in the vibrant world of finches. Featuring more than 345 stunning photographs, it provides more than simple images to help with identification points (which are still appreciated when present). From flocks of Evening Grosbeaks filling a tray feeder and Redpolls working through a weedy field to White-winged Crossbills migrating past the dunes of Tadoussac, Québec, the images are emblematic, educational, and inspiring. Interspersed among these photos and species accounts are informative deep dives and detailed identification guides. Examples include a two-page spread on telling apart common red finches (Purple, House, and Cassin’s) and a four-page layout for distinguishing Common and Hoary Redpolls—still useful despite recent taxonomic changes . Tables, charts, and spectrograms enrich the guide, offering valuable insights into challenging species complexes like Red Crossbill, which is covered in an exhaustive 40-page breakdown. Perhaps Stokes and Young’s most significant achievement, however, is the dedicated section on endangered Hawaiian honeycreepers—descendants of rosefinches from Central Asia who, five to seven million years ago, found their way to Hawai’i and eventually evolved into more than 50 distinct species through adaptive radiation. Unfortunately, habitat loss, human activity, pests, and diseases like avian malaria reduced their numbers to just 17 species today , 11 of which are endangered, with several in fear of vanishing forever soon. At the time of writing this review, the ‘Akikiki is functionally extinct in the wild, with only 0-1 individuals likely remaining (per Young), highlighting the alarming rate at which we are losing this once diverse group of finches. Historically, Hawai’i’s birds have seldom appeared in North American field or reference guides. This is because the region’s native avifauna shares closer affinities with birds from Asia and Oceania than mainland U.S. birds. However, since the American Birding Association included Hawai’i in their ABA Area in 2016, there has been a significant shift in the collective effort to showcase the remarkable species of Hawai’i and the severe conservation challenges they face in the world’s bird extinction capital. By including the honeycreepers, this book provides the most complete coverage of all U.S. and Canadian finches while raising awareness about the importance of protecting these threatened species. If it seems from this review as though the The Stokes Guide to Finches does it all, that’s because it does. This is much more than a mere finch identification manual. A testament to these birds’ remarkable depth and diversity, the guide is just as much a vibrant exploration and celebration of finches both familiar and irregular. That it does all of this while balancing rigorous detail with accessibility makes it an exceptional and essential resource for anyone passionate about finches and dedicated to their conservation. The Stokes Guide to Finches of the United States and Canada, by Lillian Stokes and Matt Young, 352 pages, $21.99. Available here from Little, Brown and Company.",

    "text": "Os trabalhadores da Boeing (NYSE: BA ) entraram em greve na zona de Seattle , nos Estados Unidos , após rejeitarem um novo contrato proposto pela construtora aeronáutica.\nEsta paralisação vai abranger cerca de 33 mil trabalhadores da montagem de aviões, o que levou a empresa a suspender a produção das aeronaves mais vendidas .\nA Associação Internacional de Maquinistas e Trabalhadores Aeroespaciais informou que os trabalhadores da Boeing rejeitaram um contrato que teria aumentado os seus salários em 25% ao longo de quatro anos.\nO sindicato acrescentou que 94,6% tinham votado a favor da rejeição do contrato e 96% tinham votado a favor da greve . Só era necessária uma maioria de dois terços para que a greve fosse realizada.\nOs dirigentes sindicais tinham inicialmente aconselhado os seus membros a aceitarem o contrato proposto no início desta semana. Para além de aumentar os salários, o contrato asseguraria a construção do próximo avião comercial da Boeing na região de Seattle, desde que o projeto começasse antes do fim do contrato.\nTrabalhadores queixam-se da estagnação dos saláriosOs trabalhadores da Boeing dizem estar zangados com a estagnação dos salários e com as concessões que fizeram desde 2008, em matéria de pensões e cuidados de saúde.\n“Trata-se de respeito, de abordar o passado e de lutar pelo nosso futuro”, disse o presidente do Distrito 751 da IAM, Jon Holden, ao anunciar o resultado da votação dos trabalhadores.\nA Boeing sublinhou que estava “pronta para voltar à mesa de negociações para chegar a um novo acordo” após a votação.\n“A mensagem foi clara: o acordo provisório que alcançámos com a liderança do IAM não era aceitável para os membros. Continuamos empenhados em restabelecer a nossa relação com os nossos trabalhadores e o sindicato”, declarou a empresa em comunicado.\nA greve ignorou um apelo de última hora do novo diretor executivo da Boeing, Kelly Ortberg , nomeado no mês passado. Pouco antes da votação, Ortberg avisou os trabalhadores que a greve colocaria a “recuperação da empresa em perigo” e disse que “ninguém ganharia” com uma greve.",

    "text": "La Presidenta Municipal de Benito Juárez, [Ana Paty Peralta](https://www.sdpnoticias.com/estados/quintana-roo/ana-paty-peralta-cancun-se-recupera-de-inmediato/), ha reafirmado su compromiso por hacer de Cancún una Ciudad del Bienestar al instruir a la Dirección General de Servicios Públicos a intensificar las labores de limpieza y mantenimiento en parques, camellones y áreas verdes. Estas acciones buscan mejorar la imagen urbana y crear un entorno digno para la ciudadanía. La administración municipal reconoce que un entorno limpio y bien cuidado es fundamental para el bienestar y la calidad de vida de los habitantes. Las brigadas de limpieza están distribuidas en diversas zonas del municipio, enfocándose en la recolección de basura vegetal, que es una problemática recurrente en las calles debido a la caída de hojas y desechos de los árboles. Este jueves, las cuadrillas atendieron avenidas clave como Kabah, Yaxchilán y Av. Labná, así como Supermanzanas 15, 20, 90 y 219, entre otras. Estas labores incluyen poda de árboles, barrido y limpieza general, y son parte de un esfuerzo continuo para asegurar un ambiente seguro y saludable para todos los ciudadanos. Además de la limpieza regular, se están implementando medidas preventivas para evitar encharcamientos en las calles, especialmente durante la temporada de lluvias. La administración municipal está comprometida en mantener una infraestructura urbana que no solo sea estética, sino también funcional y resistente a fenómenos climáticos.

    "text": "It's June end, and sowing has begun in parts of Maharashtra. However, the banks have not met even 50% of the crop loan disbursal target in Vidarbha for the Kharif season, reported.A large section of farmers depend on annual crop loans to meet their cultivation expenses each year. The PSU banks, which have the biggest share, have barely covered 30% of the target, shows the progress report maintained by the state govt.Maharashtra deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis had warned during a state-level banker committee meeting of an FIR against bankers if they insist on CIBIL scores before lending to farmers. Vidarbha's 11 districts are divided into Nagpur and Amravati divisions. In Amravati division, which has agrarian-crisis-ridden districts, the banks have so far covered 48% of their target of lending over Rs 8,028 crore for the Kharif season. In Nagpur division, the target has been fixed at Rs 5,247 crore out of which Rs 2,355 crore has been lent. This amounts to 44% of the target.PSU banks have met 25% of the target in Nagpur and 30% in Amravati.",
