    "text": "Venezuelan socialist regime strongman and long-suspected drug lord Diosdado Cabello claimed on Wednesday evening that YouTube awarded his television show Con el Mazo Dando (“Hitting with the Mallet”) a commemorative plaque for allegedly reaching 100,000 subscribers on its YouTube channel .\n“They sent me this plaque, get wrecked, escualidos! [‘scrawny ones,’ a slang term for the opposition],” Cabello said , claiming that YouTube administrators sent him a letter “congratulating [him] for the content and international reach of the channel.”\n“The vermin cut [my channels] every time they can,” he continued.\nCabello “predicted” that the award would lead to the closure of his YouTube channel, claiming that long-time critics, such as Venezuelan journalist Alberto Ravell, would “exert pressure” to such an end.\n“Next week, they will knock down this channel. I guarantee it,” Cabello said. “You will see because, here, the Ravells will get a hernia in because they have not even been thanked, and they were looking for me to give me the plaque.”\n#EnFotos 📷| Primer Vicepresidente del PSUV, @dcabellor dio a conocer que recibió una Placa del equipo de YouTube, en reconocimiento al crecimiento continuo de su canal Con El Mazo Dando. #DesinstalaElOdio pic.twitter.com/pIiOVvYfq0\n— VTV CANAL 8 (@VTVcanal8) August 8, 2024\nCabello, a former member of the Venezuelan military, is widely known as one of the most powerful members of Venezuela’s authoritarian socialist regime, having occupied numerous high-ranking positions throughout the past 25 years. Cabello is presently the vice president of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) and one of the lawmakers of the National Assembly, which the Maduro regime seized control of from the Venezuelan opposition through a sham election held in December 2020.\nCabello was a close ally of late socialist dictator Hugo Chávez and was one of the military officials who participated in Chávez’s failed February 1992 coup attempt against the government of former President Carlos Andrés Pérez.\nU.S. authorities have long accused Cabello of being one of the leading figures of the Cartel of the Suns, an intercontinental cocaine trafficking operation that high-ranking members of the Venezuelan military and some PSUV leading figures run.\nExperts have accused the Cartel of the Suns of engaging in “asymmetric warfare” against the United States by trafficking cocaine into the U.S. The socialist drug cartel is believed to have forged alliances with the Shiite jihadist organization Hezbollah and other drug trafficking organizations, such as the Mexican Sinaloa Cartel, the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and the National Liberation Army (ELN) terrorist organization.\nThe Southern District of New York federal court indicted Cabello in March 2020 on charges of conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine, and associated firearms charges. Since then, U.S. authorities have enacted a still-active $10 million bounty for information that can lead to Cabello’s arrest and/or conviction. The Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Cabello and included him on its Specially Designated Nationals list in 2018.\nEl Mazo , Cabello’s weekly Wednesday evening show, was launched in February 2014 amidst a wave of protests against the Maduro regime that took place at the time.\nThe show is infamously known for featuring Cabello espousing insults and issuing intimidating threats against journalists, activists, dissidents, and critics of the ruling socialist regime — including presidents and government officials of other countries. El Mazo is commonly recorded in front of an audience of socialists, military officials, and other “VIP” guests. Socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro is a recurring guest on the show.\n#VenezuelaSeRespeta\nRESUMEN DEL PROGRAMA CON EL MAZO DANDO #489 (07-08-24)\n¡Reviéntense escuálidos! Youtube otorga placa de reconocimiento al canal de Con el Mazo Dando https://t.co/b9LaPpjZbp\nCabello: ¡Nosotros lo advertimos! Edmundo González es un asesino… pic.twitter.com/tatr4MCBxm\n— Con el Mazo Dando (@ConElMazoDando) August 8, 2024\nCabello’s show is broadcast locally through state-owned television channels, such as Venezolana de Television and TVes, and online platforms, such as YouTube . Both Cabello and his show have extensive presences across several social media platforms .\nSeveral of the show’s past broadcasts have featured Cabello openly leaking private conversations between journalists or politicians that the socialist regime’s intelligence apparatus obtained by breaching the privacy of its participants in violation of Venezuela’s own privacy laws.\nIn 2015, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) denounced Cabello and Con El Mazo Dando after the show revealed the names and exact locations of a group of people that had come before an IACHR hearing that took place at the time.\nGoogle states that the plaques distributed throughout YouTube’s Creator Awards program are the video platform’s way of “recognizing the extraordinary effort creators put into their growing channels and to build thriving communities, responsibly.”\nChristian K.

    "title": "Glasgow student to drive ambulance to Rafah border to help evacuations from Gaza",
    "text": "A Glasgow student is set to drive an ambulance to the Egypt-Gaza border to provide medical relief and to help evacuate civilians from Gaza.\nOn Thursday March 21, Umran Ali Javaid, a mature student at Glasgow Caledonian University, will set off from Glasgow in a second-hand ambulance equipped with a portable neonatal ventilator, providing breathing support for ill babies.\nTravelling for \"about six to seven days\" to reach the Rafah border between Egypt and Gaza, his journey will see him take a ferry from Dover to France before travelling through Europe.\nIt is not the first time the international tourism and events student, who did not wish to share his age, has undertaken such a journey, as he personally drove another ambulance to the Polish-Ukrainian border to help refugees fleeing the Russian invasion in March 2022.\nThe journey to Gaza will see him deliver his 41st ambulance for humanitarian aid, some of which he has delivered by himself, and others he has delivered with friends.\n\"The ambulances I take save lives and that's why I continue doing this,\" Mr Javaid told the PA news agency.\n\"Ambulances are a good way to evacuate civilians from danger zones as it gives the injured temporary medical relief - they also have distinct markings, signs and sirens which makes them easier to identify.\n\"During the five-day ceasefire in Gaza, a journalist saw babies (in the hospital) in their mothers' arms passing away due to hunger as there were no portable ventilators and they could not be evacuated.\n\"The new ambulance I bought is kind of more of a high dependency unit to support the lives of infants - it could be used for decades if it's not bombed or shot.\n\"The ambulances I delivered to Ukraine only had basic equipment like defibrillators but the recent ones are better equipped to save lives.\"\nMr Javaid said he is expecting a greater challenge in taking an ambulance to Gaza than he faced journeying to Ukraine because nearby Poland had been \"very accommodating\" with a \"clear structure of bringing in aid\".\n\"The first time I went to the Gaza Strip, I was the driver for a convoy and didn't know what I was doing but saw the difference ambulances make in saving lives,\" said Mr Javaid, who will be visiting Gaza for a third time.\n\"When the Ukraine war happened I was there during the first couple of weeks and there were thousands of people needing help and seeing children and mothers in pain stayed with me,\" said Mr Javaid.\nThe five-month-old war that was triggered by Hamas's October 7 massacre in southern Israel has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians and driven some 80% of Gaza's 2.3 million people from their homes.\nThe UN says a quarter of the population is starving.\nThe militant attack that sparked the conflict killed around 1,200 people and saw some 250 taken hostage.\nSpeaking in Westminster, Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron said: \"If Israel really wanted to help, they could open Ashdod port which is in Israel, which is a fully functioning port that could really maximise the delivery of aid from Cyprus straight into Israel and therefore into Gaza.\"\nWith an approval from COGAT (Co-ordination of Government Activities in the Territories) in Israel and the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr Javaid would be handing over the ambulance to UN agency UNRWA, the largest humanitarian organisation working inside Gaza.\n\"I know I can make a difference since I have been doing this for a while and have experience,\" he added.\nAs Mr Javaid moves towards the conclusion of his studies, he plans to start an events company and use the profits to provide humanitarian aid.\n\"I started studying so that I can organise my own events,\" he said.\n\"This is still in the planning stage but I will organise a big event/festival for families for thousands of people.\n\"It will be my own business however the profit I make, a part of that will help me buy ambulances on a larger scale. I will donate ambulances to UK care homes and donate them abroad too.\"\nLeo Varadkar denies softening language on Gaza during US trip\nO'Neill vows to press Biden to be a 'strong partner for peace' in Middle East\nFirst Minister to 'watch a proper game of cricket' after standing down\nCheltenham Festival goer suffers serious head injuries during assault",

    "text": "With all eyes on the Texas power grid, Pablo Vegas, the head of ERCOT insisted Friday that there’s no reason to expect a repeat of February 2021 when more than four million homes were left in the dark.\n“I want to let you know and reassure you that we are using every tool in our toolbox to make sure the grid is absolutely ready and prepared to deliver energy to all Texans throughout this weather event. The grid is better prepared than it has ever been before in particular as it relates to cold weather events like that is approaching,” said Vegas.\nFor now, the system operator isn’t calling for conservation.\nBut come Tuesday morning, its forecast shows demand narrowing at times within a few hundred megawatts of the available supply, narrowing again Tuesday night.\n “Tuesday morning, we're likely to set an all-time wintertime demand record,” said Rice University environmental engineering professor Daniel Cohan.\nCohan said tight conditions will come first with the arrival of the storm’s coldest temps and later, as wind and solar power drop off.\n“They're pretty optimistic about how well the coal and gas plants are going to perform next week. That's not been the case the past few winter storms that we've had. We know maintenance steps have been done, and really remains to be seen whether those thermal power plants, many of them more than 30 years old, hold up as well as ERCOT expects them to,” said Cohan.",

Photo : Getty Images\nLa coparentalité est un peu plus délicate pour elle et son ex car l’ancien couple, qui s’est séparé en 2018, vit désormais sur des continents différents et elle a admis qu’elle ressentait pour « tous les autres parents célibataires dans la même situation ».\nLui partageant une photo d’elle et de ses deux enfants page de médias sociaux, Una a écrit : « Cette année, nous avons passé notre « jour de Noël » à Cork. Tous les deux ans, depuis quelques années, nous n’avons pas pu passer Noël ensemble, et c’est une chose à laquelle je ne m’habituerai jamais complètement, surtout lorsqu’ils sont encore si jeunes.\n«Je compatis avec tous les autres parents célibataires dans la même situation cette année. Je vous souhaite à tous un très joyeux Noël et une bonne année, du mien à la vôtre.\nBen et sa nouvelle épouse Jackie, qu’il a épousée le jour où son divorce avec Una a été finalisé, partagent deux filles, Farrah, quatre ans, et Olympia, 10 mois.\nBen Foden avec ses quatre enfants.

    "text": "Egg prices are increasing this holiday season\nCOLCHESTER, CT (WFSB) - As the holidays approach, egg prices are going up.\nChannel 3 advised customers that prices might be higher the next time they shop for eggs.\nSome people may also have a hard time finding eggs in the aisles.\n“It’s the perfect storm for high prices in the egg industry right now,” said Hershal Tyles, General Manager of Mitlitsky Eggs.\nThis is a busy time of year at Mitlitsky Eggs in Lebanon. Their warehouse is usually chock-full.\nHowever, product is moving quickly and the warehouse is seeing empty space.\n“There’s a lot of panic buying,” Tiles said.\nThe Bird Flu is partly to blame for this situation.\n“We’ve seem some outbreaks in the last month in Iowa. And that affected close to 10-million birds and that sent the market to the races,” Tiles explained.\nMitlitsky’s suppliers have not been impacted, but many others are, causing stores to increase prices.\nNoel’s Market Manager, Bob Crowell, is getting the store ready for Christmas shoppers. Eggs seem to be on everyone’s list.\n“We were one of the lowest prices in town, everyone was coming here, then we had a spike from our retailer also so... all the prices are in line now,\" Crowell said.\nCrowell mentioned that some eggs have been hard to get, especially the 18-packs.\nKeri Vincent often shops for her eggs at Noel’s.\n“I really only ever come here because they seem to be the freshest,” she said.\nSome states require cage free hens, but that increases the price of eggs even more.\n“The cost rolls down to the consumer. Consumers are used to paying a dollar or two for eggs. Now they’re up on the shelves for five or six dollars,” said Matt Mitlitsky from Mitlitsky’s eggs.\nInflation is yet another factor causing this increase in egg prices.\n“They will come down. They go up and down every year. It was a record low for a while, then it shot back up,” Crowell said.\nAfter the holidays, the demand for eggs should go down, which will help to lower the prices.\nHowever, as winter approaches, storms could fluctuate prices again.\nCopyright 2024 WFSB.

    "text": "[luspagnolu](/user/luspagnolu)a [publico.es](/go/link/3969477) [#1](c1#c-1) Ahora se han humanizado, en lugar de robarlos proponen comprárselos, además prohibiendo el aborto y poniendo trabas a la educación sexual tienen la producción asegurada.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Es que no hay plata, y además, los niños ya están robados y no se van a destinar, así que ¿para qué gastarse la pasta?\nA ver qué dice el subnormal de siempre respecto a esto. Seguro que es capaz de decir que esos niños han sido vendidos y no puede pedirse su devolución o algo similar.\n[#6](c6#c-6) [#42](c42#c-42) [#46](c46#c-46)\nEn serio, por qué perdéis el tiempo con esta gente? Bloqueo y a vivir. Están aquí para joder, nada más.\nNo os llega con Ana Rosa, la Griso, Ferreras, Losantos, Herrera, ABC, El Mundo, etc? Aquí tenéis la oportunidad de taparles la boca a esta gentecilla que a saber por qué están aquí diciendo estas chorradas\n\"Según la organización pro derechos humanos Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, cerca de 500 bebés fueron robados por la dictadura a sus progenitores, en su mayoría opositores al régimen. En muchos casos, sostiene la organización, las madres que dieron a luz en centros clandestinos de detención y tortura, fueron desaparecidas para siempre, asesinadas o tiradas con vida al mar.\"\nengendros del averno\n[#52](c52#c-52) uff el cansino ese del mensaje kilométrico?\nEse también está entre mis excepciones, igual que el que repetía le mensaje en cada noticia del bitcoin.\nPero es que yo los insultos del calibre de este usuario es que debería estar baneado por el resto del los días.\n[#37](c37#c-37) Pero aún no tienes a ese ente en el ignore? si de cada 10 palabras 20 son insultos...\nLuego preguntan porqué meneame se va al garete..\n[#48](c48#c-48) No uso mucho el ignore, solo tengo a un usuario, el que no quiere hacer crecer a sus hijos en la miseria...\n[#27](c27#c-27) La cuestión es si es necesario un organismo solo para eso o puede derivarse a otro ya existente.\n[#29](c29#c-29) Vaya, qué sorpresa, uno de los seres con mayor nivel de miseria de esta web, y mira que el nivel es alto, alegrándose de que no puedan investigarse los secuestros de niños en una dictadura. Por lo que sea, eh?\nPues ya solo con el banco genético que ha creado ya tiene mayor utilidad que la que puedan tener 10000 seres como tú en 10000 vidas.\n[#31](c31#c-31) ¿Quién se ha alegrado de nada?\nResultados, hay un estudio genético, ok, ¿Cuales son los resultados?\nTu si que eres miserable...\nEl gobierno dice que el organismo actuaba \"por iniciativa propia, para la individualización de los responsables de posibles hechos criminales\"\nA los que defienden la libertad no les gusta que los organismos sean independientes, sobre todo estos organismos que TIENEN LA OBLIGACION de ser independientes de cualquier gobierno o ideología política.\nEspero que alguien viole la LOPD y ponga esos archivos a salvo\n[#56](c56#c-56) Si tienes empatía, dona a una ONG o asociación que realice esa tarea. Que yo no quiera que esto sea financiado coercitivamente/via impuestos no significa en absoluto que esté en contra de que se realice la tarea, de forma privada.\nLa empatía, con el dinero propio, no con el ajeno.\n[#23](c23#c-23) Es lo que sospecho, se centran en el número de niños robados, los que reconocen ciertos organismos y los que reconoce el gobierno, pero ¿y los logros de este organismo? ¿cuál es la justificación del gasto? ¿Hay que soltar billetes aunque no haya resultados?\n[#4](c4#c-4) Ni de ti me esperaba defender semejante indignidad. Tiempo suficiente es todo el necesario para la resolución de todos los casos de un crimen tan atroz como es robar seres humanos. Y son cientos.\n[#10](c10#c-10) Semejante personaje despreciable. Como si fuera una \"investigación\" que tarda un tiempo concreto. Es un organismo que se encarga de hacer pruebas de ADN a la población para buscar familiares cercanos de gente que en la mayoría de los casos es por sospecha que puede ser un niño robado o los familiares terminan confesando...\nNo se puede caer más bajo que defender algo así.\n[#10](c10#c-10) No sé cómo te aguantas y llamas simplemente «indigno» a un saco de mierda así. En serio, todo mi respeto a tu templanza\n[#4](c4#c-4) Han tenido 20 años para investigar eso\nEso no es completamente cierto. En el artículo dicen claramente que fue fundada en el 92. No han tenido 20 años, han tenido 30.\nY teniendo en cuenta que 10 años antes ya estaba la Comisión Nacional por la Desaparición de Personas que hacía lo mismo y cuyas funciones luego asumió el organismo que ha cerrado Milei, en realidad han tenido 40 años.\n[#28](c28#c-28) Hace 40 años no habia la capacidad de hacer tests genéticos en cantidad, disponibilidad y coste como la que hay ahora.\n[#38](c38#c-38) Las pruebas genéticas para investigar la filiación con personas desaparecidas las lleva el Banco Nacional de Datos Genéticos y son gratuitas. Para quien tiene sospechas de ser hijo/a de algún desaparecido, quien realmente resuelve el tema es está organización, a la que cualquiera puede acudir y que además lo hace de forma gratuita. No necesitas añadir una capa de burocracia adicional en forma de otra organización.\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Nacional_de_Datos_Genéticos\n[#4](c4#c-4) Te voy a poner un ejemplo: España\nAquí hemos tenido 50 años (y contando) y todavía hay un montón de barbaridades que se hicieron en la dictadura de Franco que siguen sin saberse.\nY eso es así porque todavía hay gente viva y con poder, interesada en que no se sepa.\nY en Argentina, igual. Y esa gente con poder ha votado a Milei para que parara esas investigaciones, no sea que se descubra que algún heredero de una familia de bien resulta que tiene genes de rojo piojoso.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Precisamente. Este es de los que dice que no hay que reabrir heridas del pasado obviando que los delitos de lesa humanidad no prescriben\n[#50](c50#c-50) Viniendo del tío que llama fascistas a los que piden acabar con los difusores de fake news racistas, en realidad tu opinión respecto a esto se podía intuir. Has confirmado lo que pareces esmerarte en demostrar cada día; das asco. No eres más que otro ultra conservador sin escrúpulos, como tu máximo héroe, el sociópata Milei.",

    "text": "World's First Enhanced Small Particle (ESP™) Detection Sorter Enables Effective Content Isolation; Opens Door to Scientific Discoveries\nFREMONT, Calif., Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cytek Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTKB) has introduced an Enhanced Small Particle (ESP™) Detection Option for its Cytek Aurora™ CS system . This is the first commercially available small particle detector on a cell sorter and offers a significant advancement for rapidly evolving research fields, including in drug delivery, cell therapy, disease diagnostics, circulating tumor cells, regenerative medicine, and vaccine delivery. Researchers can now achieve downstream analysis of materials that were previously unable to be sorted, opening new possibilities for breakthroughs in these areas.\nOnce regarded as cellular debris, exosomes and extracellular vesicles (EVs) are now recognized as pivotal to cell-to-cell communication, disease progression, and therapeutic delivery. With the surge in research interest driven by technological innovations, EVs have become central to a growing body of scientific publications and clinical trials. With Cytek's ESP Detection Option, particles as small as 70 nm can now be studied and sorted for downstream analysis, giving researchers the ability to characterize the full emission spectra of small particles.\n\"As the first company to offer the ESP Detection Option on a cell sorter, we are setting a new standard for small particle research,” said Ming Yan, Ph.D., CTO of Cytek Biosciences. \"The enhanced capabilities of our Cytek Aurora CS system not only push the boundaries of scientific discovery but also may open up new markets for Cytek. Researchers can now explore areas previously beyond their reach, accelerating both scientific progress and potential commercial opportunities.”",
