    "text": "Society WATCH: For Protesting Rickey Williams, the husband of pro-life activist Bevelyn Beatty Williams, posted a chilling and heartbreaking video statement before his wife surrendered to federal prison. Williams was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in federal prison for peacefully protesting outside a New York City abortion clinic. Williams is one of several peaceful protesters who has been sentenced to multiple years in federal prison for violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act. The Biden Department of Justice has been aggressively pursuing FACE Act cases against pro-life protesters, resulting in multiple federal prison sentences. (FOCUS GROUP: Do You Blame KAMALA or TRUMP for record inflation?) In one instance, 75-year-old Paulette Harlow was sentenced to 24 months in prison for protesting inside a D.C. abortion clinic. When her husband asked the court for probation due to his wife’s advanced age — stating that she may die in prison — U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said, “maybe you should make an effort to remain alive because that is a tenet of your religion.” Last week, Williams uploaded a chilling video to her TikTok account before serving a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence for protesting outside a building. “So right now, I’m about to drive my wife to a federal facility. She has to surrender herself there. And this is due to the Harris-Biden administration,” Rickey began. “And any husband in this country, anyone that’s married, knows, any mother, any father, knows from your loved one, separation from a mother and a daughter at two years old is traumatic and no person, no American citizen should have to experience this in this country.” He then took aim at the Democratic Party’s rhetoric on criminal justice reform, namely former President Barack Obama. “When Kamala Harris’ administration is separating me from my wife and my wife from her daughter at two years old for unlawful assembly. My wife is facing three and a half years for unlawful assembly and federal time y’all, okay? Federal time,” Williams continued. “And it’s devastating for our family, but we’re going to get through this. But I want people to know in this country, mothers, fathers, single fathers, single mothers, that this cannot be tolerated and you should not vote for Kamala, because voting for Kamala will do things like this. Alright? It’s unacceptable.” Williams, a Tennessee native, was sentenced to a lengthy federal prison term for preaching the gospel outside an NYC abortion clinic. Federal prosecutors further accused her of injuring a clinic employee’s hand and blocking the entrance. “I was persecuted as a Christian standing for my beliefs when it comes to life,” reads a statement from Williams on her fundraising page. “This is devastating news. Not only is this bond extensive for the accused crime, but she made it very clear in the courtroom that she was going to make an example out of me.” (CHAOS: Costco Sells Out Of Gold Bars As Economic Uncertainty Grips Markets)",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "Japanese gas distributor Shizuoka Gas has ventured into India's biogas sector, buying a stake in Indian manure-based producer Farm Gas. Shizuoka Gas has bought 10pc of Farm Gas, a joint venture between Indian gas distributor IRM Energy and Indian consultant Eximius Resources, for an undisclosed sum. Shizuoka Gas previously bought a stake in [Gujarat-based IRM Energy in 2021](https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2284845), which supplies natural gas to the industrial sector. Farm Gas has been operating a biogas plant using cow dung and rice straw since December 2022. The manure-derived biogas is sold to auto firms as a vehicle fuel. The organic fertilizer produced as a by-product during the production process is sold to fertilizer companies and nearby farmers. Cow dung and rice straw creates air pollution, which is a huge problem in India, Shizuoka Gas said. It said it will build its experience in biogas production from the Farm Gas acquisition, with an aim to develop biogas plants in India and southeast Asia in the future. But shipping the biogas to Japan is not a current option, as Japan has already established pipeline gas supplies, it added.

April-June sales gas production of 20.2PJ (539mn m³) was 10pc higher than the previous quarter's 18.3PJ and up on April-June 2023's 19.6PJ as it commissioned its Enterprise field in Victoria state's Otway basin. Beach's total 2023-24 production of 18.5mn bl of oil equivalent (boe) was 5pc down on the 19.5mn boe achieved in 2022-23, with natural field decline and rainfall resulting in Beach's oil output falling by 11pc from the previous quarter to 7,400 b/d from 8,300 b/d in January-March. The firm shipped a second 79,000t Waitsia cargo from the Woodside-operated 16.9mn t/yr North West Shelf LNG terminal during the quarter, consisting of Xyris gas plant production and third-party surplus gas sourced through swaps. It expects to achieve the first gas at its delayed 250 TJ/d (6.7mn m³/d) Waitsia gas plant in Western Australia's onshore Perth basin in early 2025 ahead of a 3-4 month ramp-up period. The firm has released a wider than usual production guidance for 2024-25 of 17.5mn-21.5mn boe, to account for uncertainty on the timing of Waitsia commissioning and output growth. Beach identified A$135mn ($90.5mn) in field operating cost savings and sustaining capital expenditure reductions as part of its strategic review findings released on 18 June. Beach confirmed it expects to recognise an A$365mn-400mn pre-tax impairment charge in its full-year results following reassessment of its Bass basin assets in Australia and Taranaki basin project in New Zealand. It is targeting new gas supplies of 150 TJ/d over the coming 12-18 months from the Enterprise, Thylacine West and Waitsia fields.

US gas producers may struggle to meet LNG demand US gas producers may struggle to meet LNG demand New York, 18 July (Argus) — US natural gas producers looking to become the primary suppliers to increasingly dependent overseas markets may still need to overcome tight pipeline capacity, volatility in oil markets and even growing competition from the US power sector. Large producers such as EQT and Chesapeake Energy are banking that the rapid buildout of LNG export capacity will connect the US to higher-priced markets and provide an outlet for a glut of US supply. At the same time, European buyers are depending on US gas to help wean the continent off Russian supplies since the Russia-Ukraine war broke out in 2022. But questions remain about the ability of US producers to feed the rapid expansion. The US already leads the world in LNG exports and is on pace to double that capacity later this decade. US baseload LNG export capacity was forecast to increase to 21.1 Bcf/d by the end of 2027, about one fifth of today's total lower-48 US gas production, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). By 2030, Shell expects US LNG production will meet about 5pc of global gas demand and 30pc of global LNG demand. But to satisfy a world that much more reliant on US shipments of gas, US producers have to significantly grow output and build the pipelines needed to connect subterranean shale basins to the US Gulf coast, where almost all the US liquefaction capacity will be located. East Daley Analytics director Jack Weixel said regulatory challenges to permitting those pipelines threaten the US' ability to rapidly boost its LNG exports regardless of who is elected president in November. Growing pains There are unique challenges to raising production in all three of the US' biggest gas-producing formations — the Appalachian basins, the Permian basin of west Texas and southeast New Mexico, and the Haynesville shale of east Texas and northern Louisiana. In Appalachia, developers have almost entirely lost faith in their ability to secure the permits necessary to build new interstate pipelines, so incremental LNG demand will probably not be met by Appalachian gas. The Permian is the US' most prolific oil field, making it an unreliable associated gas producer; a dim outlook for crude prices would mechanically slash gas output. And in the less mature Haynesville, there are \"a lot of open questions on how deep that inventory is and how much (it) can actually grow,\" Citi equity analyst Paul Diamond said. The threat to building new pipelines is not solely the domain of regulators, either, but can even come from within the industry itself, as US midstream giant Energy Transfer has shown over the past year by trying to block several new pipelines out of the Haynesville. Some of Energy Transfer's opponents have warned the legal dispute could hamper the gas production growth needed in the Haynesville to meet the US' coming LNG boom. Permitting aside, some analysts consulted by Argus expressed concern about the integrity of the US gas pipeline network itself, whether due to accidents or ransomware attacks, such as that which targeted the Colonial oil products pipeline in May 2021, disrupting fuel deliveries into the eastern US. Powerful competition Meeting booming LNG demand could be even harder if domestic gas needs exceed expectations. Gas producers and power generators eager to serve data centers running emergent artificial intelligence software have indicated that might be the case. EQT, the largest US gas producer by volume, in its most aggressive data center build-out scenario envisioned an 18 Bcf/d (510mn m³/d) increase in gas demand to generate electricity through 2030, while US gas pipeline operator Kinder Morgan forecast an increase between 7-10 Bcf/d. Goldman Sachs and consultancy Enverus forecast more modest increases of 3.3 Bcf/d and 2 Bcf/d, respectively. The US power sector consumed a record-high 35.4 Bcf/d of gas in 2023, the EIA said. About 43pc of US utility-scale electricity was generated by gas. EQT may be biased. But if its forecast is accurate, US gas producers may not be able to meet all that new demand while also exporting double what the US is exporting today, FactSet analyst Connor McLean said. In that case, a high-demand scenario like EQT's could leave the US gas market undersupplied, boosting US gas prices and closing the spot price arbitrage between US pipeline gas and global LNG, which has mostly been wide open for years. In response to elevated prices at the US gas benchmark, Henry Hub, overseas buyers might find themselves canceling US cargoes — if their supply contracts allow for it — eating the requisite liquefaction fee and taking delivery of a cargo from Qatar or Russia instead. Not so fast The caveat to risks of an undersupplied US gas market is that official timelines of when LNG export terminals are expected to enter service on the US Gulf coast may be overly optimistic. Texas' planned 18.1mn t/yr Golden Pass LNG delaying first LNG on the heels of its lead contractor going bankrupt is just one recent example of this. \"All that does is give producers a little bit more time to get production to where it needs to be,\" Weixel said.

Urgent action needed for UK to hit net zero goals: CCC Urgent action needed for UK to hit net zero goals: CCC London, 18 July (Argus) — The UK increased the rate at which it reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions last year, but \"urgent action\" is needed for the country to meet its targets in 2030 and beyond, independent advisory body Climate Change Committee (CCC) said in its progress report published today. The report assesses the UK's progress towards its net zero goals against policy set out by the previous Conservative government. The new Labour government, which has been in power since 5 July, has already set the scene for a stronger decarbonisation agenda , but it \"will have to act fast to hit the country's commitments\", the report says. The committee tracked progress on 28 key indicators. Of the 22 that have a benchmark or target, only five are assessed as being \"on track\". The UK's GHG emissions last year stood at 393mn t/CO2 equivalent (CO2e), down on the year by 5.4pc, or 22mn t/CO2e, provisional data show. This estimate excludes contributions from international aviation and shipping, as these are not included in the UK's 2030 target of a 68pc cut in GHG emissions from a 1990 baseline. And last year's reduced emissions resulted primarily from a drop in gas demand, the CCC says. Combined gas demand in 2023 averaged 156mn m³/d, down from nearly 175mn m³/d a year earlier. While progress has been made, the previous administration \"signalled a slowing of pace and reversed or delayed key policies\", the report says. The reduction in emissions last year is \"roughly in line with the annual pace of change needed\" to reach the 2030 target, but the average annual rate over the previous seven years is \"insufficient\", the committee says. The new government has placed strong focus on decarbonising electricity in its first days in office, but this is \"not enough on its own\", CCC acting chief executive James Richardson said. The average annual rate of GHG reduction outside the electricity supply sector over the previous seven years was 6.3mn t/CO2e, but this will need to more than double until 2030 if the UK is to meet its targets, the CCC says. In order to reach targets, \"annual offshore wind installations must increase by at least three times, onshore wind installations will need to double and solar installations must increase by five times\" by 2030. By comparison, oil and gas use should be \"rapidly\" reduced and the expansion of the production of fossil fuels should be limited, according to the report. The CCC also recommended that about 10pc of UK homes will need to be heated by a heat pump by 2030, in comparison with about 1pc today. The committee criticised the exemption of 20pc of properties from the 2035 phase-out gas boiler plan, saying it is \"unclear\" how the exemption would reduce costs as fewer consumers would have to pay to maintain the distribution grid. Gas-fired power generation in recent months has dropped on the back of high wind output and brisk power imports. Power-sector gas burn was 25mn m³/d in March-June, roughly half of the three-year average for the period. But if UK power demand increases with electrification, gas-fired power generation could maintain its role in the country's power mix, particularly if it is combined with carbon capture, use and storage technology, for which fast development and scale-up will need to happen this decade, the CCC says. \"Biases\" towards the use of natural gas or hydrogen must be removed where electrification is the most economical decarbonisation solution in an industry sector. Power prices need to be reduced \"to a level that incentivises industrial electrification\". Oil, gas industry to meet climate goals The UK's oil and gas sector \"is on track to meet its own climate goals and is not slowing down\", offshore industries association OEUK said today in reaction to the CCC's report. The UK needs a plan for reducing oil and gas demand and cutting its reliance on imports, according to OEUK chief executive David Whitehouse. \"We should be prioritising our homegrown energy production,\" he said. The sector reduced its emissions by 24pc in 2022 from 2018, meaning it met its target to reduce emissions by 10pc by 2025 early. The industry halved its flaring and venting and cut methane emissions by 45pc in 2022 compared with 2018, Whitehouse said. OEUK plans to reduce emissions by a quarter by 2027 and by half by 2030 against 2018 levels. And it aims to achieve net zero by 2050.

EU’s von der Leyen re-elected as Commission president EU’s von der Leyen re-elected as Commission president Brussels, 18 July (Argus) — The European Parliament today approved Ursula von der Leyen's re-election as president of the European Commission. Nominated by EU states in June, von der Leyen received 401 votes, by secret ballot, from parliament's 720 newly elected members. Von der Leyen called for continuing climate and energy policy in her 2024-29 mandate to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) cuts of at least 90pc by 2040 from 1990 levels. \"I have not forgotten how [Russian president Vladimir] Putin blackmailed us by cutting us off from Russian fossil fuels. We invested massively in homegrown cheap renewables. And this enabled us to break free from dirty Russian fossil fuels,\" said von der Leyen, promising to end the \"era of dependency on Russian fossil fuels\". She did not give an end date for this, nor did she specify if this includes a commitment to end Russian LNG imports. Von der Leyen went on to detail political guidelines for 2024-29. In the first 100 days of her new mandate, she pledged to propose a \"clean industrial deal\", albeit without giving concrete figures about how much investment this would channel to infrastructure and industry, particularly for energy-intensive sectors. The clean industrial deal will help bring down energy bills, she said. Von der Leyen told parliament the commission would propose legislation, under the European Climate Law, establishing a 90pc emission-reduction target for 2040. Her political guidelines also call for scaling up and prioritising clean-tech investment, including in grid infrastructure, storage capacity, transport infrastructure for captured CO2, energy efficiency, power digitalization, and deployment of a hydrogen network. She will also extend aggregate demand mechanisms beyond gas to include hydrogen and critical raw materials. Her political guidelines note the dangers of dependencies or fraying supply chains, from Putin's \"energy blackmail\" or China's monopoly on battery and chip raw materials. Majority report Passing the necessary legislation to implement her stated policies will now require approval from EU states and from parliament. Unless amplified by Germany's election next year, election victories by far-right parties in France and elsewhere appear not to threaten EU state majorities for specific legislation. Parliament's political centre-left S&D and liberal Renew groups, as well as von der Leyen's own centre-right EPP, have elaborated key policy requests . These broadly call for the continuation of von der Leyen's Green Deal, the set of legislation and policy measures aimed at 55pc GHG emission reduction by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. A symbolic issue for von der Leyen to decide, or compromise on, is the internal combustion engine (ICE). Her EPP group wants to stick to technological neutrality and to revise the phase-out, by 2035, of new ICE cars if they cannot run exclusively on carbon-neutral fuels. The EPP wants an EU e-fuel, biofuel, and low-carbon fuel strategy. Von der Leyen's guidelines reflect the need to gain support from centre-right, centre-left, and greens. For the ICE phase-out, she said the 2035 climate neutrality target for new cars creates investor and manufacturer \"predictability\" but requires a \"technology-neutral approach, in which e-fuels have a role to play.\" She made no mention of carbon-neutral biofuels. It will be impossible for von der Leyen to satisfy all demands in her second mandate. That includes policy asks put forward by the EPP, ranging from a \"pragmatic\" definition of low-carbon hydrogen, market rules for carbon capture and storage, postponing the EU's deforestation regulation, to catering more for farmers, even by scrapping EU wildlife protection for wolves and bears. EU member states are expected to propose their candidates for commissioners in August, including those responsible for energy, climate, and trade policies. When parliament has held hearings for candidates in late October, von der Leyen's new commission would then be subject to a final vote.

Australia’s Santos delays FID on Dorado oil field Australia’s Santos delays FID on Dorado oil field Sydney, 18 July (Argus) — Australian independent Santos will now target a 2025 final investment decision (FID) on its 80pc-owned Dorado oil project in Western Australia (WA), after deferring it in 2022 and last year indicating a 2024 decision. Dorado's 10pc stakeholder Australian independent Carnarvon Energy said the joint venture (JV) will evaluate a lower capital expenditure (capex) option by reducing capacity below the previously guided 75,000-100,000 b/d and phasing development wells, targeting front-end engineering and design re-entry later in 2024 \"once the JV secures the best option vessel or hull\". Carnarvon said overall capex prior to the first oil from the offshore field will now be below its previous guidance of $2bn. Dorado JV's other shareholder is Taiwan's state-owned CPC with 10pc. Santos reported higher April-June oil and gas output than the previous quarter on 18 July, with production from the 7.8mn t/yr Gladstone LNG (GLNG) in Queensland state up on a year earlier. It produced 22.2mn bl of oil equivalent (boe), up by 2pc from 21.8mn boe during January-March because of the return of WA's Devil Creek gas plant following a maintenance shutdown, as well as higher liquids production following cyclone-related disconnections during January-March. But output was 3pc below the year-earlier figure of 22.8mn boe. GLNG is on track to swap 18PJ (480mn m³) of gas into the domestic market over April-September 2024, Santos said, with the project maintaining its guidance of around 6mn t of LNG shipped for the year to 31 December. Production at the 6.9mn t/yr ExxonMobil-operated PNG LNG in Papua New Guinea (PNG) was down on January-March with natural decline at the Hides field, partially offset by high compression reliability from the Santos-operated Gobe and Kutubu fields. Finalisation of drilling and completion of operations activities at PNG LNG's Angore C1 and C2 wells has been achieved with both wells perforated for production. Angore project teams are now starting tie-in execution with production of 350mn ft³/d (10mn m³/d) expected during October-December. The $4.6bn Barossa backfill project in the Timor Sea is 77pc complete, Santos said, with pipeline testing completed in June and on track for its first gas in July-September 2025 within its cost guidance. Santos' 1.7mn t/yr Moomba carbon capture and storage project in South Australia is mechanically complete and on track to raise injection of Cooper basin gas plant carbon dioxide during July-December. Santos maintained its 2024 production guidance of 84mn-90mn boe and will release its half-year results on 21 August.

    "text": "But the 31-year-old is now one among hundreds of Ukrainian women who have taken on new roles below the surface of the war-battered country as its men fight off Russian forces on the front.\n“Of course it’s hard. The air isn’t like in the mountains, is it?” Karkachova told AFP in a mine 400 metres beneath the Dnipropetrovsk region in eastern Ukraine.\n“But because there’s a shortage of guys and we have this situation in Ukraine, we have to help in some way,” she added.\nUkraine introduced historic changes to its labour laws just weeks after Russia invaded to allow women to take on work previously restricted to men.\nThey point to sweeping social shifts in the country brought on by the war, which has seen tens of thousands of women join the armed forces and take on jobs that used to be limited to men, as Kyiv strives to keep its struggling economy afloat.\nKarkachova fled to Dnipropetrovsk from the eastern mining region of Lugansk, now occupied by Russia, and her ex-husband is among those fighting on the front.\nThe move with her children from one industrial territory to another felt natural and the prospect of working in a mine didn’t feel entirely alien.\n‘It was an oddity’\n“And so, I went to try to work. In life you have to try everything. I like it.”\nDTEK, the Ukrainian energy company that operates the facility where Karkachova has been working for one year requested its location be withheld for security reasons.\nInna Kobozeva, head of human resources at the mine told AFP that out of a total of around 2,800 employees, some 600 were now fighting on the front.\nShe noted that more than two dozen staff have been killed in fighting with Russian forces since 2014, when Kremlin-backed separatists seized swathes of eastern Ukraine.\nAt least 183 women since the war have begun working underground at this particularly facility.\nThey are among around 500 in a broader group of DTEK mining facilities in the region, making up around 15 percent of staff, a press officer said.\nBut not everyone welcomed women underground — particularly the men — when they took on the roles.\n“At first, they were pessimistic. They couldn’t even believe it. But then they changed their minds,” said Kobozeva, the HR chief.\n“It was an oddity,” said Dmitry, a 33-year-old operator of the mine’s underground transport network.\n‘Indispensable’ work\nBut when one of his colleagues who was deployed to the front was replaced by one of the new female recruits, his scepticism fell away.\n“She works no worse than the boys. There’s a lot of boys missing. Yeah. Their help is indispensable,” he said.\nEven before the war, Ukraine’s economy ministry said there were workforce shortages, a problem exacerbated by the flight of some six million Ukrainians from the country due to the conflict.\nAdding to that, the military has said it hopes to mobilise some 500,000 men to reclaim territory captured by Russia.\n“We haven’t stopped recruitment. I wouldn’t say the situation is critical but we do have a staff shortage,” Kobozeva said.\nSeveral of the women interviewed by AFP expressed hope that men fighting on the front would return after the war and take up their old jobs again.\n“We went to work to help our husbands. They’ll come back and return to their places,” said Tetiana Tarasova, a 36-year-old machine operator whose partner is fighting in the Donetsk region.\nVictoria, 33, who also works in the mine’s underground transport network, said it was important for women to help at a time of national crisis but ultimately the subterranean work is “a man’s job”.\n“I understand that our women are strong and can handle anything,” she said, but it was the circumstances of the war that had pushed her to take on the work underground.\n“I probably wouldn’t have agreed to do it if the moment hadn’t forced me to”.\nafptv-bur-jbr/jc/yad\nThe post\nWith men on the front, women descend Ukraine’s mines appeared first on France 24.",

    "text": "Srinagar- Jammu and Kashmir’s Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha Thursday chaired a crucial Unified Headquarters (UHQ) meeting in Srinagar to devise a fresh strategy to combat fresh threats, especially attacks on the vital infrastructure projects and non-J&K workforce. The LG directed the security grid of J&K to go all out against the terrorism and its ecosystem in the UT so that peace remains intact.\nSources said that the heads of all security agencies were seen in a huddle at Rajbhawan this morning as LG chaired a crucial UHQ meeting. Among those who attended the meeting were Director General of Police J&K Nalin Prabhat, Northern Army Commander M V Suchindera Kumar, GoC of Srinagar based 15 Corps Lt General Prashant Srivastava, ADGP J&K Vijay Kumar, ADGP Jammu Anand Jain, IGP Kashmir V K Bhirdi, IG BSF, IGs of CRF and the Director Intelligence Bureau. From the administration Chief Secretary Atal Duloo and Principal Secretary Home also participated in the meeting.\nLG took serious note of the recent attack at Gagangeer, Ganderbal and sought feedback from the heads of security agencies as to how terrorists managed to reach the spot. “He called for a collective approach of security agencies to wipe out terrorism and its eco-system from J&K soil. The LG laid special emphasis on uprooting the terror network in Kashmir and directed the heads of security agencies to go tough on the terror sympathisers and Over Ground Workers (OGWs),” sources said.\nThe LG sought details from the army officers including northern army commanders about the successful infiltration attempts this year so far and the number of “foreign terrorists active in both regions.” Sources said that the LG reiterated that innocents shouldn’t be touched and culprits including terrorists shouldn’t be spared.\n“The LG asked the security officials to track down those involved in the Gagangeer attack and punish them sternly,” the source said, adding that he also called for the highest level of vigil on the LoC and International Border (IB) to prevent possible infiltration bids ahead of snowfall.\nThe LG also directed the security grid to deal effectively with the challenge of narco-terror and act swiftly against those involved in drug trade. Today’s meeting came after two back-to-back security reviews taken by LG post Gagangeer, Ganderbal attack. The LG also stressed on the need of thorough security audits of all vital Infrastructure projects and security installations across the UT. The LG sources said, also asked the security heads to ensure solid security cover for non J&K workers working at various projects across J&K. “Enhancement of security at important developmental projects was also discussed and steps to be taken were fine tuned as well,” he said. Present in the meeting, the heads of various security agencies vowed to maintain close synergy and coordination while dealing with the fresh challenges on terrorism front.",

    "text": "Pope Francis visited Rome's Rebibbia prison on Holy Thursday, where he washed and kissed the feet of 12 women inmates. The traditional ritual commemorates Jesus' act of humility toward his apostles during the Last Supper before his crucifixion. The female section of the prison, housing around 370 inmates, witnessed this unique ceremony. The foot-washing tradition marks the commencement of a spiritually charged four-day journey towards Easter. Pope Francis is the first pope to conduct a foot-washing ceremony outside churches, often in prisons, homes for the elderly, or hospices. His practice of including women, atheists, Muslims, and other non-Christians in the service sets him apart from his predecessors, who typically limited the ritual to men, usually priests. In his improvised homily, Pope Francis underscored the theme of service to others. He reminded the inmates that each of them has their own story, and the Lord listens with open arms, never tiring of forgiveness. He said, \"Each of you has their own story but the Lord listens to us with open arms and never tires of forgiving.” The women cried. They felt touched by his kindness. Despite his recent health challenges, Pope Francis appeared energised during the visit. The prison director, Nadia Fontana, described his presence as a ray of sunlight, and the inmates offered him items, including liturgical stoles embroidered by them.

    "text": "A gratuidade da universidade pública e a facilidade no ingresso foram nos últimos anos grandes atrativos para os alunos brasileiros atualizado Compartilhar notícia Google News - Metrópoles Cortes na educação argentina, aumento de exigências e proposta para extinguir gratuidade a alunos estrangeiros em universidades públicas provocam incerteza sobre destino de milhares de brasileiros que estudam no país. Nos últimos anos, tradições universitárias do Brasil, como atléticas e cervejadas, se expandiram pela Argentina na mesma velocidade que o número de estudantes brasileiros, a grande maioria buscando um diploma de medicina. A gratuidade da universidade pública e a facilidade no ingresso foram nos últimos anos grandes atrativos para os alunos brasileiros, mas a solução que muitos encontraram para obter o diploma entrou na mira do governo do presidente ultraliberal Javier Milei neste ano. Em meio aos planos de cortes de gastos, as verbas para as universidades são alvo de polêmicas e disputas. No começo do mês, Milei vetou uma lei para o financiamento universitário, provocando manifestações e uma série de paralisações nas instituições de ensino. O projeto, que havia sido aprovado pelo Congresso, previa mais verbas para a educação e aumento de salários de docentes. Setores universitários alegam que o corte de gastos impede o pleno funcionamento das instituições. A postura contou com forte rejeição popular e política, já que as universidades públicas, de onde saíram cinco vencedores do prêmio Nobel, são vistas como um orgulho nacional. Segundo pesquisa da consultoria Zuban Córdoba y Asociados, 59,3% dos entrevistados questionaram o veto de Milei à lei que promovia a ampliação do orçamento universitário. Neste cenário, a proposta de cobrar de alunos estrangeiros para aumentar a arrecadação das instituições vem sendo defendida por alguns setores. “Aqueles que vêm de outras partes para estudar em nosso país são pessoas que não pagaram um único imposto aqui durante toda a vida. Apoiamos a educação, a saúde, a segurança e a justiça, me parece razoável que quem utiliza estes serviços e não contribuiu, pague alguma coisa”, declarou o presidente da Câmara dos Deputados da Argentina, Martín Menem, sobre o tema. No centro da polêmica, está a Medicina. Atualmente, cerca de 34% dos estudantes no curso no país são estrangeiros, um número próximo de 37 mil pessoas, com mais de 20 mil brasileiros. Normalmente, para um brasileiro estudar em uma universidade pública na Argentina a única exigência além dos trâmites burocráticos para se fixar no país é a comprovação de um conhecimento de espanhol, o que estimulou muitos alunos nos últimos anos. Além de não exigir um disputado vestibular para ingresso nas universidades públicas como no Brasil, há a possibilidade de economizar diante de mensalidades que chegam aos milhares de reais nas instituições privadas do país. Diploma mais caro e mais difícil Por sua vez, em 2024, o cenário favorável vem sofrendo algumas alterações. Ao longo do ano, dezenas de brasileiros foram barrados ao tentar entrar na Argentina por conta de alterações nas exigências de visto. Até então, era comum que o procedimento de estudantes solicitarem o visto de permanência e a residência fixa fosse feito após o ingresso no território argentino. Já neste ano, ao seguir o mesmo trâmite, alguns dos que tentaram entrar no país vizinho ainda sem tal documentação foram tratados como “falsos turistas” e mandados de volta ao Brasil. Além disso, a alta no custo de vida, com destaque para avanço no preço dos aluguéis, vem representeando uma dificuldade extra. Nos últimos anos, apesar da inflação argentina galopante, o real teve forte valorização ante o peso argentino, o que manteve o país atrativo para muitos brasileiros. No entanto, nos últimos meses a moeda local se estabilizou, tornando as despesas mais caras em reais. “Vi muitos colegas voltando ao Brasil, ainda que estivesse indo bem na universidade, porque não conseguiram custear a vida aqui na Argentina”, afirma Dhéo Carvalho, estudante brasileiro do quinto período da Universidade de Buenos Aires (UBA). Na sua visão, “com certeza” a aplicação de cobranças a estrangeiros reduziria ainda mais o fluxo de brasileiros estudando na Argentina. “Além de brasileiros, sou colega de pessoas da Colômbia, Equador, Chile, Bolívia e outras nacionalidades da região. Todos eles mostram preocupação caso essa política chegue a ser implementada”, afirma. O dia a dia nas universidades já vem sendo afetado diante do quadro de incertezas pelo financiamento. “Só no último mês tive três provas que tiveram de mudar de data por greve. Tive três aulas canceladas e duas ao ar livre”, uma forma comum de protesto na Argentina, conta Carvalho. “Parasitas do Estado” Muitos estudantes de outros países relatam que comentários negativos sobre sua frequência nas universidades, e aqueles que os culpam pelos problemas econômicos do país, avançaram nos últimos tempos. “Não é difícil escutar que somos parasitas do Estado ou que estamos nos aproveitando das condições do país”, afirma Carvalho. Há poucas certezas sobre o real impacto da eventual cobrança de estrangeiros, e de que forma se daria sua aplicação. Atualmente, 4,4% dos estudantes universitários argentinos são estrangeiros. No caso da proposta atual mais avançada do governo, aqueles sem residência permanente no país seriam afetados. “Na Argentina, para estudar é necessário ter residência, ou seja, são pessoas do exterior que conseguiram concluir o processo”, aponta Juan Manuel Álvarez Echagüe, professor de Finanças Públicas e Direito Tributário da Faculdade de Direito da UBA. Ele lembra ainda que não há nenhum estudo até o momento que indique qual seria o real impacto econômico na arrecadação de impostos da cobrança de universidades públicas. Por outro lado, ele não descarta que em um “país onde hoje prevalece um discurso xenófobo” possa avançar a cobrança das mensalidades para aqueles que não nasceram na Argentina. “Legalmente poderia ser viável, embora fosse contra uma longa tradição”, avalia. Falta de retorno? Outra questão que ganhou força recentemente foi o questionamento do número de estrangeiros que voltam a seus países depois de concluir o curso de Medicina, o que não geraria contribuição à Argentina. Muitos brasileiros apontam que há interesse em continuar no país após a graduação, mas indicam que os baixos salários comparativos para a função são um impeditivo. Um levantamento da consultoria Javier Miglino y Asociados mostrou que, na média, um médico no Brasil recebe anualmente US$ 47.000, ante US$ 5.280 da Argentina, valor que fica abaixo até de países como Bangladesh, com US$ 7.084. O brasileiro Alberto Solé chegou à Argentina em 2008, onde cursou Medicina em uma universidade privada. Atualmente, ele atua como médico especialista no país, mas indica que foi uma exceção em seu curso. “Éramos 97 brasileiros, destes, dez se formaram aqui, dos quais sou o único que continuou na Argentina. A grande maioria voltou logo depois” para o Brasil, conta. Segundo ele, os comentários questionando a contribuição dos estrangeiros ao país são mais recentes. “Quem conheço que fez a faculdade pública, nunca teve este problema. Na verdade, era visto como uma forma de ascensão social”, incluindo para as segundas gerações de imigrantes, aponta. Uma ideia ventilada é a de que estrangeiros possam ser obrigados a trabalhar no país por algum período para retribuir a formação. Álvarez questiona o projeto: “Não vejo como viável reter, sem o seu consentimento, alguém no nosso país, mesmo que o fizesse assinar um compromisso prévio, não estaria de acordo com a lei”. “É verdade que muitos saem do país após se formarem, mas, para obtê-lo, tiveram que fazer consultas médicas com assistência gratuita aos pacientes argentinos”, conclui.
