    "text": "Mexican farmers who killed 10 cartel members with sickles and shotguns ‘acted in self-defence’ A group of Mexican farmers have been allowed to walk free despite killing 10 members of [a cartel](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/12/18/mexican-drug-cartel-hands-out-branded-gifts-to-children/) with sickles and shotguns in a “football field massacre”. The villagers engaged in a showdown with the gangsters earlier this month after they refused to pay them protection money. Armed with sickles, machetes and shotguns, the villagers killed 10 members of the notorious [Familia Michoacana](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/mexico/5900976/Mexico-drug-cartel-with-its-own-bible.html) cartel at a football field in Texcapilla on Dec 8, and lost four of their own. Despite the showdown being dubbed by locals as “the massacre on the football field”, prosecutors from the state of Mexico concluded that cartel members had opened fire first and that the farmers had acted in self-defence with “the tools of their trade”. ‘Under constant threat’ Prosecutors said that the rural community of Texcapilla had been “under constant threat” from the Familia Michoacana cartel, which extorted money from farmers by charging them protection fees according to the size of the land they planted. After a poor harvest this year, the farmers met with cartel representatives the day before the showdown to negotiate a lower fee. However, they were unsuccessful and decided to band together and reiterate their demands at the football pitch. As well as the 14 dead, seven people were injured in the battle. Among those killed was the local leader of the Michoacana cartel, who went by the name “el Payaso”, or the Clown. Cartel exacts its revenge Local authorities fear that the cartel has already exacted revenge for the defeat, with 14 villagers having disappeared in the days after the battle, including four children. Delfina Gómez, the governor of [Mexico](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/mexico/) state, told Texcapilla residents that officials would not abandon them: “I tell you, you are not alone; we are with you.” But the [threat of violence from criminal gangs](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/07/08/mexicos-cartel-violence-reaches-bloody-nadir-hugs-not-bullets/) has led some Mexicans to seek protection by hiring private security forces. For example, also in the state of Mexico, chicken merchants from the city of Toluca have hired [vigilantes](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2021/08/16/vigilante-groups-stand-alone-fight-against-mexican-drug-lords/) to protect them from reprisals after they stopped paying extortion fees to criminal gangs. Last week four Toluca chicken traders were kidnapped in their warehouse and driven away in vans by armed men. [Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "text": "團隊管理\n撰文 莊彙翌\n過度控制也是一種霸凌！主管如果出現這 6 種行為就「踩線」了\n「你下午在做什麼？不要以為我不知道你在摸魚！」小豪今天遠端辦公，接近傍晚時經理的訊息突然映入眼簾，試圖打破沙鍋問到底：「報告交了沒？如果沒準時交，我就在公司社群公告！」\n你也有過被監控的感覺嗎？新冠疫情過後，遠端或混合辦公的工作模式逐漸融入工作者的日常，通常公司會嘗試建立新的管理模式和溝通機制，但有些機制可能會有過度監控的爭議，比如要求下載軟體以追蹤員工電腦，甚至設下「工作時間視訊、打開鏡頭」等規定，讓員工感到隱私被侵犯。\n這種對員工每個細節的過度監控，就是「微管理」（micromanagement）。\n事事控管、放大錯誤，會讓員工不清楚自身價值\n《富比士》（Forbes）的文章〈Is Micromanaging A Form Of Bullying? Here Are 3 Things You Should Know〉指出，微管理本質上是想控制他人的一種行為，因此員工會感到被剝奪權利，心理健康也有可能會惡化。\n微管理的背後，是缺乏信任引發的過度控制，主管開始介入隱私、侵犯個人界線，就容易形成有毒的工作環境。當員工開始覺得權利被剝奪，甚至受到羞辱、冒犯，就可能構成職場霸凌。\n《哈佛商業評論》2020年針對24個國家、約1200名員工做線上微管理調查，超過2成的人表示，主管會在遠端評價他們的工作成果，有1成會被主管密切聯繫來監控任務，比如每半小時問一次進度。\n整體來說，前述《富比士》的文章提到，有將近8成工作者曾被微管理過，7成的人表示這干擾了他們的工作表現；文中認為，微管理者往往會吹毛求疵、放大同事的錯誤及弱點，而不是表揚員工的成就和努力，認為這樣就能提高員工生產力。\n微管理會讓員工們害怕在沒有上司批准的情況下做任何事，甚至覺得自己沒有能力，也不知道自己工作的價值在哪。就結果而言，無論是出自好意或惡意，其結果和職場霸凌導致的情況非常相似。\n不敢拒絕、不願製造衝突，等同將「決定權」交給他人\n職場上侵犯到他人界線的情況，不只是出現在微管理，舉凡同事在非工作時間內發送訊息、或是高層強迫參加工作以外的社交活動，都可能面臨「踩線」問題。\n《不生病的人際關係》指出，有時候對方會以「善意」為由，使你被迫犧牲自己的時間。例如，同事趕著下班去接小孩放學，希望你能在下班前幫忙解決某個任務，並說「做好這件事，或許可以在主管面前加分。」\n一開始，你可能會基於同事情感，而選擇協助；後來同事再度請求時，就會覺得自己只要忍耐一下下就沒事了，進而妥協。但是當你一回神，卻發現個人生活已經遭受嚴重侵犯，而對方也沒有要調整他的工作安排，甚至會開始要求更多；如果不以保護自己為優先，一味因為別人的事而消耗精力，就可能搞壞身體。\n書中提到，界線遭到侵犯的背後，來自於你的「決定權」遭到剝奪。\n一開始，也許是因為你不想製造衝突，但不敢或不願拒絕別人的同時，就是將決定權無條件交出去。因此，建議你可以從小事開始，將決定權拿回來，比如要聚餐，率先提出要吃什麼，營造自己是「做決定的人」的印象。\n除此之外，也可以製造「鯊魚之籠」（shark cage），試著稍微與對方起衝突（不需要決裂），製造人際關係的緊張和對立，讓對方知道你有底線、原則。\n比如跟對方反映：「今天和你討論工作就消耗了半天時間，我沒辦法做事」，或是遭到貶低時，發怒表示：「你這句話太超過了！」之後再冷靜地向對方道歉，修補關係；反覆使用，直到對方了解你的底線。",

    "text": "IT之家 4 月 3 日消息，谷歌旗下的人工智能笔记应用 NotebookLM 推出了一项令人眼前一亮的新功能 ——“发现资料”（Discover sources），这一功能的上线有望极大地提升学生和研究人员在资料收集方面的效率。\n以往，用户在使用 NotebookLM 时，需要手动添加 PDF 文件、谷歌文档或幻灯片、网站链接、YouTube 视频链接或粘贴文本等资料，才能使用该应用的诸如音频概览（Audio Overviews）和思维导图（Mind Maps）等功能。然而，如今情况发生了改变。\nIT之家注意到，谷歌通过其官方博客 The Keyword 宣布了这一新功能。借助 Gemini 技术的支持，NotebookLM 能够为用户自动搜索网络上的资料，从而节省用户手动查找资料的时间和精力。用户只需打开一个新笔记本或现有的笔记本，在资料面板中，除了传统的“添加资料”按钮外，现在还会看到一个“发现资料”按钮。\n点击该按钮后，会出现一个带有“您感兴趣的是什么？”提示的文本框。用户只需在文本框中描述自己想要查找的内容，越具体越好，然后点击提交按钮。NotebookLM 将在几秒钟内搜索数百个潜在的网络资源，对它们进行分析，并根据用户的话题筛选出最相关的资料。最终，它会整理出一份最多包含 10 个推荐资料的列表，并附上解释其相关性的摘要。用户可以勾选想要导入笔记本的资料，然后点击导入按钮。\n此外，用户还可以像往常一样在 NotebookLM 中使用这些资料，无论是生成音频概览、思维导图、常见问题解答（FAQs）、问答（Q&As）、快速摘要，还是提问等。对于那些想要随机学习新知识的用户，NotebookLM 还提供了一个“好奇心驱动”（I'm feeling curious）按钮，它可以随机生成一个主题的资料。\n谷歌在博客中提到，这只是 NotebookLM 利用 Gemini 收集相关资料功能系列中的第一个。这一新功能从即日起开始向所有 NotebookLM 用户推出，预计将在一周内全面上线。\n尽管有人可能会担心 NotebookLM 可能会出现信息“幻觉”（即生成不准确或虚假的信息），但目前来看，这一问题尚未出现。无论如何，这一新功能的推出无疑是 NotebookLM 在提升用户体验和功能实用性方面迈出的一大步，也让人们对其未来的发展充满期待。",

    "text": "Holiday nightmares are, sadly, a universal experience. BBC One ’s “Rip Off Britain” returns this Friday for its season finale, taking aim at the travel industry and offering advice to those whose vacations have gone disastrously wrong.\nPresenters Gloria Hunniford, Julia Somerville, and Louise Minchin investigate several cases of holidaymakers whose relaxing getaways were anything but. One couple booked a stay at what was advertised as a luxury resort, only to discover it was more of a building site. The team also investigates the plight of a family stranded in Barbados, abandoned, they claim, by both their airline and travel agent.\nIn another segment, “Rip Off Britain” follows the baffling story of a woman traveling to Turkey, only to end up stuck there without her partner, he was sent home due to a passport oversight. The team also looks at what travellers are entitled to when their holidays are disrupted, offering crucial advice for dealing with these frustrating situations. Tune in to BBC One on Friday, 2 May at 9:30 AM GMT for the season finale of “Rip Off Britain.”",

    "title": "Aurora borealis put on a show last night. Will we see the northern lights again tonight?",
    "text": "Aurora borealis put on a show last night. Will we see the northern lights again tonight? [The northern lights returned to Ohio on Thursday](https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/news/2024/10/10/northern-lights-forecast-tonight-visible-ohio-solar-storm-aurora-borealis/75602729007/), glowing in the skies overhead from Cleveland to Cincinnati. Will the aurora borealis return tonight? Here's a look at the forecast. Why were the northern lights visible Thursday night? According to the [Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/), a severe geomagnetic storm caused by plasma and magnetic fields erupting from the sun hit the Earth Thursday afternoon. [According to an update](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-geomagnetic-storm-levels-continue-be-observed) posted Thursday afternoon, the storm reached [an intensity of G4 on a scale of 5](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/noaa-scales-explanation), the SWPC observed, with the potential for it to strengthen to a G5. At G4 levels, the aurora has the potential to be seen as far south as Alabama, according to the SWPC. If it hit G5 levels, the northern lights might be seen across the United States and further south, [as happened during the May 10 geomagnetic storm](https://www.beaconjournal.com/picture-gallery/news/local/2024/05/11/see-photos-of-the-northern-lights-from-across-northeast-ohio/73657112007/). Can you see the northern lights in Ohio tonight? It seems unlikely that the aurora will return to Ohio tonight. [The latest alert from the SWPC](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/alerts-watches-and-warnings) calls for the aurora to be visible at high latitudes, such as Canada and Alaska. What time would the northern lights be visible tonight? If Ohio is lucky enough to see the northern lights again tonight, be prepared for a late night. During times of high geomagnetic activity, which pushes the northern lights further south, the aurora are visible directly overhead in the northern United States, [according to the prediction center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/content/tips-viewing-aurora). For the best viewing, the center recommends that it be very dark. Get away from city lights and avoid trying to see them on the night of a full moon. The best time to view the aurora is within an hour or two of midnight, or 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Aurora photos from across Ohio shared on social media Social media users captured stunning images of Thursday's aurora, and shared them with the world. Here's a sample: What causes the northern lights? Auroras are ribbons of light weaving across Earth's northern or southern polar regions, [according to NASA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/nmp/st5/SCIENCE/aurora.html). Magnetic storms that have been triggered by solar activity, such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections, cause them. The solar wind carries energetic charged particles from these events away from the sun. These energized particles hit the atmosphere at 45 million mph and are redirected to the poles by the earth's magnetic field, according to [Space.com](https://www.space.com/15139-northern-lights-auroras-earth-facts-sdcmp.html), creating the light show. During major geomagnetic storms, the auroras expand away from the poles and can be seen over some parts of the United States, according to the [NOAA](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/aurora). What is a coronal mass ejection? NASA [describes coronal mass ejections](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/nmp/st5/SCIENCE/cme.html) as \"huge bubbles of coronal plasma threaded by intense magnetic field lines that are ejected from the sun over the course of several hours.\" The [Akron Beacon Journal reports](https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/news/weather/2023/11/03/solar-storms-headed-for-earth/71441571007/) that the space agency says they often look like \"huge, twisted rope\" and can occur with solar flares, or explosions on the sun's surface. NOAA offers aurora dashboard If you're curious about the latest forecast for the aurora, the NOAA has a tool for that. The [Aurora Dashboard](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/aurora-dashboard-experimental) offers a visual, animated prediction of where the aurora might be seen in the next few minutes as well as the following day. Severe solar storm that caused northern lights could stress power grids already hurt by hurricanes In preparation for the solar storm, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notified the Federal Emergency Management Agency about possible power grid disruptions as FEMA copes with the aftermath of [Hurricane Helene](https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/graphics/2024/10/07/hurricane-helene-great-flood-asheville/75456390007/) and [Hurricane Milton](https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/10/hurricane-milton-live-updates-florida-aftermath-thursday/75599239007/), which just hit Florida, [NPR reports](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/10/g-s1-27384/solar-storm-power-grids-hurricanes). Florida is far enough south to avoid any power disruptions from the solar storm, Rob Steenburgh, a scientist with NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center, told NPR. However, NOAA space weather forecaster Shawn Dahl told NPR that experts are more concerned about how the geomagnetic storm will impact the power grid in areas recovering from Helene, which hit two weeks ago.",

    "text": "Maravilla Martínez-Rocky Balboa, la dupla de Racing que promete nocaut\nEl delantero que llegó de Unión es la gran apuesta de Costas en el mercado.\nUno viene de ser la gran figura de la Sudamericana, el otro llega de Unión con la ilusión de triunfar. Los dos tienen fuertes apodos relacionados con el boxeo y conformarán la dupla ofensiva de Racing en la próxima temporada. Adrián Balboa, más conocido como Rocky, se sumó en las últimas horas a la Academia y está listo para armar una tentadora sociedad con Adrián Martínez, el popular Maravilla.\nEstá claro que la táctica de Gustavo Costas es buscar tapados. Le salió perfecto con Martínez, que venía de una buena temporada en Instituto y rindió en gran forma. Y ahora la apuesta es por Balboa, de interesante rendimiento en Unión. De movida, no tuvo los números de Maravilla, pero buscará captar rápido la idea del DT.\nBalboa y su gran oportunidad\nAdrián Balboa tendrá su gran chance en uno de los equipos más armados del país. Le dio una larga vuelta a su carrera, ya jugó en equipos con cartel (Alianza Lima en 2019-2020) y tuvo temporadas muy efectivas (19 goles en la 22-23 con Defensor Sporting), pero le falta ese año de la consolidación y sueña con que se de en Racing. En Unión jugó 34 partidos y anotó 7 goles. Acá, está muy por debajo de los números de Maravilla, que llegó de la Gloria con 18 en 42. Martínez, además, viene de hacer 30 goles en 48 juegos.\nMaxi Salas, el gran rival\nSu apodo es Rocky, pero la pelea de Balboa por el puesto será brava porque Maximiliano Salas también viene de una gran temporada. Fue otra apuesta de Costas que salió muy bien porque el ex Atlético Rafaela se la bancó e incluso le sacó el puesto a Roger Martínez. Y ojo que está Luciano Vietto, quien llegó sobre el final de la temporada, pero ya mostró su clase. Sin dudas, el DT tiene un buen cuarteto ofensivo y las combinaciones son variadas. Ahora, ninguna, tan explosiva y noqueadora como Rocky-Maravilla.",
