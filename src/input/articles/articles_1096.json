    "text": "New group to focus on saving lives on Nevada’s roads LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - Law enforcement, federal, state, and local leaders, as well as survivors Law enforcement, federal, state, and local leaders, as well as survivors, and family members of victims of traffic crashes, are coming together to make Nevada’s roads safer places. On Thursday they announced the formation of “Stop Road Crashes.” It’s a group dedicated to addressing, and changing, the myriad dangers facing drivers, and pedestrians, on and along the state’s roads. “This is a group that really started from the grassroots up. Stop Road Crashes, we’re here to advocate for positive change on roadways and protect the citizens of our state and we’re here in regard to traffic safety, there’s an issue in our community and everyone is aware of that and you see on the news, unfortunately, every day, and these last couple of weeks,” said Jason Patchett, the father of a teenager killed by a reckless driver. Patchett worked very hard to get state lawmakers to pass “Rex’s Law” after a speeding driver ran down his son in a school zone right in front of his Henderson middle school. [Father of Henderson teen killed by reckless driver testifies on bill that would increase penalties](https://www.fox5vegas.com/2023/04/12/father-henderson-teen-killed-by-reckless-driver-testifies-bill-that-would-increase-penalties/) Tina Lavoie, the president and founder of Stop Road Crashes, lost her daughter to a single vehicle crash near Reno. “Through our 13 years of speaking about Hilary and trying to pass a primary seatbelt law and being successful of passing a distracted driving law what we found is it’s not getting better on our roads, it’s getting worse since 2010 - 13 years - crashes have increased, fatalities have increased, pedestrian fatalities have increased and we have to do something,” said Lavoie. Speed and impairment continue to be the leading causes of traffic-related deaths here in Southern Nevada. Pedestrian fatalities have reached record levels. While overall traffic deaths inch upwards. But those aren’t the only issues plaguing our streets. “Traffic violence has increased substantially and we’re seeking to bring awareness to that from the community level and up. And we feel our voices are a collective and will be very powerful. We’re seeking not only legislative change but just behavioral change within our community. Allow people to think twice before they get behind the wheel, no matter what it is. Whether they’re going down the street or taking a longer trip, to really concentrate on all the road users we have and a lot of those road users are pedestrians and on the sidewalks or kids on bikes and scooters on the sidewalks, we really have to pay attention to that,” said Patchett. Lavoie says change involves awareness, and that’s the group’s main mission. “I was one of those people that would see this tragic thing on TV and think I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine. And you can’t, you can’t put yourself in that position and we don’t want you to know, we don’t want you to understand and know how that feels because that means you’ve lost someone special on our roads, someone you love and care about somebody in your family,” shares Lavoie. And Patchett says, in most cases, most crashes are completely preventable. “That’s the goal of the Stop Road Crashes organization to bring awareness to the issue to road fatalities that resulted in behavior that is reckless and frankly selfish. So, today was kind of an effort to proclaim our goals and desires but also to seek help and we can’t do this alone. I learned that lesson through the valuable legislature and sought to pass Rex’s law and it wasn’t just me or my family and I that were able to successfully took a community my friends my neighbors those within the Southern Nevada community.” The group comes together on the Friday before a weekend traditionally known for a spike in drunk driving arrests. The [National Safety Council](https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/motor-vehicle/holidays/new-years-day/) estimates some 375 people will die in car crashes in the U.S. over the New Year’s Day holiday period. Local law enforcement and Nevada State Police will mount extra patrols dedicated to finding, and stopping, impaired drivers. Safety advocates say it’s not just about avoiding a DUI, it’s about saving lives. “There’s no excuse for impaired driving other speakers are talking about that, the busses are free, the tram’s one dollar, ride shares give you discounts, there’s coupons online. You can’t go out and spend $100 on alcohol and say you can’t afford a sober ride to and from the event. That just the math doesn’t add up.” [First responders say Las Vegas is safe, secure, and ready for New Year’s Eve](https://www.fox5vegas.com/2023/12/28/first-responders-say-las-vegas-is-safe-secure-ready-new-years-eve/) There are several free or low-cost options available for those looking to party smart on New Year’s Eve. With road closures beginning around five on Sunday, public transportation, taxis or rideshares, may be the most convenient way to get to the Strip or Downtown. Stop Road Crashes plans a contest for next year’s holiday season. Members tell us it will involve signing a pledge to drive safely, soberly, and vigilantly during the holiday season, with the possibility of winning a grand prize. FOX5 will have more details on that when the group releases them. Copyright 2023 KVVU. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Summary - The original USS Enterprise model from Star Trek has been returned to Gene Roddenberry's son after being missing since the 1970s. - The 3-foot version of the Enterprise featured in the 1960s Star Trek is now authenticated and set to be restored for public exhibition. - Rod Roddenberry plans to find a museum to showcase the iconic Enterprise model. The first model of the USS Enterprise used in Star Trek: The Original Series has been returned to Gene Roddenberry's son, Eugene \"Rod\" Roddenberry. Missing since the 1970s when Gene Roddenberry loaned it to the filmmakers of 1979's Star Trek: The Motion Picture, the 3-foot model of the Starship Enterprise was used in Star Trek's original pilot episode, \"The Cage,\" as well as the opening credits of Star Trek: The Original Series. The model popped up on eBay last fall, and the sellers took it down and then contacted Dallas-based Heritage Auctions to authenticate it. Yahoo! News reports that last weekend, the lost original model of Star Trek's USS Enterprise was returned to Rod Roddenberry. The now-found and authenticated Enterprise model was the prototype for the 11-foot version featured in the episodes of the 1960s Star Trek . The larger model is on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. Rod Roddenberry commented on the Enterprise model's return: “This is not going home to adorn my shelves. This is going to get restored and we’re working on ways to get it out so the public can see it and my hope is that it will land in a museum somewhere.” Rod Roddenberry also officially commented on the return of the lost USS Enterprise model on his Instagram (@eugeneroddenberryofficial): [ ](/star-trek-every-enterprise-version/) The Federation flagship, the USS Enterprise, has a long, fabled history, and each version of the classic Star Trek spacecraft has its own unique look. [ Star Trek: Every Version Of The Starship Enterprise ](/star-trek-every-enterprise-version/) How Star Trek's Lost USS Enterprise Model Was Returned To Roddenberry A vital piece of Star Trek history is finally home It was a long road for the original USS Enterprise model to return home to Rod Roddenberry. The 3-foot Enterprise model graced the desk of Gene Roddenberry, but after it was loaned out to https://screenrant.com/star-trek-original-series-cancelled-season-3-reason-why/, it vanished, and, “No one knew what happened to it,\" according to Rod Roddenberry. Heritage's Auction's executive vice president, Joe Maddalena, said the auction house was contacted by people who said they'd discovered the lost Enterprise model in a storage unit. It was brought to Heritage's Beverly Hills office where they instantly knew \"it was the real thing.\" Amusingly, Rod Roddenberry is also \"vindicated\" because of a long-running rumor that he destroyed the original Enterprise model as a boy by throwing it in a swimming pool. Joe Maddalena said the original USS Enterprise model could easily sell for $1-million at auction, but as a \"cultural icon,\" it is essentially \"priceless.\" Rod Roddenberry admits he has vague memories of the 3-foot Enterprise model, and he didn't think much about it until he was contacted when the model briefly appeared on eBay. Roddenberry said he appreciates that everyone involved agreed it was the right thing to do to return the model. Without going into details about the agreement reached, Roddenberry added, “I felt it important to reward that and show appreciation for that.” Roughly 50 years after it disappeared, a crucial piece of Star Trek history has finally come home.

    "text": "The deal would have raised wages by 25%, lowered employees’ share of health care costs, and boosted retirement contributions by the company. In addition, Boeing promised that the company's next plane would be built at its facilities in the Pacific northwest — rather than at Boeing's non-unionized plant in South Carolina. But many rank and file union members were unhappy with the offer, which fell short of the 40% raise and pension changes that the union was seeking. The strike comes at a difficult time for Boeing, which is already grappling with a safety crisis after a door plug panel blew out of a 737 Max jet in midair in January. That forced the company to slow production of its best-selling plane as it works to shore up quality control across its factories and supply chain, and rebuild trust with airlines, regulators and the flying public. Before the vote, new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg urged workers to approve the contract. “A strike would put our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together,” Ortberg said in a letter to employees in Washington and Oregon. After the strike authorization, Boeing released a conciliatory statement saying it's \"clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members. We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.” Copyright 2024 NPR",
