    "title": "The Star Wars Outlaws Steam version has fewer than 1,000 players at launch",
    "text": "Star Wars Outlaws has launched on Steam, just shy of three months since its initial release – but you’d be forgiven for having not noticed it. Despite a gorgeous open world and the promise of a new tale starring bounty hunter Kay Vess, the RPG has fallen short of Ubisoft’s sales expectations, and a re-release on Valve’s store doesn’t seem to have helped. Since its launch yesterday, Thursday November 21, Star Wars Outlaws has failed to break the 1,000 concurrent player mark on Steam, although reviews remain upbeat so far.\nAs someone who likes stories that take a step away from the Jedi, Star Wars Outlaws should be right up my street. Yet so far it has fallen short of Ubisoft’s best open-world games . In our Star Wars Outlaws review , Paul bemoans its “uninteresting open world and tedious stealth sections” that drag down “what could have been the start of something special.” First launched on Friday August 30, it’s now finally available via Steam, but it’s yet to break big.\nSo far, the Star Wars Outlaws Steam player count has reached a concurrent high of just 834 players. There are certainly some additional factors that could be at play here – it arrived on a Thursday, for example meaning we may see a climb over the weekend. The Steam edition of Assassin’s Creed Mirage, for example, started slowly but gradually climbed to a high of 7,870.\nOutlaws has also previously been available on other PC storefronts, which could mean that interested players have already picked it up elsewhere. However, many other games that have followed this model haven’t been so dramatically impacted – sandbox hit Satisfactory drew more than 27,000 players when it arrived on Steam in early access more than a year after it had first launched on the Epic Games Store.\nThere’s still some hope that we could see a rise – particularly if the response to Star Wars Outlaws update 1.4 , which overhauls combat with changes to both shooting and cover mechanics, ends up being positive. Currently, Steam reviews sit at a ‘mostly positive’ 70%. Nevertheless, this probably isn’t the major splash Ubisoft was hoping for. Whether it’s Star Wars fatigue or an overdose of open-world action, people don’t seem eager yet.\nStar Wars Outlaws is out now on Steam, with a 25% launch discount until Thursday December 5 pricing it at $52.49 / £44.99 for the base edition, $82.49 / £71.24 for the gold edition, or $97.49 / £86.24 for the ultimate edition. You can find it right here .\nAlternatively, dip into our pick of the best Star Wars games for more tales from that galaxy far, far away, or perhaps one of the best RPGs on PC in 2024.\nYou can also follow us on Google News for daily PC games news, reviews, and guides, or grab our PCGN deals tracker to net yourself some bargains.",

    "text": "Rubro-Negro fecha o primeiro turno com vitória, mas volta a sofrer gol do adversário pelo sétimo jogo consecutivo O Flamengo superou o Vitória na última quarta-feira, mas com uma atuação pobre, em Salvador. Além da baixa criação, a defesa voltou a dar sinais da instabilidade na atual temporada. Pela sétima vez consecutiva, o clube carioca voltou a sofrer um gol de uma equipe adversária. A sequência é a pior do setor na passagem de Tite. Defesa do Flamengo vive pior momento sob o comando de Tite - Foto: Gilvan de Souza/CRF Contra o Vitória, o Flamengo teve mudanças no setor defensivo. O zagueiro Léo Pereira retomou a posição de titular, ao lado de Fabrício Bruno. David Luiz , por sua vez, ficou como opção no banco de reservas. Além disso, Viña começou jogando na vaga de Ayrton Lucas na lateral esquerda, e Tite não pode escalar Pulgar e Wesley com problemas físicos. O Rubro-Negro nos dois últimos jogos terminou com três pontos sobre Criciúma e Vitória. Porém, em jogos contra o Juventude , Fortaleza e Cuiabá custaram preciosos pontos para o Flamengo na luta pelo título do Brasileiro. Tite, como sempre reforça em coletiva, disse que o clube busca a evolução para o equilíbrio na defesa e no ataque. Atualmente, o Fla tem 13 de saldo de gols, com 32 gols e 19 sofridos. Com a vitória no Barradão, o Flamengo terminou o primeiro turno com 37 pontos, passou o Palmeiras - assumindo a segunda colocação - e diminuiu a distância para o líder Botafogo , que tem um jogo a mais e 40 somados. No próximo domingo, o Rubro-Negro estreia no returno contra o Atlético-GO , no Maracanã, às 16h. Siga nosso conteúdo nas redes sociais: Twitter, Instagram e Facebook.",
