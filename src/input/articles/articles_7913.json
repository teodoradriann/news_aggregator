    "text": "Sin descanso, al ritmo que marcan los estándares de una auténtica estrella del rock, lo que ya es, Carlos Alcaraz cerró este jueves su 2023 con una exhibición en el Palacio de los Deportes de Murcia. El miércoles, en Riad, venció a Djokovic en otro encuentro amistoso; esta vez, en un evento que llevaba su nombre (Copa Carlos Alcaraz), superó a Roberto Bautista (7-6 y 1-6 y 10-7) para redondear la fiesta de los asistentes, entregados a su hijo pródigo, y su año. La velada lo tuvo todo. Nada que envidiar a la generosa puesta en escena que Carlitos había vivido horas antes en tierras saudíes. Música, luces, partidos previos con talentos nacionales y regionales, etc. Ni Alejandro Valverde, otro ídolo de la zona, se lo quiso perder. “El clima, la comida, la buena gente, todo se contagia y sale lo que sale, de los mejores en todos los sectores”, dijo ‘El Bala’, orgulloso, desde unas gradas completamente llenas, que habían agotado sus 7.000 entradas en horas. “Espectacular ver el ambiente del Palacio de los Deportes de Murcia lleno, disfrutando con el número uno”, compartió el presidente de la Comunidad Autónoma, Fernando López Miras, en redes sociales. Tras este último ‘bolo’, con fines benéficos, Alcaraz ultimará su preparación para el Open de Australia, en el que partirá como segundo favorito. Los días 10 y 12 de enero, tiene previstos dos partidos de preparación en Melbourne. Sigue el canal de Diario AS en WhatsApp, donde encontrarás todas las claves deportivas del día.",

Pictured: Emergency services at the scene\nEmergency services scrambled to the scene near Glaisdale at 11:48am today following reports of a serious incident involving a vehicle\nHe and two others used tractors to pull the 4×4 on to the riverbank, he said.\nMr Ford said: ‘There was a ford they were going over and they were swept down 400 yards.\n‘They were part of an off-road club.\n‘I went down with my tractor. There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up.\n‘You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water.\n‘I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.’\nA 4×4 was recovered from the river by the fire service just after 3pm and the three men found inside had died, North Yorkshire Police said.\nThree men inside the 4×4 died while another man who attempted to help them was pulled to safety from the river at around 12:10pm.

    "text": "Netflix sofre vazamento massivo de filmes e séries previstos para os próximos meses Conteúdos inéditos de animes e longas animados foram disponibilizados ilegalmente na internet A Netflix enfrenta um grande vazamento de filmes e séries programados para lançamento até 2025. Diversos títulos que só deveriam chegar ao público nos próximos meses já estão circulando ilegalmente em sites piratas. O vazamento parece estar relacionado a uma suposta invasão a um estúdio de dublagem, já que o material disponibilizado cobre essencialmente animações e possui marcas d'água dessa empresa. Filmes e séries vazados Entre os filmes vazados, destaca-se \"Plankton\", sobre o vilão do universo de \"Bob Esponja\", previsto para estrear em 2025, e \"Enfeitiçados\", uma animação musical com estreia marcada para novembro. Além disso, vários animes e séries animadas japonesas foram disponibilizados, como a 1ª temporada completa do remake de \"Ranma ½\" e os seis primeiros episódios de \"Dandadan\", ambos com lançamento previsto para outubro. Mais conteúdos comprometidos A lista de conteúdos vazados inclui ainda todos os episódios de \"Exterminador do Futuro Zero\" e metade da 2ª temporada de \"Arcane\" (episódios 1 a 5). A série animada \"Jentry Chau vs the Underworld\" e o anime \"Fountain of Dreams\" também foram totalmente vazados. Além disso, o primeiro episódio da 3ª temporada de \"Re:Zero\" e uma nova adaptação do anime \"Mononoke\", denominada \"The Phantom Rain\", completam a lista dos conteúdos comprometidos. Entretanto, a lista continua recebendo atualizações. Baixa qualidade dos vazamentos Os conteúdos vazados apresentam marcas d'água que denunciam sua origem, e os vídeos estão em baixa resolução, com qualidade de som e imagem comprometidas. A Netflix ainda não se manifestou sobre o ocorrido. O espaço segue aberto.",

    "text": "By Neil Pooran ,\n23 minutes ago\nCharles Kennedy’s family are “extremely pleased” that the area of the Highlands he represented is once again a Liberal Democrat-held constituency, the new MP has said.\nAngus MacDonald won the newly formed seat of Inverness , Skye and West Ross-shire at the General Election, finishing ahead of the SNP’s Drew Hendry with a majority of 2,160.\nFormer Lib Dem leader Mr Kennedy represented Ross, Skye and Lochaber until 2015. He died shortly after losing his seat.\nMr MacDonald’s constituency was the very last to be declared due to the returning officer ordering a recount, with the results being announced on Saturday morning.\nThe former army officer is a businessman and author as well as being a Highland councillor.\nHe told the PA news agency he was hopeful of a win despite polls suggesting the seat would stay in SNP hands.\nHe said: “Not one single poll had the SNP losing, and quite a few had me behind Labour and the Conservatives.”\nAt about one o’clock on election night “the SNP’s mood went from being buoyant to being dejected” as the vote counting process suggested the Lib Dems were ahead, he said.\nThe returning officer’s decision meant the constituency, which stretches from Skye in the west to Inverness in the east, would not be formally declared until Saturday.\nBut Mr MacDonald said the result was clear at that point, saying: “The fact is, Drew Hendry conceded on the first night…\n“There was an assumption amongst almost everybody that I had won.”\nMr Hendry, who had been an MP since 2015, said it had been an “absolute joy” to represent those in the area.\nIn his concession statement, he said: “I am obviously disappointed not to be continuing that representation under the new Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire boundary and wish the new MP every success in his new role.\n“People need an MP who will fight for their needs both local and at UK level and during this cost-of-living crisis, they have never needed help and assistance more.”\nCharles Kennedy’s son Donald was supportive of Mr MacDonald’s campaign, providing him with a quote for campaign leaflets as he sought to regain the area for the Lib Dems after nine years.\nThe new MP said: “The family were extremely pleased.\n“There was no doubt at all that they felt it was great it had been reclaimed for the Liberal Democrats.”\nHe wore full highland dress, including his family MacDonald of Keppoch tartan kilt to the election count – an outfit he plans to sport again at the state opening of Parliament next week.\nMr MacDonald said there is “elation” in the Lib Dems after they took 71 seats across the UK and he will focus on improving transport and infrastructure in the Highlands.\nAfter being sworn in at Westminster he said the building was “awe-inspiring”, adding: “I’m incredibly pleased and honoured to be part of it, I must be one of the luckiest people in Britain.”\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

[Corea del Norte](https://www.unotv.com/internacional/kim-jong-un-pide-acelerar-preparativos-para-la-guerra/) lleva años imponiendo duras penas a cualquiera que sea sorprendido disfrutando del entretenimiento surcoreano o copiando la forma de hablar de los surcoreanos, en una guerra contra las influencias externas desde que en 2020 se impuso una nueva y avasalladora ley de “pensamiento antirreaccionario”. “A juzgar por el castigo, parece que con esto se quiere mostrar a la gente de toda Corea del Norte lo que pasa, para advertirles. Si es así, parece que este estilo de vida de la cultura surcoreana prevalece en la sociedad norcoreana”Dijo Choi Kyong-hui, presidente de SAND y doctor en Ciencias Políticas por la Universidad de Tokio, que desertó de Corea del Norte en 2001 “Creo que este video se editó en torno a 2022 (…). Lo que es problemático para (el líder norcoreano) Kim Jong Un es que los jóvenes de la generación milennial y de la generación Z han cambiado su forma de pensar. Creo que está tratando de que vuelvan a la manera norcoreana”, agregó.

Todos los estudiantes, incluidos las dos de 16 años, llevan mascarillas, lo que sugiere que las imágenes se grabaron durante la pandemia de COVID. [¿YA CONOCES EL CANAL DE WHATSAPP DE UNO TV?

    "text": "Diego Sinhue propone a expresidente del PAN Guanajuato como consejero del PJ | Especial El gobernador de Guanajuato, Diego Sinhue Rodríguez Vallejo, comentó sobre los beneficios e inconvenientes que las recientes lluvias torrenciales, provocadas por fenómenos naturales en las costas del Pacífico y el Atlántico, han traído al estado y regiones aledañas, tanto en zonas urbanas como rurales y boscosas. Respecto a la tormenta tropical &#039;Alberto&#039;, que se degradó a depresión tropical luego de tocar tierra en Tamaulipas el 20 de junio, el mandatario estatal señaló que, afortunadamente, en Guanajuato sólo se registraron lluvias leves, sin reportes de daños mayores. Sin embargo, el gobernador destacó un beneficio importante de estas precipitaciones en la Sierra Gorda, donde las autoridades enfrentaban un incendio forestal que no habían podido sofocar en Xichú debido al caudal de los ríos, que dificultaba el acceso de rescatistas, guardabosques y bomberos forestales. Tras la degradación de &#039;Alberto&#039;, se reportó el ingreso de un nuevo sistema de baja presión en el Atlántico, que podría evolucionar a tormenta tropical y recibir el nombre de Beryl, lo cual podría traer más lluvias a la entidad. El gobernador destacó los beneficios de estas precipitaciones para combatir incendios forestales y llenar las presas de la entidad, lo cual es crucial para el sector agrícola. Sin embargo, también reconoció la posibilidad de daños mayores si las lluvias se intensifican.",
