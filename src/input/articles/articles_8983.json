    "text": "Business\nJuly 31, 2025 by\nJuliana Agbo\n‘How biotech can tackle food crisis’\nIslamic clerics and experts have thrown their weight behind the adoption of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and biotechnology in agriculture, citing their potential to solve Nigeria’s deepening food security crisis.\nSpeaking at a sensitisation workshop organised by the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology (OFAB) Nigeria, under the National Biotechnology Research and Development Agency (NBRDA), religious leaders pledged spiritual and moral support for government-led biotech initiatives.\nSecretary to the Chief Imam of Dantata Mosque, Malam Abdullahi Nuhu, said the endorsement reflects a broader commitment within the Islamic community to support innovation that can improve livelihoods and ensure food availability.\n“We pledge our prayers and spiritual support to ensure the success of these programmes across Nigeria,” Nuhu stated. “Our leaders encourage us to back these efforts wholeheartedly.”\nDirector-General of NBRDA, Prof. Abdullahi Mustapha, highlighted the critical role of GM technology in addressing Nigeria’s food and environmental challenges.\nHe assured participants that GMO seeds being deployed are locally produced by Nigerian companies, giving the country control over production and supply.\n“Rejecting safe and tested innovations at a time of growing food insecurity would be a missed opportunity,” Mustapha warned.\n“This is about ensuring food self-sufficiency while protecting our environment.”\nRead Also: Abiodun, Makinde meet on food, security\nNBRDA’s Director of Agricultural Biotechnology, Dr Rose Gidado, outlined the practical benefits of GM crops, including reduced pesticide use, pest resistance, longer shelf life, and climate resilience.\n“Biotechnology holds the key to building a sustainable agricultural system and fostering socio-economic development,” she said.\nThe Principal Investigator of the Pod Borer Resistant (PBR) cowpea, Prof. Mohammed Ishiyaku, described biotechnology as a cost-effective and sustainable solution to low farm yields.\n“These crops meet international safety standards and have been proven safe for both human consumption and the environment,” henoted.\nThe workshop brought together scientists, policymakers, and faith-based leaders to deepen understanding and build consensus around the role of biotechnology in agricultural transformation.",

    "title": "The World Rallies To President Trump’s Defense In Aftermath Of Kangaroo Court Verdict Paul Ingrassia",
    "text": "Biden and his Democratic allies were in for a crude awakening in the aftermath of last week’s sham guilty verdict against President Trump, the byproduct of a kangaroo trial that denied the leading man to be America’s next president due process rights and his freedom of expression. While Biden was expecting the American people to at long last turn on President Trump, in fact the opposite occurred: they rallied to his side, at a rate previously unseen in modern presidential history. President Trump’s fundraising haul since last week’s conviction has been historic: he has hauled in hundreds of millions of dollars of cash. In May, President Trump’s campaign posted its highest figure ever – $141 million – far outpacing Joe Biden, who has been struggling mightily to prevent the bloodletting of voters across every demographic group to President Trump’s corner. Indeed, on the same day the 45 th President held his press conference at Trump Tower to denounce the Biden-Bragg show verdict as but the latest attempt in the Left’s never-ending saga to derail MAGA and rig another presidential election, new polling came out showing the 45 th President with a 6-point nationwide advantage over Biden , and leading in all six key battleground states this cycle : Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Nevada. While Biden’s problems are bad on the domestic front, they get arguably worse overseas. The international order has descended into chaos under Biden’s stewardship. Western countries have been ravaged by strife and warfare in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to levels not seen since World War II. Meanwhile, autocratic regimes like China, Iran, and Russia have been empowered, relative to the United States and Europe, which have been brought to near financial and cultural ruin by the suicidal policies of the Biden government. The world community is hurting – and they can see the show trial for what it is: a persecution of a political opponent, plain and simple. Many of the countries that rallied to the 45 th President’s defense and called Biden’s bluff had firsthand experience with political prosecutions, those being dark parts of their histories, and how a weaponized justice system can bring down a democratic and free society. For example, Nayib Bukele, the new president of El Salvador, said in a recent sit-down interview with Tucker Carlson that the Democrats are making a “huge mistake” by arresting President Trump. Over the course of the conversation, Bukele said the lawfare against President Trump has given him “the greatest campaign ever” and “will just give [President Trump] more votes.” “all the things that they do to him will\njust give him more votes.” pic.twitter.com/Zp9uXEqUSh — Alex Bruesewitz (@alexbruesewitz) June 6, 2024 The sentiment Bukele expressed was shared by leaders from across the world. In the United Kingdom, Nigel Farage, current leader of the Reform Party, denounced the Biden show trial in the harshest of terms, contending that the Left “overplayed their hand.” He added that he is now “more certain [President Trump] will win.” Farage’s remarks were echoed by former Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, who also was no-holds-barred in his takedown of the guilty verdict: “When we see this happening in Africa, or in Russia, we denounce it as authoritarian and corrupt. Well, the American people have looked at it, and decided that the methods and the motives are fundamentally the same. Whatever his detractors may say, I believe that Donald Trump – at his best – could offer the world the strong, confident leadership that it needs.” Matteo Salvini, Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister, joined his British companions in offering his own withering critique of the verdict . Salvini issued a statement, later reposted by President Trump, which said: “Solidarity and full support for @realDonaldTrump, victim of judicial harassment and a process of political nature. In Italy, we are sadly familiar with the weaponization of the justice system by the [L]eft, given that for years attempts have been made to eliminate political opponents through legal means. I hope Trump wins; it would be a guarantee of greater balance and hope for world peace.” Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister of Hungary, also offered supporting words on behalf of the 45 th President , saying: “I’ve known President [Trump] to be a man of honour. As President, he always put America first, he commanded respect around the world and used this respect to build peace. Let the people make their verdict this November! Keep on fighting, Mr. President!” Things have gotten so bad with the weaponized justice system in the United States that even autocratic countries, like Russia and China, sharply denounced the political prosecutions occurring here. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for the Kremlin, condemned the guilty verdict as the “elimination of political rivals by all possible legal or illegal means.” Even China, perhaps America’s greatest foreign adversary (and not known for being a bastion of democracy and freedom), reported negatively about the verdict. Chinese state media framed the verdict as yet another way by the Biden government to “exacerbate political extremism” and “social unrest” domestically. News of President Trump’s unprecedented conviction at the hand of a politicized and weaponized Justice Department has spread like wildfire the world over. Many countries that once viewed the United States as a beacon of freedom are developing a much different view, one that is deeply jaded about the current trajectory under Joe Biden, of which the verdict is but only the latest example of a laundry list of woes. Trending: BREAKING: Georgia Court of Appeals Halts All Proceedings in Trump RICO Case Biden is equal parts awful at home and abroad: he strikes the image of a bumbling idiot on the global stage, conveying extreme weakness and incompetence, while running roughshod over the rule of law and civil liberties at home – going so far as to risk plunging America into chaos by prosecuting his leading political opponent in order to cheat his way to a second term, because at this point cheating and lawfare is the only way he knows how to win elections.",

    "text": "A woman who bought a 2023 Hyundai Palisade took it in for a minor repair. Now she says the dealership is telling her she needs a whole new car.\nShe’s afraid they’re trying to scam her.\nCreator Savannah Dixen ( @savannahdixen ) shared her story on TikTok this weekend.\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use . “I need someone to tell me if the dealership is trying to scam me into a new car,” Dixen begins.\nShe says she bought a used 2023 Hyundai Palisade Limited a year ago with roughly 26,000 miles on it. Now it has 45,700 miles.\nOver the past year, Dixen says she’s had three separate electrical outages where the car shut off. This has led to issues with the locks, windows, dashboard, lights, moonroof, and opening the doors.\nEach time Dixen has taken the Palisade to the dealership, they’ve purportedly told her, “we can’t find a code for it, we can’t help you.” The dealership allegedly also informed her that this issue will keep happening until there is a code to fix it.\n“Now I’m nervous. Last time this happened, I was driving and everything went out, and I had to pull over.” Dixen shares.\nShe claims the dealership's proposed solution is for her to buy a new car. Dixen says they’re trying to get her into a 2025 Hyundai .\n“I feel like the dealership is trying to screw me into buying a brand new car,” she concludes.\nDo You Really Need A Code to Fix It?\n“Is there anything I can do? Is the dealership trying to screw me?” Dixen asks.\nSome said she should take the car to another dealership or autoshop. Others agree that she should trade the Palisade in.\nThe top comment suggests, “1. Go to another dealership. 2. Don’t tell them about this issue, since it’s not obvious. 3. Trade that in for a more reliable SUV. Stay away from Hyundai and GMC.”\n“The dealer isn’t scamming you. The issue has to occur for the dealer to find the fix,” another added.\nSomeone who describes themself as a Hyundai employee suggested that it’s not the dealership’s fault.\n“I work for a Hyundai dealer and the warranty requires codes. If there are no codes and it can’t be replicated, the warranty unfortunately will not cover it,” they wrote. “This is standard protocol. The next time it happens, record what is happening, call the dealer and have it towed to them so they can be present when it’s happening and they can have a chance to diagnose it.”\nOther drivers on Reddit , Quora , and CarTalk forums have also faced issues with dealerships not fixing the issues without a code.\n“‘We can’t duplicate the issue’ is the standard reply, even when they’ve seen the issue frequently and know what it is. They likely have to get permission to do the work,” one Redditor claimed.\nElectrical issues are often tricky to fix. Without a code or being able to replicate the issue, the dealership's mechanics often won’t touch it.\nThis is why many people suggested Dixen take her Hyundai to an independent repair shop.\nCan She File a Claim Under the Lemon Law? Lemon laws protect car buyers in case a vehicle is unsafe and unable to be fixed within a reasonable number of attempts and time.\nEach state has its own version of the lemon law, so whether you’re able to get relief will depend on the law of the land in your jurisdiction.\nIn Dixen’s case, Washington does not apply its lemon law to used vehicles. So, although her Palisade is a 2023, which most would consider relatively new, because she bought it used, Dixen likely doesn’t have recourse under the lemon law.\nDixen says she’s filed a claim with Hyundai Consumer Affairs, and the company wants to analyze the car internally.\nMotor1 has contacted Dixen via email. This story will be updated if she responds.\nShare this Story Got a tip for us? Email: tips@motor1.com\nJoin the conversation ( )",
