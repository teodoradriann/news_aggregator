    "text": "The GCAptAIN study did not meet its primary endpoint of sustained remission at Week 52 in adults with newly diagnosed or relapsing GCA 1\nSafety in GCA patients was consistent with known safety profile of Cosentyx (secukinumab) 1\nBasel, July 03, 2025 – Novartis today announced top-line results from the Phase III GCAptAIN study evaluating Cosentyx (secukinumab) in adults with newly diagnosed or relapsing giant cell arteritis (GCA).\nIn the study, Cosentyx was evaluated in combination with a 26-week steroid taper and compared to placebo plus a 52-week steroid taper. Cosentyx did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in sustained remission at Week 52 compared to placebo. While the secondary outcomes did not show statistical superiority, Cosentyx showed numerically better outcomes compared to placebo for cumulative steroid dose and steroid-related toxicity 1 . Safety in GCA was consistent with the known safety profile of Cosentyx 1 , which is supported by robust evidence and 10 years of real-world data across its approved indications 2- 7 .\nAnzeige Handeln Sie Ihre Einschätzung zu Novartis AG!

Patients were randomized into three treatment arms: Cosentyx 300 mg, Cosentyx 150 mg, or placebo, all in combination with a glucocorticoid (GC) taper regimen. The primary endpoint of the trial is to assess whether secukinumab 300 mg s.c. plus a 26-week GC taper is superior to placebo plus a 52-week GC taper in achieving sustained remission at Week 52 and the first secondary endpoint is the cumulative GC dose through Week 52 8 .\nSeite 1 von 5 Seite 2 ►\nDiskutieren Sie über die enthaltenen Werte",

Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below\nNearly every pew was filled with attendees Friday inside downtown’s Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament as the Catholic Church ordained Auxiliary Bishop Rey Bersabal, who became the fifth Filipino to be ordained as a bishop in the United States.\n“I’m hoping we continue to work shoulder-to-shoulder in serving the people of God in Sacramento,” Bersabal said at the conclusion of a two-hour ordination ceremony held at the cathedral on 11th Street.\nBersabal, 59, speaks English, Tagalog, Visayan and Spanish. Since 2012, he has been the liaison in the Catholic Diocese of Sacramento for the Filipino presbyterate, or priesthood.\nBishop Jaime Soto , who presided over Friday’s ceremony, welcomed Bersabal into the college of bishops, many of whom traveled to Sacramento from throughout California and as far as Philadelphia and the Philippines.\nAuxiliary Bishop Rey Bersabal prostrates in front of the altar on Friday, May 31, 2024 during a ceremony as Sacramento Bishop Jaime Soto reads a scripture.\n“To provide us with another coworker,” Soto said during the ceremony. “To unite us under the Lord.“\nBersabal joined the Diocese of Sacramento in 1999 at the invitation of Bishop Emeritus William K. Weigand, serving in multiple parishes and capacities, including parochial vicar, pastor and dean across several parishes. He also has served on the diocesan priests’ personnel board, liturgical commission and independent review board.\nHe has served as pastor of St. Francis of Assisi Parish in midtown since July 2022, and he will continue in this role while serving as vicar general of the diocese, which serves Catholics across interior California from the capital to the Oregon border.\n“I join you in your happiness today,” said Cardinal Christophe Louis Yves Georges Pierre, the apostolic nuncio to the U.S. on hand to read an official letter from Pope Francis elevating Bersabal.\nAuxiliary Bishop Rey Bersabal looks out to the parishioners gather to celebrate his ordination on Friday, May 31, 2024 during a ceremony becoming the fifth Filipino to be named a bishop in the United States.

Auxiliary Bishop Rey Bersabal gives a blessing to parishioners after his ordination on Friday, May 31, 2024 during a ceremony becoming the fifth Filipino to be named a bishop in the United States.\nBersabal was born in Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental in the Philippines; the youngest of three children. His family’s deep faith inspired his choice to join the priesthood.\nHe attended both Catholic and public schools, before entering the seminary of San Jose de Mindanao in the Philippines. Bersabal later obtained a degree in philosophy from Ateneo de Cagayan Xavier University in his home country.\nBersabal was ordained as a priest in April 1991, for the Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro — holding various roles including parochial vicar, parish administrator and parish priest. He served as chancellor, archdiocesan director of the Pontifical Mission Societies, and assessor of marriage cases for the metropolitan tribunal.\nAuxiliary Bishop Rey Bersabal gives thanks to participants of his ordination ceremony on Friday, May 31, 2024f.

The team was offering $20 an hour, along with complimentary food and breaks \"in a comfortable warm area,\" to prospective snow shovelers.\nThat was before the postseason contest, originally scheduled for Sunday afternoon, got postponed on Saturday due to public safety concerns amid an ongoing winter weather emergency in western New York.\nGet Philly local news, weather forecasts, sports and entertainment stories to your inbox.\n[Sign up for NBC Philadelphia newsletters.]\nThe heavy snow and high winds caused the game to be\n[moved to Monday at 4:30 p.m. ET](/news/sports/nfl/how-to-watch-bills-vs-steelers-wild-card-game-on-monday).\nWhile the snow was still coming down early Sunday, clean-up efforts were underway at the Orchard Park, New York,\n[NFL](/tag/nfl) stadium. And a member of Bills Mafia was helping out in a very Bills Mafia fashion.\nNFL\nThe Bills have since\nasked prospective snow shovelers to abide by travel bans and not report to the stadium until the bans are lifted.\n\"There will eventually be multiple shifts available for snow shovelers to work and be part of the team to get the venue ready for the hometown Bills [wild-card playoff game] vs. the Steelers,\" the team said on Sunday.\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul\nannounced Sunday afternoon that a travel ban remains in place for the City of Buffalo, across central Erie County and the Southtowns. But Hochul did say that the Steelers-Bills game \"will not be pushed back again.\"\nThe Steelers, meanwhile, flew from Pittsburgh to Buffalo on Sunday afternoon.\nThe\nweather forecast in Orchard Park on Monday calls for a high of 16 degrees and a low of 13, with winds from 10 to 20 mph. Snow showers are expected in the morning but there's only around a 9% chance of precipitation at kickoff time.\n\"I'm not saying it's going to be pleasant, but conditions won't be life threatening either,\" Hochul said, via\nESPN.",

    "text": "David Rocha, sobre sus jugadores: \"Voy con ellos al fin del mundo, a la guerra\"\nTiempo de lectura:1Actualizado09:48\nEl Mérida sigue lanzado. Desde que le ganara 0-1 al Real Madrid en Valdebebas, el 11 de febrero, ha ganado, contando con ese envite, cuatro de los últimos cinco partidos, con un bagaje de 13 de 15 puntos. Además, la racha se prolonga hasta los siete partidos sin perder.\nAtrás quedan los tiempos de zozobra, en los que el descenso acechaba y parecía que no había punto de retorno. Aún se recuerdan aquellas palabras del técnico David Rocha en las que decía que el equipo no competía.\nTodo ha cambiado, hasta el punto de que la inercia positiva te lleva a ganar un partido, el de este domingo, por 0-1 en San Fernando, con un gol de Chuma en el minuto 92 y con el portero Palomares como protagonista.\nChuma, en los micrófonos de COPE: “Somos un equipo que tenemos que sufrir, todos juntos, estamos en la línea de conseguir los objetivos que nos propongamos. Ahora tenemos la moneda de cara”.\nUn exultante David Rocha daba las claves de la resurrección del Mérida: “El equipo se agarra, sabe sufrir, no deja de creer, no se viene abajo”, para alabar a sus jugadores: “Voy con ellos al fin del mundo, a la guerra, con nuestros errores y nuestras virtudes”.\nPor cierto, el club ha dado en la tecla con un eslogan, un hashtag, que siguen todos los estamentos: “Hay que creer”.\n- item no encontrado\n- item no encontrado",

    "text": "KARACHI: The demand for high speed diesel (HSD) fell 11 percent in December from the previous month, as foggy weather disrupted the transport of heavy vehicles across the country, data from the oil sector showed on Thursday.\nThe HSD consumption also declined after the sowing season for Rabi crops, which require more diesel for irrigation, ended in December.\nAccording to the oil consumption statistics of the oil sector provided to The News here on Thursday, the demand for HSD dropped by eleven percent in the country in the month of December compared to November this year.\nThe HSD consumption stood below 400,000 tonnes in the month compared to November when it was around 450,000 tonnes.\nHowever, the demand for HSD was on the higher side in the current month compared to the same month of last year. The oil sector attributed the increase in the consumption of HSD to the cut in its price in the last two successive reviews of prices, which encouraged the consumption of Pakistani diesel compared to Iranian smuggled diesel.\nOn the other hand, the consumption of petrol increased in the current month compared to the month of November this year. The petrol consumption increased by ten percent as the country consumed 425,000 tonnes of petrol in the month compared to 385,000 tonnes in the month of November this year.\nIndustry officials said the consumption of petrol rose because of the substantial reduction in the price of petrol in the last two successive reviews of petrol prices.\n\"The petrol price, which moved up to Rs331 per litre a few months back, has dropped to Rs268 per litre in the last review of the price,\" an offcial said. \"The decreasing price of petrol has increased its consumption in the country.\"\nThe sale of furnace oil has dropped massively by 33 percent in the month of December this fiscal year compared to the previous month, as power plants are not consuming it for power generation after the country witnessed low demand for electricity due to the winter season in the country.\nThe country has presently 453,000 tonnes of petrol stock, which is sufficient for 22 days, whereas there are 509,000 tonnes of HSD in the country, which are sufficient for 27 days. The country has a huge stock of 429,000 tonnes of fuel oil, which according to the oil sector is sufficient for 240 days. .\nBig investors have spent much of 2023 trying to belatedly jump on a stock market rally that few saw coming, or nursing...\nLAHORE: The country faces a deadlock on key national issues such as water management and fiscal federalism, as...\nLondon/Frankfurt/Washington: Central bankers are rethinking their approach to economic forecasting after their...\nKARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan has introduced a new scheme to facilitate exports by allowing the import of input...\nKARACHI: The Pakistan Business Council , an advocacy forum of leading private sector businesses, called for lower...\nISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority has issued separate supplier licences to seven state-run...",

    "title": "NASA’s Future at Risk: Concerns Over Trump’s Ties to Elon Musk and SpaceX",
    "text": "NASA ‘s Future at Risk Amid Trump and Musk Alliance\nNASA faces significant threats as President-elect Donald Trump strengthens ties with Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX. Musk, in his role as head of the Office of Government Efficiency, promises to cut national spending by $2 trillion. This includes reviewing contracts linked to his own company, SpaceX.\nConcerns arise that NASA might shift from being a national pride to serving Musk’s interests. Peter Juul, a director at the Progressive Policy Institute, warns that the conflict of interest could result in taxpayer money benefiting private companies like SpaceX at NASA’s expense. He claims that if Trump and Musk get their way, NASA may function as a contractor for Musk rather than an independent agency.\nWhile SpaceX aims to develop its Starship rocket for Mars missions, Juul criticizes the company’s ambitions as premature. He says SpaceX needs extensive testing to prepare for even basic missions, indicating that the company lacks the technical capability for complex space endeavors.\nJuul also points out that Musk’s controversial connections and actions could tarnish NASA’s image. His ties to figures like Russian President Vladimir Putin, along with his polarizing political views and harassment allegations, could negatively impact NASA’s integrity.\nJuul emphasizes that the U.S. Congress can protect NASA from potential harms. He believes Congress should ensure NASA operates independently and does not cater solely to a single business’s interests.\nHe suggests strengthening NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) program, which offers technical advantages over other national or private entities despite facing criticism over delays and costs. Juul also advocates for the dual-source contracting policy, promoting competition among companies instead of favoring SpaceX.\nDespite challenges, he insists that protecting NASA’s interests is critical. As the previous administration dismissed scientific evidence, safeguarding NASA’s mission and research is now more vital than ever. Congress must actively support NASA, preserving its focus on space exploration and scientific research, free from private profit motives.\nThis article is by Dita Aliccia Armadani, an intern in the Certified Internship Program at detikcom.",

    "text": "La imitadora y humorista Fátima Florez comenzó un nuevo espectáculo en Carlos Paz por la temporada de verano y se refirió al contacto con sus ex parejas, entre ellas el presidente Javier Milei y no le cerró la puerta a volver con el mandatario.\nLa actriz protagoniza \"100 por ciento Fátima\" junto a Marcelo Polino y allí hace despliegue de su talento con múltiples imitaciones, algunas que generaron polémica cómo Yuyito González, actual pareja del jefe de Estado.\nEn ese contexto Fátima Florez brindó una nota a Infobae y allí se refirió a varios temas cómo su presente en Córdoba pero también habló sobre sus ex. \"Yo no soy de esas personas contundentes que dicen nunca más\", expresó en relación a la posibilidad de volver con una ex pareja.\nEn esa línea, la ex de Javier Milei agregó: \"soy la mejor ex del mundo. Con mis dos ex soy la mejor porque soy muy respetuosa. Me quedo con lo lindo, respeto y atesoro el tiempo que pasamos juntos. Nunca me van a escuchar hablando pavadas ni cosas feas. Eso hablaría muy mal de mí\".\nSiguiendo con ese tema, le consultaron son si tuvo algún contacto en el último tiempo. \"Eso es algo que prefiero guardar para mí. No me gusta andar ventilando todo porque, si no, se transforma en un ventilador de intimidades. Y aunque soy una mujer mediática, tengo tremendos códigos\".\n\"De la intimidad no se habla. Por eso mis ex me quieren: porque soy buena gente. A nadie le gusta separarse, las dos partes sufren. Pero lo importante es mantener una buena relación con los ex. Eso es lo más sano, lo más lindo: cuidar y atesorar lo que fue alguna vez, lo que vivimos juntos\", agregó Fátima Florez.\nYanina Latorre no tuvo piedad con Yuyito González: \"Ahora entiendo\"\nLa ex vedette y conductora Amalia \"Yuyito\" González vive un presente muy particular ya que desde muchos lugares ponen en duda su relación con el presidente Javier Milei y si bien la propia \"primera dama\" se encargó de desmentirlo, se reveló una situación relacionada al viaje del mandatario a la asunción de Donald Trump que mostraría el mal momento de la pareja.\nEn ese sentido, la periodista Yanina Latorre, quién tuvo varios cruces muy picantes contra Yuyito, puso el foco en el viaje de la conductora a los Estados Unidos y dio un detalle muy particular sobre su estadía. \"¿A Yuyito no la llevo Milei a Washington, no? Ahora entiendo porqué pedía canjelosis yuyo. Decía reuniones protocolares.....jajaja\", agregó la esposa de Diego Latorre también por las redes sociales.\nClaramente la periodista subrayó que pese a que Yuyito González afirmó que iba a estar con el presidente Javier Milei en la asunción de Donald Trump, el mandatario asistió junto a su hermana Karina Milei y la conductora terminó en Miami donde también está la panelista de LAM.",
