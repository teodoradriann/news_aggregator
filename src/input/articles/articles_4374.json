    "text": "IT之家 4 月 3 日消息，市场调查机构 Counterpoint Research 昨日（4 月 2 日）发布报告，预测比亚迪（BYD）将在 2025 年以 15.7% 的全球市场份额超越特斯拉，成为全球纯电动车（BEV）销量冠军。\n该机构认为得益于其技术领先地位与垂直整合生产模式，同时受惠于中国政府的强力政策支持，比亚迪将会在今年取得这一里程碑。\n比亚迪近期推出的超快充系统突破行业极限：采用 1000V 高压架构减少能量损耗，搭配 10C 充电倍率电池实现 5 分钟续航 400 公里，碳化硅（SiC）功率芯片提升充电效率，自研刀片电池兼顾安全性与快充性能。\nCounterpoint 分析师 Abhik Mukherjee 指出，该系统充电速度远超特斯拉 Supercharger（10 分钟充 275 公里），有望缓解消费者续航焦虑，推动电动车普及。\n而另一方面，特斯拉正面临声誉危机、地缘政治风险及主力市场销量下滑三重压力，2025 年一季度销售数据已显疲软。Counterpoint 副总监 Liz Lee 认为，特斯拉“自食其果”，而比亚迪若能兑现超快充技术承诺，或将成为中国电动车全球化的转折点。",

    "text": "TV Chris Harrison says he's 'grateful' he left The Bachelor: 'It wasn’t healthy' \"I knew I had to remove myself from what became a very toxic situation.\" By Emlyn Travis Emlyn Travis Emlyn Travis is a news writer at Entertainment Weekly with over five years of experience covering the latest in entertainment. A proud Kingston University alum, Emlyn has written about music, fandom, film, television, and awards for multiple outlets including MTV News, Teen Vogue, Bustle, BuzzFeed, Paper Magazine, Dazed, and NME. She joined EW in August 2022. EW's editorial guidelines Published on December 28, 2023 Former Bachelor host Chris Harrison is glad that he exited the franchise back in 2021. The reality star, who hosted the dating competition for 19 years, departed the series after sparking heavy backlash when he defended Bachelor season 25 contestant Rachael Kirkconnell for attending a \"plantation-themed\" sorority party in college. On a recent episode of Bachelor Nation alum Jason Tartick’s Trading Secrets podcast, Harrison described the entire experience as a “very toxic situation.” “What I went through was tumultuous. I don’t wish it on anybody. It was horrifying on a lot of levels — and something that I pray to God my worst enemy never goes through,” he explained. “But, with that said, I knew I had to remove myself from what became a very toxic situation.” Chris Harrison. John Fleenor via Getty Images Harrison issued multiple apologies and took a temporary hiatus from the series in the aftermath of the interview. While he expressed hope about potentially returning to the franchise, he ultimately left and was later replaced by Jesse Palmer. While speaking on Tartick’s podcast, Harrison called the controversy a “difficult situation,” but noted that he “probably could have figured it out.” “We all could have figured it out, but I had to remove myself from that toxic situation. And so I'm proud of that decision,” he said. “I’m proud that I handled it the way I did and I still look at [the show] as a blessing because it changed my life on so many levels. Financially, of course. It changed my life. It changed my kids' lives.” Harrison went on to further praise the show for all of the friends and adventures that it gave him over the years. “I hold those things dear. It was a blessing. It changed my life, but at the same time I can also be grateful that I’m gone,” he said. “That’s a relationship I don’t need to be in anymore because it wasn’t healthy.” He also swiftly denied any chance of returning to the series in the future and suggested that it has started “going downhill” following his departure. “Once I left, people started taking their shots at the champ and they’ve succeeded and now there’s competition and now there’s shows [that] are in the zeitgeist, they’re being talked about, they’re getting press that we used to get,” he said. “Again, it’s hard to survive when when you don’t have those eyeballs anymore, because people will talk about another show.” Harrison also admitted he wasn't quite prepared to leave when he did. “I had to mourn the loss of something that I didn't intend to exit then. I would have probably soon, but not then, like that,\" he said. \"And so there was mourning a loss there and I had to realize, like when I left my marriage, take your time and don't just jump back into the next relationship. That's not the bandaid that's gonna heal that wound.\" He continued, \"I did have some immediate offers to get right back into the game... [but] I realized, pump your brakes man. Take some time. I wanted to make sure my family was good. I'll be honest: I found love because of that. I had time to find love with [my wife] Lauren. I really enjoyed falling in love and I really enjoyed that journey. And I gave myself time to let that breathe. I think it's probably the reason we're married.\" Listen to Harrison discuss The Bachelor with Tartick in the podcast above.Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.

Gli azzurri, a Bergamo, hanno messo l'anima in campo, caricati dal loro allenatore e da una tifoseria che non ha eguali. In tantissimi hanno scortato la squadra in aeroporto e poi l'hanno riaccolta, sabato notte, al rientro in città\" ha sottolineato il noto giornalista ed opinionista.\n\"Splendide le immagini che si sono viste nel post-gara e che hanno accompagnato le ore successive alla vittoria contro la squadra di Gian Piero Gasperino.

    "title": "Andrew Wiggins emerges as Miami Heat's shining star amid Jimmy Butler's absence while leading the charge towards a playoff push and a $96M future",
    "text": "Challenging Times and a Promising Spark\nMiami Heat have faced significant struggles following Jimmy Butler’s departure, leading to one of the franchise’s most testing periods in years. Amid this turbulence, Andrew Wiggins has quickly emerged as a key contributor. Adjusting to a new team and system after a championship run with his previous organization, the 30-year-old former top overall pick has rapidly integrated into the Heat’s lineup.\nRapid Integration and On-Court Impact\nWiggins’ performance in his initial games with the team has been notable. Missing one game due to a leg contusion and listed as questionable for another, his presence remains impactful as he adapts to new teammates and strategies. In his first 10 games with Miami, his scoring numbers have rivaled those of well-known figures during their early days with the franchise. His consistent output—exceeding 19 points in most outings—demonstrates both his skill and his ability to quickly find an offensive rhythm in challenging circumstances.\nBalancing Veteran Talent with Evolving Roles\nThe Heat are working to rebuild a balanced lineup during a season marked by inconsistency. While veteran playmakers have traditionally formed the cornerstone of championship teams, recent shifts in personnel have accelerated the need for reliable scoring options. As other team members work toward finding their offensive groove, Wiggins has stepped into a larger scoring role. Alongside rising stars and established players, his contributions are seen as essential in fostering a more dynamic and cohesive offensive unit.\nLooking Toward a Promising Future\nWith key players set for another season under long-term contracts, the focus remains on assembling a trio capable of propelling the team back into playoff contention. The combined talent of Wiggins, an emerging scorer with consistent performances, his teammates who have weathered recent struggles, and other evolving roles on the roster is critical to the team’s future. The goal is to solidify a lineup that can consistently compete in the Eastern Conference, blending immediate impact with long-term financial and strategic stability.",
