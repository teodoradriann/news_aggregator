    "text": "Frito-Lay recalls some Lay's chips over \"life-threatening\" allergy risk Anne Marie Lee Updated Thu, December 19, 2024 at 11:23 PM UTC 1 min read\nFrito-Lay is recalling a limited number of 13 oz. bags of Lay's Classic Potato Chips, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration citing the risk that some consumers could experience a \"life-theatening allergic reaction\" due to an undeclared allergen.\nThe FDA said it had been alerted by a consumer that the product might contain undeclared milk. The bags of chips affected by recall were distributed to some retail stores and e-commerce distributors in Oregon and Washington, and were available for sale beginning Nov. 3, 2024.\n\"Those with an allergy or severe sensitivity to milk run the risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume the recalled product,\" the FDA said in the recall notice posted Thursday.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement No allergic reactions related to the recall have been reported, according to the notice. Additionally, no other Lay's products, flavors, sizes or variety packs are affected.\nFrito-Lay is recalling a limited number of 13 oz. bags of Lay's Classic Potato Chips after being alerted by a consumer contact that the product may contain undeclared milk. / Credit: FDA The recalled chips include Lay's Classic Potato Chips, in flexible 13 oz. (368.5 grams) bags with UPC code 28400 31041, a \"Guaranteed Fresh\" date of 11 Feb 2025, and one of either two manufacturing codes: 6462307xx or 6463307xx.\nGeneral guidelines from the FDA advise consumers who have purchased any recalled food to dispose of the product or return it to the retailer for a full refund.\nIn a similar event, Costco in October recalled nearly 80,000 pounds of store-brand butter because the key ingredient, milk, was missing from the product's label.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Eye Opener: New details emerge in WI school shooting\nTeen shooter connected to man accused of plotting separate attack\n2 Republicans voted to release Ethics Committee's report on Matt Gaetz misconduct, sources say\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 20,000 people played the daily Crossword recently.

    "text": "Heat index values up to 109 are possible in Central & North Texas. A Heat Advisory is in effect for Milam County through 8 pm Friday. EL PASO, Texas — Five years ago this Saturday, a man with white nationalist beliefs traveled across Texas to a Walmart in El Paso, with a semiautomatic rifle in tow, with the intent of targeting Hispanic people. He killed 23 people and injured nearly another two dozen. A manifesto he had shared touted white supremacist claims of a \"replacement\" and a \"Hispanic invasion.\" At the time, many had tied his rhetoric to that of former President Donald Trump, but the idea of an \"invasion\" has pervaded ever since, including among Texas leaders. At the top, Governor Greg Abbott has repeatedly labeled the crisis at the southern border as an invasion, including quite literally declaring an invasion in 2022. \"The federal government’s failure has forced me to invoke Article I, 10, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution, thereby enabling the State of Texas to protect its own territory against invasion by the Mexican drug cartels,\" Governor Abbott wrote in a letter to the Biden Administration in 2022. In its case against U.S. Attorneys over the implementation of Senate Bill 4, which gives Texas the authority to detain people based on their immigration status, the Texas Attorney General's office cited the argument of an invasion as justification for the law. Earlier this year, a federal judge pushed back on that claim of an invasion, granting an injunction against the implementation of SB 4. [ALSO| Human rights groups worry campaign rhetoric could lead to repeat of El Paso mass shooting](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/human-rights-groups-worry-campaign-rhetoric-could-lead-to-repeat-of-el-paso-mass-shooting) \"[S]urges in unauthorized immigration alone do not qualify as an 'invasion' as described in the Constitution,\" Judge David Ezra wrote in his opinion. \"In recent months, members of Congress have parroted debunked claims of widespread voter fraud by unauthorized immigrants,\" Elizabeth Yates, a researcher with Human Rights First, said in a media call on Thursday. \"In just one example last week, Speaker Johnson said on the border that he and other members of Congress were, quote, concerned that a migrant invasion threatened our elections.\" Immigration has become one of the center focal points ahead of November's election, particularly with the presumed nomination of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. Republicans have already pinned much of the Biden Administration's handling of the border on her role. \"Texas and the politics of the border have really driven a significant portion of the national conversation, whether it's about the buoys in the Rio Grande or whether it's about Greg Abbott busing migrants to other places,\" Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston, said. \"It's become a real centerpiece of the conversation, how things go here will definitely play out nationally.\"",

    "text": "SAVANNAH, Ga. — WJCL's partner Tormenta FC proudly supports the United Soccer League's (USL) groundbreaking decision to implement a promotion and relegation system, a move that transforms the landscape of American soccer. With the approval of a supermajority of USL owners, this shift introduces a three-tier system where clubs rise or fall based on seasonal performance, aligning U.S. soccer with top global leagues.\n“We’re thrilled to be at the forefront of this transformative moment,” said Darin Van Tassell, Owner and President of Tormenta FC. “The USL’s decision opens new horizons for clubs like ours, showing that with dedication, teams from smaller markets can reach the pinnacle of the sport.”\nAdvertisement Founded in 2015, Tormenta FC has already made a name for itself with championships in the USL W League and USL League One in 2022.\nThe decision aligns the USL with top international leagues like the English Premier League, La Liga, and the Bundesliga, where promotion and relegation add stakes to every match and fuel fan engagement. The shift is part of a broader vision to enhance competition and foster long-term growth for soccer in the U.S.\n\"A new chapter in American soccer begins,\" said Alec Papadakis, CEO of the USL. \"This bold direction highlights our commitment to not only providing top-tier competition but also strengthening community engagement. Now, more communities across America can aspire to compete at the highest level.\"\nAs part of this transformation, the USL announced plans to launch a new Division One league in 2027-28, which will sit atop the newly restructured system. Currently, the USL Championship (Division Two) and USL League One (Division Three) lay the foundation for this new framework. With all three leagues interconnected through promotion and relegation, the USL aims to create a more dynamic and competitive environment for clubs, players, and fans.\n\"This is a transformative moment for American soccer,\" said Paul McDonough, USL President and Chief Soccer Officer. \"With international events like the 2026 World Cup on the horizon, the time is right to create a sustainable future for the sport. Fans want high-stakes competition, where every match matters, and this system delivers that excitement.\"",
