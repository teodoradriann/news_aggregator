    "text": "In a groundbreaking development in the field of particle physics, researchers working on the AEgIS experiment at CERN’s Antimatter Factory have unveiled an unprecedented optical anti-matter imager. This revolutionary imaging technology, which utilizes 60 photo sensors scavenged from commercial smartphone cameras, is expected to dramatically enhance our ability to observe and analyze antimatter interactions, particularly focusing on the behavior of antihydrogen in gravitational fields. By achieving spatial resolutions lower than 1 micrometer, the device promises to unveil the minute effects of gravity on antihydrogen, offering insights into longstanding mysteries in physics.\nThe mission of the AEgIS team is to measure the free-fall of antihydrogen under Earth’s gravity, employing a unique horizontal beam approach. Previous studies in this domain had yielded intriguing theoretical predictions, yet the technical challenges of realizing such experiments had hindered substantial progress. The AEgIS collaboration, comprising a diverse array of researchers and facilities, has now established a novel method to directly track antihydrogen’s responses to gravitational forces through advanced detector technology.\nFrancesco Guatieri, a key figure from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and Principal Investigator for the project, has expressed his enthusiasm about the advancements made possible with this technology. “The Optical Photon and Antimatter Imager (OPHANIM) is a significant leap forward in our capabilities. By integrating 60 mobile phone sensors into a single unit, we’ve achieved an impressive pixel count of 3840 million, surpassing traditional photographic plate resolutions,\" he states. This innovative detector not only brings real-time capabilities to the table but also outstrips previous solutions in terms of particle detection efficiency and resolution.\nHistorically, the reliance on photographic plates in experiments has been a significant limitation. While these plates provided decent resolution, their inability to deliver real-time data collection rendered them inadequate for modern experimental needs. The development of OPHANIM marks a turning point, bringing together the benefits of photographic plate resolution and the immediacy and self-calibration features of electronic detectors. As Guatieri emphasizes, this technology aligns with the demanding requirements of modern physics experiments, particularly those dealing with rapid and unpredictable antimatter behaviors.\nOne of the noteworthy aspects of the device’s functionality is its capacity to analyze low-energy positrons—subatomic particles with the same mass as electrons but with a positive charge. Researchers previously revealed that optical image sensors could successfully image these particles in real time. Despite the high complexity involved in adapting smartphone technology for scientific endeavors, including stripping away protective layers designed for consumer electronics, the team succeeded through meticulous engineering efforts.\nThis endeavor involved significant contributions from master’s students at TUM’s School of Engineering and Design, notably Michael Berghold and Markus Münster, who played pivotal roles in refining the technology. Their work underscored the critical nature of hands-on experimentation and innovation in advancing scientific research, particularly in an era where interdisciplinary collaborations between engineering and physics are essential to break new ground in our understanding of the universe.\nThe ramifications of the OPHANIM technology extend beyond the immediate goals of measuring antihydrogen and could revolutionize various areas of experimental physics. Dr. Ruggero Caravita, AEgIS spokesperson, has highlighted the technology’s transformative potential, stating that the extraordinary resolution achieved allows for the distinction between different annihilation fragments. This represents a significant advancement in our understanding of low-energy antiparticle annihilation, opening up new avenues for research and discovery.\nThe implications of such advancements are not solely confined to the realm of antimatter; many scientific investigations could benefit from improved position resolution and real-time diagnostic capabilities. In particular, experiments necessitating meticulous tracking of particles could leverage this technology, expediting the discovery processes across a multitude of fields in particle physics and beyond.\nAs these experiments progress, the research team hopes to unveil more about the fundamental behavior of matter and antimatter under various circumstances, including the influence of gravity. By examining how antihydrogen interacts with gravitational fields, scientists aim to address profound questions regarding the symmetry between matter and antimatter, an inquiry that has perplexed physicists since the inception of modern physics.\nThe journey of translating mobile technology into a robust experimental tool speaks volumes about innovation’s role in modern scientific inquiry. As researchers continue to refine this hybrid technology, the hope is that it will not only yield groundbreaking findings in the context of antihydrogen but also inspire further explorations into the quantum realm where gravity’s effects on antimatter could illuminate pathways toward understanding the cosmos better.\nIn conclusion, the development of the Optical Photon and Antimatter Imager represents a milestone in our quest to unveil the mysteries of antimatter. As researchers persevere in unraveling the intricacies of antihydrogen free-fall, the OPHANIM technology stands poised to potentially reshape our understanding of fundamental forces in nature and catalyze a new era of discovery in particle physics.\nSubject of Research :\nArticle Title : Real-time antiproton annihilation vertexing with sub-micron resolution\nNews Publication Date : 2-Apr-2025\nWeb References : AEgIS Experiment – CERN\nReferences : AlphA Experiment , GBAR Experiment\nImage Credits : Andreas Heddergott / TUM\nKeywords Antimatter, AEgIS, antihydrogen, optical imaging, particle physics, smartphone sensors, CERN, gravity.",

Sign in with Google Continue with Facebook Login using other methods Russell Wilson entered his second season with the Broncos, expecting to turn it around after a forgettable 2022 season. It was a slow start for Wilson but turned a corner in the second half of this season. However, head coach Sean Payton made the move to bench the 35-year-old quarterback with two games remaining.\nThis decision did not sit well with Emmanuel Acho of the Fox Sports 1 show \"Speak\". Acho laid fault with the Broncos for a lackluster season and credited Wilson for doing his end of the deal:\n“Russell Wilson was benched and I believe that he is taking too much heat... Russell Wilson gave the Denver Broncos Super Bowl Russ but the Denver Broncos did not give Russell Wilson a Super Bowl environment.\" •\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now \"First, I will start with the numbers though the numbers don't tell the whole story, look at 2013, Russell won the Super Bowl then look at this year…Russ in 2013 is the same Russ that you are seeing this year, the dilemma is you're not seeing that Super Bowl defense.\" Expand Tweet Acho concluded:\n\"Now I get it that the Legion of Boom was generational, but can you give me the 2015 Broncos defense? Russ fulfilled his end of the bargain, what I would submit to you is that the Denver Broncos did not fulfill their end of the bargain.” The Denver Broncos (7-8) started the season with a 3-5 record, then won three straight before dropping three of their last four games. A reason for the nine-time Pro Bowler's benching is equally financial and preventative.\nWilson has an injury guarantee of $37 million for 2025 that would kick in should any kind of injury happen over the last two weeks that would stop him from passing a physical next March. He inked a five-year extension with Denver worth $242.5 million last September. In hindsight, some are noting that it is one of the worst contracts in recent memory.",

    "text": "PETALING JAYA: Expect a major revamp in the Johor Darul Ta’zim (JDT) squad next year.\nThis is following a shocking move by JDT to let go their coach Esteban Solari and several players under their payroll due to their financial restructuring exercise.\nAnd with the changes, JDT owner Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim has even declared that the Southern Tigers will be the underdog next season.\nJDT had been untouchable over the last two seasons, having won all the domestic titles – Malaysian Open, Super League, FA Cup and Charity Shield.\nThis season, the team under Solari won the Super League title without even dropping a match, and scoring more than 100 goals.\nBesides the reputable Solari, the club also announced that they would not keep their stalwarts like centreback Aidil Zafuan Abdul Radzak, wingback S. Kunanlan, midfielder Leandro Velasquez, striker Ahmad Hazwan Bakri and centreback Adam Nor Azlin.\nJDT also stated that wingback Oscar Arribas, striker Syafiq Ahmad, wingers Safawi Rasid and Akhyar Rashid and goalkeeper Haziq Nadzli will be leaving the club on loan.\nSafawi and Akhyar could be moving to Terengganu on loan, while Syafiq is being linked to Kedah.\nHaziq could be moving to Perak together with Adam.\nWith that latest development, the Johor crown prince decided to underplay their prospect next season.\n“We will be underdog next year. There will be more leaving the club. It’s a process to save money,” said Tunku Ismail.\n“The stadium is rarely full. The open ticket is only RM10. Whatever it is, please pray for the best for the club. Thanks to those who continuously supported us,” he posted on the club’s Instagram account.\nSo far, the only confirmed arrival is Argentinian-Syrian midfielder Jalil Elias. It is learnt that the club could also wrap up deals for newly naturalised attacking midfielder Romel Morales and rightback Azam Azmi Murad.\nTwo days ago, the club’s chief executive officer Alistair Edwards revealed that a restructuring exercise would be done to ensure sustainability.\nPlus, with a longer 2024-2025 M-League season, which would take 12 months to complete, it is understandable why the club had made such drastic move.\n“Having spent a considerable amount of money on our football project including football infrastructure over the past six to seven years, JDT need to structure our finances to ensure sustainability,” said Edwards.\n“The club have decided to reduce spending by 30-40% to enable this process. We will not be spending money. We will be reducing in terms of our expenditure.\n“The Southern Tigers will be undergoing a squad transformation that will see several changes in personnel ahead of the 2024 and 2025 seasons.”\nOpen Modal ×",

    "text": "State power utility Eskom has reached 100 days without implementing load shedding for the first time since 2020.\n“Considering the Intensity and the levels of load shedding in 2023, the ability to get to 100 days without load shedding is significant, while acknowledging that the risk of load shedding still exists.\n“The 100 days milestone includes around a – R6.2 billion reduction in OCT [Open cycle gas turbines] diesel expenditure from 1 April 2024 to 30 June 2024, compared to the same period last year and if we maintain our trajectory on reduced diesel spend, it will be a strong driver in a possible return to profit in FY25,” Eskom’s Group Chief Executive Dan Marokane said.\nThe power utility’s Head of Generation, Bheki Nxumalo, highlighted that the 100 days is a result of the “tireless efforts” of those working to keep the lights on at the power utility.\n“The achievement of 100 continuous days without load shedding is the outcome of diligent execution of recovery plans and the tireless efforts of our 40 000 dedicated and skilled Eskom employees.\n“If we maintain a 70% Energy Availability Factor (EAF) and add significant capacity within the country we can ensure adequate available capacity to meet demand without a significant risk of load shedding,” Nxumalo said.\nTargeted initiatives\nEskom explained that the current upward trajectory stems from, amongst others, a “multi-dimensional Generation Operational Recovery Plan…and aggressive planned maintenance”.\nThe utility explained that these initiatives have led to a reduction in unplanned outages at power stations from some 18 000MW to an average of 12 000MW – marking an improvement of 6000MW since May 2023.\n“This has contributed to a sustained improvement in the EAF, which has increased from 54.56% at the end of FY23/24 to a year-to-date achievement of 61.50%, an increase of 6.94% over the past three months.\n“Our immediate focus remains on implementing the Generation Operational Recovery Plan, aiming to recover about 1600MW from the generation coal fleet following the successful commercial operation of Kusile Unit 5 and 930MW from Koeberg Unit 2 before the end of the calendar year. This will significantly improve the EAF by the end of March 2025,” the power utility said.\nEskom thanked government and the National Energy Crisis Committee (NECOM), and other stakeholders for their collaborative efforts, which have enabled the successful execution of its plans.\n“We will persist in implementing the operational recovery plan, strengthening governance, and future-proofing the organisation to ensure energy security, growth, and long-term sustainability for the benefit of South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.\n“We remain committed to improving the current business while laying the groundwork for future opportunities and initiatives. We will continue to seize every opportunity presented by industry changes for the benefit of all our stakeholders.\n“The pace of change is rapid, and we are prepared to deliver on the future through improved implementation and disciplined execution,” Eskom concluded. – SAnews.gov.za",
