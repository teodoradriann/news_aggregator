    "title": "Maltempo addio, arriva la lunga Ottobrata: sole su gran parte dell’Italia. Le previsioni meteo",
    "text": "Decisa rimonta dell'alta pressione sulla Penisola, con giornate soleggiate e temperature miti che potrebbero protrarsi per diverse settimane Dopo un inizio di ottobre caratterizzato da maltempo, piogge intense e allerte meteo, il clima sta finalmente per cambiare, portando una lunga fase di bel tempo su tutta la Penisola. L'atteso ritorno dell'alta pressione darà vita a una classica \"Ottobrata\", con giornate soleggiate e temperature miti che potrebbero protrarsi per diverse settimane. Il maltempo che ha segnato i primi dieci giorni del mese sta per lasciare spazio a condizioni di stabilità atmosferica, grazie a un rinforzo dell'alta pressione che proteggerà il Mediterraneo centrale. Questo cambiamento meteo inizierà già a partire da venerdì, quando un promontorio anticiclonico andrà a consolidarsi sull'Italia, garantendo un clima più stabile e soleggiato. Il flusso atlantico, che aveva portato piogge e allagamenti, scorrerà ora sull'Europa centro-settentrionale, lasciando la Penisola in una situazione di bel tempo. Prevalenza di sole, ma con alcune eccezioni Nel weekend, l'alta pressione regalerà giornate prevalentemente soleggiate, con qualche eccezione. Le regioni settentrionali saranno parzialmente esposte al passaggio di fronti nuvolosi che sfioreranno il Nord Italia, portando addensamenti irregolari e locali fenomeni, soprattutto sulle zone alpine e in Liguria. Al Centro e al Sud, invece, il tempo sarà stabile e sereno, con solo qualche velatura e foschie mattutine, in rapido dissolvimento. Temperature miti e atmosfera tipicamente autunnale Le temperature si manterranno su valori piacevoli, superiori alla media del periodo in molte città. Al Sud e sulle isole maggiori si potranno registrare massime fino a 28°C in Sardegna e Sicilia, con valori di 24-26°C nelle principali città del Centro-Sud come Roma e Napoli. Anche al Nord, dove le massime saranno intorno ai 20-22°C, il clima sarà gradevole. Si tratterà di un graduale ritorno alle tipiche giornate di ottobre, quando il sole risplende sul foliage autunnale, regalando scenari suggestivi. Possibile lunga fase di bel tempo Secondo le ultime previsioni, la fase anticiclonica potrebbe persistere per gran parte del mese, regalando all'Italia una lunga Ottobrata che potrebbe estendersi fino alla fine di ottobre. Eventuali interruzioni del bel tempo sono previste solo in corrispondenza di due veloci passaggi perturbati, il 18 e il 25 ottobre, che potrebbero portare qualche pioggia soprattutto al Nord. Tuttavia, l'alta pressione dovrebbe rimanere il principale attore atmosferico, garantendo prevalenza di sole e temperature miti. Previsioni meteo per il weekend Sabato 12 Nord: annuali irregolari al Nord-Ovest con qualche pioggia sulle Alpi (Valle d'Aosta settentrionale e Verbano) e piovaschi sul Genovese. Maggiori schiarite sull'Emilia orientale e la Romagna. Centro: in prevalenza soleggiato, con qualche addensamento sull'alta Toscana. Possibili foschie mattutine sulle conche umbre, in dissolvimento. Sud e Isole: prevalentemente soleggiato, con nubi innocue lungo le coste tirreniche. Domenica 13 Nord: sole offuscato da nubi alte e stratificate, con addensamenti più compatti al mattino sui confini valdostani e sul Levante Ligure. Possibili piovaschi in esaurimento verso sera. Centro: tempo stabile e soleggiato, con velature di passaggio e maggiori addensamenti sull'alta Toscana, senza precipitazioni. Sud e Isole: giornata stabile e soleggiata, con qualche nube innocua lungo le coste tirreniche. Temperature in lieve aumento. TiscaliNews in collaborazione con 3bMeteo.com",

    "text": "Free Software Cannot Rely on Politicians, They Don't Even Care About Software, They Only or Mostly Care About Money\nSoftware Freedom is nice and all, but trying to explain this to politicians ([there's no \"elevator talk\"](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-discuss/2025-01/msg00003.html) unless you buy 'dinner' with them) is very hard because they're looking for the smell of money, not sense. Yes, of course there are exceptions, but exceptions do not make up majorities.\nThere's a discussion this week involving Jean Louis and Akira Urushibata [[1](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-discuss/2025-01/msg00002.html), [ 2](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-discuss/2025-01/msg00004.html)] and it's partly about explaining Software Freedom. Jean Louis has just told Akira Urushibata:\nI disagree with that viewpoint. Firstly, advocating for free software is equivalent to standing up for human rights in the present and future. It's not a matter of religious belief, but a reasonable and factual reflection of our society, where programmers and companies often try to control the user and their computing, rather than the user controlling their own computing.I disagree that \"free of cost\" is the primary draw for free software. I have never seen it that way, but perhaps statistics could provide insight. To me, the appeal of free software is the wide variety of options that aren't available on other systems, and the ideal development environment that can't be found on Windows/OS. However, I haven't used Windoze in 25 years, so I can't speak to its current state.\nOf course he sort of preached to the choir at libreplanet-discuss\n, where no politicians or non-techs (barely any) are present. There's no simple solution to this situation short of revolutionising the political system. In 11 days from now the US Government will become 100% about bribes and graft. [█](#top)",

    "text": "«Sostenere il nuovo popolo di anziani, composto di milioni di persone» e rivitalizzare il rapporto tra Chiesa e terza-quarta età. È l'obiettivo che si pone la Fondazione Età Grande, promossa da monsignor Vincenzo Paglia, presidente della Pontificia Accademia per la Vita, che ieri ha presentato l'indagine svolta da Ipsos dal titolo «La pastorale della terza età nelle diocesi italiane», una fotografia dell'impegno delle diocesi verso gli anziani, tra grandi sfide e successi.\nMonsignor Paglia, che tra le altre cose presiede la commissione governativa per la riforma dell'assistenza agli anziani, plaude alle iniziative politiche in tal senso. «Salutiamo con soddisfazione la legge 33 del Governo Italiano sulla riforma dell'assistenza della popolazione anziana in Italia. Nei prossimi giorni sottolinea - inizieranno le prime sperimentazioni per una Assistenza Domiciliare, Socio-sanitaria, Integrata e Continuativa che si iscrive in quel continuum assistenziale che assicura la vicinanza a tutti gli anziani».\nUna misura legislativa, spiega monsignor Paglia che da anni si batte per la valorizzazione degli anziani come risorsa per la società - «richiede però un cambio di cultura che riguardi il senso stesso della vecchiaia che è tuttora concepita anche dagli stessi anziani come una età di scarto. È urgente un cambio di paradigma che presenti la vecchiaia come una risorsa, anche quando significa fragilità e debolezza».\nUn movimento che lentamente sta cambiando paradigma sul ruolo degli anziani, anche nel solco di Papa Francesco , primo Pontefice ad aver dedicato 18 catechesi sul tema della vecchiaia e della presenza di tanti anziani nella società contemporanea, oltre a una Giornata mondiale dedicata a nonni e anziani. «Il Magistero del Papa su questo tema avverte monsignor Paglia - mostra l'urgenza e la grande opportunità perché la chiesa, le istituzioni e la società civile si uniscano in una riflessione profonda e larga da cui scaturiscano proposte e risposte efficaci per sostenere e accompagnare gli anziani nell'ultimo tratto della loro vita».\nDa qui la ricerca Ipsos, da cui emerge che il cammino è ancora lungo. Quando si chiede alle Diocesi coinvolte nell'indagine di associare un termine alla categoria «terza età», emerge una visione in prima battuta negativa. Terza età significa solitudine per il 35% del campione intervistato, vecchiaia (33%), assistenza sanitaria (30%) e non autosufficienza (28%). L'esigenza sempre più profonda, come sottolinea anche Papa Francesco, di dare risposta a bisogni molteplici e differenziati è considerata importante dalla totalità delle realtà diocesane ascoltate e nel 55% dei casi tale importanza è percepita come urgenza.",

    "text": "Microsoft has announced another wave of layoffs, cutting 650 jobs from its gaming division, according to a memo sent by Xbox CEO Phil Spencer on September 12. This comes just months after Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees earlier this year, bringing the total number of job losses in its gaming sector to 2,550 since the company acquired Activision Blizzard in 2023 for $69 billion.\nIn his memo, Spencer explained that these cuts primarily affect corporate and support functions, aiming to streamline the company for “long term success.” He assured employees that no games, devices, or studios are being closed or canceled as part of these layoffs. He emphasized, “Our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth.”\nXbox Faces Challenges Amid Industry Changes These cuts occur during a tumultuous time in the gaming industry, with several companies, including Microsoft, downsizing significantly. Spencer addressed the difficulty of the situation, stating, “We are deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues… We’re supporting them with severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition.”\nDespite the layoffs, Microsoft continues to push forward with ambitious plans. The company is preparing to launch the next installment in the Call of Duty franchise, Black Ops 6, in October, along with several other projects, including rumored next-gen Xbox consoles and possibly an Xbox handheld.\nPhil Spencer has reiterated that while these are hard decisions, they are necessary to ensure Xbox’s long-term success and sustainability.",

    "text": "¿Qué tan segura es tu vivienda? La SBS propone un nuevo manual que clasifica las edificaciones según su estructura, buscando mejorar la precisión de los seguros ante desastres como sismos o tsunamis. ¿En qué consiste?\n¿Sabías que la forma en que tu casa está construida puede influir directamente en tu seguro contra terremotos o tsunamis? La Superintendencia de Banca, Seguros y AFP (SBS) ha puesto en marcha un proyecto que busca hacer que los seguros de desastres naturales sean más claros y efectivos para todos, pensando en la tranquilidad de los ciudadanos.\nEl objetivo principal de esta iniciativa es simplificar cómo se identifica el tipo de estructura de tu inmueble cuando lo aseguras. ¿Por qué es crucial esto? Porque, hasta ahora, no existía una metodología estándar que permitiera a las empresas de seguros contar con información precisa y de calidad sobre la edificación.\nUn nuevo manual especializado\nPara solucionar esto, la SBS propone un \"Manual de procedimientos para la clasificación de una edificación de acuerdo con su tipología estructural\". Este manual fue realizado por expertos del Centro Peruano Japonés de Investigaciones Sísmicas y Mitigación de Desastres (CISMID), parte de la prestigiosa Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería (UNI).\n¿Y esto para qué sirve exactamente? Este manual permitirá tener un reporte de información mucho más preciso sobre las construcciones. Con datos más exactos sobre una vivienda, las empresas de seguros podrán estimar mejor las posibles pérdidas en caso de un desastre natural, como un sismo o un tsunami. Además, ayudará a que la reserva de riesgos catastróficos esté mejor calculada, lo que es vital para la capacidad de respuesta del sistema asegurador.\nLa reserva de riesgos catastróficos es, por así decirlo, un \"fondo de emergencia\" monetario que tiene el sistema asegurador para poder cubrir los daños cuando ocurre un desastre de muy grandes magnitudes. Para calcular este \"colchón\", la SBS utiliza un software que se alimenta de la información proporcionada por las mismas empresas de seguros.\n¿Qué encontrarás en este manual?\nEl manual propuesto es una herramienta muy completa. Incluye:\n- Información para la correcta identificación de las tipologías estructurales.\n- Parámetros que definen qué tan sensible es la respuesta estructural de una construcción.\n- Un glosario infográfico (con imágenes y gráficos) fácil de entender, tanto general como específico de las tipologías estructurales.\n- Criterios visuales para ayudarte en la identificación.\nOtras precisiones del proyecto de la SBS\nEl proyecto también establece con mayor precisión la fecha de cálculo de la exposición a desastres y cuándo deben enviarse los datos. Además, detalla cómo se realizará la estimación de pérdidas en estructuras consideradas especiales por sus características, y cómo se aplicarán los contratos de reaseguro, que permiten transferir parte del riesgo a empresas fuera del país.\nEste proyecto está disponible para que la industria y el público en general envíen sus comentarios y sugerencias. Puedes revisarlo en el portal de la SBS y enviar tus aportes hasta el 11 de agosto.",
