    "text": "First brown bear to undergo brain surgery emerges from semi-hibernation\nKeepers at Wildwood Trust in Kent say three-year-old Boki is looking ‘brilliant, happy and healthy’.\nBen Mitchell\nA brown bear which underwent pioneering, life-saving brain surgery in October has emerged from semi-hibernation “looking brilliant, happy and healthy”.\nThree-year-old Boki, who lives at Wildwood Trust, near Canterbury, Kent, had been suffering from seizures which were believed to be caused by hydrocephalus (fluid on the brain).\nHe had been medicated with prednisolone to deal with the swelling and build-up of fluid, but zoo staff would have been unable to treat him once he went into torpor (semi-hibernation).\nIt was decided that brain surgery was the best option for Boki and he went under the knife for five hours on Wednesday October 9, making him the first brown bear on record to have brain surgery.\nWorld-leading veterinary surgeon Romain Pizzi, who waived his fee for the job, fitted a stent between Boki’s brain and abdomen to help pass the excess fluid.\nA spokeswoman for Wildwood said the bear has made a “remarkable recovery” and was weaned off his medication with no adverse effects just before he went into torpor.\nHead of bears at Wildwood Jon Forde said Boki’s emergence from semi-hibernation is a key stage in his recovery.\nHe said: “He’s looking brilliant, happy and healthy and we haven’t seen any negative signs from him. All his personality traits are still there – he’s still the same old Boki that we love.\n“Boki did well for his first ever winter sleep. He lost around 30kg – we think a lot of this because he’s actually grown while he was asleep so a lot of energy has been used for that.\n“Our first job will be to put some weight back on him. At this time of year there’s not a lot of food around – mostly vegetation – so we’ll get some weight back on him but start him slow and take our time and make 100% sure he’s healthy.”\nBoki had been adopted from Port Lympne Wild Animal Reserve in December 2022 after he was rejected by his mother and had to be hand-reared by keepers there.\nThe spokeswoman said: “The team at Wildwood, renowned for their work with brown bears, had to help him learn bear behaviours. As part of this work, they had begun to integrate him with their two adult bears – Fluff and Scruff.\n“This had to stop with the onset of his seizures but the hope is that they’ll be reunited in the not too distant future.”\nWildwood’s head of zoo operations Mark Habben said: “What a remarkable transformation we’ve seen in this young bear – he’s back to being the Boki we first met. It’s like he’s forgotten that he even had an operation.\n“While the signs are very positive, we still need to proceed with caution and to take care with the reintroduction to Fluff and Scruff.\n“This will involve boisterous play, which we want to minimise in these early stages post-torpor.\n“We will monitor him very closely and, at some point over the coming months, we will conduct that introduction if everything continues to go well.\n“We have to take this step for his wellbeing and theirs as well – they want to be together.”",

    "text": "First Alert: We’re monitoring a severe threat & a COLD blast\nMERIDIAN, Miss. (WTOK) -\nWe’re going to have a couple of cold fronts cross our area over the next few days. The 1st one will cross on Friday, and it’ll be a dry front. This means that it won’t bring us any rain, but it will bring another dose of colder air. So, we’ll go from experiencing highs on Friday near 60 degrees to experiencing lows Saturday morning in the upper 20s...burr! Highs on Saturday will struggle to reach the mid 50s, but Saturday night into Sunday AM won’t be terribly cold thanks to a southerly wind that returns. We’ll start Sunday with low 40s, and highs will land in the mid 60s. Yet, this warm up will take place ahead of the next cold front that’ll impact our area... which will be more potent.\nFIRST ALERT- SEVERE RISK\nThe 2nd cold front will cross our area Sunday night, but showers & storms will erupt ahead of it. We’ll start our Sunday with scattered light showers (non-severe), then there will be a bit of a lull during the early afternoon. During that time, it’ll heat up into the 60s, and the atmosphere will become more supportive for possible threatening weather. The main line of storms will cross our area some time between 6PM - 2AM, and there’s the possibility for some storms to reach severe limits. For now, the risk is low, but it is still a risk. Damaging wind will be the main threat as this system will have a lot of wind energy. Even away from storms, wind gusts over 30 MPH will be possible. Yet, a tornado can’t be ruled out. So, it’s very important that you have multiple ways of getting severe alerts Sunday evening. Stay tuned to our First Alert Weather Team for updates.\nFIRST ALERT- COLD\nBehind Sunday’s storms, the coldest air of the season (thus far) will filter into our area. All of next week, highs will only reach the 40s which is WELL below the average. Morning lows will start in the upper 30s Monday (1/6), but 20s can be expected for mornings the rest of the week. This type of freeze is significant, so make sure to plan ahead and prepare to follow cold weather safety: [https://www.weather.gov/safety/cold](https://www.weather.gov/safety/cold)\nFIRST ALERT-WINTRY WEATHER POTENTIAL\nFor January 9-10, some forecast models are hinting at an area of low pressure moving across the northern Gulf....swinging moisture our way. As mentioned, we’re going to be in an unseasonably cold environment during that time-frame. So, if moisture does find its way towards us... wintry weather would be probable. Yet, the confidence is currently low for this to happen because there is not good forecast model agreement amongst the various forecast models we monitor. This forecast will be tricky, so stay tuned to our First Alert Weather Team as we continuously monitor the trends.\n[Click here](https://www.wtok.com/newsletter/) to subscribe to our daily newsletter!\nCopyright 2025 WTOK.

    "title": "Une jeune femme allemande se rend à l'hôpital pour une grippe et en meurt",
    "text": "Elle avait encore la vie devant elle. La jeune Lilly Keller, âgée seulement de 13 ans et originaire de Saxe-Anhalt en Allemagne, est décédée à l'hôpital. Sa famille n'arrive toujours pas à croire ce qui s'est passé car, au départ, il semblait que la jeune fille de 13 ans avait simplement attrapé une mauvaise grippe.Mais personne ne s'est rendu compte de ce qui se passait. «Toute notre attention était concentrée sur cette infection, et personne n'a remarqué que des pneumocoques avaient commencé à se propager», écrit sa famille. Les proches de Lilly Keller collectent actuellement de l'argent sur la plateforme GoFundMe.com pour permettre à l'adolescente de faire «le plus beau des adieux». L'objectif? 35'000 euros. Jusqu'à présent, près de 25'000 euros ont été récoltés.Mais comment cette mort tragique est-elle survenue? «Tout a commencé par un malaise sans grande gravité», écrit la famille de Lilly Keller. Mais ensuite, l'état de la jeune fille s'est dégradé. Elle a attrapé une grippe particulièrement violente et a donc été admise à l'hôpital local. Mais son état s'est très vite aggravé: moins de 24 heures plus tard, elle a dû être transférée dans un autre établissement, plus grand. «Là-bas, tous les moyens ont été immédiatement mis en œuvre pour la sauver.» Mais il est déjà trop tard. On sait maintenant que cette mauvaise grippe n'était pas la seule cause de son décès soudain.Les pneumocoques sont des bactéries qui se transmettent par gouttelettes. Elles se déposent alors dans le nasopharynx et peuvent provoquer diverses maladies plus ou moins graves. Elles ont notamment fait des ravages lors de la pandémie de grippe espagnole. Les personnes dont les défenses immunitaires sont affaiblies sont particulièrement menacées. Le site Internet de l'Office fédéral de la santé publique (OFSP) cite à titre d'exemple les enfants en bas âge et les personnes âgées.Parmi les maladies les plus fréquentes provoquées par les bactéries, on trouve les otites, les pneumonies, les septicémies et les méningites. Heureusement, il existe un vaccin contre cette bactérie. Pourtant, selon l'appel lancé sur GoFundMe.com, Lilly Keller était elle aussi vaccinée. Les infections se manifestent de manière sporadique dans le monde entier et il est effrayant de constater que beaucoup de malades en meurent malgré un traitement antibiotique administré à temps, comme l'écrit l'OFSP.Selon l'office fédéral, il y a en Suisse environ 1000 cas graves par an. «Au total, une centaine de personnes en meurent chaque année, dont environ 80% ont plus de 65 ans.» En guise de prévention, il est donc recommandé aux groupes à risque de se faire vacciner. «Cela est recommandé à tous les enfants de moins de cinq ans, à tous les adultes de 65 ans et plus et aux personnes présentant les facteurs de risque susmentionnés», conclut l'OFSP.",
