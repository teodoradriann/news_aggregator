    "title": "Former Indiana All-Star Saige Stahl finding success at ISU | Sports | tribstar.com",
    "text": "Saige Stahl, a 6-foot-1 sophomore forward for Indiana State women’s basketball, has made an impact on the court this season, particularly on the glass. She’s played in seven games going into Friday night’s contest at Eastern Illinois. She’s averaging 8.4 and 8.7 rebounds per game. ISU coach Marc Mitchell said Stahl brings everything that he wants. He said she puts the blue collar and hard hat on and punches the clock. “That’s exactly what I’m looking for,” Mitchell said. With her on-court play, Mitchell had praise for her toughness talking about how she brings toughness and grit. “That’s what we’re looking for and we need more players like her,” he said. So far, Mitchell has seen a great attitude and a hardnosed kid who is willing to get down and dirty whenever necessary. “She does whatever is necessary for the team,” Mitchell said. He said she’s taken well to his coaching and is one of the players that embraces that and doesn’t let it get to her. “It helps her, so she likes to be coached hard,” Mitchell said. Leadership-wise, Mitchell said Stahl plays the game the way he wants it to be played. Stahl was an Indiana All-Star in her senior year in Columbus East High School. She indicated that she does the same things now as she said she was always aggressive attacking the boards and knowing her advantage for each player she had guarding her. “I feel like I took away a lot from that,” Stahl said. From that she said she’s become better in understanding herself and the IQ of the games. Going into Saturday’s game at SEMO, Stahl had 45 rebounds on the season with 16 of those on offense and 29 on defense. The rebounding is where she said she makes a big impact. She noted her ability to get second possessions so they can have another chance to score. “That really changes the whole energy of the game, and I think that’s what I bring is energy when I come off the bench,” Stahl said. “I know my role and I know that’s what I have to do, just get it going. I always go out there and give it my all every possession of the game.” She said she feels like she’s been a told a lot this year that her hard work is what gets her on the court, and she knows that’s what she has to do every time she steps out on the court. With it being Mitchell’s first season as head coach and new players coming in, she said she feels she’s learned how to understand and read people more in how they play and adjust to that. It hasn’t been easy for the Sycamores this season as they’ve had some tough matchups that has led to a 1-4 record going into Saturday night’s game at SEMO. She touched on the adversity noting how when players get hurt, they have to adjust to a different rotation. Another thing they’ve learned according to Stahl is how to move the ball, play at a different pace each game and to the best of their ability. Tipoff for ISU (2-5) vs. EIU (2-5) is slated for 6 p.m. EST Friday.",

    "text": "Park City High School educator receives Utah Science Teacher of the Year Award A Park City High School teacher has been named the Utah Earth Science Teacher of the Year. Each year, the Utah Geological Association gives out the Earth Science Teacher of the Year award to a K-12 educator. Park City High School earth science teacher Ben Ray received the honor this year, along with $1,500. Ray has been teaching in Park City for 16 years. Matthew Affolter won the award in 2014 and now is on the Earth Science Teacher of the Year award committee. He said this year was unique. “For the first time ever, a student of the teacher nominated the teacher for the award,” Affolter said. The award is not set up for nominations; teachers apply for it on their own and must submit letters of recommendation, a lesson plan and more. However, Affolter said a former student Ray taught 15 years ago applied on his behalf. Ray said he was “incredibly flattered and humbled” to receive the award. He also said it felt good to have a former student confirm he was doing something right as an educator. Part of the reason Ray received the award is his teaching philosophy. “For me, I want to reach kids where they're at so that what they experience is meaningful for them,\" Ray said. \"In a world where technology is more encroaching, and you might argue that students are receiving more of a virtual education, through studying about the Earth, there is still a real connection that can be made.” The UGA said Ray’s students enjoy how he uses popular media to educate them about the Earth, like comparing the movie “Dune” to Earth today, with conflicts over finite and limited resources. K-12 earth science teachers can [apply for the 2025 award later this year](https://utahgeology.org/outreach/teacher-of-the-year).",

There's the rosy picture the White House draws about how Biden has \"lowered costs\": The Biden-Harris Administration’s top economic priority is lowering costs for American families. That’s why we are calling out price gouging and calling on big corporations to lower grocery prices – giving families more breathing room.— The White House (@WhiteHouse) [pic.twitter.com/uTMbewIvJK] [June 20, 2024] Republicans want to increase costs by going back to their same old trickle-down economics.— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) I have a different vision.

How's Biden \"helping\" the middle-class working out for the middle-class? Not great at all: Almost two-thirds of Americans considered middle class have said they are facing economic hardship, per Bloomberg.— unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) In the survey, 65% of people who earn at least $60,000 for a family of four said they are struggling financially [June 21, 2024] \"When does the \"Build Back Better\" phase of Bidenomics start and the \"tearing everything down\" part [stop](https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/majority-middle-class-americans-struggling-financially-2024-poll)? A majority of middle-class Americans are \"struggling financially\" and expect that to continue for the rest of their lives, according to a new poll. The poll, commissioned by the National True Cost of Living Coalition and published last week, found that 65% of Americans considered \"middle class\" – or those earning above 200% of the federal poverty level – are facing financial hardship. That’s about $62,300 for a family of four, according to FOX Business. Recommended According to the Biden White House, the middle-class is still struggling because of corporate \"greedflation\" that just coincidentally started after Biden took office.

    "text": "Oklahoma skies spawned more tornadoes in 2024 than any previous year, according to preliminary data from the National Weather Service.\nRecords show at least 152 tornadoes touched down in Oklahoma, which surpassed 2012, which had 149. It was an active fall that brought the total so much higher than normal, said State Climatologist Gary McManus with the Oklahoma Climatological Survey.\nThat these are “preliminary” numbers for tornadoes, the 149 are confirmed, McManus said. There are possibly a couple more that officials noted by radar, but eyewitnesses are required for final confirmation, McManus said.\nThe record-breaking 56 tornadoes in April combined with the record-breaking 33 in November, which when combined with the rest came to the 149 total, McManus said.\n“Had a very active April, a record number of tornadoes, so it was a very active spring,” McManus said. “But what kicked us over the previous record was November, where we had over thirty tornadoes. The previous record was 12, set in 1958. We blew that out of the water.”\nTornadoes that hit Nov. 2-3 in Oklahoma tore through homes in Oklahoma City, leveled a neighborhood in Choctaw, and knocked down an elementary school in Newcastle, as well as caused other damage including knocking out the power for 100,000.\nIn all, eight people died in tornadoes in Oklahoma in 2024, according to the weather service.\nHigher than normal temperatures in November combined with a record rainfall as well, McManus said, which created the right conditions for tornadoes that month.\n“We had the wettest November on record across the state of Oklahoma and one of the top-ten warmest,” McManus said. “Being very warm, that sort of thing goes hand-in-hand. We have a really warm November with a lot of severe weather and rainfall, so, a number of tornadoes.”\nEven as the records broke, most of the tornadoes were of the weaker variety, the Enhanced Fujita 0-1 variety, accounting for 34 and 71 events, respectively, according to the weather service. There were no EF-5 tornadoes. However, there were eight EF2, seven EF3, and two EF4 tornadoes.\nWhile the high number of tornadoes might concern many, there is good news, McManus said. The wettest November on record will help stave off drought through what might be a drier than normal January.\n“Well, it certainly helped that we got all that rainfall in November,” he said. “We're in the cool season so it doesn't evaporate as much, the sun's not as high in the sky. It's not as hot of course, and the plants are dormant by October and November, and then into the winter. That keeps us out of drought by and large.”\nAll this information comes as Oklahoma also tied with 2012 as the warmest year on record, with an average temperature of 63.2 degrees, also tying 2012 as the warmest calendar year on record—2.8 degrees above normal, according to the weather service.\nDecember ranked as the fifth-warmest on record with a statewide average of 44.7 degrees, 4.6 degrees above normal, the weather service reported. The Oklahoma Mesonet’s 120 sites recorded December temperatures of at least 70 degrees on 126 occasions, with the highest reading of 76 degrees observed at several locations across multiple days, according to the release.\nOklahoma’s weather records date back to 1895.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#3](c3#c-3) y está escrito, en su libro mágico, que todos los no judíos existen para servir a los judíos.\nSu libro mágico es el bueno, los demás libros mágicos no.\n[#19](c19#c-19) En realidad sí, pero no te alarmes, no hay construcción de la identidad etnica de un grupo (y más si se trata de uno generalmente minoritario y perseguido)n sin su dosis de etnocentrismo.\nEn el caso de los creyentes en yahvé el resto de la humanidad es referida como “goyim”, o “gentiles” y no tiene connotaciones especialmente positivas.\n[#9](c9#c-9) [#19](c19#c-19) \"En la Torá se afirma claramente que el hombre fue creado con un propósito concreto: emular la justicia Divina sobre la Tierra. En un principio, toda la humanidad fue elegida para esta tarea. Sin embargo, los primeros hombres no dieron cumplimiento a esta, misión y permitieron que la- corrupción y la violencia predominaran sobre la justicia y la bondad. Por ese motivo, Dios determinó que se produjera el Gran Diluvio (Mabul) a fin de eliminar a los malvados. En lo sucesivo el castigo por incumplimiento se llevaría a cabo a nivel nacional y no universal. Por esa razón Dios eligió a una nación en particular para que cumpliera esta misión. El Pueblo Elegido seria una nación modelo de Dios sobre la Tierra y demostraría al resto de la humanidad cómo comportarse. Esta nación era la judía.\"\nhttps://www.tora.org.ar/pueblo-elegido-y-su-mision/\nSi eso no es considerar a un pueblo por encima del resto, da lugar a suficientes malas interpretaciones como para llamarles supemacistas.\nNo hay religión buena, no hay fanático respetable.\n[#51](c51#c-51) Qué curioso que un diós omni-de-todo ande con fallos de producción (los prototipos) y culpe de ello a sus creaciones.\nDiós: te voy a hacer libre... y te voy a colocar aquí el fruto del pecado. No lo toques, eh?\nEl Diablo, también creado por Diós, pero SIN que Diós se percate, dice: no seais pipas, esto mola.\nDiós: Malos! Me habeis desobedecido. Hala.... a la mierda. Pero es vuestra culpa, eh? Que quede claro. Y si os poneis cabezotas, mando a Abogados Cristianos a que se querellen.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Típico de fanatismos y sectas cuando se hace una barrera entre los que están dentro y los que están fuera. Cuando la religión no respeta otras formas de ver el mundo es cuando empiezan los fanatismos y las hostias. Si no se acepta la diversidad de credos, apaga y vámonos porque lo que viene luego no es agradable para nadie.\nLuego empezarán con sus Frentes Populares de Judea y acabarán a hostia limpia entre ellos, porque alguien que necesita y busca enemigos para elevar su moral y sus creencias son un saco de hostias en potencia. Alguien que piense así, tiene todas las papeletas para recibir hostias a cascoporro y es lo que van buscando. Quien anda con fuego acaba quemándose.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Un mes.. da un mes, al resto del planeta - sin eeuu... iban a ver los \"elegidos\" que opinan de aquello del \"pueblo elegido\"...\n[#9](c9#c-9) Creo que el problema es que eso lo dice la religión de los judíos, que son descendientes de no sé qué tribu elegida por un dios.\nY habrá judíos que se tomen el judaismo como pertenencia a un grupo y lo reinterpretan y lo ponen al servicio de su vida (igual que hay cristianos que no apedrean a su hija si se casa sin el permiso de su padre). Pero el judaismo tiene una base de supremacismo muy mala de esquivar.\nPues para ser el pueblo elegido:\n- menuda mierda territorio les ha dado, a mí que me den algo que no sea un puto desierto: Francia, El norte de España, Italia, las Seychelles, las mismas orillas del Nilo, Mesopotamia. Zonas fértiles.\n- Salvo los últimos 70 años les han dado más que a una estera.\nAsí que menudo dios cutre.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Eso es: si su dios los hubiera elegido y les tuviera cariño bien pudo haberles dao cuerpo de senegalés...\n[#11](c11#c-11) Un amigo ingeniero agrónomo me contó que aquella zona en tiempos bíblicos fue un vergel, pero empezaron a regar los cultivos con agua de mar y se lo cargaron. No son muy listos los “elegidos”.\nSi Dios existiera haría un fisting con su culo y les enviaría al puto infierno por toda la eternidad.\n[#23](c23#c-23) No sé salvaron los que no quisieron realizar la Aliá (que empezó en 1840 https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali%C3%A1 ) y a esos que no se salvaron los llamaron los sacrificados o holocausto https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocausto_(sacrificio)\nEs supremacista (pueblo elegido, el resto está para servir) y elitista (no buscan crear nuevos adeptos como en el cristianismo o islamismo o naces judío o no eres judío)\nEsto lo dicen los lideres religiosos judios y la mayoria de ellos lo aceptan como algo natural y te lo repiten con otras palabras menos extremas pero que vienen a ser lo mismo",
