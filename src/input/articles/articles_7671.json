    "title": "Liverpool vence Leicester de virada e amplia vantagem na liderança do Campeonato Inglês",
    "text": "Com uma boa dose de sofrimento, o Liverpool confirmou mais uma vitória no Campeonato Inglês nesta quinta-feira ao derrotar, de virada, o Leicester por 3 a 1 no Anfield. O jogo foi válido pela 18ª rodada da competição e, com o resultado positivo, a equipe do técnico Arne Slot ficou em posição ainda mais cômoda na classificação. Gakpo, Curtis Jones e Salah construíram o resultado enquanto Ayew descontou. Este foi o 13º triunfo da equipe no torneio.\nA equipe vermelha chegou aos 42 pontos e agora tem sete de frente para o Chelsea, o segundo colocado, que foi surpreendido nesta quinta ao ser superado em casa para o Fulham. O Leicester, que tinha pretensões de sair da zona do rebaixamento com um triunfo segue em situação complicada. O revés manteve o time na 18ª colocação com apenas 14 pontos.\nOs dois times voltam a campo neste fim de semana, para a última rodada do Campeonato Inglês em 2024. O líder joga no domingo e desafia o West Ham no estádio Olímpico de Londres. Já o Leicester tenta a reabilitação no mesmo dia recebendo o Manchester City.\nA partida ganhou contornos de dramaticidade aos cinco minutos. Mavididi fez jogada pela esquerda e cruzou rasteiro. Jordan Ayew se antecipou à marcação, fez o giro e chutou no canto direito do goleiro Alisson: 1 a 0 para os visitantes.\nA partir daí, o jogo foi de um time só, com o Liverpool pressionando e o Leicester se defendendo. O sufocou se manteve até o fim do primeiro tempo. Aos 43 minutos, Gakpo caiu pela esquerda e chutou cruzado para vencer o goleiro Stolarcyk e empatar a partida.\nTal como a etapa inicial, o segundo tempo também se iniciou com bola na rede. Mas desta vez, quem soltou o grito de gol foi a torcida local. Mac Allister recebeu pela direita e cruzou. Curtis Jones fechou na pequena área e virou a partida: 2 a 1 aos três minutos da etapa final.\nÀ frente no placar, o time vermelho se acertou em campo e passou a ditar o ritmo da partida. Aos 21, o Liverpool voltou a marcar, novamente com Gakpo. No entanto, o lance foi checado pelo VAR e o gol não foi confirmado.\nSoberano em campo, o Liverpool chegou ao terceiro gol já na parte final do segundo tempo. Salah recebeu pelo lado direito e invadiu a área. Ele achou espaço para a finalização e bateu cruzado. A bola morreu no outro canto: 3 a 1 aos 36 e mais uma vitória assegurada no Campeonato Inglês.",

    "title": "Comment on Skillet Chicken with Couscous by Yumna",
    "text": "This post may contain affiliate links. Please read our\ndisclosure policy.\nI love when a meal comes together in one skillet! I’m all about that lately and that’s why I was so happy when my sister bought me a cast-iron skillet. It’s the convenience of sauteing something on the stovetop, then finishing it off in the oven. It’s such a fun way to cook, and I especially love it for chicken because it results in crispy edges and tender meat. To make it a complete meal, I’m sharing my (your new) favorite skillet chicken with couscous today!\nThose of you who’ve tried and loved the\nMediterranean couscous with shrimp recipe will definitely want to try out this skillet chicken recipe. It also has very basic ingredients and instructions with flavors that everyone will enjoy!\nIngredients\n- Boneless skinless chicken thighs\n- Chicken broth\n- Couscous\n- Aromatics: garlic and fresh thyme\n- Seasoning: garlic powder, paprika, salt, pepper\nHow to cook chicken in a skillet\nTo start, pat dry some chicken breasts or chicken thighs with a paper towel. Then season generously with paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper. You’ve probably seen me use this mixture many times before. I love it on chicken, potatoes and roasted veggies. It’s mild but flavorful, which is perfect for a crowd of picky kid eaters. Feel free to throw in your favorite spices instead.\nNext, heat oil in a heavy bottom skillet – something like a cast iron that has even heat distribution works great for this skillet chicken recipe. When the oil is hot in the pan and glistening, that’s when you add the chicken. You want to cook it for a couple minutes per side so that it gets a nice golden skin and releases naturally from the pan without sticking.\nAt this point, the chicken is not fully cooked. It’s only seared on the outside. But you want to remove it from the skillet and set it aside. We’ll come back to it in just a couple minutes.\nBecause we’re making it a complete meal, we’re using pearl couscous today. It’s basically a small ball-shaped pasta, very similar to orzo. In fact, you can substitute orzo here or even quinoa if you’d like. I love these tri-colored couscous with the dish because they add a comforting soft texture and fun color to the dish. You’ll want to toast the couscous with some olive oil and garlic in the pan to bring out its nutty flavor for just a couple minutes.\nNext, deglaze the pan with the broth. This is where you’re partly cleaning the pan from all the brown bits, and partly giving the couscous a big flavor boost (again from those brown bits). It’s a win/win step of the recipe if you ask me.\nAnd then you’ll transfer the chicken back to the skillet along with some fresh herbs like rosemary, thyme or sage. If you’d like, you can also add some lemon slices in there. You’ll finish cooking that whole skillet in the oven. And dinner will be served before you know it!\nTips to make moist chicken in a skillet\n- Uses a heavy bottom skillet for best heat distribution. Sometimes the skillet you use in cooking doesn’t matter much. Here it does. That’s because a skillet with a thick heavy bottom will give you even heat throughout the cooking process, and can handle being finished off in the oven. If you don’t want to finish the cooking in the oven, you can use a stainless steel or nonstick skillet with a lid and continue cooking on the stovetop.\n- Dab the chicken dry before seasoning. This step will help to get that beautiful golden color on the exterior of the chicken without it sticking to the pan. If there is leftover moisture on the chicken, it creates steam, which prevents browning.\n- Check the internal temperature of the chicken for best results. The time estimates I provide in the recipe below are simple estimates based on the size and thickness of the chicken I used. For the best accuracy, I would highly recommend using a quick-read thermometer and cooking the chicken to 165°F. Be sure not to go over that temperature or the chicken will become too dry.\nWhat to serve with skillet chicken\nThe great thing about this recipe is that you’ll make it with couscous so it’s ready to serve with that. If you wanted to, you could substitute the couscous for orzo or quinoa and and it would be a great combination. And you can also leave out the grains all together and just serve it with one of these side dishes:\nFor more chicken recipes, check out:\nChicken Broccoli Casserole Easy Butter Chicken Harissa Chicken Chicken Lettuce Cups Chicken Stuffed Zucchini Boats\nIf you’ve tried this healthy-ish feelgood Skillet Chicken with Couscous recipe or any other recipe on FeelGoodFoodie, then don’t forget to rate the recipe and leave me a comment below!

Cook until the chicken is golden brown and releases easily from the skillet, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside.\n- To the same skillet, add the couscous, garlic, thyme, and cook until the garlic is fragrant and the couscous is toasted, about 2-3 minutes. Add the chicken broth to deglaze the skillet, and bring the mixture to a boil.\n- Add the chicken back to the skillet, place the lemon slices around the chicken and place the skillet in the oven. Bake until the chicken is cooked through and the couscous is puffed, about 15 minutes.\nEquipment\nNotes\nStaubcast iron skillet.

    "text": "At least five powerful explosions rocked the Russian-occupied city of Sevastopol in Crimea on Tuesday, 31 January,\naccording to local residents and monitors. The blasts targeted the Belbek airfield, home to Russian military aircraft and the radio center of the headquarters of the entire Russian Black Sea Fleet aviation.\nThey are part of a Ukrainian campaign to degrade Russia’s ability to use the occupied peninsula as a base for operations in southern Ukraine.\n“Ukrainian aviation will definitely return home to its native airfield,” said Ukrainian Air Force commander Mykola Oleshchuk in a\nstatement confirming the attack conducted on the 204th Sevastopol Tactical Aviation Brigade. He thanked all who participated in “cleansing Crimea” of Russian occupation.\nEverything we know about the 31 Jan strike on Belbek airbase in occupied Crimea\nLocals reported explosions in Sevastopol, Saky, Feodosia, Razdolne&Hvardiiske; traffic suspended over Kerch bridge; video shows smoke over Belbek airbase 👇\n🎥 Trukha\n[pic.twitter.com/Em3GCo5fGW]\n— Euromaidan Press (@EuromaidanPress)\n[February 1, 2024]\nThe strike was most likely made with British/French Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles, which were repeatedly used to attack military objects in Crimea, as per\nDefense Express.\nA spokeswoman for Ukraine’s military, Nataliya Humeniuk, stated on air of the national telethon the next day that Russians acknowledged that five missiles hit the airfield, and hinted that aircraft were hit in the strike, saying that the Russians did not manage to disperse the aircraft prior to the strike.\nHowever,\nDefense Express doubts that airplanes were damaged, as the warheads of Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles are intended to strike protected underground facilities. The defense outlet notes that, most likely, the missiles hit the underground command point of the radio center of the HQ of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet aviation.\nVideos circulating on local Telegram channels showed thick plumes of smoke rising from the vicinity of the airfield as locals described a fire at the airfield.\nAt 18:39 Moscow time, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed 17 Ukrainian missiles were shot down over the Black Sea and three more over Crimea. Debris fell near the village of Lyubimovka, site of the Belbek airbase, the ministry said, but claimed Russian planes were undamaged.\nEarlier in the day, explosions had been reported near Sevastopol, Saky, Feodosia, Razdolne, and Hvardiiske. Occupation authorities declared an air raid alert and closed the Kerch Strait Bridge to traffic.\nOSINT analysts: radiolocation station was hit at Belbek airbase\nHowever, the Russian Telegram channel Astra\nreported that the attack struck a communications center at military unit 80159. The communications center caught fire over an area of about 30 square meters. There were reportedly no casualties.\nA local Telegram channel called Krymskyi Veter (Crimean Wind) reported, after gathering information from its followers, the coordinates of the attack, and\nclaimed that a radiolocation station was destroyed in the attack, that part of a cliff next to the runway broke off from the shockwave, and the vehicle fleet was also hit.\nIndirectly confirming the strike on the radiolocation station, Sevastopol’s occupation governor Mikhail Razvozhzhaev stated that houses in a neighborhood located roughly 300 meters from the probable impact site were damaged, Krymskyi Veter\nadded.\nOSINT investigator @Dmojavensis\nhttps://twitter.com/Dmojavensis/status/1752776400187359323, having analyzed the light/sound of the footage of the explosion, that the coordinates of the strike were either 44.67643, 33.55323 or 44.66882, 33.55127.\nAnother OSINT investigation account\n Radio and Nukes reported that it was “55-80% likely” that the target of the Ukrainian strike was an air defense radar command post/network node.\nRadio and Nukes estimates that the radar site contains two 5Zh6U NEBO-U VHF Early warning radars, one 96L6 Acquisition radar of the S-300/400 system or stand alone, one Pantsir-S2 Air short range defense system, and RSP-27 Approach radar used to help aircraft land.\nUkrainian OSINTer\nDnipro OSINT also geolocated the strike and concluded that it destroyed the underground command point of the main radar station at Belbek. His coordinates of the strike are 44.676684946980856, 33.55270148866832. Defense Express notes that reports of a landslide after the strike, confirmed e.g. in Krymvsky Veter’s report about a cliff breaking away, point to an underground explosion, making it likely that the missiles indeed struck the Russian underground command point.\nThe outlet also notes reports of radar stations being destroyed, stating that Russia kept expensive\nNebo radar systems there.\nSignificance of Ukrainian strike on Belbek\nSpokesman for the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yurii Ihnat\nsaid on air of Espreso.TV that the Russian aircraft likely based at Belbek airfield in occupied Crimea that was attacked on 31 January included enemy Su-27, MiG-29, and Su-30 jets.\nIgnat said that possibly, it also contains MiG-31BM aircraft, which carry missiles like the R-37 that threaten Ukrainian aircraft and helicopters in the south.\nHe added that the airfield is actively used by the Russians as one of the main bases in Crimea since the start of the full-scale invasion and is one of five such bases.\nIhnat noted it’s too early to talk about the results of the strike until confirmation of Russia’s losses. But infrastructure destruction reduces Russia’s capabilities in the seas to strike Ukraine, he said.\nUkraine can now systematically and regularly strike to degrade Russia’s combat capabilities, as it has some tools, Ignat said. But more strike weapons and aircraft from partners are needed to increase these capabilities, he added.\nThe Institute for Study of War\nreminds that Ukrainian forces recently repeatedly targeted the Saky airfield, located north of Sevastopol, as part of a multi-day strike campaign against Russian targets in occupied Crimea in early January 2024. A c ommand post was reportedly damaged during the Saky strike.\nIn the summer of 2023, Ukraine conducted a strike campaign against Russian military infrastructure and Black Sea Fleet out of the western part of the Black Sea, aiming to degrade the Russian military’s ability to use Crimea as a staging and rear area for defensive operations in southern Ukraine.\nRelated:",

    "title": "RED ALERT DAY: Significant ice accumulation possible tonight and Saturday morning | Top Stories | kwwl.com",
    "text": "Today: It is another cold morning with lows in the single digits to slightly below zero thanks to clear skies and a light east wind that is dropping wind chills to around 10 degrees below zero. While temperatures do steadily warm through today into tonight, most of the day will still be cold with afternoon temps in the teens to low 20s and wind chills in the single digits. Winds pick up from the east-southeast at 5 to 15 mph, gusting to 25 mph. Clouds increase through the day.\nA Storm Track 7 Red ALERT DAY has been issued from tonight to Saturday morning due to a wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet, and snow leading to ice accumulations of a tenth inch to 0.3” and snowfall accumulations up to around 1”. North of Highway 20, maximum snowfall amounts could range from 1 to 3”. This is a significant amount of ice expected that could make travel nearly impossible, especially on untreated roads. Bridges/overpasses, sidewalks, driveways, and parking lots could become pure ice and very slippery. Ice may coat power lines and trees and could lead to power outages and tree damage.\nTonight [ICE STORM WARNING]: The freezing rain starts in the west/south and moves north/east through the night. Start time could be around 10 PM at the earliest with most of the area seeing it within a few hours after midnight. Temperatures are in the low to mid 20s at the start of the event and climb to the low 30s by sunrise, allowing for the significant ice accumulation. The winds are stronger from the east-southeast at 10 to 20 mph, gusting to 30 mph, which can lead to more damage on ice coated power lines and trees.\nSaturday [ICE STORM WARNING]: Temperatures are slow to climb above freezing and overall highs are looking cooler, but in the mid 30s by the later afternoon/evening. The wintry mix of freezing rain/sleet/snow gradually turns to rain for areas south of Highway 20 and a rain/snow mix north of Highway 20. Therefore, the ice concerns continue through the morning and should improve in the afternoon to an extent. If we do end up seeing more of the snow and cold temperatures near freezing in the north, overall snowfall accumulations could end up in the 1 to 3” range there. Most of this wraps up Saturday night.\nSunday: Cloudy with highs in the mid 30s to near 40. There is a chance for some rain clipping the area Sunday night.\n- Brandon",
