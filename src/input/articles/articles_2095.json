    "title": "中学生自制火箭成功发射的启示",
    "text": "近日，一则中学生自制火箭并成功发射的新闻引发社会广泛关注。据报道，5月27日15时10分，在青海冷湖发射基地，“前海·宝安·飞燕一号”火箭划破天际，成功飞至10555.7米海拔高度，完成了大气数据采集任务。这枚火箭由来自深圳、北京、河北、山东等地的中学生自主研制。这群中学生凭借对航天科技的热爱，在有限条件下自主设计、制作火箭模型，并通过反复试验将其送入高空。这枚看似简陋的火箭，背后蕴藏着青少年对科学探索的热情，更折射出科技创新实践教育的重要意义。\n中学生自制火箭成功发射，背后是一个青少年团队实现创新梦想的故事。据报道，这个研制火箭的计划开始于2024年6月，一群来自全国各地的中学生航天爱好者自发组织了一个团队。在多方支持下，他们利用假期和课余时间，完成了火箭的设计、加工、集成、装配、测试等各个环节，最终成功圆梦。这枚火箭飞升至海拔逾万米的高空，采集到气象数据并传递给地面接收站，让学生们深刻体会到创新实践的魅力。\n这些中学生虽然发射的是火箭模型，但并不是随意网购的“高端玩具”，也不是父母代劳完成的“家庭作业”。他们为热爱而探索，因梦想而执着，最终有所获、有所得。从中，我们看到了一种探索未知的渴望，这种宝贵的精神基因，正是人类不断推动科技向前发展的原始动力。\n爱因斯坦曾说：“我没有特别的才能，只有强烈的好奇心。”某种程度上看，这并不是他的自谦之辞。无论多伟大的科学发明，都离不开科学家拓展人类认知边界的好奇心。从万有引力定律的发现，到蒸汽机、电灯、飞机的发明，无不体现了好奇心在推动人类科技进步中的作用。\n青少年是最具有好奇心的群体，他们思维活跃、想象力丰富，既具有天马行空的创意，又具有敢想敢干的行动力，我们应当呵护其宝贵的创新和探索精神。今年春晚舞台上惊艳亮相的人形机器人，背后“操盘手”就是一位90后“斜杠青年”王兴兴。他从小就热爱发明，动手能力极强，上小学之后喜欢上了看科幻纪录片，对未知世界始终充满好奇。用他自己的话说：“我一直希望通过自己的努力做出一个比较好的产品或者科技发明，然后改变世界。”可以说，正是这种发自内心的强烈探索精神，让他带领团队在具身智能领域闯出了一片天地。\n从更宏阔的视野来看，建成科技强国、教育强国、人才强国，实际上与我们每个人息息相关，尤其是年轻人敢于筑梦、勤于追梦的精神状态甚为重要。从自制火箭到未来的航天工程，从“小小发明家”到未来攻克技术难题的拔尖创新人才，青少年的探索精神是科技创新的宝贵火种，需要善加呵护，才可能迎来科技强国建设的燎原之势。家庭、学校、社会等方面都应当携起手来，尊重、鼓励、支持青少年的创新梦想，建立跨学科的创新实践平台，推动科学技术综合教育的普及，搭建更多青少年的科技竞赛与展示舞台，努力让每一个青少年的梦想都能翱翔于科学的天空。\n【责任编辑：席聪聪 编辑：王钟的】",

    "text": "A member of the Etowah City Commission was jailed by state wildlife officers after an investigation into illegal hunting on private property, according to records in McMinn County General Sessions Court. John William James, 43, of Etowah — listed as an Etowah city commissioner on the town's website — is charged with hunting without permitting, violation of proclamations or rules and regulations, and violation of the requirement to wear daylight fluorescent orange while hunting as required by state hunting laws, according to an affidavit filed by [Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency](https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2023/feb/18/tennessee-wildlife-falcons-tfp/) Officer Ben Davis. James was jailed on the charges earlier this month. He was freed on a $1,500 bond, according to court records. The investigation began in November with a complaint filed by a resident leasing property on County Road 616 regarding James' sitting across the road in his Ford F-150 wearing full camouflage, according to the affidavit. When Davis got there, however, the truck was empty, but he found it was registered to James. [(READ MORE: LaFayette man shoots girlfriend in hunting mishap)](https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2013/nov/23/lafayette-man-shoots-girlfriend-in-hunting-mishap/) Two phone numbers — a landline number and a wireless number — listed for James had been disconnected, and the affidavit did not include contact information. Near the end of November, wildlife officers received permission from landowners to access the property involved and adjacent properties where the owners had prohibited hunting, according to the affidavit. When officers got a call Dec. 27 alleging James was again parked at the property, they found the same truck, empty again, but they also located other signs of hunting. \"I located numerous tree stands,\" Davis said in the affidavit. Davis found one tree stand that was overlooking an area baited with whole, shelled corn and a grain/corn mixture, according to the affidavit. A trail camera — a battery-powered camera with a motion sensor trigger — was found mounted to a tree, aimed at the baited area. The seized camera had more than 860 photos on it, including photos from inside James' business and a man in camouflage with an empty bag of \"Buck Bourbon, Barrel Proof, Highly Attractive Supplemental Feed\" into a backpack. The other photos on the camera depicted various species of wildlife in the baited area. The photos were dated between Dec. 13 and 27.

The photos include images of James, dressed in camouflage, carrying a climbing-type tree stand and a firearm walking in front of the camera. He was not wearing the required 500 square inches of hunter-orange. James was freed on a $1,500 bond, according to court records.
