    "title": "Why Bills are Super Bowl favorite after destroying Broncos",
    "text": "Entering as a tiny favorite against the Ravens in the Divisional Round of the NFL playoffs, the Buffalo Bills have bold expectations for the contest. And here is why the Bills are the Super Bowl favorite after destroying the Broncos in the Wild Card round.\nKeep in mind that being the Super Bowl favorite can last just one week in the playoffs. If another team seems to put it all together, the Bills could take a step back among perceptions for the quest.\nHowever, coming out of the Wild Card round, the Bills displayed enough on both sides of the ball to have that look as the team to beat. Apologies to the two-time-defending champion Kansas City Chiefs, but they have squeaked by in so many games this season they will have to prove it in the playoffs.\nIt all starts with Bills QB Josh Allen\nAgain, steps need to be slow here. There’s a chance Allen won’t even be the best quarterback on the field for Sunday’s divisional-round contest. With Lamar Jackson on the other sideline, Allen will have to shine to stand out.\nBut Allen knows how to bring it. He’s done it all season. Also, he’s gotten nice protection from the offensive line along the way, according to Joe Buscaglia of nytimes.com.\n“The Broncos boasted one of the top-producing defensive lines in the NFL this season,” Buscaglia wrote. “And they were up against a Bills offensive line that is among the league’s elite. If one of those two strengths dominated the matchup, it would go a long way to winning. And the Bills offensive line dominated the matchup.\n“The Bills offensive line, as it’s been all year, was the engine of their offense, and should they finally push into the Super Bowl this year, it will likely be one of the most significant reasons that it happens.”\nA solid offensive line, that allowed only 14 sacks on Allen this year — a career-low by 10 — makes him tougher, bolder, and more dangerous. The Ravens have their hands full because while Allen does his thing, the Bills also get the ball into the end zone on the ground, as pointed out by Colin Cowherd via buffalobills.com.\n“There's never been a team in pro football that had 30 passing touchdowns and over 30 rushing touchdowns,” Cowherd said. “Not only do they win at home. all but one home game was a blowout. Seven wins by 20 points. I think this offense is incredible. This team right now is so good offensively, left tackle, quarterback, weapons, run game, I have 'em number one by an inch. I think this is the year, I think this is the best version of Buffalo.”\nBills defense also plays into the equation\nThe return of linebacker Matt Milano is no small part of this story. He gives the defense direction, according to Dan Orlovsky on One Bills Live via buffalobills.com.\n“If you go back to that first game (against the Ravens), one of the massive takeaways was, oh my gosh, they just took advantage of Buffalo's eyes,” Orlovsky said. “And they had them completely running side to side. It just vacated space and it was kind of, you know, in a mocking way, so easy for Baltimore. So, to have the discipline of that group back is going to be huge.\n“To have the speed of that group back is going to be huge. I also think just having the ability, and I'm not saying that it's going to be a pin to shut out, but just have the ability for Milano to be in some situations, spying, on Lamar is going to be a huge deal in some of those past game situations. I think Milano would be a prime candidate to be that person, more often than not.”\nThe Bills came to life against the Broncos, holding them to 224 yards of total offense. They also totaled a pair of sacks against elusive QB Bo Nix and had four tackles for loss.\nBills edge rusher Greg Rousseau said the Bills’ defense understands it needs to play a big role in order to handle the Ravens overall, according to espn.com.\n“It really was just a message to ourselves,” Rousseau said. “We know who we are week after week, and what we’re capable of and what we’re supposed to do out there. That’s what it’s all about.”\nBills’ level of belief riding high\nThe Bills enter the game with tons of confidence, tackle Dion Dawkins said according to a post on X by Colin Cowherd via buffalobills.com.\n“Yes, this is the best that that I've felt,” Dawkins said. “This is the best that the team has felt. (Also,) this is the best that I've seen Josh. This is the best that I've seen McDermott, and this is the best that I've seen my coordinator. And with having a quarterback with his head calm and his head on, you know, just calm, cool and collected all day, every day, that takes a big toll on the team. He comes in to work every day positive… This is the best Buffalo Bills team I have ever been a part of in my eight seasons that I've been here.”\nThat kind of attitude is what it takes to push a team over the top. It’s looking more and more like the Bills might have all the tools to get where they want to be.",

Kroos will end his career after playing at Euro 2024 for Germany and never finished in the top three of a Ballon d’Or vote.\nBarcelona retained its Women’s Champions League title with past Ballon d’Or winners Aitana Bonmatí and Alèxia Putellas scoring in the final against Lyon.\nVoters are expected to consider players’ individual performance, then their team’s performance and also fair play.\nMonthly magazine France Football first presented the Ballon d’Or for men in 1956 and added a women’s prize in 2018. UEFA is now the magazine’s partner to help market the event and organize the ceremony in a theater in central Paris.\nLionel Messi and Bonmatí won the best player awards last year on the back of their recent World Cup wins.\nNew awards for the 2023-24 season include best men’s and women’s coach.",

    "text": "Ciudad de Guatemala, 1 feb (EFE).- La Corte de Constitucionalidad, máximo tribunal de Guatemala, ratificó este jueves la decisión de un juez penal de suspender al Movimiento Semilla, partido del nuevo presidente, Bernardo Arévalo de León.\nDe acuerdo con una resolución emitida hoy por la corte, el juez penal Fredy Orellana sí tenía facultades para suspender al partido de Arévalo de León en agosto de 2023.\nLa Corte de Constitucionalidad decidió rechazar un recurso legal presentado por un grupo de abogados en favor del Movimiento Semilla, que buscaba anular su suspensión y evitar que sus diputados en el Congreso continúen como independientes.\nEn agosto de 2023, el juez Orellana, sancionado por Estados Unidos, ordenó la suspensión del Movimiento Semilla a petición del Ministerio Público (Fiscalía) por supuestas anomalías en el proceso de creación de la agrupación en 2018.\nEl intento de cancelación del partido fue parte de las medidas que la Fiscalía, dirigida por Consuelo Porras Argueta, adoptó para intentar detener la investidura de Arévalo de León, quien llegó al poder el pasado 14 de enero, tras un sorpresivo triunfo en los comicios de agosto último.\nDurante el proceso de transición, Arévalo de León acusó directamente a Porras Argueta de intentar un \"golpe de Estado\" en su contra y días antes de asumir la Presidencia aseguró que le pediría la renuncia.

    "text": "Santé Livreurs à vélo : une crise sanitaire silencieuse\nDerrière nos repas livrés à domicile se cache une réalité préoccupante pour la santé des livreurs. Une expertise de l’Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire (Anses) révèle l'impact alarmant des conditions de travail sur ces travailleurs, majoritairement indépendants, qui sillonnent les villes à vélo.\nDepuis 2010, les plateformes de livraison de repas connaissent un essor fulgurant en France. Si elles facilitent notre quotidien, elles ont également créé un nouveau modèle d’organisation du travail aux conséquences sanitaires préoccupantes.\nAu cœur du problème : le management algorithmique. Ce système entièrement automatisé, sans intervention humaine, attribue les courses, évalue les performances et décide des rémunérations. Ce qui « génère une organisation du travail à risque pour la santé des travailleurs », alerte l’Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire (Anses) dans un avis publié le 26 mars.\nAinsi, sur la base de diverses analyses, l’Agence a observé des effets à court, moyen et long terme sur la santé physique et mentale des livreurs de repas des plateformes numériques.\nDe quels risques parle-t-on ?\nCirculation routière, conditions météorologiques, revenus souvent fluctuants… Tous ces éléments entraînent des conséquences sur la santé de livreurs à bicyclette :\nA court terme : traumatologie due aux accidents de la route ou aux chutes pendant la livraison, ainsi que des troubles musculosquelettiques causés par une mauvaise ergonomie « humain-vélo » ;\nA moyen terme : effets sur la santé mentale (stress, fatigue, épuisement) liés à la pression constante des notifications, à l’isolement et à l’absence de relations professionnelles stables ;\nA long terme : troubles du sommeil, maladies métaboliques, respiratoires ou cardio-vasculaires liés à l’activité exercée en horaires atypiques et à l’environnement de travail (pollution urbaine, bruit…).\nFace à ce constat, l’Anses formule des recommandations claires :\n- Appliquer aux livreurs les mêmes dispositions du Code du travail que pour les salariés en matière de santé et de sécurité ;\n- A l’échelle européenne, des actions ont été mises en place pour améliorer les conditions de travail des livreurs dans le cadre des plateformes numériques. L’Anses demande que son expertise soit prise en compte lors de la transposition en droit français de cette directive européenne.",

    "text": "En un sorprendente giro de eventos, el delantero Juan Miguel Jiménez, conocido como Juanmi, regresa a LaLiga para la segunda mitad de la temporada. El Betis ha decidido romper el préstamo que tenía con el Al-Riyadh de Arabia Saudí, al que Juanmi se unió en agosto del año pasado. El jugador de 30 años estará en calidad de cedido con el Cádiz, en un esfuerzo por impulsar al equipo andaluz en su lucha por escapar de la zona de descenso. Un refuerzo para no descender Juanmi vivió una experiencia oscura en el Al-Riyadh. En 17 partidos, el delantero solo logró anotar un gol y proporcionar dos asistencias. Ante este rendimiento, el Betis ha tomado la decisión de repatriar al jugador para reforzar al Cádiz en la segunda mitad de la temporada. Con la esperanza de cambiar el rumbo del equipo en la clasificación, Juanmi aportará su experiencia y habilidades goleadoras al conjunto amarillo. El atacante se unió al Betis en el verano de 2019 procedente de la Real Sociedad. Durante sus cuatro temporadas con el club verdiblanco, el delantero malagueño participó en 101 partidos oficiales, dejando su huella con 29 goles y 6 asistencias. Aunque la operación está pendiente de la aprobación del gobierno árabe, se espera que Juanmi llegue al Cádiz en calidad de cedido, sin opción de compra. Con la confirmación de esta noticia, los aficionados del Cádiz anticipan con entusiasmo la contribución del experimentado delantero en la lucha por la permanencia en la máxima categoría del fútbol español. - - 20 Jan 2024 | 21:00 [El Cádiz pesca en el Betis para reforzar su ofensiva](/noticias/cadiz-pesca-betis-reforzar-ofensiva-20240120.html) - - 20 Jan 2024 | 17:00 [El club de la Serie A que quiere fichar a Brian Rodríguez, estrella del América](/noticias/club-serie-quiere-fichar-brian-rodriguez-estrella-america-20240120.html) - 20 Jan 2024 | 22:00 [El fichaje TOP por el que se pelearán Real Madrid y Manchester City en verano](/noticias/fichaje-top-pelearan-real-madrid-manchester-city-verano-20240120.html) - 20 Jan 2024 | 17:00 [El Tottenham se olvida del fichaje de Conor Gallagher](/noticias/tottenham-olvida-fichaje-conor-gallagher-20240120.html) - 20 Jan 2024 | 15:00 [El Bayern Múnich quiere a un jugador del Real Madrid para reforzar su defensa](/noticias/bayern-munich-quiere-jugador-real-madrid-reforzar-defensa-20240120.html) - 20 Jan 2024 | 20:00 [La Saudí Pro League va por un jugador del Sevilla: Oferta de 10 millones](/noticias/saudi-pro-league-jugador-sevilla-oferta-10-millones-20240120.html) - 20 Jan 2024 | 19:00 [El AC Milan sigue buscando central: 2 opciones sobre la mesa](/noticias/ac-milan-sigue-buscando-central-2-opciones-mesa-20240120.html) - 20 Jan 2024 | 16:00 [El fichaje que le exigió Ten Hag al Manchester United para la delantera](/noticias/fichaje-le-exigio-ten-hag-manchester-united-delantera-20240120.html) - 20 Jan 2024 | 16:00 [El Newcastle se fija en una perla francesa de 40 millones](/noticias/newcastle-fija-perla-francesa-40-millones-20240120.html) - 20 Jan 2024 | 19:00 [El Villarreal quiere fichar a un descarte del Atlético de Madrid](/noticias/villarreal-quiere-fichar-descarte-atletico-madrid-20240120.html) -",

    "text": "Loiret Viols et agressions sexuelles : l'ex-prêtre d'Orléans condamné à 17 ans de prison Olivier de Scitivaux de Greische, 64 ans, a reconnu des centaines de viols et agressions sexuelles commis sur de jeunes garçons dans les années 1990 et 2000. La cour d'assises du Loiret a rendu son verdict dans le procès d'un ancien prêtre d'Orléans, âgé de 64 ans, qui a reconnu « sans réserve » des centaines de viols et agressions sexuelles commis sur de jeunes garçons pendant plusieurs années. Olivier de Scitivaux de Greische a été condamné ce samedi à 17 ans de réclusion criminelle par la cour d'assises du Loiret. Il a été reconnu « coupable de l'ensemble des faits de viols et agressions sexuelles aggravées », a déclaré la cour. Une période de sûreté de 10 ans, au-delà des réquisitions de l'avocat général, a également été prononcée. La veille, devant une salle interdite et suspendue à ses paroles, l'ancien prêtre, Olivier de Scitivaux de Greische – renvoyé à l'état laïc à sa demande – avait « reconnu tout sans réserve ». « Je reconnais l'ensemble des faits » « Je reconnais, puisqu'il faut utiliser les mots, les attouchements, les caresses, les fellations, les pénétrations digitales et péniennes, l'ensemble des faits », a-t-il déclaré. Le considérant coupable d'avoir commis « des centaines de viols et agressions sexuelles », l'avocat général, Cédric Vincent, avait requis 18 ans de réclusion, « une peine en-deçà de la réalité de ses agissements », assortis d'une période de sûreté de 9 ans. Il avait également requis une obligation de « suivi socio-judiciaire », « de soins », « l'interdiction d'exercer toute activité professionnelle ou bénévole impliquant un contact avec des mineurs » et son inscription au fichier des auteurs d'infractions sexuelles. L'ex-prêtre a avoué des viols et agressions antérieures « Ce qui est frappant c'est que les actes, les noms (des victimes) font masse », a estimé Cédric Vincent. Dans un rare exercice de confessions vendredi, l'accusé a également avoué, pour la première fois, des viols et agressions sexuelles sur deux autres victimes dès 1982 – des faits qui n'ont pu être jugés en raison de la prescription. « Vous allez condamner Olivier de Scitivaux pour combien de victimes ? », a interrogé son conseil, Me Damien Brossier. « Vous n'avez pas le droit de le juger » pour des victimes supposées ou pour celles qu'il a reconnues par ailleurs, a-t-il poursuivi. Trois frères violés et agressés plusieurs années Les faits jugés remontent aux années 1990 et 2000 lorsque Olivier de Scitivaux de Greische, ordonné prêtre en 1989, se lie aux parents de ses victimes, une fratrie de trois, s'invitant régulièrement à leur table, restant dormir dans la chambre de l'aîné, qui sera agressé et violé dès ses 9 ans. « La gangrène c'est Olivier de Scitivaux parce qu'il s'est introduit partout dans la famille », dénonce l'avocate d'une des victimes, Me Clémence Lemarchand. A leur domicile, pendant que les parents dorment au rez-de-chaussée, dans les demeures somptueuses de la famille Scitivaux, l'hiver au chalet à Abondance (Haute-Savoie) ou l'été en colonie de vacances à Perros-Guirec (Côtes-d'Armor), celui qui avait à l'époque 22 à 25 ans de plus que les victimes (âgées de 7 à 9 ans) va leur infliger des violences. Le benjamin « y pass(ait) toutes les semaines, tous les jours, tous les soirs » Devant une salle d'audience comble, dans laquelle de nombreux responsables de l'Église catholique et paroissiens prennent place depuis mardi, les trois frères et un ami ont raconté à tour de rôle, avec minutie et pudeur, les sévices qu'ils recevaient chacun leur tour, sans savoir que les autres étaient également victimes. « Quand il n'y en avait pas un de disponible, il y avait le deuxième ou le troisième », a confirmé l'ancien prêtre, désignant ainsi les trois frères, des quadragénaires aujourd'hui unis sur le banc des victimes. « Regardez bien ses mains », a invectivé mercredi le cadet de la fratrie, « ce sont dans ses mains que j'ai éjaculé la première fois, ce sont ses mains qui donnent l'eucharistie ». Le benjamin a lui raconté, devant une cour interdite, ces quelques mois où il « y pass(ait) toutes les semaines, tous les jours, tous les soirs », « le moment où il a utilisé des outils sur mon corps » ou lorsqu'« il m'a rasé ». Des premiers signalements dès les années 1980 Les faits se sont produits jusqu'au début des années 2000. Pourtant, les premières alertes sont émises par des animateurs et familles auprès du diocèse dès les années 1980, des familles ou des animatrices de l'aumônerie en 1998. En vain. L'Église catholique est depuis des années secouée par des scandales de pédocriminalité dans le monde entier, et régulièrement accusée de fermer les yeux sur eux et d'ignorer les victimes. [En France](/faits-divers-justice/2024/03/14/pedocriminalite-dans-l-eglise-489-victimes-ont-obtenu-une-reparation-financiere-en-2023), un rapport rendu en octobre 2021 estime qu'en 70 ans, environ 330 000 personnes ont été agressées au sein de l'Église lorsqu'elles étaient mineures.
