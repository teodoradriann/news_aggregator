    "text": "Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces By Press Association December 29 2023, 12.10am Share Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces Share via Facebook Twitter Linkedin Whatsapp Messenger Email Post link https://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/uk-world/4852877/sharp-rise-in-religious-hate-crimes-recorded-by-uks-largest-police-forces/ Copy Link The Home Office condemned the rise, saying there was ‘no place for hate in our society’ (PA)\nThe number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "text": "Mercenaries from the Wagner Group are becoming more violent and killing more people one year after the death of the paramilitary group’s leader.\nSince Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin died in a plane crash in August 2023, there’s been an 81% increase in violence involving Russian mercenaries in Mali, one of the West African countries where the group has deployed fighters, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a non-governmental organization that monitors conflicts globally. At the same time, the number of fatalities has surged 65%, it said.\nViolence has also surged in Niger and Burkina Faso, which like Mali brought in Wagner after military coups led to the withdrawal of European forces and United Nations peacekeepers from the region last year. All three countries have been facing decade-long Islamic insurgencies, though the mercenaries have done little to turn the tide.\n“The Sahelien regimes view the Wagner Group’s presence as a win-win,” Heni Nsaibia, Acled’s associate analysis coordinator for West Africa, said in the report, referring to how the mercenaries help keep the juntas in power. “In Mali, they pay $10 million a month for protection. That’s more than they spend on the budgets for major ministries like justice, family affairs, or environment.”\n In the Central African Republic, where Wagner deployed in 2019, the group has been particularly dangerous to civilians, with the reported number of people killed by Russian mercenaries this year already exceeding the total for all of 2023, according to data compiled by ACLED.\nIn all four countries, Wagner has continued to operate alongside and with the Africa Corps, a mercenary group under the control of Russia’s defense ministry that began recruiting shortly after Prigozhin’s death.",

    "title": "Chile. Reprimen brutalmente a estudiantes del Liceo 1 Javiera Carrera",
    "text": "Por Margarita Labarca Goddard. Resumen Latinoamericano, 26 de septiembre de 2024.\nLamentables sucesos, que ponen a Chile en la cabecera de los países que tratan a los niños como si se tratase de presas de caza, a las cuales se les puede maltratar, torturar, disparar, asesinar.\nApalean y maltratan a las niñas del Liceo 1 de Santiago, y esto lo hacen los pacos que dependen del gobierno, más específicamente de la ministra del Interior, señora Carolina Tohá o bien de la ministra de Defensa, señora Maya Fernández Allende. Dos mujeres de las cuales podría esperarse mucho, por razones obvias, pero que han defraudado a todos.\nComo vivo en el extranjero, no sabía que en Chile existen todavía colegios separados para hombres y mujeres. No todos, espero, pero muchos, los principales como el “Liceo 1 Javiera Carrera” para niñas y el Instituto Nacional para varones. ¿Esto es Chile o es Afganistán? No lo sé y ningún extranjero que lea estas noticias lo va a entender.\n¿Y qué era aquello tan grave que estaban haciendo las chicas del Liceo 1?\nPues se encontraban afuera de su colegio, rememorando pacífica y tranquilamente el 11 de septiembre de 1973. Muy patriotas, bien informadas e inteligentes resultaron estas niñas. La libertad de reunión pacífica está consagrada en la Declaración Universal de Derechos Humanos, que expresa en su Artículo 20: Toda persona tiene derecho a la libertad de reunión y de asociación pacíficas.\nPor lo demás, en el mundo entero -menos en Chile, al parecer- se considera que la libertad de reunión pacífica es un derecho fundamental de la democracia que permite a las personas reunirse para expresar, promover, perseguir, y defender intereses comunes.\nPero el 12 de septiembre de 2024, sin motivo alguno, llegaron los pacos al Liceo 1 y atacaron ferozmente a las niñas. Agua a presión con productos irritantes para causar el mayor daño posible. Hubo varias víctimas, una de ellas cayó al suelo por la violencia del chorro, y allí el agua del guanaco la siguió azotando. La muchacha resultó con serias lesiones y tuvo que ser llevada por sus compañeras a un hospital. También varias niñas fueron detenidas por carabineros. No voy a relatar todos estos hechos porque se pueden ver en las redes sociales o en las páginas de noticias de diarios extranjeros, naturalmente.\nEl día anterior el presidente Boric había pronunciado un discurso bastante aceptable para recordar el 11 de septiembre de 1973, discurso que siempre se lo hace un empleado que escribe muy bien pero al que le pagan una miseria.\nLos gobiernos se caracterizan por lo que hacen, no por lo que dicen. Reprimir ferozmente a las muchachas del liceo 1 Javiera Carrera es una acción muy similar a las que hacía la dictadura. Y tampoco es la primera, muchos hechos parecidos se han producido desde que, aparentemente, se terminó la tiranía.\nEn primer lugar hay que señalar que no se trata de que los carabineros hicieran un uso de la fuerza sin proporcionalidad, sin racionalidad, sin necesidad y sin responsabilidad, como más o menos señala el Instituto Nacional de Derechos Humanos (INDH) en la querella que presentó.\nPero miren, compañeros y amigos, ustedes están viviendo en otro planeta, en el planeta del pinochetismo, que se debería haber acabado hace rato. Porque en todos los países democráticos del mundo, el pueblo y dentro del pueblo los estudiantes, tienen derecho a manifestarse, a salir a las calles y expresar su opinión pacíficamente.\n¿Las niñas del Liceo 1 tenían pistolas, fusiles, metralletas u otras armas? ¡Claro que no!\nY al parecer todos, incluso el propio INDH, no entienden bien cuál es el fondo del problema. Es que los estudiantes y cualesquier otra persona tiene pleno derecho a manifestarse y en este caso a permanecer pacíficamente en el interior o exterior de su colegio, el Liceo 1 Javiera Carrera de Santiago, para conmemorar el 11 de septiembre de 1973 u otra fecha que les parezca significativa, sin que las fuerzas armadas o los carabineros puedan intervenir en forma alguna.\nNo se trata de reclamar porque la acción represiva fue desproporcionada, irracional, irresponsable, innecesaria y otras características similares.\n¿Por qué? Sencillamente porque también sería inaceptable una intervención armada proporcional, responsable, racional y, en suma, perfecta. Pues sólo con inmiscuirse en esta situación, los pacos y sus jefes están violando el derecho de manifestar pacíficamente su opinión que tiene o debería tener toda persona en Chile.\n¿Por qué digo sus jefes? Porque en toda institución jerarquizada como es la de Carabineros, los jefes (en este caso los oficiales, el Director de Carabineros, la ministra de Interior) son responsables de lo que hagan o dejen de hacer sus subordinados, que sólo pueden actuar por orden superior, ya que son jerarquizados y no deliberantes.\nNumerosos instrumentos internacionales sobre la matera lo disponen así, como el Estatuto de la Corte Penal Internacional (CPI) y su jurisprudencia; varios tribunales internacionales especiales, la Convención de la Haya de 1907, el Convenio de Ginebra de1929 y otros.\nIgualmente establece esta responsabilidad el Derecho Internacional Humanitario, que no es lo mismo que los derechos humanos, pues el primero podría denominarse “derecho internacional en caso de guerra”. También la Constitución Política que todavía nos rige, expresa en su artículo 19, inciso 13: La Constitución asegura a todas las personas:… 13°. El derecho a reunirse pacíficamente sin permiso previo y sin armas.\n¿Entendieron ustedes cómo es la cosa? ¿Lo habrán entendido los pacos y sus jefes, lo habrá entendido el gobierno y sus ministros o ministras? No lo creo, porque como defensa están dando argumentos completamente absurdos e incoherentes que sólo demuestran ignorancia y sumisión a quienes defienden todavía a la dictadura y quieren que se olvide el 11 de septiembre de 1973.\nPues no, señores. El 11 de septiembre de 1973 se va a conmemorar y a llorar en Chile y en el mundo entero, por los siglos de los siglos. Y por siempre se rendirá homenaje a nuestro presidente mártir, el compañero Salvador Allende y a todas las víctimas de la dictadura.\nLamentables sucesos, que ponen a Chile en la cabecera de los países que tratan a los niños como si se tratase de presas de caza, a las cuales se les puede maltratar, torturar, disparar, asesinar. Algunos ejemplos:\nFrancia: Malos tratamientos en guarderías infantiles: las fallas de un sistema privado, nutrido con dinero público\nRevelaciones sobre un proceso que hunde al grupo People & Baby.\nUna ex-directora de guardería está siendo juzgada en lille por violencias sobre menores, junto a una antigua enfermera. La empresa está en el centro del libro del periodista Victor Castanet sobre los fallos de las guarderías infantiles privadas…\nEn el parking de la guardería, Pola* se apresta a subir a su automóvil, con su bebé Esther* en los brazos. Pero una auxiliar de puericultura sale del edificio por una ventana y la atrapa. Sin que nadie las vea, le pasa un mensaje: tiene que retirar a Esther de la guardería. Pola se inquieta pero no tiene alternativa… Un mes más tarde, encuentra a su hija con « un enorme hematoma azul, desgarros en su piel y sangre seca » en la frente, bajo una mecha de pelo echada torpemente encima, como para disimular. Esta vez Pola va ante la Justicia. (* Pola y Esther son nombres cambiados, para este artículo Fuente: Mediapart).\nIsrael\nUn bombardeo israelita a una escuela en Gaza mata a 21 personas.\nEntre las vícitimas figuran «13 niños y seis mujeres» una de ellas embarazada, precisó el vocero de la defensa civil. (Fuente: prensa internacional)\nPacos y gobierno de Chile:\n¡Un esfuerzo! ¡Hagan un esfuerzo para llegar al mismo nivel de ignominia!\nFuente: Rebelión",
