    "title": "\"Adelante\": Biden campaign launches new ad in Spanish focusing on the American dream for Latinos",
    "text": "The Biden-Harris 2024 campaign has unveiled a new Spanish-language ad titled \"Adelante\" (Forward) emphasizing the president's commitment to Latinos and the values the message claims matter most to the community: family, hard work, and dedication.\nThe ad features Fabián, a union member and voter in Arizona who shares his story of pursuing the American dream. He expresses gratitude to Joe Biden for understanding people like him—Latinos who prioritize family and work tirelessly every day to reach their goals.\n\"Adelante\" is part of a media blitz with a $50 million budget for Biden and Harris's reelection campaign in July. The ad will air during high-traffic television events, including the 2024 Olympics and the Republican National Convention.\nThe campaign aims to connect with Latino voters across several states, building on\nthe seven-figure paid media campaign that began around the Copa América and included everything from campaign-sponsored events at swing-state sports bars and restaurants to television and digital ad campaigns in English and Spanish on Fox, Univision, radio and other outlets covering the tournament.\nMaca Casado, Director of Hispanic Media for Biden-Harris 2024, commented on the new Spanish ad in a statement to\nLa Opinión :\n\"Fabián's story mirrors that of countless Latinos pursuing the American dream, valuing family and hard work. The Latino community deserves a president who embodies these values—not a racist criminal convicted 34 times, concerned only with himself.\"\nThe Biden campaign also expanded on the ad with a statement:\n\"Trump separated families, attempted to end protections for Dreamers, and proposed budgets that cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food assistance programs relied upon by Latino families. Moreover, the former president came within one vote of repealing the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which would have denied healthcare access to millions of Latinos and threatened those with pre-existing conditions.\"\n© 2024 Latin Times.

    "text": "Despite some freakishly adverse weather in February, rainfall for the month was only 48 per cent of the average for the time of year, while temperatures had clocked in at 2.1 degrees Celsius above normal, official data released on Friday showed.\nTotal rainfall during the period October 2023 to February 2024 was approximately 280.4mm, or 75 per cent of normal. During the same period 20 million cubic metres of rain flowed into reservoirs, well below desirable levels.\nAccording to the Water Development Department on Friday the reservoirs are only at 47 per cent capacity compared with 69 per cent this time last year and contain 138 million cubie metres compared with over 200 million cubic metres in going into the summer of 2023.\nSome reservoirs are fuller than others. The island’s biggest dam at Kouris is at 40.8 per cent of capacity, Kalavasos 30.3 per cent, Lefkara 63 per cent, Asprokremmos 55.6 per cent and Evretou 54.6 per cent.\nSenior engineer Yiannis Economidou told the Cyprus News Agency that inflow this winter had been low.\n“Certainly, things are not good and that is why we are assessing the water balance on a continuous basis with the aim of optimal allocation of available water resources from government water projects for all purposes,” she said.\n“Every year to make sure that water is distributed correctly and wisely, we prepare and implement the annual water distribution scenario with the basic principle of fully satisfying water supply needs without any cuts.”\nEconomidou said it was unlikely there would need to be water cuts this summer, but she said there would be limits on the quantity given to agriculture.\n“We are promoting a series of measures to inform farmers, mainly to promote improved irrigation practices emphasising improved systems and precision irrigation while also promoting the maximum utilisation of reclaimed water,” she added.\nShe also spoke about water consciousness among the public. “The correct use and saving of water is a matter that concerns each of us individually,” she said.\nEven though the weather in February was mostly sunny and clear, different areas did experience unsettled weather phenomena that included torrential rain, hail, snow in the mountains and even a tornado. These transitory weather events did not however help in terms of reaching the normal levels of rainfall for February, only contributing 39.2mm, less than half the average.\nSome places were wetter than others. The average rainfall in Stroumbi in Paphos was 20 per cent of what it normally is in February, whereas rainfall in Kelokedara, also in Paphos, saw 122 per cent of the average. In the Larnaca district, rainfall ranged between 56 per cent of normal in Meniko to 114 per cent in Athienou).\nOn February 14, Yermasoyia was hit by a tornado that caused enormous damage to house and properties and the electricity network resulting in power cuts in several areas of Limassol. Some 20 roads were closed due to fallen trees, and some photovoltaic plants were also destroyed. Some families were also left temporarily homeless due to the damage to around 150 properties including residential houses and farm outbuildings.\nNicosia district also saw some flooding in the Potami area, which also experienced a power cut. Kampos village also sustained damage with farms reporting destruction of their outbuildings.\nLater in the month, another bout of torrential rain caused problems in Astromeritis, Evrycho and Agia Marina Xyliatou in Nicosia and in Kofinou in Larnaca. The Kilrou dam also overflowed.\nThe bad weather hit islandwide on between February 13-18 to varying degrees, affecting traffic flow on the highways.\nAt the same time, it was not exactly cold, at least during the day. Most weather stations recorded their highest maximum temperature on February 6, 13, 25 and 29 hitting 16C and 17C. Only February 1 and 5 had temperatures below normal. The remaining days were above or close to the average, the met office said.\nCyprus Mailon Google News",

    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.

This decision comes just two months after the company dismissed around 350 trainers from the same location.\nHowever, this time, to assist the affected trainees, Infosys is offering an alternative career path, including 12 weeks of training for potential roles in Infosys Business Process Management (BPM).\nFor those who decide not to pursue opportunities with Infosys, the company will arrange transportation from Mysuru to Bangalore, along with a standard travel allowance to return to their hometowns. Trainees can also stay at the Employee Care Centre in Mysuru until their departure.\nOfficials explained that since these individuals were not full-time employees but apprenticeship trainees, their termination does not fall under layoff regulations as per labor laws.\n\"They were all only trainees, and some underwent training for three months. We cannot call it a layoff, so these labor laws are not applicable in such cases. There is no employer-employee relationship at all,\" a department source said.\nDespite facing criticism, the company has stood firm on its policy, which states that freshers who do not pass the internal assessments cannot continue with the organization.",

    "text": "Maputo, Mozambique — Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi has promised to continue supporting Mozambique in its fight against violent extremism in the oil-and-gas rich province of Cabo Delgado, even after the imminent departure of southern African troops from the troubled region.\nAddressing a media conference upon his arrival in the Mozambican capital Maputo late Wednesday, Masisi said the withdrawal of troops from Cabo Delgado does not mark the end of his country's support in combating violent extremism.\nMasisi said Botswana remains ready to assist Mozambique.\n\"In the military and security space, we are going to share our know-how and expertise because we are to you what you are to us,\" said Masisi. \"And just to make it clear, we will stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Mozambique in the quest for peace, so any instability such as we witnessed, we will be ready to intervene.\"\nBotswana is the second country, following Tanzania to pledge continued support for Mozambique after the departure of troops from SADC, the Southern African Development Community.\nThe SADC troops are due to leave Mozambique on July 15 due to financial issues.\nAfter holding official talks with Masisi at his seaside palace in Maputo late Wednesday, Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi thanked his visitor for Botswana's role in the fight against terrorism in Cabo Delgado.\n\"Together, we work to combat these attacks and this help does not end,\" said Nyusi. \"There are many ways Masisi is supporting Mozambique and that will continue. We are training our officers, our military personnel in Botswana. And the flow will continue because these are the ones who must ensure the continuation of the fight.\"\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\nTop Headlines Botswana Arms and Armies Mozambique Submit By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy .\nSuccess!

If you look at al-Shabab in East Africa, it has been there for more than 10 years,\" said Zambara. \"So, anyone who thought that rising extremism in northern Mozambique is going to be a short war would not have looked at how terrorists have operated, not only in Africa, but even globally. \"\nThe insurgency in northern Mozambique began in 2017 and already has caused close to 6,000 deaths, leading to the displacement of more than 1 million people. Multinational oil and gas firms operating in the region, such as Exxon Mobil and Total, were forced to suspend operations over security concerns.\nRead the original article on VOA .",
