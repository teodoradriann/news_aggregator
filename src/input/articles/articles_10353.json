    "text": "San Jose: Nicaraguan police detained two senior Catholic priests on Thursday who are close to the country's top church leader, a person with knowledge of the matter said, raising the number of clergymen detained this week to at least six.\nThe source, who declined to be named for fear of arrest, said the two priests were detained for publicly praying for jailed Bishop Rolando Alvarez, the most prominent critic of President Daniel Ortega.\nLocal media outlet Confidencial named the priests as Carlos Aviles and Hector Treminio and noted that their arrest brings to at least six, the number of priests detained over the past week, adding that two of the clerics had already been released.\nThe government's press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOver the past few years, Ortega's government has targeted members of the Catholic church, a crackdown officials have in the past said was needed to punish treasonous behavior or other alleged crimes.\nAviles is the second-highest ranking cleric in the Archdiocese of Managua, led by Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes, while Treminio is its treasurer.\nAlvarez, the bishop of Matagalpa, forcefully criticised the government's deadly response to mass protests that broke out in 2018 and was convicted of treason and sentenced to a 26-year prison term earlier this year.\nLast week, police arrested Bishop Isidro Mora of the Siuna diocese, making him the second bishop to be detained after Alvarez's detention in 2022.\nMany of the latest clergymen detained were arrested because they publicly offered prayers for Alvarez, according to the source and local media, but the government has not issued any statements explaining the priests' alleged crimes.\nNicaraguan Bishop Silvio Baez, who has been living in exile in Florida since 2019 and is the second-ranking leader of the archdiocese, called for the priests to be released.\n#Nicaragua . Me indigna el injusto secuestro de tres queridos sacerdotes de Managua de parte de la criminal dictadura sandinista: P. Pablo Villafranca, Mons. Carlos Aviles y P.

    "title": "Lung Cancer Detection via Inhalable Nanosensors, Paper-Based Urine Test",
    "text": "Using a new technology developed at MIT, diagnosing lung cancer could become as easy as inhaling nanoparticle sensors and then taking a urine test that reveals whether a tumor is present. The new lung cancer diagnostic platform combines DNA-barcoded nanosensors— activity-based biosensors (ABNs)—that can be inhaled via a nebulizer or inhaler, with a simple paper strip-based urine test to detect the synthetic DNA reporter molecules that indicate the presence of specific lung cancer-related proteins.\nThe team suggests the technology, known as PATROL (point-of-care aerosolizable nanosenors with tumor-responsive oligonucleotide barcodes), could potentially replace or supplement the current gold standard for diagnosing lung cancer, low-dose computed tomography (CT), and could have an especially significant impact in low- and middle-income countries that don’t have widespread availability of CT scanners.\n“We were really pushing this assay to be point-of-care available in a low-resource setting, so the idea was to not do any sample processing, not do any amplification, just to be able to put the sample right on the paper and read it out in 20 minutes,” said Sangeeta Bhatia, the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, and a member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science.\nReporting on their developments in Science Advances, senior author Bhatia and colleagues suggested the technology could also feasibly be used to diagnose other lung disorders and infections. “Through the integration of different technological components, we have established a noninvasive “inhale and detect” approach to accurately diagnose early-stage lung cancer that would not require trained medical personnel, a long duration treatment, or centralized diagnostic laboratories … the high modularity of PATROL enables its potential to be extended to achieve rapid detection of chronic pulmonary disorders and infections.” The team’s paper is titled “\nInhalable point-of-care urinary diagnostic platform.” Qian Zhong, PhD, an MIT research scientist, and Edward Tan, PhD, a former MIT postdoc, are the lead authors of the study.\nLung cancer deaths are continuing to decline in nations with a high development index (HDI), and this is due partly to progress in early-detection tools and faster treatment, the authors noted. “Where available, low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been the standard of care to screen for early-stage lung cancer among high-risk and asymptomatic people, and this practice has led to an approximately 20 to 25% reduction of mortality in clinical trials,” they wrote.\nIn contrast, disproportionately high lung cancer mortality is observed in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) where there may be limited access to medical imaging. “… reduced patient access to imaging and the scarcity of trained personnel remain notable clinical challenges in areas outside urban imaging infrastructures in HDI countries, not to mention in LMICs … illustrating inequity in early diagnosis in resource-poor settings.” And it’s this lack of technology access that represents one of the chief challenges in addressing cancer health disparities.\nBhatia also noted, “Around the world, cancer is going to become more and more prevalent in low- and middle-income countries … The epidemiology of lung cancer globally is that it’s driven by pollution and smoking, so we know that those are settings where accessibility to this kind of technology could have a big impact.”\nBhatia has spent the last decade developing nanosensors for use in diagnosing cancer and other diseases. For their latest study, Bhatia and colleagues explored the possibility of using nanosensor technology as an accessible alternative to CT screening for lung cancer.\nThe nanosensor platform consists of polymer nanoparticles coated with a DNA barcode reporter that is cleaved from the particle when the sensor encounters a specific protease enzyme. Some proteases are commonly overactive in tumors. The cleaved reporters eventually accumulate in the urine and are excreted from the body.\nPrevious versions of the sensors, which targeted other cancer sites such as the liver and ovaries, were designed to be given intravenously. For lung cancer diagnosis the researchers wanted to create a version that could be inhaled, which could make it easier to deploy in lower resource settings. To achieve that, they created two formulations of their particles: a solution that can be aerosolized and delivered with a nebulizer, and a dry powder that can be delivered using an inhaler. “We first formulated the ABNs into microscale aerosols that could be delivered with clinical nebulizers or inhalers and are conducive to deep lung deposition,” they explained. “… these protease nanosensors can be formulated for efficient lung delivery via aerosol through direct nebulization from aqueous solutions, or incorporation into respirable dry microparticles.”\n“When we developed this technology our goal was to provide a method that can detect cancer with high specificity and sensitivity, and also lower the threshold for accessibility, so that hopefully we can improve the resource disparity and inequity in early detection of lung cancer,” Zhong explained.\nOnce the inhaled particles reach the lungs they are absorbed into the tissue where they encounter any proteases that may be present. Human cells can express hundreds of different proteases, and some are commonly overactive in tumors, where they help cancer cells to escape their original locations by cutting through proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM). These cancer-related proteases cleave the protease-specific DNA barcodes from the nanosensor particles, and the barcodes then circulate in the bloodstream until they are excreted in the urine.\nIn the earlier versions of this technology the researchers used mass spectrometry to analyze the urine sample and to detect the DNA barcodes. However, mass spectrometry requires equipment that might not be available in low-resource areas, so for the PATROL technology the researchers created a lateral flow assay (LFA) that allows the barcodes to be detected using a simple paper test strip on a portable reader. No pretreatment or processing of the urine sample is required, and the results can be read about 20 minutes after the sample is obtained.\nFor their reported study the investigators tested the system in mice that are genetically engineered to develop lung tumors similar to those seen in humans. The nanosensors were administered to the animals by inhalation seven and a half weeks after the tumors started to form, a time point that would likely correlate with stage 1 or stage 2 cancer in humans.\nIn their first set of experiments in mice the researchers measured levels of a panel of 20 different sensors designed to detect different proteases selected from a library of potential probes. “We sought to identify a minimal set of precision probes that could offer high predictive power via simply viable screening operations suitable for decentralized settings, and thereby help inform early detection and initiate timely interception,” they explained.\n“The final expanded panel of 20 candidates was then evaluated via in vivo screening in mouse models in an effort to nominate a small bespoke probe set with low-plex compatibility.” Results from experiments with the initial 20 nanonsensors were analyzed using a machine learning algorithm, allowing the researchers to identify a combination of just four sensors that was predicted to give accurate diagnostic results. “… we downsized a large library of stage-tailored ABNs to a 4-plex cohort and reengineered them with synthetic DNA barcodes to enable easy multiplexing with LFAs at room temperature,” they stated.\nTests in the mouse lung cancer model confirmed that this combination of barcoded nanosensors could accurately detect early-stage lung tumors. “With 100% specificity, the nebulized 4-plex ABNs exhibited sensitivity of 84.6% …” the scientists reported.\nSummarizing their technology in the Science Advances paper, the team concluded, “This work established PATROL as a POC detection platform that integrates modular inhalable synthetic biomarkers and multiplexable LFAs to detect, in a noninvasive manner with low-infrastructure needs, dysregulated proteolytic activity that correlates with early-stage lung cancer.”\nThe researchers next plan to analyze human biopsy samples to see if the sensor panels they are using would also work to detect human cancers. They acknowledge it’s possible that more sensors might be needed to make an accurate lung cancer diagnosis in humans, but that could be achieved by using multiple paper strips, each of which detects four different DNA barcodes.\nIn the longer term the researchers hope to perform clinical trials in human patients. A company called Sunbird Bio has already run Phase I trials on a similar sensor developed by Bhatia’s lab, for use in diagnosing liver cancer, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\nIn parts of the world where there is limited access to CT scanning, the PATROL technology could offer a dramatic improvement in lung cancer screening, especially since the results can be obtained during a single visit.\n“The idea would be you come in and then you get an answer about whether you need a follow-up test or not, and we could get patients who have early lesions into the system so that they could get curative surgery or lifesaving medicines,” Bhatia says. In their paper the authors concluded, “… highly modular diagnostic kits such as PATROL that can offer test results in a single session would be transformative in the detection of lung malignancies …”\nThe team suggests that the technology could also potentially be used to stratify patients and help clinicians select the best course of treatment. “PATROL may also enable efforts to improve risk stratification of early lesions to determine the clinical selection of follow-up procedures … We envision that by releasing disease screening from its current resource-intensive environment, we may enable feasible surveillance testing that would identify a disease when it is still easy to treat.”",

    "text": "Decommissioning chairman wanted to quit in 2001 after slow progress – records\nThe three commissioners ‘did not want to remain in Belfast beyond September’, a briefing note said.\nThe chairman of the body in charge of decommissioning as part of Northern Ireland’s peace process considered standing down from the role in June 2001 after months of slow progress.\nDocuments released from Ireland’s state files this year show a “downbeat” view of the pace of attempts to ensure the IRA and other paramilitary groups disabled their arms after the Good Friday Agreement.\nOfficials from Ireland’s Department of Justice and from the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) met the three commissioners of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) on June 27.\nDespite six meetings with the IRA representative since March, IICD chairman John de Chastelain said that “we are no nearer actually decommissioning”.\nWilliam Fittall of the NIO noted that, “more provocatively”, the three commissioners were proposing to be released from their roles by September 24, on its fourth anniversary.\n“John de Chastelain stressed that he and his colleagues did not want to be irresponsible or walk away from their commitments. But they had personal lives they needed to get on with.”\nHe also expressed concern about the commission’s credibility given “the impasse and growing unionist scepticism”.\n“They thought that putting the date in the public domain might produce a helpful jolt to the system.\n“Nevertheless, they were open to discussion on this. They understood that the governments might want the commission still to exist with a staff member there to answer the phones.\n“But the present three commissioners did not want to remain in Belfast beyond September.”\nMr Fittall noted that “their restlessness is something which we can exploit privately with Sinn Fein”.\nA week prior, Irish diplomat Niall Holohan recounted a meeting he had in Belfast with Clifford Garrard, who was Mr de Chastelain’s deputy.\nMr Garrard told Mr Holohan that the “waiting game” had been “an exasperating experience” for the commission.\n“Garrard was of the view furthermore that nothing less than an act of putting arms completely and verifiably beyond use would be enough to save David Trimble’s scalp on July 1,” the note said.\nIt added: “If David Trimble proceeds with his threat to resign on July 1 and the Good Friday institutions were to collapse as a result, it might prove difficult for de Chastelain to justify his continued presence in Belfast.”\nThe commission remained in place for four more years until it was verified that all IRA materiel was decommissioned.\nThe material can be viewed in the National Archives in file 2023/155/6.",

    "text": "Nuevo parte médico: el papa sigue en estado crítico y ahora presenta una insuficiencia renal leve\nLa complejidad del cuadro clínico y la espera necesaria para que las terapias farmacológicas den alguna respuesta obligan a que el pronóstico siga siendo reservado\nEl papa Francisco sigue en estado crítico en el hospital Gemelli de Roma, y aunque no ha tenido nuevas crisis respiratorias a su difícil cuadro clínico se añadió la presencia de una insuficiencia renal inicial leve, que \"actualmente está bajo control\", según el parte medico difundido por el Vaticano.\nA Francisco, ingresado desde el pasado 14 de febrero con una neumonía bilateral, se le suministraron el sábado dos unidades de concentrado de glóbulos rojos que supusieron el aumento del valor de hemoglobina, añadió el parte médico.\nLa trombocitopenia, es decir el nivel bajo de las plaquetas, que se le detectó el sábado \"se mantuvo estable\", explicaron.\n\"Sin embargo - añadieron -algunos análisis de sangre muestran una insuficiencia renal inicial leve, actualmente bajo control\"\nLa terapia de oxígeno de alto flujo continúa a través de cánulas nasales, después de que este sábado tuvo una crisis respiratoria.\nEl papa continúa alerta y bien orientado, continuó el parte médico.\n\"La complejidad del cuadro clínico y la espera necesaria para que las terapias farmacológicas den alguna respuesta obligan a que el pronóstico siga siendo reservado\", añadió.\nDurante la mañana, en el apartamento habilitado en el piso 10, Francisco participó en la misa, junto a quienes lo cuidan durante estos días de hospitalización.\nDurante la mañana, el Vaticano comunicó Francisco había descansado esta noche, pero aún necesitaba oxígeno suministrado con cánulas nasales.\nDebido a las dificultades para respirar, el papa tiene más dolor que los últimos días, precisaron las fuentes.\nLas condiciones del papa se agravaron este sábado al sufrir una crisis respiratoria por la que se le tuvo que suministrar oxígeno, así como requirió transfusiones de sangre debido a una anemia, mientras que ahora se ha sumado la insuficiencia renal.\nDurante la jornada, el Vaticano difundió el texto para el rezo del ángelus dominical en el que el papa escribía: \"Por mi parte, continuo con confianza mi hospitalización en el policlínico Gemelli, siguiendo con los tratamientos necesarios; ¡y el descanso también forma parte de la terapia!\"\n\"Agradezco de corazón a los médicos y al personal sanitario de este hospital por la atención que me están demostrando y por la dedicación con la que realizan su servicio entre las personas enfermas\", añadió el papa en su mensaje, que cómo el domingo pasado fue difundido sin que se celebrase el ángelus para que pudiera descansar.\n\"En estos días me han llegado muchos mensajes de afecto y me han impresionado especialmente las cartas y dibujos de los niños. ¡Gracias por esta cercanía y por las oraciones de confortación que he recibido de todo el mundo! Encomiendo a todos a la intercesión de María y les pido que recen por mí\", añadió Francisco.\nMientras tanto en el Vaticano continúan los actos del Jubileo y hoy se celebrará el dedicado a los diáconos y en sustitución del papa Francisco oficiará la misa en la basílica de san Pedro el pro-prefecto del dicasterio para la Evangelización, Rino Fisichella.\nHasta el hospital Gemelli se acercan durante el día decenas de fieles para rezar por la recuperación del pontífice argentino ante la estatua de Juan Pablo II que han llenado de mensajes, velas y flores.",

    "text": "منوعات\nوزارة التربية والتعليم في مصر تنفي تسريب امتحان الفيزياء للثانوية العامة\nنفت وزارة التربية والتعليم والتعليم الفني ما تم تداوله عبر مجموعات الغش على \"تليغرام\" حول تسريب امتحان الفيزياء للثانوية العامة 2025، مؤكدة أن ما نُشر لا يتجاوز كونه نماذج استرشادية ولا علاقة له بورقة الامتحان الرسمية.\nزعمت بعض مجموعات الغش الإلكتروني على تطبيق \"تليغرام\" تسريب امتحان الفيزياء المقرر توزيعه صباح اليوم الخميس في تمام التاسعة داخل لجان امتحانات الثانوية العامة 2025. وقد تصدرت تلك المزاعم عددًا من القنوات التي اعتادت الترويج لمواد زائفة خلال الأعوام السابقة.\nمن جانبه، نفى شادي زلطة، المتحدث الرسمي باسم وزارة التربية والتعليم والتعليم الفني، صحة هذه المزاعم، مؤكدًا أن الامتحان مؤمَّن بالكامل ولم يتم تسريبه.\nتأمين كامل لسير الامتحانات\nصرّح مصدر مسؤول داخل الوزارة أن أسئلة امتحانات الثانوية العامة تخضع لتأمين شامل، يبدأ من لحظة خروجها من مركز التوزيع حتى وصولها إلى اللجان الامتحانية، مشيرًا إلى تعاون وثيق مع الجهات السيادية لضمان سلامة الإجراءات.\nوأوضح أن ما تم تداوله عبر مجموعات الغش ليس سوى نسخ من النماذج الاسترشادية التي سبق أن أعلنتها الوزارة للطلاب بغرض التدريب، داعيًا أولياء الأمور والطلاب إلى عدم الانجرار وراء مثل هذه المنشورات، والتي تهدف فقط إلى التضليل.\nمحاولات للنصب وجمع الأموال\nأكد المتحدث الرسمي للوزارة أن بعض القنوات الإلكترونية تسعى لاستغلال قلق الطلاب وأولياء الأمور بادعاءات زائفة عن تسريب الامتحانات، وتهدف في الأساس إلى تحقيق أرباح من خلال النصب عليهم. وشدد على أن الوزارة ترصد مثل هذه المحاولات باستمرار، وتتخذ الإجراءات القانونية اللازمة بحق المسؤولين عنها.\nإجراءات توزيع الامتحانات في صباح يوم الامتحان\nتتابع غرفة العمليات المركزية في وزارة التربية والتعليم، منذ الصباح الباكر اليوم الخميس، عملية وصول أوراق أسئلة امتحان الفيزياء (لشعبتي علمي علوم وعلمي رياضة)، وكذلك امتحان التاريخ (لشعبة الأدبي)، إلى مقار لجان امتحانات الثانوية العامة 2025 المنتشرة في مختلف أنحاء الجمهورية.\nوأوضح المسؤولون أن عملية نقل الامتحانات تتم عبر صناديق معدنية مؤمَّنة، مُحكمة الإغلاق، وتُغلق باستخدام أقفال رقمية مشفَّرة، وسط إجراءات أمنية مشددة وبالتنسيق مع الأجهزة السيادية لضمان عدم وقوع أي خرق أمني.\nكل مراحل الامتحانات تحت السيطرة\nأكد خالد عبد الحكم، رئيس عام امتحانات الثانوية العامة 2025، ورئيس الإدارة المركزية لشؤون المديريات التعليمية، أن جميع مراحل الامتحانات تخضع لرقابة أمنية دقيقة، بدءًا من طباعة الأسئلة، ومرورًا بنقلها إلى مراكز التوزيع، ثم إلى لجان السير، وانتهاء بلجان النظام والمراقبة.\nوشدّد عبد الحكم على أن الوزارة لن تتهاون مع أي محاولة للإخلال بنزاهة الامتحانات، مشيرًا إلى استمرار المتابعة على مدار الساعة لضمان سير العملية الامتحانية بسلاسة وانتظام.\naXA6IDIxMi4yOS4yMzMuMjEwIA== جزيرة ام اند امز",
