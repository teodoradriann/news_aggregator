    "text": "The U.S. Congress experienced an extraordinary year filled with political drama, internal strife, and significant legislative challenges. As lawmakers gear up for the 2024 legislative session, they are faced with looming deadlines and a series of critical decisions, amidst an atmosphere of political turmoil and unprecedented events. Tumultuous Times in the U.S. House of Representatives The U.S. House of Representatives witnessed a year of unparalleled upheaval. The year began with a record-breaking 15 ballots before Representative Kevin McCarthy was elected as Speaker of the House. However, this victory was short-lived as, within nine months, McCarthy faced an extraordinary ouster – the first in history for a sitting speaker not convicted of a crime or associated with the Confederacy. The House’s dynamics were further complicated by the right-wing conservatives’ revolt, which led to a three-week delay in appointing a new speaker. In another unprecedented event, Republican Representative George Santos was expelled from the House, marking the first time a member without a criminal conviction or historical infamy was removed. These disruptions meant that for more than a month, the House was in a state of legislative paralysis, unable to address key issues or make significant progress on any bills. Senate’s Comparative Stability Amidst Chaos While chaos reigned in the House, the Senate displayed relative calm, focusing on legislative duties and attempting to confirm President Joe Biden’s judicial nominees. Despite their efforts, none of the dozen 2024 spending bills proposed by the Senate had been enacted into law. This contrast in the two chambers’ functionality highlighted the stark political divide and operational differences within the U.S. Congress. In the backdrop of these events, lawmakers narrowly averted several potential crises. They managed to prevent a historic default on U.S. debt and avoided government shutdowns, though only by resorting to stop-gap federal funding bills. A major legislative achievement for Congress was the passage of a defense policy bill, which authorized a record $886 billion in military spending. The year’s political drama extended beyond legislative battles. Concerns were raised about the age and capabilities of key political figures, including President [Biden](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-joe-bidens-economic-agenda-already-doomed/) and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. The political landscape was further shaken by Democrat Joe Manchin’s announcement that he would not seek re-election, fueling speculation about his future political aspirations. Adding to the tumult, the House authorized an impeachment probe of President Biden, although solid evidence of presidential wrongdoing had yet to be presented. Controversies also surrounded Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s use of a congressional hearing to display provocative images related to Biden’s son, Hunter. Meanwhile, three House Democrats faced censure for various reasons: Adam Schiff for his role in investigating former President Trump, Jamaal Bowman for triggering a false alarm in a House office building, and Rashida Tlaib for her comments about Israel’s conflict with Hamas. As the year draws to a close, the U.S. Congress reflects on a period marked by dramatic political shifts, unprecedented developments, and a series of legislative challenges. With the November presidential and congressional elections on the horizon, the stage is set for another year of intense political activity and potential upheaval in the U.S. Congress. The lawmakers’ ability to navigate these challenges and fulfill their legislative responsibilities will be crucial in shaping the nation’s political and legislative landscape in the coming year.",

    "text": "Optimism for more moisture in 2024 TUCSON, Ariz. (13 News) - 2023 started off with cooler than normal temperatures, but the year ended tied for the third warmest on record. Experts said conditions could be similar in 2024. The first three months of 2023 started on a soggy note. Officials said 2024 is starting off the same way due to El Nino. “We got a wet pattern coming up in the forecast in the next 10 days. And hopefully that will continue through early spring,” said John Glueck, senior meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Tucson. Following the rain in 2023 came the hottest July on record and a below-average monsoon. The heat and drier conditions contributed to Tucson’s current drought conditions. “We ended up with moderate to severe drought conditions, which are currently in place across the metro area,” said Glueck. With more rain expected to start the year, Glueck said we could see an improvement over the next few months. More rain and cooler temperatures could also bring much needed snow through spring. “Hopefully, we’ll have some nice winter storms coming through that will dump some snow on the Catalina Mountains so the Ski Valley can open up,” said Glueck. While many look forward to the opening of Ski Valley. Residents up on Mount Lemmon also want the snow as they remain under stage three water restrictions. “It’s really hard when you can’t even do laundry in your own house. They asked you not to use the dishwasher or to save your water from the shower to maybe we flush the toilet. It’s hard to live like that,” said Leanne Mack, a Mount Lemmon resident. Mack said she is looking forward to the potential for more snow this week and those to follow. “What we need is some good snowpack so that our springs can absorb the water. When we get the really hard fast rains it just kind of runs down. Yes it’s still getting wet up here but it’s harder for the ground to absorb and soak that in,” said Mack.

    "text": "MoneyDJ新聞 2025-07-24 10:57:28 記者 周佩宇 報導美利達(9914)指出，第二季雖面臨台幣升值帶來營收及毛利的影響，並有數億元的匯兌損失，但轉投資事業轉虧為盈，及其子公司均有獲利挹注，使整體業外項目維持正數表現，成為抵銷匯損的重要支撐。 就產品動能而言，公司因今年第一季推出全新電動登山車，帶動傳統淡季的二至三月營收表現相對強勁，而四至五月則有短暫調整。展望下半年，在歐美自行車市場復甦的節奏下，公司第三季營運仍將維持旺季高檔水準，第四季則趨於平緩。 美利達表示，目前中低階的公路車、電動城市車的庫存去化也已接近尾聲，品牌未進一步加大折扣，僅透過正常節奏出清，且相較部分小型品牌可能需至明年上半年才能完成庫存調整，美利達在今年第四季可消化告一段落。而目前銷售仍以礫石車、高階公路車與電動登山車為主力，三者合計占歐美市場出貨比重六到七成，客戶持續追單，公司亦透過調配人力滿足需求，工廠端至今仍維持忙碌節奏。 不過中國市場的衰退幅度較原先預期更為嚴重，全年營收估將下滑35%至40%，幾乎回到2023年的水準，與去年年增58%的高成長形成明顯對比。",
