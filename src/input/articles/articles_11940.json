    "text": "30 flights diverted, 100 delayed at IGI Airport due to bad weather The first impact on flight schedules was reported at 7.30pm on Wednesday, with diversions made until 1am. However, officials said flights were delayed for longer due to the cascading effect of the diversions New Delhi At least 30 flights were diverted from Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport late Wednesday and over 100 were delayed, as intense rainfall and gusty winds hit operations till the early hours of Thursday, officials aware of the matter said. The first impact on flight schedules was reported at 7.30pm on Wednesday, with diversions made until 1am. However, officials said flights were delayed for longer due to the cascading effect of the diversions. “Flights had to be diverted to nearby airports, with the maximum – 15 flights being diverted to the Jaipur airport. This was followed by nine flights to the Lucknow airport,” an airport official said. Two flights were sent to Ahmedabad, three to Amritsar and one to Chandigarh. Bad weather on Wednesday night was a combination of wind shear, lightning and intense rain, meteorological officials said. Wind shear is clocked when strong winds with opposing directions and intensities occur during a storm, making it difficult for flights to land. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said winds touching 45kmph were recorded at Palam, the closest weather station to the airport, which recorded 68mm of rainfall between 5.30pm on Wednesday and 8.30am on Thursday. Officials said 16 IndiGo flights, six Air India flights and one each from Vistara, Alliance Air, Air India Express, American Airlines, Emirates, Akasa Air and Cathay Pacific, besides a chartered flight, were diverted. As over 100 flights were also delayed, airlines and travellers took to social media to share information and advisories. “Flights to and from Delhi may get affected due to bad weather this evening. Guests are advised to start early for the airport, as slow traffic and waterlogging may delay movement,” Air India posted on X. “Started at 7pm from Raipur to Delhi, was a direct flight for about 1.25 hours, however still not reached Delhi. Feeling lucky to enjoy such a long ride with no clue as to by when will get down from the aircraft,” Deepak Gupta, a passenger on-board a flight, said.

    "text": "Beskrivning\nLand | Norge |\n---|---|\nLista | Oslo Bors |\nSektor | Råvaror |\nIndustri | Olja & gas |\nNscale, Aker and OpenAI to establish Stargate Norway: a 100,000 NVIDIA GPU AI Gigafactory powered by renewable energy in Northern Norway\n2025-07-31 07:00:05\nIn a landmark partnership, Stargate Norway plans to deliver renewable-powered,\nsovereign AI infrastructure, marking OpenAI's first gigafactory initiative in\nEurope\nOslo, Norway - 31 July 2025 - Nscale Global Holdings Ltd. (\"Nscale\"), Aker ASA\n(\"Aker\") and OpenAI today announced the launch of Stargate Norway: an advanced\nAI infrastructure project in Narvik, Northern Norway. Powered entirely by\nrenewable energy, the facility will target to deliver 100,000 NVIDIA GPUs by the\nend of 2026, with ambitions to scale significantly in the years ahead. Stargate\nNorway will be designed to provide secure, scalable, and energy-efficient\ninfrastructure for sovereign AI workloads across Europe, fully aligned with\nEuropean regulatory frameworks. The initiative is led by global AI\ninfrastructure provider Nscale, in partnership with Aker and OpenAI.\nStargate Norway is planned to deliver 230MW of capacity, with ambitions to\nexpand by an additional 290MW - positioning it among the most significant AI\ninfrastructure investments in Europe. The project marks OpenAI's first data\ncentre initiative on the continent and the inaugural European site under its\n\"OpenAI for Countries\" programme.\nThe facility will be located in Kvandal, just outside Narvik - a region\ncharacterised by abundant hydropower, low local electricity demand, and limited\ntransmission capacity. These conditions result in power prices well below the\nEuropean average, complemented by a cool climate and established industrial\ninfrastructure, making Narvik an ideal location for large-scale data\noperations.\nStargate Norway is projected to generate significant activity and a long-term\noperational presence in the Narvik region. The project will also collaborate\nwith local and regional academic institutions to advance AI research and\ndevelopment, supporting the growth of regional expertise and innovation in\nNorthern Norway.\n\"Announcing Stargate Norway and delivering one of the first European AI\nGigafactory to market is a strategic milestone for the region and boosts its\nrole in the global AI landscape,\" said Josh Payne, CEO of Nscale. \"Sovereign,\nscalable and sustainable infrastructure is now essential to remain competitive.\nWe're proud to partner with Aker, drawing on the team's extensive experience and\nimpressive track record, to deliver a new generation of AI economic and\nproductivity growth in Europe. Together, we are combining OpenAI's leading\nmodels with Nscale's vertically integrated AI cloud, to provide the sustainable\ninfrastructure necessary to support public benefit, build industrial resilience\nand enable long-term regional innovation.\"\nThe site will be designed and built by Nscale, leveraging its experience in\ndelivering sovereign-grade AI infrastructure across Europe. It will be owned by\na 50/50 joint venture between Nscale and Aker, to be formed through wholly owned\nsubsidiaries of Aker following the planned merger with Aker Horizons. Completion\nof the joint venture is subject to agreed-upon closing conditions.\nIn parallel, Nscale and Aker will begin preparatory steps and mobilise resources\nfor construction activities. Both parties have committed approximately USD 1\nbillion to the initial 20MW phase of the project, including upwards of USD 250\nmillion in equity on a 100% basis, where each partner will contribute equally.\nThe Kvandal site alone has the potential to scale tenfold in future phases as\ncustomer contracts are secured. OpenAI welcomes the opportunity to be an initial\nofftaker with the option to scale over time under its \"OpenAI for Countries\"\nprogramme.\n\"Norway has a proud history of turning clean, renewable energy into industrial\nvalue, powering global industries like aluminium and fertiliser,\" said Øyvind\nEriksen, President & CEO of Aker. \"Today, artificial intelligence and advanced\ndata operations represent the next wave of value creation. Northern Norway, with\nits surplus of clean energy, available capacity, and industrial readiness, is\nthe ideal launchpad for this transformation. With Stargate Norway, we're\ncreating new jobs, activity, and long-term opportunities in Narvik and the\nregion. For Aker, this is a natural evolution of our industrial platform. As\ndata centres shift from cost centres to value-generating assets, Norway's energy\nadvantage becomes a catalyst for the next generation of digital industry. We're\nproud to help drive this development alongside Nscale, OpenAI, and local\nstakeholders.\"\n\"Europe needs more compute to realize the full potential of AI for all Europeans\n- from developers and researchers to startups and scientists - and we want to\nhelp make that happen,\" said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. \"I've always said we'd\nlove to bring Stargate to Europe if the conditions are right, and we think we've\nfound that in Narvik with clean, affordable energy, ideal climate, and great\npartners in Nscale and Aker. Stargate Norway will help provide the compute power\nto drive the next wave of AI breakthroughs and economic progress for Europe, in\nEurope.\"\nThe consortium behind Stargate Norway has made long-term sustainability a core\nprinciple of the project. The facility will run entirely on renewable power and\nis expected to incorporate closed-loop, direct-to-chip liquid cooling to ensure\nmaximum cooling efficiency. Additionally, excess heat from the GPU systems will\nbe made available to support low-carbon enterprises in the region.\nAs OpenAI customers, Aker and Nscale will benefit from local access to models\nand AI services delivered via sovereign infrastructure. They will also offer\npriority access to Norway's AI ecosystem, enabling homegrown startups and\nresearchers to leverage world-class compute resources. Surplus capacity is\nexpected be made available to public and private sector users across the UK,\nNordics, and Northern Europe, supporting regional demand and contributing to the\nbroader development of Europe's AI ecosystem.\nAn announcement video featuring remarks from Sam Altman (OpenAI), Øyvind Eriksen\n(Aker), Josh Payne (Nscale), and Jensen Huang (NVIDIA) is now available.

    "text": "There are real fears that Australian cricket players will take T20 money over the chance to put on the baggy green, while other nations could stop playing the long form of the sport completely. While crowd numbers continue to dwindle at Test matches, T20 cricket continues to surge globally. It received the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) seal of approval to be part of the 2028 Los Angeles Games while The International League T20 in the United Arab Emirates became the latest big money tournament in an already cluttered calendar. Major League Cricket also launched in the United States, backed by Microsoft and Adobe. However it is the surge of franchise T20 cricket that could drive the final nail into Test cricket. Sparse crowds have begun to plague cricket in Australia, with Marnus Labuschagne pictured in front of bays of empty seats against South Africa in January, 2023 Nathan Lyon took his milestone 500th Test wicket in front of bays of empty seats at Optus Stadium in Perth against Pakistan in the first Test South Africa has also struggled to bring the crowds in for their Boxing Day Test blockbuster against India - which they won The owners of eight of the 10 Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises also own at least one team in another foreign competition, with that number set to expand in the coming years. It would create a situation where players would need to choose between T20 riches or representing their nation, with no room in the schedule to do both. That would mean only the most financially viable Test nations would be left standing, potentially meaning only Australia, England and India play the five-day game in the near future. It is not fearmongering or hyperbole, it is a real fear, Australian Cricketer's Association Todd Greenberg said. 'My message is, we're under pressure,' he told News Corp . 'Pressure might be a good thing, because it will lift all of our opportunities up and make us the best we can be, but other countries are really struggling, 'And we can't play against ourselves. So I'd like to think that Test cricket is more than just Australia, England and India in 10 years' time. 'We want to make sure that Pakistan and South Africa and New Zealand and others can continue to play against us. 'I worry that countries like South Africa and New Zealand in 10 years time may no longer be able to afford to have their best players playing and disappearing because of the push and pull of global leagues. 'So that is a concern. And I don't think I'm being an alarmist. I think I'm being a realist.' Australian Cricketers Association boss Todd Greenberg, pictured with his wife Lisa, believes Australia has to help battling nations stay relevant in Test cricket At present, Australia has seen the likes of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and even renowned short-form specialist Glenn Maxwell shun the riches of franchise cricket to focus on their country. However with gun players turning down playing for their nation in other countries, Greenberg is aware that situation could change very quickly in Australia. 'We're already seeing countries all over the world and particularly in New Zealand, South Africa, where that's already happening,' he said. 'And so my message is, it's not happening here at the moment, and it might not feel like it's gonna happen here at the moment, but it's happening in other countries in our sport. 'So we'd be crazy not to think that those pressures aren't going to be applied to us at some point in time. So we've got to have this conversation now. Make sure we're ready,' Greenberg said. Major League Cricket in the United States is the latest T20 league to appear in an already cluttered calendar The IPL continues to go from strength to strength and now franchises are looking to own international clubs - which could mean players are contracted all-year round Greenberg is not the only cricket identity forewarning the death of Test cricket. English cricket icon David 'Bumble' Lloyd said the death of Test cricket would come within a decade back in 2022. 'Where will they put it? There's no room for Test cricket as we know it, and my guess is that in future we will only see the iconic series: like the Ashes, England vs West Indies and England vs India,' he wrote for Sportsmail . England cricket coach Brendon McCullum, who has been the architect of Bazball in a bid to revive Test cricket, also previously warned that the long-form of the game was at risk if England was not competitive. 'Test cricket has always been the pinnacle for me,' he said in an interview with the ECB . 'But the popularity of it has somewhat trended south of late. 'So if Test cricket is to not just to sustain but thrive it needs England playing an attractive brand of cricket which is competitive with Australia, India and New Zealand.",

    "title": "Nissan's Latest Tech Features: Available Now in Elizabeth City",
    "text": "As automotive technology continues to evolve, Nissan has become a front-runner in integrating advanced features into its vehicles. Drivers today are looking for more than just fuel efficiency and horsepower – they want cutting-edge technology that enhances their driving experience, safety, and connectivity. Nissan has responded to this demand with a range of innovative features that are now available in its latest models. For residents of Elizabeth City and surrounding areas, Nissan of Elizabeth City cars offer a perfect opportunity to explore these high-tech options firsthand. In this guide, we’ll take a closer look at some of the most exciting tech features available now in Nissan vehicles, and how they are changing the way we drive.\nProPilot Assist: Revolutionizing Hands-Free Driving One of the standout tech features in many new Nissan models is ProPilot Assist , a semi-autonomous driving system that enhances both convenience and safety. Available in several models, including the Nissan Rogue and Altima, ProPilot Assist combines adaptive cruise control with lane-centering technology, allowing the vehicle to steer, accelerate, and brake within a single lane on highways.\nHow It Works : ProPilot Assist uses cameras and sensors to monitor road markings and vehicles around you, adjusting the steering, speed, and braking as needed to maintain safe distances. While it doesn’t replace the need for a fully attentive driver, it significantly reduces fatigue on long drives and enhances overall safety. Benefits : ProPilot Assist not only makes highway driving easier, but it also provides a smoother and more relaxed ride. It’s an ideal tech feature for drivers looking to reduce stress on long trips or in heavy traffic. NissanConnect: Stay Connected Wherever You Go For drivers who crave seamless connectivity, NissanConnect is a game-changer. This infotainment system is available on many new Nissan vehicles, including the Nissan Altima, Sentra, and Pathfinder. It offers a range of features designed to keep you connected to your world while keeping your focus on the road.\nSmartphone Integration : With Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, NissanConnect allows you to mirror your smartphone’s interface on the vehicle’s touchscreen. This makes it easy to access your apps, contacts, and music while driving without taking your eyes off the road. Remote Features : NissanConnect also offers remote services, allowing you to start your car, lock/unlock doors, and check vehicle health from your smartphone. This is especially useful for owners in Elizabeth City during extreme weather, as it enables you to pre-condition your vehicle from the comfort of your home. Navigation and Traffic : The built-in navigation system provides real-time traffic updates and route suggestions to help you avoid congestion and get to your destination faster. Around View Monitor: A New Perspective on Parking Parking in tight spots can be one of the most stressful parts of driving, but with Nissan’s Around View Monitor , drivers can get a bird’s-eye view of their surroundings, making parking safer and easier than ever. This feature is available in models like the Nissan Murano and Pathfinder and helps provide a 360-degree perspective of the area around the vehicle.\nHow It Works : The Around View Monitor uses cameras mounted on the front, rear, and side mirrors of the vehicle to provide a composite image of your surroundings. The display shows the area directly around the car and helps you spot potential obstacles that may not be visible in traditional mirrors. Benefits : This system significantly reduces blind spots and makes parking in tight spaces less of a challenge. Whether you’re parallel parking or navigating a crowded parking lot, the Around View Monitor offers a level of confidence and security that’s hard to match. Safety Shield 360: Comprehensive Safety Technology Nissan’s Safety Shield 360 is a suite of advanced safety technologies that is now standard in many of the brand’s newest models. This comprehensive system includes six key features that work together to help protect you and your passengers from accidents.\nFeatures Included : Automatic Emergency Braking : Detects potential collisions and applies the brakes if you don’t react in time. Rear Cross Traffic Alert : Alerts you when a vehicle is approaching from the side while you’re backing out of a parking space. Blind Spot Warning : Warns you if a vehicle is detected in your blind spot. Lane Departure Warning : Alerts you if you unintentionally drift out of your lane. High Beam Assist : Automatically switches between high and low beams based on surrounding traffic conditions. Rear Automatic Braking : Prevents collisions while reversing by detecting obstacles behind the car. Benefits : Safety Shield 360 offers peace of mind knowing that your Nissan is equipped with the latest technologies designed to avoid accidents before they happen. Whether you’re driving on city streets or the highway, these features can help protect you and your loved ones from unexpected dangers. Intelligent All-Wheel Drive: Optimizing Performance in Any Condition For drivers who encounter varying weather conditions, Intelligent All-Wheel Drive (AWD) is a technology that optimizes vehicle performance based on road conditions. Available in models such as the Nissan Rogue and Pathfinder, Intelligent AWD adjusts power between the front and rear wheels to enhance traction and stability.\nHow It Works : The system continuously monitors road conditions and can adjust the distribution of power to the wheels that need it most. This ensures better traction in rain, snow, and off-road situations. Benefits : Whether you’re navigating through rain-soaked streets or heading out for an outdoor adventure, Intelligent AWD ensures that your vehicle provides maximum grip and control. It’s perfect for those who live in areas where weather conditions can change rapidly. Nissan Intelligent Mobility: A New Era of Driving Nissan has embraced the future with Nissan Intelligent Mobility , a suite of technologies that enhances both the driving experience and vehicle performance. This system integrates advanced sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to improve safety, efficiency, and connectivity.\nKey Features : Intelligent Cruise Control : Adjusts your speed to maintain a safe distance from vehicles in front of you. Intelligent Forward Collision Warning : Alerts you when a potential collision with another vehicle is detected. Intelligent Lane Intervention : Actively assists in steering to prevent you from unintentionally drifting out of your lane. Traffic Sign Recognition : Identifies traffic signs and displays them on the dashboard, helping you stay aware of your surroundings. Benefits : Nissan Intelligent Mobility offers a holistic approach to driving, making your vehicle smarter, safer, and more efficient. By integrating these technologies into everyday driving, Nissan ensures that you have an enhanced driving experience wherever you go. Enhanced Audio Systems: For the Best Sound on the Road For music lovers, Nissan offers premium audio systems in many of its latest vehicles. Models such as the Nissan Altima and Maxima come with available Bose audio systems that deliver superior sound quality for an immersive listening experience.\nHow It Works : The Bose sound system uses high-performance speakers strategically placed throughout the vehicle to create a surround sound experience. The system includes features like noise compensation and adjustable sound profiles, allowing you to tailor the sound to your personal preference. Benefits : Whether you’re driving to work or heading out on a road trip, the enhanced audio system provides a high-quality listening experience that elevates your time behind the wheel. It’s the perfect feature for those who enjoy listening to music or podcasts during their commute. Conclusion Nissan’s latest tech features are transforming the driving experience, offering greater safety, convenience, and connectivity to drivers in Elizabeth City and beyond. From the semi-autonomous ProPilot Assist system to the advanced NissanConnect infotainment suite, these innovations are designed to make every drive smarter and more enjoyable. With features like Safety Shield 360, Intelligent AWD, and Nissan Intelligent Mobility, Nissan vehicles are equipped with the tools to ensure that drivers stay safe and in control, no matter the conditions.

    "text": "Ligue Magnus: Angers en finale, Grenoble y est presque\nPublié le , mis à jour le\nCe mercredi soir, Angers a battu Bordeaux (2-1) et validé sa place pour la finale de la Ligue Magnus. Grenoble, large vainqueur d'Amiens (7-1), y est presque.\nLes Ducs ont été parfaits. Ce mercredi soir, Angers s'est imposé sur la glace de Bordeaux (1-2), pour remporter sa demi-finale sur le score de 4-0. Cela permet aux Angevins de décrocher leur place pour la finale de la Ligue Magnus de hockey sur glace. Dans cette rencontre, Angers n'a pas attendu bien longtemps avant de briller. Dès la première minute de jeu, Braeden Shaw, meilleur pointeur de la saison régulière, a ouvert le score.\nDix minutes plus tard, le portier bordelais s'est incliné une seconde fois, face à Matthew Prapavessis. Le défenseur était parti depuis son propre camp, avant de remonter la glace en solitaire, pour ensuite aller marquer. Dans cette même période, Bordeaux s'est relancé, par l'intermédiaire de Kevin Dusseau, dont le puissant tir a atterri en pleine lucarne. Bordeaux n'a ensuite pas su inscrire d'autres buts, malgré 37 tirs.\nLa finale pourrait voir Angers affronter les Brûleurs de Loups. Ce mercredi soir, dans le même temps, Grenoble s'est très nettement imposé sur la glace d'Amiens (1-7). Désormais, les Grenoblois mènent 3-1 dans cette série et ne sont donc plus qu'à une marche de la grande finale. Pourtant, c'est bien Amiens qui avait réussi à ouvrir la marque, dès la 3eme minute de jeu, par l'intermédiaire de Rudy Matima, déjà auteur d'un doublé mardi soir.\nGrenoble a ensuite attendu le début de la deuxième période pour commencer à dérouler. Damien Fleury a égalisé avant que Kyle Hardy ne renverse tout. Dans l'ultime période, Christophe Boivin a été l'auteur d'un petit festival, avec un triplé en seulement cinq minutes de jeu. Aurélien Dair a ensuite marqué le sixième but des siens en fin de rencontre. Le festival des visiteurs a été conclu par le capitaine Sacha Treille. Tout se jouera ce samedi, pour Grenoble, qui tentera de valider son ticket pour la finale, devant son public.\nLes Ducs ont été parfaits.
