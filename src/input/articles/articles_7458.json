    "text": "Workers at Quality Pork Processors (QPP) in Austin, Minn. , have ratified a new, three-year contract that secures \"historic wage increases and a ratification bonus,\" the UFCW Local 663 announced this week. The contract gives workers a 15.6% raise, which is the largest wage increase given at QPP, according to the union. That includes a $2.20 per hour raise in the first year and a $3.10 per hour increase over the three-year term of the contract. Additionally, workers received a $200 ratification bonus, as well as improved vision and dental benefits. “I’ll be celebrating this contract with my coworkers,\" Josh Nelson, a worker in the cut department at QPP, said in a statement. \"Having the negotiations room packed with members won us more money than we ever have before.\" QPP did not respond to a request for comment on the ratification. \"The workers at QPP stood together to demand a contract that values their hard work with fair wages and dignity,” said UFCW 663 President Rena Wong. \"In Austin, a proud union town, workers made it clear: fair pay isn’t optional, it’s necessary.\"",

    "text": "Butler Blue off injured list after tearing ligament INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — The Butler Bulldogs athletic mascot is off the injured list. In early October, Butler Blue IV was sidelined with a torn cruciate ligament. The dog’s ailment was the equivalent of athletes’ ACL injuries. From the dog’s social media on Thursday: “Ya boy just got cleared for full activity! Thank you so much to my team of Doctors for getting me back stronger than ever.” The post includes video of the bulldog going through workouts, including one of Butler Blue walking in a water tank. [VCA Animal Hospitals’ website](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/cruciate-ligament-rupture-in-dogs) says dogs and cats can tear their crandial and caudial cruciate ligaments just as humans do with the ligaments in their knees: Making a quick turn of the joint or putting too much weight on it. Dogs generally tear their caudial cruciate ligaments in the middle joint in their back legs, VCA says. The bulldog mascot is a common sight at [men’s basketball games](https://butlersports.com/sports/mens-basketball/schedule/2023-24). The team’s next home game will be 6:30 p.m. Jan. 5 against Connecticut.",

    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California.\nThe 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared.\n“I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said.\nHe was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors.\nIt would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found.\n“So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled.\nIt was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost.\n“I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.”\nThe problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going.\nBy the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report.\nThe search was on then.\n“Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said.\nLukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal.\n“‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.”\nBut on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help.\nThe Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location.\nA K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family.\n“Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.”\nFortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.\nCopyright 2024 KSBW via CNN Newsource.

    "title": "Baltimore professor speaks on the history of Morgan State's 'Spite Wall'",
    "text": "By Rushaad Hayward ,\n5 hours ago The year is 1986 and you're a freshman at Morgan State University.\nYou're walking to class and you notice a large brick wall separating Northwood Plaza from the Northwood community, but you don't think anything of it.\nYou brush it off as nothing more than an out of place wall covered in graffiti.\nFast forward to 2023 when the wall got torn down, and it turns out it was known as the \"spite wall.\"\nRELATED: 'Spite Wall' comes crumbling down near Morgan State\nIt was constructed in the 1930s as a barrier of residential segregation for African Americans.\nDr. Damon Freeman, director of the History and African American Studies program at the University of Maryland Global Campus, says the wall is an important part of Baltimore's history.\nAdding he was shocked, much like many Baltimoreans when they discovered the true meaning of the wall.\n\"I think my first reaction was, they built a wall? Like, who does that,\" Freeman explained. \"This was a symbol of racial apartheid, which is the structures that are intentionally being built to politically, economically, culturally, socially separate one people from another group, and to endow characteristics of this one group.\"\nAs time passed, the wall became something accepted as part of Baltimore's landscape, much like the notorious \"Highway to Nowhere.\"\n\"Take this neighborhood that was seen as expendable, and build a highway through it that was going to be seen as something that economically beneficial. And so now, it's just part of the landscape,\" Freeman said. \"There was a very conscious level decision to build these things.\"\nBuilt on hate, the wall underscores the importance of not just Baltimore's history, but African American history.\nFreeman was torn when the wall was torn down last year, because of that very point.\n\"On the one hand, you can think of it as something like the Confederate memorials, for example. On the other hand, it is a reminder of why this history is important and what this history meant,\" Freeman said.\n\"Having the entire wall there really drives home the point of what this meant. It was a very conscious, deliberate attempt to keep out an entire community, so that they wouldn't have to see more of it,\" Freeman added.\nWhen the wall came down, Northwood Plaza store owner, Megan Lathan, called it \"poetic justice.\"\n\"It’s a full circle moment for the community and for the University,\" Lathan said.\nFreeman wants his students to know that African American history is American history.\n\"It's global history, it's not something to be segregated, or put off into a corner somewhere or celebrated in a month. It's a reflection of who we are as Americans,\" he said. \"If we don't acknowledge this history, we are essentially cutting off half our identity, who we really are.\"\nIt shows history for what it is he adds.\n\"You begin to walk around and look at the wall. And now suddenly, the wall takes on a different symbolism, it's much more significant now... So it helps you to begin to see layers. You begin to think differently about everything. So it helps you be a better thinker.\"\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "The arrival of Poland's first two F-35A Husarz stealth fighters at Ebbing Air Base",
    "text": "Two days before Christmas, Poland has received two big gifts with wings: its first fifth-generation fighter aircraft.\nThe two aircraft, numbered 3501 and 3502, arrived at the Air National Guard (ANG) base in Ebbing , Arkansas, on Monday morning. They will be used there to train the first Polish F-35A pilots from January 2025 on the US base. Here you can see the video published by the ANG showing the landing of these fighters:\nIn 2000, the former conservative Polish government signed a contract to purchase 32 F-35A Lightning II fighters for the Polish Air Force . The Polish F-35s are of the conventional takeoff and landing variant for dry land runways, the same version used by the United States Air Force (USAF). The F-35s will replace two Soviet fighter models still in service in Poland: the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29 and the Sukhoi Su-22.\nOnce delivered to Poland, the F-35s will be deployed at two air bases: Łask (in central Poland, where F-16 fighters currently operate) and Świdwin (in the north-west of the country, from where Polish Su-22s currently fly).\nOn August 28, on the occasion of Święto Lotnictwa Polskiego (Polish Aviation Day), Lockheed Martin held the presentation of the first of these fighters, nicknamed \"Husarz\" , in honor of the famous Polish winged hussars - the best heavy cavalry of their time - who liberated the city of Vienna at the Battle of Kahlenberg in 1683, with a sweeping charge led by King John III Sobieski against the Ottoman forces.\nThese aircraft will be the Polish Air Force's first fifth-generation fighters, the first to be stealthy (i.e. with a very low radar signature that will allow them to go unnoticed), and they are also the first Polish military aircraft to carry the traditional Polish checkerboard pattern in a low-visibility version , i.e. in two shades of grey instead of the white and red colours of the Polish national flag, something that has sparked some debate in that country.",

Iske & Scott Coleman, was inspired by “The Twilight Zone”, and stars Melissa Holder, Mark Booker, Cheri Bloomingdale, Aleksey Solodov, Nic Roewert, Peris Stapleton, Wendy Iske, Gina Cederberg, Sabrina Kinney, Mandy Barkurst, and Jordin Fitch.\nCheck out the trailer below.\nIf you are new to SCREAMBOX, welcome!

Slasher’ Celebrates Tabloid Culture on SCREAMBOX [Trailer]\nA cultural crusader strikes in L.A. Slasher, now\nstreaming on SCREAMBOX.\nDirected by Martin Owen and produced by Jeffrey Wright and Daniel Sollinger (Girls Against Boys, The Alphabet Killer), the black comedy stars Mischa Barton (“The O.C.”), Eric Roberts (The Dark Knight), Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy), Danny Trejo (Machete), and comedian Andy Dick as the voice of the killer.\nL.A. Slasher is “a biting, social satire about reality TV and the glorification of people who are famous for simply being famous.”\nThe film also “explores why it has become acceptable and even admirable for people to become influential and wealthy based on no merit or talent – purely through notoriety achieved through shameful behavior.\n“Incensed by the tabloid culture which celebrates it, the L.A. Slasher publicly abducts a series of reality TV stars, while the media and general public in turn begin to question if society is better off without them.”\nHere’s the trailer.",

    "text": "Dazhon Darien was charged with disrupting activities at Pikesville High School, after investigators determined he faked principal Eric Eiswert's voice and circulated the audio on social media in January. Darien's nickname, DJ, was among the names mentioned in the audio clips he allegedly faked, according to the Baltimore County State's Attorney's Office. Baltimore County detectives say Darien created the recording as retaliation against Eiswert, who had launched an investigation into the potential mishandling of school funds, Baltimore County Police Chief Robert McCullough said Thursday. Eiswert's voice, which police and AI experts believe was simulated , made disparaging comments toward Black students and the surrounding Jewish community. The audio was widely circulated on social media. Race-based commentary On the audio clip, a voice that mimicked Principal Eiswert made race-based commentary, including statements that African-American students were unable to \"test their way out of a paper bag,\" according to charging documents. There were also comments about Jewish individuals and two teachers who \"should never have been hired at the school.\" Police said the recording depicted a phony conversation between Eiswert and one of the school's assistant principals. The clip's viral circulation on social media had significant repercussions. Eiswert was temporarily removed from the school, and waves of hate-filled messages circulated on social media, while the school received numerous phone calls. Recording's authenticity was questioned After a meeting, Eiswert told police he believed the audio clip was falsified using AI. According to charging documents, Eiswert told police that he believed Darien was responsible. He said that Darien was \"technologically savvy and believed he was familiar with AI,\" and that there had been conversations with Darien about his contract not being renewed the following semester due to frequent work performance challenges. Interviews with multiple administrators at Pikesville High School revealed that Darien had multiple work-related issues since he began his role as athletic director in July 2023. Police said Darien had been reprimanded for terminating a long-standing coach at the school without approval. Investigators say Darien had accessed the school's network multiple times in December and January, performing online searches for OpenAI tools - which police linked to paid OpenAI accounts. A forensic analyst and university professor contracted by the FBI conducted an audio analysis of the file. The results determined that the recording contained traces of AI-generated content, with human editing that added background noises for realism after the fact, according to the charging documents. Another expert at the University of California, Berkley, analyzed the audio and also determined that it was manipulated. Response from school leadership \"As you can imagine, this has been a very difficult time for Pikesville High School community, principal Eiswert and his family, and team BCPS. We are incredibly proud of the students and staff and how they have stepped up to support one another,\" Baltimore County Schools Superintendent Dr. Myriam Rogers said. \"As I said then, and it bears repeating, the statements on the recording do not reflect the core values of our system.\" Rogers added that the county is taking \"appropriate action\" following Darien's arrest, \"up to and including a recommendation for termination.\"",
