    "title": "Reuters: Ukraine starts to rebuild towns and cities amid Russia's war ￼ - Euromaidan Press",
    "text": "In Ukraine, six settlements are undergoing reconstruction as part of a pilot program funded by the state. The initiative aims to advance the necessary skills and experience required for a broader reconstruction endeavor that lies ahead, Reuters has [reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-starts-rebuild-towns-cities-even-war-rages-2024-01-18/). Ukrainian officials say towns and villages require an urgent recovery from the consequences of Russia’s war and express concerns that a delayed effort could lead to the permanent exodus of millions of Ukrainians to Europe. “We’re fighting for every person who should return; for every child who needs to return and build their future here,” said Mayor of Trostianets Yuriy Bova. The city in Sumy Oblast, which is listed in the reconstruction project, was heavily destroyed by Russian attacks. Currently, Ukraine is planning to rebuild many buildings in Trostianets – from cafes and libraries to factories, schools, and hospitals, aiming to make life better for every resident in the city. In October 2023, Prime Minister Shmyhal said that more than $1.6 billion had been earmarked from the fund for reconstruction. The pilot projects received about $86 million last year, though the 2024 budget has not yet been set, a spokesperson for the reconstruction agency said. Kyiv also said it planned to finance the projects by a state fund comprised mainly of seized Russian assets. Earlier, the US House of Representatives had approved a bill on the confiscation of frozen assets owned by Russian sanctioned entities and individuals. The seized funds had been proposed to be directed towards providing additional military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. In December 2023, the US proposed a plan to its G7 allies to confiscate $300 billion in Russian assets. In its turn, Russia denounced the freeze as a violation of the basic principles of reserve security, hired international law firms, and commissioned expert views to defend its interests in [courts](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/01/12/bloomberg-russia-braces-for-legal-battle-over-its-frozen-assets/).

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky. (LEX 18) — On any given day at the Lykins home, you’ll find brothers Eli and Parker shooting hoops, tossing the football, or playing baseball.\n“Can you go easy so I can beat you?” Eli jokes to his big brother.\nThe smorgasbord of sports keeps the boys busy and their parents on their toes.\nBy all accounts, Eli is your average boy, but when you get to know the 10-year-old, you’ll find that Eli is anything but average.\nAs his parents Tom and Amber explain, Eli was born without his left arm from below the elbow down.\n“I found at my 20 week scan that Eli was going to be missing his left forearm due to ABS, which is amniotic band syndrome, when bands in utero are wrapped around his arm and constricts blood flow and basically pinch it off,” said Amber.\nThe parents admit, they were shocked and concerned at first, wondering what their son’s future would look like.\nDespite his limb difference, Eli arrived in the world as a healthy little boy, but as he grew, the double takes and questions from strangers inevitably came.\nTom recalled one instance when he took the boys to meet Santa and other children tugged on Eli’s arm, even screamed as they noticed his limb difference.\n“That puts you into a position where it's just new and you feel for him, but honestly he doesn't let that get to him…it would’ve got to me,” said Tom. “But he just throws it off and keeps going, he's always been like that.”\n“Because a limb difference does not define Eli,” Amber echoed.\nThat said, when Eli began asking about the potential of a prosthetic hand last year, it wasn’t in an effort to erase his limb difference, but to enhance it.\nWorking with Kenney Orthopedics, Eli looked through prototypes and chose the prosthetic he preferred while doctors made a mold of his arm.\nJust last week, the bionic hand arrived in the United States.\nAmber recounted the moment, “They said ‘We’re having someone drive it down right now, can you meet us?\" And we said, \"Absolutely, we’ll be there.’”\nUnbeknownst to them at the time, Eli became the first kid in the United States to receive the specialty hand, an added bonus to the excitement of receiving his first prosthetic.\nAs for how it works, the myo-electric bionic hand uses Eli’s muscles to control sensors, which then trigger functions like gripping and holding.\n“It's kinda heavy when I put it on, but I’m getting used to it,\" Eli said.\nHe’s yet to decide if he’ll use the hand while he plays sports. For now, Eli’s exploring the hand’s functions and using it for day to day tasks. After all, he had to adapt to holding a baseball bat and shooting a basketball without both hands long ago.\nWith or without his prosthetic, he’s just as capable as his peers, and perhaps that’s the moral of Eli’s story. A limb difference doesn’t define him, and he hopes others like him feel the same.\nTo them he’d say, “Don’t let others bring you down.”\nAcross the United States, more than 5.6 million people live with limb loss. April is Limb Loss and Limb Difference Awareness Month, a time to educate, advocate, and celebrate those living with limb difference.",

    "text": "ORCHARD PARK, NY — Only in a climate like Buffalo’s could a January evening with temperatures in the teens qualify as pleasant.\nOf course, there was still plenty for fans to deal with Monday at Highmark Stadium, a little over 24 hours after the originally scheduled kickoff time. Many arrived to their seats to find a mound of snow remaining to either sit in, stand over or shovel out themselves.\nBut on the field, the Bills looked right at home in the frigid elements, outlasting the pesky Pittsburgh Steelers in a 31-17 Wild Card win.\nThat became evident as quickly as Buffalo’s first drive, as it efficiently cut through the Steelers defense for 80 yards in 10 plays. The Bills balanced five runs with five Josh Allen passes, all complete, through Dawson Knox’s 9-yard grab in the back of the end zone, which set off a euphoric display as fans tossed handfuls of snow to the sky.\nThose snow-tosses became a familiar scene as Bills touchdowns and Steeler turnovers mounted, especially after Allen’s 52-yard third-down scramble for a touchdown dealt a devastating blow to Pittsburgh’s upset hopes midway through the second quarter.\nThe snowballs became scarce as a 21-0 lead slowly dwindled to a one-score game early in the fourth quarter, 24-17, but made another big appearance on the dagger: a 17-yard touchdown pass from Allen to Khalil Shakir, as the second-year slot receiver slipped out of multiple tackles to cut through the heart of the Pittsburgh defense.\nTHE WIN sets up a visit from No. 3 Kansas City next Sunday in the divisional round, the Bills’ third playoff meeting with the Chiefs in the last four years, but their first at home.\n“We’re gonna need a fantastic atmosphere,” Allen said. “I thought the atmosphere tonight was great, guys and girls, Bills Mafia of all ages came in, did their job, forced a couple of false starts. And again, the vibe, the energy, the juice that we can use from that is ... you just can’t chalk it up to anything other than momentum, something you can’t see but something you can definitely feel, and they give that to us.”\nTHE WEATHER, naturally, disrupted both teams’ plans, with the midday decision Saturday coming from Governor Kathy Hochul’s office to move a Sunday 1 p.m. kickoff to Monday at 4:30. The Bills couldn’t meet as a team Sunday, snowed in and under a county driving ban. So they held a team stretch over Zoom, coach Sean McDermott noted, before online team meetings later in the day.\nMcDermott and Allen both made a point to thank Bills staffers for leading the stadium cleanup effort. McDermott, who was concerned the contest could be moved to a neutral site and cost his team a home game, also commended Hochul’s decision.\n“I know it didn’t stop snowing hard around here, at least until about 4 a.m. this morning, so I thought it was an admirable effort by everyone involved to get this game ready to be played and the streets, sidewalks, roads even getting here, cleared off,” he said.\n“It’s always hard to make decisions and I think the way that (Hochul) put the safety of the public first above the game, that just shows a lot about who she is and her care for people. All those who helped in the snow removal around this facility, around the stadium … the roads as well. I looked out my window a few times yesterday and it was hard to see.\n“So everyone that was out there working hard on the public’s behalf to make it safe to get to the game today, and then Bills Mafia showed up. I know that there weren’t always clean seats to sit on. But it didn’t seem like it mattered to them.”\nTHE WIN did come at a considerable cost, however. Second-year linebacker Terrel Bernard, perhaps the defense’s biggest breakout star, went down with an ankle injury, leaving on a cart with a towel on his head after well-wishes from several teammates.\nSeveral other defenders left the game, including fellow linebacker Baylon Spector and defensive backs Christian Benford and Taron Johnson, leaving an already injury-stricken unit — Rasul Douglas, Taylor Rapp and Tyrel Dodson were inactive — perilously thin.\nThat left A.J. Klein, who signed back to the practice squad Thursday and was a call-up Monday, to wear the “green dot” helmet for Bernard, receiving McDermott’s defensive play calls.\n“It’s hard to win in this league,” Allen said. “I hate to see guys go down on either side of the ball, really. And that’s one of the things I pray for before every game is making sure that both sides are safe from serious injury. I understand and I think everybody in the locker room understands the type of game that we play and what comes with it. It sucks though, when you’ve got guys that are playing at such a high level, guys that are young that are figuring things out and have an injury. We’ve got to figure it out and what’s gonna go on there and guys are gonna step up and it takes everybody.”\nNow begins a huge week, especially for McDermott, who will have to sort out who’s available to face Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and the Chiefs.\n“That’s a heck of an opponent,” McDermott said. “We’ll have to regroup as a staff and I know some of our staff has already been working on the Chiefs and that’s kind of what you do as a position coach, you’re able to look ahead a little bit. We’ll just have to sit down with Nate tomorrow and just try and see who’s healthy and when they’ll be healthy (if) they’re not healthy and then see what jersey numbers we have and kind of go from there.”",

    "text": "Le Canada fait état d’une augmentation de 300 % des décès de “causes non spécifiées”, ce qui suscite des demandes d’enquête\nUn nouveau rapport du gouvernement canadien révèle une augmentation de 300 % des \"causes non spécifiées\" de décès entre 2019 et 2022, les causes inconnues devenant la cinquième cause de décès au Canada. Certains experts de la santé ont déclaré que cette augmentation brutale devrait déclencher une enquête pour déterminer si les décès sont liés aux vaccins Covid-19.\nAlors que l’espérance de vie s’effondre au Canada, un nouveau\nrapport du gouvernement affirme que les “causes non spécifiées” sont devenues la cinquième cause de décès dans le pays, après le cancer, les maladies cardiaques, le Covid-19 et les accidents.\nD’après\nStatistique Canada les “causes non spécifiées” en 2022 ont dépassé les accidents vasculaires cérébraux, les anévrismes, la bronchite chronique, l’emphysème, l’asthme, le diabète, la grippe et la pneumonie, les maladies chroniques du foie et la cirrhose, la maladie d’Alzheimer et le suicide en tant que causes de décès.\nStatistique Canada, également connu sous le nom de StatCan, a publié le rapport le 27 novembre dans\nLe Quotidien, le bulletin d’information en ligne de l’agence.\nLe rapport a donné lieu à une série de titres presque identiques – fournis par le service national d’information du Canada – dans les principaux journaux du pays, à l’instar de celui-ci dans le\nToronto Sun: “L’espérance de vie des Canadiens a chuté pour la troisième année consécutive en 2022, selon StatCan”, suivi du sous-titre : “Plus de personnes sont mortes du Covid-19 en 2022 qu’en toute autre année depuis le début de la pandémie, selon le rapport”. André Picard, chroniqueur santé au Globe and Mail à Toronto, le journal de référence du Canada, a qualifié la baisse de l’espérance de vie, de 82,3 ans en 2019 à 81,3 ans en 2022, d’”énorme”.\n“C’est seulement la deuxième fois qu’une baisse aussi importante se produit au Canada au cours du siècle dernier”, a déclaré M. Picard. “En effet, l’espérance de vie ne cesse de progresser depuis des décennies : 71 ans en 1960, 75 ans en 1980, 79 ans en 2000 et 82,3 ans en 2019.”\nLe nombre de décès dus au Covid-19 au Canada a diminué, passant de 16 313 en 2020 à 14 466 en 2021, selon le rapport. Le Canada devrait enregistrer environ 7 000 décès dus au Covid-19 en 2023, a déclaré M. Picard.\nLes décès du Covid-19 ne peuvent expliquer l’augmentation de 7,3 % du nombre total de décès au Canada en 2022 par rapport à 2021, ni l’augmentation de 17 % du nombre total de décès par rapport à la norme historique de 2019, ni la baisse historique de l’espérance de vie, ni la baisse de\nl’espérance de vie au Canada et dans le monde, a déclaré M. Picard.\nComme de nombreux\njournalistes grand public et les responsables de la santé publique aux États-Unis qui examinent la baisse de l’espérance de vie aux États-Unis, M. Picard a blâmé les maladies chroniques, les surdoses de médicaments, les décès dus aux opioïdes, le tabagisme, les régimes alimentaires malsains et ” l’indifférence” comme étant les causes du déclin de la population au Canada. “Il n’existe pratiquement plus de mesures d’atténuation telles que le masquage, et les taux de vaccination ont fortement diminué”, écrit-il.\nMais les Drs\nPierre Kory et Peter McCullough ont déclaré à The Defender que le fait le plus important et le plus surprenant contenu dans le rapport est l’augmentation de 300%, entre 2019 et 2022, des “causes non spécifiées” de décès au Canada.\nLe Dr McCullough, cardiologue ayant fait l’objet de nombreuses publications et ayant mis au point un protocole de traitement précoce largement utilisé pour le Covid-19, a déclaré que l’augmentation spectaculaire du nombre de décès dus à des “causes non spécifiées” au Canada représente un changement sismique et inquiétant dans la médecine occidentale.\n“Avant la pandémie, la mortalité dans les pays occidentaux était bien comprise, a déclaré le Dr McCullough, avec 40 % de décès dus à des maladies cardiovasculaires connues, 40 % dus à des maladies néoplasiques terminales (cancer) et 20 % dus à d’autres causes connues telles que les homicides, les suicides, les surdoses de médicaments et les accidents.\nIl a ajouté :\n“Depuis le lancement des vaccins Covid-19, nous avons assisté à un nombre sans précédent de décès sans maladie préalable. Une grande série d’autopsies\npubliée par Hulscher et al a montré que 73,9 % des décès survenus après la vaccination par le Covid-19 étaient dus à des problèmes causés par les vaccins”.\nLe Dr McCullough a cité les centaines d’études portant sur les blessures et les décès consécutifs aux vaccins et aux protéines de pointe, ainsi que les millions de décès et de blessures signalés par les citoyens des États-Unis et d’Europe à leurs gouvernements à la suite de la vaccination par l’ARNm.\n“Tous les décès devraient être classés en fonction des doses et des dates de vaccination par le Covid-19”, a déclaré le Dr McCullough. Jusqu’à preuve du contraire, le “décès non spécifié” doit être attribué à un syndrome fatal de blessures dues au vaccin Covid-19″, a déclaré M. McCullough.\nLe Dr Kory, ancien professeur de médecine à l’Université du Wisconsin et président de l’Alliance de soins intensifs Front Line COVID-19 (\nFront Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance) a déclaré au Defender que les preuves sont accablantes et que les injections d’ARNm Covid-19 ont causé plus de décès et de blessures dans le monde occidental que tout autre médicament ou vaccin de l’histoire.\nLa réponse à la question de savoir pourquoi les “causes non spécifiées” sont aujourd’hui l’une des principales causes de décès est simple et évidente”, a déclaré le Dr Kory. “Cette cause est la seule intervention médicale que les gouvernements et les médias du monde entier ont défendue depuis le début [de la pandémie]. … La technologie de la plate-forme ARNm est, et a été, un échec colossal en termes d’efficacité et de sécurité”.\nLe Dr Kory et la journaliste Mary Beth Pfeiffer ont publié mardi un article\nd’opinion dans le journal The Hill demandant une étude publique afin d’étudier et de traiter le problème de l’augmentation historique de la mortalité dans le monde, qui n’a pas encore été reconnue par les autorités et qui n’a pas été rapportée par les principaux journalistes.\nLe 13 décembre, l’essai était le premier ou le deuxième article le plus populaire sur le site web de The Hill, qui revendique\n32,5 millions de visiteurs uniques par mois.\nLe 30 novembre, Robert Califf, commissaire de la Food and Drug Administration (FDA) des États-Unis, a publié une série de\nmessages extraordinaires sur X (anciennement Twitter) appelant à une approche “tous sur le pont” à l’échelle de la société pour résoudre le problème du déclin “catastrophique” de l’espérance de vie aux États-Unis.\n“Le JAMA Internal Medicine a publié au début du mois que notre espérance de vie globale est tombée à 76 ans et, fait remarquable, que l’espérance de vie des hommes aux États-Unis est tombée à 73 ans”, a écrit M. Califf.\nCependant, M. Kory a déclaré que l’article du commissaire de la FDA, “qui portait sur le tabagisme, l’alimentation, les maladies chroniques et les soins de santé, ignorait l’évidence : les gens meurent en nombre anormalement élevé, même aujourd’hui et depuis longtemps, depuis que le Covid a disparu. Pourtant, les agences de santé publique et les sociétés médicales restent silencieuses”.\nLa FDA et les grands médias ignorent le fait que les assureurs-vie ont tiré la sonnette d’alarme sur ces décès inattendus ou “excédentaires”. qui ont coûté la vie à 158 000 Américains de plus.\n158 000 Américains de plus au cours des neuf premiers mois de 2023 par rapport à la même période en 2019″, écrit M. Kory.\n“Cela dépasse les pertes combinées de l’Amérique dans\ntoutes les guerres depuis le Vietnam. Le Congrès devrait travailler d’urgence avec des experts en assurance pour enquêter sur cette tendance inquiétante”. Amy Kelly, COO de DailyClout et directrice du projet d’analyse des documents de Pfizer, a déclaré que pour qu’une autopsie aboutisse à un diagnostic correct d’un décès causé par un vaccin à ARNm, il faut que ” l’examen histopathologique de tissus prélevés sur l’ensemble du corps est nécessaire. La plupart du temps, même si une autopsie est pratiquée, l’examen histopathologique des tissus ne l’est pas”.\nElle a cité une interview du\nDr Arne Burkhardt qui décrit les types de tests que les coroners doivent effectuer mais qu’ils font rarement.\nLe Dr Robert Chandler, chirurgien orthopédique de Los Angeles qui a enseigné à la faculté de médecine de l’Université de Californie du Sud, a identifié “des catégories entières de nouvelles maladies” qu’il appelle\n les “Maladies CoVax” dans son étude des 450 000 pages de documents de Pfizer sur le vaccin Covid-19, documents que la FDA a été contrainte de divulguer à la suite d’une décision de justice, a déclaré Mme Kelly.\n“Il est logique que les causes de décès non spécifiées aient autant augmenté”, a déclaré Mme Kelly. Lorsqu’un patient meurt de plusieurs maladies en même temps ou d’un état pathologique inédit, ce qui se produit dans les deux cas avec les “maladies CoVax” identifiées par le Dr Chandler, j’imagine que de nombreux médecins et/ou médecins légistes ne savent pas comment classer ces causes de décès. Cela conduirait à classer les décès dans la catégorie “cause inconnue”.\nSelon Naomi Wolf, auteur de “\nFacing the Beast: Courage, Faith and Resistance in a New Dark Age,” (Faire face à la bête: Courage, foi et résistance dans un nouvel âge des ténèbres), “Dans le monde préindustriel, les gens mouraient mystérieusement. Mais dans le monde occidental moderne, il n’y a pas de mort mystérieuse. Chaque décès fait l’objet d’un certificat de décès qui, selon la loi, doit identifier la cause de la mort”.\n“Une augmentation mineure du nombre de décès non attribués est un problème qui nécessite une enquête”, a déclaré Mme Wolf. “Une augmentation importante, telle que celle que vous avez identifiée, n’indique pas un mystère de masse pour les médecins et les coroners, mais témoigne plutôt d’un problème dans la tenue des registres de l’État – une malfaisance bureaucratique à grande échelle”.\nMike Capuzzo\nhttps://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/le-canada-fait-etat-dune-augmentation-de-300-des-deces-de-causes-non-specifiees-ce-qui-suscite-des-demandes-denquete/?lang=fr Mike Capuzzo, https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/le-canada-fait-etat-dune-augmentation-de-300-des-deces-de-causes-non-specifiees-ce-qui-suscite-des-demandes-denquete/?lang=fr, 2023",
