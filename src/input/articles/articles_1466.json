    "text": "Men 2 Be, an organization focused on uplifting young boys to reach their fullest potential, needs your help. They have taken on the significant task of restoring a dilapidated building to serve the entire community.\n“Attucks is a beacon light,” said alumna Teresa Moss. “We should continue to let that light shine.”\nNamed after the Black man who was the first American to die in the Revolutionary War, Crispus Attucks High School was a safe place for students like Moss during segregation.\n“They taught us from the ground up,” explained Moss. “They taught us to be mannerable. They taught us to have dignity. They taught us to speak well.”\nOpened in 1916, Crispus Attucks High School was the first and only Black high school in the area. In the 1960s, it became an integrated middle school until it closed its doors in 1988. Moss says that now, more than ever, preserving this history is important.\n“Attucks is a historical site, and many historical sites like Attucks are being destroyed or eliminated,” added Moss.\nThat’s why the alumni association gifted the building to Men 2 Be last year for one dollar. Since 2020, they’ve mentored hundreds of young boys, empowering them to chase their dreams.\n“We teach everyday life skills,” explained Men 2 Be co-founder LaDessa Lewis. “We teach them how to be productive citizens in the community.”\nThey are raising one million dollars to transform the building into a center that offers support to those in need.\n“A place where people can get resources, a place where people can have recreation, a place for even residential support for our seniors in the community,” added Lewis.\nThey dream of creating a space that uplifts not only the Black community but everyone in the area.\n“That's what it's about. It's about love and helping,” said alumna Arnethia Stepp.\nA benefit concert is scheduled for Saturday, April 26th, at 5 p.m. at the Bridge of Hope Fellowship.\nPictures in our story from the high school were from the\nMuseums of Historic Hopkinsville-Christian County.\nDo you have more information about this story? You can email me at Patsy.Montesinos@NewsChannel5.com.\nThe line ''see something, say something\" took on new meaning recently in Bowling Green. Two alert neighbors helped tip police to stolen Corvettes from the nearby assembly plant. That led law enforcement to find 8 stolen Corvettes worth over $1 million. We may all be able to learn a little lesson from this.\n-Lelan Statom",

    "text": "- Crystal Palace are considering replacing Roy Hodgson with Steve Cooper\n- Officials believe they would not have to pay compensation to old side Forest\n- Chris Sutton and Ian Ladyman give their best sporting moments of the year on It’s All Kicking Off\nCrystal Palace believe they are clear to appoint Steve Cooper without paying compensation to Nottingham Forest amid growing uncertainty over Roy Hodgson’s position.\nHowever, Palace could face difficulty convincing Cooper to make a quick return to management following his City Ground departure last week, with sources indicating the Welshman is minded to take a short break from football.\nHodgson’s role is under scrutiny after eight games without a win, and tomorrow’s match against Brentford is crucial for his prospects. Defeat could prove the final straw for Palace chiefs.\nMail Sport understands there is already a feeling among members of the club’s hierarchy that a change is needed. Others are reluctant to part ways with the highly-respected boss before the summer.\nCooper’s sacking at Forest last week has become a factor as Palace contemplate their next move. The former Swansea manager is admired at Palace and has long been viewed as a potential successor to 76-year-old Hodgson.\nCrystal Palace believe they are clear to appoint ex-Forest boss Steve Cooper without paying compensation\nPalace chiefs – led by chairman Steve Parish (R) – feel that a change may be needed after eight games without a win under Roy Hodgson (L)\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nIt is understood Cooper is not subject to a period of gardening leave by Forest, meaning he can be appointed by his next club without a compensation fee.\nPalace chiefs had hoped Hodgson would see out the season before the club appointed a younger manager to implement a new approach. But Cooper’s availability, coupled with the team’s poor form, may force Palace into accelerating their vision, though that will depend on whether the 44-year-old is open to returning to work.\nIpswich boss Kieran McKenna also features on Palace’s list of candidates to replace Hodgson, while assistant manager Paddy McCarthy has impressed as part of the backroom team and could be elevated to the top job on a short-term basis.\nIf Palace lose to Brentford in their next game it will only pile the pressure on Hodgson\nIT’S ALL KICKING OFF!\nIt’s All Kicking Off is an exciting new podcast from Mail Sport that promises a different take on Premier League football, with a show every Monday and Thursday this season.\nIt is available on MailOnline, Mail+, YouTube , Apple Music and Spotify\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n***\nRead more at DailyMail.co.uk",

    "title": "Monsalve contradice a Juan Andrés Lagos y afirma que le comunicó personalmente la decisión de removerlo de Interior",
    "text": "El subsecretario del Interior, Manuel Monsalve, se refirió la tarde de este jueves a la controversia por desvinculación del asesor Juan Andrés Lagos (PC). Desde La Moneda, la autoridad de gobierno señaló: “En materia laboral tengo una práctica más allá del rol que me corresponde hoy día como subsecretario del Interior: Todas las personas que dependen directamente de mí, siempre hablo con ellas previo a contratarlas. Y si en algún momento considero necesario terminar esa relación laboral, siempre hablo con ellos previo a terminar esa relación. No hay excepción al respecto, ninguna”. “Uno no cuestiona esas decisiones”: Tohá responde por remoción de Juan Andrés Lagos de Interior tras críticas del PC Paulina Vodanovic respalda decisión de Monsalve por la salida de Juan Andrés Lagos y llama a los partidos a terminar con la pólemica Monsalve sostuvo que “durante estos días se han producido varios cambios al interior de la Subsecretaría del Interior. Uno a nivel de asesores, dos a nivel de jefe de división”. “Son cargos que dependen directamente de mí. Y por tanto, con todas esas personas antes de contratarlas siempre hablé (con ellas) y antes de que se termine el contrato siempre hablé con todas ellas”, expresó. 27/06/2024 MANUEL MONSALVE, SUBSECRETARIO DEL INTERIOR MARIO TELLEZ / LA TERCERA En cuanto a las razones para remover a la figura del Partido Comunista del cargo de asesor de la subsecretaría, dijo: “Las decisiones tienen un solo fin. Los roles que cumple la subsecretaría del Interior son extraordinariamente relevantes para el país. Y todas las decisiones que toman las subsecretarias del Interior son pensando en cumplir las funciones del gobierno”. Y luego agregó: “Cumplir bien esas funciones, porque para el país son extraordinariamente importantes. Siempre las razones van a ser esas, no hay ninguna otra razón”. Previo a estas declaraciones de Monsalve, en privado en La Moneda aseguraban que el martes Lagos visitó el palacio presidencial -algo que no hacía todos los días por su condición de contratado a honorarios- y tuvo una conversación con el subsecretario, en la que había otros asesores, en que se zanjó su salida. La narrativa de Palacio y del subsecretario difiere de los dichos del ahora exasesor y también de la cúpula del PC representada por su presidente Lautaro Carmona. Esta mañana, Lagos se refirió por primera vez a su remoción en diálogo con Radio Nuevo Mundo y relató los días previos. “Para ser estrictamente riguroso, yo en las semanas pasadas tuve intercambio, a propósito de esta presión que se generó y se venía generando desde la derecha”, partió señalando.

Incluso, agregó, “ahí se hizo todo un procedimiento de trabajo para que toda esta presión no dañara el trabajo de la Subsecretaría en particular”. “Pero a mí nunca se me dijo que estaba ad portas de una situación que iba a concluir con mi salida. Eso no se me dijo”, afirmó. Carmona, en tanto, en un punto de prensa desde la sede de la colectividad -flanqueado por el propio Lagos- aseguró que no estaba al tanto de la decisión y que se enteró de la noticia por la prensa, es decir, tras la publicación de La Tercera de este miércoles. Es más, el timonel elevó el tono e indicó que “en estas 24 horas todavía no tengo ninguna explicación. Insisto, no es obligación, es solo si uno quiere. Una explicación al que está a cargo del PC, que es la condición de la militancia de Juan Andrés Lagos, y que de eso se hizo todo un debate público, particularmente de parte de la derecha, exigiendo incluso la salida por su condición de comunista”. Figueroa reitera críticas del PC por remoción de Juan Andrés Lagos de Interior y apunta a falta de “cortesía” del gobierno Carmona afirma que tras salida de Lagos no ha recibido “ninguna explicación” y acusa campaña para descalificar al exasesor por su militancia",

    "title": "‘Govt raising Hijab issue to cover up its failures’: Bommai",
    "text": "Bengaluru: As the hijab controversy flares up in Karnataka, former Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai accused current CM Siddaramaiah of hiding the failures of his government as well as raising the issue for only political gains. He told reporters here on Saturday that the Hijab was not banned all over the state but not allowed where there was a dress code. Muslim women are permitted to wear the hijab everywhere. “When the Hijab is not banned where is the question of lifting the ban,” he questioned. “As per the comprehensive education policy, the school uniform policy came into being but it was brought into effect by the previous government. Siddaramaiah has spoken about the withdrawal of the Hijab ban order when the case was still pending in the Supreme Court. The issue has been raised only for political gains which would be condemned in the strongest words,” Bommai said. Sparking a series of discussions, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah announced in a public meeting that his government will lift the ban on hijab imposed by the previous BJP government in the state. “We are thinking of withdrawing the decision (of hijab ban). We will discuss it. I have said this in response to a question. We have not done it yet,” the Chief Minister added. CM Siddaramaiah said in his speech that no politics should be done on what people prefer to wear and eat. “There was a drought in the state, and the women didn’t have protection. The government was so bankrupt that it had stopped making the children clean toilets. To cover up all these failures, the Congress leaders were making such statements to mislead people. They did the same thing when the IT raid on a contractor yielded crores of rupees. The incumbent government was not at all interested in development. The government has a sinister design of creating a rift among the kids,” he added. Bommai said the Hijab issue was being discussed at the international level and the women in Iran and Iraq have launched a struggle seeking freedom against the Hijab. What was the need for the CM to make a statement on the row when the apex court was seized of the matter? “I am confident that the court will take note of the same,” he asserted.",
