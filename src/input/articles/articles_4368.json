    "text": "A lot has been said about Randeep Hooda's physical transformation for his latest film Swatantrya Veer Savarkar. Also helmed by Hooda, it is a biopic of freedom fighter Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. For the movie, the actor lost almost 32 kilos. Not just that, to get into the role mentally, he locked himself in a cell at the Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where Savarkar was kept.Randeep Hooda felt Savarkar's presence “I started feeling like Savarkar was the director himself,” he said on BeerBiceps podcast. When asked if he ever felt Savarkar’s presence on set, the actor-director replied, “Yes, in every frame. There were times when I really felt that. I used to feel sometimes, while working, I used to see a shadow, of myself sometimes, and I used to think, ‘Wow, that looks like Vinayak Damodar Savarkar’.”Randeep Hooda on shooting in Kaala PaaniRecalling his experience in the prison, popularly known as Kaala Paani, Randeep said, “I was okay for a while, but then, I felt the walls crashing down on me. I started screaming for help, but my voice wouldn’t travel. I became claustrophobic, I began to lose my breath.”He also spoke about the ghostly silence at night. The actor said that he was able to sense the people who were once imprisoned there. He added that he had taken a big team for the jail sequence, however, nobody dared to wander too far. Swatantrya Veer Savarkar released in the theatres on March 22. The movie opened up to mixed reviews from the audience, however, Hooda's performance has been praised by one and all. It has minted Rs 11.35 crore at the box office so far.",

    "text": "- Agricultores irão se beneficiar das soluções agronômicas digitais e automatizadas\n- Inovações digitais aceleradas promovem a agricultura de precisão, eficiência de recursos e sustentabilidade\n- Primeiro lançamento da joint venture será realizado no Brasil, seguido pela Europa e América do Norte\nA Bosch e a BASF Digital Farming assinaram um acordo de joint venture (JV) 50/50 para comercializar soluções agrícolas inteligentes. O acordo da JV foi assinado em 10 de novembro de 2020 e será seguido pela fundação de uma nova empresa com sede em Colônia, que será estabelecida no primeiro trimestre de 2021. A criação da JV está sujeita à aprovação das autoridades antitruste competentes. Ambas as partes concordaram em não divulgar os detalhes financeiros.\nA Bosch traz para a JV uma grande capacidade em hardware e software, bem como em serviços digitais. A BASF Digital Farming com xarvio™ Digital Farming Solutions oferece uma ferramenta automatizada para as tomadas de decisões agronômicas específicas no campo, em tempo real, para o manejo de plantas daninhas. Assim, os agricultores recebem orientação sobre como produzir de forma mais sustentável.\nAo combinar a experiência de ambas as empresas, com soluções de hardware e software modernos, os agricultores terão maior facilidade e conveniência na adoção das soluções digitais.\nPulverizar e economizar\n“Ao associar os implementos agrícolas usando sensores de alta tecnologia, softwares inteligentes e produtos digitais, podemos tornar a agricultura do amanhã mais eficiente e, ao mesmo tempo, mais sustentável”, disse Andrew Allen, responsável mundial da Divisão de Veículos Comerciais e Off-Road do grupo Bosch.\n“Ambas as empresas estão empenhadas em investir tempo e recursos em atividades conjuntas que levarão ao desenvolvimento de novas tecnologias sustentáveis de precisão que melhoram as práticas e os resultados agrícolas”, disse Vincent Gros, presidente da Divisão de Soluções para Agricultura da BASF.\nOs dois primeiros produtos a serem lançados serão uma versão do sistema Intelligent Planting Solution (IPS), com inteligência digital aprimorada para semeadura e recomendação da necessidade de fertilizantes, e o Smart Spraying, solução que combina a tecnologia de sensor de câmera da Bosch e o software com a plataforma xarvio™ para otimização de recursos nos cultivos. Os dois produtos foram testados em condições reais a campo. Essas práticas inovadoras de agricultura digital de precisão possibilitam a otimização de recursos, apoiando os agricultores e o meio ambiente.\nA tecnologia Smart Spraying, por exemplo, apresenta uma otimização de até 70% nos volumes de herbicida no estágio experimental. A solução deverá ser lançada com um número limitado de máquinas em 2021.",
