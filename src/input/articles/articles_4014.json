    "text": "(Adnkronos) – L’Ucraina prosegue l’attacco nella regione russa di Kursk e usa bombe americane. Intanto, Vladimir Putin delinea la road map per riconquistare il territorio invaso da Kiev e fissa anche una scadenza.\nL’offensiva delle forze armate ucraine rimane sotto i riflettori nella guerra iniziata da oltre 900 giorni. L’operazione ha l’obiettivo di mettere fine alla guerra “alle condizioni di un’Ucraina indipendente”, dice il presidente ucraino, Volodymyr Zelensky, sottolineando che per mettere fine alla guerra è necessario creare quanti più problemi possibili allo Stato russo sul suo territorio.\n“Tutti dobbiamo capire che per espellere l’occupante dalla nostra terra, dobbiamo creare quanti più problemi possibili allo Stato russo sul suo territorio. Questo è il lavoro eroico dei nostri soldati. E questo lavoro eroico più è accurato, più è a lungo raggio e più è efficace”, aggiunge. L’aeronautica militare ucraina riferisce intanto di aver usato bombe americane ad alta precisione, del modello GBU-39, per colpire obiettivi militari russi nella regione di Kursk. “Gli Stati Uniti potrebbero fermare le azioni dell’Ucraina schioccando le dita”, dice nelle stesse ore Anatoly Antonov, ambiasciatore russo a Washington.\nPrende la parola anche Putin, che denuncia il tentativo ucraino di “colpire una centrale nucleare. L’Agenzia internazionale per l’energia atomica ne è stata informata e ha promesso di inviare degli specialisti per valutare la situazione. Spero che alla fine questo verrà fatto da parte loro”, dice il presidente russo, citato dall’agenzia Tass.\nLa condotta di Putin è sotto i riflettori dall’inizio dell’offensiva ucraina. Gli analisti dell’Institute for the study of war (Isw), think tank americano che monitora il conflitto, fa riferimento ad una campagna di comunicazione avviata dal Cremlino: l’obiettivo sarebbe quello di rendere ‘accettabile’ per l’opinione pubblica la limitata presenza di soldati ucraini nel territorio russo.\nSi tratterebbe, come hanno confermato fonti governative russe all’outlet indipendente Meduza, di una sorta di ‘imprevisto’ che non deve oscurare la priorità: la campagna russa nel Donetsk, caratterizzata da progressi delle forze di Mosca negli ultimi giorni e destinata a concludersi con la sconfitta ‘inevitabile’ di Kiev.\nPutin non ha intenzione di formalizzare l’emergenza nella regione di Kursk e per questo le elezioni per il nuovo governatore, in programma a settembre, rimangono in calendario. Le informazioni raccolte da Meduza delineano un quadro attendista dalle parti di Mosca: tutte le fonti russe interpellate si aspettano che le ostilità nel Kursk durino mesi, con l’elevata probabilità che il Cremlino continui a privilegiare le operazioni nel Donetsk e non disponga la redistribuzione di truppe sul proprio territorio.\nDiverso il panorama tratteggiato dalla testata ucraina RBC: Putin ha chiesto di liberare Kursk entro il primo ottobre e l’obiettivo va centrato senza l’ausilio di reparti attualmente schierati nelle aree di Pokrovsk e Toretsk, nell’Ucraina orientale. Le forze armate di Kiev sono entrate in Russia il 6 agosto. Se anche la scadenza fissata da Putin venisse rispettata, il Cremlino dovrebbe giustificare la presenza degli invasori sul suolo nazionale per circa 2 mesi.\nIl presidente avrebbe preso in considerazione una nuova mobilitazione per contrastare l’avanzata nemica, ma l’ipotesi sarebbe stata accantonata per le ricadute che un simile provvedimento avrebbe sull’economia. Rimane sullo sfondo la possibilità di continuare ad utilizzare coscritti, soldati di leva, nella regione di Kursk. Putin, all’inizio della guerra, ha annunciato che i coscritti non sarebbero stati impiegati in prima linea. Proprio giovanissimi militari di leva, però, circa 2 settimane fa si sono trovati a contrastare – con risultati pessimi – l’incursione ucraina.",

    "title": "Imprisoned Preacher Li Shuangping of Linfen Golden Lampstand Church Unable to Bid Farewell to His Deceased Mother",
    "text": "( Linfen, Shanxi Province – February 14, 2025) On January 16, 2025, the 89-year-old mother of Li Shuangping, a Christian from Linfen Golden Lampstand Church in Shanxi, passed away due to illness. Li Shuangping, who has been imprisoned for over three years due to his Christian faith, was unable to bid farewell to his mother. Lawyers have requested bail from judicial authorities to allow him to attend his mother’s funeral on January 20, but have yet to receive a response.\nLi Shuangping, a key member of Linfen Golden Lampstand Church, was arrested on August 7, 2021, along with 12 other church co-workers including Preacher Yang Rongli and Pastor Wang Xiaoguang, on “suspected fraud” charges by local police. The case has not gone to trial in over three years. During this time, relatives of two detained Christians have passed away – besides Li Shuangping’s mother, Zhao Aiguo’s husband died on December 3, 2023, and in both cases, lawyers’ requests for bail were denied.\nThe Linfen Golden Lampstand Church is a large house church that has faced repeated persecution and suppression for maintaining its house church position and refusing to join the Three-Self Patriotic Church. On November 25, 2009, the Yaodu District Court in Linfen sentenced Preacher Yang Rongli to seven years in prison with a fine of 30,000 yuan, Wang Xiaoguang to three years with a fine of 10,000 yuan, Yang Xuan to three and a half years with a fine of 20,000 yuan, Cui Jiaxing to five and a half years with a fine of 50,000 yuan, and Zhang Huamei to four years on charges of “illegal occupation of farmland” and “gathering crowds to disturb traffic order.”\nOn November 30 of the same year, Li Shuangping and his wife, along with five other church leaders, were sentenced to two years of re-education through labor. Subsequently, all thirty-plus meeting venues of the church were sealed, and the church building, constructed with 17 million yuan in donations from church members, was forcibly demolished by the government on January 9, 2018. Pastor Wang Xiaoguang was released in 2012, and Sister Yang Rongli was released in 2016.\nOn August 7, 2021, Yang Rongli, Wang Xiaoguang, and 12 other Christians were arrested again. Six were later released on bail, while Pastor Wang Xiaoguang, Yang Rongli, Li Shuangping, Dong Yongyong, Zhao Guoai, and Huo Zhuangping have been detained in custody for over three years.\nDuring these three years, pre-trial meetings for the case were scheduled three times. The first was decided by the prosecutor but was canceled when a chief prosecutor was arrested for suspected corruption. The second was internally determined by the Shanxi Public Security Department and signed by the Political and Legal Affairs Commission secretary, demanding life sentences for Yang Rongli, Li Shuangping, and others. This was canceled when a deputy police chief in charge of the case was arrested. The third trial was originally scheduled for October 22, 2024, but was suddenly canceled, with no new trial date announced.\nLi Shuangping’s mother fell and fractured a bone on the morning of December 28, 2024. Due to her age, surgery was not possible. Her condition worsened on December 31, and she was admitted to intensive care.\nLawyers’ requests for Li Shuangping’s bail were denied. Li Shuangping has been detained in custody since his arrest and hadn’t seen his mother for three and a half years. His elderly mother had been hoping to see her son one last time, and lawyers repeatedly requested the Yaodu District Court to grant Li Shuangping bail to fulfill his filial duties and care for his elderly mother on her sickbed. However, until his mother’s death, the lawyers’ requests were not approved.\nLi Shuangping's mother in serious illness. Source - Video screenshot Since Li Shuangping’s mother fell seriously ill, Christians from the Wucun Township House Church in Linfen have faced widespread threats from national security agents, including Li Shuangping’s family members.\nOn the morning of his mother’s death, between 10:30 AM and 11:00 AM, police from the Yaodu District National Security Brigade came to the home of Li Shuangping’s mother and brother, loudly questioning his sister-in-law about why she was still checking in for Bible reading in the church’s online group. When his sister-in-law asked them to lower their voices because of the sick elderly mother in the house, the national security agent said, “What does it matter to me if the old person lives or dies!” and continued arguing with Li’s family. Shortly after they left, at 12:10 PM, the elderly mother passed away.\nIn recent years, several church pastors and co-workers who were arrested for their faith were unable to bid farewell to their mothers who passed away while they were in prison:\nOn August 3, 2022, at dawn, Deyang Qingcaodi Church’s Elder Hao Ming’s mother Yin Zhixiu passed away. Elder Hao Ming, detained in prison, neither knew about his mother’s death nor could bid her farewell. During the 2024 Spring Festival, Bengbu Cornerstone Reformed Church’s Elder Xue Shaoqiang’s mother died of illness. Elder Xue, charged with “suspected fraud” due to his Christian faith and detained in Bengbu Detention Center, could not bid farewell to his mother. His mother passed away with regret, unable to fulfill her last wish of seeing her son. On March 15, 2024, the 79-year-old mother of three siblings – Zhu Longfei, Zhu Longjiang, and Zhu Qiaoling from Guangdong Shengjia Church – died of illness. The three siblings, all detained in custody, could neither make a final farewell at the hospital before their mother’s death nor attend her funeral, leaving them with lifelong regret. In September 2024, Guiyang Ren’ai Reformed Church’s Elder Zhang Chunlei’s mother Zhou Qiurong from suddenly passed away. Elder Zhang Chunlei, serving his sentence, could not bid final farewell to his mother before her death.\nBeing unable to fulfill one’s duties as a son or daughter before and after a mother’s death is a regrettable life event. This is the price preachers and believers of this era pay to maintain their faith.\n(Reported by Special Correspondent Ningmeng for ChinaAid )",

    "text": "Google ‌ refuses to open Android to everyone”/>\nThe American company Google has filed⁤ a formal petition asking to ⁢postpone the implementation of a court ⁣decision on disclosing the Android operating system to rival developers.\nAs Day.Az​ reports⁤ with reference⁢ to⁤ the ​Android Authority publication, in early October of​ this year, a federal court in San Francisco ruled in ⁣favor of the game⁣ publisher ⁣Epic, which accused⁤ Google ​of monopolization. ⁢The‍ court ‌ordered the company to open access to the Android OS and ⁢the Google ‍Play ⁣store for competitors. The⁣ response ‍to this decision was Google’s appeal and request to review the timing of‌ the changes.\nIn their petition, company ​representatives expressed concern that they ⁤have only ‍three​ weeks to‍ make Android ‍and its services as accessible as possible⁢ to other developers. Google’s legal⁤ department warned that such ‍changes could pose security risks to users of the Android ecosystem. In this regard, the company insists on the need to defer‍ the⁢ execution ⁤of‌ the court decision.\nGoogle also indicated that opening⁤ the services could threaten the‌ security of more than 100 million Android ⁣smartphone users in‍ the United States.​ The company will also⁢ need⁢ more time to renegotiate ⁤agreements with the “hundreds of‍ thousands”⁤ of ⁤partners with whom it has‍ contracts.\nThe next hearing ‍in the case will⁢ take place on⁤ October 18, when the court will consider Google’s request for⁤ a delay.\nHow​ might a more open Android ecosystem foster ⁢innovation in mobile app development? Title: The ‌Future of Android: An Exclusive Interview with Tech Expert Dr. Emily Chen\nSetting: A sleek, modern conference room at Time.news headquarters. ​The room is equipped with⁣ the ‍latest gadgets and has a large window that‌ offers a view of the bustling‌ city below.\nParticipants:\nAlex Mercer – Editor of Time.news Dr. Emily Chen – Tech expert ⁢and author of “Navigating​ the Digital Frontier” Alex Mercer: Thank you⁤ for joining us today, Dr. Chen. It’s a pleasure to have you here to discuss Google’s recent decision not ​to open up Android to all developers. This ⁤has sparked quite‍ a debate in ⁢the tech community.\nDr.‌ Emily Chen: ‍Thank you for having me, Alex. It’s‍ a topic that ⁣certainly deserves some close examination, ‌given its implications‍ for developers, users,‌ and even the broader tech landscape.\nAlex Mercer: To start, could you break down what exactly Google’s decision entails and why it⁢ is significant?\nDr. Emily Chen: ⁣ Certainly. Google’s refusal to open Android fully means that the platform will continue to have a controlled ecosystem ‌where not all developers​ can access ⁣the core features⁤ of Android. This means ‍limited competition and potentially stifled innovation.⁤ The significance lies in how this decision⁤ impacts developers who are ‌eager to create new ‍applications, as well as users who may benefit from ⁢more ​diverse options.\nAlex Mercer: You mentioned stifled innovation. Could you ⁤elaborate on that and how it could affect the future of Android?\nDr. Emily Chen: Absolutely. When a platform is closed off, it limits the pool of creativity and ideas that can thrive. For example,‌ if only a ‌few‌ developers have the ability to access certain⁣ features of Android, we miss out on unique applications that ‌could significantly enhance user experience or introduce groundbreaking functionalities. A closed ecosystem can lead to ​stagnation.\nAlex​ Mercer: That’s a compelling point. However, some ‍argue that Google aims to maintain stability and security through‍ this control. How do you balance the need for ‌a stable platform against ‌the call for ​open access?\nDr. Emily Chen: It’s ‌a delicate balance, for sure. Stability and security are⁣ paramount, especially in today’s environment where privacy concerns are at an all-time high. That said, there are ways to implement an open system while maintaining rigorous security protocols. Open-source models have shown that it’s possible to⁣ innovate and keep security in check. Google needs ⁢to consider a hybrid ‍approach where they can allow more access while still safeguarding users.\nAlex Mercer: It sounds like you’re advocating for more flexibility within the system. What ‌kinds of changes would you‍ suggest⁤ to ‌Google to ⁣encourage more openness without compromising safety?\nDr. ‍Emily Chen: I’d recommend that ⁤Google establish a tiered ‍access system for developers. This system could​ allow ⁣vetted developers to gain deeper access to Android’s core functionalities while maintaining a higher ⁣level of monitoring and security protocols. Additionally, they⁤ could invest in community-driven initiatives or sandboxes where developers‌ can ⁣experiment safely.\nAlex Mercer: Interesting ‌approach! With the rise​ of‌ competitors like‍ Apple and emerging OS platforms, how do you see Google’s strategy impacting​ its market share in the coming years?\nDr. Emily Chen: If Google remains⁢ steadfast⁣ in its⁣ closed approach, it risks alienating developers and, ultimately, users who crave ⁢innovative options. Competitors who embrace more open environments‍ may gain traction, particularly among users who prioritize⁤ freedom⁤ over ​the stability that Google offers. ⁢There is undoubtedly a⁤ competitive landscape in flux, and⁤ how Google ‍navigates‌ this could significantly impact its market share.\nAlex Mercer: As we wrap up, what advice do you have for developers in this current climate?\nDr. Emily Chen: My advice would be​ to​ stay informed and ⁤adaptable.⁣ Engage with community platforms and‌ look for⁣ opportunities to collaborate. Even within​ a closed ⁤environment, there are niches to ⁢explore. Additionally, consider⁤ diversifying your skills across different platforms to remain competitive in the ⁤evolving tech ecosystem.\nAlex⁢ Mercer: Wise words, Dr. Chen. Thank you‍ so much for your insights today. This⁣ discussion opens up many avenues for further exploration in the tech ⁣industry.\nDr. Emily Chen: Thank you for‍ having me, Alex. It ‌was ⁣a pleasure discussing such an important topic!\n[End of Interview]",
