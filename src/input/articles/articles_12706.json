    "text": "WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. — About 300 people lined up outside in the bitter cold—all to make their way into the first Wawa to open in the Williamsport area. Some came as early as 5 a.m. to be first in line to receive free coffee and a t-shirt.\n\"I love Wawa, and I've always grown up with Wawa, and I think it's way better than Sheetz. I just can't wait to have this one open finally,\" said John Swider, Philadelphia.\nCustomers tell Newswatch 16 they're happy to have a staple from their hometowns right in Central Pennsylvania.\n\"I came from New Jersey a very long time ago here, and I lived near Wawa's all my life up until I moved here; we don't have one, and I'm so excited,\" said Bert Hall, Williamsport.\n\"I used to go to Wawa in Jersey every morning, and I was happy to see it come here, so I came here, I got my coffee, I got my t-shirt, I can come here every morning now,\" said William Colon, Williamsport.\n\"Whether it's folks who have moved from the Philadelphia area or folks who travel maybe from Central Pennsylvania over to New Jersey have seen our stores and just how much how they would love to have a Wawa in their community,\" said Alyson Mucha, Wawa Public Relations Lead.\nThe Wawa in Williamsport marks the company's sixth location in Central Pennsylvania.\n\"The reception in Williamsport and in the Central Pennsylvania market overall has been so welcoming, and it feels like we fit right in with Williamsport, and Williamsport fits right in with us,\" said Mucha\nOver the next five years, Wawa plans to open 40 locations in Central Pennsylvania.",

    "text": "Pope on Palestine and Israel: ‘No to war. Yes to dialogue’\nFrom the Vatican new call for peace in the Middle East. But also a thought for the ‘tormented Ukraine’ that ‘suffers so much’. Best wishes to the brothers and sisters of the Orthodox Churches for Easter celebrated today, according to the Julian calendar. ‘May the Risen Lord comfort the communities that are in trial’.\nVatican City (AsiaNews) - ‘I affectionatley send my best wishes to the brothers and sisters of the Orthodox Churches and some Eastern Catholic Churches who are celebrating Holy Easter today, according to the Julian calendar,’ began the Angelus address of Pope Francis this Sunday, delievered from the window of the Vatican Apostolic Palace this morning immediately after the recitation of the Regina Caeli prayer.\n‘May the Risen Lord fill all communities with joy and peace and comfort those who are in trial. Happy Easter to them!’ The wish was greeted by the crowd gathered in St. Peter's with applause; a holiday celebrated six weeks after Catholic Easter, which follows the Gregorian calendar.\nThere was no shortage of appeals for peace. ‘Please, let us continue to pray for the tormented Ukraine. It suffers so much,' the Pontiff said. A suffering thought was also addressed to the Middle East.\nThis was followed by a request to pray also for ‘Palestine and Israel’. ‘May there be peace’: these were the words greeted by further roaring applause.\n‘So that the dialogue between them may be strengthened and bear good fruit. No to war. Yes to dialogue,' he said. The Pontiff then recalled the population of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, hit by violent floods. ‘I assure my prayers,’ he said, ‘that the Lord may welcome the dead, comfort their families, and those who had to leave their homes. Thousands - about 70,000 - have been displaced.\nBefore the recitation of the Regina Caeli Marian prayer, Pope Francis commented on the Gospel of the Day (Jn 15:9-17), in which Jesus speaks to the disciples saying ‘You are my friends’.\nHe continued: ‘This I command you: that you love one another’. The Pontiff elaborated on the meaning of being called ‘friends’ instead of ‘servants’. The latter, he explained, are ‘special people’ - among them Moses, the prophet Elijah and the Virgin Mary - to whom God entrusts important missions. ‘But all this is not enough, according to Jesus, to say who we are for Him,’ said Pope Francis.\nIndeed, it takes ‘something greater, which goes beyond goods and projects themselves: it takes friendship’. Friendship takes various forms depending on the age one goes through: it evolves as time advances. Pope Francis shared examples of these, set in the various moments of life. As children, it is expressed through the practice of offering friends ‘our most beautiful toys and gifts’; as teenagers by confiding to them ‘our first secrets’; as young people by offering friends ‘loyalty’; as adults by sharing ‘satisfactions and worries’; and as old people by sharing ‘memories’ and ‘silences’.\nThe Holy Father then asked them to turn their thoughts to ‘our friends, our friends’, thanking the Lord for their presence. He then invited the faithful gathered in St Peter's Square on today's spring day to carve out ‘a space to think of them’. A few moments of recollection followed.\nFrancis then explained that friendship ‘is not the fruit of calculation, nor of compulsion’, but is born instead from the spontaneity of recognising ‘in the other something of us’. In fact, if it is ‘true’ it is capable of surviving even in the face of ‘betrayal’, just ‘as Jesus shows us when he says to Judas, who betrays him with a kiss, ’Friend, that is why you are here! (Mt 26:50),’ the Pontiff continued. ‘A true friend does not abandon you, not even when you make a mistake: he corrects you, perhaps rebukes you, but he forgives you and does not abandon you’.\nFrom the passage from the Gospel according to John commented on this morning, it is understood that for Jesus ‘we are just that, friends’; that is, ‘dear people beyond all merit and all expectation, to whom he extends his hand and offers his love’.\nAt the end of the speech that preceded the Regina Caeli, Pope Francis addressed some questions to those listening, useful for integrating the Word with the life of each person. ‘What face does the Lord have for me? The face of a friend or a stranger?’ But also: ‘Do I feel loved by Him as a loved one?’. Finally, he asked for Mary's support so that we might ‘grow in friendship with her Son and spread it around us’.",

    "text": "Arsenal pagó cara su falta de contundencia este jueves y pese a ser superior sobre el césped ante West Ham, cayó derrotado como local por 2-0. Duro resultado para el conjunto que dirige Mikel Arteta, pues con esta derrota perdió la posibilidad de mantenerse como líder de la Premier League. Los Gunners eran una tromba, pero para sorpresa de propios y extraños, la visita se puso en ventaja con algo de polémica. Una pelota que parecía irse fue rescatada por Jarrod Bowen, quien asistió a Tomas Soucek, quien enmudeció el Emirates Stadium. El VAR revisó la acción para determinar si la pelota había salido en su totalidad antes de que Bowen le cediera el balón al autor del gol. Tras varios minutos de deliberación, los encargados de revisar las cámaras consideraron que todo fue legal. Más deportes: Jhon Arias, nominado al mejor jugador de América: ¿contra quiénes compite? Antes del descanso Arsenal estuvo cerca de empatar luego de un error de salida de los Hammers. Bukayo Saka se metió en el área y definió al primer palo, con la mala suerte de que su remate se estrelló en el horizontal. En el complemento los Gunners se mantuvieron con el pie en el acelerador pero de nuevo la contundencia de West Ham le propinó un golpe cuando al minuto 55, en una acción de tiro de esquina, el griego Konstantinos Mavropanos estiró la ventaja.

Lo trataron de todas las maneras posibles, con centros, pases al vacío, disparos de media distancia y duelos individuales, pero la defensa de los Hammers se impuso en cada acción. West Ham tuvo un penalti a favor sobre la hora, cuando ya todo estaba definido, en el que Said Benrahma asumió la responsabilidad desde los 12 pasos, pero David Raya le dijo que no a su remate. Al final fue 2-0 y los Gunners se quedaron sin el liderato. Este martes, también por la fecha 19 de la Premier League, Liverpool venció a Burnley 2-0 con una asistencia de Luis Díaz incluida. En el trámite fue parecido al duelo entre Arsenal y West Ham, pues los Reds fueron muy superiores a su rival, pero a diferencia de los londinenses, tuvieron contundencia.

Esta semana Manchester City consiguió la victoria (3-1) sobre Everton y quedó a cinco puntos de Liverpool.

    "text": "Northwestern’s slew of staff changes has found its way off the field. The ‘Cats are moving on from director of football performance Jay Hooten, Matt Fortuna reported Thursday afternoon. Sources: Northwestern has parted ways with OC Mike Bajakian, special teams coordinator/TEs coach Jeff Genyk and director of sports performance for football Jay Hooten. — Matt Fortuna (@Matt_Fortuna) [December 28, 2023] Hooten had been with the Wildcats since 2009 before being elevated to director of football performance in 2011, where he oversaw NU’s strength, speed and conditioning training. His release is the third move made by David Braun since the conclusion of Northwestern’s season, as NU parted ways with offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian and special teams coordinator/tight ends coach Jeff Genyk as well. This past summer, Hooten was named in lawsuit filed by former player Lloyd Yates. In the complaint, which was filed in late July, Yates alleged that Hooten informed the team that Yates had “ratted them out” for partying before a workout, and Yates was subsequently “ran” by his teammates after the workout. Before arriving to Evanston, Hooten spent six years at Ohio State, serving as an assistant for the Buckeyes strength and conditioning program during their 2002 BCS National Championship season. An Ohio native, Hooten played high school football with current NU safeties coach Matt MacPherson.
