    "text": "Isabelle et Éric Le Bourhis, agriculteurs dans le Finistère, ont remporté une bataille judiciaire face à l’Agence de services et de paiement (ASP). Les retards de versements d’aides PAC ont failli couler leur élevage. Un jugement qui met en lumière les lourdes conséquences de ces délais pour les exploitants.\nLe Tribunal administratif de Rennes a tranché : l’Agence de services et de paiement (ASP) a été condamnée à indemniser un élevage bovin du Finistère pour des retards dans le versement des aides de la Politique agricole commune (PAC). Le jugement de ce mardi 19 novembre 2024 met en lumière [les difficultés des agriculteurs français](/bretagne/morbihan/c-est-bagnoles-contre-betail-la-confederation-paysanne-manifeste-devant-une-concession-automobile-pour-denoncer-les-accords-du-mercosur-3062380.html) face aux dysfonctionnements administratifs.\nUn éleveur en quête de justice\nIsabelle et Éric Le Bourhis, exploitants d’un élevage de vaches armoricaines à Scrignac, avaient porté plainte contre l’ASP. Ils réclamaient 128 000 € en compensation des préjudices financiers causés par des retards de paiement sur plusieurs années, ainsi que 10 000 € à titre personnel. Le Tribunal leur a partiellement donné raison, reconnaissant des \"fautes\" liées à des délais de paiement déraisonnables pour les aides de 2016 et 2017.\nCes aides, appelées Mesures agro-environnementales et climatiques (MAEC), sont versées aux agriculteurs qui s’engagent dans des pratiques durables. Mais selon les juges, les retards répétés ont placé les exploitants dans une situation financière critique.\n\"Un trou de trésorerie\" insurmontable\nPour le GAEC Le Bourhis, les conséquences ont été dévastatrices. L’élevage a accusé un déficit de trésorerie de 50 000 € en 2019. Contraints de contracter des découverts bancaires, les exploitants ont dû payer 40 000 € de frais financiers et 9 000 € de pénalités de retard à leurs fournisseurs. \"Ce n’est pas une grande entreprise capable d’absorber une telle perte\", avait plaidé leur avocat.\nLa situation était d’autant plus frustrante que le problème des retards de paiement était connu. La Commission européenne avait averti la France dès 2009 sur l’obsolescence du logiciel gérant les aides. Pourtant, ce n’est qu’en 2017 que l’outil a été modernisé, trop tard pour éviter le chaos des besoins en 2016 et 2017.\nDes paiements au compte-gouttes\nLes détails des versements confirment l’ampleur des retards : pour l’année 2016, sur les 57 000 € d’aides dues, seuls 29 000 € avaient été versés en 2016, suivis de montants résiduels en 2017 et 2019. Même schéma pour 2017, où une partie des aides n’a été versée qu’en 2019. Ces retards ont obligé l’élevage à vendre prématurément des bovins non matures, engendrant d’autres pertes.\nDes dommages moraux, mais pas financiers ?\nLe Tribunal administratif a cependant relativisé l’ampleur des préjudices. S’il a reconnu que les retards constituaient une \"faute\" de l’administration, il a jugé que les versements successifs avaient \"compensé\" le manque initial et n’avaient pas directement causé les retards de paiement aux fournisseurs ni les ventes précipitées.\nEn revanche, le stress et la pression subis par les exploitants ont été reconnus comme un \"préjudice moral\". L’ASP a été condamnée à leur verser 2 000 € chacun, ainsi qu’à prendre en charge 1 500 € de frais d’avocat.\nUn signal pour les autorités ?\nPour Isabelle et Éric Le Bourhis, la bataille judiciaire marque une victoire symbolique. Et rappelle l'une des demandes des agriculteurs, \"la simplification administrative\", l'un des points forts de leurs revendications [dans la colère qui s'exprime actuellement](/bretagne/cotes-d-armor/saint-brieuc/le-mercosur-il-faut-l-enterrer-bien-profond-la-colere-des-agriculteurs-bretons-eclate-a-callac-avant-de-s-etendre-3059533.html).",

I have a lot of friends in the flooded areas,\" Ms Anghel said.\n\"I have a friend, she lost everything. She was in the car when the flood arrived, she escaped by running, climbed on a tree, it's difficult to talk about.\"\nMs Anghel got one of the last trains out of Valencia on Thursday to fly to Birmingham for Cake International at the National Exhibition Centre (NEC).\nShe told BBC Radio WM her area was in a red alert and she was worried she would not be able to fly home on Sunday.\nEPA Flash flooding has destroyed cars and left debris piling high in the streets in Spain Her husband and son were still at home and everyone she knew was affected, she added.\nBut she felt she had to come to the the UK as the event was a huge one in the baking calendar and one she attended every year, Ms Anghel added.\n\"They have no food, no water, no power and they can’t leave their home,\" she said.\n\"They lost their car, their job, their everything. It's terrible. I don’t know when this will fixed.\"\nCayetana Belda Marti lives in Coventry but went to university in Valencia and her brother and sister still live there.\n\"They are saying that now is devastated, everything and thanks God they are OK. It's hard, because from here I cannot do anything,\" she said.\nThere are fears the death toll could rise in the coming days as many people remain missing across the affected areas.\nMore than a year's worth of rain fell in the area over just eight hours on Tuesday.\nMeteorologists believe the extreme weather is due, in part, to the Dana phenomenon - when a pool of cold air interacts with an area of low pressure to create an intensely unstable atmospheric environment.\nWhile studies suggest Dana events occur many times each year in the western Mediterranean, the intensity of such rainfall events appears to be increasing due to climate change.\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds , Facebook , X and Instagram .\nMore on this story British man, 71, dies after being rescued from Spain floods Trail of destruction after Spanish floods",

    "text": "Hydropower Hydropower “can punch way higher than its weight” to aid global decarbonization Elizabeth Ingram 7.18.2024 Share The journey to decarbonize the global electric power system can get a large boost with a single step … aiding and supporting hydropower development and hydroelectric power as an enabler of intermittent renewables. In a megasession this morning at HYDROVISION International — moderated by Dominique Gomez, deputy director of the Colorado Energy Office — three experts discussed the importance of hydropower and how it fits into and supports a larger global energy generation portfolio that is anticipated to have a heavy base of intermittent generation sources, such as solar and wind. As Masood Ahmad led with, “Hydropower can punch way higher than its weight” in the global decarbonization journey. Ahmad is resource planning manager with the Platte River Power Authority, a wholesale power supplier to the cities of Estes Park, Fort Collins, Longmont and Loveland in Colorado. His responsibilities include planning for the implementation of Platte River’s Resource Diversification Policy, which calls for the supply of 100% noncarbon, financially sustainable, environmentally responsible and reliable electricity by 2030. The three expert panelists James Barry, general counsel for Gravity Renewables Inc. and included Mucun Sun, power system research engineer in the energy systems group at Idaho National Laboratory. All three discussed their perspectives on the value of hydropower, Barry in his role leading commercial and power marketing contracting, corporate legal matters and the utility interconnection process with a company with 15 small hydroelectric projects in northeastern and eastern U.S. and Sun based on his research on deterministic/probabilistic renewable energy forecasting, power system optimization, and machine learning with applications to power system planning and scheduling. With the amount of energy provided worldwide by coal expected to drop significantly over the next 25 years, along with natural gas, solar and wind are expected to step up and fill that gap, Ahmad said. However, the intermittent nature of these renewables is problematic. Sun reported on research work at INL on how hydropower can be hybridized through pairing with solar, wind and even batteries to smooth out dispatchable generation. He shared data on the complementary of wind and hydropower, as well as solar PV and hydropower in the U.S. And he covered the complementary of future development at non-powered dams with wind and solar PV. Sun also discussed the known benefits of floating solar on hydropower reservoirs, including improving water quality. Another possible complement for hydropower he covered is storage, specifically batteries, which can enhance asset flexibility, enable various services and optimize financial performance. Barry touched on the Inflation Reduction Act’s incentives for renewable energy, including hydropower, but how things could be taken further to improve the landscape for hydro. And the panelists touched on the significant potential for pumped storage hydropower, which they called 50-year assets. And while pumped storage provides some energy, the better value of this asset is in capacity and flexibility. So what does the future hold? “If we don’t build more hydro, we’ll have to build more gas,” Ahmad said. But to achieve hydro’s potential, markets have to monetize its value.

    "text": "A laborer in the metallurgical sector in Guipúzcoa earns 30% more per hour than an engineer in Cuenca, according to the report ‘Collective bargaining in the metal industry in 2023′ prepared by the sector’s employers’ association, Confemetal, in which it is stated manifest the dispersion in the remunerations included in the different provincial metal agreements.\nIn fact, engineers working in the metal sector of up to 14 Spanish provinces They receive an hourly remuneration lower than that earned by a laborer in Guipúzcoa, the province that pays the best for this category of workers.\nSpecifically, a laborer in the metallurgical industry who works in Guipúzcoa charges 15.2 euros per hour an amount that exceeds what engineers in Cuenca (11.7 euros), Badajoz (12.15 euros), Cáceres (12.31 euros), Lleida (12.34 euros), Jaén (12, 57 euros), Ciudad Real (12.81 euros), Murcia (13.34 euros), Castellón (13.81 euros), Lugo (13.89 euros), Salamanca (14.04 euros), Soria (14.09 euros), Ourense (14.16 euros), Almería (14.22 euros) and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (14.56 euros).\nConfemetal explains that all these amounts They are based on the tables of the provincial collective agreements of the iron and steel industry in 2023 and, to calculate them, the base salary, group salary, extra pay and certain bonuses, such as transportation, are taken into account. Other remuneration concepts are left out, such as those that correspond to specific circumstances of a job, overtime or seniority.\nAccording to this report, in the metal sector the salary per hour worked in the category of former laborer stood at a average of 11.12 euros, above the 10.39 euros in 2022.\nWhat’s more, all of the four professional groups analyzed in this study (former laborer, worker, administrative and licensed engineer) increased their hourly wages compared to 2022. The state average of remuneration per hour worked is 12.1 euros for the worker officer, compared to 11.31 euros in 2022; of 12.57 euros for the administrative officer (11.76 euros in 2022) and 16.98 euros for the engineer (15.8 euros in 2022).\nThe province that pays the most There are numerous differences between provinces on the hourly wage of each group. Guipúzcoa and Navarra are the provinces that best reward metal laborers (15.2 and 14.6 euros per hour, respectively) and Lleida, Cuenca and Cáceres pay them the least (7.93, 8.7 and 9.36 euros per hour, respectively).\nIn the case of engineers, Guipúzcoa, Girona and Pontevedra are the provinces that pay them the best with an hourly wage of 25.98; 24.11 and 22.58 euros, respectively. At the other extreme are Cuenca (11.7 euros) and Badajoz (12.15 euros per hour).\nIn the worker category Guadalajara (9.77 euros per hour) and Cuenca (9.89 euros) present the lowest figures, in contrast to Guipúzcoa and Navarra, where they earn the most, with 16.88 and 15.74 euros per hour, respectively.\nFinally, within the administrative category Guipúzcoa and Navarra are also the ones that pay the most (18.35 and 15.74 euros per hour, respectively). On the opposite side, with the lowest hourly wages, are Cuenca (10.02 euros) and Cáceres (10.26 euros).\nWhatsApp Twitter Linkedin Beloud\n#metallurgical #laborer #earns #hour #Guipúzcoa #engineer #Cuenca",

    "text": "A continental cold air mass is to move south toward Taiwan tomorrow, with temperatures to plummet until Monday daytime, the Central Weather Administration said, advising those in mountainous areas to be alert for ice and snow.\nThe cold front is expected to be felt from late tomorrow evening to the early hours of Sunday, dropping temperatures as low as 11°C to 17°C for the northern region, 12°C to 21°C for the central region and 14°C to 22°C in the south, it said.\nSeasonal northeasterly winds would continue to be felt throughout today, with temperatures cooler than yesterday and dropping steadily across the main island and outlying Kinmen and Lienchiang counties, it said.\nPhoto courtesy of the Central Weather Administration\nToday is to be wetter than yesterday, with the highest chance of rainfall in the north, Taoyuan and Yilan County, it said.\nProlonged rainfall is expected in Keelung, the northern coastal regions and mountainous areas of the capital, with some areas to expect heavy rain today, it said.\nAreas of elevation above 3,000m are to expect icy roads this weekend before potential snowfall on Monday, it said.\nThe cold air mass is to weaken by Monday daytime, bringing warmer temperatures across the country, but the northern and eastern regions should still expect cool conditions and moderate rainfall, it said.\nConditions are to remain dry in the Keelung northern coastal region and central-eastern regions from Monday, but mountainous areas in the west should expect sudden showers, while all other regions are to remain cloudy, it added.\nThirty-five earthquakes have exceeded 5.5 on the Richter scale so far this year, the most in 14 years, the Central Weather Administration (CWA) said on Facebook on Thursday. A large earthquake in Hualien County on April 3 released five times as much the energy as the 921 Earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999, the agency said in its latest earthquake report for this year. Hualien County has had the most national earthquake alerts so far this year at 64, with Yilan County second with 23 and Changhua County third with nine, the agency said.

Trump is set to begin his second term early next year. Xi’s ambition to establish China as a “true world power” has intensified over the years, but he would not initiate an invasion of Taiwan “in the near future,” as his top priority is to maintain the regime and his power, not unification, Tokyo Woman’s Christian University distinguished visiting professor and contemporary Chinese politics expert Akio Takahara said.

On Tuesday, the army in a statement said it anticipates receiving the first batch of 38 M1A2T Abrams main battle tanks from the US, out of 108 tanks ordered, in the coming weeks. The M1 Abrams main battle tank is a generation ahead of the Taiwanese army’s US-made M60A3 and indigenously developed CM11 tanks, which have\nCASE COUNT: The deceased had advised law enforcement agencies regarding 60 fraud cases this year, leading to the confiscation of NT$9.3 billion in alleged illegal proceeds Prosecutors yesterday launched an investigation into the death of cryptocurrency expert Miffy Chen (陳梅慧), who died in a car crash on Wednesday under what some consider to be suspicious circumstances following her work with law enforcement to track down NT$9.3 billion (US$286.97 million) in alleged illegal proceeds. Prosecutor-General Hsing Tai-chao (邢泰釗) tasked the Hsinchu District Prosecutors’ Office with investigating the incident following requests from the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) and other agencies with which she worked to crack several prominent cases involving financial fraud and money laundering.

    "title": "EXCLUSIVE: GOP Reps Mock DOD Special Ops Office For Hosting Talk On ‘Far-Right’ Domestic Terrorism",
    "text": "GOP lawmakers said the Pentagon shouldn’t be focusing on domestic terrorism while an alleged Iranian influence agent holds a high-ranking position in an exclusive statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation Thursday. The DCNF previously reported the DOD agency overseeing special operations held a book talk on “far-right” domestic terrorism in the U.S. The office “is supposed to be focused on deterring future attacks by Iranian-backed terrorist proxies, not employing an acolyte of the regime,” Republican Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana and Elise Stefanik of New York told the DCNF. Two prominent GOP representatives mocked the Pentagon for hosting a book talk on domestic right-wing extremism in the same office where an alleged Iranian influencer holds a high-ranking position, according to a statement provided exclusively to the Daily Caller News Foundation on Thursday.\nThe Department of Defense (DOD)’s Special Operations/Low Intensity Conflict (SO/LIC) office, which oversees global special operations, invited two experts to discuss their new book on far-right terrorism in the U.S. for all staff who wanted to join on Tuesday, screenshots obtained by the DCNF reveal. The event highlighted the DOD’s unfounded focus on far-right extremism while ignoring other threats, Republican Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana and Elise Stefanik of New York told the DCNF.\n“Joe Biden’s woke Department of Defense (DoD) wasted $900,000 of taxpayer dollars on a baseless witchhunt to root out ‘Far Right extremism’ in the military and paid Leftist professors to speak on the subject yet took no action against an employee who is a known agent of Iranian extremism,” they said. (RELATED: Here’s How An Iranian-Backed Militia’s Suicide Drone Got Past US Defenses)\nAriane Tabatabai, the chief of staff in SO/LIC, was recently investigated for ties to an Iranian influence network. Tabatabai served as a founding member of the Iran Experts Initiative, a group of U.S. analysts who reportedly cooperated with the Islamic regime to promote Tehran’s preferred perspective of the threatening nuclear program while negotiations on a nuclear deal were ongoing.\n“SO/LIC is supposed to be focused on deterring future attacks by Iranian-backed terrorist proxies, not employing an acolyte of the regime. Enough with the woke politics – the DoD should focus on deterring future attacks against American troops,” they said.\nParents are NOT domestic terrorists. The American people agree.\nThe Biden Administration’s weaponization against parents is why the American people are losing trust in corrupt government agencies. @Weaponization is bringing accountability. pic.twitter.com/W2sEDTcWY7\n— Rep. Elise Stefanik (@RepStefanik) February 9, 2023\nThe invitation for Tuesday’s event appeared to go out via email to “all” staff of SO/LIC, the screenshots show. Bruce Hoffman, a professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), and Jacob Ware, a research fellow at CFR, were scheduled to present their book, which purports to trace right-wing domestic terrorism through U.S. history, characterizing the Ku Klux Klan and some groups involved in the Jan. 6 Capitol riots seeking to reverse the 2020 election as part of the same narrative.\nThe KKK was a vehicle for southern Democrats to resist the Republican Party reconstruction policies, according to History.com. None of the Jan. 6 rioters have been convicted on domestic terrorism laws.\n“Serious acts of terrorism have erupted from violent American far-right extremists in recent years, including the 2015 mass murder at a historic Black church in Charleston and the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol,” the book synopsis, which was also included in the email, read.\nThe Pentagon initiated a stand-down after the Jan. 6 riots and ordered a review of extremism present within the ranks of U.S. military personnel.\nBut a DOD-funded study released in December found no evidence that the number of violent extremists in the military was disproportionate to the number in the general population, and most of the few service members charged for engaging in prohibited extremist activity included evidence of violent action or plans for violent action. Despite two years of work, the Pentagon failed to understand domestic extremism and likely inflated the issue, to the possible detriment of cohesion within the ranks.\nThe office said the event was the first in what was intended to be a series of events featuring guest speakers on a variety of topics, the screenshots show.\nThe Pentagon did not respond to the DCNF’s previous request for explanation of how approved the event and why. It did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment Thursday on the lawmakers’ statements.\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

    "text": "By Jake Rowe ,\n1 hours ago\nGeorgia quarterback Carson Beck (15) takes the field to warm up before the start of the SEC championship game against Texas in Atlanta, on Saturday, Dec. 7, 2024. © Joshua L. Jones / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images Carson Beck will miss the Georgia’s Allstate Sugar Bowl matchup in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals, DawgsHQ has learned. On3’s Pete Nakos was the first to report that Beck’s ulnar collateral ligament will cause him to miss the Sugar Bowl which will be against Either Notre Dame or Indiana on January 1, 2025.\nBeck sustained the injury on the final play of the first half in the SEC Championship game. The Jacksonville native considered forgoing remaining eligibility at Georgia and entering the NFL Draft last year but elected to come back for one final season. He completed 64.7 percent of his passes for 3,485 yards 28 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. Beck also has a rushing touchdown on the season.\nWith Georgia trailing 6-3, Beck attempted a Hail Mary but held on to the ball long enough for the Longhorn pass rush to get home. His arm was hit as he threw, torquing it unnaturally.\nAfter staying on the field for a couple of minutes and being attended to by trainers and coaches, Beck left the field on his own power with his right arm dangling at his side. He returned to the sideline in the second half with ice on both his shoulder and his elbow.\nAccording to Kirby Smart, Beck was unable to grip the football due to numbess, tingling, and weakness in his throwing hand. Georgia turned to backup quarterback Gunner Stockton for the entire second half, scoring on four of six possessions.\nThe first of those possessions was a 10-play, 75-yard drive that was capped off by a 10-yard touchdown run from Trevor Etienne . The Bulldogs went on to make it 13-6 before Texas tied it with a 41-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter.\nUGA put together another scoring drive to answer, a 16-play 72-yard march that included a fake punt to extend the drive. Peyton Woodring ‘s chip shot field goal gave Georgia a 16-13 lead but the Longhorns tied it in the final minute with a short field goal, sending the game into overtime.\nTexas got a field goal on the opening possession and Georgia won it a few plays later. An eight-yard run from Stockton set the Bulldogs up at the Texas four-yard line but the sophomore signal caller lost his helmet at the end of the play. Beck came in to hand it off and Etienne punched it in from four yards out to capture the SEC crown for UGA. It was the last play of Beck’s 2025 season.\nThe post Carson Beck update: Georgia QB to miss Sugar Bowl appeared first on On3 .",
