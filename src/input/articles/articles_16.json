    "text": "NBC News Ozempic and Wegovy have lower risk of suicidal thoughts than other weight loss drugs, study finds Erika Edwards and Marina Kopf January 5, 2024 at 7:23 PM · 4 min read 6 Link Copied Read full article Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below\nAs the popularity of weight loss and diabetes drugs has grown, so have concerns about their possible psychiatric side effects.\nBut a major new study finds that semaglutide — the ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — has a significantly lower risk of suicidal thoughts compared to other weight-loss medications.\n\"We can confidently state that our analyses do not support claims of increased suicidality in patients who are prescribed semaglutide,\" said Dr. Nora Volkow , director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The agency was keen to look into semaglutide because it's also under investigation as a potential treatment for drug addiction.\n\"It would be vital to ensure it does not cause negative mental health effects to put an already vulnerable population at even greater risk of harmful health outcomes,\" Volkow said.\nThe research, published Friday in Nature Medicine , analyzed the medical records of nearly 1.6 million patients with type 2 diabetes and 240,618 patients with obesity.\nPatients who had been prescribed semaglutide were up to 73% less likely than patients prescribed other weight loss or diabetes medications, such as metformin, to report suicidal thoughts while taking the drugs.\n\"It's great to see this positive data,\" said Dr. Andres Acosta, an associate professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved with the new study. \"It's quite exciting to see that these medications do not increase the risk for suicidal ideation.\"\nSemaglutide, a GLP-1 agonist, works by helping to regulate appetite and insulin levels by targeting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors (GLP1R) in the body.\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved Ozempic in 2017 to help manage type 2 diabetes. Wegovy arrived in 2021 to treat obesity.\nPrescriptions for the drugs rose dramatically as they hit the U.S. market, increasing by 4,200% from 2018 to 2023, according to Epic Research, a data analysis company.\nSince their widespread use, the drugs have been found to act in different ways in the body. One study found that Wegovy can reduce the risk o f heart attack and strokes . Some patients reported abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting and more severe stomach problems . Others said they had thoughts of suicide while taking the drugs.\nThe FDA is looking into reports of these potential side effects.\n\"The FDA continues to monitor the safety of all approved products, including monitoring for suicidal behavior and ideation associated with use of GLP-1 receptor agonists for all approved uses, and will inform the public and take regulatory action to protect the public health if appropriate,\" the agency said in a statement.\nOther GLP-1 receptor agonists in the agency's investigation include Mounjaro, Trulicity and Zepbound.\nNovo Nordisk, which makes Ozempic and Wegovy, said in a statement that while the company is \"continuously performing surveillance\" of the drugs, it \"remains confident in the benefit risk profile of the products and remains committed to ensuring patient safety.\" Novo Nordisk did not play a role in the new study.\nLonger-term research is needed, as the NIDA study only looked at 6 months of data.\n\"It's very feasible that someone who is affected by excess weight could be on medication like this for decades,\" said Dr. David Creel, a psychologist and registered dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic. \"We need to look for evidence that there could be any problems with long-term use.\" Creel was not involved with the NIDA study.\nStill, the findings are in line with what doctors say they have generally observed with patients on semaglutide. The drugs work so well so quickly, especially for people trying to lose weight, that mood is generally positive — at least in the short-term.\n\"If you've been trying your whole life to lose weight and nothing's ever worked, and you're depressed about it, and then all of a sudden you start taking a medication that's making moves,\" said Dr. Shauna Levy, medical director of the Tulane Weight Loss Center in New Orleans, who was not involved with the new study, \"your spirits are going to be lifted.\"\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis, call 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

    "text": "With over $15 billion invested in private financial institutions and governments, the company is leading efforts to integrate sustainability into business strategies while driving economic development.\nEconomic growth and environmental concerns in Asia Asia has witnessed remarkable economic growth fueled by market-oriented reforms and substantial foreign direct investment. This rapid advancement has significantly improved living standards and spurred prosperity across the continent. However, it has also brought environmental challenges to the forefront. The SATAS Group recognises the critical need to address these challenges to prevent irreversible damage to the planet while continuing to foster economic growth.\nVu Minh's vision for sustainable growth Billionaire Mai Vu Minh , the chairman of SATAS Group and SAPA Thale Group, has been instrumental in spearheading the company's commitment to sustainable economic growth. Minh's profound understanding of both economic trends and environmental dynamics has made him a vocal advocate for balancing prosperity with ecological stewardship. His leadership has not only guided SATAS Group's substantial investments in green technologies and sustainable practices but also positioned the company as a pioneer in integrating sustainability into business strategies.\nMinh's vision emphasizes the importance of collaborative efforts between governments, businesses, and civil society to address urgent environmental challenges. His approach reinforces SATAS Group's role as a leader in fostering a sustainable future.\nStrategic investments in green technologies SATAS Group advocates for strategic investments in green technologies and sustainable practices, believing that economic growth and environmental conservation can be mutually reinforcing. By highlighting initiatives in renewable energy and eco-friendly manufacturing, SATAS Group sees potential in integrating sustainability into business strategies. Despite the complexities involved, especially in industries reliant on natural resources, the company remains optimistic about the future.\nOne of the major challenges identified by SATAS Group is the global disparity in environmental standards, which complicates the efforts of businesses operating in an interconnected world. The company stresses the necessity of coordinated action across national and international levels to tackle urgent environmental issues such as climate change. SATAS Group advocates for collaboration among governments, businesses, and civil society to achieve sustainable development goals.\nGlobal engagement and knowledge sharing Drawing from extensive international engagements and partnerships, SATAS Group emphasizes the importance of dialogue and knowledge-sharing platforms. Global forums like the World Economic Forum are identified as crucial arenas for fostering consensus on sustainable practices. SATAS Group envisions economic growth not as an end in itself but as a vehicle for enhancing human well-being while preserving the planet for future generations.\nVu Minh's role in shaping asia's economic landscape Mai Vu Minh's influence is evident through his investments, totalling over $15 billion in private financial institutions and governments. These investments reflect his nuanced approach to balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability, recognizing the importance of addressing both aspects to achieve holistic development.\nMinh's interactions with over 30 world leaders, including those from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Canada, Russia, the US and China, have expanded his international network. These meetings have provided valuable lessons on global business management and underscored the importance of collaboration and knowledge-sharing in achieving sustainable development goals.\nBalancing growth and sustainability Minh believes that economic growth and environmental conservation can complement each other. He advocates for investments in green technologies and sustainable practices, highlighting initiatives in renewable energy and eco-friendly manufacturing. Minh sees potential in integrating sustainability into business strategies to drive economic expansion while minimizing ecological footprints. He also acknowledges the complexities involved in balancing economic interests with environmental priorities, especially in industries dependent on natural resources.\nA holistic approach to development Billionaire Vu Minh calls for a holistic approach that integrates environmental considerations into economic policies and corporate strategies. He promotes innovation, collaboration, and responsible stewardship as essential components of sustainable development. SATAS Group's initiatives and strategies offer a guiding beacon for Asia and the global community as they navigate toward a sustainable future.\nIn a world grappling with the dual challenges of economic prosperity and environmental sustainability, SATAS Group's efforts present a hopeful vision for harmonising humanity's progress with nature's preservation. Under the leadership of billionaire investor Vu Minh, the company continues to set new standards for integrating sustainability into the fabric of economic growth.",

    "text": "CV NEWS FEED // The Diocese of Joliet, Illinois is closing and merging parishes across the diocese as a result of declining Mass attendance, donations, and an aging priest population.\nAccording to a press release from Bishop Ronald Hicks, the restructuring plan will affect 20 parishes and two worship sites. On July 1, 2025, the parishes will close or merge into 11 parishes and six worship sites.\nSome parishes affected in the consolidation include Chicago suburbs.\nThe Diocese of Joliet’s “Targeted Restructuring Plan” began in June 2022. Phase 1 of the plan was announced in March 2023 and Phase 2 was announced in January 2024.\nBishop Hicks stated that the new restructuring plan will include priest reassignments, which will be announced June 1.\nHe also stated that Phase 3 is the final stage of the restructuring plan. “However, that does not mean we remain static or complacent,” he added.\nThe bishop stated that the diocese “will continue to monitor the health and viability of our parishes, schools and ministries to make sure we are a vibrant, thriving Catholic Church that is dedicated to passing on our faith to the next generations.”\nBishop Hicks acknowledged that the transition would be difficult for many families, affecting where parishioners worship and how far they must drive to Mass. “With all my compassion, know that my prayers are with you on this new journey,” he wrote.\nHe also encouraged parishioners to invite the Holy Spirit into their hearts during the transition period, and welcome new parishioners into their communities.",
