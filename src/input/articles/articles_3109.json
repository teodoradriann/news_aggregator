    "text": "大甲區文昌國小創校近百年，辦學績效優異，卻缺乏一座禮堂供孩子遮風避雨，市長盧秀燕上任後補助學校約7000多萬元興建禮堂完工，12日學校第80屆畢業典禮與校慶活動，終於可在全新落成的禮堂舉辦，讓師生與家長免於風吹日曬。盧市長特地到場祝賀，一同開箱這座給師生的校慶禮物，也勉勵畢業生展翅高飛，邁向嶄新的學習階段。\n盧秀燕表示，文昌國小創校98年，是一所歷史悠久、辦學績效優異的學校，歷屆校長、師長、學生與家長共同努力讓校風優良、學子表現出色，唯一的遺憾就是校內一直沒有自己的禮堂。為了彌補這個缺憾，市府110年起投入5,000多萬元興建禮堂，另再補助不足經費1900多萬元，趕在今年畢業季前完工啟用，讓這屆畢業生成為百年來首度在自有禮堂舉辦畢業典禮的學生，意義非凡、令人感動。\n她感謝校方、家長會與地方民代的積極爭取，讓文昌國小的禮堂順利完工啟用，也感謝市議會支持預算，讓市府得以積極推動教育建設。另也勉勵畢業生要心懷感恩，感謝老師、同學、家人陪伴與照顧，畢業不是結束而是新的開始，未來邁向國中、高中，將有更多夥伴同行。\n教育局長蔣偉民表示，盧市長上任以來，完工及施工中的學校禮堂約有21所，今年有5所開箱啟用的新禮堂，包括大里成功國中禮堂與地下停車場3.16億元；大里立新國中禮堂與地下停車場3.2億元；梧棲梧南國小「映霞樓」幼兒園、國小教室和禮堂，經費1.6億元；大甲文昌國小禮堂7000多萬元；太平新高國小校舍與禮堂3.5億元。\n此外，市府於112年再加碼推動「給孩子一個禮堂」計畫，補助25所學校興建禮堂，全案市府挹注24億多元，打造具備現代化舞台與多功能用途的室內空間。未來無論是音樂表演、科學展覽或畢業典禮，都能在安全舒適、有溫度的場域中舉行，讓每一位孩子都能閃耀光芒。\n文昌國小校長許慶昌表示，此次校慶結合畢業典禮在全新禮堂舉辦是全校之福，孩子不再日曬雨淋，感謝市府及民意代表及地人士的幫忙，順利幫孩子圓夢有了新的禮堂，學校未來將持續秉持「溫馨、卓越、創新」的辦學理念，讓文昌成為孩子快樂成長、夢想起飛的園地。\n教育局指出，文昌國小創校迄今98年，長期深耕學力與藝文體育並重的教學特色，擁有優異的語文競賽表現與全國特優級的管樂隊，更於2023年贏得斯洛維尼亞國際手球賽U12冠軍，辦學成果卓著。學校近年也持續精進硬體設施，包括完成操場跑道、耐震補強與教室冷氣裝設等，營造優質學習環境。",

    "title": "39% of skills outdated by 2030: WEF warns of AI's impact on jobs",
    "text": "Artificial intelligence is reshaping the global job market, and the changes are coming faster than expected. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), half of all employers plan to reorient their businesses in response to AI, while two-thirds aim to hire talent with AI-specific skills. At the same time, 40% anticipate reducing their workforce in roles where automation can take over.\nThe WEF’s Future of Jobs Report 2025, based on input from over 1,000 employers across 55 economies, predicts significant job creation alongside massive displacement. Over the next five years, clerical and secretarial roles will face the steepest declines, with positions like admin assistants, ticket clerks, and cashiers increasingly replaced by AI-driven tools and automation.\nOn the brighter side, industries requiring human oversight and hands-on expertise are expected to grow. Roles in delivery, construction, food processing, and farming are among those set to expand. The care economy—including nursing, social work, and personal care—will also see strong growth due to the irreplaceable human touch required in these professions.\nFor workers, skill adaptation will be critical. The report warns that 39% of existing skill sets will become outdated by 2030. While this figure marks an improvement from the pandemic’s peak of 57%, it underscores the urgency of upskilling in AI, big data, and software development. IT specialists in robotics, autonomous systems, and renewable energy technologies are forecast to thrive in this evolving landscape.\nThe report also highlights broader trends influencing job markets. Rising costs of living could eliminate 1.6 million jobs, although respondents believe many will be replaced. Trade restrictions and economic challenges will add to the pressures reshaping global labor markets.\nBetween job displacement and creation, the WEF estimates a net growth of 78 million jobs by 2030, signaling that adaptability will define future workforce success.\nCopyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.

    "title": "7 Women's March Madness stars ready to take vacant spotlight from Caitlin Clark",
    "text": "Who will steal the show in this year's Women's NCAA Tournament like Caitlin Clark did in years past? By Levi Dombro |\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X\nCopy Article\nUCLA v USC | Andy Lyons/GettyImages Caitlin Clark was the biggest star in college basketball for several seasons with the Iowa Hawkeyes. She parlayed that into being the top draft choice in the 2024 WNBA Draft, and her stardom reached new heights at the professional level.\nHowever, a massive chasm was left in the women's college game after she left, and several stars will be vying to be the biggest name in March Madness this year. The country is full of amazing talent this season, but there are only a handful of players who are ready for the spotlight in the NCAA Tournament when the lights are brightest.\n7. Lauren Betts, C, UCLA Betts has been a force for the Bruins all season on both ends of the floor. UCLA only lost two games this season, both of them to their bitter rival USC, but they avenged those losses by taking down the Trojans in the Big Ten Tournament Championship. The Bruins are the No. 1 overall seed and there might not be a team in the country playing better than they are right now. If they make a big tournament run, Betts will almost certainly be leading the charge and could steal the show this March.\n6. Hannah Hidalgo, G, Notre Dame Hidalgo was the front-runner for the National Player of the Year Award for a good portion of the year until a late-season slide. She still has the capability to be the best player in the tournament, and she'll be coming in with quite a chip on her shoulder. She is one of the best scorers in the country and should be the focal point for a Notre Dame team that is poised to make a deep run, which means she could be poised for stardom in the tournament.\n5. Hailey Van Lith, G, TCU Van Lith has something to prove this year after a lackluster performance for LSU last season. Now the star of the TCU Horned Frogs and the Big 12 Conference Player of the Year, she'll be more than ready to lead her team on a deep tournament run, and to do it in electrifying fashion. Watching her play the game is just enjoyable, and she has a rematch with Louisville, her old school, potentially waiting for her in the second round of the tournament. Van Lith will be must-see TV in March Madness.\n4. Paige Bueckers, G, UConn Bueckers fell on hard times at points during her college career but is still one of the best players in women's college basketball of the last decade. She and the UConn Huskies are playing their best basketball right now, and Bueckers is leading the charge, which positions her nicely for a share of the spotlight in the Big Dance.\n3. Ta'Niya Latson, G, Florida State Ta'Niya Latson is the country's leading scorer at 24.9 points per contest and should turn some heads in the NCAA Tournament. She and the Florida State Seminoles are just a No. 6 seed, but they could be the exact kind of Cinderella team that March Madness needs this year. If they can win in the first round, they'll have a series of high-profile matchups looming against LSU, NC State and UCLA, which should cast quite a bit of attention on Latson and her scoring prowess.\n2. Mikayla Blakes, G, Vanderbilt Blakes is already one of the nation's best scorers as a true freshman for the Vanderbilt Commodores. She averaged 23.2 points per game in a loaded SEC this season and proved that no moment is too big for her. Vanderbilt will have an uphill battle this March as a No. 7 seed, but if they can pull off a handful of upsets, Blakes may walk out of the tournament as a household name.\n1. Juju Watkins, G, USC Watkins is the obvious heir to the Caitlin Clark throne. She is the frontrunner for the National Player of the Year Award and is poised to lead the USC Trojans on a deep tournament run. She can do everything on the basketball court and is the most exciting player to watch in all of college basketball. If her team can avoid early upsets, she will be the talk of the tournament, undoubtedly.",

    "text": "Newcastle engineering firm creates jobs to bolster growth plans throughout 2024 Business performance in the civil and structural engineering sector will remain resilient with green shoots starting to show in the residential market, said Ross Oakley, managing director of Newcastle engineers RWO. This will drive additional growth and expansion over the next 12 months for North East engineers such as RWO, with a steady stream of work coming up in the year ahead as previously delayed projects get the green light. Ross Oakley also expects to see increasing volumes of work for geo-environmental engineering services as activity remains ‘extremely’ busy in the sector with a plethora of new projects coming forward in the new year. Civil engineering work could see an industry predicted 17 per cent rise in starts in the next 12 months, an achievable figure, Ross Oakley believes, whose firm will see increased levels of work for social housing providers, and a growing footprint in burgeoning data centre design and build. Ross commented: “We are looking forward to cautious growth in 2024, driven by a strengthening in work across almost all sectors and rescheduled projects getting underway. New investment in utilities, energy and telecoms infrastructure will be to fore in the coming months, powering growth in demand for services like ours.” RWO is targeting revenues in excess of £3m in the next 12 months as it looks towards another strong performance in 2025 with plans for further investment in its workforce helping to drive growth, said managing director Ross Oakley. He added: “We are recruiting to fuel planned growth in the coming 18 months as further new customers come onboard. We are committed to getting the right people and offering an excellent employee benefits package which includes training and opportunities for career development.” By [Matthew Neville](https://bdaily.co.uk/profile/matthew-bdaily) – Senior Correspondent, Bdaily - Add me on - And follow Bdaily on - Submit press releases to [editor@bdaily.co.uk](mailto:editor@bdaily.co.uk)for consideration.

    "text": "Swift 360 Keyboard by MaveMall, a prominent name in the technology accessories industry, continues to rank amongst the best iPad keyboards in the world even years after its launch. Swift 360 Keyboard is a revolutionary product set to redefine standards in the iPad accessory domain. The widely popular keyboard brings unprecedented functionality, converting the iPad into an exceptionally versatile device. Amidst a competitive market, Swift 360 distinguishes itself with a distinctive blend of features and design. Setting it apart from counterparts like the Apple Magic Keyboard and Logitech Combo Touch, the Swift 360 Keyboard boasts its own built-in battery, guaranteeing consistent performance and greater efficiency. It also features adjustable backlit keys available in seven colors, providing adaptability for users in different lighting environments. A significant advantage of the Swift 360 Keyboard is its built-in battery, offering independence from the iPad's power and thus extended usability, a feature that Apple's and Logitech's models lack as they draw power directly from the iPad. Furthermore, the Swift 360 enhances user experience with its customizable backlit keys, offering seven color options to suit various preferences and lighting conditions, a level of personalization not found in the relatively static backlighting of the other two. The Apple Magic Keyboard is known for its unique floating design, and the Logitech Combo Touch has a keyboard you can detach and a stand you can adjust. However, the Swift 360 is special because it can rotate fully, giving users more ways to view and use it. This makes the Swift 360 more than just a keyboard; it's a versatile tool that improves how lots of different people use their iPads. Additions like the integrated Apple Pencil holder and extensive iPad protection highlight the keyboard's considerate and comprehensive design approach. Founded in 2021, MaveMall quickly expanded from a small home office into a successful online store with customers worldwide. \"The Swift 360 represents the pinnacle of our intensive research and our commitment to crafting products that truly enhance the lives of our customers. Our growth shows our dedication to keep creating quality products,\" said Nick from MaveMall. As a company deeply committed to its customers, MaveMall continues to seek creative ways to enhance its offerings. \"We're not just selling products; we're enriching experiences,\" Nick added. Join the revolution and elevate your iPad experience with MaveMall's latest innovation.

    "text": "Berlin. Die Grünen-Fraktionschefin kritisiert bei Markus Lanz die CDU für das Debakel um Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf – war es Spahns Führungsversagen?\n„Am Tag danach – einem denkwürdigen Gespräch“: So eröffnet Markus Lanz am Mittwochabend seine Sendung – mit Verweis auf den emotionalen Auftritt von Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf am Vorabend. Die SPD-Kandidatin für das Bundesverfassungsgericht steht im Zentrum einer Debatte, die längst zum politischen Beben geworden ist.\nDie Gäste bei „Markus Lanz“ am 16. Juli\n- Britta Haßelmann, Grünen-Politikerin\n- Christoph Ploß, CDU-Politiker\n- Melanie Amann, Journalistin\n- Robin Alexander, Journalist\nGrünen-Fraktionschefin Britta Haßelmann benennt klar, wer aus ihrer Sicht das politische Desaster verursacht hat: „Ein eklatantes Führungsversagen von Jens Spahn.“ Der CDU-Politiker habe seine Fraktion nicht vorbereitet und die Kandidatin im Regen stehen lassen. Den Plagiatsvorwurf gegen Brosius-Gersdorf nennt sie eine „Hilfskonstruktion“, die „wie ein Kartenhaus zusammengefallen“ sei.\nAuch interessant\nAuch Moderator Lanz merkt an, dass von 24 zur Sendung eingeladenen CDU-Vertreterinnen und Vertretern nur Christoph Ploß zugesagt hat. „Dass hier niemand der Führung der CDU sitzt, spricht für sich“, kommentiert „Welt“-Vize Robin Alexander.\nRobin Alexander bei „Markus Lanz“: CDU hat Kontrolle über Fraktion verloren\nAlexander bewertet die Lage als Fiasko: Die CDU-Führung habe „die Kontrolle über ihre eigene Fraktion verloren“. Dass ausgerechnet Merz und Spahn, die Angela Merkel einst mangelnden Zugang zur Partei vorwarfen, nun selbst die Dynamiken nicht im Griff hätten, sei „ironisch“. Sein Fazit: „Der Skandal ist der Umgang damit, nicht die Zweifel an der Kandidatin.“\nDer CDU-Abgeordnete Christoph Ploß rechtfertigt den Rückzug der Union: „Ich hätte sie auch nicht gewählt.“ Er betont mehrfach den Schutz der Menschenwürde – vor allem des ungeborenen Lebens. Als Beleg zitiert er, sichtlich vorbereitet – er holt einen Zettel aus der Brusttasche –, einen isolierten Satz aus Brosius-Gersdorfs Stellungnahme: „Es gibt gute Gründe dafür, dass die Menschenwürdegarantie erst ab Geburt gilt.“\nAuch interessant\nLanz reagiert scharf: „Dann lesen Sie bitte auch den zweiten, dritten und vierten Satz vor.“ Denn genau dieser Satz ist einer der Aufhänger für viele verzerrte Darstellungen, die die Juristin als Aktivistin framen. Auch Amann widerspricht: „Sie kommt nicht als Aktivistin an das Verfassungsgericht. Das ist eine exzellente Juristin.“ Alexander ergänzt: „Dass der Abtreibungskompromiss intellektuell an Grenzen stößt, war schon immer so.“\nFrauenfeindliche Dynamiken im politischen Betrieb\nAmann betont, dass Brosius-Gersdorf das Spannungsfeld zwischen dem Schutz des ungeborenen Lebens und dem Recht der Frau differenziert dargestellt habe. Doch die Debatte eskaliert – auch auf metapolitischer Ebene. „Jetzt möchte ich mal zu Ende reden“, sagt Amann mehrfach, nachdem ihr die männlichen Gäste ins Wort gefallen sind. Sie stellt klar: „Ich möchte den Eindruck zerstreuen, dass es hier nur um Inhalte ging.“\nHaßelmann bringt die strukturelle Dimension auf den Punkt: „Ich habe kein Interesse mehr daran, dass Männer mir die Welt erklären.“ Sie verurteilt die „böswilligen Unterstellungen“, Brosius-Gersdorf befürworte Spätabtreibungen einen Tag vor der Geburt – ein Narrativ, das öffentlich lanciert wurde. Außerdem verweist sie auf einen vergleichbaren Umgang mit Margaretha Sudhof, der Sonderermittlerin zur Maskenaffäre.\n§218-Debatte verdeckt das politische Problem\nLanz beschreibt Brosius-Gersdorfs Auftritt als mutig: „Sie hat das gegen den Rat aller um sie herum gemacht. Das ist etwas, was eine Frau macht, die sich ihr Leben zurückholen will.“ Amann hebt hervor: „Man hat ihr die Anspannung in den ersten Minuten angemerkt.“ Sie fragt sich jedoch, wie viele Zuschauende der juristischen Komplexität folgen konnten. Für Amann ist klar: „Karlsruhe ist damit für sie in weite Ferne gerückt.“\nWieder und wieder dreht sich die Diskussion um Paragraph 218, der unter anderem den Umgang mit Abtreibungen regelt. Haßelmann reicht es irgendwann: „Vielleicht muss man einfach mal sagen: Cut. Wir führen hier doch keine §218-Debatte, sondern sprechen über das Scheitern einer Wahl zum höchsten Gericht.“ Die Grünen-Politikerin warnt: Das Muster erinnere an Strategien der AfD – und die Union lasse sich treiben. „Ich mache mir große Sorgen um CDU und CSU.“\nBrosius-Gersdorfs Karriere wohl beendet – Politik bleibt Antworten schuldig\nAmann stellt grundsätzlich infrage, ob das bisherige Verfahren zur Richterwahl noch funktioniert: „Ich glaube, wir haben jetzt die letzte normale Bundesverfassungsrichterwahl erlebt.“ Zu undurchsichtig, zu politisiert sei das Verfahren. Haßelmann fordert: „Die Koalition muss zeigen, ob sie handlungsfähig ist.“ Bislang habe es keinerlei Gespräche zwischen den Fraktionen gegeben habe, wie es nun weitergehen soll. „Wollen wir die Bürgerinnen und Bürger im Unklaren lassen, ob die Koalition stabil ist?“, fragt sie.\nTrotz demonstrativer Rückendeckung: Für Brosius-Gersdorf steht die Tür nach Karlsruhe offenbar kaum noch offen. „Aus meiner Sicht spricht viel dafür, dass sie nicht Verfassungsrichterin wird“, sagt Amann. Die Sendung endet ohne Lösung, aber mit einem unübersehbaren Befund: Diese Republik tut sich schwer mit Frauen in Machtpositionen – vor allem, wenn sie komplex argumentieren und für etwas einstehen.",
