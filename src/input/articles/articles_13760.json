AHS took in 55 cats from a single-family home in Wadena County. In a social media post, the group said this comes after an “urgent request from an overwhelmed caretaker.” The cats are generally healthy, AHS said in the post, but some are being treated for respiratory disease. “Knowing the situation was unsustainable and could quickly become dire, the owner released the cats to Animal Humane Society, ensuring their beloved felines would receive the expert medical and behavioral care they needed,” AHS said in the post. A spokesperson with AHS told KARE 11 they are still learning about each animal’s history and unique medical and behavioral needs, but some may start becoming available for[ adoption](https://www.animalhumanesociety.org/adoption/cats) as early as next week. In the meantime, AHS is asking for [financial support](https://www.animalhumanesociety.org/donate/make-gift) to take care of the new cats. Copyright 2024 KVLY. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Debuta México con derrota ante Curazao en Serie del Caribe 2024 La Escuadra Tricolor se quedó a una carrera de remontar las cuatro que tenía de desventaja en la novena entrada HERMOSILLO .- Los Naranjeros de Hermosillo intentaron revivir con tres carreras en la novena baja, pero el bateo de Curazao estuvo imparable y el representativo de México cayó este jueves por 6-5 en su presentación dentro de la Serie del Caribe Miami 2024. Julián Ornelas conectó dos jonrones, Aaron Altherr uno más y produjo tres rayitas; sin embargo Manny Barreda permitió cinco carreras en cinco entradas de labor que los suyos no pudieron reponer. Fue la escuadra mexicana la que inauguró la pizarra en la segunda baja, cuando Aaron Alther y Julián Ornelas conectaron cuadrangulares solitarios (espalda con espalda) ante el abridor Cody Mincey, para poner las cosas 2-0 hasta ese momento. Pero la respuesta del conjunto isleño fue inmediata, y en la tercera alta lograron hacerle tres carreras a Barreda; todas producidas por un triplete de Didi Gregorius cuando tenía la casa llena. Ese no sería todo el daño que permitiría el abridor mexicano, ya que en la sexta entrada fue recibido con estacazos de Jonathan Schoop y Ademar Rifaela, lo que marcó su salida del juego y la entrada de Juan Gámez desde el bullpen. Fernando Salas entró a lanzar el octavo rollo por los aztecas, pero después de ponchar a Rifaela también le recetaron un bambinazo, obra de Hendrik Clementina; incrementando así la diferencia a 6-2. Un gran hit Después de que Luis Márquez sacara la novena alta con solo un hit, los dirigidos por Juan Gabriel Castro pusieron en aprietos al pitcher ganador, Kevin Kelly, una vez que lograron hacerle tres anotaciones; aunque al final Anthony Herrera dominó a Agustín Murillo con un elevado al shortstop y le puso fin al drama. Ese último ataque incluyó una carrera de Ramiro Peña remolcada con sencillo de Aaron Altherr, así como el segundo tablazo solitario de Julián Ornelas. México se medirá mañana viernes a Puerto Rico a partir de las 18:30 horas (tiempo de Sonora), donde el cubano Odrisamer Despaigne fungirá como el pitcher abridor por los aztecas.",

    "text": "DUBAI: Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ouided Bouchamaoui has been named professor of practice of diplomacy and conflict resolution at New York University Abu Dhabi, Emirates News Agency reported on Thursday.\nThe Tunisian businesswoman, who, as leader of the Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts took part in Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet which led the organization to receive the 2015 Nobel prize, is also a prominent peace envoy.\nBouchamaoui, a Harvard alumnus, is acclaimed for her accomplishments in international business, community engagement, negotiation, crisis management, and women’s empowerment.\nShe was appointed the first female president of the UTICA where she played a vital role in encouraging investment and navigating labor disputes.\nHer accomplishments also include numerous honorary doctorates and awards such as the French Legion of Honor and the Order of the Polar Star from Sweden.\n“Ouided Bouchamaoui’s remarkable journey from promoting democracy and peace in Tunisia to leading global discussions on conflict resolution makes her an invaluable addition to our academic community,” said NYU Abu Dhabi Provost Arlie Petters.\n“Her appointment reinforces our commitment to offering diverse and profound learning experiences that prepare our students to tackle the world's most pressing challenges.”\nTunisian Nobel Peace Prize winner Ouided Bouchamaoui appointed diplomacy professor at NYU Abu Dhabi\nhttps://arab.news/z2r25\nTunisian Nobel Peace Prize winner Ouided Bouchamaoui appointed diplomacy professor at NYU Abu Dhabi\n- She was appointed the first female president of the Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts\nDUBAI: Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ouided Bouchamaoui has been named professor of practice of diplomacy and conflict resolution at New York University Abu Dhabi, Emirates News Agency reported on Thursday.\nIsraeli general in Gaza criticizes political leaders\n- “You must be worthy of us,” Goldfus said of his country’s leaders\nJERUSALEM: An Israeli general leading troops in Gaza has delivered rare public criticism of the country’s political leadership, demanding it “be worthy” of the soldiers fighting against Hamas in the Palestinian territory.\nBrig. Gen. Dan Goldfus, head of the 98th division deployed in Gaza’s main southern city of Khan Yunis, also appeared to enter into a row over exempting ultra-Orthodox Jews from military service.\nHe was subsequently summoned by the military leadership for his comments, which breached a long-standing taboo on uniformed officers publicly wading into politics.\n“You must be worthy of us,” Goldfus said of his country’s leaders, in comments broadcast on Israeli television on Wednesday.\nHe called for Israeli politicians “to push aside the extreme, and adopt togetherness” in the Gaza war sparked by Hamas’s October 7 attack on southern Israel.\nThe general vowed that military commanders and soldiers would take responsibility for their actions.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far stopped short of assuming personal responsibility for Israel’s intelligence failures on October 7 and said any official investigations must take place after the war.\n“We will not run from responsibility. We bow our heads in light of our reverberating failure on October 7, but at the same time are leading forward,” the general said.\nSince Israel launched a ground offensive in Gaza on October 27, 249 soldiers have been killed in the Palestinian territory, according to the military.\nAddressing Israel’s political leaders, Goldfus called on them to ensure that “everyone takes part” in enlisting in the armed forces, in an apparent reference to ultra-Orthodox Israeli men being exempt from national service — a contentious political issue.\nMost Jewish men are required by law to serve in the Israeli military, but members of the ultra-Orthodox minority — known in Hebrew as Haredim — have long been given sweeping exemptions.\nSince the October 7 attack by Hamas, public frustration over the exemption has resurfaced, adding pressure on Netanyahu’s governing coalition, which relies on ultra-Orthodox allies staunchly opposed to drafting Haredi men.\nNeither Netanyahu nor Defense Minister Yoav Gallant publicly responded to Goldfus’s remarks.\nSome lawmakers voiced their approval while others expressed dissatisfaction with the general making political statements of any kind.\nYoav Segalovitz, a centrist opposition lawmaker, told Kan public radio on Thursday that “a uniformed officer needs to talk only about what’s related to his decisions or take off the uniform.”\nWriting in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, columnist Nahum Barnea said that “with all respect to the heartfelt sentiments of the esteemed officer, fighting in Gaza doesn’t give him the right or the authority to express a position on political matters.”\nHamas’s October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.\nIsrael’s subsequent retaliatory offensive in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas, has killed at least 31,341 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.\nHamas health ministry says Israeli fire on Gazans waiting for aid kills 11\nGAZA STRIP: The Hamas-run health ministry said early Friday that Israeli gunfire killed 11 people and wounded around 100 as they waited to receive aid in the Gaza Strip.\nIn a statement, the ministry said citizens had gathered at a roundabout in Gaza City when they were fired upon by Israeli forces. Contacted by AFP, the Israeli army had not commented immediately on the claim.\nAid efforts intensify for famine-stalked Gaza\n- The war has resulted in severe shortages of medical supplies across Gaza, with only a fraction of hospitals partially functioning\n- WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said aid had been delivered to Al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza\nGAZA STRIP, Palestinian Territories: Efforts mounted on Thursday to get more aid into the war-devastated Gaza Strip, where the UN warns of famine and desperate residents have stormed relief convoys.\nAfter mediators failed to reach a truce between Israel and Hamas for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which started Monday, fighting continued with at least 69 deaths over the previous 24 hours, the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry said.\nHamas authorities reported more than 40 air strikes across Gaza, from Beit Hanoun in the north to Rafah in the south, where most of Gaza’s population has sought refuge and Israel is threatening a ground assault.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday doubled down on pledges to invade Rafah, saying: “There is international pressure to prevent us from entering Rafah and completing the job.\n“I will continue to repel the pressures and we will enter Rafah... and bring complete victory to the people of Israel,” he said during a visit to a field intelligence base.\nAround 1.5 million Palestinians have sought refuge along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt in Rafah.\nIsraeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said late Wednesday that a “significant” number of them would need to be moved “to a humanitarian island that we will create with the international community.”\nThe Israeli military said on Thursday it was “raiding Hamas’s hideouts and military strongholds” in southern Gaza’s main city of Khan Yunis.\n“During a search in the area, the forces located several weapons in a bedroom under a bed, including missiles and explosives. Following the searches in the area, the forces located a rocket launcher and missiles near a school and destroyed it.”\nGaza’s health ministry said seven people were killed when Israeli troops opened fire at an aid distribution point near Gaza City. The army had no immediate comment.\nIn central Israel, police said a Gaza-raised Palestinian had stabbed a soldier in a shopping center, who had shot his attacker dead before later dying from his injuries.\nThe war began on October 7 when Hamas militants attacked Israel, resulting in about 1,160 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.\nIsrael has carried out a relentless campaign of bombardment and ground operations in Gaza, killing at least 31,341 people, most of them civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.\nHamas militants also seized about 250 Israeli and foreign hostages, dozens of whom were released during a week-long truce in November. Israel believes about 130 of the captives remain in Gaza and that 32 are dead.\nActivists and families of Israeli hostages kept up pressure for their negotiated release, again blocking a Tel Aviv highway in protest on Thursday.\nAnd in a sign of mounting US exasperation with the Netanyahu, US Senate leader Chuck Schumer called for a snap election in Israel, describing the veteran hawk as one of a number of “major obstacles” to a two-state solution and peace.\nPalestinian president Mahmud Abbas appointed Mohammed Mustafa, a long-trusted adviser on economic affairs, as prime minister, three weeks after his predecessor resigned.\nWashington and other powers have called for a reformed Palestinian Authority to take charge of all Palestinian territories after the end of the war.\nUS, Egyptian and Qatari mediators failed to broker a new truce in time for Ramadan, but Netanyahu said Thursday there was now “Qatari pressure on Hamas.”\n“As of this moment, there has been no real response from Hamas. They are still clinging to unacceptable demands,” he told representatives of hostages’ families.\n“As a result of our pressure... and also with your help, we are seeing — for the first time — Qatari pressure on Hamas.”\nThe war has resulted in severe shortages of medical supplies across Gaza, with only a fraction of hospitals partially functioning.\nWorld Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said aid had been delivered to Al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza, but said it was “struggling with water, sanitation, hygiene and waste management.”\n“Two of the hospital’s warehouses are no longer functional and are being used to shelter 7,000 displaced people,” he added.\nThe Spanish aid vessel Open Arms, pulling about 200 tons of food, was nearing Israel’s coast after departing Cyprus on Tuesday, the Marinetraffic website showed on Thursday.\nCypriot Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos said a second, bigger vessel was being readied for the aid corridor which, senior US officials have said, will be complemented by a temporary pier off Gaza to be built by American troops.\nDaily aid airdrops by multiple countries have been taking place this month, and Germany said it would join the effort.\nBut the air and sea missions are “no alternative” to land deliveries, 25 organizations including Amnesty International and Oxfam said in a statement.\nDire shortages have left many scrambling for scraps of aid, among them Mokhles Al-Masry, 27, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun to Beit Lahia in northern Gaza.\n“There is no food, nothing to feed our children. We can’t even find a bottle of baby milk. We’ve been wandering around since early morning, hoping that a plane would drop parachutes,” he said.\n“As you can see, these parachutes don’t cover one percent of people’s needs.”\nAmnesty’s secretary general, Agnes Callamard, said the international community seemed to have accepted that the war will drag on.\n“Why are you making an investment that is going to take two months?” she asked, referring to the Pentagon’s timeline for setting up the temporary pier which, it said, could enable the provision of more than two million meals a day.\nYemen’s Houthis attack ship in Gulf of Aden\n- The US military shot down four drones and one surface-to-air missile launched by the Houthis from regions under their control in Yemen\nAL-MUKALLA: A missile believed to have been launched by Yemen’s Houthi militia struck a vessel off Yemen’s southern city of Aden on Thursday, as the US military said that it had shot down a fresh barrage of Houthi missiles and drones in the Gulf of Aden.\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations, which documents ship attacks, said that it received a report from a vessel master about an explosion at “a distance astern of” the vessel while sailing 50 nautical miles southeast of Yemen’s city of Aden. The master reported no damage, and the crew was unharmed.\n“The vessel is proceeding to its next port of call. Authorities are investigating,” UKMTO said.\nThe latest ship attack comes as the US Central Command said that the Houthis launched one anti-ship ballistic missile from areas under their control between 2 a.m. and 4:50 p.m. (Sanaa time) on Wednesday against international commercial and naval ships in the Gulf of Aden, but no ship\nwas struck.\nOn Thursday, the US military shot down four drones and one surface-to-air missile launched by the Houthis from regions under their control in Yemen, according to a CENTCOM statement on social media site X.\nThe Houthis did not immediately take credit for assaulting the ship in the Gulf of Aden on Thursday or launching drones or missiles that were intercepted by US forces.\nHowever, the Houthis routinely claim credit for Red Sea ship strikes hours after they occur.\nHouthi media said on Thursday that the US and UK launched four strikes on the Al-Jah district of the Red Sea province of Hodeidah, a day after another round of strikes hit Hodeidah airport.\nSince November, the Houthis have fired hundreds of drones, missiles, and remotely controlled boats at commercial and navy ships in the Red Sea, Bab Al-Mandab Strait, and Gulf of Aden, claiming that their actions are intended to force Israel to allow humanitarian assistance, including water and food, into the Palestinian\nGaza Strip.\nAt the same time, the diplomatic missions of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the UK, and the US all condemned the Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea, including the Houthi missile attack on the Liberian-owned MV True Confidence, which killed two Filipino and one Vietnamese civilian sailors.\n“It is critical that the Houthis cease these attacks immediately. These illegal attacks have taken the lives of innocent sailors and only serve to destabilize the region and harm the people of Yemen,” the diplomats said in a joint statement.\nTurkiye’s foreign minister seeks Iraq’s support against Kurdish militant group\n- Turkiye has been seeking greater cooperation from Baghdad in its fight against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party\nBAGHDAD: Turkiye’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan was in Baghdad for high-level meetings on Thursday, ahead of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s expected visit next month and a potential Turkish offensive against a Kurdish militant group that maintains bases in Iraq.\nThe talks between the Turkish foreign minister and his Iraqi counterpart Fuad Hussein would focus on “counter-terrorism, security and military cooperation,” according to a statement carried by the state-run Iraqi News Agency.\nFidan was accompanied by Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler and Ibrahim Kalin, the director of Turkiye’s National Intelligence Organization.\nTurkiye has been seeking greater cooperation from Baghdad in its fight against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, a Kurdish separatist group that has waged an insurgency against Turkiye since the 1980s and is banned there.\nThe PKK is not officially outlawed in Iraq and has a foothold in northern Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, where the central Iraqi government does not have much influence.\nErdogan is expected to visit Iraq in April, after Turkish local elections on March 31.\nThe Turkish president has said that his country is determined to end PKK’s presence in Iraq this summer.\nTurkiye often launches strikes against targets in Syria and Iraq that it believes to be affiliated with the PKK, which Baghdad has complained is a breach of its sovereignty.\nThose strikes have escalated in recent months, after PKK attacks on Turkish military bases in northern Iraq in December and January left 21 soldiers dead.\nLocal Kurdish authorities in northeast Syria have said that many of the Turkish strikes targeted civilian infrastructure, cutting off electricity and water supplies in wide areas held by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces.\nQassim Al-Araji, the adviser for national security affairs to Iraq’s Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani, said in a televised interview this week that Iraqi authorities would like to take a similar approach to the PKK as they did to Iranian Kurdish dissident groups based in northern Iraq.\nThe presence of the Iranian dissidents had become a point of tension with Tehran and last summer, Iran and Iraq reached an agreement to disarm the dissident groups and relocate their members from military bases to displacement camps.\nPrint Edition\n[Read pdf version](/pdfissues/index.php) Subscribe now",

    "text": "Kristina Webb George Cohon, a part-time Palm Beach resident credited with bringing McDonald's to Russia and leading the iconic American restaurant's expansion throughout Canada, has died. Mr. Cohon, 86, died Nov. 24 at his home in Toronto, his family said in [an obituary](/obituaries/pwpb0639040). Survivors include his wife of 63 years, Susan; sons, Craig and Mark; daughter-in-law, Suzanne; three grandchildren; sister, Sandy Raizes; and nieces and nephews. More: [George Cohon overcame the odds to establish McDonald's in Russia](/story/news/2012/04/01/george-cohon-overcame-odds-to/9647461007/) \"Last night we said farewell to my Dad,\" George Cohon's son Mark posted Nov. 25 on the social media platform X. \"Our family, Canada and the world lost a remarkable man.\" As a McDonald's franchisee, Cohon borrowed $70,000 in 1967 to buy the first international license to bring the fast-food giant to Canada, opening his first location in London, Ontario, in 1968. For nearly 15 years from the late 1970s into the 1990s, he worked to bring the chain to Russia, opening the first Russian location in Moscow's Pushkin Square in 1990, a move he later referred to as \"hamburger diplomacy.\" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Cohon was \"remarkable.\" \"He was an accomplished businessman who never stopped giving back, and who dedicated himself to lifting others up,\" Trudeau said in a post on X, alongside a photo of himself with Cohon. \"Our families' paths crossed multiple times over the years, and his passion for serving — and supporting — others was always evident.\" Cohon also was a prolific philanthropist, donating to causes around the world and supporting many nonprofits in Palm Beach and Palm Beach County. He served on many nonprofits' boards and committees, including the executive committee of the Society of the Four Arts. \"It is with great regret and sadness that the Palm Beach Society of The Four Arts mourns the passing of George Alan Cohon, a long time trustee and valued member of its Executive Committee,\" the society said. \"George was a man of quick wit, always cheerful, a good friend of many, and loved by all. He will be greatly missed. Go, George, on wings of angels. We will meet again on the other side. From the thousand members of the society.\" He was recognized for his public service with awards in Canada, Russia and Israel. Cohon was born on April 19, 1937, in Chicago to parents Carolyn, a homemaker, and Jack Cohon, a lawyer who later became a baker. George Cohon attended Northwestern Law School, where he met his future wife, Susan. They married in 1960 and George graduated with his law degree in 1961. Cohon was drafted into the U.S. Air Force, then worked for his father's Chicago law firm, Cohon & Raizes. It was while working there that he met McDonald's founder Ray Kroc. Cohon represented someone in negotiations with Kroc, and Kroc recognized potential in Cohon. Speaking to the Palm Beach Daily News in 2010, Cohon said that when Kroc attended the ribbon-cutting for Cohon's first Canadian McDonald's, Kroc offered him $1 million for the Canadian rights to the business. Kroc told Cohon that everybody wants to be a millionaire, Cohon said. \"'If you want to be a millionaire tomorrow morning, you got it,'\" Cohon [recalled Kroc telling him](/story/news/2012/04/01/george-cohon-overcame-odds-to/9647461007/). \"My dad was sitting next to me and he poked me hard in the ribs. But I didn't go up there to sell out. It was a question of building an organization.\" Cohon built his franchise into an empire of McDonald's restaurants from coast to coast in the country. He and his family settled in Toronto, and in 1973 Cohon became a Canadian citizen. In addition to bringing McDonald's restaurants to the Great White North, Cohon also founded the Canadian arm of Ronald McDonald House Charities, which provides housing and support for families facing the challenges associated with medical care. His work included building what at the time was the largest Ronald McDonald House in the world, in Toronto. In 1976, Cohon was president of McDonald's Canada when he met a delegation from the Soviet Union, in town for the Summer Olympics in Montreal. He took the delegation to McDonald's, and asked the officials how they thought the chain would do in Russia. \"They said very good,\" Cohon told the Palm Beach Daily News in 2010. \"I said maybe we should think about taking a look at it.\" That was the beginning of years of work, with Cohon reportedly knocking on doors and making inroads with Soviet officials. In his best-selling 1999 autobiography, \"To Russia With Fries,\" Cohon said that there were tense meetings, including one in 1986 with a Moscow official where Cohon left with \"the impression that this awkward confrontation — Adam Smith in one corner; Karl Marx in the other — had ended without a decision.\" Despite setbacks, Cohon persisted, and eventually found himself negotiating a contract for a deal to bring McDonald's to the Soviet Union. At a Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce breakfast in 2014, Cohon said that just one point in the contract, of whether to serve Pepsi or Coca-Cola at the Pushkin Square restaurant, took four days to iron out. When that first McDonald's finally opened its doors, thousands of Russians were in line, and 34,000 people were served that first day. \"And it's still the busiest McDonald's in the world,\" he said in 2014, adding, \"What started as a Canadian dream is a Russian success story.\" After successfully launching McDonald's in the country, Cohon and his son, Craig, later would bring Cirque du Soleil to Russia. In his later years, Cohon enjoyed spending time with his family, pouring his efforts into his philanthropy and boating around Palm Beach. George and Susan Cohon moved part-time to the island about 25 years ago, with George telling the Palm Beach Daily News in 2018 that they fell in love with Palm Beach's beauty and ambience. \"This is where we want to be,\" he said. \"It's a special place, and choosing to live here has been a good decision.\" The couple was known for bringing their golden retrievers with them to visit families at the Quantum House in West Palm Beach, and branches of the Ronald McDonald House in Canada. In that 2018 interview, Cohon said he would launch his 48-foot Hinckley boat from his dock on the Intracoastal, going out to the ocean through either the Boynton Beach or Jupiter inlets. He was known to dock the boat, named the McHappy III, in the Bahamas, at the Ocean Reef Club in the Keys, or at the Sailfish Club. Throughout his life, Cohon said he enjoyed his work — and he encouraged others to do the same. \"If you're not having fun at a job, then change your job,\" he told the Palm Beach Chamber in 2014.",

    "text": "THURSDAY, Dec. 28, 2023 (HealthDay News) — A class of sedatives called benzodiazepines, which include meds like Ativan, Valium and Xanax, could be linked to higher odds for miscarriage if taken during pregnancy, new research finds.\nThe findings held even after accounting for possible confounding factors such as anxiety and insomnia, the Taiwanese research team said.\nLooking at data on about 3 million pregnancies, “we found that benzodiazepine use during pregnancy was associated with an approximately 70% increased risk of miscarriage,” wrote a team led by\nFei-Yuan Hsiao at Taiwan University’s Graduate Institute of Clinical Pharmacy.\nBased on the findings, they urge that doctors “meticulously balance” the risks and benefits of benzodiazepines whenever they consider prescribing the drugs to pregnant women who are dealing with insomnia or other psychiatric issues.\nIn the new study, miscarriage was defined as loss of pregnancy between the first prenatal visit with a doctor (typically around the 8th week of gestation) and before the 20th week.\nHsiao’s group looked at data from over 3 million pregnancies among Taiwanese women, out of which 4.4% resulted in a miscarriage.\nFocusing on the women’s prescription drug use during pregnancy, the study found that using a benzodiazepine boosted the odds for miscarriage by 69%.\nThat number was “consistent” regardless of confounding factors and the duration of benzodiazepine use.\nThe study was published Dec. 27 in the journal\nJAMA Psychiatry.\nHsiao’s group also pointed to the results of a prior British study. It found that miscarriage rates were 60% higher among women who took a benzodiazepine while pregnant, compared to women who had psychiatric issues that might warrant use of the drugs (for example depression or anxiety) but who were not prescribed one.\nAccording to the research team, benzodiazepines “can readily cross the placental barrier and accumulate substantially in embryo and fetal tissues.” In turn, that potentially “may cause fetal developmental abnormalities, ultimately leading to miscarriage,” they said.\nThe study was not designed to prove cause-and-effect and the absolute risk of miscarriage to any one woman remains low.\nNevertheless, Hsiao’s team believes that “prescribing benzodiazepines should only be considered following a comprehensive evaluation of the potential risks and benefits for both the mother and the child.”\nMore information\nFind out more about miscarriage at the\nMarch of Dimes.\nSDOURCE: JAMA Psychiatry, Dec. 27, 2023\nCopyright ",

    "title": "#World Snake Day: snake catcher aims to dispel misconceptions about serpents | Benoni City Times",
    "text": "July 16 is World Snake Day.\nThe day is observed annually to raise awareness of the wide variety of species around the world.\nThe Benoni City Times caught up with Christopher Mthombeni (44), a snake catcher who worked for the Ekurhuleni municipality.\nMthombeni said he has been wrangling these fascinating creatures for the past 22 years.\nChristopher Mthombeni hopes events like World Snake Day will change the public perception of these cold-blooded reptiles. The 44-year-old’s passion for snakes began while he was still a teenager while exploring the outdoors with the Scouts and Girls Guide Association.\n“I fell in love with nature. After finishing school I pursued a nature conservation course,” he said.\nMthombeni said some of the snakes that are commonly found in Ekurhuleni include rinkhals, puff adder, skaapsteker and herald snake.\nThe snake catcher said to be able to differentiate between venomous and non-venomous snakes people must consider diving into books, watching shows, or even visiting zoos.\nChristopher Mthombeni rescues a snake. “Understanding these species is crucial, especially due to urban developments and illegal dumping spaces that create new habitats for them.\n“Snakes are usually more scared of humans than we are of them, however, don’t underestimate them because they can defend themselves if provoked.\n“One of the misconceptions about snakes is the idea that the only good snake is a dead snake. Snakes play a vital role in our ecosystem by controlling pests.”\nMthombeni advises people to stay calm, keep their distance and call a professional snake catcher when they encounter a snake.\n“Never try to handle or kill it,” he warns.\nMthombeni’s message for World Snake Day is to “respect, observe, and appreciate these remarkable creatures.”\nAlso Read: SNAKE ROAD: Roads department grappling with options\nAlso Read: Watch: Chameleon bites venomous snake",

    "text": "SINGAPORE: On a sleepy Wednesday evening in mid-August 2023, nine men and one woman were charged in Singapore’s State Courts with various, seemingly nondescript financial crimes: Possessing criminal benefits, forging bank statements and laundering money.\nIn the hours that followed, the story came to life via explosive headlines: The 10 suspects were part of an islandwide operation two years in the making ; all hailed from China and with a background of criminal activity, laying roots in Singapore and quietly running illegal gains through the country’s reputable financial system, to gain a veneer of legitimacy.\nMillions of dollars earned over the years from an illicit gambling ring - with Southeast Asian bases and aimed at punters in China - were turned into luxury cars, extravagant watches, properties in Singapore’s most lavish neighbourhoods, jewellery, designer goods, cryptocurrency and cold, hard cash.\nOn Monday (Jun 10), the last of the 10 offenders was sentenced to jail .\nBut there may yet be further developments involving others linked to the probe - including 17 suspects on the run, the wives or partners of the 10 and other fringe parties such as bank employees or real estate agents who failed to flag suspicious transactions.\nWho are the 10 offenders, and what did they do? Here's a breakdown.\nSu Wenqiang Cambodian national\nPleaded guilty to: 2 counts of money laundering\nSentenced to: 13 months' jail\nAdditional info: First to plead guilty, forfeited 100% of his assets (about S$6 million)\nSu Haijin Cypriot national\nPleaded guilty to: 1 count of resisting arrest, 2 counts of money laundering\nSentenced to: 14 months' jail\nAdditional info: Former director of No Signboard Holdings, hospitalised for fractures sustained in jumping off balcony. Forfeited 95% in assets (more than S$165 million)\nWang Baosen Chinese national\nPleaded guilty to: 2 counts of money laundering\nSentenced to: 13 months' jail\nAdditional info: Forfeited 100% in assets (about S$8 million)\nSu Baolin Cambodian national\nPleaded guilty to: 2 counts of money laundering, 1 count of conspiring to make false representations\nSentenced to: 14 months' jail\nAdditional info: Forfeited 90% in assets (about S$65 million)\nZhang Ruijin Chinese national\nPleaded guilty to: 2 counts of forgery, 1 count of money laundering\nSentenced to: 15 months' jail\nAdditional info: Lin Baoying's partner. Forfeited 90% in assets (about S$118 million)\nVang Shuiming Turkish national\nPleaded guilty to: 1 count of forgery, 2 counts of money laundering\nSentenced to: 13 months and 6 weeks' jail\nAdditional info: Had the highest number of total charges and assets seized, took out the most applications in his bid to get bail. Forfeited 90% in assets (about S$179 million)\nChen Qingyuan Cambodian national\nPleaded guilty to: 1 count of forgery, 2 counts of money laundering\nSentenced to: 15 months' jail\nAdditional info: Forfeited 91% in assets (about S$21.3 million)\nLin Baoying Chinese national\nPleaded guilty to: 2 counts of forgery, 1 count of money laundering\nSentenced to: 15 months' jail\nAdditional info: Forfeited 90% in assets (about S$154 million)\nWang Dehai Cypriot national\nPleaded guilty to: 1 count of money laundering\nSentenced to: 16 months' jail\nAdditional info: Had among the longest stints working for the gambling syndicate. Forfeited about 90% in assets (about S$49.2 million)\nSu Jianfeng Vanuatu national\nPleaded guilty to: 1 count of forgery, 1 count of money laundering\nSentenced to: 17 months' jail\nAdditional info: Forfeited about 95% in assets (about S$179 million)\nHow were they caught? First hints of the case surfaced in 2021, with the police receiving dribs and drabs of information on forged bank documents.\nSuspicious transaction alerts were filed by financial institutions, and the police looked into these before building up an intelligence probe.\nRelated: Billion-dollar money laundering case: Singapore police began ‘comprehensive intelligence probe’ in early 2022 The police also uncovered a web of links between the 10 offenders.\nFor example, Zhang Ruijin and Lin Baoying were lovers and friends with Su Haijin, Su Baolin and the two Sus' wives. They had gone on holiday together as a large group.\nEven if not directly linked to each other, the offenders could be traced somehow to the criminal syndicate running illegal gambling centres in Southeast Asia.\nSu Jianfeng advertised the gambling websites and managed workers who ran and maintained them, while Su Baolin started out as a gambler before being roped into operating or supervising the websites.\nWang Dehai - who was in the business for 10 years from 2012 - worked in customer service for the remote gambling enterprise before becoming a promoter. He was given a 3 per cent share in annual profits, with his total income in 2016 alone amounting to more than S$15 million.\nHe recruited his cousin and co-accused Su Wenqiang into the business.\nAfter consulting with the Attorney-General's Chambers on the strength of its evidence, Singapore police eventually launched an islandwide operation in August last year.\nOver 400 officers were involved and the 10 offenders were arrested at either condominiums, landed properties or Good Class Bungalows in areas like Sentosa Cove, Tanglin, Orchard, Holland and River Valley.",

I kickstart my morning with a quick Peloton workout, ensuring I’m physically energized for the day ahead. Spending precious moments with my two boys in the morning is essential; it sets a positive tone for the day. My older son heads to pre-k, and the nanny takes care of my youngest, Oliver, giving me dedicated work time.\nI have a cozy office in my house, separate from the main living area, which allows me to maintain focus. In the morning, I dive into my inbox, attend to emails, and engage in writing tasks, which might include articles, social media posts, or progress on my upcoming book due by the end of 2023. I also manage meetings and follow up with potential candidates for open positions, all while advancing ongoing projects and addressing business development needs.\nIn the afternoon, I switch gears to pick up my son from school and cherish quality time with both my boys. The key to my productivity lies in a balanced approach: moving my body, actively pursuing my goals, and, most importantly, keeping my family, which is my top value, at the forefront of my daily priorities. This harmonious blend fuels my productivity and fulfillment throughout the day.\nHow do you bring ideas to life?\nBringing ideas to life involves a combination of collaboration and swift action. Here’s a breakdown of my process:\n1. Conceptualization: Start by brainstorming and generating ideas. This can be done individually or through collaboration with others. Group discussions often lead to a wider range of perspectives and creative solutions.\n2. Evaluation: Assess the feasibility and potential impact of each idea. Consider factors like resources required, time constraints, and alignment with goals or objectives.\n3. Planning: Once a viable idea is selected, create a detailed plan outlining the steps needed to execute it. Define roles and responsibilities if working with a team.\n4. Action: Don’t delay. Begin implementing my idea as soon as possible. Procrastination can lead to missed opportunities or diminished enthusiasm.\n5. Adaptation: Be open to adjusting the plan as I progress. Not every detail can be anticipated, and flexibility is key to overcoming unexpected challenges.\n6. Feedback: Continuously seek feedback from stakeholders, team members, or potential users. Their input can help refine the idea and make it even better.\n7. Persistence: The process of bringing an idea to life can be challenging. Staying committed, remain resilient in the face of setbacks, and keep refining and iterating as necessary.\n8. Celebration: When the idea reaches fruition, take a moment to celebrate success and acknowledge the efforts of those involved.\nBy combining collaboration with a bias toward action and adaptability, I can effectively bring ideas to life and turn them into tangible achievements.\nWhat’s one trend that excites you?\nThe trend of companies prioritizing employee well-being and development is indeed exciting. It’s a shift towards a more human-centric approach to work, and it has the potential to create a positive ripple effect not only within organizations, but also in society as a whole. When employees are happier, more engaged, and supported in their growth, they are likely to be more productive, creative, and innovative. This, in turn, can lead to more sustainable businesses and a better quality of life for individuals. It’s a trend that aligns with the idea that when people thrive at work, they contribute to a happier and more fulfilled world beyond the workplace, and that’s truly inspiring.\nWhat is one habit that helps you be productive?\nOne habit that helps me be productive is setting clear and prioritized daily goals. Each morning, I identify the most important tasks I need to accomplish and create a to-do list with a clear order of priority. This habit helps me stay focused and organized throughout the day, ensuring that I tackle the most critical tasks first and maintain a sense of accomplishment as I check them off my list.\nWhat advice would you give your younger self?\nThe advice to trust the process and have faith in the journey is valuable. Here’s a message to my younger self:\nDear Younger Self,\nTrust the process of life. There will be moments of uncertainty and challenges that may seem insurmountable, but remember that everything happens for a reason. The struggles and successes, the highs and lows – they all play a part in shaping who you become. Have faith that the path you’re on will lead to valuable lessons and opportunities for growth. Even when things don’t make sense at the moment, they will eventually fall into place. Embrace each experience as a stepping stone toward a brighter future.\nWith patience and perseverance, you’ll find your way. Keep believing in yourself, keep learning, and keep moving forward. The journey is as important as the destination, and it will all be worth it.\nSincerely, Your Wiser Self\nTell us something you believe almost nobody agrees with you.\nWhile the idea of waking up early is often associated with productivity, I believe that the optimal wake-up time can vary from person to person. Some individuals are naturally more productive during later hours, and it’s essential to align your schedule with your circadian rhythms and personal preferences. It’s not always necessary to wake up super early to be productive. The key is to find a routine that works best for you and allows you to maximize your productivity and overall well-being.\nThe habit of embracing discomfort and taking risks. Stepping outside your comfort zone is where personal growth and learning often occur. I recommend that everyone should make a conscious effort to get uncomfortable regularly. Challenge yourself, take risks, and put yourself in situations where you might face rejection or failure. It’s in these moments of discomfort that you discover your true potential, build resilience, and learn valuable lessons. Embracing discomfort is a powerful catalyst for personal growth and can lead to meaningful and transformative experiences.\nWhen you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do?\nWhen I find myself overwhelmed or struggling to focus, I turn to physical activity. Whether it’s a workout, dancing, or simply taking a walk, moving my body helps me reset and re-energize. It clears my mind, reduces stress, and allows me to return to my tasks with a renewed sense of focus and clarity. Physical activity is my go-to method for regaining balance and productivity when things get overwhelming.\nOne of the most impactful strategies that has propelled my career and business growth is prioritizing relationships. I’ve found that cultivating meaningful connections with others, both personally and professionally, can open doors and create opportunities that might not have been possible otherwise. I actively engage with my network by consistently sharing my business endeavors on social media platforms. This not only keeps my network informed about my work, but also encourages referrals and recommendations. In fact, the majority of my clients have come through referrals from friends, family, and connections within my network. By building and maintaining strong relationships, I’ve not only gained valuable clients, I have also established a reputation as someone trustworthy and reliable in my field. This strategy has driven business growth and enriched my career with a network of supportive individuals who continue to contribute to my success.\nA failure in my career has been underestimating my capability and my worth in previous roles that I took or turned down. One example is making a decision to give a role to someone less qualified due to personal reasons, resulting in taking a step down from a position I had worked hard to earn. From these experiences, I learned the importance of pausing, reflecting, and taking the time to carefully consider my decisions.\nI realized that quick, impulsive responses based on short-term benefits can sometimes lead to long-term setbacks. It taught me the value of a more deliberate and proactive approach to decision-making. I now prioritize looking at the long-term rewards and considering the impact of my choices on my career and personal goals. These failures served as valuable lessons in making decisions that align with my desired outcomes and contribute to my future success.\nWhat is one business idea you’re willing to give away to our readers?\nIf you’re seeking cost-effective support for your business, consider utilizing Handshake to find interns. It’s a win-win situation where you can offload tasks and provide valuable experience to someone in your field. Handshake is a platform used by colleges nationwide to connect current and alumni students with open positions.\nLinkedIn is a crucial software tool for me. I use it for networking in my business and also to identify potential candidates for roles I’m recruiting for clients.\nWhat is the best $100 you recently spent?\nI invested in a ticket to attend The Powerhouse Women event in Scottsdale, AZ. It provided valuable information, motivation in my business goals, reconnections with friends, and new connections with inspiring women in business, leading to valuable resources.\nI’ve gained significant value from “The Learning Leader Show” with Ryan Hawk due to its insightful and brilliant guest speakers. Additionally, “Buy Back Your Time” by Dan Martell has equipped me with valuable tools to scale my business and reclaim more time in my day.\nWhat’s a movie or series you recently enjoyed and why?\nThe recent movie, “Barbie” was enjoyable because it addresses women’s challenges and empowerment in a thoughtful way. Films that explore these themes can be not only entertaining, but also thought-provoking and inspiring. It encouraged important conversations and reflection on gender equality and feminism in society today.\nKey learnings:\n● Prioritizing relationships, both personal and professional, is a crucial driver of career and business success.\n● Embracing discomfort and taking calculated risks fosters personal growth and development.\n● Effective decision-making involves pausing, reflecting, and considering the long-term consequences of choices.\n● Utilizing online platforms like Handshake can provide cost-effective support for businesses through internships.\n● Engaging in physical activity, such as exercise or dancing, is an effective strategy to reset and regain focus when feeling overwhelmed or unfocused.\n ",
