    "text": "Kate Middleton and Prince Willaim are said to have made a kind last-minute gesture during Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s final engagement as senior members of the royal family. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped away from the royal family back in 2020.During the 2020 Commonwealth Day service, Harry and Meghan \\\"became emotional and upset\\\" after they were not allowed to join the senior royals in the main VIP party. The two were expected to make their own way to the front of Westminster Abbey, where they were to wait for the other members of the royal family to arrive.In an attempt to diffuse the tension, Kate and her husband, William, reportedly offered to join the Sussexes as they waited for the Queen to arrive. Things, however, did not really go to plan as 2,000 orders of service that had already been printed stipulated that the Prince and Princess of Wales would arrive with the other members of the royal family.The two couples later reportedly exchanged brief and uncomfortable greetings before taking their seats in the Abbey. Despite the Waleses’ peace offering, things remained cold.‘The frayed relationships could not be concealed’The year before that, Kate and Meghan greeted each other with a peck on the cheek, both looking warmer. In the book Revenge: Meghan, Harry and the War between the Windsors, royal author Tom Bower said that a \\\"monumental argument\\\" had taken place after \\\"palace officials ... decided to publicly humiliate [Harry and Meghan].\\\"\\\"Reality hit two days later, on 9th March. A monumental argument blew up after Harry was told that he and Meghan could not join the family's procession through Westminster Abbey for the annual Commonwealth Day Service,” Bower wrote. \\\"Although the order of service listed Harry and Meghan walking behind the Queen, Palace officials had revised their decision. Suspicious about the Sussexes they decided to publicly humiliate them.\\\"He added, \\\"Harry was told that having stepped down from royal duties, he and Meghan would sit and wait with the congregation. The prospect of the televised image of their isolation in the Abbey appalled them.\\\"Bower suggested that William \\\"had not offered a brotherly welcome\\\" to Harry, and Kate was \\\"outright distant\\\" towards Meghan. \\\"Eventually, to end the dispute, William and Kate agreed they too would wait with Harry and Meghan. As the members of the Royal Family filed into the Abbey, the frayed relationships could not be concealed,” he added.",

    "text": "Future of Bollywood Verses - Forecasts and Patterns for the Upcoming Years\nThe 90's saw the birth of a few new and promising lyricists. However, the sector still battled to get rid of its product number practice.\nFrom Gulzar To Javed Akhtar Tracing The Evolution Of Bollywood Lyrics Through Eras\nBy this time 2 of the earliest stalwarts of Bollywood poetry - Indeevar and Anand Bakhshi-- had actually died. And the rest were creating products that were nonsensical and usually profane.\nThemes\nThe most effective Bollywood tunes combine a memorable beat, soulful tunes and unforgettable lyrics. These tracks have come to be the soundtracks to the lives of lots of Bollywood fans. The greatest hits in the last few years have been enchanting ballads that tell a story with words. Thing numbers on the other hand are typically without any lyrical worth, although a few like \"super professional dancer aaye\" (Dance Dancing) and \"meri umar ke\" (Kasam Paida Karne Wale Ki) have been exceptions.\nIn the 90's a brand-new type of lyricist went into Bollywood with a fresh approach to poetry. Most of these lyricists were affected by the style of Ghazal and likewise adopted a mix of Urdu and Hindi. This triggered a blurring of the line between austere Urdu and street Hindi.\nSeveral of these lyricists were Indeevar, Anand Bakshi, Majrooh, Gulshan Bawara and Verma Malik. During this era, a blend of slang and poetic Hindi started to go into Bollywood in addition to a hint of Punjabi in tunes like \"maangta hai kya?\" (Rangeela) and \"kachche dhaage\" (Maachis). A resurgence of rhyming knowledgeable also occurred throughout this period.\nDesigns\nThroughout the 80's, several elderly lyricists were losing their hold in Bollywood. Gulzar (Thodi Si Bewafai, Masoom, Agnipariksha), Majrooh (Kudrat, Saajan Ki Saheli, Sanam Teri Kasam) and Yogesh were still generating good verse, yet they were no longer obtaining as much job.\nThe junior lyricists attempted their ideal to fill in the space left by the elders. A lot of them like Neeraj and Kaifi Azmi had the ability to make a mark in Bollywood with their quality lyrics.\nThis age additionally saw the increase of Ghazal in Bollywood. It was a fad that would continue to expand over the following decade. Ghazals were composed by lyricists and sung by vocalists like Lata Mangeshkar, Rafi and Kishore Kumar. They used a mix of Urdu and Hindi. This mix was a reflection of the altering target market base of Bollywood. The audience now was less curious about austere Urdu words and a simpler Hindi-Urdu mix was chosen by them.\nLyricists\nBollywood songs has actually inspired many generations, and the future looks brilliant for this cherished style. Its unique blend of conventional Indian songs with modern Western impacts has actually captured the hearts of millions of fans worldwide.\nLyricists have the ability to record the significance of the story in their songs and create unforgettable melodies that make sure to motivate groups. These tracks can help motivate and energize teams, giving them the power they require to tackle difficult difficulties.\nWhether it is a bleak love song or an uplifting anthem, Bollywood songs has something for every person!\nSome say that Hindi in film songs has lost its quality, however others disagree. According to lyricist Manoj Muntashir, Hindi film verses have actually dropped a few of their \"additional pounds.\" Gone are the days when a number like 'Chaar container vodka' (Ragini MMS 2) looked ridiculous or a poetry word such as' suit, catch, touch, connect, patch' looked strange. Instead, a lyrical piece such as 'Gulzar Sahab's Aankhein Bhi Kamaal Karti Hain, Personal Se Sawaal Karti Hai' is much more relatable today.\nAudience\nTunes are the spirit of many Bollywood formula films and filmmakers do not mind spending a lion's share of their budget for penning a catchy track. They function as a bait to lure the audience right into the theaters for the movie.\nNonetheless, a lot of offbeat tracks have been making it to the charts lately. These tracks have actually been able to\nbest lyrics as captions get eyeballs owing to their wacky lyrics. However does that indicate these tunes will have a resilient effect on the target markets?\nThe 1970's saw a progressive decline in the high quality of Bollywood verses. The lyrical richness of Urdu began to fade and a simpler version of Urdu-Hindi began to be utilized. The decade also observed the leave of a number of senior lyricists like Jaan Nisar Akhtar, Raja M H Khan and Sahir.",

    "title": "Break con temporali e grandine, ma sulle Marche resta l’allarme per la siccità",
    "text": "ANCONA - Dopo un’altra settimana con la febbre a 40° o giù di lì (ieri la massima è stata registrata nelle stazioni Potenza 1 di San Severino Marche e di Acqualagna, con 39,8°) ci aspetta un fine settimana più movimentato, con temperature in calo domani di 5-6° e il rischio di temporali accompagnati anche da grandine. A conclusione di una lunga fase di alta pressione - stando alle previsioni dell’ultimo bollettino dell&#039;agenzia regionale Amap - una bolla instabile raggiungerà l’Italia già sabato «accendendo la miccia per precipitazioni anche a carattere temporalesco, localmente intense e accompagnate da grandine». Termometro giù I valori termici regrediranno di qualche grado. «Ma non c’è da illudersi - mettono in guardia i meteorologi di Amap - poiché, passate tali infiltrazioni umide e più fresche, la settimana prossima vedrà l’alta pressione riprendersi la scena per diversi giorni». Per oggi intanto è prevista sulle Marche una giornata di bel tempo, senza precipitazioni e con temperature massime ovunque superiori ai 30°, con picchi nei capoluoghi a Macerata (36°) e Ancona (34°). Ma domani lo scenario è destinato a cambiare sulla nostra regione, con «precipitazioni possibili già nel corso della mattinata a nord - si legge nel bollettino dell’Amap -, in discesa sparsa nelle ore centrali, localmente a carattere di rovescio o temporale anche grandinigeno, coinvolgendo con più enfasi la fascia litoranea». I fenomeni sono destinati a scomparire verso l’Appennino nel corso del pomeriggio, mentre le temperature sono previste in diminuzione, «corposa per i valori massimi». Già da domenica è previsto il ritorno del bel tempo, al massimo con velature in quota e cumuli sull’entroterra e una bassa probabilità di isolati piovaschi o acquazzoni nella fascia oraria centrale sull&#039;Appennino, specie nel versante ascolano. Anche per lunedì è previsto tempo sereno, con qualche velatura, anche se non possono escludersi isolati e brevi fenomeni sui Sibillini nel pomeriggio. Previsioni che non cambiano lo scenario sul fronte della siccità, come conferma l’ultimo bollettino settimanale diffuso dall’Anbi, l’associazione dei consorzi di bacino, sullo stato risorse idriche italiane. Per le Marche si segnala in crescita il livello idrometrico del fiume Potenza, che resta però inferiore agli scorsi anni (-21 cm sul 2023), mentre continuano a calare l’Esino e il Tronto, ridotti ormai ai livelli minimi dell’ultimo quinquennio. Sulla mostra regione il deficit di precipitazioni da inizio 2024 segnalato dall’Anbi si attesta intorno al 22% nel confronto sul quinquennio. Ma lo scarto negativo - secondo i rilievi dell’Amap - è decisamente superiore (-34,3%) se confrontato con la media del trentennio 1991-2020. Alla fine di luglio la carenza di precipitazione giornaliera cumulata nella Marche ha raggiunto i 187,8 mm, con un deficit di oltre un terzo e a luglio la precipitazione media mensile ha superato a fatica i 15 mm, a fronte di una media 1991-2020 di 43,2 mm. Il bollettino Anbi E anche a giugno, rileva il bollettino dell’Anbi, sulle zone pianeggianti delle Marche la pioggia si è quasi dimezzata rispetto alla media. Il risultato? Una severità idrica alta nei territori meridionali della regione, mentre gli invasi trattengono ancora 46,74 milioni di metri cubi d’acqua. Situazione critica anche nell’Ambito Territoriale 1 (provincia di Pesaro Urbino) al centro mercoledì di un nuovo incontro operativo della Protezione civile. Segnalato un mancato apporto agli invasi del Furlo, San Lazzaro e Tavernelle per circa 450- 500 litri al secondo.",
