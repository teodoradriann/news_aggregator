    "text": "[Wisdom] is a tree of life to those who take hold of her. — Proverbs 3:18\nWhen gold seeker Edward Jackson set out for California during the Great Gold Rush in the US, his diary entry on May 20, 1849, lamented his grueling wagon journey, marked by disease and death. “O do not leave my bones here,” he wrote. “If possible let them lay at home.” Another gold-seeker named John Walker penned, “It is the most complete lottery that you can imagine . . . . I cannot advise any person to come.”\nWalker, in fact, returned home and succeeded at farming, ranching, and state politics. When a family member took Walker’s yellowing letters to the American TV program Antiques Roadshow, they were valued at several thousand dollars. Said the TV host, “So he did get something valuable out of the Gold Rush. The letters.”\nEven more, both Walker and Jackson returned home after gaining wisdom that caused them to take hold of a more practical life. Consider these words about wisdom from King Solomon, “Blessed are those who find wisdom . . . . She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her” (Proverbs 3:13, 18). A wise choice is “more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold” (v. 14) — making wisdom more precious than any earthly desire (v. 15).\n“Long life is in her right hand . . . and all her paths are peace” (vv. 16–17). Our challenge, therefore, is to hold tight to wisdom, not shiny wishes. It’s a path God will bless. — Patricia Raybon\nWhat shiny wishes have you been chasing in life? Where could the path of wisdom take you instead?\nHeavenly Father, when I’m blinded by the lure of shiny wishes, inspire me to take hold of wiser choices, walking the path of wisdom back to Your blessed peace.\nFollow us on social media: ourdailybreadpilipinas, web: odb.org and filipino-odb.org,\nand check our resources at ourdailybreadpilipinas.org.",

    "title": "Trump Is Back on Colorado’s Primary Ballot—for Now",
    "text": "As Donald Trump faces a quartet of indictments on top of a civil fraud trial that could strip him of his businesses, the embattled former president is back on the ballot in Colorado . The Colorado Republican Party on Wednesday appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court in a bid to overturn the Colorado Supreme Court’s Dec. 19 ruling that “found by clear and convincing evidence that President Trump engaged in insurrection” on Jan. 6, 2021, thus declaring him ineligible to hold office under the U.S. Constitution’s insurrection clause . Trump would be stricken from the state’s 2024 presidential primary ballot, the court ruled, simultaneously staying the decision until Jan. 4 in the event of a GOP appeal. In their appeal, Republican Party lawyers argued that the Colorado Supreme Court showed “unprecedented disregard” for the First Amendment rights of political parties and voters to pick a candidate of their choosing. On Thursday, Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold’s office issued a statement, saying, “With the appeal filed, Donald Trump will be included as a candidate on Colorado’s 2024 Presidential Primary Ballot when certification occurs on January 5, 2024, unless the U.S. Supreme Court declines to take the case or otherwise affirms the Colorado Supreme Court ruling.” In a comment provided by her spokesman, Griswold emphasized her support for the original ban, a 4-3 ruling, to stand. “Donald Trump engaged in insurrection and was disqualified under the Constitution from the Colorado Ballot,” Griswold said. “The Colorado Supreme Court got it right. This decision is now being appealed. I urge the U.S. Supreme Court to act quickly given the upcoming presidential primary election.” Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment was added following the Civil War, and was intended to block members of the Confederacy from returning to power. Legal theorists have been split on whether or not Trump should be disqualified, hinging primarily on whether or not he was “an officer of the United States” while serving as president. The U.S. Supreme Court has never before ruled on the issue. Multiple efforts to disqualify Trump from the ballot in numerous states have been playing out in recent months. On Wednesday, the Michigan Supreme Court decided to allow Trump’s name to appear on the state’s primary ballot. Trump has decried the attempts to block him from running as a “pathetic gambit” to rig the election. Read more at The Daily Beast.",

    "text": "Recientemente, una encuesta de ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos mostró que la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris ganaría contra el virtual candidato republicano Donald Trump y tal parece que Joe Biden mira de reojo dicho ejercicio estadístico.\nSin hacer referencia a dicha encuesta, el presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, expresó este jueves su confianza en la vicepresidenta, Kamala Harris, afirmando que no la habría elegido como su compañera de fórmula en las elecciones de 2020 si no estuviera convencido de que podría ejercer el cargo de la Presidencia “desde el principio”.\n“ No la habría elegido si no hubiera pensado que estaba cualificada para ser presidenta desde el principio. No me ando con rodeos en eso. Ella está cualificada para ser presidenta “, afirmó el mandatario en una rueda de prensa en los márgenes de la cumbre de la OTAN en Washington.\nConferencia de Biden, en vivo: el presidente enfrenta reto tras varios errores https://t.co/lawd6ftkMr\n— La Opinión (@LaOpinionLA) July 11, 2024 Harris suena como la única opción viable si Biden se viera obligado a retirarse de la contienda a estas alturas de la campaña, a un mes de la convención del partido demócrata, debido a las dudas sobre su edad (81 años) y su capacidad para renovar un mandato de cuatro años en noviembre.\nBiden alabó a su vicepresidenta, que en ante una hipotética incapacidad del mandatario asumiría el poder.\n“Ha manejado temas de libertad de los cuerpos de la mujeres y el control de sus cuerpos muy bien. Segundo, ha mostrado capacidad de manera casi cualquier tema. Es una dura fiscal. Es una sola frase: es muy buena”, insistió Biden.\nLas encuestas tras en debate presidencial del 27 de junio contra el republicano Donald Trump dan una mayor ventaja a Harris en una hipotético enfrentamiento electoral en noviembre si Biden se retirase por las presiones de algunos miembros de su partido.\nEl mal desempeño del mandatario en ese cara a cara elevó las dudas sobre su capacidad de vencer a Trump en noviembre y de seguir en el poder un segundo mandato, que finalizaría a los 86 años.\nPese a ello, el discurso de Biden mp ha cambiado y ha rechazado retirarse y aseguró hoy de nuevo que es el mejor posicionado para vencer a Trump.\n*Con información de EFE.\nSigue leyendo:\n• Conferencia de Biden: el presidente enfrentó reto tras críticas sobre su capacidad para ser candidato\n• Biden confunde a Zelenski y lo llama Putin en cumbre de la OTAN\n• ¿Cómo ven los latinos a Kamala Harris?

Despite the lack of family by his side, Charlie's spirit was never alone.” Xiarhos, who says he is a Gold Star father, adds that he understands “the pain of loss and the importance of remembrance.” “My own journey of grief has taught me that we, as a community, must be the family for those who have none,” Xiarhos added. “In honoring Charlie, we not only pay tribute to his life and service but also uphold our duty to support and remember every veteran who has served our nation.” Connolly was buried in the state’s national cemetery among 78,000 other heroes in what was a full military funeral according to the state representative.

    "text": "Trump signed an executive order this afternoon, directing the Department Of Justice to investigate two former White House employees, one of whom admitted to being part of the \"resistance\" inside Trump's first administration.\nMiles Taylor, an intelligence expert, was an appointee who served in the Department of Homeland Security from 2017 to 2019, under the Trump administration. Taylor also served as chief of staff of the DHS. In 2018, he penned an anonymous op-ed in the New York Times, titled “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.\"\nToday, Trump revoked security clearance for Taylor, as well as ordering the DOJ to investigate him, saying: “It's time to find out whether or not somebody can do that. I think he's guilty of treason.\"\nTaylor came under fire at the time the Op-ed was published, and later admitted in a 2020 book titled A Warning, that he had written the piece. Taylor was the first former Trump administration official to endorse Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential campaign.\nIn a 2023 interview with MSNBC, Taylor said: \"A number of folks who worked in the Trump administration with me and have since spoken out against the ex-president, we joke darkly about the fact that in a second term, a number of us will be in orange jumpsuits in Guantanamo Bay.\"\nAdding to his slew of executive orders since entering office, Trump also signed an order to investigate Chris Krebs, who previously served as Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the United States Department of Homeland Security.\nDuring the signing, Trump’s advisor said “Chris Krebs… this is a man who weaponized his position against free speech in the election context… this instructs your department of justice.. to investigate..”\nTrump responded, “We’re gonna find out about this guy too. This guy is a wise guy.”\nTrump mimicked Krebs saying, “This is the most secure election in the history of our country!” then adding, “No this was a disaster.”\nAs he signed the order, Trump added that Krebs is a “fraud” and a “disgrace.”\nTrump signed the orders just hours after announcing that the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on China would be increasing to 125%. He also announced a 90-day pause on all other trade tariffs.\nFor the latest local news and features on Irish America, visit our homepage here.",

    "text": "WRITTEN BY: Laurence Tognetti, MSc 1 Can cannabis be a suitable substitute for cigarettes as the price of the latter continues to rise? This is what a recent study published in the Journal of Population Economics hopes to address as a team of Australian researchers led by Curtin University investigated the economic relationship between using cannabis or tobacco over an individual’s lifetime in Australia, specifically regarding the rising prices of cigarettes over cannabis over the long term. This study holds the potential to help researchers and the public better understand the pros and cons of cannabis compared to cigarettes around the world.\nFor the study, the researchers analyzed survey data obtained from the Australian National Drug Survey Strategy Household Survey from almost 100,000 Australians between 2001 and 2019 to ascertain behavior patterns between cannabis and cigarettes as prices of cigarettes increased. The team found that for individuals under 40, cannabis use decreased as cigarette prices increased, with no changes being reported for individuals between ages 40 and 50. In contrast, the researchers found that individuals aged 50 and up increased their cannabis use as cigarette prices increased.\n“In economics, we have this idea that people behave rationally, that we act according to price,” said Dr. Ranjodh Singh , who is a senior lecturer in the School of Accounting, Economics, and Finance at Curtin University and a co-author on the study. “But different segments of the population will respond differently to price increases, that’s why we use the term ‘life cycle approach’ when looking at consumption. So, on average, increasing tobacco prices makes cannabis use go down — but the opposite is true for this particular age group.”\nMuch like the United States, the legalization of cannabis across the country remains checkered, with some Aussie territories having decriminalized cannabis while others make it legal for personal use but not legal to sell.\nWhat new connections between cannabis and tobacco will researchers make in the coming years and decades? Only time will tell, and this is why we science!\nAs always, keep doing science & keep looking up!\nSources: Journal of Population Economics , EurekAlert!\nShare About the Author Laurence Tognetti, MSc Master's (MA/MS/Other) Laurence Tognetti is a six-year USAF Veteran who earned both a BSc and MSc from the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University.

    "text": "usatsi_22874713_168400956_lowres Nathan MacKinnon is the Colorado Avalanche&#039;s only No. 1 overall draft pick but other first-rounders have thrived in burgundy and blue. Three current top picks have elevated their play to elite status — Gabriel Landeskog, Mikko Rantanen and Cale Makar. The 2023-24 season was a career-best for MacKinnon and Makar and a second-best for Rantanen. The star forwards and defenseman led the Avalanche to earn 107 points but the team was eliminated from the Stanley Cup Playoffs in the second round by the Dallas Stars. MacKinnon was the top overall choice in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft and has proven his worth with only one fewer than 50 points season and two with more than 100. He is a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy this season and has been in the running for the accolade three other years. Colorado drafted its captain second overall in 2011 and although he has missed the last two seasons due to a knee injury, Landeskog has played a crucial role on and off the ice. &quot;We can&#039;t go and get a guy the caliber, player or the person that that Gabe is. His injury has been challenging in a lot of ways but not more challenging than what he&#039;s going through,&quot; GM Chris MacFarland said. &quot;He loves the game. He&#039;s a massive cog in what we&#039;re trying to do. And he&#039;s earned the right to have as much time as it takes to get back on the ice.&quot; The 6-foot-1 Swedish native has only fallen short of at least 50 points in two of his 11 NHL seasons and earned his career-high 75 points in the 2018-19 season. He led his team to a Stanley Cup in 2022 but has been recovering from a knee injury he sustained during the 2020-21 season. He underwent cartilage replacement surgery in May 2023 and is hoping to return to the ice sometime during the 2024-25 season. At the age of 25, Makar has already proven to be one of the best defensemen in NHL history and made several records lists. Colorado took him fourth overall in the 2017 draft but he remained at the University of Massachusetts and earned the Hobey Baker Award before joining the Avalanche during the 2019 Stanley Cup Playoffs. He scored his first-ever NHL goal in his first-ever NHL game and won the Calder Trophy. After winning the Cup in 2022, he was awarded the Conn Smythe and Norris Trophy and has been a finalist for the NHL&#039;s top defenseman award every season since entering the league. As one of the most underrated players in the NHL, Rantanen has improved every season since the Avalanche drafted him 10th overall in 2015. The 27-year-old Finn earned 104 points last season and 105 the previous season for a career-high, and has played a major role in the team&#039;s success on the top line with MacKinnon. The Avalanche&#039;s poster franchise player and now president of hockey operations, Joe Sakic, has been in the front office through all four top draft players still active with the team. Rantanen&#039;s contract is up after next season but the other three are committed to long-term deals to stay in Colorado for a while.
