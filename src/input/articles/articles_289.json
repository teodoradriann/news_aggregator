    "text": "AL RAYYAN, Qatar - Iraq claimed their first victory over Japan in 42 years when they won their Asian Cup Group D encounter 2-1 on Friday to qualify for the knockout stage thanks to a first-half double from Aymen Hussein at the Education City Stadium.\nJapan were unbeaten against the West Asian side in their last nine games and Iraq's victory propelled them to the top of the group standings with six points from two games.\nHajime Moriyasu's side have three points, the same as Indonesia who beat Vietnam 1-0 in the other Group D game.\n\"Today is a great day for Iraqi people but for us it's just a win. We have six points, but the players must now think of Vietnam (in the last group game) and they need to rest,\" Iraq coach Jesus Casas told reporters.\n\"I'm very proud of my players. All Iraqi players should be proud... The perfect match is impossible, but we were close to the perfect match I wanted.\"\nRoared on by thousands of Iraqi supporters in the stadium, Iraq got on the board inside five minutes when Japan goalkeeper Zion Suzuki failed to deal with a cross, parrying the ball straight to Hussein who headed it into the top corner.\nIraq's strategy to unsettle Japan was to stay compact and use their physicality early on, which worked to an extent until the East Asian side began using their pace and finding space on the wings to put crosses into the box.\nJapan had a golden opportunity to equalise in the 22nd minute from a set piece when a header fell to Wataru Endo at the edge of the six-yard box, but the skipper was unable to direct an overhead kick into the net.\nIraq doubled their lead on the stroke of halftime when Ahmed Al-Hajjaj skipped past his marker and floated in a cross that was headed home from point-blank range by Hussein.\nPENALTY DENIED\nBut Hussein went down injured just before the break and was replaced for the second half and though Iraqi fans were dejected when their hero did not take the field, they found their voice again when Japan were denied a penalty despite a VAR check.\nMoriyasu made five substitutions after the restart but the Samurai Blue rarely tested the keeper until the 94th minute when Endo headed home at the far post from a corner.\nThe atmosphere was tense in the dying minutes as Japan frantically sought an equaliser but Iraq held on for the three points to move top.\n\"We prepared the same way as we did for Vietnam but unfortunately we found ourselves in a difficult position, especially early on. The crowd and atmosphere made us feel like we were playing an away game,\" Moriyasu said.\n\"The second goal hit us hard, we must learn from our mistakes. The players fought hard and I must accept responsibility for the loss.\n\"We analysed before the game and knew how Iraq would play at the start, they did play very aggressive. Unfortunately we couldn't handle it, I know we need to do more.\"\nIndonesia moved up to third after Asnawi Mangkualam scored from the spot in the 42nd minute after they won a penalty when defender Nguyen Thanh Binh pulled Rafael Struick's shirt and hauled him down in the box.\nMangkualam stepped up and sent the keeper the wrong way to score. Vietnam also had Le Pham Thanh Long sent off for a second yellow card in the 91st minute.\n(Reporting by Rohith Nair in Doha; Editing by Ken Ferris and Toby Davis)",

    "text": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton (D-North Shore/South Brooklyn) worked with other elected officials to get the JCC’s new Early Childhood Center open after the center faced yet another potential delay. “As a parent of two young children, I understand firsthand how crucial access to childcare is,” said Scarcella-Spanton. “It was important to me that we resolved the issue as soon as possible. The JCC’s Early Childhood Center is an essential resource for local families, and I am proud to have worked in ensuring it opens as soon as possible.” The center —which can be found at Temple Israel — was initially supposed to open on the first day of school. A halt of the center’s opening came from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, according to a written statement, “leaving 70 North Shore families scrambling for alternate plans.” When alerted about the issue, the senator and Councilwoman Kamillah Hanks (D-North Shore) worked with the necessary city departments and agencies to get the center up and running before another two-week delay, including the Department of Health, the FDNY, and the Office of Children and Family Services. “This success highlights the power of collaboration between city and state officials. By working closely with the FDNY and the NYC Department of Health, my office was able to fast-track the approvals needed to ensure the JCC’s Early Childhood Center could open in a timely manner. It took coordinated efforts across multiple agencies to overcome the hurdles that could have delayed the opening by weeks. The teamwork between my office, and local elected officials made it possible for us to cut through the red tape, expedite background checks, and secure the necessary approvals, all within a tight timeframe. This was truly a team effort, and I’m proud of what we accomplished together for the families in our community,” Kamillah Hanks said. JCC CEO Orit Lender said, “I am incredibly grateful for the support of our local elected officials who worked hard behind the scenes to make this happen. We received support from the governor and mayor’s offices, Senator Scarcella-Spanton, Assembly Member Pirozzolo, Borough President Fossella, and Council Member Hanks in pushing the city and state to allow us to open. Our partner organization UJA-Federation of NY was also a huge help in moving the process along. Without all of their support, we would not have been able to open this week. It was incredible to see the smiling faces of the children and parents as they entered their new school for the first time.”",

Por cierto, una soberanía que China solo ha ejercido unos 5 años en el último siglo.\nPor no hablar de que Taiwán es líder indiscutible de la tecnología más estratégica que existe ahora mismo.\nBiden es un pacifista y un ciudadano de bien. Un individuo con muchísimos años en la política americana que siempre ha sabido plegarse a los deseos de las grandes empresas y magnates que obstentan el poder a los que sirve fiel y dócilmente, así mantiene al Estado profundo y los grandes medios a su favor.

La monarquía australiana es una monarquía constitucional, inspirada en el sistema de gobierno parlamentario de Westminster, aunque incorpora características propias de la Constitución de Australia.\nEl monarca actual es Carlos III, con el título de rey de Australia,[1] cuyo reinado comenzó el 8 de septiembre de 2022, tras el fallecimiento de la reina Isabel II. Es representado en el conjunto de Australia por el gobernador general, de acuerdo con la Constitución australiana[2] y las cartas patentes del rey,[3][4][5] y en cada uno de los estados australianos, según las constituciones estatales, por un gobernador, asistido por un vicegobernador.\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarqu%C3%ADa_en_Australia\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_brit%C3%A1nica\n[#47](c47#c-47) Seguro que seguirán cuestionándola, como hicieron, por ejemplo, en Irlanda o la India, que han terminado siendo repúblicas porque había consenso en ambos países de que es lo que querían ser.

Y lo han aceptado. Si mañana Australia decide convertirse en una república, la reacción del Reino Unido será encogerse de hombros.\nChina \"perdió\" Taiwan también hace décadas. Pero, como su gobierno es una dictadura carente de legitimidad, hay que distraer a los pipis de ese hecho. Y han recurrido a un clásico: el nacionalismo.\n[#50](c50#c-50) El imperio Británico abandonósalio por patas desde el siglo XVIII sus colonias norteamericas desde 1786 y mantuvieron el pataleo en Región Administrativa Especial de Hong Kong de la República Popular China hasta 1997 .\nDiferencias notables\nHong Kong y Taiwán eran chinas por historia, vecindad geográfica geograficod de mientras Inglaterra sus vecinos geográficos son los Europeos y el resto es el negocio colonial de la compañía de las Indias y sus productos a expoliar.\nY china no perdió Taiwan.

Y la mayoría de los taiwaneses no quieren ni oír hablar de formar parte de China. En parte, por lo que ha ocurrido en Hong Kong en los últimos años.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Political_repression_in_Hong_Kong\n[#52](c52#c-52) Me imagino que los aborígenes australianos ,los indios norteamericanos .....\ntampoco quieren saber nada de los ingleses y llevan más de 70 años.\nComo argumento para tu gran conocimiento se qué un poco corto.\nLas leyes internacionales son para cumplirlas aunque el Sáhara lleva esperando décadas y los chinos También.\nY la discusión no era sobre Australia era solo un ejemplo de las varas de medir de tu mundo colonial blanco que defiendes y los problemas que le ponen a China para recuperar parte de su territorio.\nY como ya te informe Carlos III es rey de Austria que eso fue el comienzo del tema que ignorabas, recuerdas.\nEspaña también puede dejar de ser una monarquía ,pero es una monarquía.\nTitular bastante amarillista, la verdad:\n\"Biden: Not ruling out using US military force.

    "text": "Two Queensland women who drowned in a stormwater drain following wild weather conditions have been identified as 46-year-old Tanya Hehir and 40-year-old Helen Bradford. The women were exploring a 2.4km drain called the \"love tunnel\" in Gympie with a friend when they were swept away by floodwaters. Their companion, a 46-year-old woman made it to safety and contacted police. Emergency services were called to the Kidd Bridge around 3.20pm. A search and rescue operation commenced involving water police, general duties officers, swift water rescue crews and the SES. Police first recovered Helen Bradford's body at 7:10pm on Boxing Day and Tanya Hehir's body on December 27. Tanya Hehir was a keen runner and a member of the Gympie Hash House Harriers. Gympie Regional Council mayor Glen Hartwig told the ABC that he would consider new safety measures in light of the tragedy. \"It's an old stormwater system that's been there since the foundation of Gympie,\" he said. \"It's not a place to be played with. It's not a place where you want to go and explore.\" Acting superintendent Paul Algie said in recent times that weather events were developing quickly and advised the public to be careful near water. \"There is always the chance tragedy can strike,\" he said.

    "text": "Que el litio se ha convertido en un problema para nuestra sociedad hace mucho que dejó de ser noticia. Por su escasez, contaminación y varapalo económico, la búsqueda de alternativas para alimentar de energía a nuestros móviles, portátiles, vehículos, y otra ingente cantidad de cacharros de la que a menudo no somos conscientes, se ha convertido en una necesidad imperante. [Avances en el mundo de la energía](https://www.3djuegos.com/3djuegos-trivia/noticias/japon-ha-descubierto-que-clave-para-mejorar-energia-baterias-estaba-aumenta-nuestra-buen-chute-cafeina) como el de esta nueva batería, en cambio, pintan un futuro mucho más esperanzador. Tal y como recogía Grayson Deysher de la Universidad de San Diego en los comentarios del paper publicado en [Nature Energy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-024-01569-9), \"aunque ha habido baterías de sodio, de estado sólido y sin ánodo anteriormente, nadie ha podido combinar con éxito estas tres ideas hasta ahora\".

Una prometedora alternativa a las baterías y pilas de litio Al fin y al cabo lo que ha conseguido el equipo de la profesora Shirley Meng, junto a los [científicos de la Universidad de Chicago](https://pme.uchicago.edu/news/uchicago-prof-shirley-mengs-laboratory-energy-storage-and-conversion-creates-worlds-first) y la Universidad de California, es abrirnos las puertas a una nueva batería de estado sólido de sodio sin ánodo capaz de ofrecer alta capacidad y carga rápida sin tener que lidiar con las cada vez más preocupante escasez del litio. Y eso por no hablar del precio. De la mano de una innovadora arquitectura, tal y como recoge Deysher, el avance supone que las baterías de estado sólido de sodio puedan verse como una alternativa. \"Esperamos que este artículo pueda estimular más avances en el campo del sodio al demostrar que puede funcionar bien, incluso mejor que la versión de litio en algunos casos\". La gran baza, en cualquier caso, está en la posibilidad de crecer en [número de baterías](https://www.3djuegos.com/3djuegos-trivia/noticias/que-pilas-baterias-tienen-tantas-formas-disenos-distintos) creadas y energía almacenada para responder a la demanda cada vez más creciente de nuestra sociedad. Y si además lo hacemos dependiendo menos de los combustibles fósiles, pues mejor que mejor.

    "title": "Nikki Haley believes viral Civil War question was a set up: 'Definitely a Democrat plant' | Blaze Media",
    "text": "JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images © 2023 Blaze Media LLC. All rights reserved. Nikki Haley believes viral Civil War question was a set up: 'Definitely a Democrat plant' December 28, 2023 Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley alleged Thursday that the audience member [who asked her about the Civil War](https://www.theblaze.com/news/nikki-haley-cause-civil-war) at a town hall was a \"Democrat plant.\" At a town hall in New Hampshire on Wednesday, an audience member asked Haley what caused the Civil War. The cause, Haley responded, \"was basically how government was going to run the freedoms of what people could and couldn’t do.\" She then spoke about liberty, individual rights, and government — a response for which the audience member was apparently prepared. \"In the year 2023, it's astonishing to me that you answered that question without mentioning the word 'slavery,'\" the audience member told Haley. \"What do you want me to say about slavery?\" she responded. \"You answered my question, thank you,\" the man replied. In a Thursday interview with a New Hampshire radio show, Haley responded to the bipartisan whiplash over her answer and acknowledged the obvious. \"Of course, the Civil War was about slavery,\" she said, going on to clarify why she spoke about individual rights and the role of government. \"Yes, I know it was about slavery. I'm from the South.\" The former South Carolina governor then alleged the audience member was planted by President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party to make her look bad. \"Biden and the Democrats keep sending Democrat plants to do things like this, to get the media to react. We know when they're there. We know what they're doing,\" she said. According to Haley, the Democratic Party machine is targeting her because they believe she will handily defeat Biden in a general election and therefore want to sink her campaign to ensure that Donald Trump wins the Republican nomination. Haley, moreover, claimed she recognized the audience member as a \"plant,\" which is why she tried to turn the question around on him. \"It was definitely a Democrat plant,\" she [said](https://nhjournal.com/haley-civil-war-question-was-democrat-plant/). \"That's why I said, 'What does it mean to you?' And if you notice, he didn’t answer anything. The same reason he didn't tell the reporters what his name was. The same reason he went and showed the guy that he was with the tweet that went up after he did it. \"We see these guys when they come [to our events]. We know what they're doing, and we know from the second they ask the question. If you look at the last swing I did in New Hampshire, there was one at every single town hall. This is what they do. And I'm trying to turn the questions back on them,\" she said. Haley, however, did not offer any evidence to back her claims. According [to the New Hampshire Journal](https://nhjournal.com/haley-civil-war-question-was-democrat-plant/), the audience member later told reporters that he asked the question because he knew that Haley was asked the same question more than a decade ago and wanted to see how she would answer today.
