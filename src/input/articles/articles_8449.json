    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. — Avery Johnson threw for two touchdowns and ran for one, DJ Giddens rushed for 151 yards and scored twice, and Kansas State beat No. 19 North Carolina State 28-19 in the Pop-Tarts Bowl on Thursday night.Johnson, a freshman making his first start after Will Howard entered the transfer portal, threw for 178 yards, rushed for 71 and directed a 15-play, 72-yard touchdown drive in the fourth quarter that put the game away and closed out a solid season for coach Chris Klieman’s Wildcats (9-4).Quarterback Brennan Armstrong rushed for 121 yards and a touchdown and threw for 164 yards in his final game for the Wolfpack (9-4), who fell short of winning 10 games for the second time in program history.Giddens had a 37-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter, his only catch of the game, and ran for a 4-yard TD early in the second that made it 14-0.Kansas State led 21-7 late in the second quarter and 21-10 at halftime, but N.C. State rallied in the third quarter, thanks in part to some trickery. Trent Pennix ran for a 60-yard touchdown on a fake punt with 1:50 left in the period. But the 2-point try failed, allowing the Wildcats to maintain a 21-19 lead.Johnson and Giddens took over from there. Giddens had six rushes for 25 yards on a drive that took 7:24 off the clock and concluded with Johnson’s 8-yard touchdown pass to Jayce Brown with 2:48 remaining.Jacob Parrish intercepted Armstrong on N.C. State’s next play from scrimmage.Both teams ran successful fake punts.Kansas State punter Jack Blumer called his own number in the second quarter for a 30-yard gain that set up Giddens’ rushing TD.N.C. State had its biggest play on a direct snap to Pennix, a tight end, from the punt formation that he took all the way to the end zone.N.C. State’s lone 10-win season came in 2002, when it went 11-2 with Phillip Rivers at quarterback.N.C. State will have to replace Armstrong, a fifth-year senior who transferred from Virginia for his final season, and graduating Atlantic Coast Conference Defensive Player of the Year Payton Wilson.Kansas State can look forward to having both Johnson and Giddens back in 2024.",

    "text": "> BRIGHTON, Dec 29 — Tottenham Hotspur’s over-stretched squad unravelled in a 4-2 defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion yesterday with manager Ange Postecoglou admitting his team lacked their usual energy.\nThe Londoners, who have maintained their top-four push despite a host of key players missing through injury and suspension, went 4-0 down on the south coast before a late rally meant they salvaged some pride.\nSpurs have been without England playmaker James Maddison and Dutch central defender Micky van de Ven since a 4-1 home defeat by Chelsea at the start of November while Argentine centre back Cristian Romero is also facing a lengthy lay-off.\nMidfielder Yves Bissouma was suspended for the trip to Brighton while Dejan Kulusevski will miss Sunday’s home game against Bournemouth after picking up a yellow card yesterday.\nAdvertisement “I know I say I don’t make excuses but that doesn’t dismiss the enormous efforts of the players, not just today but through this whole period,” Postecoglou, whose side are fifth in the Premier League with 36 points from 19 games, told reporters.\n“They give everything they have, even today. Everything they had in them physically they gave to this game even though sometimes we weren’t as sharp as we have been.\n“It’s difficult. It’s been difficult this whole run. We’ve been stretched for a very long time and we’ve just tried to play through it. That’s what we’ve done and we’re only in the position we are because of the enormous efforts of the players to do jobs that normally is not in their brief.”\nAdvertisement Late goals by substitute Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies was proof of Tottenham’s fighting spirit but with players heading off to the African Cup of Nations and Asian Cup in January, Postecoglou knows he needs to bolster his squad.\n“We’ve got 10 players injured. The way we play, the players give everything every game. They’re a credit to us,” he said.\n“It’s very demanding the way we play physically and today we kind of looked like a team that wasn’t at its sharpest,” the Australian added. “Ultimately what I do know is the players gave everything they have and that’s all I can ask for.”\nCaptain Son Heung-min said the performance was nowhere near the levels Tottenham need to be at.\n“Every team is strong in the Premier League and if we’re not playing like the last 15 minutes in every game we’re going to struggle and this has to be a big wake-up call,” he said. — Reuters",

The initiative was coordinated by the National Forestry Association, forestry specialists helped with the plantings with the active participation of local communities. 443 settlements participated in the program, 136 of them joined for the first time, they explained. They wrote that the Newborn Forest Program was launched in 2020 with the cooperation of the Ministry of Agriculture, within the framework of which, according to the commitment made in the Climate and Nature Protection Action Plan, ten or at least one million trees per year will be planted for every child born in Hungary until 2030. State forestry companies have planted a total of 300 hectares of forest annually until 2022 within the framework of the Newborn Forest Program. This year, the program continued on an additional 150 hectares. During the program, only native, mixed forests are planted, so the increase in forest areas is ensured by forest stands with high biodiversity and natural value, they added. In addition, the state forestry companies treated the population’s need for firewood as a priority in 2023, and the goods were available in sufficient quantity and of good quality. In addition, the government provided HUF 5 billion for the Social Fuel Program until mid-February 2024, which provides assistance to needy families living in settlements with less than 5,000 people through the local governments, the AM wrote.",

However, in the last couple of years, there has been exploration into the prospect of AI in the healthcare industry. AI has the potential to act as a triage system in early disease detection. Additionally, it possesses the prowess to aid in the prognosis and diagnosis of diseases. The need to be kept abreast of AI and its application on health cannot be downplayed. Education on AI for kids in primary schools in the United States has already been put into action. Likewise, whether you’re working in the US healthcare system, enrolled in an [online nurse practitioner program in Texas](https://onlinenursing.twu.edu/programs/online-ms-fnp), or want to learn more about medical technology, this article is your guide to understanding AI’s role in disease detection, especially the early detection of diabetes-related diseases. AI & diabetes-related complications Diabetes is a chronic disease that is attributed to high levels of blood sugar (glucose). It is a result of the body’s inability to produce or use insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas to regulate the blood sugar level in the body. Diabetes can be a deadly disease that is either of type 1 or type 2. With the onset of diabetes, comes a myriad of complications including diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy, coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Research has shown that the [information from the blood vessels in the retina](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7397518/) is a great asset to the early detection of diabetes and its related complications. In the last decade, the image analysis capability of AI has been proven to aid in the detection of the onset of type 1 and type 2 diabetes together with its related microvascular and macrovascular complications. Diabetic retinopathy Diabetic retinopathy is a condition that causes vision loss and even blindness in people who have diabetes when the blood vessels in the tissue at the back of the eye become damaged. Diabetic retinopathy [affects 1 in 3 people with diabetes](https://www.aao.org/education/topic-detail/diabetic-retinopathy-europe), particularly when high blood sugar is not managed effectively. Several clinics in Singapore have implemented AI in the detection of diabetic retinopathy. Known as Selena+, this AI system looks for symptoms such as bleeding, swelling and microaneurysms and can [analyse and produce results of an eye test](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/diabetes-singapore-deploys-ai-technology-to-screen-patients-for-early-signs-of-diabe) in just minutes (instead of an hour like an ophthalmologist). Diabetic neuropathy Diabetic neuropathy is a kind of nerve damage where your hands and lower limbs are numb to pain predominantly caused by diabetes. In the [United States](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31197183/), the financial burden that diabetic neuropathy accrues amounts to more than $10 billion yearly. AI is playing a pivotal role in understanding the risk factors involved in the development of diabetic neuropathy. Particularly, AI has evolved to be incorporated into [ smart wearable devices](https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/tech/2019/06/05/6-wearable-devices-manage-diabetes/1275579001/) that manage blood sugar levels; this, however, enabled diabetic patients to stay informed about their health data and consequently know when complications like diabetic neuropathy might be developing. Diabetic nephropathy Diabetic nephropathy is chronic kidney failure that stems from either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The fatality rates due to diabetic nephropathy are tremendous and it accounts for the most common complication of diabetes. Research has shown that it [develops in about 40% of diabetic patients](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28522654/), after a 10-year diagnosis period. AI models such as recurrent neural networks (RNN), regression-based methods, decision trees, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM, and extreme gradient boosting have been used in diagnosing early signs of kidney failure from diabetes. The performance metrics obtained from these models are all above [ 80%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163364/) which significantly pushes the frontiers of early diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) CAD is a diabetic complication that affects the heart, its structure, and its function. In the United States, CAD is the leading cause of death. Nearly [20.5 million](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/coronary-heart-disease) U.S. adults have CAD which makes it the most common type of heart disease in America. AI–based techniques have been incorporated into an electrocardiography (ECG), demographic characteristics, symptoms, physical examination findings, and heart rate signals to aid in the detection of early signs of diabetic heart failure. This has yielded numerous preventative measures such as changes in diet and frequent physical activity in adults diagnosed with CAD by AI. Stroke Diabetes causes stroke, a condition in which blood flow to the brain is blocked or there is abrupt bleeding in the brain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported [795,000 people in the United States have a stroke every year](https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm). AI can assist in the early detection of stroke by analyzing a patient’s medical history, risk factors, and vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG readings. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) PAD is one of the macrovascular complications of diabetes marked by the blockage of arteries in the lower extremities, leading to symptoms like intermittent claudication and pain, particularly during physical activity. By 2030, [forecasts](https://www.hmpgloballearningnetwork.com/site/vdm/current-us-prevalence-peripheral-arterial-disease#:~:text=PAD%20Prevalence%20by%20Age%20and%20Glucose%20Status&text=Between%201995%20and%202020%2C%20U.S.,65%20and%20older%20have%20PAD.) show that the number of diabetic patients with PAD will reach 23.8 million in the U.S. AI has shown great proficiency in the [detection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8285054/) of PAD and predicting diabetic patient outcomes. Conclusions AI is playing an essential role in the early detection of diseases such as diabetes and its myriad complications. Interestingly, researchers are aiming to employ the prowess of AI in detecting all diseases known to man. While it is evident that AI is playing a pivotal role in disease detection, it still carries the risk bias. Globally, there are teams dedicated to eradicating the risk that AI possesses in the early detection of disease. It will interest you to know that AI has increased the work efficiency of many physicians. Governments worldwide have been beneficiaries of AI, as it greatly helps to cut the financial burden that disease causes. In a nutshell, AI will add value to the livelihood of patients, physicians, and nations. All and sundry must endeavor to embrace AI for its transformative power.

    "text": "BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (WISH) — The Monroe County water treatment plant was approved for upgrades. March 10, the Utilities Service Board approved the upgrades as part of Mayor Kerry Thomson’s 2024 Transition Report. Wessler Engineering worked with the City of Bloomington to design the upgrades scope, schedule, and costs. The plant will get an upgraded treatment feed system for disinfection chemicals and fluoride , will add a backwash pump for reliability, and will replace the lighting with LEDs to be more energy efficient. “A city’s infrastructure is only as strong as its commitment to maintaining and improving it. The upgrades to the Monroe Water Treatment Plant are not only about repairs—they are about future-proofing Bloomington’s water system,” Thomson said. “Water is the foundation of public health, and ensuring its safety and reliability is one of our most important responsibilities as a city.” $5 million was awarded for the upgrades, which is expected to be complete by fall of 2026.",

    "text": "Updated: Dec. 26, 2024, 5:10 p.m. | Published: Dec. 26, 2024, 5:10 p.m.\nDetroit Lions right tackle Penei Sewell, left, and quarterback Jared Goff lead the team out of the tunnel before the game between the Detroit Lions and the Green Bay Packers on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024 at Ford Field. The Detroit Lions defeated the Green Bay Packers 34-31. (Jake May | MLive.com)\nBy Benjamin Raven | braven@mlive.com ALLEN PARK -- It’s hard to compete with new cars, expensive toys and fancy jewelry this time of the year.\nBut Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff did his best to show his appreciation for his offensive line. Goff said he got his big guys in the trenches a YETI cooler care package and a ton of beef for the holidays.\n“It’s hard when you got guys giving out Toyota trucks to try and keep up with that,” Goff told reporters on Thursday. “But I got them a nice YETI package with a ton of Wagyu -- steaks and beef. I hope they like it.”\nGoff’s mention of Toyota trucks comes on the heels of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy gifting his offensive linemen a new fleet of vehicles . In other gift news, Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts and running back Saquon Barkley joined forces to get their offensive line golf carts as a show of thanks.\nLast year, Goff got his offensive linemen $11,000 watches -- Breitling Super Chronomat watches -- while teaming up with Jared (the jeweler). Those also came with an inscription on the box that read:\n“Every second of this year was timeless. Thank you for a historic season and bringing gridiron glory back to Detroit. Enjoy this gift by Jared. From your Jared.”\nRelated: Lions insist veteran QB addition isn’t indicative of Hendon Hooker’s growth\nRelated: Lions’ focus on tuning out noise fuels streak of avoiding back-to-back losses\nKevin Zeitler said he was waiting to get his hands on that care package. But the Wisconsin native and veteran offensive lineman responded with a “Sign me up,” when asked about his present.\nDetroit’s offensive line remains the foundation of this team. They have taken some hits once again with injuries this year. But the starting five of Taylor Decker, Zeitler, Frank Ragnow, Graham Glasgow and Penei Sewell remains as good as it gets.\nThe Lions average 4.6 yards per rush attempt, ranking 10th in the NFL. Goff has been sacked 27 times on 472 passing attempts on the year, which ranks in the bottom half of the league among regular starting quarterbacks.\nPro Football Focus ranks Detroit’s offensive line 15th in pass protection and third overall on the ground. And from another perspective, ESPN analytics is higher on Detroit’s pass blocking, ranking them 10th in pass-block win rate.\nThe Lions also have some key standouts, with Sewell ranking fourth among offensive tackles, and Ragnow ranking third among centers, per PFF.\n“Yeah, I mean, they’re so dang tough, first of all, and the resiliency and that whole thing,” Goff recently said of the line. “But, obviously, they’re so talented and I’m lucky to be behind them. I don’t take it for granted.\n“You look around the league, a lot of guys are taking a lot of hits. I don’t have to be one of those guys, so it’s a fortunate thing to be in and I’ve got to them their credit.”\nBETTING: Check out our guide to the best Michigan sportsbooks , where our team of sports betting experts has reviewed the experience, payout speed, parlay options and quality of odds for multiple sportsbooks.

    "text": "NEW YORK -- The northern lights captivated countless people across the Tri-State Area this week, but Mother Nature isn't finished showing off yet.\nIf you're lucky, experts say you might be able to spot a comet that hasn't been seen from Earth in 80,000 years in the Tri-State Area this month .\nHow to see the comet In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, you'll need a clear view facing west in order to see the comet with the naked eye.\n\"You really want to wait for the sun to set, but not long after,\" said Bart Fried, membership chairman of the Amateur Astronomers Association.\nYour best chance at the possibly once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will come 30 minutes after sunset if you look right above where the sun sets, according to Fried.\nMany people in the Tri-State Area were able to get a glimpse of the comet Saturday night.\nDepending on cloud cover, you may be able to see the comet again over the next two weeks , but with each passing day, it will get higher in the sky and become dimmer, making it more difficult to view.\nThe CCNY Planetarium created a simulation to show the comet's position .\n\"The formal name is C-2023A3,\" said Dr. James Hedberg, the planetarium's director. \"It's thought to have originated in the ort cloud, which is this distant collection of rocks and ice, way, way far away.\"\n\"The Neanderthals were the first people to see it,\" Fried said. \"Centuries ago, they were portraits of doom. Today, kind of just the opposite.\"\nWhy are comets so rare? There's no guarantee the comet will ever make its way back close enough to Earth to see again, according to Hedberg.\n\"It's these rare moments that change your lives,\" he said. \"This thing has spent tens of thousands of years getting here.\"\n\"When there's a good comet, you can't take your eyes off it,\" Fried said.\nJackie Faherty, senior research scientist at the American Museum of Natural History, explains why seeing a comet like this is so rare.\n\"Because our solar system is pretty cleared out,\" Faherty said. \"You just don't know if you're ever going to see one because they have to have the right conditions to get the right amount of sunlight and be the right distance away from us.\"\nThe comet is nothing to be worried about, experts say, since it's so far away from Earth. So enjoy the show in the sky!\nAlecia Reid contributed to this report.\nMore from CBS News NY-1 among races that could decide balance of power in Washington 4-year-old Harlem boy's death raises questions about child services Is NJ Transit on track to make improvements?
