    "text": "HHS to lay off 10,000 employees and cut overall workforce by 20,000\nSome components will be hit harder than others as the department says it is still eyeing ways to further \"streamline its operations and agencies.\"\nThe Health and Human Services Department will slash its workforce by 20,000 employees, Secretary Robert Kennedy announced on Thursday, leading the agency to shrink by nearly 25%.\nThe department has leaned on incentives such as early retirements and deferred resignations to reach half of that total. It will now force cuts of another 10,000 workers, which a spokesman confirmed would take place through reductions in force, or layoffs.\nThe reductions will be part of a comprehensive reorganization of the department. The cuts will save $2 billion annually, Kennedy said, and the department will go from 28 divisions throughout the department down to 15. Department-wide functions such as human resources, IT, procurement, external affairs and policy will be centralized into the Administration for Healthy America and regional offices will be slashed in half to just five. HHS\npreviously cut its general counsel's regional offices from 10 to four.\nKennedy noted he is instituting the cuts as part of President Trump’s executive order for all agencies to work with the Department of Government Efficiency to develop plans to slash their workforces through RIFs. Government Executive previously reported the National Institutes of Health, a component of HHS, faced a directive from the Elon Musk-backed DOGE to\ncut its workforce down to fiscal 2019 levels.\n“As part of President Trump's DOGE workforce reduction initiative, we're going to streamline HHS, make our agency more efficient and more effective,” Kennedy said. “We're going to imbue the agency with a clear sense of mission to radically improve the health of Americans and to improve agency morale.”\nEmployees at HHS received no warning prior to the department’s announcement, according to several who spoke to Government Executive, and largely did not receive any follow up information after it went out. At least one NIH component, the Office of Extramural Research, scheduled meetings for Thursday afternoon to go over RIF plans and inform employees who would be let go.\nThe department did not appear to consult human resources leadership at the component level before making the announcement. One such official said there was “no involvement and no verification of the areas and impact.” A front-line employee said there was “zero communication about anything.”\n“We’re all just on edge waiting for specifics,” the employee said.\nThe Food and Drug Administration is set to shed 3,500 full-time employees under the plan, according to an internal fact sheet obtained by Government Executive, cutting about 18% of the agency’s workforce. Drug, medical device and food reviewers, as well inspectors, will be spared from the cuts.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will cut about 2,400 employees, according to the fact sheet, amounting to a reduction of 19%. It will gain employees from the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which handles natural disaster and public health emergency response and will fold into CDC. That change will reinforce CDC's \"core mission to protect Americans from health threats,” HHS said.\nThe HHS fact sheet noted CDC would only gain 1,000 employees from ASPR, which currently employs around 5,000 individuals. It is unclear if all of the remaining staff will be subject to RIFs or be reassigned elsewhere.\nNIH will cut 1,200 employees, which HHS said will occur by centralizing HR, procurement and communications across the agency’s various institutes and centers. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is anticipating cutting 300 employees by focusing on “minor duplication” at the agency. HHS maintained that delivery of Medicare and Medicaid would not be impacted by the reductions.\nThe department suggested it was not currently planning additional cuts after it reduces its workforce by 20,000 employees, but it would \"continue to look for further ways to streamline its operations and agencies.” Kennedy noted that HHS would “do more with less,” though he conceded “this will be a painful period” for the department.\nIn addition to the more back-end functions, the new Administration for Health America will fold into its structure the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. It will divide up the functions of the Administration for Community Living, which provides oversight of those serving older and disabled Americans, into CMS, the Administration for Children and Families and the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.\nASPE itself will be combined with the Agency for Health Research and Quality into the Office of Strategy.\n“I want every HHS employee to wake up every morning asking themselves, “What can I do to restore American Health?’” Kennedy said. “I want to empower everyone in the HHS family to have a sense of purpose and pride and a sense of personal agency and responsibility to this larger goal.”\nTrump has called on all federal agencies to\nimplement widespread RIFs, though some are hoping to avoid them by using incentives and attrition to downsize their workforces. HHS previously offered buyouts and early retirement incentives to its workforce. Several agencies have already begun laying off employees en masse, though most large agencies have not yet done so on a significant scale. HHS joins the Education Department and General Services Administration in instituting widespread layoffs.",

    "text": "El jefe del buró político de Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, comunicó este lunes a Egipto y a Catar que el grupo islamista ha aceptado su propuesta para [ un alto el fuego en la Franja de Gaza.](https://www.radioformula.com.mx/mundo/2023/10/7/que-es-hamas-el-grupo-militar-palestino-al-que-israel-le-declaro-la-guerra-784805.html) Hamas hizo el anuncio en un breve comunicado en el que no ofreció más detalles, después de que el Ejército israelí ordenara a unos 100 mil palestinos en el este de Rafah evacuar la localidad ante un posible asalto terrestre. \"Ismail Haniyeh, líder del buró político del movimiento Hamas, realizó una llamada con el primer ministro catarí, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, y con el ministro de Inteligencia egipcio, Abás Kamel, y les informó de la aprobación por parte del movimiento Hamás de su propuesta sobre un acuerdo de alto el fuego\", dijo el grupo palestino. De momento no se conocen los detalles de la propuesta, ni la postura de las autoridades israelíes. Parecía que las negociaciones indirectas entre Hamas e Israel para lograr un alto el fuego en la Franja de Gaza estaban estancadas, después de que el primer ministro israelí, Benjamín Netanyahu, rechazara ayer poner fin a la guerra, demanda clave del grupo islamista. Esta mañana, de hecho, miles de palestinos en la localidad sureña de Rafah recibieron mensajes instándolos a evacuar a la zona de Jan Yunis, haciendo saltar las alarmas ante la posibilidad de que el Ejército comience pronto con su anunciada invasión terrestre en el sur de Gaza. El grupo islamista advirtió hoy a las fuerzas israelíes que cualquier operación militar en Rafah \"no será un picnic\", y que el brazo armado del grupo, las Brigadas al Qasam, están preparadas para \"defender a nuestro pueblo\". Hamas pidió además a los organismos internacionales que todavía operan en el enclave, y en particular a la agencia de la ONU para los refugiados palestinos (UNRWA), que no lo abandonen tras las órdenes de evacuación israelíes.",

Lines last updated Friday at 8:22 p.m. ET. All games ET unless noted. Texans RB Devin Singletary UNDER 66.5 rushing yards (-110) - Host Browns, Saturday, 4:30 p.m. (NBC) After a strong beginning when he became a starter, Singletary's numbers have dropped off primarily due to a lack a opportunities. He has topped this number just twice in his last 7 games. The reason for his lack of elite rushing days is that he has had 13 carries or fewer in 5 of the last 7 games, including just 9 carries against the Browns in Week 16. In order to top this number, he may need more than 15 carries and that may not be possible against a tough Browns defense that will make Houston earn everything it gets. Bills QB Josh Allen SCORES A TOUCHDOWN (-105) - Host Steelers, Sunday, 1 p.m. (CBS) Allen has scored 15 rushing TDs in his last 15 games, including 8 in his last 6 games. With a considerable amount of snow expected, when the Bills get near the goal line, Allen will likely call his own number to close out drives. He does when the weather is fine. He's likely to do it more often when the footing is bad and he knows where he's going while defenders try to react. Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco OVER 66.5 rushing yards (-115) - Host Dolphins, Saturday, 8:10 p.m. (Peacock) One thing that is true about cold weather games is that the passing game is impacted much more negatively than the run game. No matter how sideline personnel try to keep the balls warm, when it's near zero degrees with 25 mph winds, the balls become like bricks in less than a minute. Pacheco has been the most consistent part of the Chiefs offense in their playoff run and has rushed 15 or more times in 5 of his 6 six games. In his last home game, he has rushed 18 times for 130 yards. With his speed and strength, if Pacheco gets 15 carries, which is very likely, it will be extremely difficult for the depleted Dolphins defense to keep him below this number. Lions RB Jahmyr Gibbs UNDER 52.5 rushing yards (-120) - Host Rams, Sunday, 8:15 p.m. (NBC) This one is a tough number not to surpass given the Lions elite offensive line, but there are a couple of factors that are going to make this number a little too high to pass barring a 20-yard carry along the way. The first is that veteran RB David Montgomery is the conventional runner coach Dan Campbell counts on to close out games and set the tone offensively. With the Lions making a rare playoff appearance, it is much more likely that Campbell will lean on Montgomery as the primary back and Gibbs as a change-of-pace/receiving back. The other issue is that the Rams are likely to come out throwing and try to turn the game into a shootout. If that happens, Gibbs may get his share of yardage as a receiver, but he likely won't get the carries he will need to top a number he hasn't beat in his last 2 games. Cowboys WR CeeDee Lamb OVER 98.5 receiving yards (-115) - Host Packers, Sunday, 4:30 p.m. (FOX) If the Cowboys are ever going to excise their playoff demons, it is going to require QB Dak Prescott to play some of the best ball of his career. To do that, it will require a heavy dose of Lamb. The Cowboys were chasing down the Eagles all season and have been playing playoff-style football for the last month and they have counted on Lamb to be the centerpiece of the offense. In his last 3 games, Lamb has caught 32 passes and posted yardage days of 118, 227 and 98. He has made his case of being the most dominant receiver in the league and will be targeted early often against a young Packers defense that will likely be unable to hold him down.

    "text": "Cómo avanzará la exploración espacial en 2024\n2024 será un año apasionante para la exploración espacial, con misiones que nos acercarán de nuevo a la llegada de astronautas a la Luna.\n2023 fue un año excepcional para la exploración espacial. Se batió el récord de personas en el espacio al mismo tiempo, hubo nuevos vuelos de turismo espacial y se lanzó el telescopio espacial Euclid.\n2024 será igual de emocionante, pero ¿qué nos espera?\nArtemis 2 enviará astronautas en un sobrevuelo lunar\nLa NASA tiene previsto lanzar Artemis 2 en noviembre de 2024, para enviar a cuatro astronautas a la órbita de la Luna en un sobrevuelo lunar de diez días.\nSerá la última misión de prueba antes de que Artemis 3 envíe astronautas a la Luna en 2025, por primera vez desde la misión Apolo 17, de 1972.\n“Juntos, estamos dando paso a una nueva era de exploración para una nueva generación de navegantes estelares y soñadores: la generación Artemis”, declaró el 3 de abril de 2023 el Administrador de la NASA, Bill Nelson, durante un acto cerca del Centro Espacial Johnson de la NASA en Houston (Texas).\nArtemis 2 forma parte del programa multipartito de exploración lunar Artemis, dirigido por la NASA y en el que participan otras seis grandes agencias espaciales, entre ellas la Agencia Espacial Europea (ESA).\nMás robots aterrizarán en la Luna\nLa NASA enviará varios módulos de aterrizaje a la Luna en 2024 como parte de las iniciativas CLSP (Commercial Lunar Payload Services). Los transbordadores enviarán equipos robóticos al polo sur de la Luna para recoger importantes datos científicos.\nEntre ellos se encuentran VIPER, un explorador de muestras de suelo, PRIME-1, que realizará análisis químicos de muestras de hielo, y Blue Ghost Mission 1, que investigará el flujo de calor del interior lunar.\nEn mayo, China también tiene previsto enviar a la superficie de la luna Chang’e 6, una misión robótica de exploración lunar.\nEl rover recogerá las primeras muestras lunares de la cara oculta de la Luna. Pakistán, Francia, Italia y Suecia irán a cuestas en la misión con sus instrumentos, incluido el orbitador lunar pakistaní llamado ICECUBE-Q.\nVisita a otras lunas del sistema solar\nJapón planea lanzar en 2024 la misión Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) a Fobos, la mayor luna de Marte. La misión prevé el aterrizaje de un robot y la obtención de las primeras muestras de la luna. La muestra contendrá sólo unos 20 gramos de “regolito”, o roca y polvo sueltos de la superficie lunar, que podrían ser de gran valor para los científicos.\nLa NASA también tiene previsto lanzar en octubre la misión Europa Clipper, que orbitará alrededor de Júpiter y realizará una serie de sobrevuelos de Europa, la luna del planeta. Realizará 44 sobrevuelos cercanos a la luna y espera identificar posibles lugares para futuros aterrizajes en Europa. Europa Clipper también recogerá datos sobre la capa de hielo de esa luna y sus posibles océanos, los compuestos químicos necesarios para la vida y las características geológicas de su superficie.\nAterrizaje en asteroides\nSe planea el lanzamiento de Hera, de la ESA, hacia sus lugares de aterrizaje en dos asteroides llamados Didymos y Dimorphos en octubre de 2024. Ambos asteroides tienen menos de 1 km de diámetro.\nLa misión Hera es la continuación de la prueba DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) de la NASA, que impactó contra Dimorphos y modificó su órbita en 2022.\nHera realizará una evaluación de seguimiento del asteroide con fines de defensa planetaria. Recopilará datos sobre la masa y la cinética de Dimorphos para comprender cómo DART modificó la órbita del asteroide. Su llegada al sistema Didymos está prevista para diciembre de 2026.\nLucy, de la NASA, también se dirigirá a sistemas de asteroides, esta vez ocho asteroides en órbita alrededor de Júpiter conocidos como asteroides troyanos. Lucy espera reunir datos sobre la formación de nuestro Sistema Solar.\nLos vuelos espaciales comerciales a órbita baja cobrarán impulso\nEn 2024 se lanzarán aviones espaciales, vehículos capaces de volar en órbita baja y aterrizar en la Tierra en pistas convencionales.\nSierra Space lanzará Dream Chaser, un avión espacial reutilizable que despega sobre un cohete. Está diseñado para transportar de tres a siete tripulantes y puede reabastecer a la Estación Espacial Internacional.\nPara ayudar a poner en órbita los aviones espaciales, en 2024 se realizará el vuelo inaugural de un nuevo tipo de vehículo de lanzamiento llamado New Glenn. El New Glenn está diseñado para ser un vehículo de lanzamiento reutilizable que pueda enviar al espacio aviones espaciales comerciales, incluidos vuelos de turismo espacial.\n(gg/ers)",
