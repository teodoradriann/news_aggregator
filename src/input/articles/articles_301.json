    "text": "\"Uccidiamo Vannacci\" è la\nminaccia scritta da ignoti con pennarello sul vetro della sede\ndel Coordinamento Vallo di Diano di Fratelli d'Italia a Sala\nConsilina, in provincia di Salerno. A darne notizia Francesco\nBellomo, coordinatore di Fdi per il comprensorio valdianese.\n\"Accuse, offese e vilipendi di ogni genere - spiega in una nota Bellomo - sono all'ordine del giorno per i pasdaran della libertà, schiavi del perbenismo militante che osteggia chiunque sia contrario al pensiero unico. Saranno questi i motivi che hanno spinto ignoti ad imbrattare, con minacce di morte contro il generale Vannacci, le vetrine del coordinamento Vallo di Diano di Fratelli d'Italia a Sala Consilina\". La frase minacciosa \"Uccidiamo Vannacci\", scoperta questo pomeriggio dallo stesso rappresentante valdianese di Fdi, è diretta al generale Roberto Vannacci, autore del libro 'Il mondo al contrario'.\n\"Dove sono ora - si chiede Bellomo - i difensori della libertà di espressione costituzionalmente garantita? È forse Vannacci meno difendibile di quanto possa essere chi lotta per le unioni omosessuali? Ai posteri l'ardua sentenza\".\nRiproduzione riservata © Copyright ANSA",

TCS last month said clients delayed decisions and projects.\n\"We are pleased to announce compensation revision for all eligible associates in grades up to C3A (assistant consultant) and equivalent, covering 80% of workforce,\" according to the mail to employees from chief human resource officer Milind Lakkad and CHRO designate Sudeep K on Wednesday.\nEmployees, ranging from trainees with a few months of experience, to assistant consultants who have worked for more than a decade, will be eligible for the wage revision.\nHowever, the mail did not share any details about the revisions for senior-level staff that form the rest 20% of the workforce.\n\"We can confirm that we will be issuing wage hikes to around 80% of our employees effective 1st September 2025,\" the Tata Group company said in an email to Reuters, but did not give other details.\nThe April annual hikes were delayed after the Mumbai-based company cited uncertain business environment.

(Photo courtesy of Quinton Yates) When Anissa Christian crosses the stage to accept her Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree on Monday, she will be crossing the threshold to a new career built on a desire to serve and confidence in the power of education.\nChristian, 55, worked as an elementary school teacher for 27 years, first in South Carolina and then in Memphis after she moved here with her family in 1994. She holds a bachelor’s degree and master’s degree in education. After leaving the classroom, Christian said she knew she wanted to continue to serve others. “I have learned to appreciate nursing as another way of helping those in need,” she said. “It has geared my passion toward serving at another level.”\nChristian is one of 60 students from the College of Nursing who will receive their degrees at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center’s commencement ceremony on Monday, December 9, at 10 a.m. at the Cannon Center for the Performing Arts. A total of 116 students are graduating, including 28 from the College of Medicine, 17 from the College of Graduate Health Sciences, and 11 from the College of Health Professions.\nAt commencement, Christian will be recognized as the BSN Class Award winner. The award is presented to a member of the graduating class chosen by classmates as an outstanding role model with qualities including empathy, respect for others, motivation, and enthusiasm.\nCollege of Nursing Dean Wendy Likes, PhD, DNSc, APRN-BC, FAAN, FAANP, presented Christian with the BSN Class Award at the college’s pre-commencement awards program. As a lifetime educator, Christian appreciates the importance of good teaching and praised the instruction she received at UT Health Science Center. “The knowledgeable instructors who are passionate about their work have been the driving force to my success throughout the program,” she said.\nShe plans to continue her nursing education at UT Health Science Center in the Doctor of Nursing Practice program while working as a bedside nurse in a local intensive care unit.
