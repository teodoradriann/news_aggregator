    "text": "Teddi Mellencamp is celebrating “exciting news” amid her battle with cancer.\n“Honestly, the crying is already done, but I just finished with all of my scans and my tumors have significantly shrunk, which doctors believe means that this all will work and that I will be back to myself and feeling good,” Mellencamp, 43, said in a Wednesday, April 23, Instagram video.\nMellencamp explained that she has two more sessions of immunotherapy and then will “hopefully” be done and cancer-free.\n“I’m going to keep a positive outlook because that’s the way my doctor just spoke to me. He’s like, ‘You did this, you got this,’” she said, before imitating: “‘You got that Mellencamp blood, so you’re good.’”\n“One update I couldn’t wait to share!” Mellencamp captioned her post. “All tumors stage 4 (metastasized melanoma in my brain and lungs) shrunk or disappeared so I have 6ish more weeks of immunotherapy and doctors believe I will be healed if everything stays on course. Thank you to everyone who has sent their love, prayers, and positivity ❤️❤️❤️.”\nMellencamp’s pals quickly weighed in on the news in the comments section of her post. “BEST DAY EVER So grateful😭❤️,” Kyle Richards wrote, while Tamra Judge added, “I can’t stop crying tears of joy … I love you 😘.”\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum, who shared in February that “multiple tumors” had been found on her brain, has been candid about her cancer battle. While revealing exclusively to Us Weekly in March that doctors found four more tumors on her brain, Mellencamp shared that she’s “fighting for my life,” adding, “But also for my family’s life and all the people I love.”\nMellencamp, who shared that one of her coping mechanisms is sarcasm, noted that she stays positive by planning things to look forward to.\nRelated: Teddi Mellencamp Has 4 More Brain Tumors: Inside Her Cancer Battle During her three seasons on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, we saw Teddi Mellencamp in her fair share of arguments and confrontations. But nothing could prepare her for the monumental battle she’s facing now. “I’m fighting for my life,” she tells Us Weekly, “But also for my family’s life and all the people I […] “A lot of people — not doctors, strangers on the internet — said [I] shouldn’t be riding, but it’s one of the things I love doing with my daughter. And I’m really lucky that Edwin [Arroyave] , who I was in the middle of a divorce from, we put everything on hold. [It] wasn’t really the time to be fighting over emails. He’s been extremely kind and helping with the kids . That’s made things a lot easier.”\nMellencamp, who shares daughter Slate, 12, son Cruz, 10, and daughter Dove, 5, with estranged husband Arroyave, added that she’s excited to go “back to normal” after treatment. (Arroyave is also dad to daughter Isabella, 16, from a previous relationship. He and Mellencamp announced their separation in 2024.)\n“I want to try new things, travel more with the kids, keep building a life and doing the best that we can, and have fun together,” she told Us . “That’s my goal.”",

    "text": "In a recent display of durability, a Tesla Cybertruck effortlessly navigated through flooded regions of the Southeast U.S. amid relentless storms that caused widespread havoc. This performance highlights Tesla's advanced engineering and marks a significant testament to the vehicle's robustness in extreme weather. Storm Havoc: Tesla Cybertruck Defies Flood Warnings as Southeast Faces Weather Onslaught Massive storms hit the Northeast last week, with several inches of rain, tornadoes, and even an earthquake reported as a storm cell moved across the country, per [Teslarati](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-braves-substantial-rainfall-and-standing-water-amid-massive-storms/?fbclid=IwAR2uQF5h2Lxlfm2mC_LiostIGqYFl2tk96f0QAAc2Pbmw87u-AgCi5n8e4g_aem_AWRAYb_FRK5a4xpYMvhCdF_AxivwB3KzKw5m_FHiAaakkoVgbgt3dnWedMiv9YKTMd0owvpmSItkIZ9UPy9MC-Sx). The Southeast United States is currently clutching a formidable storm cell, unleashing massive amounts of rainfall in various states. The storm cell has begun its journey out of the country and across the Atlantic Ocean, but not before leaving several inches in major metropolitan areas yesterday, April 10. New Orleans, Louisiana, was among the cities that felt the brunt of the storm. According to [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2024/04/10/storm-heavy-rain-possible-tornadoes-southeaster-united-states/73268061007/), more than 118,000 homes and businesses across Texas and Georgia were without power on Wednesday night. At least one person in Mississippi died. The storm also caused significant flooding in many areas, with some regions receiving up to eight inches of rain. New Orleans received five to eight inches of rain throughout the storm, and wind gusts up to 80 mph were also reported. While officials in New Orleans warned people about flooding and advised them to stay off the roads to avoid danger, a Tesla Cybertruck missed the memo. Tesla Cybertruck Excels in Water Trials, Highlighting Advanced Waterproof Capabilities Initially, Tesla had big plans for the Cybertruck. CEO Elon Musk stated that it could cross bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and seas because the company wanted to equip the pickup with waterproof capabilities in certain conditions. This unique feature sets the Cybertruck apart from other vehicles, as it can continue operating even when other cars would be rendered immobile. Musk wanted the vehicle to travel from Starbase to South Padre Island in Texas, a 6.5-mile distance. As a testament to Tesla's innovative approach, the Cybertruck was equipped with Wade Mode, a feature designed to protect the battery pack by pressurizing it. This unique feature, particularly useful in heavy rain and storm conditions, also increases the vehicle's ride height, allowing it to traverse flooded areas without issue. According to a source, the Cybertruck made its way through some bodies of water while driving along the ocean's shoreline and also completed a somewhat tricky task in a [deep-water](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-deep-water-test-video/) test. This test involved submerging the vehicle in a controlled environment to assess its ability to withstand extreme water conditions, and the Cybertruck passed with flying colors.",

    "text": "L’Université Mohammed VI Polytechnique (UM6P) a inauguré, jeudi 27 février, son implantation à « Station F », le plus grand campus de startups au monde, basé à Paris.\nCet événement a également marqué le lancement de « NextAfrica », le programme d’accélération porté par l’UM6P à « Station F », où l’université disposera d’un espace dédié de plus de 40 postes de travail.\nPremier programme transcontinental d’accélération Europe-Afrique dédié aux secteurs de la Greentech, de l’Agritech et de la Healthtech, « NextAfrica » propose une approche hybride combinant immersion à « Station F » et accès aux infrastructures de l’UM6P au Maroc pour développer, tester et structurer leurs innovations.\n« L’idée de ce programme est d’accompagner une sélection de startups choisies sur des thématiques pertinentes pour les activités de l’UM6P, pour le développement du Maroc et de l’Afrique, dans les domaines de la santé et de l’agriculture notamment, sous un angle très innovant et de pointe autour de l’intelligence artificielle et de la data », a indiqué dans une déclaration à la MAP Fahd Benkirane, directeur général de l’UM6P France.\nIl a précisé que « NextAfrica » reflète « notre ambition de créer un écosystème où startups africaines et européennes collaborent, innovent et grandissent ensemble ».\n« Grâce à notre présence à Station F et à l’ancrage de l’UM6P en Afrique, nous offrons aux entrepreneurs un cadre unique pour accélérer leur développement et relever les défis technologiques et sociétaux de demain », a poursuivi M. Benkirane.\nLe DG de l’UM6P France a, en outre, souligné l’importance de cette journée d’inauguration – placée sous le thème « Innover ensemble : un pont entre l’Europe et l’Afrique pour transformer le futur »- pour l’UM6P et pour la coopération maroco-française et afro-européenne, qui passe par les talents et les entrepreneurs reliant les deux rives.\n« Avec un focus sur le climat et la santé, NextAfrica va offrir une expérience unique aux startups avec des ressources d’exception et un réseau international », a indiqué, via une vidéo projetée lors de l’événement, la directrice de « Station F », Roxanne Varza.\nAccueillant avec « enthousiasme » l’UM6P au sein de « Station F », Mme Varza a déclaré : »Ensemble, nous renforçons le lien entre l’Europe et l’Afrique ».\nLamia Hanafi, responsable Innovation et Entrepreneuriat à l’UM6P France et fondatrice de « NextAfrica », a, quant à elle, indiqué que ce programme reliant l’UM6P et la Station F vise à créer des ponts d’innovation entre écosystèmes complémentaires pour accélérer la croissance des startups africaines et européennes grâce à des réseaux solides tournés vers le futur.\nIl s’agit aussi de mettre en lumière les diasporas africaines et tout acteur international intéressé par le marché africain, en tant que catalyseur de nouvelles initiatives et de passerelles entre l’Europe et l’Afrique, a-t-elle souligné.\nPendant six mois, les startups sélectionnées dans le cadre de ce programme bénéficieront d’un environnement entrepreneurial de pointe à « Station F », tout en ayant accès aux infrastructures technologiques avancées de l’UM6P via « StartGate », son campus dédié aux startups. Elles seront également accompagnées par un réseau de mentors africains et européens, ainsi que par des mises en relation stratégiques avec des investisseurs et des partenaires industriels.\nDans cette dynamique, « UM6P Ventures », fonds d’investissement de l’l’Université, établira également sa présence à « Station F », facilitant ainsi l’accès au financement pour les startups et créant des synergies entre les écosystèmes de capital-risque européens et africains.\n« En alternant entre Station F et StartGate, les startups profiteront d’une double immersion : ouverture sur l’Europe et ancrage dans un hub d’innovation africain », a précisé Yassine Laghzioui, directeur de l’Entrepreneuriat et Venturing UM6P et CEO « UM6P Ventures ».\nCette initiative traduit la vision de l’UM6P dont l’objectif est de connecter talents, infrastructures et capitaux pour faire émerger les prochaines scale-ups technologiques africaines, a-t-il relevé.\nPour lui, « l’objectif dépasse l’accompagnement : il s’agit de créer les conditions pour valider leur technologie, accélérer leur mise sur le marché et lever les fonds nécessaires afin de scaler et atteindre des milestones clés en développement et en traction ».\nL’événement a également été l’occasion de présenter la première cohorte « NextAfrica », composée de douze startups prometteuses issues des deux continents. Celles-ci se répartissent en deux verticales : HealthTech, représentée par les startups Pelican Health, SenseBiotek, VG2D Pharma, Inn’Pulse, NeuralTeks, BlocReg Solutions, iAvicenne et Rosetta Omics ; et AgriTech, représentée par Sand to Green, ISTYA, AgroSfer et IrWise.",

    "text": "Gas station employees, first responders save man’s life after falling off of bridge\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - Employees at an East Louisville gas station helped save a man’s life after he fell 15 to 20 feet off a bridge and into a creek.\nThe incident happened behind a Speedway located at 11301 Westport Road near Fincastle.\nA worker noticed the man had fallen and called 911. That’s when employee Aaron Biddix was called over to help.\n“I just called out can you give me your name? Can you give me anything? No response,” Biddix said. “His chest was rising for a second and then he started having a little bit of a death rattle and it slowly stopped rising.”\nBiddix had CPR training after previously working as a lifeguard. He recognized the man was losing his pulse and started right away on chest compressions.\n“I hopped down there, about a five, six-foot drop,” Biddix said. “I tried to get him over to another part of the creek with a more stable base so I could do compressions, but by that time he didn’t have a pulse so I figured I might as well just go in and start.”\nWhen first responders with Anchorage Middletown Fire & EMS arrived at the scene, the man had already regained his pulse.\nSamantha Kimbler was one of the paramedics on scene. She described how crews had to call in a rescue company to lift the man out of the creek. The area was heavily wooded, making it hard to pull him to safety.\n“We have a special rescue company that specializes in specific types of patient recues,” Kimbler said. “They were dispatched to assist us, and they used chainsaws to cut a path.”\nAfter clearing a space, the company used a special stretcher called a Stokes basket to lift the man.\n“You set that spine board down in there, it has multiple handles on it,” Kimbler said. “It secures the patient and makes it easier to carry them through wilderness, vegetation, anything like that.”\nParamedics made sure the man was stable as he was transported to UofL Hospital. Kimbler says these are the kind of challenging rescues their department trains to be prepared for.\n“I’m really proud of our team,” Kimbler said. “I’m proud of our department. We work really well together. We train for unknown scenarios and this is why.”\nBiddix said he’s glad to know his quick thinking under pressure could’ve saved the man’s life.\n“It’s just not panicking when the situation calls for it,” Biddix said. “So that’s what I did. I think I just helped a person in need.”\nCopyright 2025 WAVE. All rights reserved.",
