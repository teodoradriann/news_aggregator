It was later determined that he had succumbed to complications caused by the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, likely contracted through contact with an infected wild bird.\n“Avian flu continues to affect a range of wild and domesticated animal populations, including residents at zoos across the country, so the recent event at BPZOO is, regrettably, far from unique,” zoo officials wrote Wednesday.\nZoo officials said there is “no risk” to the public. They added that the zoo’s other two seals, Conway and Luna, were separated from Blue as soon as symptoms appeared, and both remain in good health.\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Modern file manager with a keen focus on usability, offering users a number of tools to more handily manage the files on their system.\n#File Manager #Folder Management #Explorer Replacement #File #Manager #Folder\nSoftpedia Review\nspecifications\nchangelog\nFree Download\nbuy now Robert Condorache\nThose looking to manage their files and folders more efficiently often choose to look to third-party software to handle such duties, even though the built-in File Explorer already does a serviceable job. The reasons to look for alternatives are understandable, as they mainly boil down to affording more power-user options to users, with a focus on efficiency.\nIt is thus clear why someone would choose to go down that path. A utility purposely geared to facilitate file management is obviously a proposition hard to pass for someone looking to go more in-depth, and that's what HiFile seeks out to do: provide a modern file manager, with enough functions to satisfy a more discerning user base.\nAiming to improve upon what File Explorer offers, the software comes with a modern design, where reachability is the name of the game. Accessing the program's functions and navigating through its interface feels quite natural, so you'll be able to freely start managing your files in a more focused manner.\nIf you've used other third-party file management solutions in the past, it won't take long for you to attune to this one. Even if you aren't really familiar with software of this kind, there's nothing to worry about.\nYou can start by heading to the directories you want to work on, and begin managing them however you like. The dual-panel layout makes it possible to work on two directories at once, and they can be as related or unrelated as you want.\nThe Search function is quite a robust one. You can specify the general location of a file you want to find, add filters to your search, as well as specify a size and modification date to narrow everything down.\nComparing two directories is likewise possible, and it works as you would expect. This can be especially useful when you're cross-checking directories that contain stills, as images will be previewed for you to see. From the same menu, users can synchronize one directory's data with another.\nSimilarly, if you're looking to cut down on storage, you may first want to take a look at duplicate data. The program can find that data for you, and help you retrieve some valuable storage space.\nThose on the lookout for a competent file manager will be able to find one in HiFile, which also makes for a surprisingly accessible solution.\nHiFile 0.9.9.11add to watchlist add to download basket send us an update REPORT\n- runs on:\n-\nWindows 11\nWindows 10 64 bit\n- file size:\n- 15.1 MB\n- main category:\nFile managers\n- developer:\n-\nvisit homepage Microsoft Teams Bitdefender Antivirus Free IrfanView Zoom Client calibre paint.net Windows Sandbox Launcher ShareX 7-Zip 4k Video Downloader\n- ShareX\n- 7-Zip\n- 4k Video Downloader\n- Microsoft Teams\n- Bitdefender Antivirus Free\n- IrfanView\n- Zoom Client\n- calibre\n- paint.net\n- Windows Sandbox Launcher",

The arrested person was identified as Jagdish Pandher. Durham Regional Police Service said in a statement on Thursday (December 28, 2023), \"Although these offences occurred at places of worship, they do not appear to be hate crimes or motivated by hate.\" Police said on October 8 its personnel responded to reports of a break-and-enter in progress at a Hindu temple in the area of Bayly Street and Krosno Boulevard in Pickering. \"A male was seen on security surveillance breaking into the temple and taking a large quantity of cash from the donation boxes,\" police said. \"The male fled the area prior to police arrival. The male was seen on surveillance footage later that morning committing additional break-and-enters at Hindu temples in Pickering and Ajax,\" read the statement. Investigators have linked the same suspect to numerous other break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year.

    "text": "Teddi Mellencamp shares hopeful update on cancer after revealing her ‘50/50’ odds of survival\nMellencamp received her melanoma diagnosis in 2022\nTeddi Mellencamp has given fans a new optimistic update on her cancer.\nThe former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star first received her melanoma diagnosis in 2022, which advanced to stage four in February and metastasized to her lungs and brain. She underwent major brain surgery in February that removed four tumors, more than doctors expected to find, Mellencamp revealed. Other hard-to-reach tumors couldn’t be removed.\nMellencamp turned to Instagram on Wednesday to share that all of her tumors have shrunken. “I have 6ish more weeks of immunotherapy, and doctors believe I will be healed if everything stays on course,” she wrote in the caption.\nCurrently, she has only two more immunotherapy sessions left before “hopefully I am done and I will be cancer-free.” Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses the body’s immune system to fight the cancer.\n“I'm going to keep a positive outlook because that's the way my doctor just spoke to me. He's like, ‘You did this, you got this,’” said the former reality television star.\nThe news comes a week after she opened up about why she hasn’t asked her doctors about her chances of survival during an interview with Nightline. “I learned this isn’t the best question to ask if you’re doing immunotherapy because immunotherapy has only been around 10 years,” she said.\nMellencamp, however, has been given updates about how likely she is to live amid her cancer treatment.\n“One of my favorite things to ask is, ‘How long I got? What are my chances?” she continued. “And they oftentimes say, 50/50. [I’m like] ‘50/50! I wouldn’t buy a car that’s only gonna drive 50 percent chance of the time. I don’t want this.’”\nShe said her doctor clarified: “No, it’s only because that’s how long immunotherapy has been around, so that’s how long the study has worked.”\nEarlier in the interview, the reality star shared how the immunotherapy has taken a toll on her body.\n“I would say the hardest thing for me is I’ve always been a super active person, and, like, I cannot do the things I was used to doing,” she explained, before later noting that she could barely walk one mile when she’s “used to running seven miles” a day.\nShe also shared another reason why her cancer has been challenging, confessing: “I really like to have control, and this is completely out of my control. And for the first time, I’m really scared.”\nLast month, Mellencamp told her Instagram followers that yet more tumors were found in her body after doctors removed more tumors than they originally expected during her surgery.\n“Update from my scans today,” Mellencamp captioned an Instagram post with a photo of herself. “I have multiple tumors in my brain that weren’t able to be removed via surgery. I also have two tumors in my lung. These are all metastases of my melanoma.”\nShe has also opened up about how she talks to her young children about her cancer. Teddi and her estranged husband, Edwin Arroyave, share Slate, 12; Cruz, 10; and Dove, 5.\n“I’m fighting for my life,” she said during an interview with Us Weekly. “But also for my family’s life and all the people I love.”\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments",

    "text": "LaMelo Ball rises into The Ringer's top 25 player rankings\nLaMelo Ball has been playing good basketball this year. It hasn't helped the Charlotte Hornets, who've been until recently dealing with a laundry list of injuries, get a lot of wins, but Ball is averaging over 29 points, seven assists, and five rebounds. His play forced The Ringer to move him up in their top 100 ranking.\nLaMelo Ball jumps again in The Ringer ranking\nAt the end of last year, which was a mostly injured season for LaMelo Ball, the Hornets guard was ranked 59th by The Ringer out of all NBA players. Just before the 2024-25 season began, he moved to 53. In a little over a month, he jumped all the way to 27. He stayed there until today when he finally cracked the top 25.\nDanny Chau wrote for Ball's entry, \"LaMelo has been one of the most compelling modern portraits of NBA stardom we’ve seen in a while, in ways good and bad, but certainly chaotic. He is the hop-skipping embodiment of ignorance is bliss: Players aren’t supposed to be able to carry such heavy usage so lightly. Players aren’t supposed to be able to shoot 3s at the volume he does with impunity. To put his absurd shot diet into perspective: Ball is attempting more 3s per game than players like Evan Mobley, Jimmy Butler, and Derrick White are attempting overall field goals per game. The Hornets remain an absolute mess, but there’s something mesmerizing about watching the team frame Ball’s nightly Jackson Pollocks.\"\nBall continues to showcase why he's one of one in the NBA, and the overall NBA world is taking notice. No one does what he does, for better or worse, and that makes a nine-win team much more watchable than they'd otherwise be. The Ringer also called him one of the most \"wildly imaginative\" guards in the history of the sport.\nAt 23, Ball is one of six players his age or younger ranked in the top 25. He's still fairly young despite having four years under his belt, and he could continue to rise even further in the semi-often-updated rankings from the media company.\n- MORE STORIES FROM HORNETS ON SI -\nGrade the trade: Charlotte Hornets send Nick Richards to Phoenix for Josh Okogie and future draft capital\nThe Hornets take down the Jazz behind dazzling performance from the 'core four'\nMark Williams on how the Core Four turned in a winning outing: 'We did great'\nCharlotte Hornets climb one spot in ESPN's latest NBA Power Rankings",

    "title": "Governor Hochul Signs Legislation To Increase Access To State Parks And Support Tourism",
    "text": "Governor Kathy Hochul today signed legislation to increase access to State Parks, recreational facilities and historic sites, and to support the tourism industry in New York. S.5423/A.4853 will increase access to New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation sites by prohibiting the mandated use of credit cards as a means of payment for use of its facilities. Governor Hochul also signed S.9250/A.10333 to extend the authorization for certain operators of leased personal watercrafts to be exempt from the boating safety certificate, which will support the tourism businesses that lease these vehicles to those vacationing at New York’s waterfronts. Today's bill signing builds on Governor Hochul’s “Get Offline, Get Outside” summer campaign to promote physical and mental health by encouraging New York’s kids and families to put down their phones and computers, take a break from social media and enjoy recreation and outdoor social gatherings.\n“Our State Parks are an important driver behind our state’s economy, and my administration is committed to ensuring everyone has access to our breathtaking sites and to boosting the tourism industry,” Governor Hochul said. “These acts of legislation will make sure that New Yorkers and our visitors can see and experience all that New York has to offer.”\nMany New Yorkers, including seniors, unbanked or underbanked individuals, minors, and others use only cash. While credit cards offer convenience, not everyone has access to them. Legislation S.5423/A.4853 removes this potential barrier, ensuring equal access to New York's State parks, historical sites, and recreational facilities we all cherish. By still accepting cash at these state facilities, New York will continue supporting the inclusive enjoyment of our state's treasures.\nState Senator Monica R. Martinez said, “Our parks and historic sites are often the heart of community celebrations and a collective interest in our state's beautiful landscapes, wildlife and history. As sponsor of this bill, I believe it is a commonsense measure to ensure all residents, particularly those that predominantly utilize cash, are afforded equitable access. No one should be denied the opportunity to enjoy these prized sites based on their method of payment.”\nState Senator Dean Murray said, “New York is truly one of the most diverse and beautiful places in the world with so much to see and so much to do, which is why we have such a robust tourism industry. Anything that limits access to our amazing state parks is a move in the wrong direction. This is why I was proud to co-sponsor Senate bill S.5423, which prohibits mandating the use of credit cards for payment at state parks. I thank Governor Hochul and the sponsor, for moving this bill forward and signing it into law.”\nState Senator Mario R. Mattera said, “Every New York resident and visitor should have the ability to use state recreation facilities freely regardless of how they are paying. Any mandates to the contrary are unfair to those who either choose not to or are unable to use credit cards and this law will ensure that there are no barriers for our anyone. That will ensure equal access for everyone.”\nState Assembly Deputy Speaker Phil Ramos said, “I am proud to continue to find ways to break down the digital divide to ensure everyone has equal access to the many opportunities New York has to offer. Removing limitations like credit card mandates in New York State Parks will provide multiple options for all New Yorkers, ensuring that more families can enjoy our incredible destinations without barriers. I thank the governor for her continued partnership in ensuring we find more ways to support our vital tourism industry.”\nLegislation S.9250/A.10333 extends the exemption for certain operators of personal watercraft from the boating safety requirement. Extending this exemption prevents detrimental impacts to the tourism industry who lease these vehicles to those vacationing in relevant waterfront areas in New York.\nState Senator Jose M. Serrano said, “New York is home to beautiful lakes, beaches, and ocean fronts that attract tourism from all over the country. This tourism provides jobs and is a vital economic driver for local communities. I am happy to support local tourism with this important legislation and thank Governor Hochul for her continuing support of tourism across the state.”\nAssemblymember Billy Jones said, “Allowing people to rent personal watercrafts is not only important for the businesses that lease them, but for tourism as well as. By extending this legislation, more people will be able to enjoy the outdoors with their family and friends while taking advantage of New York’s beautiful landscape. This is certainly welcome news for everyone as we near the holiday weekend, which is known for great times out on the water.”",

    "title": "Pegasus used recently to target phones of 2 journalists: Amnesty, Post | India News - The Indian Express",
    "text": "A FORENSIC investigation by Amnesty International’s Security Lab in partnership with The Washington Post has claimed that two Indian journalists were among those “recently targeted with Pegasus spyware on their iPhones”. [Pegasus](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/recalling-pegasus-oppn-leaders-targeted-9007516/) is an invasive spyware developed by Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group. The NSO Group has always maintained it deals only with governments and that too after intense scrutiny. Calling the publication’s findings “half facts, fully embellished”, Union Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar wrote on X (formerly Twitter), “…it is for [Apple](https://indianexpress.com/about/apple/) to explain if their devices are vulnerable and what triggered these notifications… Apple was asked to join the enquiry with @IndianCERT and meetings have been held and enquiry is ongoing.” The two journalists who Amnesty International claimed were targeted with [Pegasus](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pegasus-whatsapp-spyware-israel-india-7410890/) are Siddharth Varadarajan, Founding Editor of The Wire, and Anand Mangnale, South Asia Editor, Organised Crime and Corruption Report Project (OCCRP). The two had, along with several politicians from Opposition parties, received a threat notification from Apple In October. Following this, the two had provided their devices to Amnesty International for testing. In October, Opposition leaders across parties — from Congress’s [Shashi Tharoor](https://indianexpress.com/about/shashi-tharoor/) to [Aam Aadmi Party](https://indianexpress.com/about/aam-aadmi-party/)’s Raghav Chadha and Trinamool’s [Mahua Moitra](https://indianexpress.com/article/who-is/who-is-mahua-moitra-5803133/) — received a “ [threat notification” from Apple](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/virus-apple-threat-notification-official-says-9039800/) warning of a “potential state-sponsored spyware attack” on their iPhones. They had then hit out at the Centre, and suggested it was behind the spyware attack attempt. The government had, however, denied it. It had also initiated a probe headed by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) – to ascertain the trigger behind the threat notifications. Describing the attack on Mangnale’s phone, Amnesty International, said, “The Security Lab recovered evidence from Anand Mangnale’s device of a zero-click exploit which was sent to his phone over iMessage on 23 August 2023, and designed to covertly install the Pegasus spyware. The phone was running [iOS](https://indianexpress.com/about/ios/) 16.6, the latest version available at the time.” The attempt to infiltrate Varadarajan’s phone and install Pegasus, took place on October 16, but failed, Amnesty said. “The same attacker-controlled email address used in the Pegasus attack against Anand Mangnale was also identified on Siddharth Varadarajan’s phone, confirming that both journalists were targeted by the same Pegasus customer,” it said. Indications of renewed Pegasus spyware threats towards individuals in India were first observed during a regular technical monitoring exercise in June 2023, said Amnesty International in a blog post. Amnesty International did not respond to queries seeking details on whether it had tested phones of other people from India apart from the two journalists, and the findings from those phones. Amnesty International has previously claimed that Varadarajan was targeted and infected with Pegasus spyware in 2018. His devices were also forensically analysed by a technical committee established by the Supreme Court of India in 2021 in the wake of allegations of the spyware being used on a host of stakeholders including politicians, journalists and human rights activists. On its part, the Central government has not categorically denied buying or using Pegasus, which the NSO Group says it sells only to government or government agencies. In October 2021, the Supreme Court had set up a three-member technical committee and ordered a probe headed by former SC judge R V Raveendran to look into the allegations of unauthorised surveillance using Pegasus. The panel found no conclusive evidence on use of the spyware in phones examined by it but noted that the Central Government “has not cooperated” with the panel. The committee had submitted its reports in sealed covers, and after the court took them on record, the reports were re-sealed and kept in safe custody. At the time of publication, the reports had not been made public, more than a year after they were first presented to the apex court. As part of CERT-In’s fresh investigation following the October 2023 threat alerts, a team from Apple USA visited India last month to assist with the probe. [The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com) had earlier reported that the government’s nodal cybersecurity agency is exploring if agencies linked to the Chinese government were behind the attempted breach.",

    "text": "El sistema permite almacenar energía en los momentos de mayor producción del parque y despacharla en la noche cuando disminuye la producción en los parques fotovoltaicos o cuando el sistema lo requiera.\nHasta el parque eólico Punta Sierra se dirigió el seremi de Energía, Eduardo Lara, para conocer el funcionamiento de este proyecto de generación eléctrica ubicado en la comuna de Ovalle, que está próximo a complementar su operación con un sistema de almacenamiento de energía en baterías, uno de los primeros en la Región de Coquimbo.\nEl Sistema de Almacenamiento de Energía en Batería (BESS por su sigla en inglés) de la empresa Pacific Hydro utilizará acumuladores de litio de 3 MW/6 MWh, siendo la primera experiencia piloto de este tipo de la empresa en Chile conectada al Sistema Eléctrico Nacional.\nEl seremi Lara agradeció a la firma controlada por State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) “por conocer la instalación y funcionamiento del parque, las virtudes que tiene la generación de energías limpias y constatar uno de los primeros proyectos BESS que va a permitir ser mucho más eficientes en la producción, siendo el almacenamiento un tema muy relevante para el Gobierno del Presidente Gabriel Boric y el país”.\n“El sistema permite almacenar energía en los momentos de mayor producción del parque y despacharla en la noche cuando disminuye la producción en los parques fotovoltaicos o cuando el sistema lo requiera. De esta manera, este proyecto hace un importante aporte a la sustentabilidad energética, permitiendo dar un paso más hacia la descarbonización de nuestro sistema de producción y almacenamiento de energía eléctrica”.\nCarlos Rosario, jefe del Parque Eólico Punta Sierra de Pacific Hydro, destacó que “Punta Sierra y su subestación representan un hito clave en la integración de energías limpias al Sistema Eléctrico Nacional. Cuenta con un excelente factor de planta y se socializó de manera temprana con las comunidades, alineándose de manera pionera a las guías de estándares de participación del ministerio de Energía. Este proyecto es, además, uno de los primeros en incorporar sistemas de almacenamiento con baterías conectados al sistema, reafirma nuestro compromiso con la transición energética del país, aportando una solución concreta para avanzar hacia una matriz más sustentable y robusta para Chile”.\nActualmente la empresa está a la espera de la autorización para las pruebas de conexión y proyectar el inicio de la operación comercial para fines del presente año.\nEl sistema BESS es parte de las instalaciones del parque eólico Punta Sierra, en la zona costera de la capital de Limarí. La central, de 82 MW de capacidad, posee 32 turbinas Goldwind y logra una generación anual de 282 GWh. El complejo ayuda a compensar 107 mil toneladas de CO2 por año, lo que equivale a retirar unos 40 mil autos de circulación.\nEl parque cuenta con una subestación Troncal de 220 KV, que permite evacuar la potencia generada, a través del transformador principal de 120 MVA. Dicha subestación tiene la capacidad para incorporar y conectar nuevos proyectos de generación al Sistema Eléctrico Nacional, permitiendo descongestionar la transmisión eléctrica.",
