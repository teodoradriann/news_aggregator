    "text": "Authorities release identity of victim in 31st and Louisiana crash in Douglas County TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - Authorities released the identity of the victim involved in 31st and Louisiana St. crash in Douglas County. According to [Douglas County Sheriff’s Office](https://www.dgso.org/wordpress/), the driver of a 2008 maroon Kia Sportage drove into oncoming traffic Wednesday afternoon, April 24, and struck a 2017 Ford F-150 east of 31st and Louisiana St., which is the 1400 block of N 1300 Rd. Douglas County Sheriff’s Office indicated the driver of the Kia, Michael Landsness, 37, of Lawrence, was pronounced dead at the scene by medics. Douglas County Sheriff’s Office said medics extricated the Kia passenger, Coty Galbreath, 34, of Kansas City, Mo., who suffered serious injuries and was flown to a Kansas City area hospital. He remains hospitalized on Thursday. Douglas County Sheriff’s Office indicated the driver and passenger in the F-150 were taken by ground ambulance to an area hospital and have both been treated and released. Douglas County Sheriff’s Office noted according to the preliminary crash investigation, the Kia was traveling at a high rate of speed westbound before crossing the center line and striking the pickup truck head-on as it traveled in the inside eastbound lane. Any additional details will be part of the completed crash report. Copyright 2024 WIBW. All rights reserved.",

The newly discovered cells counteract tumor development and may therefore be a target for research into new treatments for pancreatic cancer, which is one of the deadliest forms of cancer. The work is published in the journal Cancer Research.\n\"We are still a long way from treatment, but this may show a viable path for further research,\" says Daniel Öhlund, associate professor at Umeå University and leader of the current study.\nPancreatic cancer is one of the cancers with the worst prognosis for survival. This is partly because it is often detected late, and partly because it responds poorly to traditional treatments with chemotherapy.\nResearchers at Umeå University have investigated the connective tissue cells that surround the cancer cells in pancreatic cancer. These cells, called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), play an important role in how the cancer develops. Several types of CAF stimulate the growth of cancer cells and contribute to the cancer cells being resistant to current chemotherapy treatments, making the cancer more aggressive and difficult to treat.\nWhat the Umeå researchers have found is a previously unknown subgroup of CAF that has opposite properties. This group can instead hold back the cancer and open the way for the body's own immune cells to attack the cancer cells. However, this newly discovered group, called interferon response cancer-associated fibroblasts (ifCAF), is in the minority among different CAF around the cancer cells.\n\"The opening we see is whether it would be possible to stimulate the formation of this newly discovered and kinder cell type around the cancer cells at the expense of the connective tissue cells that make the cancer aggressive,\" says Öhlund.\nThe researchers at Umeå University are now proceeding to study potential drug substances that can promote the formation of ifCAF cells so that they increase in number and thus slow down the development of the disease. If successful, it could become a target for the development of future drugs.\nAbout half a million people worldwide are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer every year.\nMore information:\nJoshua Cumming et al, Dissecting FAP+ Cell Diversity in Pancreatic Cancer Uncovers an Interferon-Response Subtype of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts with Tumor-Restraining Properties, Cancer Research (2025).

    "text": "- A post from the Economic Policy Institute showed which states are raising their minimum wages at the start of 2024.\n- EPI found this will translate to nearly 10 million workers being impacted.\n- Minimum wage workers in California, Maine, and Michigan will see pay increases, for instance.\nMillions of minimum wage workers are set to ring in the new year with a raise. Those regional pay hikes\ncome even as the federal minimum wage lingers untouched at $7.25 an hour.\nCome January 1, minimum wage earners in 22 states will see their wages go up, according to the left-leaning\nEconomic Policy Institute. And, beyond statewide bumps, 38 cities and counties will also hike their starting pay.\nThe new minimums mean that nearly 10 million workers will get a raise, per EPI. The majority of workers getting a bump are women, and Black and Hispanic workers will also disproportionately benefit from the mandated higher pay.\nPast research from the National Employment Law Project on the push to raise the minimum wage, led in part by the advocacy group Fight for $15, found that states boosting their minimums have helped cut down on Black-white wealth gaps and resulted in billions more in economic output.\nBusiness Insider looked at the Economic Policy Institute's post about minimum wage changes as well as values from the\nDepartment of Labor to see where in the US workers making minimum wages will see pay bumps. You can hover over each state and Washington, DC, to see where there will be changes at the start of 2024.\nCalifornia, New York, and Montana are three states that will be raising their minimum wages. For instance, California will increase its minimum wage from $15.50 an hour to $16.00 an hour. According to the EPI post, 3.2 million California workers are estimated to be impacted.\nSome of the increases that are coming shortly are due to inflation adjustments or previous legislation to gradually hike pay. Based on a table from the EPI post, 12 of the increases are specifically inflation adjustments, eight are from legislation, and two were noted as ballot measures.\nMaryland is one of the states that will be raising the minimum wage because of legislation. The minimum wage for Maryland will rise from $13.25 an hour to $15.00 an hour. This is due to the\nFair Wage Act of 2023 signed by Gov. Wes Moore earlier this year. \"Maryland lawmakers passed legislation in 2019 setting the state on the path to $15 an hour,\" the EPI post said, but the newer legislation means minimum wage workers in Maryland will be earning that wage quicker than originally planned.\nWith many workers poised to take home more pay soon due to these minimum wage increases, it won't just be workers benefiting from the larger paychecks.\nAccording to the EPI post, there are 5.6 million children living in households where someone will see a minimum wage increase.\n\"The increases will provide critical support to workers and families in need,\" the post said.\nThe increases come at a time when the labor market is still strong, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data before 2024. For example,\n199,000 jobs were added in November. While that's down from 2022's blockbuster job gains, November's gain was more than anticipated. The unemployment rate was also 3.7%, near its historic low, as of November — so workers are still seeing a lot of opportunities despite job openings cooling and will soon receive greater pay.\nNick Bunker, economic research director for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Business Insider that he thinks the most recent jobs report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics \"is exactly what you want to see to feel more comfortable about the labor market being on really stable footing.\"\nBusiness Insider",

    "text": "Judge Denies Trump’s Request for New Trial in E. Jean Carroll Sex Assault and Defamation Case, Upholds $83.3 Million Judgment\nThe former president’s lawyers have vowed to appeal the decision.\nPresident Trump will not get a second trial in the civil sexual assault and defamation case brought against him by the writer E. Jean Carroll.\nA jury at New York found that the former president sexually assaulted her in a dressing room in the upscale department store Bergdorf Goodman sometime in the 1990s and has awarded her tens of millions of dollars in damages. Most of the damages were not for the assault itself but for defamation after Mr. Trump called Ms. Carroll names and derided the case as “a total con job.”\nJudge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over Ms. Carroll’s suit against Mr. Trump,\nruled on Thursday that the former president is neither entitled to a new trial nor a review of the damages awarded to Ms. Carroll by the jury.\nJudge Kaplan says Mr. Trump relies on unconvincing legal arguments and precedent to demand a new trial. “Mr. Trump’s argument is entirely without merit both as a matter of law and as a matter of fact,” the judge wrote.\nMs. Carroll was awarded nearly $100 million total for both the assault and Mr. Trump’s statements about her, which the jury deemed defamatory. For emotional and reputational damages against Ms. Carroll, as well as for punitive damages, Mr. Trump was\nordered to pay Ms. Carroll $83.3 million on top of a $5 million payment that was ordered in May 2023 for the assault itself. He has already posted a more than $90 million bond with the court.\nMr. Trump has said repeatedly that he has no idea who Ms. Carroll is and, famously, that she was “not his type.”\nJudge Kaplan ruled Thursday that he would not revisit the size of the damages, saying that Ms. Carroll was correct in arguing that the money she is seeking from Mr. Trump is a reward for suffering years of emotional and reputational pain.\n“Ms. Carroll’s compensatory damages were not awarded solely for her emotional distress; they were not for garden variety harms; and they were not excessive, for all of the reasons stated in Ms. Carroll’s opposition brief,” Judge Kaplan writes.\n“We categorically disagree with Judge Kaplan’s decision,” Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Alina Habba, said in a statement to CBS News. “It ignores long-standing constitutional principles and is a prime example of the lawfare raging across this country. We are confident that this decision will be overturned by the Second Circuit.”\nAfter the damages for sexual assault and defamation were awarded to Ms. Carroll in May 2023, Mr. Trump appeared at a CNN presidential candidate town hall and referred to her as a “whack job.” He said the trial was “rigged,” and he denied raping Ms. Carroll. “I didn’t do anything else, either,” he said. “I don’t know who the hell she is.”\nHe also made a range of comments about Ms. Carroll on his social media app, Truth Social, where he again claimed she was mentally unwell and that he had never met her. Those posts and his CNN appearance were used as evidence when Ms. Carroll sued him again for defamation.\nDuring the damages trial, Mr. Trump reposted sexually salacious postings Ms. Carroll — who wrote an advice column that often touched on sexual subject matter — had made on X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter. Mr. Trump also claimed that Ms. Carroll had named her cat “Vagina.”\nIn March, Mr. Trump demanded a new trial because, he argued, the jury had faced an overwhelming amount of “‘confusion, speculation or prejudice’ as opposed to the ‘evidence presented at trial.’”\nJudge Kaplan wrote in response that Mr. Trump’s demand for a new trial did not deal with the issue that the jury found unanimously that his statements about Ms. Carroll “were false, defamatory, and made with both actual and common law malice.”\n“It ignores the fact that those defamatory statements were viewed between at least 85 to 104 million times” on Truth Social, the jurist wrote in his opinion.",
