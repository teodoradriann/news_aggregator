    "text": "Alors que Mattias Ekström (Ford) a livré une jolie course ponctuée d’une victoire lors de la 11e étape, la grosse opération a été effectuée par Yazeed al-Rajhi (Toyota), nouveau leader aux dépens d’Henk Lategan (Toyota). La lutte pour la victoire finale sera serrée jusqu’au bout entre Henk Lategan (Toyota) et Yazeed al-Rajhi (Toyota). À l’issue de la 11e étape remportée par le Suédois Mattias Ekström (Ford), Al-Rajhi a dépassé son rival pour la victoire finale. Il a notamment profité d’un parcours qui lui est plus favorable, avec des montagnes de sable atteignant parfois 150 m de haut. Malgré ses 2’27 de retard au départ de la course, le Saoudien se retrouve avant le final de 61 km vendredi avec 6’11 d’avance sur le Sud-Africain.\nBien qu’il ait perdu sa place de leader, Lategan est satisfait de sa course, parfaitement conscient du fait qu’il n’est pas un spécialiste des dunes, contrairement à Al-Rajhi : « On ne pouvait pas faire mieux aujourd’hui, j’ai tout essayé , a reconnu le Sud-Africain. Je ne suis pas un expert des dunes mais je suis content d’être à l’arrivée avec la voiture en un seul morceau. C’est incroyable, on a réalisé un très bon Dakar avec des hauts et des bas, mais dans l’ensemble, je suis content. » a-t-il conclu.\nDe son côté, Mattias Ekström a vécu une journée de rêve. Vainqueur de cette étape, il récupère la 3e place aux dépens du général Nasser al-Attiyah (Dacia), qui a fini 2e de l’étape du jour, à 41 ». Placé à 22’34 du leader, Ekström, possède désormais 4’16 » d’avance sur le Qatarien.\nLes Français Mathieu Serradori et Loïc Minaudier (Century) ont réalisé le 8e chrono, et se sont encore plus éloignés du Ford Raptor de Mitch Guthrie. Classé actuellement à la 6e place, le duo français a 10’42 » de retard sur l’Américain.\nFinish stage 11 of #Dakar2025\nMattias Ekström and Emil Bergkvist win the stage.\nYazeed Al Rajhi and Timo Gottschalk lead the rally by 6m 11s\n– provisional – #Dakar pic.twitter.com/Gf8tgjom7E\n— Rally Raid News (@RallyRaidNews) January 16, 2025",

    "text": "Bengaluru: In a setback to the ruling Congress in Karnataka, a bill that sought to collect funds from temples with over Rs 10 lakh annual income was defeated by the opposition BJP-JD(S) combined in the Legislative Council.\nThe Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill, 2024 was passed by the Legislative Assembly earlier this week.\nIt was defeated by a voice vote in the Upper House, where the opposition has a majority, Friday.\nThe bill among other things proposes to collect five per cent from temples whose gross income is between Rs 10 lakh and less than Rs one crore and 10 per cent from temples whose income is above Rs one crore, to be put into a Common Pool Fund, administered by ‘Rajya Dharmika Parishath’, which is proposed to be used for Archakas’ (priests) welfare and upkeep of ‘C’ category temples (state-controlled) whose annual income is less than Rs five lakh.\nThe act that was earlier amended in 2011 had made way for five per cent of the net income of temples with annual income between Rs five lakh and Rs 10 lakh and 10 per cent of the net income of temples with annual income of over Rs 10 lakh would come to the fund.\nThe amendment bill had created a huge controversy, as it angered the opposition, especially the BJP, which charged the ruling Congress with trying to fill its ’empty coffers’ with temple money, while, the Congress had sought to turn the tables saying the saffron party had effected an amendment in 2011 to seek funds from high-income Hindu shrines.\nLeader of the Opposition in Council Kota Srinivas Poojary, who was the Muzrai Minister during the BJP government, while welcoming the move to provide social security to Archakas, opposed diversion of the revenue earned by temples.\nHe questioned why the government can’t provide funds in the budget for their welfare.\nThe opposition also opposed the proposal in the bill for nomination of the temple committee president by the government.\nMuzrai Minister Ramalinga Reddy, trying to convince the opposition, assured the House that the government would not interfere in the nomination of the temple committee president and also to reduce the amount proposed to be diverted from the temples to the common pool.\nHighlighting that the bill only proposes minor changes to what the BJP government had proposed in 2011, he said, the intention is the welfare of Archakas at ‘C’ category temples and the upkeep of such temples.\nAs the opposition insisted that changes be made to the bill before it is passed, Reddy sought time till Monday, as he needed to discuss it with Chief Minister Siddaramaiah as it involves financial implications.\nHowever, Deputy Chairman MK Pranesh, who was in the Chair, did not give time till Monday stating that there is no such provision as the House has already taken up the bill for consideration.\nThe Bill was subsequently put to vote and it was defeated by the opposition BJP-JD(S) combine.\nThis is the second such setback to the Congress government in this session, as the BJP and JD(S) combine had referred the Karnataka Souharda Cooperative (Amendment) Bill 2024 to the select committee earlier this week.\nPTI\n[Suggest A Correction](javascript:void(0);)",

    "text": "TotalEnergies has announced that it has ended routine flares in Nigeria,making it the first exploration company to achieve the ambitious drive in the country. At a news conference in Port Harcourt on Thursday,the Managing Director/ Chief executive of Total Energies Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Matthieu Bouyer,expressed satisfaction on the attainment of the goal. “Today is a very special day because it is the day when we officially announce that TotalEnergies has reached zero routine flaring in all its operations across Nigeria,” he added. He said the company was very proud of the attainment, noting that it is the first exploration and production company in Nigeria to achieve the feat. According to him,TotalEnergies as a global company, is committed to produce more energy but at the same time, reduce emissions. He said that the achievement was not just a practical demonstration of TotalEnergies’ commitment to deliver less carbon-intensive energy to its customers but aligns with the Nigerian government’s objective to foster a low carbon economy. He highlighted other initiatives it is taking towards the reduction of emissions within its operating environment and the larger society. Mr. Bouyer stated: “Other initiatives revolve around CO2 (carbon dioxide) and CH4 (methane) emissions reduction in our operations through mobilization of best available technologies around 3 pillars: “Reducing Methane emissions: Methane is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 28 times higher than that of CO2 and a much shorter atmospheric lifetime. Reducing methane emissions is a priority, and TotalEnergies intends to establish an exemplary track record in this area. “AUSEA drone campaigns allow us to detect and measure Methane emissions on site so we can take actions towards reducing or eliminating such emissions. “We work alongside our partners to implement such best practices on our non-operated assets as well.Finally, we signed a MOU with NNPCL in December 2023 to support them in their journey to reduce Methane emission with the use of our AUSEA technology. “Reducing fuel gas consumption: we develop energy efficiency technologies to reduce our consumption of fuel gas and liquid fuels. For example, we use solar technology on shore with a 5MWp solar project at our OML58 field. It will contribute to produce a cleaner oil and gas from the field. “Reducing flaring further on our facilities. Having done with routine flaring, we are study the next step which is focusing on the reduction of safety flaring.”. The Managing Director/Country Chair paid tribute to the teams that helped the company achieve the feat and said in arriving at the milestone it was appreciative of the support and positive collaboration of the federal ministry of environment, NUPRC and its Joint Venture partner, NNPC Limited. The event featured presentations detailing how the company achieved zero routine flare. Mr. Bouyer was accompanied by the Deputy Managing Director, Deepwater Asset, Mr. Victor Bandele and the Executive Director, JV Asset, Mr Obi Imemba The conference was preceeded by a visit to the company’s offshore fields by the Minster of state, Gas Hon. Ekperikpe Ekpo; Minister of Environment, Dr Iziaq Adekunle Salako; Director General of National Oil Spill Detection Agency (NOSDRA), Mr. Idris MUSA; Dr. Mrs. Ogechi S. Opete of Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC). With this feat, TotalEnergies has achieved zero routine flaring on both its JV and Deepwater installations and operation, making it the first IOCs in Nigeria to achieve this milestone.",

    "title": "Irish-Syrian activists ask Labour not to support Connolly's presidential bid",
    "text": "A group of Irish-Syrian activists has written to the Labour Party asking it not to back Independent TD Catherine Connolly’s bid for the presidency.\nThe Galway West representative officially confirmed her candidacy on Tuesday with the backing of TDs and Senators who will provide some of the 20 Oireachtas member votes she needs to secure a place on the ballot.\nShe met the Labour Party, which is considering supporting her campaign, on Tuesday. But earlier this week party leader Ivana Bacik and other elected representatives were asked by the Irish-Syria Solidarity Movement not to back Ms Connolly’s campaign.\nMs Connolly’s visit to Syria alongside three other TDs, at a time when the regime of Bashar al-Assad was still in power, has been the subject of scrutiny since she became publicly linked to a presidential run.\nIn an email sent to Ms Bacik and others, the group thanked the Labour leader for her previous support of Syria, which they said was “unique among Irish TDs”.\nIn the email, the group asked the party not to endorse Ms Connolly as it believes she is “not fitted to this role”.\nThe group said it would find it “shocking and deeply disappointing” if Labour backs her. And it argued that the trip “provided legitimacy to the Assad regime and its narrative”.\nThe group also flagged concerns that Ms Connolly launched former MEP Clare Daly’s bid for re-election to the European Parliament last year. Ms Daly, along with Mick Wallace and Maureen O’Sullivan, were the other TDs to make the trip to Syria.\nOn Wednesday, Ms Connolly spoke about her vision for the presidency and defended her record, including the trip she took to Syria\nAt the time, Assad was still in office and engaged in a civil war.\nAsked about the visit, she replied that she funded the trip herself, its purpose was “fact-finding” and she “met no member of government”.\nShe said she visited a refugee camp outside Damascus and “saw first-hand the destruction of a whole city”, adding: “I mean, my idea, up to then, of a refugee camp wasn’t up to scratch really.”\nMs Connolly said they were shown around by Palestinians and “we stayed with them all of the time”.\nThey travelled to Aleppo and met the chamber of commerce and also had a meeting with Unicef, as well as visiting a convent.\n“On no occasion had I anything to do with the government, nor did I ever utter one word of support for Assad,” she said.\nIs Mary Lou McDonald about to enter the presidential race?\nLabour has sent a survey to its members seeking views on how it should proceed in the presidential race and asked directly whether it should support Ms Connolly’s bid. There are varying views among Labour politicians over such a move, which may ultimately be immaterial to her nomination, but still has an impact on the campaign. Support for her candidacy could prove to be consequential for the party as it mulls involvement in the Áras race.\nSeveral Labour TDs believe privately the choice is between supporting Ms Connolly or nobody at all. One TD said some members are voicing concerns about supporting Ms Connolly and, while not a majority, more are coming out to say they would be unhappy “with each passing day”.",

This decision, announced via the national radio of Latvia and reported by TASS, comes as a consequence of these individuals not having applied for any form of residence permit in the country by November 30.\nAccording to the announcement, these individuals were holders of permanent residence permits in Latvia, the validity of which expired in September. In order to continue residing in the country legally, they were required to pursue EU permanent resident status, which necessitates demonstrating a basic understanding of the Latvian language and possessing sufficient financial means to sustain themselves in Latvia.\nThe individuals affected by this directive were required to have their residency status updated to align with the legal requirements stipulated by Latvia. Failure to comply has led to the decision for their deportation from the Baltic Republic.\nWe need your support so Novinite.com can keep delivering news and information about Bulgaria!

    "text": "No rest for the weary. The San Jose Sharks have a quick turnaround today. After traveling home following a [tough 5-1 loss in Los Angeles to the Kings](https://www.fearthefin.com/quick-bites-sharks-strike-first-allow-five-unanswered-goals/), the Sharks crawled into their beds in San Jose early this morning, only to have to rise and prepare for the Edmonton Oilers. The Oilers are already in San Jose, waiting for the Sharks. In fact, Edmonton hasn’t played since Dec. 22, when the team beat the New York Rangers 4-3. The Oilers are 7-3-0 in the last ten games as the team continues to try and work its way back into the playoffs. While the holiday break was a nice way to reset, Edmonton will be looking to return to its winning ways quickly. “I think it’s jumping right back in the saddle and playing the same hockey that we were before Christmas,” forward [Derek Ryan told NHL.com](https://www.nhl.com/oilers/news/preview-oilers-at-sharks-12-28-23). “We’re just coming off a break, so we’re trying to kind of get back in the saddle and get our game back to where it needs to be.” Edmonton will need to continue on this pace, if not better, if it wants to get back into the Pacific Division race. As of this morning, the Oilers sit in sixth place in the Pacific Division, 13 points behind the Los Angeles Kings, who are in third place, and 7 points behind the Arizona Coyotes and Nashville Predators, who currently have the two wild card spots locked up. The last time the Sharks and the Oilers met, Edmonton was in the midst of a slump that management simply could not tolerate. Meanwhile, San Jose was looking for its second win of the season. Less than three days after Edmonton’s 3-2 loss at SAP Center on Nov. 9, Head Coach Jay Woodcraft was fired. Kris Knoblauch, the former head coach of the Hartford Wolf Pack, now resides behind the bench in Edmonton. Connor McDavid has picked up his scoring pace since the Nov. 9 loss. He has 44 points in 29 games this season, much better than the 17 points he had in 13 games when the two teams met last. Zach Hyman leads the team with 19 goals and Leon Draisaitl continues to contribute with 35 points of his own. In net, Stuart Skinner is starting to pick things up. He’s won eight of his last ten starts. He’s become the go-to goaltender for the Oilers as Jack Campbell continues to rediscover his game in the AHL. San Jose Sharks lines tonight For the Sharks, it will be interesting to see if Magnus Chrona gets his first official start in net. He’s played one game in the NHL, and it wasn’t a fair one. Chrona was called in to take over the net during the 10-2 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Sharks had already allowed six goals at that point and Chrona wasn’t put in a place to succeed. However, he’s had some time to play professional hockey with the Barracuda and he hasn’t done poorly. He’s 3-6-0 with a 3.35 goals against average and .900 save percentage. The Barracuda are near the basement of the AHL’s Pacific Division, so you need to take that into account as well. Starting Chrona with a clean slate tonight would allow the rookie netminder to see what playing against some of the NHL’s best is like. Other than that, don’t expect the lines to change too much. Here’s what we’re guessing we see. Forwards William Eklund – Tomas Hertl – Filip Zadina Anthony Duclair – Mikael Granlund – Fabian Zetterlund Mike Hoffman – Luke Kunin – Alexander Barabanov Kevin Labanc – Jack Studnicka – Justin Bailey Defensemen Mario Ferraro – Kyle Burroughs Nikita Okhotiuk – Jan Rutta Calen Addison – Henry Thrun Goaltenders Kaapo Kahkonen Magnus Chrona Edmonton Oilers lines for Dec. 28, 2023 According the Tony Brar of Oilers TV, here are the lines we can expect to see tonight.
