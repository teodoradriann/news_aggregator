    "text": "云南人工种植森林蔬菜年产值约10亿元\n本报讯 首席记者廖兴阳报道 4月23日，来自云南省发展和改革委员会的消息，截至目前，云南省人工种植森林蔬菜面积约50万亩，年产值约10亿元，成为推动林下经济发展的新突破口和农民增收的重要渠道。\n为推动林下经济发展，省发展改革委积极支持省林科院以森林蔬菜开发为突破口，着力开展资源调查、良种选育，林下种植模式及高效种植技术开发、产品研发，以科技助力森林蔬菜产业发展。具体来说，在滇中、滇南区域建成全省最大木本森林蔬菜种质资源收集圃，收集保存木本森林蔬菜40种；选育出“狮山”金雀花、“碧溪”刺五加2个良种并获省级审定；筛选出金雀花、刺五加、大参、梁王茶、长蕊甜菜、守宫木、大果榕7个适宜林下种植的森林蔬菜种类。同时，构建森林蔬菜种植模式和培育技术体系，包括建立试验示范基地1000亩，形成高效培育技术体系8个；在核桃林，开展云南松、思茅松人工商品林林下种植试验，总结形成初植密度、种植修剪管理、林地管理、绿色防控等种植管理技术；开展繁育技术研究，20余种森林蔬菜形成高效稳定的繁育技术，近3年培育优质苗木100万株。\n此外，着力推动成果落地转化。森林蔬菜高效培育技术入选国家林业科技推广成果库，在昆明、楚雄、文山、红河、普洱、德宏、西双版纳等多个州（市）推广实施，带动发展种植1万余亩，有效拓展山区特色经济发展模式，助力乡村振兴。\n截至目前，全省人工种植面积较大的森林蔬菜有香椿、楤木、花椒、刺五加、羽叶金合欢、守宫木、棠梨、扁核木等20余种，总面积约50万亩，年产值约10亿元。从事森林蔬菜种植销售相关企业达40余家，生产经营合作社达300余家，个体种植户数量庞大，涉及100万人以上。2024年，云南省林下经济规模化经营和利用林地面积约5500万亩，总产值约1800亿元，占林草产业总产值的32.1%，同比增长2.2%，林药、林菌、林菜、林禽、竹笋、林下采集（含木本油料）、森林旅游等发展模式已具规模。\n据介绍，下一步，省发展改革委将继续通过争取生态保护修复专项中央预算内投资、林草领域地方政府专项债券等方式，持续对森林蔬菜产业提供项目支撑，并配合省林草局加快推进集体林权制度改革，推动落实公益林发展林下经济管理规定，明确利用二级国家公益林、地方公益林发展林下经济的具体要求。",

    "title": "First North Korean Troops Reach Russian Combat Zone, Kyiv Reports - WorldNewsEra",
    "text": "[Europe](../) First North Korean troops reach Russian combat zone, Kyiv reports The EU has condemned this move as a violation of international law. The first North Korean military units trained in eastern Russia have arrived in the combat zone, Kyiv reported on Thursday. North Korean soldiers were already spotted in Russia’s border region of Kursk on Wednesday, The Ukrainian Defence Ministry’s Main Directorate of Intelligence said. According to Ukrainian authorities, Pyongyang troops arriving in Russia are being trained at five military training grounds located in the country’s east. The soldiers whom Russia intends to use in the war against Ukraine are given several weeks of training before their deployment. The number of North Korean troops stationed in Russia currently totals around 12,000, including 500 officers as well as three generals, according to Ukrainian intelligence information. Russian Deputy Defence Minister Yunus-Bek Yevkurov has reportedly been assigned the task of overseeing the training of North Korean troops. Pyongyang is supplying the soldiers with ammunition, bedding, winter clothing and footwear, and hygiene products. Moscow is also providing each North Korean soldier with standard rations of 50 metres of toilet paper and 300 grams of soap each month, authorities claim. Ukrainian intelligence believes that the Kremlin has high hopes for North Korean reinforcements in its war against Ukraine. The authorities in Kyiv, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have repeatedly warned that Pyongyang is sending its troops to get involved in the fighting. South Korea and the US have also previously warned of the impending deployment of North Korean troops to the Ukrainian front. Putin: ‘What we do is our business’ Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a press conference following the BRICS summit in Kazan, commented for the first time on reports about the presence of soldiers from North Korea in Russian territory for deployment in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. An NBC News correspondent at the conference asked the Russian leader about the military’s goals, citing satellite images purporting to show Pyongyang soldiers in Russia. “Imagery is a serious thing. If there are images, it means they reflect something,” Putin said. The Russian president also noted that the State Duma ratified a strategic partnership treaty with North Korea on Thursday. The treaty includes an article on mutual military assistance. “We have never doubted that the North Korean leadership takes our agreements seriously,” Putin said, “but what and how we will do is already our business within the framework of this article.” European Union ‘alarmed’ “The European Union is deeply alarmed by reports that North Korea is sending troops to participate in Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine,” the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said in a statement. “This would be a serious violation of international law, including the most fundamental principles of the UN Charter,” Borrell said, warning of “serious consequences for European and global peace and security”. The EU strongly condemns the deepening military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow and arms transfers, which flagrantly violate numerous UN Security Council resolutions, he added. The EU “will coordinate its actions with international partners on this issue, including retaliatory measures,” Borrell concluded.

A las 19.00 horas, el Grupo Folklòric Sa Bodega ofreció una ‘ballada pagesa’ que sorprendió a decenas de visitantes que paseaban por la zona. Con gran curiosidad, teléfono móvil en mano, decenas de sorprendidos viajeros se detuvieron para admirar el baile tradicional ibicenco. Mientras los 'pagesos' saltaban alrededor de las 'pageses', alguien en la multitud las comparaba con princesas, por sus vestidos y porte elegante. Tras la exhibición, que despertó la admiración de los presentes, los asistentes pudieron disfrutar de una degustación de productos locales. Marga Orell, cocinera ibicenca, fue la encargada de preparar tres deliciosas muestras de su cocina, utilizando productos de temporada. El menú incluyó un refrescante gazpacho de melón con pimiento, cebolla, pepino y ajo; una ‘coca de pebrera’ elaborada con harina de 'xeixa' y algarroba y, como postre, un bizcocho de algarroba que dejó a más de uno queriendo repetir.",

    "text": "Comunità indignata e sconcertata per il deprecabile atto vandalico compiuto in Campo Giglio. Qualcuno ha danneggiato la Natività luminosa ma soprattutto il Gesù Bambino adagiato nella mangiatoia. Gli sono state spezzate le gambe.\nSenza parole il sindaco di Flumeri, Angelo Lanza, nel pubblicare sulla sua pagina facebook la foto dello scempio. Parole di incredulità ma soprattutto di rabbia, invece nei commenti dei cittadini. Ce la si prende con la mancanza di valori e di educazione da parte dei ragazzi. Ma al momento non è dato sapere chi è l’autore o gli autori del gesto che è a tutti gli effetti sacrilego poiché è stato toccato il simbolo per eccellenza del Natale e della fede cristiana, Gesù.\nQualcuno invoca telecamere e giustizia affinchè i colpevoli vengano individuati e puniti. Il sindaco replica che «saranno visionate, ma il punto resta un altro, servirebbe educare e non punire».\nDunque telecamere presenti e funzionanti, immagini al vaglio della Polizia municipale. Sicuramente ci sarà un colpevole e ciò che tutti vorranno chiedergli è «perchè».",
