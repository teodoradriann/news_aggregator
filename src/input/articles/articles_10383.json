This development will benefit local residents by adopting environmental standards that will be implemented for the 2024 Olympics.\nAfter the Games, approximately one-third of the athletes’ village will be repurposed as government housing projects in the northern suburbs of Paris, including Saint-Ouen, Saint-Denis and L’Ile Saint Denis. Designed to be a low-carbon community with 82 buildings, it is designed to be suitable for living in a future where global temperatures are likely to rise.

Additionally, there is a rainwater filtration building for sanitary use and a waste separation system for further conversion into fertilizer.\nA key issue for this year’s Summer Olympics is the air conditioning in the Athletes’ Village. It has been designed to be naturally cooled, without the need for air conditioning, due to the building’s high-efficiency insulation. This is unlike previous Games where athletes’ accommodation has always had air conditioning. However, with climate change causing global temperatures to rise, even in Paris, some national teams have had to bring their own portable air conditioners.\nEnvironmental analysts say that if the world is to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, all major sporting events will need to be seriously re-examined. This includes distributing their venues, rather than requiring millions of spectators to travel by plane to a single city.\nThe 2024 Olympics are a first step in demonstrating France’s commitment to combating climate change. They are intended to inspire other global events and prove whether large-scale sporting events can be sustainable.\nParis 2024: A Green Olympic Village for a Sustainable Future The 2024 Olympics in Paris are gearing up to be more than just a sporting spectacle. They’re being touted as a showcase for sustainable development and a step towards a more environmentally responsible future. The Games’ organizers are making a concerted effort to achieve this goal through a variety of innovative approaches, focused especially on the design and legacy of the Athletes’ Village.\nA Green Athlete’s Village is a Model for Sustainable Urban Living Located in Saint-Denis, a northern suburb of Paris, the Athletes’ Village will be built as a new urban area and will be a model for sustainable development even after the Games. The village will be designed to be a low-carbon community featuring a collection of 82 buildings designed to withstand the effects of climate change. A key element of this design is the use of high-efficiency insulation that reduces the need for air conditioning. This is a significant departure from previous Olympic villages that relied heavily on air conditioning to ensure athlete comfort.\nKey Features of the Green Village: Biodiversity-Enhancing Features: Buildings will incorporate rooftop gardens and green walls to provide habitats for birds and small animals. This biodiverse design contributes to ecological balance and improves the aesthetic appeal of the village. Sustainable Wastewater Management: A mini wastewater treatment center will collect and filter wastewater for use in household agriculture. This water treatment system effectively reduces water consumption and promotes circular economy principles. Rainwater Harvesting and Waste Management: A dedicated rainwater filtration facility will provide water for non-potable uses. A waste separation system will further convert waste into fertilizer. These systems promote resource conservation and minimize the Games’ environmental footprint. A Legacy for the Future: Re-Purposing the Athletes’ Village The commitment to sustainability goes beyond the Games themselves. The Athletes’ Village will be repurposed after the Olympics to provide much-needed affordable housing in the northern suburbs of Paris. Around a third of the village will transition into government housing projects in Saint-Ouen, Saint-Denis, and L’Ile Saint Denis. This long-term legacy of the village ensures that the substantial investment in sustainable infrastructure will continue to benefit local communities for years to come.\nThe Challenge of Climate Change at the Olympics Climate change is a growing concern for organizers of major global sporting events. As the world’s temperature rises, the challenges of ensuring athlete comfort and maintaining the integrity of competitions increase. While the Paris 2024 Games are on the forefront of sustainability with innovative strategies for the Athletes’ Village, the issue of climate change extends beyond the village itself.\nChallenges and Innovations for Sustainable Games To achieve net zero emissions by 2050, as the world aims to do, major sporting events require significant adjustments. One of the biggest challenges is the carbon footprint associated with spectators traveling to a single location from all over the world. Innovative approaches like distributed venues, digital event experiences, and more sustainable transportation options are being explored to mitigate this impact.\nA First Step in a Larger Transformation The 2024 Olympics are a milestone in demonstrating France’s commitment to climate change mitigation. They serve as an inspiring example for other global events, demonstrating how large-scale sporting events can be made more sustainable. The Paris Games are proving that sustainability isn’t just a trend – it’s a necessity for the future of hosting major events.",

Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience.\nRegister Now The three companies and 11 ships were sanctioned in response to Iran's \"actions to increase its enrichment capacity\" in its bid to further expand its nuclear program, according to a statement from Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\"We remain committed to never letting Iran obtain a nuclear weapon, and we are prepared to use all elements of national power to ensure that outcome,\" Blinken said in a statement. \"As President Biden and the other leaders of the G7 stated earlier this month, Iran must cease its escalations with regard to its nuclear program as well as its other destabilizing actions.\"\nThe companies, all headquartered in the United Arab Emirates, are Sea Route Ship Management, Almanac Ship Management, and Al Anchor Ship Management. The ships designated as blocked property are the Astra, Baltic Horizon, Nile, Yamuna, Berenice Pride, Harmony, Euro Viking, Euro Fortune, Arabian Energy, Parine and Road.\nIranian oil still flowing\nUnder President Joe Biden, the US has sanctioned hundreds of Iranian entities, ships, and individuals accused of transporting and selling Iranian oil, as well as individuals accused of using the proceeds to fund weapons provisions to Russia and regional proxy groups like Yemen's Houthi rebels.\nExperts have questioned whether US leadership, wary of price increases in the global crude oil market, have fully enforced their stated sanctions. Meanwhile, Iran has found new ways of evading sanctions and selling oil to partners outside the West.\nOn June 25, when the US announced sanctions on a shadow banking network Iran allegedly uses to launder oil proceeds, Brenda Shaffer, an energy expert at the US Naval Postgraduate School, told S&P Global Commodity Insights the moves were unlikely to represent a meaningful escalation in effects .\n\"Adding to the weakness of sanctions is the growing cooperation between Iran, Russia and China,\" Shaffer said. \"These countries do not need Western banks and financial systems to move money between them and to the proxies.\"\nIn May, Iran announced it planned to increase output by 400,000 b/d. The latest Platts OPEC+ survey by Commodity Insights tallied Iranian crude production at 3.17 million b/d in May, up from 2.66 million b/d in May of 2023.",

    "title": "Don Kusler: Democrats dominated 2023 with victories for reproductive rights, labor",
    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box.\nVirginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office.\nThat's a victory for Democrats.\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate.\nThat's another victory for the left.\nTwo ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state.\nPeople are also reading…\nThen on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin.\nThese electoral victories make a difference.\nJust look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize.\nLabor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts.\nWorkers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers.\nSometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans.\nIt was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes.\nThe Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business.\nLeadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people.\nThe one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job.\nDid the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker.\nThe sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats.\nSo a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories.\nYes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats.\nKusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action:\nadaction.org.

    "text": "The city of Charleston is bracing for hazardous weather Friday and Saturday, giving Mayor William Cogswell’s new flooding mitigation plan its first stress test. Rain is expected to intensify throughout the day, with peak periods of heavy rain expected from 8 p.m. to midnight. The heavy rain and an elevated evening tide is predicted to contribute to significant flooding — high tides are forecasted at 6.8 feet at 7.27 p.m., and projections show potential for 2 to 3 inches of rain, according to the city. Meanwhile, the Charleston Police Department is loading barricades and will place them in advance of flooding on vulnerable streets across the peninsula. Signal technicians also will be on standby for traffic and transportation needs. City officials estimate between 12 and 25 roads may become “impassable” In the storm. Follow road-closure updates live online at gis.charleston-sc.gov . Lake Dotterer and Colonial Lake have been lowered in advance, and four pumps will be deployed to manage water levels. In addition, temporary pumps have been installed in vulnerable areas throughout the city. DEBRIS: Residents are urged to secure garbage cans and remove any potential debris from storm drains in front of homes and businesses to prevent blockages. Sweepers, trash, and garbage crews will be on standby to clean up any debris on Saturday. The city also says it will monitor Church Creek Basin in West Ashley and work to keep drains and ditches clean. Department of Livability teams have been assisting in identifying and clearing debris and litter since yesterday to mitigate potential blockages. PARKING: Free parking will be available from 4 p.m. Friday until noon Saturday at the 99 West Edge and the Charleston Tech Center parking garages. All other city garages will be open for those who prefer more convenient options and are willing to pay. Residents are asked to not use parking garages in the Medical District which are intended for staff and patients. Voting is now open in Best of Charleston!

Des appels à mener des attaques le 24 décembre « Il n'y a pas de menace immédiate d'attaque à Vienne », a néanmoins précisé le porte-parole de la police. Samedi, la police autrichienne avait indiqué dans un communiqué que « des agents terroristes en Europe appellent à mener des attaques contre des évènements chrétiens, spécialement autour du 24 décembre ».
