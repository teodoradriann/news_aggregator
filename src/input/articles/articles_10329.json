    "text": "CHICAGO (CBS) -- About 50 newly arrived migrants were waiting out the bitter cold on Monday at the Harold Washington Library, which is being used as a temporary shelter to avoid having asylum seekers staying on buses at the official landing zone near downtown.\nA total of 318 migrants were still waiting for placement in one of the city's 28 active shelters on Monday, most of them at O'Hare International Airport, with a handful of others staying at police stations.\nCBS 2's Sabrina Franza spoke to some of those asylum seekers about how they're dealing with a kind of cold many have never experienced before.\nHundreds of migrants were staying at the city's shelter at Cermak and Halsted in Pilsen, dozens of them braving the arctic cold outside – some of them in crocs, some in flip flops – just so they can get a warm meal.\nFrom sunny South America to the icy coast of Lake Michigan; the cold in Chicago is something many asylum seekers have never experienced.\nGeraldin, who didn't give her last name, said she regrets that she's in Chicago, but only because of the cold. Otherwise, she said she's happy with her decision to come to the city, adding that her family left Venezuela because they didn't have enough money to eat.\nThe family has had to brave subzero temperatures in recent days to find volunteers serving food across the street from the Pilsen shelter, the largest shelter in the city's system of 28 migrant shelters.\n\"We brought food, protective equipment for them, clothing,\" said Bryesha Adams, co-founder of Something Good in Englewood. \"A lot of them actually have been coming to our headquarters. They travel all the way to Englewood asking for food, shelter, jobs even.\"\nIn honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Adams and her team set up to serve food and distribute warm clothing to migrants on Monday.\n\"It's freezing in Chicago. They need the clothing. I mean look at the line now; some have on leggings, no coats,\" she said.\nGeraldin was among the migrants waiting in line for food on Monday as she eagerly awaits the opportunity to get a job to support her daughter and the rest of her family.\nCity officials said that on Monday, no migrants were staying inside buses at the official landing zone near Polk and Desplaines. Instead, asylum seekers who had been staying there have moved to brick-and-mortar shelters. The city also said they weren't expecting any buses of migrants to arrive in Chicago on Monday.\nMore from CBS News Extreme cold prompts Chicago to open additional warming centers for residents and migrants Chicagoans braving the bitterly cold weather, city opens emergency warming centers Nonprofit helps migrants in Chicago prepare for bitter cold Chicago delays migrant shelter limits; Pritzker asks Texas to stop dropoffs in dangerous weather Chicago commuters brave extreme conditions during deep freeze In: Chicago Migrants",

    "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo llegó este jueves al gol número 900 de su carrera al anotar el 2-0 para Portugal en el choque ante Croacia por la primera ronda de la UEFA Nations League. El tanto, un remate con el pie derecho desde el corazón del área tras asistencia de Nuno Mendes, supone un hito más en la carrera de récord del jugador. El delantero suma 900 goles en 1238 partidos oficiales, con una media de casi 0,73 tantos por encuentro, que ha marcado con las camisetas de Sporting (5), Manchester United (145), Real Madrid (450), Juventus (101) y Al-Nassr (67). A su periplo en estos clubes se suman los 131 tantos que conquistó con la Selección de Portugal. CR7 es el máximo goleador de la historia en lo que a partidos oficiales se refiere. Le siguen Leo Messi, con 838, y el brasileño Pelé, con 765. La afición lusa recibió el gol de Cristiano con su ya famoso \"Siuuu\" y coreó el nombre del delantero de Madeira, que para celebrarlo se tiró al suelo en la línea de fondo con las manos en la cara y una sonrisa.",

    "title": "Massive 40ft waves flood California coastal towns as people ordered to leave",
    "text": "Massive waves have been hammering the Californian coast flooding areas and forcing many to evacuate.\nPowerful surf rolled onto beaches on the West Coast of the US and Hawaii on Thursday as a big swell generated by the stormy Pacific Ocean pushed towards the shore. Forecasters urged people to stay off rocks and jetties, and to not turn their backs to the ocean because of the danger of “sneaker waves” — occasional much bigger waves that can run far up the sand and wash someone off a beach.\nA high surf warning for parts of Northern California said waves would range from 28 to 33 feet (8.5 to 10 metres) and up to 40 feet (12 metres) at some locations, the National Weather Service said, adding that there were reports of flooding in low-lying coastal areas.\nDespite the warnings, residents came out to watch the turbulent seas\nCoastal roads were swamped and waves even crashed against homes. Plows were needed to clear debris from the iconic State Highway 1, south of San Francisco.\nIn Aptos on the north end of Monterey Bay, surf overran the beach and swept into a parking lot, leaving the area strewn with debris. Santa Cruz County issued warnings for people in several coastal areas to be ready to evacuate.\nAn aerial shot shows the debris covered roads\n“We put evacuation warnings into place around 8 a.m. this morning for this area, and, as you can see, these waves are incredibly powerful,” Ashley Keehn, the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office Information Officer, told KTVU FOX 2. “They’re washing logs up here. A lot of debris, a lot of driftwood. So we’ve been asking people to avoid the direct coastal area.”\nTwo men walk through ocean debris in the Rio Del Mar neighborhood of Aptos\n“Mother Nature’s angry,” said Eve Krammer, an Aptos resident for several years. “I mean these waves are gnarly. They’re huge.”\nThe same area was battered by the ocean last January as the West Coast was slammed by numerous atmospheric rivers. “I feel for the people that are down low here,” said Jeff Howard, also an Aptos resident.\nWhile not quite as huge, the waves along Southern California were also described as hazardous, with life-threatening rip currents. Nonetheless, surfers couldn’t resist.\nA view of massive waves at Surfers Beach of Half Moon Bay\nPatience was key, according to Alex Buford, 27, who was catching waves just north of Manhattan Beach on the Los Angeles County coast. “I was waiting for a while because the waves were really sick, and they’re kinda hard to get into even though I have a really big board,” he said. “Just waited for a good one and I got it and it was a long one. Pretty big. It was sick.”\nIn Hawaii, the weather service forecast surf rising to 30 to 40 feet (9 to 12 metres) along north-facing shores and 18 to 22 feet (5.5 to 6.7 metres) along west-facing shores of five islands.\nA front end loader removes debris along a flooded road\nProfessional Hawaii surfer Sheldon Paishon was getting ready to surf Thursday morning at Makaha, a world-famous surfing beach on Oahu’s west side. Paishon, 30, has been surfing at various spots around Oahu this week, taking advantage of waves during this week’s high surf warning in effect till Friday morning.",

    "text": "<p>BEIJING, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 20th Jan, 2024) The launch ceremony of a book about the time John Rabe spent in China was hosted by Beijing Union University and Research Press on Friday afternoon.</p><p>John Rabe, dubbed the \"Oskar Schindler of China,\" and dozens of other foreigners risked their lives to set up an international safety zone in Nanjing, and thereby saved the lives of more than 200,000 Chinese people between 1937 and 1938.</p><p>The book, \"Rabe and China,\" contains the diary of John Rabe and other relevant documents and recounts the 30 years he spent in China in places including Beijing, Tianjin and Nanjing, as well as the enduring friendship between the Rabe family and China. The diary and documents were supplied by friends and relatives of Rabe who also gave their permission for it to be used in this book.</p><p>The book was written by John Rabe's grandson, German reproductive endocrinologist Thomas Rabe. \"Today is a very important day for the friendship of the Rabe family and China, which has been continuing for four generations and over 115 years,\" Thomas Rabe said in a video address at the ceremony.</p><p>After reviewing his grandfather's experiences in China, as well as his own collaboration and friendship with Chinese medical experts, he said that the cooperation of the Rabe family over four generations with China is proof of a strong bond between the Rabe family and China, or between Germany and China in general, today and in the future.</p><p>Ding Bo, chief editor of Research Press, said the book not only records the history of the Nanjing Massacre from different perspectives, but also interprets the mental and emotional basis of John Rabe's feat back then, as well as the efforts made by his descendants to publicize his deeds and inherit his spirit.</p>",

    "text": "- Vivianne Miedema - 60', 88'\nMan City hand Bompastor's Chelsea 1st loss in UWCL quarterfinals\nVivianne Miedema's brace handed Chelsea their first defeat this season after hosts Manchester City defeated the Women's Super League (WSL) leaders 2-0 in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal.\nThe Blues had only dropped points in two draws in the league ahead of the first loss since manager Sonia Bompastor took charge of the side in the summer. It is also the first time since her tenure began that Chelsea have gone behind by two-goals.\nDutch striker Miedema, off the bench, calmly slotted home from close range in the 60th minute after Laia Aleixandri's header was tipped onto the bar expertly by goalkeeper Hannah Hampton. Miedema, who signed for City in the summer from WSL rivals Arsenal, was there to slot home the rebound.\nShe completed her brace in the 88th minute to demolish Chelsea's 28-game unbeaten streak under Bompastor with a clinical finish in the far corner, splitting the defence with ease to mark her 31st continental goal in just 35 appearances.\nChelsea won the first of four games in 13 days against last season's WSL runners-up, beating them 2-1 at Pride Park, Derby on Sunday to lift the League Cup trophy.\nCity have been injury-ravaged since before the winter break, with England duo Alex Greenwood and Lauren Hemp still ruled out with knee injuries. Miedema was also ruled out for a period of time, returning to fitness following the December break.\nKhadija \"Bunny\" Shaw and Aoba Fujino both picked up muscle injuries in the cup final and were unavailable for the crucial first leg tie.\nBoth sides were lacking a clinical edge in the final third throughout the evening. While City were peppering the opposition box with chances, accumulating 15 shots in total, they were easy for Chelsea's defence to deal with, while the visitors were struggling to get bodies into the box to finish their chances.\nMayra Ramírez did manage to get the ball in the back of the net in the 70th minute, but she was adjudged to be offside in the build-up. Substitute Johanna Rytting Kaneryd also squandered another effort to level the tie after rattling the woodwork.\nLacking their usual ruthlessness, Chelsea were growing frustrated as the clock ticked down, missing another two key chances to level the score. At the other end, City were able to double their lead to seal the win.\nAfter a turbulent season, City parted ways with manager Gareth Taylor, who had led the side since 2020 and delivered a League Cup and an FA Cup trophy during his tenure. Former manager Nick Cushing, who Taylor succeeded, was appointed interim manager after leading City to their only WSL title in 2016 before departing for MLS side New York City FC.\nIn only his second game in charge, having not coached in the WSL in five years, he destroyed Chelsea's 31-game unbeaten run dating back to May last season when U.S. women's national team head coach Emma Hayes was still in charge.\nBoth sides will continue their run of four games against each other on Sunday, facing off the league -- a decisive fixture for City's European hopes -- before the second leg of the quarter final on March 27.",

    "text": "A través de su cuenta de X, el exministro del correísmo José Serrano se pronunció sobre los señalamientos de los que fue parte durante el juicio en EE. UU. contra el excontralor Carlos Pólit, quien fue declarado culpable el 24 de abril de lavar sobornos en ese país. [En los próximos días se definirá la pena de cárcel que deberá cumplir.](https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/politica/carlos-polit-culpable-de-lavar-sobornos-en-estados-unidos-nota/) Serrano enlistó cinco puntos que asegura la ciudadanía los debe conocer respecto al caso. Son los siguientes: - Fui yo, a solicitud de las autoridades de Justicia de EE.UU, quien entregó la información sobre Diego Sánchez Silva a dichas autoridades. - Por tal motivo RECHAZO y DESMIENTO radical y tajantemente las afirmaciones realizadas por Diego Sánchez Silva durante el proceso de juzgamiento contra Carlos Pólit. Reitero y desmiento categóricamente, las afirmaciones de Sánchez Silva y que afirmaban que yo recibí “algo así como sobornos” por parte de él en Ecuador y peor en EE. UU. - Con este fin, por el respeto que le debo a mi país, al que serví, me sometí a una prueba de polígrafo, con un experto de alto nivel calificado de Estados Unidos, reconocidos por las propias autoridades de Justicia de EEUU; con cuestionamientos sobre si participé o recibí sobornos de Sánchez Silva. El resultado de esta prueba es complemente favorable y contundente en torno a que jamás he tenido estas participaciones con Sánchez. - Sánchez Silvia, entregó un testimonio ambiguo y carente de cualquier veracidad (porque no existen) y de pruebas que determinen sus dichos contra mi: que entregó? (dinero, un departamento, un vehículo, etc.), donde, como, cuándo y porque motivo entregó. - 5. ALERTO A LA CIUDADANÍA del interés de la prensa ecuatoriana de TERGIVERSAR y MANIPULAR la información para levantar una nueva cortina de humo que distraiga de la situación del país. “La verdad puede ser distorsionada, pero nunca puede ser destruida. La ciudadanía con discernimiento reconocerá la diferencia entre la realidad y las mentiras fabricadas por los mismos de siempre. Remitiré la prueba del polígrafo y otros documentos a la Justicia ecuatoriana”, manifestó Serrano. Publicidad 👁️ 🇪🇨 👁️— José Serrano Salgado (@ppsesa) A LA CIUDADANÍA: Sobre el juicio contra Carlos Pólit en EEUU y el testimonio de Diego Sánchez Silva: 1. Fui yo, a solicitud de las autoridades de Justicia de EE.UU, quien entregó la información sobre Diego Sánchez Silva a dichas autoridades. 2. Por tal motivo… [April 25, 2024] En tanto, Sánchez, el empresario ecuatoriano, declaró en el juicio el pasado 17 de abril. Dio detalles de cómo habría dirigido un supuesto soborno al excontralor y a Pedro Solines Chacón, cuando este era secretario de la Administración Pública de Rafael Correa Delgado. Al iniciar el interrogatorio, el abogado de Pólit, Howard Srebnick, se refirió a una visita que Sánchez hizo en julio de 2019 a la Oficina de Seguridad Nacional de Estados Unidos. El testigo dijo que no recordaba la fecha con exactitud, pero que sí había acudido voluntariamente, pues lo llevó un amigo. El abogado le cuestionó quién era y este contestó que se trataba de José Serrano Salgado, quien estaría viviendo en Estados Unidos. Entonces llegó la pregunta certera: ¿Ha cometido algún delito con él? Sánchez respondió con un simple sí. Luego le inquirió: ¿Ha sido procesado por ese delito? Y Sánchez respondió con un simple no. Publicidad Srebnick cuestionó si esos delitos se cometieron en Ecuador. Sánchez dijo que entendería que fueron en Estados Unidos, pero aclaró de inmediato que no estaba seguro de cuál era la jurisdicción. Después, Sánchez declaró que fue Serrano quien le presentó a los agentes de la Oficina de Seguridad Nacional. El diálogo sobre el tema de Serrano quedó suspendido, pues el abogado se adentró en los supuestos pagos a su cliente, los cuales han sido negados por la defensa. Publicidad Al final de la confesión, el fiscal Michael Berger hizo preguntas adicionales y retomó el tema de Serrano. Cuestionó a Sánchez qué tipo de delito había cometido con él. El empresario aseveró que Serrano le exigió un pago a cambio de una supuesta ayuda y que, al inicio, él se negó a entregarlo, pero que luego las exigencias se repitieron. Agregó que entregó toda la información del caso al Gobierno estadounidense. Luego, Berger preguntó: ¿Ese delito fue un soborno? Sánchez respondió con un simple sí. Sánchez se encuentra colaborando con la justicia de Estados Unidos, pues firmó un acuerdo de no procesamiento. Sin embargo, esa inmunidad no le protege en otros países, incluido Ecuador. Serrano tuvo muchos altos cargos en el gobierno de Rafael Correa. El principal fue el de ministro del Interior, entre 2011 y 2016. Renunció a este puesto para lanzarse como candidato a la Asamblea Nacional. Publicidad Fue designado como presidente de la Legislatura en 2017, pero fue destituido de esta dignidad un año después, como consecuencia de una confabulación entre él y Carlos Pólit en contra del entonces fiscal general, Carlos Baca Mancheno. Continuó como asambleísta hasta el fin del periodo en 2021. (I)",

    "text": "Alonet Zarum Zandan woke up to the sound of sirens Oct. 7. She and her husband were in Herzliya, Israel, visiting her mother and other relatives and friends for the stone-setting ceremony for her late father, a Yemeni Jew who died last year. At first, Zandan said, they didn't know what was happening. They don't normally watch TV on the Sabbath, but they turned it on \"and it was saying 'Stay indoors, stay in your property, lock the doors, stay away from windows,' ” she recalled. The group sat in a sheltered area of the house and could hear helicopters outside as the scale of the Hamas attack became clear. They stayed there for two days. The couple's flight home to Santa Fe had been canceled, but a friend was able to help them get a new flight from Tel Aviv to Tiblisi, Georgia. Zandan said they encountered crowds of people without tickets at Ben Gurion Airport in Israel; everyone was desperate to find a way out. \"It was a nightmare,\" she said. Twenty minutes after their flight took off, the airport came under attack. From Tiblisi, they flew to Munich, and then to Denver and finally to Santa Fe. \"During that time, I'm already planning, 'We have to do something,' ” Zandan said. She had been asked earlier about forming an umbrella organization to replace the Jewish Federation of New Mexico, which disbanded last year, but there didn't seem to be an impetus. \"This really galvanized people,\" she said. She joined up with a woman in Albuquerque to create the Jewish Community Relations Coalition of New Mexico, an all-volunteer organization with 26 partner Jewish organizations in the state. Zandan said the coalition's goal is to \"unite the Jewish community, inform, educate and advocate,\" in part to counter what she says are simplistic and biased narratives about the conflict. \"My family, they all want peace,\" she said. \"But as much as they want it, they know it can't happen until the terrorists are neutralized and don't have the ability to attack anyone anymore. Hamas needs to be gone.\" Many of Zandan's male relatives have been called up to active duty. \"Every day there's a list of soldiers that have been killed,\" she said. \"And I just pray that I don't see one of my family members up there.\" 'It's changed a lot of people's lives' Aaron Moskowitz doesn't come from a very religious family. But this year, his sister went out and bought a menorah for Hanukkah, which she had never lit before in her own home. A Jewish friend of his was planning a trip to Europe for the holidays. While they were there, she and her husband visited the site of the Dachau concentration camp. He thinks those are indications of a larger desire from the Jewish community to take stock of what it means to be Jewish following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in Israel, and to be in community with others. \"It's made them want to do things that are more Jewish,\" Moskowitz said. He thinks the tragic events have brought Santa Fe's Jewish community closer together, which he finds heartening. He cited this year's Chanukah on the Plaza celebration, which he said was the best he had ever been to. \"It felt different from other years,\" he said. \"It was just really, really strong community vibes over there. And all sorts of people from outside the Jewish community had come and were saying, 'We're here to support you.' That was really moving.\" While the national rise in antisemitism is frightening, Moskowitz said it hasn't been significant locally. \"Most people here really want peace and are friendly towards each other,\" he said. The conflict has sparked a desire for community that he hasn't seen in recent years, he said, noting a group for younger Jewish people recently formed, and during Hanukkah \"there were parties happening every single night.\" \"I think that everybody during this time was reflecting on what it means to be Jewish,\" he said. \"In many ways that meant being together because that's a big part of being Jewish, doing things together.\" 'We can imagine something better' Vic Wiener was born and raised in Santa Fe but spent seven months living in Israel as a child in 1999 and 2000. Wiener was just 10 at the time and \"wasn't super politically aware.\" But it was clear something was \"profoundly wrong\" when an Orthodox Jewish student got into a fight with the only Palestinian student in the class so violent one of them could have been killed, said Wiener, who uses they/them pronouns. \"It affected me really deeply,\" Wiener said of the experience. As they grew up and learned more about the region, their sense of injustice continued to grow. It culminated in Wiener leaving the synagogue where they became a bat mitzvah after an experience during a workshop at a conference for Jewish teenagers, where they expressed support for Palestinians having access to their land. \"That night, students were refusing to hold my hand at the closing circle,\" Wiener remembered. \"People stopped talking to me. I had no idea what I was walking into.\" Wiener it's difficult to be part of a mainstream Jewish organization and also be critical of Israel's politics, a situation that has only intensified following the outbreak of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. Wiener comes from an Ashkenazi Jewish family who fled Eastern Europe and grew up learning about the horrors of the Holocaust. What's happening now in Gaza, \"I don't know words for it beyond genocide,\" they said. That view, and their involvement in protests calling for a cease-fire, has cost them. \"I've had family reach out to me telling me that I'm calling for a second Holocaust, or that I should stand with my own,\" Wiener said. \"I've lost contact with a lot of my family now because of my views on Palestine.\" Friends have shared similar experiences, with some not going home for Hanukkah because of conflict with family members, they said. Wiener thinks the Oct. 7 attack was traumatic for many in the Jewish community because of the generations of violence toward Jewish people, but they don't think the response from Israel is justified. \"I refuse to believe that my safety requires the killing of tens of thousands of people,\" Wiener said. \"That's not safety for me. That's not safety for anyone.\" 'The fortress has been breached' Author and playwright Rosemary Zibart grew up in a nonobservant household. \"My father, the only thing he ever said about Israel was Jews were much more respected once Israel was created,\" she said. \"It's very meaningful that Israel was powerful, so their loss of power is something to deal with because it makes us vulnerable again.\" That sense of vulnerability following the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas is something Zibart doesn't think people outside the Jewish community fully understand. \"Israel was a stronghold, and now it's not,\" she said. \"The fortress has been breached. And that has been a real blow, even to people very far on the left.\" Zibart said younger Jews have grown up with the perception of Israel as an all-powerful behemoth, which wasn't the case for her generation. \"We don't just know it as an imperial power, we know it as a refuge,\" she said. She thinks the current Israeli government has strayed from the ideals the nation was founded on, and she is disturbed by the number of innocent Palestinians killed in the conflict. \"I was raised believing Judaism was a peace-loving religion, and the Israeli response to the attack is the opposite of peaceful,\" she said. \"If Israel loses its traditional values, it will be eroded from within.\" At the same time, she's troubled by what she feels is a double standard in criticism of the nation. In a written piece, she noted New Mexicans are living on land taken first from Native Americans and then from Hispanics. \"It's just that Israel is late to the game — the era of Manifest Destiny has passed,\" she wrote. \"But I can't help but feel some of the indignation about Israel stems from some of the guilt we have about our pasts that we're doing nothing or very little to heal.\" In the early 2000s Zibart belonged to a group called Tikkun that advocated for a two-state solution, but after several years the group dissolved because the members didn't feel they were making a difference. She wonders if now would be a better time to lobby, but change feels so far away. \"It's very difficult to imagine any positive outcome, and that's what's so tragic,\" she said. ‘People treat us like nothing’ Samar Awad, from a small village in the West Bank called Deir Dibwan, arrived in the U.S. at age 15 and soon moved to New Mexico. Awad now lives in Santa Fe with her four children, all in middle school and high school. The Israeli military and settlers have long oppressed Palestinians in the West Bank, but violence against Palestinians has increased since Oct. 7, Awad said. “I’m Palestinian American, but my home is Palestine and I’m hoping one day I could go back and live there with my kids,” she said. “But I’m afraid that’s not going to happen because it’s getting worse every day.\" She added, \"My parents, they’re afraid to go outside. I’m scared I’m not going to have a home to take my kids to.\" Even in her village, the Israeli military has been breaking into houses; a few blocks from her parents’ house, the military beat a 20-year-old Palestinian man to death in front of her cousins, she said. “The thing that hurts me the most is that people treat us like nothing,” Awad said. “That’s how we’ve been treated in Palestine for the last 75 years. … [The Israeli military] have the green light to do whatever they want, [and confront] citizens even walking around the village or even standing in front of their home. Every week, even outside Gaza … there are people being killed. “It’s been going on for decades, it’s not since Oct. 7,” she said. Awad does not condone violence, she said, but she views Hamas’ attack as an attempt to force Israel to release hundreds of Palestinians she said are being held “hostage” in jail. “They were just fighting for our people,” Awad said. “[Israel] doesn’t allow us to live in our land. \"We are fine to share, just let us enjoy our country,\" she said. \"Let us go from [one] village to another. Let us go to the grocery store without stopping us, without questioning us, without pointing a gun on our head. Our kids are not safe to go anywhere there by themselves.” Awad has been attending cease-fire protests in Santa Fe and wishes people would show more support for Palestinians and push for action from the U.S. government. “There’s a lot of people fighting for my people, my country, but there's a lot of people here, they don't even care,” she said. “When I talk to them, they seem to be like, in denial; they don't want to believe what I'm saying. They don't want to understand what I'm saying.” 'Grieving every single day' Samayya Cabré, who spent her childhood in Spain and Sweden, moved to Abiquiú with her parents as a teenager, where the family joined the Dar al Islam community. Cabré now lives in Santa Fe with her 15-year-old son, whose father is from Gaza. Cabré and her son have spent the past two months “grieving every single day,” she said. “Last time we had the strength to look, my son had lost 10 members of his family, all women and children,” she said. “We haven’t looked in a few weeks.” Those deaths include her son’s cousin Hiba Abu Nada, a poet killed by an Israeli airstrike on her home Oct. 20. A video of her son’s uncle, Palestinian doctor Abdullah Abu Nada, also went viral in October, when Abu Nada learned his wife and three children from ages 12 to 16 were killed by an Israeli airstrike after he had been working in the hospital for three days straight, Cabré said. “Some days we wonder, is [the footage] even having an effect?” she said. Cabré has seen more and more people, especially young people, wanting to know more about the conflict, “so that brings hope,” she said. Cabré and her family members have been attending cease-fire protests in Santa Fe, though “some days it’s too heavy” for her son, she said. “[We’re in] incredible disbelief that this is allowed to happen and that the powers that can stop it are not stopping it, but are actually supporting financially and with weapons,” she said. She wants politicians in New Mexico to speak out against the violence. “It’s enraging that it’s being called a war between Hamas and Israel when the people that are being murdered are innocent Palestinians and thousands of children who had nothing to do with Hamas,” she said. “I mean, in this modern era, if [Israel] wanted to target something, they can,” Cabré said. “If this was self-defense … they wouldn’t be killing children. They wouldn’t be killing reporters [who] are telling the truth about what’s happening there.” More than 60 Palestinian journalists have been confirmed dead, according to the nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists. 'You end the occupation, you end Hamas’ Kenneth Mayers, a secular Jew, has long been a member of Veterans for Peace and founded the Santa Fe chapter in 2002 shortly after he moved to the city. Mayers became interested in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in graduate school, when a Palestinian member of his baby-sitting group told Mayers about his family’s displacement from Jerusalem after World War II. Learning more completely changed Mayers' understanding of Israel’s founding, where settlements were built \"on the ruins of Palestinian villages,\" he said. He became an activist for Palestinians' rights when Israel launched Operation Cast Lead in December 2008, which killed about 1,400 Palestinians in Gaza. In the following years, he participated in international marches for peace in Gaza, visited the West Bank three times and also connected with four cousins living in Israel. Mayers has spent the past several weeks speaking about his story and attending local cease-fire demonstrations. On Oct. 7, two relatives of his cousins were taken hostage by Hamas and have not been heard from since. Meanwhile, in the West Bank, three close friends who were Palestinian activists — all with family members killed by Israelis — were “immediately” arrested by the Israeli government, he said. “I think whether you have ‘skin in the game’ or not,” he said, referring to his connections to the region, “if you've got any humanity, you can't help but be horrified and pained by what's being inflicted on the Palestinian people.\" He added, “When people say, ‘Well, we've got to root out Hamas,’ you can only root out Hamas by resolving the underlying issues which give birth to Hamas and sustain it, and that's the occupation. You end the occupation, you end Hamas.” The long-term solution to the violence is creating one democratic nation, equal for all, with religious freedom, Mayers said. That's because \"even those Israelis who favor a two-state solution don’t favor two equal states.\" ‘It’s Palestinians against injustice’ Growing up in Egypt, Zeinab Benhalim routinely saw her mother’s sadness about having been displaced from her home. She left during the Nakba, the mass displacement of Palestinians during the founding of Israel, Benhalim said. “It’s like, the whole trauma is repeating itself again,” she said. Benhalim has lived in Santa Fe for over 30 years and owns Tribes Coffee House. Although she does not know anyone still living in Palestinian territories, the violence in Gaza has affected her daily. “I can’t really function properly because I can’t get [the images] out of my mind, thinking, how is the world accepting this over 75 years?” she said. \"What’s happening in Gaza is … totally inhumane,” she said, adding she “absolutely” supports a cease-fire. “And you know, it’s racism. For me, it’s pure evil. I can’t find the right word to say it, really.” Benhalim has wrestled with thoughts about why Hamas launched the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, knowing the response would be “horrible,” but also described Hamas as backed “against the wall.” “Every single day of Palestinian life is hell, anyway,” she said, adding Palestinians are treated as second-class citizens and routinely intimidated, arrested and abused by the Israeli military. “Do you think that’s the kind of life that you would accept for yourself?” she said. “This is not going to pass. Things have to change … and it doesn’t mean it’s Palestinians against Jews — it’s Palestinians against injustice,\" she said. The U.S. should put aside its economic interests and put “world peace first,” Benhalim continued, saying the U.S. has been destabilizing, rather than stabilizing, the Middle East. “As a nation, as a world, we could do better.”",

    "text": "[Leggi](https://www.meteoweb.eu/2023/12/meteo-clima-molise-record-caldo-venti-uragano/1001342958/) L'anno più caldo: il 2023 e i suoi disastri climatici Il 2023 è stato un anno di record per il clima, con temperature mai registrate prima e una serie di eventi meteorologici estremi che hanno colpito tutto il mondo. Dall'Asia al Nordamerica, dal Brasile all'Europa, non c'è stato un angolo del pianeta che non sia stato toccato da incendi, alluvioni e tempeste. Eventi estremi in aumento In Italia, gli eventi meteorologici estremi sono aumentati del 22% rispetto al 2022, raggiungendo un totale di 378. Questi eventi hanno causato danni significativi ai territori e la morte di 31 persone. Il nord Italia è stato l'area più colpita della Penisola, con 210 eventi, seguita dal centro con 98 eventi e dal sud con 70. Un anno da bollino rosso Nella provincia di Forlì-Cesena, sono stati registrati nove eventi climatici estremi nell'arco di dodici mesi. Tra questi, l'alluvione di maggio è stata classificata al terzo posto tra le peggiori calamità naturali che hanno colpito il pianeta nel corso del 2023. Questo evento ha avuto un impatto statisticamente molto rilevante sul totale degli eventi registrati durante l'anno in tutta Italia. Conclusioni Il 2023 è stato un anno da bollino rosso per il clima, segnato da un trend in continua crescita degli eventi meteorologici estremi. Questi dati sottolineano l'urgenza di affrontare il cambiamento climatico e di adottare misure per mitigare i suoi effetti. La lotta contro il cambiamento climatico è una sfida globale che richiede l'impegno di tutti.
