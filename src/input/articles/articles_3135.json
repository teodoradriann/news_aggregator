    "text": "RIANNE Malixi considers her performance last year as “solid” but is determined to elevate her game further, aiming for greater golfing achievements abroad this year.\nWhile contemplating a collegiate future with Duke University, Malixi isn’t dismissing the possibility of venturing into the professional ranks sooner than planned.\nRecapping her 2023 season, the ICTSI-backed shotmaker describes it as a year of “almosts,” acknowledging fewer victories compared to the previous year but highlighting consistent Top 10 finishes in 14 global ranking tournaments.\n“I’d say I had a pretty solid campaign in 2023. I’d summarize it as a year of ‘almosts,’” said Malixi. “Even if I didn’t win as many events compared to 2022, I performed well, finishing in the Top 10 in most events I played in.”\nThough still without a major victory, Malixi has won two AJGA (American Junior Golf Association) tournaments, placed fourth in last year’s Junior World in San Diego and has racked up four victories on the Ladies Philippine Golf Tour.\nShe also shared being tantalizingly close to clinching certain events, notably her runner-up effort in the US Girls’ Junior Championship.\n“There were events that I was so close to winning” added the 16-year-old rising star, referring to her second-place finish in the US Girls’ in Colorado.\nConcluding the season at No. 62 in the world’s women’s amateur ranking, Malixi recognizes the roller coaster nature of her international performances but emphasizes delivering her best showing in the US.\n“I believe my best plays were in the US, specifically in the US Girls,” said Malixi. “My campaign outside the Philippines was very much of a roller coaster. I had a couple of not-so-well performances but also played extremely well in the other events. With so many events I played in, I realized I am a pretty clutch player.”\nLooking ahead to the new season, Malixi looks for improvement in both the physical and mental aspects of her game, drawing on lessons learned from the previous year’s challenges and successes.",

    "text": "Google has just lifted the veil on its latest AI marvel, Gemini 1.5, marking a notable evolution from the earlier Gemini 1.0. This update brings to the table three significant enhancements that promise to redefine the capabilities of\nlarge language models. For those keen on understanding these advancements and their implications, let’s delve into the details of what Gemini 1.5 has to offer.\nFirst and foremost, the expanded context window is a game-changer. Gemini 1.5 boasts a context window that can handle up to a million tokens, a substantial jump from the 32,000 tokens limit of its predecessor. Imagine having the ability to process, in a single go, content as lengthy as entire books, trilogies, or even an hour-long video. This expansion is not just about quantity; it’s about the depth and breadth of understanding Gemini 1.5 can achieve. Furthermore, Google is testing waters with an even larger context window that could reach up to 10 million tokens, showcasing an ambition to push the boundaries of what AI can comprehend and process.\nThe model’s enhanced multimodal abilities are equally impressive. Gemini 1.5 is designed to understand and analyze a blend of\ncode, audio, video, images, and text. This capability was illustrated through the analysis of a 44-minute silent film, where the model accurately pinpointed and described specific scenes and details. Such multimodal processing opens new avenues for applications in content creation, education, and beyond, illustrating the model’s versatility and advanced understanding of complex inputs.\nWhen it comes to complex reasoning, Gemini 1.5 shines, outperforming its predecessor 87% of the time. This leap in performance is attributed to its larger context window and sophisticated processing power. The model’s prowess in handling complex reasoning tasks places it on par with Google’s top-tier model, Ultra 1.0, indicating a significant step forward in AI’s problem-solving capabilities.\nCurrently, Gemini 1.5 is in a private preview phase, primarily available to developers through its API version. This stage allows for thorough testing and refinement of its advanced features, like the 1 million token context window. Although still under experimentation, these features hold the promise of revolutionizing tasks ranging from coding to creative content generation.\nLooking ahead, the anticipation for Gemini 1.5’s wider release and integration into various platforms is palpable. Its advanced capabilities hint at a future where developers and content creators can tackle complex projects with unprecedented ease and sophistication.\nGoogle’s Gemini 1.5 represents a significant leap in AI technology. Its expanded context window, enhanced multimodal abilities, and improved complex reasoning set a new benchmark for what’s possible with AI. These advancements reflect Google’s commitment to advancing the field of AI and offer a glimpse into the future of digital creativity and problem-solving.\nYou will be pleased to know that the journey of AI innovation is far from over, and Gemini 1.5 is a testament to the relentless pursuit of breakthroughs that expand our understanding and application of artificial intelligence. Stay tuned for more updates as this exciting technology continues to evolve and shape the future of digital interaction.\nSource\nSkill Leap AI Technology News, Top News\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\nDisclosure: Some of our articles include affiliate links.

Conocer los pasos a seguir es crucial para que los seguros, o el [Consorcio de Compensación de Seguros](/economia/2024/11/01/consorcio-compensacion-seguros-papel-dana-111123155.html) (CCS), te indemnice por los daños sufridos: Consulta tu seguro y determina la cobertura: Si tienes daños en tu vivienda o vehículo, revisa el tipo de seguro que has contratado. En casos de \"riesgos extraordinarios\" (como inundaciones y fuertes tormentas), el Consorcio de Compensación de Seguros, un organismo público, se hace cargo de las indemnizaciones. Este organismo responde únicamente si previamente tienes un seguro contratado y en el caso de automóviles, incluso si es solo de Responsabilidad Civil. - Recopila pruebas y documentos: Reúne cualquier evidencia del daño, como fotos, informes de emergencia y noticias, para respaldar tu reclamación. Estos documentos son esenciales tanto para el Consorcio como para tu aseguradora, si fuera aplicable. - Comunica el siniestro: Si el daño parece provenir de un riesgo extraordinario, notifícalo al Consorcio de Compensación de Seguros. En caso de duda, comunícalo también a tu aseguradora. - Solicita la declaración de zona catastrófica: OCU y otras entidades están solicitando esta declaración al Gobierno para que las zonas más afectadas puedan recibir ayudas adicionales. En caso de ser aprobadas, estas ayudas serían independientes del seguro y, en muchos casos, cubrirían bienes no asegurados. - Viajes cancelados: Si tenías un viaje programado y este fue cancelado por el temporal, tienes derecho a ser transportado a tu destino lo antes posible o a recibir el reembolso del billete. Para orientación y reclamaciones, OCU ha puesto a disposición de los afectados el teléfono 91 300 91 46, disponible de lunes a viernes de 9 a 18 horas.

    "title": "Argentina’s eccentric President shakes up Congress",
    "text": "The political landscape of Argentina is witnessing a seismic shift under the leadership of its unconventional President,\nJavier Milei. With a libertarian flair, Milei has catapulted a comprehensive state reform bill into the halls of Congress, targeting key areas such as tax, penal, electoral, and the party system. This move marks a significant escalation in Milei’s agenda to transform the South American nation rapidly.\nRevolutionizing Policy through Legislative Action\nMilei’s ambitious bill is not just another piece of legislation; it’s a blueprint for a new Argentina. Among its 664 articles, the bill proposes radical changes, including tax amnesties for undeclared assets both domestically and abroad, a revamp of the country’s proportional representation voting system, and tighter legal reins on public protests. Perhaps most controversially, the bill seeks to transfer certain legislative powers, including tax and security, from Congress to the presidency until the end of 2025.\nThis legislative juggernaut comes hot on the heels of Milei’s emergency decree aimed at deregulating Argentina’s economy. This earlier action, already facing resistance, relaxed labor market rules and ignited protests from the country’s influential labor unions. Milei, however, remains undeterred, justifying his sweeping reforms as necessary responses to Argentina’s dire economic crisis, which has seen inflation soar above 160 percent.\nA Political Highwire Act\nMilei’s radical overhaul has plunged Argentine politics into uncharted waters. The President, riding on a strong mandate from voters with a 56 percent victory in the run-off election, is adamant about his path. However, his approach has sparked a fierce debate about the balance of power in Argentine democracy. While Congress must green-light the bill for it to take effect, Milei’s decree remains in place unless it faces rejection from both the lower house and the senate.\nMilei’s strategy is not without its critics. Accusations of seeking bribes from legislators have added fuel to the already blazing political fire. The question now is whether Milei will pivot towards building consensus or continue his head-on collision with traditional Argentine politics. Political analysts, like Lucas Romero of Synopsis, view Milei’s actions as a bold strategy, unprecedented in its scope and speed. Yet, this approach risks steering Argentina towards political instability.\nAs Milei continues his relentless push for reform, the entire nation watches with bated breath. His unorthodox methods and fierce resolve have set the stage for a dramatic overhaul of Argentina’s political and economic systems. Whether this leads to a reinvigorated nation or plunges it into deeper turmoil is a narrative still unfolding. What’s clear, however, is that Argentina under Milei will never be the same again.",

    "title": "El Paso Bishop Fires Back Against Attorney General Paxton Over Lawsuit",
    "text": "CV NEWS FEED // The El Paso Diocese bishop has fired back against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton over his efforts to shut down a Catholic nonprofit migrant shelter. In a recently published [op-ed](https://elpasomatters.org/2024/02/22/opinion-bishop-mark-seitz-response-to-texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton/), Bishop Mark Seitz wrote that Annunciation House is being targeted for offering shelter for migrants “as a response of faith.” Annunciation House, the bishop wrote, “has been an effective, compassionate local response to a complex and broken immigration system,” for more than 45 years. However, this month AG Paxton moved to sue the organization for “helping undocumented people enter the country,” according to an NBC News [report](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/catholic-migrant-shelter-battles-texas-paxton-rcna139809). Annunciation House first filed suit against the Attorney General after he demanded the group turn over its records in 24 hours or face shutdown. Paxton’s office then filed a countersuit after a judge granted the nonprofit two weeks to respond, citing public records which it said indicated the organization was enabling illegal immigrants. Annunciation House’s “work is an example of our Catholic commitment to the poor, the Christian call to love one’s neighbor, and stepping into the breach to take action where many will not,” the Bishop said. “Our church, our city and our country owe Annunciation House a deep debt of gratitude.” “This is not about politics,” Seitz continued: I know the guests at Annunciation House, those trapped on the other side of the border, and those who have died trying to cross it. I have encountered them and have experienced their pain, suffering and hope. This is about their lives and our shared human dignity. Our community’s actions in this moment, the decisions that we make, and the response that we offer today, will be judged by whether or not we rise to that standard. Denouncing “inhumane immigration policies,” Seitz emphasized the importance of standing by community aid workers and volunteers assisting migrants in El Paso, “a place which chooses compassion over indifference, human fraternity over division, and radical hope and evangelical love over hatred and exclusion.”",
