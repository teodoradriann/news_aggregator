    "title": "Pope Francis washes feet of 12 women prisoners in Maundy Thursday Mass - Catholic Herald",
    "text": "ROME – Pope Francis on Holy Thursday washed the feet of 12 women inmates at a Roman prison, notably including no men in the ritual, telling them to never tire of asking for God’s forgiveness.\nSpeaking off-the-cuff during his March 28 Mass of the Lord’s Supper on Holy Thursday, the Pope said, “At this moment of the supper, two episodes call our attention,” the first of which is “the washing of the feet.”\nWith this act, “Jesus humbles himself, Jesus with this gesture made us understand what he said, ‘I did not come to be served,’ he taught the path of service,” he said.\nThe second episode, Pope Francis said, is “sad,” and is “the betrayal of Judas, who was not able to carry forward the project of love,” allowing his own plans and “selfishness” to guide him instead.\n“But Jesus forgives everything, he always forgives. We just have to ask for it,” the Pope said, saying an elderly woman once told him an anecdote that he often repeats: “Jesus never tires of forgiving, it’s we who tire of asking to be forgiven.”\n“Today let us ask for the grace to never tire of asking for forgiveness,” he said, noting that each person has their own personal story, “but the Lord awaits each one, with open arms.”\nFrancis said told inmates that by washing their feet, he was imitating Jesus in making a gesture “that calls our attention to the vocation of service.”\n“Let us ask that he makes grow in all of us the vocation of service,” he said, before washing the feet of 12 inmates at the facility from his wheelchair, while they were seated on an elevated platform.\nPope Francis celebrated his Mass of the Lord’s Supper on Holy Thursday, which commemorates the biblical account of the Last Supper and includes a foot-washing ritual in honor of Jesus’s choice to wash his disciples’ feet in the Gospels, at the Casa Circondariale Femminile di Rebibbia.\nA women’s prison which is located roughly nine miles from Vatican City, the facility originally served as a detention center for minors when it was founded in the 1950s, and it was run by Vincentian nuns until penitentiary supervisors took over in 1979.\nToday, the prison is composed of two large departments and four smaller departments and includes spacious green areas where outdoor meetings between inmates and their families take place. A large agricultural company is also attached to the facility.\nAccording to the director of the prison, who greeted the Pope after Mass, there are currently 360 inmates and one child at the facility.\nPope Francis’s decision to wash the feet of only women is noteworthy, as he was the first pope in recent memory to include women in the ritual after his election in 2013, and it comes as the church is discussing how to better include women in the life and ministries of the church, particularly in positions of leadership and governance.\nShortly after his election to the papacy in March 2013, Francis made waves during the Holy Thursday Lord’s Supper Mass, choosing to wash the feet of two women and two Muslims, things which at the time were formally banned.\nIn 2015, he repeated the gesture, washing the feet of six men and six women during the Holy Thursday liturgy.\nHe has consistently held the Lord’s Supper Mass at various prisons, refugee centers, and institutes for the intellectually disabled, washing the feet of Muslims, Hindus, Orthodox and women throughout his papacy.\nHolding the ritual at prisons, detention centers or other similar structures is common for popes, but Francis is believed to be the first to hold it at a women’s facility, meaning it was all women who got their feet washed by him.\nPope Francis in 2016 modified the church’s official rubric for the foot-washing ritual during the Mass of the Lord’s Supper on Holy Thursday, formally allowing women to be selected. Even though this had been common practice for decades in many countries, the rules technically still limited the practice to men.\nIn January 2021 the pope made a similar gesture when he issued a new legal norm formalizing the ability of women and girls to serve as lectors and altar servers at Mass, making baptism the sole condition for admittance to these ministries, rather than gender.\nWomen’s issues have been a major discussion point in Pope Francis’s ongoing Synod of Bishops on Synodality, set to close this October, with many participants calling for a reestablishment of the women’s diaconate.\nFrancis, while repeatedly insisting that women’s priestly ordination is a closed door, has established two separate commissions to study the female diaconate throughout his papacy, and he and his top council of advisors have heard two presentations exploring the issue in recent months.\nThe role of women in the church and their inclusion in positions of leadership and governance is a key study issue for the pope and his Council of Cardinals, which is dedicated to advising the pope on church governance and reform.\nPope Francis’s visit to the Casa Circondariale Femminile di Rebibbia marks the first time a pope has visited the prison.\nAfter Mass, he was given a basket of fresh products from the agricultural company attached to the facility, as well as a stole with images of two hands containing two sunflowers. The pope for his part gave the prison a painted image of the Madonna.\nEarlier on Thursday Pope Francis celebrated the traditional Chrism Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica, during which the holy oils used in the church’s sacraments are blessed.\nIn both liturgies he appeared to be in good form, despite recent concerns over his health after he skipped his Palm Sunday homily. He has struggled with respiratory issues throughout the year, often relying on aides to read speeches for him, however, on Thursday he delivered homilies for both Masses himself without issue.\n(Photo: Vatican Media)",

    "text": "With most businesses now embracing generative AI (genAI) for specific use cases, limitations on the availability of skilled AI practitioners are forcing many to turn in-house – but experts warn that without a clear understanding of what skills it actually takes to pull off a genAI implementation, or how to get them, many companies are flirting with disaster.\nAlthough employers believe AI could boost productivity by 51 per cent if integrated into their operations, the recent AWS Study on AI Skills in APAC found that 75 per cent can’t find the AI talent they need – and that 79 per cent don’t know how to train their workforce to build that talent in-house.\n“The area is changing rapidly, and while companies recognise that they need to be AI ready, they don’t really know where to start,” explained Leif Pedersen, APAC cloud and AI product manager with training firm Lumify Work, the recently rebranded company formerly known as Dimension Data Learning Services (DDLS).\nLumify Work offers a range of AI-intensive training courses, including its 8-week CloudUp and AWS Generative AI Accelerator boot camps, AWS Skill Builder on-demand digital training, and a range of AI-related practitioner certifications .\n“A lot of what we’re seeing in the Australian market is just ‘where do I start?’ and ‘how do I understand what this could mean to my business?’,” he continued.\n“While there are some organisations doing some pretty cool stuff, the vast majority are quite new to the technology. It’s very much toe-in-the-water in this region – and it’s changing very rapidly, so it’s hard to keep up.”\nAn AI skills roll call\nFor companies just moving into the AI space, managers believing that AI capabilities are just something that existing technologists and developers can pick up, are bound to be disappointed.\nGartner, for one, recently surveyed over 700 companies in the US, UK, and Germany and found that 87 per cent were already operating dedicated AI teams – and that two-thirds were creating new roles specifically for genAI.\n“The deployment of AI and genAI within organisations is demanding specific capabilities, “ Gartner VP analyst Jorg Heizenberg said, “meaning that for the data and analytics team, the investment in new talent is real, urgent and required.”\n“There is no benchmark that determines the size of the D&A team as there are too many dependencies. The question that chief data analytics officers [CDAOs] should ask themselves is how many roles they need to ensure their teams are successful and effective.”\nThe true breadth of AI-related roles will surprise many: contemporary AI teams must, for example, include essential roles such as machine learning engineers, data engineers, data scientists, prompt engineers, AI ethicists, and translators between data and analytics and AI.\nProject teams require strategic heads that can develop an AI strategy and shepherd it through its lifecycle, as well as business needs analysis and development capabilities such as AI architect, AI risk and governance specialist, AI product manager, analytics engineer, UX designer, and AI developer.\nWith genAI expanding the reach of AI to sensitive customer-facing interactions – where issues like privacy and ethics come into play – companies must also consider the importance of emerging AI roles like knowledge engineer, model validator, and decision engineer.\nIt is also crucial to bring everyday workers into this change process, Gartner warned, with 39 per cent of companies running genAI literacy programs to help workers consume, analyse, and make smart decisions with data – an essential part of the transition since new AI tools are ultimately being implemented to benefit those workers.\nCompanies that fail to invest in their workforce’s AI skills now will regret it down the road, Heizenberg warned, with a quarter of staff attrition expected to be due to managers’ lack of data literacy.\n“Business leaders should not ignore data and AI literacies,” he said. “They are interrelated as half of AI techniques are fuelled by data, and data literacy is essential to AI literacy and vice versa.”\nBootstrapping the internal AI team\nRather than trying to build a comprehensive roster of AI skills from the get-go, AWS technical trainer Peter Vandaele recommends that companies “choose a use case and start simple.”\nTo build developers’ AI capabilities, Vandaele said, developers might start working with the AWS Bedrock AI foundation, then work with the “amazing foundational models” – including human speech and natural language processing – to grow into ever more complex and business-driven applications.\n“If you start small,” he said, “you can get started pretty easily with stuff like Bedrock.”\n“There’s a whole bunch of capabilities in there that really help you go through this whole MLOps journey, from setting up and preparing your data to setting up the infrastructure, to actually training your model.”\nSteadily evolving AI use cases will also build companies’ understanding of their skills requirements, allowing them to target further training to deliver the biggest benefit to the business – and the most effective assistance to expanding AI teams.\n“It really needs to come back to what you are trying to achieve by using this technology in your organisation,” Pedersen said. “Do you just need to understand what AI is and how it can improve your processes or help your people?”\n“You can get very technical very quickly,” he added, “as you move to building really sophisticated AI models and engines, ingesting huge amounts of data and coming up against issues like bias, ethics, and AI hallucinations.”\n“If there’s a use case out there, there’s a fair chance we’ve delivered training around it in some way, shape, or form. Ultimately, you can be as technologically advanced as you want to be or need to be.”\nClick HERE to learn more.",

    "title": "'Matter of time before Kejriwal comes out of jail' says AAP as they celebrate bail for Delhi CM | India News - Times of India",
    "text": "NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has granted interim bail to the chief minister in the now scraped policy case registered by the enforcement directorate today. The CM will, however, continue to remain in jail, as he was arrested by the CBI in the same case.Advocate Vivek Jain, counsel for Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, celebrated the occasion and posted on social media platform X. He said, \"There are many issues of law with which the Supreme Court was grappling. One of the issues was the necessity.\"Further, the Delhi State President and Aam Aadmi legal cell advisor, advocate Sanjeev Nasair also took to X and posted, \"I thank the Supreme Court that today is a day of great relief. We have been saying from the very first day.\"AAP, the National general secretary organisation and MP Sandeep Pathak said, \"This is a relief... When they can't stop this party, they jail all the leaders of the party. So, in such a situation, the Supreme court order is very soothing. I believe that party is not important, the country is. It is very important, in the national interest, that a dictator doesn't attempt to finish off a party like this. So, such decisions should be written in golden letters in the history of the country.\"Delhi minister Saurabh Bharadwaj said that the government had anticipated the SC would give bail to Kejriwal, which is why the CBI arrested him in the same case\"PMLA is a black law. The provisions for bail under this are so difficult that it is almost impossible to get bail. First, the lower court granted him bail and observed that \"ED is acting with bias.\" So, today's bail by the Supreme Court is a huge thing. The Centre had anticipated that the Supreme Court would grant him bail in the ED matter. So, to ensure that he continues to be in jail even after bail, the CBI arrested him. The burden of proof lies on the CBI. So, I don't think there will be much of an issue. It's just a matter of time before Arvind Kejriwal comes out of jail,\" Saurabh Bharadwaj said. However, the BJP hit out at the AAP and said that the interim bail was not a complete relief from the crime committed.BHP Chief Virendraa Sachdeva said in a post on X \"This is a decision between the investigation agency and judiciary. Interim bail doesn't mean that you are acquitted. Let the final decision come.\"Additionally, BJP MP Kamaljeet Sehrawat said, \"The interim bail is not a relief from the crime that one has committed. Interim bail only provides for one to stay out of jail as the case proceeds. It does not mean that Kejriwal has not done a scam, or that he was not involved in corruption. Perhaps, the Supreme court has allowed him to be out and work as the people of Delhi are suffering. But the court has not acquitted him.\"A bench headed by Justice Sanjiv Khanna referred Kejriwal's petition challenging his arrest by the ED to a larger bench.The Supreme court, while granting interim bail to Kejriwal in the ED case, observed that the Delhi CM has suffered incarceration of 90 days and that it's conscious that he is an elected leader.The top court had reserved the verdict on Kejriwal's plea for May 17.",

    "text": "La víspera de Navidad, Belén parece un pueblo fantasma. La guerra en Gaza detiene las celebraciones [Melanie Lidman](/author/melanie-lidman) El lugar donde según la Biblia nació Jesús, normalmente abarrotado, era un pueblo fantasma el domingo después de que las celebraciones de la víspera de Navidad se cancelaran en Belén debido a la guerra entre [Israel](/tag/israel) y Hamás. No estaban las luces festivas ni el árbol de Navidad que suelen decorar la plaza del Pesebre, ni tampoco las masas de turistas extranjeros que se congregan cada año por las fiestas. Docenas de agentes de seguridad palestinos patrullaban la plaza vacía. Las tiendas de regalos abrieron tarde en la víspera de Navidad, aunque unas pocas lo hicieron una vez paró el aguacero. Pero había pocos visitantes. “Este año, sin el árbol de Navidad y sin luces, sólo hay oscuridad”, dijo el fraile John Vinh, un monje franciscano de [Vietnam](/tag/vietnam) y que vive en [Jerusalén](/tag/jerusalen) desde hace seis años. Él siempre iba a Belén por Navidad, pero este año era especialmente sombrío, explicó mientras miraba a un nacimiento en la plaza del pesebre, donde un niño Jesús envuelto en una tela blanca recordaba a los cientos de niños muertos en los combates en [Gaza](/tag/gaza). Había alambre de espino en torno al belén, y los adoquines grises no reflejaban luces alegres ni los destellos de color que suelen llenar la plaza durante las navidades. “No podemos justificar sacar un árbol y celebrar con normalidad, cuando algunas personas (en Gaza) ni siquiera tienen casas a las que ir”, dijo Ala'a Salameh, uno de los propietarios del restaurant Afteem, un local familiar de falafel a unos pasos de la plaza. Salameh dijo que la víspera de Navidad suele ser el día más atareado del año. “Normalmente no puedes encontrar ni una silla para sentarte, estamos llenos de la mañana a la medianoche”, dijo Salameh. Este año sólo había una mesa ocupada, por periodistas que se tomaban un descanso de la lluvia. El restaurante operaba en torno a un 15% de la capacidad normal y no podía cubrir los costes operativos, señaló Salameh. Estimó que incluso cuando termine la guerra, tomará otro año que el turismo vuelva a Belén con normalidad. La cancelación de los festejos navideños es un duro golpe para la economía local. El turismo supone en torno al 70% de los ingresos de Belén, casi todo durante las navidades. Muchas grandes aerolíneas han cancelados los vuelos a Israel y hay pocos extranjeros de visita. Las autoridades locales indicaron que unos 70 hoteles en Belén se han visto obligados a cerrar, lo que deja a miles de personas sin trabajo. Unos 20.000 palestinos han muerto y más de 50.000 han resultado heridos durante la ofensiva aérea y terrestre israelí contra Hamás, que gobierna Gaza, según las autoridades de salud del territorio, mientras que el 85% de los 2,3 millones de residentes se ha visto desplazado. La guerra comenzó tras el letal ataque de Hamás del 7 de octubre contra el sur de Israel, en el que los milicianos mataron a unas 1.200 personas, la mayoría civiles, y se llevaron más de 240 rehenes. Los combates en Gaza también han afectado a la vida en Cisjordania. Desde el 7 de octubre, el acceso a Belén y otras poblaciones palestinas en el territorio ocupado por Israel ha sido difícil, con largas filas de conductores que esperan a pasar los controles militares. Las restricciones también han impedido que decenas de miles de palestinos salgan del territorio para trabajar en Israel.",

Eu não veto candidato adversário\", disse o presidente. \"Se ele conquistar o direito de ser candidato, que seja candidato.\"\nLula continuou: \"Ora, se eu derrotei ele quando eu era oposição e ele situação, imagina agora que sou situação e ele, oposição. Eu vou mostrar para ele que quem está na Presidência só perde uma eleição se for incompetente\".\nQuestionado se a declaração seria uma confirmação de sua candidatura à reeleição em 2026, Lula recuou.\n\"Não, não. Também é cedo. Eu sou um jovem de 78 anos de idade, eu me considero em pleno estado de saúde, eu tenho muita força física, eu tenho muita capacidade de trabalho. Mas eu não vou levar o povo brasileiro a cometer um erro. Eu vou chegar no momento certo\", disse.\nLula acrescentou: \"Não precisa ser eu. A única hipótese que eu disse que eu posso ser candidato é que se todos os indicadores mostrarem que eu sou a única pessoa para derrotar o fascismo e a extrema-direita, eu não teria problema de ser candidato. Mas eu espero que a gente, até lá, arrume uma pessoa mais competente, mais jovem e com mais disposição\".\nBolsonaro foi condenado à inelegibilidade por oito anos pelo Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) em junho de 2023. No julgamento, os magistrados identificaram abuso de poder político e uso indevido dos meios de comunicação.\nJuca Kfouri\nO Corinthians não está em condições de fazer apostas\nJosias de Souza\nAmericanas: investigação não chegou ao 1º escalão\nRaquel Landim\nPlano de cortes de Haddad não confrontará esquerda\nAlicia Klein\nAbel errou tudo dentro de campo e acertou fora dele\nComunicar erro Veja também Deixe seu comentário Só para assinantes",

    "title": "WATCH: Jim Cantore Witnesses Rare Thundersnow in Chicago Live on Weather Channel",
    "text": "A rare weather phenomenon known as thundersnow was caught on camera during a live broadcast by The Weather Channel's Jim Cantore on Friday, and his reaction builds on a legacy of viral thundersnow moments. The thundersnow occurred while Cantore was reporting on a blizzard in Chicago . Cantore immediately paused after a bright flash mid-broadcast, as snow fell rapidly. “Ooh,” Cantore is heard saying. “Is that lightning? That was lightning.” Cantore then takes a few steps back and says “We just had it, we just had it!” “I saw it, saw it even with a light in my face,” Cantore continued. Cantore was responding to a thundersnow event happening before his eyes while on location. Since 1996, Jim Cantore of The Weather Channel has been enlightening viewers on the phenomenon of thundersnow, and his excited reactions have gone viral and earned both compilation videos and autotune songs . Chicago Office of Emergency Management and Communication Executive Director Jose Tirado alerted residents Friday that any upcoming travel could potentially become dangerous as more snow was expected. \"If you must travel, use extreme caution,\" Tirado said, according to WMAQ . Dr. Olumsibo Ige, the Commissioner of Chicago Department of Public Health, said that those who have health issues should stay indoors and not endure physical activities like snowball fights and snow shoveling. \"Playing outside in the cold for long periods can also take a toll. So help keep them indoors as much as possible,\" Ige said. Chicago Fire Commissioner Annette Nance-Holt said ahead of the storm that lives . \"Limit your time outdoors,\" Nance-Holt said. \"We have not seen cold weather like this since 2019.\" The storm is brewing and stewing across the U.S., with expected single-digit temperatures from the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles all the way up into the Canadian border. Blizzard conditions are forecast through the Midwest and southward.",
