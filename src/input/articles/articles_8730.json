    "title": "Injury to Oakland Athletics star Mason Miller could derail MLB trade deadline plans for teams",
    "text": "Oakland Athletics All-Star closer Mason Miller has been the subject of trade rumors throughout the summer. He’s performed like the best closer in the game and has drawn interest from several contending teams.\nWhile the A’s asking price in talks surrounding Miller have been sky high , it has not stopped rumors from continuing to pop up.\nUnfortunately for contending teams, this latest update could suggest that Miller will not be dealt ahead of the July 30 MLB trade deadline.\nMartin Gallegos of MLB.com reports that the A’s have placed Miller on the injured list with a fractured pinkie on his non-throwing hand. Per the report, Miller suffered said injury when he put his hand down awkwardly on a training table as he prepared for an exercise. Talk about a freak injury.\nRelated: Underrated Oakland Athletics pitcher drawing interest on MLB trade block\nOakland Athletics unlikely to deal Mason Miller ahead of MLB trade deadline Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports The injury seems minor. It’s also on his non-throwing hand. This could still lead to contending teams making a move for Miller despite the injury.\nHowever, the likelihood of Oakland moving Miller was never great in the first place. He’s under team control for five more seasons at what will be a cheap price compared to the broader MLB market. Miller has also performed at an incredible level for the otherwise lowly A’s.\nMason Miller stats (2024): 1-1 record, 2.21 ERA, 0.84 WHIP, 70 strikeouts, 40.2 innings Things are also complicated by the fact that the 25-year-old Miller has openly suggested he’d like to make the shift back to being a starter. That was his role during a dominating minor league career.\nIf so, Oakland’s asking price in any trade would increase even more. Right now, it’s a stronger likelihood that he’ll be moved during the winter.",

    "title": "Election audits should be routine, not reactionary",
    "text": "By Jacqueline Doyer ,\n6 hours ago\nA recent report by the Utah lieutenant governor's office details \"deeply troubling\" findings regarding Cache County's handling of a 2023 election. Utah election law was repeatedly violated, and election officials demonstrated \"a pointed disregard\" for state policy and practices.\nThe kicker: Cache County was hand-picked as a “Center for Election Excellence” by a left-wing “Zuck Bucks” group, the U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence.\nA project of the Center for Tech and Civic Life, the alliance is an $80 million program that claims to improve elections and “revitalize American democracy.” That’s laughable, considering Cache County’s performance review.\nThe report follows a process audit of the 2023 municipal and primary elections. It details 31 findings and recommendations describing an office so dysfunctional that it handled nearly every part of the election process incorrectly — and may have even tried to cover up its failures.\nThe findings were so abysmal that Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson was forced to remind the Cache County clerk that it is his duty to “learn and comply” with election laws and procedures. Thankfully, no evidence of fraud was discovered, but the audit uncovered “significant problems … that could have introduced numerous opportunities for bad actors to impact the county’s election results.”\nPerhaps the most egregious failure discovered was the chain of custody for ballots, which the report described as virtually nonexistent.\nBallots are like pieces of evidence in a criminal case. To introduce evidence at trial, a prosecutor must show it is the same item removed from the crime scene and that it has been properly handled from the time it left the scene until it arrived in the courtroom. Similarly, we should be able to trace a ballot every step along the way, from voting to tabulation. This is vital to ensuring that every ballot is accounted for. It protects against fraud, and it is essential for accurate post-election audits.\nBut this was not possible in Cache County. The clerk’s office failed to properly log ballot retrieval, ballot storage bags were not sealed, and ballots were commingled and processed in two different locations. Instead of counting ballots before scanning them into tabulators, the county weighed them, got “close to 200,” and scanned them.\nReconciliation — the process of verifying that the number of voters who voted in an election matches the number of ballots cast — requires accurate numbers. It should be easy for election officials and provide assurance to the public that things are working as they should, but “the absence of proper chain of custody” made legally required reconciliation “impossible.”\nA critical safeguard for ballots by mail in Utah is a two-stage system to verify and audit signatures on ballots. Crucially, two different people are supposed to do this to catch any mistakes, but this safeguard was disregarded. Cache County had the same person who performed the initial review grade their own work. Recounts revealed “many errors in signature verification,” including 40 ballots that were initially improperly excluded from tabulation.\nAnother serious mistake was the county’s failure to run legally required pre-election testing on voting equipment. This testing allows election administrators to verify ballots were programmed accurately and that equipment tabulates ballots correctly. This failure to run the required testing delayed tabulation and caused “unnecessary confusion.” Even worse, when the lieutenant governor’s office asked for proof that the tests were completed, Cache County apparently forged records, a matter under investigation by local authorities.\nThese findings invite an obvious question: How did the left-wing alliance deem Cache County a “Center for Election Excellence”? Despite claims of assisting election officials and offering improvement plans for participating offices, none of the alliance’s so-called experts apparently picked up on how poorly run Cache County was. If they did, no one did anything about it.\nIn fact, the county didn’t even know who to email when it sought to withdraw from the Alliance for Election Excellence. Meanwhile, some jurisdictions that have joined an exodus from the alliance noted that its requirements would distract from the immense responsibilities already involved in running upcoming elections. States like Indiana and Louisiana have the right idea: Ban groups like the alliance from operating in their states. It’s not like they’re helping anyway.\nVoters need to be confident in election results no matter who wins. They need to know proper processes were followed to trust the results. From sheer ineptitude to outright deception, Cache County is a poster child for why states need to use process audits to verify that state law and procedures are followed. As we head toward another presidential election, these audits need to be routine, not reactionary.\n• Jacqueline Doyer is legal policy director for the Honest Elections Project.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "(CNN) — His face has become instantly recognizable around the world: A red-haired baby boy holding a pink elephant toy, looking directly into the camera with a toothless smile.\nHis name is Kfir Bibas, and he is the youngest of the 253 hostages taken into Gaza by Hamas and other militant groups during the terror attacks against Israel on October 7.\nOn Thursday, Kfir turns one — if he is still alive.\nThe baby boy was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel alongside his parents Yarden and Shiri, and his four-year old brother Ariel.\nHis family held an event in Tel Aviv on Thursday, commemorating what they called “the saddest birthday in the world.”\nLarge crowd of people filled the square in central Tel Aviv that has become known as the “Hostages Plaza.” Many were holding orange balloons, a nod to Kfir’s red hair. A large screen displaying the number of days the hostages have been held in Gaza stood nearby - 103.\nPeople are also reading…\nOn Tuesday, a smaller group of friends and relatives of the Bibas family held an event at Nir Oz on Tuesday, commemorating Kfir’s birthday with a large balloon display and a cake featuring the famous photo of Kfir with the pink elephant.\nThe same picture was propped up next to Israel’s President Israeli Isaac Herzog when he spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.\n“Kfir Bibas is not the enemy of the Hamas. The Hamas don’t have any rules,” Jimmy Miller, cousin of the Bibas family, told CNN on Wednesday.\n“You know, any rules even from the Quran because in the Quran, you cannot do damage to kids … so Hamas breaks all the rules of the Islam,” he added.\nIt is not clear whether Kfir and his family are still alive. The two boys and their mother were\nnot released from Gaza during the temporary truce in late November, despite the fact that the deal agreed between Israel and Hamas called for all women and children to be set free.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said at that time they believed the family was being held hostage by other militia groups and not by Hamas.\nHowever, later that week, Hamas said, without providing any evidence, that Kfir, his brother and his mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike.\nThe IDF said at that time the it was assessing the claim. Asked on Thursday whether there was any conclusion in that investigation, a spokesperson told CNN: “The IDF has no comment.”\nA few days after making the claim that the family were dead, Hamas released a video of Yarden Bibas, Kfir’s father, in which he blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the death of his wife and two children. Bibas appeared to be in extreme distress in the video and was very likely speaking under duress.\nThe IDF called the video a “cruel act of psychological terror which Hamas is using against families of hostages.”\nIsrael believes 253 hostages were taken into Gaza during the Hamas attack on October 7. Following hostage releases and one rescue, the Prime Minister’s Office says 132 hostages remain in Gaza, of whom 105 are alive and 27 dead.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Google ha anunciado que el próximo mes ampliará la disponibilidad de su función de edición de fotos impulsada por IA a todos los usuarios de Google Fotos en iOS.\n Conocido como Magic Editor, que fue muy promocionado en la campaña de marketing de la serie Google Pixel 8 del año pasado, Magic Editor utiliza inteligencia artificial generativa para realizar ediciones fotográficas complejas. Es capaz de rellenar huecos, mover objetos y hacer ajustes adicionales que normalmente se asocian con herramientas de edición profesionales como Photoshop.\nInicialmente, esta herramienta de edición solo estaba disponible para los propietarios de Google Pixel 8 y los suscriptores de Google One. Sin embargo, a partir del 15 de mayo, estará disponible para todos los usuarios de Google Fotos en iOS.\nEn la app Google Fotos para iOS y Android, los usuarios tendrán acceso a 10 guardados de Magic Editor al mes de forma gratuita. Para obtener más guardados, pueden contratar el plan Premium Google One, que comienza con 2 TB de almacenamiento por 10 dólares al mes o 100 dólares al año.\nAdemás de Magic Editor, Google también ofrece otras herramientas de edición fotográfica en Google Fotos, como Desenfoque fotográfico, Ofertas de cielo, Color pop, efectos HDR para fotos y vídeos, Desenfoque de retrato, Luz de retrato (con la posibilidad de añadir luz y balance de luz), fotos cinemáticas, estilos de collage en el editor y efectos de vídeo.\nPara utilizar las funciones de IA, los usuarios de dispositivos Apple deben tener iOS 15 o posterior.\nGoogle Fotos es una aplicación gratuita para iPhone y iPad disponible en la App Store.\nFuente: MacRumors\niOS",
