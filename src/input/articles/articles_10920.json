    "text": "Under fire for accusations of stolen valor, U.S. Rep. [Troy Nehls ](https://www.texastribune.org/directory/troy-nehls/)is doubling down on defending his military record by blaming “the establishment” forces seeking to discredit him. Nehls, R-Richmond, has been under intense scrutiny over his display of a combat service badge that the Army revoked and removed from his service record last year. RELATED Nehls, who represents a large swath of suburbs southwest of Houston, released what he called a “final written comment” on the controversy Tuesday afternoon. Nehls did not dispute that his Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB) had been revoked by the Army, but offered no explanation for why he continued to wear it until as recently as this month. The congressman instead accused his critics of using the military to undermine him for his hardline conservative views. Nehls is a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus. “Unfortunately for me, as an America First Patriot and an outspoken member of Congress, there are no lengths to which the establishment won’t go to discredit me, including my CIB, which I was awarded over 14 years ago,” Nehls said in his Tuesday statement. “Nothing more needs to be said.” On Wednesday, Nehls had apparently stopped wearing the badge. “Because you guys are vultures,” he told reporters, according to [NOTUS](https://www.notus.org/congress/troy-nehls-stops-wearing-combat-infantryman-badge), a nonprofit newsroom. “I know what I’ve done, and I certainly don’t have to justify myself to you guys. You were probably in middle school when I was over there. So I don’t have to justify myself to you in any form or fashion. But I know the truth. And now that I don’t wear that, what are you going to talk to me about?” Nehls served in the Army from 1988 to 2008, first with the Wisconsin National Guard and then in the Army Reserve. During his two deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, Nehls served in the civil affairs branch, the Army [confirmed](https://www.notus.org/house/army-confirms-troy-nehls-ineligible-combat-badge) to the Washington outlet NOTUS. The Combat Infantryman Badge was apparently incorrectly awarded for his tour in Afghanistan in 2008. Only infantrymen or Special Forces soldiers who engaged in active combat are eligible for the Combat Infantryman Badge. In his Tuesday statement, Nehls appeared incredulous over the Army’s move to rescind his badge, even as he acknowledged that it occurred. Nehls previously argued in a [letter](https://nehls.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/nehls.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/RepNehlsLettertoMajorGeneralThomasRDrew.pdf) to the Army’s human resources command that the division he had been a part of was indeed a combat unit. “In 2023, 14 years after my retirement, suddenly, the Department of the Army rescinded my CIB. According to my correspondence I received from the Department of the Army, 142,596 CIBs have been awarded over the past 20 years. Of these, only 47 CIBs have been rescinded. So, let me get this straight, the Department of the Army says that the 101st Airborne Division has been 99.968% correct in awarding the CIB over the past two decades?” he said. The issue was brought to light in May after a CBS News [investigation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/troy-nehls-bronze-star-combat-infantryman-badge/) showed discrepancies between the congressman’s own representations of his military career and his records held by the Pentagon. Reviews of Nehls’ career conducted by the Army found two separate discrepancies. In addition to the revoked Combat Infantryman Badge the Army also [told](https://www.notus.org/house/army-confirms-troy-nehls-ineligible-combat-badge) CBS that Nehls’ records indicate he received only one Bronze Star medal, despite his claiming to have been awarded two. Nehls posted two certificates and two forms [on social media](https://x.com/RepTroyNehls/status/1787499600904876212) earlier this month. Bronze Stars are awarded to any individual based on any heroic achievement in a combat setting, whether they were serving in a combat or civilian role. Some of Nehl’s House Republican colleagues have since [criticized](https://www.notus.org/congress/troy-nehls-combat-infantry-badge-pin-revoked) him for his continued display of the badge, with fellow Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt of Houston, a former Army officer, telling a NOTUS reporter: “That’s ridiculous. That’s stolen valor.” Before being elected in 2020, Nehls was the sheriff of Fort Bend County. He is separately facing a [probe](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/03/26/troy-nehls-house-ethics-investigation-texas/) by a House ethics panel into [potential campaign finance violations](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/05/10/troy-nehls-texas-ethics-investigation-campaign-funds/). “ [U.S. Rep. Troy Nehls defends military record amid badge scandal](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/06/26/troy-nehls-army-combat-badge/)” was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.

    "title": "New year, new reasons for optimism on Hong Kong’s economy",
    "text": "In a report published earlier this month, Nomura said Hong Kong’s economy had been on a roller-coaster ride this year. No sooner did the reopening of the city’s borders with mainland China boost growth and asset prices than the rebound fizzled, undermined in part by the unexpectedly sharp slowdown in China’s economy.\nNomura said this “led to an anticlimactic conclusion to this highly anticipated recovery”, yet this is just one of many blows Hong Kong has suffered in the past six years as a succession of external and domestic shocks have hit the city hard. These crises have not just impeded recovery but have also sowed doubts about the underpinnings of Hong Kong’s role as a global financial centre.\nOne would be hard-pressed to find another major economy that is in a more disadvantageous position. Caught between the Scylla of China’s severe economic problems and the Charybdis of the US Federal Reserve’s most aggressive monetary tightening campaign in 40 years, the city has ended up with the worst of both worlds when the global economy is still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical and monetary policy risks are acute.\nThe outlook for Hong Kong remains uncertain due to a lack of consensus over the two big determinants of the performance of the city’s economy and asset prices: mainland China’s growth prospects and the scope for cuts in US interest rates.\nMaking the right call on Hong Kong means getting mainland China and the Fed right, a challenge that proved devilishly difficult for investors this year. However, barring new shocks, 2024 looks like the year when headwinds could turn into tailwinds.\nWhile scepticism is warranted given the frequency and intensity of shocks in Hong Kong since 2018, the confluence of a stabilisation of mainland China’s economy – in particular the bottoming out of the downturn in the crucial property sector – and the Fed’s shift towards less restrictive policy could serve as the catalyst for a marked improvement in sentiment.\nHSBC notes that “the risks are balanced for Hong Kong”. This is another way of saying that what poses a threat could also prove to be a boon.\nThe case for cautious optimism rests on a change in the narrative over the past few months, both in China and in the United States. Most investors are no longer debating how much worse things can get in China and whether the Fed is done raising rates. As 2023 draws to a close, the question is when will China’s housing market begin to stabilise and which month will the Fed start to ease policy.\nIn a report published on December 11, S&P Global Ratings said the mainland property sector “will enter the final stages of market clearing” next year, with top-tier cities leading the recovery as “policymakers continue to roll out stimulus”. JPMorgan says growth has become “a priority policy objective” and views plans to provide at least 1 trillion yuan (US$140.6 billion) of financing for the urban village renovation and affordable housing programmes as a potential “game-changer” for the sector.\nNomura, one of the most bearish voices on China, believes that at some point next year Beijing may be forced to “play the role of lender of last resort, funding major troubled developers to deliver unfinished pre-sold homes”, thereby “mark[ing] a real turning point for the economy”.\nThe narrative has changed more dramatically when it comes to the Fed. The US central bank’s abrupt shift in policy earlier this month has unleashed a wave of bullishness in markets. It “out-doved” markets by signalling that it would cut rates three times next year and suggested it did not want to fall behind the curve by keeping policy restrictive for too long.\nThat the Fed is now discussing the timing of a reduction in borrowing costs is hugely consequential for global asset prices, even though bond markets are pricing in too many rate cuts given the strength of the US labour market. There is now a clear path to looser monetary policy in the world’s most influential economy.\nIf both of these fillips materialise, they would provide the shot in the arm that Hong Kong – in particular its ailing real estate market – sorely needs. Even a more plausible scenario whereby Beijing is more stimulus-shy than Nomura expects but manages to stabilise the housing market, while the Fed only starts cutting rates in the second half of 2024, would help sentiment.\nStill, a more pessimistic view about Hong Kong cannot be dismissed. The bar for a meaningful and durable rally in mainland China remains high, while a policy mistake by the Fed poses significant risks. According to Bank of America’s latest global fund manager survey, selling Chinese stocks is still one of the most popular trades in markets despite Beijing’s more forceful attempts to stabilise the property sector.\nThe unpredictability of the policy and regulatory environment in mainland China, coupled with acute geopolitical tensions, weigh heavily on sentiment towards Hong Kong. These risks exacerbate concerns about tighter linkages between the city and the mainland. Earlier this month, ratings agency Moody’s warned that closer integration meant that “downside risks” for mainland China’s creditworthiness translated into downside risks for Hong Kong’s.\nHowever, positive spillovers are also possible, not just from China but also from US monetary policy. The outlook for Hong Kong remains challenging to say the least, but the city’s prospects look brighter as 2024 draws near.\nNicholas Spiro is a partner at Lauressa Advisory",

В Лос-Анджелесе не утихают протесты против миграционной политики Трампа.\nЕще до наступления комендантского часа конная полиция начала оттеснять толпу от центра города. В итоге столкновения продолжились уже за его пределами. Стычки, погромы, грабежи. Власти предупреждают: на мародерства будут отвечать жестко.\nНа улицах дежурит нацгвардия вместе с морпехами, которых направил президент Трамп.\nМэр Карен Басс, представитель демпартии, обрушилась на Вашингтон, мол, федеральные власти только ухудшают ситуацию и мешают местным полицейским.\nУ силовиков, как выяснилось, мнение противоположное. Британская Daily Mail получила доступ к закрытому чату калифорнийской полиции. От кого ждут удара в спину? Выяснилось — от городских властей и от продемократических СМИ.\n«Прогрессивные политики и группы «активистов», перед которым они преклоняются, связали руки полицейским и не дают им бороться с преступностью. Офицерам приказывают отступать, даже когда их забрасывают стеклянными бутылками, камнями и файерами. Очевидно, что нынешнее руководство ставит свой имидж выше безопасности полиции.\nОни показывают видео, где протестующий попал под лошадь. Но не показывают кадры, снятые непосредственно перед этим, когда он бросал коктейли Молотова. Это нечестно со стороны журналистов!\nПочему Карен Басс на командном пункте полиции, а не в мэрии? Это неслыханно. Она что, контролирует полицию Лос-Анджелеса? Это надо расследовать на федеральном уровне», — пишет Daily Mail.",

    "title": "Jermaine Jackson Accused of 1988 Sexual Assault in New Lawsuit",
    "text": "A woman has accused Jermaine Jackson , a founding member of the Jackson 5 and Michael Jackson’s older brother, of sexually assaulting her in 1988, according to a new lawsuit obtained by Rolling Stone.\nIn the brief suit, filed in Los Angeles on Wednesday, the plaintiff Rita Barrett alleges that Jackson assaulted her in her home over three decades ago after showing up to her house unannounced. Barrett claims in the suit that she met Jackson through her work as a music contractor, as well as through Motown Records founder Berry Gordy, alleging that she maintained close ties with Gordy through her husband, Ben Barrett.\n“Defendant Jackson forced himself into Plaintiff’s home, and with force and violence sexually assaulted Plaintiff,” the suit states. “During the assault, Plaintiff, a woman of faith prayed to God for help. During the assault, Plaintiff feared for her life. After the assault and when Defendant Jackson was satiated, he left the residence.”\nJackson, his companies Jermaine L. Jackson Music Productions and Work Records, were all listed as defendants in the suit, and the listed causes of action are sexual assault , battery, sexual battery, and negligence. Barrett asked for unspecified damages.\nA representative for Jackson couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.\n“Rita Barrett suffered an egregious and violent sexual assault,” Barrett’s attorney, Jeff Anderson, told Rolling Stone. “This is about her power and the declaration of it when she learned something could be done under the law, and she found the strength and support to find us and is now standing up for herself and others.”\nGordy himself wasn’t named as a defendant, but the suit claims that Gordy protected Jackson for financial interests. Barrett alleges that the day after the assault, she reported the incident to Gordy due to his relationship with both her and the Jackson family, stating that Gordy “was uniquely situated to both report Defendant Jackson’s acts and to aid plaintiff during her time of trauma.”\n“Instead,” the suit alleges, “Mr. Gordy withheld and concealed the acts, further perpetuating the coverup and allowing Mr. Gordy, Defendant Jackson, and others in the business relationship to continue to reap profits derived from Mr. Jackson’s work and reputation for years to come.” Trending Cher Files for Conservatorship of Son Elijah Blue Allman, Citing 'Severe' Substance Abuse Trump Demands MAGA Group Give Him ‘Millions.’ That’s Not Legal, Experts Say Watch Miley Cyrus Cover Journey's Hit '80s Anthem 'Faithfully' Kevin Hart Sues YouTuber Tasha K for Extortion\nA representative for Gordy did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone ‘s request for comment.\nThe suit was filed through California’s AB2777, which, like New York’s recently closed Adult Survivors Act, temporarily waives the statute of limitations on some civil claims related to sexual misconduct. Those statutes have led to a wave of sexual abuse lawsuits across the music and entertainment industries, with actors, artists, and executives, including Vin Diesel, Sean “Diddy” Combs , Axl Rose, and L.A. Reid, among several others, all facing allegations from suits filed in the past several months.",

Hay una resistencia de empresarios a esta normativa y advierten sobre el riesgo de despidos y recortes de beneficios.

    "title": "OutNebraska advocates for LGBTQ+ at NE Capitol, statewide | News | kmaland.com",
    "text": "(KMAland) -- With the start of the Nebraska Unicameral's 2024 session this week, guarding against the divisiveness experienced last session is top of mind for many. Bills limiting gender-affirming care for minors and restricting abortion rights led to an acrimonious 2023 session. Considerable support was shown for transgender youths and their families, however, in part because of the work of OutNebraska. The nonprofit's focus is supporting and \"uplifting the voices\" of LGBTQ+ Nebraskans. Abbi Swatsworth, executive director of the group, said advocacy is a core part of its mission and they will definitely have a \"presence\" at the Unicameral again this year. \"Because everyone deserves a voice in the policymaking process,\" Swatsworth pointed out. \"For so long there was very little representation of LGBTQ people in those spaces.\" In a [2022 survey](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/discrimination-and-barriers-to-well-being-the-state-of-the-lgbtqi-community-in-2022/) of LGBTQ+ adults by the Center for American Progress, half the respondents reported having experienced discrimination in the workplace related to their identity and a third reported discrimination involving housing over the previous year. Swatsworth noted for another of its missions, education, last year OutNebraska reached more than 1,400 people with educational sessions on ways to improve the workplace, including entities as varied as nonprofits, large banks and agricultural organizations. Unlike at least [twenty states](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/LGBT-ND-Protections-Update-Apr-2020.pdf), Nebraska has no statutes expressly prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. Swatsworth pointed out although OutNebraska does not provide legal representation, it is \"definitely about linkage to resources.\" \"We have assisted people with contacting the Nebraska Equal Opportunities Commission,\" Swatsworth outlined. \"Or perhaps reaching out to ACLU of Nebraska, or the Lincoln Human Rights Commission, or similar kinds of commissions in their municipal areas.\" Swatsworth explained supporting Nebraska Pride celebrations is a large part of another of OutNebraska's missions, celebration. She believes the growing number of them -- with twelve across the state in 2023 -- shows OutNebraska's advocacy and education are having an effect. \"I think just the fact that there is an organization making our presence known at the Capitol and in policy spaces really helps people feel seen,\" Swatsworth stressed. \"They can be more visible in their home community.\" No new anti-LGBTQ+ legislation has been introduced for the 2024 session. But a priority bill by Sen. Kathleen Kauth, R-Millard, [Legislative Bill 575](https://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=49722), would restrict transgender youths' participation in school sports and use of restroom facilities. Swatsworth added it is one of several bills carried over which have \"the potential to harm the LGBTQ+ community.\" OutNebraska's 2024 [LGBTQ+ Legislative Day](https://outnebraska.org/2024-legislative-day/) will be held Feb. 12.",
