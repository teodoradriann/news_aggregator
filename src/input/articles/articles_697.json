    "text": "TikTok is one of the most used social media apps in the United States of America. According to the TikTok CEO's statement in January 2024, the app has about 170 million monthly active users in the states.However, a recent update in the app's guidelines seems to have many upset with its policies and the future of budding creators on the app. In a decision to improve user experience, TikTok updated its guidelines to allow only five hashtags per post. “Hashtags help create and foster online communities, providing a sense of belonging among users with shared interests. Brands can use them to encourage user interaction and generate conversations,” it added.But users of the app are of the thought that the update could negatively affect their views and engagement, and thus took to social media to share their disappointment. Netizens react to the new TikTok update Image credits: XPeople who use the app as a source of life and income depend on their engagement and views. For them, limiting the number of hashtags seems to be directly related to limiting reach, and thus, they don't seem to be happy with the app's new update.\\\"IT SUCKS SO MUCH \\\"more efficient tagging for more views\\\" THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS I CAN TAG TO GET MY NORMAL REACH 💔💔💔\\",

    "text": "National Weather Service assessing whether storm in Anderson County was a tornado Following Wednesday night's storms, [Anderson Emergency Management](https://www.emd.andersonsheriff.org) received reports of downed trees and power lines in the area. Anderson Emergency Management and the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov) deployed teams Friday to assess the damage, assist residents, and determine whether a tornado had made landfall. \"We're on the hunt to confirm whether it was a tornado. So far, we have determined it was a possible spin-up that occurred and had a top speed of 75 miles per hour,\" said Clay Chaney, a National Weather Service meteorologist. He said this type of storm is rather significant, but it is not uncommon at this time of the year. \"Most of the damage occurred in the downtown Anderson, Clemson Boulevard area,\" Chaney said. Chaney surveyed an area near Belton-Honea Path High School Friday morning. \"We conducted windshield surveys to assess the damage in the area, taking note of any property damage to personal property and businesses,\" said Cade Treffeisen, deputy director of Emergency Management for Anderson County. According to Steve Wilkins with the National Weather Service, \"We saw scattered trees and structural damage to homes and businesses as we drove through the city of Anderson. \"We determined the damage was caused by a straight-line wind circulation that traveled north of Anderson. \"We will know if it was a tornado within a few hours,\" Wilkins said. According to a Duke Energy Map of power outages in the Upstate, Anderson County was the hardest hit, with 19,000 Duke customers without power as of Thursday morning. On Friday, Carolina Power helped restore power on North Street, which affected several homes near Linley Park. A fallen Oak tree was visible near the AnMed Health Services building on Calhoun Street in Anderson, a tree had fallen on a house on Shannon Way in Anderson, and a fallen tree was visible off State Highway 252 in Belton. Thursday morning in Honea Path A Honea Path homeowner in Anderson County recorded what appeared to be a possible tornado on Thursday morning. [Lori Dozier](https://www.facebook.com/lori.dozier.3) captured video and photos of what appeared to be a funnel cloud in Anderson County early Thursday morning as severe storms moved through the area. She posted the video and pictures on her social media accounts. At 2 a.m., she started recording the storm using her cell phone, pointing it toward the neighbor's home as the children woke up the rest of the family, which included Dozier's partner, father, and son. \"We witnessed a downdraft that caused our porch lights to swing back and forth and almost tip over,\" Dozier said in a previous article with the Independent-Mail. This is a breaking news story and will be updated. Travis Rose covers Anderson County for the Independent Mail. Reach him via email at [trose@gannett.com](mailto:trose@gannett.com).

Y ha añadido: \"No a la guerra, sí a la paz y al diálogo\" Reza también por las inundaciones de Brasil El papa Francisco también ha dedicado sus oraciones a las poblaciones del estado de Rio Grande do Sul de Brasil afectadas por las graves inundaciones de los últimos días. \"El Señor acoja a los difuntos y dé consuelo a sus familiares y a todos los que han tenido que abandonar sus hogares\", comentaba el papa. Las autoridades brasileñas han confirmado que las lluvias y desbordamientos de los ríos en el sur del país han causado inundaciones y al menos 56 fallecidos y un total de 74 desaparecidos. Otros 7 fallecimientos registrados en las zonas afectadas por las inundaciones podrían agregarse a la lista de víctimas, pero las autoridades todavía investigan si la causa de estas muertes está relacionada a las lluvias, según informó Defensa Civil. El estado más afectado es Rio Grande do Sul, fronterizo con Uruguay y Argentina, donde hay 55 muertos confirmados, mientras que en el vecino estado de Santa Catarina se ha registrado un fallecimiento. Un total de 82.566 personas han tenido que abandonar sus casas en Rio Grande do Sul, de los cuales 13.324 permanecen en albergues públicos.",

    "text": "Agricultural operations in Minnesota have been significantly impacted by recent severe weather including tornadoes, derecho winds, hail, lightning, and flooding. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has technical and financial assistance available to help farmers and livestock producers recover from these adverse weather events. Impacted producers should contact their local USDA Service Center to report losses and learn more about program options available to assist in their recovery from crop, land, infrastructure, and livestock losses and damages.\nUSDA Disaster Assistance\nProducers who experience livestock deaths in excess of normal mortality or sell injured livestock at a reduced price may be eligible for the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP). To participate in LIP, producers will have to provide acceptable documentation of death losses or evidence of reduced sales resulting from an eligible adverse weather event and must submit a notice of loss and program payment application to the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) no later than March 2, 2026, for 2025 calendar year losses. Livestock producers who experience losses related to tornadoes should check with their local FSA office for LIP eligibility criteria.\nMeanwhile, the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) provides eligible producers with compensation for feed and grazing losses. For ELAP, producers are required to complete a notice of loss and submit a payment application to their local FSA office no later than the annual program application deadline, March 2, 2026, for 2025 calendar year losses.\nAdditionally, eligible orchardists and nursery tree growers may be eligible for cost-share assistance through the Tree Assistance Program (TAP) to replant or rehabilitate eligible trees, bushes or vines. TAP complements the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) or crop insurance coverage, which covers the crop but not the plants or trees in all cases. For TAP, a program application must be filed within 90 days of the disaster event or the date when the loss of the trees, bushes or vines is apparent.\n“Impacted producers should timely report all crop, livestock and farm infrastructure damages and losses to their local FSA county office as soon as possible,” said Kurt Blomgren, State Executive Director for FSA in Minnesota. “As you evaluate your operation, take time to gather important documents you will need to get assistance, including farm records, herd inventory, receipts and pictures of damages or losses.”\nFSA also offers a variety of direct and guaranteed farm loans, including operating and emergency farm loans, to producers unable to secure commercial financing. Producers in counties with a primary or contiguous disaster designation may be eligible for low interest emergency loans to help them recover from production and physical losses. Loans can help producers replace essential property, purchase inputs like livestock, equipment, feed and seed, cover family living expenses or refinance farm-related debts and other needs.",
