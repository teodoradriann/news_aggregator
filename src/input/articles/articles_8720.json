    "title": "'He's crazier now': Debate could blow up Fox's effort to hide 'unhinged' Trump from voters",
    "text": "One major difference between the 2020 election and now is that the Fox networks isn't giving Donald\nTrump the time on its airwaves that it once did.\nFor years, Fox showed every moment of Trump rallies, but in the 2024 election, the network stopped.\nSpeaking to MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace, senior spokesperson Adrienne Elrod pointed out that it's\noften a topic of conversation on \"Deadline White House.\"\nOne question she said she hopes is asked is if Trump believes that Joe Biden is the president.\nALSO READ:\nTrump botched America’s pandemic response —but a 2nd term would be even more catastrophic\n\"That's going to be a major contrast moment for President Biden and Donald Trump,\" Elrod said. \"Donald Trump, if he passes any precedence here, he's going to make it clear he does not believe Joe Biden won the election. He's going to say that. That's going to be a major contrast moment. You talk a lot about how often we don't see Donald Trump. All the time. His rallies are not being aired on every single network.\"\nWallace chimed in that Fox refuses to air them. Her colleagues have pointed out that\nFox tends to cut from the rallies the second Trump says something they perceive could hurt him.\n\"Fox stopped airing them, prime example,\" Elrod agreed. \"We have to remind the American people what we're dealing with. The unhinged person.\"\nThe debate will display what other networks aren't showing, some have argued.\n\"By the way,\" Elrod also said. \"I don't have to tell you this; he's become more unhinged since he's been president. Something set him off. He's become more erratic.\"\nShe said that it is essentially the American people who see and understand the difference.\n\"This is somebody who was crazy before. He's crazier now, and that will be a major moment for President Biden. Not only to help make that contrast clear tonight, but also talk about how he's going to continue to deliver for the American people,\" she closed.\nSee the conversation below or at the link here.\nBiden campaign thinks Fox effort to hide Trump from voters can be destroyed with debate\nyoutu.be",

    "title": "Facing deportation or returning to El Salvador",
    "text": "Facing deportation or returning to El Salvador\nPreparing to return to El Salvador\nYou and your family may have to return to El Salvador, either voluntarily or due to deportation. If you face this possibility, plan ahead to make the process as simple and safe as possible for you and your family.\nBreathe. Know that your family and community are holding you in their thoughts and prayers and it is your own inner strength that will get you through this difficult transition. Take good care.\nBefore you leave the U.S.\nIf you have time:\n1. Contact the Salvadoran Consulate in Aurora, Colorado by phone at 720-485-5412 or online at\nhttp://consuladoaurora.rree.gob.sv to get passports for you and your family members and other information for reentry.\n2. Sign and give a Power of Attorney to someone you trust in the U.S. so that this person (your representative) can take care of your financial affairs for you after you leave.\n3. Take care of your finances. Sell or transfer your real estate. Use banks to transfer funds from the U.S. to El Salvador.\n4. Make arrangements for where you will go in El Salvador. Let your representative know how to contact you there.\n5. Finish your family preparedness plan\nhttp://coloradoimmigrant.org/preparados. Tell your Power of Attorney where it is. Keep all your documents safe.\n6. Avoid notarios!\n7. Children of Salvadoran parents born in the U.S. may have the right to dual citizenship. Check with the Salvadoran Consulate for application information. Minor U.S. citizen children traveling to El Salvador should have a U.S. passport and a notarized consent form from the other parent or legal guardian permitting their travel.\n8. Read the consulate website so you know what documents to bring.\n9. Collect other documents for you and all children, such as school records and/or diplomas (notarized by school registrar), immunization records, and U.S. birth certificates.\n10. Collect medical records; medications; marriage, divorce, and/or death certificates for every family member.\n11. If family members travel separately, make sure that you sign an authorization letter for the adult caregiver who will be travelling with your minor children.\n12. If a child will remain in the U.S. (even for a short time) in the care of a non-parent, sign a Power of Attorney authorizing the caregiver to care for your child.\nTip: Two last names (father’s last name, mother’s last name) may be required on all official documents. Be consistent in providing names.\nTip: Get more than one original birth certificate for each child because you may need them.\nWarning: Keep in mind buying fake Salvadoran birth certificates can jeopardize your child’s dual citizenship.\nImmediate deportation\n- Consider using the emergency notification app called Notifica to keep your family informed and aware. Many people use WhatsApp to communicate internationally (you need Wifi to use it).\n- While in GEO ICE Processing Center in Aurora, Colorado:\n- Family/friends may visit you if they have a valid passport or unmarked license. They should call GEO (303-361-6612) to get your visiting days and hours and instructions for visiting.\n- Family/friends can put money on your phone account at\nwww.talton.comor 1-866-348-6231 using the detainee’s A#.\n- Leaving GEO in Aurora, Colorado:\n- You have the right to retrieve any clothing or possessions that you entered GEO with, such as your wallet, credit cards, and phone. Family/friends can also bring you “one of everything,” i.e. one pair of pants, underwear, bra, socks, shoes, one short-sleeve shirt, one long-sleeve shirt, coat, gloves, and hat.\n- If you have medicine approved and given by a GEO doctor, you can take it with you. This includes insulin and inhalers. If you can bring a written prescription from a doctor, that can be helpful.\n- If you can bring a credit card or between $200 to $500 in small bills, it will be helpful. Put the money in different pockets on your person, not in your bag. If you have money on account from the commissary, phone, or work, you will be given up to $500 in cash. If you have more than $500, you will receive a check, which can be hard to cash later.\n- Detainees are not given much advance notice of their departure date to avoid “incidents” during transport.\nNOTE: This is how it is supposed to happen, but be prepared that you may not be able to bring all of these things.\nWHAT TO BRING WITH YOU\nThe following items can often be brought by family/friends to GEO. They must bring a photo ID to drop off items:\n- Phone numbers for friends or family, both in El Salvador and in the U.S. (You should memorize them before leaving the U.S.).\n- Phone card, phone charger, and a backup phone battery.\n- Have an address in El Salvador. Many forms and job applications often ask for an address. Get an address of a family member that you can use.\n- Medications and written prescriptions in your name, such as insulin; what you need to keep it cool; inhalers. If you are diabetic, you may be able to bring a PowerBar or something similar.\n- Driver’s license or ID from any Salvadoran city or institution, like a DUI voting card.\nWhat to expect from ICE transport\n- If you have an ankle monitor, you may have to get it removed prior to departure.\n- You may be handcuffed and shackled at the ankles during transit.\n- Your possessions may not be intact or returned to you at all.\n- You may travel by bus to Florence, Arizona or another location in the U.S. and then be put on a plane to El Salvador. You will be taken by bus into San Salvador for processing.\n- You may experience dehumanizing behavior from ICE officials. If you can remember their name or get their badge number, it could be helpful in the future or for others.*\n*ICE does not respect your human dignity, but we do. Others you will find in El Salvador through this list will also treat you well and support you as much as they can.\nWhen you arrive in El Salvador\nGeneral Cautions:\n- To stay safe, make a friend on the bus or plane. Stay together to support each other.\n- Be alert and calm. Blend in and comply with authority.\n- Avoid casual street encounters, including eye contact.\n- Don’t look vulnerable, but also don’t look cocky.\n- Beware of criminal elements. Don’t use an offered cell phone to call your family. Create a “palabra clave” or code word with family members in case someone calls asking for ransom. You should decide what you want your family to do if you are speaking to them under duress.\n- Keep contact information for your family in El Salvador (and all documents that prove your identity and deportation status) on you, not in your bag.\nCautions for El Salvador\n- The Directorate of Assistance to the Migrant (DAMI) is next to an area known as \"La Chacra\" gang domain.\n- If you do not know the area, ask in the DAMI for help with transport, directions, etc.\n- Beware of possible coyotes or scammers who may be outside of the DAMI. They may offer untrustworthy trips or fake accommodations for those waiting until the next day to return to their homes in El Salvador.\n- Avoid using certain words that currently people relate to gangs: “mara,” “homeboy,” “jaina,” “brother,” “madre,” “carnal,” “doggie.”\n- If you bring your own shoes, avoid wearing Nike Cortez, and adidas (white with three stripes).\n- Avoid clothing and shoes with the following numbers: 13, 18, and 503 ES. Do not mention these numbers in conversation.\nRepatriation\nPeople are transported to El Salvador from several detention centers in the U.S. Those deported from Denver generally depart on flights from Florence, Arizona. There are usually 110 people on these flights, which arrive in El Salvador in the afternoon. Their wrists and ankles are shackled until about 10 minutes before they land. All deportees are flown to Oscar Arnulfo Romero International Airport, located in San Luis Talpa, department of La Paz, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from San Salvador. Food, consisting of two pupusas and a soda, is provided upon arrival.\nFrom the Oscar Arnulfo Romero International Airport, returnees are transported to the Directorate of Assistance to Migrants (DAMI) in San Salvador:\nServices: Verification, reception, and assistance for Salvadorans returned by land and air.\nHours: Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m. (according to service needs).\nAddress: Final Bulevar Cnel. Arturo Castellanos, Colonia Quiñonez, (La Chacra), San Salvador (behind the workshops of the National Civil Police - PNC).\nPhone: (503) 2133-7900\nThere is a nine-step process at DAMI. (This procedure is not always followed as described.)\n1. Interview with the General Directorate of Migration and Aliens (DGME). Interviews last about three hours and include:\n- Name, gender, age\n- Reason they migrated to U.S.\n- Length of time in U.S.\n- Where they lived and worked\n- If they have family still living in U.S.\n- If they experienced abuse during process of deportation\n- Contact information in El Salvador, if available\nIn some cases, when the person is detained in the U.S., their belongings are held, listed, and kept in a storage room until the date of the deportation. These belongings are sent in the same airplane as the deportees. Once the person arrives in El Salvador, they can request the items during this step of the interview process.\n2. Interview with the National Civil Police\nNational Civil Police review individuals’ criminal and police records. They also take complaints of an act constituting a crime that is linked to why they left El Salvador for the U.S.\n3. Medical consultation with the Ministry of Health\nReturnees receive a general health check and a physical and psychological health diagnosis. They will get a referral to a health center near their home in the country for follow-up.\n4. Provision of basic resources\nReturnees get help with immediate needs to make a dignified return to their homes in El Salvador. That includes belts, shoes, shirts, pants, pampers, etc.\n5. Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MRREE)\nPeople can ask the MRREE to get information on how to contact their relatives abroad and the possibilities of reunification in El Salvador.\nTo get advice on how to claim property and acquired rights (for example, social benefits), they may have to contact the Human Rights Directorate of the Vice Minister for Salvadorans Abroad of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at:\nReintegration Program for Returned Migrants\nGeneral Directorate of Human Rights\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\nEl Pedregal Street, Blvd. Cancillería. Ciudad Merliot, Antiguo Cuscatlán, El Salvador\nTel. (503) 22311184, Fax (503) 22311152\n6. National Council for Children and Adolescents (CONNA)\nWhen a child/adolescent is returned alone or accompanied by an adult, they are interviewed to ensure their best interests and determine whether the child/adolescent experienced abuse prior to leaving El Salvador. This information is provided to the Protection Board of the child’s home department.\n7. Telephone and internet access/transportation assistance\nAt the DMGE, returnees can use telephones to make national and international calls. Internet access is also available.\nReturnees can get financial help for interdepartmental transportation according to the fares established by the DGME.\n8. Employment assistance\nThe MRREE and the Ministry of Labor have a bulletin board with job offers. They also have a phone number to get information about job openings. If no jobs are available, people can leave their phone number to be contacted once there are openings.\n9. Reunions\nAdult returnees, if detained, can communicate with their relatives and wait for them in a waiting room.\nFor unaccompanied children, the consulate abroad gives notice to the Human Rights Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This office passes the information to the National Council for Children and Adolescents and in turn to the Child Protection Councils and Adolescence of the town of the child to give notice of the child’s deportation to their relatives.\nOnly children accompanied by their father, mother, or legal guardians can leave the DMGE without this step. However, the child’s birth certificate and the father/mother’s identity document(s) or the legal guardian’s authorization document must be provided.\nSHELTER ASSISTANCE\nThe Migrant Assistance Center (CAIM) can provide shelter for returnees, if it is verified that bus service is not available or that the returnee does not have economic resources or family in San Salvador with whom to spend the night.\nNonprofit organizations providing assistance\nSalvadoran Migrant Institute (INSAMI)\n41 Avenida Norte No. 221, Colonia Flor Blanca, San Salvador\n(503) 2207 2331\nContact: Cesar Rios, Director\nhttps://bit.ly/2Pp8UcX\nServices: medical attention, psychosocial attention, orientation for employment opportunities\nHouse of the Migrant of the Missionaries of San Carlos Scalabrini\n6° Avenida Norte y Pasaje Viaud, Colonia Magaña, San Salvador\n(503) 2221 9725\nContact: Brother Edgar Vallecillo\nService: Shelter (A new Center for Migrants is being built to support its programs and services.)\nUnited States Committee of Refugee and Immigration (USCRI)\nColonia San Francisco, Calle los Bambués y Calle los Abetos, # 37-A y B, San Salvador\n(503) 2526-9219\nContact: Eunice Olán, Coordinator\nhttp://refugees.org/field-office/central-america/\nServices:\n- Orientation to current realities of Salvadoran communities—how to access medical and mental health care; how to obtain basic shelter, food and clothing; and how to look for jobs.\n- Legal representation for complex legal situations as well as help for submitting forms and presenting cases.",

    "text": "L’ultimo mese è stato il più difficile per gli ucraini. Lo ha affermato ieri Oleksandr Shtupun, un portavoce dell’esercito di Zelensky, commentando gli ultimi sviluppi sul campo. La Russia avanza a piccoli passi, riconquista terreno a Sud e a Est, mentre all’Ucraina sta per arrivare l’ultimo pacchetto di aiuti approvato dal Congresso a Washington. I russi avanzano a piccoli passi (mentre arriva l’ultimo pacchetto Usa per Kiev) Il punto militare 617 | I progressi russi sono minimi e hanno un costo umano altissimo, ma la pressione dell’Armata impedisce agli ucraini di ruotare le unità sfiancate da mesi di combattimenti Dopo settimane di stallo, negli ultimi giorni le truppe di Putin hanno compiuto progressi attorno alla cittadina meridionale di Robotyne, che gli ucraini avevano ripreso durante la controffensiva estiva, e a Marinka, nel Donbass, difesa per mesi dalla resistenza: nel primo caso l’Armata ha riconquistato qualche chilometro quadrato; nel secondo gli ucraini sono stati costretti a ritirarsi su posizioni più difendili. I progressi russi sono minimi e hanno un costo umano altissimo, ma la pressione dell’Armata, sostiene Jack Waitling, analista dell’Istituto Rusi, impedisce a Kiev di ruotare le unità sfiancate da mesi di combattimenti. Alle difficoltà sul campo si aggiungono per gli ucraini le preoccupazioni sulle forniture americane, vitali per sostenere i combattimenti ma tenute in ostaggio dai repubblicani in Congresso. Il nuovo pacchetto da 250 milioni di dollari annunciato mercoledì comprende equipaggiamento per la difesa aerea, sistemi anticarro, munizioni d’artiglieria e per armi più piccole, ma probabilmente sarà l’ultimo in arrivo da Washington, dove le trattative sono in stallo. Gli sviluppi diplomatici e militari sono stati commentati a Mosca anche dal ministro degli Esteri russo Sergei Lavrov, per il quale «l’Occidente sta cambiando tattica e forse sta anche pensando di modificare la sua strategia, perché il suo piano ha subito un clamoroso fallimento. Mosca — ha affermato — è diventata più forte nell’ultimo anno, mentre cerca di raggiungere i suoi obiettivi con operazioni militari». - [22 dicembre 2023 - L’attentato a Prigozhin fu autorizzato da Nikolai Patrushev, il più fidato consigliere di Putin](https://www.corriere.it/esteri/23_dicembre_22/attentato-prigozhin-fu-autorizzato-nikolai-patrushev-piu-fidato-consigliere-putin-d6a067a0-a0fe-11ee-8a50-aa124a9df6fa.shtml?refresh_ce) -

    "title": "He's strengthening Long Beach's community faith | Herald Community Newspapers | liherald.com",
    "text": "The Rev. Brian Barr’s early foundation in faith was nurtured by his father, a New York City firefighter turned federal investigator, and a stay-at-home mother who emphasized living in the world as it was while upholding Catholic values. “Church was important to my parents,” Bar said. “Priests, the priesthood, was very much seen as an honorable option for a person in life. So I was lucky — nobody forced me to become a priest. But I knew just from the values of my parents that priests were important, and that they mattered, and they could potentially make a difference.” In honor of the difference he has made in Long Beach, the Herald is proud to name Barr, the spiritual leader of three Catholic churches on the barrier island collectively known as Beach Catholic, its 2023 Person of the Year. Barr, 58, a native of Floral Park, Queens, and one of four siblings, earned a degree in industrial and labor relations from Cornell University in 1987, and was ordained to the priesthood in 1993 by Bishop John McGann, of the Diocese of Rockville Centre. Barr’s diverse experiences shaped the man he is today. Before he came to St. Mary of the Isle Catholic Church in Long Beach, he served as a parish priest at St. Thomas the Apostle in West Hempstead, as a chaplain at St. Anthony’s High School in South Huntington, and as the director of campus ministry at both Adelphi and Hofstra universities. Arriving in Long Beach 11 years ago, Barr faced the challenges of Hurricane Sandy just 10 days later. “It was kind of a wild entry,” he recalls. “I became a pastor at St. Mary’s, and still am. And then about seven years later, I also became pastor at Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal, in Point Lookout. And then a year after that, which is about three and a half years ago, St. Ignatius,” he added, referring to St. Ignatius Martyr Catholic Church. “So now I’m a pastor of all three.” His transition to Long Beach was influenced by the departure of the spiritual leader at St. Mary’s, Bishop Robert Brennan. Eventually, Beach Catholic, an amalgamation of St. Mary’s, Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal, and St. Ignatius, emerged as a collaborative effort to navigate the challenges of coordinating schedules and services across three parishes. Barr emphasizes the team-driven nature of the collective’s success, acknowledging the dedicated staff and their commitment to service. “We have a great relationship. He’s the best boss I’ve ever had,” Gerri Maquet, the parishes’ director of religious education, said of Barr. “The reason why he’s a great leader is because he elevates his team. He gives us enough room to do what we need to do — he trusts us. He puts a lot of trust into the Beach Catholic team, and a lot of faith in us, and because of that we’re able to get things done.” A highlight of Barr’s accomplishments at Beach Catholic is the creation of Beach Mass toward the end of the coronavirus lockdown, an initiative born from the desire to bring the Eucharist to the people in a unique setting — the beach. “Could we find a way to bring what’s most important to us — mainly, the Eucharist, and community — bringing that to where the people are, as opposed to having the people just come to us?” Barr said of his thinking at the time. The initiative started small, on the Monroe Boulevard beach, but rapidly gained popularity, attracting people from various communities and creating a powerful sense of community and worship. Now it draws hundreds during the summer months on rotating beaches each Sunday. “You feel the power of community, getting 800 people on their knees praying at the same time — where do you get something like that?” Barr said. “We get stories and notes and letters every year, people saying things like, I was riding my bike on the boardwalk, I was going to go for a walk or a run, I saw this crowd of people, and I just kind of was curious. And they stuck around. And just kept coming.” Reflecting on the challenges posed by the pandemic, Barr highlighted the creative approaches adopted by Beach Catholic. Online and outdoor Masses, including a memorable Christmas Eve Mass with a Jumbotron, showcased the community’s resilience and adaptability. With fewer priests available, Barr explained, adaptations had to be made to mass schedules and ministries, and coordination became crucial to meet the challenge of providing essential services while preserving the unique history and identity of the Catholic Church. “If I were to go back in any of these churches 11 years ago, the pews weren’t as full,” Maquet said. “The occupancy wasn’t at its fullest, and even during Covid, when people weren’t in the churches, Father Brian found a way. He had brought on amazing young men who were very tech-savvy. He’s who kept us afloat.” Barr spends a great deal of time visiting people dealing with illnesses in nearby hospitals. Even if it’s a quick pop-in, he tries to notice everybody, regardless of their religious beliefs, and make them feel seen. “He’s a soft-spoken man, and he’s not gregarious,” Alice Jones, a nurse at Mount Sinai South Nassau, said. “He seems to be a very good listener, which I think lacks in a lot of people. Obviously, not everybody’s the same religion, but even if it’s just a ‘hello, how are you, my name is Father Brian and I’m doing some rounds today,’ he visits the patients. His whole team seems to be this way.” Looking ahead, Barr emphasizes his commitment to evangelizing, and the importance of giving people spiritual guidance. He sees Long Beach Catholic Regional School, which has a close association with St. Ignatius, as a response to the secular challenges faced by families, where Catholic principles can be instilled in children. “Having a healthy understanding of being an evangelist is pointing people to Jesus, leading people by what we do, by what we say, by our example — discovering, and coming to know more, the person of Jesus Christ,” he said. “And that’s the job of the church. That’s a never-ending job.” Barr credits the success of the three-church Beach Catholic to its dedicated leadership team, and emphasizes that its achievements are a collective effort. His gratitude extends to the community for embracing the changes and challenges, and creating a vibrant and welcoming union of churches in the heart of Long Beach. “I'm the pastor, so I kind of get the credit for it,” he said. “I know this sounds like a cliché, but it’s all team-driven, from religious people in the school, the people who do communications, to the music, technology — all of these are slices to the pie.” Barr’s pastoral leadership helps a resilient community continue to unite while navigating the complexities of modern life and staying true to their faith.

    "text": "Liga MX LigaMX Gago no le tenía confianza y ahora será el sustituto de Chiquete en Chivas: Ni Pollo, ni Olivas El Rebaño tendrá que buscar al jugador ideal para que ocupe un lugar que ha defendido con gallardía el zaguero lesionado.\nLa traición del canterano de Chivas que siempre tuvo el sueño de jugar en América Fernando González lanza mensaje contundente sobre Chicharito Hernández en Chivas Por Aldo Miranda\n25/07/2024 - 14:59hs CST\nwhatsapp 25/07/2024 - 14:59hs CST\n© Imago7 Gago tuvo que tomar una medida emergente. Por Aldo Miranda\nEn el futbol los momentos son los que pueden hacer la diferencia entre ganarse un lugar o perderse para siempre y el técnico de las Chivas de Guadalajara , Fernando Gago sabe perfectamente que debe aprovechar al máximo el buen momento de sus jugadores , sobretodo cuando requiere un sustituto que cumpla con las expectativas una vez perdió a Gilberto Orozco Chiquete por lesión muscular.\nLa mala noticia para el Rebaño Sagrado es que su mejor defensor, Orozco Chiquete estará fuera de las canchas de siete a ocho semanas, lo cual obligó a Gago a buscar entre sus opciones al mejor para cumplir con una función básica en su esquema , pues cabe recordar que Chivas suma tres partidos sin recibir gol en lo que va del Apertura 2024.\nLos futbolistas que se tenían en mente eran Antonio Briseño , José Castillo o el juvenil Leonardo Sepúlveda, incluso algunos colocaban a Luis Olivas con la oportunidad de pelear por un lugar, sin embargo reportes recientes indican que ninguno de ellos es quien le ha llenado el ojo al estratega, sino un mediocampista.\nFernando González ocupará el lugar de Chiquete en Chivas Será precisamente el Oso González quien ocupe la zaga central junto con G ilberto Sepúlveda en los siguientes partidos, pues al timonel de Guadalajara le agradó el funcionamiento que tuvo el sábado anterior contra Mazatlán , justo cuando ocupó la posición con la salida del Chiquete en la primera parte.\nEl Oso quiere ganarse la titularidad. (Foto: Jaime Lopez/JAM MEDIA) Así lo dio a conocer el periodista Jesús Bernal en su canal de YouTube: “El jugador que le ha gustado a Fernando Gago es Rubén el Oso González, una sorpresa porque el futbolista siempre lo hemos conocido como contención , al menos en Chivas, haciendo la función como tal de arranque no lo había visto (de central), sí como un tercer central. Pero tal parece que a Fernando Gago le ha convencido, al grado de que está por encima del Pollo Briseño, de Olivas y de Leo Sepúlveda, incluso de José Castillo que también puede jugar en esa posición”.\nver también\nConfirmado: El primer partido de Chivas por la señal de Amazon Prime en el Apertura 2024\n“Que bueno por el Oso porque ahí podría tener su sitio, así lo hizo contra Mazatlán y no lo hizo mal, por el contrario fue muy bueno. Simplemente debe replicar simplemente y sencillamente lo que ya logró en su momento, el encargado de tomar ese sitio será Rubén el Oso González. Ojo con Chiquete que depende de la evolución, puede ser de seis a ocho semanas, esta es la semana uno”, fue parte de lo que comentó el comunicador.\nAldo Miranda Periodista de Rebaño Pasión desde el 2021.

    "text": "La Fondation humanitaire de Gaza (GHF), soutenue par Washington et Israël, a affirmé qu’au moins cinq de ses employés palestiniens avaient été tués, dans la nuit de mercredi à jeudi, dans une attaque du Hamas, après un nouvel épisode meurtrier en marge de ses opérations.\nAlors que le territoire palestinien traverse une grave crise humanitaire après 20 mois d’une guerre dévastatrice, déclenchée par l’attaque du Hamas le 7 octobre 2023 en Israël, la Défense civile de Gaza a annoncé que les forces israéliennes avaient ouvert le feu mercredi matin sur des personnes allant chercher de l’aide humanitaire, faisant 31 morts et environ 200 blessés.\nQuelques heures plus tard, la GHF a dénoncé une « attaque odieuse et délibérée » visant ses activités.\n« Cette nuit, vers 22 h heure de Gaza (19 h GMT), un bus transportant plus d’une vingtaine de membres de l’équipe de la Fondation humanitaire de Gaza (…) a été violemment attaqué par le Hamas », a déclaré l’organisation dans un communiqué, précisant que les employés présents dans le véhicule étaient tous palestiniens.\n« Nous sommes encore en train de faire le point, mais ce que nous savons est terrible : il y a au moins cinq morts, plusieurs blessés, et nous craignons que certains membres de notre équipe aient été pris en otage », a-t-elle déploré.\nLa GHF est déployée depuis fin mai dans le territoire palestinien, où elle affirme avoir distribué plus d’un million de repas.\nUne série d’événements chaotiques et meurtriers se sont produits ces derniers jours à proximité des sites de l’organisation au financement opaque soutenue par les États-Unis et Israël, avec laquelle l’ONU refuse de travailler en raison de préoccupations concernant ses procédés et sa neutralité\nDans la nuit de mercredi à jeudi, des milliers de Palestiniens s’étaient rassemblés dans l’espoir d’atteindre un centre de distribution de la GHF près du carrefour des Martyrs appelé Netzarim par les Israéliens,\n« Des chars israéliens ont tiré à plusieurs reprises, puis vers 5 h 30 (2 h 30 GMT), ils ont intensifié leurs tirs et en même temps il y avait des tirs nourris de drones visant les civils », a déclaré à l’AFP le porte-parole de la Défense civile, Mahmoud Bassal.\n« Nous avons transporté au moins 31 martyrs et environ 200 blessés à la suite de tirs de chars et de drones israéliens sur des milliers de citoyens », a-t-il ajouté.\nCompte tenu des restrictions imposées aux médias dans la bande de Gaza et des difficultés d’accès sur le terrain, l’AFP n’est pas en mesure de vérifier de manière indépendante les bilans annoncés par la Défense civile.",
