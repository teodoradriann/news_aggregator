    "text": "It’s Christmas Morning. I love this morning. The world is always quiet when I wake up. The tree is decorated, the music is on, prepping for Christmas brunch, and getting ready to head to the kids for the afternoon.\nIt is a day when you feel peace. I always want to bottle it up and shake it out a little bit at a time daily until next Christmas. People look at others differently at Christmas, they aren’t as judgmental and even more there is a clearer understanding that perhaps the poor among us are perhaps the catalyst for a much larger story to be played out: they are the reason for the season.\nAs a provider to the poor, I see that clearly as our families get adopted, as shoe stores give away new shoes, as food is dispensed gleefully through volunteers all over the country. It is probably what was intended to happen all year long. Somehow that got lost a little as we handed that responsibility off to agencies and people who helped those in need.\nMy Dad always read the Christmas Story at the party they hosted on the Saturday before Christmas. With that story those who attended were reminded of their charge and seemed to take it to heart, at least for a little while. The Deacons would deliver food boxes to those in need from the church and my dad would dress up like Santa or Pastor Henson would and toys would be given to the families in need at the church. My mom was a stickler that no child should wake up without a present.\nMaybe that is the biggest gift of all about Christmas. The world is kinder and full of stillness for just a few days. Peace on Earth is more of a reality for a short while every year. Wouldn’t it be nice to just declare it so all year long? Living together in harmony is an old Hippie ideology and I guess I have lived long enough to wear that badge proudly now, but I really believe with our vast knowledge and strong desire to prosper and grow, we can include in that dream a vision of peace and acceptance.\nDaily I work with those that people help through housing, food, emergencies in the family, medical crisis, and legal problems, there is no shortage of people. There is sometimes a shortage of compassion. Not daily. Most of the time people are empathetic and they want to help but occasionally you hear “as long as they do right with it,” or “I hope they don’t sell those groceries,” or even “why did she have all those babies anyway.” It isn’t easy to hear, it is even harder to process.\nI got my plain-spoken manners from my Dad, my Mom was the diplomat. While they didn’t have a lot, they did well with what they had, we gardened and canned our food. Dad had chickens and we always had eggs, and he worked full time and pastored as well. He always said: “you do what you have to, it is called getting by.” And so, we do.\nThose I serve do the same, and with grace. There are very few who are difficult really. That can be explained by acknowledging their fear. My dad also always said “it is harder to ask than to help”.\nHe understood how difficult it was to say I need you to a stranger. Funny, this is the time when we celebrate the birth of one who was sent to teach us how to help strangers and how to be a good neighbor.\nSo, in that as we settled into our Christmas brunch with some of our friends and prepared to go to our children’s home for gifts, we kept all of you in our thoughts. Peace, and I hope your Christmas has been wonderful.",

    "title": "STEVENS COLUMN: Health care debacle",
    "text": "What a terrible way to begin a serious discussion of the horrendous level of health care in the United States. Apparently a young man deeply disgruntled with a health care issue allegedly killed a top health insurance executive. We have arguably the worst health delivery system in the industrialized world, but bullets are the answer to nothing.\nThere is little wonder that our level of longevity is sliding backward as other countries’ level inches forward into longer lives. Russia’s average age of death is also declining, but the reason there is thought to be the high level of vodka consumption.\nIn America our overall spiking of obesity is obviously a contributing factor. However, we never seem to look at how much the private health insurance industry should be sharing its own guilt. Some other countries that have national programs include private insurance companies, but always heavily regulated and in a minor role to the national program itself.\nToday the U.S. federal program is mainly confined to those over 65 years of age (Medicare) and families under certain income levels (Medicaid). Obamacare is an odd combination of federal subsidy and private medical delivery for those people who are not within a large company that provides health insurance policies.\nFor those over 65 years of age there are two types of insurance coverage: 1. traditional Medicare that is paid mainly from lifelong FICA subtractions from paychecks; and 2. Medicare Advantage, delivered by such companies as United Health Care, formerlyrun by the assassinated man in New York City this month. This name of Medicare Advantage is an unfortunate choice because it is not Medicare and with its constant denials of both requested medical treatments and the claims after treatments. Its advantage is on paper in its breadth of coverage and lower premiums. Its only connection to Medicare is that the money given to the insurance companies comes from the same pot as traditional Medicare uses.\nIt should be noted that a medical insurance company makes its money by DENYING claims. The more denials the more profits. Insurance companies hire thousands of doctors, nurses, and non-medical people to pore over claims and the requests for pre-authorized treatments. This heavy overload of deniers plus the mammoth advertising load each fall plus the eye-popping salaries of its executives are the main reasons why private insurance companies have up to five times more overhead than the huge traditional nonprofit Medicare program.\nWhat? The government-run program costs less to run than that by the private corporations? Yes, by a long shot.\nBut what about the socialistic nature of Medicare? Shouldn’t we resist another advancement toward socialism? For one thing it is not socialized medicine. The medical system stays as is because Medicare is merely an insurance program. You keep your own doctors and hospitals. In fact, you can you use any one you want, unlike the Medicare Advantage programs which direct you to their more narrow network of providers.\nIf you want to see socialized medicine, look at Britain’s. The doctors and hospitals all work for the national government and the drug prices are severely held in check. (The U.S. VA care for veterans is a British-style socialized program.) Canada’s Medicare-For-All program covers every one, but the doctors are still private. One time on a vacation up north I took an informal poll by asking everyone I met at gas stations, restaurants, on the street and to a person they loved their Medicare for all ages. They just wanted to see it funded more adequately so that some waiting times for non-emergencies would become shorter.\nAbout 20 years ago I was among a handful of people who slept in on the marble floors of Louisville’s Humana company in an attempt to block the doors from incoming workers. It didn’t work because we missed one doorway but we were heartened when many of the Humana employees gave us a quick vee for victory sign for our Single Payer Healthcare message as they slipped into work.\nOur protest didn’t work. We didn’t even get arrested and our bid for more media publicity failed.\nWhat an irony to see an alleged murderer today spark talk from people disgruntled by our dismal health delivery system in this country. (Have you noticed that our television shows the past two months were smothered by Humana commercials for Medicare Advantage? Where were the other big insurance companies? Could it be that they carved up the country into private sectors of coverage just like any self-respecting cartel would do? Competition had magically disappeared.)\nWhat we can do at this stage is to get more informed. My way is to see what PNHP is saying about the situation. Just Google it. That’s Physicians for a National Healthcare Program. There is even an affiliate in Louisville called Kentucky Single Payer Healthcare. Try that website.\nWe deserve better and we can do without violence. I am ashamed that we are the only industrialized nation without universal health care and we have the dead bodies to prove it.",

    "text": "Steel unions call on government to secure future of Scunthorpe Steel\nThe Chinese owners of British Steel are launching a consultation on closing the blast furnaces in Scunthorpe\nLast updated 49 minutes ago\nUnions are calling on the government to secure the future of steelmaking in Northern Lincolnshire, following the news that British Steel's owner is launching a fresh consultation on closing Scunthorpe's blast furnaces.\nJingye, who operate British Steel, will launch their consultation in June, or at a later date, should an agreement with the UK government be reached.\nScunthorpe steelworks is the UK's last remaining primary steelmaking facility, and employs thousands of people directly and through extensive supply chains throughout the UK.\nA statement on behalf of Jingye says since 2020, they have invested more than £1.2 bn to maintain operations at British Steel, amid ongoing production instability and significant financial losses of around £700k a day.\nInvestments to date include over £300m in strategic capital projects such as a state-of-the-art mast service centre in Skinningrove, a rail stocking facility and a new billet caster.\nDespite this, the blast furnaces and steelmaking operations are no longer financially sustainable due to highly challenging market conditions, the imposition of tariffs, and higher environmental costs relating to the production of high-carbon steel.\nSteel unions Community, GMB and Unite are coming together to call on the government for support.\nCommunity General Secretary Roy Rickhuss CBE said:\n\"This is a dark day for our steel industry and for our country. We urge Jingye and the UK Government to get back around the table to resume negotiations before it is too late.\"\n\"Cruciallly, Jingye have not ruled out retaining the blast furnaces during a transition to low carbon steelmaking if they can secure the backing of the Government.\"\n\"If the government chooses to let Scunthorpe die it would make a mockery of their grand ambitions to deliver growth through massive infrastructure investment, because British Steel is our only steelmaker than can produce the construction steels the country needs for our roads, railways, schools and hospitals.\"\nLinda McCulloch, National Officer for Unite the Union, said:\n\"This is devastating news and there is now a duty on the Government to do everything it can to prevent a catastrophic outcome. As the last primary steelmaking facility in the UK, Scunthorpe is a vital strategic asset which we cannot afford to lose.\"\nCharlotte Brumpton-Childs, GMB National Officer, said:\n“This is devastating news for the people of Scunthorpe and the whole of UK steelmaking.\n“But it’s not too late: we urge Jingye and the government to do everything in their power to save this vital domestic industry.”\nHear the latest news from across the UK every hour, on Jazz FM on DAB, smartspeaker, and on the Rayo app",

    "text": "Tina Rothery was campaigning as a Green Party candidate in the recreated Blackpool North and Fleetwood in the 2024 general election . She came fourth – beating the Lib Dems .\nDescribing the current political system in Britain previously to the Canary , she said :\nIt’s a class system… I’ve lived in places where there was… different levels of existence and poverty but never seen a class system like it is here. Never. Not like this.\nAnd in a post just as the campaign was coming to a close, she spoke about receiving emails from:\npeople in pain, people fighting injustice, people who just want a bloody dentist or for the operation they need to end their crippling agony. The emails come from people who genuinely give a damn about others too and about animals and nature and veterans… about clean water and most of all… some dignity and a reprieve from all this sadness around us.\nThe news and party propaganda is devoid of this deeply human side to ELECTION TIME. It’s all about promises and pretense and claiming glory for deeds they claim they will do or had some hand in. And yet… we look around and it’s the Postmasters, Hillsborough families and Grenfell victims standing for justice… the surfers against sewage, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and dedicated activists standing for the environment… it’s the Unions and workers that are doing what needs to be done to get a fair deal and conditions at work and it’s the foodbank volunteers, teachers, nurses and doctors picking up the broken pieces in the fight for a chance in life in this deeply flawed democracy. I’m relieved this campaign is over – because it’s hard to not feel all this.\nSpeaking to the Canary on election day, meanwhile, she described how a key highlight of the campaign was:\nhow much hope people do have still, despite 14 years, there’s still hope, and there’s still a reason to keep doing this\nFeatured image via the Green Party",
