    "text": "Status: 29.12.2023, 18:46 PM\nBy: Bjarne Kommnick\nCommentsPrint Share\nMany regions of Germany are currently struggling against floods caused by storm \"Zoltan\". There is no improvement in sight, on the contrary: new rain is on the way.\nMunich – The flood situation in Germany remains critical. In the past few days, experts were already expecting further rain at the turn of the year. This forecast now seems to be confirmed: In the flood areas, of all places, heavy downpours are expected to occur again at the turn of the year.\n\"Weather forecasts worrying\": Despite flooding, no end to rain in sight for the time being Meteorologist Dominik Jung from wetter.net explains in a press release: \"The latest weather forecasts are worrying.\" In the next 48 hours, the \"high-resolution ICON-D2 model\" from the German Weather Service (DWD) would expect 30 to 50 liters of precipitation per square meter, especially in the flood areas.\nWill the situation in the flood areas come to a head at the turn of the year? According to the weather forecast, it probably is. Meteorologists announce new rain.

Especially over central Germany, where many dams are currently overflowing, the experts expect heavy precipitation until the end of the year.\nAnd the experts also predict new masses of water in Germany in January: \"The first ten days of January could bring 100 to 120 litres of rain in the west and south. The westerly weather situation simply does not want to end in the serious forecast period,\" says Jung. According to information from the DWD, the westerly weather situation (also known as \"westerly exposure\") describes a weather situation in which a strong west-to-east current develops over Europe over several days.\nWeather in Germany: \"Cold and snow don't stand a chance for the time being\" Winter fans will probably go away empty-handed at the beginning of the year. \"Cold and snow don't stand a chance in Germany for the time being. As a result, the risk of flooding remains very tense,\" predicts Jung. \"In many cases, the dikes and dams are softening more and more, threatening to break. They are soaked by the rain and pressurized by the floods.\"\nMy news Thief fills 189 liters in canister reading\nDischarged water from reservoir threatens places in Thuringia\nThe oldest butcher's shop in Germany comes from Baden-Württemberg read\nLake in Baden-Württemberg is the largest in the country – it is often overlookedread\nJetstream is heading for Germany: Current weather forecast makes people sit up and take noticeread\nFlood situation critical: Lower Saxony calls on Bundeswehr for helpRead\nOverall, it was particularly wet in 2023.

They also descended to where the injured man had stopped and were able to provide first aid and relay information to the responding rescue teams.\nAccording to the release, rescuers and medical personnel from Rocky Mountain Rescue Group were flown near the scene by MedEvac before climbing the rest of the way to the scene.\nThey were also assisted by other bystanders who helped carry equipment to the scene and additional rescuers hiked in from the Fourth of July Trailhead bringing additional equipment.\nRescuers were able to place the skier in a full-body vacuum splint, and he was hoisted from the scene and transported by helicopter to Nederland Middle and Senior High School. The skier was then transported by ambulance to a local hospital.\nAccording to the release, the skier sustained serious injuries but “remained stable throughout the incident.”\nAssisting agencies involved with this rescue effort include the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office, Boulder County Parks and Open Space, Nederland Fire Protection District, the Rocky Mountain Rescue Group, the Colorado Search and Rescue Association, the Colorado Hoist Rescue Team, MedEvac, and American Medical Response.\n(c)2024 the Daily Camera (Boulder, Colo.)\nVisit the Daily Camera (Boulder, Colo.) at www.dailycamera.com\nDistributed by\nTribune Content Agency, LLC.",

    "text": "Biden Announces New $1.7 Billion Grants For EV Production [Share] The Biden administration is throwing nearly $2 billion at electric vehicle manufacturing and assembly sites across eight states, including the political battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. The Energy Department will dish out $1.7 billion in grants, aiming to create or retain thousands of union jobs and breathe life back into communities dependent on auto manufacturing. Beyond the trio of battleground states, the cash will flow to EV facilities in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, and Virginia. This is a broad sweep of the automotive supply chain, covering everything from parts for electric motorcycles and school buses to hybrid powertrains and heavy-duty truck batteries. It's a move that screams both economic rejuvenation and environmental crusade, wrapped in the kind of high-stakes political drama that's become all too familiar in recent years. The timing of this announcement isn't lost on anyone. Biden, at 81, is shaking off calls to step aside after a less-than-stellar debate performance, clinging to his agenda while critics circle. Former President Donald Trump, despite his felony conviction, still has a chokehold on the Republican Party. The political theater is as intense as ever. This influx of federal cash is just a piece of the puzzle. It complements $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing since Biden took office. Officials stress that the grants come with strings attached: commitments to workers and communities must be met, and environmental reviews will be completed before any money changes hands. If everything goes according to plan, the projects funded by these grants will create over 2,900 jobs and secure about 15,000 union jobs across 11 facilities. Stellantis is set to receive almost $335 million to revamp an idled Illinois plant for EV assembly and another $250 million to convert an Indiana transmission plant to make electric drive modules. General Motors will grab $500 million to transform its Lansing, Michigan plant into an EV manufacturing facility. Ford will not receive any funds.
