    "text": "A new office has moved into the second floor of the Swingle Health Center at Montana State University. Almost every day since the beginning of the fall semester, a stark white letterboard sits outside, angled to catch the attention of passersby. In bright red letters, it reads:\n“CAMPUS CIVIL RIGHTS — COME TALK!”\nOn July 8, an email was sent out to MSU staff, faculty and students announcing the establishment of “a new campus unit” that consolidated the services of both the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) and the VOICE Center under one roof. The new office, known as Campus Civil Rights (CCR), opened at the beginning of this semester and exists as a “one-stop shop” for students, faculty and staff seeking remedies and support, according to CCR case manager Jessica Feltner.\n“[CCR] is here to help and support anybody that’s dealing with discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment — including interpersonal violence,” Feltner explained. “What we’re really here to do is get people to the support and the remedies that they need in order to get back to their role on campus.”\nOrigin of Campus Civil Rights The idea for CCR originated in response to student feedback from ASMSU, according to Feltner and managing director of the CCR Kyleen Breslin. The restructuring aimed to create one consolidated office for support and advocacy for students, faculty and staff.\nBreslin said that during discussions in the summer of 2023 between administrators and ASMSU leadership, the idea of a centralized place on campus where students could seek advocacy for all types of protected class harm was brought forward by ASMSU leadership. During that time, The Exponent reported that due to feedback received during MSU’s 2023 “Week of Belonging,” the possibility of a new crisis response center was being discussed and researched.\n“At the time, a lot of the services that [students] were identifying already existed on campus, but they were a little bit decentralized,” Breslin said. “We heard [students wanted] a broader scope and also felt like they had to go to a lot of different offices to get the resources that they needed.”\nBreslin said that ultimately, CCR combines the resources of the VOICE Center and the OIE and expands their scope. Now, a student experiencing any form of protected class harm — discrimination and harassment based on a person’s identity — can receive the same services that were previously only available for students experiencing relationship violence. She explained that CCR further streamlines the services that were shared between the former offices to reduce transfer between those offices.\n“Students won’t have to tell their story to multiple offices to receive all of the services available,” she said.\nFeltner said the office currently has five — soon to be six — professional staff members and about 20 peer advocates. A part of that group consists of former VOICE Center peer advocates, whom Feltner said were all given the option to join CCR.\n“Obviously, we’re not going to force anybody [to join] if they don’t agree with whatever part of it — that’s totally okay. But we have a good group of volunteers and student staff that wanted to join this effort,” she said.\nFeltner said there are also around 20 prospective student volunteers who have displayed interest in joining CCR and now are going through training to be future peer advocates.\nConcerns with change and loss of VOICE Center However, this change — especially related to the dissolution of the VOICE Center — has not come without concern for some.\nMSU student and former VOICE Center advocate Ginny Lou Garabedian explained she was disheartened by the office disappearing.\n“I’m less motivated to go and work for this office that I originally didn’t sign up for,” she said. “It’s just difficult to have a place that you loved, trusted and had a relationship with the people there and then to be like, oh, you’re not doing that anymore,” she said.\nNathan Clark, vice president of MSU’s Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) club, said he believes by dissolving the VOICE Center the university has eliminated an essential resource for students and made it more challenging for students to seek support.\n“To make it clear, I am not opposed to CCR, I am opposed to the dismantling of the VOICE Center. I do not believe that CCR will be able to take the place of the VOICE Center in the future,” he said. “The dismantling of the VOICE Center not only broke many people’s hearts but also broke many people’s trust that the university has their best interest in mind and that trust is not likely to be easily repaired. Not only that but, most students still seem to be unaware that the VOICE Center no longer exists. I’ve spoken with new and returning students alike who had no idea that this took place over the summer.”\nPresident of SASA Danielle Johnson expressed that the club worked closely with the VOICE Center and that many members of SASA were also peer advocates. She said that the VOICE Center was familiar and a safe space for many students on campus.\n“It was very well known as the VOICE Center hosted many informational events and there were stickers, posters and information on whiteboards in almost every building, dorm or classroom on campus, so even if students weren’t currently in need of the resource, they knew it was there in case they needed it in the future,” she said.\nJohnson said that because of the dissolution of the VOICE Center, she thinks fewer students will be reaching out for support as CCR is not well known on campus and has fewer trained advocates and less defined confidentiality.\n“With MSU being in the red zone — the first six weeks of classes where 50% of all total assaults for the entire school year occur — it is really unfortunate that there isn’t a fully functioning resource on campus for survivors,” she said.\nJohnson said she believes the creation of CCR was unnecessary, although she said it is amazing they have resources for students impacted by discrimination.\n“The VOICE Center had many amazing resources and there was nothing that needed to be changed about the resource, so it feels like MSU students were not listened to when they decided to create an umbrella resource of CCR,” she said.\n“There were more in-depth trainings, more educational and healing events for survivors and a safer and more comforting space for survivors to share their experience. Some survivors did not want to be referred to other resources, they simply just wanted to talk about their story, which is something I am worried CCR will not be able to focus on. I think the best and only option for survivors is to bring back the VOICE Center.”\nBreslin, however, said she believes that the consolidation of The VOICE Center and the OIE into CCR will increase students’ confidence in seeking resources.\n“Instead of having services split between offices, everything is being managed in one place by a case manager. Students won’t have to tell their story to multiple offices to receive all of the services available,” she said. “We have a fantastic team of professional staff, student-workers, resource advocates, many of whom served as VOICE Center advocates, helping to build the culture of CCR. With their input, I am confident that students will continue to view CCR as the place to get help navigating interpersonal violence and protected-class harm.”\nThe Exponent has conducted research into conflicting information reported during the interview processes, reaching out to relevant parties and reviewing available documentation to ensure an accurate portrayal of events. Every effort was made to clarify incongruent narratives and address any misconceptions surrounding these complex events.\nConfidentiality Concerns While Garabedian shared concerns about confidentiality in reporting threats to the campus community, Feltner, a case manager in the OIE for five years who worked closely with VOICE Center professional staff, maintained that VOICE Center policies around reporting have always been consistent. She said it was always required for the VOICE Center and OIE to report the de-identified information of crimes and incidents that fell under The Jeanne Clery Act of 1990, referred to as Clery crimes.\nAccording to the Clery Center’s website, the act requires colleges and universities to report campus crime data, support victims of violence and publicly outline the procedures put into place to improve campus safety. Clery crimes include, but are not limited to, aggravated assault, hate crimes, dating violence and stalking.\nFeltner said if a Clery crime happens on campus grounds, offices must disclose de-identified information of the incident to the UPD. This report will eventually end up on MSU’s annual crime and security report, sent out each year in compliance with The Clery Act. The only truly confidential office on campus is Counseling & Psychological Services, she said.\n“Prospective students, current students, families, all have a right to see what kind of activities [are] happening on a college campus and so it’s part of our responsibility to the greater good to report this de-identified information,” Feltner said. “We don’t report names, we don’t report other characteristic details that would identify that person. But we do have to pass on the appropriate information just to make sure that it’s being counted correctly.”\nShe explained that if a report of a Clery crime came into either the OIE or the VOICE Center, both offices were mandated to report that information. “I think that there’s a misconception that the VOICE Center maybe was doing something very different,” Feltner said.\nBreslin concurred. “[CCR] has the same Clery reporting obligations as the VOICE Center and the same FERPA-protected confidentiality,” she said.\nTitle IX investigation requirements Garabedian said in her statement to The Exponent that the VOICE Center was not governed by Title IX and was instead “focused solely on supporting survivors rather than initiating investigations.”\nHowever, according to the Montana Board of Regents Policy 507: “All campuses of the Montana University System (MUS) shall follow Title IX policies and procedures adopted and approved by the Commissioner of Higher Education.”\nFeltner confirmed that the entirety of MSU is governed by Title IX because MSU is Title IX compliant, and that policy applies to every office — including what was previously the VOICE Center.\nAdditionally, Garabedian alleged in a statement to The Exponent that due to changes made in 2020, Title IX offices could be required to report and investigate cases if more than two survivors identify the same perpetrator, even if the survivors do not wish to open an investigation.\nWhen asked if CCR would be required to open an investigation in the scenario described, Feltner said that while a Title IX office always has the right to open an investigation, it isn’t necessarily required and each situation is evaluated individually to determine a course of action.\n“We are here to make sure that our campus is safe. We’re here to make sure that everybody’s free of harassment and discrimination or the risk of sexual assault, etcetera. If we see a significant risk to campus, yes, we have the ability to address the situation. But that doesn’t mean that if two people come in we automatically start an investigation,” she said.\nAdditionally, if CCR were to open an investigation for any reason, Feltner said complainants — people who come forward as impacted individuals — have full control over their situation and have the right to keep their information private within CCR. She said the process is participatory and that means people coming forward have the right to choose what works for them.\n“If anyone is coming forward and they’re seeking help, support, or they’re just curious about what their options are — they still have the right to be in control. One of the things that we recognize is when we’re dealing with events like interpersonal violence, it’s that sometimes people lose the ability to make those choices,” Feltner said.\nBreslin said CCR’s process remains complainant-driven, meaning the individual who experienced harm will decide what happens next.\n“The only time that CCR must take action is when there is a threat of physical harm to an MSU community member,” she said.\nPotential loss of VOICE Center 24-7 crisis line Feltner confirmed VOICE Center’s 24-hour crisis line is still active and is attended to by CCR staff during its operating hours.\n“After five o’clock, [callers] are being redirected to the Help Center so that they can still talk with somebody that has training around crisis response. [The services] have been adjusted a little bit to fit this broader range of things, so it doesn’t look identical, but the heart of it is still there. The support and everything are still there,” she said.\nFeltner mentioned that free Plan B, a resource the VOICE Center offered the campus community, is also still available to those who need it.\n“The Office of Health Advancement right now has all the Plan B, but we’re working with them to get it back in our office at some point. Right now, if people walk into our office and they’re looking for it, we’re not going to leave them high and dry. We’re going to walk them over there,” she said.\nCCR open to questions, excited to move forward Breslin said she encourages all who have questions about the new office to come ask them to avoid misconceptions spreading.\n“We have seen articles with inaccuracies or misconceptions about the change. These inaccuracies hurt community members who need resources. CCR is just getting started,” she said. “We invite anyone who has input on our services or the culture of the office to join our team.”\nFeltner said CCR is ready to help anyone who needs it.\n“Our door is always open,” she said. “If somebody walks in and they’re confused on where to go, our job is to help them get the resources that they need, even if it’s not something that we can help with.”\n“The issue with misinformation is that it hurts the survivor. Survivors should be provided with accurate information, so they can make the choice [to] access the resources that they want and need,” she said.\nCCR is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays.

    "title": "Electricité: la production renouvelable devrait dépasser pour la première fois le charbon en 2025",
    "text": "La quantité d'électricité produite par les renouvelables devrait dépasser pour la première fois celle issue du charbon, selon les projections de l'Agence internationale de l'énergie (AIE) La quantité d'électricité d'origine renouvelable produite à l'échelle mondiale devrait dépasser en 2025 pour la première fois celle issue du charbon, estime l'Agence internationale de l'énergie (AIE), qui observe aussi un bond de la demande électrique dans le monde.\nCe bond de la demande mondiale \"révèle le rôle croissant de l'électricité dans nos économies mais aussi l'impact des canicules sévères\", pointe Keisuke Sadamori, directeur Marchés et sécurité énergétiques de l'AIE, soulignant que l'essor des modes de production décarbonées n'est pas encore assez rapide.\n35% de l'électricité fournie par les renouvelables en 2025 Hydroélectricité, solaire, éolien... Les renouvelables devraient fournir globalement 35% de l'électricité en 2025, contre 30% en 2023. Le photovoltaïque seul devrait couvrir pour moitié la croissance de la demande (solaire et éolien couvrant à eux deux 75%), note ce rapport sur l'électricité publié vendredi.\nLa production électrique issue de centrales à charbon ne devrait cependant pas décliner dès 2024, en raison d'une très forte hausse des besoins en Chine et en Inde en particulier. Cependant, l'AIE ajoute que les capacités hydrauliques chinoises pourraient créer la surprise, et in fine faire baisser dès cette année la part du charbon et avec elle les émissions globales de CO2 du secteur électrique.\nBond de la demande électrique tiré par l'activité économique Globalement, l'Agence observe un retour à une croissance annuelle de la demande à des niveaux jamais vus depuis 2007 (hors rebond post-Covid). Selon l'AIE, la demande mondiale d'électricité, poussée par l'activité économique et l'électrification des équipements, devrait croître de 4% en 2024, et de 4% encore en 2025 (contre 2,3% en 2023).\nAux Etats-Unis, où la demande de courant avait reculé l'an dernier pour cause de météo tempérée, elle devrait croître de 3% cette année, du fait de l'activité économique, des besoins en climatisation et des besoins - encore mal évalués - des data centers sur fond d'essor de l'intelligence artificielle.\nEn Inde, elle devrait bondir de 8% cette année, en raison aussi des canicules dont le pays est victime. En Chine, elle est attendue à +6%. Enfin, la demande électrique en Europe est attendue à +1,7%, après deux ans de repli lié à la crise de l'énergie et la flambée des prix.\n\"Il est encourageant de voir la part des énergies propres grandir, mais cela doit se produire plus rapidement\", commente Keisuke Sadamori, appelant à renforcer les réseaux et à de meilleurs normes d'efficacité énergétique \"pour réduire les impacts d'une demande de climatisation croissante\".\nML avec AFP Les plus lus\nCollision de Rafale: qui étaient les deux pilotes tués en Meurthe-et-Moselle?",

    "text": "Comme l’explique MoneyVox, la perspective d’une revalorisation du Smic avant fin 2024 s’éloigne. Et les chiffres définitifs de l’inflation du mois d’août, publiés ce vendredi 13 septembre par l’Insee, le confirment. Car pour que le salaire minimum augmente de manière mécanique en cours d’année, il faut que le dernier indice connu des prix à la consommation (IPC) hors tabac pour les 20 % de ménages les plus modestes s’élève d’au moins 2 % par rapport à celui pris en compte pour la dernière revalorisation du salaire minimum (celui de novembre 2023 ici). Si l’Insee s’attendait encore, fin juillet, à une augmentation mécanique du Smic en septembre ou octobre 2024 en raison d’un regain d’inflation dans le courant de l’été, force est de constater que la hausse des prix est restée plus modérée qu’anticipé. Ainsi, l’indice des prix à la consommation pour les 20 % de ménages les plus modestes a progressé de 1,41 % seulement entre novembre et juillet derniers. Et d’après les données dévoilées ce vendredi, ce même indice n’a augmenté \"que\" de 1,9 % environ entre novembre 2023 (117,41) et août 2024 (119,64). \"Une revalorisation automatique du Smic d’ici la fin de l’année apparaît très incertaine\" Soit 0,1 point de moins que le fameux seuil des 2 % permettant d’enclencher une revalorisation automatique du Smic. Puisque celle-ci doit intervenir le premier jour du mois suivant la publication de l’IPC si le cap des 2 % est franchi, cela signifie que le salaire minimum n’augmentera pas le 1er octobre 2024. Et à en croire l’Insee, le Smic ne risque pas, non plus, d’être revalorisé automatiquement le 1er novembre ou le 1er décembre prochains. \"Une revalorisation automatique du Smic d’ici la fin de l’année apparaît très incertaine\", écrit l’institut dans un point de conjoncture publié ce lundi 9 septembre.",

    "text": "Ancient Buddha statues in China damaged after being painted over as mark of devotion Story highlights Discovered in 2021, the statues were not registered in the heritage protection list, an employee from the local cultural relic protection bureau told China's state-run broadcaster CCTV. He said the villagers who damaged the statues were in their 70s and 80s and \"could hardly be punished but only educated.\" Discovered in 2021, the statues were not registered in the heritage protection list, an employee from the local cultural relic protection bureau told China's state-run broadcaster CCTV. He said the villagers who damaged the statues were in their 70s and 80s and \"could hardly be punished but only educated.\" People from a village in southwest China damaged a set of 1,400-year-old Buddha statues by painting them with bright colours. They did it to \"redeem a wish to the god,\" the officials said. According to Chinese experts, the Shifeihe Buddha statues date back to the late Northern Wei era (386-534 AD) during the Northern and Southern dynasties. These statues are crucial artefacts with academic value in Buddhist culture and art research. Moreover, they are the only statues in Sichuan carved on the surface of natural stone. trending now The Najiang County Research Center for the Protection of Cultural Property released a statement saying a villager asked his mother to hire a painter to paint the statues in bright colours to thank the gods for fulfilling their dreams. After the incident, the local authorities increased security measures to avoid more damage to the artefacts. Discovered in 2021, the statues were not registered in the heritage protection list, an employee from the local cultural relic protection bureau told China's state-run broadcaster CCTV. He said the villagers who damaged the statues were in their 70s and 80s and \"could hardly be punished but only educated.\" The employees also mentioned that the remote location of the statues made it harder for the authorities to protect them despite installing surveillance cameras. However, the villagers have painted the statues with acrylics, and it should be possible to restore them, the employee said, citing experts who examined the scene. It is not the first time such an incident has happened in China. In August 2018, some people smeared oil paint on Buddha statues at Fengmen Temple in Sichuan. Later, they were repaired with cement, Global Times reported. The Sichuan Provincial Bureau of Cultural Relics discovered 13 Buddha statues with pigment stains, most of which were made in the 1980s and 1990s. According to Chen Peijun from the National Cultural Heritage Administration, China has over 760,000 immovable cultural relics as of October, including the Great Wall. However, only around 5,000 of these are major historical and cultural sites that are protected at the national level. This was shared by Peijun during a news conference. In another incident, a pair of construction workers operating an excavator severely damaged a section of the Great Wall in northern China this year while attempting to take a shortcut. Such incidents have sparked a debate on Chinese social media about how to protect cultural relics in remote villages. (With inputs from agencies)",

    "title": "Former Cal Coach Teri McKeever Suspended by SafeSport for 'Emotional Misconduct'",
    "text": "Almost a year after former Cal head coach [Teri McKeever](https://swimswam.com/tag/teri-mckeever/) was [fired for bullying and harassment](https://swimswam.com/cal-fires-teri-mckeever-after-8-month-investigation-into-allegations-of-bullying/), the four-time NCAA champion was suspended Thursday by the U.S. Center for SafeSport for “emotional misconduct.” The conditions of McKeever’s suspension are [listed](https://uscenterforsafesport.org/response-and-resolution/centralized-disciplinary-database/) as “probation, no contact directive(s), education.” The length of the suspension is still unknown as her sanctions do not yet appear on USA Swimming’s website. Allegations about [McKeever’s misconduct first surfaced last May](https://swimswam.com/numerous-cal-swimmers-accuse-coach-teri-mckeever-of-verbal-abuse-for-decades/), as numerous current and former Bears claimed that she had verbally and emotionally abused them. McKeever was then placed on [paid leave by the university](https://swimswam.com/cal-places-teri-mckeever-on-administrative-leave-following-abuse-allegations/), and the school hired an independent law firm to investigate her. Eight months passed before she was finally fired in January. In May, a group of [18 former Cal swimmers sued the University of California regents](https://swimswam.com/former-cal-swimmers-file-lawsuit-against-uc-regents-over-teri-mckeever-abuse/), alleging that officials prioritized athletic success over the well-being of athletes by ignoring McKeever’s bullying — and in certain cases, enabling it — for decades. The suit claimed that athletic director [Jim Knowlton](https://swimswam.com/tag/jim-knowlton/), senior executive associate athletic director Jennifer Simon-O’Neill and other school officials were aware that at that time “several swimmers were leaving the team after experiencing depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideations.” Despite this, [McKeever had her contract extended through 2023-24 in January 2020](https://swimswam.com/cal-extends-teri-mckeevers-contract-through-2023-24-season/). From March: [Cal Implementing ‘Additional Steps’ After Firing Teri McKeever](https://swimswam.com/cal-implementing-additional-steps-after-firing-teri-mckeever/) McKeever, 61, served as the Cal women’s head coach from 1993-2022. She led the program to four NCAA titles and six Pac-12 titles while also working on three U.S. Olympic staffs. This included being named the head coach of the women’s team for the 2012 Games in London, making her the first and only female head coach of the U.S. Olympic swimming team. Cal men’s coach Dave Durden received a [six-figure raise](https://swimswam.com/dave-durden-received-a-110000-raise-to-take-over-cal-womens-team/) to take over the women’s team as well in the wake of McKeever’s departure.",

La Provincia di Bolzano: “Non possiamo riaprire la strada”. Gli organizzatori devono trovare un percorso alternativo 10 maggio 2024 Percorso e altimetria della tappa 16 Livigno-Santa Cristina\nPer approfondire: Articolo: Giro d’Italia 2024, la tappa 8 di Prati di Tivo in tv: favoriti e orari Articolo: Le pagelle della tappa 7 del Giro d’Italia: non esiste voto per Pogacar, Tiberi guida l'Italia che fa sperare Articolo: Pogacar batte Ganna nella crono di Perugia: il racconto della tappa 7 del Giro d’Italia. Ordine d'arrivo e classifica Facebook\nX\nWhatsApp\nPrint\nRoma, 10 maggio 2025 – Il Giro d’Italia non transiterà sullo Stelvio , la Cima Coppi dell’edizione 2024. “Il Passo dello Stelvio non può essere aperto per la tappa del Giro d'Italia del 21 maggio , perché il servizio stradale non è attualmente in grado di continuare i lavori di sgombero a causa del rischio di valanghe . Ciò significa che la strada non è ancora stata liberata dalle grosse quantità di neve. Dopo lo sgombero della neve, la strada deve comunque essere ancora messa in sicurezza contro la caduta di massi e slavine , prima di essere riaperta”, le parole dell'assessore della Provincia di Bolzano, Daniel Alfreider.\nApprofondisci: Pogacar batte Ganna nella crono di Perugia: il racconto della tappa 7 del Giro d’Italia. Ordine d'arrivo e classifica Gli organizzatori della Corsa Rosa dovranno quindi trovare un percorso alternativo per la frazione Livigno-Santa Cristina in Val Gardena.\nLa notizia era comunque già nell’aria. “Sullo Stelvio il pericolo valanghe è troppo elevato per far transitare la carovana del Giro d'Italia”, le parole di Olaf Reinstadler, presidente della locale commissione valanghe. Il passaggio alla Cima Coppi a 2.757 metri con i suoi 48 tornanti era in programma il 21 maggio. Da giorni il servizio strade della Provincia di Bolzano sta lavorando per liberare la strada dalla neve. “Il problema però - precisa Reinstadler - non è la strada, ma lo sono i pendii sovrastanti che sono ancora pieni di neve e con le temperature elevate di questi giorni si possono verificare distacchi spontanei”.\nNel frattempo nessuna dichiarazione ufficiale da parte degli organizzatori del Giro d'Italia. Una scelta verrà fatta a ridosso della tappa, in base allo sviluppo delle condizioni climatiche e ai suggerimenti dei tecnici. I vertici di Rcs Sport, con il direttore del Giro Mauro Vegni in testa, stanno chiaramente monitorando la situazione, come da prassi, con la priorità di garantire la sicurezza per tutti i partecipanti alla corsa e alla carovana.\n© Riproduzione riservata\nContinua a leggere tutte le notizie di sport su",
