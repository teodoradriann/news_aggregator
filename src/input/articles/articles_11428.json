    "text": "Dakar Rally 2024, Stage 9: Indian Rider Harith Noah Excels In Rally2 While Loeb Secures Victory In Cars By Carandbike Team 2 mins read Published on January 17, 2024 Stage 9 of the Dakar Rally delivered thrilling moments as Sebastien Loeb, a nine-time World Rally champion, made a triumphant comeback, securing victory in a challenging 417km stretch from Ha’il to Al-’Ula. Despite navigational challenges, Loeb finished the stage 4 minutes and 14 seconds ahead of his competitors, marking his fourth stage win in 2024. Carlos Sainz Sr, the overall leader, maintained a substantial lead in the rally's standings, finishing the stage in a competitive effort. The lead fluctuated during the race, with Sainz narrowing the gap to just 2 minutes and 35 seconds after covering 348km. However, Loeb's late-stage surge solidified his triumph, keeping him in contention for his first Dakar title. Impressive performances unfolded in the race, with Mathieu Serradori showcasing his skills in a two-wheel drive Century, securing the third spot just 29 seconds behind Sainz. Guillaume de Mevius and Guy Botterill closely followed in the Overdrive Toyotas. Audi duo Stephane Peterhansel and Mattias Ekstrom played supporting roles, finishing 10 minutes behind the lead. Sainz maintained his overall lead, now 20 minutes and 33 seconds ahead of Loeb, with three stages left in the rally. Nasser Al-Attiyah faced challenges as his Prodrive Hunter encountered issues at the start of the stage, leading to a temporary withdrawal. Despite the setback, Sainz's comfortable lead in the overall standings allows room for potential comebacks as the rally approaches its conclusion. Motorcycles and Quads: Van Beveren Dominates Bikes, Harith Noah Excels in Rally2 In the bikes category, the Monster Energy Honda Team dominated Stage 9, with Adrien Van Beveren, Ricky Brabec, and Pablo Qunintannila securing the top three positions. Van Beveren's victory extended his overall lead to 7 minutes and 9 seconds. In the Rally2 class, Harith Noah, following his remarkable first-place finish in Stage 8, faced the challenging 417km special stage. Riding the Sherco rally bike, Noah finished the stage in P4, 3 minutes and 56 seconds behind the stage winner. In the overall Rally2 class, Noah proudly holds the third spot, maintaining P13 overall. Hero MotoSports' Ross Branch Battles Challenges in Stage 9 Stage 9 of the Dakar Rally posed unique challenges with a 417km special stage and a 222km liaison from Hail to Al Ula. Hero MotoSports’ Ross Branch finished the stage in 5th place, trailing the leader by 6 minutes and 59 seconds. Despite a rough day, Branch and Hero MotoSports remain in 2nd place overall. The 7 minutes and 9 seconds gap, widened due to dune and camel grass difficulties, presents a challenge. Ross Branch remains determined, stating, \"It’s not the end of the rally. We’re still in the fight, and tomorrow we’re going to have to put the hammer down.” Stage 10, covering 317km within Al Ula, awaits the competitors, and with three stages remaining, the Dakar Rally's intensity continues. Hero MotoSports and Ross Branch aim to overcome challenges and vie for the top spot in the rally standings come January 17.

    "text": "Axon cancels groundbreaking of new headquarters in Scottsdale\nSCOTTSDALE, AZ (AZFamily) — Axon, the company that makes Tasers and police body cameras, is halting its proposed new headquarters and housing project in north Scottsdale but said it remains committed to the community.\nThe company said it’s canceling the current multi-million project just two days before it was scheduled to break ground.\nThe Scottsdale City Council [approved the proposal in November](https://www.azfamily.com/2024/11/20/scottsdale-city-council-approves-axon-headquarters-housing-plan/), but an [effort to stop the development](https://www.azfamily.com/2024/12/09/battle-over-scottsdale-signatures-gets-ugly-axon-petition-protester-arrested/) reportedly gathered enough signatures to put it on the ballot for voters.\nAxon founder and CEO Rick Smith said it’s not worth the risk that the project could be delayed even further, so he’s expanding a bid for the new headquarters to other states. Still, the company said it’s “deeply committed” to staying in Scottsdale.\nAxon representatives said the company expects to make a final decision on its headquarters location in the coming months.\nThe proposal included a massive 250,000-square-foot headquarters and manufacturing center with around 2,000 residential units and spacing for retail shops at a plot of land near Loop 101 and Hayden Road.\nThe project’s groundbreaking was set for Friday.\nCritics of the project [called the project a monstrosity](https://www.azfamily.com/2024/12/05/scottsdale-residents-gathering-signatures-strike-down-approved-axon-development/) and are largely against new housing developments in the city.\nSmith claims a California-based labor union leads the ballot referendum.\n“We can’t allow political games to put our mission or our team at risk. Our focus remains on saving lives, improving public safety and attracting the brightest minds to join us. If that means relocating to a community that fully supports those goals, we’re prepared to make that move,” he said in a written statement.\nSmith cites a Rounds Consulting Group impact study that said the proposed complex was going to be privately funded, bring in 5,500 jobs and would have generated $11.5 million in city tax revenues, Smith said.\nAxon has been in Scottsdale since 1993.\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

    "title": "Kidney transplants between people with HIV are safe and effective, and may help address donor shortages",
    "text": "October 17, 2024 Transplanting kidneys from deceased donors with HIV to recipients with HIV is safe, and the procedure should be opened up from research-only settings to the general public, a new study says. The research, published Thursday in the [New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2403733), shows that HIV-to-HIV kidney transplants are as effective as transplants using organs from donors without human immunodeficiency virus. The findings align with a [proposal](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/09/12/2024-20643/organ-procurement-and-transplantation-implementation-of-the-hiv-organ-policy-equity-hope-act) from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to no longer require participation in clinical research for HIV-to-HIV kidney and liver transplants. If the new rule is approved, it could take effect in 2026. The 2013 HIV Organ Policy Equity Act approved the donation of kidneys and livers among people with HIV – but only in research settings. The new study, an extension of earlier research, concluded that HIV-to-HIV kidney transplants should be expanded to routine clinical practice to help address the ongoing shortage of donor kidneys. \"Expansion of HIV-to-HIV kidney transplantation outside of research would be a win-win situation, because it will first benefit people with HIV who need kidneys by increasing the numbers of organs available from donors with HIV, and then, in turn, there will be more kidneys from donors without HIV for recipients without HIV,\" one of the study's lead authors, Dr. Christine Durand, said in a release. Durand is the medical director of the Johns Hopkins Transplant Research Center. Johns Hopkins Medicine performed the first deceased donor HIV-to-HIV kidney and liver transplants in 2016 and the first living donor HIV-to-HIV kidney transplant in the United States in 2019 under the [HOPE](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4949150/) Act. The new study compared 99 transplant patients with HIV who received kidneys from deceased, HIV-positive donors to 99 patients without HIV who received kidneys from donors without HIV. The one- and three-year survival rates of recipients with HIV were similar to those of recipients without HIV. The rates of survival without the loss of kidney function and kidney rejection were similar, too. The study is a follow-up to research published in 2023 that found people with HIV can safely donate kidneys without an increased risk of developing end-stage kidney disease or other kidney problems later in life. \"The importance of the study for people living with HIV and kidney disease is that kidney transplant with the HOPE study protocol offers similar outcomes at one and three years with potential risks of worsening HIV infection that appear to have been manageable,\" Dr. Joseph A. Vassalotti, chief medical officer of the National Kidney Foundation, said in an email. Vassalotti was not involved in the study. Kidney disease, also known as chronic kidney disease, has been called an \"under-recognized public health crisis,\" because it causes more deaths each year than breast cancer or prostate cancer, according to [data](https://www.kidney.org/about/kidney-disease-fact-sheet) compiled by the National Kidney Foundation. Kidney disease is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States. More than 1 in 7 adults – about 35.5 million people – are estimated to have the disease. The best treatment for kidney disease is early detection so that its progression can be stemmed or halted. But about 40% of adults with severe kidney disease don't know they have it, the National Kidney Foundation reports. People with kidney disease who are not diagnosed early enough may need [dialysis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/14618-dialysis), a process that filters waste and excess fluid from the blood. Of the more than 106,000 people on the national organ donation transplant waiting list, 92,000 of them – 87% – are [waiting for kidneys](https://www.kidneyfund.org/kidney-donation-and-transplant/transplant-waiting-list), and [12 people die](https://www.kidney.org/about/kidney-disease-fact-sheet) every day on the kidney transplant waiting list. People with HIV have a higher risk of death while on the organ donor waitlist and less access to transplants than people without HIV.",

    "text": "Britain steps up support to Ukraine with a complete package of £325 million for cutting-edge drones to help fight Putin’s illegal invasion. The investment, which will deliver more than 10,000 drones for the Ukrainian Armed Forces will harness the UK’s world-leading defence industries to deliver advanced new drone capabilities to Ukraine throughout 2024.\nThe announcement was made by the Defence Secretary during a visit to Ukraine, his third visit to the country. Accompanied by the Chief of the Defence Staff, he met President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, where they reiterated their commitment to Ukraine.\nIn a significant boost to the £200m drone package announced by the Prime Minister in January, the now £325m overall funding commitment will deliver over 10,000 uncrewed platforms – the majority of which are first-person view (FPV) drones,1000 one-way attack drones which have been researched and developed in the UK, as well as surveillance and maritime drones.\nDefence Secretary Grant Shapps said: “I am ramping up our commitment to arm Ukraine with cutting-edge new drones coming directly from the UK’s world-leading defence industries – straight from the factory floor to the frontline. I encourage international partners to join the UK in this effort.\nUkraine’s Armed Forces are using UK donated weapons to unprecedented effect, to help lay waste to nearly 30% of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.\nOn my third visit to this great country, I was pleased to be able to offer my firm reassurance to President Zelenskyy on the UK’s unwavering commitment to the brave people and military forces of Ukraine.”\nAccording to a press release:\n“These drones have proven highly effective on the battlefield since Russia’s full-scale invasion, providing situational awareness to target enemy positions and armoured vehicles. Ukrainian forces have also used these drones effectively to strike at the heart of Russia’s Navy. With more than a £100M of this package being spent on maritime capabilities, Ukraine will continue to turn the tide in the Black Sea.\nFollowing a meeting of the US-led Ukraine Defence Contact Group last month, which convenes more than 50 countries in providing military support to Ukraine, the Defence Secretary announced that the UK would co-lead an international capability coalition with Latvia to bolster Ukraine’s drone capabilities.”",

Kelly Ayotte will mark 100 days in office this weekend, and she said she is proud of her achievements while noting that she's not on board with some of the deep budget cuts proposed by House lawmakers.\nAyotte said that one major achievement she can point to in her first 100 days is the repeal of the 2018 bail law that made it much easier for suspects to avoid jail after arrest.\n\"If you're a multiple offender, the presumption is that you're going to be held, and if you've skipped out on bail before, there's going to be much stronger consequences for that,\" Ayotte said.\nIn a one-on-one interview with News 9, Ayotte said her top priority right now is the state budget. She proposed belt-tightening in February, but she will be working with the state Senate to restore much of what was in her budget, including top priorities such as mental health funding, which was cut by House Republicans, citing inadequate funds.\n>> Download the free WMUR app to get updates on the go: Apple | Google Play <<\n\"I can tell you that after the House passed the budget, the way that I put our revenue estimates together, with the head of the Department of Revenue Administration Commissioner Stepp along with the state's chief economist, Brian Gottlob, to get their best opinion on where revenue would be for the next biennium. That is what was contained in my budget,\" Ayotte said. \"After I looked at the House revenue estimates that were passed, I met with them again, and I asked them, 'Was I right? Where are we?' And I can tell you that they believe that the estimates that the House used are too low.\"\nTariffs are unsettling markets and increasing costs for some New Hampshire businesses. Ayotte said she still trusts that President Donald Trump will be able to strike a better deal.\n\"My hope is there will be a resolution of this, that there will be certainty, and we will work this out in a way that is good for New Hampshire,\" she said.",
