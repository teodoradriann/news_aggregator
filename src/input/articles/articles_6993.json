The 2022 Wimbledon champion pulled out just hours after the draw was announced at Roland Garros. Rybakina, who was seeded third in singles, also was due to compete in mixed doubles with Alexander Bublik. In a statement posted to its website, the Kazakhstan Tennis Federation said Rybakina, 25, is ill. \"At the moment Elena is suffering from acute bronchitis, and doctors have strictly forbidden her not only to go to court but even to fly to the event,\" the statement read. \"Rybakina was actively preparing for the games, expecting to perform at a high level of play at the Olympics, but due to her condition, it has now become impossible.\" The eight-time WTA Tour winner lost to Ukraine's Elina Svitolina in the bronze-medal match at the Tokyo Games in 2021. France's Caroline Garcia will take Rybakina's spot in the draw as the 17th seed, with Australia's Daria Saville entering the draw as an alternate. --Field Level Media",

    "text": "Heartbroken John Elway mourns sudden loss of agent Jeff Sperbeck in freak golf cart accident (Credit: Instagram/7Cellars) The NFL community is grappling with a heartbreaking loss following the tragic death of Jeff Sperbeck, longtime agent and close friend of Hall of Famer John Elway. Sperbeck, 62, succumbed to critical injuries sustained in a golf cart accident over the weekend in La Quinta, California, as confirmed by the Riverside County Coroner.\nJeff Sperbeck’s tragic golf cart death leaves John Elway shattered\nThe incident reportedly occurred Saturday evening, when John Elway and Jeff Sperbeck were leaving a Stagecoach afterparty. TMZ reported that Elway was behind the wheel of the golf cart when Sperbeck fell off the back. Emergency responders from CAL Fire rushed to the scene on Humboldt Blvd after receiving a distress call. Though Sperbeck was found \"unconscious but still breathing\" upon arrival, his injuries were deemed severe enough to require immediate transportation to a trauma center in Palm Springs. He was placed on life support but tragically passed away on Wednesday.\nAuthorities were only notified of the accident on Monday, which has raised questions about the delay. In a statement released Wednesday, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office said it is conducting “a thorough investigation into the death of Sperbeck and will take appropriate action based on the outcome.” Officials noted that because the event took place on private property and involved a golf cart, it may not fall under traditional vehicular regulations. As of now, the investigation remains in its preliminary phase.\nSperbeck wasn’t just an agent to Elway—he was a trusted confidant and business partner who played a pivotal role in managing the Hall of Famer’s post-NFL career. The two shared a professional and personal relationship that spanned decades.\nIn a deeply emotional statement, Elway expressed the profound loss he is feeling:\n“I am absolutely devastated and heartbroken by the passing of my close friend, business partner and agent Jeff Sperbeck. There are no words to truly express the profound sadness I feel with the sudden loss of someone who has meant so much to me. My heart and deepest sympathies go out to Jeff’s wife, Cori; his children Carly, Sam and Jackson; and everyone who knew and loved him. Jeff will be deeply missed for the loyalty, wisdom, friendship and love he brought into my life and the lives of so many others.”\nFor Elway, who led the Denver Broncos to two Super Bowl championships and is widely regarded as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history, this personal tragedy marks a sobering moment of reflection and grief. The loss of Sperbeck is not just felt within Elway’s inner circle but resonates across the sports and entertainment industries, where Sperbeck had built a respected career.\nAs the investigation unfolds, friends, fans, and former clients continue to mourn a man remembered for his loyalty, integrity, and the lasting relationships he cultivated throughout his life.\nAlso Read: Bill Belichick’s girlfriend Jordon Hudson quietly builds massive $8 million property portfolio at just 24 About the Author TOI Sports Desk The TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

    "title": "Dad has emotional reaction after learning stepdaughter's baby is named after him - Good Morning America",
    "text": "A Louisiana stepfather has gone viral for his emotional reaction after learning his stepdaughter named her baby boy after him.\nChloe Benton's TikTok video was recorded by her husband, Joel Benton, and captures her stepfather, John Roy Hennigan, meeting her son, John Witt Benton, about thirty minutes after his birth on Dec. 11. The video has already been viewed over 12 million times in just two weeks and has racked up nearly 10,000 comments.\nIn the clip, as Hennigan holds the newborn, he tears up and then sees the baby's hat with his name on it.\n\\\"John Witt. What a name! John, where'd you come up with that?\\\" Hennigan says with a laugh.\n\\\"It's a big honor,\\\" he adds. \\\"It's such a beautiful name.\\\"\nHennigan, who also goes by Roy, told \\\"Good Morning America\\\" that getting to meet baby John and learning his name was an overwhelming and beautiful moment.\n\\\"I'm very grateful to [have been] present at that moment,\\\" the 68-year-old said. \\\"When I got inside and I could see Chloe and Joel and I could see a little bundle in Chloe's arms, it was equally emotional and I do remember Chloe insisting putting his little hat on … and Chloe said, 'Look at his hat, look at his hat,' and I finally could focus on his hat and I saw 'John Witt' and it was a very moving moment. I was already kind of emotionally stirred up, you might say, but it was a beautiful moment.\\\"\nBenton told \\\"GMA\\\" that she and her husband had decided before the birth of their second child that they wanted to use the baby's name to honor two family members who meant so much to them.\n\\\"We like to use family names – names that are sentimental for people that hold meaning in our lives – so we wanted to do the same for our son,\\\" the 24-year-old explained. \\\"Roy has raised me since I was 11 so I knew I wanted to use his name in one way or another so we just kind of incorporated it that way.\\\"\nBenton said over the last decade, she and her stepfather have built a close relationship, despite a rocky start.\n\\\"As a child, it definitely took me time to warm up to the idea. I was very guarded,\\\" she recalled. \\\"But he definitely earned the place of a father in my life and so, I don't say that lightly or give that title to him lightly but he has definitely been there and never hesitated to fill that role in my life. So that's why it was an easy decision to name my son after him.\\\"\nHennigan agreed, adding, \\\"With Chloe … I really didn't care what she did or how the day went or how that hour went, but I'm just gonna love her and we'll work through things, and we did.\\\"\nHennigan said he is proud of his stepdaughter and feels \\\"very grateful\\\" to see her grow as a parent.\n\\\"I'm very proud of her and she's a great young adult, a great mom,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm so happy to be around her sweet children and her sweet husband and for a 68-year-old, it's just a beautiful opportunity and I'm very grateful for them. I don't take it lightly.\\\"\nBaby John's second name, Witt, is also Benton's birth name and honors her grandfather. John is the second child for the Bentons, who are also parents to daughter Hattie.",

    "text": "台大醫院前婦產科醫師鄭文芳涉嫌對3名金融保險業女性業務員下藥後性侵或猥褻，案件經台北地檢署調查後已於去年11月起訴。鄭文芳多次未到庭，並在交保後潛逃出境，法院裁定沒收40萬元保證金並發布通緝。台大醫院院長吳明賢今（3）天痛批，鄭文芳「有膽做壞事，卻沒膽接受處罰，是最壞的示範」，是「醫界之恥」，無論逃到哪，一輩子都將背負污名。\n吳明賢今天上午出席院內記者會後隨即走向守候的媒體，一開口就砲轟鄭文芳「簡直是台大之恥，也是台灣醫界之恥」。他並強調，鄭文芳已經不是台大醫院員工，也已受到台大醫院懲處。鄭文芳做了最壞示範，做錯事就應該接受法律制裁，鄭文芳不敢面對法律，不管作為醫師、老師都做了最壞的示範，辜負栽培他的台大及國家社會。\n精選報導：涉對3名女業務下藥性侵 前台大婦產名醫「交保潛逃」遭通緝！\n媒體追問，怎麼看鄭文芳棄保潛逃被通緝。吳明賢忍不住再罵，這是「最壞的示範」，不管跑到哪，一輩子都會帶著污名，最重要是不該用這樣的態度處理，俗話說「知恥近乎勇」，有膽量做壞事卻沒膽量接受處罰，是最壞示範，不管從哪個角度看「真的是醫界之恥」。\n回顧案情，2023年初時曾有藥廠女員工指控鄭文芳性侵，雖然當時檢方因摩鐵監視畫面顯示女子行走正常而未起訴，但此案後來引來3名女性相繼出面，揭露過去與鄭醫師見面時遭疑似下藥性侵的經歷。這些女性發現並非個案後，向民進黨立委范雲陳情，並召開記者會說明情況。\n3名女業務員陸續指出，分別於2020年5月、2021年1月與4月與鄭文芳會面時遭遇可疑情事。一名女子表示，她與鄭在居酒屋喝酒後失去意識，醒來時竟身處台大實驗室，衣衫未整，感到被觸碰過的跡象，驚恐之下逃離現場。另一人則稱，在旅館醒來時發現鄭人在浴室，她趁隙迅速著裝離開，不敢細問發生經過。\n另有一位女子證稱，某次在餐敘中一邊介紹理財方案，一邊與鄭文芳喝紅酒，沒想到期間她突然感到身體癱軟無力，無法支撐。這名女子描述，鄭文芳見狀便試圖親近她，並對她施以肢體接觸，所幸當時她的朋友準時赴約，立即將她帶離現場，才避免事態惡化。\n台北地檢署於去年4月8日首度傳喚鄭文芳出面說明，經訊問後裁定他以40萬元交保。檢方經比對3名女子的陳述與相關監視、物證資料後，認定他疑似以摻藥手段趁機侵犯、騷擾受害人，因而於同年11月提起公訴。台大醫院則在2023年底決議不再續聘，終止其職務。\n相關案件進入法院審理階段後，台北地院今年3月傳喚鄭文芳出庭未果，拘提亦未執行成功。保證人郭姓男子亦無法聯絡到鄭文芳，經查鄭文芳已離境後未再回到台灣，明顯意圖逃避法律追訴。法官遂裁定沒收保證金並發布通緝，檢警現在正追查鄭文芳的下落。\n※Newtalk提醒您：\n#性侵害就是犯罪，尊重身體自主權，請撥打110、113。",

    "text": "Le gouvernement britannique va annoncer vendredi 4 octobre un investissement de près de 22 milliards de livres sterling (26 milliards d’euros) sur vingt-cinq ans pour développer des projets de captage et stockage de carbone. L’objectif de l’opération sera de stimuler la croissance et de réduire les émissions de CO₂. Ces projets vont permettre de « raviver nos centres industriels en investissant dans l’industrie du futur », doit dire le premier ministre britannique, Keir Starmer, arrivé au pouvoir en juillet après la victoire des travaillistes aux élections législatives. Il va annoncer trois pôles de captage du carbone dans les anciennes zones industrielles du nord-ouest de l’Angleterre – dans la région de Liverpool – et du nord-est. Le captage et le stockage du carbone (CCUS) consistent à capter les émissions en sortie d’usines (centrales électriques, cimenteries, hauts-fourneaux…), avant qu’il parte dans l’atmosphère. Cette technologie prévoit de les injecter en profondeur dans des réservoirs géologiques ou de les réutiliser. [COP28 : le captage et stockage du carbone, enjeu majeur des négociations](https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2023/12/08/cop28-le-captage-et-stockage-du-carbone-enjeu-majeur-des-negociations_6204645_3244.html) 50 000 emplois prévus Selon le gouvernement, ces projets vont permettre de créer 4 000 emplois (50 000 à long terme) et générer 8 milliards d’investissements privés. Ils doivent aussi aider le Royaume-Uni à atteindre ses objectifs pour le climat en réduisant les émissions de carbone dans l’atmosphère de 8,5 millions de tonnes par an. Le stockage devrait démarrer à partir de 2028. Le Climate Change Committee, l’organisme chargé de conseiller l’exécutif sur sa stratégie climatique, salue le projet. « C’est fantastique de voir le financement de ces grands projets se concrétiser », a réagi James Richardson, directeur du comité. « Nous ne pouvons pas atteindre les objectifs climat du pays sans le CCUS. Cet engagement est donc très rassurant », a-t-il ajouté. En revanche, Greenpeace critique l’annonce du gouvernement. « Vingt-deux milliards de livres sterling, c’est beaucoup d’argent à dépenser pour quelque chose qui va prolonger la durée de vie de la production de pétrole et de gaz qui réchauffe la planète », a déploré Doug Parr, un responsable de l’ONG au Royaume-Uni. « La majeure partie de cet argent devrait plutôt être investie dans la création de nouveaux emplois dans les industries vertes de l’avenir, comme l’éolien en mer, ou dans un programme national pour isoler les logements », a-t-il ajouté.

    "text": "CNNEspañol sjv\n(CNN Español) — La Casa Blanca retractó el comentario del presidente Joe Biden el jueves que parecía apoyar una nueva elección en Venezuela. La oficina presidencial aseguró que el presidente estaba hablando de lo “absurdo” de que el presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, no “aclarara” las elecciones del país.\n“El presidente estaba hablando del absurdo de que Maduro y sus representantes no aclararan lo de las elecciones del 28 de julio. Está muy claro para la mayoría del pueblo venezolano, Estados Unidos y un número creciente de países que Edmundo González Urrutia obtuvo la mayor cantidad de votos el 28 de julio”, dijo el jueves un portavoz del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional.\nBiden había dicho a los periodistas “Sí, lo apoyo”, cuando se le preguntó sobre su respaldo a la idea de unas nuevas elecciones en el país.\nEl presidente estaba hablando con los periodistas en el Jardín Sur de la Casa Blanca después de que los líderes de Brasil y Colombia hicieran comentarios similares durante este jueves.\nLa respuesta, luego fue aclarada en los términos expresados por el portavoz del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional.\nEl presidente de Colombia, Gustavo Petro, sugirió este jueves”nuevas elecciones libres”, en un mensaje publicado a través de su perfil de X.\nEsas declaraciones vienen después de que, Celso Amorim, el principal asesor de política internacional del presidente de Brasil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, propuso celebrar nuevas elecciones para contrarrestar la crisis generada en el país por la controversia sobre el ganador de los comicios del 28 de julio.\nEn tanto, la líder opositora María Corina Machado rechazó la posibilidad de celebrar nuevas elecciones como solución a la profunda crisis política del país.\nCon información de Samantha Waldenberg, Stefano Pozzebon, Ivonne Valdés, de CNN.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Aurélie Sacchelli, Media365, publié le jeudi 30 janvier 2025 à 9h07\nBest Western Team, Oklahoma City a perdu contre les poursuites Golden State mercredi, malgré les 52 points de Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. D’un autre côté, les cadors d’East Cleveland, Boston et New York se sont imposés. Notez également la défaite de San Antonio à domicile contre les Clippers, malgré un bon Victor Wembanyama.\nDeuxième défaite en trois matchs pour Oklahoma City, le chef incontesté de la Conférence Ouest. Battu par Dallas jeudi dernier, le Thunder a perdu contre Golden State, seulement onzième du classement. Les Warriors ont remporté 116-109, après avoir été réalisé pendant presque toute la première mi-temps et quelques points au début du dernier trimestre. Les Californiens ont finalement remporté le dernier trimestre 32-25 sans tremblement, pour offrir cette victoire en prestige. P Le nourrisson, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, la star de l’OKC, a marqué 52 points dans ce match (deux points de son record), 16 sur 29 sur des tirs et 18 sur 21 aux lancers francs! Mais Golden State a livré un match plus collectif, avec en particulier 21 points de Stephen Curry (peut-être stimulé en ayant reçu son anneau de champion olympique lors d’une cérémonie avant le match) et 27 d’Andrew Wiggins. Une autre équipe du Top 6 de l’Ouest pour jouer mercredi, les Clippers (6e) sont allés gagner 116-128 à San Antonio (12e). Pour leur premier match depuis leur semaine à Paris, les Spurs ont mené au début du match, puis ont laissé les Clippers prendre seize points au troisième trimestre, avant d’aller au point, à la fin du troisième quart et au milieu du dernier. Mais les Californiens ont terminé très fort, avec un 22-9! Kawhi Leonard et Norman Powell ont chacun marqué 27 points, tandis qu’Ivica Zubac régnait sous les paniers, avec 22 rebonds (et 21 points). En face, le combat tout au long du match avec le Croate (il était même parfois tendu entre les deux), Victor Wembanyama a terminé avec 23 points, 12 rebonds et 4 passes décisives. Les Spurs sont maintenant deux matchs et demi du jeu, et c’est Milwaukee qui apparaît vendredi …. Notez également, toujours à l’ouest, la victoire 113-121 du Minnesota à Phoenix avec 33 points D ‘Anthony Edwards et 33 points de Kevin Durant.\nLes Knicks se proposent les Nuggets À l’est, le chef Cleveland était en déménagement à Miami (7e), toujours privé de Jimmy Butler, suspendu et départ du départ. Et les coureurs ont conduit d’un bout à l’autre pour gagner 106-126. Donovan Mitchell a terminé le meilleur buteur, avec 34 points, tandis qu’Evan Mobley a signé un gros double-double, à 22 points et 15 rebonds. Deuxièmement, le champion de Boston a repris bien après sa défaite contre Houston, avec Chicago (10e) sur le score de 122-100. Les C ont mené tout au long du match (à l’exception de quelques secondes au milieu du premier quart) et ont pu compter sur un Porzingis Kristaps de 34 points (record de sa saison) et 11 rebonds. La plus grande affiche de la soirée s’est opposée à New York, 3e à l’Est, à Denver, Western 4th, et les Knicks ont remporté 122-112. Outre le début du match et au milieu du troisième trimestre (+8), les Nuggets n’ont jamais mené dans ce match, malgré les 33 points de Jamal Murray (17pts, 6rbds, 6pds pour Nikola Jokic). Auteur de 30 points et 15 rebonds, Jalen Brunson portait les Knicks, qui peuvent rêver de la deuxième place. Enfin, l’Indiana (5e), ​​revenant de son voyage à Paris, a fait mieux que San Antonio, le remportant 133-119 contre Détroit (8e), dans un match à sens unique avec 37 points par Pascal Siakam et 30 Tyrese Haliburton (32 pour Cade Cunningham Side Pistons).\nNBA / saison régulière\nMercredi 27 janvier 2025\nCharlotte Hornets – Brooklyn Nets : 83-104\nStatistiques de Moussa Diabaté (CHA): 27 minutes de jeu, 13 points (5/6 sur des tirs, y compris 0 tir à 3 pts, 3/6 avec lancers francs), 8 rebonds, 1 pass, 1 interception, 1 balle perdue, 2 défauts\nTidjane Salaun (Cha) n’était pas dans le groupe\nWizards de Washington – Raptors de Toronto : 82-106\nStatistiques de Bilal Coulibaly (Was): 25 minutes de jeu, 8 points (1/6 aux coups de feu, dont 1/4 à 3 pts, 5/6 avec lancers francs), 2 rebonds, 1 pass, 1 interception, 4 ballons perdus, 2 défauts\nAlex Sarr (Was), blessé à la cheville gauche, n’a pas joué\nKnicks de New York – Denver Nuggets: 122-112\nPacôme Darietiet (NYK) n’était pas dans le groupe\nPhiladelphie 76ers – Sacramento Kings: 117-104\nStatistiques de Guerschon Yabusele (PHI): 28 minutes de jeu, 9 points (4/9 sur des coups de feu, dont 1/3 avec 3 pts, 0 lancement sans lancement), 6 rebonds, 3 passes, 1 interception, 1 balle perdue, 3 défauts\nSan Antonio Spurs – Clippers de Los Angeles : 126-128\nStatistiques de Victor Wembanyama (SAS): 35 minutes de jeu, 23 points (8/16 sur des coups de feu, dont 3/6 à 3 pts, 4/5 avec lancers francs), 12 rebonds, 4 passes décisives, 2 interceptions, 3 compteurs, 3 perdus perdus) ballons, 5 défauts\nSidy Cossoko (SAS) n’était pas dans le groupe\nStatistiques de Nicolas Batum (lac): 17 minutes de jeu, 12 points (4/5 sur des tirs, dont 3/4 à 3 pts, 1/1 à Launch-Franc), 5 rebonds, 1 interception, 1 balle perdue, 2 défauts\nPhoenix Suns – Minnesota Timberwolves : 113-121\nStatistiques de Rudy Gobert (Min): 34 minutes de jeu, 4 points (2/5 aux coups de feu, y compris 0 tir à 3 pts, 0 lancement sans lancement), 5 rebonds, 1 pass, 1 interception, 2 compteurs, 1 balle perdue Ball , 3 défauts\nGolden State Warriors – Oklahoma City Thunder: 116-109\nStatistiques d’Ousmane Dieng (OKC): 7 minutes de jeu, 0 point (0 tir, 0 lancement sans lancement), 2 rebonds, 1 pass, 1 balle perdue\nIndiana Pacers – Detroit Pistons: 133-119\nBoston Celtics – Chicago Bulls: 122-100\nMiami Heat – Cavaliers de Cleveland : 106-126\nPélicans de la Nouvelle-Orléans – Dallas Mavericks : 136-137\n#Oklahoma #City #tombe #Golden #State #Cleveland #Boston #Unroll",
