    "text": "Organizers must learn to embrace the polarizing nature of protest in order to use it effectively. Editor’s note: This article is the first in a two-part series about how movements can understand and harness the polarizing effects of protest. The first part looks at why disruptive protest is inherently polarizing — and how movements can win in a polarized context. The second part examines key factors that shape whether or not the polarization created by protest actions will be helpful for a cause.\nThis spring, student encampments protesting Israel’s war on Gaza spread across colleges throughout the United States, resulting in campus lockdowns, occupied administrative buildings, canceled graduation ceremonies and scores of arrests. But even before this latest wave of action, we have witnessed in recent years a proliferation of disruptive protest, spanning a wide range of social movements.\nA small sampling of activity since the start of 2023 could note that animal rights advocates have disrupted the U.K.’s Grand National horse race and Victoria Beckham’s fashion show ; abortion rights protesters have been sentenced for impeding the proceedings of the U.S. Supreme Court ; striking dockworkers “upended operations at two of Canada’s three busiest ports;” and climate protesters have blocked access to oil and gas terminals , chained themselves to aircraft gangways to prevent private jet sales, and spoken out forcefully at corporate shareholders meetings .\nGiven the urgency of the challenges in our world, this wave of disobedient and determined action should generally be regarded as a positive development. Because it breaks the rhythms of orderly business in society, forcing both the public and those in positions of power to pay attention to issues of great importance that might otherwise be downplayed or ignored, disruption is a vital tool of civil resistance.\nHowever, not all disruptive protests are created equal — and not all are equally beneficial in advancing a cause. Some actions can win popular support and lead to a snowball of escalating energy within a movement. Others can drive away potential participants, repel sympathizers and invite state repression. Put another way, some actions lead to victory, while others trap activists into a cycle of self-isolation and alienation from the wider public.\nTo be clear, in the face of injustice, action is preferable to silence. At the same time, studying the dynamics of polarization can help movement participants maximize their impact and prevent occasions when protests backfire.\nBut before they can work on the skills needed to harness the power of polarizing action, organizers must engage with more basic questions: Why is polarization around specific issues even necessary? And how can movements know when they are using it effectively?\nThe idea of an issue being polarized is most commonly talked about in negative terms. But to the extent that polarization around an issue is not present at a given time, it is not because difficult underlying tensions do not exist, but rather because politicians sweep them under the rug. They avoid them for fear of generating controversy that could fracture the political coalitions that keep them in power. In an interview discussing his 2020 book, “Why We’re Polarized,” author and New York Times columnist Ezra Klein explained “the alternative to polarization in political systems often isn’t agreement or compromise or civility — it’s suppression. It’s suppression of the things the political system doesn’t want to face[.]”\nProtest actions are polarizing. This means that they force people to take sides on an issue. And, contrary to what some may think, that is not a bad thing when it is used for progressive ends.\nTo take just one example, the civil rights movement was certainly polarizing. But were we really better off living with widespread and often bipartisan acceptance of Jim Crow segregation and the racist terror used to enforce it? Likewise, defying prevalent homophobia and affording equal marriage rights for LGBTQ couples involved considerable controversy and required politicians to take stands that most had long preferred to avoid — until social movements forced them to change course.\nPolarizing protest takes a suppressed and simmering issue and brings it to a boil, moving it to the fore of public discussion and, at least temporarily, placing its consideration above other disputes and ordinary deliberations. As famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass contended , earnest struggle for progress is “exciting, agitating, all-absorbing, and for the time being, [puts] all other tumults to silence. It must do this or it does nothing.”\nThe polarization of an issue, in this respect, is both an inevitable and necessary part of the process of social change. In the words of sociologist Frances Fox Piven, a preeminent theorist of disruptive power, “[A]ll of our past experience argues that the mobilization of collective defiance and the disruption it causes have always been essential to the preservation of democracy.”\nThe point here is not that polarization is good in itself. In the wrong hands, it can do great harm. For example, conservatives can generate polarization in ways that set back social justice — like when they employ racist and xenophobic tropes to effectively turn up public anger against immigrants. But it is essential for progressive movements to recognize that polarization is a force they can use as a tool, rather than something that simply must be avoided.\nYet even once organizers grow comfortable with the idea that their actions will be polarizing, crucial unanswered questions linger. Making people take sides on an issue is one thing. Making sure they take your side — crafting protests that compel members of the public to sympathize with and support a group’s cause, rather than driving them into the arms of the disapproving opposition — is another. So how, then, can movements do that?\nToo often, observers and participants alike consider the success or failure of protests to be mostly a matter of luck, resulting just from historical conditions. Or, they look at protests only through a moral lens, at which point the imperative to just “do something” or “speak truth to power” replaces hard-headed analysis of the impact of one’s actions. Yet those who wish to act more strategically can find a large and growing pool of resources to help.\nSocial movement theorists and scholars of disruptive power, Piven prominent among them, have analyzed how groups who may possess few conventional resources and enjoy little influence in mainstream politics can nevertheless leverage change through withdrawal of cooperation in status quo systems. An entire field of “ civil resistance ” has emerged in recent decades that employs both careful study of historical cases and practical experimentation in dissent to discern key principles that can be used by organizers. Still others have focused on developing theories of narrative change and story-based strategy , providing insights and best practices related to the communicative properties of protests.\nFrom radical flanks to a Birmingham jail The combined message of this varied collection of thinkers is that there is a method to the apparent madness of collective mobilization. Both through examining this scholarship and drawing from the wealth of lived experience passed forward by on-the-ground activists, interested practitioners can learn a lot about what tends to work when it comes to polarizing protest, what tends not to, and why.\nBut the truth is, it’s complicated.\nA safe rule of thumb for protesters is that, if they are acting nonviolently in pursuit of a just goal, taking a stand is far better than passivity or complacency. At the same time, in managing polarization, there is always room for organizers to improve their skills and refine their feel for shaping protest outcomes.\nThe dynamics of polarization remain complex for a variety of reasons. For one, polarization works differently in the context of a short-term electoral contest than in longer-term activist campaigns, the contours of which we are focusing on here. Second, the good and bad effects of controversial protest do not come as an either/or proposition. Instead, positive and negative polarization occur at the same time. Highly visible protests that draw in new sympathizers will simultaneously drive away other people who are turned off by activist tactics and demands. Thus, the White Citizens’ Councils grew in the South when the civil rights movement launched its most high-profile campaigns, such as the Montgomery bus boycott.\nBecause organizers cannot avoid polarization, both good and bad, their goal must be to ensure that the positive results outweigh the negative. They must use good judgment as they engage in a cost-benefit analysis of any potential action.\nOne concept related to the positive and negative sides of polarization is what social movement theorists call the “ radical flank effect .” The idea here is that sometimes the presence of a more militant faction within a movement — made of activists who deploy more controversial, outsider tactics — can make the demands of mainstream reformers appear more reasonable. Such radicals can advance the ability of insiders to extract concessions from people in power, who grow willing to negotiate with the “respectable” face of dissent when confronted with the threat of a more impolite and uncompromising alternative.\nThese outcomes are examples of positive flank effects. However, those who study radical flanks point out that the behavior of a militant fringe is a double-edged sword. Negative flank effects occur when extreme actions undertaken by a group on a movement’s margins — particularly actions that the public perceives as violent — end up inviting overwhelming backlash, discrediting the cause as a whole, and providing justification for the harsh repression of even modest dissent. Like with polarization more generally, the goal therefore must be to maximize positive flank effects while minimizing negative ones. And once again, this requires rejecting an “anything goes” mentality and instead exercising both judgment and discipline.\nAnother reason that polarization is complicated is that protests prompt members of the public to polarize around several different things at the same time. Distinct responses can be measured with regard to how observers feel about the issue at hand, what they think about the methods used by those carrying out the action, and how they view the target of a protest. For example, it is possible that people will say that they dislike a protest, but that the action will nevertheless be successful in making them view the target of the actions less favorably.\nAnother very common result is that, when asked about a demonstration that makes news headlines, respondents will report sympathy for the protesters’ demands, but they will express distaste for the tactics deployed. They will see the activists themselves as too noisy, impatient, and discourteous. This is an age-old dynamic, and one addressed eloquently by Martin Luther King Jr. in his renowned 1963 “ Letter from a Birmingham Jail .” This letter was written not as a response to racist opponents of the movement, but rather to people who professed support for the cause while criticizing demonstrations as “untimely” and deriding direct action methods. “Frankly I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was ‘well timed’ in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation,” King quipped. But confronting these criticisms, he made the case for why the movement’s campaigns were both necessary and effective.\nFor social movements, it is acceptable if mainstream observers dislike the disruption and tension caused by protest, so long as support for the underlying issue grows. When it comes to nonviolent resistance, this is the case more often than not, which is why the taking of collective action should be widely encouraged. That said, there are times when a movement’s chosen tactics are so controversial and despised that they overshadow any discussion of the cause itself. Therefore, with all actions, organizers must weigh the relative benefits of the polarization created against potential downsides. Organizers must use any and all means at their disposal to measure this response — whether formal polling data and focus groups, or simple conversations that pay attention to the responses from different groups of people, especially those outside their most immediate circles.\nThe spectrum of support Overall, the goal of the movement is to shift the “spectrum of support” in its favor.\nMany different organizing traditions have recognized that victory does not come from total conversion of all constituencies, but rather through making more qualified progress. In the labor movement it is common to place workers in a given shop on a one-to-five scale, based on their level of commitment to the union. “Ones” are strong leaders who will convince other co-workers to vote yes for the union. On the other side of the scale, “fives” are employees who are resolutely anti-union and actively side with the boss. Everyone else in the shop falls somewhere on the continuum between these extremes.\nAn organizer would not expect to win over everyone. But their job is to at least partially move those who can be persuaded, and to minimize the zeal and influence of those who cannot be swayed. The union must work diligently to make indifferent “threes” into more supportive “twos.” It must motivate existing “twos” to step up and become more active leaders. And, finally, it must aim to dampen the negative attitudes circulating among “fours,” convincing members of this group to abstain from actively supporting the opposition if they cannot be moved to defect entirely.\nComing from a different tradition, the spectrum of support — sometimes called the “spectrum of allies” and credited to Quaker organizer and activist trainer George Lakey — provides a visual representation of the same principle. The Momentum training community presents it this way:\nFor movements to win, they do not need to convince their worst enemies to change. Instead, they win by turning neutrals into passive supporters and turning passive sympathizers into active allies and movement participants. Meanwhile, they should aim to whittle away at ranks of the opposition — making them less resolute, active, and committed, even if these people never move beyond being neutral at best.\nAs 350.org puts it , the good news is that “in most social-change campaigns it is not necessary to win over the opponent to your point of view. It is only necessary to move the central pie wedges one step in your direction…. That means our goal is not to convince the fossil fuel industry to end themselves. Instead, it is moving the rest of the society to shut them down.”\nIn the diagram above, the arrow shows the direction in which organizers want people to move. In practice, however, they must accept that there will be some motion each way. In the wake of polarizing actions, it is not unusual for both the movement and the opposition to grow: opponents may be able to rally die-hards to their side who feel threatened by the issue at hand, as did the White Citizens’ Councils. Yet if, on the whole, organizers are moving greater numbers toward their side, they can count themselves as making headway.\nIn short, polarization is a multifaceted equation — and only by working hard to do the math can those who seek to use it get continually better at improving their results.\nAgainst protest shaming In recent years, there has been considerable research published that attempts to measure radical flank effects and track the polarizing effects of movements. While there are limits to how much protest impacts can be precisely quantified, the cumulative result of such research, in the words of one literature review , is to point to “strong evidence that protests or protest movements can be effective in achieving their desired outcomes,” and that they can produce “positive effects on public opinion, public discourse and voting behavior.” Both the historical experience of organizers and recent studies also provide backing for the idea that support for a movement’s issue can grow, even when a majority of people do not particularly like the tactics being used.\nNevertheless, with each new wave of protest, there is inevitably a rash of mainstream commentary about how protesters are naive and likely to harm their cause. Certainly this is the case with this spring’s pro-Palestinian student encampments, which elicited a raft of “protest shaming” articles claiming that the occupations were counterproductive . Often, those making such admonitions invoke an earlier age — such as the 1960s civil rights movement — when protest was ostensibly more dignified and effective. These overlook polls that showed how wide swaths of the public saw lunch counter sit-ins, Freedom Rides to desegregate buses, and even the March on Washington as being harmful to the winning of civil rights. Of course, all of these actions are now considered hallowed landmarks in the struggle for progress in the United States.\nBecause they appeal to public cynicism , which remains very widespread, about the ability of protests to make a difference at all, protest-shaming pundits can find fertile ground for their arguments. However, their perspective is rarely based on a hard evaluation of contemporary research or deep engagement with the history of social movements. Most often, it results in bad advice: Activists are told to work within establishment channels to pursue change, to avoid controversy, and to be more patient with the system — the same counsel King wrote of having received from erstwhile allies many decades ago.\nInstead of conforming to critics’ preferences and seeking to avoid polarization altogether, movements do better to carefully study how they can use it to their advantage. Understanding that both positive and negative polarization occur at the same time means that protesters can win, even when there is backlash. Understanding that a movement’s cause may benefit, even when there is negative perception of the tactics deployed, offers a critical distinction in measuring success. And understanding the spectrum of support allows protesters to gauge when, on balance, they are advancing and when they need to reevaluate their actions.\nProtest movements take a gamble when they unsettle the status quo. But it is a risk worth taking. For it is only when movements appreciate how polarization can be used as a tool that they are poised to make their greatest gains.",

    "text": "How Congress Uses Syntax to Justify Genocide Let’s look at republican rhetoric in university presidents’ congressional interrogation Context on the congressional hearing on anti-Semitic speech on university campuses Liz Magill’s resignation Saturday, December 10th as president of the University of Pennsylvania follows a tense congressional testimony regarding elite universities’ responses to on-campus, student-led, pro-Palestine protests — including Jewish student groups such as student chapters of Jewish Voice for Palestine — that have been labeled antisemitic by conservatives. On December 5th, NY Republican Congresswoman and House Republican Conference chair Elise Stefanik questioned Magill and other elite universities’ presidents (MIT’s Sally Kornbluth, and Harvard’s Claudine Gay) regarding their universities’ public positions on the student response to the Palestinian genocide. After the hearing, many in the mainstream political landscape called for Magill’s resignation — calls to which Magill acquiesced five days after the testimony. Congresswoman Stefanik’s rhetoric differs from (former) Penn President Magill A closer analysis of speakers’ varying syntactic strategies in the hearing’s transcript reveals how Stefanik’s weaponization of simple syntax conceals fallacious logic to aggressively control discourse, whereas Magill’s qualified hypotheticals failed to challenge Stefanik’s narrow terms and violent implications. While Stefanik’s rhetorical choices serve capitalist interests and the military-industrial complex enabling the oppression of Palestinians, Magill’s ambiguous language is nonetheless complicit in upholding institutional power structures that perpetuate injustices. However, both speakers uphold existing United States and Israeli power structures. A speaker’s syntactic choices — how a speaker structures their sentences — masquerade as stylistic decisions. Theorists from Michel Foucault to Erich Fromm to Noam Chomsky argue that syntactic choices are instrumental in shaping discourse and power dynamics. As Fromm contends, language propagates unequal power relations embedded in economic systems. A Marxist lens exposes how Stefanik and Magill’s syntactic choices in the hearing not only expose how language reinforces existing institutional power structures such as Congress and Higher Education, but their syntactic choices serve capitalist interests as well as the corporate military complex undergirding Israeli occupation and genocide. In this congressional hearing’s case, both/all speakers’ syntactic strategies support Israel’s genocide. Examining syntactic choices in Stefanik’s questioning and Magill’s responses enables us to recognize and understand dominant groups’ strategies for shaping public discourse, that is, maintaining their power over non-dominant groups. To do so, we’ll listen to Stefanik and Magill’s rhetorical patterns around ambiguity, narrative control, and false logic that undermine substantive dialogue. Our focus is analyzing Elise Stefanik and Liz Magill’s syntactic decisions in the hearing in order to demonstrate how the concept of syntax in language is a powerful instrument for oppressing marginalized groups. To conduct this analysis, we’ll examine the tense exchange between Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and former Penn president Liz Magill in the December 5th congressional hearing. We will identify syntactic choices, logical fallacies, and meaning-making in both speakers’ statements, and find Stefanik’s statements simultaneously more logically inconsistent, while also more effective given the hearing’s purpose and occasion aligning oneself with Stefanik’s rhetoric. I’ll be transparent about my views I will be transparent about two things: 1) I support the Palestinian cause and consider Zionism an oppressive ideology that manifests in violence, and 2) I do not agree with Magill’s statements and believe that her language, like Stefanik’s, not only fails to affirm the Palestinian cause but serves to reinforce Palestinian oppression. We’ll begin with the opening of Stefanik and Magill’s exchange. Let’s analyze the opening exchange Stefanik: Ms. Magill, at Penn, does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Penn’s rules or code of conduct? Yes or no? Magill: If the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment. Yes. Stefanik: I am asking, specifically calling for the genocide of Jews, does that constitute bullying or harassment? Magill: If it is directed, and severe, pervasive, it is harassment. Syntactically, Magill’s response to Stefanik’s questioning adheres to grammar conventions. Her response demonstrates some literary skill: her tricolon (three parallel words, phrases, or sentences) creates rhythm; her asyndeton (a stylistic choice wherein a speaker deliberately omits conjunctions — in this case, Magill omits but implies “then”) names three criteria for harassment concisely and with a more engaging ‘human touch’. But already Stefanik backs her aggressive questioning with false dichotomies. In her active syntax, she seizes control, while the hesitance and hypothetical framing of Magill surrenders power dynamics to her interlocutor. Gerunds can misdirect an audience Israel’s occupation of Palestinian land embodies a settler-colonial power imbalance. We hear Stefanik echo this imbalance to construct a reality-denying Palestinian humanity. As Fanon observed of African colonial history, colonial powers repeatedly ensured imperialist rule by using discourse that elevated the oppressor’s false sense of victimhood to justify violence against the dehumanized. In propping up an Ivy League student, whom she has not named, hypothetically calling for Jewish genocide, Stefanik does just this. Using a gerund here (“calling”) is part of the trap she sets generic action, leading to a specific and deterministic response. A subtle choice: adding a subject and possessive to the gerund clause (“a student’s calling for”) would have made the question rhetorically weaker than Magill’s measured, criteria-based response. And in conflating Jewish with Zionist, Stefanik broadens the nature of these ‘calls for genocide.’ Rather than framing pro-Palestine protest as anti-Zionist, Stefanik frames the ‘calls for genocide’ as ‘calls for the genocide of all Jewish people.’ This misdirection aims at erasure. In m manipulating the history of stark and horrendous anti-Semitic violence, Stefanik counters not anti-Semitism but ignores present Palestinian conditions. These choices serve her interests: an act of political theater to further the Republican project of equating ‘liberal institutions’ with antisemitism. Fanon would note echoes of 17th-century European colonial projects’ discourse in Stefanik’s own. These echoes manifest not solely in content but in form. Stefanik uses stronger verbs. She distinguishes her statements from the neutrality and passivity of Magill by using gerund forms of strong verbs (‘calling for,’ ‘bullying’), strong verbs (‘violate,’ ‘constitute’) loaded language (‘genocide’, and inversion (‘does that constitute’). She not only stronger verbs — she uses stronger nouns. Her use of the word genocide regarding Jewish people appropriates pro-Palestinian diction choices while echoing the language used in reference to the Holocaust, the most infamous act of antisemitism in the global consciousness. Israel’s indiscriminate violence in Gaza is genocide. Her syntax, too, is stronger: Stefanik’s inversion — ending the sentence with the interrogative independent clause — emphasizes the close-ended question to which Magill will find difficulty responding. Conditional clauses are no match for logical fallacies Magill’s challenges begin immediately. She opens her sentence with a conditional clause (‘if…’). In opening her sentence with a conditional, Magill frames her response as hypothetical. If Magill had said ‘If the speech turns into conduct,’ she would have pushed Stefanik to invoke specificity, tangible student actions. Instead, Magill remains abstract — permitting Stefanik to continue using hypothetical situations. And since Stefanik hasn’t defined her terms (“bullying,” “harassment”), Magill correctly responds to the degree of logical consistency. However, correct isn’t always effective. Though her neutral tone and conditional phrasing reflect institutional constraints out of her personal control, these syntactic choices avoid direct confrontation in a situation Stefanik established as emotionally charged. Stefanik uses the ‘False Dilemma’ logical fallacy Emotionally charged does not mean logically sound. Despite her direct, declarative syntax, Stefanik’s argument employs the False Dilemma logical fallacy, which misrepresents a nuanced issue as binary and mutually exclusive (“this or that”, “yes or no”) when more possibilities that may or do indeed exist. In this particular False Dilemma, responding to Stefanik with an answer other than “yes” leads to perceived indecisiveness — and emotional inconsideration — on Magill’s part. In shifting discourse from logical analysis to emotional reaction Stefanik gains the upper hand; repeating her binary question forces Magill into the defensive. If an audience accepts the False Dilemma, Stefanik may build an echo chamber implying Magill’s complicity in a hypothetical situation. Stefanik presents this hypothetical situation — “calling for the genocide of Jews” — as concrete. She presents this hypothetical situation as a binary choice. It’s X or it’s Y. In doing so, Stefanik chooses to ignore nuance and consequences. Framing her question as binary precludes conversation. Stefanik takes rhetorical control of the dialogue. She seeks to establish a narrative in which there is a single-word, straightforward answer. Her technique forces her respondent into either agreeing or disagreeing, or else risk coming off as evasive — Magill won’t assert her own views, which undermines her argument’s logical clarity and her own credibility — or complicit — she doesn’t agree, so she must disagree. If Magill qualifies Stefanik’s claim, Magill will appear complicit in anti-Semitism and “the genocide of Jews.” These syntactic structures restrict substantive conversation. In a time of viral video, Stefanik seeks more of a “gotcha” moment than an ethical discussion. In this case, Congresswoman Stefanik’s inflammatory rhetoric and false binaries exploitatively link a hypothetical scenario of racist speech to the actual genocide of Palestinians. Her discursive tactic upholds the economic dominance fueling Palestinian displacement and violence. Her language obscures the long-standing billions of American military aid funding Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes, theft of land, and deadly police raids commonplace for decades. This syntactic strategy isn’t novel. Stefanik’s discourse mirrors a wider right-wing syntactic strategy: framing discourse through fallacious narrow options to maintain existing social hierarchies. Ultimately Magill loses the battle by entering the battle. Stefanik’s early rhetorical dominance through weaponizing emotion and narrow choices makes apparent her political agenda of manufacturing consent for oppression, against Magill’s ineffective attempts at nuance. While Magill hopes to inject thoughtful qualifications, Stefanik immediately closes space for substantive dialogue by restricting options with binary syntax designed to back opponents into corners. Whereas Stefanik limits acceptable responses and goes on offense through syntax and fallacious logic, Magill plays defense in reaching for reason against hostility. Let’s look at the second part of the exchange Stefanik: So the answer is yes. Magill: It is a context-dependent decision, Congresswoman. Stefanik: It’s a context dependent decision. That’s your testimony today, calling for the genocide of Jews is depending upon the context, that is not bullying or harassment. This is the easiest question to answer. Yes, Ms. Magill. Yes or no? Magill: If the speech becomes conduct, it can be harassment, yes. In qualifying Stefanik’s hypothetical with “context-dependent” Magill gestures toward rebuttal; Magill’s concluding “yes” undermines her own refutation of Stefanik’s implication that, due to her inability to directly commit to the support of Israel at the expense of campus free speech and Palestinian lives, Magill is unfit to serve as the University of Pennsylvania’s president. Qualifying a claim without challenging its underlying assumptions gives power to that claim. Though Magill speaks as if nuanced, claiming “it is a context-dependent decision,” she does not provide this context. People of diverse political beliefs agree that context matters in politics. In deciding to omit context clarifying her own position on the Palestinian genocide, Magill restricts the level of support she can gain from her audience. Magill’s neglect to situate her audience within the context leaves her argument nutrient-deficient. She could have responded to Stefanik’s genocide claim; her choice to ignore the word ‘genocide’ leaves Stefanik’s argument with the record for most loaded language. Through casually deploying terminology like “genocide” using authoritative syntax, Stefanik helps normalize violence against marginalized groups when such language is credibly adopted by dominant political factions. Stefanik uses the ‘False Equivalence’ logical fallacy We find Magill and Stefanik repeating their respective approaches from the conversation’s opening. Magill uses conditional statements; Stefanik uses logical fallacy to cover holes in her claims. The fallacy? False Equivalence. Her False Equivalence equates calls for Palestinian freedom with calls for Jewish genocide in order to silence political actors. In other words, equates hypothetical genocide-calling speech with the act of exterminating targeted civilian population groups. Again Stefanik opens with three declarative statements in service of reminding the audience of her viewpoint. Her position will be clear to an audience of wide-ranging listening comprehension. Magill’s syntax once again goes on the defensive. Where Stefanik began with unfounded authority, Magill began with ethical clarification. Stefanik uses the ‘Affirming the Consequent’ logical fallacy Stefanik’s direct, declarative sentence has already undermined Magill’s rhetorical credibility. Stefanik’s opening with “So” establishes her greater assertiveness. Magill, Stefanik implies, tiptoes around her own [Magill’s] views. She implies “If not yes, then no.” Another logical fallacy: Affirming the Subsequent. ‘If not A, then B, therefore A is false,’ Stefanik claims Using the logical inconsistencies she presents as objectively true, Stefanik commands Magill to repeat Stefanik’s assertion. In Stefanik’s unevidenced conclusion, her declarative strategy defeats Magill’s suggestion of nuance. Nuance is impossible without topical clarity. Arguments require clear definitions. If speakers do not agree on their definitions, or worse, speak in ignorance, then any verbal exchange is not an argument but dialogue. Both speakers fail to define their terms. What’s ‘conduct’ to Stefanik? To Magill? To the audience? And ‘harassment’? The audience’s definitions may differ from Stefanik’s, Magill’s, and from each others’. Magill is vague Magill’s sentence’s conditional structure fails to clarify her views — her syntax too produces vagueness. Syntactic vagueness suggests a speaker’s lack of decisiveness. Speaking directly, and using active voice, performs self-confidence. Rhetorically, if a speaker’s argument is vague, then the questioner may exploit this vagueness for their own ends. And that’s what Stefanik does. “Yes or no,” she repeats several times. Magill doesn’t respond with either of these, but neither does she address the logical fallacies within Stefanik’s questioning. Instead, she uses conditional statements and passive voice. Speakers’ active voice strengthens their arguments. Arguments of speakers are generally weakened by their use of passive voice. In doing so she evades assigning judgment to the actions of Stefanik’s imaginary genocidal harasser. Magill’s subject inversion constructs an opportunity for Stefanik to sharpen her questioning, however fallacious her rhetoric. Stefanik’s syntactic choices leave audiences with an impression of the greater certainty of Stefanik’s argument for Israel’s right to genocide; given less certainty is Magill’s conditional statement response. Let’s look at the concluding statements Stefanik: Conduct meaning committing the act of genocide. The speech is not harassment. This is unacceptable. Ms. Magill, I’m gonna give you one more opportunity for the world to see your answer. Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Penn’s Code of Conduct when it comes to bullying and harassment? Yes or no? Magill: It can be harassment. Stefanik: The answer is yes. After a bizarre definition of “conduct” as “committing the act of genocide.” — unusual, confusing, and makes no logical sense — Magill misses an opportunity to undermine her interrogator’s reasoning. Rather than go on the offensive, Magill continues embracing passive syntax in her use of the model verb “can.” Modal verbs (e.g. “can,” “may,” “must”) are used to express possibility or necessity. Modal verbs often introduce ambiguity or flexibility in a statement’s interpretation. Magill’s use of the modal verb “can” implies multiple outcomes. If something can be, then that same thing also cannot be. Magill’s modal verb may suggest a rebuttal — a ‘hey you’re saying that X is necessarily the case, but it’s not necessarily the case but it sometimes is the case’ — but her modal verb decides to leave it there: a suggestion, an isolated idea. Stefanik, in contrast, places the world behind her in providing Magill the “opportunity” for “the world to see your answer” is disingenuous. She implies that the entire world holds her own viewpoint. Stefanik ‘succeeds’ And it works. “Yes,” concludes Magill. Though she attempts to mask agreement in passivity, conditions, and left-branching sentence structure, Magill agrees to Stefanik’s faux claim. Ultimately Magill’s use of passive voice, subjunctive mood, and subject inversion creates ambiguity. Magill’s responses do not persuade the audience to condemn the Palestinian genocide. They’re not radical; they’re ambiguous. Stefanik exploits this ambiguity to amplify mainstream support for the Palestinian genocide. Due to Magill’s ambiguity, Stefanik’s rhetoric succeeds in its impression, despite her logical fallacies. Meanwhile, Magill’s equivocation and ambiguous syntax fail to name — and therefore fails to disrupt — American and British-made structures oppressing Palestinians. Theorist Erich Fromm would see Magill as perpetuating the linguistic rules serving elite class interests, an elite class invested in endless asymmetrical warfare. In an attempt at neutrality amid clear oppression, Magill’s equivocation makes her complicit in the capitalist forces commodifying Palestinian genocide. Conclusion In her final address to Magill, Stefanik echoes her earlier statement: “So the answer is yes.” But in this instance, Stefanik drops the “So.” In dropping the “So,” Stefanik implies her authority. Following her fallacious reasoning, Stefanik presents her conclusion as final. No opportunity for qualification. It’s logical, Stefanik implies, using a variety of illogical strategies. Simple, aggressive syntax sticks its stubby fingers into logical holes. It controls narratives. Stefanik weaponizes declarative statements, false binaries, and loaded words to force university presidents’ faltering responses. Stefanik’s syntactic dominance propagates problematic premises while shutting the door to substantive debate. Magill has the greater syntactic skill. Her sentences are more complex in syntax, diction, and logical consistency. But qualifications and ambiguous language surrender authority to the powerful. Magill’s hypothetical framing and vague concessions granted unchecked legitimacy to the very assumptions she ostensibly challenged. Her failure to name injustice then upheld institutional biases enabling systematic violence. Stefanik’s authoritative tone and declarative syntax undermine Magill’s accuracy. An academic setting demands logical consistency at concision’s expense; a public hearing demands concision at logic. Ironically, it’s Magill’s superior logical reasoning that provides Stefanik opportunities to diminish Magill’s rhetorical effectiveness. The contrast between Stefanik’s declarative rhetoric and Magill’s syntactic passivity showcases what Fanon proved in 1961: language constructed by ruling institutions serves the oppressor; and serves to dehumanize the colonized. “Neutral,” bureaucratic syntax provides cover for violent imperialist regimes like present-day Israel to continue settler conquest and indigenous erasure, materially and discursively. Language oppresses when marginalizing groups construct it. Even simple syntax can normalize marginalization through unconscious biases. In Stefanik’s presidential rout, we hear political rhetoric dehumanizing the vulnerable by linking ambiguous speech to material domination. In this case, discourse solidified congressional authority over student academic dissent; and Israeli impunity over Palestinian lives.",
