All rights reserved. 6 dead, including 2 children, from wrong-way, head-on collision in Texas: 'Devastating scene and very emotional' December 28, 2023 Six people are dead, including two children, after a deadly car crash in Texas on Tuesday afternoon. Police noted that the fatal car accident left a \"devastating scene\" and has been very emotional for responding officers. A preliminary investigation found that a white 2014 Chevrolet Silverado was traveling southbound on U.S. Highway 67 when the pickup truck entered the northbound lane in a no-passing zone. The Silverado smashed into a Honda Odyssey minivan in a head-on collision, according to a statement posted by the Johnson County Sheriff's Office on its official The devastating car crash resulted in \"heavy damage\" to both vehicles, just west of Cleburne, approximately 30 miles south of Fort Worth, Texas. The highway was closed for hours as investigators processed the crash site. The driver and passenger of the Chevy pickup truck — both 17-year-olds from Glen Rose — were traveling the wrong way on the highway and experienced injuries from the collision. The teenagers were transported to Fort Worth hospitals in critical condition. However, the people in the minivan suffered horrific fates in the deadly car accident . The Texas Department of Public Safety identified the six people traveling in the Odyssey minivan who perished in the car collision: 28-year-old driver Rushil Barri, 36-year-old Naveena Potabathula, 64-year-old Nageswararao Ponnada, 60-year-old Sitamahalakshmi Ponnada, 10-year-old Krithik Potabathula, and 9-year-old Nishidha Potabathula. A 26-year-old male from Georgia was critically injured and rushed to a local hospital. All but one of the deceased are residents of Alpharetta, Georgia. The 28-year-old driver was from Irving, Texas. The Telugu Association of North America said all of the adults in the minivan emigrated from India to the United States, according to Fox News . \"It’s so hard to take. He’s my half. He’s my half,\" Rakesh Barri, Rushil Barri’s brother, told WFAA-TV . The Johnson County Sheriff's Office said in a statement, \"Please say a prayer for the families of the deceased and injured. Also, please pray for our Deputies, Troopers, and all other first responders working this accident. It’s a devastating scene and very emotional for all involved.\" Law enforcement officials are still investigating the fatal car collision.

    "text": "Con el parón vacacional de la actividad deportiva, las instalaciones de Mojategi se han sumergido en obras para, por un lado, remodelar la pista de atletismo, que acusa el deterioro del paso del tiempo y, por otro, sustituir el sistema de alumbrado en clave de eficiencia y ahorro energético. En su conjunto ambas actuaciones traerán consigo un desembolso económico para las arcas locales de 1.111.000 euros, tal y como destaca el edil\narrasatearra de Deportes, Mikel San Miguel.\nUn pavimento con grandes niveles de humedad y abombamientos en la superficie son algunos de los desperfectos que presenta la pista de atletismo, a la que no se le ha metido mano desde 2007. Después de 17 años va a someterse a un lifting que renovará su suelo y el equipamiento deportivo. La puesta en marcha de las ansiadas obras es una buena noticia para Arrasate Atletiko Taldea que ha tenido que convivir con unas instalaciones en mal estado, que gracias a esta intervención recuperarán la homologación que hace unos años les retiró la Federación Española de Atletismo.\nLos trabajos han sido adjudicados a Obras y Pavimentos SA, con un coste cercano a los 750.000 euros y un plazo de ejecución de tres meses, de manera que si todo va bien concluirán para mediados de octubre.\nReducir el consumo a la mitad\nPor su parte, el alumbrado de Mojategi está compuesto por ocho torres de luz, cuatro por cada campo de fútbol y rugby (este último incorpora la pista de atletismo). “El consumo energético actual es muy alto. Se va a habilitar un nuevo sistema led que, además, ofrece la opción de regular la luz en función de su uso”, explica San Miguel, que también incide en que Mojategi es la infraestructura pública que “más energía consume, con 305.000 kilovatios hora anuales”.\nCon este cambio, el equipamiento deportivo bajará a la mitad su consumo, ahorrando, según avanza el concejal arrasatearra, “20.000 euros al año, y reduciendo las emisiones de CO2”. La empresa Tecuni asume el desarrollo de estos trabajos durante los dos próximos meses con un presupuesto de 361.600 euros.\n“Mojategi se integrará en el futuro polideportivo de Musakola y es por ello que en los últimos años se están realizando en este recinto inversiones de actualización y mantenimiento”, concluye San Miguel.",

    "text": "Recalls & Warnings\nConsumerLab.com is keeping you informed with current product recalls and warnings.\nPosted December 19, 2024\nForce Forever Joint Pain Supplement Recalled\nOn December 12, 2024, GNMart INC recalled all lots of Force Forever, a supplement promoted for joint pain, because FDA tests found it to contain undeclared diclofenac and dexamethasone.\n(See ConsumerLab’s [Review of Joint Health Supplements](/reviews/review-glucosamine-chondroitin-msm-boswellia-supplements/jointsupplements/) for tests of related products.)\nDiclofenac is a prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can cause serious cardiovascular events such as heart attack or stroke, as well as bleeding, ulceration, and fatal tears of the stomach and intestines. When interacting with other medications, diclofenac can significantly increase the risk for adverse events. Taking multiple products containing NSAIDS increases these risks.\nDexamethasone is a prescription corticosteroid drug that has the potential to cause severe and serious adverse events including adrenal suppression, a disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones, and other adverse events, which can lead to death. Depending on the dose, these adverse events may be severe and even life threatening. Sudden discontinuation of dexamethasone can also cause potentially dangerous withdrawal symptoms.\nRecalled Force Forever (see [product photos](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/gnmart-inc-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-force-forever-due-undeclared-drug-ingredients#recall-photos)) is packaged in white bottles with a red and blue label, containing 60 tablets. The recall includes all lots with an expiration date of 03/27/2030. The product was distributed nationwide via the internet at gnmart.com.\nGNMart is notifying customers by email and is arranging for the return or replacement of all recalled products. Consumers that have product which is being recalled should stop using and return to place of purchase.\nConsumers should contact their healthcare provider if they have experienced any adverse side effects. Consumers and healthcare providers are also encouraged to report any adverse reactions to the [FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program.](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/)\nFor more information, use the link below.\n[GNMART INC Issues Voluntary Nationwide Recall of Force Forever Due to Undeclared Drug Ingredients Diclofenac and Dexamethasone](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/gnmart-inc-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-force-forever-due-undeclared-drug-ingredients)\nSee related recalls and warnings:\n[AK Forte Joint Pain Supplement Recalled](/recalls/14865/ak-forte-joint-pain-supplement-recalled/)\n[Prescription Drugs Found in Arthritis, Muscle Pain, and Osteoporosis Supplements](/recalls/14647/prescription-drugs-found-in-arthritis-muscle-pain-and-osteoporosis-supplements/)\n[FDA Warns Consumers Not to Use Ossos-Sans Supplement for Joints](/recalls/14832/fda-warns-consumers-not-to-use-ossos-sans-supplement-for-joints/)\n[Joint Pain Supplements Recalled Due to Undeclared Drug Ingredients](https://www.consumerlab.com/recalls/14789/joint-pain-supplements-recalled-due-to-undeclared-drug-ingredients/)",

    "title": "Ruto moves to clip Gachagua's political wings, support base",
    "text": "President William Ruto has been actively pursuing political leaders and allies of impeached Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, a move designed to diminish Gachagua’s political influence and clip his wings. Dr Ruto has won several Members of Parliament from Mt Kenya region previously considered to be Gachagua allies but have since shifted their loyalty. In the latest move, Gachagua’s former Personal Assistant Francis Maina has been appointed as the Deputy Director of Communication in the Executive Office of the President. Maina was recently sacked shortly before Gachagua was impeached. In the build-up to the impeachment, Gachagua had last month hosted 11 Senators from the Mount Kenya region at his official residence in Karen Estate in Nairobi where the Senators committed to supporting whatever political direction he deems fit as they seek reelection in the 2027 general elections. Senators Karungo Thangwa (Kiambu), Kamau Murango (Kirinyaga) John Methu (Nyandarua), John Kinyua (Laikipia) Joseph Githuku (Lamu), Joe Nyutu (Muranga), Tabitha Karanja (Nakuru) were present during the meeting in which Gachagua appeared to have consolidated his support in the region. At the same time, Senators Kathuri Murungi (Meru), Wahome Wamatinga (Nyeri) Mwenda Gataya (Tharaka-Nithi), Alexander Mundigi (Embu) and Veronica Maina (Nominated) were also present in the meeting that pledged to support Gachagua going forward only for them to make an about turn one month later by supporting his impeachment. Mathira MP Eric Wamumbi and Muranga County MP Betty Maina are some of the harshest critics of Gachagua at the moment although he was the Chief dowry negotiator during their wedding.. Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei who was considered a Gachagua ally and went ahead to cast aspersion on the 11 impeachment grounds that he faced surprised many after about one hour later he went ahead to vote in support of most charges signaling his change of tact bearing in mind he comes from the President’s backyard. Nominated Senator Karen Nyamu is one of those considered close to Gachagua, yet she surprised many when she decided to vote in support of the charges that Gachagua faced before the Senate signaling that she preferred being in Ruto’s camp stating it is a tough decision she was making. Three weeks ago, Senator Gataya hosted his colleagues Murungi, Wamatinga and Mundigi in Tharaka Nithi where they pledged support for Prof Kithure Kindiki as the Mt Kenya region Spokesman. Later Kindiki was nominated by President Ruto as the Deputy President and approved by Parliament. “The person given the position of Deputy President has transformed into a leader of a particular tribe, yet we want a leader who represents the face of the country, one who is acceptable in the entire country, we have resolved to have Prof Kindiki as our link to the National Government,” said Gataya. Wamatinga said Senators from Mt Kenya region will rally behind President Ruto’s development agenda so that the broad-based government he has formed achieves the vision that they had for Kenyans and that as leaders they had agreed not to engage in tribal politics. Murungi said that the region’s elected leaders had decided to rally behind Kindiki since he has distinguished himself as a national leader and that he was the best person to represent the region’s interest at the national table. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter During the impeachment motion against Gachagua, Senators Karanja, Wamatinga, Murungi, Mundigi, Gataya and Maina were among those who voted in support of most of the charges that he faced before the Senate leading to the senate Speaker Amason Kingi declaring that Gachagus had ceased holding office. Karanja said that she represents a county that is home to 42 tribes noting she had to make the right decision to ensure that there is peace in her county.",

Denuncian detención de tercer sacerdote nicaragüense en las últimas 24 horas\nEl sacerdote nicaragüense Fernando Calero fue detenido por la Policía, con lo que suman tres los curas encarcelados en las últimas 24 horas\ndiciembre 29, 2023 El sacerdote nicaragüense Fernando Calero fue detenido por la Policía , con lo que suman tres los curas encarcelados en las últimas 24 horas, denunció este viernes la abogada e investigadora nicaragüense exiliada Martha Patricia Molina .\n“Policía sandinista secuestra al sacerdote Fernando Calero, párroco de Nuestra Señora de Fátima (en el municipio de) Rancho Grande, (departamento de Matagalpa). Se desconoce su paradero”, señaló Molina, autora del estudio titulado ‘Nicaragua: ¿Una Iglesia perseguida?’, a través de su cuenta de la red social X (antes Twitter).\nPolicía sandinista secuestra al sacerdote Fernando Calero, Párroco de Nuestra Señora de Fátima Rancho Grande. Se desconoce su paradero. #iglesiaperseguidani #iglesiaperseguidanicaragua pic.twitter.com/QPcLvJs4vM\n— Martha Patricia M (@mpatricia_m) December 29, 2023\nSegún la investigadora, Calero fue “secuestrado por la Policía Nacional en su parroquia” tras haber mencionado al obispo encarcelado Rolando Álvarez , quien preside la Diócesis de Matagalpa, en una misa.\n“No existe una acusación formal en contra de él y no se tiene información de su paradero”, explicó.\nCalero se suma a los sacerdotes Carlos Avilés y Héctor Treminio , vicario general y tesorero de la Arquidiócesis de Managua , respectivamente, que fueron detenidos el jueves por la Policía y civiles.\nLa semana pasada, las autoridades detuvieron al obispo Isidoro Mora , a dos sacerdotes y a dos seminaristas.\nNi el Gobierno ni la Policía Nacional han confirmado o negado la presunta detención de los religiosos.\nEl cardenal nicaragüense y arzobispo de Managua , Leopoldo Brenes , aún no se pronuncia sobre esos arrestos.\nQuien sí lo hizo fue el exiliado obispo auxiliar de Managua , Silvio Báez , a quien el papa Francisco ordenó dejar Nicaragua en 2019 por motivos de seguridad, quien se declaró indignado por los encarcelamientos de tres sacerdotes de la Arquidiócesis de Managua .\nDos obispos, cinco sacerdotes y dos seminaristas presos En el caso de Mora , obispo de la Diócesis de Siuna, en el Caribe de Nicaragua , fue arrestado un día después de mencionar en una homilía al obispo Rolando Álvarez, condenado en febrero pasado a más de 26 años de prisión por delitos considerados traición a la patria tras negarse a abandonar su país.\nMora es el segundo obispo detenido en Nicaragua . El primero fue Álvarez, quien el 10 de febrero pasado fue condenado a 26 años y 4 meses de prisión, despojado de su nacionalidad, y suspendidos sus derechos ciudadanos de por vida por delitos considerados traición a la patria.\nEsa condena fue dictada un día después de que Álvarez rechazó subirse a un avión que lo iba a llevar, junto con otros 222 excarcelados políticos nicaragüenses, hacia Estados Unidos, lo que provocó la indignación del presidente Ortega, quien en una cadena nacional lo calificó de “soberbio”, “desquiciado” y “energúmeno”.\nLas relaciones del Gobierno de Daniel Ortega y la Iglesia católica viven momentos de gran tensión, marcadas por la expulsión y encarcelamiento de sacerdotes, la prohibición de actividades religiosas y la suspensión de sus relaciones diplomáticas.\nEl Gobierno de Nicaragua excarceló en octubre pasado a 12 sacerdotes y los envió al Vaticano, aunque entre esos religiosos no se encontraba el obispo Álvarez.\nNicaragua atraviesa una crisis desde abril de 2018, que se ha acentuado tras las elecciones de noviembre de 2021, en las que Ortega fue reelegido para un quinto mandato, cuarto consecutivo y segundo junto a su esposa, Rosario Murillo, como vicepresidenta, con sus principales contendientes en prisión.\nCon información de EFE",

    "text": "Internacional\nUn importante cardenal italiano sugiere que el papa Francisco podría renunciar por sus problemas de salud\nEl papa completa una semana hospitalizado por una neumonía en sus dos pulmones\nCompartir:\nJorge Mario Bergoglio, el papa Francisco, enfrenta problemas de salud.\nAFP\nEl papa Francisco, hospitalizado con una neumonía bilateral, podría renunciar \"si tuviera dificultades graves para cumplir su servicio\", pero \"su gran deseo es cumplir al menos el Jubileo\", asegura el cardenal Gianfranco Ravasi, cuando ha transcurrido una semana desde su ingreso en el Policlínico Gemelli de Roma.\n\"Creo que sí. Si tuviera serias dificultades para cumplir su servicio, tomará su propia decisión. Será él quien decida, por supuesto, tal vez pida consejo, pero la última palabra la evaluará por sí mismo, en conciencia\", explica Ravasi en el 'Corriere della Sera' al ser preguntado sobre una posible dimisión en caso de graves problemas de salud.\nY añade: \"Dejando claro que su gran deseo es cumplir al menos el Jubileo, el año santo dedicado a la esperanza que él siente como su gran momento\", añade.\nNo se pierda: Papa Francisco retomó su actividad laboral desde el hospital Gemelli en Roma\nEl estado del pontífice, ingresado el pasado viernes por una bronquitis por infección polimicrobiológica a la que se sumó una neumonía bilateral, ha experimentado una \"leve mejoría\", no presenta fiebre y sus paramétros hemodinámicos son \"estables\", según el último parte médico.\nRavasi destaca que el pontífice \"incluso con las dificultades ligadas a su edad y a su estado físico ha seguido teniendo una presencia única en el planeta, como quizás sólo Juan Pablo II. Su voz y su acción son reconocidas tanto por los creyentes como por los no creyentes\".\nEn este sentido, subraya \"el largo y exigente viaje que hizo en septiembre a Asia y Oceanía, a pesar de la silla de ruedas, a pesar de todo. Fue una gran lección, como la de los atletas paralímpicos. Demostró que se puede hacer cualquier cosa incluso en la fragilidad\".\nAhora \"se trata de entender qué pasará en el futuro. De todos, el propio Francisco explicó que ya había firmado una carta de renuncia al inicio de su pontificado, como hizo Pablo VI\", afirma, antes de calificar de \"notable que sus condiciones hayan sido explicadas con claridad\", con \"indicaciones muy precisas\".\nY sobre los falsos rumores sobre la salud del pontífice que circulan estos días, el cardenal es claro.\nOtras noticias: Doce estudiantes universitarios mueren en accidente de bus en Brasil\n\"Sobre todo en la red y en los sitios estadounidenses hay una fuerte corriente anti- Bergoglio: aunque nunca sea explícita, es evidente una expectativa de cambio que se expresa también a través de las 'fake news'. Hay una fuerte polarización\", asegura.",
