    "title": "Declan Rice falls at first hurdle after Mikel Arteta's prediction for Arsenal vs West Ham - Mirror Online",
    "text": "Declan Rice endured a night to forget as Arsenal fell to defeat against West Ham in his first league meeting between his new club and his former employers.\nRice, 24, decided to leave his former club at the end of the 2022/23 campaign in order to compete for major honours and became Arsenal's marquee signing in a club-record deal worth £105million back in the summer transfer window.\nAnd while the Gunners are in the thick of the Premier League title race and safely through to the knockout stages of the Champions League , Rice was on the losing side on Thursday night as West Ham beat Mikel Arteta's side 2-0 at the Emirates .\nAlthough Rice has enjoyed a fine start to his Arsenal career, he was challenged to increase his output in front of goal by Arteta prior to the match. The Spaniard told Amazon Prime Sport: \"That [goals] is something he can add. The areas and the spaces he occupies on the field is going to determine if he is elite and if he can do it more often. He’s playing in a more defensive role so it is more difficult to do that.\"\nUnfortunately for Arteta, Rice never looked like answering that call to arms against his old club. On the occasions in the second-half that he did foray forward, two shots from range failed to trouble Alphonse Areola, who enjoyed a relatively carefree night in the visiting goal. And just to compound Rice's misery, he gave away a penalty in added time which would have made things even worse were it not for a fine save from David Raya.\nThe result means Arsenal head into the final round of fixtures in 2023 two points behind Liverpool at the Premier League summit. They face Fulham next at Craven Cottage on Sunday.\nJoin the debate! What did you make of Rice's performance v West Ham? Let us know here.\nSpeaking prior to the match, Amazon Prime pundit Alan Shearer insisted that Rice has already proven he can be so much more than a defensive midfielder. He said of Arsenal's £105m man: \"His runs tells you he can be so much more than a six or a defensive midfielder.\n\"In terms of a midfielder and what you want from him in terms of tackling, protecting and goals, he can give you everything. For me, what they spent on him was an absolute bargain.\"\nFormer Premier League marksman Jermain Defoe echoed similar sentiments, adding: \" When we’re talking about the elite, people mention him along the likes of Steven Gerrard and with Stevie, he has played as a six, played as a 10 and can play all of these different positions.\n\"I think he can do that as well and he is the complete midfielder, I think he can play higher up and I believe if he does play higher up, he will score more goals like we saw last season for West Ham.\"\nJoin our new WhatsApp community!
