Ce mercredi 6 novembre en soirée, au hameau de Jouvenargues, sur la commune de Salles-sur-Gardon dans le Gard, une femme enceinte de 31 ans ressent de violentes contractions.\nAppelée en urgence, l'ambulance des pompiers arrive à toute vitesse pour mener la future maman vers l'hôpital d'Alès afin qu'elle accouche dans les meilleurs conditions, relate Midi Libre.\nMais la vie n'attend pas et le bébé semblait avoir une furieuse envie de voir le jour : après quelques kilomètres de route à peine, la jeune femme a dû perdre les eaux et commencer le \"travail\", obligeant et l'ambulance à stopper sa course et les pompiers à assister la trentenaire. Il faudra l'aide d'une ambulance du Samu appelée en renfort pour mener l'accouchement à bien, sur la route.\nUne fois l'enfant mis au monde, l'ambulance a pu reprendre sa route vers l'hôpital pour des examens plus approfondis. Maman et nouveau-né vont bien.",

    "text": "March Madness has arrived, and Alabama is a No. 2 seed in the 2025 NCAA Tournament. The Crimson Tide traveled to Cleveland, Ohio, on Wednesday, where it will face 15-seed Robert Morris in the first round on Friday, March 21. The matchup will tip off at 11:40 a.m. CT on truTV. The Alabama-Robert Morris winner will move on to the Round of 32 to take on either No. 7-seed Saint Mary’s or 10-seed Vanderbilt on Sunday, March 23 – also in Cleveland. This is Alabama’s 25th NCAA Tournament appearance in program history, with the Tide owning a record of 27-24 (.529). UA is coming off the program’s first-ever Final Four appearance and has made the big dance five consecutive seasons under head coach Nate Oats . Alabama enters the NCAA Tournament after losing to No. 1-seed Florida in the semifinals of the SEC Tournament. The Tide had won back-to-back games, including a win over the tournament’s No. 1 overall seed Auburn, before losing to the Gators in Nashville. In the defeat, Grant Nelson suffered a left knee injury and will be questionable for Friday’s first-round game. Before Alabama takes on Robert Morris at Rocket Arena, BamaOnLine staff members Charlie Potter, Tim Watts and Blake Byler share their thoughts on the Tide and March Madness. The Alabama-related topics discussed by the guys include: – Where does the NCAA Tournament rank among all major sporting events? – Final thoughts on the SEC Tournament – No need to overreact to Florida loss – Discussing Grant Nelson’s health – Alabama’s NCAA Tournament draw: good or bad? – How far do you think Alabama goes?

    "text": "IN THE WINTER MONTHS, it’s breathtaking to spot snow-capped Mount Washington on a bluebird day. But enjoying this splendor from surrounding peaks in the winter takes knowledge and preparation, as the weather can often be unpredictable and unrelenting.\nLuckily for outdoor enthusiasts, the Appalachian Mountain Club — a nonprofit organization that supports the conservation and stewardship of the outdoors — offers a wide array of guided courses and adventures, from skills-based programs like Introduction to Backpacking to guided cross-country ski outings.\nI attended a weekend-long Winter Outdoor Skills course at the AMC’s Highland Center in the heart of Crawford Notch. Arriving at the lodge on Friday, I met AMC guides Sarah Geiwitz and Gwen Landis for a brief welcome meeting to review the agenda for the days to follow.\nGeiwitz, a frequent recreator in the Whites, was attracted to the AMC’s mission. “It’s being part of a group that doesn’t just focus on the profitable side of bringing people outside,” she said. “The fact that folks are coming on trips like this, all of that money is going towards funding conservation research and other programs. I really love having that kind of tethered mission in there.”\nGeiwitz also appreciates working with people trying to learn about the outdoors. “I think my favorite part of my job is just meeting so many people who are able to be vulnerable and admit that they don’t know something or that they want to learn something from somebody else. I think that’s the coolest thing.”\nWe spent much of the first day in the classroom but covered a lot of ground. Our guides started with a detailed overview of the 10 hiking essentials, which ensure hikers stay safe in the woods and are able to rescue themselves if necessary. This list includes food and water, a map and compass and a first aid kit.\nOur guides also talked about less commonly referenced essentials, including various kinds of fire starters, clothing layers that can double as part of an emergency shelter, and tips for storing and purifying water in the winter.\nIn the afternoon, we grabbed our packs and traction devices for our feet, and headed in the direction of Mount Willard, an out-and-back hike that takes off from the Highland Center. On the route, we stopped periodically to review the seven principles of Leave No Trace, a guiding ethic for low-impact recreation in the outdoors.\nOn the trail, Geiwitz supplied hand gestures as an entertaining mnemonic device for each principle. No. 5, minimize campfire impact, was recalled by wiggling five fingers upright, mimicking the movement of a fire. No. 6, respect wildlife, involved curving three fingers near each side of one’s head to copy the antlers of a moose or deer.\nMy favorite was the last principle, No. 7: Be considerate of other visitors. With one hand we waved and with the other, we fashioned two fingers in a peace sign.\nA new orientation\nOf the six participants, three women were preparing for a trip to Nepal in April. Ragini Narasimhan, a hiker from Worcester, Mass., was hoping to gain more winter hiking experience, especially with the variety of gear the season demands.\n“I found out that this class was available in February, and I didn’t want to do it alone. So I kind of yanked Madhavi along and she called Neelima. And that’s kind of how we landed up here.”\n“I think we’ve heard so much about the cold weather. So I said, ‘OK, let’s get some experience here,’” said Madhavi Toke, of Worcester. “I don’t know if it’ll be this cold (in Nepal). But coming here experiencing this, it’s really rewarding.”\nEmerging from the cover of trees onto the exposed outlook at the summit of Willard, we were rewarded with clear views down Crawford Notch and of the frosty southern Presidentials, which seemed just out of reach across the highway.\n“It’s so pleasant for your eyes. You forget all your hard work of getting there,” said Neelima Veerapanenii, Toke’s sister, who was visiting the Whites from Atlanta.\nBack in the classroom the next morning, our guides discussed common symbols on hiking maps and the various natural features indicated by the shapes in the contour lines.\nAfter we felt comfortable making our way around the map, Landis described a hypothetical scenario to test our new knowledge: If we were hiking to Mount Adams on a day with potential for bad weather, which would be the better route: taking the Valley Way trail or Airline? The trick was assessing time in the alpine zone.\nIn the afternoon, the sunshine brilliant and warm, we hiked around Saco Lake and up Elephant’s Head, a lookout point with an uncanny resemblance to an elephant’s head, including ears and trunk.\nAt the summit, we each pulled out a map and compass, attempting to orient the map north. Kneeling in the snow, our maps spread out on the ground, we struggled keeping them flat with our compasses in the correct position, gusts of wind making the task challenging.\nOver the weekend, I chatted often with Michele Archambault from Waltham, Mass., a serious cyclist who was looking to expand her knowledge of the outdoors in winter. Archambault has recently returned to hiking, hoping to tackle the NH 52 With a View list in the coming years.\n“It’s fun to get into a room with a mix of people because I think we also learned from each other at times,” she said as we returned to the Highland Center on Sunday to debrief and say our goodbyes.\n“I think we have people who are newer, people who have been doing this for a while and people in the middle of the road. So it’s really fun to see things through the eyes of somebody who’s new to it too. And just feel excited for them.”\nThe AMC offers an extensive list of courses and guided outdoor recreation opportunities. For more information, visit\namcnh.org.",

    "text": "Even if the never-ending Brandon Aiyuk drama has stopped, we still have some fallout to discuss. By John Buhler | 11:19 AM EDT\nBrandon Aiyuk, San Francisco 49ers / Perry Knotts/GettyImages\nJust when you thought we were all done writing about Brandon Aiyuk this NFL offseason, think again. While he did return to the San Francisco 49ers on the same four-year, $120 million extension that was always on the table, apparently there was a trade proposed that nearly shook up the league. It involved the 49ers, the Denver Broncos and the Pittsburgh Steelers , with Denver pulling the plug.\nDianna Russini of The Athletic reported on Thursday evening that \"the 49ers only were willing to trade Brandon Aiyuk if they could get a top-flight WR to replace him. They offered a third-round pick to Denver for Courtland Sutton, and then would've dealt Aiyuk to the Steelers, but the Broncos declined the offer.\" The Steelers not have an available wide receiver to trade was always their biggest issue.\nSutton would have thrived playing in Kyle Shanahan's offense in San Francisco. Even though he has never been part of a good time in Denver, there is an outside chance the Broncos are better than we all expected. It really comes down to if first-round rookie quarterback Bo Nix is ready to be a star in the league. I think he will be okay, but I remain skeptical of him being as good as Denver thinks he is.\nI get why the Broncos did not agree to the trade, but I can feel the frustration for the other two teams.\nThe 49ers only were willing to trade Brandon Aiyuk if they could get a top-flight WR to replace him. They offered a third-round pick to Denver for Courtland Sutton, and then would’ve dealt Aiyuk to the Steelers, but the Broncos declined the offer.\nSo, he stays in SF.\n— Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) August 29, 2024 San Francisco still has its Super Bowl window open, but they must find a way to make it work already.\nDenver Broncos threw a wrench into a potential Brandon Aiyuk trade What I keep going back to was how inherently stubborn both parties within the 49ers organization were over this supposed contract dispute. John Lynch and the 49ers front office would not budge on their contract offer to Aiyuk, nor would they budge on what they wanted in return for a trade. At the end of the day, they won out, and everybody else lost. Optically, it was terrible for everyone involved.\nThe Steelers lose in this because they have an underqualified No. 1 wide receiver in George Pickens, and a bunch of random dudes behind him on the depth chart. Denver is going to lose a bunch this year, but I don't think trading away Sutton was going to make any bit of difference. Retaining him makes the Broncos slightly better, but not by a huge margin. And then there is San Francisco in this...\nFor whatever reason, it has always been beyond pulling teeth to get their star players extended under Lynch's guidance. This is a team that should be vying for the Super Bowl, but keeps coming up short. They won the NFC last year and could do so this season. However, they are running out of opportunities to get it done with this regime. Not winning one in several years will be viewed as failure.\nKeeping Aiyuk around helps, but he put this team through so much selfish agony over this offseason.\nThe 10 biggest betrayals in NFL history. dark.

    "text": "Tras una visita de inspección de tres días al Zoológico de Culiacán, Sinaloa, la Profepa aseguró 119 ejemplares de vida silvestre, más de la mitad de los 203 animales de su colección, en algunos casos porque no se pudo acreditar su legal procedencia, inexistencia de planes de manejo aprobados por la Semarnat en los últimos cinco años y/o faltas al trato digno y respetuoso.\nDebido a que la Procuraduría Federal de Protección al Ambiente (Profepa), carece de presupuesto e instalaciones propias para reubicar a la fauna, decidió dejar a los ejemplares en el mismo lugar, luego de imponer las siguientes medidas de urgente aplicación:\n- Limpieza y reubicación de ejemplares en cuarentena a otros recintos.\n- Limpieza del área de los felinos.\n- Atención médica a ejemplares con estado de salud frágil.\n- Seguimiento al tratamiento médico del orix cimitarra de edad avanzada.\nEn un comunicado de prensa, la Profepa aseguró que el león blanco que murió en el segundo día de inspección, y que se hizo viral en redes sociales por un video donde aparecía prácticamente en los huesos, en una jaula llena de excremento, \"tenía una enfermedad terminal\".\nLa necropsia arrojó como diagnóstico inicial un linfosarcoma torácico, que es un tipo de cáncer que afecta el tórax y no se observa a simple vista. Se enviaron muestras a un laboratorio para tener un diagnóstico más preciso\", indicó.\nAgregó que otros animales geriátricos deben ser atendidos o continuar con su tratamiento como un orix, un mono verde, dos chimpancés y dos jaguares.\nLa Profepa dará seguimiento al cumplimiento de las medidas impuestas y al estado físico de los ejemplares y volverá en el transcurso del mes de mayo para verificar los avances en sus condiciones y la legalidad del sistema de manejo, de acuerdo con lo establecido en el acta de inspección\", manifestó.\nCabe mencionar que desde el pasado 14 de abril, comenzaron a circular en redes sociales como X y Facebook fotografías y videos que denunciaban el abandono y mal estado de los ejemplares de vida silvestre en el Zoológico de Culiacán, y no fue sino hasta el 29 de abril, 15 días después, que la Profepa se presentó para realizar una visita de inspección.",
