    "text": "The [Olympics 2024](https://www.insidesport.in/olympics/tournaments/paris-olympics/) boxing draw is finally out a day prior to when the event begins, and it might not be the best news for the Indian pugilists, hoping to get a medal for the country. For starters, India’s two-time World Champion in the women’s 50 kg event, Nikhat Zareen has been handed a particularly tough draw, as she will be up against another World Championships gold medalist, China’s Wu Yu, in the second round. Tough Boxing Draw for Nikhat Zareen & Lovlina Borgohain Nikhat Zareen isn’t the only boxer at the receiving end of a tricky draw, as the 2020 Olympics’ bronze medalist in the 75 kg category, Lovlina Borgohain could be up against Li Qian of China in the second round. Whereas in the women’s 54 kg category, Jaismine Lamboria will face a hurdle in the form of Tokyo silver winner, Nesthy Petecio of the Philippines in the first round. That’s not the end. Preeti Pawar, the boxer in the women’s 54 kg category will be up against World Championships finalist Arias Castenada of Colombia in the second round. Tricky for Amit Panghal & Nishant Dev The Indian men’s boxers have been struggling to win in the last couple of years, and they have tricky draws too. 51 kg pugilist Amit Panghal, who was ousted in the first round in Tokyo 2020, will be up against African Games winner Patrick Chinyemba. On the other hand, Nishant Dev in the 71 kg division will be up against Jose Gabriel of Ecuador.",

    "text": "PERTH, Thursday 8 May 2025 – Greenpeace Australia Pacific is challenging Woodside on its troubling track record of harming WA’s oceans at its AGM, and urged shareholders to reject Woodside’s plans to drill for gas near Scott Reef.\nEnvironment groups and concerned community members will stage a protest outside Woodside’s AGM at the Crown Towers in Perth, and Greenpeace will also directly challenge Woodside’s leadership and its gas expansion plans during the AGM proceedings.\nDue to participate in Woodside’s AGM as a proxy shareholder, David Ritter, CEO at Greenpeace Australia Pacific said: “For the fourth year, Greenpeace has returned to Woodside’s AGM to expose its shameful environmental track record of harm to marine life, oil and chemical spills, and more. Woodside’s plans pose an unacceptable risk–this is a company that simply can’t be trusted with our oceans.\n“Woodside’s planned Browse gas field would entail drilling up to 50 wells as close as 2 kilometres from Scott Reef, home to nesting sea turtles, endangered pygmy blue whales and dusky sea snakes. Its new carbon dumping plans involve repeated seismic blasting over the next 39 years, which can deafen whales, near Scott Reef.\n“Woodside wants to turn Scott Reef into an industrial gas zone. We urge Woodside shareholders not to allow our precious oceans, whales, and turtles to face potentially irreversible harm, and call on Woodside to reconsider its plans.\n“From leaving its trash in the ocean until Greenpeace pushed it to clean it up to delivering a climate plan that faced unprecedented rejection by shareholders last year, Woodside’s environmental and climate governance under its current leadership is not up to scratch with what shareholders or regulators expect.\n“To protect the environment, Greenpeace is urging shareholders to vote down the re-election of board director Ann Pickard, who chairs Woodside’s sustainability committee. Between the multiple environmental failures on her watch and her history of leading Shell’s now-abandoned push to destroy the Arctic for oil , she does not inspire any confidence on sustainability.\n“We are also calling on the newly re-elected Albanese government to listen to the millions of Australians who rejected the Coalition’s gas fast-track plans, and voted for nature protection and a safe climate future powered by renewables. Sentiment for climate action was also clear in WA, with a surge in support for Independent candidates championing the shift away from climate-wrecking gas expansion.\n“In its second term, the Albanese government has an opportunity to stand up for oceans, marine life and clean energy. It must heed the evidence and reject Woodside’s proposals to extend its North West Shelf gas processing facility, and develop the Browse gas field. Doing so would protect Scott Reef from damage from industrial activity and prevent billions of tonnes of climate-wrecking emissions.\n“We are halfway through the critical decade for action on climate change, and in the middle of a climate and biodiversity crisis. Corporations, shareholders, and governments alike must put an end to polluting fossil fuel projects, and accelerate the transition to clean, affordable renewable energy.”\n—ENDS—\nFor more information or to arrange an interview please contact Vai Shah on 0452 290 082 or [email protected] .\nPhotos from the protest and file photos for editorial use will be available here after the protest: Google Drive folder",

    "text": "There’s a video on Instagram of a little boy walking through the streets of Gaza . He is talking to the camera. It is a beautiful, sunny day. If you didn’t speak Arabic, which I don’t, you might think the little boy was just sharing an innocent story about his life. But if you do speak Arabic, or are lucky enough to have it translated, you will understand that while he is telling a story about his life, it is not an innocent story.\nHe says, “Please stop the war.” He says, “We are suffocating. No food. No water. No nothing.” The video ends with him saying, “We used to have flour, but now we eat the grain that’s for the pigeons and chickens.” It is heartbreaking. And it is far from the only video like this.\nThere are many, many videos of Palestinian children, adults, and elders in Gaza testifying to the horrors they are currently suffering. And there are other videos that show the gruesome toil war takes on people’s bodies.\nI only know of these videos because of the global community of Palestinians who continue to speak up for their people, even if they have to deal with the consequences. Palestinians have lost jobs and been uninvited from spaces that they were previously accepted in, just because they spoke up for their people.\nThis is especially true in America.\nEven non-Palestinians have been fired or threatened with consequences for expressing solidarity with Palestinians. But this isn’t about the allies. This is about the courage of Palestinians in Gaza and outside of Gaza who have decided to speak out against the injustice they face—to quote a famous Muslim—“By any means necessary.” And this isn’t a new thing. I have known Palestinians who have been speaking up for their humanity, tirelessly for years. They do it when Palestinians are all over the news and when the world would rather look away.\nBut it’s much different since Oct. 7. That is why Palestinians are my heroes of 2023.\nI have much empathy for Palestinians at this moment. When they say something as simple as “Free Palestine,” some people hear that as a threat to Jewish people. Kind of like how some people hear “Black lives matter” as an attack on white people. We live in times that require nuance. (Shout out to the many Jewish people in my life who are both proud of their Jewishness and want liberation for Palestinians.)\nWhen I see Palestinians being ostracized and worse for their rhetoric when they talk about the liberation of their people, I can’t help but think about that same famous Muslim, Malcolm X, who was demonized in his lifetime for his rhetoric that advocated for the liberation of Black people. The years after his assassination only proved that he was right to be fiery. And America ended up understanding his point so well that it gave him the second highest honor this country can give—his face on a postage stamp. (The first highest honor is putting you on the money.)\nI know it is possible to advocate for your people without threatening or causing violence to others. I know it because I have done it and been a part of it. And I have seen it in the vast majority of Palestinians who are demanding justice for their people and accountability for the government of Israel.\nThat is why I want to say thank you to Palestinians right now for being loud and proud and defiant.\nIn the immediate wake of Hamas’ terrorist attack that killed 1,200 people and kidnapped 250 people, I saw Palestinians online bracing for Israel’s response. I saw Palestinians prepare as much as they could. I saw them put out explainers to help tell the story of that region from their (often ignored by western media) perspective. And I saw them warning the rest of us who are uneducated (or undereducated) on these issues of what was inevitably about to happen.\nThey told us that the IDF, Israel’s military, was going to rain down death and destruction on Gaza and that many innocent lives would be lost. They told us that the government of Israel would expand the attacks outside of Gaza and that Israel would use the horror of Oct. 7 as a justification to take steps they thought they couldn’t get away with otherwise. Palestinians also said that if this were allowed to happen, it would lead to turning Palestinians into refugees yet again, because they believe that if Israel was allowed to do these things, then Palestinans would never be allowed to return.\nAs of this writing over 20,000 people have been killed and around two million Gazans have been forced out of their homes and communities and told to move to other places in Gaza that also aren’t safe. I hope that little boy and his family are OK.\nI can’t quote the history of this region, chapter and verse. I have also seen that that doesn’t always matter in these discussions—because people on different sides aren’t always reading the same texts, so the chapters and verses don’t match up. But I do know that I want to live in a world where we all believe that innocent people, journalists, and hostages aren’t fair game in war. And I also know that I have seen and known many Palestinians who feel the same way.\nI wouldn’t have spent the last couple months thinking about these things without Palestinians refusing to accept their fate. Palestinians all over the world are putting themselves and their reputations on the line to demand that the world treat them with dignity and respect.\nThank you, Palestinians.\nPermanent ceasefire now. Release all hostages, those held by Hamas and held by the government of Israel. Black lives matter. Free Palestine.\nThe post W.

    "text": "Donald Trump will not get a new trial in his case against E. Jean Carroll, after federal Judge Lewis Kaplan on Thursday denied the former president's request. Trump was ordered to pay Carroll , an advice columnist, $83.3 million, after a New York jury ruled in January that he had defamed her in 2019 by denying her allegations of sexual assault. The ruling and heavy sum was on top of $5 million Trump already owed Carroll from an earlier case last year, in which a civil jury found he had sexually assaulted and defamed her again in 2022. Did Donald Trump rape E. Jean Carroll? Here's what a jury and judge said. Judge Kaplan rejected Trump's latest attempt to avoid paying over $80 million, finding in his rulin g Thursday the former president's motion for a new trial or judgment \"without merit\" and the amount in damages appropriate. \"Mr. Trump’s malicious and unceasing attacks on Ms. Carroll were disseminated to more than 100 million people,\" the judge wrote. \"They included public threats and personal attacks, and they endangered Ms. Carroll’s health and safety. The jury was entitled to conclude that Mr. Trump derailed the career, reputation, and emotional well-being of one of America’s most successful and prominent advice columnists and authors.\"",

    "text": "[Updated to include suggested additions to list. Thanks, everyone, for the suggestions and the kind remarks!] My son gets too much non-information from youtube videos, including repeated claims that Biden “hasn’t really done anything”. I promised I would provide him a list of Biden’s accomplishments so far. Using whitehouse.gov and DailyKos’s Good News Roundup — ”Boosting Biden” series, I made a bullet list of achievements. I also wanted something I could cut and paste if I read the same claim on social media. (You’re free to use, as well.) Let me know if I got anything wrong, or if I missed anything: Through Executive Orders, executive and administrative actions, and bipartisan legislation, Biden's accomplishments include: Economy/Employment Over the past two years, inflation reduced by two-thirds while unemployment kept low and economy grew by 3% Avoided recession Two of the strongest years of job growth in history Nearly 11 million jobs created since 2021 Created more manufacturing jobs in 2022 than in any single year in nearly 30 years 3.5% unemployment rate — the lowest in 50 years 750,000 new manufacturing jobs Near record low unemployment rate for Hispanics Near record low unemployment rate for African-Americans Record low unemployment rate for people with disabilities Awarded the most ever federal contracting dollars to small businesses and disadvantaged small businesses Incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act have spurred companies to spend nearly $300 billion on investments in manufacturing As a result of the CHIPS and Science Act, which provides incentives for domestic manufacture of technology, in just one year, U.S. companies have announced $166 billion in investments in semiconductors and electronics.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) clarified that environmental compensation (EC) is a policy tool grounded in the “polluter pays” principle, aimed at safeguarding the environment. Under this framework, fines are levied on those who breach environmental laws, and the funds collected are allocated for restoration efforts. The green body had sought details from the DPCC regarding the EC charges and their utilisation.\nAs per a PTI report, the committee said, “DPCC has received Rs 11,208.15 lakh (Rs 112.08 crore) as EC fund from April 2015 till November 20 (2024), and Rs 3,605.66 lakh (Rs 36.05 crore) has been utilised so far.”\nClick for more latest [Delhi news](https://www.news9live.com/city/delhi).

    "text": "CONTRIBUTED CONTENT — If you’ve been injured in an accident or suffered an injury due to negligence, you need someone who will support you, stand by you and fight for you, because your case – and your future – matters. It’s time to call the experts at We Win Injury Law.\nThe\nWe Win Injury Law team of attorneys Tyler T. Todd, S. James Park, Jaren C. Sandberg and Troy A. Sundquist have been representing personal injury clients in Southern Utah for over 20 years. Together, they’ve helped recover more than $9 million for the victims of car, truck and motorcycle accidents, slips and falls, dog bites, premises liability, medical malpractice and wrongful death.\n“We’re the injury lawyers that get results for you,” Todd said. “We win for you. That’s what we do.”\nTodd has 18 years of experience as a personal injury attorney. Prior to establishing We Win Injury Law in the summer of 2022, he helped bring cutting-edge legal tech to Southern Utah as a partner in 1LAW.\nIn fact, We Win Injury Law still occupies the former 1LAW office near the intersection of Bluff Street and Black Ridge Drive in St. George. The firm has opened additional locations in Hurricane, Cedar City, and most recently, Orem.\nSouthern Utah is their home, but Todd and his partners have their sights set on statewide expansion. Ultimately, their goal is to make a name for themselves as the go-to injury lawyers for the entire Mountain West.\nBeing a personal injury attorney isn’t just about the money, Todd said. Of course, We Win Injury Law always strives to maximize the money because in the world of injury law, money equals justice. But when they’re cutting checks to their clients, they know that no amount of money can fully erase the injuries that individual has suffered or restore the precious time they’ve lost at home and at work.\n“We’re always asking ourselves what more we can do,” he added. “We have empathy, and we really try to put ourselves in our clients’ shoes. It’s everything we’re passionate about; it’s why we’re lawyers.”\nWe Win Injury Law isn’t the type of firm that takes on hundreds of cases to settle quickly for an easy payday. Todd and his partners are all first-chair trial lawyers who fight for the settlements and verdicts that their clients deserve.\nThey evaluate every client’s situation individually. Few cases are too big or too small, and they never charge a fee unless they successfully recover money on a client’s behalf.\nSuffering a serious injury can turn your life upside down. The last thing victims of an accident need to worry about is how they’ll pay for the medical treatment they need to get back on their feet. When you don’t know what to do or where to turn, We Win Injury Law will be there for you.\n“Our attorneys and staff are all in on your case,” Todd said. “We’re your team from the time you call us until we cut your check. Trust us to take care of you.”\nIf you’ve experienced serious injuries due to negligence or carelessness, We Win Injury Law will help you fight for justice and move forward with your life.
