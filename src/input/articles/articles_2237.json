    "text": "Retired police sergeant on vacation with family rescues couple from sinking car CINCINNATI ( [WXIX](https://www.fox19.com/2024/06/21/retired-cpd-sergeant-family-rescue-unknown-tri-state-couple-during-florida-vacation/)/Gray News) - A retired Cincinnati police sergeant and his family saved an Ohio couple who just happened to be vacationing in the same area in Florida. The Ramsey family is from Ohio, while the Bell family lives in northern Kentucky. Up until June 11, the two families had no idea they lived so close to one another. Some might call it a coincidence. Others will say it’s luck, but these two families call it a miracle. Dean and Shana Ramsey recall the moment they said they almost drowned while vacationing in Siesta Key, Florida. Several streets flooded that day after the area received more than 11 inches of rain, an abnormal amount, according to Sarasota County officials. “You couldn’t see anything but rain and water,” Dean Ramsey recalled. With several cars stalled on the road, the couple said they tried to pull off on what they thought was land. “The water sucked us right into that lagoon and that was it,” Dean Ramsey explained. Watching in horror from their condo was retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant Mike Bell, his wife Ginger Bell and their three young kids. The Bell family responded. “We were able to stop, slow things down, and assess and make some decisions on how we were going to move forward,” Mike Bell said. That plan started with Mackenzie Bell giving valuable information to 911. “I remembered they needed to know the address, so that’s the first thing I told her and then I told her a car is in the pond and there was two people in there,” Mike’s and Ginger Bell’s daughter, Mackenzie Bell, said. Meanwhile, the retired sergeant and his wife, who is an emergency medical doctor, took action. “I went over to the edge of the water and realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” Mike Bell recounted from that moment. “At that time, Ginger exited the front door next to the pond. I look at her and said, ‘We need flotation devices.’” That’s where little Hank Bell came in. “I didn’t want them to die, so I ran as fast as I could,” Hank Bell explained. “I went up the elevator, which is extremely slow, and I knew there were stairs that were faster. So, I ran down the stairs.” Flotation devices in hand, the Bell kids handed them to their parents who were already in the water. “He went into the lady’s side and I went into the man’s side,” Ginger Bell said. “She was able to climb out on her own, but I put the boogie board right in front of her. She got her body on the boogie board and that’s when I started paddling and we kicked over to the side.” Ginger Bell ran into some issues helping Dean Ramsey. “When he was trying to get out, his foot got stuck, so he was on his back with one foot out and one foot stuck in the steering wheel,” Ginger Bell remembered. “I looked at her and I said, ‘I’m stuck, I can’t,’” Dean Ramsey remembered. “At that time, I was like, ‘I’m going down with the car,’ but she’s like, ‘Get out of this car! You got to get out! Kick your leg!’ I started thrashing my leg and my foot popped out.” The rescue took about five minutes. Back on dry land, the Ramsey family saw their rescuers as “guardian angels.” The families say they have plans to reunite in the near future. The Bell family wants to remind residents to always be mindful of their surroundings and assess a situation before getting involved. They said if your car is going in a body of water, roll down the windows or punch them out by hitting the corners. Those tactics could save a life. Copyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "The Biles family is super close, and Christmas has always been a time for them to come together and celebrate as a family. But this year, Simone Biles switched things up. Instead of spending Christmas with the family, she decided to head to Chicago to be with her husband, Jonathan Owens. She’s there to support him as he gets ready for the Chicago Bears game against the Seahawks at Soldier Field on December 26. While Biles is celebrating Christmas with Owens in a hotel room, the rest of the Biles family is sticking to their usual tradition!\nSo, Baby Biles, aka Ronni Louise Biles, who’s always hanging out with her “TT” (Aunt Simone), is spending Christmas down in Texas this year for her second one, and she’s loving every minute of it! Meanwhile, Simone’s sister, Adria Biles, who honestly looks like Biles’ twin, posted a sweet “Merry Christmas” message on her Instagram story.\nIn the video of her, Baby Biles is sitting on Adria’s lap, trying to say the alphabet but it comes out as pure gibberish. Then, their family dog hops in and starts nibbling on Adria’s hands. The best part? Adria and Baby Biles are wearing matching Christmas-themed pajamas. It’s too cute, especially since Baby Biles used to copy Simone’s outfits, but now she’s all about matching with Adria! And speaking of Simone, remember how she always said she wanted to spend Christmas with her family?\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nBack in 2016, Simone Biles made the most of her holiday. Then 19-year-old Simone Biles, tweeted that all she wanted for Christmas was to be with her family and she got her wish. Hours later, she posted some adorable pictures of her with her family on the beach on their vacation. But here’s the best part: the Biles family however didn’t just chill on the beach but went swimming with real sharks!\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nShe also went all out in her scuba attire, diving face-deep into the water. And now, fast forward to 2024, Biles is married, but still, her parents probably did miss her, but with Baby Biles already following her “TT,” she did fill Simone Biles’ absence with her cute antics.\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nSimone Biles chose love over tradition this Christmas—would you do the same for your partner?\nHave an interesting take?\nBaby Biles’ adorable moment that proves she’s next Simone Biles\nBaby Biles definitely knew how to fangirl!

After cheering her heart out in Paris, Baby Biles was back at it again, this time rocking a dress with a special message on it. In a photo she shared, Ronni Biles was seen wearing a dress while enjoying time at playschool, but what caught everyone’s attention was the message written on her attire: “But still I rise.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nAt first glance, it might have just seemed like any ordinary text on a dress, but those were the same words Simone had tattooed on her body. It wasn’t the first time Baby Biles had sported Simone-inspired looks. During the Olympics, Ronni made sure to show up to every event, cheering on her aunt in the most adorable way. Baby Biles even wore matching leotards with Simone, including the ‘Go For Glory’ uniform that Simone wore at the 2023 Xfinity Gymnastics Championships. Little Ronni even made the trip to California to cheer her aunt on as Simone started her redemption journey.\nWhen Simone’s “Gold Over America” tour came to Houston, Baby Biles was there, cheering on her aunt with all the excitement she could muster.

Sammi joined in, chanting “TT go, TT go,” matching Ronni’s excitement.

    "title": "Two Cork special schools to join pilot project to get therapists",
    "text": "Two Cork special schools are among 10 nationally to join a pilot project to have desperately-needed therapists introduced from January 1. Munster’s largest special school, [St Killian’s in Mayfield](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/munster/arid-41461171.html), along with the [East Cork Community Special School in Carrigtwohill](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/munster/arid-41222281.html), are to join the second in-school therapies pilot project from January, Minister Colm Burke told the Irish Examiner on Thursday night. St Killian’s Special School principal Sue Lenihan has told how students have been distressed since therapists were removed from schools in 2019. “Therapy in these schools is essential,\" Ms Lenihan said. Although St Killian’s school had no official notice of the move to join the pilot, Mr Burke, Minister of State for Public Health announced the decision on social media on Thursday evening. He wrote: “The focus of the pilot is to provide the effective delivery of enhanced in-school therapy supports to children in selected special schools. It will provide full-time therapist for the school.” He thanked his Fine Gael colleague Hildegarde Naughton, Minister of State for Special Education and Inclusion, for “her work on securing this vital support\". His announcement came hours before Taoiseach Simon Harris is to dissolve the Dáil on Friday, kicking off a three-week election campaign to polling day on November 29. Last month, interim funding of €40,000 was announced to cover the cost of private therapists at St Killian's Special School until December, following a year-long protest campaign by the school and parents. But St Killian’s principal Sue Linehan said there is a process they must follow before they can draw down that money which has been more difficult than they anticipated. On Thursday night, Ms Lenihan said: She said that getting the pilot scheme up and running had been a problem in other Cork schools already admitted to the first tranche of the in-schools therapies pilot programme. “So we don’t know what it looks like yet. \"We want to know the staffing levels, the allocation, who will be making decisions. It needs a whole process, not just ‘pay for therapists'. \"We’ll have to triage the most complex cases first, and check that process. There’s a lot involved.\" Although Ms Lenihan heard of some issues implementing the pilot programme in Cork, she said that it has been working well in schools in other counties. Mick Barry, Solidarity and Socialist TD for Cork North Central, accused the government of \"making grand announcements\" on the eve of the election but \"not delivering the goods.\" “St Killian's was promised €40K to hire therapists - but hasn't received any money yet,\" Mr Barry wrote. \"Now being told they will be included in 2nd tranche of a therapists in-schools pilot - when 1st tranche isn't up and running yet.\" St Killian’s Special School has 104 pupils. It needs a psychologist, a social worker, an occupational therapist (OT), a speech and language therapist (SLT), and a play therapist, Ms Lenihan said. Under the current funding scheme it will only be entitled to an OT and an SLT with possible access to play therapy and behavioural therapy. But Ms Lenihan said that any steps to return therapists to the school would be very welcome and are necessary. Anne Rabbitte, the minister of state for disability, previously told the Dáil that 10 schools will be selected in an extension of the in-schools therapies pilot project.",

    "text": "Home » Entertainment » Bollywood » January 5, 2024 Entertainment I am a big fan of Katrina Deccan Chronicle.| Lipika Varma\nPublished on: January 5, 2024 | Updated on: January 5, 2024 Actors Katrina, Vijay Sethupathi and director Sriram Raghavan speak out about their experience working on the film Merry Christmas Vijay Sethupathi and Katrina Kaif\nMerry Christmas, starring Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi and directed by Sriram Raghavan is a suspenseful dark thriller filmed simultaneously in Hindi and Tamil and produced by Ramesh Taurani and Sanjay Routray. Speaking at the first press conference of the film, coinciding with the trailer release, Katrina, Vijay and Shriram answered a barrage of questions from the media.\nWish list of directors/actors from Bollywood\nI don’t have any particular wish list — Isske sath kam karna hai, uske sath kam karna hai...aisa kuch nahi hai. Mostly, my directors choose their actors, I don’t discuss that. I am totally dependent on the filmmakers and of course the story – that’s my main concern.\nOn working with Katrina\nI am a very big fan of Katrina. I was very happy when I met her on the first day. She is a very dedicated actor. She asks many questions and thinks about the part. She may come with an idea but also listens to others’ suggestions. She puts in so much sensibility and effort into her performance. That’s the reason she has been in the industry for so long. I feel she is not only beautiful but also sensible.\nOn working with director Shriram Raghavan\nI met Shriram Sir for the first time in Melbourne. At first sight I felt he was a very serious man. I spent almost 30 days with him. I learned a lot from him. I understood him and knew what he was expecting me to do in a particular scene. I have learnt to utilize freedom of thought and expressions which I will carry forward while shooting for other films.\nOn choosing Merry Christmas\nIt has always been my intention to be associated with good stories. It’s not just the actors, the director is also of utmost importance. Working with director Shriram Raghavan was on my bucket list and this story was right for me as well.\nOn making a change from commercial entertainers\nYou will feel a little nervous or fearful when you step out of the commercial entertainer. But you need to overcome that fear. The experience is worthwhile for me as an actor and performer. I give my heart and soul to every film.\nExpectations from Merry Christmas\nI think every film has its audience. Also, Shriram Raghavan has a loyal fan following. We have made a film that we are very proud about. Waiting to watch the reaction of the audiences.\n\"I feel she [Katrina] is not only beautiful but also sensible.\"\n\"You will feel a little nervous or fearful when you step out of the commercial entertainer.\"",

Da questa mattina ci sono code, arrivate per il momento anche a una lunghezza di 5 chilometri tra Spotorno e Feglino, in direzione Francia, a causa dei lavori. Nel corso della mattinata il serpentoneè arrivato a undici chilometri. Lo ha segnalato la stessa concessionaria dell’autostrada, che invita alla massima prudenza visto il previsto aumento del traffico per il weekend.\nLa zona è interessata da lavori programmati, obbligando Concessioni del Tirreno (che gestisce la tratta) a chiudere l’entrata al casello di Spotorno in direzione Italia fino alle ore 14 del 16 novembre.\nMolte persone, provenienti dal Piemonte e Lombardia e diretti alle località turistiche del Savonese hanno scelto anche percorsi alternativi attraverso le provinciali interne, causando altrettanti rallentamenti. La conformazione delle direttrici extraurbane non riesce a sopportare un eccessivo carico di traffico. I disagi, è prevedibile, dureranno tutta la giornata.\nLeggi i commenti I commenti dei lettori Acquista da 0.7€ /sett\nVideo Video del giorno Como come New York, boom di turisti e si vende l'aria in lattina a 10 euro",
