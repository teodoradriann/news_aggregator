    "text": "California to receive over $12 billion for renewable hydrogen hub\nThe U.S. Department of Energy and the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES, agreed to fund a renewable hydrogen hub on Wednesday,\naccording to the office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The state will receive an initial $30 million from the government with future payments totaling up to $1.2 billion in federal funds from the U.S. Department of Energy, ARCHES said in a Wednesday statement. The additional $11.4 billion came from public and private fund matching, the release added.\nWashington, Minnesota, Texas, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Illinois will also host hydrogen hubs and receive federal funding,\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/13/biden-harris-administration-announces-regional-clean-hydrogen-hubs-to-drive-clean-manufacturing-and-jobs/ to the White House. Some of these hubs will cover multiple states. President Biden pledged $7 billion to fund hubs in seven states in October 2023 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. California has recently demonstrated experience producing and utilizing hydrogen fuel. Last week, the state unveiled what it said was the world’s first hydrogen-powered ferry in San Francisco Bay. Additionally, California-based Jobe Aviation announced its hydrogen-electric air taxi prototype conducted a successful 523-mile flight, with water as the only by-product.\nWhat will the hub do? The California hub is expected to launch a network of renewable hydrogen production sites to reduce the use of fossil fuels. By swapping gas for hydrogen in public transportation, heavy-duty trucking, and port operations, officials aim to cut about 2 million metric tons of annual gas emissions. That would cut about the same annual emissions produced by 445,000 gasoline-fueled cars, according to Newsom’s press release.\nThe hub will create an estimated 220,000 new jobs of which about 40 percent would be permanent, according to Newsom’s office. At least 40 percent of the project’s benefits will go to disadvantaged communities through community-directed investments and family-supporting jobs, his office added. ARCHES estimated civilians may save $2.95 billion in annual healthcare costs from the improved air quality brought about by hydrogen fuel.\nHow can hydrogen be used as a fuel? Hydrogen can generate energy through an electrochemical reaction rather than the combustion reaction that takes place when gas is burned in a car engine. Hydrogen fuel,\nrecognized as a clean energy source, only leaves behind water, as opposed to carbon dioxide from fossil fuels. Hydrogen can also be produced through several solar and wind-based methods.\nHowever, not all forms of hydrogen fuel production are considered clean energy processes. During the process of\nnatural gas reforming, natural gas is mixed with a synthesis gas composed of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. When hot steam is added into the mix, it kicks off a reaction and produces hydrogen molecules. This process produces harmful gasses like nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds. About 95 percent of all hydrogen is produced by natural gas reforming, https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-fuel-basics to the Energy Department. Once produced, hydrogen fuel can be used to power everything from buses and cars to private homes.\nDig deeper:\nRead Tobin Jacobson’s report on Biden introducing a tax credit for hydrogen producers last year.\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism,\nclick here.\nAn actual newsletter worth subscribing to instead of just a collection of links. —Adam\n[Sign up to receive The Sift email newsletter each weekday morning for the latest headlines from WORLD’s breaking news team.](/the-sift)",

    "title": "Una ONG denuncia la muerte de 14 personas en una zódiac al sur de Canarias",
    "text": "Al menos catorce personas han muerto ahogadas en una zódiac cuyos ocupantes llevan pidiendo auxilio desde las 14.00 horas de este jueves desde un punto del Atlántico situado a unos 55 kilómetros de Cabo Bojador, en la costa marroquí del Sáhara Occidental, al sur de [Canarias](/tags/islas-canarias/), porque su barca se desinfla y se hunden. Es la denuncia que realiza la activista Helena Maleno, fundadora de Caminando Fronteras, ONG que lleva toda la tarde de este jueves en contacto con los náufragos y que ha transmitido su posición a las autoridades españolas y marroquíes para que movilicen medios de rescate. Por la localización del incidente, ha asumido la emergencia Rabat. Maleno ha facilitado a EFE una foto enviada por los supervivientes que todavía siguen a flote, una imagen nocturna y borrosa en la que se ve a entre seis y siete personas sentadas a horcajadas sobre un flotador de una neumática, doblado y medio deshinchado. Y también un audio que le ha remitido una de las ocupantes de la patera. En él se escucha a una mujer decir en francés: \"Estamos aquí, Helena. Soy una mujer embarazada de nueve meses, estoy en el flotador (de la zódiac). Todos los chicos del medio (de la embarcación) han desaparecido, la gente está desapareciendo, hasta ahora no hemos visto a la Marina\". \"Toda la gente está desapareciendo. ¡Por favor ayúdennos, ayúdennos! ¡Estamos aquí, ayúdennos! Estamos sentados así en el flotador (se refiere a la imagen que adjunta con el audio). Es muy peligroso, el agua está entrando\", se lamenta la mujer Helena Maleno ha explicado a EFE que, según la información que han recabado sobre esa neumática, se trata de un grupo de 58 personas que salieron el miércoles desde la costa del Sahara hacia Canarias y que ahora se encuentran al suroeste de Cabo Bojador. Entre ellos, añade, hay siete mujeres (incluyendo a la embarazada) y dos niños. La portavoz de Caminando Fronteras denuncia que, hasta el momento, Marruecos no ha hecho llegar ayuda a los ocupantes de esa neumática, ni tampoco Salvamento Marítimo español ha intervenido. Por eso, expresa su temor a que ocurra lo mismo que el 21 de junio, cuando varias personas murieron al hundirse una zódiac al sur de Gran Canaria después de pasar toda la noche esperando a que llegara una patrullera de Marruecos, porque la emergencia la había asumido el Centro de Coordinación de Salvamento de Rabat. Y ello, a pesar de que un barco de rescate español había estado a solo una hora de distancia de navegación de ellos, socorriendo a otra patera, cuando ya se conocían sus coordenadas. Ese suceso dio lugar una denuncia de la Fiscalía de Canarias por presunto delito de omisión del deber de socorro contra los responsables del operativo en España, denuncia que desde este verano instruye un Juzgado de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, que ha declarado secretas las actuaciones.",

    "title": "Private Island With Luxurious 6-Bed Cottage Listed On Lake Muskoka",
    "text": "Are you in the market for a private island?\nIf yes, a newly-listed cottage country property should be high on your radar.\nPerched in the midst of Lake Muskoka, in a sought-after pocket of Ontario's coveted cottage country,\n1 Bass Island is a private island and luxurious remote abode all in one.\nThe value and privacy of the whole island is a rarity, highly sought after by the affluent and famous, ensuring solitude all to yourself. For those looking to entice the entire family to live on Bass Island, the land is approved to be further severed — with potential for five lots — where each lot can hold their own cottage and boathouse. The listing offers a serene hideaway alongside unrivalled custom designs and world-class amenities.\nAnd when we say world-class, we're not exaggerating. From a tennis court to a Nordic spa-style plunge pool and sauna, through to a helipad, this cottage compound has it all.\nSpanning the entire 11-acre Bass Island, this jaw-dropping property is home to a 6,652-sq.-ft main cottage, complete with six bedrooms (four of which have private ensuites), a two-storey boathouse with living quarters, a network of walking trails, and more.\nSpecs\n- Address:\n1 Bass Island\n- Bedrooms: 6\n- Bathrooms: 6\n- Size: 6,652 sq. ft on 11 acres\n- Price: $14,950,000\n- Listed By:\nBen and Dan Imrie, Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd. Brokerage\nOnce you've touched down on the helipad, you're invited to meander through the professionally landscaped property to arrive at the island's main event: a three-storey cottage featuring stunning contemporary designs (both inside and out) and expansive floor-to-ceiling windows that afford residents unobstructed lake vistas.\nInside, you're greeted by a light-filled interior, defined by modern design touches that elevate the already-stunning space even further.\nA sunken living and dining room pairing, which overlooks the lake, serves as the heart of the home, offering a cozy hub for friends and family to gather. And with various walkouts to a spacious upper deck, the space mingles seamlessly with the surrounding natural environment.\nSharing the open-concept space, a dazzling kitchen overlooks the living area, boasting high-end appliances and marble galore. And while each of those aforementioned bedrooms is retreat-like in its own right, the primary — with a spa-like ensuite and direct lake views — is particularly swoon-worthy.\nOur Favourite Thing\nOur favourite thing about this property is, naturally, that it includes its own private island. And, the incredible sense of seclusion considered, it's still ultra easy to access. With East Bay Landing and Mortimer's Point Marina a quick boat ride away, all you have to do is ensure you pack the boat.\n(Although, there's always the helipad...)\nNow for the true call of any cottage: relaxation and leisure.\nWhat really sets this property apart is the sheer number of top-tier creature comforts it offers residents and guests. On the home's lower level you'll find a jetted workout pool, hot tub, cold plunge, cedar sauna, steam room, and massage shower. Plus, there's no shortage of activities, with walking trails, a tennis court, and a three-slip boathouse for launching a day of water sports.\nWith built-in fun and relaxation, you'll likely never want to leave Bass Island. But when it's time for a food run or you want to spend an afternoon shopping locally, vibrant Port Carling is a scenic boat ride away. Plus, the region is home to several high-end golf clubs and stunning hiking trails.\n\"Rare Muskoka gem\" is a common moniker for upscale cottage country getaways, but few truly earn the descriptor. This sprawling cottage estate is a rarity, and a way to make your mark on the Muskoka landscape. Combining prime location with sleek designs and an incredible slew of amenities, you simply won't find another cottage like it any time soon.\nWELCOME TO 1 BASS ISLAND\nENTRY\nLIVING AND DINING ROOM\nKITCHEN\nBEDS AND BATHS\nLOWER LEVEL AND AMENITIES\nOUTDOOR\nPhotography: Ben Carlin,\nMuskoka Virtual Tours\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________",

Defensa de Alianza Lima, Erick Noriega quedó rendido ante una figura que firmó contrato con Alianza Lima por toda la temporada 2025.\nÚnete a nuestro canal de WhatsApp\nAlianza Lima regresó a los entrenamientos este jueves, pensando en el reinicio de la Liga 1 2025. El equipo blanquiazul tiene toda la ilusión de poder cortar la racha de títulos sin ganar en el balompié nacional, luego de la llegada del flamante técnico argentino, Néstor Gorosito. El ex Tigre asumió esta gran responsabilidad y los hinchas confían en su labor al mando del elenco victoriano.\nPUEDES VER:\n[Waterman estremecería el mercado y ficharía por subcampeón de Libertadores: \"Hay acuerdo\"]\nErick Noriega resaltó la labor del DT de Alianza Lima, Néstor Gorosito\nPrecisamente, quien hace poco elogió el trabajo de 'Pipo' Gorosito en el cuadro íntimo es el defensa de la selección peruana, Erick Noriega. A través de una entrevista con Jax Latin Media, el zaguero de 23 años señaló que el estratega de 60 años \"sabe cómo tratar\" al futbolista, además, todo el grupo se siente contento con su fichaje por Alianza Lima.\n\"El profe (Néstor Gorosito) sabe cómo tratar al jugador, nos entiende, nos comprende, el plantel está bastante cómodo con él\", declaró el futbolista de Alianza Lima. Por otro lado, el 'Samuraí' también fue bastante claro al revelar cuáles son las exigencias que les pide el entrenador con pasado en River Plate de Argentina.\n\"El sol siempre lo hace más complicado porque te desgasta rápido, pero creo que el trabajo que están haciendo los profes está bastante bien para lo que viene en la próxima temporada. Nos están haciendo correr bastante para tener una mejor resistencia dentro del campo, va a ayudar\", sentenció el defensa del 'equipo del pueblo'.\nNéstor Gorosito firmó por Alianza Lima para la temporada 2025\nVale resaltar que, el argentino Néstor 'Pipo' Gorosito fue anunciado como el nuevo DT de Alianza Lima por todo el 2025 tras la salida del rosarino, Mariano Soso. El ex Olimpia de Paraguay emocionó a los hinchas de la escuadra blanquiazul con lograr el título nacional a final de temporada, durante su presentación en Matute.\n\"Para mí una alegría enorme venir a dirigir a Alianza Lima, un grande de Sudamérica. Un grande de Perú. Dios quiera que podamos sacar las cosas adelante, salir campeones\", expresó Gorosito a los medios.\nNéstor Gorosito: palmarés como director técnico\n- Olimpia de Paraguay - Torneo Clausura 2020\n- Tigre de Argentina - Copa de la Superliga 2019\n- Argentinos Juniors de Argentina - Ascenso a Primera División 2014",
