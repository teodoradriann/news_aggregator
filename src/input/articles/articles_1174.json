    "title": "Favorite character from Disney's 'Up' becomes a Funko 'Pop with a Purpose,' supporting Ed Asner Center, autistic community - ABC7 Los Angeles",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- \"Up\" is one of Disney's most popular movies. We all had a soft spot for the animated \"Carl Fredricksen\"... even though he was a bit grumpy. The character voiced by actor Ed Asner is now a Funko \"pop\"... and a portion of the sales of this collectible figure will benefit the Ed Asner Family Center, which helps the autistic community. Jen Ryan is the director of retail stores at Funko. \"We are announcing a drop of our new Pop with a purpose. Carl, from 'Up!' A portion of the proceeds from the pop will go directly to the Ed Asner Adult Center and Family Center.\" Asner's son, Matt and daughter in law Navah, are behind the program. \"The Ed Asner Family Center was created by Matt and me. We have six children, three autistic,\" said Navah. \"And we really felt like there was something missing in the special needs community that supported the entirety of the family, not just the special needs individual. We're here for today celebrating our job training program called The Academy\". \"This group of wonderful adults has been working with us here at Funko,\" said Ryan. \"And we have had the best time with them. They get a chance to really engage with people and talk about the product. They also learn cash handling skills.\" \"The special needs community, the Autistic community has an 85% unemployment rate which is unheard of. So we want to change that dynamic,\" said Matt. \"We want the Ed Asner Family Center to be a part of that. If you ask people who have employed autistic people, they will all tell you that they are the best employees. I mean, it's a positive.\" Ryan agrees. \"It's huge to let everybody understand that everybody in this world has differences and we need to accept each other how they are and just grow together and be a more united world.\"",

    "title": "Underground Cave Found On Moon Could Serve As Lunar Base",
    "text": "This cave could one day serve as an ideal location for a lunar base, as it would help shelter astronauts from the moon’s harsh conditions. NASA An artist’s rendition of the moon tunnels.\nFor more than 50 years, scientists have hypothesized that there may be a network of lava tunnels beneath the moon’s surface. Now, using advanced image processing technology, researchers from the University of Trento in Italy have uncovered the first evidence that one of the moon’s approximately 200 known surface pits connects to a deep underground cave.\nResearchers now hope that future studies will explore the possibility of human habitation in these lunar tunnels.\nResearchers Examine Old Evidence With New Techniques NASA / GSFC / Arizona State University The Mare Tranquillitatis pit crater, where the cave was identified.\nOriginally hypothesized 50 years ago, lunar tunnels have long been the subject of debate in the scientific community. In 2009, scientists discovered an unusually deep pit on the moon’s surface, offering support for the possibility of a hidden network of lava tunnels. But it wasn’t until this year that researchers published concrete evidence of a lunar pit connecting to a deeper channel.\nJust recently, researchers from the University of Trento in Italy applied new technology to scans of the moon’s surface taken from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2010. Using advanced signal processing analysis techniques, the team reanalyzed scans taken of a pit within the moon’s Mare Tranquillitatis region — and determined that it connects to a deep underground tunnel.\n“Thanks to the analysis of the data we were able to create a model of a portion of the conduit,” Leonardo Carrer, a researcher at University of Trento, stated in a translated press release . “The most likely explanation for our observations is an empty lava tube.”\nThis newly discovered cave measures about 148 feet wide and between 98 and 262 feet long, though scientists believe it could be part of a system that extends even deeper beneath the moon’s surface.\n“These structures had been hypothesized for over 50 years,” Lorenzo Bruzzone, coordinator of the research, said in the press release. “But this is the first time ever that we have demonstrated their existence.”\nMoon Tunnels As A Future Home For Humanity University Of Trento A 3D model of the underground tunnel.\nAccording to the researchers’ study , these lunar tunnels may serve as the perfect base for future explorers.\n“This discovery suggests that the [Mare Tranquillitatis pit] is a promising site for a lunar base, as it offers shelter from the harsh surface environment and could support long-term human exploration of the Moon,” the authors wrote.\nThe moon is an extremely inhospitable environment, both for humans and for machines. During the day, the moon can reach temperatures of 260 degrees Fahrenheit. During the weeks-long lunar nights, temperatures can reach -280 degrees.\nThe moon also experiences solar and cosmic radiation 150 times stronger than that on Earth, and faces increased risk of meteorite strikes. These factors pose major risks to any future human operations on the moon.\nHowever, the discovery of lunar tunnels provides an intriguing remedy for this problem. Future explorers could shield themselves from space debris, radiation exposure, and unsafe temperatures by setting up operations underground.\nWith this hope in mind, researchers expressed the importance of further analysis of the moon’s underground caves.\n“Radar tests of lunar tunnels therefore become extremely important to deepen knowledge on the extension and shape of the conduits in view of the exploration of lunar caves through future robotic missions,” they explained in the press release.",

    "title": "X's privacy dilemma: When blocking is not really blocking anymore",
    "text": "With social media constantly evolving, privacy concerns are growing, especially in jurisdictions like India, where data privacy is a fundamental right. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act) introduces strict privacy regulations for digital platforms in India. Recently, X announced a controversial update to its block function: blocked users will still be able to view posts if they are public, though they cannot engage with them through likes, replies, and reposts.\nThis change raises serious privacy concerns, particularly in India, where users highly value control over their personal data.\nThe DPDP Act mandates that data fiduciaries, including X, must process personal data with clear consent, transparency and adequate safeguards. By allowing blocked users to view posts without consent, X risks violating several provisions of the DPDP Act, including requirements related to informed consent, unauthorised access and data breach protection.\nApplication of the DPDP Act to X\nThe DPDP Act is built on principles such as user consent, data security, and transparency, ensuring users control their personal data. However, X’s update to the block feature appears to violate these principles by allowing blocked users to view public posts. These violations under the DPDP Act, 2023, are discussed as follows.\nFirstly , under Section 6 of the DPDP Act , any processing of personal data must be based on informed, freely given consent. In X’s case, users who block others assume that the blocked individuals cannot access their content. By allowing blocked users to view public posts, X risks violating Section 6. The DPDP Act stresses transparency in processing personal data, yet X has not offered users an opt-in or opt-out for this change. Users should have been given the option to consent to blocked users viewing their public posts. Without this, the update does not comply with the Act’s informed consent principle.\nSecondly , the DPDP Act defines unauthorised access ( through a combined reading of Sections 6, 8, and 9 ) as processing personal data without the user’s knowledge or consent. With X’s update, blocked users can view posts, creating unauthorised access. Users who blocked someone expected complete restriction, including both interaction and visibility. Users who blocked someone did so under the expectation of complete restriction, which includes both interaction and visibility. By enabling blocked users to view content, X risks violating Section 8, which mandates data fiduciaries to prevent unauthorised access to personal data. This access, without the user’s explicit consent, undermines their privacy expectations and could lead to misuse or abuse of personal information, especially in cases where the blocking was done to avoid harassment or maintain personal safety.\nThirdly , X’s update could raise concerns related to data breaches under Section 9 of the DPDP Act . A personal data breach occurs when there is unauthorised access or disclosure compromising data confidentiality. Allowing blocked users to view content could inadvertently facilitate a breach, especially when sensitive information is shared in public posts. For instance, if a user discusses private matters in public posts, their blocked contacts could access this information without the user’s knowledge, leading to unintended disclosure. This is especially concerning in India, where data privacy is heavily regulated, and breaches can attract significant penalties.\nFourthly , the update’s most significant impact is on user control over their data. By changing the block feature, X compromises the level of control users expect over who can access their content. Users block individuals to prevent them from viewing or interacting with their posts; altering this understanding without clear consent damages the platform’s trustworthiness. The DPDP Act grants users the right to protect their data under Chapter III , and by weakening the block function’s privacy controls, X risks eroding user confidence in its commitment to data privacy and compliance.\nConsequences for X under the DPDP Act\nFirstly , under Section 33 of the DPDP Act , the Data Protection Board of India can impose monetary penalties for violations. If X is found to have breached provisions related to unauthorised access, consent or data breaches, it could face substantial fines. The DPDP Act’s Schedule of Penalties allows the Data Protection Board to impose penalties based on the severity of the violation. These penalties vary depending on factors like the gravity of the breach, data volume and impact on users. For instance, if X’s update leads to a large-scale privacy breach, where blocked users gain access to personal data without consent, penalties could be substantial. The Board may also consider whether X took steps to mitigate the breach or comply with the DPDP Act upon learning of potential violations.\nSecondly , as a data fiduciary under the DPDP Act, X has obligations to protect user data, as detailed in Section 8 . These include preventing unauthorised access, maintaining transparency about data usage and ensuring data security. The new block feature may compromise these obligations by allowing blocked users to access content without the blocker’s consent, thereby breaching privacy expectations. X could face compliance challenges related to:\nInadequate consent mechanisms : The update does not provide users with a clear option to consent or object to blocked users viewing their content, violating the DPDP Act’s consent requirements under Section 6 .\nTransparency and user rights : Users must be informed of any changes in how their data is accessed or shared and should have the ability to control that access under Section 11 . Failure to meet these requirements, especially with sensitive data, could lead to legal scrutiny and penalties.\nData breach notification requirements : If allowing blocked users to view posts is deemed an unauthorised data breach, X would need to notify the Data Protection Board and affected users under Section 9 . Failing to do so promptly could increase the severity of penalties.\nThirdly , beyond monetary penalties, failure to comply with the DPDP Act could damage X’s reputation in India, a crucial market for the platform. User trust is vital for social media platforms and privacy breaches, particularly those involving sensitive data, can erode that trust. The Data Protection Board may also issue directives to bring X into compliance, potentially requiring the platform to reverse the block feature update or enhance privacy controls. Additionally, under Section 13 of the DPDP Act , users have rights to redress, which could lead to a surge of grievances from those affected by the update. X would need effective mechanisms to handle these grievances to avoid further penalties and legal action.\nAliases paradox\nX’s update can also be examined through the Aliases Paradox , which reflects the contradiction where users share personal information publicly while expecting selective control over who can access it. In X’s case, users may want to make public posts but use the block function to control who can view their content, especially those they have intentionally blocked. This paradox highlights the tension between public accessibility and restricted access expectations.\nHowever, X’s update breaks this illusion of selective control, revealing the contradiction of the Aliases Paradox. Users who relied on blocking as a privacy measure now face a situation where blocked contacts can view their public posts, even without interaction. This change disrupts the delicate balance users attempt to maintain between public sharing and selective privacy, worsening the paradox.\nUnder the DPDP Act, 2023, X’s policy amplifies this dilemma by compromising informed consent. By allowing blocked users to view content, X is breaching the implicit contract users assumed - that they could post publicly while exercising selective control. Such actions violate transparency and consent requirements, as they create unauthorised access and blur boundaries of user control, deepening the paradox and exposing users to unforeseen risks.\nX’s update, therefore, exacerbates the Aliases Paradox by removing a vital privacy safeguard without explicit consent or transparency, violating the DPDP Act’s privacy standards and potentially leading to non-compliance consequences.\nNeeraj Dubey is the Founder and Managing Partner of The Valid Points Law Offices.

    "text": "On Monday at the stroke of midnight, the minimum wage for tipped and non-tipped workers in Ohio will increase.\nThe minimum wage in Ohio will go up by 35- cents per hour for non-tipped workers starting Monday to $10.45 an hour. Tipped workers will get a 20-cent boost to $5 and 25 cents an hour in 2024.\nThe state's minimum wage has increased every year since 2006 when Ohioans passed a constitutional amendment to raise it over time.\nBut some say the increase isn't nearly enough\nAdvocates for the poor say, even with the increase, it’s still not a living wage. They point out that the average two-bedroom apartment in Ohio runs from $600 to $1,300 a month, depending on the location. That means it would take working at least two 40-hour weeks at the new minimum wage to earn enough to afford an apartment in the least expensive area of Ohio and more than three weeks to earn enough to get such an apartment in a more expensive Ohio city. And in many cases, there is a shortage of affordable housing.\nEfforts underway to increase it\nA coalition of groups has been working to put a $15 an hour minimum wage proposals before voters in 2024.\nSome politicians, like U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) have advocated for a $15 an hour minimum wage in the past. So it is likely to be an issue that's brought up in the U.S. Senate campaign this fall, as Brown is up for re-election.",
