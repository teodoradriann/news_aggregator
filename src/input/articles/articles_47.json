    "text": "Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn had two break-ins within a four-month span at their Los Angeles home, the \\\"Death Becomes Her\\\" star has revealed. The couple discovered the first incident, which occurred in 2020, after coming home from dinner. \\\"We were gone maybe two hours and 20 minutes or something,\\\" Hawn told Kelly Ripa on the \\\"Let's Talk Off Camera\\\" podcast. The two turned on the TV and Hawn called it a night. Upon entering her bedroom, though, she came across a well-rummaged site. “They had broken in from the balcony to our bedroom, our closets, and they completely knocked down my door, which was a safe door, so they’re very, very sophisticated,” Hawn said. \\\"They got a lot of my goodies, if you know what I mean. So I’m thinking, ‘Oh, my God. Well, the chances are, I guess that’s it.'\\\" Hawn, 78, assumed that would be the first and only time, because \\\"odds are that's not gonna happen again.\\\" Four months later, though, she was home alone with her dog when she heard a \\\"big thump upstairs,\\\" leaving her to wonder, \\\"What the hell was that?\\\" \\\"Was that a sonic boom?\\\" she said. \\\"Did somebody jump somewhere? I mean, and as it turned out, the next day, we discovered that they were trying to get in my bedroom while I was in the house.\\\" Now, Hawn has amped up security. \\\"I'm never without a guard,\\\" she said. Hawn and Russell have been together since 1983 but have not married. Their blended family consists of sons Oliver Hudson, Wyatt Russell, Boston Russell and daughter Kate Hudson.",

    "text": "FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. — Downtown Flagstaff is busy with visitors from all over the country visiting and enjoying the sights for the holidays.\nBut there was something missing. Just ask the Rushton family, who traveled from Florida to see the Grand Canyon. They were hoping the city would look a little different when they arrived.\n“This is still really fun but I would really want snow,” said the youngest Rushton family member.\nThere was no snow in sight—not in the streets, the trees, or even on Humphreys Peak, which sits just north of Flagstaff. While the Rushton's still enjoyed their visit, they were slightly disappointed.\n“We would have loved that even if it was just a flurry something magical for us Floridians that would be very nice,” Rushton said.\nIt's not just the visitors who are disappointed. Those living in Flagstaff, like Luciano Svetlitze, were also hoping for a white Christmas and New Year.\n“I wish there was snow,” Svetlitze said.\nHe moved to Flagstaff about six months ago from Gilbert wanting to escape the hot summers. While he admits the snow can create some hassles, Svetlitze doesn't mind having to deal with the slick roads or shoveling the snow from his driveway.\n\"If I'm going to be cold and there's no snow, I'd rather be in Gilbert,\" he said.\nThere is at least one spot where people can enjoy the snow, that's because it's been mostly man-made. Arizona Snow Bowl was packed with skiers and snowboarders on Thursday. Angie Grubb, the marketing manager, said the last snowfall they experienced was on Christmas day.\nSince opening in November, she said crews have been working around the clock to create more snow and open up additional trails.\n“Definitely experiencing some La Nina conditions,\" Grubb said. \"Typically throughout December we usually see a drier year then a lot of our snowfall tends to come in January, February and even March,” Grubb said.\nSnowboarders visiting from out of state including Christian Rogers from Las Vegas, Nevada said he noticed a difference compared to freshly fallen snow, he didn't mind it.\n“I mean it’s not the best it could be but it works,” Rogers said. \"We had a great day, can’t complain for the time of the year.”\n>> Download the 12News app for the latest local breaking news straight to your phone.\nClose Ad",

    "text": "Makers of a new generation of European electric aircraft are struggling to raise money. Europe's flying taxi dreams falter as cash runs short\nVolocopter The VoloCity made demonstration flights in Paris over the summer\nOne of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service. Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city. It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights. While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going. Talks to borrow €100m (£83m; $106m) from the government failed in April. Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China. Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft. Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions. However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.\nLilium Lilium's radical design involves jets which can be angled for vertical take-off\nOne of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium. The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme. Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight. The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world. It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.

    "title": "New York Palestinian Restaurant Faces Backlash for Using ‘From the River to the Sea’ on Its Menu: ‘Openly Genocidal’",
    "text": "Controversy is on the menu at a newly opened Palestinian restaurant in New York City that labeled its menu's seafood section \"From the river to the sea\" — a slogan Jewish groups recognize as antisemitic and people in the neighborhood are calling \"openly genocidal,\" according to a report. Ayat opened earlier this month in the Ditmas Park section of Brooklyn and its menus feature the phrase over the eatery's selection of branzino, red snapper and shrimp and salmon kebabs. Residents of the neighborhood, on their Facebook page, took offense at the owners, Abdul Elenani and Ayat Masoud, for using the controversial phrase in their menu, with one user condemning it being \"openly genocidal,\" the Daily Beast reported. The American Jewish Committee says the expression symbolizes \"control over the entire territory of Israel's borders, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.\" The full phrase, \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" \"is a rallying cry for terrorist groups and their sympathizers, from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) to Hamas, which called for Israel’s destruction in its original governing charter in 1988 and was responsible for the October 7, 2023 terror attack on Israeli civilians,\" the organization says. Elenani says that's not how she sees it, saying rather it's a non-violent plea for justice. “Our interpretation on it is just simply freedom and rights to the Palestinian people between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea,” he told the Daily Beast. “We’re just against the Zionist mentality of, like, eliminate or flatten Gaza now.” “Our neighbors are Jews, our friends are Jews, we work with Jewish people all day every day. We do not hate Jewish people. It’s the opposite,” he added. “Judaism and Islam, they are the two most similar religions.” Dahlia Schweitzer, who moved to Ditmas Park in 2020, told the outlet that the \"river to the sea\" language offends her, and dismisses the restaurant's claim that \"they're just advocating for freedom.\" \"They’re poking the hornets’ nest,\" Schweitzer said. “The best analogy that I could think [of] is if a restaurant that had Southern food had the Confederate flag on their menu, and tried to spin it as ‘Oh, this is just Southern pride.’ And it’s like, you know, don’t be coy,\" she said. Elenani said he tried to explain his position on Facebook but that he was censored by the social network administrators. He said he wanted to impress that his \"brand\" consists of two elements: “Number one is that I will always mention the occupation of the Palestinian people. And number two is that we will always advocate for peace,\" he said. The slogan has been part of demonstrations by pro-Palestinian protesters on college campuses after Hamas militants invaded Israel on Oct. 7.",

    "title": "Las águilas renuevan en O Berbés pese a la menor presencia de gaviotas",
    "text": "Las seis águilas de Harris de la empresa Indigenom Project SL continuarán sobrevolando el puerto pesquero los próximos años tras hacerse efectiva la renovación del contrato del servicio de control de fauna en los edificios de la lonja tras concluir el proceso administrativo abierto por la Autoridad Portuaria (APV) por 105.490 euros en varias anualidades. La misma compañía también trabaja en el mismo servicio en Peinador, aunque en este caso también con halcones. En O Berbés se trata de evitar que las gaviotas se acerquen a los centros de trabajo donde se manipula el pescado fresco, en tanto que en Peinador se busca que las aves no pasen por la pista ni sus alrededores para evitar problemas con las aeronaves, lo que pese a todo ocurre de vez en cuando. Precisamente ayer delegaciones de todo el mundo hicieron un recorrido de madrugada por O Berbés para conocer su funcionamiento y también a sus guardianas aladas, que despertaron la atención de la ministra de Pesca de Angola.\nEn O Berbés, el trabajo se inicia a las cinco de la mañana, cuando la lonja está a pleno rendimiento con la llegada de barcos y furgonetas con pescado de otros puertos, así como contenedores que cargan para llevar el producto vigués a mercados de toda España y a ciudades europeas. Las normas sanitarias -gallegas, españolas y comunitarias- son muy estrictas, cada vez más, y aunque hay muchas menos gaviotas, la APV mantiene un control permanente que dura en cada jornada hasta mediodía, cuando la actividad prácticamente cesa. Desde la empresa de control de fauna se señala que ha habido una evidente y visible disminución de aves, que achacan a que ahora todos los residuos se depositan en contenedores específicos colocados por la Autoridad Portuaria. “Antes, era habitual que los desperdicios acabaran tirados por el suelo o en los muelles, en especial las tripas de pescado, y eran un alimento para las gaviotas. Ya no hay, así que también tienen menos posibilidades”, explicaba ayer uno de los miembros del grupo de cetrería, de guardia a las diez de la mañana. Tras probar varias fórmulas, finalmente optaron por el águila de Harris como la más adecuada para mantener a raya la invasión de otras aves, porque mejora sus prestaciones a los halcones e impone mayor respeto. En cambio, en Peinador los halcones son adecuados, si bien también hay águilas en “plantilla”.\nEl presidente de la Autoridad Portuaria, Carlos Botana, puso en valor la importancia del sector de la logística del frío en Galicia como “un caso de éxito en Vigo”. Según recordó, el Puerto cuenta con cerca de una treintena de almacenes frigoríficos, con una capacidad de almacenamiento superior a los 800.000 m3, que juegan un papel fundamental en su posición como referente de la pesca fresca y congelada a nivel mundial. De madrugada acompañó en la lonja a una delegación de Angola, encabezada por la ministra de Pesca, Carme do Sacramento Neto, y una docena de importadores de pescado congelado de Japón, Singapur, Filipinas, EEUU, Colombia y Perú, delegaciones de Francia, Uruguay, Argentina, Canadá, Prochile, y una representación de Productores del Reino Unido. Además, mantuvo reuniones de trabajo y encuentros como con el ministro de Pesca de Namibia, Derek James Klazen.",

The company wrote that the new project will enable crews to repair aging wastewater management tunnels constructed in 1937 and 1958.\nCrews were expected to complete the tunneling aspect of the project by April 2025, according to documents from the L.A. County Sanitation Department from July 2024. County staff aimed to complete the project by 2027 and activate the new tunnel by January 2028.",

    "text": "A bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced a bill Thursday that would protect creatives and their content from their unauthorized use by artificial intelligence and its developers.\nIn part , the Content Origin Protection and Integrity from Edited and Deepfaked Media Act, or the COPIED Act, aims to require developers or providers of AI tools to allow content owners to attach \"content provenance information\" to their work, which the bill defines as \"machine-readable information documenting the origin and history\" of a digital asset.\nIf the content has provenance information attached, the bill would prohibit using it to train AI models or generate AI content as well as its removal or alteration without the creator's approval. This gives the creator the ability to protect and set terms of use for their work, including compensation, the bill states. Internet platforms, search engines and social media companies would also be prohibited from interfering with content provenance information in the same ways.\nRELATED STORY | Tennessee is the first state to protect musicians from AI infringement\nOwners of covered content and state attorney generals would be able to sue violators who use work without permission under the COPIED Act.\nTo enforce the bill, the National Institute of Standards and Technology would be required to develop guidelines and standards for content provenance information, watermarking and synthetic content detection. This, the bill states, would promote transparency in whether content has been touched by AI.\nU.S. Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, and Martin Heinrich, D-New Mexico, who is also a member of the Senate AI Working Group, introduced the bill.\nSen. Heinrich said if enacted, the COPIED Act would provide necessary technical tools to \"help crack down on harmful and deceptive\" AI in content.\n\"Congress needs to step up and pass this legislation to protect the American people,\" Sen. Heinrich said.\nRELATED STORY | Billie Eilish, Stevie Wonder, more sign letter calling for AI defenses\nA number of groups representing the creative community have endorsed the bill. Among them, the actors' union SAG-AFTRA, Nashville Songwriters Association International, Recording Academy, National Newspaper Association, Artist Rights Alliance and more provided statements of support to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.\nMany of those groups have already signed contracts with other major organizations such as TV studios and music labels to protect themselves against AI. In March, SAG-AFTRA ratified new contracts to require permissions before altering actors' voices or using them to model AI, among other provisions.",
