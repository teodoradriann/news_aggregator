    "text": "By Sebastian Griffin ,\n1 hour ago 2015's Rough Fire in Fresno County, California, was started by lightning and burned over 151,000 acres. (Courtesy of the U.S. Forest Service)\nCalifornia, like many of the states in our region, has faced some of the most devastating wildfires in recent history. The “Golden State” is leading the charge in wildfire prevention by integrating cutting-edge technology into its fire management strategies . One of the most significant advancements in this area is the use of AI-trained cameras that monitor the landscape around the clock, identifying fires before any traditional emergency calls are made.\nAs previously highlighted by Carl Smith of the Governing , on the morning of Sept. 5, 2023, a wildfire ignited in a redwood forest in Humboldt County, California. This fire was swiftly identified by one of over a thousand AI-trained cameras deployed across the state. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) was alerted immediately, allowing firefighters to contain the blaze to just a quarter of an acre. This rapid response is the fruit of a decade-long effort to harness AI in wildfire detection and prevention.\nIdaho’s potential for significant fire activity increases with hot, dry conditions\nAs wildfires in the United States, and especially in our Mountain States region , become more frequent and severe, the need for advanced detection systems has never been greater. AI offers a solution by continuously monitoring vast areas, analyzing data for early signs of fire, and alerting human operators when potential fires are detected. This system not only improves response times but also leverages historical data to enhance accuracy and reliability.\nWhile the benefits of AI in wildfire detection are evident, it is essential to implement these technologies with appropriate oversight. Ensuring that AI systems are transparent, accountable, and effective requires a framework that balances innovation with regulation. Oversight helps maintain the integrity of AI applications, ensuring they meet safety standards and public expectations without compromising privacy or efficiency.\nNeal Driscoll, a professor at UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography and director of ALERTCalifornia, emphasizes the importance of data-driven decisions. ALERTCalifornia, a public safety program, utilizes multidisciplinary expertise and supercomputing resources to enhance understanding and response to climate-driven events, including wildfires.\nALERTCalifornia’s highlights : “The AI platform is a new tool in the toolbox and allows data to drive firefighting decisions, which saves lives, protects habitats, and infrastructure. In its first season, the AI platform was utilized in all 21 CAL FIRE Dispatch Centers and detected over 1,200 fires across California, beating 911 call reporting over 30% of the time.”\nExpanding the free market’s involvement in AI can drive further innovation and efficiency. Private sector companies, driven by competition and profit incentives, can develop and implement advanced technologies more rapidly and cost-effectively than government entities. By creating a regulatory environment that encourages private investment and innovation, the government can utilize the strengths of the free market to enhance wildfire prevention efforts.\nPacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) is an example of private sector involvement in AI development for wildfire detection. The utility company supported the initial AI work for California’s forest surveillance network, recognizing the potential to mitigate risks and liabilities associated with wildfires. Such collaborations between public and private entities exemplify how market-driven initiatives can complement government efforts in addressing critical issues.\nCalifornia’s AI-driven wildfire detection system serves as a model for other states and regions facing similar challenges. The integration of AI with traditional fire management practices can significantly improve early detection and response, reducing the impact of wildfires. States like Washington, Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho should be looking to replicate California’s success by adopting similar technologies and strategies.\nThe use of AI in wildfire detection represents a significant advancement in California’s efforts to prevent and manage wildfires. By expanding the role of the free market and fostering public-private partnerships, we can drive innovation and efficiency in wildfire prevention. As we continue to face the realities of increasing wildfire risks, leveraging AI with proper oversight will be essential in safeguarding our communities and natural resources.\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\nThe post Artificial intelligence can be our first line of defense in limiting the effects of wildfires appeared first on Idaho Capital Sun .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Every word Met Office has said as it warns up to 7cm of snow is possible in Nottinghamshire - Nottinghamshire Live",
    "text": "The Met Office has warned up to 7cm of snow could fall in parts of Nottinghamshire this weekend. It has now upgraded its [weather](https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/weather) warning from yellow to amber and said there could be 'persistent and heavy' snow on Saturday, January 4 and Sunday, January 5.\nThe warning comes into effect at 6pm on Saturday and is in place until noon Sunday. A separate yellow warning for snow and ice is valid from noon on Saturday until 11.59pm on Sunday evening.\nThe agency has warned of 'disruption to transport and other services' as well as the possibility of power cuts and communities being 'cut off'. A spokesperson said: \"Snow will become [persistent and locally heavy](https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/weather) as it pushes south to north across the warning area.\n\"As well as snow, a period of freezing rain is also likely bringing some [hazardous travel conditions](https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/weather), before milder air follows across all areas by Sunday morning.\" An amber health alert has also been issued by [the UK Health Security Agency](https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/significant-warning-issued-cold-alert-9831403), warning of the impact on the [NHS](https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nhs) and health services.\nMet Office chief forecaster Jason Kelly said: “This weekend will bring a range of weather hazards to the UK, notable snow accumulations, freezing rain, ice and heavy rain as well as some gusty conditions.\n“We have issued a number of severe weather warnings, including Amber warnings for snow and ice in parts of England and Wales. Some significant accumulations of snow are possible across parts of Wales, the Midlands and northern England in particular, where 5 cm or more could accumulate fairly widely, with as much as 20-30 cm over high ground of mid and north Wales and potentially 30-40 cm over parts of the Pennines. This, accompanied by strengthening winds, may lead to drifting of lying snow.”\nMet Office Nottingham weather forecast - January 3 - January 7, 2025\nFriday, January 3 day\n\"A cold, frosty morning will be followed by a largely fine day with sunny spells. Although isolated wintry showers are possible, mainly in the west or into Lincolnshire coasts. Staying cold, with temperatures into the low single figures of Celsius. Maximum temperature 4 °C.\"\nFriday, January 3 night\n\"Another very cold night with clear spells and a widespread frost. Perhaps the odd wintry shower spreading southeast overnight, along with some low cloud and isolated mist or fog patches. Minimum temperature -4 °C.\"\nSaturday, January 4\n\"Frosty start, with any early cloud and lingering mist or fog patches gradually clearing. Cold day follows, with hazy sunshine. Cloud thickening further ahead of snow spreading north after dark. Maximum temperature 4 °C.\"\nOutlook for Sunday, January 5 to Tuesday, January 7:\n\"Snow accumulating before dawn Sunday. Milder air then spreading north with rain and icy patches likely, followed by a rapid thaw. Breezy. Cold again Monday, Tuesday with isolated wintry showers.\"\nMet Office amber weather warning - Valid from 6pm on Saturday, January 4 until noon on Sunday, January 5\nThe Met Office said: \"Snow and freezing rain will likely lead to disruption to transport and some other services. There is a good chance that power cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage. Travel delays on roads are likely, stranding some vehicles and passengers.\n\"Some road closures and longer journey times possible. Some delays and cancellations to bus, rail and air travel are likely. There is a good chance that some rural communities could become cut off. Untreated pavements and cycle paths likely to be impassable.\"\nIt added: \"Snow will become persistent and locally heavy as it pushes south to north across the warning area. As well as snow, a period of freezing rain is also likely bringing some hazardous travel conditions, before milder air follows across all areas by Sunday morning.\n\"Whilst there is some uncertainty in details, 3-7 cm of snow is likely for much of the warning area, with locally 15-30 cm for the higher ground of Wales and the southern Pennines. Freezing rain could lead to ice accretion in places, especially parts of Wales, before the milder air leads to a rapid thaw of snow and ice in the south of the warning area through Sunday.\"\nThe Met Office has also urged people not to drive and said power cuts were possible. It added: \"It is safer not to drive in these conditions, but if you need to make an essential journey, consider alternative forms of transport, to keep you and others safe. If you must drive, do this more safely by: using dipped headlights; accelerating gently, using low revs and changing to higher gears as quickly as possible; starting in second gear to help with wheel slip; maintaining a safe and steady speed, keeping distance from other vehicles; using a low gear to go downhill, avoiding braking unless necessary; steering into skids, not taking your hands of the wheel, and avoiding slamming on brakes.\n\"People cope better with power cuts when they have prepared for them in advance. It’s easy to do; consider gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essential items.\"",

    "text": "06 jun, 2024 A política interna está ao rubro com as eleições europeias à porta. Mas nestas eleições jogam-se destinos mais importantes do que a escolha entre Sebastião Bugalho e Marta Temido. Mais do que saber se o Governo vai ganhar ou perder com os resultados de domingo, importa conhecer que Europa vamos ter no Parlamento Europeu, a partir desse dia. Se a extrema-direita crescer como nunca, nunca a União Europeia esteve tão perto da desintegração. O populismo de extrema-direita fez das fraquezas europeias bode expiatório para quase tudo o que de mau sucede, em cada um dos países membros. Os movimentos de extrema-direita europeus têm sido encorajados e insuflados a partir do ‘trumpismo’, com a exceção da Frente Nacional, em França, que já cá anda há muitos anos. Os ventos de extrema-direita fazem também o encanto de Moscovo (que ativamente os estimula) ao conduzirem à desestabilização interna da Europa e à desejada quebra da unidade europeia no apoio à Ucrânia. A extrema-esquerda não é menos perigosa para o projeto europeu. Sucede, porém, que neste momento o esquerdismo perdeu cor e votos e não constitui ameaça eleitoral comparável. Em todo o caso, os movimentos de extrema-esquerda europeus, incluindo em Portugal, são também herdeiros legítimos e diretos do marxismo-leninismo, cujo expoente foi a União Soviética. E embora tais movimentos sejam agora mais fracos nas urnas do que no passado, eles criaram condições objetivas para que o populismo de extrema-direita crescesse e desse cartas. Ao pressionar para uma rutura cultural - fraturante, permanente e insaciável - a extrema-esquerda (e assim foi, manifestamente, o caso da extrema-esquerda portuguesa) abriu espaço para uma reação feroz de quem, ao longo dos anos, se sentiu (mal ou bem) agredido ou mesmo violentado. O terreno para o crescimento da extrema-direita foi semeado de forma incauta precisamente pela extrema-esquerda. Anos e anos de políticas fraturantes abriram espaço para alternativas de sinal ferozmente contrário. Perante o combate cultural permanente da extrema-esquerda - que até pretende eliminar a objeção de consciência em determinados atos médicos, impondo a sua visão do mundo a quem manifestamente não a partilha - também o centro político fraquejou na maioria dos países da União. O centro (mais à direita ou mais à esquerda) perdeu valores, desnatou-se e acomodou-se. Pragmático, deixou cair convicções e valores, na esperança de não perder o suposto comboio da ‘modernidade’. Veja-se, com raras exceções, como se comportaram muitos dos representantes do chamado centro político ao longo dos anos, em temas como aborto e eutanásia. Veja-se como o centrismo europeu consentiu ou defendeu que as raízes judaico-cristãs fossem afastadas do texto constitucional da União Europeia (cujos pais fundadores, já agora, eram democratas – cristãos publicamente assumidos). Sem convicções claras, o centro político também contribuiu, objetivamente, para os crescimentos da extrema-direita; ainda que boa parte dessa chamada extrema-direita use as convicções num sentido puramente utilitário – ganhar votos e aceder ao poder. A defesa do direito à greve das forças policiais (e também das Forças Armadas?) mostra como o populismo da extrema-direita é até mais forte do que a sua ideologia. Ideologicamente a extrema-direita nunca poderia defender um tal direito. Como, se invoca a cultura cristã, nunca poderia a extrema-direita propor uma linguagem e uma política violentas face aos imigrantes que antes de mais são pessoas com a mesma dignidade humana que tinham ou têm os nossos emigrantes quando procuravam ou procuram no estrangeiro, aquilo que não encontravam ou não encontram em Portugal. De resto, Portugal é hoje um país envelhecido, fustigado por décadas de políticas anti natalistas que a extrema-esquerda orgulhosamente impôs e o centro resignadamente consentiu. Por isso, sem imigração (embora com regras claras e combate às redes de tráfico humano) o futuro será mais difícil. Já hoje, sem imigrantes, boa parte da economia portuguesa entraria em colapso. A complexidade que o mundo vive exige escolhas responsáveis. Os tempos aconselham o voto em partidos moderados, dando-lhes o respaldo eleitoral necessário para evitarem uma Europa ainda mais frágil que faria as delícias de Moscovo, Pequim e, seguramente, de Donald Trump.",
