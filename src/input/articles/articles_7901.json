    "text": "HANOI (AFP): Ninety-six-year-old Hoang Vinh proudly shows off a metal badge picturing a communist soldier holding a rifle, a reminder of the battle he fought in Vietnam's Dien Bien Phu to push out French colonisers.\nVinh is one of the few surviving veterans of the battle in Vietnam's northwestern hills, which unfolded over eight weeks in 1954 and ended in a decisive victory for the Viet Minh that ultimately brought an end to the French empire in Indochina.\n\"So much sweat and blood, so much sacrifice and hardship for a badge like this,\" Vinh told AFP from his central Hanoi apartment, where photos of late president Ho Chi Minh were displayed in a glass-fronted cupboard.\nVinh enlisted when he was only 19 years old and without knowing he would spend a large chunk of his working life in combat, fighting first the French and then the United States until the early 1970s.\n\"As a young man, I joined the army to fight the French because they invaded our country, our home,\" Vinh said as Vietnam and France prepared to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the battle.\n\"I found the right path to contribute to my country's independence. I have no regrets, no questions on what happened.\"\nVinh was part of an anti-aircraft gun regiment which, together with the infantry, brought down 62 French aircraft during the campaign that ended on May 7, 1954.\nThe Dien Bien Phu badge, emblazoned with the red military flag of Vietnam, was given to all those involved in the 56-day campaign.\nAS IT IS TODAY ... A woman holds an umbrella to protect herself from the sun while tending to buffalo next to a rice paddy field in Vietnam's Dien Bien province on Saturday, May 4, 2024. - AFP\n- 'No one complained' -\nHo Chi Minh proclaimed national independence in 1945, prompting a lengthy resistance campaign against French colonialists.\nHis Viet Minh forces then made what Vietnam terms a \"strategic decision\" in late 1953 to eliminate France's biggest defence stronghold in Indochina, Dien Bien Phu, appointing general Vo Nguyen Giap as commander in chief of its largest military campaign.\nSoldiers, civilian volunteers and frontline workers were mobilised to transport weapons, artillery and other crucial supplies through jungles and across mountains to reach the remote battle site near the border with Laos.\nNgo Thi Ngoc Diep, aged just 17 and from Hanoi, was given the \"precious opportunity\" to march through the night for several weeks with soldiers, carrying five kilograms (11 pounds) of rice and a shovel.\nShe moved only in darkness, between 5 pm and 2 am each day, to avoid being seen by the enemy.\n\"My task was to talk, crack jokes and keep up the spirits of the soldiers,\" Diep, now 86, told AFP.\nBetween marches, \"we sang, danced or performed role plays, using mostly patriotic and traditional folk themes\", said Diep, wearing her military uniform and playing a homemade musical instrument built from the lids of cigarette lighters -- a replica of one she used at the time.\n\"We did not have enough to eat, not enough warm clothes to wear, not enough blankets, and we slept on rice straw,\" Vinh recalled.\n\"But no one complained. We talked and sang to cheer ourselves up. It was really fun.\"\nAround 55,000 people, most drawn from Vietnam's elite forces, were directly involved in the fighting, according to official figures.\nAnother 260,000 people helped with logistics, including walking 21,000 bicycles loaded with rice, salt, oil and weapons to Dien Bien Phu.\n- Bodies scattered -\nVietnam says 10,000 soldiers and civilians were killed or went missing fighting for the \"earthshaking\" victory.\nFrance says 3,000 of their troops were killed in the battle.\nVinh recalled the moment a bomb hit his camp close to Dien Bien Phu.\n\"I saw my comrades killed on the spot, their bodies scattered on tree branches,\" he said. \"I hated those that took the lives of my fellow soldiers.\"\nThe memories of those bloody months live on for him and Diep, who both survived without a scratch.\nEach has visited France with their families, but Vinh said he did not tell anyone about the battle while he was there.\n\"Though I am proud of my life, I am no hero. I just performed my service as a military man for my country, an ordinary mission with nothing to show off about, even towards the French.\"\nGiven the chance, Diep said she would like to shake hands with French war veterans.\n\"We can never forget history, but we should close the past. The painful chapters should be left behind us,\" Diep said.\n\"We are friends.\" - AFP\nOpen Modal ×",

    "text": "2023-12-30 03:32:03 A little over a year ago, the Ministry of Defense embarked on a mission whose tasks are more than well known to the Spanish military: the training of soldiers from other countries, something they have done and do in Iraq, Mali, Afghanistan, Central African Republic… But on this occasion the classes would be taught in Spain and the students would be civilians and military personnel from Ukraine. Then, the Department led by Margarita Robles calculated that by the end of this year 2023, the Armed Forces would have trained just over 2,000 Ukrainians. However, the Government’s commitment to this mission of the European Union (EUMAM-Ukraine) has raised that number to around 3,500 students. This is one of the milestones that Defense considers more than accomplished, as highlighted in its assessment of the year ending, in which it also makes a brief review of the military and humanitarian material sent to Kyiv. “Since the beginning of the conflict, the Ministry of Defense has shown its support for Ukraine by sending defensive material, humanitarian assistance and training,” they recall without forgetting to add the data that places our country as one of the most active in this training operation: «Since the beginning of the war with Russia, some 3,500 Ukrainian soldiers have been trained by our Armed Forces, which have offered more than 80 training modules, making Spain the third European contributor to the training of Ukrainian personnel ». A training that for many of the students was their first contact with the military world, since many were civilians recruited for the conflict. Spanish uniformed personnel from both Armies and the Navy have participated in this mission – and for the moment will continue to do so – and have acted as teachers. On average, between 300 and 400 troops have been involved. Ukrainian soldiers receive training at the Toledo Infantry AcademyJavier Fdez.-LargoPHOTOGRAPHERS Thus, the Army has taught courses on Basic Training, Maintenance of Armored Tracked Transport Vehicle, Crew Member of the “Leopard” Battle Tank (already completed), Health Care for Combat Casualties, Countering Improvised Explosive Devices, Assault Operations in Forest, Combat Sapper, Advanced Combat Course, Demining, Operations Planning, Military Operations in Urban Terrain, “Hawk” Anti-Aircraft Missile, 105/14 Howitzer Crews, Advanced Artillery Observer, Geospatial Analysis and Cyberdefense. The Navy personnel, for their part, have been instructors in the Basic Training and Operations Planning courses, with the participation of units such as the Marine Corps. Along with them, those from the Air and Space Army teach the “Aspide” Air Support Driving and Anti-Aircraft Missile modules. Many of these courses focus on the management of weapons donated by Spain to the Ukrainian Army. Toledo Infantry Academy A school with classes spread throughout the country and directed by the Operations Command (MOPS). For its management, it has the “Toledo Training Coordination Center” (TTCC), a structure for direction, coordination and execution of training plans orchestrated from the Burgos General Headquarters and whose largest classroom is the Toledo Infantry Academy. There is, among others, the Combat Training Unit, which provides basic training for civilians who will enlist in the Ukrainian Army and other more specific training such as health. Support that, as confirmed by the Government, will continue and will adapt to the requests of the Ukrainian authorities, who are the ones who transmit their training needs to the TTCC. In fact, the Council of Ministers approved, at its meeting on Tuesday, the agreement that extends until December 31, 2024 the participation of units of the Armed Forces in military missions. And one of those that will continue is EUMAM UKRAINE, with 300 instructors “on average” in a contribution that “varies depending on the training modules activated,” details the Executive. [[H3:Misión: ayudar a los que «sufren la invasión enemiga»]] Currently, Spain’s participation in this EU training mission is in its third rotation, with the “Guzmán el Bueno” Brigade X of Córdoba as the reference unit and with Brigadier General Ignacio Olazábal Elorz at the head of those 300-400 teachers who on average participate simultaneously. In his speech on the day he took charge of the operation, on December 5, he highlighted the “honor” and “challenge” of “joining this commitment in order to contribute to the improvement of the combat capabilities of those who suffer the enemy invasion in their home. #Spain #trained #Ukrainian #soldiers #civilians",

    "text": "Joe Burrow Seems Excited About Bengals Possibly Playing International Game in 2025\nThe Cincinnati Bengals may be among the NFL teams set to play an international game during the 2025 regular season.\nEarlier this week, the mayor of Madrid, accidentally let slip that the Spanish capital would be hosting an NFL game for the Miami Dolphins in November of 2025. There's been plenty of speculation online that the Bengals would be their opponent, and it seems as if Joe Burrow is on board with the idea.\nBurrow posted to his Instagram story and made clear that he's hoping Cincinnati makes the trip to the world-renowned Santiago Bernabeu Stadium this autumn.\n\"Bengals v. Dolphins in Madrid? Please be true,\" wrote Burrow on Instagram.\nIt's not confirmed that the Bengals will be Miami's opponent in Madrid during the upcoming season, but Burrow is clearly hoping that's the case.\nSince Burrow was drafted in 2020, Cincinnati has not played a game outside of the United States. The last time the Bengals played internationally was in October of 2019 when they took on the Los Angeles Rams at Wembley Stadium in London.\nAmong the host stadiums for international NFL games in '25 include Arena Corinthians in Sao Paolo, Brazil, both the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Wembley Stadium in London, U.K., Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany, Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland and the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid.",
