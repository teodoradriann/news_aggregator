    "title": "The warmest December in Tompkins County history",
    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Tompkins County, New York from 1901-2000 was 26.3. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Tompkins County, New York experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Tompkins County, New York history.",

    "text": "Ninja Gaiden 4 é anunciado para PC, PlayStation 5 e Xbox Series X|S\nO mais novo jogo principal da franquia em 13 anos; lançamento no 4º trimestre deste ano\nO Team Ninja e a PlatinumGames acabam de anunciar Ninja Gaiden 4 para PC, PlayStation 5 e Xbox Series X|S. O jogo, que terá o Xbox Game Studios como publisher, estará disponível no 4º trimestre deste ano, podendo ser jogado também via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate e PC Game Pass. Trata-se do mais novo jogo principal da franquia em 13 anos.\nNinja Gaiden 4 será centrado em um novo protagonista, chamado Yakumo, mas também terá a presença do veterano Ryu Hayabusa. Ambos serão personagens jogáveis.\n“Um tempo significativo se passou desde Ninja Gaiden 3, e os jogadores se encontrarão chegando em uma Tóquio horrivelmente transformada. Um dos temas principais desta história é o retorno do Dark Dragon, que mergulhou a cidade no caos. Dentro dessas condições inquietantes, Yakumo terá que enfrentar seus inimigos, assim como o formidável Mestre Ninja, Ryu Hayabusa\", disse o produtor de Ninja Gaiden 4 e o diretor da PlatinumGames, Yuji Nakao.\nSobre a razão para introduzir um novo protagonista, Nakao explicou que “já que faz um tempo desde o último jogo, queríamos um novo herói para tornar a série mais acessível para novos jogadores. Claro, também queríamos que fãs de longa data gostassem do jogo, então Ryu Hayabusa desempenha um papel significativo na história, servindo como um grande desafio e marco de crescimento para Yakumo. Ryu aparecerá ao longo do jogo e será jogável, garantindo que sua destreza e presença sejam profundamente sentidas em Ninja Gaiden 4.\"\nO jogo está sendo feito para ser um \"verdadeiro sucessor\" da franquia Ninja Gaiden, com a promessa de que os jogadores terão a mesma experiência eletrizante de jogabilidade pela qual a franquia ficou conhecida.",

    "title": "Rain bomb to strike Australia this weekend: What you need to know",
    "text": "Heavy rain, thunderstorms and flash flooding could impact large swathes of Australia this weekend with more rain expected after a week of wet weather. A high pressure system centred just south the country is drawing in moisture from the atmosphere which will turn to rain as it meets a pool of upper-level cold air over the next few days. NSW and Victoria are in for a soaking, while southern WA, eastern SA and southern Queensland will also see significant falls. The northern half of the country will see some showers but remain mostly dry while Tasmania will see cool and cloudy conditions but avoid significant rainfall. The rain in the eastern half of the country will move from SA towards the coast, hitting Melbourne on Friday and Sydney by late Friday night. South-east Australia is in for a soaking over the weekend as this cumulative rainfall map for the seven days until Tuesday shows Sydneysiders should take a umbrella with them if venturing out this weekend and those further south in Illawarra and the South Coast should watch for flood warnings Already saturated catchments in NSW and Victoria could quickly flood, particularly in the Illawarra and South Coast regions of NSW where weekend rainfall totals could exceed 150mm. The Bureau of Meteorology’s Sarah Scully said the upper-level trough will combine with a coastal trough over NSW on Saturday and ‘ramp up’ the rainfall. ‘Moderate to heavy rainfall is expected in the southern half of NSW,’ Ms Scully said. ‘We’re expecting to issue a severe weather warning as grounds are really wet through eastern parts of NSW due to recent rainfall. ‘Inland NSW the rainfall totals look to be more than 50mm over the weekend, some places even reaching 100mm.’ The Bureau also has a hazardous surf warning in place for Saturday for the Macquarie coast, Hunter coast, Sydney coast and Illawarra coast. Canberra, Brisbane and Cairns will see some showers over the weekend and mild temperatures with Canberra dipping into the single figures overnight. Darwin and Adelaide will be in for a fine weekend with tops in Adelaide in the low 20s and Darwin in the low 30s. The rain will ease by Tuesday over most of the country. The second half of next week is forecast to be fine though cool autumn weather. The rain will be focused on the eastern and south-west parts of the country with the central and northern regions escaping most of the rain Sea surface temperatures remain the warmest on record globally since April 2023 which is affecting the historical modelling for declaring weather events such as El Nino or La Nina. The bureau said sea surface temperatures continue to increase, with temperatures in February, March and April setting records. The Pacific Ocean will likely return to a neutral model (known as an El Nino Southern Oscillation or ENSO) – neither El Nino or La Nina – by June. There are also predictions a La Nina will return by late winter but forecasts will not be firm enough to declare until after May. ‘El Nino and La Nina predictions made in early autumn tend to have lower accuracy than predictions made at other times of the year,’ the bureau said. ‘As the current global ocean conditions have not been observed before, inferences of how ENSO may develop in 2024 that are based on past events may not be reliable.’ La Nina conditions typically lend to higher rainfall totals and cooler average day time temperatures.

    "title": "Etats-Unis: les salariés de Boeing votent massivement pour la grève, la direction veut négocier",
    "text": "Déjà dans la tourmente après plusieurs accidents,\n[Boeing](/cotation/BAu) fait désormais face à sa première grande grève en 16 ans, avec le coup d'envoi vendredi d'un vaste mouvement social qui va bloquer sa production dans son berceau de la côte nord-ouest américaine.\nLa grève devait démarrer à minuit heure locale (07H00 GMT, selon le syndicat des machinistes IAM-District 751, quelques heures après un vote massif par les salariés de Boeing de la région de Seattle en faveur d'un débrayage.\nSelon l'agence Bloomberg, des centaines de travailleurs ont entamé dans la nuit un piquet de grève à l'usine de Renton, proche de Seattle, où est produit le 737 Max, appareil vedette de l'avionneur américain.\nJeudi, les travailleurs ont rejeté la nouvelle convention de travail proposée par l'avionneur à 94,6%, a précisé Jon Holden, président du syndicat des machinistes IAM-District 751.\nIls ont en outre voté à 96% en faveur d'une grève dès l'expiration jeudi à minuit de la convention actuelle, vieille de 16 ans. Les deux tiers des votes étaient nécessaires pour lancer un arrêt de travail.\nLe syndicat, qui représente environ 33.000 travailleurs dans la région Nord-Ouest Pacifique, avait initialement soutenu l'accord. M. Holden avait auparavant déclaré ne pas pouvoir \"garantir que nous obtiendrons davantage en faisant grève\".\nLa grève doit entraîner la fermeture de deux grandes usines d'assemblage d'avions dans la région de Puget Sound. Elle va paralyser la production du 737, du 777 et du 767 cargo, dont les livraisons cumulent déjà les retards.\nUne situation d'autant plus problématique que l'avionneur encaisse la plus grosse partie du paiement (environ 60%) à la remise des avions.\n- Boeing toujours prêt à négocier -\nEn dépit du vote massif en faveur de la grève, le groupe Boeing a déclaré dans un communiqué être \"engagé\" dans la négociation.\n\"Nous restons déterminés à rétablir nos relations avec nos employés et le syndicat, et nous sommes prêts à retourner à la table des négociations pour parvenir à un nouvel accord\", a affirmé l'avionneur.\nLa dernière grève chez l'avionneur américain, en 2008, avait duré 57 jours.\nSelon les analystes de TD Cowen, une grève de 50 jours priverait Boeing de 3 à 3,5 milliards de dollars de liquidités et aurait un impact de 5,5 milliards sur le chiffre d'affaires. Dans les échanges électroniques avant l'ouverture de la Bourse de New York vendredi, le titre du constructeur chutait d'ailleurs de près de 4%.\nLe vote de jeudi marque un rejet décisif d'un accord qui, selon les travailleurs, était bien moins généreux que ne l'affirmaient les dirigeants de Boeing. Il prévoyait une hausse salariale de 25% sur quatre ans ainsi qu'un engagement d'investissements dans la région, ainsi que la construction du prochain avion - annoncé pour 2035 - dans le berceau historique de l'avionneur, ce qui devait assurer des emplois pour plusieurs décennies.\n- \"Bradés\" -\nBoeing espérait que ces concessions suffiraient à esquiver une grève. Sa situation financière est précaire depuis le crash de deux 737 MAX 8 en 2018 et en 2019, ayant coûté la vie à 346 personnes, et une multitude de problèmes de qualité de la production.\nIl fait notamment l'objet d'une supervision accrue après la perte d'une porte-bouchon en plein vol début janvier sur un 737 MAX 9 d'Alaska Airlines.\n\"Ce n'est un secret pour personne: notre activité traverse une période difficile, en partie à cause de nos propres erreurs du passé. (...) Une grève mettrait en péril notre reprise commune\", avait prévenu mercredi soir Kelly Ortberg, qui a succédé le 8 août à Dave Calhoun au poste de directeur général de l'avionneur américain.\nIl avait exhorté les employés à ne pas \"sacrifier\" les progrès futurs en raison de \"frustrations liées au passé\".\nMais les mécontents jugent la hausse salariale trop éloignée des demandes du syndicat (+40% initialement) et le volet sur les retraites insatisfaisant.\nUne semaine après sa prise de fonction, M. Ortberg s'était engagé à \"réinitialiser\" la relation avec l'IAM. Mais à la lecture de l'accord, de nombreux syndiqués ont réagi négativement et plaidé pour un arrêt de travail.\n\"On nous a bradés\", a lancé jeudi à l'AFP Kamie Bryan, employée chez Boeing depuis 18 ans, après avoir voté contre l'accord et pour la grève. \"Nous ne devrions pas prendre ces quelques sous qu'ils nous donnent et être reconnaissants\", a-t-elle relevé, insistant sur l'ampleur des \"revenus du patron\".\n\"Ils parlent d'une augmentation de 25%, mais ce n'est pas le cas\", a déclaré Paul Janousek, un électricien d'Everett qui a voté en faveur de la grève après avoir estimé que la présentation de Boeing était \"trompeuse\". Selon cet homme de 55 ans, employé chez Boeing depuis 13 ans, son augmentation ne serait en réalité que d'environ 9%, compte tenu de la suppression de la prime annuelle.\nLes télévisions ont montré des rassemblements quotidiens d'ouvriers protestant dans les usines contre des mesures salariales qu'ils estiment inadéquates face à l'inflation.\nAprès des grèves dans les secteurs de l'automobile, du divertissement et d'autres secteurs d'activité, les syndicats engagent ainsi un nouveau bras de fer.\nLe règlement de l'IAM prévoit que les grévistes reçoivent 250 dollars par semaine à partir de la troisième semaine d'arrêt de travail.\n© 2024 AFP\nVous avez aimé cet article ?

    "title": "New era in forecasting: AI will improve extreme weather warnings",
    "text": "Weather forecasting is a tricky business. We rely on it to plan our daily activities, prepare for natural disasters, and even to decide what to wear each day. Yet, despite advances in technology, we only get forecasts about 10 days into the future. Why so? Small changes in atmospheric and surface conditions can trigger larger, unpredictable shifts in weather patterns. For example, consider the devastating Pacific Northwest heat wave in June 2021. Power lines melted, crops were destroyed, and hundreds of people lost their lives. A longer lead time on forecasts could have helped communities better prepare for the extreme heat. Weather scientists commonly turn to adjoint models to gauge how susceptible a forecast is to errors in initial conditions. Ever wondered how a slight tweak in temperature or atmospheric water vapor can alter forecast results? These models help answer that. They clarify the linkage between initial conditions and forecasted errors. Thus, scientists can adjust until they discover the set of initial conditions that yield the most accurate forecast. However, there is a hitch. Running these models demands substantial financial and computing resources. And they can only measure sensitivities up to five days ahead. Researchers in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington have been exploring whether deep learning could offer an efficient and more precise method to determine the optimal set of initial conditions for a 10-day forecast. To test their hypothesis, the experts modeled forecasts of the disastrous June 2021 Pacific Northwest heat wave. They utilized two different forecasting models: Google DeepMind’s GraphCast model and Huawei Cloud’s Pangu-Weather model. The scientists wanted to check if the models operated similarly and how they stacked up against the actual events of the heat wave . To ensure unbiased results, they excluded the heat wave data from the dataset used to train the models. The researchers carried out a rigorous comparison between the output of the GraphCast and Pangu-Weather models and actual meteorological data from the period of the June 2021 heat wave. They focused on the accuracy of temperature predictions, the models’ ability to anticipate extreme conditions, and their computational efficiency. Preliminary results revealed that both models exhibited a high degree of accuracy, with Pangu-Weather displaying a slight edge in long-term temperature prediction. The advanced models showed promising potential in enhancing forecast accuracy and retiming their delivery, offering valuable insights for emergent situations such as heat waves. The implementation of deep learning models like GraphCast and Pangu-Weather marks a pivotal shift in the realm of meteorology, promising more accurate and timely forecasts. Yet, challenges persist, particularly in ensuring these models can process vast datasets in real-time scenarios and integrate seamlessly into existing forecasting frameworks. Additionally, there is a growing need for collaboration between meteorologists, data scientists, and policymakers to maximize the utility of these technological advancements. As research continues to unfold, these novel approaches hold the potential to revolutionize weather forecasting, resulting in better community preparedness and resilience against climate anomalies. Scaling deep learning approaches for global weather forecasts requires a comprehensive strategy to manage data heterogeneity, computational intensity, and energy consumption. The vast and varied data sources – from satellite imagery to oceanic sensor readings – demand that models harmonize inputs with differing resolutions and formats. The computational power needed to handle such voluminous and diverse datasets is substantial, raising concerns about environmental impact due to energy-intensive processes. Consequently, researchers are exploring energy-efficient algorithms and innovative hardware solutions to mitigate these challenges. Additionally, there is a critical need for robust validation frameworks to ensure these models’ generalizability across diverse climatic regions and conditions. The integration of artificial intelligence in weather forecasting introduces several ethical considerations that warrant careful examination. Predominantly, the question of data privacy emerges, as intricate datasets often include sensitive geolocation information. Additionally, there is an inherent risk of algorithmic bias, where disparities in data collection can skew predictions, disproportionately affecting certain populations or regions. Transparency and accountability in AI decision-making processes are imperative to ensure equitable access to advanced forecasting technologies . The results were nothing short of astonishing. Employing deep learning to pinpoint optimal initial conditions led to a massive 94% reduction in 10-day forecast errors in the GraphCast model. A similar drop in errors was noted when the method was applied to the Pangu-Weather model. Remarkably, the new technique improved forecasts as much as 23 days in advance. So, do we stand at the threshold of a new era in weather forecasting? Can we look forward to forecasts that are not just more accurate, but also offer longer lead times? If the findings are any indication, this might not be too far off. The study is published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters . —– Like what you read?

    "text": "Emurua Dikir MP Johanna Ng’eno is under siege in the wake of allegations of corruption and incompetence during his reign as the Chairperson of the powerful Housing and Urban Planning Committee in the National Assembly.\nNg’eno, a critic of President William Ruto before he joined the ruling United Democratic Alliance (UDA) political outfit in the run-up to the 2022 elections, has been serving in the powerful Housing Committee until this week when members voted him out over allegations of corruption.\nThe members are said to have openly expressed reservations about the lawmaker’s conduct.\nThe committee members further accused the MP of sidelining them in key matters, warning this would be detrimental to the housing program which is key to the Kenya Kwanza administration.\nThe committee members held a six-hour meeting with National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula to discuss Ng’eno’s conduct.\nHe was accused of running the committee as a “private entity”.\nDespite the challenges, Ng’eno has been instrumental in the implementation of the Affordable Housing Law at the National Assembly. He becomes the first chair of the committee to be ejected from his position in the 13th Parliament.\nThe housing project is among President William Ruto’s key priorities.\nThe Head of State has consistently stressed that the project will not only improve the standards of living of Kenyans who will live with dignity, but also create employment opportunities for thousands of citizens, especially the youth.\nThe housing program was initially successfully stopped by the courts following a petition by Busia Senator Okiya Omtatah before the National Assembly drafted a law to support and implement it.\nDespite his challenges in the National Assembly, Ng’eno was recently installed as Kipsigis elder and spokesperson of the community. He vowed to use the position to push for the interests of the locals.\nThe position was previously held by former Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto.\nAlso read: Comedian Terence Creative opens up about mental health struggles\nCaretaker on the spot over stolen Sh600,000 rent",
