    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California.\nThe 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared.\n“I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said.\nHe was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors.\nIt would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found.\n“So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled.\nIt was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost.\n“I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.”\nThe problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going.\nBy the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report.\nThe search was on then.\n“Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said.\nLukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal.\n“‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.”\nBut on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help.\nThe Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location.\nA K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family.\n“Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.”\nFortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.\nCopyright 2024 KSBW via CNN Newsource.

    "title": "Comment on Huawei’s star was born. Aito M7 SUV received 100,000 orders in China by SinoWeibo",
    "text": "Huawei Aito announced it received 100,000 firm orders for its M7 SUV, two and half months after the EV launched on September 12 in China. Aito is a new Huawei EV brand contract manufactured by Seres.\nThe\nSeres is a brand under state-owned Dongfeng, and the M7 is assembled in their factory in Chongqing, which is dedicated to Aito production and went into operation in July 2022. The plant’s annual production capacity is 150,000 units, and the production capacity of M7 is currently about 700 units daily.\nCustomers who want to order M7 place a non-refundable deposit on Aito’s\nwebsite and the rest of the price upon delivery. The M7 reached 100k orders milestone just 12 days after it got 90k orders on November 15.\nAito M7 is the company’s second car, which was launched in China on July 4, 2022. The M7 that got 100k orders is the updated 2024 version, launched on September 12. The price of the new M7 started 40,000 yuan (5,600 USD) lower than the 2022 version, signalizing Huawei also joined the price war in China.\nThe new Aito’s M7 is a large 5-seater SUV with 5020/1945/1760 mm (L/W/H) dimensions and a wheelbase of 2820 mm. It is an EREV, so it comes equipped with a 40 kWh ternary NMC battery from CATL, which is suitable for the 240 km CLTC range or 1,300 km combined range with a full 60L fuel tank.\nM7 has two powertrain options: single motor RWD with 200 kW and 360 Nm peak torque and dual motor AWD with 330 kW and 660 nM peak torque. All versions have 1.5T ICE that is not connected to the wheels but only charges the battery. The price starts at 249,800 yuan (35,200 USD) for the entry-level version and ends at 379,800 yuan (53,500 USD) for the top trim.\nThere is also a lot of Huawei software inside. Of course, it comes with HarmonyOS, but mainly, the M7 features an ADS 2.0 assisted driving system (ADAS), which Huawei claims can navigate highways and cities without HD maps. According to Huawei, by December, it should support navigation-assisted driving in all Chinese cities.\nAito currently has three cars in its lineup. Their first production car was the\nM5 SUV, launched in December 2021 as an electric range extended vehicle (EREV). Later, it added a BEV powertrain version. It was followed by the M7 SUV in 2022, and the latest is the large flagship SUV Aito M9 with 530 hp that rolled off the production line in October and presale for about 70,000 USD.\nEditor’s comment\nHuawei went all in during the Aito M7 launch, and it paid off. During 2023, the brand sales were struggling, around 4 thousand units per month, and Huawei was desperately and unsuccessfully trying to lift it above the 6k level at least. Well, it seems the Chinese tech giant got tired of it in September when they took advantage of that huge cash pile they sat on and launched an updated version of M7, almost 6k USD cheaper than the previous one. On top of that, they offered\nvarious perks and subsidies. It worked. Aito sold 12,700 cars in October, and the upcoming flagship M9 is getting a lot of positive headlines in China. Moreover, Huawei is using the power of its established network of hundreds of showrooms and retail stores to present cars next to mobile phones. Like it or not, Huawei is on its way to becoming one of the key players in China’s EV market.\nThe company that would feel the pressure from Huawei joining the price war would be Li Auto, which also focuses on SUV EREVs, with\nL7 and L8 being the most threatened. However, Li Auto’s sales keep rising, no matter how many perks Huawei offers. The same goes for BYD Tang, a PHEV SUV that is not affected by Aito’s successes. It almost seems the market for plug-in hybrid SUVs is inflammable in China.\nWell, it should be, as more new models are coming in 2024, led by BYD’s\nFang Cheng Bao, YangWang, and Denza. But also many smaller brands are joining, for example, Polestones 01 and Deepal S7. We will keep an eye on it.",

Their response to the last one was pretty horrendous - they made more efforts to keep people informed this time. But I can't have an email service that keeps going down during business hours. I wish they'd focus more on their core products and less on things like creating wallets, etc.\nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/viewtopic.php?p=8199843&sid=3ce25fef77f0846a2ba425de38855caf#p8199843\nThanks! I'm ok with the extra clicks. Their service seems like it does pretty much everything the proton service does in terms of keeping your email hidden, so I may give it a try.\nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/viewtopic.php?p=8199846&sid=3ce25fef77f0846a2ba425de38855caf#p8199846\nI use both Proton & iCloud.

I also work in this field and I am satisfied with their root cause analysis, communication frequency and their ongoing migration plan. For laymen, the migration they are currently performing is technically complex and \"stuff\" happens. The biggest game in town, Office 365, also has issues from time to time. When you're running this kind of infrastructure at scale, things can and do happen.",

    "title": "Cuesta abajo para la rodada de un sistema de partidos",
    "text": "Hace 30 años, Carlos Menem y Raúl Alfonsín firmaban el último acuerdo de gobernabilidad que recuerde la política argentina. A la vez, le ponían la cuña que iba a hacer crujir poco tiempo después el sistema bipartidista que había regido en buena parte del siglo 20. El Pacto de Olivos parió una Constitución con avances institucionales y permitió que emergiera una fuerza en condiciones de disputar un caudal de votantes de relevancia para poner en jaque al peronismo y al radicalismo. La crisis de 2001-2002 se llevaba puesto ese sistema bipartidista, a menos de dos décadas de la recuperación democrática. Fue a partir de una compleja combinación de factores que podrían sintetizarse en uno elemental: la alternancia peronista-radical no había mejorado las condiciones de vida de los argentinos, sino todo lo contrario. Lo que vino después fue un endeble sistema de bicoaliciones, que parecía emparentar a la Argentina con democracias de países más desarrollados. Una de centroizquierda, liderada por el kirchnerismo, y otra de centroderecha, sintetizada por lo que fue Juntos por el Cambio. Ya no sólo repitieron el fracaso de los partidos clásicos, sino que lo agudizaron. Y fue así como las coaliciones estallaron con menos estruendo que los partidos, pero de manera más penosa. Sobre esas esquirlas, y honrando la letra del tango Cuesta abajo, vagan dirigentes con “la vergüenza de haber sido y el dolor de ya no ser”, mientras repiten que no pueden entender cómo llegaron al poder Javier Milei y su La Libertad Avanza. Tres fotos Sin asimilar aún esa irrupción, en una sola semana se acumularon postales bien representativas de que en cada espacio político de los considerados tradicionales no saben cómo acomodarse ante Milei y crujen por todos lados. Repasemos sólo tres de esas imágenes. El peronismo se hunde en una interna que expone la fragilidad de su última jefa, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, quien anda mendigando avales para enfrentar a uno de los gobernadores más ineficientes, el riojano Ricardo Quintela. Quintela aglutina a los gobernadores y dirigentes más proclives a negociar con Milei, pero Cristina es favorecida por la decisión del presidente de encumbrarla como la principal referente opositora, en un intercambio de baja calidad que es negocio para los dos. En Córdoba, Mauricio Macri pareció “despedir” en público al presidente de su partido en la provincia, Oscar Agost Carreño, a quien culpó en la cara de votar en contra de la gestión libertaria, a la que el líder del PRO se ha aliado de manera formal. El presidente del PRO local está dentro del bloque federal donde se encuentran los diputados de Martín Llaryora, otro de quienes no saben dónde posicionarse ante Milei, mientras envía señales contradictorias en sus acciones de gobierno provincial. Completa el trío de imágenes la ruptura del bloque radical que encabeza el cordobés Rodrigo de Loredo, quien sigue apostando por la llamada oposición dialoguista y se sumó a la mesa que armó la gestión libertaria con sus “aliados”. Se le fueron quienes prefieren un radicalismo duro ante Milei y con puentes hacia el kirchnerismo, de donde viene el propio titular partidario, Martín Lousteau. Las postales sólo marcan que la política argentina fracasó de manera tan rotunda que ha construido su propio caleidoscopio con esos vidrios que ellos mismos rompieron y que pueden ir formando las más variadas imágenes.",

    "title": "The warmest December in Dubuque County history",
    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Dubuque County, Iowa from 1901-2000 was 22.5. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Dubuque County, Iowa experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Dubuque County, Iowa history.",

    "text": "FMCSA’s [Drug & Alcohol Clearinghouse, first implemented in 2020](https://www.fleetowner.com/news/article/21129887/fmcsa-wants-to-make-it-simpler-for-states-to-ban-drug-and-alcohol-violators), is now a working federal database for drivers who have violated federal drug and alcohol testing requirements. Clearinghouse data is limited to only a few years, heavily disrupted by an unusual freight cycle since the pandemic. However, positive tests in recent years are declining. Overall drug violations are trending down over the last two years. The number of [drug violations in the Drug & Alcohol Clearinghouse](https://clearinghouse.fmcsa.dot.gov/Learn#news-events) fell since 2022, when drug violations peaked at 57,508. In 2023, violations dipped to 54,159. As of the Clearinghouse’s June 2024 report, violations to date reached 25,434—well below 2023’s midyear report total of 28,145 and 2022’s midyear total of 29,065. Clearinghouse’s findings specifically for tests detecting marijuana metabolites shows a similar trend. Positive marijuana tests through Clearinghouse are down roughly 10% year over year. The 2022 June report found 20,896 positive tests for marijuana, 2023’s midyear report found 19,378 positive tests for marijuana, and 2024’s report fell to 17,390. However, Clearinghouse in 2024 still found more positive marijuana tests than in 2021, which encountered 15,800 positive marijuana tests from January to June. On the other hand, ATRI’s 2023 survey of 238 motor carriers suggests that positive pre-employment tests and walk-outs have risen. When asked if respondents noticed an increase in positive pre-employment tests or walk-outs in the past five years, 60.1% said ‘yes.’",
