    "text": "WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, December 29, 2023 /\nEINPresswire.com/ -- The Middle East Christian Committee condemns those in the government of Lebanon who would take legal action against Christian religious leaders for meeting Israel’s President Herzog in the Holy Land on the occasion of the New Year on December 21. The traditional meeting drew the expected criticism from leaders of Hezbollah: \"The image provoked me because there cannot be a religious figure worshiping God, believing in justice and right, aligning themselves with Israel, tyranny, and colonialism,\" stated Sadek Naboulsi, a religious sheikh close to Hezbollah, who accused anyone meeting an Israeli of \"treason.\"\nThe minister of information Ziad Makari stated: “I was bothered by the image of the two bishops with the Israeli president, and I definitely do not agree to it, and I contacted the military court judges which has the texts related to contact with the Israeli enemy.”\nAl Ahed, a news site with ties to Hezbollah, reported that a collective of Representatives of Released Prisoners and Detainees submitted a request to the Lebanese judiciary to open an investigation against Archbishops al-Hage and Semaan, accusing them of “having contact with the Zionist [Israeli] enemy,” an offence which can carry a sentence of death.\nRadical Islamists seek to separate Christians from their Jewish brethren who follow the original religion of Jesus and even go so far as to claim Jesus was not Jewish at all. In this way, they seek to isolate Israel from the rest of the world.\nRepresentatives of Hamas, who on October 7, carried out the bloody massacre and kidnapping of Israeli civilians - the worst atrocity committed against Jews since the Holocaust - claim to have been “shocked by the photo of Christian dignitaries from the occupied Palestinian territories meeting the president of the Zionist entity on the occasion of Christmas.”\nThe relentless Muslim persecution of Christians and Jews in the Holy Land continues. Bethlehem, located in Palestinian-controlled territory, has seen a precipitous decline in its Christian population, which was once the majority in the birthplace of Jesus, but now comprises only 12% of the population. Jews, who were once found in substantial numbers across the Middle East were driven out of all the Arab states after the creation of Israel in 1948, and Christians are likewise being “ethnically cleansed” from the Muslim regions. The one exception where the Christian population is growing is in Israel.\nArchbishop Hage denied participating in the meeting himself, but also\npointed out: “[T]he patriarchs and bishops who took part in this event conveyed a message related to the cause they defend, and they clearly denounced the military actions in Palestine.”\n“The US Congress should condition any future aid to the Lebanese government to this issue,” said MECHRIC Director John Hajjar. “It is inhuman to threaten to imprison the Christian clergies in Lebanon who are simply serving their dioceses in Israel and coordinating with the Israeli government on behalf of the Christians of Israel.”\n\"This is a pattern in Lebanon,” stated MECHRIC Director Tom Harb. “The military court is an instrument used by Hezbollah to silence any criticism of Hezbollah or Iran in Lebanon.”\nThe Middle East Christian Committee stands with the archbishops and the other Christian leaders seeking peace in the region and applaud their refusal to be intimidated by those pushing for war.\nRebecca Bynum\nAmerican Mideast Coalition for Democracy\n+1 615-775-6801\n[[email protected]]https://kalkinemedia.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\nVisit us on social media:",

    "title": "Iraq moving to end presence of US-led coalition troops: PM",
    "text": "Iraq's PM says government working to end presence of US-led coalition forces in the country Iraq's government is working on bringing an end to the presence of soldiers from a US-led coalition in the country, Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said on Thursday. The Iraqi premier's announcement comes amid heightened tensions and an escalation in attacks between the US military and Iran-backed militias, with the latter group insisting that the Iraqi government should set out a clear timetable for the withdrawal of coalition troops. Speaking in a joint conference with Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who visited Iraq on Thursday, al-Sudani said his government was committed to reconfiguring its relationship with the coalition forces, who went to Iraq in 2015 to fight the Islamic State (IS) militant group. \"With the presence of capable Iraqi forces, the Iraqi government is heading towards ending the presence of the international coalition forces,\" Sudani said. Sudani condemned strikes on bases hosting coalition troops in the country, which have increased substantially since US ally Israel launched its brutal war on Gaza in October. But with the US conducting retaliatory strikes in Iraq on the Iran-backed groups that are attacking the bases, Sudani said foreign forces must stick to their role of training and advising Iraqi security forces. \"Engaging in military operations beyond these limits is viewed as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty and is unequivocally rejected.\" The US this week conducted three airstrikes in response to an attack that wounded three US soldiers at Harir airbase near Erbil, the capital city of Iraqi Kurdistan. The Iraqi government on Tuesday condemned US airstrikes on the headquarters of armed factions within the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) that killed one person and wounded 20 others. Spain has more than 300 soldiers in Iraq, as part of the international anti-IS coalition and NATO's mission in the country. Sanchez said during the press conference said that he supported Iraq's \"sovereignty and stability\". The US has 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 more in neighbouring Syria, on a mission to advise and assist local forces in fighting IS, who in 2014 seized swathes of territory in both countries. The US-led coalition helped territorially defeat IS in Iraq in 2017 and Syria two years later, but sleeper cells of the extremist group still carry out attacks in both countries. Iraq's parliament asked the government to set a timeline for the withdrawal of foreign troops based in the country back in March 2018.",

    "text": "At the nine-month mark since Hamas terrorists attacked Israel and abducted more than 200 people, among them life-loving young women snatched from a music festival, mothers taken from their beds, sisters and daughters ripped from the optimism and vitality of their youth and their lives, we must ask: What has happened to our humanity? Our capacity for empathy for the hostages as well as the innocent women and girls of Gaza? Our ethical intuition? Our sense of allegiance and responsibility to these women hostages? In the horrifying footage of their capture on Oct. 7, 2023, from the Nahal Oz base, 18- and 19-year-old girls are bound hand and foot and faced against the wall, passive objects in the hands of their captors. “You are so beautiful,” leers one at a young woman, as he binds her hands, kneeling. “Here are the females,” said another, invoking an ISIS idiom. The intimation is clear. And it touches every chord of horror available to the human experience. The medieval brutality of the Hamas invasion into Israel on Oct. 7, widely documented, indeed seems to belong to a different era. But it hits notes of fear and terror that are so primal, so visceral, so chillingly familiar to us women. Millennia of vulnerability have been encoded in our bodies. We can conjure in our imaginations the darkest images of women captured in war, paraded through the streets as trophies, kept in cages, subject to every whim of their captors. It is a reality in which the darkest and most brutal of human impulses are laid bare. There is no moderating or civilizing force. This should alarm every single one of us. The significance of this particular brand of violence against women, of the reported ongoing crimes against the female hostages in Gaza, is that the rule of law, so carefully put in place over centuries of progress, is being actively disregarded and defiled. We need to face the facts. This weaponizing of women’s bodies, this weaponizing of sexual assault and rape in warfare since Oct. 7, has taken the entire human race many steps backward. Civilization is failing these captives right now. And it is failing every one of us. Where is the public outcry? Where is the outrage? Where is the vocal conviction, across the board, that this type of violence against women is unacceptable and will not pass in silence? Where is the voice—broken and piercing and fierce—on behalf of these women? On behalf of civilization? Where is the demand, wall to wall, that they must be brought home now? I know well the primal vulnerability that comes with being a woman and a mother, but I also know about the primal power that these roles carry. I, along with millions of other women, haven’t given up. Not on these young women. And not on our humanity. I call upon every person to speak out for all the hostages—women and men—still being held by terrorists and help bring them home.
