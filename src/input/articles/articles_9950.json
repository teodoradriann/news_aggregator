    "text": "Farmers can grow vegetables through the coldest days of winter. They can learn how to turn waste into biogas and power the farm. Bigger picture, they can look to the past to create an equitable, sustainable and scalable regional system of small farms. Ideas like this were among the dozens of sessions at Pasa’s annual conference held last week. The group formerly known as Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture brought about 1,500 people in the region’s food system together to Lancaster County Convention Center for discussions on biopesticides to climate resilience. Even if your growing space is as small as a raised bed, here are some helpful tips from the conference on what to grow.

It’s her bean crop that brings her the most joy. Dried beans are easy to store. In between planting, harvesting and processing, they don’t require much attention. Fresh beans are delicious, too. “There’s an appetite for beans in our communities,” she says. What we learned Black turtle , flageolet and Good Mother Stallard beans are Nelson’s staples. She also suggests verdon, tarbais (cassoulet), true red cranberry, purgatory, zolfini and myles garbanzo. Bonus: Black Shackamaxon is a native black bean. When picking beans to grow, check the days to maturity to spread out the harvest. Deer love to eat beans. At Nelson’s farm last summer, they pushed over a fence post and ate most of the beans . This year’s crop will be surrounded by a new fence. Usually beans are harvested from late September through November. Press your fingernail into the pod. When there’s no mark, it’s time to harvest. To harvest, Nelson cuts bush beans at the soil line and drops the entire plant onto old sheets . Runner beans climb sunflowers. She harvests these pods by hand . To dry, Nelson places bean pods in “hammocks” made from construction mesh lined with bed sheets. Once dry, Nelson threshes the beans in an adapted compost shredder/grinder. Replacing the blades with wheels separates the beans from the pods with little damage . To winnow, she uses a box fan . Don’t forget eye protection and a face mask as the chaff blows away . READ : Elizabethtown sewer, Hickory Lane Park and Rapho Township dairy farm gain state funds Uncommon greens Ira Wallace, called the godmother of Southern Exposure Seed Exchange , shared a long list of uncommon greens to grow and eat raw or braised. What we learned Wallace’s favorite greens for gardeners and cooks looking to branch out include tatsoi , related to bok choy. Green amaranth will grow 6 feet tall. Its leaves can be eaten fresh or cooked in soup as long as you don’t mind a little beetle damage. Collard greens might have a reputation for being tough enough for a long simmer. When harvested young (about 12- to 18-inches tall), the leaves are tender and ready after a 15-minute steam. For shady gardens, as long as there’s at least four hours of sunlight, most greens will grow, Wallace says. Because they’ll likely not reach maturity, replant every 3-4 weeks. Wallace is part of the Heirloom Collard Project , where she’s been surprised by the range of varieties, especially the purple collards. She pushed people to think of collards beyond a winter vegetable, especially when harvesting early leaves. Other greens include Sokoyokoto celosia (a flowering celosia with edible leaves like spinach), Malabar spinach (she prefers the showier red-stemmed type of this heat-loving climber), Mexican mint marigold (the licorice-flavored flowers and leaves are great in salads) and salad burnet (an early season green). READ: A look at Lancaster County's only large-scale bison farm: 'A wild streak in them' Underutilized berries Allyson Levy and Scott Serrano wrote the book on cold-hardy fruits and nuts based on what they grow in their Hudson Valley farm. At the conference, they focused on berries while noting most are technically are other types of fruit but still commonly called berries. What we learned Himalayan chocolate berry is a beautiful shrub that also attracts pollinators. The fruit’s flavor hints at red wine, bittersweet chocolate, flan and caramel. The Golden Lanterns cultivar has golden/lime leaves mixed with dark leaves. In warmer climates, this plant can grow enough to be considered invasive. The five-flavor berry is Levy’s favorite low-maintenance plant. This woody vine’s fruit has sour, sweet, spicy, salty and bitter notes. When cooked and sweetened, it makes a drink that tastes like strawberry lemonade. It also be dried or become frozen granita, both helpful because the fruit ripens at once. Goumi berry shrubs can be planted in not-perfect soil. Goumi flowers are bell-shaped stunners that smell like jasmine. It’s also short enough for children to help harvest. For mulberries, collier (a red-white hybrid) and kokuso (an extra-hardy variety) are Serrano’s favorite flavors. The Illinois Everbearing mulberry has a complex flavor and produces fruit for about three months. Raised bed growing Growing in raised beds makes gardening accessible and possible in a wide range of spaces. Many tips on building, location and filling beds were offered by Allison Glick, homegrown garden installation coordinator with Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens; Claire Matway, community garden network manager at Grow Pittsburgh and Russell Thorsen, farmer outreach specialist at Pasa. What we learned Before filling a bed, test the soil in the ground underneath. If it’s contaminated, line with weed barrier or greenhouse plastic. Fill with a 50-50 (or 60-40) mix of topsoil and compost. At the top of the bed, add 1 wheelbarrow of soil, 3/4 5-gallon bucket of peat substitute (such as coconut coir), 1/3 5-gallon bucket of perlite (wear a mask and eye protection) and 1 inch in a 5-gallon bucket of play sand. Mix the amendments into the soil with a rake. Adding a mulch of shredded leaves or straw at the beginning of the season will prevent weeds, help the soil below hold water and help prevent compaction. Wood chips are carbon heavy and can tie up nutrients needed for plants. Instead, they save wood chips for paths between raised beds. For an already-established raised bed, at the start of the season: de-compact the soil with a spading fork or broad fork. Add fertilizer. Check sides for warping and add L-brackets at corners to tighten things up. Top-off beds with a mix of soil and compost. Want seasonal gardening articles and tips sent to your inbox weekly?

    "text": "«Quien interprete que la bendición legitima el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo, o no ha leído el documento o tiene mala intención», afirma el cardenal Víctor Manuel Fernández, Prefecto del Dicasterio para la Doctrina de la Fe, en una entrevista concedida al [diario español ABC](https://www.abc.es/sociedad/victor-manuel-fernandez-interpreta-bendicion-legitimacion-matrimonio-20231227193448-nt.html) el 27 de diciembre de 2023. En respuesta a las críticas, e incluso hostilidad, a la declaración [ Fiducia supplicans, ](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20231218_fiducia-supplicans_sp.html)publicada el pasado 18 de diciembre, que autorizaba bendiciones no litúrgicas para parejas «irregulares» (en particular homosexuales), afirmó que corresponde a «cada obispo local» hacer un «discernimiento» en su diócesis sobre cómo aplicar el texto. Apenas unos días después de responder a la web católica estadounidense The Pillar, el cardenal Fernández ha vuelto a defender la declaración que firmó, con el asentimiento del [Papa Francisco,](/tag/papa-francisco/) esta vez en declaraciones a la prensa española. «Si se lee el texto con igual disposición, se ve que sostiene con gran claridad y sencillez la perenne doctrina católica sobre el [ matrimonio](/2023/11/09/en-verdad-el-matrimonio-es-solo-un-contrato/) y la sexualidad», ha explicado, respondiendo a los críticos que le acusan de haber cambiado significativamente la postura de la Iglesia sobre la sexualidad. «La declaración afirma clara y coherentemente que se trata de bendiciones no ritualizadas, por lo que no se interpretan como matrimonio», insiste. Estas bendiciones «son simplemente la respuesta de un pastor a dos personas que piden la ayuda de Dios», y no «un matrimonio», «una aprobación del estilo de vida que llevan» o una «absolución». [Tres puntos para entender la declaración Fiducia Supplicans](/2023/12/20/tres-puntos-para-entender-la-declaracion-fiducia-supplicans/) Diferentes contextos regionales En los últimos días, varios cardenales, obispos y conferencias episcopales de todo el mundo -pero sobre todo de África- han cuestionado la claridad del texto, o simplemente han dicho que no quieren aplicarlo. Estas críticas, según el cardenal, expresan a menudo «la inoportunidad de dar bendiciones en sus contextos regionales, lo que podría confundirse fácilmente con legitimar una unión irregular». En particular, reconoce la dificultad de aplicarlo en un país donde, como en África, existe «una legislación que castiga con penas de cárcel el simple hecho de declararse homosexual». Por tanto, «corresponde a cada obispo local hacer este discernimiento o, en todo caso, dar orientaciones complementarias», dice el prefecto argentino. Pero, insiste, los obispos «no pueden estar en desacuerdo con esta doctrina» por todo ello. «Tendremos que acostumbrarnos a entender que si un sacerdote da este tipo de bendiciones sencillas, no está siendo herético, no está ratificando nada y no está negando la doctrina católica sobre el matrimonio», concluye el cardenal Fernández.

    "title": "Prefect of Dicastery for Doctrine of the Faith criticizes gender ideology in speech to German theologians",
    "text": "(ZENIT News / Rome, 02.20.2025).- Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, head of the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, recently addressed theologians at the Catholic School of Theology in Cologne (KHKT), warning against what he described as the «pretension of omnipotence» within gender ideology. Speaking via video conference on February 17, the Argentine cardinal argued that radical changes to gender and bodily identity, based solely on individual desire, present a challenge to the Christian understanding of human dignity.\nHis remarks formed part of a broader theological conference that examined the foundations of Catholic teaching on human dignity. Fernández expressed concern that the use of medical and technological means to alter one’s identity goes beyond cosmetic procedures and into the realm of constructing an artificial reality. While acknowledging that some individuals experience profound distress regarding their identity, he urged caution in responding to such cases, emphasizing that extreme measures should not be viewed as simple solutions.\nHe pointed to the Church’s theological anthropology as a unique and unparalleled framework for understanding human nature. Referring to «Dignitas Infinita», a recent Vatican document on human dignity, Fernández invoked the words of Pope John Paul II, who in 1980 reminded the faithful that God’s love bestows immeasurable worth upon every human being. The cardinal stressed that those who suffer from physical or spiritual difficulties are especially embraced by Christ’s love.\nThe event, titled «The Catholic Foundation of Human Dignity,» was intended to connect Catholic theology with other academic disciplines and worldviews. Christoph Ohly, rector of KHKT, highlighted that questions of dignity and human rights are not exclusive to Christianity but resonate with all of humanity. Over the course of several days, theologians and scholars explored how dignity is defined, its connection to human rights, and the evolving debates surrounding its application in modern society.\nFernández’s intervention reaffirmed the Church’s commitment to a vision of human nature rooted in theological tradition rather than shifting cultural trends. His remarks add to an ongoing Vatican discourse that seeks to defend the integrity of the human person while engaging with the complexities of modern thought.\nThank you for reading our content.

The deal is pending Winkler passing a physical, according to reports.\nHe signed a minor-league deal with Washington coming off an injury-plagued 2023 campaign with the Milwaukee Brewers. He thrived with the rebuilding Nationals, hitting 11 home runs with a .257/.374/.419 slash line, which made him an attractive trade candidate for contending teams seeking a left-handed bat.",

If swallowed, the high-powered magnets can attract to each other or to other metals inside the digestive system, leading to “perforations, twisting and/or blockage of the intestines, infection, blood poisoning and death.”\nThe agency broadly estimated 2,500 emergency room visits over magnet ingestions from 2017-2021 and seven deaths, two of which were outside of the United States.\nThe recall affects about 4,240 units. The CPSC said customers should take away the balls from children immediately and contact Joybuy for a pre-paid label to return the recalled products for a full refund. The toy kit was sold from February 2022 through April 2023 for between $14 and $15 and is made of small magnetic balls in purple, black, green, blue, orange and red.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "Arsenal fail in Premier League summit bid as Spurs lose thriller - Breitbart",
    "text": "Arsenal missed out on the chance to return to the Premier League summit on Thursday, losing 2-0 to West Ham as Tottenham went down in a six-goal thriller at Brighton. Mikel Arteta’s Gunners were top of the tree at Christmas for a second successive year but trail leaders Liverpool by two points at the halfway point of the season. Last year’s runners-up dominated possession at the Emirates but lacked a cutting edge against the disciplined visitors, for whom Tomas Soucek and former Arsenal player Konstantinos Mavropanos scored the goals. Soucek opened the scoring from close range in the 13th minute following a pass from Jarrod Bowen, with the goal confirmed after a lengthy VAR check looking into whether the ball had gone out of play. Arsenal surged forward in relentless waves and West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola made a fine reaction save from a Bukayo Saka header on the half-hour. The England winger hit the post from a tight angle as the clock ticked down towards half-time but Arsenal trailed at the break despite enjoying nearly three-quarters of possession. The Gunners came out determined to find a response but instead they found themselves 2-0 down when Mavropanos’s bullet header cannoned in off the crossbar from James Ward-Prowse’s corner. Gabriel Jesus failed to beat Areola with a header when well-placed and shortly afterwards missed another glorious opportunity with his head at the back post. Arsenal continued to bombard the visitors’ goal but could not find a breakthrough and it could have been worse had Said Benrahma managed to convert a late penalty. Defeat leaves the Gunners in second place on 40 points, one clear of Aston Villa and three ahead of Manchester City, who have a game in hand. Arteta said his team deserved more for their dominance. “We want to be at the top and today we are very, very disappointed,” he told the BBC. “We had so much dominance in the game. We are in a really good position. Today is a disappointing night. We have to pick ourselves up for a big game against Fulham.” He added: “The players put an enormous effort in. It’s a difficult dressing room right now but we have another game in 72 hours. This is football, we have to improve in certain areas.” West Ham manager David Moyes celebrated his team’s rise to sixth in the table. “We are not one of the top teams,” he told Amazon Prime. “We are trying to get up and grow the team. For West Ham to be in Europe (they topped their Europa League group) is a great period.” Spurs drama Tottenham, this season’s early pacesetters, remain in fifth spot after losing 4-2 despite threatening an astonishing comeback from 4-0 down against Roberto De Zerbi’s Brighton. Jack Hinshelwood finished with brutal power to put the home side ahead following a weaving run from Joao Pedro along the edge of the penalty area. Brighton doubled their lead from the penalty spot in the 23rd minute through Pedro, who took full advantage after Dejan Kulusevski was penalised for a pull on Welbeck. Brazil forward Richarlison twice had the ball in the net after the break but both times he was ruled offside. Pervis Estupinan stretched the lead with a thunderbolt from 30 yards in the 63rd minute and Pedro scored a second penalty 12 minutes later. Alejo Veliz grabbed what appeared to be a consolation goal in the 81st minute but it galvanised the visitors. Ben Davies headed home Pedro Porro’s deep cross as Spurs threatened to cut through every time they poured forward, with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hitting the post during nine frantic minutes of stoppage time. But Brighton withstood the intense pressure to take all three points. “I am really lucky to be this coach of this team with these players,” De Zerbi told the BBC. “I am very pleased with the passion they have, they have everything. “You can’t forget we are Brighton. Sometimes they forget we are Brighton. We are not Manchester United, Manchester City, Newcastle or Arsenal, we are still Brighton.”",

    "text": "La tarde de este jueves, el ministro de Energía, Diego Pardow (CS), respondió a las acusaciones que emitió la presidenta de la Cámara de Diputados, Karol Cariola (PC), en medio del debate por el alza de las tarifas eléctricas que afectará a millones de hogares a partir de julio. їCГіmo llegamos a esto?: guГ­a para entender el alza de las cuentas de la luz Sumándose a los cuestionamientos que ya han hecho otros parlamentarios, Cariola señaló ayer miércoles que, en el debate previo al proyecto que descongela las cuentas de la luz, Pardow no habría entregado todos los datos necesarios. “Le pedí al ministro poder informar abiertamente cuál era el porcentaje del alza que se proyectaba. Y la verdad es que esa información nunca estuvo a disposición de manera precisa”, lanzó. Tras participar de una actividad en Punta Arenas, el titular de Energía respondió que “las críticas son legítimas en la política, y cada uno puede utilizar esas críticas, digamos, antes de decidir en una votación”. Luego, recordó que la militante comunista que votó en contra de la propuesta del gobierno para estabilizar los precios de la luz. La presidenta de la Cámara de Diputados, Karol Cariola.

Supongo que la información que le fue proveída en su momento y las reuniones que tuvimos no fueron suficientes para convencerla, y eso es legítimo en una democracia. Eso pasa”, planteó. Por el contrario, Pardow relevó las declaraciones de parlamentarios que habrían sostenido que “la discusión fue informada, fue transparente”. Entre ellos, mencionó a los senadores Juan Luis Castro (PS) y Loreto Carvajal (PPD); y a los diputados Matías Ramírez (PC), Eric Aedo (DC) y José Miguel Castro (RN). “Yo también quiero destacar la velocidad y el ánimo constructivo con el que fue hecho: este proyecto fue diseñado en conjunto con el Congreso durante finales del año pasado, muestra que ejecutivos y Poder Legislativo pueden trabajar en conjunto en establecer estas soluciones”, subrayó. Luego agregó: “Este proyecto de ley que, por cierto, entendemos que es una noticia difícil y que va a ser impopular comunicarlo. Es solo un primer paso y vamos a seguir trabajando ese mismo espíritu con el que fuimos capaces de sacar esta ley de estabilización”.
