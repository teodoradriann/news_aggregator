    "text": "PALERMO (ITALPRESS) – Via libera all’assunzione di 255 agenti del Corpo forestale della Regione Siciliana nel corso del 2025. Lo ha stabilito il governo Schifani apprezzando, nella seduta odierna di giunta, la proposta di scorrimento della graduatoria della procedura concorsuale del 2021, avviata utilizzando le risorse previste dal Piano integrato di attività e organizzazione (Piao) 2025-2027. Altri 114 idonei potranno successivamente entrare nel Corpo forestale nel 2026. Le assunzioni, nel biennio, saranno in tutto 369. E’ quanto si legge in una nota della Regione Siciliana.\nNei prossimi mesi di quest’anno, dunque, sottolinea la nota, l’organico si rafforzerà con i 46 vincitori iniziali del concorso e con 208 nuovi reclutamenti, dei quali 20 unità in comando e 188 provenienti dallo scorrimento della graduatoria. Una sola unità sarà integrata in ottemperanza di una sentenza del tribunale di Termini Imerese, in seguito a contenzioso.\n“Oggi – afferma l’assessore al Territorio e all’ambiente, Giusi Savarino – viene compiuto quel passo avanti atteso da tempo nella riforma e nella riorganizzazione del settore, un punto di svolta nella soluzione delle criticità derivanti dalla carenza di personale. Abbiamo puntato a velocizzare le assunzioni attraverso lo scorrimento della graduatoria dell’ultimo concorso, facendo leva su una recente norma nazionale. Otteniamo così un notevole risparmio di tempo e di risorse per la pubblica amministrazione e andiamo incontro alle legittime aspettative di tanti giovani siciliani risultati idonei, che da tempo attendevano risposte. Ora finalmente potranno entrare in servizio. Quello del Corpo forestale – aggiunge l’assessore – è personale qualificato, in divisa, assunto con un corso-concorso per cui gli idonei, una volta esperita la visita medica, verranno adeguatamente preparati ad assolvere al loro importante compito di prevenzione, tutela ambientale, difesa del nostro territorio e di valorizzazione del patrimonio boschivo”.\nPropedeutica all’avvio delle procedure di assunzione sarà l’approvazione del rendiconto della Regione. A rendere possibile lo scorrimento della graduatoria del concorso espletato nel 2021, una norma nazionale (decreto legge del 14 marzo 2025) applicabile dall’amministrazione regionale, conclude la nota\n– Foto IPA Agency –\n(ITALPRESS)",

    "title": "Is Blue Heron Health’s Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Solution the Key to Lasting Liver Health?",
    "text": "Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most common liver conditions worldwide, affecting a significant portion of the global population. Unlike liver diseases related to alcohol consumption, NAFLD is primarily caused by lifestyle factors like poor diet, sedentary habits, and obesity. The accumulation of excess fat in the liver, without alcohol involvement, defines this disease. If left untreated, it can lead to serious liver complications such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and even liver cancer.\nEarly intervention in managing NAFLD is crucial, as the disease often shows few symptoms in its initial stages, making it challenging to detect. Once symptoms do arise—such as fatigue, mild pain in the upper right abdomen, or weakness—the disease may have already advanced. To address this, Blue Heron Health News offers a holistic program specifically designed to reverse the symptoms of NAFLD naturally and prevent its progression.\nThis post dives into the core principles of Blue Heron Health News’ NAFLD Solution, highlighting how it seeks to manage the disease through dietary changes, lifestyle modifications, and a sustainable, natural approach to liver health.\nUnderstanding Blue Heron Health News’ Approach\nBlue Heron Health News has built a reputation for providing natural, non-invasive solutions to various health issues, and their NAFLD program is no exception. Unlike conventional treatments that may focus on symptom management or introduce medications with potential side effects, Blue Heron Health News emphasizes empowering individuals to take control of their health through lifestyle adjustments.\nThe NAFLD Solution is built on holistic healing principles that encompass dietary shifts, exercise routines, stress management, and mindset transformations. Rather than offering a quick fix, the program focuses on sustainable habits that promote long-term health, guiding individuals in reducing liver fat, supporting liver function, and naturally preventing disease progression.\nOne of the program’s highlights is its personalized approach. While each person’s health journey is unique, the Blue Heron Health News’ NAFLD Solution provides universal strategies adaptable to each user’s specific needs and preferences, offering a comprehensive framework that contrasts with one-size-fits-all medical treatments.\nTake control of your liver health—start the NAFLD Solution today!\nKey Components of the NAFLD Solution\nBlue Heron Health News’ NAFLD Solution is based on three pillars: dietary adjustments, lifestyle modifications, and mental well-being. Each component plays an essential role in reversing the effects of NAFLD.\nDietary Adjustments\nDietary changes are at the heart of the NAFLD Solution, as nutrition profoundly impacts liver health. The program emphasizes eating whole, nutrient-dense foods rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds to support liver regeneration and reduce fatty buildup. Here’s a breakdown of the dietary changes advocated in the program:\n- Liver-Supporting Foods:\n- Leafy Greens: Vegetables like spinach, kale, and broccoli provide vitamins and minerals essential for liver detoxification and metabolic health.\n- Healthy Fats: Omega-3 fatty acids from sources like salmon, walnuts, and flaxseeds are included to reduce inflammation and support liver function.\n- Fruits High in Antioxidants: Berries, apples, and citrus fruits are recommended for their antioxidant content, which can protect liver cells from damage.\n- Foods to Avoid:\n- Refined Sugars: High-sugar foods contribute to fat accumulation in the liver, so it’s crucial to eliminate sodas, candies, and processed snacks.\n- Fried and Processed Foods: These foods often contain trans fats and harmful additives that impair liver health.\n- Alcohol: Although NAFLD is unrelated to alcohol, avoiding it can reduce the liver’s overall workload and promote healing.\n- Hydration:\n- Proper hydration is emphasized to flush out toxins and maintain metabolic balance. The program suggests drinking plenty of water throughout the day.\nBy incorporating these dietary changes, individuals can experience improved liver health, reduced inflammation, and better overall energy levels, helping to reverse NAFLD naturally.\nReverse NAFLD naturally with Blue Heron’s holistic approach. Join now!\nLifestyle Modifications\nApart from diet, lifestyle changes are instrumental in managing NAFLD effectively. The program recommends a few key lifestyle adjustments:\n- Regular Exercise:\n- Engaging in consistent physical activity helps reduce liver fat, enhance circulation, and boost metabolism. The NAFLD Solution includes guidelines for aerobic exercises, like walking and cycling, and strength training to optimize results.\n- Limiting Sedentary Time:\n- Prolonged periods of inactivity are detrimental to liver health. The program suggests setting hourly movement goals, which could be as simple as stretching, taking short walks, or performing quick bodyweight exercises.\n- Sleep Hygiene:\n- Quality sleep is essential for liver regeneration and immune function. Blue Heron Health News advises adopting a consistent sleep schedule, creating a calming pre-sleep routine, and avoiding screens before bed.\n- Stress Management Techniques:\n- Chronic stress contributes to inflammation and can exacerbate NAFLD symptoms. The program includes various stress management techniques, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, and journaling, which can help maintain a calm and balanced mindset.\nMindset and Motivation\nMindset plays a significant role in sustaining lifestyle changes. Blue Heron Health News recognizes the challenges of making long-term adjustments and provides tools to enhance motivation and encourage positive mental health. Here are some strategies included in the program:\n- Setting Realistic Goals:\n- By breaking down the journey into achievable milestones, the program makes it easier to track progress, celebrate small wins, and stay motivated.\n- Positive Affirmations and Visualization:\n- Visualization exercises and affirmations are incorporated to build self-belief and cultivate a positive outlook, which can lead to greater adherence to the program’s lifestyle changes.\n- Support Systems:\n- The program encourages individuals to seek support from friends, family, or online communities, providing a sense of accountability and shared motivation.\nSay goodbye to liver fat. Start your journey with the NAFLD Solution now!\nBenefits and Expected Outcomes of the NAFLD Solution\nThe Blue Heron Health News’ NAFLD Solution offers many benefits beyond liver health. Here’s what participants can expect:\n- Enhanced Liver Function: By following the program, individuals may experience a reduction in liver fat and improvement in enzyme levels, indicating healthier liver function.\n- Better Weight Management: The program’s dietary and exercise recommendations can support weight loss, which is particularly beneficial for those struggling with obesity.\n- Increased Energy Levels: Many users feel more energetic and less tired due to improved liver detoxification and metabolic health.\n- Improved Mental Clarity and Mood: As the liver processes toxins more efficiently, many find enhanced cognitive function and emotional stability.\n- Long-term Health Benefits: Following the program addresses NAFLD and reduces risks associated with related conditions, like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\nOverall, the NAFLD Solution provides a well-rounded approach to health that extends benefits throughout the body, enhancing quality of life and preventing liver disease progression.\nReal User Testimonials and Results\nMany users have shared positive testimonials about their experiences with the NAFLD Solution.

    "title": "Trump's COVID Response Was Worse Than We Remember, by Mona Charen | Creators Syndicate",
    "text": "Here are Trump's words from that infamous April 2020 press conference about Covid: \"So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light. ... And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. ... I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. ... And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning.\" Yet here we are, a little more than four years later, and the narrative about how COVID was handled has shifted. It now seems to be conventional wisdom that the worst errors we committed concerned massive shutdowns and school closings. We hear comparatively little about the large discrepancies between Republicans and Democrats in death rates because of the former's resistance to public health measures and vaccination. A serious country would look back at Trump's greatest challenge during his presidency and remember what an embarrassing failure it was. It began with denial of the problem. Trump told Bob Woodward in a February 2020 phone call that \"You just breathe the air and that's how it's passed. And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus. ... This is deadly stuff.\" But in his public statements, Trump repeatedly downplayed the seriousness of the virus. On Jan. 22, 2020, he said, \"We have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine.\" On Feb. 7, he tweeted: \"Great discipline is taking place in China, as President Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation.\" On Feb. 10, he again reported on a chat with Xi, reassuring Americans that \"I think China is very, you know, professionally run in the sense that they have everything under control.\" On Feb. 26, he urged people to wash their hands (fair enough) but then suggested that the new virus was \"the same as the flu\" — exactly the opposite of what he told Woodward. On Feb. 27, he predicted that COVID would \"disappear ... it's like a miracle.\" On Feb. 28, Trump said the Democrats were politicizing the coronavirus, calling it their \"new hoax.\" Trump's principal actions as chief executive in the early days of the pandemic were to enact travel bans from China and later Europe. He did nothing to initiate a testing program, though he did assert falsely that anyone who wanted a test could get one. In March, Trump urged that the Grand Princess cruise ship, with sick passengers aboard, not be permitted to dock in San Francisco because he didn't want to increase the number of cases counted in the United States. \"I like the numbers being where they are. I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.\" Also in March 2020, citing a small French study, Trump declared that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, taken together with an antibiotic, could be \"one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine\" and should \"be put in use immediately.\" On April 3, Trump mentioned that the CDC was now recommending that people wear masks but said that he would not wear one. By July, with the number of cases rising sharply, Trump suggested that the tests were picking up trivial cases: \" They have the sniffles and we put it down as a test.\" By that point, 3.7 million Americans had been infected and more than 140,000 had died. Also in July, Trump elevated Dr. Stella Immanuel on Twitter. Dr. Immanuel touted hydroxychloroquine as a cure for COVID and denied that masks were effective. She also believed that gynecological problems like cysts and endometriosis are caused by people having sex in their dreams with demons and witches. In a September 2020 campaign stop, Trump said that COVID affects \"virtually nobody,\" mainly just \"elderly people, elderly people with heart problems and other problems. If they have other problems, that's what it really affects, that's it.\" Trump modeled contempt for masking, mocking reporters and others for wearing them. He held huge rallies and White House indoor parties that became superspreader events. When he himself became infected with COVID, he failed to disclose it to associates like Chris Christie (who wound up in intensive care) and arguably attempted to infect Joe Biden at the first presidential debate. Trump denied the problem, failed to coordinate a federal response other than banning travel, embraced quack cures and modeled antisocial behavior. After first praising Xi Jinping to the skies for his \"strong\" control of the virus, he switched to name calling — the \"Kung Flu,\" the \"China virus\" — to incite xenophobic responses. He really did only one big thing right — backing Operation Warp Speed, which hastened the development of the vaccine. Now his party has gone full nutcase, demonizing Anthony Fauci. These are unserious people in thrall to a sociopathic clown. The U.S. death rate from COVID far exceeded that of peer nations. That was not due to excessive lockdowns or masking. It was due to incompetence in the White House. Time for a great remembering. Mona Charen is policy editor of The Bulwark and host of the \"Beg to Differ\" podcast.

    "title": "#127 Oscuro negocio de las citas online en Extranjería y DGT: los usuarios denuncian su acaparamiento por parte de mafias que usan bots",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#31](c31#c-31) Tan sencillo que ya se hace así. Al menos en tráfico sólo te atienden si la cita está a tu nombre. Pero hay dos problemas con ello:\n1. Eso no elimina el problema inicial. Se piden citas con bots, impidiendo que la gente que las quiere utilizar lo haga.\n2. Muchas de las citas sí se cogen a nombre de la persona que va a ir a la cita. Lo que hacen los locutorios es que te toman tus datos y con esos datos el bot te coge la cita.\nAsí que la solución que planteas funciona sólo un poco.\n[#91](c91#c-91) \"cualquier solución [...] sería infinitamente mejor que la situación actual\"\nInsisto, creo que no ves la realidad de como implementan soluciones(y especialmente digitales) las administraciones públicas.\n\"Seguro que el funcionario de la entrada sabrá discriminar cuando es alguien que pasa de pedir cita, y cuando es alguien que tiene una circunstancia muy rara\"\n¿cual funcionario de la entrada? ¿el segurata que no es su función y no es ni funcionario?\nInsisto: no digo que no esté bien que pongan más medidas, pero insisto en que no suele ser \"a cambio de nada\" sino que suele ser \"a cambio de putear aún más a los que peor situación se encuentran\"...\n¡¡¡Y claro que QUIERO que lo mejoren!!!\n[#106](c106#c-106) en la renovación del DNI, el funcionario de la entrada es un policía nacional\nEn las otras administraciones puede ser un funcionario de escala básica (aunque el segurata también puede tener un mínimo de formación, y irte enseñando si se equivoca)\nEstamos de acuerdo, cualquier cosa va a tener sus defectos, es imposible llegar al 100% de la población, pero en este momento estos sistemas de citas están llegando al 1% de la población, así que si un cambio consigue llegar al 90% de la población, habrás mejorado el sistema un 900%, que no está mal.\n[#122](c122#c-122) no te sigo...\nSi el sistema no te deja saturarlo con reservas falsas (bien porque no se permiten cambios de nombre/DNI/pasaporte/matrícula, porque se requiere sms de confirmación y X reservas máximas desde el mismo número, o incluso porque se te pide un pago simbólico por adelantado), cualquier persona podría reservar por si misma.\nPor lo que leo parte del problema es que todas las citas están cogidas. Habrá X citas que se usan con cambio de nombre, y otras muchas que simplemente se vencen sin asistencia.\n[#123](c123#c-123) Si se están pagando de 50 a 100 pavos por cita, puedes permitirte pillar las citas con datos reales que necesites y para el resto tirar de servicios de teléfonos móviles virtuales que te permitan saturar las que queden libres. Lo único que veo es que las mafias tenderían a centralizarse más por economía, pero lo seguirían haciendo.\n[#125](c125#c-125) No se a que te refieres, tu les dices consigueme una cita mi nombre es X y mi documento es tal, no te hackean ni nada. El bot se mete en la web y te saca la cita monitorizando la web y en cuanto hay disponibles te la saca. Si tu lo intentas manualmente nunca lo vas a consegjir. Porque los bots las pillan todas.\n[#17](c17#c-17) No, la \"solución\" de genbeta es una puta chorrada. Simplemente tienen que cambiar el bot para que en lugar de usar datos inventados, use un listado de datos que le pasen. Cuando vayas a comprar una cita, anotan tus datos, se los pasan al bot y hace la reserva a tu nombre.\nEl problema es bastante más complicado, especialmente mientras haya gente dispuesta a pagar esas cantidades para conseguir una cita. Yo diría que lo mejor sería atacar a los revendedores y crujirlos a base de bien, empezando por todos esos locutorios que lo anuncian descaradamente y hacer campañas informativas con teléfonos/correos habilitados para denunciar los puntos de venta.\ncc\n[#20](c20#c-20)\n[#40](c40#c-40) yo vivo fuera también y lo tramité hace un par de meses totalmente online, tuve que dar un poder online a mi hermana (por medio de la web de la dgt creo que fué, y luego fue ella a recogerlo a mi nombre y me lo mando por correo). Tuve suerte de que justo me deje unas fotos mias de tamaño carné en España que pudo usar .\nEso si, tuve que llamar y mandar email para tener seguro el procedimiento ya que lo que encontraba online no era muy preciso y ni ellos mismo se aclaraban muchas veces depende a quien preguntabas. Al final todo funcionó online y lo tuve hecho en menos de una semana (me sorprendió para bien la verdad).\n[#95](c95#c-95) en eso está la clave: que no sea posible cancelar visitas.\nHabrá huecos vaciós, pero también se puede hacer un poco de overbooking para compensar una parte.\n[#103](c103#c-103) los bots no pueden hacer magia.\nSi reservan una cita, no saben leer el futuro y saber a qué nombre/DNI reservarla\nSi, se puede competir con bots\n[#117](c117#c-117) jajajjajajjajajajajjajajjjajajajjaja\nMe ha recordado poderosamente a\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/3770g6/state_of_javascript_frameworks_in_a_nutshell/",

    "text": "光大期货：5月8日能源化工日报\n原油;)：\n周三油价重心回落，其中WTI 6月合约收盘下跌1.02美元至58.07美元/桶，跌幅1.73%。布伦特7月合约收盘下跌1.03美元至61.12美元/桶，跌幅1.66%。SC2506以459元/桶收盘，下跌7.1元/桶，跌幅1.52%。美联储周三维持利率不变，但指出通胀和失业率上升的风险增加，在联储努力评估关税政策的影响之际，这进一步令经济前景蒙阴。FOMC表示，经济前景的不确定性进一步增加。在这次会议上，决策者们一致同意将指标利率目标区间维持在4.25%-4.50%不变。EIA公布的库存报告显示，截至5月2日当周，美国商业原油库存减少200万桶，至4.384亿桶，此前市场预期为减少80万桶。截至5月2日当周，美国航空燃料需求增加47.4万桶/日，自2019年12月以来首次突破200万桶/日。美国航空燃料需求四周均值亦创2019年12月以来最高水平，增加3.9万桶/日至186万桶/日。从当前市场驱动来看，OPEC+增产以及海外经济前景等不确定性令油价承压，地缘扰动却支撑油市看涨情绪，整体来看，市场在矛盾中前行，但价格整体表现仍将震荡偏弱。\n燃料油;)：\n周三，上期所燃料油主力合约FU2507收涨2.05%，报2888元/吨；低硫燃料油主力合约LU2506收涨3.02%，报3448元/吨。据金联创开工率计算公式显示，截至5月7日，中国地炼常减压开工率为64.24%，较上周跌0.14个百分点。预计5月东西方套利到货量减少将在短期内支撑低硫市场基本面，低硫船燃下游加注需求相对稳定，对市场基本面稍有支撑；高硫燃料油也受益于中东夏季发电需求改善预期的支撑，但原料采购需求低迷仍将施压市场，且来自中东货源将在4月底陆续抵达。预计短期FU和FU绝对价格将跟随成本端原油波动，但是自身基本面的支撑仍存。\n沥青：\n周三，上期所沥青主力合约BU2506收涨2.66%，报3432元/吨。百川盈孚统计，本周国内炼厂沥青总库存水平为29.17%，较上周下降0.42%；本周社会库存率为35.65%，较上周上涨0.12%；本周国内沥青厂装置总开工率为29.81%，较上周上升2.10%。随着加工利润的修复，供应有继续增加的预期。4月政治局会议提及“加快地方政府专项债券、超长期特别国债等发行使用”，预计专项债发行节奏有望加快。近期随着天气转暖，终端项目陆续开工，北方地区节前备货积极性尚可，加之部分炼厂社会库存低位，市场需求有所支撑；南方地区刚需略显平稳，部分地区降雨有所阻碍。预计短期BU绝对价格将跟随成本端原油波动，需要关注供应端产量上升带来的压力。\n橡胶：\n周三，截至日盘收盘沪胶主力RU2509下跌5元/吨至14810元/吨，NR主力上涨20元/吨至12575元/吨，丁二烯橡胶BR主力上涨60元/吨至11375元/吨。昨日上海全乳胶14700（+0），全乳-RU2509价差-170（-60），人民币混合14400（-50），人混-RU2509价差-470（-110），BR9000齐鲁现货11600（-100），BR9000-BR主力270（-205）。截至2025年5月4日，中国天然橡胶社会库存135.5万吨，环比增加0.17万吨，增幅0.12%。中国深色胶社会总库存为82.5万吨，环比增加0.32%。中国浅色胶社会总库存为53万吨，环比降0.2%。橡胶基本面表现偏弱，终端市场需求弱，对开工形成负向反馈，中期胶价易跌难涨，短期泰国推迟割胶对原料以及橡胶价格有支撑作用。关注后续各国间关税协商动态。\nPX&PTA;)&MEG：\nTA509昨日收盘在4466元/吨，收涨2.38%；现货报盘升水09合约107元/吨。EG2509昨日收盘在4199元/吨，收涨1.67%，基差减少7元/吨至46元/吨，现货报价4255元/吨。PX期货主力合约509收盘在6288元/吨，收涨2.58%。现货商谈价格为768美元/吨，折人民币价格6374元/吨，基差走扩20元/吨至104元/吨。江浙涤丝产销高低分化，个别FDY、DTY销售较好，平均产销估算在6成偏上。华东一套250万吨PTA装置今日开始停车，预计5.22附近恢复。华东一套300万吨PTA装置目前重启中，该装置4.25附近停车检修。山西一套30万吨/年的合成气制乙二醇;)装置计划5月14日停车检修，时长一周左右，该装置由于原料气不足目前负荷在5成偏上。中东局势紧张引发潜在供应风险，国际油价上涨，下游涤丝产销小幅放量，PX&PTA检修与重启并存，PTA继续去库，现货基差较强，短期价格跟随成本波动。乙二醇港口库存去库，本周预计到港量有所收窄，社会库存去化将兑现于港口库存，国内检修计划仍在继续，乙二醇相对抗跌。\n甲醇：\n周三，太仓现货价格2422元/吨，内蒙古北线价格在2095元/吨，CFR中国价格在256-260美元/吨，CFR东南亚价格在337-342美元/吨。下游方面，山东地区甲醛价格1125元/吨，江苏地区醋酸价格2520-2630元/吨，山东地区MTBE价格4850元/吨。供应方面，后续国内供应稳定，进口量稳步回升，整体供应有增加预期。需求方面，MTO装置检修延期，5月需求不会有大幅下降，而传统下游变动也相对有限，预计5月总需求维持相对稳定。整体来看，5月供应有增加预期，需求保持稳定，库存将不再下降，价格支撑有所松动。\n聚烯烃：\n周三，华东拉丝主流在7170-7300元/吨，利润方面，油制PP毛利355.6元/吨，煤制PP生产毛利961.47元/吨，甲醇制PP生产毛利-802.67元/吨，丙烷脱氢制PP生产毛利-689.7元/吨，外采丙烯制PP生产毛利-143.1元/吨。PE方面，HDPE主流价格8029元/吨，LDPE主流价格9190元/吨，LLDPE主流价格7500元/吨；利润端，油制聚乙烯市场毛利为188元/吨；煤制聚乙烯市场毛利为1171元/吨。供应端炼厂检修陆续落地，同时轻烃路线产能利用率下降，预计产量有所下滑，但需求端同样将进入淡季，并且节前下游备货，后续库存降幅放缓，预计聚烯烃价格震荡偏弱。\n聚氯乙烯：\n周三，华东PVC;)市场电石法价格小涨，电石法5型料4670-4830元/吨，乙烯料主流参考4900-5150元/吨左右；华北PVC市场价格稳中小涨，电石法5型料主流参考4680-4770元/吨左右，乙烯料主流参考4920-5020元/吨；华南PVC市场价格窄幅调整，电石法5型料主流参考4800-4900元/吨左右，乙烯料主流报价在4960-5050元/吨。从水泥发运率和螺纹钢表观需求的数据来看，房地产施工将进入淡季，对于PVC下游管材和型材的需求也有所拖累，开工率会有小幅回落，并且临近印度BIS认证实施时间，出口或将回落。综合来看，PVC5月基本面宽松，库存压力增加，现货价格相对偏弱，虽然主力合约V2509有旺季预期，但受现货疲软影响上行空间有限，预计价格维持低位震荡，基差走弱。\n尿素：\n周三尿素期货价格偏强震荡，主力09合约收盘价1886元/吨，涨幅0.96%。现货市场继续上调，主流地区价格上调幅度10~30元/吨，山东、河南地区市场价格均已涨至1900元/吨。基本面来看，昨日仍有企业检修，尿素日产水平进一步回落至19.92万吨，日环比降0.24万吨。需求端处于夏季用肥高峰期，但当前市场跟进情绪较为谨慎。一方面在于近期价格持续上涨，部分对高价存在抵触情绪，另一方面在于近期出口消息面影响持续发酵，产业多持观望态度以等待相关出口政策及会议落地。昨日收盘后出口相关会议及消息层出不穷，但实际情况仍有待进一步验证。整体来看，短期尿素市场出口消息扰动力度持续提升，期货盘面短期仍将延续偏强趋势，但价格上涨过多也仍将触发保供稳价机制，关注需求力度、出口形势变化及保供稳价政策导向。\n纯碱：\n周三纯碱期货价格震荡走弱，主力09合约收盘价1323元/吨，微幅下跌0.9%。夜盘跌势延续，主力合约跌幅达到2.7%。现货市场多数报价稳定，昨日沙河及周边地区重碱价格1316元/吨，日环比涨15元/吨。基本面来看，假期之后部分企业检修落实，行业开工率昨日降至84.87%，后期纯碱供应仍有下降预期，但盘面对此交易逻辑逐渐减弱。需求端仍按需跟进，近期重碱刚需水平略有回落，采购需求也以低价货源成交为主。整体来看，纯碱基本面驱动有限，宏观政策交易逻辑也暂告一段落，关注行业检修能否给市场带来支撑，中长期纯碱宽松格局不改。关注碱厂检修力度、今日库存数据、宏观情绪变化。\n玻璃：\n周三玻璃期货价格走强后回落，主力09合约收盘价1074元/吨，微幅上涨0.09%。夜盘玻璃期价延续跌势，主力合约跌幅近3%。现货市场多数稳定，昨日国内浮法玻璃市场均价稳定在1271元/吨。假期之后玻璃产线暂无变化，行业日熔量稳定在15.58万吨。需求端刚需跟进为主，下游开工虽持续恢复但进度依旧偏慢，对原片玻璃采购也以刚需为主。昨日主流地区现货产销率多数维持100%，湖北地区略偏弱，产销82%附近，区域间表现仍有分化。整体来看，玻璃市场对宏观政策逻辑交易暂告一段落，供需层面新增驱动依旧有限，盘面向下突破前期低点，日内或延续偏弱态势。关注玻璃现货成交情况、库存数据及宏观情绪变化。",

    "text": "Nave di Mosca affondata in Crimea\nUna nave portamissili della marina russa è stata affondata ieri da un drone marino ucraino in Crimea. L’ennesimo attacco a segno realizzato dalle forze di Kiev dimostra ancora una volta l’incapacità di Mosca di proteggere il suo articolato apparato militare d’occupazione e, di contro, l’incessante opera dei servizi segreti militari ucraini. Stavolta si tratta di una nave classe Tarantul, una portamissili chiamata Ivanovets usata per trasportare missili lungo le coste del Mar Nero. L’attacco è avvenuto nella notte ed è stato ripreso dalla telecamera termica del drone marino teleguidato che si è avvicinato alla corazzata mentre questa era di stanza nel lago Donuzlav, uno specchio d’acqua dolce molto profondo a ridosso della costa occidentale della Crimea che sfocia direttamente in mare e per questo viene usato dalla marina di Mosca come zona d’ancoraggio.\nDalla nave russa si sono accorti all’ultimo del barchino imbottito d’esplosivo e hanno provato ad abbatterlo sparando, ma era troppo tardi. Le esplosioni hanno squarciato lo scafo provocando l’affondamento del grosso natante. Al momento dei marinai a bordo non c’è traccia. Si tratta di «una perdita piuttosto significativa» secondo le autorità di Kiev.",
