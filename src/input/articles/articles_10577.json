    "title": "Water spout forms on the Brisbane River as supercell thunderstorm brings hail to city",
    "text": "In short: A water spout has formed on the Brisbane River near Kangaroo Point. Meteorologist Shane Kennedy said it is a rare and \"exciting\" phenomenon. What's next? The Bureau of Meteorology said the worst of the storms are over. A water spout has momentarily appeared on the Brisbane River today after a severe but short-lived supercell swept across the city. Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Shane Kennedy told ABC Radio Brisbane it was an extremely rare and \"exciting\" weather phenomenon. \"It's a bit of a weak water spout across the river lasting for a handful of seconds, possibly up to half a minute,\" he said. \"They're pretty rare; often we'll get some more erratic swirling winds associated with a thunderstorm but you often can't see them. \"It looks like we got lots of good footage of it from different angles, so pretty exciting to see.\" He said this particular water spout appeared to be a weak whirlwind, but was not quite strong enough to be classified as a tornado. He said water spouts were caused by strong downdrafts forming into a swirling vortex pattern, sucking up water as it went. Mr Kennedy said the severe thunderstorms were continuing to track north across the coast, but the worst of the weather should be over. He said the storms had brought hail about three to four centimetres in length, but the it should have largely subsided. Queensland Ambulance Service (QAS) said a 22-year-old man had suffered ankle and head injuries after being hit by a falling tree branch at the bottom of Kangaroo Point cliffs. It comes after reports the water spout had uprooted a tree at the top of Kangaroo Point cliffs, causing it to fall to the bottom. The QAS spokesperson said the man was in a stable condition. Student Li Mengtong was caught in the storm near the water spout while out for a walk along Kangaroo Point. With trees and branches falling around him, he said he was forced to hold on to a railing to avoid being blown over. Mr Mengtong said he was lucky to be saved by two nearby workers who called him over to their car. \"These two people saved me, they saved my life,\" he told the ABC. ABC Radio Brisbane listener, Michelle from South Bank, said she was astonished when she looked out of her balcony and saw the towering vortex. \"We looked towards the Kangaroo Point cliffs and there was this huge water spout picking up leaves and water and everything,\" Michelle said. \"Then it caught a tree on the top of Kangaroo Point cliffs and half of it fell to the bottom. \"Then this massive rainbow appeared, so we had rain, hail, sun, rainbow, and a water spout.\" Delays at Brisbane Airport Brisbane Airport is experiencing delays after the storm, but there have been no reports of damage to the terminal or aircraft. \"There was a short burst of small hail, as the severe cell dropped a rapid 7mm of rain, before sunshine quickly returned,\" airport spokesperson Peter Doherty said. \"As a precaution, engineers are conducting inspections of aircraft to ensure there's no hail damage, before clearing them for flight.\" \"Departures are experiencing an average 50-minute delay, with arriving flights an average 30 minutes behind schedule.\"",

The 43-year-old singer brought out his old NSYNC bandmates Chris Kirkpatrick, Lance Bass, Joey Fantone, and JC Chasez for a very special performance that won the hearts of the audience, making them go wild.\nTimberlake shared a video on his Instagram story where the curtains behind him on stage pulled back, and the whole band was seen as they sang Gone together. The video also featured the fans screaming in joy from this sudden surprise.\nAuthor Chrissy Teigen was also in attendance at the show with her husband, singer John Legend. She shared a clip of the band singing Girlfriend on her Instagram story along with the caption \"oh my f**king God @justintimberlake.” Teigen also shared clips of her singing along with the band’s songs Bye Bye Bye and It’s Gonna Be Me at the concert.\nAfter the show was over, Justin Timberlake shared a photo of five empty stools on his Instagram account. Lance Bass commented on the post saying, “That was fun. Let’s do it again soon,” along with a smiley face emoji. The official Instagram account of NSYNC also commented on the post saying “Paradise” which is the song from Timberlake’s upcoming album which the band collaborated on.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake)\n\\n Timberlake’s upcoming album release is giving NSYNC fans hope for a reunion tour\nJustin Timberlake’s highly anticipated album Everything I Thought It Was is coming out on Friday, 16th March, and fans are really excited about it. The tracklist for the album was revealed earlier in March on a huge billboard in L.A., and that was when fans got to know that the band was finally coming together after they collaborated on the Trolls: Band Together track Better Place, for Paradise.\nA few hours before the show in L.A., Timberlake shared a snippet of the track on his Instagram account, tagging the band. Lance Bass commented on the post saying “I’ve been waiting forever, right here for this moment,” which is part of the lyrics of the song. Afterward, all of them performed the song together on stage, giving their audience a once-in-a-lifetime moment to cherish forever.\nThe band’s track Better Place for the 2023 Trolls: Band together was their first collaboration in two decades. The band celebrated the occasion by attending the red carpet premiere of the film, as well as the MTV VMAs. After that, Timberlake announced his album and came on The Kelly Clarkson Show where he hinted at their Paradise reunion by saying, \"there may be a little something in the future.\" The singer’s Forget Tomorrow World Tour will begin on 29th April, in Vancouver, Canada.\nFans of Timberlake and NSYNC are really excited to see if the rest of the bandmates will join Timberlake for any of the tour destinations to perform together on stage.\nPICS: Travis Kelce DITCHES Taylor Swift ONCE AGAIN, as NFL Star Attends Justin Timberlake&apos;s Concert in Los Angeles\nNSYNC Reunite On-Stage with Justin Timberlake to Perform New Song; See Here",

Clear skies on March 19, 2024, allowed the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument on NASA’s Terra satellite to capture this image of snow covering the Rocky Mountains.\nA potent low-pressure system swept through the state on March 13 and 14, bringing 10 to 20 inches (25 to 50 centimeters) to the Denver and Boulder metropolitan areas. Some of the highest snowfall totals were recorded on March 14 in the high elevations of the southern Rocky Mountains, according to NOAA’s daily snowfall observations. In Nederland, 28 miles northwest of Denver, 53 inches of snow was recorded after the storm.\nThe snowstorm caused power outages, road closures, and 800 canceled flights at Denver International Airport. According to news reports, Interstate 70, which runs through the Rockies, was closed for much of March 14 due to safety concerns.\nRead more at\nNASA Earth Observatory\nImage: NASA Earth Observatory image by Wanmei Liang, using MODIS data from NASA EOSDIS LANCE and GIBS/Worldview.",

    "text": "Ederson, do Manchester City, é substituído após choque de cabeça e reclama muito\n+ ✅Clique aqui para seguir o canal ge Futebol Internacional no WhatsApp\nEderson é titular do gol do Manchester City há sete temporadas. É o goleiro do momento mais mágico da história do clube. Então, por que, depois de tanto tempo e sem que esse status tenha mudado, o brasileiro cogita deixar o clube? A resposta a essa pergunta passa por vários fatores. E, segundo o portal The Athletic , até mesmo por elogios que o reserva Stefan Ortega recebeu em momento decisivo da última Premier League .\nA possibilidade de transferência é real. Ederson foi sondado pelo Al-Nassr e, agora, é alvo concreto do Al-Ittihad, o time de Benzema e Fabinho na Arábia Saudita. A negociação pode ser concluída nos próximos dias. Aos 30 anos, o goleiro estava perto de uma renovação de contrato com o Manchester City. Mas agora quer sair.\nO The Athletic revelou bastidores desse desejo do jogador, que passa por um momento particular no fim da temporada passada. Na 34ª rodada da Premier League , contra o Tottenham, Ederson chocou o rosto com o joelho do zagueiro Cuti Romero e precisou ser substituído. E não escondeu sua raiva (assista acima) .\n+ Veja a tabela da Premier League 2024/25\n+ Guardiola não garante permanência de Ederson no Manchester City\nTottenham 0 x 2 Manchester City | Melhores momentos | Campeonato Inglês\nO alemão Ortega entrou em seu lugar e, com uma defesa incrível no segundo tempo em chute de Son, foi essencial para a vitória do Manchester City naquele jogo. Guardiola chegou a dizer, depois da partida, que “o Arsenal seria campeão”, se não fosse pela intervenção do goleiro reserva (veja o lance no vídeo acima) .\nSegundo o The Athletic , os elogios exagerados a Ortega afetaram Ederson. Parte da torcida aproveitou o momento para questionar a titularidade do brasileiro, ao indicar que ele não seria capaz de defender aquela bola. E o ex-Benfica repensou sua situação no clube inglês.\n1 de 2 Ortega faz incrível defesa em chute de Son durante Tottenham x Manchester City — Foto: Marc Atkins/Getty Images Ortega faz incrível defesa em chute de Son durante Tottenham x Manchester City — Foto: Marc Atkins/Getty Images\nPor meio de pessoas próximas, Ederson negou, ao ge , que a situação tenha incomodado. Ele admite que ficou chateado por ter que deixar o jogo, mas logo foi diagnosticado com um grave problema no rosto e entendeu a substituição. O brasileiro sofreu uma fratura , que o tirou da Copa América.\nO The Athletic diz que Ortega se sente confiante para ser o goleiro principal do Manchester City no momento. O alemão encerrou a temporada no gol, com a confirmação do título da Premier League, e ampliou o contrato com o clube até 2026 .\nGuardiola e o City, por sua vez, ainda consideram Ederson o titular. Isso é indiscutível. O técnico chegou a fazer elogios públicos ao brasileiro na reta final de 2023/24, em uma tentativa de reiterar o peso do goleiro nas conquistas da equipe. Mas, no momento, lidam com a possível saída.\n2 de 2 Ortega entra no lugar de Ederson em Tottenham x Manchester City: goleiro brasileiro cogita deixar o time inglês — Foto: Dylan Martinez/Reuters Ortega entra no lugar de Ederson em Tottenham x Manchester City: goleiro brasileiro cogita deixar o time inglês — Foto: Dylan Martinez/Reuters\nSegundo o The Athletic, o clube não queria negociar o brasileiro. Mas, diante do desejo do goleiro, podem negociá-lo, mas não por menos de € 60 milhões (R$ 368 milhões). Ederson priorizava uma equipe europeia, mas presença de vários nomes expressivos para a Arábia Saudita o deixam mais confortável com a possível transferência.\nNo único amistoso de pré-temporada até o momento, Ortega começou como titular na derrota por 4 a 3 para o Celtic, e Ederson atuou no segundo tempo. A expectativa é que o futuro do brasileiro seja definido até a próxima semana, seja pela permanência no time inglês, ou pela negociação com o Al-Ittihad.\nManchester City Premier League",
