    "title": "Elizabeth Warren Rips Trump In DNC Speech/Vance Couch Gag",
    "text": "Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) went off on former President Donald Trump during her speech at the Democratic National Convention, and drew laughs with a brutal reference to couches.\nThe Democratic National Convention ( DNC ) entered its final hours Thursday night, with anticipation high for Vice President Kamala Harris — and maybe another surprise guest.\nWarren took the stage to a thunderous and extended ovation that moved her to tears .\nBut then, Warren got to work tearing chunks out of Trump and praising VP Harris — and threw in an unsubtle reference to sectional healing :\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN: Donald Trump, the felon, has no plans to lower costs for families. He doesn’t know how. And basically, he doesn’t really care. When did he ever fill up a gas tank or worry about a grocery bill? The only bills he worries about are from his criminal defense lawyers.\nBut Kamala, she cares deep down, and she will take on the giant corporations that are squeezing American families. In fact, it’s something she’s done before, during the California wildfires.\nShe went after the price gouging during the pandemic. We worked together in the Senate to stop price gouging.\nAnd as president, she will lower costs for your family. She’ll take on the Wall Street firms that buy up millions of houses and apartments, and then jack up the rent.\nShe’ll take on drug companies that charge an arm and a leg for prescriptions.\nShe’ll take on corporate monopolies that rip off consumers and billionaires who don’t pay taxes.\nAnd she’ll take on right wing extremists who think they should decide who has access to abortion or IVF. Kamala will protect abortion rights nationwide.\nAnd there it is. Groceries. Gas. Housing. Health care. Taxes. Abortion. Trust Donald Trump and JD Vance to look out for your family? Shoot, I wouldn’t let those guys–. I wouldn’t trust them to move my couch!\nCROWD: (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN: We need Kamala Harris!\nThis election is about your family and your future. I’ve seen Kamala Harris fight. I’ve seen her win. And when it comes to our families and our futures Kamala Harris is someone we can trust.\nSo here it is with joy in our hearts. Let’s elect Kamala Harris, the next president of the United States!\nWatch above via C-SPAN .\nHave a tip for us? tips@mediaite.com",

    "title": "Mama June Calls Out ‘Pawn Stars’ For Damaged Delivery",
    "text": "Mama June Shannon is calling out the famed Pawn Stars reality series for a damaged delivery she just received. She just spent time in Las Vegas with her family and headed to the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop. That is where the show is filmed and June decided to make a few purchases. Unfortunately, one was delivered to her home and it did not arrive the way she had hoped. So, what is she saying about the item? Keep reading for more details and to see the unboxing video.\nMama June Calls Out Pawn Stars For Damaged Delivery Recently, Mama June, Justin Stroud, Pumpkin Efird, her boyfriend, Darrin Kitchens, and a few friends headed to Las Vegas. Fans could not believe how Pumpkin and Darrin were acting plus how he was jokingly being referred to as “stepdaddy.” While they were out there, they decided to check out some local haunts. One of them was the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop where Pawn Stars is filmed. June made it clear she and Pumpkin were in the building with the hopes they would get special treatment.\nMama June-YouTube She found a ring she really liked as well as a crystal tree which she negotiated down to just over $1K. It had to be shipped to her in Georgia and it has finally arrived. June was so excited to unbox it that she filmed the moment as her husband, Justin gently took it out. It was wrapped up and sealed tightly, filled with so much popcorn in the box. Unfortunately, they quickly discovered different pieces, including the base, were broken off.\n@officialmamajune @Pawn Stars this is thw #crystaltree i got whike in #vegas but @UPS didnt care it was #fragile im so saf not mad at thw #pawnstars though #brokentree _ #crystal #lasvevas #famouspawnshop #upsaucks #fragilepackage #upsdontcare #adultaonly ♬ original sound – Mama June\nIn the caption, she attempted to alert Pawn Stars to the issue but blamed the delivery service for not caring it was fragile. On her TikTok , Mama June’s fans immediately had some suggestions:\nThe insurance should cover it. Just take pics of the damage and file a claim. UPS will reimburse if you had insurance That was the big question if she had gotten extra insurance because if that was the case, this should and would be a non-issue. They also felt bad that this piece broke.\nRefund Waiting? Though her followers on TikTok were very supportive, over on Reddit it was believed that Mama June just wanted a refund. It was noted that June talked about the packaging and not how thrilled she was to see her new piece. Others commented on how much she paid for such a hideous piece:\nMaybe it’s just me, but it seems odd to me that the narration seemed to be fixated on the condition the item would arrive in. If I was doing an unboxing of something I wasn’t aware was broke, at least fifty percent of my narration would be talking about the piece and why I purchased it or why I was excited to receive it. Paid $1k for that junk???? 🙄🙄 Most of the damage is at the bottom, somebody dropped that damn box. She’s blaming UPS Some are skeptical of June while others still maintain she could have given that money to Alana ‘Honey Boo Boo’ Thompson. Do you think June will fix up the item while calling out Pawn Stars for a refund? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.",

    "text": "The government of Uttar Pradesh has received proposals for projects totalling around Rs 40,038 crore under its new policy to incentivise semiconductor manufacturing and attract global investments in the state, its investment promotion agency Invest UP said in a statement.Hiranandani group’s Tarq Semiconductor is expected to invest Rs 28,440 crore while Kaynes Technologies subsidiary Kaynes Semicon is set to invest Rs 4,248 crore. Aditech Semiconductor has proposed an investment of Rs 3,751 crore and Vamasundari Investment Delhi has planned to invest Rs 3,599 crore, the statement noted.The projects are expected to create over 32,000 jobs in the state, it said.“The Uttar Pradesh semiconductor policy is poised to revolutionize the industrial landscape of the state, making it a pivotal player in the global semiconductor market,” Invest UP said, adding that the policy not only aligns with national objectives but also positions the state as a competitive and attractive destination for semiconductor investments.The ‘strategic move’ is expected to attract further investments and pave the way for UP to emerge as a leading industrial hub in the country, it said.UP follows states like Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which have been vying to attract chip manufacturers to their turf, to have a dedicated semiconductor policy.The policy provides for an additional capital subsidy of 50 per cent on the capital subsidy approved by the union government under the India Semiconductor Mission, along with a five per cent per annum interest subsidy with investment up to Rs 200 crores, the statement said.It covers aspects including compound semiconductors, silicon photonics devices and integrated circuits in addition to manufacturing of components like ATMP (Assembly, Testing, Marking, and Packaging), OSOT (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test), ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems), and sensors.“The semiconductor policy is a testament to our dedication to creating a conducive environment for technological innovation and industrial growth in Uttar Pradesh. We are focused on facilitating seamless investment processes and ensuring timely approvals for projects,” said UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath.By fostering a robust semiconductor ecosystem, the state aims to leverage its strategic advantages to boost economic development and technological advancement, the statement said.The state government is working to ensure adequate land and infrastructure for these projects and coordinating with the central government and relevant stakeholders to expedite implementation of the policy, it added.Sunil Kumar Sharma, minister for information technology and electronics, government of UP, said that the state is attempting to create an ecosystem to develop IT hubs and that semiconductors, which are found in almost every instrument of day-to-day life, are the spine of any economy.",

O alerta de temporal, que pode passar em 200mm em 24 horas alguns pontos, segue valendo. A média histórica de todo o mês de março é de 124mm. De acordo com a Prefeitura, núcleos de chuva já podem ser formar agora pela manhã.Segundo o Centro Nacional de Monitoramento e Alertas de Desastres Naturais, há o risco da intensidade do temporal ser semelhante à tragédia de 2011, na Região Serrana, que matou mais de 900 pessoas.Diante da previsão de alto impacto, o governador do Rio, Cláudio Castro, decretou ponto facultativo. O Tribunal de Justiça e a Assembleia Legislativa do Rio não irão funcionar hoje.O governador garantiu que o Comitê Permanente de Chuvas do Estado está pronto para atender todas as demandas municipais. Segundo Castro, as questões contratuais de compras já foram realizadas para que as equipes do governo possam auxiliar no socorro à população e também na limpeza e reconstrução das cidades caso seja necessário. Cidades da Baixada e da Região Serrana já começaram a se preparar e montaram gabinetes de crise.Na cidade do Rio, equipes foram reforçadas. A Câmara Municipal do Rio também não funcionará nesta sexta (22) devido a alerta de fortes chuvas na cidade.O Governo Federal decide suspender o expediente dos órgãos e entidades federais localizados no Rio de Janeiro. A medida vale excepcionalmente para esta sexta-feira (22) em decorrência das fortes chuvas previstas para o estado fluminense. Devido à previsão de forte chuva para os próximos dias, universidades cancelaram as atividades ou adotaram o modelo de aulas virtuais. Por segurança, a Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) decidiu suspender as aulas nos campi de Nova Friburgo e Petrópolis, na Região Serrana, e de Angra dos Reis, na Costa Verde Fluminense, até domingo (24). O campus de Niterói teve as aulas desta quinta-feira (21) canceladas. Já a Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro anunciou que as aulas desta sexta-feira (22) vão acontecer de forma virtual gravada.",
