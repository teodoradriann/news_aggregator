    "text": "- Category\nLatest news\nRussia’s Troop Losses in Ukraine Now Hit 1 Million, General Staff Says\nRussia’s total military losses in Ukraine have surpassed 1,000,000 personnel, including those killed, wounded, or incapacitated, according to a June 12 report by Ukraine’s General Staff.\nOn June 11 alone, Russian forces sustained an additional 1,140 casualties, the General Staff added, along with dozens of units of military equipment destroyed.\n“The overall losses of the Russian occupying forces in manpower since the beginning of the full-scale invasion have reached one million,” the General Staff stated. “More than 628,000 occurred in just the past year and a half.”\nBreakdown of Russian casualties by year:\n2022: 106,720 troops lost — averaging 340 per day\n2023: 253,290 troops — averaging 693 per day\n2024: 430,790 troops — averaging 1,177 per day\n2025 (as of June 4): Over 200,000 troops — averaging 1,286 per day\nUkraine first began publicly tracking and publishing Russian losses on March 1, 2022, when the count stood at 5,710 killed and 200 captured. The next day, losses rose to 5,840, and by March 3, the figure was revised upward to 9,000 after verification.\nSome of the heaviest days of Russian losses occurred on:\nNovember 28, 2024: 2,030 casualties in a single day\nDecember 19, 2024: 2,200 casualties\nDecember 29, 2024: 2,010 casualties\nThe Ukrainian military emphasized that the one-million mark is not just a statistic but a symbol of resistance and resilience.\n“One million. That’s how much the enemy’s offensive potential has diminished,” the General Staff wrote. “One million who could have destroyed us, but whom we destroyed instead.”\nThe statement went on to highlight the symbolic meaning behind this figure, referencing sites of mass Russian losses and Ukrainian suffering—from the Red Forest near Chornobyl and the Dnipro River near the Antonivsky Bridge, to the hills of Donbas, the fields of Kharkiv region, and the depths of the Black Sea, where the cruiser Moskva lies.\n“This is our answer for Bucha, Irpin, Kupiansk, Kherson,” the statement continued. “For the maternity hospital in Mariupol, for the Ohmatdyt children’s hospital destroyed in Kyiv. For the tears of our children, the civilians shot dead, the homes turned to rubble.”\nUkraine also expressed gratitude to every soldier, sailor, sergeant, officer, and general who contributed to the fight, reaffirming that “every eliminated occupier is another step toward a just peace.”\n“Today, we’ve taken more than a million such steps,” the General Staff Concluded.\nEarlier, NATO officials on April 3 confirmed that Russia suffered over 250,000 military deaths since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with total losses—killed, wounded, or incapacitated— surpassing 900,000.",

    "title": "U of A Opera's 'Thumbprint' sends message for Tucson women",
    "text": "In perhaps one of the most devastating scenes of the University of Arizona Opera Theatre ‘s performance Wednesday of “Thumbprint,” it is what we didn’t see on stage that struck the deepest emotional blow.\nBut we knew what was happening.\nWe could sense it as the mood shifted in Kamala Sankaram’s wonderful tapestry of Indian raga and Western music performed by a six-member ensemble under the baton of guest conductor Kristin Roach. The rich Indian accents went from playful when Mukhtar Mai (soprano Aysen Milliogullari) and her mom (soprano Beth Jargstorf) teased little sister Annu (alto Betsey Carter) to ominous when the group of tribesmen came seeking retribution. The striking bell-like tones from the tabla stabbed the air like a knife and repeated ragas set to Western harmonies drove the drama until it became near quiet and all we heard was what sounded like a woman gasping for air.\nPeople are also reading… Aldi is opening its first Tucson grocery store Hobbs vetoes bills on school showers, residency for voting, squatters, more New retail development coming to Marana Tim Steller's column: Tucson's biggest homeless camp faces upcoming clear-out More Arizona stores to be sold in latest Kroger, Albertsons merger plan 95-year-old Tucson high-rise building to be sold at auction New policy could eliminate hundreds of Pima County government jobs Group launches campaign to oust 2 Arizona justices over abortion ruling Ranking the craziest foods at this year's Pima County Fair 🍨 50 fun events happening in Tucson this weekend April 25-28 🎠🎨 Councilwoman threatens to picket home of 'notorious South Tucson slumlord' Winning $12 million lottery ticket sold in Marana See what's being cut: U of A releases preliminary budgets for colleges As The Hungry Fox turns 60, the owners plan to open a second location 🍳🥞 This local food truck is bringing a taste of Oaxaca to Tucson We also heard it in Mukhtar’s cries that she wouldn’t follow tradition and lock herself up in her room or, worse, kill herself to redeem the shame the attack left on her family. And we heard it in the denials of her chief attacker Faiz (tenor Jess Barrera), who hid behind the cloak of “honor” and “tradition,” words that flashed on the screens in Sally Day’s dramatic set design.\nThe UA Opera Theatre, under director Cynthia Stokes, could have closed the 2023-24 season with a warhorse from the Western operatic cannon, maybe a frolic with Mozart and or the bold romance of Bernstein’s “West Side Story.”\nBut there’s one thing we’ve learned since Stokes took over the opera program in 2016: She hasn’t met an artistic challenge she’s not willing to tackle.\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\nStokes introduced herself to Tucson in 2017 with Benjamin Britten’s “ The Rape of Lucretia” at a time when the headlines were filled with tales of powerful celebrities being accused of sexually-related crimes at the height of the #MeToo movement.\nBut “Thumbprint” resonates even deeper. Stokes showed us a culture that we have only witnessed from afar, glances on the evening news when tensions in the Middle East rise. But at its core, the message of “Thumbprint” is universal; it’s about empowering women and the disenfranchised. It’s a message that we sorely need today with women’s reproductive rights and health care under attack nationwide and economic and social justice disparities growing.\nIf you go to see “Thumbprint” and you walk away feeling energized to make a change in your world, consider the message delivered.\nBut the other reason you’ll want to see this is to hear the amazing coloratura soprano range from Milliogullari and Jargstorf, who were the dominant voices throughout the 90-minute performance, and to see the brilliant tenor Barrera play such a wretchedly awful character so believably that you had to remind yourself he was just acting.\nOther standout performances included bass Zhixiang “Luke” Xie as Mukhtar’s father and the orchestra under Roach, who brought out the rich cultural intersection of Sankaram’s Hindustani and Western European score.\nUA Opera Theatre will perform “Thumbprint” at 7:30 p.m. Thursday, April 18, and Friday, April 19, and 3 p.m. Saturday, April 20, at Crowder Hall, 1017 N. Olive Road, in the UA School of Music.

Sara Estep, an associate director with the Women's Initiative at the Center for American Progress, said the Congressional Budget Committee's hearing this week on the economic impacts of reproductive rights is \"a huge deal.\"\"It's really important that we talk about this issue as an economic issue,\" Estep said. \"Whenever women are forced to have children that they may not have wanted to have, it has profound economic effects on their lifespan.\"SEE MORE: Families impacted by Alabama IVF ruling head to state capitolThis week, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said, \"Abortion, above all, is a moral and legal issue. Abortion is not an issue that lends itself to being looked at solely through an economic lens. After all, life is priceless.\"For proponents of female reproductive rights, including for removing abortion bans, they see data showing how economic outcomes for mothers are negatively impacted. A 2021 Women's Policy Research Center study found that restrictive abortion bans had a cumulative cost on state and local economies to the tune of around $105 billion. \"When women take time off of work it costs the district money it can also prevent them from going to school,\" said Estep. \"There are a lot of studies from the 1960s and 1970s that show that after Roe, there was an increase of 200% in Black women finishing college as a result of these policies. So, just think about the long and profound impact that finishing college could have on a person's lifespan.\"The Economic Policy Institute found that unionization levels in states with abortion bans were half as high as they were in states that protected abortion rights. It also found that incarceration rates were 50% higher than those in states that protect abortion.\nScripps News Contact reporter Cathalena E. Burch at cburch@tucson.com . On Twitter @Starburch",

    "text": "2024-09-13 03:28:06\nThousands of employees of automotive supplier ZF are rallying across Germany to protest planned job cuts. The board points to the difficult conditions in the industry.\nEmployees of automotive supplier ZF have protested the company’s planned job cuts with a nationwide day of action. Chairman of ZF’s general works council, Achim Dietrich, expects more than 20,000 participants. At the company’s headquarters in Friedrichshafen alone, several thousand employees took to the streets. “Today was a record, I’ve never seen that before,” Dietrich said after a demonstration in the Lake Constance city. The works council chief called for job cuts and investments in German locations to be abandoned.\nAt the end of July, ZF announced that it will cut up to 14,000 jobs in Germany over the next four years. To this end, the foundation company plans to build several network locations with leaner structures.\nAround 54,000 people nationwide currently work at one of the country’s largest automotive suppliers. The extent to which cuts are planned at the 35 locations in Germany will be “clarified in the coming weeks,” the board said at the time. High debt and investment pressure have long been causing problems for the group.\nThe job cuts should not only affect production. Jobs in administration and research and development are also at risk. “We want to fight for every job because there is a livelihood and purchasing power behind it,” stressed Dietrich, who will also be at the table in the upcoming collective bargaining negotiations in the metal and electrical industries. “Of course, we have no guarantee that this will succeed. But after we had thousands of people on the streets today, I am very confident that we can achieve something.”\nThings are not going well on the German car market at the moment. New car sales fell in August compared to the same month last year. This is mainly due to the recent weak demand for purely electric cars, as data from the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) shows. But numbers have also fallen significantly for almost all other types of driving. The industry is particularly concerned about the Volkswagen Group, which is facing plant closures and layoffs.\n“We at ZF cannot isolate ourselves from the challenging conditions in the automotive industry, such as the delayed start of e-mobility and high production costs, especially in Germany,” explained Lea Corzilius, Chief Human Resources Officer and Director of Labor at ZF. We must prepare ZF for the future and further develop the locations in Germany so that they are sustainably competitive and solidly positioned. “The goal is to preserve as many secure and long-term jobs as possible.”\nBut works council director Dietrich sees the mistakes primarily in management. The board is dealing with too many measures at once, he said. They would scapegoat the workforce. “Of course, that doesn’t mean that these employees follow the board and are motivated.” On the contrary: It leads to blockages in production and development. And that nationwide.",

    "title": "Kissago and Preksha Theatre Company's play, Blind Men's Club is a situational comedy about not giving up on hope",
    "text": "A downturned mouth. A vacant stare. Lines in the face. A slack expression. Blind individuals traverse life's hurdles with cleverness, fortitude, and a sprinkle of whimsy. Kissago's upcoming play, Blind Men's Club, inspired by Chandrashekar Phansalkar's acclaimed work Tax-Free, invites the audience on a beautiful voyage into the world of four blind men. Together, they establish their club, a haven devoted to joy and laughter, showcasing their spirited adventures and the unbreakable bonds of goodwill.\nProducers Kajol Dubey and Preksha Trivedi have predicted a set that is a living, breathing character in its own right. \"The design for Blind Men's Club drafts the essence of a club room run by Master Kenjle. This room, which serves as the nucleus of the play, is ingeniously laid out on the main stage area, designed to immerse the audience in the everyday lives and camaraderie of the club members,\" begins Kajol.\nCentral to the set is the club room, a space that exudes warmth and familiarity. Furnished with benches that invite conversations and a radio that serves as a portal to the world beyond, this area is adorned with necessary props that add layers to the narrative. The entry of Mishra, another member of the club introduces a new dynamic to the stage setup. With his arrival, a cot is prominently placed, symbolising his integration into the club's close-knit community.\nMalyaban Lahiri, who plays Master in the performance, tells us that his character is an evil orchestrator of things. \"But he depends on the others for emotional support. Although he is the eldest, he is one of the most mysterious persons in the club and is also the head of the so-called family.\"\nA particularly poignant scene will unfold away from the confines of the club and kitchen, by a lake where Master and Pandharpur engage in the leisurely activity of fishing. While this scene might seem a departure from the club's interior spaces, it offers a serene backdrop for introspection. As they sit by the lake, rods in hand, the tranquillity of the setting prompts a contemplative chat about humour as their chosen mechanism for coping with life.\nVasant Sagar plays the role of a mechanic who lost his sight 10 years ago. \"Even then, he has a penchant for living life to the fullest,\" Vasant shares, adding, \"The play i s about embracing whatever life throws at you and still moving ahead. Despite losing his eyesight, my character is still passionate about his job as a mechanic. He likes to speak about his erstwhile expertise in his work and uplifts others who are too pessimistic even to have hope.\"\nWhile another cast member, Sandeep Bhardwaj says that the play is a situational comedy, director Jay Jha, who agrees with the same, adds, \"Even if the people are blind, they still keep themselves happy and motivated. They play pranks that we show subtly without directly telling the audience as that's where the fun lies. The characters get entertained by these different kinds of situations as they recreate dissimilar emotions. None of them knows what will happen next. We have never tried playing blind persons before. It wasn't easy. We finalised how our eyes, movements and body language will be. We also have a musician joining us who is actually visually impaired. His music comes from the radio that we are using as a prop.\"\nTickets at `200. March 16, 8 pm. At Rangbhoomi By Sneha Arts, Sainikpuri. March 17, 8 pm. At Lamakaan, Banjara Hills.\nchokita@newindianexpress.com @PaulChokita",

    "text": "Reuters Pakistani Christian community attacked after blasphemy accusation Mubasher Bukhari May 25, 2024 at 3:14 p.m. · 2 min read Link Copied Read full article\nBy Mubasher Bukhari\nLAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - At least five members of a minority Christian community were rescued on Saturday after a Muslim crowd attacked their settlement in eastern Pakistan, police and a community leader said.\nThe crowd, which accused the Christian group of blasphemy, hurled stones and bricks at the police, said Shariq Kamal, the police chief of Sargodha district.\nA large contingent of police cordoned off the settlement, he said, adding that the crowd had been pushed back and five injured Christians had been taken to hospital.\nAt least one house and a small shoe factory was set on fire by protesters who had gathered after neighbours alleged that the Muslim holy book, the Koran, had been desecrated by a minority community member, according to a police spokesman and Akmal Bhatti, a Christian leader.\n\"They burned one house and lynched several Christians,\" Bhatti aid.\nVideos posted on social media showed protesters looting items from burning properties. Others were seen throwing the items in a heap on fire in a street.\nBhatti said the videos were images from the scene.\nReuters could not independently verify the pictures.\nThe independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said the Christian community was \"at grave risk to their lives at the hands of the charged mobs\".\nBlasphemy is a sensitive subject in conservative Muslim- majority Pakistan, where just an accusation can lead to a street lynching.\nHuman rights groups say Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores.\nWhile blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan, no one has been executed by the state for it, though numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs.\nA Muslim crowd attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan last year, vandalising several churches and setting scores of houses on fire after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Koran.\n(Writing by Asif Shahzad; Editing by Mike Harrison)",

    "title": "Cette grande enseigne de fast-food ferme des centaines de restaurants dans le monde : la France concernée ?",
    "text": "du fun, des news, des bons plans... what else ? Alors que de nouvelles chaînes de restauration rapide prétendent étendre leur empire sur le sol français ; d'autres en revanche sont en proie à des difficultés qui pourraient les contraindre à fermer plusieurs autres restaurants dans les années à venir. L'une d'entre elles voit son chiffre d'affaires baisser drastiquement ces derniers temps.\nLa France est reconnue dans le monde entier pour sa gastronomie, d'ailleurs le repas des Français est classé comme patrimoine culturel immatériel par l'UNESCO depuis 2010. Pour autant, nos concitoyens ne rechignent pas à consommer dans les enseignes de fast-food , de plus en plus nombreuses chiffres à l'appui. On observe même une accélération du développement de certaines enseignes qui ont décidé de venir s'implanter pour partir à la conquête de parts de marché face aux géants dont Mc Donald's , leader de la 'malbouffe' chez nous avec ses 1 500 restaurants répartis sur l'ensemble du territoire. \"La France est le véritable eldorado des fast-foods\" , disait-on dans la Matinale Bonjour ! (TF1) pas plus tard que l'année dernière, en citant l'enseigne Burger King qui recensait 515 restaurants dans l'Hexagone, contre 222 quatre ans plus tôt.\nLa suite après cette publicité Dans le détail, on apprenait dans le même temps qu'un Français mangeait en moyenne 25 burgers par an , ce qui représente environ 1,7 milliard de sandwichs sur la période . C'est pourquoi on peut affirmer que la France fait partie des plus gros consommateurs et vendeurs de burgers en Europe, fait avéré par une récente étude montrant quels types de plats étaient privilégiés par les utilisateurs des applications de livraison à domicile dont UberEats et Deliveroo, avec bien évidemment en première position les burgers , suivis par les pizzas , les sushis ou encore les kebabs, les Pad-thaïs et les pokés.\nLa suite après cette publicité 28% de ses restaurants fermés en 10 ans Quid des sandwichs traditionnels ? Ils semblent avoir beaucoup moins la cote... Du moins, la chaîne de fast-food Subway est en déclin. À tel point qu'elle se retrouve à devoir fermer plusieurs établissements dans le monde entier . On parle de centaines de restaurants ! C'est ce que rapportent cette semaine nos confrères de Restaurant Business Magazine , en affirmant qu'en tout et pour tout 600 restaurants ont fermé leurs portes durant l'année 2024 , ce qui \"met en péril sa réputation\" . \"À un rythme alarmant, Subway compte désormais le plus faible nombre de restaurants depuis le début des années 2000\" au sein de ses différentes franchises, précise-t-on.\nLa suite après cette publicité Créée en 1965 outre-Atlantique, dans le Connecticut et devenue populaire grâce à son slogan \"Mangez frais !\" , Subway a connu une expansion remarquable dans les années 2000. Si bien qu'en 2010, elle dépassait McDonald's en nombre de franchises dans le monde. Mais voilà que l'empire s'émiette... Les chiffres le prouvent en tout cas : au cours de la dernière décennie, l'enseigne a fermé en tout et pour tout 7 600 de ces restaurants . Ce qui représente 28% de l'ensemble des établissements ouverts à date en 2015 . La raison ? On peut tout d'abord rappeler que diverses controverses liées à son fonctionnement et à la qualité de ses produits, dont le poulet et le thon qu'elle utiliserait pour fabriquer ses sandwichs, ce qui a peut-être pu contribuer à détourner une partie de sa clientèle.\nLa suite après cette publicité Un chiffre d'affaires en baisse Restaurant Business Magazine préfère se cantonner à parler de ses pertes financières sans juger de la nature baisse de son chiffre d'affaires. \"Si Subway a enregistré des ventes moyennes respectables en 2024, ce chiffre ne reflète pas la croissance significative enregistrée à partir de 2023, le restaurant Subway moyen perdant des clients face à la hausse constante des prix\" , affirme-t-on en. Sur Parade.com , on précise que \"malgré ces récentes fermetures\" Subway restait \"de loin la plus grande chaîne de restaurants américaine\" , devant Starbucks , numéro 2. Cependant, des experts financiers avertis affirment qu'à ce rythme, \"Starbucks pourrait même bientôt dépasser Subway comme première chaîne de restaurants au monde d'ici deux à trois ans\" , conclut-on.\nLa suite après cette publicité Et la récente fusillade survenue à Rennes , dans un Subway situé dans le quartier Villejean, ne va pas forcément jouer en faveur de l'enseigne. Pour mémoire, le jeudi 17 avril trois hommes armés avaient ouvert le feu à l'intérieur, faisant plusieurs blessés. Cette attaque avait été très largement médiatisée.\nLa suite après cette publicité",

    "title": "15 Free MacBooks School Tossed Them Out!",
    "text": "Let’s Fіx Them!\nHi guys, ԝelcome Ƅack tⲟ another Hugh Jeffreys video. Τoday, weгe tackling an exciting project: restoring 15 MacBook Airs fгom 2014 taht I received fοr free. These laptops, useɗ іn a private girls’ school, ᴡere destined for the bіn. At first glance, tһey weгe in vɑrious conditions, wіth dents, scratches, stickers, ɑnd missing keys. Ⴝome even had service tags describing tһeyre issues.\n#### The Donation\nThese machines werе donated by Ditmar in South Australia, who had saved about 100 օf theѕe MacBooks fгom the trash. He һad beеn repairing аnd selling them, bᥙt thesе ᴡere the οnes һｅ couldnt fіx օr didnt have time to. Ηe wanted tο ցive me tһе remaining 29 bսt ᴡɑs unwilling to post them. Sο, I reached oᥙt to my mate Nathan, ƅetter known as P Civ Right, ѡho lives in South Australia. I offered Nathan half ⲟf the MacBooks if he posted tһe rest to me. Nathan һad alreaԁy attempted to repair repair һіs ⅼot, and yߋu ϲan check oᥙt hіs video on his channel.\n#### Unboxing\nՕpening tһe box, the fіrst MacBook on tօp prompted mｅ t᧐ look inside. It was missing mɑny internal components ɑnd һad a handwritten note fгom Nathan. Ꭲhe note rеad: “Hey Hugh, I hope the laptops arrive safely and undamaged. Well, some of them are definately already damaged, so good luck. PS: I was going to send over some eucalyptus oil, but it’s flammable, so here’s a crude drawing instead. Keep up the great work.”\n#### Initial Assessment\nI unpacked the rest of the MacBooks tߋ gеt a closer closer ⅼook and do sօme testing before proceeding witһ any repairs. Thｅ fiгst one booted into recovery mode Ьut tһｅn asked foг a six-digit pin. The ѕecond һad a loose base, and the battery wаѕ falling оut, оnly held by one screw. ӀT shⲟwed a blinking question mark ѡhen powｅred ᧐n. The third haɗ a usеr account lock. Ƭhe fourth, labeled ѡith a damaged trackpad, booted tο thе setup screen, ɑnd Ӏ cߋuld gеt іt ԝorking ѕomewhat. THe fiftһ aⅼѕо һad a damaged trackpad, kernel panicked initially, Ƅut eventually booted սp. Thе sixth had no backlight. Thе seventh lacked a Ьottom cover, SSD, аnd һad ɑ blinking question mark. The eighth ѕhowed а disabled Mac screen. Τһe ninth had water damage and a broken enter key, and the tenth had a smashed LCD. THe eleventh lacked ɑn ΟS, аnd thе twelth had a user account lock. ТHе thirteenth lit up bսt showеd nothіng on the display.\n#### begining Repairs\nΙ starteɗ with the first laptop. The battery ԁidnt woгk, and it һad a uѕeｒ account password. Ӏ removed the bottom bottom panel, disconnected the battery, and replaced іt wtih a new ⲟne. I cleaned tһe dust inside, replaced the thermal paste, ɑnd reinstalled macOS, гesulting in a working MacBook.\nΝext, I tackled the second laptop. It needed an SSD and some screws. Ӏ installed the missing components, cleaned іt up, and it ѡas good tⲟ ցο.\nThe third project ѡɑs a water-damaged MacBook. Ӏ cleaned tһe corrosion fгom the logic board wtih alcohol, ɑnd wһile it powered on, it lacked a display output.\nϜor tһe fourth laptop ѡith no backlight, І used tһｅ LCD from the water-damaged MacBook tߋ fix it, resuⅼting in a functional machine.\n#### Tackling Μore Complex Issues\nОne MacBook hɑd a damaged trackpad. Aftеr cleaning tһe crumbs underneath аnd repositioning tһe trackpad, іt wօrked perfectly.\nЅeveral laptops neeⅾеd new SSDs. Apple սѕes proprietary connectors, bսt an adapter all᧐ws standard NVMe drives tо woｒk. Usіng this thіѕ adapter, Ӏ installed neԝ SSDs ɑnd cloned the operating sуstem οnto tһem.\nⲞne strange MacBook sһowed an EFI lock аfter removing tһe SSD. THеre arе tools nad methods tօ remove theѕe locks, but its а tricky areа.\nThree MacBooks booted tօo a pin lock screen. Ӏ couldnt get macOS installed, ѕo I installed Linux іnstead. Tһis pгovided a functional system, although not macOS.\n#### Final Steps\nThе last MacBook wаs liquid contaminated. It booted bᥙt shоwed a blinking question mark. After installing a neѡ SSD аnd аn external drive, I confirmed it ᴡorked but wasnt detecting thе internal SSD.\nBefore revealing thе final ｒesults, I ɡave all the MacBooks а thоrough cleaning. Ι removed stickers and residue ѡith hot air and adhesive remover nad cleaned tһe grotty keyboards.\n#### Thе Results\nOut of the 15 MacBooks, 11 arе now functional ᴡith operating systems installed nad ᴡorking batteries. Wһile cosmetically imperfect, tһe point ѡas to save them frօm landfill. Hеre’s the rundown: two were water-damaged, tԝо neeⅾed further repair, repair, еight wеrе fully functional, iphone x glass replacement cost and threｅ werе running Linux.\nShout out to Ditmar foг this incredible donation.
