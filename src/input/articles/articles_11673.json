    "title": "Free Speech Now Second-Most Important Issue For Voters - Bad News For Kamala | OutKick",
    "text": "Free speech is the most fundamental right of every American. That is why free speech is enshrined as the first of the original 10 constitutional amendments. And for the first time in our lives, that right is in actual jeopardy. Americans agree. A new poll from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression found that free speech is now the second-most important issue for Americans in the upcoming election, trailing only \\\"inflation and increasing costs.\\\" Americans, 63 percent of whom say concerns over free speech are \\\"very important\\\" to them, ranked the issue ahead of health care, immigration, crime, and guns. And, yes, even more than \\\"racial inequality.\\\" On Thursday, Elon Musk called the finding a \\\"major vibe shift!\\\" If free speech is actually on the minds of voters come Nov. 5, Kamala Harris will not win the election. It's that simple. For all the ills of the Republican Party, and there are many, the evidence is clear: the Democratic Party is the party of censorship. More specifically, government-pressured censorship. Every recent example of government-pressured censorship traces back to the Democratic Party. Let us run through some of the more egregious cases: Last month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted that the White House urged Facebook to remove posts about Covid that reflected poorly on the Biden-Harris administration. In 2022, Zuckerberg confessed to Joe Rogan that Meta suppressed the accurately reported Hunter Biden laptop story in response to false FBI warnings of incoming \\\"Russian disinformation.\\\" But it's not just Meta. When Elon Musk purchased Twitter (known as X) in 2022, he provided reporters with internal communications that proved the extent to which former executives engaged in politically motivated censorship on behalf of, again, the Biden-Harris administration. The revelations – known as #TwitterFiles --included examples of shadow-banning, de-amplification, removing posts, and banning accounts. Last November, the House Judiciary Committee filed a 103-page staff interim report detailing how government agencies pressured tech companies to dictate the information posted on social media prior to the 2020 presidential election. The finding discovered \\\"hundreds\\\" of reports showing how the Department of Homeland Security, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Department of State, and Stanford University assisted in the creation of a secret \\\"disinformation\\\" group that asked social media companies to \\\"censor true information, jokes, and political opinions.\\\" Platforms like Facebook and Twitter acquiesced. To no surprise, the pressure campaign disproportionately resulted in the de-platforming of information disfavorable to, wait for it, Democrats. The significance of what's happening here cannot be understated. The First Amendment prohibits the government from censoring ordinary Americans. However, the government has found a workaround to the constitutional restriction by pressuring private tech companies to do censoring for them. Tricky, tricky. But also illegal. By assisting in the government's subversion of the First Amendment, Facebook is acting not as a \\\"private company\\\" but as a \\\"state actor.\\\" And as the Wall Street Journal explains, \\\"state actors\\\" can be sued for aiding and abetting in violations of the Constitution. And the Democrat Party is complicit. As per our column, free speech is on the ballot in 2024. Voting for Harris-Walz sends a direct message that Americans are fine with censorship. No American should ever be fine with censorship. Free speech is what allows us access to the truth. Without the truth, we are nothing more than ignorant NPCs (people who don't think for themselves) who march to the beat of our dear leaders. Imagine if the only facts available were the \\\"facts\\\" that the people in charge made available. That was the case for much of the pandemic, when various credible voices were silenced for offering dissenting opinions. Thereby, there's a valid argument that free speech should be the most important issue for voters. While the economy is crucial to our daily lives, free speech is what separates a free country from an autocracy. On Nov. 5, you get to make a decision on censorship.",

E' quanto affermano Abi, Ania, Assirevi, Assonime Confindustria e il Consiglio nazionale dei dottori commercialisti e degli esperti contabili hanno inviato una lettera congiunta al Mef dove si chiede \"che l'impianto sanzionatorio, delineato nello schema di decreto di recepimento\" della direttiva europea \" messo in consultazione dal Mef debba essere adeguatamente riproporzionato, differenziandolo rispetto a quello oggi applicabile per la rendicontazione di bilancio, anche in linea con quanto stanno definendo gli altri principali paesi europei\". Nella missiva si esprime \"forte preoccupazione per l'estensione alle informazioni di sostenibilità del sistema sanzionatorio, di natura prevalentemente penale, applicabile oggi alle informazioni contabili, in quanto tale scelta potrebbe penalizzare la competitività del sistema italiano e incentivare il già preoccupante fenomeno del trasferimento della sede sociale in paesi europei caratterizzati da sistemi di vigilanza e di enforcement meno afflittivi\". L'impianto sanzionatorio, delineato nello schema di decreto di recepimento messo in consultazione dal Mef, deve, a loro parere, essere adeguatamente riproporzionato, differenziandolo rispetto a quello oggi applicabile per la rendicontazione di bilancio, anche in linea con quanto stanno definendo gli altri principali paesi europei.

    "title": "Putin Elevates the War to a Global Scale - 23.08.2024 | BURSA.RO",
    "text": "Putin is escalating the war to a global scale by successively adopting, over the past year, new legal norms (read [here](https://www.bursa.ro/effects-of-the-legislative-package-on-simplifying-procedures-for-obtaining-citizenship-and-residency-in-the-russian-federation-2023-2024-86343354)) that assign two additional functions to Russian military intervention: A. To add the goal of combating Western ideologies to armed aggression, aiming to align the entire anti-globalist movement worldwide and recruit supporters regardless of nationality; B. To allow the incorporation of any part of a country (or any conquered country) into the Russian Federation, regardless of its location on the planet. On October 5, 2023, at the Valdai Forum in Sochi, Vladimir Putin stated: \"The crisis in Ukraine is not a territorial conflict,\" but rather \"about the principles that underpin the new international order.\" This declaration signals the intention for Russia to shift from plundering a neighboring country to initiating a global revolution. • The Definition of \"Russian Citizen\": An Anti-Globalist Citizen The decree from few days ago (August 19, 2024) granting the right of residence in Russia to foreign citizens who oppose Western ideologies reflects an expansion of the concept of \"Russian\" beyond strict ethnic or national criteria, including individuals who align with the political and ideological values promoted by Russia. Russia is no longer just the name of a country but of an ideology. The definition of \"Russian\" is no longer merely ethnic or national but has become political in nature. Russian, in this sense, means anti-globalist. The decree does not explicitly state that Russian policy is anti-globalist, but it uses terms such as \"destructive neoliberal ideology\" and \"traditional Russian spiritual and moral values\" to describe the framework within which it offers residence rights to foreign citizens who oppose the ideologies in their home countries. The language reflects Russia's official stance against certain aspects of globalization, particularly those associated with Western neoliberalism. However, a logical question arises: if there is an identity between the notions of \"anti-globalism\" and \"Russian,\" should globalist Russians lose their citizenship? The question serves only to highlight that Russian legislation has simplified the issue to the point of incoherence. • Anti-Globalism: 30-40% of Global Political Movements Anti-globalism represents a broad political movement that opposes certain aspects of globalization, particularly those related to neoliberal economics, the influence of transnational corporations, and the dominance exerted by global institutions. Despite significant regional and ideological variations, anti-globalist movements, taken as a whole, have gained considerable weight, accounting for approximately 30-40% of the world's political movements. • 1. Radical Left Movements: • 2. Nationalist and Sovereigntist Movements: • 3. Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Colonial Movements: • 4. Populist Movements: • 5. Conservative Religious Movements: • Differences Between Revolution, Robbery, and Terrorism Although these movements share a common critique of globalization, their motives and objectives can vary significantly, ranging from the radical left to nationalist right, raising doubts about their ability to coordinate unified actions. Some focus on environmental protection and social rights, others on national sovereignty and protectionism, and still others on resisting Western cultural and political influence. Moscow presents itself as the leader of anti-globalism and attempts to expand its base among those dissatisfied with the current world order. However, compared to this image, the reality reveals two major differences: a) Russia is primarily interested in regaining its status as a global leader, which it lost when the socialist bloc disintegrated, the Soviet Union dissolved, and it proved inept in the global economic competition; b) The discontented masses around the world who claim anti-globalist intentions are often impoverished populations for whom political subtleties are mere trivialities. As soon as a conflict escalates, they become interested in simple anarchy, without which robbery would be punished. The chances that a deceitful leader could turn robbery into a revolution are theoretically slim. However, recruiting followers in enemy countries has the potential to create a network of individuals loyal to Russia, who could be used in various ways in international conflicts. Nothing prevents their organization into terrorist cells during their training in Russia while staying there to obtain Russian citizenship (the decree does not state that they must live there long-term). • Russia's Borders Have No Limits Members of ethnic or national groups from other states who receive Russian citizenship may be considered \"Russians\" by Moscow, which could lead to political and territorial complications. For example, in the Donbas regions (Donetsk and Luhansk) in eastern Ukraine, Russia supported pro-Russian separatist groups that declared independent republics in 2014. Russia began offering Russian citizenship to residents of these regions starting in 2019, through a rapid and simplified process. In 2022, Russia officially used the presence of Russian citizens and ethnic Russians in Donbas as a pretext for launching the \"special military operation\" against Ukraine, which the Kremlin claimed was conducted to protect the Russian-speaking population from \"genocide.\" This is a model of action. Under recent Russian legislation, it is possible for members of ethnic or national groups from other states to be considered \"Russians\" if they meet certain criteria related to cultural, linguistic, or ideological identity. This is part of a broader strategy to expand Russian influence and consolidate a national identity that transcends traditional borders, national origin, and even the Russian language (which is not considered a necessary but merely sufficient condition). And since the legislation granting Russian citizenship is not limited to neighboring territories, it follows that the tactic Russia used to annex Donbas can be applied anywhere in the world. During a televised award ceremony for geography students in 2016, Vladimir Putin asked a nine-year-old boy where Russia's borders end, to which the boy replied, \"at the Bering Strait.\" Putin responded, \"Russia's border ends nowhere.\" Then he said he was joking. Well, he was lying. He wasn't joking.",
