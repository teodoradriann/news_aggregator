    "text": "‘I just want to cry’: Woman fights over $200K in medical bills after someone stole her identity PHOENIX ( [KPHO](https://www.azfamily.com/2024/06/13/phoenix-woman-fights-outrageous-medical-bills-racked-up-by-id-thief/)/Gray News) - A Phoenix woman says someone has stolen her identity and has charged thousands of dollars’ worth of medical care in her name. “The bills are outrageous. I get a new bill every day, and I just want to cry,” Jennifer O’Connor said. “For just the surgery, it was $217,000.” O’Connor thumbed through a stack of papers, including other bills for $32,000 and $9,300. She says she has lost track of the total. “I’m getting bills from CT scans, bills from anesthesiologists, different doctors that she saw at the hospital. It’s just overwhelming,” O’Connor said. “She used my insurance at Banner because I have Banner insurance. At HonorHealth, she did not use insurance, so she just gave them my information and said, ‘I don’t have insurance.’” O’Connor said the first sign of a problem was when she received a bill from an anesthesiologist. “Twenty-four hundred dollars for anesthesia, and I’m like, anesthesia? When did I go under anesthesia?” she said. “I looked more into it, and all I had to do to get into it was put in my date of birth, and bam. There’s the bill.” The real O’Connor is a respiratory therapist at a Banner facility. Her supervisor submitted a letter to their employer to prove the real Jennifer O’Connor was on the clock when the imposter O’Connor was getting medical care. “I just know I was working my butt off and I wasn’t getting screws in my legs and on fentanyl, that’s for sure,” she said. “It wasn’t me. None of this was me.” Still, the paper trail and the police reports that O’Connor filed with area authorities have not been enough to unravel the mess. “I get two emails from Banner saying they’re going to garnish my wages for a visit at Banner Boswell ER for $150, and a $36 bill from Banner Desert,” O’Connor said. “They just sent it to collections.” If it sounds like a nightmare, it is. But O’Connor is not alone. “It is getting easier and easier to obtain the data of a legitimate person and then create the fake identity,” Eva Velasquez, the president and CEO of the non-profit Identity Theft Resource Center, said. “When it comes to medical identity theft, it does get tricky because we don’t have a central repository for all of our medical records, so I encourage people to focus their energy on just protecting their identity, on the whole.” According to the FBI’s Internet Crimes Complaint Center, reports for identity theft are declining, year-over-year, in both the number of complaints and the amount of money lost. Still, it remains critical to take preventative steps to protect your identity. Agents suggest unique passwords for all accounts, as well as multi-factor authentication. The FBI says it is also important to protect physical documents with personal information. That includes securing your mailbox. If you become a victim of medical identity theft, keep meticulous records. “The unfortunate reality is that you must resolve this directly with the entity where the fraud occurred,” Velasquez said. “Call back as often as you feel comfortable doing, asking, ‘What is the status of this? What do you need from me to prove that I am me and did not receive this care, these goods, or this prescription?’ And then, unfortunately, the onus is often on you, the victim, to supply that information, to do your own investigation and build that case.” While medical identity theft can be costly, it has serious health concerns. “You potentially now have mixed medical records with the thief, and you could get improper care and an improper diagnosis,” Velasquez said. “You could also not have the ability to get necessary prescriptions filled or to get access to necessary medical equipment because the thief has already gotten those things in your name.” That’s what the real Jennifer O’Connor fears the most. “All her medical stuff is on file. Not mine,” she said. “If I was in a car accident on the way home, God forbid, and I was out of it and needed blood products, I could die because she probably doesn’t have the same blood type as me, and that terrifies me.” Representatives with HonorHealth and Banner have not immediately responded to questions regarding O’Connor’s case or the companies’ medical identity theft policies. The Mesa Police Department said it has not identified any suspects, and the case is currently inactive. Phoenix police and the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office say investigations remain open regarding O’Connor’s situation with evidence still being collected.

    "text": "The Canadian Press Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren Read full article The Canadian Press December 29, 2023 at 11:00 a.m. · 3 min read VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open.\nFewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions.\nWarmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan.\nIn Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas.\nOn Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain.\nWarm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each.\nMount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow.\nJames Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season.\n\"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said.\n\"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\"\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\nStory continues \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\"\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n\"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\"\nHe said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n\"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.\nChuck Chiang, The Canadian Press\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "MOSES LAKE — The Moses Lake City Council on Tuesday evening unanimously approved the publication of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for mobile outreach and supportive services aimed at helping homeless individuals access critical resources following the recent closure of the Open Doors Sleep Center.\nHousing Grants Manager Liz Murillo Busby introduced the initiative, highlighting the goal of contracting a qualified organization to provide 24/7 mobile outreach and transportation to shelters, rehabilitation programs, family support systems, and other recovery services.\n“This proposal is in alignment with the Post Sleep Center closure transition plan,” Busby told the council. She emphasized the importance of verifying services at receiving facilities, noting, “We want to make sure that the subgrantee that gets contracted verifies services... and is not just dropping off individuals without verifying those services.”\nThe RFP includes a collaborative partnership with the Moses Lake Police Department and code enforcement to ensure timely referrals with a target response time of 30 to 45 minutes.\nCouncil Member David Skaug asked about the cost structure, to which Busby replied, “Within 30 days of awarding this contract, the subgrantee will come with us with an outline plan proposal on how that structure will work.” The contract is anticipated to be about $55,000.\nCouncil discussed whether multiple providers could be selected or if the contract would go to a single provider. Busby responded that the council could direct funding to more than one agency based on proposals received. “We can provide direct or give direction from council then,” she said.\nThe council plans to review scored applications in early September with recommendations from an ad hoc homeless committee.\nCouncil Member Deanna Martinez voiced support for allowing the proposals to guide next steps, saying, “I’m for one comfortable with that to sort of let the applications guide what our next steps would be.”\nWith the RFP authorized for publication, the city moves forward with efforts to enhance outreach services to vulnerable populations in need of immediate transportation and support services.",

    "text": "Plumbers, fitters, welders and apprentices who are members of the Unite trade union are again picketing a number of construction sites around the country. It is part of a campaign seeking the restoration of cuts to the first hour of travel time implemented during the period after the financial crash in 2008. It is the second Friday running that the workers have engaged in strike action over the issue. The locations being picketed are construction projects by pharma company Pfizer in Grange Castle in Dublin and Ringaskiddy in Cork. The pickets are not aimed at Pfizer, but at members of the Mechanical Engineering & Building Services Contractors' Association (MEBSCA) who are carrying out works at the locations at present. MEBSCA has previously said that the first hour of travel time has been incorporated into hourly rates since 2011 as part of an agreement reached with Unite. It said the agreement had the effect of increasing the hourly rate which also resulted in a higher rate being paid for overtime and holidays. The association has claimed that Unite is now seeking to maintain the higher rate of pay while also seeking to reverse the agreement that was freely entered into by Unite at that time. MEBSCA has called for the union to engage in talks, a claim described as disingenuous by Unite because it says the organisation has refused to engage and make a meaningful offer. The pickets began at midnight and will run for almost 24 hours. Last week, construction projects for major companies including Intel, Diageo, Eli Lilly, Analog and the ESB were hit by a 24-hour work stoppage.",

    "text": "¿Crisis en La Bella Luz? Seis cantantes renuncian en menos de un año, algunos por su salud mental\nEl grupo musical La Bella Luz enfrenta una serie de salidas de sus integrantes, desde marzo de 2024 hasta febrero de este 2025. La situación ha generado preocupación entre los fanáticos, debido a que varios artistas explicaron que decidieron irse para priorizar su bienestar emocional.\nEl 23 de febrero de 2024, el empresario Óscar Custodio presentó con gran entusiasmo a su nueva delantera de La Bella Luz, tras la inminente salida de Milagros Díaz. En aquel entonces, celebró la incorporación de las voces de Naldy Saldaña, Alejandra Guerrero, Deyvis Paredes, Hanna Delgado, Kevin Céspedes y Eduardo Ortúzar. Incluso, Briela Cirilo iba a ser la séptima integrante, pero terminó volviendo a Corazón Serrano por una mejor oferta económica.\nSemanas más tarde, el grupo se fortaleció con la llegada de Claudia Salazar, Alexandra Seijas y Mathías Zevallos, quienes resultaron ganadores del casting que se realizó en el programa ‘Mande quien mande’, cuya final fue el 19 de marzo de 2024. Sin embargo, hasta la fecha ninguno de ellos permanece en la orquesta. De hecho, algunos afirmaron que tomaron la decisión de irse para preservar su paz mental.\nMathias Zevallos, Ale Seijas y Claudia Salazar, ganadores del casting en 'MQM', se fueron de La Bella Luz.

Solo agradecieron a la joven por haberlos apoyado en tan corto tiempo. “Ella tiene que continuar con sus actividades personales, le deseamos muchos éxitos”, expresaron en sus redes oficiales.\nDías después, la cantante chiclayana explicó en un live por TikTok que su salida fue por mutuo acuerdo entre la orquesta y su parte. Asimismo, lamentó que no haya podido despedirse de sus compañeros y se mostró agradecida por la oportunidad.\nPUEDES VER:\n[Fue eliminado por Christian Yaipén en ‘La voz Kids’, pero ahora brilla con La Bella Luz: conoce la historia de Stiven Franco]\nKevin Cespedes le dijo adiós a La Bella Luz\nEl segundo cantante de La Bella Luz en irse en el 2024 fue Kevin Cespedes, quien hizo pública su salida a través de un comunicado de prensa. Según dijo, fue por motivos personales. “Espero poder seguir contando con su apoyo en futuros proyectos musicales. A todos mis compañeros musicales, les deseo muchas bendiciones y éxitos en todo”, concluyó.\nAunque ni la orquesta ni el cantante revelaron el verdadero motivo de su salida de La Bella Luz, algunos expertos en cumbia aseguraron que el intérprete estaba incómodo porque no le daban temas a grabar, tal y como sí pasó con los ganadores del casting.\nAle Seijas dejó La Bella Luz por “motivos forzados”\nEl 7 de agosto de 2024, la cantante Alexandra Seijas sorprendió a sus miles de fanáticos al compartir un comunicado sobre su salida de la orquesta. “Anuncio que dejo de pertenecer a La Bella Luz, dejando en claro mi renuncia, por motivos forzados. Muchas gracias a todo el público que siempre me ha apoyado en todo momento. Y espero seguir contando con el apoyo de todos ustedes”, indicó.\nComunicado de Ale Seijas.\nEl comunicado de Ale Seijas disparó las alarmas de que algo estaba sucediendo en la agrupación, pero nadie aclaró nada. Después de su renuncia, la joven intentó hacer una carrera como solista. Incluso, expresó sus deseos de formar parte de Corazón Serrano, pero Edwin Guerrero dijo que no contratará a nadie que haya estado en La Bella Luz para evitar problemas con la competencia. Finalmente, la joven fue fichada por Son del Duke, tras la salida de Cielo Fernández, la última contratación de Corazón Serrano.\nClaudia Salazar se fue de La Bella Luz por su paz mental\nClaudia Salazar, reconocida por su dedicación y entusiasmo en La Bella Luz, anunció su salida de La Bella Luz el 1 de enero de este 2025, a través de un comunicado, donde explicó que esta decisión responde a la necesidad de priorizar su tranquilidad. “He decidido dejar este proyecto musical, una decisión difícil, pero necesaria para priorizar mi bienestar y paz mental”, indicó en su mensaje compartido en Instagram.\nAdemás, la cantante expresó su agradecimiento a sus seguidores, quienes han sido un pilar fundamental en su carrera, brindándole inspiración constante a través de sus mensajes y aplausos. “Agradezco profundamente a todos mis fans por su apoyo, que ha sido una fuente infinita de inspiración. A pesar de que cierro este capítulo, espero seguir contando con su compañía en los nuevos caminos musicales que me esperan”, concluyó Salazar, quien en la actualidad se desempeña como cantante de Papillón.\nMathias Zevallos, la joven promesa de la cumbia, se fue de La Bella Luz\nCuando todo parecía que se había calmado en la interna de La Bella Luz, incluso se habían reforzado con el ingreso de Stiven Franco, el cantante Mathias Zevallos sorprendió a más de uno al anunciar su retiro de La Bella Luz, a pesar de que se había convertido en una de las principales voces de la orquesta.\n“Quiero hacer público mi retiro de la orquesta La Bella Luz. Agradezco al Sr. Oscar Custodio por la oportunidad brindada, ya que formar parte de la agrupación ha sido una experiencia que ha contribuido significativamente a mi crecimiento artístico. Asimismo, quiero expresar mi más profundo cariño a mis fans que han seguido mi trayectoria y han apoyado mi carrera musical”, expresó en sus redes.\nEduardo Ortúzar fue el último en irse de La Bella Luz\nUn día después del comunicado de Mathías Zevallos, el cantante Eduardo Ortúzar también anunció su renuncia a La Bella Luz. El intérprete de cumbia indicó que fue su decisión salir de la delantera del grupo, con el fin de “priorizar mi estabilidad emocional”. Asimismo, agradeció al señor Oscar Custodio por la oportunidad y sostuvo que está abierto a nuevas oportunidades de trabajo.\nEduardo Ortúzar se fue de La Bella Luz para priorizar su estabilidad emocional.
