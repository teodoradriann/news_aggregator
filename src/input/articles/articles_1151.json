    "text": "News industry off to brutal 2024 start as mass layoffs devastate publishers, raising questions about the future of journalism\nBy Oliver Darcy and Jon Passantino, CNN\n(CNN) — The news industry is enduring a brutal start to the new year, with outlets large and small across the country hemorrhaging reporting staff as legacy business models that kept much of the industry afloat for decades collapse in plain sight.\nThe rapid contraction, coming even as the presidential election cycle heats up and public attention and revenues historically mount, has been on full display this month, with the first few weeks of 2024 ushering in a spate of painful layoffs at news organizations from coast-to-coast.\nThe Los Angeles Times slashed its newsroom by more than 20% earlier this week; TIME cut dozens of staffers; and Business Insider said it would trim its workforce by 8%. Meanwhile, hundreds of staffers at Condé Nast, Forbes, The New York Daily News, and others staged historic walkouts to protest planned cuts at the outlets.\nThe recent round of layoffs, while pronounced, are part of a much larger and unrelenting storm battering the journalism industry. Over the past 18 months, most news organizations have been forced to make difficult decisions to reduce their workforces.\nAt the national level, CNN, The Washington Post, NPR, Vice Media, Sports Illustrated, Vox Media, NBC News, CNBC, and other organizations have cut swaths of their reporting staff. At the local level, layoffs have been nearly constant, with newspaper giant Gannett cutting hundreds of employees, and small outlets carving out already lean operations.\nThe latest round of layoffs come after 2023 marked the worst year for job cuts in the journalism sector since Covid-19 upended the world in 2020, with roughly 2,700 jobs eliminated.\nWhile each outlet is struggling with its own unique challenges, they all are facing brutal industry headwinds ushered in by the internet revolution and other technological advances that have fundamentally changed the way the public consumes news and entertainment.\nAudiences that once reliably surfed traditional cable channels and consumed news websites or newspapers are instead absorbing content and spending time on platforms such as TikTok and Netflix, leading to massive declines in ratings and traffic. That shift in behavior has led brands to spend their marketing in emerging digital arenas, particularly given their ability to offer advertisers powerful tools to target audiences with precision.\nMaking matters worse, news outlets have seen their online advertising businesses vanish as social media and search giants devour much of the industry’s dollars. Research produced by Columbia University in October estimated that technology titans Google and Meta should pay news outlets $14 billion per year in revenue for their search traffic and content, a figure it\ndescribed as “conservative.” But technology companies have resisted paying publishers for their content and launched high-profile fights to block legislation intended to recoup some of the lost revenue.\n“The ad industry doesn’t need the news industry when there are so many other ways to purchase attention, and so many better ways to target users,” Jay Rosen, an associate professor of journalism at New York University, told CNN.\nThe change in behavior has also meant news consumers are canceling subscriptions to newspapers and cable providers, cutting precious revenues even further.\n“I am sorry to say that I do not see turning around most legacy outlets,” Jeff Jarvis, the Leonard Tow Professor of Journalism Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, told CNN. “Their proprietors, with few exceptions, did not adapt to the internet. They held onto their old business models — advertising, subscription, and the attention economy.”\n“Many of them are now controlled by hedge funds, which will not invest or innovate,” Jarvis said, adding that cost-cutting is the “predictable response to a worsening downward business spiral,” which “will make the products of these publications only worse, which will accelerate the spiral.”\n“The death of newspapers — and magazines and linear TV — has been oft-foretold and has not yet occurred,” Jarvis said. “The fall might be coming now.”\nThe hollowing out of large news institutions comes at a perilous time for America. Antidemocratic candidates have intentionally worked to undermine faith in news outlets as they look to seize power in election contests from coast to coast, attacking those tasked with the duty of holding public officials accountable.\n“To say that trust in the news media has declined is correct, but too vague,” Rosen said. “The reality is that destroying confidence in the practice and products of journalism is a potent and successful political strategy, as with Steve Bannon’s ‘flood the zone.’”\nThat lack of accountability means dishonest figures seeking higher office, and those in positions of power, could avoid crucial scrutiny, leaving the electorate less informed about the vital decisions it will have to make in November at the ballot box.\nMargaret Sullivan, a columnist at The Guardian who previously wrote about media for The Washington Post and The New York Times, told CNN in December that she is worried about the larger consequences the deeper cuts in the news business will have on the country. Sullivan said that it is not only “heartbreaking to see the loss of these jobs,” but warned the action will do “damage to society.”\n“The loss of journalists contributes to the exponential growth of news deserts in large swaths of the nation — and that’s disastrous when misinformation is rampant,” Sullivan said. “Democracy needs an informed electorate in order to function and that is tragically dwindling in many regions.”\nFor a time, there had been hope that billionaire ownership of news publications could offer stability to the industry as it wears off legacy business models. Recent months, however, have cast doubt on that optimism, with Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post and Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong’s Los Angeles Times making significant cuts to their newsrooms.\nBut despite the widespread gloom, there are some encouraging signs popping up across the industry. Dan Kennedy, a journalism professor at Northeastern University, noted some local news outlets have found financial sustainability.\n“Billionaire newspaper ownership is coming under fire lately because of Soon-Shiong’s fecklessness and because Jeff Bezos has hit a few bumps with the Post, although I think that will prove to be temporary,” Kennedy told CNN, pointing to recent successes at The Minneapolis Star Tribune and The Boston Globe newspapers.\n“There are reasons to be optimistic given the hundreds of independent local news organizations that have sprouted up in recent years,” he said. “The challenge is that coverage at the hyperlocal level is hit or miss, as some communities are well-served and others — especially in rural areas and in urban communities of color — tend to be overlooked.”\nBut Rosen cautioned against the reliance on deep-pocketed philanthropists to sustain journalistic enterprises in the long-term.\n“Journalists have to take it upon themselves to treat sustainability as their problem, but this is not what they signed up for,” he said. “They signed up to do stories.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "Trump's visa delays in US drive 50% surge in UAE university applications",
    "text": "Institutions from Abu Dhabi and Dubai to Ajman seeing significant rise in applications\nDubai: Amid growing uncertainty over\nstudent visa processing in the United States, universities in the UAE are reporting a significant increase in international applications and interest.\nThe\nadministration of Donald Trump recently issued a proclamation banning international students from attending institutions like Harvard University. Although a federal judge has temporarily blocked the order, the situation has created deep uncertainty among students and parents alike.\nWith visa interviews for international students in the US currently halted, the resulting disruption has sent ripples across global education. UAE institutions are rapidly emerging as attractive alternatives for\nstudents seeking academic stability and global mobility.\nProfessor Dame Heather McGregor, Provost and Vice Principal at Heriot-Watt University Dubai, said that amid growing global restrictions on international student visas, Dubai is becoming an increasingly “attractive study destination.”\n“Our campus recorded a 4.5 per cent year-on-year increase in enrolments for 2024/25, and applications for September 2025 are already 53.5 per cent higher than in the same period last year, driven significantly by the growth in student numbers from international markets,” she said.\nProfessor McGregor highlighted the UAE’s strengths: exceptional infrastructure, a streamlined visa process, and progressive policies such as part-time work opportunities for students.\n“Cities like\nDubai and Abu Dhabi rank among the world’s safest, offering families peace of mind alongside academic excellence, and their geographic location and excellent transportation links mean that students are often nearer to their families than they would be in the US or even the UK.”\nAjman’s Gulf Medical University (GMU) is witnessing a “remarkable increase” in applications, both in volume and diversity, according to Professor Manda Venkatramana, the Acting Chancellor.\n“We’ve observed a significant spike in enquiries and interest from both students and parents across several countries – particularly those who had initially planned to pursue higher education in the US,” he said, highlighting that compared to the same period in previous academic cycles, GMU has recorded a “significant year-on-year growth” in student applications from Asia, Africa, and the Mena region.\nProfessor Venkatramana noted that ongoing US visa delays and policy uncertainty are prompting families to explore alternative destinations.\n“In this context, GMU and the UAE as a whole are emerging as strong contenders, offering world-class education, advanced infrastructure, and global mobility – all without the uncertainty that currently surrounds US institutions,” he said, noting that students and parents are beginning to view the UAE, and GMU in particular, not just as a backup plan but as a primary choice for high-quality, future-focused education.\nAt Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi (SUAD), international student interest has “nearly doubled” compared to the same time last year.\n“This growing interest reflects our reputation as a leading French-Emirati university offering world-class education in the heart of the Middle East. The recent visa disruptions in the US may be contributing to this shift, as more students look toward stable, globally connected alternatives,” said Camille Assouline, Head of Communications, Marketing and Public Affairs Division.\nShe noted the UAE’s long-standing appeal as a hub for world-class education, talent, and innovation.\n“We’re still accepting applications for the upcoming academic year, and thanks to our streamlined admissions and visa process, international students can still make the shift smoothly – even at this stage,” Assouline said.\nSign up for the Daily Briefing\nGet the latest news and updates straight to your inbox",

    "text": "MIAMI - Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro ordered Venezuela's armed forces to conduct defensive exercises in the Eastern Caribbean after the United Kingdom sent a warship toward Guyana's territorial waters as the South American neighbors dispute a large border region.\nIn a nationally televised address on Thursday, Maduro said that 6,000 Venezuelan troops, including air and naval forces, will conduct joint operations off the nation's eastern coast -- near the border with Guyana.\nMaduro described the impending arrival of British ship HMS Trent to Guyana's shores as a \"threat\" to his country. He argued the ship's deployment violates a recent agreement between the South American nations.\n\"We believe in diplomacy, in dialogue and in peace, but no one is going to threaten Venezuela,\" Maduro said in a room where he was accompanied by a dozen military commanders. \"This is an unacceptable threat to any sovereign country in Latin America.\"\nVenezuela and Guyana are currently involved in a border dispute over the Essequibo, a sparsely populated region the size of Florida with vast oil deposits off its shores.\nThe region has been under Guyana's control for decades, but in December, Venezuela relaunched its historical claim to the Essequibo through a referendum in which it asked voters in the country whether the Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state.\nAs tensions over the region escalated, the leaders of both countries met in the Caribbean island of St Vincent, and signed an agreement which said they would solve their dispute through nonviolent means.\nDuring the talks, however, Guyana's President Irfan Ali said his nation reserved its right to work with its partners to ensure the defense of his country.\nOn Thursday, Guyanese officials described the visit of HMS Trent as a planned activity aimed at improving the nation's defense capabilities and said the ship's visit will continue as scheduled.\n\"Nothing that we do or have done is threatening Venezuela,\" Guyana's Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo told reporters in Georgetown, the nation's capital.\nHMS Trent is a patrol and rescue ship that was recently used to intercept drug traffickers off the West Coast of Africa. It can accommodate up to 30 sailors and a contingent of 18 marines, and is equipped with 30mm cannons and a landing pad for helicopters and drones.\nThe ship had been sent to Barbados in early December to intercept drug traffickers, but its mission was changed on Dec. 24, when it was sent to Guyana. Authorities did not specify when it was expected to arrive off Guyana's shores.\nThe United Kingdom's Defense Ministry said the ship would be conducting joint operations with Guyana's defense forces.\nThe nation of 800,000 people has a small military that is made up of 3,000 soldiers, 200 sailors and four small patrol boats known as Barracudas.",

    "title": "McLeod had to wait to celebrate first NHL hat-trick - NewsBreak",
    "text": "By Paul Hamilton ,\n3 hours ago\nBuffalo, N.Y. (WGR Sports Radio 550) - The Buffalo Sabres' fourth goal on Wednesday kept getting changed between Tage Thompson and Ryan McLeod. It was embarrassing that the NHL couldn’t figure it out and kept changing it, but that’s how they roll.\nIt was the next day when I could actually sit down and talk to McLeod about getting his first NHL hat-trick, because he finally got credit for the goal. McLeod was, of course, ecstatic for the moment.\n\"It’s a special moment, it’s pretty cool,\" said McLeod on Thursday after practice. \"It’s cool we got the win, and it’s a moment I’ll remember for a long time.\"\nLast year, McLeod scored 12 goals with the Edmonton Oilers in 81 games, which was a career-high. This year, he already has 10, and is on pace to score 19 by season's end.\nMcLeod didn’t have a point in his first three games with the Sabres, but he then went on a five-game points streak, where he had four goals and five points. In 15 games, he had six goals and six assists for 12 points, and it looked like he was going to improve offensively in Buffalo.\nHe then lost his linemates Jason Zucker and Jordan Greenway, and the centermen's game suffered. In 23 games, he had no goals and six assists.\nRecently, in his last three games, he’s had four goals and two assists for six points, and set a career-high for points in a game twice with three.\nLast season was also McLeod’s best, picking up 30 points. He now has 24, and is on pace to finish the year with 45 points.\nMcLeod feels recently he’s gotten some puck luck, and he’s trying to shoot it more and get around the net more. Sabres head coach Lindy Ruff says it’s something that maybe slipped in those 23 games.\n\"He’s getting around the front of the net, getting those second opportunities, and I think in his case, you would look at the goals he scored using his speed and that combination of getting down there between the dots and around the top of the paint, I think has gotten him some extra opportunities to score. And now they’re starting to go in,\" said Ruff on Thursday.\nGoing into a 23-game slump isn’t easy for any player.\n\"I just tried to do the right things every night, and it gets tough sometimes. But the more times you have good habits and do the right things, at least you’re helping the team, even if it’s not going in,\" McLeod said.\nMidway through the game on Wednesday, Ruff flipped McLeod with Dylan Cozens, which had him playing with Tage Thompson and Jason Zucker. McLeod admitted that when he’s playing with a goal scorer like Thompson, he’ll look for him a little more.\nJiri Kulich practiced again with the team on Thursday, and while Ruff says he’s doing well, he doesn’t think he’s going to be an option for Friday’s game against the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nMeanwhile, Jordan Greenway has progressed from just working out to skating, according to Ruff.\n\"He’s progressing, skating. He’s on a schedule that he’ll be skating for, at least, a couple of weeks on his own, and then see where he’s at,\" Ruff said.\nUkko-Pekka Luukkonen was also given the day off by Ruff after making 35 saves in Wednesday's win over the Carolina Hurricanes.",
