    "text": "A Maltese woman living in Florida experienced Hurricane Milton firsthand but, fortunately, was not severely affected by the natural disaster.\n“It was a nasty, frightening storm, but it has passed and we’re so grateful for that,” Jade Satariano, resident of Sarasota city, wrote on social media\nHurricane Milton has left a path of destruction across Florida killing 16 people and leaving around three million residents without power.\nMilton hit landfall Category 3 hurricane near Siesta Key, a barrier island connected by two bridges to Sarasota. It spawned dozens of tornadoes, 8.5 metre waves, strong winds, heavy rainfall, and a storm surge.\nMilton was forecasted to be the first major hurricane to hit Sarasota in more than 100 years. So, that’s exactly what residents there prepared for. Thankfully, the storm was not catastrophic in the area and Jade was marked safe.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Lovin Malta (@lovinmalta)\nJade sent footage to Lovin Malta of the storm’s aftermath near her home. Trees were uprooted, rain puddles were left and the roof of the barn her horses stayed at broke off. But fortunately, that was the worst of the damage for Jade.\n“Hurricane Milton reminded us that while we can’t control nature, we can control how prepared we are. Grateful for our safety, our animals safety, and for Governor DeSantis’ efforts to keep our state as safe as possible,” Jade told the newsroom earlier today.\n“We’re incredibly grateful for the minimal damage to our homes and for the barns that held strong, keeping our sweet animals safe,” her post continued.\nSatariano and her partner decided not to evacuate their home. Trusting that the house was “boarded up and sturdy” and preparing with food, water and supplies, they decided to stay put. However, they did decide to leave their horses at a barn.\nWaking up after a long and stressful night, Jade posted a heartwarming photo embracing her horse and writing “the very tired and disheveled face of a girl who got to hug her horse after Milton this morning”.\nAll wind and storm surge warnings for Milton have been discontinued after the hurricane exited Florida’s east coast. The National Hurricane Center warned that “hazards remain” from damaged buildings, downed power lines and floodwaters.\nLovin Malta’s thoughts are extended to all those devastated by the storm",

    "text": "Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg made his surprise announcement this week to slash content moderation policies in the United States - Copyright AFP Drew ANGERER There will be “real-world harm” if Meta expands its decision to scrap fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram, a global network warned Thursday while disputing Mark Zuckerberg’s claim such moderation amounts to censorship.\nMeta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s surprise announcement this week to slash content moderation policies in the United States has sparked alarm in countries such as Australia and Brazil.\nThe tech tycoon said fact-checkers were “too politically biased” and the program had led to “too much censorship”.\nBut the International Fact-Checking Network, which includes AFP among its dozens of member organizations globally, said the censorship claim was “false”.\n“We want to set the record straight, both for today’s context and for the historical record,” said the network.\nFacebook pays to use fact checks from around 80 organisations globally on the platform, as well as on WhatsApp and Instagram.\nThere could be devastating consequences if Meta broadens its policy shift beyond US borders, to programs covering more than 100 countries, the International Fact-Checking Network warned.\n“Some of these countries are highly vulnerable to misinformation that spurs political instability, election interference, mob violence and even genocide,” the network said.\n“If Meta decides to stop the program worldwide, it is almost certain to result in real-world harm in many places,” it added.\nAFP currently works in 26 languages with Facebook’s fact-checking scheme.\nIn that program, content rated “false” is downgraded in news feeds so fewer people will see it and if someone tries to share that post, they are presented with an article explaining why it is misleading.\n– Zuckerberg courts Trump –\nMeta’s policy overhaul came less than two weeks before US President-elect Donald Trump takes office and it aligns with the Republican Party’s stance.\nTrump has been a harsh critic of Meta and Zuckerberg for years, accusing the company of bias against him and threatening to retaliate against the tech billionaire once back in office.\nZuckerberg has been making efforts to reconcile with Trump since his election in November, meeting at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and donating one million dollars to his inauguration fund.\nThe Meta chief also named Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) head Dana White, a close ally of Trump, to the company board.\nAngie Drobnic Holan, director of the International Fact-Checking Network, said Tuesday the decision came after “extreme political pressure.”\nThe move “will hurt social media users who are looking for accurate, reliable information to make decisions about their everyday lives and interactions with friends and family.”\nAustralia said Meta’s decision was “a very damaging development”, while Brazil warned it was “bad for democracy”.\nMeta’s move into fact-checking came in the wake of Trump’s shock election in 2016, which critics said was enabled by rampant disinformation on Facebook and interference by foreign actors, including Russia, on the platform.",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Washington County, Wisconsin from 1901-2000 was 21.8. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Washington County, Wisconsin experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Washington County, Wisconsin history.",

    "text": "Guwahati : The North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences ( NEIGRIHMS ) in Shillong has achieved a significant milestone in cardiac surgery, performing East India’s first-ever Bo-Yang Y-Incision Aortic Annular Enlargement Surgery.\nThis innovative procedure offers improved outcomes for patients with severe aortic valve disease.\nDeveloped in 2021 by Prof. Bo Yang of the University of Michigan Health, the Bo-Yang Y-Incision technique addresses a critical issue with traditional aortic valve replacements.\nResearch has shown that traditional methods often undersize the valve by 5-7 mm, significantly reducing the valve opening and leading to faster wear and tear.\nThe Bo-Yang Y-Incision surgery overcomes this challenge by allowing for aortic root expansion. This enables the implantation of a valve 3-5 sizes larger, resulting in improved blood flow, increased valve durability, and potentially better patient survival rates.\nThe successful surgery was performed by Dr. Reuben L. Kynta, Associate Professor of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery (CTVS) at NEIGRIHMS .\nHe was ably assisted by Dr. Tabang Nyitan and Dr. Neelmajingbha Sun, both Assistant Professors of CTVS, and Dr. Priyanka Dev, Associate Professor of Anesthesiology.\nPerfusion support was provided by Perfusionists Mr. Mrinal Mandal and Loosar Dkhar, alongside the skilled staff of the CTVS-OT and CTVS-ICU.\nProf. Nalin Mehta, Director of NEIGRIHMS, lauded the achievement as a significant advancement in cardiac care.\nHe highlighted that the new technique allows for the implantation of an artificial valve with a similar or larger opening than the patient’s native valve, avoiding the undersizing issues associated with traditional methods.\nProf. Mehta said this accomplishment underscores NEIGRIHMS’ commitment to providing the most advanced cardiac surgical care for patients in the region.",

    "text": "Hiking the Trails and Honoring My Roots in Hocking Hills State Park \"For every park, there's a story of someone who saved it from becoming something else.\" Ever since I read these words in Jenny Odell's book \"How to Do Nothing,\" I've wanted to find the stories of such people. I love parks, and I love all that they bring to our lives. So when my Aunt Mary suggested we go hiking in one of her favorite spots during a recent visit, I immediately wanted to know how this favorite trail of hers was preserved for us to enjoy. The trail? Cantwell Cliffs in Hocking Hills State Park in southeast Ohio. With Odell's declaration in my brain, I started looking for the park's origin story. What I found was not necessarily an individual but instead the movement of the late 1800s that championed the preservation of forest lands and helped establish our nation's first state parks. John A. Warder was a Cincinnati, Ohio, physician who helped establish the American Forestry Association in 1875. The first American Forestry Congress was held in Cincinnati, and it kick-started the state association that played a major role in legislation establishing the Ohio State Forestry Bureau. This was pretty progressive for its day. Ohio was one of the first states to have a forestry program along with California, Colorado and New York. The Bureau allowed for a paid staff member to survey and assess the forests of Ohio and their major cause of destruction. This effort along with grassroots organizations throughout the state were later given a boost by President Theodore Roosevelt's interest in the first few years of the 1900s. The Weeks Law of 1911 established collaboration for national forests in the eastern United States. But it was the new concept of state-owned forest parks in the 1920s that would place certain areas that were usually of geologic interest in public ownership for both preservation and public use. And according to the Department of Forestry's \"A Legacy of Stewardship\" publication, Hocking Hills State Park was Ohio's first such place. It was acquired in 1924. For this, I am extremely grateful. Hiking through these rock formations with my family, we bear witness to the millions of years the sediment holds. It is nothing short of spiritual. I am also hyperaware that the land did not belong to us when we trod across it. Preserving these beautiful areas also gives us an opportunity to honor that horrific past. The Shawnee, Delaware, and Wyandot tribes lived in Hocking Hills in the 1600s and 1700s, but they are no more. We cannot have gratitude for the incredible spaces to hike without having pause for the lives taken and cultures destroyed in the process. These truths are also part of our roots. All of that history lay at our feet while hiking the 2-mile trail with some of the people I love most in this world. I marveled at rock formations with my 8-year-old son and challenged my physical limits while learning even more about myself, my family and the land we so often take for granted. ===",

    "title": "Canicule : Nintendo recommande de ne pas utiliser sa Switch 2",
    "text": "Avec la deuxième vague de températures caniculaires de l’été, Nintendo rappelle les bases quant à l’utilisation de sa nouvelle console hybride.\nPeut-être faites-vous partie des quelque 6 millions de personnes s’étant déjà procuré une Nintendo Switch 2 ? Si tel est le cas, quoi de plus naturel que de profiter des vacances en enchaînant les courses sur Mario Kart World ou en ravageant tout sur son passage dans Donkey Kong: Bananza. Seulement, avec les températures qui atteignent une nouvelle fois des records en France, jouer à la console n’est peut-être pas une si bonne idée.\nNintendo alerte sur les risques de surchauffe\nAlors que les températures vont de nouveau dépasser les 40ºC dans plusieurs régions de l’Hexagone, Nintendo rappelle sur son compte X au Japon que l’utilisation de ses consoles portables sous une très forte chaleur peut causer des problèmes. Dans son post, Nintendo indique que la Switch 2, mais également les différentes versions de la Switch 1, doivent idéalement être utilisées « dans un environnement compris entre 5 et 35ºC » sous peine de subir des dysfonctionnements.\nDe la même façon que l’on vous conseillait sans doute, enfants, de ne pas laisser votre Game Boy en plein soleil, l’utilisation de la Switch sous un soleil de plomb peut amener la console à surchauffer. Cela peut avoir plusieurs effets : d’abord, pour faire tomber le mercure, la Switch 2 pourrait tirer ses performances vers le bas pour améliorer la dissipation de chaleur.\nAussi, la batterie est un composant particulièrement sensible aux variations de température. L’autonomie de la dernière console de Nintendo n’étant pas particulièrement son point fort, éviter d’y jouer par temps de canicule, c’est allonger l’endurance de sa batterie. Enfin, mais cela paraît logique, une console (ou un ordinateur) en fonctionnement dégage forcément de la chaleur. Dans un contexte où beaucoup peinent déjà à rafraîchir leur intérieur, se priver momentanément de console peut contribuer à faire baisser un peu la température.\nLes bonnes pratiques pour améliorer la durabilité de sa Switch 2\nCe conseil, que Nintendo avait déjà prodigué lors d’une précédente vague de chaleur dans son pays, s’ajoute à d’autres bonnes pratiques qui peuvent améliorer la durabilité globale de la Switch 2. Une console qui, rappelons-le, est considérée comme peu réparable par les experts de iFixit.\nOutre l’utilisation à modérer lors des grosses chaleurs, il est également conseillé de brider volontairement la batterie de sa console via les réglages dédiés. En effet, une batterie s’épuise à mesure que sont consommés des « cycles de recharge », c’est-à-dire un passage de 0 à 100% d’autonomie. En bridant la capacité de sa batterie à 80%, on améliore mécaniquement la durée de vie totale de l’accumulateur. Une option particulièrement conseillée si vous jouez essentiellement à la Switch 2 depuis votre domicile, où vous trouverez facilement de quoi la recharger si besoin.\nEnfin, l’écran de la console est particulièrement facile à rayer — y compris en la rangeant tout simplement dans son dock. Pour éviter les mauvaises surprises, pensez à appliquer un film protecteur, et de préférence en verre trempé.",
