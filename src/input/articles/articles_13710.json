    "title": "Man who died with wife and son in Alberta lake wasn't a risk-taker, says friend",
    "text": "An Edmonton man who died with his wife and eight-year-old son after their utility terrain vehicle went into a lake wasn't the kind of person to put his family at risk, says a friend.\n\"I would never, ever think he was the type of person to purposely put himself or his wife and kid in any kind of danger,\" Michael Occhionero said.\n\"To me, that's a freak accident.\"\nKelly Pelsma, 39; his wife, Laura Pelsma, 37; and their son, Dylan, were reported missing Christmas Day. They hadn't been heard from since Dec. 23 and were last seen in Alberta Beach, northwest of Edmonton on Lac Ste. Anne, on a side-by-side vehicle.\nOn Tuesday, RCMP said an underwater recovery team found the family and warned about the dangers of thin ice. Their bodies were found in the water along with the vehicle in an area near the Alexis Bridge.\nOcchionero, who lives in Idaho, said he and a group of friends met Kelly Pelsma at UTV Invasion, a gathering of side-by-side off-road enthusiasts, in 2018 in Idaho.\nPelsma's side-by-side had broken down and Occhionero said they helped him put a new belt on the vehicle.\n\"We had a good time with him, rode around, talked a lot, drank, had fires, and watched drag racing and stuff.\"\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Occhionero said he and Pelsma talked on the phone a few times a month.\nHe and Pelsma reunited at this year's event in St. Anthony, Idaho. Pelsma also brought his wife and their son.\n\"It was just me and the three of them,\" said Occhionero. \"We had a great time.\"\nHe said Pelsma was like a giant teddy bear who also liked adventure.\n\"He liked to live life on the edge, but I think all of us motorheads do to some degree,\" Occhionero said.\n\"He was very cautious, like a calculated-risk type of guy.\"\nPhotos of Pelsma and his family at the UTV event were posted on his Facebook page in September. Laura Pelsma also posted smiling pictures of their wedding day from the spring. The couple and their son posed near an oil derrick.\nKelly Pelsma was a cast member in \"Licence to Drill,\" a reality TV series that followed rig hands drilling oil in Alberta, B.C. and the Northwest Territories. The show aired on Discovery Channel Canada from 2010 to 2014.\nA synopsis of the show says Pelsma worked on a rig in central Alberta. During the show's last season, Pelsma and the cast travelled to work at an oil site in Louisiana.\nSkye Nipshank of Calgary, a cast member who worked at a different site, said he was sorry to hear about the deaths.\nHe said he knew Pelsma through Bonanza Drilling, the company Pelsmahad worked for.\n\"Kelly was a person who lived life to the fullest and all the people who had the chance to work with him knew he liked to work hard and play harder,\" Nipshank said in an online message.\nJoe Blakeman, reeve of Lac Ste. Anne County, said the Pelsma family was relatively new to the lake and might have not been familiar with the area.\nThey bought property there in August, he said.\nA current runs below the bridge where their bodies were found, Blakeman said, and the water near it doesn't completely freeze over.\n\"It's always open water and it has been like that my whole life, 57 years,\" he said. \"It hasn't changed.\n\"The lakes, they're never 100 per cent safe, and you got to know where you're going and know what you're up against.\"\nHe said there's a sign on the bridge warning people of the current and thin ice, but the sign hasn't been maintained in a while.\n\"I had a call from a couple summer villages yesterday and they're wondering if we should do something (about the sign),\" he said.\n\"This is definitely a tragedy. All the years I've been here, there have been trucks that have gone through the ice there, there have been snowmobiles.\n\"We've just never lost a life.\"\nOcchionero said he had planned to visit the Pelsmas this winter to go snowmobiling.\nHe said others in the UTV community in Idaho have also reached out to to him about the tragedy.\n\"They were a great couple and great people who wanted to be friends with everybody.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nJamin Mike and Jeremy Simes, The Canadian Press",

    "title": "'Their Ideology Of Raja Maharaja': Rahul Gandhi Attacks BJP, Cites 'Slavery' Story At Nagpur Rally",
    "text": "- By [Anushka Vats](/authors/anushka-vats) - Updated: Fri, 29 Dec 2023 12:05 AM (IST) - Source:JND Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday took a swipe at the BJP and RSS and accused them of taking the country back to the pre-independence era of slavery, and said the BJP ideology is the ideology of \"Raja-Maharajas\" (kings) who do not listen to anyone and where an order comes from the top and everybody has to follow it. While addressing the 'Hain Taiyyar Hum' rally in Nagpur district, he asserted that the BJP treats its leaders and employees like slaves and that the voice of the bottom rungs is ignored, citing an exchange with a BJP MP who had previously been a member of the Congress. That was what happened with (present Maharashtra Congress chief) Nana Patole who left the saffron party after questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi on farmers' issues, he added. He also said that there is an ongoing conflict between two opposing ideologies in the country. \"There is a fight of ideologies going on in the country. People think that it is a political fight, a fight for power, it is, but the foundation of this fight is of ideology, of two opposing ideologies. (Desh mai vichardhaara ki ladai chal rahi hai, logo ko lagta hai rajneetik ladai hai, satta ki ladai hai, vo hai, magar iss ladai ki neev jo hai vo vichardhara hai, do vichardhara hai,\" said the Wayanad MP.

I met him secretly, he spoke out of fear and said, Rahul ji, I want to talk to you. I asked him what do you want to talk about, you are in BJP. Tension was visible on his face, I asked him if everything was okay. To which he answered no,\" said Rahul Gandhi. \"He said Rahul ji, I can't bear being in BJP. I am in BJP but my heart is in Congress. I said, your heart is in Congress, your body is in BJP, meaning the heart is afraid of bringing the body to Congress. I asked him why is your mind not set on the party. To which the BJP leader replied 'BJP mai ghulami chalti hai' (slavery continues in the BJP),\" said the Congress leader.

    "title": "La Princesa Leonor inaugura este viernes con su viaje oficial a Portugal su agenda internacional",
    "text": "La Princesa Leonor inaugurará este viernes su agenda internacional con su visita a Portugal, la primera que realiza de forma oficial como heredera del trono fuera de España y con la que se busca escenificar la estrecha relación entre los dos países que comparten la Península Ibérica.\nEl viaje se produce a invitación expresa del presidente portugués, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, quien ha mantenido una estrecha relación en los últimos años con Felipe VI. Desde Zarzuela se consideró oportuno que fuera Portugal el primer país que visitara oficialmente la Princesa de Asturias.\nLa elección de Portugal como primer destino fuera de España, resaltaron tanto la Presidencia lusa como el Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores español al dar a conocer la visita, \"refleja y refuerza los lazos de fraternidad y cercanía que unen a ambos países\".\nLa hija mayor de Felipe VI será despedida con honores en el Pabellón de Estado del aeropuerto de Barajas, como ocurre siempre que los Reyes realizan un viaje oficial al extranjero, y viajará acompañada para la ocasión por el ministro de Asuntos Exteriores, José Manuel Albares, así como por el jefe de la Casa del Rey, Camilo Villarino.\nSu desplazamiento a Lisboa, donde será recibida con un cordón de honor en el aeropuerto militar Figo Maduro, arrancará con una visita al Monasterio de los Jerónimos acompañada por la directora del mismo, Margarida Donas, y por el prior de Santa María de Belén, José Manuel Dos Santos.\nAquí, la Princesa Leonor realizará una ofrenda floral ante la tumba de Luis de Camoes, considerado generalmente como el mayor poeta en lengua portuguesa de la historia y que se encuentra enterrado muy cerca de otro ilustre portugués, el navegante Vasco de Gama.\nDesde el Monasterio, incluido por la UNESCO en el Patrimonio de la Humanidad, la Princesa de Asturias se trasladará escoltada por un escuadrón de caballería hasta el Palacio de Belén, residencia oficial del presidente de la República, donde Rebelo de Sousa la recibirá con honores.\nGran Cruz de la Orden Militar de Cristo\nPrueba de la relevancia que Portugal confiere a la visita es el hecho de que la heredera del trono recibirá la Gran Cruz de la Orden Militar de Cristo de manos del presidente portugués.\nEsta distinción, heredera de la orden de los Caballeros Templarios en el país, se concede para reconocer los servicios prestados al país por altos cargos y funcionarios. Según explica la propia Presidencia lusa, se concede frecuentemente a los cónyuges de jefes de Estado extranjeros en visita oficial y solo de forma excepcional a algunos de estos últimos.\nDon Felipe, entonces aún Príncipe de Asturias, también recibió la Gran Cruz de la Orden de Cristo en su primera visita a Portugal en octubre de 1988, mientras que Juan Carlos I fue condecorado en 1996 y Doña Sofía la recibió en 1978. Asimismo, goza de esta distinción el expresidente Felipe González, quien fue distinguido en 1984.\nLa Princesa de Asturias mantendrá a continuación un encuentro con Rebelo de Sousa, en el que estará acompañada tanto por Albares como por Villarino, además del embajador español en Lisboa, Juan Fernández Trigo, mientras que por parte lusa también estará presente el ministro de Exteriores, Paulo Rangel.\nPara terminar, el presidente portugués ofrecerá un almuerzo en honor de la heredera del trono, en el que está previsto que esta pronuncie un brindis en el que con toda seguridad pondrá de relieve la importancia de las relaciones hispanolusas y agradecerá la invitación.\nVal oceanario de Lisboa OCEANARIO DE LISBOA\nTal y como se adelantó cuando se dio a conocer la fecha del viaje, este \"tendrá un enfoque particular en la protección del medio ambiente y la conservación de los océanos, temas prioritarios para Portugal y España\". Esto explica que la agenda se completará con una visita al Oceanário de Lisboa.\nAquí, será recibida por el propio Rebelo de Sousa y por el presidente de la Fundación Océano Azul, Tiago Pitta, y llevará a cabo una visita a las instalaciones junto con la bióloga y educadora marina Marina Duarte. Tras ello, está previsto una reunión y mesa redonda sobre 'Defensa del océano, expediciones científicas y políticas oceánicas y economía' junto con jóvenes científicos.\nCon este encuentro, la Princesa Leonor pondrá punto y final a su primer acto oficial fuera de España en representación de la Casa del Rey, con el que inicia una nueva etapa en su agenda, que comienza a estar algo más cargada ahora que ya ha alcanzado la mayoría de edad, aunque sigue estando condicionada a sus obligaciones en el marco de la formación militar en la que está aún inmersa.",

    "text": "(Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday he had confidence in Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland and that the two would continue to work together, damping reports of tensions between her and the prime minister's aides.\nCanada's Globe and Mail, citing unidentified sources, reported earlier on Thursday that the relationship between Freeland and the prime minister's office had become strained over what the newspaper said was the perception that she had been ineffective in delivering an upbeat economic message.\nSpeaking to reporters in Washington, Trudeau said Freeland has been a close friend and partner in doing \"really big things for Canada\" and she would continue her work on housing and the economy, among other areas.\nTrudeau, in power since 2015, shuffled much of his cabinet last year with the aim of increasing focus on economic issues, such as a housing shortage and the rising cost of living - issues that have hurt his standing with voters.\nThe prime minister brought seven new people into cabinet, but kept prominent ministers including Freeland in their portfolios.\n\"She is a critical and essential member of my team and I'm fully confident in her abilities,\" Trudeau said of Freeland, who also serves as deputy prime minister.\nThe Globe reported that concern over Freeland had stemmed from low approval ratings for the Liberal government, especially after it lost a once-safe Toronto constituency in a special election last month.\nThe newspaper said there had been discussions internally about bringing in former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney to replace Freeland as finance minister, a post she has held for nearly four years.\nTrudeau said he had been talking with Carney for years to convince him to join federal politics and that he would be an \"outstanding addition at a time when Canadians need good people to step up.\"\nThe next federal election must be held by the end of October 2025. A range of polls show the Liberals would lose badly to the main opposition Conservative Party.\n(Reporting by Ismail Shakil in Ottawa; Editing by Frank McGurty and Rod Nickel)\nBy Ismail Shakil\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "title": "Inside The Sympathizer Episode 4: A Scathingly Funny Takedown of Vietnam War Movies",
    "text": "Up in the Santa Clarita mountains, as Viet Thanh Nguyen toured the set of The Sympathizer ’s fourth episode, “Give Us Some Good Lines,” he found himself feeling the way he had when he wrote the novel on which the series is based. This standalone installment of the HBO adaptation, set in the immediate aftermath of the Vietnam War, focused on the making of The Hamlet , a fictional gritty film modeled after ‘70s classics like Apocalypse Now! “It’s a funny, satirical section of the novel, but the tragedy comes in because all the stuff that Hollywood is making in the movie actually references real tragedy,” the author says.\nA guide to Hollywood’s biggest races ” class=”external-link external-link-embed__hed-link button” data-event-click='{“element”:”ExternalLink”,”outgoingURL”:”https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/award-season”}’ href=”https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/award-season” rel=”noopener” target=”_blank”> A guide to Hollywood’s biggest races Arrow A guide to Hollywood’s biggest races ” class=”external-link external-link-embed__image-link” data-event-click='{“element”:”ExternalLink”,”outgoingURL”:”https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/award-season”}’ href=”https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/award-season” rel=”noopener” target=”_blank”>\nHe saw an entire decimated village recreated, the production design emphasizing downed helicopters and bloody casualties. “I had to take a second look before I realized they were mannequins lying in the pond, in the rice paddies,” Nguyen says. “There were body parts that had been manufactured lying around as well. Again, that was a little funny and disconcerting—all at the same time.”\nIt’s a stark visual representation of what The Sympathizer accomplishes as a whole, upending the Western lens of the war in a darkly comic way. The show follows the Captain ( Hoa Xuande ), a Vietnamese refugee who’s landed in Los Angeles and is playing the role of double agent—ostensibly working under a South Vietnamese general, but secretly reporting back to the communist regime in Hanoi—and observes his incredulity at all versions of the American perspective. In Nguyen’s original, Pulitzer Prize-winning book, the Captain eventually goes to the Philippines to work as a Vietnamese consultant on production for The Hamlet , where he notices how the very people the film supposedly intends to honor are being marginalized. (The series version relocates the production to just outside of L.A.)\n“I grew up watching most of the major movies that Hollywood made about the Vietnam War—in the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s, 2000s—and they impacted me mostly negatively,” Nguyen says. “I realized that many of them were good-to-great works of art, but works of art in which the Vietnamese of all kinds were erased or effaced or silenced or violated.” He calls this section of The Sympathizer his “revenge”—one as scathingly comic as it is painfully sad.\nFirework content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\nThe Captain manages to secretly embed pro-communist messaging into The Hamlet ’s dialogue, since nobody on set, least of all the director (known as “The Auteur,” played by Robert Downey Jr. in one of several roles), speaks Vietnamese. We can laugh at that playful deception. But when the Captain is horrifically injured on set near episode’s end? Not so much.\n“It’s funny. We had Vietnamese consultants—cultural consultants, dialogue consultants, language consultants—on our [show], and I’m combining all of those different roles into this one role that I had to replicate on this faux set,” says Xuande, who is Vietnamese Australian. “You feel like every time the media or Hollywood turns their attention to a part of the conflict, only one perspective is ever seen or drawn upon.”\nThat’s what leads to The Sympathizer ’s dark final-act turn in its portrait of The Hamlet . “By the time you reach the end of the novel, hopefully it’s clear to the reader that everything that happens in the filmmaking segment foreshadows what happens at the end [of The Sympathizer ],” Nguyen says. “The Hollywood segment is actually pivotal in terms of connecting the first half to the second half—and the second half of the novel and the second half of the TV series get a lot more tragic.”\nThe making of The Hamlet marks a crucial midpoint in The Sympathizer . It made sense to Nguyen that the show would place that action squarely in the middle of its seven-part run, and play as a kind of standalone episode. The idea was first discussed with co-showrunner Don McKellar, and would mark a fresh start overall for the series. Though McKellar’s writing partner Park Chan-wook had directed the show’s first three episodes, Oscar-nominated Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Mereilles ( City of God ) came in for episode four, putting his own stamp on the material.\n“It makes fun of how Americans see themselves as the center of the world, and how sometimes arrogant they are. Me being a foreigner, I see that. That’s nothing really new,” Mereilles says. “It was only making fun of something that I always see.”\nThis shift in focus introduces the Captain, and by extension the audience, to a new world and cast of characters. There’s Downey’s Auteur, whom Nguyen had initially envisioned as a satire of Francis Ford Coppola. “All of that was drawn from the available material on the making of Apocalypse Now! and on Francis Ford Coppola’s biographies,” he says. Mereilles, in turn, looked at production photos from that Oscar-winning movie for inspiration. “The difference between me shooting this episode and Coppola shooting Apocalypse Now is that I had only 13 days to shoot,” he cracks.\nThen came Downey. The Oscar-winning actor found great reference points in his own upbringing: his father is filmmaker Robert Downey Sr. “He knew all these directors. They would go to his house when he was a kid,” Mereilles says. “Who am I to tell him how American directors from the ‘70s were?” Downey found a natural collaborator in Meirelles, given the director’s improvisation-heavy style. “I like to shoot more like a documentary—I play the whole scene from top to the end, and I position cameras so the actor can do whatever they want,” Mereilles says. “Robert loves to start and he doesn’t know where he’s going to go.”\nWe’re also introduced to two actors on the set: an intense American method star played by David Duchovny, and a Korean-American actor slotted into a stereotype-heavy role, portrayed by John Cho. The latter’s casting was intently meta. “For a good part of our generation, John was that Korean-American star that we saw in every television show that necessitated an Asian male character,” Xuande says. Nguyen made sure to visit the set on a day Cho was there, since he’d hoped Cho would play this part. He caught the actor doing a scene where he’s half-naked and being tortured, representative of his dilemma in the book.\nDuchovny’s role, known as “The Thespian,” carried obvious shades of Marlon Brando. We never see him break character as he hurls brutally racist and sexist insults, in line with his role of a dehumanized American soldier. “The amazing thing about Brando was he came off like he didn’t care, but he cared so much. I wanted to get at the kind of gamesmanship that I’ve heard he did on set in order to get real reactions out of people, even if it was just putting his lines on somebody’s forehead,” Duchovny says. Nguyen also had actors like Harvey Keitel and Martin Sheen in mind while writing the book. Mereilles found inspiration elsewhere: The idea of the character living in a tent was drawn from a story he’d heard about Daniel Day-Lewis.\nMereilles wanted the Thespian to go as wild as Duchovny would allow. “I just thought, ‘I’ve got to keep it within some kind of realistic frame,’” Duchovny says. “Fernando would say, ‘Crazier, crazier, crazier.’ I’d go, “Okay!’ He’d say, ‘That didn’t sound crazy.’ I said, ‘Felt crazy, but let’s keep going.’” Duchovny found it an interesting acting challenge, but this was hardly the way he’d prefer to work as an actor: “To do it for months at a time, that’s a whole other kind of living. Would I do that? I guess I’d try. But I’m not sure that that leads to my best work.”\nOne particularly harrowing scene sees The Thespian determined to act out a rape as scripted, before it’s broken up at the last possible moment. The scene was meticulously blocked out with an intimacy coordinator—as, one can safely assume, would not have been the case on a ‘70s movie set. “It was very step by step: ‘Is this okay? Is this okay?’” Duchovny says. “It was very cool that way, and I hope it was cool for everybody.”\nThe Sympathizer is a show made by outsiders to the U.S., from the Canadian McKellar to Brazilian Mereilles to many Vietnamese cast and crew members. It’s that reality, that shared understanding, that made Nguyen feel comfortable with the tone of the adaptation’s satire, and its feel for the heartbreak that travels hand in hand with its dark comedy. But the author hopes viewers can enjoy the ride as well.\n“ Tropic Thunder is one of the movies I’m seeing being referenced, and the opening 15 minutes where they are satirizing Hollywood Vietnam War movies—that’s a masterful piece of filmmaking,” the author says with a grin. “That was also in my mind as I was writing the satire of this.”\nListen to Vanity Fair’ s Little Gold Men podcast now.\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair What to Know Before the Met Gala Begins\nHow to Watch the 2024 Met Gala Live Stream\nCover Star Chris Hemsworth on Fear, Love, and Furiosa\nThe Vatican’s Secret Role in the Science of IVF\nHow Zero Bond Became New York’s Celebrity Playground\nKristi Noem Doubles Down on Decision to Kill Family Dog\nFrom the Archive: The Devil in Bette Davis\nStay in the know and subscribe to Vanity Fair for just $2.50 $1 per month.\nThe post Inside The Sympathizer Episode 4: A Scathingly Funny Takedown of Vietnam War Movies appeared first on Vanity Fair .",

    "text": "Sociales SOCIALES Perú llora la pérdida del cantante Pedro Suárez Vértiz Ícono del rock, fallece a los 54 años tras una valiente batalla contra la atrofia muscular El cantante peruano Pedro Suárez Vértiz, venerado como uno de los íconos del rock en Perú, falleció a la edad de 54 años en la mañana de hoy. La noticia fue confirmada por fuentes de la Asociación Peruana de Autores y Compositores (Apdayc). Su deceso se produjo tras una prolongada batalla contra la atrofia muscular, una enfermedad degenerativa que afectó su salud y lo alejó de los escenarios hace varios años. La Policía Nacional del Perú llegó a su residencia a las 6:55 a.m., donde conversaron con el hijo mayor del cantante, confirmando que la muerte se debió a causas naturales, certificadas por el médico privado que lo atendía. A pesar de su lucha contra la enfermedad, Pedro Suárez Vértiz no se apartó por completo de la música. Este año 2023, gracias a un trabajo conjunto con la inteligencia artificial, logró regresar al mundo musical después de 12 años con el lanzamiento de su nuevo sencillo, \"Amor yo te perdí la fe\". El cantautor peruano, conocido por éxitos como \"Un vino, una cerveza\", \"Lo olvidé\", y \"Los globos del cielo\", utilizaba activamente sus redes sociales para compartir reflexiones y opiniones sobre diversos temas. Su último mensaje en Facebook, publicado esta madrugada, mostraba su espíritu navideño y, de alguna manera, reflejaba su personalidad única. Pedro Suárez Vértiz contaba con una amplia base de seguidores en redes sociales, con más de 3.2 millones en Facebook y 831 mil en Instagram. La Presidencia de la República de Perú expresó sus condolencias, calificando al artista como destacado y resaltando su invaluable contribución a la historia musical del Perú. Reacciones de colegas músicos, como Gian Marco y Eva Ayllón, inundaron las redes sociales, recordando la genialidad y el impacto de Pedro Suárez Vértiz en la escena musical peruana.",

    "text": "CCJ celebrates 20th anniversary\nPORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (CMC) — The Caribbean Court of Justice is on Wednesday celebrating its 20th anniversary with the outgoing President Justice Adrian Saunders saying, “today is a time for reflection and giving thanks”.\nThe judicial institution of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), established in 2005 to replace the London-based Privy Council as the region’s highest and final court, has both an appellate and original jurisdiction. It also serves as an international tribunal interpreting the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas that governs the 15-member regional integration grouping.\nSaunders, the third Caribbean national to head the Trinidad-based court following the late Justice Michael de la Bastide and Sir Dennis Byron, said for the past 20 years, the CCJ has upheld the rule of law, safeguarded rights and strengthened Caribbean jurisprudence.\n“The court has been a shining example of Caribbean ingenuity, with its innovative funding arrangement, in the form of the CCJ Trust Fund, and, through the establishment of the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission, its insulation from external interference in its recruitment practices,” said the St Vincent and the Grenadines born jurist.\n“This anniversary is not just a celebration of 20 long years, but also of our enduring commitment to delivering accessible, fair and efficient justice to the people and states of the Caribbean.\n“It is a privilege and an honour to serve the people of this region, and we, the judges and staff of the court, are incredibly grateful to have had that opportunity over the past 20 years. We look forward to doing so for the next 20 years and beyond,” Justice Saunders said.\nThe milestone was celebrated with an Interfaith Service of Reflection and Prayer at the Queen’s Hall, in St Ann’s on the outside of the capital, which was also attended by the Trinidad and Tobago head of state, Christine Kangaloo.\nIt was also attended by members of the Judiciary of Trinidad and Tobago, government, the Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO), regional stakeholders, members of the diplomatic corps, the legal fraternity, and commissioners of the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission (RJLSC).\nRJLSC member, Sophia Chote SC, told the ceremony that the achievements of the CCJ are the achievements of the Caribbean region.\n“We continue to have commissions which are responsible and which ensure that the CCJ’s bench is populated only with the best. The judges themselves are acutely aware of their responsibility to the region and discharge their duties with diligence and integrity,” she said.\n“The registrar and her staff and other arms of the organisation continue to perform their duties with responsibility and innovation. The educational arm of the CCJ has had valuable outreach with judges, lawyers and law students throughout the region,” Chote added.",
