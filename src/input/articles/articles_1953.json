    "text": "Shepsi: unlimited energy. We received a postcard in the mail from PSE&G, offering a free service known as a “Quick Home Energy Check-up.” When you sign up for this service, an energy adviser will come to your home to offer professional tips and advice regarding the following four areas:\n“Insulation levels in walls, ceilings and attics.”\n“Air leakage around windows and doors.”\n“Overall efficiency of your heating and cooling systems, as well as water heating equipment.”\n“Lighting fixtures and appliances.”\nTwo years ago, I signed up for this check-up, and even though I was told we could participate on a yearly basis, I did not sign up the next year. Now as 2024 is beginning to wane, my husband suggested we sign up again. I thought that there would not be much difference between what was offered from one year to the next.\nDuring the course of this audit, I learned PSE&G hires a consulting company specializing in energy assessments to partner with them and perform each audit. When the multi-year contract is up, PSE&G may re-hire the same company or they may hire a different company to perform the inspections. Either way, the contract will be renegotiated, which affects the variety and quantity of the free products given to PSE&G’s home audit customers.\nFor instance, two years ago the technician could replace up to 20 bulbs with LED light bulbs. That sounds like a large amount, but if you have multiple rooms with recessed lighting, 20 bulbs will be used up quickly. In 2022, we literally walked through my home, counting aloud, “OK, let’s allot four of the 20 bulbs to the living room and two bulbs in the dining room. That makes six. Give me four in the kitchen. How many is that? Ten. I have 10 left for other parts of the house. Or should we let the other rooms be and put all 20 bulbs on the main floor? Ow! My head is hurting.”\nThis time around, there was no limit to the number of bulbs offered. Not too shabby! What’s more, our technician, Peter, brought various shades of light bulbs, such as bright white light and softer yellow, and advised us of the best type of light for each room.\nThe previous technician offered me a new water-saving shower head—just one for each home. It was a no-frills kind that attached straight to the wall, known as a “fixed shower head.” In contrast, this year we could have three shower heads installed and a choice of a fixed shower head or a hand-held sprayer. Even though we had a fixed shower head installed two years ago in the bathroom my daughter and son-in-law use when they visit, I asked Peter to install a hand-held model in that bathroom. Wasteful, uneconomical and extravagant? I think not. What mother/grandmother\nwouldn’t want to increase her family’s comfort? After all, each trip they make to visit us in New Jersey involves intense traffic, construction work, and possibly very cranky children. Every once in a while, they may ask themselves how much they really want to make the trek. We try to offer certain comforts to sweeten the pot. Nevertheless, as convenient as a hand-held shower head is, I need to state that these water-saving shower heads offer a weaker spray because the way to save money is by restricting the water flow.\nAs it turned out, the audit went beyond energy-efficient tips. In one of my bathrooms, Peter pointed out that my shower caddy, which is designed to sling directly over the fixed shower head, had accumulated too many large bottles. All the weight placed on the caddy could cause a domino effect. First, the shower valve, which is on the other side of the tiled wall, could snap, the pipe would then open and water would spew out behind the wall. Water leaking down the inside of any wall could lead to mold and mildew. Repairing the wall and mold remediation are both expensive. For peace of mind, I decided to avoid these possibilities, and I tossed this shower caddy. The next one will be placed in a safe corner.\nDid you know there may be a way for you to save energy when you go away for more than two days? It involves checking if your water heater has a box with a temperature dial attached, including a “Vac” mode, or vacation mode. Before going on a trip, the temperature dial should be moved to “Vac” and the water temperature will go down low enough to reduce the heat and thus the bill, but not low enough for the pipes to freeze in cold weather. Have you ever turned on the water in someone else’s kitchen and instantly felt scalding hot water? Many people may not know what to do to change this, but I now know. The aforementioned box on the water heater has been set too high. The temperature switch should be lowered. It is worth taking a little time to examine the dial on your water heater.\nWhile we are on the subject of water heaters, Peter advised us to replace ours before the warranty expires. No appliance is made to last anymore. In our case, he advised us not to wait until the 10th year when our warranty is up before buying a new one. A broken water heater will not merely stop making hot water, it could burst and cause a flood. Insurance does not always cover the damage. Drying out the wet floors and walls using towels and fans takes a long time, and mold and mildew may develop.\nFinally, Peter emailed us a report detailing the steps we can take to make our home more energy-efficient. These suggestions included insulating the door of our pull-down attic, weather stripping around doors and windows, keeping our windows locked when shut, and stopping the drafts that come through the ceiling from our recessed lighting. He installed all the LED bulbs that we needed, choosing the appropriate type of lighting for us. Also, he installed two hand-held shower heads. All free of charge! Maybe there is no such thing as a free lunch, but every year we can have a free energy audit.\nIf you are interested in signing up for the free Home Energy Check-up, call 855-846-2895 or visit pseg.com/QHEC .",

    "title": "First Alert Weather Day: Dangerous heat along with the potential for strong storms Friday",
    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. ( WBRC ) - Good morning! We have declared another First Alert Weather Day for heat, but I’m concerned we could also see severe storms today. The chance for storms will be increasing in the afternoon and evening. Scattered storms will be moving south across the area, with a risk for damaging wind gusts, large hail, and frequent cloud to ground lightning. The primary timing will be from 1 to 10 p.m., although some storms may remain on radar past midnight. The weekend will feature a slight improvement in heat levels, with highs in the low 90s. We still could see a few pop-up storms in the state, but mainly into south Alabama. Otherwise, there will be plenty of breaks for outdoor activities. All eyes will be on the Gulf of Mexico as there is now a 50% chance of development withing the next 48-hoursa and an 80% chance for development within the next 7-days. The tropical disturbance we’ve been talking about throughout the week is now expected to favor the track into the Gulf of Mexico. The system should approach the Gulf Coast late Sunday and Monday. Several models show the system crossing the big bend of Florida and moving northeast. However, there is a scenario that shows the system stalling and possibly meandering over the region, and even shifting west next week. No direct impacts are expected in our area through Monday; however, we will maintain a chance for scattered storms. If the system trends west we could see more significant impacts to rain chances, so stay tuned. If you have plans to visit the Gulf Coast, there is increasing confidence in higher rain chances and a risk for flooding along the eastern Florida Panhandle, possibly beginning as early as Sunday.

    "text": "Horse killed in Saunders County crash; man suspected of driving under the influence ASHLAND, Neb. (KOLN) - A Fremont man is accused of driving his vehicle into a horse and killing it while under the influence. The Saunders County Sheriff’s Office arrested 33-year-old Brandon Schneckenberger in late May. He’s charged with criminal mischief, refusing to submit to a test, assaulting an officer and failing to stop and render aid. On May 29, Ashland Police got a call about a hit and run. An officer stopped a vehicle in regards to that call near Highway 66 and Bills Drive in north Ashland. Schneckenberger, later identified as the driver and sole occupant, was placed under arrest and sat in a patrol vehicle. Authorities photographed Schneckenberger’s vehicle and spotted horsehair stuck in the windshield and severe damage to the front passenger side, according to an arrest affidavit. Deputies said an empty shooter bottle was also recovered from the vehicle. While at the scene, authorities learned that a horse had been struck by a vehicle in the area. The horse died, and its rider was taken to an Omaha hospital. Deputies tried getting a breath sample from Schneckenberger, but refused to give one twice, court records show. Authorities also allege that Schneckenberger made a deputy’s finger bleed during a search of his person. Further investigation showed that Schneckenberger had been driving without registration and proof of insurance, according to deputies. He had also been convicted of DUI on three previous occasions. Schneckenberger was arraigned on the charges in early June. His bond was set at 10% of $50,000, which was posted on June 4. His next court appearance is scheduled for July 11.

    "text": "Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei took to social media this week to chastise the West over the treatment of women, a move which has attracted incredulity given Iran's record on women's rights.\n\"In the West, #women’s dignity is being shattered more and more every day. All of the things that destroy the #family are increasing by the day in the West,\" Khamenei wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday.\nIn the West, #women ’s dignity is being shattered more and more every day. All of the things that destroy the #family are increasing by the day in the West.\n— Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) December 27, 2023\nThe Islamic Republic has come under increased scrutiny and criticism for women's rights in the country in the past year, after protests erupted nationwide in September 2022 after the death of Mahsa Amini . Amini died on September 16 after she was arrested by Iran's Guidance Patrol, also known as the \"morality police,” for improperly covering her hair with a hijab. Although her family was informed that she had suffered a heart attack while in custody, it is widely believed she was tortured and beaten to death. A newspaper with a cover picture of Mahsa Amini, a woman who died after being arrested by the Islamic republic's ''morality police'' is seen in Tehran, Iran September 18, 2022 (credit: MAJID ASGARIPOUR/REUTERS)\nHer death sparked protests across Iran as women removed hijabs and proudly showed off their hair, while general disenchantment with the Islamic hardline regime also came to the fore. At least 15,000 people were arrested over the subsequent months, although numbers are difficult to verify, with at least 551 protesters, including 68 minors, killed, according to Iran Human Rights, a Norwegian-based NGO that focuses on human rights in Iran. A community comment on Khamenei's X post stated, \"The Iranian regime protects the dignity of women by having religious police beat and torture them to death like Mahsa Ahmini.\" Advertisement Before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought the hardliners to power, Iran was seen as a more moderate Muslim country where women were not required to dress according to Islamic law and makeup was permitted. Iran ranks poorly for women's rights\n A 2023 report by Georgetown University’s Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS) found Iran ranked 140th, out of 177 nations ranked.",

    "text": "Military Times Proud Boys, other far-right groups use Texas convoy as rallying cry Nikki Wentling February 1, 2024 at 11:59 PM · 5 min read 9 Link Copied Read full article\nOops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below\nA livestream of the “Take Our Border Back” protest convoy showed a few dozen vehicles in a Texas parking lot Thursday afternoon, where participants milled about, decrying the imprisonment of some Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol rioters and buying Donald Trump merchandize from vendors.\nJust a few hours before a planned “pep rally” Thursday, the gathering appeared much smaller than organizers first touted, comprising personal vehicles instead of the semi-trailer trucks used in promotional videos for the event. Organizers spent the first two days of the convoy dispelling confusion about routes and the intended destination, which is a town 20 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border, rather than the border itself.\nThe convoy has been the subject of mockery from late-show hosts and has battled unclear intentions, with some organizers advertising it as a peaceful assembly of prayer, while others claim they’re responding to a call from ousted Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson on X (formerly Twitter) to defend the border.\nLeaders of the convoy, who have encouraged service members and veterans to join their cause , planned the roadtrip from Virginia to Texas this week — in addition to a series of rallies in Texas, Arizona and California — in response to a standoff between the Texas government and federal authorities over border security. As of Thursday afternoon, the group had raised nearly $160,000, which organizers said would be used for gas, permits and staging equipment.\nWhile it was uncertain Thursday whether the planned events would meet the level of participation promised by organizers, the hype surrounding the movement was already proving to be a successful recruiting tool for fringe groups advocating for violence against migrants, multiple extremism experts said Thursday.\nExperts from the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, the Western States Center and Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights also warned that the attention garnered by the convoy was bringing tenets of the ”Great Replacement“ conspiracy theory into mainstream conversation.\nThe conspiracy contends that lenient immigration policies are being designed to replace the power and culture of white people in the U.S. The theory has been tied to multiple mass shootings over the past several years, including the 2022 killing of 10 people in Buffalo, New York, and a shooting in El Paso, Texas, that left 23 people dead in 2019.\n“We’ve seen the white supremacist Proud Boys group, neo-Nazi active clubs and the Aryan Freedom Network all taking advantage of the standoff to push their propaganda and recruit new members,” said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.\nIn social media posts reviewed by Military Times, various chapters of the Proud Boys in Ohio, Texas, North Carolina and Rhode Island had shared information about the convoy and encouraged its members to get involved. One post on Telegram claimed that a “confrontation was imminent” and another read, “Let’s do this grab your guns n let’s party.”\nThe Proud Boys romanticize a traditional, male-dominated version of Western culture, and the group is rooted in white nationalism and misogyny, according to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland.\nDozens of its members were defendants in criminal cases stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, and four of its leaders, three of whom have military backgrounds , were sentenced to 15 or more years in prison for their involvement in the riot.\nA livestream shows participants in a\nDespite the online calls for violence, organizers of the “Take Our Border Back” convoy insisted this week that their group would remain peaceful. In an update about the pep rally planned for Thursday night, organizers told participants to avoid bringing weapons or tactical gear. Organizers also warned of “infiltrators and provocateurs” who might be planning to disrupt their efforts but claimed they were prepared to intervene with such individuals.\nDevin Burghart, president of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights , described the convoy as a “stunt” and said he was more concerned with the long-term effects of the event, such as bringing a sense of normality to far-right ideas.\n“It may not have an impact this week, but this type of rhetoric about an ‘invasion’ and another Civil War have longer, broader implications for us as a nation,” Burghart said. “We’ve witnessed the bitter fruit of this type of rhetoric far too many times in this country. It’s time for America to stand united against such threats.”\nThe spread of the Great Replacement conspiracy theory has an effect on communities of color, argued Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of America’s Voice, which advocates for immigration reform.\n“It puts a target on people’s backs,” Cárdenas said.\nTo successfully counter the rhetoric about migrants, elected officials should publicly condemn vigilantism and pass legislation to improve the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, Burghart argued. As of Wednesday, Senate negotiators were struggling to finalize a bipartisan deal that included policy changes at the border. A key measure would allow the Department of Homeland Security to close the border if too many migrants were showing up with asylum claims. The bill faces opposition from House Republicans and Donald Trump .\nThe protest convoy arrived in Dripping Springs, Texas, on Wednesday night, where one organizer shared a photo of a small stage adorned with an “Appeal to Heaven” flag. The flag has been adopted in recent years by Christian Nationalists who see it as a rallying call to seek protection from God, rather than the government. The flag was present during the attack on the Capitol in 2021.\nOrganizers of the convoy planned to hold the pep rally Thursday night at a brewery in Dripping Springs. Next, the convoy is expected to travel on Friday morning to Quemado, where participants will hold a rally on Saturday.\nThis story was produced in partnership with Military Veterans in Journalism .

(Photo by Coral Scoles-Coburn/ University of Montana) University of Montana Athletic Director Kent Haslam was standing in the corner of the end zone during the FCS semifinal in Missoula when Corbin Walker [intercepted a pass](https://missoulian.com/sports/college/big-sky-conference/university-of-montana/montana-football-run-to-title-game-north-dakota-state/article_7f105320-5d9e-59a6-b1b1-74efc6e650f5.html) in double overtime that sealed a victory for the Montana Grizzlies. “First thing I did was look for any yellow flags on the field to make sure that it wasn’t going to be called back,” Haslam said. “And when I saw none, I probably jumped in an extremely unathletic way.” With the 31-29 victory, the Montana Grizzlies head this weekend to Frisco, Texas, for the FCS championship game for the first time since 2009. The Grizzlies previously won in 1995 and 2001. In front of a full stadium with some 20,000 fans, including at least 5,000 Griz fans, the No. 2 Grizzlies will take on last year’s national champions and the top ranked team in the FCS, [South Dakota State.](https://missoulian.com/sports/college/big-sky-conference/university-of-montana/montana-grizzlies-national-championship-south-dakota-state-comeback/article_372b03af-3550-5ba5-9143-65a204dfb83f.html) Notable UM alum J.K. Simmons has voiced a spot that will air Saturday, the day before the game, and Gov. Greg Gianforte is expected to attend the game, according to UM. With help from donors, who contributed $130,000, and with $70,000 from the UM Foundation, the Grizzly Marching Band will join the team in Texas. Haslam answered questions at UM this week about what the championship game means for Montana before he heads to Texas for the game and festivities. Here’s an adapted Q&A from the conversation: Q. What was your reaction to the semifinals win, how’d you celebrate, and are you going to Frisco? I’m definitely going to Frisco. I stayed down there on the field and went over to talk to the athletic director of North Dakota State. He’s a good friend of mine, and I’ve been on the other end of those games where you lose, and they’re not fun. A neat experience afterwards was the North Dakota State team and their coaches stayed down on the field as our fans came in to watch people interact and take pictures. I know it’s easy when you win, but it was nice. It’s a great way to celebrate an amazing football game on an unbelievable night in Missoula with two teams that are extremely good and have a lot of respect for each other. I’m not a huge celebrator, so I just went home and relaxed and started to answer the hundreds of texts that were really neat to get from colleagues and friends from all over the country. That was really fun. Q. How are reservations for Montanans to travel to Frisco? Do you think the stadium will be filled with more Grizzlies than Jackrabbits, or vice versa? The way the NCAA works is both teams get 5,000 tickets, and we sold out of ours in a couple of days. So we worked through our donor list and worked through our quarterback club donors and then our GSA (Grizzly Scholarship Association) donors and then our season ticket holders, and we didn’t ever get to the spot where just the general public could buy tickets. We limited sales to four tickets a person so that we could get as many people tickets as we could. But charters are full, the alumni charters are full. So the demand has been extremely high. The stadium seats 20,000, and it will be completely full. I would imagine it will be pretty even (between Grizzlies and Jackrabbits). Both teams have great fan bases, both are extremely passionate. It’s all going to be how aggressive the fans were on the secondary market. The NCAA takes about 10,000 tickets and puts them on sale in August. What happens is fans who think their teams will be good buy them up, and then if their team doesn’t make it, they put them out on the secondary market. Q. Did the win inspire anyone who was a skeptic of the rehire of Bobby Hauck to tell you they have changed their minds? What is the culture of the football team now? There really hasn’t been. And really, there weren’t a lot of skeptics. There certainly were some who weren’t supportive. But the vast majority of people were supportive, and I’ll tell you, working with him has been great. He is a motivator. He is a disciplinarian. He loves this place. And it seems like so long ago, with the pandemic in there and everything else. I think people have been supportive of what the coach and student athletes are doing. In the 12 years I’ve been an athletic director, college athletics has changed so dramatically, and student athletes have so much more power when it comes to transferring and leaving and abandoning their team. The unity on this team is pretty remarkable. I’m not with them every single day. I see it from the outside. But I travel with them on the road, and I’ve watched them interact. Just the way they have carried themselves — and I’d say this about all our student athletes — they’re really great young people who are forced into the limelight and handle it extremely well. Some handle it better than others. Some are more prepared for it than others. But we’ve never had higher GPAs. We’ve have success on the field. Typically, when you have high GPAs, you’re not winning many football games. But there’s been a really great connection. We’ve got young men completing masters degrees, and the graduation rates are tremendous. It takes a unique bond to win and to lose as a team. It teaches you a lot, and I’ve really been impressed with the resilience of this team and their unity. How to watch Visit [GoGriz.com](https://gogriz.com/gameday/football-vs-south-dakota-state/football/71/) for the FCS Championship Countdown to Kickoff page to see where and how to watch the game. Q. What does the exposure in getting to the FCS championship game do for Grizzlies Athletics and what does it do for the University of Montana as a whole? We know that the North Dakota State game had nearly 800,000 viewers on ESPN. You just know with that many eyeballs and the way this place looks and the way this place presents itself on TV and that stadium packed, you just find yourself connecting with people that never knew about UM. This is what Montana has to offer. Certainly, the exposure, I can’t put an exact number on it, but we’re going to be playing on national TV on ABC on Sunday, and there’s only four teams still playing football — the University of Washington, University of Montana, University of Michigan, and South Dakota State. So there’s some value in that. We have one guy working in our office now, in fundraising, and he came across Montana because he watched us play Appalachian State back in 2009 in the middle of snow. He’s from Georgia and thought, ‘That looks like a pretty cool place to come to school.’ He graduates, goes on in his career, and now he’s back here as a fundraiser in athletics. In athletics, we want to err on the side of saying, ‘Hey, this is the greatest thing ever,’ because that’s our business, and we like that. But we know there has to be ripple effects for the exposure you gain nationally. You’ve got people across the country talking about your state, about your university and about your athletic program. That’s a good thing. Q. Number crunchers and sports prognosticators have pegged the Grizzlies as [heavy underdogs](https://missoulian.com/sports/college/big-sky-conference/university-of-montana/montana-south-dakota-state-fcs-championship-frisco-texas-predictions/article_81e52a08-58a5-5875-8a7e-236d16f9a500.html) in this weekend’s game. Do you have a prediction for the outcome? I always predict that we’ll win. But certainly, South Dakota State, they are an extremely talented football team, and they’re well coached. Their athletic director is just a tremendous athletic administrator and a really great person in this business. They’re built very similar to us, so it’ll be a tall task. They’re also a rural state. They’re built with student athletes that come from that area and that grow up wanting to be a Jackrabbit, like we get young people in the state of Montana who grow up wanting to be a Grizzly. So we’re very similar in the way we look. In Montana, the governor knows what the Grizzlies and the Bobcats are doing. The governor of South Dakota knows what the Coyotes and the Jackrabbits are doing. It’s probably very different in California for example, with so many schools. But it should be a great game. I think we’re going to have to play really well to beat them, but it’s not bad to be the underdog. We’ve been the underdog a few times this year.

Q. Excuse the lack of sports lingo, but are you practicing any special tricks, like what we saw in the overtime wins? I have no idea what they’re doing, but you just talk about some magical moments in this business. It’s really hard to not get too high with the highs and not to get too low with the lows because it can turn so quickly. So I’ve learned to just enjoy when things come together, and those last two games, those two overtime wins, those were some magical moments that you don’t get very often. So you grab ‘em, and you hold onto ‘em, and you enjoy ‘em. It’s just satisfying to see people have success. Whether it’s success as a student or success in a championship, I’m happy for them. I’m happy for fans. I’m happy for the university. It’s pretty magical when it all comes together. Q. Football is the focus this week for obvious reasons, but how are things looking for basketball and other sports this year? We’ve had an amazing fall. We got the Big Sky Conference champion in our soccer program, and our volleyball team played really well, and football is going into a national championship. Both our men’s and women’s basketball teams are playing really well right now, and track and field. We have 15 sports that happen here, with about 330, 340 student athletes. Certainly at a time like this, with a national championship, you naturally are starting to focus in on football, because there’s so much that comes into that. But there’s a lot of really great things that are happening in all of our sports. We have really good coaches and people who are dedicated to Montana. You’ve got to constantly be working. You can’t get too complacent with the wins, and you can’t get too distraught with the losses. I think complacency with the wins is more dangerous than being distraught with the losses. Q. What do you want people to know while they’re watching the game this weekend? I’m just proud. I’m proud of our student athletes and how hard they work. I’m proud of our coaches. We’re not perfect, but we work really hard at representing this university, and doing it the right way, and I’m just proud to be from Montana. I’m proud to be a Grizzly and look forward to — winning or losing — just representing the state. This is a great place. This is an amazing part of the country, and our fans, they’re unlike anywhere else. And it’s a lot of fun. Economic Impact The festivities leading up to the FCS championship game have given Missoula an economic boost, although how much of it is a net positive for the state as a whole versus just Missoula was not clear. The UM Bureau of Business and Economic Research estimated the three playoff games hosted in the Garden City had an economic impact of $7.5 million in Missoula, according to [KGVO](https://newstalkkgvo.com/missoula-money-playoff-games/). In an email to the Daily Montanan, the BBER’s Pat Barkey said that number is just one of the factors that measures the economic impact of Grizzly Athletics. He also said the $7.5 million doesn’t distinguish between people who visited Missoula from out-of-state versus those who came from within Montana. UM Athletic Director Kent Haslam said reaching this level of play has direct economic impacts from the thousands of people coming to Missoula and spending money at restaurants, for example, but it also gives Missoula and Montana valuable exposure. He said the playoff games were icing on the cake for Missoula. “The great thing about those playoff games is those are bonuses,” Haslam said. “You plan on the six home football games, but then the three extra games certainly have an impact on this university. It has an impact on our athletic department. And just in watching how crowded downtown was for three straight weekends, it’s got to have an impact on that as well. The wins this season also fatten head coach Bobby Hauck’s wallet [by $58,000](https://missoulian.com/sports/college/big-sky-conference/university-of-montana/montana-grizzlies-bobby-hauck-bonuses-fcs-playoffs/article_37fd73d6-d865-586d-98ea-cb4335e86faf.html) in incentives, according to an analysis by the Missoulian’s Frank Gogola.
