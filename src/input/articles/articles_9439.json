    "text": "DELPHI — Murder suspect Richard Allen is headed back to the custody of the Carroll County sheriff. The move came in the last couple of minutes of a day that saw more than nine hours of testimony in the case. Thursday’s line of discussion — part of the third hearing this week in the case — included the state’s arguments asking the court to rule against Allen’s defense team bringing up alternative suspects in trial that might have been involved in the February 2017 deaths of Delphi teens Libby German and Abby Williams. But it was Judge Fran Gull’s decision on the defense’s motion to vacate Allen’s safekeeping order from Tuesday that perhaps made the most ripples in Thursday’s hearing. After Gull made her ruling on the defense’s motion, Defense Attorney Andrew Baldwin pumped his fist while he looked over at Allen sitting at the defense’s table. Allen’s family, who has attended every hearing in the case, was also all smiles after the ruling, as was Allen himself. It’s unclear whether Allen will now be housed at the Cass County Jail — where he’s been staying during this week’s hearings — or another local facility as he awaits his October jury trial. However, Carroll County Sheriff Tony Liggett on Tuesday did mention he has had discussions with Cass County Sheriff Ed Schroder about possibly housing Allen at his facility until the end of the trial. That ends a long length of stay for Allen in the Indiana Department of Corrections’ prison facilities. Shortly after his November 2022 arrest, Allen was housed in the Westville Correctional Facility in LaPorte County. Then, in December 2023, Allen was moved to the Wabash Valley Correctional Facility in Sullivan County. In her last-minute ruling Thursday, Gull left it up to Liggett to determine where best to place Allen, but she made it clear it won’t be back at WVCF. And while the last couple minutes provided the day’s biggest ruling, both sides in the case spent most of Thursday discussing and debating whether Allen was allegedly involved in the case at all. According to Baldwin, one of the main arguments the defense is using to make their claim about alternative suspects in the case is German’s phone, particularly her phone at 4:33 a.m. Feb. 14, 2017. That was just a few hours before the girls’ bodies were found by the Monon High Bridge area near downtown Delphi. The defense argues the prosecution has claimed the girls were killed somewhere between 2:30 and 3:30 p.m. Feb. 13, 2017. But in his testimony Thursday, Indiana State Police First Sgt. Chris Cecil stated German’s phone movement stopped at 2:32 p.m. It never moved again, Cecil testified, nor did any text messages to German’s phone come through. But then at 4:33 a.m. the next morning, the defense argued that German’s phone turned “on,” and pinged a nearby tower. More than a dozen text messages also came through to German’s phone at that time, something the defense argued was due to the phone — and possibly the girls themselves — being moved and then brought back to the area. The defense also brought back up their argument for the possible third-party involvement of Odinists in connection with the girl’s deaths, months after saying German and Williams were “ritualistically sacrificed” by members of the Nordic pagan religion. Baldwin and fellow Defense Attorney Bradley Rozzi made those claims in a 98-page memorandum filed last year, which said the girls’ bodies were “positioned,” with “runes” laid upon their bodies and in the area around them. However, the prosecution Thursday attempted to debunk that theory. Patrick Cicero of the LaPorte County Sheriff’s Office testified Thursday he is an expert in blood spatter analysis, and admitted he was not at the scene in 2017 because he wasn’t called to help investigate the case until earlier this year. But Cicero did tell the court Thursday that the crime scene, what he has seen in photos, was consistent with an alleged crime and not a ritualistic sacrifice. To help prove his theory, Cicero testified that the upside down “L” that the defense believed was an Odinist marking on a tree found near the crime scene was likely just the result of “transfer” from one of the girls during the incident. And the sticks that the defense thought were “runes” were more than likely just there to try to cover the girls up, Cicero said. Gull will now take each of the motions presented during this week’s hearings under advisement. There is currently no timetable for when rulings will occur. Allen’s month-long jury trial starts Oct. 14 with several days of jury selection. That process will take place inside the Allen County Circuit Court before moving to Carroll Circuit Court for the rest of the proceedings. According to Gull, 600 jury questionnaires were sent this week to residents of Allen County. Those questionnaires are expected to be received next week, with a deadline of Aug. 23 for them to be handed over to attorneys. It was Feb. 14, 2017, when the bodies of German and Williams were found near the Monon High Bridge area in rural Carroll County. In November 2022, Allen was arrested and charged with two counts of murder and two counts of felony murder for his alleged connection to the case.",

    "title": "Empresas ferroviárias 'aplaudem' suspensão da taxa de acesso ao Porto de Sines",
    "text": "A Associação Portuguesa das Empresas Ferroviárias (APEF) ‘aplaudiu’ hoje a suspensão da tarifa de acesso à entrada do terminal ferroviário do Porto de Sines (Setúbal) no próximo ano, confirmada hoje à agência Lusa pela autoridade portuária. Em comunicado, a APEF disse congratular-se com a decisão da Administração dos Portos de Sines e do Algarve (APS) e argumentou que a aplicação desta tarifa “iria causar distorções no mercado e discriminação negativa, sobretudo em relação a um modo de transporte mais sustentável” como o comboio. No entender da associação, a implementação desta taxa, cobrada desde o início do ano às empresas do transporte ferroviário, pela entrada de cada comboio no terminal ferroviário do Porto de Sines, penalizava os operadores ferroviários “comparativamente com os operadores rodoviários que todos os dias acedem” àquele porto. “Os operadores ferroviários nunca estiveram contra o pagamento de um valor por um serviço prestado, desde que este seja justificado e aplicado de forma equivalente ao modo rodoviário”, esclareceu a APEF, no comunicado. No entanto, assinalou, com a aplicação da tarifa, “apenas a ferrovia seria penalizada, algo que vai contra tudo aquilo que tem vindo a ser defendido pela tutela e pela Comissão Europeia”. Para Miguel Rebelo de Sousa, diretor executivo da associação, citado na mesma nota, “a aplicação desta taxa não era coerente com os objetivos estabelecidos para a descarbonização do setor e as políticas definidas pela Comissão Europeia para a intermodalidade e transição modal”. “Felizmente, o Porto de Sines decidiu não avançar com esta medida, contribuindo desta forma para a competitividade da ferrovia e do corredor logístico de Sines”, sustentou. O responsável aplaudiu ainda a decisão adotada pela autoridade portuária de restituir os valores que foram cobrados às empresas durante o ano de 2023. “Os associados da APEF foram informados que os valores que lhes foram cobrados durante o ano de 2023 serão restituídos, uma decisão muito positiva e séria por parte APS”, considerou. O Porto de Sines (Setúbal) decidiu suspender a tarifa cobrada às empresas de transporte ferroviário de mercadorias, em 2024, alegando que a medida tem impactos nas empresas importadoras e exportadoras que utilizam este corredor logístico. Contactada pela agência Lusa e numa resposta enviada por escrito, a APS explicou que na base da decisão de suspender o procedimento no próximo ano, está “a instabilidade e retração” dos mercados mundiais. Também a Autoridade da Mobilidade e dos Transportes (AMT), em comunicado, divulgou a decisão da APS de suspender o procedimento em curso e não aplicar qualquer prestação pela utilização do complexo ferroviário do Porto de Sines em 2024. Segundo a AMT, que registou de forma “muito positiva” a suspensão da medida, a APS decidiu igualmente restituir os montantes cobrados aos operadores ferroviários de mercadorias no corrente ano de 2023.",

    "text": "Boxing\nAnthony Joshua Finds New Foe: Next Big Fight Announced After Tyson Fury's Retirement\nIt is crystal clear that the envisioned biggest match in the history of boxing between Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury will never happen again following the total pullout of Fury from boxing. Amid that, Joshua has quickly been paired up with another fierce opponent which is expected to gain more ground.\nA shocking retirement from the \"Gypsy King\" some days ago is a negative signal revealing the end of his career, and particularly an end to a dream match with Joshua. Fury retired from boxing two months after his second defeat to the current heavyweight champion Aleksandr Usyk.\nSaudi Arabian adviser at the Royal Court under the rank of Minister and the current Chairman of the General Entertainment Authority, Turki Alalshikh, had Fury-Joshua on his list of fights to see in 2025 and expectations were high, but, as it happened that the match will not longer happen, Turki quickly makes a tough opponent for Joshua.\nSpeaking to TalkSport, Alalshikh revealed intentions to make Anthony Joshua vs. Deontay Wilder a reality.\n“I want to see Joshua and Wilder now,” Alalshikh said. “If Tyson is not available, why not Joshua and Wilder?\"\nJoshua and Wilder are greater fighters, and they have equally had their worst moments in the ring. In just six years, between 2019-24 Anthony Joshua lost 4 bouts in 6 matches. Moreover, Wilder has lost more matches in recent times, the first of which was against Tyson Fury in their trilogy.\nJoshua vs Wilder was one of the biggest fights of Joshua’s prime. Negotiation issues plagued this matchup when both men were undefeated, and now they are both coming off devastating knockout losses. It’s bittersweet, but the allure is still there.\nIt is doubtful if Anthony Joshua will want to see himself in the ring with Wilder. The American boxer has never been his interest. Besides, AJ needs a bigger boxer like the \"Gypsy King\" to rebuild his portfolio.\nWill AJ versus Wilder match ever happen?",

    "title": "Thousands Of Flowers With Lord Ram, PM Modi's Face For Big Ayodhya Event",
    "text": "Weeks before the inauguration of the grand Ram Temple in Ayodhya, special offerings from across India including a 108-foot incense stick, a gold bow and arrow and a 2,100kg bell made of eight metals will soon be making their way to the temple town. Among the exceptional elements that will adorn the new temple, a florist from Gujarat is offering unique flower arrangements to decorate the complex. The flowers will have Ram Lalla's name and \"Jai Shri Ram\" printed on the petals and thousands of them will be placed near the deity's idol. The florist, Ashok Bansali, claims it took him four years to develop the technology to print words and even photos on flower petals. Holding up a bunch of pink roses, Mr Bansali showed off his creation. On the outer petals are photos of PM Narendra Modi, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the words \"Ram Lalla\" and \"Atmanirbhar Bharat\". \"I was inspired by PM's call to make in India, so I researched for four years to develop this printing technology. Each flower petal is printed on manually so it takes a long time to create a bunch of these. We are also planning to print similar photos on leaves of indoor plants that will be placed in the temple complex,\" he said. In 2020, for the 'bhoomi pujan' or groundbreaking ceremony of the temple, Mr Bansali displayed 500 of his floral creations. But this time the florist aims to replicate the prints in thousands of flowers. \"We have been asked to create 8000 to 10,000 of these flowers but since each petal has to be printed on manually, we are aiming to make 3,000 to 4,000 of these to offer to Lord Ram,\" he said. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Preparations are in full swing for the mega ceremony which will be held over a span of seven days starting from January 16. Scores of workers from different parts of the country are hard at work at Ram Katha Park to meticulously put together flowers into artistic formations. The designs of these decorations are inspired by the image of Lord Ram, his bow and arrow, Lord Hanuman and religious tilak, among other patterns. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the grand ceremony in Ayodhya on January 22 and will address devotees from the man entrance to the temple.",

    "text": "Israel-Hostages\nA hard-hit Israeli kibbutz on Thursday announced the death of Judith Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza.\nThe news came six days after Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also pronounced dead.\nWeinstein, 70, and Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of Oct. 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others.\nIn the early hours of the morning, Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family.\nWeinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Haggai was killed Oct. 7 and his body was taken to Gaza.\nOn Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Weinstein was also killed on Oct. 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza.\nIt was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths.\nThe couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbut said.\nPresident Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter.\nThe families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal,” he said in a statement.\nWeinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician.\n“Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement.\nAl Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children.\nHe said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something happened to her.\nAccording to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity.\nNir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on Oct. 7, with roughly one- quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped.\nThe families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new cease-fire deal to bring home their loved-ones.\nNetanyahu met Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office.\n“I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.\nFrom news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate – The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.
