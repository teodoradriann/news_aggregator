    "text": "[](/benavente/2024/01/05/galeria-benavente-vive-magia-noche-96587880.html) [27](/benavente/2024/01/05/galeria-benavente-vive-magia-noche-96587880.html) La magia de los Reyes de Oriente ha llegado a Benavente donde cientos de personas dispuestas a lo largo del recorrido les han recibido. Alegría, magia e ilusión reunidas en torno al paso de la cabalgata que ha partido un año más desde la avenida de Maragatos. El frío no ha impedido disfrutar a los más pequeños de la visita de Sus Majestades. La cabalgata contó con la participación de varios benaventanos que se sumaron a la fiesta con sus bailes y habilidades especiales. De modo que salieron a la calle los alumnos de la Escuela de Baile Encarna Dueñas y de Artes Escénicas María José ambientando a su paso las principales calles céntricas de la ciudad. Volvieron los niños y niñas del Ritmica Benavente a recorrer las calles mostrando lo aprendido este curso, mientras que un pasacalles de juguetes ilusionó a los niños a su paso. Los más esperados, los Reyes Magos lucieron sus mejores galas en sus particulares carrozas, y no faltaron los pajes acompañándoles en su misión en Benavente. El recorrido fue transcurriendo por la ciudad y en Santa María fue uno de los lugares más concurridos y también donde algunas familias tuvieron menos cuidado a la hora de lanzarse a por los caramelos sin tener en cuenta la cercanía de las carrozas. Ya en la Plaza Mayor, el momento culminante de esta cabalgata, la ofrenda de Sus Majestades al Niño Jesús que en esta ocasión se realizó sobre un escenario. La alcaldesa de Benavente, Beatriz Asensio Boyano, entregó las llaves de la ciudad a sus Majestades los Reyes Magos con un gesto simbólico con el que la ciudad se entrega a la magia de esta noche tan especial para los niños.",

    "text": "Azizah Awang Dollah. Photo by Bernama MAKKAH - Armed with little strength that she can muster, septuagenarian Azizah Awang Dollah is enthusiastic to perform the haj pilgrimage this year, after declining the offer four times for various reasons. Azizah, 73, a retiree of the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) from Kelantan, who is now in the Holy Land without a companion, said that performing the haj pilgrimage alone does not dampen her spirit to become a Duyufurrahman (guest of Allah) for this year’s haj season. &quot;This is the fifth time I received an offer to perform a hajj pilgrimage. When I received the call for the fifth time, I thought to myself that I had to go because Allah had called me, so I had to be brave. &quot;The first time I had to decline the offer because I fell and fractured my leg; the second and third times were due to Covid-19; while the fourth time was because I changed my phone number, causing the Lembaga Tabung Haji (TH) unable to contact me,” she told media personnel when met at the Abraj Al Janadriyah Hotel here recently. Despite having to use a wheelchair when performing umrah recently, Azizah, who has a 40-year-old child and two grandchildren, is confident of being able to perform the hajj well and is equipped with the knowledge gained from the hajj course she attends when accepting the offer. Azizah, who also served the Youth and Sports Ministry and the Education Ministry, said she started saving in a TH account when she was 29. &quot;My first saving was only RM10 a month and then it went up a little bit to RM20, but over time as I have had a little money, I added more, from time to time. &quot;Anyone wanting to perform haj should make a salary deduction every month, otherwise it will be difficult to consistently save,” said Azizah who was accommodated at Maktab 77. Sharing the secret to staying healthy, Azizah, who has gastritis problems, said she looked after her diet, including avoiding fatty, spicy and oily foods. &quot;I prefer vegetable soup and cook using olive oil. In addition, I also take ‘habbatus sauda’ (Nigella sativa or black cumin), since a young age,” said Azizah who avoids eating ‘budu’ (tangy sauce made from fermented anchovies and spices) and reduces sugar intake. - BERNAMA",

    "title": "Once again AT&T and Verizon find themselves far behind T-Mobile's 5G infrastructure",
    "text": "Once again AT&T and Verizon find themselves far behind T-Mobile's 5G infrastructure\n5G Standalone (SA) networks are built from the get-go with 5G in mind. Non-standalone 5G networks are built with a 4G LTE core and add 5G radio access capabilities on top of the existing 4G network. 5G networks are faster, have lower latency, and are more efficient and reliable than non-SA 5G networks. In the U.S., only two carriers currently have a 5G SA network and\nT-Mobileis one of them. You might be surprised to learn that the other U.S. carrier with an 5G SA network is DISH Network.\nAccording to Dell'Oro Group, 61 network operators in 34 countries have been using 5G SA networks since 2020. The research director at Dell'Oro, Dave Bolan, says that besides the U.S., countries using 5G SA include China, India, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Japan, Spain, and the U.K. This information doesn't include fixed wireless access networks or 5G private networks.\nBolan says that he expects a dozen more 5G SA networks to launch in 2025 including ones belonging to\nAT&Tand Verizon. Another source, Ericsson's November 2024 Mobility Reportforecast that the number of 5G SA mobile subscriptions will reach 3.6 billion at the end of 2030 which would triple the 1.2 billion subscribers using 5G SA networks at the end of last year. By 2030, 60% of 5G subscriptions will be using 5G SA Networks according to Ericsson.\nSome of you might be surprised to hear that Verizon and\nAT&Thave yet to use a nationwide 5G SA network. That's because last year, if you had asked either carrier if they use the dedicated 5G network, they would reply in the affirmative even though it was used only in a few states. Verizon, for example, said that it had launched its 5G SA network when asked last year even though it later told Fierce Wireless that the network was running in only three states at the time.\nDell'Oro's Bolan says that there is no set definition for network operators to meet to declare that their 5G SA service is nationwide. He says, \"But generally speaking, we add MNOs that have deployed 5G SA networks across a broad geographic portion of their network, addressing major population centers.\" In other words, having your 5G SA network working in only three states doesn't count as offering it nationwide.\n\"Most MNOs start with their major urban centers and then extend coverage to surrounding communities and eventually to rural communities. Coverage is usually focused on outdoor and, later on, indoor coverage while also addressing venues like transportation hubs and sports/entertainment venues. No 5G SA network has matched the coverage of their 4G networks, but obviously, the ones that started first are farther along.\"-Dave Bolan, research director, Dell'Oro Group\nIt might come as no surprise that the first carrier to deploy a Standalone 5G network was\nT-Mobilewhich launched a 5G SA network on its 600MHz band in the U.S. That band happens to deliver the carrier's nationwide 5G service. T-Mobile has since added 5G SA coverage for its 2.5GHz band. Still, Bolan says that no carrier yet has been able to match their 4G coverage with a 5G SA network.\nJust like Verizon and AT&T had to play catch up in a hurry\nto match T-Mobile's brilliant use of mid-band spectrumfor its 5G buildout, it seems that the pair will have to do it again to catch up to T-Mobile when it comes to building a nationwide SA 5G network.\nThank you for sharing your feedback with us!\nLoading Comments...\nCOMMENT\nAll comments need to comply with ourCommunity Guidelines\nPhonearena comments rules\nA discussion is a place, where people can voice their opinion, no matter if it is positive, neutral or negative.

    "text": "Sesión adversa para el Nifty 50, que acabó la jornada del viernes 29 de diciembre con leves caídas del 0,22%, hasta los 21.731,40 puntos. El Nifty 50 llegó a un máximo de 21.770,30 puntos y un volumen mínimo de 21.676,90 puntos. El rango de cotización para el Nifty 50 entre su punto más alto y el más bajo (máximo-mínimo) durante este día se situó en el 0,43%.\n[Te puede interesar: BSE Sensex 30 cerró con alza este 26 de diciembre](/noticias/2023/12/26/bse-sensex-30-cerro-con-alza-este-26-de-diciembre/)\nEn relación a la última semana, el Nifty 50 anota una subida del 2,24%, de manera que en términos interanuales mantiene aún un ascenso del 19,88%. El Nifty 50 se sitúa un 0,22% por debajo de su máximo del presente año (21.778,70 puntos) y un 28,25% por encima de su valoración mínima en lo que va de año (16.945,05 puntos).\n¿Qué es un índice bursátil y para qué sirve?\n[Te puede interesar: Nifty 50 este 27 de diciembre: mercado de la India ganó terreno tras el cierre de operaciones](/noticias/2023/12/27/nifty-50-este-27-de-diciembre-mercado-de-la-india-gano-terreno-tras-el-cierre-de-operaciones/)\nUn índice bursátil es un indicador que muestra cómo se modifica el precio de un conjunto de activos determinado, por lo que se sirve de datos de diversas compañías o sectores de un fragmento del mercado.\nEstos indicadores son usados principalmente por las bolsas de valores de diversas naciones y cada uno de ellos pueden integrarse por firmas con requisitos concretos como podría ser disponer de una capitalización bursátil similar o pertenecer a al mismo tipo de industria, también, hay algunos índices que sólo consideran un puño de acciones para determinar su valor u otras que consideran cientos de acciones.\n[Te puede interesar: Cierre Nifty 50: mercado de la India cerró operaciones ganando terreno este 26 de diciembre](/noticias/2023/12/26/cierre-nifty-50-mercado-de-la-india-cerro-operaciones-ganando-terreno-este-26-de-diciembre/)\nLos índices bursátiles sirven como indicador de la confianza en el mercado de valores, la confianza empresarial, la salud de la economía nacional y global y el rendimiento de las inversiones en acciones y participaciones de una compañía. Generalmente, si los inversionistas no tienen confianza, los costos de las acciones tienden a caer.\nAsimismo, funcionan para medir el rendimiento de un gestor de activos y permiten a los inversores poder comparar entre la rentabilidad y el riesgo; medir las oportunidades de un activo financiero o crear carteras.\nEste tipo de indicadores comenzaron a utilizarse a finales del siglo XIX luego de que el periodista Charles H. Dow. viera con detenimiento cómo las acciones de las empresas tendían a subir o bajar juntas de precio, por lo que creó dos índices: uno que contenía a las 20 compañías ferroviarias más importantes (pues era la industria más importante de la época), así como 12 acciones de otros tipos de negocios\nHoy en día en la humanidad existen diversos índices y pueden juntarse en función de su localización, los sectores, el tamaño de las compañías o el tipo de activo, por ejemplo, el índice estadounidense del Nasdaq está compuesto por las 100 mayores compañías en gran medida relacionadas a la tecnologías como Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOG), Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), PayPal (PYPL), Comcast (CMCSA), Adobe (ADBE).\n¿Cómo se mide un índice bursátil?\nCada índice bursátil posee su propia forma de calcularse, pero el principal factor es la capitalización bursátil de cada firma que lo integra. Este se obtiene al multiplicar el valor del día de la acción en la bolsa correspondiente por el total de participaciones que están en el mercado.\nLas empresas que cotizan en la bolsa están obligadas a presentar un balance de su composición. Dicho informe debe notificarse cada tres o seis meses, según sea el caso.\nLeer un índice bursátil también implica prestar atención sus alteraciones en el tiempo. Los índices actuales siempre dan inicio con un valor fijo basado en los precios de las acciones en su fecha de inicio, pero no todos siguen este método. Por ende, puede confundir.\nSi un índice ve un incremento de 500 puntos en un día, mientras que otro solo adiciona 20, podría parecer que el primero tuvo un rendimiento mejor. Sin embargo, si el primero comenzó el día en 30.000 puntos y el otro en 300, se puede deducir que, en términos porcentuales, las ganancias para el segundo fueron más importantes.\nEstos son los principales índices bursátiles\nEntre los principales índices bursátiles en la Unión Americana está el Dow Jones Industrial Average, mejor conocido como Dow Jones, compuesto por 30 compañías. Asimismo, el S&P 500, que contempla a 500 de las mayores empresas de la Bolsa de Nueva York. Finalmente, no hay que olvidar el Nasdaq 100, que une a 100 de las mayores firmas no financieras.\nPor otro lado, los índices más importantes de Europa son el Eurostoxx 50, que abarca las 50 empresas más importantes de la eurozona. Además, el DAX 30, principal índice alemán que contiene a las compañías más descollantes de la Bolsa de Fráncfort; la FTSE 100 de la Bolsa de Londres; el CAC 40 de la Bolsa de París; y el IBEX 35, de la bolsa española.\nEn el continente asiático, los principales índices bursátiles son el Nikkei 225, compuesto por las 225 empresas más importantes de la bolsa de valores de Tokio. Asimismo, el SSE Composite Index, que puede considerarse el preponderante de China, conformado por las compañías más relevantes de la Bolsa de Shanghái. El mismo papel que interpretan el Hang Seung Index en Hong Kong y el KOSPI en Corea del Sur.\nEn lo que respecta a Latinoamérica, se tiene el IPC, que contiene a las 35 firmas más sobresalientes de la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV). Al menos un tercio de ellas pertenecen al capital del magnate Carlos Slim.\nOtro es el Bovespa, compuesto por las 50 empresas más importantes de la bolsa de Sao Paulo; el Merval de Argentina; el IPSA de Chile; el MSCI COLCAP de Colombia; el IBC de Caracas, conformado por 6 compañías de Venezuela.\nDe igual manera, existen otro tipo de índices bursátiles globales como el MSCI Latin America, que incluye las 137 empresas más importantes de Brasil, Chile, Colombia, México y Perú.\nDe igual forma, está el MSCI World, que incluye a 1600 compañías de 23 países desarrollados; el MSCI Emerging Markets, compuesto por más de 800 empresas de países en desarrollo; y el S&P Global 100, conformado por las 100 firmas multinacionales más poderosas de todo el planeta.\nÚltimas Noticias\n[El nuevo mandatario nacional continuaría con anuncios importantes a lo largo del primer mes de gestión](/politica/2023/12/29/las-medidas-del-gobierno-de-milei-en-vivo-todas-las-noticias-minuto-a-minuto/)\nLas medidas del Gobierno de Milei en vivo: todas las noticias minuto a minuto\n[La cotización libre se mantuvo en los $1.000 para la venta mientras que el Banco Central hizo su mayor compra de divisas de la era Milei](/economia/2023/12/29/dolar-hoy-en-vivo-a-cuanto-abre-este-viernes-29-de-diciembre-y-cual-es-el-precio-minuto-a-minuto/)\nDólar hoy en vivo: a cuánto abre este viernes 29 de diciembre y cuál es el precio minuto a minuto\n[El nuevo cuadro tarifario que rige a partir de este viernes contempla un aumento del 49 por ciento.

    "text": "Mumbai, Dec 29 K nown for his works in the shows like 'Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah', actor Mohammed Saud Mansuri, is excited to be the part of the upcoming mythological show, 'Shrimad Ramayan', and has opened up on his character Shravana Kumar. nown for his works in the shows like 'Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah', actor Mohammed Saud Mansuri, is excited to be the part of the upcoming mythological show, 'Shrimad Ramayan', and has opened up on his character Shravana Kumar. Actor Sujay Reu will portray Lord Ram, Prachi Bansal will be seen as Goddess Sita, Nikitin Dheer as Raavan, Nirbhay Wadhwa as Hanuman and Basant Bhatt as Lakshman. A divine emotion, Lord Ram is considered to be the embodiment of chivalry and virtue. This mythological saga promises to transport Indian families to an ancient spiritual era that highlights wholesome values and life learnings relevant even today. He said: \"Earlier I essayed Lord Rama's younger version in the show, 'Jai Jai Jai Bajrang Bali'. This will be my second mythological show. I'm excited now to play another important part of Shravana Kumar.\" \"He's very popular and is best known for his filial piety towards his parents. He was son of Shantanu and Gyanvanti (Malaya), and were hermits. As his both parents were blind. When they became aged, Shravana wanted to take them to the four most sacred places of Hindu pilgrimage to purify the soul. Since Shravana Kumara could not afford the transport, he decided to put each parent in a basket and tie each basket to the end of a bamboo pole, which he would carry on his shoulder while on their pilgrimage,\" said the 'Kumkum Bhagya' fame. Explaining the importance of his role in Ramayana, Saud shared that though this is a cameo it has major significance in the story. \"Though my role doesn't see the light of many episodes, it is very much important in the story of Ramayana. There is a special narrative about the life of Shravana, as the then-Prince Dasharatha killed him accidentally.\" Meanwhile, Saud has also featured in popular Bollywood movies like 'Azhar', 'Golmaal Again', among others. ‘Shrimad Ramayan’ is slated to launch on January 1, and will air on Sony.

El acto de homenaje estuvo presidido por el teniente general y director general de Reclutamiento y Enseñanza Militar, Pedro José García Cifo, que es el paracaidista más antiguo en servicio activo. En el acto también intervino el coronel director de la Escuela Méndez Parada, Alberto José Lens Blanco, quien pasó revista a los paracaidistas y saludó a las autoridades e invitados civiles, políticos y militares que acudieron al homenaje.\nUno de los nombres propios de la jornada fue el cabo primero Francisco Vico López. Recibió un reconocimiento por su labor como paracaidista y fue distinguido por su dedicación y excelente trayectoria profesional tras protagonizar más de 12.200 lanzamientos. La cita contó, igualmente, con un desfile terrestre donde las fuerzas participantes mostraron sus capacidades y equipamientos. Asimismo, los aviones modelo T-12B del 721 Escuadrón de la Escuela Méndez Parada protagonizaron un desfile aéreo, que también incluyó un salto masivo en el que participaron 81 paracaidistas de la Escuela Militar de Paracaidismo, el Escuadrón de Zapadores Paracaidistas y el Escuadrón de Apoyo al Despliegue Aéreo.
