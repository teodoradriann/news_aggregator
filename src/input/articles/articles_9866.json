    "text": "ESTATS UNITS Biden: “Sóc el candidat més qualificat per guanyar i per governar” El líder demòcrata es reivindica en roda de premsa davant els dubtes i les crides a abandonar la cursa presidencial En un acte durant la cimera de l’OTAN va presentar Zelenski com a “president Putin” Desafiant davant d’aquells que posen en dubte la seva capacitat per continuar competint en la cursa presidencial, Joe Biden ha aprofitat la roda de premsa prevista al final de la cimera de l’OTAN, dijous a la tarda (aquesta matinada a Catalunya), per reivindicar-se com a candidat. Ho ha fet just després que, en un acte previ en el marc de la cimera aliada, cedís la paraula al president ucraïnès, Volodímir Zelenski, presentant-lo com a “president Putin”, un error que va corregir sobre la marxa justificant-lo per la seva determinació a derrotar el líder rus. Totes les mirades estaven posades sobre la roda de premsa i la capacitat del president de sortir airós del tràngol, després de la seva pobra intervenció en el debat que va mantenir amb Trump el mes passat. A les preguntes dels periodistes insistint en els dubtes que genera la seva idoneïtat per continuar en el càrrec i optar a la reelecció, el president es va definir com el candidat “més qualificat per guanyar i per governar”. “He d’acabar la feina”, va justificar una i altra vegada la seva determinació a no tirar la tovallola, mentre exhibia el seu balanç en el creixement de l’economia nord-americana i la reducció de la inflació, i a Ucraïna. “Jo no me n’aniré d’Ucraïna”, va proclamar en contraposició al seu predecessor i rival a les eleccions, Donald Trump, que “no està compromès amb l’OTAN”. Per acabar de dissipar rumors, Biden es va esforçar a demostrar, durant l’hora que va durar la roda de premsa, que està en forma i es va estendre en explicacions sobre Rússia i Ucraïna i defensant la seva iniciativa de pau a Gaza i la importància de dissenyar “l’endemà” de la guerra.

    "title": "Late Menopause Associated with Greater Asthma Risk",
    "text": "Canadian study reveals that women who undergo early menopause are less at risk for asthma than women who experience menopause late.\nWomen who have menopause late have a 30% greater risk of developing asthma when compared to women who have menopause early, according to a study [published](https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/fulltext/9900/the_association_between_age_at_natural_menopause.387.aspx) recently in Menopause.\nResults are based on 10 years of follow up data from more than 14,000 women between ages 45 to 85, gathered using the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). Research was completed by a team of researchers consisting of Durmalouk Kesibi, MA, Michael Rotondi, Ph.D., Heather Edgell, Ph.D., and Hala Tamim, Ph.D. all from the School of Kinesiology and Health Science, York University in Toronto.\nWomen are considered to have entered menopause when they have gone at least 12 months without a menstrual period, caused when the ovaries stop functioning. This leads to a drop in sex hormones progesterone and estrogen. The average age of menopause is 51, but it’s considered early menopause when it occurs between ages 40 and 44.\nPrevious studies have shown there may be a relationship between asthma and sex hormones. One study reported that women on hormone therapy have a [63%](https://thorax.bmj.com/content/61/1/34.short) increased asthma risk and women who stopped therapy were twice as likely to quit asthma treatment.\nThis latest finding is significant because early menopause has traditionally been linked to a range of long-term health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.\nAsthma affects more than 300 million people worldwide and is more common in boys.\nHowever, adult asthma is more common, more severe and therefore more difficult to treat in women.\nAsthma is also associated with a high economic burden. In the United States in [2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38961618/), the estimated total annualized medical costs of asthma were $21 billion and incremental costs totaled $3.8 billion.\n“This study highlights sex-based differences in asthma, with women at a greater risk for asthma than men in adulthood,”Stephanie Faubion, M.D., MBA, medical director for The Menopause Society said in a [news release](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1063058). “Clinicians should be aware of this link and should monitor women with later age at natural menopause for asthma symptoms.”\nThe CLSA is of a 20-year study launched in 2010 to get a better understanding of the physiological, biological and social changes associated with aging. The full CLSA study contains data from 51,338 men and women.",

    "text": "The ladies (we are using the term loosely) of 'The View' were really spiraling today. Clearly, they have real concerns about Kamala Harris losing this election. It's almost hilarious to watch them. Whoopi rages at Trump and proclaims that he's not allowed to talk about Democratic election interference. — Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) Sunny Hostin whines that Kamala is supposedly being held to a \"different standard.\"[pic.twitter.com/K1Pfv4OlU9][October 24, 2024] It started with complaining people are being mean to Kamala. Give us a break. Hostin is still suggesting that Trump will launch all of America's nukes is he becomes president again:\"...people are holding her to this different standard, because you have a maniac on the other side...\" — Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) Despite Kamala being the border czar, Hostin says she's not responsible.[pic.twitter.com/klqKMrtMy8][October 24, 2024] Sunny and Whoopi were in a tight race for most unhinged today. Sunny thinks Trump is going to nuke us at all. She obviously forgets he was President for four years and didn't nuke us that time. Despite trump appearing at 2 debates, Joy Behar falsely claims Trump \"doesn't show up for anything.\" — Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) She also says, \"He'd have to work on being sane, you know, because he seems insane.\"[pic.twitter.com/v6NeznrD5f][October 24, 2024] Crazy Joy thinks Trump isn't showing up anywhere. Apparently, she is mad he isn't doing more outdoor rallies where her side can attempt to shoot him. The View claims \"it's very important\" for Kamala speak in her rambling circular style of repeating herself because \"Statistically you have to hear things three times to remember them.\" — Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) They also claim Kamala has only been around and in the race for \"20 minutes.\"[pic.twitter.com/jvkmFO0EnJ][October 24, 2024] Oh, she means to do that? They should tell her to stop. It's annoying. \"We're in trouble.\" — Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) Whoopi (who claimed the Holocaust wasn't about race) RAGES at undecided voters, suggesting their stupid: \" If you don't know what you're doing now, I don't know what else to tell you. I don't know what else to tell you.\"[pic.twitter.com/HTfeFwRoci][October 24, 2024] This is actually the root of the issue. They are worried Democrats might not be in charge.

That's what you are up against. Stop with the fence already! I'm sick of it!
