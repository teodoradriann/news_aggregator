    "text": "ALBANY, Ga. (WALB) - An influx of business property crimes is causing the Albany Police Department (APD) to call on business owners to band together for preventative measures. So far in 2024, there have been 21 different Albany businesses burglarized.\nJust Wednesday, the Dollar General located on Radium Springs Road was hit by a smash-a-grab. The suspect, who hasn’t been arrested yet, only took chips and drinks and left behind significant damage.\nThe suspect broke into the store and took chips and drinks. (walb) “I’m just so devastated this happened to this store,” said Bertha Thomas, a customer.\nIt’s a bigger devastation for business owners who are stuck with the repairs.\n“It takes two-three minutes to break the door, but it takes months to fix it and a few thousand dollars,” said Sudha Patel, owner of Quick Buys Food Stores.\nShe said they have been hit two times within the past three months. According to Albany police, in 2023, there were 102 burglaries and 30 robberies.\nLt. Jon Segroves, supervisor of the Albany police property crime unit, said they are hoping resources like the FUSUS system will help this year’s crime trend. But he said business owners can also take preventative measures.\n“It’s just very detrimental to the businesses to have to keep putting up with this type of activity and criminal behavior,” Segroves said. “There’s nothing that’s going to prevent all of this from happening, but what you can do is you can lessen the damage to your business as much as possible by making what’s left out not desirable to the public so that they don’t come in.”\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction?

    "text": "[Air Marakanda, Uzbekistan](/news/air-marakanda%2C-uzbekistan/) 28 Dec, 2023, 21:11 GMT [] SAMARKAND, Uzbekistan, Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Air Marakanda, the management company operating Samarkand International Airport, today announced a doubling of passenger traffic for the year, compared with 495,000 passengers in 2022, and welcomed its one millionth passenger. The milestone not only represents the booming tourism appeal of Uzbekistan's second city, but also highlights the successful growth strategy being pursued by the company. The record-breaking passenger was Tajikistan resident Mr. Dilshod Rakhimov, who flew to Abu Dhabi on Wizz Air flight 5W7164. To celebrate the event, Dmitry Martynenko, Air Marakanda's Commercial Director, presented the millionth passenger with souvenirs and a voucher for the airport's VIP lounge. Wizz Air also congratulated the passenger and presented him with a voucher covering the cost of a flight to Abu Dhabi. Anton Khojayan, CEO of Air Marakanda, said: \"Serving our first millionth passenger has capped off a landmark year for our company. We opened new destinations in cooperation with partner airlines, increased the frequency of flights of existing air carriers, and developed Samarkand's airport infrastructure - all of which led us to the cherished figure of one million. We are especially pleased today to congratulate a record-breaking passenger and end the year with a celebration. We are eager to push our growth trajectory even higher, and I am confident that next year we will achieve even better results.\" Air Marakanda opened the airport's architecturally stunning new terminal less than two years ago, after becoming the first private participant in a public/private partnership in aviation in Uzbekistan. Johan Eidhagen, Managing Director of Wizz Air Abu Dhabi, said: \"We are delighted to celebrate one year of operations to Samarkand and our contribution in supporting the airport to reach the significant milestone of one million passengers. Wizz Air has introduced a new era of ultra-low-cost travel to the market, unlocked affordable travel opportunities, and carried more than 100,000 passengers to and from Samarkand. This stands as a testimonial on how we can stimulate more demand through our model by making travel accessible for everyone.\" He added, \"We are looking forward to doubling our numbers in 2024 by carrying the flag of ultra-low-cost travel into the region and stimulating more demand by unlocking affordable travel opportunities for both residents and visitors of Samarkand.\" The millionth passenger milestone coincides with Samarkand International Airport being ranked among the top 5 largest airports in Europe in terms of passenger traffic growth, according to the European branch of the International Airports Council (ACI Europe). According to results tabulated as of October, Samarkand airport took 4th place in the category of regional and small airports. About Air Marakanda Air Marakanda is responsible for ground handling and management of the new Samarkand International Airport terminal. It is the first project in the aviation industry of the Republic of Uzbekistan based on public-private partnership.

(WFFT) – According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we are experiencing one of the worst flu seasons yet.\nIn Indiana alone there have been close to 100 deaths from the virus this flu season.\nCDC numbers are reflecting a rise in flu cases that tops previous flu seasons within the past decade.\nThere's an almost 3% rise in deaths from the flu just this week.\nMore than 50,000 people were admitted to hospitals with flu this week alone.\nExecutive Director of Super Shot Connie Heflin says a lack of flu vaccines puts everyone at risk.\n“When we get a flu shot individually, it not only protects ourselves, but it also protects everybody else around us. It really makes our community healthier,” Heflin said.\nHeflin also says the flu has the highest impact on young children 6 months and older, older patients and pregnant women as their immune system is weakened.\nShe recommends everyone six months and older should get their annual flu shot.\nTo encourage more people to get their vaccination, Super Shot is offering flu shots at no cost.\n“We don't want people to not get their flu shot and protect their health because they're worried about cost. We accept all insurance forms here at Super Shot,” Heflin said, “If you don't have insurance that's where there's usually a cost and at Super Shot, we ask for a $15 administration fee per vaccine, but if you can't pay that $15 admin fee, there's no problem,”\nThey also have a community flu challenge underway; Heflin says their goal is 150,000 people vaccinated, right now there are close to 100,000.\nTo schedule an appointment, click here.",

    "text": "Empresarios aseguran que revivir artículos de la laboral por decretos vulnera la democracia Los empresarios agremiados en Aliadas expresaron su rechazó a la idea que tiene el Gobierno Nacional de revivir algunos aspectos de la reforma laboral que se hundieron a través de decretos. Luego de conocerse que el Gobierno, a través del Ministerio del Trabajo, tendría listos varios decretos con los que espera revivir algunos artículos que se hundieron en la reforma laboral, algunos sectores han mostrado su apoyo a la idea y otros han mostrado su desacuerdo. En esta oportunidad, desde la Alianza de Asociaciones y Gremios (Aliadas) se expuso el pensamiento de algunos de los empresarios más importantes del país que se encuentran agrupados allí, los cuáles mostraron su rechazó con la idea del Gobierno al asegurar que “vulnera los principios de la democracia por parte del Gobierno Nacional al pretender expedir decretos en materia laboral, algunos de los cuales serían inconstitucionales”. De igual forma, Aliadas se sumó al análisis de algunos sectores del país, los cuales han manifestado que generar decretos para modificar las condiciones del mercado laboral nacional no es elocuente frente a la reforma laboral que se planteó desde el mismo Gobierno Nacional y que aún se mantiene en debate. Puede leer: El gremio empresarial agregó “resulta absolutamente contradictorio y poco democrático que el Gobierno Nacional haya presentado al Congreso su proyecto de reforma laboral para la próxima legislatura, habiendo acordado un texto en el cual se excluyeron los temas que ahora se pretenden regular usando facultades reglamentarias que el ejecutivo claramente no tiene”. Para los empresarios, uno de los temas que más genera preocupación es el que tiene que ver con los derechos colectivos entre los que se encuentran negociación, asociación y huelga y que desde luego se hundieron con la laboral, pero que serían tenidos en cuenta entre los decretos que prepara el Gobierno Nacional; para los empresarios no tener en cuenta el debate que se ha dado en el Congreso de la República podría tener impactos negativos para el sector, por lo que recomendaron finalmente “abrir espacios tales como la Comisión Constitucional de Concertación de Políticas Salariales y Laborales, para la discusión, análisis y concertación de la reforma laboral que, se reitera, debe ser tramitada por el Congreso de la República. Igualmente, importante es honrar los acuerdos que se adelantaron en la Comisión Séptima de la Cámara de Representantes sobre los contenidos del proyecto para la próxima legislatura”.",

    "text": "La militante Annie-Ève Collin a appris sur les réseaux sociaux qu’elle était bannie des boutiques Diabolik, des magasins de vêtements alternatifs. La raison évoquée était très claire: elle a osé porter un T-shirt sur lequel était écrit «J’aime J.K. Rowling». Rappelons que l’auteure d’Harry Potter a été accusée d’avoir tenu des propos contre la communauté trans. Au micro de Sophie Durocher, à QUB, Mme Collin a expliqué avoir magasiné aux deux boutiques Diabolik le 25 mai dernier. Selon elle, tout s’est très bien déroulé, et jamais un employé ne lui a parlé de ce qu’elle portait. Ce n’est que plusieurs jours plus tard qu’on l’a avisé que la boutique avait annoncé son bannissement dans une publication sur les réseaux sociaux. «Ce qui est odieux, c’est qu’on n’a jamais communiqué avec moi pour me dire que je dérangeais», a mentionné Mme Collin. Cette fameuse publication était accompagnée d’un avertissement au sujet de contenu transphobe. On pouvait alors voir une photographie de Mme Collin portant le fameux T-shirt. QUB a communiqué avec les boutiques Diabolik pour avoir leur version des faits. «Elle venait juste pour déranger et mégenrer le monde», a souligné une employée de la boutique. Des affirmations vivement contestées par Annie-Ève Collin. «C’est une boutique alternative, le tutoiement est plutôt de rigueur, s’est défendu la militante. Quelqu’un qui s’identifie comme non binaire, ce n’est pas écrit dans son front.» Pour Sophie Durocher, cette affaire est un bel exemple de la culture d’annulation et des limites que cela peut poser dans une société.",

    "text": "ND DOCR receives grant funding for residents to pursue more secondary education opportunities BISMARCK, N.D. (KFYR) - When people get out of prison it can be difficult to fit in. A new grant could help. The 2024 Second Chance Act Grant on Improving Reentry Education will help people pursue a secondary education while incarcerated. Future students will take online courses through state colleges and universities including BSC and Valley City State University. Residents will be able to earn online degrees or certifications while incarcerated. Staff said education helps people who are incarcerated stay out of prison. “What we have seen on a national standard is that inmates that receive a four-year degree or at least a two-year degree, their recidivism rate drops dramatically, and they’re more desirable for employment,” said Charlie Hedden, grants manager. The North Dakota Department of Corrections (ND DOCR) has been working to expand post-secondary options. “So previous to that, residents could participate in college. However, they would be paying for the full tuition and fees all on their own. When you’re incarcerated, I mean, many people do work, but the wages of the jobs here are not what the wages are in the community,” said Michelle Pfaff, director of education. She said the grant money will go towards the equipment needed to complete the degrees. This three-year federal grant will make education more accessible. “And so, we are establishing the relationships now because this is just the beginning of the possibilities of what we can do. Once we have the technology infrastructure in place, we can branch out to other locations across the state that want to participate,” said Hedden. Already, one student is enrolled in classes through Valley City State University. ND DOCR staff said the program was pushed forward when federal Pell Grant funds became accessible for individuals who are incarcerated. Copyright 2024 KFYR. All rights reserved.",
