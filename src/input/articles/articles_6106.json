    "text": "Sì al centro islamico. I giudici bocciano il Comune\nIl Tar di Milano ha annullato il secondo rigetto della domanda di permesso di costruire per luogo di culto, e accolto il ricorso di Assalam. Riconoscendo che anche il Comune di Cantù “deve consentire l’esercizio della libertà di culto laddove siano rispettate le norme di legge, a cominciare dalla Costituzione”, e regolamentari, come si verifica per Assalam. La notizia giunge dagli avvocati Mario Lavatelli, Vincenzo Latorraca e Michela Luraghi, che da tempo seguono la controversa vicenda. “Dall’accurata motivazione della sentenza – spiegano – emerge l’assoluta rilevanza del diritto di culto, sancito dalla Costituzione, la necessità di luoghi dedicati, come chiarito in più occasioni dalla Consulta, nonché il dovere dell’Amministrazione di condurre un’adeguata istruttoria con adozione di provvedimenti motivati, non essendo mai ammissibile che la discrezionalità sfoci nell’arbitrio”. Così, proseguono, “dopo un lungo e impegnativo iter giudiziario, finalmente Assalam ha ottenuto il rispetto dei propri diritti e interessi legittimi”. Il Tribunale ha infatti ritenuto illegittime “tutte le ragioni addotte dall’amministrazione a fondamento del diniego”. In particolare, in riferimento alla pretesa mancanza di corrispondenza tra lo stato di fatto rappresentato negli elaborati allegati all’istanza, e lo stato di fatto esistente, il Tar ha evidenziato che è onere del responsabile del procedimento “accertare d’ufficio i fatti e di attivare il soccorso istruttorio per consentire all’istante di rettificare dichiarazioni o istanze erronee e incomplete”. Il Comune, come si legge in sentenza, ha “violato questa disposizione”. Chiarisce ancora il Collegio che, dovendo pronunciarsi su un’istanza presentata nel 2014, l’Amministrazione “avrebbe dovuto attivarsi e, ove avesse ritenuto insufficienti le planimetrie allegate alla Dia del 5.10.2016 e della Scia del 10.5.2017, presentate dall’Associazione nel corso del procedimento, a seguito della comunicazione del preavviso di rigetto, avrebbe dovuto richiedere rettifiche al progetto o integrazioni alla documentazione presentata”. Il Tar ha infine condannato il Comune alla corresponsione delle spese di lite.\nPaolo Verri",

    "text": "People still finding ways to enjoy winter despite back-to-back storms and lack of snow The Hard'ack Recreation Area in St. Albans is drawing people from across the country this winter The Hard'ack Recreation Area in St. Albans is drawing people from across the country this winter The Hard'ack Recreation Area in St. Albans is drawing people from across the country this winter Despite being hit with back-to-back storms, people are still finding ways to make the most of this winter, snow or no snow. One of the places drawing people from all across the country, and even Canada, this winter is Hard'ack Recreation Area in St. Albans. \"This place is a gem, by the way. This whole recreational complex – it’s unbelievable,\" said Andy Crossman, a nearby resident of the complex. Crossman's grandsons love sledding down the hill and swimming in the indoor pool at Hard'ack, but Crossman appreciates the rec center for a more niche activity – perfect for the conditions this winter has brought so far: mountain biking. Crossman described the sport as \"a little bit opposite what good-skiing weather is for fat-tire riding.\" He helps groom the trails part of the 95 acres of the complex, so he and the 80 other members of his mountain biking club are able to enjoy the trail network even when it snows. \"When you’re going through the woods, it’s a sensation like floating. Typically, we’ll go in the evening and wear headlamps. It’s a really fun kind of social activity,\" Crossman said. Though the sport isn’t for everyone, and skiing down the hill is out of the picture for now, people can also consider Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing — and the list goes on. Lee Barrett, the recreation program manager, explained why so many people are attracted to the complex, regardless of inclement weather. \"There’s so much to do, and even just getting out, people just love that stuff and being on the property. There are people that come here every day and don’t partake in necessarily the quote-on-quote traditional winter stuff,\" Barrett said. Understandably, word of everything Hard’ack has to offer has spread outside of Franklin County. \"I've always kind of said that this is becoming a rec destination. It always has been a destination for the local folks, but we’re seeing folks coming from out of state and across the state of Vermont,\" Barrett said. Part of the complex’s appeal is the indoor pool. It was only built last year, but it has brought even more activities under the dome. \"We offer public swim times, which is just anyone is welcome to come and swim at the pool. And we have a ton of organized programs: swim lessons, fitness programs for adults, we offer pool parties here, a winter swim team,\" said the aquatics director, Issac Bashaw. Folks as passionate as Crossman is about Hard’ack could attest to what all its offerings have brought to the community. \"It’s an incredible asset to our area, and not only just for fun, but it’s part of what’s called recreation economy,\" Crossman said. If mountain biking sounds like something you might want to take up, Crossman and his group are inviting people to try it out with them to help kick off the Winter Carnival next month.",

Until the Palestinians are safe, the middle east is not safe. Until the middle east is safe, the world is not safe,” Sabry said. Reiterating that non-alignment is the cornerstone of Sri Lanka’s foreign policy, Sabry said that “contemporary global crises had brought the fragilities of the world to the forefront and that this has magnified the relevance of the Movement, as never before” according to a [Foreign Ministry statement](https://mfa.gov.lk/fmsl-addresses-meeting-fm-nam/). On the sidelines of the meeting, Sabry held bilateral discussions with the Foreign Ministers of Uganda – Odongo Jeje Abubakher, Pakistan – Jalil Abbas Jilani and Algeria – Ahmed Attaf. Sri Lanka was a founding member of the Movement and hosted the 5th NAM Summit of Heads of State and Government in 1976. The NAM consists of 120 member states is based on the Bandung Principles. Uganda assumed the Chairmanship of the 19th Summit of the Heads of State and Government. (Colombo/Jan19/2024)",

    "text": "В Крыму подготовят пакет мер по национализации активов украинских олигархов\n- 19 июня 2025 07:16\n-\nНаиль Каримов\nКрым планирует подготовить очередной пакет мероприятий, направленных на национализацию активов украинских олигархов и политиков, проявляющих враждебность к России. Об этом рассказал глава крымского парламента Владимир Константинов на Петербургском международном экономическом форуме, передает РИА Новости.\nКонстантинов подтвердил, что работа по выявлению и национализации таких активов продолжается, отметив, что новые решения в этой области находятся в стадии подготовки.\nС осени 2022 года крымский парламент принял ряд постановлений, касающихся национализации имущества, принадлежащего украинским политикам и олигархам, связанным со сложившимся киевским режимом и демонстрирующим враждебные действия по отношению к России. Этой работой активно занимается антитеррористическая комиссия.\nСергей Аксенов, лидер Крыма, указал, что вырученные от продажи национализированного имущества средства будут направлены, в частности, на поддержку участников специальной военной операции и строительство социально-значимых объектов. Среди активов, прошедших процедуру национализации и реализованных на аукционах, значится квартира семьи Владимира Зеленского, расположенная в поселке Ливадия.\nКрым стал частью Российской Федерации в марте 2014 года на основании проведенного референдума, состоявшегося после политических изменений на Украине. По итогам голосования, 96,77% избирателей в Крыму и 95,6% в Севастополе поддержали присоединение к России. Несмотря на это, Украина и ряд западных государств продолжают считать Крым временно оккупированной территорией. В свою очередь, руководство России неоднократно подчеркивало, что возвращение Крыма состоялось в полном соответствии с международными нормами и Уставом ООН, а президент Владимир Путин заявил, что вопрос Крыма окончательно закрыт.\n-\nТелеграм -\nДзен - Подписывайтесь на наши каналы и первыми узнавайте о главных новостях и важнейших событиях дня.",
