    "text": "La pugna legal por los cigarrillos electrónicos, también conocidos como vapeadores, confrontó nuevamente a Movimiento Regeneración Nacional (Morena) con la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación (SCJN), pues la procedencia de un amparo enconó un decreto federal con un particular que podría seguir comercializando con este producto. Todo inició cuando el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), el 31 de mayo de 2022, promulgó en el Diario Oficial de la Federación (DOF) el decreto por el cual se prohibe la circulación y comercialización de los cigarrillos electrónicos y dispositivos vaporizadores con usos similares (Sistemas Electrónicos de Administración de Nicotina, Sistemas Similares sin Nicotina, Sistemas Alternativos de Consumo de Nicotina), así como los aceites, soluciones y mezclas que aerolizan.

Este recurso fue turnado al ministro Javier Laynez Potisek para determinar su procedencia, la cual fue concedida al considerar que esa cuestión ya fue revisada por el Primer Tribunal Colegiado en Materias Penal y Administrativa del Decimoctavo Circuito. Después, el 6 de diciembre, se discutió dicha determinación en la Segunda Sala y, con tres votos a favor y dos en contra, los ministros avalaron el proyecto de resolución y coincidieron en que se vulnera el derecho de Gastronómica Teopanzolco S.A. de C.V. (propietaria de “La Cabrería Grill Pizza”) al acceso del libre comercio. El argumento que motivó la resolución fue mal recibido por Morena en el Senado de la República, pues Lilia Valdez, presidenta de la Comisión de Salud, reprochó que la SCJN mide la libertad en función de lo comercial y no de la salud humana, “el derecho que se tiene de comercializar lo que sea”, señaló. Te recomendamos: [El PAN acudirá a la SCJN si el ‘Recorte a la Corte’ viola la Constitución](https://www.publimetro.com.mx/nacional/2023/10/10/pan-acudira-a-la-corte-si-el-recorte-de-morena-al-poder-judicial-atenta-contra-derechos-laborales/) Por ello, hizo un llamado al Poder Judicial a que prioricen la salud y la economía de la salud de la mayoría y “no en la economía de 10 personas”. “¿Justicia es proteger a quien enferma a todo un país?, ¿eso es justicia?, pues yo no soy experta en Derecho, pero pues eso no es justicia”, reclamó. Cabe recordar que la procedencia del amparo no es una resolución final en este tema; simplemente abre la puerta a una discusión más profunda, pero mientras se resuelve, La Cabrería Grill Pizza podrá seguir comercializando legalmente cigarrillos electrónicos y sus desechables (filtros, aceites, baterías, etc.). Este desencuentro se suma a otras tensiones entre la Cuarta Transformación (4T) con el Poder Judicial, como la extinción de 13 fideicomisos por más de 15 mil millones de pesos o el amago de promover una reforma judicial para, entre otras cosas, cambiar la estructura de la Corte y la Judicatura Federal.",

    "title": "Good Life for Grand Island campaign kicks off 'yes' vote push",
    "text": "The Good Life for Grand Island campaign kicked off with a press conference at the Veteran’s Sports Complex on Thursday. The campaign encourages voters to vote “for” the passage of a proposed economic development program related to the city’s newly approved Good Life District in the special election on Aug. 13. “Today starts a historic process that can improve Grand Island and build Grand Island for decades to come,” Mayor Roger Steele said. “You vote yes for the economic development program and your children and your grandchildren and future generations of Grand Islanders will have reason to thank you and look back upon you for your foresight, for your ability to see a better future for all of us.” A Good Life District was introduced as a part of the Good Life Transformational Projects Act, under Nebraska Legislative Bill 692, in early 2023. The act reduces Nebraska’s sales tax from 5.5% to 2.75% in the district for 30 years. A year later the legislature added to the program to allow districts to use local sales and occupancy taxes to invest in the area, if approved by voters. People are also reading… Woodsonia Real Estate, developers behind the Conestoga Marketplace, applied for a Good Life District in Grand Island last year. The Nebraska Department of Economic Development approved their application in June. Tonja Brown, treasurer for the Good Life For Grand Island political committee, said that this was the third district approved and, “There's only five of these allowed across the state.” The district will be in the northeast area of town, at the intersection of Capital Avenue and Webb Road to the intersection of Highway 281 and Broadwell Avenue. Included in the district will be the Veterans Sports Complex and the Conestoga Marketplace. According to Mayor Steele, the boundaries for the district could be expanded by 3,000 acres in the future. The district will go into effect on Oct. 1. However, the community will need to vote on the Good Life Economic Development Program to decide what to do with the extra money. According to [the campaign website](https://www.growgrandisland.com/goodlife), voting for the program means that voters will approve replacing the 2.75% of state sales tax with 2.75% in local sales taxes in the district. “Think about what the state is doing to invest locally,” Brown said. “I don't remember them ever stepping up like this in the past, this is absolutely amazing, it's an incredible investment by the state.” Several projects are already planned for the district; an indoor/outdoor sports complex, a commercial/business park, several housing units and enhancements to Eagle Scout Lake. If the program isn’t approved, the sales tax will still be reduced in the district. According to Brown, if the program isn’t approved then the future plans will be stalled, with everyone having to come up with a \"plan B.\" “And if those things aren't met, highly likely, this could get pulled away from us,” Brown said. “So we can say we have a Good Life District right now, but without having a program, a solid program, that makes it happen, I don't think we'll have it in the long haul.” During the press conference, Steele asked voters to vote yes, so that the money can be controlled locally, rather than going to Lincoln. “The state is giving us a chance to capture sales tax that they are giving up,” Steele said. “But to capture that sales tax, you need to vote 'yes.'” Steele also emphasized that he would like the district to eventually expand down South Locust Street to include Fonner Park. According to Steele, the expansion would not only help to develop Fonner Park to have bigger livestock shows, but help create more job opportunities and attract families and younger folks to Grand Island. “Nebraska has a problem with young people leaving our state,” Steele said. “I want to give young people a reason to stay, I want them to know that we build great opportunities for them; great jobs, great recreational opportunities, but I need your yes vote.” Diane Rouzee, the sports marketing manager for GI Tourism, also spoke in support of the program. “We need this,” Rouzee said. “We've needed this for a long time, and I wish that I would have had this 30 years ago.” With the money earned in the program, Rouzee believes the sports complex development will be good for the community, as it will not only bring more competitions to town, but people of all ages will be able to enjoy it. “I am so so excited,” Rouzee said. “I have so much passion for this town, and for sports and I think that if you can do this, you'll see amazing things happen for Grand Island.” Several of the speakers thanked Sen. Raymond Aguilar for helping to get a Good Life District in Grand Island. “I think Grand Island sold that itself,” Aguilar said. “With the numerous organizations that we have here, that are continuously working on economic development projects, you know, they could see that we were set up for this.” For the special election, registered voters in Grand Island city limits will receive a ballot in the mail. Ballots will be sent later in July, with voters either mailing in or dropping them off at the Hall County Election Commissioner’s office. All ballots must be received by 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 13. Brown suggested all mail-in ballots be sent by Aug. 6, to account for any complications. In order for the program to be approved, the majority of ballots have to be “for” the program. There is not a minimum amount of votes required. “I need your vote,” Steele said. “I ask you to tell all your friends, all your neighbors, all your relatives who live in Grand Island to vote yes for the Good Life District Development Program.”",

    "text": "A bridge for wildlife could help get grizzlies off the endangered list AILSA CHANG, HOST: Every year in America, the federal government says about 200 people die in car crashes with wildlife, and tens of thousands more are injured. This year, a lot of money - hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars - is being spent to reduce the carnage and save not just people's lives, but animals' lives, too, including some endangered species. Montana Public Radio's John Hooks reports. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC) JOHN HOOKS, BYLINE: This two-lane stretch of U.S. Highway 93 on the Flathead Indian Reservation is notorious for car crashes with wildlife. KYLIE PAUL: Like, I saw a tiny black bear cub dead on the side of the road on the - on 93 this weekend. And I saw so many dead deer. HOOKS: Kylie Paul is a road ecologist with the Center for Large Landscape Conservation. PAUL: And this traffic creates this moving fence that just completely blocks their ability to live their daily lives, to make their ancient migratory pathways. HOOKS: So Paul is pretty excited that there's now more money than ever to build wildlife crossing structures. Basically, bridges over or tunnels under highways in places like this. PAUL: They can be 100% effective with underpasses, overpasses and fencing. And it gets drivers in a safe place, and it gets animals able to move under and over the road and live on their daily lives. HOOKS: This is particularly important for grizzly bears, which have been on the endangered species list since 1975. A federal court says they can't be taken off that list until isolated populations reconnect and start breeding. That means grizzlies from here in Northern Montana need to be able to get together with grizzlies down near Yellowstone National Park, and they have to cross a lot of roads to get there. WHISPER CAMEL-MEANS: They can't all just live here like it's a refuge. HOOKS: Whisper Camel-Means leads the Wildlife Division for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. CAMEL-MEANS: They need to be able to disperse. So if we can just allow them to naturally move... HOOKS: The bipartisan infrastructure law passed in 2021 allocates $350 million to build wildlife crossing structures nationwide, including $8 million for this one on Highway 93, where a fifth of all grizzly bears killed by cars in Montana die. Most wildlife crossings funded by the first round of infrastructure bill money are in Western states. But road ecologist Kylie Paul says there are about half a dozen in the Midwest, Southern and Eastern states. PAUL: Where there's quite an amazing array of amphibians and other smaller animals that we might not think of human safety, there's huge issues with their populations, with their ability to not get completely annihilated on their migratory pathways that they take, you know, seasonally to mate. HOOKS: The U.S. Department of Transportation is currently accepting applications for the second round of funding for wildlife crossing structures. The final third of funding is to be awarded in 2026. Paul would like to see the funding made permanent. PAUL: And as long as we have vehicles and roads, we're going to have problems. So we need to keep putting up these solutions. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC) HOOKS: Back on Highway 93 on the Flathead Reservation in Montana, the tribes here are partnering with the state and are in the early design phase for the new overpass aimed at saving grizzly bears. They're hoping to start construction next year. For NPR News, I'm John Hooks, near Ronan, Mont. (SOUNDBITE OF MAREN MORRIS SONG, \"GIRL\") Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.
