    "text": "‘A lot of oil flows through the Red Sea in that area,’ a UN spokesman tells the Sun. ‘It’s home to an amazing biodiversity, which is at risk, and there’s a physical risk, obviously, to the seafarers.’ After a lull, the Houthis of Yemen are amping up attacks on shipping at one of the world’s busiest commercial lanes, adding marine life to the growing list of their victims. A Greek-flagged oil carrier, the MV Sounion, was hit Wednesday near Yemen’s shores by four rockets. A French crew evacuated the 29 crew members. As the tanker is now adrift, laden with 150,000 tonnes of crude oil, it “represents a navigational and environmental hazard,” a European Union group, known as Aspides, writes on X. “It just highlights the multifaceted risk that continues to rise as ships are continuing to be targeted by Houthis in the region,” a United Nations spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, tells the Sun. “A lot of oil flows through the Red Sea in that area. It’s home to an amazing biodiversity, which is at risk, and there’s a physical risk, obviously, to the seafarers.” The Houthis launched their campaign to disrupt Red Sea shipping back in November, declaring their goal was to disrupt Israel’s economy and aid Hamas after its October 7 terrorist attack. In December, the U.S. Navy launched Operation Prosperity Guardian, meant to protect shipping. The Houthi attacks, though, now block more than 70 percent of traffic in the Red Sea, over which 20 percent of world commerce travels. The commercial interests of more than 70 countries have been hit as hard as, or worse than, Israel’s. A sizable portion of Egypt’s economy, for one, is based on Suez Canal traffic, which is currently mostly paralyzed. Its Red Sea shores are a magnet for scuba divers who are amazed at the corals, rare fish, and uniquely clear water — all of which now stands to be polluted by a leaking oil tanker. Major shipping companies are now sailing around Africa, instead of attempting the Red Sea. The rerouting is adding to shipping costs and stoking global inflation. A fanatic Islamist group, the Houthis have yet to even take over the entirety of Yemen, one of the world’s most impoverished countries. Yet they now pose a major risk to global freedom of navigation. America, which possesses the world’s most powerful military — and which for centuries has built the world’s strongest Navy with the specific goal of guaranteeing that freedom — is yet to find a solution to the Red Sea conundrum. On August 20, after the Houthis hit a home near the American consulate at Tel Aviv and killed one person, the Israeli air force conducted one of its farthest-flung missions, hitting oil installations at the Yemeni port of Hodeidah. The port was set ablaze and was burning for days. Since then, Red Sea attacks had mostly subsided; now, they have renewed. Following the hit on the Sounion, a British force in the Red Sea had to scare off attack boats on Thursday. The daring Israeli Hodeiodah operation “wasn’t meant to end the Houthis’ military capabilities,” a Mideast watcher at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Yoni Ben Menachem, says. Rather, the goal was to “hit their economic capabilities, paralyze activity at the port, and disrupt Iran’s arms deliveries.” Such operations are “not one and off, it’s a long, protracted battle,” the Israeli UN ambassador, Danny Danon, tells the Sun. “But you need to look at who is initiating all of this, and that’s Iran. For now, we are battling the proxies, but we need to concentrate on Iran.” America, meanwhile, has mostly stayed on Red Sea defense, sporadically hitting Houthi targets. On Thursday it “successfully destroyed an Iranian-backed Houthi surface-to-air missile and radar system in a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen,” the U.S. Central Command said in a statement posted on X. Instead, America needs to attack not just “missiles, radars, and supply depots,” a military affairs watcher at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Brad Bowman, says, but should aim at “a broader set of military targets,” including Iranian ones. Yet, Washington habitually has been risk-averse — and even more so in an election year. Since October 7, President Biden has constantly warned against Mideast “escalation,” and specifically cautioned against any direct confrontation with Iran. The Pentagon has gathered an impressive coalition in Operation Prosperity Guardian, Mr. Bowman says, but the Biden administration’s top priority is to avoid a wider regional war. Yet, he adds, “anyone who spends any time on a playground knows that if you keep telling the bully, ‘I don’t want to fight,’ that’s the best way to get another punch in the face.”",

    "text": "Papa Francis (Photo by Alberto PIZZOLI / AFP)\nEl papa Francisco, hospitalizado desde hace siete días por una infección de las vías respiratorias y una neumonía bilateral, es un papa “necesario”, asegura el arzobispo Vicenzo Paglia, presidente de la Pontificia Academia para la Vida, que advierte sobre los “cuervos” que especulan sobre su salud.\n“ Tengo noticias positivas. Espero que el papa pueda recuperarse pronto porque se le necesita. Es necesario que pueda reanudar plenamente su vida de pastor de la Iglesia, que en este momento es más que preciosa “, afirma Paglia este jueves en el diario ‘Repubblica’.\nEl pontífice, de 88 años, multiplicó sus actividades con el Jubileo en las semanas anteriores a su ingreso en el Gemelli de Roma, pero, asegura Paglia, “ así es el papa Francisco. Ciertamente uno de los problemas de su salud es el descuido que a veces manifiesta hacia ella. Y quizás debería haber más diligencia por parte de todos para protegerlo “.\nSegún la última comunicación del Vaticano, este jueves, el papa ha pasado una noche tranquila y esta mañana se ha levantado y ha desayunado en el sillón, en su séptima jornada en el hospital Gemelli de Roma, después de la “ligera mejoría” experimentada en las últimas horas, siempre dentro de un cuadro clínico “complejo”.\nEl arzobispo se muestra “contento” de que Francisco no haya perdido en el hospital su sentido del humor, como aseguró este miércoles tras visitarle la primera ministra italiana, Giorgia Meloni, “porque no faltan cuervos, y saber que el papa también sigue bromeando me parece una noticia útil para todos”.\nPreguntado sobre si cuando habla de cuervos se refiere a las ‘fake news’ que circulan sobre el empeoramiento del papa, Paglia responde: “Sí, y no sólo eso. Miremos este momento con mayor positividad”.\nY sobre la posible vuelta de Francisco al Vaticano, asegura: “ Imagino que no tendrá que esperar mucho. Y espero que tanto él como todos nosotros seamos mucho más cuidadosos a la hora de moderar, digamos, sus excesos de compromiso. Todos sabemos hasta qué punto el contacto directo con la gente es realmente la vida para él “.\nEl pontífice fue hospitalizado el pasado viernes por sus problemas de respiración, que resultaron ser una bronquitis por infección polimicrobiológica, a la que sumó una neumonía bilateral que requiere terapia farmacológica adicional.

BYD completed the plant in Rayong in just 16 months, with an annual production capacity of 150,000 vehicles. The facility encompasses processes of stamping, painting, welding, final assembly, and producing car components. It is projected to generate 10,000 jobs.
