    "text": "World War II Veteran celebrates his 99th birthday GAINESVILLE, Fla. (WCJB) - Jesse McDonald was born in Gainesville on Dec. 27,1924. Over the weekend, his family held a surprise party for him. Jesse McDonald joined the army when he was 16 and served in World War II. His family says he used to tell them all about being at Pearl Harbor and other war experiences. His son Dennis spoke for him during the party. “There were a family of nine of us. My father worked three jobs at one time, but he made sure we did not miss a meal,” Dennis McDonald shared. After the war, he came back to Gainesville in 1958 after he finished being stationed in Georgia. “Back in his time, it was hard for people of color so you had to try to make wise and good decision that would take you into your future,” Dennis McDonald said. He worked at First National Bank for around 30 years, but was a custodian for his first 15 years there. After that, he worked his way up to a higher role of working in the vault, and transporting checks from various banks in Gainesville over to the Federal Reserve building in Jacksonville. “We were very disciplined, if we did something wrong we paid the price for it. From those whippings that we got it taught us and it took us further down the road,” Dennis McDonald shared. Dennis McDonald says his father is the one who inspired him to join the Air Force where he served four and a half years. Jesse McDonald retired in his late 60s and loved to sing including singing in several church groups. He says he’s learned a lot over his 99 years but the major concepts he has always kept in mind are- “Honesty, loving people, try to surround yourself with good people. Be in a good environment,” Dennis McDonald shared. While celebrating his 99th birthday he says that 99 years is not enough and he’s going for 105.

    "text": "Micaela Burrow\nDaily Caller News Foundation\nThe U.S. military took out more than a dozen Houthi drones, a drone operations site and anti-ship missile in four separate incidents in less than 24 hours, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in statements.\nAt 1:30 a.m. on Thursday, U.S. forces\ncarried out airstrikes on a Houthi drone control station in Yemen and 10 more suicide drones in “self-defense,” CENTCOM said. On Thursday, CENTCOM forces shot down one airborne drone at 5:00 a.m., then at 10:30 a.m. engaged waterborne drone that heading toward international shipping lanes with multiple strikes, resulting in explosions, CENTCOM https://twitter.com/CENTCOM/status/1753129271420502417.\nGet\n“U.S. forces identified the [unmanned aerial vehicle] ground control station and one-way attack UAVs in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and determined they presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and U.S. Navy ships in the region,” the statement read.\n“U.S. forces subsequently struck and destroyed the UAV ground control station and 10 one-way attack UAVs in self-defense. This action will protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for U.S. Navy vessels and merchant vessels,” it added.\nEarlier, U.S.S. Carney guided-missile destroyer shot down an anti-ship ballistic missile the Houthi terrorist group launched into the surrounding waters at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday before destroying three Iranian attack drones less than an hour later.\nNo damage or injuries were reported, CENTCOM said.\nThe U.S.S. Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier and several U.S. destroyers are\noperating in the Red Sea to protect merchant vessels from incessant Houthi missile and drone attacks, which have occurred since Nov. 19.\nU.S. and United Kingdom forces\nconducted two major operations to destroy Houthi missile and drone launch and radar capabilities on Jan. 11 and Jan. 22, while the U.S. has also executed dynamic self-defense strikes against missiles or drones prepared to launch.\nEarlier on Wednesday, U.S. aircraft\nstruck a surface-to-air missile the Iran-backed rebels had poised to launch at U.S. aircraft, presenting an “imminent threat,” the military said in a statement. Both the U.S. Navy and Air Force have aircraft https://twitter.com/ChowdahHill/status/1751046291444859048 in the region.\nIn a Tuesday night incident, a Houthi cruise missile came within one mile of the destroyer U.S.S. Gravely, representing the closest call so far, CNN\nreported, citing four U.S. officials. Previous missile interceptions conducted by U.S. destroyers took place at a range of eight miles or more, the officials said.\nAs of Tuesday, the Houthis have attacked or threatened international and commercial shipping and naval vessels at least 36 times since Nov. 19, Pentagon deputy spokesperson Sabrina Singh said in an email to reporters on Tuesday. The last confirmed Houthi attack on a merchant or naval vessel was on Jan. 27, she said.\nAs of Thursday, however, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Organization\nhttps://twitter.com/UK_MTO/status/1753023218862969304 it received reports of another attack near the Yemeni port in Al Hudaydah. The vessel and crew were not harmed, but an explosion was recorded a distance away from the ship in a suspected attempt to hit the vessel.\nThis story originally was published by\nthe Daily Caller News Foundation.\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

    "text": "Waynesboro looks to acquire private land to extend South River Greenway\nWAYNESBORO, Va. (WHSV) - The City of Waynesboro is working to acquire private land required to connect the South River Greenway with a nearby park, but the effort has run into complications for the city.\nThe Waynesboro City Council discussed the path forward to acquiring the land needed to expand the South River Greenway from 2nd Street to Basic Park during its Monday meeting. At the meeting, a public hearing was held to discuss a resolution authorizing and directing the use of condemnation for Greenway Phase 4.\nWhile no one gave public comment, City Manager Michael Hamp read a briefing discussing attempted negotiations with the property owner, which has been unsuccessful, as the city and property owner have not come to an agreement on compensation for the transfer.\n“The city has obtained an appraisal of easements that yielded a fair market value of $4,100 and has attempted to negotiate easements with Mr. Collins. These negotiations were unsuccessful,” Hamp said at the meeting.\nWHSV reached out to the city via email for an interview, and Hamp replied, “Because this matter is scheduled to be resolved through litigation, our legal counsel has advised that the city representatives not discuss the matter.”\nCopyright 2025 WHSV.

Rosenberg seems to think so too.\n“I thought, ‘I wonder what the sample is that Kanye needs to try to clear before Friday’. We all know Kanye notoriously is late with handling album stuff. I just wonder whether there was something getting held up. And someone said, ‘Hey, this sample does not get cleared if he does not issue an apology.’ Like you guys said, he just goes on chat GPT and boom we get a quote apology,” said the Hot97 host.\nHe continued, “No part of me believes this apology. I totally agree by the way that the Hebrew part was like so, either intentionally or unintentionally, offensive. As if, like, American Jews can just read Hebrew without vowels. Like, bro, it’s just another offensive thing here.”\nYe is getting ready to drop his new album Vultures.\nTags ·\nkanye west· Peter Rosenberg",

    "title": "First Cannabis Union Contract Ratified In CT: 'Huge Milestone For Industry'",
    "text": "Workers at a marijuana manufacturer in Connecticut have made history by voting to ratify the first union cannabis contract in the state. On Thursday night, Dec. 28, workers at Advanced Grow Labs in the New Haven County city of West Haven voted unanimously to ratify their union contract, according to a United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 919 spokesperson. The contract is the first such cannabis union agreement in the history of Connecticut and includes guaranteed wage increases of up to 25 percent over three years, increased holiday pay, secured retirement and health insurance, increased safety measures, and on-the-job protection. The ratification comes months after workers at AGL formed the union in March 2023, becoming the first cannabis workers in Connecticut to do so. Workers at Advanced Grow Labs in West Haven voted to ratify their union contract with UFCW Local 919. “I am proud to be a part of the first cannabis union in Connecticut,” said AGL Production Technician Alanna Daniels, who continued, \"This has been a huge milestone for the industry in the state and our company. I hope other workers can come together like we have.” AGL Harvest Technician Christopher Mckenzie called the agreement \"groundbreaking.\" “We have a voice at work now and a better future coming now that we have a union contract,\" Mckenzie added. The UFCW, which represents tens of thousands of cannabis workers across the US in dispensaries, labs, delivery, kitchens, manufacturing, processing, grow facilities, and more, is the country's largest cannabis workers union. Any other cannabis workers interested in forming a union at their workplace can call UFCW Local 919 Director of Organizing Emily Sabo at 203-915-4561.",
