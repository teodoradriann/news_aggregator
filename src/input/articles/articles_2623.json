    "text": "- Lake Jackson Aquatic Preserve will host a community clean up Saturday, February 17th, joined by REI Co-Op, Friends of Lake Jackson, and Leon County Commissioner Rick Minor. - This effort is to address trash in the area and will build on local efforts by these organizations. - Watch the video to find out how you can get involved and why it's necessary. BROADCAST TRANSCRIPT: Rallying a community clean up, picking up trash, to pick up the preservation of Lake Jackson. Digging into why organizations want neighbors to get involved. A lake creating community in Leon County, uniting nature and people, including fishermen like Ben H Boynton, who has been here, catching fish for 40 years. \"It was so much fun, to be a young boy raised on here,\" said Boynton, reminisicing on his experiences at Lake Jackson. Now 67, Boynton said he takes extra care of the lake when he visits daily; to honor the community that's served him. He's encouraging everyone else to do the same. \"Oh I hope we just try a little bit forever,\" said Boynton. That's a habit that Friends of Lake Jackson, Lake Jackson Aquatic Preserve, REI Co-Op, and Commissioner Rick Minor have been advocating for. They're pushing this message with an upcoming community clean up. \"A good, obvious way, to do something, span a couple of hours and get results,\" said Sophie Wacongne-Speer with Friends of Lake Jackson, explaining the initiative. Wacongne-Speer said clean ups are regular thanks to the Lake Jackson Aquatic Preserve. In a email, they said \"staff and volunteers have removed over 640 pounds of debris from both Lake Jackson and Carr Lake since the start of 2024. Last year, over 1,300 pounds of debris was removed from across the nine public landings.\" Wacongne-Speer said the collection of trash is crucial as it affects wildlife here. \"Plastic maybe one of the worst problems they encounter,\" said Wacongne-Speer. She is encouraging neighbors to join them this weekend while they collect trash. Wacongne-Speer said it will also be an educative opportunity. \"Doing something useful, brings you satisfaction,\" said Wacongne-Speer. Commissioner Minor said community clean ups play a role in honoring Leon County's strategic plan. He said a big part of that is environmental stewardship. \"Taking good care of our water bodies, as well as our parks and green spaces is important to us,\" said Minor. Minor hopes neighbors will join them in this effort. For Boynton, he's motivated by his memories, and hopes you'll join him. \"I don't want to see a place like this trashed,\" said Boynton. So we can build a lake, community, and environment that lasts. Neighbors can join organizers on Saturday February 17th from 10am for the next community clean up. They ask you bring bug spray, hat, sunscreen, and a reusable water bottle. Lunch will be provided for all volunteers.

Following the rise in footfalls, the number of ornaments and cash offered to the temple by the devotees have also seen a significant rise. The recent hundi collection that recorded Rs 3.56 crore cash offered to the temple is considered the highest amount recorded in the temple history. The hundi collection was netted for the past 28 days. On an average, the Devasthanam received an income of Rs 12.28 lakh a day in May. Apart from cash, gold ornaments weighing 142.100 gm, and silver ornaments weighing 28.440 kg were offered by the devotees during the period. The hundi count exercise at the temple was carried out for two days on Tuesday and Wednesday under the supervision of the temple executive officer S Srinivasa Murthy and endowments department inspector V Vasanth Kumar. While the collection of 15 hundis was counted on day-one, the rest was counted the following day. Earlier, the hundi of Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Devasthanam temple netted an income of Rs 1.32 crore in last April.

El padre de la artista colombiana fue ingresado el 6 de junio en la clínica Iberoamérica, que ha permanecido hermética en estas semanas sobre la salud de Mebarak, de 92 años. Aunque ni la clínica Iberoamérica, centro asistencial en donde está el padre de Shakira ni voceros oficiales de la artista se han pronunciado al respecto, diferentes medios de la ciudad informaron que la razón por la cual el escritor y comerciante de origen libanés debió ser hospitalizado es una neumonía. También han sido medios como El Tiempo y Caracol Radio los que aseguran ahora que Mebarak ya está en su residencia, después de haber pasado por la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos (UCI). William Mebarak Chadid, quien fue el primer representante de Shakira cuando la cantante era apenas una adolescente, es un estadounidense nacido en Nueva York y de origen libanés, que emigró con su familia a Colombia a los cinco años.",
