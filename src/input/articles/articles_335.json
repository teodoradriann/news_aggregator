I calcoli del Servizio sui cambiamenti climatici presso il Centro europeo per le previsioni meteorologiche\ndi Redazione|Aggiornato il 10/01/2025\nIl mondo ha subito un aumento della temperatura media di oltre 1,5 C rispetto all'era preindustriale nel corso del 2024, ha annunciato il Servizio Copernicus sui cambiamenti climatici presso il Centro europeo per le previsioni meteorologiche a medio raggio (ECMWF). Il surriscaldamento, senza precedenti nella recente storia umana, ha colpito anche gli oceani: la media annuale delle loro temperature superficiali, escluse le aree polari, ha raggiunto un livello \"record\", ha dichiarato il servizio europeo di monitoraggio del clima.\nL'anno scorso la temperatura media dell'aria in superficie è stata di 15,10 C, ovvero 0,72 C in più rispetto alla temperatura media tra il 1991 e il 2020 e 0,12 C in più rispetto al 2023, il precedente anno più caldo registrato, che risale al 1850, ha dichiarato l'istituzione con sede a Bonn, in Germania. Si tratta di un aumento di 1,60 C rispetto alla temperatura stimata tra il 1850 e il 1900, considerato il periodo preindustriale. \"L'umanità e' padrona del suo destino, ma la nostra risposta alla sfida climatica deve essere basata su prove. Il futuro e' nelle nostre mani; un'azione rapida e decisa può ancora cambiare la traiettoria del nostro clima futuro\", ha sottolineato Carlo Buontempo, direttore del Servizio Copernicus. La temperatura media mensile ha superato i livelli preindustriali di 1,5 C per undici mesi all'anno e, andando più indietro, tutti i mesi dal luglio 2023, ad eccezione del luglio 2024, hanno superato questa soglia. Inoltre, tutti i mesi da gennaio a giugno sono stati più caldi dello stesso mese di qualsiasi anno precedente e tutti i mesi da luglio a dicembre sono stati i secondi più caldi di qualsiasi anno precedente.",

She has dedicated her research to finding treatments for binge eating and bulimia syndromes. Her passion is evident through her involvement in [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.fsu.edu/) Professor Lisa Eckel’s neuroscience lab, where she examines how semaglutide (Ozempic) affects binge eating.\nGuard is also an Ignite Fellow with Teach for America and helps elementary and middle school students with math and reading. She focuses on targeting weaknesses and boosting students’ confidence, finding satisfaction in their academic growth and excitement for learning.\nGuard hopes her research and dedication to education will inspire other undergraduates to start their own research. Her goal is to provide academic resources for underprivileged students and ensure they have access to educational opportunities in the future.\nWhat made FSU stand out to you when you were applying to colleges?\nI chose to attend FSU because of its undergraduate [neuroscience program](https://neuro.fsu.edu/#:~:text=The%20FSU%20Program%20in%20Neuroscience,a%20wide%20range%20of%20research.). After learning about the topic in early high school, I knew I wanted to pursue neuroscience as a career. I wanted to make the best financial decision for my family and me, so I decided to focus on universities in Florida. At the time, most Florida universities did not offer a dedicated neuroscience program, but rather degrees in related topics with a focus in neuroscience. I preferred my undergraduate education to focus on neuroscience as a discipline, rather than a branch of other scientific fields.\nI also chose FSU for its beautiful and walkable campus. FSU’s beauty stood out during my touring process. Tallahassee has been full of activities to do and amazing memories to make. I have been fortunate to build a meaningful, dependable community here that I do not believe I could have found anywhere else.\nHow have FSU’s programs supported your academic accomplishments?\nOne of my most significant accomplishments at FSU is my research project within Dr. Eckel’s lab. My project examines a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist, semaglutide (marketed as Ozempic, the popular weight loss drug) and its effects on dysregulated eating in a pre-clinical rat model of binge eating. Available treatments for bulimic syndromes are limited, making my study significant, as it may help identify GLP-1 as a novel therapeutic target for reducing binge eating in individuals with bulimic syndromes. I was awarded an IDEA grant, which has significantly advanced my research endeavors. This generous funding has allowed me to fully immerse myself in my research goals. I am fortunate to be part of an institution that offers such a wealth of funding opportunities for students to pursue their academic and professional aspirations.\nWhat is one of your most rewarding community service experiences?\nBeyond the classroom, I have been an Ignite Fellow for the past two years. The Ignite Fellowship is a tutoring program provided by Teach for America. As a tutor, I lead a small group of K-8 students through virtual math or reading lessons each semester. I create weekly lesson plans based on students’ weaknesses and school learning guidelines. I focus on building a welcoming environment to foster strong, meaningful relationships, allowing my students to fully embrace learning. It is incredibly rewarding to see students who were once shy when introducing themselves now eagerly shouting out answers before I even finish reading the practice questions.\nHow would you describe your impact on FSU students and beyond?\nI believe my strong commitment to research serves as a model for underclassmen, demonstrating the potential of research opportunities at FSU. I envision myself as a guide for my peers, informing them about the many opportunities available once they engage in research.\nMy work aims to expand existing literature on treatments for bulimic syndromes, addressing their impact on both the local community and individuals worldwide. As a tutor, I contribute to the educational system locally and beyond by offering personalized support to young students. Most of the students I tutor are people of color or from lower-income communities and lack access to essential learning resources. My purpose is to bridge this gap and offer an enriching learning experience. By doing so, I help ensure that all students have the opportunity to achieve academic success both now and in the future.",

    "text": "TORONTO — The Los Angeles Lakers' mystique was alive and well with Ontario bettors. The Lakers, led by superstar LeBron James, were the second-most bet on team on DraftKings' Ontario sportsbook last year. Only the Toronto Blue Jays drew more action. \"The Lakers are a popular team, whether it's the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, it doesn't matter,\" said Johnny Avello, DraftKings' director of race and sports operations. \"The team has a big following and has for many years because of all the great players that go through their doors. \"You go anywhere and you'll see people wearing Lakers shirts.\" The Buffalo Bills -- popular in southern Ontario -- held down third spot. The Toronto Maple Leafs were the only other Canadian franchise to make the cut, standing eighth ahead of basketball's Phoenix Suns and football's New York Jets. The Jays (89-73) finished third in the American League East to qualify for the playoffs. However, they were swept 2-0 by the Minnesota Twins in the AL wildcard series. Toronto was the most-bet on World Series team, ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The champion Texas Rangers were fourth. Toronto slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the most bet-on player to win the AL MVP, ahead of New York's Aaron Judge and Texas's Corey Seager. But Anaheim's Shohei Ohtani, the fourth pick, was the runaway winner of the award before signing a mega 10-year, US$700-million free-agent deal with the Dodgers. Avello wasn't surprised to see the Jays atop the list. \"When you look at certain jurisdictions where we are, teams in that jurisdiction are bet on more than others,\" he said. \"So that's no surprise.\" The Toronto Raptors were the seventh-most bet on team to win the NBA crown. The Milwaukee Bucks, Suns and eventual-champion Denver Nuggets held the top three spots. No Raptors were listed as favourites for the NBA's outstanding player award but Hamilton's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder, was the fourth most-bet on individual by handle. Denver's Nikola Jokic, Boston's Jayson Tatum and Dallas's Luka Doncic were the top-three picks. Toronto's Darko Rajakovic was fourth in betting for the NBA's top coach award. Former Raptors boss Nick Nurse, now with the Philadelphia 76ers, was tops. Last month, Gilgeous-Alexander was named The Canadian Press male athlete of the year. \"He is a tremendous player and has been for a few years now,\" Avello said. \"It's not unusual that he'd be bet up there because he's certainly one of your top players in the NBA.\" Surprisingly, the Cincinnati Bengals were the most bet-on NFL team to win the Super Bowl. Buffalo was second ahead of the San Francisco 49ers (12-4), who've clinched top spot in the NFC. Buffalo (10-6) can secure the AFC East for a fourth straight year with a road win Sunday over Miami. The Dolphins (11-5) have already clinched an NFL playoff spot. \"I found that (Cincinnati selection) to be a little surprising,\" Avello said. 'Buffalo has always been a top choice because it has had a good, competitive team over the last few years and there's also the proximity to Canada. \"But the Bengals have had a good team knocking on the door so I think this was about value . . . going for a double-digit underdog and trying to get a better price for your buck. I don't blame (bettors) because going into the season I thought Cincinnati would also contend for the title but unfortunately when you lose (quarterback) Joe Burrow and a couple of receivers . . . it was just a bad overall year for Cincinnati.\" Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen was the third pick for the NFL's most valuable player award behind San Francisco's Brock Purdy and Dallas's Dak Prescott. Lamar Jackson, who has led Baltimore (13-3) to top spot in the AFC and emerged as the favourite to win the honour for a second time, was initially ninth. Ontario bettors made the Maple Leafs the most bet-on team to win the Stanley Cup. Edmonton was No. 2 ahead of Las Vegas, last year's champion. Toronto last won the Stanley Cup in 1967. \"Toronto has been there, it has had great, outstanding regular-season records, it just hasn't been able to get far enough,\" Avello said. \"I think it (Leafs topping list) should be.\" The Vancouver Canucks were fifth, ahead of the Ottawa Senators (sixth). Rick Tocchet, in his first full season behind Vancouver's bench, was the top selection to win the Jack Adams Trophy as the NHL's top coach. The Canucks (24-11-3, 51 points) currently top the Pacific Conference. Peter Laviolette of the New York Rangers (26-10-1, 53 points) and Mike Sullivan of the Pittsburgh Penguins (19-14-4, 42 points) were the other top two candidates. \"Obviously it makes sense that (Tocchet) would get bet,\" Avello said. \"But (Laviolette) is also a good choice and value play. \"That was probably bet more toward the beginning of the year so I see that also as a very smart play by bettors.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 5, 2024.
