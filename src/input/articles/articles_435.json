    "text": "Frank Wilson Sentenced to 40 Years for Second-Degree Murder of Partner Sonja Burch\n‘Take Our Border Back’ Convoy Rallies in Dripping Springs, Calling for Stronger Border Security\nIn a display of united dissent, the ‘Take Our Border Back’ convoy arrived at Dripping Springs, Texas, on Wednesday evening, despite a three-hour delay. The convoy, a collective of trucks and private vehicles, was met with a small crowd of supporters, underscoring the local resonance of their cause. This demonstration, aimed at expressing concerns about border security and its implications on local communities, is part of a wider peaceful First Amendment gathering.\nFrom Vigil to Rally\nThe convoy’s arrival in Dripping Springs sets the stage for a scheduled pep rally on Thursday at the One Shot Distillery & Brewery. This gathering seeks to pool insights from experts and individuals with firsthand experience of border issues, thereby fostering a broader understanding of the situation. One such supporter, Michael R. from Athens, Texas, emphasized the significance of the rally and the overarching need for bolstered border security. His hopes for peaceful demonstrations throughout the convoy’s nationwide tour echo the sentiment of many involved.\nOn the Road to Eagle Pass\nPost pep-rally, the convoy is slated to depart from Dripping Springs on Friday, making its way to Eagle Pass. This chosen route is not arbitrary, but rather a deliberate attempt to demonstrate solidarity with state leaders advocating for stronger border security measures. Eagle Pass has become a focal point in recent times, given its status as a hotspot for migrants crossing the border into Texas.\nA Nationwide Call to Action\nThe ‘Take Our Border Back’ convoy, which has already journeyed through nine states over two and a half days, is more than a protest—it’s a nationwide call to action. The participants, who have collectively raised $157,000 in donations, argue that the Biden administration needs to take more decisive actions to address border security issues. Despite facing internal friction and instances of sabotage, the convoy has managed to keep its wheels turning, gathering momentum as it passes through different states.\nAs the migrant crisis at the southern border continues to dominate national discourse, the ‘Take Our Border Back’ convoy serves as a reminder of the pressing need for a more secure border. Whether the Biden administration will answer this call-to-action remains to be seen.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.\n[]https://bnnbreaking.com/world/chitungwiza-municipality-launches-verification-process-for-land-stand-offer-letters-amid-fraud-concerns/",

    "text": "Mexico City, Aug 1 (EFE).- Tropical storm Carlotta, the third cyclone of the Pacific season, could bring rain and “strong” winds to states in western Mexico on Thursday, although it is not expected to make landfall, the National Meteorological Service (SMN) said.\n“Carlotta is gradually intensifying. Its wide circulation increases the probability of heavy to very heavy rains in the west of the country, as well as strong winds and high waves in Baja California Sur,” warned the SMN in a notice.\nThe cyclone, which emerged on Wednesday, was last reported 635 kilometers (390 miles) south of Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur, one of Mexico’s top tourist destinations, and 735 kilometers (450 miles) west-southeast of the port of Manzanillo, Colima.\nThe phenomenon is expected to intensify on Thursday afternoon to become a Category 1 hurricane, but the forecast trajectory indicates that it will gradually move away from Mexican territory.\nHowever, the SMN predicts that the “wide circulation of Carlotta will increase the probability of very heavy rainfall,” of 50 to 75 millimeters, in Jalisco, as well as “heavy rainfall,” of 25 to 50 millimeters, in Baja California Sur, Nayarit, Colima and Michoacán.\n“The rains could be accompanied by electrical discharges and hail, in addition to causing an increase in the levels of rivers and streams, landslides, puddles and flooding in areas of the indicated states,” the forecast said.\nWind gusts of 40 to 60 kilometers per hour and waves of 1 to 2 meters high are also forecast for the coasts of Baja California Sur.\nMexican authorities in May forecast up to 41 named cyclones in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, of which at least five would hit the country, a figure above average in both cases.\nSo far, three cyclones have hit Mexico, all in the Atlantic: Hurricane Beryl and Storm Chris, which left no deaths in July, and Storm Alberto in June, when it left six dead in Nuevo León, a state on Mexico’s northern border.",
