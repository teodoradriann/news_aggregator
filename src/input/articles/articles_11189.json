    "title": "The Rise of Character.ai: From Fictional Chats to Therapy Sessions",
    "text": "2024-01-05 18:32:00\nTitle: Character.ai Chat Platform Allows Users to Interact with Fictional and Non-Fictional Characters\nA new chat platform called Character.ai is gaining popularity for its unique feature that allows users to chat with their favorite fictional and non-fictional characters. Similar to ChatGPT, Character.ai connects users with virtual personalities for engaging conversations. Whether it’s Harry Potter, Super Mario, Beyoncé, or any other beloved figure, the platform offers a wide range of characters for users to interact with.\nOne particular virtual character, the Psychologist, has attracted significant attention on the platform. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the Psychologist character has received a staggering 78 million messages from users seeking answers to life’s questions.\nThe creator of the Psychologist character, Sam Zaia, expressed surprise at the popularity of the virtual bot. “I never meant for it to become popular or for other people to find it or use it as a tool,” Zaia stated. “Then I started getting a lot of messages from people saying they were really positively affected by it and using it as a source of comfort.”\nZaia initially developed the bot as a way to have someone to talk to when his friends were unavailable, but its widespread use raises questions about its implications for society and mental well-being.\nThe existence of such a tool prompts reflection on whether it signifies a positive development or a reflection of societal and individual struggles. As technology continues to evolve, the impact of virtual interactions on our emotional and psychological well-being remains a topic of debate.\nCharacter.ai’s unique concept raises important conversations about the role of technology in addressing people’s emotional needs and the potential impact on society’s mental health.\nThe debate surrounding Character.ai and the Psychologist character prompts further exploration of the implications of virtual interactions on individuals and society as a whole. What do you think about the rise of virtual character interactions?\n#Millions #people #artificial #intelligence #treatment #Gamereactor",

    "text": "Torna a casa il piccolo Hector, 3 mesi, che è arrivato dal Venezuela insieme alla mamma all’ospedale San Vincenzo di Taormina, lo scorso Natale, in condizioni critiche per essere operato al cuore. Adesso, grazie all’intervento dello staff del reparto di Cardiochirurgia pediatrica, diretto dal primario Sasha Agati, pochi giorni dopo l’operazione, è pronto per lasciare il nosocomio di contrada Sirina. «Si è trattato di un intervento difficile - ha detto il primario -, comunque siamo riusciti a risolvere la situazione». L’iter è stato avviato, dai medici venezuelani, il dottor Carlos Julio Troconis, chirurgo cardiovascolare, ed il collega Pedro Macuarisma, cardiologo infantile, che hanno contattato il centro di eccellenza taorminese per aiutare il bambino, arrivato in Italia quasi in fin di vita. La Fondazione Chincherini ha poi provveduto alla logistica. Importante è stata la collaborazione dell’associazione Matumaini Speranza onlus presieduta da Carmen Falletta, ideatrice del progetto «I bambini di Matilde». Anche i volontari della Misericordia San Giuseppe di Letojanni hanno fornito il loro supporto a Hector e alla mamma. È arrivato anche il ringraziamento del consolato generale d’Italia a Caracas per quanto realizzato dal complesso sanitario taorminese. Il reparto di Cardiochirurgia pediatrica del San Vincenzo ha pubblicato un post che racconta quanto accaduto, video. «Lo avevamo chiamato - si legge nella pagina Facebook - \"il miracolo di Natale\", il piccolo Hector è arrivato a Taormina dal Venezuela insieme alla mamma proprio il 25 dicembre, in condizioni critiche. Alcuni giorni dopo l'intervento cardiochirurgico, sta bene ed è pronto per lasciare l'ospedale e tornare a casa. Un miracolo reso possibile dallo sforzo di tantissime persone». Il reparto ringrazia tutti le persone coinvolte chiude con un messaggio di speranza: «Il bene trova sempre la sua strada».",

    "text": "A cosmetic and weight loss clinic that secretly filmed patients is “not safe”, the health watchdog has found as it put the provider in special measures to protect the public.A damning report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found that Doncaster-based Elements Medical was inadequate in every area it inspected in October, concluding it was “not safe”, “not effective” and “not well led”.The clinic, which also operates online as The Virtual Slimming Clinic, offers services including weight management, pre and postoperative care for cosmetic and bariatric surgery, treatments for skin conditions including acne, and vitamin injections, the CQC said on Friday.Among the long list of concerns, the report said: “We saw that people were covertly filmed at the premises including while receiving treatment, without their knowledge or consent.“In addition, the provider told us that the closed-circuit television monitoring (CCTV) was monitored and managed by a third-party provider which posed a safeguarding risk.”The inspectors said they found a large quantity of the muscular injection Dysport in a fridge which was turned off during clinic times because it was noisy.The report said: “Staff told us this medicine had been imported from Turkey, and we found labels on the medicine were not in English, however, the provider did not have a licence to import any medicines to England.“Turkey is also not an approved country for the purposes of supplying medicines for use in England by the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).”The report continued: “We also found the provider was using this injection in place of Botox, however, people using the service had not been informed of this.“We saw evidence that vials which were meant for single use only were being shared between multiple patients, which posed a significant infection risk.”The inspectors also said that the firm bought the dilutant Bacteriostatic sodium chloride 0.9% from a website, which said: “All products listed on this website are for research purposes only, we do not advocate or advise human use, and any such use is entirely at your own risk.”They pointed to a series of other safety concerns, including obstructed fire exits, “lit candles in clinic and waiting rooms which were unattended for significant periods of time”, unsafely stored oxygen, and a defibrillator with no pads which left it “not usable in the event of an emergency”.Subscribe free to our weekly newsletter for exclusive and original coverage from ITV News. Direct to your inbox every Friday morning. The report concluded that the provider showed “a disregard for the safety of staff and people using the service and staff, confidentiality, and information security”.It said: “The CQC assessment team did not feel that all staff, including the provider, acted with openness, honesty and transparency during the inspection visit.“There was a disregard for the duty of candour. Where people had been placed at significant risk of harm by the service, we saw no evidence that they had been informed of this.”The CQC said it did not inspect how caring or responsive the service was, as it focused on the areas of concern, and these areas both remain rated as good from the previous inspection.Being placed in special measures means the service will be kept under close review by CQC, the watchdog said.Alan Stephenson, CQC deputy director of operations in the north, said: “When we inspected Elements Medical, we had serious concerns about the safety of the service and how it was being managed, to ensure people were getting the service and treatment they deserve.“We identified widespread shortfalls including people’s understanding of procedures and their consent to them, and how the service kept people safe from abuse.“Staff lacked basic knowledge of safeguarding procedures, including how to report concerns, and the service secretly filmed people during treatment without consent.”Mr Stephenson said: “We have told Elements Medical where we expect to see rapid and widespread improvements and will continue to monitor them closely to keep people safe while this happens.\"The report will be published on CQC’s website in the next few days.Elements Medical owner Sandy Green said: “On behalf of everyone at Elements Medical Ltd, I want to sincerely apologise for the shortcomings identified and reassure all our clients – past, present, and future – of our unwavering commitment to patient care, safety, and the continuous improvement of the services we provide.”Ms Green said she fully accepted the findings, adding: “The feedback has been both sobering and instructive, and we are resolute in our determination to learn from it.”She said the firm has undertaken extensive work to address the concerns “to ensure that similar issues never occur again” and pledged to work with the CQC.Ms Green said: “This is a defining moment for us as an organisation, and we are determined to rebuild the trust of our clients by demonstrating meaningful change.“We sincerely thank our patients for their understanding as we move forward on this journey of reflection, growth, and transformation.”Have you heard The Trapped?

The water bottle is constructed with layers of cardboard, aluminum and polyethylene, which gives it just the right level of rigidity for everyday use but also supports easier recycling. This combats against the traditional design of reusable water bottles that are often plastic or metal that is difficult or simply not feasible to be recycled.\nThe 'reU' reusable water bottle concept is not meant to last forever like many water bottle designs on the market, but can instead be used over and over before properly recycling it. This will come as welcome news to those who want to use a fresh vessel on a regular basis without being too wasteful.\nThe 'reU' Reusable Water Bottle Concept is Recyclable\n[Michael Hemsworth](/Michael.Hemsworth)— January 5, 2024 — [Eco](/eco)\nReferences:\nyankodesign\nTrend Themes\n1.
