Support independent journalism by subscribing to our digital news package. Subscribe now Fabian LeBron is taking an active role in mitigating plastic waste.\nImage: Supplied\nWhile beaches might bring happy memories and hours of fun in the sun, marine life is often victim to damaging waste.\nTo combat this growing problem, The Litterboom Project has found ways to collect waste pumped into South Africa's oceans.\nAs we mark Plastic Free Month in July, we spoke to Fabian LeBron, a worker at the project.\n“I was looking for a job and received a call from Cameron Service [Litterboom CEO] who called me in for an interview. He explained the type of work we'll be doing, specifically in the river, and the role we are playing in the ecosystem. I jumped on,” said LeBron.\nFabian LeBron's 3 tips to mitigate waste 1. Minimise single-use plastics: the less we use plastics that are hard to get rid of and which can't be recycled, the better.\n2. Reduce water waste that ends up in waterways.\n3. Make sure you do proper recycling. Recycling hubs can help people put different plastics in different containers. Organisations can volunteer and donate to help.\nTaking an active role in mitigating plastic waste, LeBron found litterbooms not only helped clean the area but also brought back wildlife.\n“The site we worked on in the Black River had so much dirt and litter, and over six months or so we could see the difference. At first there weren't many birds around, but after that we started to see it come alive. Flamingos were coming over, there was a lot of fish movement. By clearing up the space we made it beautiful again.”\nAs part of the project, LeBron featured in a short film titled Litterboom: a Vision of a Clean Future . Made in association with Corona Studios and Oceanic Global, the film shows LeBron and fellow environmentalist Josh Redman, who focus on technological solutions that protect the ocean's fragile ecosystem.\nThis goes hand-in-hand with LeBron's main focus to inform communities about the damage caused by waste in marine life.\n“We have cleanups in the communities by keeping them involved. We have campaigns and work with community leaders and others who are well known,” said LeBron.\n“Companies also help in the communities. If we can broaden the whole thing, more people would know what's happening in their environments.”",

    "text": "Ilze Petersons is a retired program coordinator for the Peace & Justice Center of Eastern Maine. Those of us who watch the daily reports of developments in Israel, Gaza and the Middle East through the mass media may be full of despair and hopelessness. All reported options lead to horrific violence, death and suffering with no possibility for peace, real security and mutual understanding. Are there any hopeful options? Many of us watched in horror as more than a thousand innocent Israelis, mainly women and children, were slaughtered by Hamas on Oct. 7. Our hearts ached for the families left to grieve or wonder about the fate of their loved ones, and we are grateful some hostages have been released. In the days since Oct. 7, we watched in horror as Israeli forces bombed and destroyed much of the sliver of land that was Gaza, one of the most densely populated places in the world. More than 23,000 Palestinians have been killed , including 10,000 children . In the name of wiping out Hamas, most Gazans have been displaced, denied food and shelter, even water. Neighborhoods are rubble, schools destroyed and hospitals are “dead zones” without electricity. Some of us have been dismayed that our government seemingly gives lip service to protecting innocent civilians but continues to arm the Israeli government. As a result of the conflict, antisemitism and Islamophobia have increased in the U.S. and globally. Extremist Hamas and extremist right-wing Israeli government both define the complexity of the decades-long search for a peaceful solution to the Israeli/Palestinian crisis in black-and-white violent terms. This rigid extremist-defined conflict now threatens to become a regional and even larger global war. To maintain some sense of hope and humanity, I searched for voices impacted who believe there is no military or violent solution. A peaceful and just resolution is the only way to work for a future recognizing the fears, concerns and dignity of all involved. There are such organizations, including both Israelis and Palestinians, who grieve losses because of the unresolved conflict. These groups include Combatants for Peace, Alliance for Mideast Peace, Parents Circle-Families Forum and others. I was saddened to read of the Oct. 7 death of one such peace activist in the attack by Hamas on the Kibbutz where she had lived since 1974. She was Vivian Silver , a 74-year-old Canadian Israeli, who helped to found Women Wage Peace. She was a leader in the organization which had pushed the Israel government to seek a political solution to its long-standing conflict with Palestinians. At her memorial, an Arab Palestinian friend, Ghadeeri Hami, vowed that Silver’s work would carry on. I was also heartened to hear of a recent tour in the U.S. by members of Standing Together, a grassroots movement of Arab Israeli, Palestinian and Jewish Israeli citizens and communities pursuing peace, equality and justice. This organization has the goal of bringing residents together to discuss relations between the communities in the ongoing conflicts and how to restore hope. The Times of Israel reported on Nov. 16 that hundreds had gathered in Jerusalem at a recent meeting. Shir Nehamkin, national co-director, spoke of the need for unity. “There are people who incite violence against Palestinians in Israel to deepen the rift between us and them, and fan the flames of suspicion and hate. We cannot let that happen,” he said. “These are the same people that keep promising us a messianic vision of occupation, Jewish supremacy, and by that take away our security.” Palestinian national co-director, Rula Daoud, summed up the urgency of the need for leaders who seek a peaceful resolution, the paper reported. “We need leaders who can take brave steps, and allow Arabs and Jews to live here in peace, security and equality,” Daoud said. “Two peoples live on this land, and neither one of them is going to leave.” I hope that we can empathize, join in solidarity and be inspired by these courageous voices for a more lasting nonviolence, peace, justice and security.",

    "title": "Who is Jeff Landry, Louisiana’s 57th Governor?",
    "text": "NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - On October 14, 2023, Jeff Martin Landry defied political pundits and won the race for governor outright, besting 14 other candidates.\n”Tonight’s election, and make no mistake about it, it was historic,” said Landry to his supporters.\nA win without a runoff that flipped Louisiana’s governor’s office to red from blue. For the past eight years, Democrat John Bel Edwards held the governorship.\nLandry, who backed former President Donald Trump in his bid to become governor, was born and raised in St. Martinville, a small town an hour away from Baton Rouge, where Landry will occupy the governor’s mansion.\nFor more than 20 years, Landry has been married to the former Sharon LeBlanc, and they have a son. Their home base is Acadiana.\nBrought up in a middle-class family, Landry is one of four children. His mother was a school teacher, and his father was an architect. Raised Roman Catholic, Landry says his parents taught them about faith.\nLandry, 53, grew up during the oil bust of the 1980s.\nLandry says he went to work in the sugar cane fields right after high school and joined the Louisiana Army National Guard while still a high schooler.\nAnd was in the military during Operation Desert Storm.\nOnce back in Louisiana, Landry attended the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and worked in law enforcement while in college. After graduating from college started an oil and gas environmental service company.\nIn 2004, Landry earned a law degree from Loyola University New Orleans. Six years later in 2010, Landry was elected to Congress and represented Louisiana’s 3rd Congressional District from 2011 to January 2013.\nRELATED CONTENT Gubernatorial front-runner Jeff Landry will not attend Gray TV debate Landry says AG’s office will prosecute more New Orleans criminal cases Republican Jeff Landry wins the Louisiana governor’s race, reclaims office for GOP Gov. Edwards offers congratulations to Governor-elect Jeff Landry In late 2015, Landry was elected Louisiana attorney general and won reelection in 2019.\nA staunch conservative, Landry defended in court and supports Louisiana’s near-total abortion ban and as attorney general he did not shy away from challenging democratic policies in court.\nIn 2018, Landry joined other Republican attorneys general in a case that challenged the constitutionality of the federal Affordable Care Act.\nIn June of 2023, he filed suit against FEMA over Risk Rating 2.0, which has resulted in rising flood insurance premiums for many homeowners.\n“In fact, I would submit that the Risk Rating 2.0 flood insurance policy has now become a natural disaster of its own,” said Landry at a press conference announcing the lawsuit.\nOn the day he officially qualified for the governor’s race and throughout the campaign talked about crime.\n“Why do we have a crime problem? Cause many of y’all have reported this. We have three cities in a state of 4 and a half million people which is half the size of the Dallas-Fort Worth area that are in the top 10 most dangerous cities in the country,” he said at the secretary of state’s office.\nAnd after winning the race, he created a transition committee to focus entirely on the city of New Orleans, a Democratic stronghold.\n“We want the city of New Orleans to operate like the city of Charleston, or the city of Nashville or some of the other great Southern cities around the country and we know that it can but it’s got a lot of problems and we know that one of them is crime,” said Landry about his decision.\nAnd in a show of bipartisan collaboration, Landry recently stood with New Orleans Democratic District Attorney Jason Williams and announced that the attorney general’s office under Liz Murrill, who served under him when he was A.G. will prosecute more criminal cases that emanate from State Police investigations.\n“This new partnership will assist in restoring the rule of law to this city and provide victims the justice they deserve,” said Landry.\nLandry takes over when the state is flush with cash. According to the Division of Administration, he assumes the governorship as state government has a $325 million surplus. When Edwards began governor the state had a fiscal crisis and deficits in the billions. Edwards says the state also has $3 billion in reserve accounts.\nLandry will also work with a friendly legislature. Both chambers have Republican supermajorities.\nBut voters will look to him to make good on his promise to enhance the crime fight, so he plans to call a special session early this year focused on crime. And he assumes power as the property insurance crisis persists.Also, with little time to spare Landry will need to call lawmakers into another special session to redraw a map of Louisiana’s congressional districts because a federal judge ruled the current map dilutes black voting strength in the state.\nEdwards and other Democrats and voting rights advocates maintain that Louisiana’s population demands a second black majority district.\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?
