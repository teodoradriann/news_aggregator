    "text": "( MENAFN - Jordan Times) AMMAN - Her Majesty Queen Rania penned an op-ed for The Washington Post, published on Thursday, on the tragic losses in Gaza and the urgency of a ceasefire.\nQueen Rania wrote that“Bethlehem usually comes alive at Christmas. Not this year. In the Holy Land, celebrations have been cancelled: No parades, no bazaars, no public tree lightings. In my country, Jordan, where Jesus was baptised, our Christian community has chosen to do the same.”\nHer Majesty said that in the occupied West Bank, one Bethlehem church has adapted its nativity scene, placing the infant Jesus among the rubble of a bombed-out building, indicating that“It is a reflection of the story playing out on screens everywhere: The horrific images of the destruction of Gaza, and especially, its bloodied and broken children”.\n“I watch a video of a Gazan father stroking his daughter's face, telling someone to look at how beautiful she is. She could almost be sleeping, if not for her white shroud.”\nQueen Rania emphasised the resilience and strength of the people of Gaza,“the people of Gaza have not lost hope in others' humanity - even as so many fail to see theirs.”\nHer Majesty elaborated on the extent of destruction caused by the war on Gaza,“In just over two months, Israel has turned Gaza into a hellscape. Almost 20,000 dead. At least 8,000 are children - more than the death tolls of Pearl Harbor, the September 11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina combined.”\n“International organisations are now calling Gaza a graveyard for children. How perverse that the Holy Land should be described as something so profoundly unholy,” the Queen said.\n“This has become an unequivocal humanitarian nightmare. With each passing day, the threshold of what is acceptable falls to new lows, setting a terrifying precedent for this and other wars to come.”\nHer Majesty stressed that“no matter what side you support, you can still demand a ceasefire, the release of hostages and detainees, and unrestricted access to aid”.\n“I am a mother, and my heart breaks for parents in Gaza doing everything in their power to keep their children alive - and then losing them. All parents share the impulse to shield their children from the worst of the world. No matter who you are or where you come from, your instinct to care for and protect those you love is one you must honour in yourself but also in strangers - even adversaries. Honouring it selectively diminishes our own humanity,” the Queen said.\nHighlighting the urgency for the war to end, the Queen said,“Today, it boils down to one question that each of us must answer: If you could prevent hundreds or thousands more children from dying, would you?\nMENAFN23122023000028011005ID1107652189\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that it will lay off about 10,000 full-time employees. The move is projected to save taxpayers $1.8 billion annually.What the department billed as a \"dramatic restructuring\" comes in response to President Donald Trump's executive order implementing the Republican's \"Department of Government Efficiency Workforce Optimization Initiative.\" HHS said it expects a total downsizing of between 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees when combining this latest effort with early retirement and the results of the Fork in the Road, the deferred resignation offer of full pay and benefits until September. RFK JR. DETAILS FIRST BABY FORMULA REVIEW IN DECADES AMID CONCERNS OVER CONTAMINANTS, SUPPLY CHAIN Education Secretary nominee Linda McMahon and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attend a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Feb. 26, 2025. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) \"We aren't just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,\" HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said in a statement. \"This Department will do more – a lot more – at a lower cost to the taxpayer.\" \"Over time, bureaucracies like HHS become wasteful and inefficient even when most of their staff are dedicated and competent civil servants,\" Kennedy added. \"This overhaul will be a win-win for taxpayers and for those that HHS serves. That’s the entire American public, because our goal is to Make America Healthy Again.\" Thursday's announcement is intended to streamline the functions of HHS. The department said the 28 divisions of HHS contain \"many redundant units,\" and the restructuring plan will consolidate them into 15 new divisions, including a new Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA. It also will \"centralize core functions\" such as Human Resources, Information Technology, Procurement, External Affairs, and Policy, the department said. Five of the 10 regional offices will shut down. People protest personnel cuts at the CDC outside the organization's headquarters on March 12, 2025, in Atlanta. (Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images) The reorganization of the department is also meant to implement \"the new HHS priority of ending America’s epidemic of chronic illness by focusing on safe, wholesome food, clean water, and the elimination of environmental toxins.\" MILLIONS SPENT BY BIDEN ON COVID 'VACCINE HESITANCY' CAMPAIGN SLASHED BY TRUMP NIH: REPORT The AHA – described as a \"new, unified entity\" – will encompass the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).The department said the centralization \"will improve coordination of health resources for low-income Americans and will focus on areas including Primary Care, Maternal and Child Health, Mental Health, Environmental Health, HIV/AIDS, and Workforce development.\" HHS said transferring SAMHSA to AHA \"will increase operational efficiency and assure programs are carried out because it will break down artificial divisions between similar programs.\" The Department of Health and Human Services in the Hubert H. Humphrey Building in Washington on Monday, March 10, 2025. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) The restructuring is also meant to strengthen the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). HHS said the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), responsible for national disaster and public health emergency response, will transfer to the CDC, \"reinforcing its core mission to protect Americans from health threats.\" Notably, Trump earlier this week named Susan Monarez, the current acting director of the CDC, to hold that position permanently. Her nomination replaces Trump's original pick for the role, Dr. David Weldon. HHS said Thursday it will create a new assistant secretary for enforcement to oversee the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB), Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals (OMHA), and Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to \"combat waste, fraud, and abuse in federal health programs.\" The department will also merge the assistant secretary for planning and evaluation (ASPE) with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to create the Office of Strategy \"to enhance research that informs the Secretary’s policies and improves the effectiveness of federal health programs.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The department said \"critical programs that support older adults and people with disabilities will be integrated into other HHS agencies, including the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), ASPE, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\" HHS said the reorganization will not impact Medicare and Medicaid services.",

    "text": "No dia 23 de janeiro, Nasi , renomado cantor e compositor paulistano, celebra seu 63º aniversário com o lançamento do single “Rosa Selvagem” . Esta canção é a primeira prévia do álbum ao vivo intitulado “Solo ma non troppo”, previsto para ser lançado no primeiro semestre de 2025. O disco trará uma gravação do show que marcou o lançamento de seu álbum anterior, “RockSoulBlues” , realizado em 2024, coincidentemente no dia em que o artista completou 62 anos.\nShow no Sesc e turnê com a banda Ira! A apresentação ao vivo ocorreu em 4 de abril de 2024, no Sesc 14 Bis, em São Paulo, onde Nasi estreou seu show inspirado no álbum “RockSoulBlues”. A faixa “Rosa Selvagem” é uma adaptação em português da famosa música “Ramblin’ Rose”, originalmente escrita por Marijohn Wilkin, Fred Burch e Obey Wilson. Esta canção foi lançada em 1967 pelo icônico Jerry Lee Lewis e ganhou nova interpretação em 1969 pela banda MC5, refletindo a essência punk que Nasi incorpora em sua música.\nDurante o show, Nasi não se limita apenas às faixas de “RockSoulBlues”. Ele também apresenta clássicos como “Hoochie Coochie Man” (Willie Dixon, 1954), “Rockixe” (Raul Seixas e Paulo Coelho, 1973) e “O Rei da Cocada Preta” (com Professor Longhair, 2000), demonstrando sua versatilidade musical.\nAlém do lançamento do álbum ao vivo, Nasi está se preparando para embarcar em uma turnê com a banda Ira! , na qual revisitarão o repertório do famoso Acústico MTV gravado pelo grupo. A trajetória do artista continua a ser marcada por inovações e homenagens aos gêneros que moldaram sua carreira.",

    "text": "«C'est quelque chose qui va nous suivre pendant longtemps. C'est décevant», déplore la native de Châteauguay AFP | La défenseuse du Canada Vanessa Gilles a défendu son équipe jeudi, au lendemain de la condamnation d'un membre de l'équipe à huit mois de prison avec sursis pour le survol par un drone d'une séance d'entraînement des Néo-Zélandaises. • À lire aussi: Canada–Nouvelle-Zélande: une victoire «aussi sale que la Seine» • À lire aussi: Espionnage à Soccer Canada: «Ça ne semble pas être la première fois» • À lire aussi: Espionnage par drone: le Comité olympique croit la version de l’entraîneuse-cheffe et estime que les sanctions imposées à l’équipe sont suffisantes \"Nous ne sommes pas des tricheuses\", a déclaré Vanessa Gilles à Saint-Étienne après le match gagné (2-1) contre la Nouvelle-Zélande pour le compte du tournoi olympique de football féminin (Gr.A). Le ressortissant canadien de 43 ans, \"jugé mercredi après-midi dans le cadre d'une audience de comparution sur reconnaissance préalable de culpabilité (CRPC), a accepté sa condamnation\", selon le parquet de Saint-Étienne. En parallèle, la commission de discipline de la Fifa a ouvert une procédure notamment contre l'équipe du Canada et la sélectionneuse. Le dossier sera soumis à l'examen de la commission de discipline dans les prochains jours, a détaillé la Fifa. La sélectionneuse du Canada Bev Priestman avait annoncé se retirer pour le match contre la Nouvelle-Zélande. Elle a été remplacée par Andy Spence. \"Honnêtement cela n'a pas été facile. Il y a eu beaucoup d'émotion, de frustration et d'humiliation car en tant que joueuse, cela ne reflète pas nos valeurs et ce que nous voulons représenter en tant que compétitrice aux JO\", a déclaré Gilles en zone mixte. \"Les Jeux, c'est la représentation du fair-play. Comme Canadienne, ce ne sont pas nos valeurs, notre pays. Nous ne sommes pas des tricheuses. Cela a été très dur mais en tant que joueuse nous avons su être soudées\", a poursuivi la joueuse qui évolue en club à Lyon et a été championne olympique avec le Canada en 2021 à Tokyo. \"C'est quelque chose qui va nous suivre pendant longtemps. C'est décevant. Mais c'est à nous de rester soudées et d'essayer de ne pas laisser les réseaux sociaux et les médias entrer dans notre bulle. Nous avons déjà su faire cela dans le passé\", a ajouté Vanessa Gilles.",

    "title": "Heartbreak Island's Joshua tells: 'I hit rock bottom'",
    "text": "A few years ago, Heartbreak Island star Joshua Fankhauser experienced several earth-shattering things in his life.\nOver three years, his dad began to struggle with addiction issues, Joshua found himself depressed and jobless, and two of his friends died suddenly. He likens the time to “running from a tiger!”\nThe former DJ and “big softie” contestant on the first season of the TVNZ reality dating show feared he’d never fully recover.\nHowever, thanks to wellness tools like breathwork, exercise and nutrition, the 32-year-old survived the crisis, turned his life around and also found love with partner Dayna Lawton, 29, whom he calls his “beautiful rock”.\nThe loved-up couple now live in Lake Hāwea, near Wānaka, with their rescue pup Lola, a Huntaway-Shar Pei cross.\nAs Joshua reflects on the crazy time that led him to where he is now, he tells Woman’s Day that it began in 2018, when he went on the show.\nHis “upper-middle class” dad began to uncharacteristically battle with addiction issues to cope with work stress. At the same time, his parents’ marriage was “going south”.\nPart of the show’s appeal was the $100,000 prize money. Joshua thought it would help his family during the difficult break-up.\nJoshua didn’t win money or find love and on exiting the show, he was unaware of how bad his dad’s addiction issues were actually becoming.\n“After Heartbreak Island, we went into business together, manufacturing and exporting a food product,” tells Joshua.\n“Soon after, Dad began acting erratically. He started accusing me of the strangest things, completely non-work-related – stealing and plotting against him. Basically, he was paranoid about almost any and everything. It both confused me and made life really difficult as I was already treading water.\n“I cut ties with him as I just couldn’t deal with the delusions. A few weeks later, I found out that dad was battling with addiction issues.”\nTheir family life and business crumbled, and Joshua struggled to cope. He got a new job at a gym but lost it soon after for “mismanaging stress”. He then moved home with his mum and went on the dole. During that time, in 2019, a close friend, Matt, died in a tragic accident. “That’s when I hit rock bottom,” he shares.\nWhen a second friend, fellow Heartbreak Island and The Bachelorette NZ contestant Tavita Karika died suddenly in 2021, Joshua was once again heartbroken. The pair had met on the show and remained close afterwards.\n“I was at work when I found out,” he recalls. “I called [Heartbreak Island co-winner] Harry Jowsey straight away. We both cried on the phone. I then left work and went to be by myself. I’d spoken to Tavita a couple of days prior while he read me his daily gratitude.”\nJoshua’s worried mum encouraged him to try doing breathwork, which targets the nervous system, allowing big emotions to be breathed away and reactions to soften.\n“I was so sick of being angry at the world and sitting in stillness showed me the exit sign for the roundabout,” he says. “I could lower my chronic state of fight- or-flight enough to look for the lessons and find gratitude.”\nHe gained so much from it that he became certified and registered in breathwork, revised his uni sports science and nutrition qualifications, and started the online coaching business TwoSix Wellness. Now he helps others navigate stress, and runs workshops and retreats nationally, sharing his story.\n“I built the business from gratitude and love, rather than anger and hatred,” he say. “It was a process of baby steps that helped me get there.”\nThe path also led to love with Dayna, a registered nurse and personal trainer. The pair met at a Queenstown gym in 2022.\nThe pair recently returned from Australia, where she won her first body-building competition in the bikini athletic category. “It’s very exciting!” Joshua says of her achievement.\nThe couple is in the market to buy their second property, and plan to marry and start a family in the future.\nSadly, his relationship with his dad, whose addiction is unresolved, is still damaged. His father has pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of assault on a person in a family relationship. But Joshua holds hope.\n“There were beautiful times before addiction,” he says.\nGrief still rears its head, but he’s learnt to create space for it and find meaning. Teaching others to recognise the signs of burnout and recover from setbacks drives him, and “weirdly, life’s failures” have made Joshua a better person.\n“He will do whatever it takes to ensure others are uplifted and supported,” Dayna says, going on to describe him as “inspiring, driven and someone who cares deeply about others”.\nJoshua adds, “I cry at least once a week seeing my clients succeed, knowing the spaces they came to me in were similar to those I once was in. We all have baggage. But it’s how we hold it within ourselves that dictates our future.”",
