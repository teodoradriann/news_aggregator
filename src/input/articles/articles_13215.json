    "text": "Winter storms and cinema closures in North America didn’t dampen the opening weekend for “ Mean Girls. ” The Paramount release, adapted from the Broadway musical and the 2004 Tina Fey movie, earned $28 million in its first three days in theaters according to studio estimates Sunday. Not accounting for inflation, that’s more than the $24.4 million the first movie made in its opening weekend.\nThe “Mean Girls” competition over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend featured several new releases, including the Jason Statham action movie “ The Beekeeper \" and the Jay-Z produced biblical satire “The Book of Clarence,\" in addition to a slew of awards contenders capitalizing on buzz from recent nominations and the Golden Globes .\nAs with “Barbie,” another enthusiastically pink movie, female audiences made up the vast majority (76%) of opening weekend ticket buyers for “Mean Girls.” According to exit polls, 70% were between the ages of 18 and 34, which, yes, means that it had appeal for audiences who hadn’t been born when Regina George was first introduced to the world.\n“The property is iconic,” said Chris Aronson, Paramount’s president of domestic distribution. “Tina Fey is legendary and her contemporary twist has resonated with audiences, particularly the female audience.”\nThis iteration of “Mean Girls” stars Angourie Rice, Auli’i Cravalho and Reneé Rap, who played Regina on stage. It was originally planned to go straight to streaming on Paramount+, but the studio pivoted after test scores were positive. Social media played a big part in getting the word out and “Mean Girls” also inspired groups of friends to go to the movies together. An estimated 40% went with two or more friends.\nFey returned to write and co-star in the new film, which was directed by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. and cost a reported $36 million to produce. Reviews have been more positive than not, with a 70% on Rotten Tomatoes, but audiences gave it a B CinemaScore which may not bode especially well for word-of-mouth appeal. Recent musicals like “Wonka” and “The Color Purple” scored in the A-range. The studio is optimistic after this weekend though. It also made $6.5 million from 16 international markets.\n“It’s no secret that the release calendar is a little light for the first couple months of the year and because of the reception to this film we stand a chance of broadening this audience,” Aronson said. “It really is a crowd-pleaser.”\nAmazon and MGM’s “The Beekeeper\" debuted in second place with an estimated $16.8 million from 3,303 theaters. Men made up approximately 62% of ticket buyers and audiences overall gave it a B+ CinemaScore. By the end of the four-day weekend, the studio expects it to have made $19.1 million. Miramax handled the international distribution for “The Beekeper,” which also grossed $20.4 million from 49 territories.\nThird place went to “Wonka,” which added $8.4 million in its fifth weekend. The Timothée Chalamet-led musical has now made over $178 million domestically and $500 million globally.\n“Musicals are on a roll,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “It seems like a lot of studios run away from putting musical on their films for fear of limiting their audience pool, but I think this is a genre Hollywood should embrace and highlight.”\nThe Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell romantic comedy “Anyone But You,” a Sony release, is turning into a bit of a sleeper success as well, making nearly $7 million in its fourth weekend. By Monday, its domestic total should be around $56.5 million. Universal and Illumination’s “Migration” rounded out the top five with $6.2 million in its fourth weekend.\nNot everything landed this weekend, though. “ The Book of Clarence ,” a faith-based comedy/drama with a starry, ensemble cast including LaKeith Stanfield, Omar Sy, RJ Cyler, David Oyelowo, Alfre Woodard and Teyana Taylor is not off to a promising start. The Legendary Pictures release opened to an estimated $2.6 million from just over 2,000 locations.\nWritten and directed by the British singer-songwriter Jeymes Samuel (stage name The Bullitts), it was self-consciously styled after Golden Age biblical epics like “The Ten Commandments.” It has also gotten mixed reviews, with 68% on Rotten Tomatoes and a B CinemaScore.\nThe Walt Disney Co. sent its 2020 Pixar film “Soul” to movie theaters this weekend as well, where it made $429,000 from 1350 locations in North America. It's the first of several Pixar movies, including “Luca\" and “Turning Red,” that Disney is bringing to theaters this winter after all had streaming-only releases on Disney+ during the pandemic.\nHollywood's awards season is also in full swing, and though many top contenders are already available to watch at home, some are still rolling out in theaters and hoping to capitalize on new nominations and awards shows like last weekend's Golden Globes. “Poor Things,” which was a big winner, added $1.8 million from only 580 theaters. “All of Us Strangers” took in $474,000 from 120 screens. “American Fiction” expanded nationwide and made $1.9 million from 625 screens. “The Zone of Interest,” playing on 25 screens, also crossed $1 million.\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Tuesday.\n1. “Mean Girls,” $28 million.\n2. “The Beekeeper,” $16.8 million.\n3. “Wonka,” $8.4 million.\n4. “Anyone But You,” $6.9 million.\n5. “Migration,” $6.2 million.\n6. “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” $5.3 million.\n7. “Night Swim,” $4.7 million.\n8. “The Boys in the Boat,” $3.5 million.\n9. “The Book of Clarence,”$2.6 million.\n10. “The Iron Claw,” $2.4 million.\n ",

    "text": "Researchers may be able to recover molecular traces in fossils of extinct species. These studies of new ways to explore these traces aim to expand our knowledge of the past of life on Earth, since DNA is very fragile. Researchers have identified that this can be achieved through proteins , which have greater longevity. What can we expect from this discovery? Learn all the details.\nEvolutionary connections in fossils revealed by ancient proteins Scientists in recent years have made progress in finding ancient DNA in fossils, gaining insight into organisms that lived long ago. But the oldest DNA obtained so far dates back about two million years. Proteins, a cell’s molecular machinery, also offer valuable information and have the virtue of surviving much longer, as new research shows.\nScientists have now extracted and sequenced proteins from dental fossils of extinct rhinoceroses, elephants and hippopotamuses, including from a rhino tooth 21-24 million years old. Separate research teams found protein fragments in fossils from vastly different environments – the frigid High Arctic of Canada and a scorching rift valley in Kenya.\n“Together, these complementary projects demonstrate that proteins – fundamental building blocks of living organisms that preserve information about evolutionary history – can be found in ancient fossils the world over,” said Harvard University evolutionary biologist Daniel Green, lead author of the Kenya fossils study published in the journal Nature. This opens a new frontier for probing the deep evolutionary past, including the human lineage and perhaps even dinosaurs.\n“Ancient proteins can tell us about an organism’s evolutionary history by providing molecular data from specimens too old for DNA preservation. This allows researchers to clarify evolutionary relationships across the tree of life, even for species that went extinct millions of years ago,” said Ryan Sinclair Paterson, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Copenhagen’s Globe Institute and lead author of the Canada fossil study in Nature.\nNew discoveries expand frontiers The ability and feasibility of recovering proteins, even from ancient fossils and under extreme environmental conditions, reinforces the precision of the techniques applied and points to even greater potential for future research. This is relevant when considering situations in which DNA cannot survive, opening up new possibilities.\nDNA and proteins are fragile and degrade over time, but proteins are more resilient. The oldest-known DNA is from organisms that lived in Greenland two million years ago. Until now, the oldest-known proteins preserved well enough to offer insight on evolutionary relationships were about four million years old , from the Canadian Arctic. The new research pushes the boundaries of ancient protein research, a field called paleoproteomics, back by millions of years.\nProteins were obtained from teeth of five rhino, elephant and hippo species that lived 1.5–18 million years ago in Kenya’s Turkana region. The proteins showed the ties between the ancient animals and their modern-day relatives. Proteins also were extracted from a fragment of a tooth of an extinct rhino unearthed at a site called Haughton Crater in Nunavut, Canada’s northernmost territory, that was up to 24 million years old. They showed how this species fit into the rhino family tree.\nProteins have allowed us to identify specific biochemical characteristics of the animals in these fossils, such as environmental adaptations, dietary habits, and evolutionary relationships. Proteins become a reliable source of molecular information in paleontological contexts and consolidate this field as a very promising one.\nFossil research beyond DNA Advances in fossil studies, thanks to the recent extraction of proteins, mark a new era in the search for information about the past, expanding research beyond the use of DNA . It becomes an important tool for modern science, with the potential to decipher the oldest mysteries of life on Earth.",

    "title": "Katt Williams' Reason For Adopting So Many Of His Kids",
    "text": "Katt Williams' Reason For Adopting So Many Of His Kids Contrary to the scene from \"School Dance\" that's [gone viral on TikTok multiple times](https://www.tiktok.com/@gabriel__951/video/6986501426251926786?lang=en), in which [Katt Williams'](https://www.nickiswift.com/11684/worried-katt-williams-future/) character asks whose white baby that is, the star remains well aware of the grind of fatherhood. As a comedian, Williams is known for keeping it real, so it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that he's open about his big role as a dad. He has one biological child named Micah with his ex-wife Quadriah Locus, who had several other children prior to her relationship with Williams. Even though they aren't biologically his, Williams adopted his son's half-siblings, so he actually has 10 kids. It had long been thought that Williams had eight kids, per [BCK Online](https://bckonline.com/2024/01/04/how-many-kids-does-katt-williams-have-and-how-many-are-adopted/). Williams, who had a difficult childhood, faced homelessness as a teenager, according to [The Grio](https://thegrio.com/2023/07/11/how-katt-williams-became-one-of-the-goats-after-a-very-hard-childhood/). He's seen firsthand how hard life can be for kids who are helpless against a cruel world. So what compelled the millionaire comedian to adopt so many kids and cultivate such a large family? Katt Williams wanted to save the kids from hardship Before he made it to the big time, Katt Williams met with struggle. He was homeless for a while and made a promise to himself that if he ever became famous, with the means to, he would help other people, per [Howard Stern](https://www.howardstern.com/show/2006/11/30/the-price-of-protection-rundowngallerymodel-11107/). In an interview with the \"Club Shay Shay\" podcast (per [BCK Online](https://bckonline.com/2024/01/04/how-many-kids-does-katt-williams-have-and-how-many-are-adopted/)), Williams said he wanted to protect his son Micah's half-siblings from the foster care system and did so by adopting them. While his adoption of so many kiddos was an honorable thing to do, he also acknowledged that he was far from perfect. \"I didn't do good by leading by example, but behind the scenes, that's never what I was pushing. They understood that because of my stance, there was a certain thing that would come my way,\" he said on the podcast. \"And so accountability and responsibility is part of what you are teaching. Even if you are doing the greatest thing in the world, there is thing called no good deed goes unpunished.\" Later on, he told the podcast that his notion of parenthood is to do better for your kids than your parents did for you. A nanny tried to take Katt Williams' daughter In 2011, Katt Williams temporarily lost custody of his adopted daughter Leanne. According to [BET](https://www.bet.com/article/oulmvn/katt-williams-gets-his-kid-back), this happened when the girl's nanny falsely claimed to be the girl's biological mother. Williams' former nanny, Crystal McGhee, asserted that she was Leanne's mother, and when Williams missed the court date, the court gave custody of the girl to McGhee. It was only after Williams filed paperwork to disprove McGhee's claims that Leanne was returned, per the outlet. When Williams lost custody, TMZ broke the news with exclusive access to the court documents. At the time of the custody kerfuffle, Leanne was just 8 years old, per [TMZ](https://www.tmz.com/2011/11/18/katt-williams-loses-child-custody/). According to [TMZ's reporting](https://www.tmz.com/2011/12/10/katt-williams-nanny-custody-crystal-mcghee/), it took nearly a month for Williams to sort out the legal issues to regain custody of his daughter. The outlet also said that McGhee had not worked for Williams for years leading up to the custody battle. It was asserted that McGhee's attempt for custody likely stemmed from the ability to gain governmental benefits given by the state of California, per TMZ.",

    "text": "Researchers have unveiled a new technology that will help wind turbines run more efficiently, allowing them to bring in more energy more quickly and reduce wear and tear on the machines.\nAccording to Interesting Eng ineering , scientists at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have partnered with Renewable Energy Systems to create the Dynamic Yaw system for turbines.\nCurrently, turbines operate individually. This means there is a detailed analysis of how each turbine is performing, and each turbine can decide how it needs to position for maximum effectiveness, but there's no collective data or decision-making in real time.\nDynamic Yaw seeks to change that by bringing more automation to the process by which turbines move toward the wind. In other words, it accounts for the wakes of other turbines, potential short-lived turbulence that could waste time and energy moving turbines to chase, and other factors to maximize the efficiency of the wind farm.\n\"The 'Dynamic Yaw' technology will help wind asset owners optimize the overall output of their assets through better utilization of their data and subsequent autonomous action of the asset,\" RES VP of Digital Solutions Alex Bamberger said, per Interesting Engineering .\nThe new technology is so efficient that it is the equivalent of adding between one and three more turbines to a 100-turbine farm, according to the report.\nWatch now: Expert shares one belief that 'two thirds' of the US population across the political spectrum hold Wind energy has been in a boom in recent years, as technology has continued to make leaps and bounds forward. MIT researchers have created new aerodynamic models for turbines to help improve efficiency, and floating, offshore wind farms dubbed \"the future\" of green energy have begun cropping up off the coast of the United Kingdom.\nNREL also recently discovered a new, more recyclable material for building turbines, allowing the process to become more cyclical and less of a burden on resources.\nUltimately, NREL and RES believe that the new Dynamic Yaw technology will help push us closer to a greener future.\n\"This technology isn't a science project anymore,\" Bamberger said in a press release . \"It's real and able to help customers reach net zero much faster.\"\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future , and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "text": "People across the East End, and indeed much of the northern part of the United States, were treated to a vivid display of the aurora borealis on Thursday night, prompting many to look out their windows, pull over their cars, post pictures on Instagram, and wonder: Why? Essentially, the northern lights, or aurora borealis, are created when high-speed particles from the sun \"excite gases in the upper atmosphere,\" usually oxygen and nitrogen, said Jeffrey Katz, a member of the advisory board for the Hamptons Observatory. \"So basically, the ionized gas causes the glow.\" For the lights to be visible this far south, \"you need a more intense reaction, and that usually means when you get a big solar storm,\" Dr. Katz said, and a solar flare is typically involved. When there is a mass ejection from the sun, \"those particles interact with particles in the earth's atmosphere, and it can give off the lights that we saw,\" said James Tomasini, a meteorologist with the regional branch of the National Weather Service, based in Upton. In fact, the colors can depend on which particles interact. A coronal mass ejection was detected on Tuesday, Oct. 8, Mr. Tomasini said, and scientists determined that it was likely to arrive on Oct. 10. As for whether the lights will be visible again Friday night, Dr. Katz was optimistic, but Mr. Tomasini had some doubts, based on the Space Weather Prediction Center's estimates. \"The geomagnetic storm we saw last night reached level 4, so the higher the level, the further south you can see the northern lights. Right now, they're predicting down to a level 2 for the rest of today,\" Mr. Tomasini said on Friday afternoon. Nonetheless, he said that he was not positive about the predictions. \"It's supposed to be possible again tonight,\" said Dr. Katz, who remembers seeing the northern lights in 1967.",

    "text": "Política 28-12-2023 18:53 - \"Impone la flexibilización laboral\" El Partido Justicialista criticó con dureza la Ley Ómnibus impulsada por el Gobierno A través de un comunicado, el espacio que dirige el expresidente Alberto Fernández, advirtió que esa norma \"avasalla derechos adquiridos y condena a los argentinos a una crisis más profunda\" y acusó al jefe de Estado de pretender \"apropiarse del Poder Legislativo, pisoteando la Constitución Nacional y la división de poderes\". El Partido Justicialista (PJ), que conduce el expresidente Alberto Fernández, advirtió este jueves que la ley ómnibus enviada al Congreso por el Gobierno de Javier Milei \"avasalla derechos adquiridos y condena a los argentinos a una crisis más profunda\", y acusó al jefe de Estado de pretender \"apropiarse de las facultades del Poder Legislativo, pisoteando la Constitución Nacional y la división de poderes\". A través de un comunicado, el Justicialismo rechazó el proyecto de ley oficial al considerar que \"que profundiza y amplía el inconstitucional DNU 70/2023 que establece una profunda desregulación de la economía, deroga múltiples leyes laborales y allana el camino a la privatización de las empresas públicas, lo cual representa una pérdida de derechos y de soberanía para los argentinos\". Para el PJ, \"lejos de plantear una solución a la grave situación que atraviesa nuestro país\", el proyecto enviado \"agrava los problemas de los argentinos imponiendo un programa de flexibilización laboral, impositiva y ambiental que ya ha sido aplicado en otros momentos de la historia, y que provocó enormes tragedias sociales\". El peronismo denunció que Milei pretende \"apropiarse de las facultades del Poder Legislativo, pisoteando la Constitución Nacional y la división de poderes\", además de \"reducir la representación de las provincias en el Congreso, dando por tierra con la paridad de género y la multiplicidad de voces\". La ley ómnibus avasalla derechos adquiridos y condena a los argentinos a una crisis más profunda.— Partido Justicialista (@p_justicialista) [pic.twitter.com/EwFkmAV84D] [December 28, 2023] El paquete de iniciativas oficiales también \"remarca la primarización de la canasta exportable; eleva las retenciones a los derivados de soja; pone en venta el patrimonio de todos los argentinos y argentinas privatizando las empresas públicas, y habilita al Gobierno nacional a endeudarse sin necesidad de consultar al Congreso\". \"También justifica el despido de miles de trabajadores del sector público que actualmente sostienen políticas públicas que resultan esenciales para garantizar derechos, permite la entrada de tropas extranjeras al país sin autorización del Congreso, dispone la transferencia de los activos del Fondo de Garantía y Sustentabilidad de Anses al Tesoro Nacional para utilizar la plata de todos los jubilados en la timba financiera; y elimina la fórmula jubilatoria para establecer aumentos discrecionalmente por decreto\".",
