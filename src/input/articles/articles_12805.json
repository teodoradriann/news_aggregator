    "title": "Japanese Astronaut To Make Lunar History With NASA Artemis Mission: Here's How",
    "text": "A Japanese astronaut is about to make lunar history! US President Joe Biden shared that a Japanese astronaut will be the first non-American to walk on the moon in an upcoming NASA Artemis mission. At a press conference with Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Biden mentioned that two Japanese astronauts will join upcoming American missions, with one making history as the first non-American to land on the moon.\nNASA NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a blog, \"America no longer will walk on the Moon alone. With this new rover, we will uncover groundbreaking discoveries on the lunar surface that will benefit humanity and inspire the Artemis Generation.\" Japan's Prime Minister Kishida praised this as a 'huge achievement' and revealed Japan's commitment to provide a rover for the program.\nWhat Is Pressurized Rover Provided By Japan?\nJapan's rover will be pressurized. This means it will allow astronauts to travel longer distances and work for extended periods in diverse geographical areas on the moon's surface. NASA confirmed that it will accommodate two astronauts for up to 30 days, enabling them to live and work for extended periods while exploring the region near the lunar South Pole. NASA's current plan is to use the pressurized rover on Artemis VII and subsequent missions over an approximate lifespan of 10 years.\nAbout NASA Artemis II Mission\nIt must be noted that so far, only 12 people have been to walk on the moon through NASA's Apollo program from 1969 to 1972 and all of them were American. The U.S. Artemis program aims to send astronauts back to the moon by as early as late 2025, with the initial landing planned for its third mission in 2026. The Artemis 2 crew, consisting of four members, includes the first woman, the first person of colour, and the first non-American to journey to the moon, who happens to be Canadian.\nThe four astronauts who will fly around the moon for the Artemis II mission are:\nJeremy Hansen, mission specialist - the first Japanese astronaut to walk on the Moon\nVictor Glover, pilot\nReid Wiseman, commander\nChristina Hammock Koch, mission specialist.",

    "text": "The enthusiasm behind Kamala Harris' campaign will surely get under Donald Trump's skin. Aug. 8, 2024, 8:51 PM UTC By Mika Brzezinski, co-host of \"Morning Joe\" and founder of “Know Your Value\" This is an adapted excerpt of the Aug. 8 episode of \"Morning Joe.\"\nThe recent attacks from Republicans targeting Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s military career are just a small part of a much larger theme within the Trump-Vance campaign — a campaign that feasts on dishonesty and disinformation.\nThey do that to deflect from a record where the cruelty, the violence , the antidemocratic values , the disrespect for our Constitution is the entire point. That’s who they are and that’s what they want to distract from.\nThey do that to deflect from a record where the cruelty, the violence, the antidemocratic values, the disrespect for our Constitution is the entire point.\nAnd to do so, they are trying to tear two very positive, joyful and energetic people down.\nKamala Harris and Tim Walz are riding a high right now. Their best strategy is just to keep moving forward and deflect the disinformation that comes their way. But they also need to embrace the joy — which you see them doing.\nJust look at the crowds they’re attracting . There has been a burst of energy and enthusiasm. You have people waiting out in the hot sun for hours. When you have to move a rally to an airport hangar , and that’s not even big enough, you’re onto something.\nHarris isn’t on a roll just with her vice presidential pick, it’s her entire campaign.\nWe know Donald Trump depends on crowd size for his own sense of value. We saw that from his very first event as president, his inauguration, where he had to lie about it .\nClearly crowd size is very important to the former president , so what we’re seeing from Harris and Walz will, no doubt, be very scary to the Trump campaign moving forward.\nAnd it doesn’t look like their crowds will be getting smaller anytime soon.\nMika Brzezinski Mika Brzezinski is the co-host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, founder of “Know Your Value” and author of four best-selling books, including “EARN IT!: Know Your Value and Grow Your Career, in Your 20s and Beyond” (Hachette Books; May 7, 2019) with co-author Daniela Pierre-Bravo. Prior to joining MSNBC in 2007, Mika was an anchor of CBS Evening News Weekend Edition and a CBS News correspondent who frequently contributed to CBS Sunday Morning and 60 Minutes.\nAllison Detzel contributed.",
