    "title": "Celtics Coach Joe Mazzulla Makes A Statement Ahead Of Showdown Against The 2-28 Detroit Pistons",
    "text": "Amid a historic losing streak, the Detroit Pistons are dying for a win to avoid further humiliation this season. Unfortunately, with a game against the top seed in the East, the losing streak is unlikely to end tonight and it should be an easy win for the Celtics . Despite the Pistons' record, however, Cs coach Joe Mazzulla was careful not to underestimate their competition. \"I think there's the expectation that it's supposed to go a certain way or it's supposed to be easy and that's just not the case,\" argued Mazz . \"Just playing the game regardless of the other team's record and I think sometimes you get caught up in this team should be up by this much at first quarter, half-time, and that's just not how it works. It’s an NBA game, they’re NBA players, they’re healthy, they’re playing really hard, and they’ve been in a lot of games. So we have to have the same mindset we've been playing with the stretch of good basketball we've been playing.\" The Celtics are 23-6 entering tonight's game against Detroit and are on track to finish with the best record in the league. Against a team this bad, the Cs should have no problem coming out with the win but stranger things have happened in the NBA and they aren't about to get caught sleeping. Looking at the Pistons, this season has been an utter disaster. Despite the kind words from Joe Mazzulla, they've been the laughingstock of the league so far, and their 27-game losing streak has become a national story. But with a win out of the question for tonight, when might this historic streak finally end? After Boston on Thursday, the Pistons will face the Raptors, Rockets, Jazz, and Warriors. Their most winnable game, however, isn't until January 10th against the San Antonio Spurs . At home against the worst team in the West, Detroit might actually have a chance to earn a victory but then again, they've already lost to the Wizards, Trail Balzers, and injury-riddled Utah Jazz this season. The biggest question in Detroit right now is who is to blame for their ongoing struggles. The players themselves are responsible for the slide and their youth and inexperience have led to an abundance of mistakes on the court. But it's the Pistons front office who may be the most guilty for this run. They've done very little to improve the roster over the years and have whiffed on countless draft picks despite landing in the lottery year after year. Some fans have even blamed head coach Monty Williams for the performance, citing questionable rotations as a sign that he's not cut out for the job. Regardless of who is to blame here, there has to be some level of accountability on the Pistons and they may never get out of this funk until some changes are made. Tonight, they have the chance to stop the bleeding right here and now but this team just doesn't have enough to compete with the best of the best.

    "text": "FWO accuses firm of not complying with Compliance Notice for backpay The [Fair Work Ombudsman](https://www.hcamag.com/au/companies/fair-work-ombudsman/148608) (FWO) has launched legal action against a Sydney-based business that allegedly underpaid a Chinese visa holder. The FWO is accusing Open Close It Pty Ltd of failing to comply with a Compliance Notice that ordered it to calculate and backpay the employee's entitlements. According to the FWO, the employee, who worked on a full-time basis as a roller blinds manufacturer between July 2021 and February 2022, is owed at least $3,482. This includes [underpaid minimum wages](https://www.hcamag.com/au/specialisation/employment-law/jcu-confirms-underpaying-casual-employees/485805) and overtime rates owed under the Manufacturing and Associated Industries and Occupations Award 2020. Its sole director, Nicholas Paxinos, is also facing the court for his involvement in the contravention, according to the FWO. A hearing is set on May 17 at the Federal Circuit and Family Court in Sydney. Penalties sought for alleged non-compliance For its non-compliance with the Compliance Notice, the FWO is seeking penalties in court against Open Close It and its director of up to $41,250 and $8,250, respectively. It is also asking the court to order the company to [rectify the alleged underpayment](https://www.hcamag.com/au/specialisation/employment-law/fwo-sues-melbourne-chinese-school-over-alleged-underpayments/486579) in full, in addition to interest and superannuation. \"Where employers do not comply, we will take appropriate action to protect employees. A court can order a business to pay penalties in addition to back-paying workers,\" said Acting [Fair Work Ombudsman](/au/companies/fair-work-ombudsman/148608) Michael Campbell [in a statement](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/newsroom/media-releases/2024-media-releases/april-2024/20240422-open-close-it-litigation-media-release). According to Campbell, visa holders have the same rights as all other workers, and it is the FWO's priority to protect them. \"Any employees with concerns about their pay or entitlements should contact the Fair Work Ombudsman for free assistance,\" Campbell said.",

    "text": "Gerard Butler is set to reprise his role as Stoick the Vast in the upcoming live-action\nHow To Train Your Dragon remake. Deadline has reported that Butler will indeed play the live-action version of Stoick the Vast — the father of franchise protagonist Hiccup. The actor voiced said character in all three of the animated films, meaning he will have played the role in both animated and live-action mediums. Butler is joining Mason Thames and Nico Parker in the remake, who will be playing Hiccup and Astrid, respectively.\nHow to Train Your Dragon is produced by Marc Platt Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures. Dean DeBlois, the writer and director for all three movies in the animated trilogy, will also be the writer and director of the remake.\nThe How to Train Your Dragon franchise is based on Cressida Cowell’s children’s book series of the same name. Cowell’s original story centered around Hiccup, a young aspiring inventor who wants to make his Viking father proud by becoming a dragon slayer. Things don’t go as planned when Hiccup finds himself unexpectedly forming a bond with a Night Fury dragon.\nHow many How To Train Your Dragon movies are there?\nFollowing the success of the 2010 film, it was followed by two more sequels which all received critical acclaim in multiple Oscar nominations including Best Animated Feature. The animated films featured the voices of\nJay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, America Ferrera, Craig Ferguson, Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig, Cate Blanchett, Kit Harington, and more. The franchise is a box office success, with a combined worldwide gross of over $1.6 billion.",

    "text": "A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected.\nAccording to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement.\nMolldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up.\nTreatment called 'inconceivable' Gypsy Rose Blanchard released from Missouri prison early Thursday morning, DOC confirms Cher files for conservatorship of her son, claims Elijah Blue Allman's life is 'at risk' Ex-boyfriend of missing St. Louis woman admits to her murder after Wisconsin arrest: Police 6 dead, 3 injured in Johnson County, Texas, crash; victims include 2 young kids ages 9, 10 California Pizza Huts lay off all delivery drivers ahead of minimum wage increase “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit.\nGoldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment.\n\"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.”\nDoctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.\nThe lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg.\n“Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote.\nWilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages.\nWilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "Firenze, tra i bambini scampati all'inferno di Gaza - Famiglia Cristiana",
    "text": "-->\nUn piccolo gruppo di palestinesi della Striscia di Gaza, circa 320 persone, in maggioranza donne e bambini, è arrivato in Italia, con un \"corridoio sanitario\" e ospitato in alcune strutture ricettive di Firenze. Sono tantissimi i minori, alcuni bimbi ancora in fasce, altri poco più grandi, gravemente feriti dalle bombe e dai missili che si abbattono sulla Striscia di Gaza ogni giorno. Tra di loro ci sono anche malati che non potevano più essere curati negli ospedali di Gaza, resi inagibili dopo i bombardamenti, privi di medicinali, di energia elettrica, di macchinari e carenti di personale sanitario, in parte ucciso nei raid israeliani. Per ogni bambino, c’è un solo genitore o parente.\nQualcuno tra questi piccoli non ha più la mamma. Tutti hanno perso più di un familiare a causa della guerra e tutti hanno almeno uno dei genitori rimasto ancora nella Striscia, insieme ai propri fratelli e sorelle. Sono arrivati nel silenzio più totale, tenuti lontani dai riflettori, ma sono arrivati e sono vivi. Sono anche i testimoni viventi di una guerra senza senso, come tutte le guerre. Ci raccontano la loro storia, quella dei familiari e degli amici cancellati dalle bombe: anche i bambini molto piccoli ce la raccontano, alcuni solo con gli occhi, o con i segni della violenza sul corpo, il solo documento che possiedono. Sono gli eredi dei loro cari uccisi, che si portano appresso. Sono loro “gli effetti collaterali” della guerra, le vittime innocenti dei bombardamenti che hanno devastato, da nord a sud, l’intera Striscia di Gaza, cancellandone l’esistenza e seminando morte, sofferenza, povertà.\nCome già accaduto in tante altre terribili vicende umane, anche la vita del popolo di Gaza ha un prezzo: 7 mila dollari un adulto, cinque mila un bambino da salvare. I parenti e gli amici che vivono altrove raccolgono soldi, ipotecano la casa per avere un prestito consistente da permettere loro di “comprare” più vite possibili, quella degli imprigionati a Gaza, spesso usati come scudi umani dai terroristi di Hamas, segregati senza cibo e senza acqua all’interno di un luogo che viene ogni giorno martoriato da bombe e missili dell'esercito di Israele. Chi paga, esce, e si salva.\n«Per favore, aiutami a far venire qui mio padre», chiede una ragazzina, arrivata in Italia. «Ho mia figlia che sta molto male, ha bisogno di cure urgenti e lì non la possono curare, aiutami», implora una madre. Intorno ai profughi arrivati a Firenze si radunano i “giusti” del presente, quei volontari che li coprono con gli indumenti e con il proprio calore umano e quei medici, infermieri, personale sanitario che si adopera per curare le ferite non solo quelle del corpo, ma anche della loro anima disperata. Ci sono le istituzioni pubbliche e del Terzo settore che si impegnano perché siano riconosciuti il più velocemente possibile i loro diritti di profughi. Tutto ciò non potrà, certo, colmare il dolore che si portano dentro, né restituirà loro quello che hanno perso per sempre insieme agli affetti più cari, che potranno custodire soltanto nel proprio cuore.\nL’attrice Anna Foglietta, presidente dell’associazione “Every child is my child” (”Ogni bambino è il mio bambino”) è andata ad assistere nella città del Giglio gli ospiti palestinesi per essere loro vicino e capire come si possa, oggi, aiutare una popolazione di oltre 2 milioni di persone, con un elevato numero di bambini, quasi la metà degli abitanti di Gaza, che soffrono le conseguenze della guerra a seguito dell’attacco terroristico di Hamas contro i civili israeliani del 7 ottobre 2023. «La Striscia di Gaza continua a essere un luogo di profonda sofferenza umanitaria, dove migliaia di persone affrontano quotidianamente sfide insormontabili», dice a nome di “Every Child is my Child” e chiede una immediata azione da parte della comunità e delle autorità locali e internazionale per far arrivare gli aiuti umanitari e garantire un sostegno vitale alla popolazione della Striscia.\nParliamo con Anna mentre si intrattiene con i profughi palestinesi che le raccontano il loro dramma e gioca con loro. Commuovono gli occhi di questi bambini, brillano di speranza e di luce, ma si intravede l’ombra della loro sofferenza. Visto dall’alto, sembra un momento come un altro, in cui adulti e bambini giocano, sorridono, scherzano. Ma non è un momento come un altro. Non sono storie come altre. Sono storie sgretolate dalla guerra, che hanno bisogno lentamente di ricostruirsi. Difficile farlo mentre amici e parenti sono morti, muoiono, soffrono. La rete di volontari, operatori, medici, associazioni sta facendo un lavoro silenzioso e potente. Chi salva una vita salva il mondo intero, recita il Talmud, e loro lo stanno salvando.\n«Secondo UNICEF quasi 14 mila bambini hanno perso la vita a causa diretta di questo conflitto», spiega l'Attrice, «e ora cominciano a morire anche per malattie causate dalla carenza di cibo e di acqua. Non possiamo voltare le spalle alla sofferenza umana. È ora che la comunità internazionale agisca con determinazione e solidarietà per portare sollievo alla popolazione della Striscia di Gaza», conclude.",

    "text": "Mehr als 122 Millionen Menschen weltweit auf der Flucht\nKrieg, Gewalt und Verfolgung: Die Zahl der Flüchtlinge weltweit ist in einem Jahr um zwei Millionen gestiegen.\nMehr als 122 Millionen Menschen sind weltweit auf der Flucht vor Krieg, Gewalt und Verfolgung. Damit stieg die Zahl laut Weltflüchtlingsbericht der Vereinten Nationen binnen Jahresfrist um rund zwei Millionen an. Hauptursachen seien große Konflikte wie im Sudan, in Myanmar und in der Ukraine, erklärte das Flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR in Genf zur Veröffentlichung am Donnerstag.\nSeit einem Jahrzehnt habe sich das Ausmaß der globalen Flüchtlingskrise immer weiter verschärft. Ende April seien insgesamt 122,1 Millionen Kinder, Frauen und Männer vertrieben gewesen. Doch während sich die Zahl der gewaltsam vertriebenen Menschen in den letzten zehn Jahren fast verdoppelt habe, sei die Finanzierung für das UNHCR heute in etwa auf demselben Niveau wie 2015. Die anhaltenden Kürzungen der humanitären Hilfe seien unhaltbar und machten Menschen auf der Flucht noch verletzlicher.\nAppell von Flüchtlingskommissar Grandi\nFilippo Grandi, der UN-Hochkommissar für Flüchtlinge, forderte die Weltgemeinschaft auf, ihre diplomatischen Anstrengungen zu verdoppeln. Ziel müsse es sein, Frieden zu schaffen und dauerhafte Lösungen für Menschen auf der Flucht zu finden. Ein Hoffnungsschimmer sei die Rückkehr vieler geflüchteter Menschen in ihre Heimatregionen in Syrien in den vergangenen sechs Monaten nach jahrelangem Krieg und Massenvertreibungen.\nContent-Partnerschaft\nDieser Artikel entstand in einer Content-Partnerschaft mit dem Evangelischen Pressedienst (epd).\nAufgrund der Rückkehr in Heimatregionen oder -länder sank die Zahl der Vertriebenen laut UNHCR seit dem Jahreswechsel wieder etwas: Ende Dezember hatte sie einen Höchststand von 123,2 Millionen erreicht. Dabei nahmen die Binnenvertriebenen, die vor Konflikten innerhalb des eigenen Landes flüchten müssen, den größten Anteil ein. Ihre Zahl wuchs dem Bericht zufolge bis Ende 2024 um 6,3 Millionen auf 73,5 Millionen. Die Zahl der Flüchtlinge bezifferte das UNHCR Ende 2024 auf 42,7 Millionen. Flüchtlinge verlassen ihr eigenes Land und suchen Schutz in anderen Staaten.\nMit 14,3 Millionen Menschen auf der Flucht hat der Krieg im Sudan den Zahlen zufolge die inzwischen größte Vertreibungskrise der Welt verursacht. Dahinter folgen Syrien (13,5 Millionen Menschen), Afghanistan (10,3 Millionen Menschen) und die Ukraine (8,8 Millionen Menschen).",
