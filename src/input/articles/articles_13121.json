    "text": "What NATO Gave Ukraine Kyiv didn’t get an invite to join the alliance, but it left the summit with more weapons to fight Russia. Welcome back to Foreign Policy’s SitRep. It’s the last day of the NATO summit in Washington, D.C., which means the alliance’s communique —formally called the Washington Summit Declaration—is published, Russia and China are mad at NATO about it, and the allies are turning the final day of summit business to Ukraine before the barricades come up and traffic returns to normal in D.C. Welcome back to Foreign Policy’s SitRep. It’s the last day of the NATO summit in Washington, D.C., which means the alliance’s communique —formally called the Washington Summit Declaration—is published, Russia and China are mad at NATO about it, and the allies are turning the final day of summit business to Ukraine before the barricades come up and traffic returns to normal in D.C. Alright, here’s what’s on tap for the day: Ukraine leaves the NATO summit with an “irreversible” path to membership, former President Donald Trump wants to curb U.S. intelligence sharing with NATO if he returns to the White House, and the allies look to beef up their cyber and artificial intelligence capabilities. What Can NATO Do for Ukraine? Ukraine got a lot at the NATO summit—just not the one thing that it wanted. For months in the run-up to the confab, Ukraine and its strongest backers pushed for Kyiv to receive a formal invitation to join NATO. Washington and Berlin quashed those plans early on. So a lot of the summit’s work on Ukraine amounted to cobbling together consolation prizes for the country and filling long-standing gaps in its military aid requests, then tying it up as a major new support package. To be clear, some of these new pledges represent important military aid that could provide real support to Ukraine on the battlefield. These include new Patriot air defense systems (something that Ukraine asked for months ago and is now finally getting after a deadly Russian strike on a Ukrainian children’s hospital), F-16 fighter jets from Denmark and the Netherlands, and even a squadron of MiG-29 fighters from Poland. The Biden administration also championed what it called a “bridge” to NATO membership for Ukraine that will include ramping up joint training programs, creating a new NATO command structure to coordinate military aid flowing into Ukraine, and sending a permanent new alliance envoy to Kyiv. But several alliance officials from Eastern Europe, while putting on a smile in public, say they’re disappointed that NATO couldn’t do more—including extending Ukraine that coveted formal invitation to join the alliance. SitRep breaks down what Ukraine got at the Washington summit, by the numbers. 80. That’s the number of F-16 fighter jets that U.S. officials said Denmark and the Netherlands will eventually provide to Ukraine. The Danes will give 24 jets initially, and the Dutch will give 19, according to the Wall Street Journal. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken got the crowd at NATO’s public forum in Washington fired up when he announced that the first jets will get to Ukraine by the end of summer. And the U.S. administration said that Ukraine will be able to use the F-16’s air-to-air missiles to fire into Russia. Ukraine will also get a new squadron of Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland. That could help if Ukraine tries to mount another counteroffensive against Russian lines at some point, NATO officials said, as Kyiv lacked the airpower to support its last major forward military push in 2023. 40. NATO allies committed to give Ukraine 40 billion euros ($43.3 billion) in military aid over the next year, according to the summit communique. What they haven’t figured out yet is who is going to give what. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged 3 billion pounds (about $3.9 billion) and confirmed that Ukraine could use long-range Storm Shadow missiles against Russian territory. NATO also plans to set up a new command for Ukraine in Wiesbaden, Germany, that will coordinate and deconflict training and aid donations to the country and help with repairs, while the United States will continue to lead the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (also known as the Ramstein Format), where allies have made major aid pledges to Kyiv. The new NATO command will be led by a three-star U.S. general and have about 700 staff members, who will connect to weapons delivery points in Eastern Europe. There will also be a new NATO envoy permanently stationed in Kyiv. But there’s one thing that NATO can’t provide: boots on the ground. Dozens. The number of air defense batteries that NATO countries plan to give Ukraine. There’s a Patriot battery from Spain and components for one from Sweden. The United States, Germany, and Romania will send Ukraine additional Patriots, and the Netherlands and other countries will provide enough components to cobble together another battery. There’s also an alphabet soup of other air defense systems coming to Ukraine. Norway and Germany are giving an IRIS-T air defense battery, and Norway is giving Ukraine about $93 million for air defense needs. Italy is giving a SAMP-T air defense system. NATO countries are also pledging NASAMS, HAWKs, and Gepards. One. Enduring path to NATO membership—sort of. In the final NATO summit document, alliance leaders said Ukraine was on an “irreversible” path to NATO membership—but the carefully worded passage it was buried in blunted some of the excitement. After lauding the country for making progress on the “required democratic, economic, and security reforms,” the statement reads: “As Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership. We reaffirm that we will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met.” Andriy Yermak, the chief of Ukraine’s presidential cabinet, said onstage at the NATO Public Forum on the sidelines of the summit that he and the Ukrainian people were “happy” with the results of the summit. “The language of the documents, it’s really strong,” he said. “We can see that the alliance made the real steps forward. I think that the next stop is [that] Ukraine needs to receive the invitation.” When asked whether the “bridge” to NATO brings Ukraine closer, Yermak paused for a full six seconds. “Hmmmm,” he finally said, giving out a slight sigh. “When you’re living in the war, you have a little bit different [of a] ceiling,” he said. On the Button What should be high on your radar, if it isn’t already. Intel blackout. Former U.S. President Donald Trump is considering cutting U.S. intelligence-sharing with NATO members if he returns to the White House, Politico reports , part of a raft of measures that the one-time commander in chief’s advisors are considering to cut support to the 32-nation alliance. The plans, which were conveyed to senior European officials by Trump advisors, came up on the sidelines of the NATO summit, and both U.S. and European officials fear that it could hinder Europe’s ability to defend against another Russian attack if the Kremlin moves its military gaze beyond Ukraine. Crisis averted. The United States and Germany foiled a Russian government plot to kill the boss of German weapons maker Rheinmetall earlier this year, CNN https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/us-germany-foiled-russian-assassination-plot/index.html. The plot was one of a series of planned actions by Russian intelligence services to assassinate defense industry executives as part of a wider covert campaign of sabotage operations across Europe. Artificial intelligence. NATO is looking to coordinate its collective AI capabilities while placing shared guardrails around the technology as it grapples with the high-tech arms race against the likes of Russia and China. “We work … very closely with NATO specifically on how we actually have digital transformation in a responsible way,” Radha Iyengar Plumb, the Pentagon’s chief digital and artificial intelligence officer, told our colleague Rishi Iyengar onstage at the FP Security Forum . Plumb pointed to alliance initiatives such as the Data and AI Review Board and its Responsible AI Toolkits, both of which set out a baseline for the responsible adoption of such tools. It’s an effort to embed NATO countries’ shared democratic values in the adoption of technology, Plumb added, especially as adversaries such as China and Russia race to develop their own capabilities. “I don’t think there is a silver bullet here that’s going to help us ensure that everyone adheres to the same guidelines and guardrails,” she said. “There’s a real case to be made for the values that underlie how we use and adopt that technology, and that’s where the U.S. and our allies in NATO are really looking to lay out explicitly.” Cyber alliances everywhere. The war in Ukraine, which has showcased Russia’s advanced hacking capabilities such as malware targeting energy facilities and cyberattacks against Kyiv’s government systems, has driven home the increasing role of cyber in hybrid warfare and the constant borderless battles taking place in cyberspace. NATO used its summit communique to warn of cyber threats from not only Russia, but also China, including the prospect of the two countries working together as part of their growing strategic partnership. NATO is countering with cyber alliances of its own, establishing a new Integrated Cyber Defense Centre while expanding cyber cooperation in the Indo-Pacific with partners such as Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. Private sector companies that have faced the brunt of Russian and Chinese hacking efforts warn that such operations are expanding in both scale and scope. “We’re seeing nation-state actors operate across the world in cyberspace, and we don’t see that threat vector going down anytime soon,” Robert Blair, Microsoft’s general manager for national security and emerging technologies, told an audience at the summit. Microsoft’s systems and users worldwide face more than 345 million cyberattacks every day, he said, and 40 percent of nation-state cyberattacks worldwide target critical infrastructure systems. “And these attacks are not just prolific—they’re becoming more advanced,” he added.

Quote of the Day “The Washington Summit Declaration of July 10 mentions ‘the irreversible path of Ukraine’ to NATO. For Russia, 2 possible ways of how this path ends are acceptable: either Ukraine disappears, or NATO does. Still better, both.” – Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev lashes out at both NATO and Ukraine in response to the summit communique.

    "text": "Huge surf pounds West Coast and Hawaii, flooding some low-lying areas\nPowerful surf is rolling onto beaches on the West Coast and Hawaii as a big swell generated by the stormy Pacific Ocean pushes toward shorelines\nLOS ANGELES -- Powerful surf rolled onto beaches on the West Coast and\nHawaii on Thursday as a big swell generated by the stormy Pacific Ocean pushed toward shorelines, causing localized flooding.\nForecasters urged people to stay off rocks and jetties, and to not turn their backs to the ocean because of the danger of “sneaker waves” — occasional much bigger waves that can run far up the sand and wash someone off a beach.\nA high surf warning for parts of Northern California said waves would range from 28 to 33 feet (8.5 to 10 meters) and up to 40 feet (12 meters) at some locations, the National Weather Service said, adding that there were reports of flooding in low-lying coastal areas.\nIn Aptos on the north end of Monterey Bay, surf overran the beach and swept into a parking lot, leaving the area strewn with debris. Santa Cruz County issued warnings for people in several coastal areas to be ready to evacuate.\n“Mother Nature’s angry,” said Eve Krammer, an Aptos resident for several years. \"I mean these waves are gnarly. They’re huge.”\nThe same area was battered by the ocean last January as the West Coast was slammed by numerous atmospheric rivers.\n“I feel for the people that are down low here,” said Jeff Howard, also an Aptos resident.\nWhile not quite as huge, the waves along Southern California were also described as hazardous, with life-threatening rip currents. Nonetheless, surfers couldn't resist.\nPatience was key, according to Alex Buford, 27, who was catching waves just north of Manhattan Beach on the Los Angeles County coast.\n“I was waiting for awhile because the waves were really sick, and they're kinda hard to get into even though I have a really big board,” he said. “Just waited for a good one and I got it and it was a long one. Pretty big. It was sick.”\nIn\nHawaii, the weather service forecast surf rising to 30 to 40 feet (9 to 12 meters) along north-facing shores and 18 to 22 feet (5.5 to 6.7 meters) along west-facing shores of five islands.\nProfessional Hawaii surfer Sheldon Paishon was getting ready to surf Thursday morning at Makaha, a world-famous surfing beach on Oahu’s west side.\nPaishon, 30, has been surfing at various spots around Oahu this week, taking advantage of waves during this week’s high surf warning in effect till Friday morning.\n“It’s always big waves in the winter time in Hawaii,” he said.\nHe warned that novice surfers should check with lifeguards before heading into the water and “make sure you got some people around you and stay safe.”\nHonolulu Ocean Safety lifeguards, posted at beaches across Oahu, rescued 20 people along the island’s famed North Shore on Wednesday, said spokesperson Shayne Enright. They were also busy with thousands of “preventative actions,” she said.\n“This time of year produces incredible surf but it can also be very dangerous,” she said.\nThe dangerous surf could also cause surges that could hit coastal properties and roadways, the weather service warned.\n___\nJennifer Sinco Kelleher reported from Honolulu.",

    "text": "A former detective inspector who oversaw securing the largest restraint of funds in New Zealand Police history - $140 million - is one of the officers receiving a New Year Honours.\nThree former and current police personnel are receiving 2024 New Year Honours for their work in asset recovery, disaster victim identification and Search and Rescue.\nFormer detective inspector Craig Hamilton, now working on contract with the Financial Crime Group after retiring from police in September, is made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit (ONZM).\nHe joined the New Zealand Police in 1998 and is recognised nationally and internationally as an expert in asset recovery, which he has specialised in for the past 22 years.\nHamilton played a key role in influencing law, specifically police input into The Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009 (CPRA) and helped authorities to develop regulations to support the Act.\nHe took over leadership of the Waikato Proceeds of Crime Unit in 2002 and from 2009 headed the newly formed Waikato-based Asset Recovery Unit (ARU).\nDuring his tenure, police secured $140 million as part of an international money laundering investigation, the largest restraint of funds in New Zealand Police history.\nHamilton also oversaw an operation leading to the forfeiture of $70 million, New Zealand's largest forfeiture under the CPRA.\nReceiving the award was very much unexpected, he said.\n\"This is a real honour for me and my family. I've had an amazing experience in my policing career - it's been absolutely fantastic and very rewarding.\"\nHamilton said much credit for his achievements goes to the people he has worked with.\nTāmaki Makaurau forensic photography and reprographics manager senior sergeant Karl Wilson is made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit (MNZM).\nHe joined the forensic photography team in 1998 and took his skills into the disaster victim identification (DVI) field in 2004.\nWilson has worked at significant disaster sites including tsunamis in 2004 and 2009, Australian Bush Fires, the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the Malaysian Airline MH17 plane crash, and the 2019 Christchurch terror attack.\nHe has developed national systems to record the last remains of the deceased and ensure the imagery is preserved and stored with integrity and has delivered DVI training for Police and the New Zealand Defence Force.\nWilson was also a consultant to the Pike River re-entry and developed equipment and processes to enable high-resolution photography inside the sealed mine.\nFinding out about the honour was \"pretty mind blowing\", he said.\n\"It's amazing. It's hard to get your head around the fact that you've been recognised for your work at such a level.\n\"This is also recognition for some of the people I've worked with.\"\nPolice Commissioner Andrew Coster said he congratulated Hamilton and Wilson on these \"thoroughly well-deserved honours\".\n\"They are both superb innovators who have transformed the way we do business in their respective areas of policing, without ever losing sight of the interests of victims and our communities.\n\"I'm delighted to see their immense contributions recognised at the highest level.\"\nMeanwhile, former police officer Aaron Nicholson has also been honoured for his services to the New Zealand Police and Search and Rescue.\nNicholson joined the police force in 1987 and became the officer in charge and Search and Rescue (SAR) coordinator in Wanaka from 2000 to 2018, servicing Mt Aspiring National Park, one of the most visited areas for climbers, trampers and adventure tourists nationally.\nHe managed more than 600 SAR operations during his time.\nNicholson has volunteered with Wanaka SAR since his retirement from police in 2018 and was the chair from 2020 to 2023.\nHe led Wanaka SAR to create specialist integrated teams for alpine/cliff rescue, swift/water canyon rescue, sub-alpine/bush and an incident management team.\nWanaka SAR is the only group to have received the LandSAR New Zealand Supreme Award three times.\n\"It's great to see Aaron recognised for his key leadership role in Southern District SAR, which led to many successful rescues and the development of a vital rescue capability for the Otago Lakes area,\" said Coster.",

Dados abertos da ANP apontam a diminuição da produção de etanol hidratado no país, desde que o programa teve início, o contrário da meta original .\nA sigla diz ainda que o programa erra ao atribuir às distribuidoras de combustível a responsabilidade e obrigação da descarbonização da matriz de combustíveis.\nEssa configuração, segundo a legenda, é uma \"inovação sem lógica\", já que as distribuidoras não possuem poder de decisão em relação à produção e consumo dos biocombustíveis.\nA política, ainda segundo o partido, onera demais o consumidor, que arca com os custos do programa. Apresentam um levantamento mostrando que o aumento no preço final para os consumidores decorrentes do programa varia entre R$ 0,10 a R$ 0,12.\nO governo não vê problemas no programa. Técnicos do Ministério de Minas e Energia afirmam que o mercado de CBios é transparente e há oferta adequada para o cumprimento das metas.\nCom Diego Felix\nLINK PRESENTE: Gostou deste texto?

    "text": "Vanderbilt baseball vs South Carolina game 1 postponed due to rain; to play doubleheader Saturday Aria Gerson Nashville Tennessean Vanderbilt baseball's Friday game against South Carolina has been postponed due to rain, according to a release .\nThe two teams are currently slated to play a doubleheader on Saturday at Founders Park in Columbia. The third-ranked Commodores (19-3, 3-0 SEC) are coming off a sweep of Auburn last week but are facing their first true road series of the season against the Gamecocks (16-5, 1-2).\nPer SEC rules, a doubleheader played on Saturday consists of two nine-inning games. If the two teams begin play on Saturday but are forced to suspend one of the games, that game will be resumed to nine innings Sunday followed by a seven-inning game.\nVanderbilt last played a doubleheader in 2022. The Commodores that season played two games in a day during the regional and also played a doubleheader against Hawaii. During their trip to Arkansas that same season, Vanderbilt resumed a suspended game followed by another game on the final day of the series. The Commodores' last true doubleheader during SEC play came in 2018 against Ole Miss.\nVanderbilt will need to make some tough decisions about its pitching with its upcoming series against Missouri starting on Thursday. The Commodores announced their normal probable rotation of Carter Holton, Bryce Cunningham and Devin Futrell, but the Friday game's cancellation means that if all three pitchers started like normal, Holton would be facing two days of short rest next week. Vanderbilt could choose to start Holton but limit the number of pitches he throws, or the Commodores could skip Holton's turn in the rotation either this week or next week.\nPOWER RANKINGS SEC baseball power rankings after Week 5: Vanderbilt, Mississippi State make statements\nAria Gerson covers Vanderbilt athletics for The Tennessean.
