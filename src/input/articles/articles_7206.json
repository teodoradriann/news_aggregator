    "text": "As we move further into the summer season, heat remains a major concern in the southern regions. Much of Acadiana has been under heat advisories all week, and these are expected to continue through Friday. We can anticipate another day of triple-digit heat indices reaching up to 112°. It's essential to stay hydrated and cool during this intense heat as summer progresses. Don't forget to check on your relatives, friends, and neighbors. Aside from the summer heat, the tropics continue to heat up. [Invest 97L](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gtwo.php?basin=atlc&fdays=7) is gaining better definition as it moves across the Caribbean. Development is expected to be slow over the next few days, but conditions are favorable for the formation of a tropical depression late this weekend or early next week. Most models indicate that Invest 97L will move across Cuba into the eastern Gulf and eventually into the Florida Peninsula. It is still too early to predict the exact path or the strength of this system. Please stay updated with the latest advisories.

    "text": "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell announced on Tuesday, the 656 project selections for $1 billion in climate resilience funding as part of his Investing in America agenda.\nThe selections through the\nBuilding Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program will help state, Tribal, local and territorial governments address current and future risks from natural disasters including extreme heat, wildfires, drought, hurricanes, earthquakes and increased flooding.\n“Every American community faces risks from extreme weather, and the DHS workforce and our partners across the Administration will always be there for communities in their time of need,” said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas.\n“Investing in preparedness and resilience today can help keep our country safe tomorrow. Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program grants are a lifeline for communities across the country, funding projects big and small — from major flood mitigation projects to shaded bus shelters. The impact of these projects will ultimately be measured in lives saved and disasters averted.”\n“We’ve already seen an unprecedented level of extreme weather events this season, and with more expected on the way, we’re encouraged to see increased interest in communities applying for FEMA’s BRIC program,” said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell.\n“Thanks to extra funding from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, FEMA is now better situated to help communities, especially those that are disadvantaged and disproportionately impacted by climate change, invest in resilience. FEMA will remain focused on getting these critical infrastructure dollars to the communities that need it the most.”\nThis effort highlights the importance of FEMA’s continued commitment to putting\n“people first” and helping communities, families, and businesses build climate resilience. It also aligns with the 2024 FEMA Year of Resilience theme to build capacity to withstand tomorrow’s hazards.\nTo strengthen America’s climate resilience, President Biden secured more than $50 billion for climate resilience and adaptation through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act and established a National Climate Resilience Framework, which is advancing locally tailored, community-driven climate resilience strategies.\nPresident Biden’s\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law contributed approximately $398 million to today’s announcement. Overall, the President’s Investing in America agenda provides FEMA nearly $7 billion to help communities proactively reduce their vulnerability to climate-fueled events and natural hazards.\nOf the approximately $674 million in 56 national competition selections, more than half of the selections use nature-based solutions and other natural ways to combat climate change, restore and protect wetlands and to harness nature to enhance climate resilience.\nFEMA announced this funding opportunity in\nOctober 2023 alongside an $800 million Flood Mitigation Assistance opportunity. Selections for Flood Mitigation Assistance will be made later this year.\nThis year’s selections cover a variety of natural hazards, including extreme heat, flooding and earthquakes. The top three funded project types are:\n- Flood control for $395 million across 28 projects, designed to eliminate or reduce flood damage;\n- Utility and infrastructure protection for $237 million across 30 projects, like elevating pumping stations, enhancing power poles, strengthening water towers and floodproofing utility plants;\n- Building code-related projects for $55 million across 129 projects for enforcement and adoption of more modern, hazard-resistant building codes. This is the greatest number of projects FEMA has ever selected for building code-related activities in a grant cycle. These funds were reserved as a non-competitive set-aside for states, Tribes and territories, resulting in a 180% increase in requests for adoption and enforcement funding.\nBelow is a sample of selections from across the nation of projects that cover these hazards. The full list of selections can be found at\nFEMA.gov:\n- The Eastwick Near-Term Flood Barrier Project, led by the Philadelphia Office of Sustainability, will boost resilience by mitigating flood risks in Eastwick. Eastwick, a previous recipient of non-financial BRIC technical assistance, is vulnerable to a number of flooding sources.\n- Shaded bus shelters in Washington, D.C. will mitigate the effects of extreme heat. The project will install 20 shaded bus stops in urban heat islands to ensure bus users can access this essential community service during extreme heat days. By targeting public transit, the project will safeguard residents as they commute to work, run errands, fulfill other daily obligations and help to protect historically low-income communities from the effects of extreme heat.\n- The East Elmhurst Cloudburst project in New York City will use innovative control measures to manage extreme stormwater events and reduce local flooding. These include porous concrete parking and bike lanes, as well as green infrastructure and on-site storage.\n- The Magalia Dam retrofit project in Paradise, California, will build seismic resilience. The project will reinforce the dam to better withstand earthquakes so the dam can continue providing its critical benefits.\n- The Slaughterhouse Creek Flood Mitigation project in Montana will include channel improvements and culvert replacements. The project will have an improved channel designed to contain flooding.\n- West Virginia is a first-time BRIC national competition applicant. The Rand Flooding Storm Sewer Improvements project will upgrade community infrastructure to address critical drainage issues.\n- The Southern Crisfield Flood Mitigation. Crisfield, Maryland — a previous selection for Direct Technical Assistance — aims to boost resilience by improving flood protection through a 5-mile-long tidal flood protection barrier and a new internal drainage system. This project will improve flood protection, stormwater management and wetland health.\n- Decatur, Georgia, make major roadways safer from floods and improve access for emergency vehicles. The current culverts can lead to roads becoming impassable or washed-out during storms. This grant will upgrade culverts on major roadways to stay open during severe weather.\n- A blend of nature-based solutions and infrastructure improvements will boost flood resilience along the Big Ditch stream corridor in the city of Goldsboro, North Carolina. The project will upgrade road culverts and expand a restored floodplain. This will make homes safer from flooding as well as improve water quality and provide new wildlife habitat and more equitable access to recreational resources.\nAssistance for States, Territories and Tribal Nations\nBeyond the national competition, FEMA selected an additional 600 projects totaling $208 million. In addition to a maximum $2 million for every state and territory, these funds also include approximately $55 million for building code activities and $67 million for Tribal Nations.\nAnother $116 million for states, Tribes, territories and the District of Columbia to administer these grants brings to the total to $1 billion. For a complete list of selections, visit\nFEMA.gov.\nFEMA is also announcing 93 Tribes, local communities and territories across all 10 FEMA regions that will receive non-financial\ndirect technical assistance to help build community-wide resilience through the BRIC program. This more than doubles the number of recipients from last year.\nThrough the Direct Technical Assistance program, FEMA will provide guidance to disadvantaged communities facing climate risks to ensure no community is left behind in the opportunity to build climate resilience. For a full list of communities, visit\nhttps://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation/building-resilient-infrastructure-communities/direct-technical-assistance/communities/.\nTrends in Equity, Extreme Heat, Nature-Based Solutions and Other Top Funded Projects\nThese selections further underscore the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to equity and environmental justice. These awards will assist the most disadvantaged communities in building resilience to climate change and extreme weather events like hurricanes, flooding, tornadoes and extreme heat.\nExtreme Heat: Among the 656 projects, 12 selections will mitigate the effects of extreme heat for a total of nearly $13 million. In addition to the shaded bus stops in Washington, D.C, other examples include providing resilient power systems to places like saferooms and senior living and medical facilities that provide climate control. Given the growing risks posed by extreme heat impacts, FEMA encourages more States, Tribes and territories to apply for extreme heat projects during future grant cycles.\nJustice 40: Of the available funding, $587 million is benefitting\nJustice40 communities that are overburdened by pollution and marginalized by underinvestment. The Biden-Harris Administration’s Justice40 Initiative aims to deliver 40% of funding to these communities. Since 2020, FEMA has seen an upward trend of exceeding its Justice40 goals. This year, disadvantaged communities accounted for 67% of the total selections and 70% of the national competition.\nCommunity Disaster Resilience Zones: Additionally, $127 million will benefit\nCommunity Disaster Resilience Zones. The Community Disaster Resilience Zones Act — signed into law by President Biden in 2022 — allows FEMA to identify U.S. Census tracts that are most at risk from the effects of natural hazards and climate change.\nNature-Based Solutions: For this grant cycle, 57% of selected projects incorporate nature-based solutions — practices that weave natural features or processes into the built environment to promote resilience — across nine FEMA regions. About 84% of those nature-based solution projects will be in Economically Disadvantaged Rural Communities, Community Disaster Resilience Zones or disadvantaged communities.",

Many areas are experiencing water supply disruptions. This is due to an increase in ammonia levels in Yamuna water. In this regard, the Kejriwal administration claims that the Chief Secretary was directed to solve the problem but did not act on time.\nWater Minister Atishi tweeted that the water supply in Delhi has been disrupted in recent days due to high ammonia levels in the Yamuna. This is a recurring issue.\nChief Minister Arvind Kejriwal directed the Delhi Jal Board to establish an ammonia treatment plant in Wazirabad in March. The work was supposed to be completed in six months, but despite constant follow-up, the Jal Board did not even begin the project.\nAtishi further wrote, “I have directed the Chief Secretary to ensure that the tender for this project is issued by January 15 and the CM will monitor it. This is necessary so that the people of Delhi do not have to suffer from this recurring problem.”",

    "text": "GHENT — The county’s Soil and Water Conservation District received $2.8 million from the state to work with a local dairy farm to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The funding, announced Sept. 27 by Gov. Kathy Hochul, is part of $33 million in funding awarded to 70 county soil and water conservation districts across the state. This was the first time the county’s district was awarded funding through the state’s Climate Resilient Farming Grant Program, Dylan Cipkowski, executive director of the Columbia County Soil and Water Conservation District, said. “We’re very excited about that, we have applied for this funding in the past and have not been awarded it,” he said. “This is the first time an award has gone to a Columbia County farm.” The district received the funding and is working with an unnamed local dairy farm. The Soil and Water Conservation District submitted the application to the grant program on behalf of a dairy farm in the county, which Cipkowski could not name due to privacy reasons. “The farm was really instrumental in putting together a complete application,” he said. The project the farm and the district will be undertaking involves the implementation of a manure management system, which includes two covered manure systems. The management system will include a cover and flare system, which is made up of a covered manure pit where the methane is captured and burned off to prevent it from entering the environment. The system will also use a solid-liquid separation mechanism to separate the manure for the creation of bedding material for the cows, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets’ description of the project. “These storages will result in eliminating methane emissions from manure stored on the farm, significantly improved odors on and around the farm, as well as a number of farm efficiencies that will make the farm more viable,” Cipkowski said. Covering the manure systems on the farm will also reduce rainwater from entering the systems, which will require the farm to truck away manure less often, Cipkowski said. “That’s less fuel the farm needs to buy, less hired help the farm requires,” he said. The farm will also be able to recycle fiber used for cow bedding through the management system, which the farm currently has to truck in from out of state, Cipkowski said. “Having this production on the farm will reduce the need to truck in the material and provide cost savings for the farm,” he said. The total cost of the project is $5.8 million, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets’ description of the project. The farm has to match 50% or more of the project cost, Cipkowski said. Through the implementation of the farm’s manure management system, the estimated reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is 30,440 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets. The Columbia County project will result in the highest reduction of greenhouse gas emissions out of the 70 projects awarded funding. The county Soil and Water Conservation district also received the largest amount of funding from the state for the its project. The goal of the Climate Resilient Farming Grant program is to assist farmers in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as protect water, ensure soil health, and increase the resiliency of farms against climate change, according to a written statement from Hochul’s office. “We’re really excited to be awarded the funding for the project and think it really fits the goals of the program,” Cipkowski said. Matt Murell, chairman of the Columbia County Board of Supervisors, R-Stockport, welcomed the funding for the project. “We’re happy to receive any state funding that’s going to benefit our farm community,” he said.",

    "title": "Building Your Home Gym: Precisely why Olympic Bars and Dumbbells Can be a Must-Have.",
    "text": "Making a home exercise space is a thrilling and practical way to bring fitness nearer to home, ensuring flexibility, privacy, and the ease of lacking to happen to be a gym. For anyone seriously interested in fitness, certain foundational equipment makes all the difference Gym equipment discounts . Among these, Olympic bars and dumbbells stick out as must-have items for his or her versatility, durability, and the strength-building benefits they offer.\nThe Advantages of a Home Gym\nBefore diving into the requirements of Olympic bars and dumbbells, it’s crucial that you realize why creating a home exercise space is beneficial. A home exercise space:\nSaves Time and Money : No requirement for gym memberships or travel time.\nOffers Privacy : Ideal for folks who prefer an exclusive workout environment.\nProvides Flexibility : You can work out when you want, without looking forward to equipment.\nIs Highly Customizable : You select the apparatus that best suits your goals.\nWhy Choose Olympic Bars?\nOlympic bars aren’t just any standard barbell; they are specifically made for durability, precision, and superior performance. Here are a few reasons why they are a must-have for just about any home exercise space:\nEnhanced Strength Training : Olympic bars permit you to perform exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses with higher weight capacities than standard bars. These heavy-duty exercises engage multiple muscle groups, helping build full-body strength.\nGreater Load Capacity : Olympic bars are designed to handle more weight, often as much as 1,500 pounds, unlike standard barbells that will max out around 300-400 pounds. This durability supports strength gains as you progress.\nRotation Mechanism : Olympic bars feature rotating sleeves, reducing the torque on your wrists and elbows during exercises like cleans and snatches. This rotation provides an easier lifting experience and aids in preventing injury.\nVersatility : Having an Olympic bar, you are able to attach a wide variety of Olympic-sized weight plates, rendering it well suited for progressive training as you build strength.\nBalance and Stability : Olympic bars are heavier, often weighing 45 pounds, that provides better stability and balance than lighter, standard bars.\nThe Power of Dumbbells in Your Workout Routine\nDumbbells are one of the most versatile tools in any gym, offering a range of benefits for several fitness levels:\nVersatile Movements : With dumbbells, you are able to execute a wide selection of exercises, from arm curls to lunges and chest presses. They enable a larger range of motion, targeting specific muscles and improving flexibility.\nFunctional Strength : Dumbbells are well suited for building functional strength—strength that applies to daily activities. Exercises like dumbbell lunges or squats mimic real-life movements, helping to improve coordination and stability.\nStrength Imbalance Correction : Dumbbells help identify and correct muscle imbalances. Since each arm works independently, you are able to spot weaknesses in either side, helping you to work each muscle group equally and promote balanced strength.\nImproved Stability and Control : Dumbbell exercises need you to stabilize muscle tissue as you lift, which engages the core and smaller stabilizing muscles. This benefit is needed for overall strength and injury prevention.\nAccessibility : Dumbbells come in a range of weights, so whether you’re a starter or a pro, you can find the right resistance level. Adjustable dumbbells are a fantastic choice for home gyms with limited space.\nSetting Up Your Home Gym with Olympic Bars and Dumbbells\nPrioritize Quality : Look for high-quality Olympic bars and dumbbells to ensure safety and longevity. Steel Olympic bars with good tensile strength and dumbbells with ergonomic grips provide durability and comfort.\nConsider Space and Storage : If you’re tight on space, consider compact solutions like adjustable dumbbells or foldable squat racks. Wall-mounted racks for dumbbells can save floor space and keep your area organized.\nObtain the Right Accessories : Pair your Olympic bars with quality weight plates, collars, and perhaps a power rack or bench. These accessories maximize the potency of your exercises and assist you to target various muscle groups.\nDevelop a Balanced Routine : Incorporate a variety of compound exercises with your Olympic bars and dumbbells. Squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and rows with the barbell, coupled with isolated movements like curls and shoulder presses with dumbbells, give a well-rounded routine.\nConclusion\nDeveloping a home exercise space that features Olympic bars and dumbbells is an investment in both your quality of life and long-term fitness goals. These tools provide unmatched versatility, durability, and are well suited for anyone looking to create strength, endurance, and muscles from the comfort of their particular space. Whether you’re a starter or advanced lifter, Olympic bars and dumbbells are necessary for making a gym that grows with you, offering the ease of high-quality workouts at home.",

    "text": "Campaign Trump: ‘Crazy’ for any Christian to vote for Democrat Former President Trump told attendees at a Christian media convention Thursday that it would be “crazy” for any Christian to vote for a Democratic candidate, framing the 2024 election as a broader fight against a “radical left” intent on going after patriotic Christians. “How any Christian can vote for a Democrat, Christian or person of faith, person of faith — how you can vote for a Democrat is crazy. It’s crazy,” Trump said at the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) International Christian Media Convention in Nashville. Trump made the remark while railing against his multiple indictments, characterizing himself as the victim of “the radical left” that he claimed is “coming after all of us” due to “allegiance to our country” and “our creator.” The former president has sought to shore up support among Christian conservatives, who were key to his 2016 electoral rise, as he works to clinch the Republican presidential nomination this year and go head-to-head against President Biden in November. A recent poll found more Republican respondents saying Trump is a person of faith in comparison to other GOP figures. The survey, conducted by HarrisX for Deseret News, found 64 percent of Republicans saying Trump is a person of faith. That was higher than the 56 percent of Republicans who said they think former Vice President Mike Pence, an evangelical Christian, is a person of faith. Trump soured on Pence after he played a largely ceremonial role formalizing the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021. The former president in his speech Thursday said Christians “can’t afford to sit on the sidelines” in what he said is a fight against political opponents — “whether you call it the radical left, or the communists or the fascists.” “They have to really get out there, and they have to do what they have to do, and they have to win,” Trump said. Biden’s campaign recently said that a second Trump presidential term would be “straight out of the Handmaid’s Tale,” in the wake of a Politico report detailing how the former president’s allies are working to incorporate “Christian nationalist ideas” into another term. “This is straight out of the Handmaid’s Tale. Nationwide abortion bans, attacks on same-sex marriage, and restrictions on contraception — this is the horrifying reality being openly discussed by Team Trump and the likely architects of his second term agenda,” Biden campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said Tuesday.
