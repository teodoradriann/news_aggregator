    "text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s two-day (July 8–9) official visit to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated the significant depth of their bilateral relations within the context of global changes. Russia’s closeness in enhancing and deepening economic cooperation also has an intertwined strategy for ensuring readiness against threats from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a political and military alliance of countries from Europe and North America. But India has, thus far, shown pragmatism in approach as it builds a strong partnership with the United States and, at the same time, maintains ties with Russia.\nNarendra Modi’s agenda was really loaded. Choosing Moscow after his re-election as prime minister underlined the importance of Russian-Indian relations, at least from the Soviet era through Moscow’s post Soviet economic transformations until today. Today, both are staunch members of the ‘informal association’ – BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.) Long before that was RIC ‘trioka’ (Russia, India and China), which according to the Russia Foreign Ministry would be revived. Russia and India also belong to the G20, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).\nNotwithstanding the common visions, Russia and India have distinctive features in geography, politics and economy. India is the third-largest economy in the world. It is probably the largest country in the world by population,1.4 billion people. Russia was only recent upgrade into middle-income category and said to have overtaken Japan, which has only stripes of land and estimated population of 128 million people. By contrast, Russia with an extremely huge territory and vast natural resources, can boast of tiny population of 143 million. It took Russia more than thirty years, after Soviet’s collapse, to join middle-level income countries and to overtake Japan. Despite its achievements, Russia is still far away from what economists referred to as private-oriented economy. Russia’s economy is largely state-controlled.\nModi rightly noted during his conversation with Putin that “India is the largest democracy; it is considered the mother of democracy” and therefore democratic elections were very important and huge in scale. “It is the first time in 60 years that a government has been elected for a third term in a row. The first time it happened was when India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was elected for a third term. I have done the same 60 years later. The people of India have given me a chance to serve my homeland,” underscored Modi. According to the official transcript, the Indian people voted for Modi on the principle: reform, perform and transform. Putin and Modi had their first informal encounter at the presidential residence in Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region.\nA new era is setting in the world, wrote the local Russia’s Kommersant newspaper on the eve of PM Modi’s visit. According to the newspaper, India considers itself the leader of the Global South, and Russia, one of the driving forces shaping a multipolar world, recognizes each other as important political partners. An additional factor pushing Moscow and New Delhi toward rapprochement is the increasing pressure on Russia and India from the United States.\nWhat Moscow Offers India\nRussia-India relations have flourished across all areas under Putin’s leadership for 25 years, i.e. since 1991. The trustworthy relations has hit new milestones and new heights these past few years. In the current global context, India and Russia, as well as their partnership, have taken on a new importance. It is hard to overestimate Russia-India cooperation in the ff; trade and the economy, in the military-technical industry, nuclear and hydrogen energy, in high technology and space development.\nIn the Grand Kremlin Palace, several documents were discussed, negotiated and outlined bilateral economic sectors for India’s strategic cooperation with Russia until 2030.\nThe programme was signed of Russian-Indian cooperation in trade, economic and investment spheres in the Russian Far East for 2024–2029, and on the principles of cooperation in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation. Given the vast territory of the Far East, and with its tiny 6.3 million people, China and India have been showing high interest in investment sectors in the region. In the Far East region, Russia is collaborating with Asian countries in trade and investment, strengthening its economic ties especially with China, India, North Korea and Vietnam.\nAlready local media reports said earlier that India has been a major buyer of Russian oil since the start of the ‘special military operation’ and it has amassed a trade deficit worth around $60 billion in its dealings with Russia.\nHead of the Center for the Indian Ocean Region at IMEMO RAS Alexey Kupriyanov said in an interview with Nezavisimaya Gazeta: “While the trade deficit problem cannot be solved through negotiations, it can be resolved as the trade structure levels off and Indian exports to Russia grow. These mostly include high-tech products that India either produces itself or buys in the West to resell to Russia.”\nIn January-April, Russia was the second largest supplier of goods to India (with only China ahead of it with deliveries worth $32.6 billion). In turn, exports of Indian goods to Russia increased by 21% to $1.6 billion, with Russia rising from 33rd to 29th place among recipients of goods from India. The top five importers of Indian goods include the United States, the United Arab Emirates, the Netherlands, Singapore, and China.\nDuring negotiations on July 9, inter-agency documents were signed concerning issues of climate change and low-carbon development, geodesy and cartography, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, scientific research and logistics in the polar regions, and cooperation in the field of television broadcasting. A number of signed agreements concern investment and arbitration issues.\nIn addition, economic cooperation featured prominently in the bilateral discussions, ended with signing memorandums of understanding between the all-Russia Public Organisation Delovaya Rossiya (Business Russia) and the Trade Promotion Council of India, as well as between the National Research University Higher School of Economics (Russia) and Jawaharlal Nehru University (New Delhi, India). The world will be watching with eagles eyes for the tangible results from these ambitious initiatives and strategies in shaping the evolving regional politics and economy not only in Russia but also in Eurasian region and, further the global dynamics.\nCrowning the two-day interaction, President Vladimir Putin decorated Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, with “the Order of St Andrew the Apostle” in a modest ceremony held in St Andrew’s Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace. According to the decree, Modi was honored with this award “for his outstanding merit in development of the particularly privileged strategic partnership between the Russian Federation and the Republic of India, as well as friendly ties between Russian and Indian peoples.”\nThis order can be awarded to heads of foreign states for outstanding services to the Russian Federation. It is the oldest order instituted more than three centuries ago by Russian Emperor Peter the Great.\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2024 was nominally worth $3.94 trillion. Driven by growth, India’s nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from $308 in 1991 and now reached an estimated $2,731 in 2024. India is officially known as the Republic of India located in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2024. It has borders to the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.",

    "text": "Met Éireann has issued a status yellow thunderstorm warning for Munster, Connacht and Donegal, as Storm Gerrit continues to impact the country. The warning, which came into effect shortly after 8am this morning, will remain in place until 9pm on Thursday night, bringing a risk of further power outages, dangerous driving conditions and localised flooding. Hundreds of houses remain without power following the arrival of the storm, which brought strong winds and heavy rainfall across the country. ESB crews are working to restore supplies to homes and businesses after Storm Gerrit knocked out power overnight, with Galway and Wexford among the areas worst hit. In Cork, over 100 households are still left without power, following last night's thunder and lightning. According to the ESB's PowerCheck, over 200 households remain without power in Co Galway. A total of 862 customers were without power in Kilflynn, Co Kerry this morning, after a major fault occurred following torrential rainfall. Cork County Council confirmed there was no significant damage as a result of Storm Gerrit, which led to fallen trees and debris in parts of the county. A total of 13 trees fell over the course of Wednesday, which crews responded to diligently to clear the obstruction. \"There are no reports of any significant damage to property. High tides have passed without incident,\" the statement read. Intense thunderstorms in Wexford, great photo of lightning strikes by Dec Roche and large hail by Anita Cousins.— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather) [pic.twitter.com/g9jr1e85gR] [December 27, 2023] The heavy rainfall led to spot flooding across parts of Cork city and county, with motorists advised to drive with caution due to the risk of damage to road surfaces. The council has also addressed the rising river levels, which are of \"no immediate concerns\" at present.

The power cuts follow a nationwide status yellow wind and rain warning which was in place since 8pm on Tuesday and will remain until midnight on Thursday. \"Very strong and gusty southwesterly winds in conjunction with spring tides, may lead to coastal flooding,\" said Met Éireann. \"Squally showers, with a chance of thunderstorms, may lead to localised flooding.\" A taxi driver in Waterford City was hospitalised last night after his car was hit by a falling tree during high winds. It happened in the Newtown area at around 11pm, and the driver was treated for minor injuries. Gabriel Hynes, Senior Engineer with Waterford City and County Council has urged the public to exercise caution. “Our ground crews are attending to a number of fallen trees and roads blocked as a result of yesterday’s Status Orange weather event. While the worst of the weather has passed, the current thunderstorm warning is expected to bring some scattered thunderstorms and spells of rain, which could lead to localised and spot flooding. These conditions combined with fallen branches and debris on the roads will make travel hazardous,\" he said. Mr Hynes advised motorists to avoid driving through flooded roads and instead choose an alternative route to avoid injury, adding: \"flood waters can be deeper than they appear\". Met Éireann issued another weather warning, which came into effect at midnight and affected those in Clare, Kerry, Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo. The status yellow wind warning will see \"southwest winds veering westerly\" which will be strong and gusty at times. \"A combination of spring tides, large waves and strong winds may result in some coastal flooding.\" That warning is in place from midnight until 6am on Friday. On Wednesday, in Skibbereen, in West Cork, the river Ilen burst its banks, flooding hundreds of acres of farmland north of the town. But thanks to its flood defences, the town remained dry. Last night, Kerry County Council issued a warning to those in the county to \"stay away from all coastal areas\", including Beara Peninsula, amid the ongoing dangerous conditions. Alan O'Reilly of Carlow Weather said the gusty weather is expected to continue into today, with \"very windy\" conditions expected throughout the day. The National forecaster has predicted a chance of \"gales\" on Atlantic coasts at times on Thursday, leading to a \"continued chance of coastal flooding\". Some frost or ice is expected to land later on in the day, with lowest temperatures of 1C to 5C expected. Friday will again see sunny spells and scattered blustery showers while Saturday be windy with sunny spells and wintry showers. Sunday is shaping up to be a calmer day with sunny spells and well-scattered showers.
