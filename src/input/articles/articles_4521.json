    "title": "Antisemitic and Islamophobic Hate Crimes Surge in UK After Hamas Attack on Israel",
    "text": "News\nAntisemitic and Islamophobic Hate Crimes Surge in UK After Hamas Attack on Israel\n(CTN News) – According to data from several major UK police agencies, the number of antisemitic hate crimes increased significantly in the thirty days following the Hamas assault on Israel.\nThere was an increase in Islamophobic offences, according to some forces, however the overall picture is more complicated.\nYielding “shocking” results, according to the Jewish charity Community Safety Trust.\nThe anti-Muslim movement has characterized them as “deeply worrying” at the same time.\nAccording to the data gathered by the PA news agency, antisemitic crimes increased sharply in the larger areas covered by the police force in the month after the assaults on October 7.\nThere were 74 antisemitic acts reported to Greater Manchester Police, up from 15 at the same time last year, and 34 Islamophobic offences, down from 43 in the previous year.\nAt the same time, there was an increase from 10 antisemitic incidents in 2022 to 53 documented by West Yorkshire Police. It added that the number of Islamophobic offences increased from 29 to 49, which is the highest increase of any occurrence.\nDuring the month leading up to November 7th, 22 antisemitic incidents were recorded by the West Midlands Police, down from 1 in 2022, while 25 Islamophobic incidents were recorded, down from 33 in the previous year.\nThe number of antisemitic occurrences has increased from four to twenty, according to Merseyside Police. From six to ten incidents of Islamophobic violence occurred there.\nA similar pattern in documented antisemitic occurrences was observed in several forces that operate throughout both urban and less populated areas, although with smaller levels of offences.\nThe number of antisemitic crimes registered by Hertfordshire Police increased to 17 in 2023 from 6 in 2022, while the number recorded by Thames Valley Police increased from 1 to 21.\nThe\nBritish Transport Police, on the other hand, registered the largest spike, with 87 antisemitic offences, up from eight in the corresponding time of 2022. Reports of Islamophobic crimes increased from two to twenty-two, the source added.\nAccording to a representative from the Community Security Trust, the data clearly shows “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country” since Oct. 7.\nWith the phrase “wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime” in their lips, they emphasized how critical it was to find and punish those responsible.\nIslamophobic bigotry is a “deeply worrying” problem, according to Tell Mama director Iman Atta, who also notes that it is impacting communities’ “trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging.” Tell Mama tracks instances of anti-Muslim abuse.\nShe stated, “We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time.”\n“Please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish,” she said. “We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nOf the 46 police forces in the United Kingdom, 31 responded to PA’s Freedom of Information request.\nDespite prior reports of significant increases in antisemitic and Islamophobic crimes, the numbers from the Metropolitan Police in London are absent from the analysis.\nThe police stated that it would not be able to provide complete data until the new year due to delays.\nIn the thirty days leading up to November 7th, the Met had previously documented 188 arrests for hate crimes and violent crimes. It stated that most of the detainees were held on suspicion of antisemitic crimes in connection to demonstrations that took place in London.\n“Unacceptable” was the word used by Paul Travers, the then-commander of criminal justice at the Met, to describe the increase in religiously motivated crimes in the capital.\n“No one should be subjected to hate because of their faith or race, and we are taking action against those who are offending,” stated the president.\nWe cannot compare the number of offences across different areas using the data gathered by PA since police departments use different methodologies to register hate crimes.\nFor the same reason, these numbers cannot be used to calculate a total for the whole United Kingdom.\nThere is no room in our society for hate, and we strongly denounce the recent surge in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred,” stated a representative from the Home Office.\nWe want the police to look into every hate crime thoroughly and collaborate with the CPS to make sure the criminals responsible for these heinous acts face the full weight of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”\nOne thousand two hundred Israelis lost their lives in the unprecedented Hamas onslaught. A further 240 people were kidnapped.\nThe health ministry of the enclave, which Hamas governs,\nreports that more than 21,300 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli bombardments in Gaza since then.",

    "text": "ATLANTA, GA — Campaign staffers were sent into a frenzy ahead of tonight's presidential debate as they realized President Joe Biden attempted to cheat on a drug test by submitting a sample from his son Hunter instead.\nThough initially resistant to complying with drug testing before the debate, reports indicated Biden agreed to do so at the last minute while passing off Hunter's urine sample as his own in a deceptive effort to pass.\n\"This isn't going to turn out well,\" said one flustered Biden campaign insider. \"He handed in Hunter's sample? HUNTER?! Are you kidding me? Do you have any idea how many illegal substances that guy has in his bloodstream at all times? He's like a walking pharmacy! This could ruin everything.\"\nWhen asked about the rumored test sample switch, President Biden denied any wrongdoing. \"Listen up, folks. My sample will be clean as a whistle,\" he said. \"Not only am I not on… not on… not doing any… not… the stuff, but even if I did submit my son's sample, he's the greatest, smartest man I know. He's never done anything wrong. Except for all the crack and whatever. Pancakes.\"\nEarly reports indicated that the sample submitted by President Biden contained too many foreign chemical compounds to accurately count, leaving experts confused about which Biden it belonged to. \"Honestly, it could be a toss-up,\" one lab technician disclosed.\nAt publishing time, the Biden campaign issued a statement clarifying that crack cocaine, meth, mescaline, PCP, mushrooms, and bath salts were not on the list of substances banned for use by the candidates for the debate.\nBob Boeing, the founder of Boeing, explains how the number 1 priority for the airline manufacturer is diversity.\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for more uplifting DEI videos!",

    "text": "\"Ese vestido es pa' quemarlo\": Colombiano analiza los peores looks que dejó la alfombra roja de los Copihue de Oro\nNelson Beltran, el Colombiano dio su análisis crítico a las peores vestidas de la alfombra roja de los premios \"Copihue de Oro 2025\".\nLa noche del miércoles 29 de enero se celebró la premiación de los \"Copihue de Oro 2025\", donde se premiaron a los mejores exponentes del espectáculo nacional.\nComo es habitual, los invitados desfilaron por la alfombra roja del GAM, y al día siguiente, en \"Tu Día\" de Canal 13, el especialista en moda Nelson Beltrán, más conocido como el Colombiano, analizó los looks que le generaron ruido durante la ceremonia.\nMelina Noto: Un exceso de fucsia\nUno de los mayores desaciertos de la noche, según el Colombiano, fue el look de Melina Noto. \"Ayer, Melina Noto llamó mucho la atención. Estaba vestida por Gio y Bernardo, dos diseñadores jóvenes, pero la mezcla de texturas fue un error\", comentó Beltrán, criticando el cuello innecesario, las lentejuelas de baja calidad y los guantes de lycra fucsia que no combinaban con el resto del atuendo, señalando que la personalidad de la prenda hacía que Noto luciera como \"disfrazada\".\nVesta Lugg: un vestido muy corto para una alfombra roja\nOtro look que no convenció fue el de Vesta Lugg, quien, según el especialista, lució un vestido corto que \"era más adecuado para una discoteca o una fiesta, no para una alfombra roja\". A pesar de reconocer que el color del vestido era interesante y que Lugg había hecho una excelente presentación en el escenario, el Colombiano comentó que el vestido corto no era apropiado para la ocasión. \"Si hubiese sido largo, este vestido hubiese sido espectacular\", afirmó.\nLisandra Silva y una mala mezcla de materiales\nPor último, Beltrán criticó el vestido de Lisandra Silva, describiéndolo como un \"error garrafal\". El Colombiano señaló la mala elección de texturas y el faldón pesado que no favorecía la figura de la modelo, agregando que la mezcla de materiales y el corte a la cadera fueron detalles desacertados que hicieron que el look no fuera adecuado para la alfombra roja.\nRevisa los peores looks en los Copihue de Oro 2024\nVer Video\nSíguenos en",

    "text": "Stories of conversion mark National Eucharistic Pilgrimage’s first 10 days [With an estimated 7,000 participants, the Source and Summit Eucharistic Procession makes its way along Summit Avenue in St. Paul, Minn., on its way from The St. Paul Seminary to the Cathedral of St. Paul in St. Paul May 27, 2024. The procession was part of the National Eucharistic Pilgrimage. (OSV News photo/Dave Hrbacek, The Catholic Spirit)](https://www.americamagazine.org/sites/default/files/main_image/2024/05/31/20240530T2000-NEC24-NEP-ROUNDUP-WEEK2-1777567.JPG.JPG) (OSV News) -- As a Eucharistic procession made its way May 28 through Victoria, Texas, a 20-something man sitting on the side of a street caught Charlie McCullough’s attention. McCullough stopped to talk with him, explaining what was going on: The procession was part of the National Eucharistic Pilgrimage en route to Indianapolis for the National Eucharistic Congress, and the Eucharist they were walking behind is really, truly Jesus. “He had grown up in the Protestant faith and had never seen a Eucharistic procession before, and was at a time in life where he was asking a lot of big questions about what is the reason I exist for, what’s the purpose of life, all these things,” McCullough, one of six perpetual pilgrims on the pilgrimage’s southern St. Juan Diego route, recalled May 29. “We talked briefly and I kept walking.” About five blocks later, McCullough looked over his shoulder and saw the man running after the procession. He caught up to McCullough and asked if they could talk more. “He told me that that morning was the first time he had tried to pray in years. He opened his Bible, and he didn’t know if the Lord had heard him. And when we walked by -- when Jesus Christ walked by -- he knew something was different. And he knew that he wanted to follow the Lord, and he had so many questions about how and what he wants to do, and there was this zeal welling up in his heart,” McCullough said. “I just got to pray with him and encourage him.” “At the end of our conversation, he goes, ‘I know this sounds crazy, but I want to go all the way to Indianapolis,’” he said. McCullough, a fellow Texan, thinks it’s unlikely the man will follow the pilgrimage to Indianapolis, “but I pray that he follows the Lord the rest of his life,” he said. “He had a very profound experience, and the Lord stirred his heart through a simple encounter there, and it was very beautiful.” McCullough shared that encounter on a May 29 media call that included pilgrims from all four routes of the National Eucharistic Pilgrimage, which began May 18-19 in California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Texas. Ten days into their journeys, the 23 perpetual pilgrims were in the Diocese of Victoria; the Diocese of Boise, Idaho; the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis; and the Diocese of Trenton, New Jersey. Their second week included already iconic events -- such as when Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York blessed the city with the Eucharist from a boat near the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor May 27 -- and hidden moments -- like when a man got out of a truck in the middle of Oregon, far away from any towns, and genuflected as the Eucharistic caravan passed. “It was just a moment driving by, but he had gone out that distance to make sure he knew he would be by Jesus,” said Chas Firestone East, a perpetual pilgrim from Virginia journeying on the western St. Junipero Serra Route. The pilgrims shared other stories of encounter and conversion: On the California side of Lake Tahoe, a photographer for a secular news outlet -- amazed by the masses of people turning out for processions -- told the perpetual pilgrims that he was inspired to learn more about the Eucharist and plans to begin the process for becoming Catholic. Meanwhile, a woman who isn’t able to walk with the pilgrims has been joining each procession along the St. Juan Diego Route since Brownsville, Texas, on a retrofitted tricycle. Also in Texas, some perpetual pilgrims helped bandage a woman’s wounded leg at a homeless shelter, and then the woman -- whose name is Hope -- asked the pilgrims to pray with her. “It was just a beautiful moment to see Jesus ... getting to see him inside the person that we encounter,” said Shayla Elm, a Juan Diego Route perpetual pilgrim originally from North Dakota. The pilgrims have been amazed by the number of people who met them for Eucharistic processions, Holy Hours and Mass. “I have been blown away at how hungry people are to show their faith and how thirsty Jesus is for their souls,” Elm said. “Jesus really is thirsty for this whole country. He really wants so many souls to encounter him, and he’s the one walking in the streets. He’s leading us right now. So, it’s really beautiful to have all of us walking alongside our Lord.” Meanwhile, the pilgrims have been bringing the Eucharist to places where people cannot join the public events. On May 28, perpetual pilgrims on the northern Marian Route visited a St. Paul, Minnesota, nursing home run by the Little Sisters of the Poor. The visit was a day after a 7,000-person procession on a nearby avenue. A deacon with them pointed out that Jesus wanted to come to people, who due to age or infirmity, couldn’t come to him, and his message stuck with perpetual pilgrim Kai Weiss, a German student who studies in Washington. “Jesus is really seeking all kinds of different people out on this journey,” he said. While the perpetual pilgrims expected large turnouts in the cities along their routes, events in small towns have also drawn hundreds. Weiss noted that processions in rural parts of the Diocese of St. Cloud, Minnesota, likely exceeded the towns’ populations. “The enthusiasm in those small towns was shocking,” he said. “You just walk through these small towns and church bells are ringing, the first communicants have flowers ... people along the route come out of their houses to check what is going on and they’re really moved. Many of them kneel down, but I think a lot of them are like, ‘Wow, this is amazing.’” On May 26, the Serra Route’s perpetual pilgrims had driven a long time across the Nevada landscape without passing any towns -- an experience that East described as beautiful but eerie, especially right after spending time in major California cities. Then, they pulled up to a tiny mission church on the Nevada-Oregon border town of McDermitt, where they were warmly welcomed by a group of Catholics. That arrival “felt like there was a family waiting for us,” East said. In McDermitt, they met Bishop Liam S. Cary of Baker, Oregon, who accompanied the pilgrims in driving processions for the 24 hours they were in his state. The Baker Diocese encouraged the Catholics joining them by car to pray, sing and listen to Catholic podcasts. As the vehicles crossed into Idaho May 27, Bishop Cary knelt before the monstrance on a float pulled by a truck. Zoe Dongas, a perpetual pilgrim from New York on the eastern St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Route, said a highlight from the pilgrimage has been “the amount of faithful bishops and priests we’ve been able to encounter.” “We were just on a boat ... with Cardinal Dolan and (Metuchen, New Jersey) Bishop (James F.) Checchio, (and New York Auxiliary) Bishop (Edmund J.) Whalen ... and getting to bless the Statue of Liberty -- that was wild,” she said. “To get to spend time in adoration with all of these holy men that love their church so much and are willing to say ‘yes’ to this amazing adventure and to receive us with such great hospitality -- it’s truly been such a gift.” On May 30, the Seton Route pilgrims had moved into the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and the Juan Diego Route pilgrims were in the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston. The Serra Route pilgrims were preparing to leave the Boise Diocese for the Diocese of Salt Lake City; and the Marian Route pilgrims were preparing to leave the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis to enter Minnesota’s Diocese of Winona-Rochester, which is led by Bishop Robert E. Barron, who in 2019 first proposed the idea of a National Eucharistic Revival. On the May 29 media call, the perpetual pilgrims acknowledged that their packed days can sap their energy. As they aim to become more like Jesus through time with him in the Eucharist, that also means “ourselves becoming a kind of broken bread, and abandoning yourself to that,” Weiss said. “We've had some days where we would get up at 5 a.m. and we'll hit four or five different parishes by 10 a.m. And, it's like 10 a.m. and I'm like, 'Gosh, it's already so many parishes, and I can't keep them apart,'” Weiss said with a laugh. “But one of the beautiful things is that the Lord really provides then with some kind of spark, some kind of amazing encounter that really makes you realize again what is happening and the impact that the pilgrimage is having.”",

    "text": "April 2025 Capitol Hill Campaign Features Grassroots Demands for U.S. Action on Genocide Justice and Regional Security\nWASHINGTON—The Armenian National Committee of America mobilized a broad-based, nationwide coalition of advocates for a powerful two-day campaign on Capitol Hill – April 1st and 2nd – advancing urgent calls for U.S. action to confront Azerbaijani and Turkish aggression, demand justice for the Armenian and Artsakh Genocides, and secure lasting peace and security in the South Caucasus. ANCA advocates participated in over 100 in-person meetings with Congressional offices and hand-delivered legislative briefing materials to all 540 House and Senate offices.\n“Year after year, the strength of our Eastern Region delegation continues to grow – bringing a principled and passionate message of justice to Capitol Hill,” stated Dr. Ara Chalian, Chairman of the ANCA Eastern Region. “Our advocates carry with them the hopes of survivors, the resilience of our people, and the determination to ensure our story is told, remembered, and honored through concrete policy action.”\n“We are building a movement that reflects the full geographic and generational diversity of our community,” said Oshin Harootoonian, Chairman of the ANCA Western Region. “Advocacy Days are not just about Washington – they’re about nationwide empowerment. This year, our Western Region was proud to send a record number of participants, with activists representing every corner of our expansive Armenian American community – from California to Texas, Nevada to Washington.”\n“We are nurturing the next generation of advocates who will continue to defend Armenian rights on Capitol Hill and beyond,” stated Gev Iskajyan, ANCA National Grassroots Director. “It was inspiring to witness so many of our community’s youth take the lead in Congressional meetings, confidently articulating our demands for justice and accountability.”\nA standout feature of this year’s ANCA Advocacy Days was the active involvement of university students and young professionals, many of whom are alumni of the ANCA’s youth empowerment initiatives, including the Hovig Apo Saghdejian Capital Gateway Program, Leo Sarkisian Internship & Maral Melkonian Avetisyan Fellowship, ANCA Rising Leaders and Lucine Kouchakdjian Capital Hill days, Kasparian Summer Academy, and the ANCA Western Region Internship Program. These young leaders – active in university Armenian Student Associations and chapters of the Armenian Youth Federation – brought passion, professionalism, and a deep personal commitment to the Armenian Cause. Their participation underscored the vitality and continuity of the Armenian American civic movement, as students from across the country took time away from their studies to advocate for justice and stand in solidarity with their homeland.\nCoordinated by the ANCA Eastern and Western Regions, Advocacy Days featured comprehensive briefings and policy workshops, equipping first-time participants and returning activists alike for impactful Congressional outreach. Advocates presented members of Congress with the ANCA’s April 2025 policy memos, outlining legislative priorities that included:\nAdvocates urged lawmakers to sign a bipartisan letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio demanding the immediate release of Armenian POWs, Artsakh leaders, and civilian detainees held by Azerbaijan. They emphasized the importance of imposing Global Magnitsky sanctions on Azerbaijani officials responsible for torture, sham trials, and gross human rights violations.\nParticipants advocated for a U.S.-backed peace process that includes tangible security guarantees for Armenia, addresses Azerbaijan’s attempts to derail peace through coercive diplomacy, and upholds the internationally protected right of return for Armenians of Artsakh.\nThe ANCA called for co-sponsorship of the Armenian Genocide Education Act—allocating $10 million to the Library of Congress to fund public education initiatives—while also urging members to issue public statements recognizing the 110th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.\nAdvocates highlighted Azerbaijan’s systemic destruction of Armenian churches and cemeteries, and Turkey’s continued denial of the Armenian Genocide. They called for Congressional action to promote historical truth and cultural preservation.\n“Advocacy Days are the very embodiment of civic engagement,” stated ANCA Chairman George Aghjayan. “They unite, in practice, our community behind our shared principles – securing Armenia, restoring Artsakh, protecting Armenian lives and land, and forging a safe and prosperous future for all Armenians. I am, as always, deeply inspired by our activists – from students to seasoned advocates – who traveled great distances to be here. Their participation is a powerful reminder to lawmakers that the Armenian American voice is organized, informed, and persistent in our pursuit of truth and accountability.”\nThe capstone of the two-day effort was a compelling April 2nd Capitol Hill observance titled “Reversing the 2023 Artsakh Genocide | Remembering the 1915-23 Armenian Genocide,” featuring remarks and support by Senators Cory Booker (NJ), Andy Kim (NJ), Ed Markey (MA), and Adam Schiff (CA), as well as Congressional Armenian Caucus leaders Frank Pallone (NJ) and Brad Sherman (CA), and Representatives Gabe Amo (RI), Herb Conaway (NJ), Jim Costa (CA), Laura Friedman (CA), George Latimer (NY), and Jim McGovern (MA). The event, organized by the Congressional Armenian Caucus and the Armenian American community groups, underscored a unified demand for decisive U.S. leadership: to impose sanctions on Turkey and Azerbaijan, to ensure the release of all Armenian POWs and hostages, to guarantee the right of return for the Armenians of Artsakh under international protection, and to end Turkey and Azerbaijan’s denial of their genocidal actions as a cornerstone to justice for these crimes.\nFor more information about ANCA Advocacy Days or to get involved in year-round advocacy, visit the website or contact the ANCA at anca@anca.org, ANCA Eastern Region at ancaer@anca.org, or the ANCA Western Region at info@ancawr.org.",
