    "text": "Olivia Talalay was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when she was eight.\nAt 15, she was one of 170 children from across the world who were able to travel to Washington, D.C., to advocate for policies related to the disease, such as the renewal of the Special Diabetes Program and advancement of cell therapy clinical trials.\n“It’s just about really pushing for a cure and to make type one diabetes more visible for people because a lot of people really don’t know what type one diabetes is,” Talalay said.\nTalalay, who lives in Plainview, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in third grade. She had rapid weight loss, extreme thirst and fatigue. After her diagnosis, she spent several days learning to count carbohydrates and administer insulin and prick her finger multiple times a day to test her glucose levels.\nAfter her diagnosis, Talalay and her family immediately joined Breakthrough T1D, a leading global type 1 diabetes research and advocacy organization. She became an ambassador for the organization, volunteering and fundraising.\nTalalay was then selected as one of seven people from the area, and one of 170 delegates to go to Washington, D.C. from July 7 to July 9 to advocate for type 1 diabetes research\nOther delegates came from Australia, Canada, Israel, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\nWhile in the nation’s capital, the children met with members of Congress, highlighting the need to renew the Special Diabetes Program. They also attended interactive sessions with T1D role models, including designers, athletes, and media figures, and engaged in leadership training and team-building activities.\nTalalay said it’s important for delegates like herself to have been a part of the program.\n“It feels really good because I know that so many kids will benefit from this,” Talalay said.\nBreakthrough T1D said the Children’s Congress program was inspired by a boy from Massachusetts who asked his mother, “Why can’t kids go to Washington and tell their representatives about what it’s like to have type 1 diabetes and let them know that we want scientists to find a cure?”\nThe program has sent over 1,000 kids to the country’s capital since 1999 to advocate for continued research into type 1 diabetes.\n“Every day, these youth and their parents face the burden of type 1 diabetes, and by sharing their stories, they become powerful advocates in the fight to end this disease,” Greater New York Metro Chapter Associate Executive Director Kelly Borzell said. “Children’s Congress empowers youth living with type 1 diabetes to speak with a unified voice to urge Federal leaders to support the entire T1D community.”\nTalalay said that advocacy has led to strides in the search for a cure to type 1 diabetes.\n“It’s not really what if we find a cure, it’s when,” she said.”We’re right around the corner.”\nBreakthrough T1D sent 170 representatives to Washington, D.C. this year and has sent over 1,000 children since 1999.

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "From a shared doc to nine million members: How WaytoAGI grew into a global AI tribe",
    "text": "[100 AI Creators]is a weekly series featuring conversations with China’s leading minds in[artificial intelligence]. As technology evolves, their perspectives shed light on the ideas driving the AI era across borders.\nIn the age of AI, some things are quietly slipping beyond explanation.\nTake this: nine million people have joined a community. It has no capital backing, no traffic funnels, no big-name endorsements. These people showed up of their own accord, stayed, organized, and built. They are active in nearly ten countries, scattered across the world’s major tech hubs. From technical geeks to entrepreneurs, from students to engineers, people are growing, clashing, and even reinventing their identities—all inside the same system.\nThis community is called WaytoAGI. At first glance, it seems like a roadmap toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). But in practice, it’s something else entirely: a new kind of structure that’s expansive yet decentralized, evolving organically across the globe.\nIt’s not a product, but it’s more active and sticky than most products. It’s not a company, but it wields outsized power to mobilize. It has never done brand marketing, yet it’s cultivating a whole new sense of belonging.\nWithin WaytoAGI, AI is regarded not just as tech or tool. Rather, it’s a shared language, a belief system, and even a new kind of everyday human reality.\nSo who started all this?\nThe founder is self-styled simply as AJ, her oversight of WaytoAGI makes her the unofficial leader of the world’s largest AI community. Anytime you see her, she’s in workwear, with a Bose headset hanging around her neck like a permanent plugin.\nBy any measure, AJ doesn’t look like the head of a nine-million-member network. She has never raised funding. She’s never given an interview. In fact, just six months ago, she was working as a product manager at an internet company in Hangzhou, leading a normal and otherwise quiet life.\nBut somewhere along the way, she unintentionally initiated WaytoAGI. It started with a single shared document, an internal knowledge base of sorts, and that kept expanding. Today, it counts nine million users, monthly offline meetups in 37 cities, an international AI conference in Tokyo, and a loosely defined global network still unfolding in real time.\nThere’s no standard title that captures AJ.\nShe’s neither a typical influencer nor a founder in the traditional sense. It’s more like she created a framework, and millions of others began to fill it in. She launched an initiative, and people around the world mobilized. Her focus isn’t on growth for growth’s sake, but rather to light a spark: that internal “I want to do something too” feeling.\nShe’s more igniter than rulemaker. So the real question isn’t what WaytoAGI is doing, but how it’s even possible:\n- How did it scale without traditional incentives?\n- How does its structure, one that functions without formal governance, be more efficient than corporations?\n- How did AI and community meld to become a new identity-generating mechanism?\n- And why do people feel the need for a “way to AGI” as a spiritual home?\nEven AJ herself might not have all the answers.\nShe has simply been building, one document and one workshop at a time, like she’s snapping Lego bricks together. And somewhere along the way, a whole new playground emerged.\nAI Now! sat down with AJ for her inaugural public interview to learn more.\nThe following transcript has been edited and consolidated for brevity and clarity.\nFrom a Feishu form to nine million users\nAI Now! (AN): How did WaytoAGI get started? We heard it began as a Feishu form?\nAJ: It was around the end of 2022, when GPT-3.5 had just launched. I tried it, and it gave me goosebumps. A bunch of us were getting ready for a ski trip, and I remember using GPT to write a made-up biography for a friend. It was so good at weaving in these quirky little real-life details. That’s when I felt: this time, AI is really different.\nI was also experimenting with tools like Midjourney, DALL-E, Notion AI. Some image generators still weren’t great, but ChatGPT gave me this intense sense that AGI might actually be within reach.\nI got obsessed, trying every new tool and collecting resources. Every day some new AI product would pop up, even if it was just a waitlist asking for your email. But those landing pages, just by flashing “AI,” would spark everyone’s imagination.\nAnd I’m the kind of person who has to share. So I started thinking, how do I aggregate all this cool new stuff and share it widely?\nI started building a knowledge base inside my company’s internal wiki, Yuque. But it wasn’t great for external sharing. Then I tried Notion, but access was clunky in China. So I switched to Feishu (known internationally as Lark).\nAN: When did the Feishu doc go live?\nAJ: April 26, 2023.\nAt first, I wasn’t trying to build a community. I just didn’t want all this valuable information to get buried under a wave of paywalled AI courses and reseller schemes. I wanted to create a clean, tech-focused space for people who were genuinely curious.\nBy that time, I’d already accumulated a lot of content: hundreds of tools, tutorials, use cases, and fun experiments.\nI added a survey at the bottom and invited people to help build the database together.\nAN: Did you promote it? Growth seemed to take off really quickly.\nAJ: It was just me posting on WeChat. Then some friends in tech circles helped spread the word.\nBut I was so into it. I’d meet friends in person and excitedly invite them to join. Within two to three months, we were hitting a million visits.\nAN: Was there a moment where you felt things were getting out of hand?\nAJ: The numbers didn’t faze me. I’d worked on e-commerce campaigns at Tmall, managing massive traffic spikes, like when servers crashed on Singles’ Day.\nBut this was different. At Tmall, you had to spend money to get traffic. Return on investment was everything.\nWith WaytoAGI, all I did was geek out and invite friends. And people just came. Not to grab free stuff or make money, but to contribute. They were building wikis, sharing research.\nThere was no financial incentive, just passion. That blew my mind.\nAN: Where do you think that passion came from?\nAJ: I think people were genuinely excited by what AI might become. Everyone felt that they saw a glimpse of the future and wanted to know: what are others doing with it?\nAt the same time, AI was so new that everyone was starting from scratch. So there wasn’t much gatekeeping by supposed experts. Instead it was mostly pure, honest knowledge sharing.\nLike this guy Li Jigang, who started posting his own prompts in the group. People tested them, feedbacked that they are amazing, and that encouraged him to keep going. Eventually, we compiled all his prompts into a separate document library.\nAN: So, it went from sharing to co-building.\nAJ: Exactly. In our community, being a co-builder is the highest honor.\nLook at ComfyUI. It’s a visual interface for generative AI, built entirely by the community. They could have made it closed-source or commercialized it, but they chose to open it up. It lets them iterate faster, but I also think many people simply want to be part of building the future.\nThe same is true for Dify and other startups that spun off from our community. Most of them weren’t trying to monetize at first. They just really believed in what they were building.\nWe joked that our whole community runs on “love power.” But it’s true. The love is real.\nAN: With all that content, it must be tempting to monetize.\nAJ: Tons of people told me I should lock the content behind a paywall or sell courses. Even if I charged just RMB 9.9 (USD 1.4) or RMB 19.9 (USD 2.8) per resource, I could easily make millions.\nBut the community was built on openness from day one. I want to keep it that way. I want people to be able to learn for free, forever.\nIf I cashed in, the spirit would change.\nAN: That’s your view. But how do you ensure others don’t exploit the content?\nAJ: That’s something I care deeply about.\nSo we made a rule: Content created in the community can be referenced, but not directly copied or resold. We encourage people to internalize the knowledge, build on it, and then use it to teach or earn money.\nI’d actually love to see more people making a living through AI, but from their own work and not by copy and pasting what others have made.\nIt has happened before. Someone we didn’t know packaged up our content to sell courses. Claimed it was “exclusive.” The whole community mobilized and reported him everywhere. He was shut down in the end. I was moved. It proved that we’ve built a shared culture worth protecting.\nAN: From a product design perspective, what made WaytoAGI so sticky?\nAJ: First, the content quality is genuinely high.\nCo-builders often hesitate to submit material because they worry it’s “not good enough.” They put so much care into every contribution—tearing things down, polishing them, making sure it’s worthy of the group.\nWe never used financial incentives. It was about earning each other’s respect.\nThere’s also a strong sense of altruism. People question what are the common roadblocks in the moment, and whether there’s a faster solution that can be offered. They aren’t looking to tick boxes, but sincerely want to save others time.\nThat’s pure product thinking: empathy, usefulness, clarity.\nIt reminds me of a quote by Wang Yangming that espouses the virtue of benefitting others, without seeking personal gain. That’s the spirit here. We’re not chasing fame or money. We just figured something out, and we want to share it.\nThat simple instinct turned this from a basic content hub into a living, breathing place. Like an intelligent organism.\nHosting a global AI conference in Tokyo\nAN: How did you come up with the name WaytoAGI? Isn’t it a little grand, maybe even over the top?\nAJ: It totally was. I was in a state of extreme excitement. Every day brought a new model, a new tool, a new possibility. It felt like the future was showing up tomorrow.\nAN: So do you really believe AGI will happen?\nAJ: I’m a hardcore accelerationist. If AGI is where we’re headed, we might as well write it in the name. Make it clear: this is the longest, wildest road, and we’re taking it.\nAN: You’ve said you’re drawn to novelty and thrills. How does the high from AI compare to other adrenaline hits in your life?\nAJ: I’m an ENFP. I love new stuff, but I burn out quickly. When Uber launched in China, I signed up as a driver just to see what it was like. After work, I’d drive around picking up passengers. It was fun.\nI also love skiing, especially pushing past fear on high slopes or jumping park rails. Those moments when you realize you can accomplish something? I live for that kind of dopamine.\nBut AI? It’s a different level. It’s not just about personal milestones. It’s watching a new world come into existence every day.\nAN: It’s like history is moving through you.\nAJ: Exactly. And you’re not alone. Tens of thousands of people are racing alongside you.\nAN: You hosted a global AI conference in Japan. Why Tokyo?\nAJ: Because it felt cool? Maybe it’s my “P” personality. I tend to do things on impulse.\nBut it wasn’t completely random. Back in November, we held a ComfyUI community meetup in Tokyo which focused on generative visual tools. People like Yan Junjie, the founder of MiniMax, showed up. That gave us a tiny foundation.\nMainly, we didn’t want to keep our conversations locked inside China. A lot of us are in touch with developers and creators abroad, on platforms like X and YouTube. We wanted a place that was easy for foreigners to attend, didn’t need visas, and didn’t feel overly corporate. Tokyo just made sense.\nAN: Was it hard to pull off an international conference as a grassroots group?\nAJ: Definitely. From the time we decided to do it to the actual opening day, we had just one month.\nVenue hunting was a nightmare. Most places in Japan can only fit 200 people max. But a friend helped us get in touch with J F Oberlin University in Shinjuku. It was a newer campus, with a hall that could fit over a thousand people. That changed everything.\nWe didn’t hire an event agency. It was all community volunteers. Every day, we’d walk through Kabukicho to go “to work.”\nSponsorship? It took three weeks. We were mentally prepared to just pay out of pocket if no one came through.\nAN: How did you convince sponsors to back something you’d never done before?\nAJ: It was all sheer conviction and enthusiasm, really.\nSome people asked why we should be the ones to host this, and whether we could actually pull it off. I’d respond by asking: is anyone else doing it?\nNone of us had experience organizing an AI conference, let alone one overseas. Still, the energy was incredible. Volunteers poured in, many from our own community. Most had full-time jobs at major firms, yet they took time off and paid their own way to Japan. We handled everything—from inviting speakers to setting up the venue and finalizing the agenda. People joked that we were more excited about this than our actual jobs.\nWhen the conference opened, all kinds of attendees showed up: Japan’s major corporations, automakers, startups, and even SoftBank. We planned for 1,000 attendees but ended up with 1,500. NHK came and filmed the whole thing.\nAfterward, we reflected on why people came despite our scrappy setup. The answer was simple: scarcity. In Japan, no one else was organizing anything like this. And the atmosphere at the event was electric. Some sessions were so packed that people had to stand in the back.\nAN: What is Japan’s AI scene like?\nAJ: To be honest, China is way ahead. Many Japanese AI startups are still in early stages: basic wrappers, not much depth. Their biggest advantage is being local: they have corporate clients and access to capital.\nAfter the conference, we actually had this wild idea: What if we flipped the model and helped China’s best AI projects expand into Japan?\nWe joked we could help “launder” them into Japan-based companies and find their local product-market fit.\nDoing the same thing with strangers across 37 cities\nAN: In June, your AI “jamming sessions” happened in 37 cities at the same time. How did this format evolve?\nAJ: Honestly, it grew in the weirdest, most organic way.\nEarly on, we hosted a hackathon in Dali, and a bunch of people traveled in from other provinces just to participate. That made it clear: AI folks really crave in-person interaction.\nBack then, I joked we should do a “world tour” of sorts, spanning ten countries, 100 cities. I was totally winging it.\nThen we hosted a meetup in Hangzhou. We delayed registration until a week before, figuring turnout would be low. But it was packed. People were flying in from all over China.\nThat gave us the idea: What if people just held events in their own cities? It would be cheaper, more sustainable. So at the end of March 2024, we tried it in five cities at once.\nAN: Which five cities did you start with?\nAJ: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou.\nThe reason was simple: those were the cities where ByteDance had offices, and we needed event space. We asked some folks inside ByteDance to let us borrow meeting rooms. That’s how it started.\nAN: Now that you’re in over 30 cities at once, who runs it all?\nAJ: We keep it flexible. The only fixed rule is that the jam session happens on the last Sunday of each month. If someone in a city wants to host and seems capable, they just apply to be the local “initiator.”\nAt the start of each event, all cities connect via video call for a quick hello. Then each group breaks out for local activities like talks, demos, or discussions. Each city has its own volunteers. They handle guest invites, venue setup, logistics, everything.\nAN: What was the most unexpected city that joined?\nAJ: Definitely Korla.\nAN: As in Korla, Xinjiang? Are there AI people there?\nAJ: That’s exactly what I thought.\nThe initiator there had come to one of our events in Hangzhou. Afterwards, he said: “I’m taking this energy back home.” He had felt the excitement, the possibilities, and wanted his hometown to experience that too. So he hosted the inaugural Korla session. It drew a crowd.\nThat’s the power of AI. It doesn’t care about your job title or past resume. If you’re curious and motivated, you can join the game.\nThere is also this guy in Kunming who worked in construction engineering. After spending time in the community, he started coding with AI tools. Now he’s building stuff left and right. It gave him a kind of feedback he never got before.\nAN: Have you seen people radically change their lifestyles after joining WaytoAGI, like quitting jobs?\nAJ: Does mine count? I quit my job earlier this year.\nThen I went skiing in Altay for two months. Days on the slopes, nights hosting community live streams. We didn’t want to miss the DeepSeek traffic boom over the Lunar New Year.\nSometimes I feel like we’ve lured more and more people into becoming “free-roaming creatives.” That’s what we call ourselves now. Before AI, everyone was working in big tech companies. No one imagined a different way to live. But actually, a lot of people are creative and capable. If they didn’t have to work, they’d still build cool things.\nThis morning at 6 a.m, a friend dropped by and said that he quit too. He used to be at a major tech firm. Now he’s writing code with AI tools, built nearly ten sites, and wins hackathons, some with USD 5,000 prizes.\nHe always had the talent, but it was trapped in the daily grind. Now he’s free to experiment, get quick feedback, and improve.\nAN: Do you have any kind of formal structure now? Like roles, decisions, processes?\nAJ: I really don’t want this community to become a “company.” People come here because it’s open, because anything can happen.\nOf course, someone has to do the hard operational work. Luckily, we now have a few full-timers in the community. They are professionals. Extremely reliable. But we’re still trying to avoid hard rules or hierarchy.\nAN: At Feishu’s developer conference, you announced a new AI-native talent platform. Other AI products for social networking exist. What makes yours different?\nAJ: Many AI products focus on social interactions, but most start as tools before trying to add social features later.\nWe’re the opposite. We started with people, because communities are made of people. We already know who’s here in our community, where they are on their journey, what they need next.\nWe don’t want to just be a new social space or shiny interface. The platform will be a space with a built-in knowledge base and growth paths. It’s about helping people be seen and found, by those who need them. It’s about becoming part of the real AI wave, and getting real rewards for it.\nAN: If your community has a core belief, what would it be? A shared faith in the AI-driven future? A culture of wanting to live differently?\nAJ: I don’t think it’s a fixed creed. It’s more like a collective scent, or a vibe.\nI’m a natural risk taker. And I think a lot of people in the community are, too. We’re not satisfied with life as it is. We want to try building a new world with our own hands. Even if we’re not sure what tomorrow looks like, we have to make it different.\nIn the AI era, everyone has a chance to become a creator. It’s like standing on a map that’s just been unrolled. You’re a little scared, but mostly thrilled. So you start walking, and sketching the map as you go.\nAI is like a ship that suddenly appeared. No one knows where it’ll end up, but you don’t want to be left on the shore. We’re the ones who already jumped on. Learning, building, and playing—together.\nAN: Was there a moment when you felt WaytoAGI had a life of its own?\nAJ: Totally. It feels like a young deer.\nAN: And if it ever stops moving, why would that be?\nAJ: I don’t think it can stop. If it slows down, we’ll find a new way to move it. We’ll take the whole crew and keep wandering the world.\n100 AI Creators is a collaborative project between AI Now! and KrASIA, highlighting trailblazers in AI. Know an AI talent we should feature?

    "title": "Dallas Mavericks puede sostenerse bien pese a la lesión de Luka Doncic: esta es la clave",
    "text": "Tras un inicio negativo en las primeras semanas de la temporada, [Dallas Mavericks](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/dallas-mavericks) se acomodó muy bien y ya está en el top 4 de la Conferencia Oeste y muy cerca del segundo lugar, a pesar de la derrota navideña ante Minnesota Timberwolves en casa.\nEse partido les dejó una pésima noticia más allá de sumar una caída más: [Luka Dončić](https://ar.global.nba.com/players/luka_don/) sufrió una lesión muscular de cierta gravedad en la parte trasera de su pierna izquierda. Todavía faltan los resultados de los estudios, pero parece que el desgarro sufrido por el esloveno es de algo más que grado 1, lo que haría que necesite de varias semanas para recuperarse.\n\"Aunque llevemos un récord de 6-2 sin él, ese número no me importa a mí. Preferiría ir a la guerra, ir a la batalla, con un equipo completo\", declaró Kyrie Irving al respecto. Sin embargo, los Mavs tienen motivos para pensar en que sin Luka pueden sostenerse entre los primeros lugares del Oeste.\nMás | |\nDallas Mavericks puede sostenerse bien a pesar de la lesión de Luka Dončić: esta es la clave\nCon un guardia tan talentoso como Kyrie Irving en el equipo es más fácil tratar de disimular la baja de Doncic: Kyrie es uno de los mejores bases de la liga y, haciéndose cargo de un rol mucho más importante en el ataque de los Mavericks, les asegura seguir contando con un anotador fenomenal y gran playmaker al mismo tiempo.\nSin embargo, el destacado récord de 6-1 de Dallas en los partidos en los que jugó Irving y no lo hizo Doncic en esta temporada no obedece a un protagonismo excepcional del exCleveland como anotador, rol que sí tomó en los minutos sin Luka ante Minnesota. De hecho Irving promedió 24.1 puntos en esos siete encuentros: es una cifra alta, pero no difiere de los 24 puntos por partido que promedia en toda la temporada o los 25.6 que anotaba en la campaña pasada.\nMás sobre la NBA: [Posiciones](https://ar.global.nba.com/standings/) | [Resultados](https://ar.global.nba.com/scores/) | [Máximos anotadores](https://ar.global.nba.com/statistics/) | [Calendario](https://ar.global.nba.com/schedule/)\nTampoco es que sin Doncic (y con Irving) Dallas ha ganado por presentar un nivel defensivo superior: en las últimas dos presentaciones festejó al dejar a sus rivales por debajo de los 97 puntos, pero los otros cuatro triunfos con esa configuración del equipo fueron a pesar de recibir entre 114 y 120 unidades, mientras que Miami Heat, el que logró vencerlos, les anotó 114 en el tiempo reglamentario y otros nueve en la prórroga.\nLa cuestión para Dallas pasa por cómo mantenerse como uno de los mejores ataques de la liga (es el de [cuarto mejor rating ofensivo en la temporada](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?dir=A&sort=OFF_RATING)). Y en eso tiene una importancia central su tiro de tres puntos.\nMás | [Por qué la lesión de Luka Doncic en Navidad puede arruinar su temporada individual](https://www.sportingnews.com/es/nba/dallas-mavericks/news/por-que-lesion-luka-doncic-arruinar-temporada-individual/293f1bb9831652d4dc30ac3c)\nDallas lejos está de ser uno de los equipos que más tira de tres (35.8 intentos por partido, el sexto equipo del Oeste que menos lo realiza), pero es efectivo como pocos con un 37.7% de acierto que en el Oeste solo es superado por Phoenix Suns por un 0.5%.\nEntre Irving, Klay Thompson, PJ Washington y Quentin Grimes convirtieron un 41.1% de sus triples de la temporada y Dallas se ha mantenido por encima del rango del 37% en esos partidos sin Doncic cuando ganó, con porcentajes de 41%, 37%, 45%, 51%, 38% y 40%. En cambio, contra Miami Heat apenas acertó el 25% de 40 tiros de tres puntos y se fue derrotado.\nEN VIVO: [Mira partidos seleccionados de Dallas Mavericks por Disney+, con 50% de descuento por los primeros tres meses](https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/2436205/2423514/9358)\nEs que por fuera de Irving y de lo que sumen Daniel Gafford o Dereck Lively II cerca del aro o con tiros libres (promedian 20.7 puntos por partido entre los dos), la principal herramienta de los Mavs para anotar está en el tiro de tres puntos. La excepción a esto es Naji Marshall, que tuvo un rol preponderante en esos partidos de noviembre con Doncic ausente: hilvanó cuatro partidos consecutivos en los que convirtió entre 20 y 26 puntos jugando menos de 31 minutos en cada encuentro.\nUna lesión frenó a Marshall en ese momento y diciembre no ha sido el mejor mes para él: jugó 5 partidos con 20.7 minutos por noche y un promedio de 9.6 puntos por partido. Ahora, sin Doncic, los Mavericks necesitan que Marshall demuestre que puede volver a ser ese jugador de forma consistente, la clave para sostener bien a Dallas.\nSi compras un producto o registras una cuenta a través de alguno de los links de nuestro sitio, podríamos recibir una retribución.",

    "title": "Biden emite orden que sanciona a los colonos violentos en Cisjordania",
    "text": "El presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, emitió este jueves una orden ejecutiva para sancionar a las personas que apoyen la violencia de los colonos judíos en Cisjordania, una medida que, según su administración, refleja un \"enfoque holístico\" del conflicto de Gaza.\n\"Estamos adoptando un enfoque holístico para toda esta crisis, no sólo en Gaza, sino en el contexto más amplio: Israel, Gaza, Cisjordania y la región en general\", dijo un funcionario de la administración a los periodistas durante una llamada el jueves.\nEs probable que Biden, quien está de visita en de campaña el Michigan, encuentre una oleada de oposición en un estado con una de las poblaciones árabe-estadounidenses más grandes del país.\nLos miembros de esa comunidad se encuentran entre un número cada vez mayor de estadounidenses que han expresado su preocupación por el firme apoyo de Biden a la agresiva operación militar de Israel en respuesta al\nataque del grupo militante Hamás del 7 de octubre contra civiles israelíes.\nSin embargo, una encuesta del New York Times/Siena College publicada en diciembre encontró que casi la misma cantidad de estadounidenses cree que Israel debería avanzar hacia la victoria total incluso frente a las crecientes bajas civiles.\nHasta ahora, Biden ha resistido la presión para pedir un alto el fuego, diciendo que Israel tiene derecho a defenderse.\nLa nueva orden apunta a personas que la Casa Blanca considera que alientan la violencia en Cisjordania. Los funcionarios de la Casa Blanca no nombraron a los señalados durante la sesión informativa.\n\"El presidente Biden también ha hablado de su preocupación por el aumento de la violencia que hemos visto en Cisjordania por parte de actores extremistas, en particular el aumento de la violencia de los colonos extremistas, que alcanzó niveles récord en 2023\", dijo el asesor de seguridad nacional Jake Sullivan en una declaración el jueves.\n\"Esta violencia plantea una grave amenaza a la paz, la seguridad y la estabilidad en Cisjordania, Israel y la región de Oriente Medio, y amenaza la seguridad nacional y los intereses de política exterior de Estados Unidos\".\nEl funcionario de la Casa Blanca dijo que los actos identificados por la orden incluyen \"actos de intimidación y destrucción de propiedad que conducen al desplazamiento forzado de comunidades palestinas\". Un individuo, dijo el funcionario, \"inició y dirigió un motín que implicó incendiar vehículos y edificios\".\n¡Conéctate con la Voz de América!

    "text": "Investing.com - Pudo ser un día glorioso para la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, pero un golpe asestado desde la Cámara de Diputados le quitó el brillo al Índice de Precios y Cotizaciones (IPC) al cierre de la jornada de este jueves, 6 de junio.\nLa mayor parte de la jornada fue positiva para el mercado bursátil mexicano, en el que el S&P/BMV IPC llegó a remontar incluso más de 2%, neutralizando al fin la pérdida de 6.1% que registró el lunes 3 de junio , un día después de las elecciones. El desplome a inicios de la semana fue su peor caída diaria desde el inicio de la pandemia por Covid-19 .\nSin embargo, en el último tramo de las negociaciones, el optimismo cedió, con el IPC mostrando un comportamiento volátil que lo llevó a tocar, por momentos, el terreno de las pérdidas diarias. Al final, logró cerrar con una ganancia de apenas 0.12%, pero llevando el balance nuevamente a los números rojos, observando todavía una pérdida de 1.28% respecto al cierre del viernes, de acuerdo con los datos disponibles en Investing.com .\n¡Aún es momento de invertir en acciones mexicanas!... ¿O no? Descúbrelo con InvestingPro , donde además hallarás una amplia variedad de valores y estrategias probadas para maximizar tus ganancias: Haz clic aquí para obtener un DESCUENTO EXCLUSIVO en tu suscripción de un año .⚠️ ALERTA ⚠️ ¡Únete hoy mismo que solo nos quedan pocos descuentos! A final, las 35 empresas más grandes y de mayor bursatilidad que componen el IPC terminaron con un saldo mixto; por un lado, Grupo Financiero Banorte (BMV: GFNORTEO ) lideró nuevamente las pérdidas, al cerrar con un retroceso de 3.85% (es decir, casi todo lo que ganó en la sesión anterior), mientras que Regional SAB de CV (BMV: RA ), también del sector financiero, salió victoriosa con una ganancia de 5.13%, aunque hasta hoy aún no se recupera de la caída de 13.41% que sufrió el lunes.\nLa moderación en el avance observado a lo largo de la jornada ocurrió después de que los mercados conocieron la noticia de que en septiembre podrían aprobarse reformas constitucionales en México, ya con la nueva composición del legislativo que otorga mayoría calificada a los partidos oficialistas en la Cámara Baja.\n“La volatilidad se exacerbó el día de hoy, porque de acuerdo con Ignacio Mier, quien es el Coordinador de la Cámara de Diputados de Morena, señaló en conferencia de prensa en la cámara permanente, que estarían votando las iniciativas de reformas presentadas por AMLO el pasado mes de febrero, que básicamente contienen las reformas al poder judicial, la reforma militar, al Instituto Nacional Electoral y la desaparición de órganos autónomos”, explicaron Alejandra Marcos y Alejandro Fajardo, economistas en Intercam Banco, en una nota de análisis.\nEstas son reformas que generan incertidumbre entre los inversionistas pues, bajo su perspectiva, podrían reducir la certidumbre jurídica y la estabilidad democrática del país.\nEn los momentos de incertidumbre, los inversionistas deben tomar las decisiones de manera informada para saber en qué momento comprar o vender una acción. ¿Temes no tener una estrategia ganadora ?

Balde de agua fría para el peso mexicano De acuerdo con los datos en tiempo real de Investing.com , el tipo de cambio concluyó la sesión en 17.98 pesos por dólar. Con este nivel de cierre, el peso mexicano borró las ganancias de la sesión previa y terminó con una pérdida de 2.83% frente al dólar estadounidense. Sin embargo, tras las declaraciones de Mier en la Cámara de Diputados, el peso mexicano llegó a sobrepasar los 18.00 por dólar.\n“La reacción del tipo de cambio confirma que el mercado sigue sensible ante riesgos para el futuro institucional de México, luego de que el pasado domingo el partido Morena y coalición ganaron mayoría calificada en la Cámara de Diputados y una amplia mayoría simple en la Cámara de Senadores, así como mayoría en 26 congresos locales, lo que les facilita la aprobación de reformas constitucionales”, explicó Gabriela Siller Pagaza, directora de Análisis Económico y Financiero en Grupo Financiero Base.\nDesde el lunes 3 de junio y hasta el cierre de hoy, el peso mexicano acumula una pérdida cercana al 6% respecto al dólar y en lo que va del 2024, el retroceso asciende a un 6.14%.\n“No se pueden descartar episodios de volatilidad durante las siguientes sesiones, como respuesta a los comentarios del presidente saliente, la presidenta electa, otros oficiales del gobierno entrante o líderes del poder legislativo”, mencionó la especialista.\nEn este ambiente de nerviosismo, los inversionistas tienen la posibilidad de proteger su cartera con acciones sólidas capaces de resistir las debacles e incluso encontrar inversiones que les generarán oportunidades a largo plazo.\nLos suscriptores de InvestingPro pueden utilizar herramientas como las listas de seguimiento que les permite identificar las acciones que tienen una mayor oportunidad de ganancias a partir del Valor de Mercado asignado exclusivamente por los algoritmos de InvestingPro .
