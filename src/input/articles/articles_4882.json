    "title": "'The King and I' Star and Miss Universe Legend Maureen Hingert Dies at 88",
    "text": "The King and I actress Maureen Hingert, a star of Hollywood’s Golden Age, has died at the age of 88 following health complications.\nThe Sri Lankan actress and Miss Universe runner-up died Sunday of liver failure at Huntington Hospital in Pasadena, California, her daughter Marisa Zamparelli told The Hollywood Reporter.\n“It was a beautiful and peaceful passing,” Marisa said.\nHingert was widely known for her work in Walter Lang’s 1956 film, The King and I, adapted from the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical of the same name. The musical, which earned nine nominations at the Academy Awards and won five, notably starred Deborah Kerr, Yul Brynner, and Rita Moreno.\nAlongside The King and I, Hingert’s resume also includes roles in Westerns like 1958’s Gun Fever and 1959’s Gunmen From Laredo. She also has appeared in dramas like 1956’s Pillars of the Sky opposite Jeff Chandler and Dorothy Malone, and 1954’s Elephant Walk starring Elizabeth Taylor.\nApart from acting, Hingert also made a legacy as a pageant contestant when she finished second runner-up at the 1955 Miss Universe contest—the first in the competition’s history to ever be televised.\nHingert, who was born in Colombo, Ceylon in January 1937, entered the competition as Miss Ceylon—a historical name for Sri Lanka—and was the first from the country to ever reach the contest’s finals. She was only 18 at the time.\nIn 1958, Hingert married Mario Armond Zamparelli, a designer largely known for his work with business tycoon and aerospace engineer Howard Hughes. The couple welcomed three children together before their divorce in 1970.\nAlongside their daughter Maria, Hingert and Mario also welcomed daughters Gina Zamparelli and Andrea Zamparelli who respectively died in 2018 and 2009.",

    "title": "Why Tellurian Stock Is Surging Today",
    "text": "Tellurian ( TELL -7.31% ) stock is making big gains in Thursday's trading. The liquified natural gas specialist's share price was up 7.4% as of 12:15 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence .\nTellurian submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today stating that it will be issuing stock to an institutional shareholder in exchange for debt held through bonds being relinquished. The move should improve the energy company's financial flexibility, and the market appears broadly bullish on the development.\nIn addition to the stock issue and bond extinguishment, a separate filing submitted to the SEC yesterday showed that another institutional investor had increased its position in Tellurian.\nTellurian is getting some institutional help Tellurian will provide 47.9 million shares of stock to High Trail Capital, an investment management firm. In exchange, $37.9 million out of a $250 million bond holding that is set to come due in 2025 will be extinguished.\nNews about the deal with High Trail follows a filing submitted to the SEC on Dec. 27 outlining new stock purchased by Chatterjee Fund Management. Per the filing, the firm has increased its ownership position in Tellurian to 7.3% -- up from its previous ownership position of 5.2%.\nWhat comes next for Tellurian stock? Between High Trail taking stock in exchange for extinguishing debt obligations and Chatterjee increasing its stock holdings in Tellurian, the liquid natural gas specialist appears to be getting some notable votes of confidence from institutional investors. The stock is still down roughly 39% year to date and 84% over the last five years, but it looks like some large stakeholders see the potential for a comeback.\nTELL data by YCharts\nTellurian is facing bankruptcy risks. If the business can deliver some meaningful turnaround progress and show signs it's capable of avoiding bankruptcy, the company's share price could skyrocket. But it remains a very high-risk investment even on the heels of big valuation pullbacks.",

    "text": "ADMA Biologics Soars 1.59% on Strong Earnings, Technical Performance\nADMA Biologics (ADMA) surged 1.59% today, marking its second consecutive day of gains, with a total increase of 10.64% over the past two days. The share price reached its highest level since November 2024, with an intraday gain of 6.26%.\nADMA Biologics' recent stock price movements can be attributed to several key factors. The company has demonstrated strong technical performance, with a high technical rating of 10 out of 10. This rating indicates positive long-term and short-term trends, with the stock outperforming 99% of all stocks and 98% within the Biotechnology industry. The increased trading volume suggests heightened investor interest, as the stock is trading near the high of its recent range.\nIn terms of growth and profitability, [adma biologics] has shown significant improvements. The company reported a 275% quarter-to-quarter EPS increase and a 485% year-over-year EPS growth. Revenue growth is also robust, with a 59.06% quarter-to-quarter increase and a 65.16% year-over-year increase. [adma] has consistently surpassed EPS estimates in recent quarters, demonstrating favorable trends in operating margin, free cash flow, and a strong Return on Equity (ROE) of 56.64%.\nMarket activity has also played a role in ADMA's stock movements. On April 21, 2025, the company's shares fell 7.84%, closing at $19.64. However, the following day saw the stock price gain 8.91%, indicating volatility and potential investor reactions to market conditions. These factors combined suggest a complex interplay of technical, growth, and market dynamics influencing ADMA Biologics' stock movements.",
