    "text": "On Thursday, the Dak Lak Centre for Elephant Conservation, Animal Rescue and Forest Protection Management co-operated with foreign experts and veterinarians to remove the two injured tusks for the elephant named Gold. The surgery was conducted to remove the elephant's broken tusks on July 18 Earlier, while playing, the elephant suddenly hit a hard tree trunk, breaking its tusks. The animal was provided with the intensive treatment at the the Dak Lak Centre for Elephant Conservation, Animal Rescue and Forest Protection Management, but the situation did not improve, causing it great pain and loss of appetite as well as weight loss. The centre invited leading global elephant experts and veterinarians to examine the elephant. According to them, Gold's broken tusks could not recover. If not properly treated, this would result in serious impacts on its health. The centre sought approval from concerned authorities for more intensive treatment methods to save the elephant. Since April, the elephant has undergone two operations to remove the tusks. Gold’s health condition has recovered quite well. In March 2016, Gold fell into a well while moving with a herd of wild elephants. The elephant was only a few months old at the time and was taken to Dak Lak Elephant Conservation Centre to be cared for.",

    "text": "Mira Costa Boys Volleyball wins the Best of The West by Hibah Samad Mira Costa High School’s Boys varsity volleyball team is celebrating a significant victory and title. Once again, the team brought home the gold at the Best of the West tournament on Saturday, March 9, at Poway High School. Regarded as the premier volleyball tournament of the high school season, the Best of the West tournament showcases top talent in the region. Mira Costa Boys Volleyball Coach Greg Snyder, a former Mustang who also played volleyball on Costa grounds, has been coaching MCHS for more than a decade. He described the moment of victory as unforgettable. But he said the team remains focused on its larger goal, a state title. “It feels incredible. It shows that our hard work is paying off,” Snyder said. “As good as it feels, this was not our ultimate goal, and everyone is hungry and motivated for more.” “It was special,” Snyder said. “We avenged our only loss of the season in the finals. The boys rushed the court after Victor’s tournament-winning back row kill.The boys were deservedly excited, especially when they saw the size of the trophy.” Mira Costa’s win is the first time in the tournament’s history that a single high school has claimed the Best of the West title four times. Snyder said that the competition is one of a kind in the annual two-day tournament. “This is the only tournament of the season that gets the best teams from out of state and other California regions,” he said. “The tournament is called Best of the West for a reason. This year’s field of teams was especially tough.” Mira Costa took on Newport Harbor in the finals, defeating the tournament’s defending champions in two sets, 25-15 and 25-19. Over thirty teams vied for the title, including top contenders and past champions. Mira Costa players Johnny Dykstra and Alex Heins earned spots on the All-Tournament Team. Mira Costa senior Victor Loiola, the team’s outside hitter, was named the MVP. “It’s always an honor to be named MVP, especially when surrounded by a group of guys that could also easily win it,” Loiola said. Loioa said that while the honor and Best of the West title were satisfying, the larger hope remains a CIF title in May. This challenge may help the team towards that goal. Loiola said it felt like they were facing adversity during the entire tournament. “We didn’t play an opponent who made it easy for us,” he said. “We were fighting for every last point.” “The players definitely grew as the tournament went on,” Snyder said. “We have had issues staying consistent and making smart choices the entirety of a match. Being down 11-13 in the third set to 15 against Carlsbad and responding was definitely a defining moment, and we got that in our first match of the day. We started steadying out after that.” Snyder said that the team’s early success was a direct result of the dedication of the coaching staff and players. “Since day 1 of preseason, everyone has bought in and done their best to achieve the team’s goals,” he said. But Snyder said they are still looking to sharpen their skills as they start Bay League this week. The Costa Boys Volleyball team is also led by assistant coaches Shane Stroyke, Canyon Ceman, Nick Sheftic, and legendary coach Mike Cook. Loiola has committed to Cal State University Long Beach. He said that the MCHS Boys Volleyball and athletic program has impacted him on the court and in the classroom. “Ever since we got a new head coach (Greg Snyder) and Athletic Director [Mike Rosenthal], and an honorable mention to our athletic trainers [Franklin and Ryan], they have taught me to be a sharper man not only on the volleyball court but also in the weight room, classroom, etc,” Loioa said. “It’s really the best athletic program out there.” Mira Costa is #1 in this week’s CIF-SS Division 1/2 rankings.

    "text": "Trump administration orders immediate stop to work on wind project near the coast of Long Beach\nInterior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered an immediate halt Wednesday to work on a planned offshore wind project near the coast of Long Beach, arguing that the Biden administration rushed the approval process.\nA memo by Burgum directed Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to direct Norwegian energy developer Equinor to \"cease all construction activities on the Empire Wind project\" until a review is completed to address \"serious deficiencies.\"\nThe company plans to erect 54 1,000-foot wind turbines, starting around 15 miles from the shore. The turbines are scheduled to be pile-driven into the seabed in coming months after Equinor obtained the necessary federal and state approvals.\nThe Biden administration approved the project in November 2023.\n\"Approval for the project was rushed through by the prior administration without sufficient analysis or consultation among the relevant agencies as relates to the potential effects from the project,\" Burgum wrote in the memo.\nLast month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order preventing agencies from issuing new or renewed wind energy leases for federal waterways, citing \"various legal deficiencies,\" the potential \"grave harm\" to shipping and fishing interests and the impact on marine mammals and birds.\nGov. Kathy Hochul issued a statement Wednesday criticizing the work stoppage.\n\"This fully federally permitted project has already put shovels in the ground before the president’s executive orders,\" Hochul wrote. \"It’s exactly the type of bipartisan energy solution we should be working on. As governor, I will not allow this federal overreach to stand.\"\nBurgum's memo came hours after Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman called on the Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department to launch investigations into whether Equinor used shortcuts to obtain permits and approvals for Empire Wind.\nAt a news conference in Long Beach with dozens of GOP lawmakers, first responders and community advocates, Blakeman argued that he approval process was unfair, hurried and done in a \"slipshod way.\"\nThe EPA said it is unaware of any agency investigation into the project, and the Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\"How did they obtain those permits?,\" Blakeman said of Equinor. \"Did they go through the proper procedures? Were all the boxes checked? Were the environmental studies done? Is this a problem for navigation? Is this a problem for commercial fishing? Is this a national security issue? Is the Defense Department concerned about these offshore wind turbines that may mask an attack from air or an attack by a submarine? There's a lot of issues out there that haven't been answered ... We are hopeful that the EPA will now be looking at the process where we think there were shortcuts and false information.\"\nEmpire Wind spokesman David Schoetz did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday but previously told Newsday the company has \"received all necessary federal permits for offshore construction and will continue to comply with the requirements of these permits.\"\nThe project has already begun work at South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, including for a new operations and maintenance facility and components for a transformer. The project will rely on an undersea cable from a planned wind-array 15 miles from Long Beach, where some residents remain staunchly opposed to it.\nEquinor originally planned to put its 54 wind turbines on giant concrete foundations, which were to be built near the Port of Albany, shipped down the Hudson River and lowered from boats onto the ocean floor.\nBut the company decided to use less expensive monopile foundations, which are pounded 197 feet into the seafloor using a massive hammer-type system mounted on a barge. Driving each monopile into the seafloor can take approximately 5,000-7,000 blows, according to an Equinor analysis, an action critics fear could have an environmental impact on marine mammals and other species.\n\"It's terrible, and it needs to stop now,\" Christina Kramer of Protect Our Coast Long Island NY, an environmental conservation group that has filed numerous objections to the project, said of the project during the news conference.\nThe New York League of Conservation Voters, which supports Empire Wind, responded in a statement that \"the Trump administration is jeopardizing thousands of union jobs, dealing a blow to clean energy, and siding with fossil fuel interests over the health and safety of New Yorkers ... Halting a fully permitted, shovel-ready project of this scale is unconscionable, especially at a time when we urgently need more clean, reliable energy to drive economic development and meet growing demand.\nLocal officials also railed Wednesday against two proposed lithium-ion battery energy storage sites in Oyster Bay: Jupiter Power's 275-megawatt project in Glenwood Landing and Calpine Corporation's planned battery site on an industrial plot adjacent to its natural gas and steam plant in Hicksville.\nThe town this month approved a six-month extension of its existing battery energy storage moratorium that was first implemented in April 2024, stalling progress on either proposal.\nTown spokeswoman Marta Kane said Oyster Bay provided preliminary feedback on the 2022 Jupiter Power project but that it hasn't been resubmitted. The town previously denied Calpine's request to be exempt from the moratorium.\nResidents have criticized Jupiter Power's $250 million project, arguing it could leave toxic remnants behind if a fire occurred. Company officials insist the project is safe, citing strict new fire safety codes.\nNassau Chief Fire Marshal Michael Uttaro Wednesday said he supports \"hitting the pause button on [the projects] until there's better research done, better codes to handle it, and without a doubt, better training for our firefighters.\"\nGarret Gray, a lawyer representing Calpine, contends the company uses different technology than the batteries used at an East Hampton storage site that went on fire in May 2023.\nWith Joseph Ostapiuk\nInterior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered an immediate halt Wednesday to work on a planned offshore wind project near the coast of Long Beach, arguing that the Biden administration rushed the approval process.\nA memo by Burgum directed Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to direct Norwegian energy developer Equinor to \"cease all construction activities on the Empire Wind project\" until a review is completed to address \"serious deficiencies.\"\nThe company plans to erect 54 1,000-foot wind turbines, starting around 15 miles from the shore.
