    "text": "Ukrainian counteroffensive was ‘quite successful’ – top official\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive against Russian forces, launched early last summer, was “quite successful,” President Vladimir Zelensky’s chief of administration, Andrey Yermak, has claimed.\nThe top aide made the remarks in an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Mundo published on Friday. Yermak dismissed suggestions that the counteroffensive outright failed or ended up stalled as “Russian propaganda.” However, he admitted that the expectations for the counteroffensive push had been set too high.\n“I agree that expectations have to meet capabilities. And taking into account the capabilities provided (the weapons received from Western allies), the counteroffensive was quite successful,” the official asserted, apparently implying that Western aid had proven to be way too limited for the counteroffensive to yield better results.\nYermak’s assessment of the counteroffensive outcome has invoked an ironic reaction in Moscow, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova suggesting that Zelensky’s chief of administration apparently failed to mention a single crucial detail.\n“He forgot to mention [Ukraine’s counteroffensive was successful] ‘for Russia,’” Zakharova wrote in a Telegram post.\nAccording to the latest estimates by Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu provided earlier this month, Ukraine lost more than 215,000 troops and 28,000 pieces of military hardware last year alone. He put the total tally nearing 400,000. According to these estimates, more than half of the casualties were sustained by the Ukrainian military during its counteroffensive push, which Moscow has repeatedly described as a failure.\nKiev has never officially disclosed the country’s casualty figures sustained amid the conflict with Russia. The heavy casualties have been indirectly corroborated by Kiev’s ever-widening mobilization effort, which has grown increasingly lawless and violent during the hostilities.\nLate last year, Zelensky claimed the country’s military had asked him to round up another 450,000 to 500,000 recruits to bolster the ranks. The announcement was made shortly before a new mobilization bill was brought before the Ukrainian parliament. It proposed lowering the draft age from 27 to 25, eliminating exemptions for some categories of disabled people, and introducing other measures to fill up the military’s ranks.\nUkrainian MPs, however, failed to agree on it, and the legislation ended up being shelved.",

    "text": "The greenfield Vadhvan port to be built along the coast in Palghar district will involve reclamation of 3,500 acres from the sea, with sand being extracted 50km from the adjacent coastline in Daman. For the upcoming Navi Mumbai airport, 2,867 acres was reclaimed.\nLocal activists, fishermen and marine ecology experts warned that accumulating sand dredged from the nearby coast would be both unscientific and detrimental to marine ecosystems.\n“The cost of dredging 2,000 million cubic metres of sand from land is Rs 12,000 crore, which includes Rs 1,440 crore as royalty to the Centre. Procuring sand from the sea will save Rs 6,000 crore compared to sand and soft rock utilised from terrestrial sources. Beyond cost efficiency, maritime mining presents negligible environmental impact versus terrestrial mining. The environment ministry has sanctioned the initiative following an assessment from IIT-Madras,” stated a release by Vadhvan Port Project Ltd, tasked with setting up the port worth Rs 76,000 crore. The ministry of mines has designated 102.8sqm for dredging, it said.\nHowever, activists warned that any sand dredging would adversely affect the marine ecosystem at both Palghar and Daman coastlines.\nMarine biologist warned colossal damage to Daman’s ecology. They say that Just 1 cubic metre of sand can weigh between 1,420kg and 1,920 kg depending on the moisture content. The sheer volume of the sand will be 30,000 crore tonnes, and the area will nearly equal the size of Aarey Milk Colony. This can change water currents in the region.\nRepresentatives from fishermen members across seven coastal districts of Maharashtra, said such sand mining decisions require public disclosure of comprehensive satellite coastal surveys. They say the land acquisition process lacks scientific rigour as people remain unaware of soil stratification along these shores. While Daman features marine sand dunes or hilly sand formations along the coast, Palghar has rocky terrain towards Vadhvan. Thus, utilising Daman sand for Vadhvan reclamation remains scientifically questionable despite financial benefits.\nTheay also expressed concern that the project will displace over 20,800 fishermen families permanently with a modest one-time settlement of Rs 6 lakh. The port will significantly alter wave patterns and vessel traffic will contaminate the area with oil, highlighting those numerous fishermen from Gorai, Uttan, Vasai, Arnala, Satpati and Dahanu currently fish at Vadhvan.",
