The NWO / Satan’s Secret Society with its many branches have distributed occult paraphernalia into society in the form of games and occult practices. Some of the games include Ouija boards, tarot cards (divination), magic art (which is precursor to Transcendental meditation and the secret ceremony which I will discuss), Dungeons and Dragons and similar \"fantasy games” just to name a few. Through the distribution of such practices the NWO / Satan’s Secret Society has placed many souls into spiritual bondage to witchcraft / demonic forces.\nMany people are not aware that they are held in spiritual captivity. Those that find out are in for an evil surprise! Is this the method that Hitler used to spiritually enslave the Nazi into committing genocide? The Mafia 666, seduces many people to participate in occult practices by there distribution into society. These so called games and practices have been distributed throughout society to cause spiritual bondage Rev 13 10. The NWO is fully aware that by this distribution they are able to enslave souls by methods of witchcraft Nahum 3, 4. If this causes a unholy baptism or the manifestation of the spirit of sin, I’m not quite sure. What I am sure of is that witchcraft works against those who have fallen into spiritual bondage / captivity Rev 13, 10. This is the method by which people are taken spiritually captive Rev.13, 10!\nI was forced with witchcraft / demonic forces to go through a transcendental meditation ceremony. The way it is done is quite amazing and almost unbelievable; but, by this spiritual bondage I was forced to go through three T.M. ceremonies consecutively. I was torcherd with mind control, sleep deprivation, Voodoo, witchcraft dreams, heart manipulation / palpitations, and many other forms of witchcraft. It sounds quite unbelievable but such is witchcraft.\nThe three ceremonies I was forced to go through were performed in what appeared to be three different sections of the brain. I was assisted through the ceremonies by witchcraft. While in one of these ceremonies I was instructed to except the worship of one of their many \"Gods\" these were no gods but demonic entities one including Satan another they named Jesus. What better way to join all religions of the world under one banner of 666. \"The powerful delusion\"' / New World Order. When they said Jesus name I was tired, scared, and confused. I just said \"yes Jesus\". After said ceremony they knew my faith was strong and that they wouldn't control me and take me captive. They new I wouldn’t shut up and that I would try and warn everyone!!! They tortured me with witchcraft and continue to try to this day. They try to stop me from informing people how this NWO is distributing the “spiritual mark of the beast”. Yes, to the beast of my knowledge the mark of the Beast is a Spiritual Mark and it is received through the method I have stated.\nI had delivered a warning to what I understood to be the Mafia 666 prior to Desert Storm. After this is when the New World Order showed me Hell on earth. I guess their really is a Nazi reign in the U.S. and it is spreading like a cancer through out society. This is how they try and control / enslave souls and take captive Rev 13. 10. These are a few scriptures giving insight. “If anyone is to go into captivity into captivity they will go” Rev 13, 10. “They overcame by the blood of the lamb and the WORD of their testimony”. “They didn’t love their lives so much as to shrink form death”. “This calls for patience and endurance on the part of the saints” Rev. 12, 11. Have they been using drug dealers to terrorize your neighborhood? Are their many \"Free\" Masons and shiners in your Government? Have you received your spiritual mark? They are in the \"Christian\" Church.\nAnonymous Coward\nUser ID: 86163175\nKazakhstan\n02/22/2024 10:38 PM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: Were the Nazi in Germany held in spiritual captivity to witchcraft / demonic forces like the New World Order?\nIt's an interesting question.\nPage\n1\nTop\nPrevious Page\nNext Page\nBack to Forum\nPost New Thread\nReply\nView Favorites\nRelated Threads\n1\nIs Revelations 13, 10 referring to Satan's Secret society and spiritual captivity to Witchcraft?\n01/22/09\n2\nWere the Nazi in Germany held in spiritual captivity to witchcraft / demonic forces like the New World Order?\n01/27/09\n3\nWere the Nazi in Germany held in spiritual captivity to witchcraft / demonic forces like the New World Order?\n01/26/09\n4\nWere the Nazi in Germany held in spiritual captivity to witchcraft / demonic forces like the New World Order?\n01/22/09\n5\nWere the Nazi in Germany held in spiritual captivity to witchcraft/demonic forces like the New World Order?\n02/11/09\n6\nWere the Nazi in Germany held in spiritual captivity to witchcraft/demonic forces like the New World Order?\n02/04/09\n7\nWere the Nazi in Germany held in spiritual captivity to witchcraft/demonic forces like the New World Order?\n01/31/09\n8\nWere the Nazi in Germany held in spiritual captivity to witchcraft/demonic forces like the New World Order?\n02/09/09\n9\nIs Revelations 13, 10 referring to Satan's Secret society and spiritual captivity to Witchcraft?\n02/11/09\n10\nIs Revelations 13, 10 referring to Satan's Secret society and spiritual captivity to Witchcraft?\n02/09/09\nRelated Topic:\nNew World Order (Conspiracy)\nDisclaimer / Copyright Info\n-\nPrivacy Policy\n-\nTerms Of Use\n-\nCancellation Policy / Billing Help\nMail\nWebmaster\nwith questions or comments about this site.\nCopyright © 1999 - 2023 Godlikeproductions.com\nPage generated in 0.025s (7 queries)",

    "title": "The Truth About RFK Jr.'s History of Heroin Addiction | Snopes.com",
    "text": "Claim: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was a heroin addict from his teenage years into adulthood. Rating: True About this rating\nIn late 2024, many people scrutinized Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s past after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump nominated him to be health secretary. Kennedy, who was an independent presidential candidate in 2024, has had a colorful history and controversial views.\nSnopes readers inquired about Kennedy's history with heroin as numerous X posts claimed he was a former addict.\n(X user @RonFilipkowski)\nKennedy was indeed a heroin addict beginning as a teenager, based on his own admissions in numerous interviews. As such, this claim is true.\nOn June 17, 2024, Kennedy appeared on the \"Shawn Ryan Show,\" a podcast hosted by a former Navy SEAL. Kennedy spoke at length about how his heroin addiction helped him in his school studies:\nI'll tell you something about heroin for me. I did very very poorly in school, until I started doing narcotics. Then I went to the top of my class because my mind was so restless and turbulent and I could not sit still. […] I'd probably today be diagnosed as ADHD, I was bouncing off the walls. I couldn't sit still, I just wanted to get in the woods. […] I started doing heroin, I went to the top of my class. Suddenly I could sit still, I could read, and I could concentrate, I could listen to what people were saying, things made sense to me. […] It worked for me. And if it still worked, I'd still be doing it. […] It killed my brother, and it destroys your relationships. It hollows out your whole life. You have a one-dimensional life. I was a bundle of appetites and it was a full time job to feed them, with drugs and sex and alcohol and extreme behavior.\nHe admitted that he was \"functional\" while addicted, and while his family had an idea that something was wrong, they didn't know how \"badly off\" he was. He also was arrested on a possession charge aboard an airline flight in 1983.\nHe makes the above remarks at the 1:21:00 mark:\nAccording to a 1984 New York Times article, Kennedy pleaded guilty to a felony charge of possessing heroin. His lawyer at the time said he was traveling to South Dakota ''for treatment, realizing he had a problem'' with drugs. Kennedy admitted himself to a drug treatment center in New Jersey just days after the arrest.\nKennedy's addiction lasted 14 years, by his own admission , and he started using heroin when he was 15, according to this 2023 interview :\nIn a 2004 profile of Kennedy by Outside magazine, he was described as the \"alpha male\" of his generation of Kennedys, who consumed more drugs than his brothers and cousins and often led them into using heroin, while keeping up his grades.\nIn the book \" The Kennedys: An American Drama \" by David Horowitz and Peter Collier — a well-regarded biographer of prominent dynastic families — Kennedy (referred to below as \"Bobby\") was frequently using heroin in the company of other boys in his family, including his cousin Chris Lawford:\nJennifer [a singer who briefly dated Lawford] saw immediately that Chris and Bobby were addicts—not mainlining heroin addicts, perhaps, although heroin was the summa drug for them—but addicted to narcotics in general: \"Christopher and Bobby liked heroin. But they'd settle for a cupful of Valium, some Percodans, or whatever else was there. Drugs were obsessive. There was a desperate need to escape.\" […] Chris tried to keep up with Bobby but he couldn't. He became more and more dependent on heroin, less and less able to \"handle it.\"\nIn late 2024, Kennedy has been trying to convince senators on Capitol Hill that he is the right choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, even though he has never worked in health care or the federal government. He is most well-known for his anti-vaccination views and for spreading misinformation around vaccines.",

    "title": "Rescued and Rehabilitated: 11 Kemp’s Ridley Sea Turtles Return to the Atlantic",
    "text": "In the cool, early hours of the morning, the shoreline at a secluded Florida beach became the backdrop for a moment of triumph and renewal. Workers from Clearwater Marine Aquarium, in a meticulous operation marked by both care and celebration, released 11 Kemp’s ridley sea turtles back into the embrace of the Atlantic Ocean. These turtles, having braved the chilling grip of cold-stun—a perilous condition akin to hypothermia in humans—were finally ready to return home after two months of dedicated rehabilitation. This event, a testament to the resilience of nature and human compassion, unfolded against the odds, illustrating a remarkable journey from rescue to release.\nThe Plight of the Kemp’s Ridley\nThe Kemp’s ridley sea turtle, the world's most endangered species of sea turtle, faces a gauntlet of threats, from habitat loss to entanglement in fishing gear. Yet, it is the cold-stun phenomenon that poses an immediate and stark danger, particularly in the northern waters of the Atlantic. Cold-stunning occurs when sea turtles are exposed to frigid water temperatures, causing their bodies to shut down and leaving them vulnerable to predation and boat strikes. It was this dire predicament that led to the rescue of 16 Kemp’s ridleys, found helplessly adrift and in urgent need of care.\nA Collaborative Effort to Heal\nThe journey of these sea turtles from peril to safety was spearheaded by the Clearwater Marine Aquarium in partnership with the New England Aquarium in Massachusetts. The collaboration underscored the importance of cooperation across state lines in the conservation of marine life. Dr. Shelly Marquardt, leading the medical team at Clearwater, emphasized the critical condition in which the turtles arrived and the intensive care required to nurse them back to health. \"All 11 turtles were fully recovered and ready to go back home,\" Dr. Marquardt remarked, highlighting the success of the rehabilitation efforts. This initiative was part of a larger conservation mission that saw a total of 52 sea turtles receiving treatment over the past winter, underscoring the scale of the challenge and the commitment of those dedicated to addressing it.\nHope on the Horizon\nThe release of these 11 Kemp’s ridley sea turtles marks a moment of hope and a significant achievement in the ongoing battle for their survival. As they disappeared beneath the waves, each turtle carried with it the efforts, hopes, and collective will of a network of conservationists committed to the preservation of marine life. Moreover, this event serves as a poignant reminder of the delicate balance within our natural world and the responsibility we share in its stewardship. The collaboration between the Clearwater and New England aquariums not only facilitated the return of these turtles to their natural habitat but also strengthened the bonds between institutions, fostering a united front in the conservation effort.\nIn the grand tapestry of conservation, every life saved is a victory, a step toward sustainability, and a beacon of hope for future generations. The successful rehabilitation and release of these 11 Kemp’s ridley sea turtles not only underscore the resilience of nature but also highlight the profound impact of human empathy and collaboration. As these turtles navigate the vast, open ocean, they symbolize the possibility of renewal and the enduring promise of conservation efforts worldwide. It is through such acts of care and dedication that we chart a course toward a more harmonious coexistence with the natural world, ensuring its wonders endure for generations to come.",

    "text": "A 52-year-old woman accused of transporting arms meant to be used for taking revenge for the 2002 post-Godhra riots has been arrested by the Gujarat Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS) after 18 years from Ahmedabad.\nBased on a tip-off, the ATS arrested Anjum Qureshi alias Anjum Kanpuri from a house in Vatva on January 23, a statement issued by the agency said.\nAnjum, who was booked under the Arms Act in 2005, has been remanded in police custody for three days, it added. Her husband Feroze Kanpuri, also an accused in the case, had died in 2009.\nAccording to the statement, the couple, along with others, collected Rs 50,000 to purchase weapons and cartridges to “take revenge after the communal riots in\nAhmedabad”. “To avenge the 2002 post-Godhra riots, three men from the city, Waris Pathan, Naseem Pathan and Nadir Khan Pathan, decided to buy arms and ammunition by collecting funds. They collected Rs 50,000 from people in 2005 and gave it to one Ghulam Rabbani Shaikh to buy guns and cartridges from Uttar Pradesh,” it added.\nAll four persons were arrested in 2005 and 10 countrymade guns as well as an equal number of cartridges were seized from them, the statement said. They are currently facing trial, the ATS said.\n“Their interrogation revealed that Feroze Kanpuri and his wife Anjum Kanpuri were also involved in the crime. As directed by Ghulam, they had gone to Dahod in their vehicle and collected some of the arms and delivered them to Waris in Ahmedabad,” the statement said.\nDeputy Superintendent of Police (ATS) S L Chaudhary told\nThe Indian Express, “They were feeling insecure and thus bought the weapons.”\nWITH PTI INPUTS\nFive days after Chandigarh IAS officer Rupesh Kumar ordered the sealing of establishments and suspension of liquor licenses of ten major vend owners, the Home department shunted him out of the Excise department. Sources said that on January 19, of the twelve cases decided, sealing was ordered in ten cases by Kumar for violating the breach of terms and conditions of the Liquor Act.",

    "text": "Carrie Underwood Rocked Guns N' Roses North American Tour was a top 23 story of Aug 2023: (fcc) 8-time GRAMMY Award winner Carrie Underwood rocked the stage for the first of three stadium dates she is joining on the North American leg of Guns N' Roses World Tour 2023 at Croix-Bleue Medavie Stadium in Moncton, NB on Saturday night. Underwood's eclectic set, backed by her stellar 8-piece band, included unique mash-ups and covers by some of Underwood's longtime rock inspirations such as Joan Jett, Pat Benatar, and Heart, while also covering other crowd-pleasing favorites by Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, and MotÃ¶rhead. The enthusiastic crowd also sang along to Underwood's smash hits, as well as newer tracks from her most recent album, Denim & Rhinestones. During Guns N' Roses headlining set, Underwood joined the iconic rock legends for their classic hit \"Sweet Child O' Mine,\" and was invited back again to the stage for the night's final number, the anthemic \"Paradise City.\" Underwood appears with Guns N' Roses again at the Parc Jean-Drapeau in Montreal, QE on August 8, and at GEODIS Park in Nashville, TN on August 26. Underwood made worldwide headlines last year when she welcomed Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose as a surprise special guest during her headlining performance at the Stagecoach Festival in April 2022. She joined the band onstage that summer for two songs during each of their July 1 and 2 shows at the UK's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and Rose made another surprise appearance during the L.A. Crypto.com Arena stop on Underwood's Denim & Rhinestones Tour, earlier this year. After completing her 43-city The Denim & Rhinestones Tour in March, Underwood resumed her ongoing REFLECTION: The Las Vegas Residency at Resorts World Las Vegas, which continues in September. She will star in her 11th consecutive show open for NBC's Sunday Night Football this Fall, and recently launched her exclusive year-round channel, CARRIE'S COUNTRY, on SiriusXM. A deluxe edition of her Denim & Rhinestones album, featuring six new tracks, will be out September 22. Check out video [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CvpWGY1gWwz/).
