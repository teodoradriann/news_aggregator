Santa Fe is fifth with 13 cards.\nSealed agreement Farías, who previously managed Águilas Doradas and América de Cali in the Colombian Primera División, will be linked to Junior until December 31, 2025.\nThe information about the contract was provided by Fuad Char, the majority shareholder of El Tiburón, who stated that the new helmsman’s mission will be to win titles in different events to fulfill the wishes of the fans.\n“We’re looking for the championship and to have every chance of being in the Copa Libertadores again,” Char explained to Futbolete.com. “We depend on the public, who guide us and who set the path, who buy the tickets, the season tickets, and we have to meet their demands.”\n“You have to look for a coach with a track record to get good results and Farías is one of them. We hope he has a great cycle in this institution,” added Char, who hopes that the native can emulate what he did with The Strongest (Apertura 2016) and Aucas (Serie A 2022), teams with which he was consecrated in the paid competitions of Bolivia and Ecuador, respectively.\nValencia / Joseph Ñambre\n#César #Farías #coach #Junior #Colombian #league\n2024-09-05 16:51:11",

    "title": "Memory self-test via smartphone shows promise in early detection of Alzheimer’s disease",
    "text": "Have you ever wondered if the minor forgetfulness you experience is a normal part of aging, or perhaps an early sign of something more serious, like Alzheimer’s disease? A new study published in [npj Digital Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-00999-9) offers hope for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease through memory self-tests conducted on smartphones. Researchers have developed a dedicated app that can accurately identify mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to Alzheimer’s. This research, a collaborative effort by scientists from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the Magdeburg-based company neotiv, presents a promising step forward in the use of digital tools for the advancement of Alzheimer’s research, clinical trials, and routine medical care. Memory issues are among the earliest signs of Alzheimer’s disease, significantly impacting diagnosis and research. Traditionally, memory assessment has been a hands-on process, requiring direct interaction with healthcare professionals and often involving complex tasks that are difficult to administer outside of a clinical setting. This approach, while thorough, has limitations, particularly in terms of accessibility and the ability to conduct frequent assessments over time. Recognizing these challenges, the study sought to explore the efficacy of unsupervised, remote memory testing using a specially designed smartphone app. The goal was to make early detection more accessible and to facilitate closer monitoring of memory impairment progression. Participants were drawn from two large observational studies on Alzheimer’s disease, encompassing a total of 199 individuals aged 60 and over from both Germany and the United States. This diverse group included people with a range of cognitive health statuses: those without cognitive impairments, individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and participants with subjective memory concerns yet no measurable cognitive deficits according to conventional tests. Over a period of at least six weeks, these volunteers engaged with the neotiv app, performing various memory tasks designed to mimic the assessments usually conducted in clinical settings but in a more user-friendly and accessible manner. These tasks focused on key aspects of memory and cognitive function, such as the ability to recognize changes in images and recall the placement of objects—activities closely aligned with the cognitive challenges experienced by individuals with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease. “Assessments with the neotiv app are interactive and comprise three types of memory tasks. These address different areas of the brain that can be affected by Alzheimer’s disease in different disease stages. Many years of research have gone into this,” said study author Emrah Düzel, a senior neuroscientist at DZNE’s Magdeburg site and chief medical officer of neotiv. The study recorded the participants’ performance across these tasks, analyzing the data to determine the app’s efficacy in detecting signs of mild cognitive impairment when compared to standard clinical evaluations. The findings were promising: the app-based assessments were found to be highly accurate in identifying mild cognitive impairment, demonstrating a comparable level of efficacy to traditional, supervised neuropsychological tests. This high degree of accuracy underscores the potential of using mobile technology for early detection and monitoring of Alzheimer’s disease. David Berron, research group leader at DZNE and also co-founder of neotiv explains: “As part of the validation process, we applied these novel remote and unsupervised assessments as well as an established in-clinic neuropsychological test battery. We found that the novel method is comparable to in-clinic assessments and detects mild cognitive impairment, also known as MCI, with high accuracy. This technology has enormous potential to provide clinicians with information that they cannot obtain during a patient visit to the clinic.” Furthermore, the study highlighted the advantages of remote and unsupervised cognitive testing, notably its accessibility and convenience for participants. This approach not only facilitates more frequent monitoring of cognitive health but also potentially extends the reach of diagnostic tools to underserved regions or individuals unable to regularly visit medical facilities. “Our study shows that memory complaints can be meaningfully assessed using this digital, remote and unsupervised approach,” said Düzel. “If the results from the digital assessment indicate that there is memory impairment typical of MCI, this paves the way for further clinical examinations. If test results indicate that memory is within the age-specific normal range, individuals can be given an all-clear signal for the time being. And for Alzheimer’s disease research, this approach provides a digital cognitive assessment tool that can be used in clinical studies – as is already being done in Germany, the USA, Sweden and other countries.” While the study’s outcomes are promising, the researchers acknowledge several limitations, including the modest sample size and the need for cross-validation in larger, more diverse populations. Additionally, the study’s design did not allow for a detailed exploration of the relationship between specific Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers and the diagnostic accuracy of the app-based tests. Future research aims to address these gaps by expanding the study to larger groups and exploring the utility of smartphone-based memory tests in tracking Alzheimer’s progression over longer periods. The researchers are also interested in integrating clinical data with app-based assessments to enhance the accuracy and relevance of remote memory testing.

    "text": "El Fideicomiso para Ciencia, Tecnología e Investigación de Puerto Rico anunció este 11 de marzo del año en curso, el lanzamiento de ‘Rhodiem Water Filtration’, un innovador proyecto de investigación que purifica agua en entornos espaciales, desarrollado en la isla para la Estación Espacial Internacional (ISS, por sus siglas en inglés). El proyecto es liderado por David Suleiman, catedrático del Departamento de Ingeniería Química de la Universidad de Puerto Rico, en Mayagüez (UPRM), y será transportado como parte de la misión NASA SpaceX Crew-10, programada para despegar este miércoles a las 17:49 tiempo de México.Esta investigación busca transformar la purificación de agua en el espacio, abordando desafíos críticos como el consumo energético y la reutilización eficiente de los recursos hídricos.\n“Puede ayudar a mejorar nuestro conocimiento de los mecanismos de transporte, lo cual puede tener repercusiones en diversas aplicaciones de beneficio para nuestra sociedad”, aseveró Suleiman,lider del proyecto. En este sentido, la Estación Espacial Internacional enfrenta constantes desafíos en la purificación y reutilización del agua debido a los costos de reabastecimiento, las limitaciones energéticas y los requerimientos de mantenimiento. ‘Rhodiem Water Filtration’ introduce una tecnología avanzada basada en una membrana nanocompuesta de polímero (PNM), diseñada para capturar iones esenciales (Na+ y K+), inactivar microorganismos y separar la urea del agua.\nEste sistema en tres etapas (módulos) optimiza la eficiencia del proceso de purificación y representa un avance clave no solo para garantizar la autosuficiencia de futuras misiones espaciales a la Luna y Marte, sino que también tiene el potencial de mejorar el tratamiento de agua en la Tierra. “Las membranas nanoestructuradas poliméricas permiten desarrollar sistemas de separación sofisticados usando conocimientos sobre Química e Ingeniería”, añadió el investigador. Esta tecnología, que se ha estudiado y mejorado a lo largo de años, ha contado con financiamiento inicial de la NASA. Este logro marca un avance significativo en la promoción de la ciencia y la innovación en la isla, abriendo nuevas oportunidades para la investigación científica en entornos espaciales. Este es el segundo proyecto espacial financiado por el Fideicomiso para Ciencia, Tecnología e Investigación de Puerto Rico y Rhodium Scientific, demostrando el compromiso de la isla con la innovación y el desarrollo científico de vanguardia.
