    "title": "'Facilitating terrorism': Crypto exchange Binance sued by Hamas hostages, Oct. 7 victims' families",
    "text": "An American woman freed after being held\n[hostage](/tag/hostage/) in Gaza and the families of two men killed in the Oct. 7 attack in Israel sued Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, which they accused of providing a funding mechanism for Hamas.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Manhattan federal court Thursday, also named Iran and Syria and is the first of what could be a torrent of lawsuits over the Hamas attack against Israel that left at least 1,200 Israelis dead, according to Israeli officials.\nAmong the plaintiffs are members of the Raanan family. Judith Raanan and her daughter, Natalie, were kidnapped and held in Gaza before they were freed in a prisoner exchange in October. Other plaintiffs include the family and estate of Itay Glisko, the 20-year-old New Jersey native and IDF sergeant killed in action during the attack by Hamas.\nMORE |\n[Family of American hostages freed by Hamas speak out: 'It is not the end'](/judith-raanan-natalie-israel-hamas/13958264/)\nThe lawsuit accused Binance of processing numerous transactions for Hamas between 2017 and 2023, \"providing a clandestine financing tool that Binance deliberately hid from U.S. regulators.\"\nBinance did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.\nThe company and its former CEO Chengpeng Zhao pled guilty last year to violations of U.S. anti-money laundering laws while agreeing to pay more than $4 billion in fines.\nThe violations included processing and failing to report \"transactions with cryptocurrency wallets that Binance senior executives had knowledge were linked to terrorist groups such as Hamas or Palestine Islamic Jihad,\" according to a Department of Justice filing.\nMORE |\n[24 hostages released from Gaza, 39 Palestinian prisoners swapped after temporary ceasefire deal](/what-time-will-the-hostages-be-released-ceasefire-israel-hamas/14099356/)\nZhao agreed to resign as part of his plea deal and will be sentenced in February where he faces up to 18 months in prison. The company also agreed to enter in a number of anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programs and retain an independent monitor for the next three years.\n\"For years, Binance remained willfully blind to the use of its platform by illicit actors, including terrorists, by failing to do any due diligence on the vast majority of its users prior to August 2021,\" the lawsuit said.\nThe lawsuit added, \"Incredibly, Binance went out of its way to protect users associated with Hamas and other terrorist groups from regulatory scrutiny, especially if they were 'VIP users who generated huge profits for Binance.\"\nMORE |\n[Families of hostages held in Gaza storm Israel's parliament meeting demanding deal for release](/israel-hostages-parliament-hamas/14349885/)\nThe lawsuit, modeled on suits that emerged after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, accused Binance of aiding terror organizations, providing material support to terrorists and sought unspecified damages.\n\"This needs to be done. These crypto funds are turning a blind eye to all of this illegal activity and now it's actually facilitating terrorism,\" said plaintiff's attorney Rob Seiden. \"We're doing this to send a message to these crypto institutions: you can't do this stuff. You have to be more vigilant.\"\nMore than 100 hostages are thought to still be detained in Gaza, according to Israeli officials. Israel's military response to the Oct. 7 attack has killed at least 27,019 people in the Gaza Strip, according to Gaza's Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health.",

    "text": "Seattle: Thousands of Boeing factory workers in the United States walked off the job Friday after voting overwhelmingly to reject a contract with the embattled aviation giant, its first strike in 16 years.\nUnion leaders called for the strike to start just after midnight on Friday (0700 GMT), hours after hourly workers in the Seattle region in the Pacific Northwest spurned the tentative contract with a vote of 94.6 percent and to strike with 96 percent.\nA strike will shutter two major plane assembly plants for the 737 MAX and 777 in the Puget Sound region and sidelines some 33,000 workers, further delaying the financially stressed company's turnaround efforts.\nread more Boeing steps up 737 deliveries to China in respite for new CEO NASA admits tension with Boeing over space rescue plan Boeing reaches deal with union after marathon weekend talks Boeing's beleaguered Starliner back home empty \"Our members spoke loud and clear tonight,\" said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751, after the vote.\n\"We strike at midnight.\"\nPicketers were out in front of the Renton plant - where Boeing's flagship 737 Max aircraft is produced - in the early hours of Friday, holding signs reading \"On strike against Boeing\", according to Bloomberg.\nThursday's vote was a decisive rejection of a deal that line workers said was far less generous than depicted by Boeing executives, marking the latest show of defiance by unions following earlier strikes in the auto, entertainment and other industries.\nBoeing said it was \"ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.\"\nLed by new CEO Kelly Ortberg, Boeing had hoped a 25 percent wage hike over four years and a commitment to invest in the Puget Sound region would be enough.\nOrtberg argued in a message to staff that the general wage hike marked the largest in history, and that a strike \"would put our shared recovery in jeopardy\".\nBut rank-and-file workers reacted with fury to the agreement, which was initially backed by IAM leadership.\n'Hollow' commitments Workers had sought a 40 percent wage hike and critics have said the 25 percent figure is inflated because the new deal also eliminates an annual company bonus.\nOther points of contention include the deal's failure to restore a pension, as well as Boeing's pledge to build its next plane in the Seattle region, which critics said offers no promises beyond the four-year contract.\n\"They're talking about a 25 percent increase and it's not,\" said Paul Janousek, an electrician in Everett who voted to strike.\nJanousek, 55, who has worked at Boeing for 13 years, figures his raise is only about nine percent after Boeing dropped the annual bonus.\nSome workers also expressed anger about Dennis Muilenburg and Dave Calhoun, two former CEOs who received multi-million dollar compensation even as the company faced turmoil upon their departure.\n\"Striking isn't ideal, but it's for the best for your long-term well-being,\" said Joe Philbin, a structural mechanic who has been at Boeing for six months.\nPhilbin said he will work side jobs if a strike drags out, but that he and his wife have been holding off on having kids until the situation stabilizes.\n\"(Boeing) is a huge company, they can survive paying the people who do the work a little more,\" he said.\nBig impact from strike? The IAM's most recent stoppage, in 2008, lasted 57 days.\nAccording to analysts at TD Cowen, a 50-day strike would deprive Boeing of $3-3.5 billion in cash flow and would have a $5.5 billion impact on revenue.\nThe company's stock was down four percent in pre-market trading on Friday.\nRichard Aboulafia, managing director of the AeroDynamic Advisory consultancy, said a lengthy strike would damage Boeing's turnaround prospects, but noted that a 2023 strike at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems lasted less than two weeks.\nBoeing has been under renewed scrutiny since a January incident in which a fuselage panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX plane mid-flight, necessitating an emergency landing.\nHolden said he looked forward to getting back to the bargaining table.\nThursday's vote \"sends a strong message that our members deserve better,\" he said.",

    "text": "Popular stand-up comic Abijit Ganguly has shared a lengthy thread on his official X page, narrating how a group of rich, entitled and badly behaved\" drunk women ruined his show in Pune last week. Comedian Abijit Ganguly on Wednesday said these women, who referred to themselves as 'GP Divas', a term that perhaps came from their society's name. Abijit Ganguly said this \"big group of aunties\" got drunk hours ahead of his show and started talking loudly in the middle of his set and even heckled the comic, spoiling the experience for him, other audience members, and the management of the venue. The entitlement of urban upper class never ceases to amuse me. Last Saturday had a show at a pub in Pune where there was a group of middle aged women who kept referring to themselves as GP Divas, I'm assuming GP to be their society's name. The comedian said he tried every trick in the book to reason with them and make them quit their alleged misbehaviour, but nothing worked. Eventually, he asked 'GP Divas' to leave the show, which ended up in a lot of drama and insults between Abijit Ganguly and the women who later demanded an apology from him. According to Abijit Ganguly, he apologised to the women so that all of them could move on with their lives, but the group was not satisfied with his apology and waited for him to finish the show and get a \"genuine\" one. \"Inside while waiting and during photos with the rest of audience who kept commending me on how I handled the situation, I kept thinking to myself that having performed all my life in different parts of the country, I had thought if ever I'd expected to wait hiding inside it'd be to some Gurgaon Jaats. \"Never in my life did I think it'd be to some Pune aunties calling themselves divas. Anyway, after fifteen minutes of waiting as the divas felt embarrassed waiting outside as every audience member passed them by giving them the eye, their resolute intent came down and they left,\" he wrote in his X thread. The comedian concluded his post, saying it was sad to see how \"the rich, entitled and badly behaved seem to have gulped down another city\" like Pune. \"Pune used to be one of my favourite cities to perform in, with a super intelligent audience and fun as well as sporty. I would read the recent splurge of articles of behaviour of Pune rich and wonder if this doesn't seem to be fitting with my image of Pune. But it sadly seems things seem to be changing.\" Last week, comedian Abijit Ganguly's Pune stand-up was rudely interrupted by a group of drunk women who disturbed the show by talking loudly and heckling the comic. Abijit Ganguly claimed he tried to make things good with the women but to no avail. He then asked them to leave the show, which hurt their sentiments, insults were traded, and led them to demand an apology from him. Finally, the show ended with the support of the audience but Abijit Ganguly was left surprised to see a city like Pune with \"super intelligent\" audience also falling prey to urban entitlement.

    "text": "[Ratoncolorao](/user/Ratoncolorao)a [elpais.com](/go/link/3903758)\nYa van unos 44 personas en España con prisión permanente revisable en unos 8 años desde que se aprobó. Se reparte entre un 75% hombre y 25% mujeres. Los condenados este años, una mujer (la que mató a su marido con parálisis) y un hombre que es el de este meneo\nRelacionada:\nEl TS confirma prisión permanente revisable para la mujer que mató a su marido con parálisis y lo enterró en Godelleta [#3](c3#c-3) Estoy de acuerdo con [#5](c5#c-5), sin embargo si tengo que decir que cualqueir ley tiene ese tipo de efectos adversos. Si pides unos requisitos especiales para una condena excepcional, pues resulta que más casos intentan ser encajados en esa definición.\n- Si haces una ley de ayudas al alquiler en jóvenes de 700€, pues es muy probable que los alquileres que sean más bajos suban hasta esa cifra.\n- Si mañana determinas que cualquier examen universitario se aprueba con un 6/10 de nota, pues aumentarán los examenes en los que justo hay gente que se queda con esa nota. De hecho muchos profesores evitan poner notas entre 4-5 para evitar pesados en las revisiones, o directamente muchas notas de 4,5 a 4,9 mágicamente se convierten en 5.\n- Así como siempre se especula que si bajas el IVA de un producto, con el tiempo, el vendedor mantiene el precio y simplemente aumenta su margen de beneficio.\n- No recuerdo si era en alemania, que se eliminaron las ayudas a la compra de vehículos y mágicamente bajaron los precios de los coches...\n[#4](c4#c-4) Tu mismo lo comentas: hablan de \"parricida\", que ya significa asesino en una de sus formas más graves y repugnantes posible. Volver a llamarle \"asesino\" sería redundante.\nEn cuanto a la violencia vicaria hacen muy bien en mencionarlo porque eso no equivale a llamarle asesino, ni parricida, sino que explica cual ha sido el motivo de esta locura: ha matado al niño para causar el mayor dolor posible a la madre, según el propio criminal. Por una vez tenemos un titular excelente: conciso, explicativo y nada clickbait.\n[#7](c7#c-7) El uso de violencia vicaria esta bien usado, pero por otro lado es curioso que solo se use en el caso de los hombres.\nPersonalmente esta gente (me da igual hombre o mujer) cárcel y tirar la llave.\nY que trabajen para pagarse su estancia en la cárcel, hay muchas carreteras para asfaltar. Sino quieren trabajar a pan y agua literalmente.\nY no digo de tirarlos en una isla y que se busquen la vida porque igual dan salido.\n[#10](c10#c-10) Go to [#7](c7#c-7) anda.\nEl asesinato premeditado es de por si uno de los delitos mas grave, pero por si solo en ciertas circunstancias puede tener una motivación que puede llegar hasta a justificarlo. (Imaginemos una hijo o pareja maltratado que asesina a su maltratador). Así que la motivación SI hace que el asesinato premeditado sea moralmente (y penalmente) más o menos reprobable.\nMatar a alguien solo por el hecho de hacer daño a un tercero para quien la víctima lo es todo es quizás la motivación más reprobable de un asesinato premeditado.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Es simplemente por un tema ideológico o sensacionalista, vende más, así como que cuando alguien le abre la cabeza a otro con un hacha, es lo primero que te ponen en el titular, es lo que vende...\n[#7](c7#c-7) Solo diré algo:\n- Alienación parental: Es un término sin base científica, hecho a medida por los hombres para atacar a las mujeres.\n- Violencia vicaria: 👌\n[#4](c4#c-4) y tanto que suena raro. Es como que metan un termino usado por 4 filósofos extravagantes que nadie más conoce.\nLa ventaja, en este caso, es que esos 4 \"filosofos\" extravagantes tienen mucho presupuesto para enseñarle a la gente esos términos inventados para que la gente los asimile. Luego usarlos no, porque da vergüenza usarlo uno mismo, pero entenderlo sí. Y, además, como va ya con carga ideológica pues te lleva a la idea en cuestión como un acceso directo o como un atajo de teclado.\nQue es un asesinato? Si, pero no solo eso, es violencia vicaría, y este concepto te lleva directamente al machismo (no a la locura de este despojo), y de ahi al machismo estructural que oprime a las mujeres.\nEl retorcimiento del titular es de categoría. Padre asesina brutalmente a su hija sería mas claro. El titular no es conciso para todo el mundo, pero es muy conciso para quien ya lleva las gafas.\n[#13](c13#c-13) vaya, un indecente cobarde. Luego si eso te explico por qué.\nYo te respondo copiandome a mi mismo, por si he acertado antes de que aparecieras: \"El titular no es conciso para todo el mundo, pero es muy conciso para quien ya lleva las gafas.\"\n[#13](c13#c-13) [#17](c17#c-17) Mentira. Legalmente, la violencia vicaría es una forma de violencia de genero en la que el hombre usa a los hijos para dañar a la mujer.\nNo existe, la violencia vicaría de una mujer hacia un hombre. Sino tirad de Google e investigad antes de hacer comentarios infundados.\nDe hecho, en la ley de violencia de género 1/2004 según recuerdo de memoria está tipificada como forma de violencia de genero, y lo recalca de nuevo forma de violencia de un hombre hacia una mujer, usando a los hijos.\nY\nhttps://www.ucm.es/otri/noticias-violencia-vicaria-ucm\n[#13](c13#c-13) Va a ser que no, ha sido definida con mucho cuidado para aplicarla en exclusiva cuando la víctima es la mujer\nhttps://www.publico.es/mujer/no-violencia-vicaria.html\nsi es en el caso contrario no tiene nombre, porque ya sabes, lo que no se nombra no existe.\nEs una locura inclasificable el nivel de odio y sadismo de este ser.\nCualquier cosa o castigo o aun tortura que se le haga en vida va a ser menos que el daño que ha hecho a la madre y familiares del niño.\nAhora bien lo de la violencia vicaria me da un asco tremendo. También hay casos de mujeres que asesinan a sus hijos para dañar al padre. El machismo existe pero no es la única violencia que se ejerce contra hijos comunes.\n[#17](c17#c-17) los cojones.\nMírate la definicion en wikipedia. En los medios. Hasta en los organismos oficiales. Se considera una forma de violencia contra la mujer.\nAsí que no vengamos ahora a dar un baño de igualdad a lo que no es. Me he quejado y con razón del mal uso que se hace del término y de que una parte de esa violencia no se visibiliza por cuestiones políticas. Puta vergüenza habiendo niños asesinados de por medio.\n[#18](c18#c-18) En la wikipedia, bajo el epígrafe Definición:\n“La violencia vicaria se ha definido como un tipo de violencia ejercida por un progenitor maltratador como instrumento para causar daño al otro utilizando a sus hijos e incluso a los descendientes en común, que puede llegar, en casos extremos, a terminar con la vida de estos.“\nLa violencia vicaria sería una forma de violencia de género. También lo es el asesinato o una paliza. Pero eso no significa que la definición de un asesinato o una paliza sea siempre de hombre a mujer.",

    "text": "“And while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously” (1 Peter 2:23).\nJesus Christ, as the sinless sufferer, is the only model we need as we endure life’s trials.\nPrior to his death in 1555, the English Reformer and martyr Hugh Latimer expressed his convictions this way: “Die once we must; how and where, we know not. . . . Here is not our home; let us therefore accordingly consider things, having always before our eyes that heavenly Jerusalem, and the way thereto in persecution.” Latimer knew much about how to face suffering, but he knew that Jesus Himself was the final model regarding how to deal with suffering and death.\nThat model is summarized in today’s verse, which is a quote from the Suffering Servant passage in Isaiah 53. All the horrible physical and verbal abuse Christ endured just prior to the cross, along with the evil tearing down of His perfectly virtuous character, was unjustified, and yet He did not strike back. As the Son of God, Jesus had perfect control of His feelings and powers.\nJesus found the strength to endure such an abusive final trial when He “kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously.” Literally, Jesus kept handing Himself and all His circumstances, climaxing with His death on Calvary (Luke 23:46), over to the Father. The Son had complete trust in God, the just and fair Judge of the entire earth (see Gen. 18:25).\nWe can follow His example and endure persecution and unjust suffering without answering back, whether it be in the workplace, among relatives, or in any social setting. The key is simply entrusting our lives, by faith, to a righteous God who will make everything right and bring us safely into His glory (1 Peter 5:6-10).\nStephen and Paul are notable role models for how we can triumph over life’s persecutions and hardships, even death. But those great men were themselves merely “fixing [their] eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith” (Heb. 12:2). We must do the same.\nSuggestions for Prayer\nAs you daily experience life’s normal difficulties and challenges, ask God to help you better remember the perfect example Jesus set in facing the worst of pain and suffering.\nFor Further Study\nRead Hebrews 1:1-2 and 4:14-16.\nCompare and contrast what these passages tell us about Christ’s deity and humanity.\nWhat do they reveal about the superiority of His example?\nFrom Strength for Today by John MacArthur Copyright © 1997.
