Conditions should steadily improve from west to east late Friday into Saturday.”\nForecasters say this strong, upper-level disturbance is unusual for this time of the year.\n“We are not looking at a widespread rain event. Rather, we are looking at a scattered heavy shower event with isolated strong to possibly severe thunderstorms,” the weather service said Thursday afternoon. “Due to the scattered nature of the event, sudden changes of the weather should be expected. It could be sunny and fair weather one hour and you could be under a severe thunderstorm the next hour.”\nWindward and mauka areas are favored for rainfall, especially along Oahu’s Koolaus.\nIn the special weather statement, forecasters said the public should be prepared to take action should flash flood warnings be issued, particularly for those in flood-prone areas.\nThe weather service also reminds the public that flash flooding also can occur in locations where it is not raining and well downstream of heavy rains.\n“If you notice signs of heavy rain or thunderstorms upslope, move quickly away from flood-prone areas,” forecasters said.\nConditions are expected to stabilize over the weekend, but “conditions will likely be more wet than normal, especially during the afternoons.”\nMeanwhile, a high wind warning is in effect for Hawaii island summits through 6 a.m. Saturday. Weather officials say to expect southwest winds of 40 to 60 mph with localized gusts over 70 mph. A winter storm warning has been issued for the same summits from noon today through 6 a.m. Saturday. Heavy snow with accumulations of up to 6 inches is forecast, the weather service said.\n“Travel could be very difficult to impossible,” the weather service warning said. “Blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility at times, with periods of zero visibility.”\nA high surf advisory is also in place for the south-facing shores of all isles through 6 p.m. Friday due to a south swell. Forecasters said large, breaking waves of 7 to 10 feet are expected along south-facing shores through 6 p.m. today, and that strong currents will make swimming dangerous.",

The U.S. now uses white phosphorus in artillery shells to create smoke and conceal troop movements, as well as to illuminate the battlefield. The Pentagon's recommendation was to provide Ukraine with white phosphorus artillery shells to create light and smoke, not for use against enemy forces.\nAs Ukrinform reported, the U.S. and Ukraine presidents are scheduled to meet at the White House on Thursday.\nMENAFN26092024000193011044ID1108720554",

The couple have a 1-year-old daughter, Amiri.\nMalik Jr. arrived four weeks ahead of schedule, according to Advocate.\nThe boy’s mother realized Wednesday night she was going into the labor and the couple rushed to the hospital, where she was in labor for three hours, according to Katie Dahlstrom, an Advocate spokeswoman.\n“She never expected to have a Leap Day baby,” she said.\nAnother newborn, Alfred “AJ” James Poellnitz IV, was also a month early, delivered at Advocate Christ at 8:10 a.m. and weighing 6 pounds 11 ounces and measuring 19 inches. Alfred “AJ” James Poellnitz IV was born on Leap Day, Feb. 29, 2024, to Alfred James Poellnitz III and Kristyn Rein, of Alsip, at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn.

    "text": "López Obrador promete ayuda a Jorge Glas tras una carta del exvicepresidente de Ecuador El presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, prometió este jueves protección al exvicepresidente de Ecuador (2013-2017) Jorge Glas, quien está preso en aquel país y envió una carta para pedir ayuda al mandatario mexicano, al colombiano, Gustavo Petro, y al brasileño, Lula Da Silva. “La Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores (SRE) va a establecer comunicación con la Cancillería en Brasil, en Bolivia, con otros países para cuidar la salud de Glas y resolver su protección, su derecho de asilo”, expuso el mandatario durante su rueda de prensa matutina. López Obrador respondió a una carta que le leyó una periodista escrita a mano por Glas, detenido el 5 de abril tras el allanamiento de la Embajada de México en Quito. En la misiva, que está fechada el 15 de abril y que el gobernante mexicano dijo no haber recibido aún, el exvicepresidente asegura que “está en la peor prisión de Ecuador” y que se encuentra en “huelga de hambre”. El exfuncionario, quien según la reportera mandó la carta a través del expresidente colombiano Ernesto Samper (1994-1998), agradeció también el asilo que la Embajada mexicana le otorgó y pidió ayuda, pues aseguró que en Ecuador “hay una persecución brutal contra todos los progresistas, la ayuda internacional puede hacer algo”, agregó. Al respecto, López Obrador comentó que, durante la reunión del pasado martes entre ministros de la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños (Celac), convocada de manera extraordinaria por la presidenta de Honduras, Xiomara Castro, se trató “ampliamente” el tema de Glas. “Ahí precisamente Lula retoma una propuesta del presidente de Bolivia, Luis Arce, para cuidar la salud de el exvicepresidente de Ecuador y se plantea el regreso al estado anterior a la toma de nuestra Embajada, es decir, que se le regrese a nuestra Embajada o se le dé el nuevo conducto para regresar o venir a México o a cualquier otro país”, explicó. El gobernante mexicano señaló que, a la par de esta petición, sigue firme que la Corte Internacional de Justicia (CIJ) resuelva la demanda que México hizo por los hechos en Ecuador. “Nosotros lo que queremos es que resuelva la Corte Internacional de Justicia, porque hubo una violación flagrante a nuestra soberanía y al derecho internacional”, insistió. En ese sentido, reafirmó que resolver la situación de Glas no detendrá su denuncia ante la CIJ. “Eso no va a detener nuestra denuncia. O sea, son cosas distintas. Nosotros ya acudimos al tribunal de justicia internacional y vamos a pedir que se sancione a las autoridades, al Gobierno de Ecuador”, zanjó. La polémica empezó tras el allanamiento de la Policía en la Embajada de México el 5 de abril para llevarse al exvicepresidente Glas, resguardado ahí desde diciembre ante un proceso de corrupción. Y ha crecido porque un tribunal de Ecuador declaró el viernes pasado la detención de Glas dentro de la sede diplomática como ilegal y arbitraria, aunque quedó encarcelado al tener pendiente de purgar la condena por el caso Sobornos y por asociación ilícita en el caso Odebrecht. efe",

    "text": "En Vivo\nKarla Tarazona no dudó en contar cómo \"rescató\" a Christian Domínguez tras finalizar su relación con Pamela Franco.\nKarla Tarazona y Christian Domínguez han generado una serie de comentarios tras darse a conocer que habrían retomado su relación amorosa, a pesar que hace algunos años atrás rompieron definitivamente por la presunta infidelidad del cantante con Isabel Acevedo cuando los 3 eran parte de El Gran Show.\nSin embargo, la Tarazona prefiere tomar todo este tema con humor y tras presentarse en el podcast de Lucho Micky junto a Domínguez y los integrantes de La Gran Orquesta Internacional, no dudó en contar cómo “rescató” al padre de uno de sus hijos.\n“Mira, te voy a contar. ¿Tú ves esto que tiene acá? Esto de acá eran tres limones con una pita (Estaba con moquillo) Jajajaja”, mencionó entre carcajadas.\nLa animadora agregó que lo está reciclando para poder tomar ‘venganza’ por lo que le hizo en el pasado: “(Ya estaba perdido ya) Ya estaba, pero, lo reciclé. Dije, lo antiguo puede servir. Lo antiguo puede servir. Solamente hay que darle una pulida una pulida y acá no nos cobramos todas las que hizo”.\nPamela Franco respondió para las cámaras sobre el romance entre el padre de su hija y Karla: “Lo que pasa que hay que ser francos en la vida y no hay que ser hipócritas. Si él es feliz, o sea si no ha sido feliz conmigo, si no me quiere a mí, si está feliz con ella, cada quien tiene que estar en su lugar y punto. Yo estoy feliz si mi hija está feliz, si su papá está tranquilo, está trabajando, y está con la mujer que quiere estar, que lo esté”.\nTodos los episodios de Más Espectáculos en tvGO. ¡Suscríbete Ahora!",
