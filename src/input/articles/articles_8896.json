According to the [report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7303a2.htm?s_cid=mm7303a2_w), up to 80% of eligible patients are not offered [Paxlovid](https://themessenger.com/health/paxlovid-viral-rebound-one-in-five), a COVID-19 antiviral manufactured by Pfizer and authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at the end of 2021. These results are reminiscent of prior estimates from the CDC indicating that Paxlovid use among the adult population has been less than 35% since the drug was approved. When Paxlovid first hit the market, experts were optimistic about the [antiviral’s potential](https://themessenger.com/health/flu-antiviral-shortage-treating-flu-at-home-tamiflu-flu-shot) to blunt the impact of COVID-19 in patients who are particularly vulnerable to the virus. President Joe Biden made it the center of his COVID response, launching the “test-to-treat” initiative and speaking its praises at the 2022 State of the Union address. When administered within five days of symptom onset, the antiviral is said to reduce the risk of hospitalization by as much as 51%, according to clinical trial results. Despite Paxlovid’s known benefits, “its utilization has been considerably lower than expected,” the CDC writes. The CDC’s report indicates that nearly half of providers involved in the study didn’t offer their [COVID patients](https://themessenger.com/search?s=covid) Paxlovid because they had only mild symptoms; 23% did not prescribe it because their patients were outside of the standard five day symptom window, while another 23% said their patients lacked symptoms. Around 6% were concerned about drug interactions.

    "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris visited\nSan Francisco on Sunday to hold a fundraising event at an elitist venue in one of its richest neighborhoods.\nHer event was at the Fairmont Hotel on Nob Hill.\nIf you visit that hotel’s website, you will see that its cheapest room on a weeknight this time of year is $264. However, it also offers a three-bedroom suite for $15,432 a night.\nGoing to the\nHarris fundraiser there, however, could have cost you far more than that.\nThe San Francisco Chronicle posted a story on Sunday with this headline: “700 at Kamala Harris’ S.F. fundraiser, with tickets up to $500,000.”\n“Kamala Harris held a San Francisco fundraiser Sunday where attendance cost as much as $500,000, according to an invitation obtained by the Chronicle,” the newspaper reported.\n“Donors needed to spend at least $3,300 to enter the fundraiser; tickets costing less than $250,000 were sold out as of Thursday morning,” it said.\n“The top ticket was $500,000,” said another story by the Chronicle.\nThe Nob Hill neighborhood where Harris held this fundraiser is sometimes called Snob Hill. A description of it posted on the website of a local tour company provides some sense of why this is the case.\n“One of the oldest and most illustrious of San Francisco’s neighborhoods sits on Nob Hill,” says Real San Francisco Tours. “It’s also one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the whole world, in terms of per capita income (and real estate value), which isn’t that surprising when you consider how expensive the Bay Area generally is in every way.”\nIn fact, as this column has noted before, the seven wealthiest counties in this country—when measured by median household income from 2018 through 2022—were all suburbs of San Francisco and Washington, D.C. San Francisco itself was the 11th wealthiest county—with a median household income of $136,689.\nSo, what did Harris tell these individuals who paid up to $500,000 to meet with her on Snob Hill?\n“Harris promised Sunday to ‘put middle-class families and working-class families first. … When the middle class is strong, our whole nation is strong,'” the Chronicle reported.\nSeven years before this Nob Hill fundraiser, Harris gave her first speech on\nthe Senate floor—and it was not about working-class and middle-class Americans. It was about then- President Donald Trump’s actions aimed at stemming illegal immigration.\n“By fiat, we have seen the president stick taxpayers with a bill for a multibillion-dollar border wall, without regard for the role of the U.S. Congress under Article 1 of the Constitution,” she said. “By fiat, we have seen a president mandate the detention of immigrants, both documented and undocumented, creating a dragnet that could ensnare 8 million people.\n“By fiat, the president has ordered the creation of what essentially will be a 15,000-member deportation force,” she said.\n“But the truth is,” she said, “the vast majority of the immigrants in this country are hardworking people who deserve a pathway to citizenship.”\nLegal immigrants, of course, already have a pathway to citizenship. It is only those who have come here illegally or who have overstayed their visas who do not.\nWhat is the impact of\nillegal immigration on the working-class families that Harris told the crowd on Nob Hill she would put first?\nOn April 26, 1979, United Farm Workers of America President Cesar Chavez testified in a hearing at the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee held in Salinas, California. Chavez argued that illegal alien workers hurt the efforts of legal workers to earn better wages.\n“For so many years we have been involved in agricultural strikes; organizing almost 30 years as a worker, as an organizer, and as president of the union—and for all these almost 30 years it is apparent that when the farm workers strike and their strike is successful, the employers go to Mexico and have unlimited, unrestricted use of illegal alien strikebreakers to break the strike,” Chavez told the committee.\n“Lawbreaking begets more lawbreaking, and when these illegal aliens come in to break a strike they have to be harbored; they have to be transported; and labor contractors have to be used to direct them and supervise them,” said Chavez.\n“What about other laws?” asked Chavez. “What about the contributions the employers have to make to Social Security and unemployment insurance? How are those contributions made? These men do not have Social Security numbers.”\nHow would Vice President Kamala Harris have answered Cesar Chavez?\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 CREATORS.COM\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

    "title": "Emeka Kalu: When Nibo Town Honoured Top Politician, Man Of The People  | Independent Newspaper Nigeria",
    "text": "LAGOS – The yuletide is a period of festivities all over the world and in Nigeria in particular. Thus, the Boxing Day, Tuesday, December 26, 2023, was a historic day for the people of Nibo, a town in Awka South, Anambra State in general and one of the nation’s top politicians, Chief Emeka Charles Kalu. That day the people came out in their numbers to honour, Chief Kalu, a People’s Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain and Coordinator of Peoples Democratic Party Coalition (PDPCO), who was installed the chieftaincy title of Okpata Ozuora 1 Na Nibo by Ezeike IV of Nibo. The title, Okpata Ozuora, means ‘One whose wealth extends to everyone’, and the people of Nibo through it, honoured Kalu, a philanthropist, who through his ECK Foundation, has been extending his kind gesture to humanity, including Nibo, from where he picked a wife. Chief Kalu, an electrical engineer and political juggernaut, who had once tried his hands on the governorship of Abia State, now eyes the Red Chamber of the National Assembly for the Abia North Senatorial District seat, now presently occupied by former Governor Orji Uzor Kalu of the All Progressives Congress (APC), after a stint by Senator Mao Ohuabunwa. Chief Kalu, it would be noted, had dedicated his life to improving the lives of his people of Abia North where he hailed from and those from other areas in numerous ways, including sponsorships, scholarships, charitable giving and people’s empowerment, regardless of their ethnicity, religion, or belief. He has also impacted on humanity through the Global Initiative for Good Governance (GIGG) of which he is the Convener. The chieftaincy installation was preceded on December 22, 2023, with the empowerment and support to over 100 widows and impoverished members of communities in some parts of South East, a gesture he resolved to make a yearly event, especially in the Abia North Senatorial Zone and Abia as a whole. During the chieftaincy installation event, Chief Kalu, president of the ECK Foundation and Convener, Global Initiative for Good Governance (GIGG), who was gaily dressed in full traditional Igbo regalia, was ushered into the Eze’s expansive palace by drummers, dancers and masquerades, easily giving the impression that the event was indeed a grand traditional outing for everyone. As Kalu stepped into the palace in grand style, he was accompanied by an assemblage of political and business associates from far and near who stormed the Nibo town to give him the needed support. As he knelt before the monarch and members of his Council of Chiefs and elders, the Ezeike IV of Nibo prayed for him, showering him with blessings, enjoining him to continue with his good deeds. The monarch stressed that Chief Kalu’s charitable deeds towards the Nibo people and humanity had not gone unnoticed; hence he was given the title to inspire him to carry on with his selfless service. In his response, Chief Kalu reiterated his resolve to live out his life’s greatest philosophy, which he stated, is to make everyone around him smile as long as the earth exists and he is able to breathe. The installation was followed by a grand reception where everyone was treated to assorted foods and drinks to everyone’s satisfaction as well as dancing. During the event,Chijioke, the High Life Music Maestro, treated the crowd to a fantastic music that kept people on their feet, wriggling their waists in different dance steps, Chief Kalu’s sons, who had returned from the United States of America, as well as delegations from far and near, including the powerful Senator Uche Ekwunife, graced the event. Masques, Ndi Ogbu Oja (traditional flutists), and cultural displays were present. Highlights of the occasion included his pledge to keep supporting and encouraging excellence among the communities’ youths and his monetary commitment of N2,000,000 to the Nibo Community for community development. Chijioke treated the audience to a scintillating Highlife as people danced and rejoiced with the celebrator. The event attracted favourable compliments and encouraging comments in formal and social media, in an effort to help to motivate Chief Kalu, as a humanitarian, to keep up his good work and to encourage others that it is good to render selfless service to compatriots, especially the less privileged. Chief Kalu in a chat with Sunday Independent informed that the people of Nibo are very close to him. He explained: “Anambra is my second home. My wife is from Anambra State and my mother is from Nibo, also in Anambra State.” Explaining how he had contributed to the development of the people and Nibo town, Chief Kalu said, “It is not me, but what God is using the ECK Foundation to do in the lives of people around the country.” According to him, apart from several things he had done as his humble contributions to the development of humanity, he had been making contributions to ensure better life for the people of South East in various ways, not minding the communities they came from. When asked what other prestigious titles he holds so far, Chief Kalu explained: “I hold the title of Onwa, Atakata Agbuo 1 na Igbo land, Nwannedinaba Nnewi, and so many others. Also, Chief Kalu informed that he is also not a pushover in the field of Electrical Engineering and holds a Doctorate in the field and proficiency in power generation. Unfolding his vision for the Abia North people come 2027, Chief Kalu said he sees it as his responsibility to give all he has to ensure that Abia North constituents are freed from what he termed the old Egyptian political backwardness and taken a distance into the land flowing with milk and honey. Kalu stated: “I cannot stand to watch our people suffer helplessly under the guise of political hypocrisy of those who see themselves as lords over seats of power in Abia State. “Aware of the fact that it takes a full time commitment to redeem Abia North from the shackles of poor legislative leadership, I decided to stand and fight for her freedom and transformation.” Kalu reminded Sunday Independent that he once wanted to contest the Abia State governorship, but had to step down that vision when he felt that the time was not yet ripe. He also informed that he has remained very active preparing himself for what he termed `the right moment’, recalling that in the 2019 general elections, he formed the Atikulated Agenda to promote the presidential agenda of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. He said he also used that political machine to campaign for and mobilise voters for Atiku, the then presidential candidate of PDP and also used the platform to support Atiku in the 2023 presidential election. Kalu said he is disturbed by the activities of the current lawmakers, adding, “To serve the people in the capacity of a Senator is beyond sitting in the hallowed Red Chamber of the National Assembly to listen to other lawmakers making inputs. “It has to do with working to initiate and sponsor bills of national importance that when succeeded by the rigorous processes of the House, will be assented to by Mr. President into law. “More so, legislative leadership is not all about waiting for the receipt of an exotic car from the Senate President to cruise and cheer with friends, but a job meant to be concentrated on to ensure Nigeria is taken back to its original shape in good governance. “To serve as a Senator does not only end in waiting for the month end for salary and allowance payments, but a function to be handled with keen attention to the priority of the constituents rather than that of oneself.” He stated that for decades, Abia North Senatorial District has been wallowing in regrettable lack of access to social amenities due to mismanaged opportunities of her elected mouthpiece in the upper chamber of the national parliament. He stressed: “It is time to let the people know that their sufferings have come to an end. In the United States of America, constituents hold their lawmakers responsible for certain actions in the Congress and this is actually the nitty-gritty of representative governance. We cannot afford to continue this way without positive changes on the lives of the youth and womenfolk. “A new Abia North is rapidly emerging and the people are being helped out of the rabbit holes they have been slipped into. Leadership devoid of empowering humanity is a scam of the highest order, while governance not anchored on delivering life changing services to the people remains a pit in darkness, shambles and vanity.” Chief Kalu, in conclusion, said the new title of Okpata Ozuora 1 Na Nibo he bagged from Nibo through the royalhands of Ezeike IV of Nibo had added a boost to his desire to continue to serve humanity and make life better for Nigerians.",

    "title": "A Community in Mourning: Remembering Lamisha Moody and a Stand Against Violence at Anglican Cathedral College",
    "text": "It was a day like any other at Anglican Cathedral College until the unfathomable news shattered the tranquility of our academic haven. Lamisha Moody, a 15-year-old beacon of light in our community, was tragically taken from us, a victim of a senseless act of gun violence that also claimed the life of Troy Hyde. In the aftermath, our school finds itself grappling with grief, seeking solace in unity, and rallying for change.\nA Bright Light Extinguished\nLamisha was not just a student; she was a friend, a confidante, and a source of inspiration for many. Her infectious laughter filled the corridors, her kindness touched the hearts of her peers and teachers alike. The news of her untimely departure has left a void in our community that words can hardly fill. Anglican Cathedral College prides itself on nurturing not just the intellect but the spirit of its students, making this loss profoundly personal and deeply felt across our campus.\nUniting in Grief and Action\nIn response to this tragedy, plans are underway for a memorial service to honor Lamisha's life and legacy. This service is not only a tribute to her but a testament to the resilience of our community in the face of adversity. We understand that healing is a journey that requires support, which is why counseling and spiritual guidance are being offered to all students. Our administration, echoing the collective voice of our community, has issued a poignant statement stressing the urgency for action against gun violence. This call to action underscores a commitment to not only grieve but also to advocate for a future where our students can thrive in safety.\nA Call to Cherish and Protect\nThe circumstances surrounding Lamisha's death are a grim reminder of the pervasive nature of violence that lurks in the shadows of society. Reports indicate that the attack was targeted at neighborhood figure Troy Hyde, with Lamisha tragically caught in the crossfire. This senseless violence has robbed our community of a precious life, a future unfulfilled. Our administration's message in the wake of this tragedy is clear: we must honor Lamisha by spreading love and cherishing one another. In her memory, we are called to stand against the forces of violence, advocating for peace and safety in our communities.\nWe find ourselves at a crossroads, mourning the loss of a young soul while confronted with the harsh realities of the world outside our school gates. Yet, in this moment of profound sorrow, there is a glimmer of hope. The legacy of Lamisha Moody and the collective stand of the Anglican Cathedral College community against violence serve as beacons guiding us towards a brighter, more secure future. As we come together to remember and honor Lamisha, we reaffirm our commitment to nurturing a culture of love, respect, and safety for all.",

    "text": "Crimen en la calle Amargura\nMervin Thomas, el joven que soñaba con ser piloto y murió asesinado por una mujer en Reus\nNacido en Bahrain y de nacionalidad india, fue asesinado en la calle Amargura, en el centro de la ciudad. Sus amigos le han rendido un emotivo homenaje en el lugar de los hechos\nEl asesinato de Mervin Thomas Mathew, un joven de 27 años originario de Bahrain y nacionalizado indio el pasado lunes a primera hora de la mañana, ha conmocionado a la ciudad de Reus esta semana.\nEl joven fue agredido por un arma blanca (todavía no se ha explicado de qué tipo) en la calle Amargura, cerca del céntrico párquing Simonet, donde sus amigos y conocidos han improvisado este miércoles un memorial con flores, velas y mensajes en su memoria.\nMervin había llegado a Reus hace siete años con un grupo de compañeros de una academia de aviación de Bahrain que tenía un convenio con la Escuela de Pilots CESDA. Su objetivo era claro: formarse como piloto comercial y regresar a Oriente Medio para trabajar en una aerolínea. En 2019, consiguió su licencia ATPL (Airline Transport Pilot Licence), aunque problemas burocráticos impidieron su regreso, y acabó estableciéndose en la ciudad catalana.\n“Convertirse en piloto era su sueño desde niño. No se rendía nunca. Lo que más deseaba era hacer feliz a su familia”, recuerda Gershon Gambhiran, amigo de la infancia con quien compartió piso en Reus. A pesar de no ejercer como piloto, Mervin mantenía viva la esperanza mientras trabajaba desde hacía siete meses en la hamburguesería Kalavia, donde era muy querido por sus compañeros.\nEl domingo por la noche, tras acabar su jornada laboral, salió con amigos a un local de ocio. A primera hora del lunes, alrededor de las seis de la mañana, fue víctima de una agresión mortal con arma blanca. La presunta autora, una mujer de 31 años, fue detenida y enviada a prisión provisional sin fianza por orden del Juzgado de Instrucción número 4 de Reus.\nEl homenaje organizado por el bar La Txaranga —donde Mervin era un habitual— reunió a más de un centenar de personas. “Pasamos un rato en silencio, luego hicimos un brindis por él. Siempre tenía una sonrisa. Espero que quien le hizo esto lo pague”, expresó una amiga. El local cerró sus puertas el lunes como muestra de duelo.\nEl impacto de su muerte ha cruzado fronteras. Sudheer Thirunilath, secretario de Khalid Hamad Al Khalifa, miembro de la familia real de Bahrain, pidió públicamente en la red social X la repatriación urgente del cuerpo de Mervin, que aún permanece en la morgue de Tarragona, según informó el medio GDN Online.\nConocido por su carácter alegre y generoso, quienes lo trataron lo recuerdan como alguien que “nunca causaba problemas y se llevaba bien con todo el mundo”. En palabras del responsable del bar La Txaranga, Alberto Beas, “era un trozo de pan”.\nSu familia, residente en Bahrain —su padre de Malasia y su madre de India—, no estaba en España. “Sus amigos eran su familia aquí”, explican desde el entorno más cercano. Entre los mensajes que han dejado en su honor, uno resume el sentir general: “Tenías un alma preciosa. Nos diste luz. Te estaremos agradecidos para siempre”.",
