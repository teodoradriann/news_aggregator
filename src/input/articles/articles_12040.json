    "text": "Best Overall\nProduct Specs\n- Type: Ready-to-use spray\n- Quantity: 16 ounces\n- Active ingredients: Peppermint oil, geraniol\nPros\n- An effective plant-based product made with U.S.-sourced peppermint\n- Long-lasting concentrated formula in easy-to-use spray bottle\n- Works as both an indoor and outdoor spider repellent when applied regularly\nCons\n- Although safe when dry, it should never be sprayed on or near dogs and cats\nMany people like the smell of peppermint, but spiders do not. This plant-based repellent spray from Mighty Mint is made up of 3 percent U.S.-sourced peppermint and 1 percent geraniol, the main component of citronella oil. It can be sprayed on plants, hard surfaces, and most fabrics (though we recommend testing a patch first).\nWhen using it as an indoor spider repellent, users will want to apply it once a week. It will also work outdoors in sheltered areas. Mighty Mint states that its spider repellent is safe when used as directed. Be cautious, though: Like some other insect repellents, peppermint oil can cause respiratory distress in some children and is toxic for many pets, so apply it judiciously.\nGet the Mighty Mint spider repellent at\nAmazon, Walmart, or Target.",

    "title": "Gayle King criticizes 'sexist' remarks about Blue Origin flight, highlights scientific contributions - The Mirror US",
    "text": "Gayle King has hit back at critics who dismissively referred to her recent Blue Origin flight as a \"space ride,\" labeling the term \"sexist.\"\nThe esteemed 70-year-old broadcaster was in good company with celebrities like Katy Perry, Jeff Bezos's fiancée Lauren Sanchez, ex-NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights advocate Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn for the brief but momentous 11-minute trip. The all-female crew triumphantly completed their journey to the Kármán line – the universally accepted edge of space - and returned from a secluded Texas ranch on Monday morning aboard Jeff Bezos's rocket.\nThey experienced three minutes of weightlessness before their descent back to Earth. In a post-flight interview, Gayle expressed frustration over the trivializing language used to describe their expedition, stating, \"They call it a ride, which I find very irritating because they never say men went for a ride.\"\nAddressing skepticism about the scientific merit of their voyage, Gayle, alongside Aisha Bowe, discussed the broader implications of space exploration on CBS Mornings on Tuesday. \"There's so many things that have been developed in space that benefit Earth...from pharmaceuticals to, like, research on agriculture,\" Aisha highlighted, reports the Mirror.\n\"And, you know, I paused there because we did research and it was emotional...part of what I accomplished in my flight was I was looking at the future of being able to produce crops that can withstand harsh environments so we can look at food security here on Earth, and simultaneously, we also were able to certify that device so more people could do research on New Shepard,\" she continued.\nGayle previously criticized those who referred to the flight as a \"ride,\" arguing that no one would ever say to a [male] astronaut, \"'What a ride.' [Don't] call it a ride.\"\nShe further clarified, \"It's called a flight or a journey. A ride implies it's something frivolous or lighthearted. There's nothing frivolous about what we did.\"\nThis follows Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos' soon-to-be wife, expressing her hopes in a video post that the mission would inspire others to \"dream big.\" She admitted, \"If someone would have told me that I would be able to go to space one day, I would have definitely, well, I don't know, laughed.\"\n\"I can't believe it's happening. My dad used to teach people how to fly, and I used to hang around the hanger and I thought dreaming of becoming a pilot was a huge deal, and this is even bigger.\n\"The incredible women that are going on this flight are extraordinary in all of their fields, but more importantly, they're incredible storytellers,\" she continued, \"So what I'm hoping for is, this flight is not just transformative for them, but also for all of the people that they tell their story to. Hopefully it sparks that imagination to a dream big and reach for the stars.\"\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\nSign up to our FREE newsletter and get the top stories to your inbox\nDAILY NEWSLETTER: Sign up here to get the latest news and updates from the Mirror US straight to your inbox with our FREE newsletter.",

    "text": "When a famous person perishes in an accident or plane crash along with others, it always seems to be the famous person who gets the most ink. That is rather unfair, I believe. Case in point: the 1963 plane crash that took the life of country singer Patsy Cline . The two other passengers who also lost their lives were Hawkshaw Hawkins and Cowboy Copas. (The pilot, Randy Hughes, was killed as well.) They have sadly vanished into the mist of history. Those men were stars when they died. Why did they get marginalized?\nPatsy Cline's Death Has Been Extensively Chronicled; Not So With The Other People On The Plane Per The Tennessean , \"In the half-century following the plane crash, Cline has been the subject of a feature film, a stage play and several biographies, while the lives of Copas, Hawkins and Hughes have been less studied. The focus on Cline alone has been hurtful to some of those left in tragedy's wake.\"\nThe lives and careers of all three mattered. Maybe they did not, from today's viewpoint, attain the same degree of fame as Cline, but they counted too.\nEven Charlie Dick, Cline's widower, agreed. Per the outlet, he said, \"'When that plane went down, Copas was the biggest star onboard,' Cline's widow[er], Charlie Dick, told Opry announcer, country music historian and WSM air personality Eddie Stubbs five years ago.\"\nSometime later, Dick added more to that sentiment. \"Usually, today, Patsy seems to get top billing. But Patsy was a big fan of Copas and Hawk, and they were stars. Everybody on that plane was important to the music business. And all of them were top dogs.\"\nMore About Cowboy Copas, Hawkshaw Hawkins, And Randy Hughes All three men were exceptional. And talented. They each had impressive resumes. Hawkins scored a chart-topping song, \" Lonesome 7-7203 .\" Hughes, at 34, was already a capable manager for Cline. And Copas was a guitarist and skilled musician.\nHawkins' wife, Jean Shephard, reportedly chafed at the attention Cline received, as opposed to the scant scrutiny that the others' deaths got.\nAccording to The Tennessean , Shepard set the record straight. \"A lot of people think during this time that I've hated Patsy Cline. And that's not the story at all. I resented the way it was presented, like she was the only person on that airplane. ...I lost as much as Charlie Dick did. He lost a wife.\"",

    "text": "Dodgers Team News\nDodgers’ Freddie Freeman Out of Lineup For Second Straight Day\nFreddie Freeman will not be in the Los Angeles Dodgers starting lineup for a second consecutive night as he rests a fractured middle finger on his right hand.\nGavin Lux will hit third against the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday night and Kiké Hernandez will get another start at first base.\nThe Dodgers have not placed Freeman on the injured list.\nHernández is getting the start at first base for just the third time this season, and batting ninth. Teoscar Hernández moves to fourth after hitting third on Tuesday night.\nFreeman, 34, is hitting .284 this season with 17 home runs and 73 RBIs. His .382 on-base percentage leads the Dodgers and ranks second in the National League this season. His .475 slugging percentage gives him an .856 OPS (141 OPS+).\nAn All-Star in July, Freeman missed eight games immediately after the break while his son, Max,\nbattled a rare case of Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Since returning, he’s been slowed by a hairline fracture in his right middle finger.\nThrough Sunday, Freeman is 3 for his last 23 with seven strikeouts.\nFreeman is currently under a 6-year, $162 million contract with the Dodgers that runs through 2027. A five-time All-Star, three-time Silver Slugger Award winner, and the 2020 National League MVP, Freeman has never been on the injured list since joining the Dodgers in 2022.\nLast season, Freeman led the National League in doubles (59) while hitting 29 home runs and slugging .567. This year he’s seen his slugging percentage fall nearly 100 points.\nThe Dodgers were already missing Freeman’s power bat with or without him in the lineup, so the time off makes sense. The longer he goes without playing, however, the more a backdated injured list stint seems possible.\nPhoto Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n our\nYouTube channel? livestreams, and more!",

    "title": "Israel asume el \"fracaso\" en el rescate de tres rehenes a los que mató: \"Los ataques podrían haberse evitado\"",
    "text": "El Ejército israelí ha asumido su \"fracaso\" en su misión de rescatar a los tres rehenes que las tropas israelíes mataron en Gaza por error el pasado 15 de diciembre, tras publicar este jueves una investigación con más detalles del incidente. \"Las fuerzas israelíes fracasaron en su misión de rescatar a los rehenes\", y \"toda la cadena de mando se siente responsable\", aseguró el jefe de Estado Mayor, Herzi Halevi, en las conclusiones de las pesquisas hechas por el Ejército que se han difundido este jueves. Según lamentó Halevi, \"los ataques a los cautivos podrían haberse evitado\", ya que \"en una situación donde no existe una amenaza inmediata y no se identifica un enemigo claro, es necesario un momento de examen antes de disparar\". \"Esto es necesario para evitar, entre otras cosas, incidentes en los que nuestras fuerzas disparen contra nuestras fuerzas\", agregó. Según reconoció, en el caso de los tres rehenes muertos, estos \"no se movían amenazadoramente y sostenían una bandera blanca\", por lo que habría sido \"correcto confirmar la identificación antes de disparar\", pero \"las condiciones de presión y el entorno operativo dificultaron que los soldados implementaran estas medidas\". Sin embargo, no se espera que el Ejército israelí tome medidas disciplinarias contra los militares que mataron a los tres cautivos. \"No oyeron la orden\" De acuerdo con la investigación militar, uno de los rehenes, Yotam Haim, recibió disparos un cuarto de hora después de que los soldados que operaban en el barrio de Shijayia de la ciudad de Gaza hubieran disparado ya a los dos otros rehenes, Samer Talalka y Alon Shamriz. Según las propias pesquisas, Haim huyó tras los disparos contra los dos otros cautivos, y \"aproximadamente 15 minutos después, el comandante del batallón escuchó gritos en hebreo de 'ayuda'\". Tras ello, \"dio órdenes para suspender el fuego, gritando en hebreo 'venid hacia nosotros'\", ante lo que el rehén \"emergió de un edificio hacia las fuerzas israelíes\", pero \"dos soldados, que no oyeron la orden\" de cesar el fuego \"por el ruido de un tanque cercano, le dispararon y mataron\". Según la investigación, antes de que se les matara por error, los rehenes \"caminaban sin camisa, y uno de ellos ondeaba una bandera blanca, parado en un punto de visibilidad limitada respecto a la posición del soldado que disparó\".",

    "title": "[生活] 今年來台國際旅客目標？ 交部：超過900萬沒問題",
    "text": "交通部長陳世凱今天(24日)率領首度赴立法院交通委員會報告的觀光署長陳玉秀，在答詢立法委員李昆澤關切今年來台國際旅客可達到多少人次時表示，目標依舊是千萬人次，但目前超過900萬沒問題！\n立法院交通委員會24日邀請交通部長陳世凱率領觀光署長陳玉秀等單位首長，就「我國觀光旅遊市場概況」進行專題報告並備詢。\n立委李昆澤指出，觀光署前年底預估去年全年國際來台旅客可達1,200萬人次，後來下修到1千萬，去年6月底再下修到750萬。至於今年1-4月國際來台旅客是287萬，較去年同期266萬略增8%；依照這樣的增幅，去年全年是785萬人次，增加8%是來到848萬。因此他要求首度備詢的陳玉秀說明，今年來台的國際旅客究竟可達到多少人次？\n陳玉秀答詢時坦言，國際觀光是國際性的競爭，和國際的連動性高，因此包括關稅、匯率及簽證等大環境都會影響旅客來台的意願，加上周邊競爭國提出更優惠的政策，也會同步影響來台的國際旅客人次。她說：『(原音)當然我們現在心目中還是朝千萬嘛，那目前可預估的大概超過900萬是沒有問題的。』\n不過李昆澤質疑，台灣周邊的國家幾乎都已回到疫情前的榮景，日本甚至在中國旅客減少的情況下，國際旅客持續創下新高。追問陳世凱設定今年來台的國際旅客目標是多少？陳世凱則是這樣說：『(原音)報告委員，目前看起來的狀況，我們在過去的6個月看起來是比去年成長10%。那不過現在因為我們的匯率的影響，確實我們在6月份有看出，國際來台的旅客有稍微減少。不過我們的目標，我一直告訴大家，我們去年沒有做到的，我們今年把它做到，也就是那個目標是千萬，不過今年比較有把握的是希望能夠達到900萬、至少要達到900萬，我們要往千萬衝！』\n陳世凱也強調，設定目標僅是KPI的評估項目之一，仍需觀察國際旅客是否一來再來、是否覺得台灣好玩，以及近3年持續增加的趨勢也要維持，同時消費力也要增加。不過李昆澤進一步指出，前年來台的國際旅客每天平均消費180美元，觀光署去年承諾，今年要達到每天195美元，現在的狀況又是如何？陳世凱則表示，現在是185美元，但仍希望今年達到195美元。(編輯：宋皖媛)",

More specifically, quarterback Jeff Driskel and wide receiver David Bell have connected for their second touchdown strike in this game.\nPadding his stats in garbage time, Driskell is now up to 168 yards and two touchdowns on 13-of-26 passing. He also has the two interceptions to his name.\nBell is now up to 68 yards and two touchdowns on four catches for the Browns today. This is a career-high for the second-year receiver out of Purdue.\nWhile the Browns trail in this game by a score of 14-31, it remains refreshing to see that even their second and third-stringers are going to play for a full 60 minutes when given the chance.\nMore importantly, the Browns already have their playoff spot locked down while the Bengals will clean out their lockers in the morning. The Browns will play the Houston Texans in the first round of the playoffs.\n. @DB3LL rises up between defenders and muscles his way into the end zone 💪 #CLEvsCIN on CBS & NFL+ pic.twitter.com/JZTFW6uKzZ\n— Cleveland Browns (@Browns) January 7, 2024\nMore Videos Browns rookie Isaiah McGuire gets his first career sack vs. Bengals Browns get garbage time touchdown as Jeff Driskel finds David Bell deep vs. Bengals D'Anthony Bell not resting, gets second pick as a Brown vs. Bengals Browns join '87 Patriots to start 5 different QBs in a season WATCH: Joe Flacco mic'd up for playoff clinching win over the Jets on Thursday Night",

La temida ‘ola de calor’ que se pronosticó desde la semana pasada se dejó sentir con fuerza, elevando el mercurio de los termómetros a temperaturas superiores a los 40 grados centígrados, lo que supone un serio riesgo de deshidratación y golpes de calor para poblaciones vulnerables. Se espera que la temperatura mantenga una condición extrema durante hoy y mañana, teniendo mejores pronósticos para el próximo sábado. 45 infernales grados en la estación del metro San Nicolás por Av. Universidad 🔥🔥 12:40pm [#LaRutaDeDante] [#OndaDeCalor] [#Monterrey] [pic.twitter.com/0H1VuuI3YO] — Nelson Valdez (@nelvaldez) [May 9, 2024] A través de un comunicado, la Secretaría de Educación de Nuevo León informó que implementará un plan emergente para los planteles de educación básica, mismo que consiste en suspender las clases presenciales matutinas a las 11:00 horas en caso de que las temperaturas superen los 40 grados centígrados. Los planteles vespertinos, por su parte, cerrarán sus puertas al alumnado en caso de que sigan presentándose dichas condiciones. “Se exhorta a los padres de familia con hijas e hijos con alguna precondición de salud a resguardarlos en sus hogares y no exponerlos ante las condiciones climatológicas extremas”, puede leerse en el texto. Apagones e incendios El intenso calor se manifiesta también a través de otros rubros. Desde ayer en la noche se reportan fallos en el suministro de energía eléctrica en diversos municipios de la Zona Metropolitana de Monterrey, tales como Apodaca, Cadereyta, García y San Nicolás. La misma situación se registró hoy por la tarde en el sector poniente de Monterrey, especialmente en las zonas de Mitras, Cumbres y Valle Verde. Cuadrillas de la Comisión Federal de Electricidad trabajan a marchas forzadas para reestablecer el servicio o prevenir próximos apagones, situación que escaló a nivel nacional debido al sobrecargo en la demanda. Otro incendio en el municipio de Escobedo afectando nuestra calidad del aire, se suma a los reportes ciudadanos de esta tarde a las 15:25 horas en el AMM. Agradecemos sus reportes y permanecemos atentos. 09/05/24 [pic.twitter.com/K5K1aTaS7Y] — Observatorio del Aire de Monterrey (@observatoriomty) [May 9, 2024] Para colmo, una seguidilla de incendios registrados a partir del incendio de maleza o fallas eléctricas en automóviles ponen en ‘jaque’ a la población. Algunos de ellos son notorios desde varios puntos de la ciudad; el reportado a espaldas de las ‘Plazas Outlet‘, sobre la avenida Las Torres, en el municipio de Escobedo, y el de un terreno baldío en el Parque Industrial Las Palmas, en Santa Catarina. También destaca el incendio de un lote de carros en la colonia Cumbres del Sol, en la avenida Abraham Lincoln, al poniente de la ciudad, así como el de un domicilio particular en la zona de Las Lajas, en San Jerónimo, al poniente de Monterrey. En coordinación con Protección Civil García, atendemos el incendio de un terreno baldío en. Av. Abraham Lincoln en la colonia Cumbres del Sol.

    "text": "La duración media de un proceso de selección está en torno a los dos o tres meses. Este es el tiempo durante el cual la empresa está dedicando recursos a la selección de talento, a la vez que tiene un puesto de trabajo sin cubrir. Puesto, cuyas tareas y responsabilidades no están saliendo adelante en la forma en que deberían hacerlo. Para acabar con este problema, [Hirint](https://hirint.io/) lanza su herramienta de evaluación de soft skills. Pruebas psicométricas de última generación que agilizan la evaluación de candidatos y garantizan encontrar a los más adecuados para cada puesto. A la vez que mejoran la experiencia de los aspirantes. ¿Cómo ayudan las pruebas psicométricas en la selección de talento? A diferencia de otras pruebas utilizadas en el reclutamiento, este tipo de test permite llevar a cabo una evaluación objetiva tanto de las habilidades técnicas como de las competencias blandas de los candidatos. De esta forma, es más sencillo tener una versión holística de las capacidades de cada aspirante al puesto. Al aplicar este tipo de pruebas en las fases iniciales de la selección, se agiliza el proceso de identificación de aquellos candidatos que se ajustan mejor a los requisitos del puesto. De esta manera, se convierten en el complemento idóneo para la criba curricular. Los test son pruebas que cuentan con una base científica y que dejan totalmente a un lado las impresiones subjetivas. Así, el sesgo subjetivo deja de ser protagonista en la toma de decisiones de contratación. Se trata, además, de herramientas que permiten conocer habilidades y cualidades que no son fáciles de detectar a través de una entrevista de trabajo convencional. La influencia de la tecnología en las pruebas psicométricas La tecnología ha transformado de manera significativa la forma en la que las [pruebas psicométricas](https://hirint.io/utilizacion-de-pruebas-psicometricas-en-la-contratacion-laboral/) se llevan a cabo. El uso de plataformas en línea para la realización de las pruebas está mejorando la experiencia de los candidatos. Que ya no tienen que desplazarse ni estar pendientes de un día y una hora para hacer su evaluación. Por otro lado, la tecnología permite crear pruebas mucho más personalizadas y ajustadas según las necesidades de cada empresa, dando como resultado evaluaciones más efectivas. En última instancia, la aplicación de la tecnología a este tipo de metodologías de selección permite automatizar el análisis de datos, generando informes que evalúan de forma objetiva las capacidades de los aspirantes y que son fáciles de entender por parte del personal encargado de la selección. La tecnología aplicada a los test psicométricos permite agilizar el proceso de selección debido a que las pruebas se diseñan, aplican y evalúan de forma automática por un software. De esta manera, la labor de los reclutadores se centra en tomar decisiones informadas y elegir a los mejores candidatos. Hirint saca el máximo partido a las nuevas tecnologías La solución de Hirint para garantizar una selección de personal ágil y altamente efectiva implica el uso de tecnologías de última generación. Las empresas pueden personalizar las pruebas psicométricas en función de las habilidades y capacidades que estén buscando en los candidatos. Estos realizan las pruebas de forma remota, y los resultados están listos al instante. Con Hirint, crear equipos de trabajo altamente efectivos se vuelve mucho más sencillo y rápido.",
