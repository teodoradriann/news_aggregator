    "text": "It’s time! The Imagine Cruising World Indoor Bowls Championships 2024 starts tomorrow\nAll eyes will be on Potters Resorts in Hopton-on-Sea, Norfolk, from tomorrow (Friday) when it hosts the Imagine Cruising World Indoor Bowls Championships\nSeventeen days of world-class action will be streamed into your home – if you’re not fortunate to be watching the matches in person, of course.\nLast year, the mecca of bowls that is the five-star all-inclusive resort on the east coast created its own unique magical conclusion to the 2023 event when qualifiers Jamie Walker (pictured) and Jason Banks reached the final, with Northampton-born Walker edging home in the tightest of games 8-7, 7-7 to pick up the unique Langham Glass trophy and a prize purse of £50,000.\nNow both in the World Bowls Tour’s Top 16 as a result of their success on the portable rink last January, Walker will be back to defend his title. He faces Scotland’s Iain McLean in the first round, who won the Glasgow IBC PBA qualifier.\nSaid Walker: “I am definitely looking forward to defending my title and getting back out on the portable rink at Potters. In fact, I’ve been looking forward to it since January to be honest.\n“2023 has been a decent year winning the national fours indoors after Potters was a great way to round off the season. The world outdoors championships were held in Australia towards the end of the summer; it’s always great to play over in Oz. The competition is always very high and with the different elements over there, it’s a different challenge to what we experience in the northern hemisphere.\n“I’ve been easing into the indoor season ok. I had a great run in the Scottish International Open reaching the final and finishing runner-up to Stewart Anderson. I plan on playing plenty of nationals and a few open singles tournaments in the build up which should make sure I’ve had enough time on the green before the championship is here.\n“The event as a whole is a great experience. Potters Resorts is an amazing venue for these championships to be held at. It has everything. I’m looking forward to the banter off the green and hopefully some high quality games on it.”\nBanks, will no doubt be keen to overturn the disappointment of losing in the final, has been drawn against Australian qualifier Blake Nairn who played in the Scottish International Open in November.\nAnother Aussie making his way across the big pond for the championships is Aron Sherriff who wins a place as a result of being the current World Bowls Indoor Championships singles winner. He talks to us ahead of his first round match against none other than five times winner of the event and current World Bowls Tour number one ranked player Paul Foster MBE. The only woman in the open singles is the USA’s Giulia Galio.\nIn the other competitions, defending ladies’ matchplay champion Katherine Rednall will be looking for her sixth title. Her opening match is against fellow England international team-mate and PBA qualifier Annalisa Dunham.\nAnnalisa is one of the new faces to the portable rink for the ladies’ matchplay, along with Wales’ Lauren Gowan, Ailsa Robertson from Scotland and Giulia Galio.\nA new addition this year sees all the competitors in the matchplay play gain entry in the mixed pairs too.\nIn both pairs events – open and mixed – there’s a few new partnerships, including Jason Banks and Paul Foster, in the open pairs, and it would take a brave person to pick the winner as all pairings will no doubt fancy their chances of tasting success.\nGreg Harlow and Nicky Brett’s quest to retain the open pairs starts against Northampton IBC PBA qualifier winners Paul Nicholls and Tim Stone, while mixed pairs holders Ceri Ann Glen and Stewart Anderson find themselves up against Annalisa Dunham and David Gourlay MBE. Sara Nicholls makes her debut as one of the first women to qualify in the open pairs and Sian Honnor speaks to her ahead of her appearance elsewhere in this feature, while John Rednall catches up with Scotland’s Darren Weir who has qualified in both the singles and Under 25 singles.\nWill it be a hattrick of wins for Daniel Pool, winner of the Under 25 singles title in 2022 and 2023, or will Darren get his name on the honours board after being runner-up to Pool on those occasions?\nBumper crowds are again expected at Potters throughout the championships and World Bowls Tour are delighted to have Imagine Cruising back on board for their second year as the headline sponsor of the event.\nEvery match will be streamed live on the\nWorld Bowls Tour’s Facebook page and YouTube channel at no cost.

    "title": "Power now restored to all homes in Scotland affected by Storm Gerrit | The Leader",
    "text": "All homes that lost power as Storm Gerrit lashed Scotland have now been reconnected, bosses at power firm SSEN have confirmed. The electricity provider said its teams had worked through “particularly challenging conditions” to restore supplies to more than 48,000 homes. A final push by staff saw the last properties without electricity reconnected by 11pm on Friday, with customers in parts of Aberdeenshire, Perthshire and The Great Glen area in the Highlands all now with power again. Andy Smith, SSEN distribution’s operations director, said the storm had brought “serious disruption” with gale force winds having reached recorded speeds of 86mph in Inverbervie, Aberdeenshire and 84mph in Lerwick, Shetland. Mr Smith said: “Storm Gerrit caused serious disruption across the north of Scotland, and I would like to say thank you to our customers for their patience while we worked through some particularly challenging conditions to reconnect them, as quickly and safely as possible. “I’m very proud of the work undertaken by SSEN’s operational teams, and for being out at all hours and in all weathers to find and fix the faults over the past few days. “I would also like to extend my gratitude to our contract partners and fellow network operators for how they supported our response.” SSEN is now encouraging customers who were left without power to apply for compensation, depending on how long they were without electricity for. Completion of work to restore electricity supplies comes ahead of the latest weather alert, with a yellow warning for rain and snow having been issued for much of Scotland on Saturday. As a result of that Network Rail Scotland said speed restrictions will be in place on the West Highland Lines from 10am today until 9am on Sunday.

    "title": "New Hampshire residents hunker down in Florida during Hurricane Milton",
    "text": "The good thing about being from New Hampshire and getting caught in Hurricane Milton is many hearty folks from these parts have “transferable skills,” having survived blizzards, microbursts and wild thunderstorms. The bad thing is that Florida’s brand of natural disasters can be a tad more intense when you’re staring down a tropical cyclone raging toward the coast as a Category 5 a day before it makes landfall. Olivia Torres, 21, who grew up in Nashua and is now a senior at the University of Tampa, said she’s definitely getting the hang of it. “Since this is technically my third hurricane, I knew what I was going into, but the fact that it turned into a Category 5 had me a little bit worried,” Torres said. “Especially because where the University of Tampa is situated, it is in Flood Zone A. So out of everybody in Tampa, we were the first to be like, ‘Yeah, we need to go.’” Hurricane Milton weakened as it approached Tampa, making landfall as a Category 3 late Wednesday. Torres and her classmates had already bugged out of their on-campus housing by Tuesday morning. Torres’s 19-year-old brother, Jackson, is also a UT student. Their dad, Walt, came to get them on Monday night and take them to Kissimmee, where he and his wife, Gloria, recently moved. “Thankfully, there hasn’t been too much damage where I am,” Olivia Torres said. “I know some other places can’t say the same.” Although most of their family is still back in New England, Olivia Torres said she now feels like a battle-tested Floridian. “I definitely think after four years of living here, I’m an official Florida resident because when this hurricane came around, I was like, ‘All right, let’s go.’ I already had a plan in place,” she said. “It’s like you’re trading in your snow days for hurricane weeks, or ‘hurrication’ as they call it down here.” ‘Gator Aid’ From Tampa to Kissimmee to Gainesville, several New Hampshire residents were in Florida during the storm, which brought dangerous winds, heavy rain, flooding, storm surge and nearly 40 tornadoes. Five [logistics specialists from New Hampshire’s Army National Guard](https://www.unionleader.com/news/safety/new-hampshire-guard-races-to-florida-ahead-of-hurricane/article_bb9bc98c-84f5-11ef-9bbc-5beb4fedd2f4.html) settled into their weeklong mission Wednesday after arriving at the Robert F. Ensslin Jr. National Guard armory in Gainesville on Tuesday after 19 hours of driving. With an unofficial moniker of “Gator Aid,” the Granite Staters began their mission of managing convoys of supplies and personnel. Lt. Col. Greg Heilshorn, public affairs officer for the New Hampshire National Guard, provided an update on Facebook from the team Thursday after speaking on the phone with Capt. James Kelly, a logistics chief for Joint Force Headquarters. “We are providing breathing room for Florida as all this extra help flows into the state,” said Kelly, a Nashua resident. Kelly’s team is coordinating incoming support from the rest of the country, including 6,000 inbound guardsmen from 15 states, 22 helicopters, more than 500 high-water vehicles, and 13 boats, he said. As of noon Thursday, the team was tracking 35 separate movements and 1,400 guardsmen in transit. New Hampshire also sent Capt. Justin Moran, 1st Lt. Christopher Bruneau, Master Sgt. Bernard Hudgens and Sgt. 1st Class Scott Jones. Hudgens and Jones were among 500 New Hampshire guardsmen who deployed to New Orleans in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. “The group we have down here — everyone gets along,” Kelly said. “We are plugged in. We are working super hard. Morale is great.” New Hampshire [also deployed five members of its Homeland Security and Emergency Management team](https://www.unionleader.com/news/safety/new-hampshire-sends-more-aid-to-florida-for-life-threatening-hurricane-milton/article_626769e8-866c-11ef-bcc9-ef1f6dadc73f.html) to Florida on Wednesday. Lisa Carter, who lives in New Hampshire, has family in Lakeland, Florida. Her mother, stepfather and sister sheltered together. Carter’s mom, Diane Wilkes, moved to an upscale 55-plus mobile home community in Florida in 2016. Her sister, Tresa Carter, moved there from Delaware recently to be closer to their mom. Wilkes and her husband, Peter, stayed with Tresa Carter. “Everybody is doing great. I was just on the phone with them earlier today,” Lisa Carter said Thursday afternoon. Lakeland was spared from Milton’s full wrath, but Lisa Carter’s family lost power and there was some damage to the rental property Tresa Carter owns. The tornadoes did get pretty close to them in Lakeland though. “There were tornadoes along Interstate 4 going into Orlando. Mileage-wise, that was only about 10-15 miles from where my parents and my sister were,” she said. Lisa Carter runs a website called [letsmovetofla.com](https://www.letsmovetofla.com), which helps people from other states learn everything they can about moving to Florida. Through the website and social media, she ended up helping direct first-timers to the resources they needed on the ground during the hurricane. “There’s so much you don’t know before you get down there,” she said.",

    "text": "The upcoming year will be filled with blessings, at least that is what the numerical sequence of this New Year’s Eve date suggests.\nIf you take a closer look at the date, written as 12/31/23 or even 123123, you might see an angel number, which are repeating number sequence s, often used as a guide for deeper spiritual exploration. The numerical sequences can range anywhere from 000 to 999 , with each number having a distinct meaning and energy, USA Today previously reported.\nThe once-in-a-century date, which won’t be seen again on our calenders until Dec. 31, 2123, marks a new beginning. One, that asks us to “transform and evolve with the times and in the right place to embrace what is coming to us,” according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website.\nThe date has also sparked an online trend, with TikTok users creating videos on the significance of the number and merchandise commemorating the date selling online, including on platforms like Amazon , eBay and Etsy , the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA Today Network reported.\nHere’s what we know about the date.\nWhat does 12/31/23 signify within numerology? Numerology is an ancient esoteric science that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist Novalee Wilder shared with USA Today earlier this month.\n\"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\"\nThe numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number.\nProfessional astrologer Narayana Montúfar told Farmer’s Almanac that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.”\nIf you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12.\nThe number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated.\nFYI: How to keep your pets calm during New Year's Eve fireworks\nWhat are some dates to keep in mind in 2024? If you are an angel number enthusiast, there are a few key dates you might want to keep in mind as 2024 rapidly approaches.\nA palindrome, not unlike an angel number, is a term typically reserved for words or phrases that are spelled the same way backward as they are forward. Words like level, kayak, civic, and radar are among some of the most common palindromes, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.\nNumerical sequences seen in dates or times can also be palindromes, the most well-recognized ones being 3/20/23 or 11:11 , the website stated.\nHere are all palindrome dates that will occur in 2024, courtesy of the Farmer’s Almanac :\n4/2/24 4/20/24 4/21/24 4/22/24 4/23/24 4/24/24 4/25/24 4/26/24 4/27/24 4/28/24 4/29/24 Contributing: Olivia Munson, USA Today\n30 famous Capricorns you should know: These celebrities belong to the winter Zodiac sign",
