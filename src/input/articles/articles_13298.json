I say that as a born-and-bred East Coaster, but trust me, it's a lot better than it was in early December (when things were so sparse you could see the dirt under your skis!)\nWith the last couple of storms (the last storm still going on, there's snow coming this Saturday too) the base has increased tremendously, to the point where you can get away without tuning your skis. Shouts to everyone who used their rock skis and saved themselves $70 instead of Ptexing their bases those first few weeks!\n🌹Rose Report: BLUEBIRD\n❄️| 18-20\" overnight\n5°F - Wind 15-22 W - Sunny\n🛗 Zephyr - Scheduled 8:30am\n🛗 Northwest - Scheduled 9am\n🛗 Lakeview - Scheduled 9am\n🛗 Galena - Scheduled 9am\n🛗 Wizard - Scheduled 9am\n🛻| Chains or Snow Tires required on 431 - Roads are slick - Be Safe\n— MtRoseSkiTahoe (@MtRoseSkiTahoe) January 11, 2024 Mt. Rose got 18-20\" overnight, not surprising as Mt. Rose is Tahoe's highest base elevation ski resort. It seems like there's always snow over there!\nPalisades Tahoe didn't do too badly itself. 3 inches overnight and 14 inches over the last 24 hours? We'll take it.\nFamily friendly Northstar saw 15 inches over the last 24 hours, with 17 inches in the last 48.\nPowder-famous Heavenly saw 19 inches over the last day, but that's the least of their good news: their gondola also resumes operations tomorrow!\nRelated: Heavenly Resort Plans To Reopen Essential Gondola Tomorrow\nSugar Bowl got 10 inches at their summit in the last 24 hours, and their base got 6 inches (not too shabby)!\nThe Sugar Bowl snow reporter noted that powder hounds should \"get it quick before the next storm rolls in on Saturday,\" (my thoughts exactly, when the vis is bad, there's not a lot of fun to be had...) \"see y'all in the lift lines!\"\nThe natural, terrain-filled Kirkwood got 7 inches in the last day, and 8 in the last two.\nBoreal , famous for its night skiing and terrain park, got 9 inches overnight. That will stoke out those park rats (or not, because they have to reshape all the jumps).\nDown south a little, Mammoth Mountain's snow report accounts for 14-16 inches of fresh powder overnight, with 14 inches at the Main Lodge today.\nThe nearby, mellow June Mountain also got hit with the latest storm, with 6 inches in the last 24 hours.\nWhere are you most excited to ski? Me, I'm just stoked to be able to spray some snow when doing hockey stops at the base of the lifts.

Baruah is believed to be residing at a place along the China-Myanmar border.\nThe ULFA was formed in 1979 with the demand for a “sovereign Assam”. Since then, it has been involved in subversive activities that led to the central government declaring it a banned outfit in 1990.\nThe Rajkhowa faction joined peace talks with the government on September 3, 2011, after an agreement for Suspension of Operations (SoO) was signed between it and central and state governments.

    "text": "New Delhi: Dense fog engulfed the national capital as cold waves gripped the city on Friday morning.\nAccording to the India Meteorological Department, Delhi recorded 9.6 degrees Celsius at 5.30 am on Friday. The air quality in the national capital has deteriorated from ‘poor’ to ‘very poor’.\nAccording to the Central Pollution Control Board, the AQI was recorded at 348 in Delhi today at 6 am.\nAn AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good,’ 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory,’ 101 and 200 ‘moderate,’ 201 and 300 ‘poor,’ 301 and 400 ‘very poor,’ and 401 and 500 ‘severe.’\nMeanwhile, as the temperature dips, homeless people in the city increasingly rely on night shelters.\nThe Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) has also set up 235 pagoda tents to shelter homeless people. Night shelters have been set up in several areas of the national capital, including AIIMS, Lodhi Road, and Nizamuddin flyover.\nIn response to the chilly weather, residents of the capital were seen gathering around bonfires, while others took shelter in night homes as temperatures continued to drop.\nOn Friday, North Indian states continued to face harsh winter conditions. Uttar Pradesh’s capital Lucknow, the temperature is recorded at 8 degrees Celsius at 3.30 am. The local administrations have set up temporary shelter homes for the homeless people. UP’s Aligarh people were seen taking refuge in one of these shelters.\nIn Jammu and Kashmir’s capital Srinagar, the temperature was recorded at -1.3 degrees Celsius at 5.30 am.\nMeanwhile, airline carrier Indigo on Thursday issued a travel advisory for its flight operations in Srinagar as the region was experiencing snowfall impacting flight schedules.\n“We wish the snowfall could take a brief pause, allowing us to ensure smooth travels for you once again. Stay warm and stay informed,” the airlines stated.\nIn Rajasthan’s capital Jaipur, the temperature was recorded at 10.2 degrees Celsius at 5.30 am today.\nRajasthan Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma visited the winter shelter homes set up near Gandhinagar Railway Station here on Thursday night to take stock of the arrangements.\nThe Chief Minister was seen interacting with the homeless people and distributing blankets to them.\nBhajanlal Sharma said that “good arrangements” are made in the night shelter homes.\n“No one should face any problem, I have mentioned this to all of you. Also through ‘Chief Minister Sadbhavna Kendra’ all our people are helping. Our municipality has built night shelter homes and they have made very good arrangements. No one must face any problem,” Sharma told reporters after taking stock of the arrangements in the night shelters.\n(Source: ANI)\nAlso Read: Free for wife but double for husband: Karnataka LoP Ashoka on KSRTC bus fare hike",

    "title": "Se lía parda con Coca Cola, la IA y un polémico anuncio de Navidad",
    "text": "Desde hace aproximadamente dos años, la inteligencia artificial (IA) ha estado evolucionando de forma rápida no, lo siguiente . Como prueba de ello tenemos lo que ha hecho Coca Cola hace poco, cuando realizó el lanzamiento de su ya tradicional anuncio navideño de cara a las próximas fiestas. Básicamente, a todos los temores que viene levantando esta tecnología con respecto a si pondrá o no en peligro cierta cantidad de trabajos , luego de ver este anuncio debemos agregarle el correspondiente a la labor de los publicistas .\nDespués de que Sam Altman , director ejecutivo de OpenAI, la compañía responsable de ChatGPT, afirmara que es posible conseguir la inteligencia artificial general con hardware actual, es decir, que en menos tiempo del esperado estaremos viendo cómo la IA es capaz de realizar tareas intelectuales de la misma forma o incluso mejor que los seres humanos , ahora nos topamos con el polémico anuncio navideño de Coca Cola, el cual ha sido creado 100 % con inteligencia artificial .\n¿Coca Cola «anuncia» el fin de los publicistas? Recientemente Coca Cola ha publicado en su canal de YouTube su nuevo anuncio de Navidad , el cual tiene como protagonista explícito a la Coca Cola Zero ; y decimos «explícito» porque el verdadero personaje principal de esta propaganda es la inteligencia artificial , la cual ha sido empleada para crear la totalidad del archivo audiovisual.\nTal y como se puede apreciar en el vídeo, el nuevo anuncio navideño que ha sido generado por la IA empieza con los clásicos camiones de la empresa de bebidas llegando al hogar de Santa Claus. Luego, a lo largo del cortometraje es posible ver cómo este personaje le va entregando una botella de Coca Cola Zero a varias personas. Sin embargo, lo más llamativo de esta producción es lo realistas que se ven los supuestos seres vivos que intervienen , pues a simple vista tanto los osos polares como las personas parecen estar hechas de carne y hueso .\nLa primera piedra de un gran cambio Tengamos algo claro: a Coca Cola le sobran los recursos económicos para contratar a todo el equipo necesario para realizar un anuncio de cara a la Navidad. Por ende, si no lo ha hecho y ha decidido apostar 100 % por la inteligencia artificial es porque, por un lado, quiere llamar la atención (y lo está consiguiendo), y por otro, desea ser recordada como la primera gran compañía que «reemplazó» a los publicistas por la tecnología que más está de moda por estos días.\nPor lo anterior, lo hecho por esta multinacional le abre las puertas a la posibilidad de que, de aquí en adelante, diferentes empresas mundialmente reconocidas empiecen a copiar el método de Coca Cola a la hora de crear sus propios anuncios . No nos engañemos, la idea no resulta para nada alocada: de esta forma, las compañías lograrán ahorrarse una gran cantidad de dinero y conseguirán que cada producción quede exactamente como desean , pues por muy avanzada que esté la IA, todavía sigue estando bajo el control humano… al menos por ahora.",

    "title": "STM mantém condenação de mulher que se casou com sogro para herdar pensão do Exército - 15/08/2024 | Diário do Grande ABC",
    "text": "O Superior Tribunal Militar (STM) manteve nesta terça-feira, 13, a condenação de uma mulher que se casou com o próprio sogro, um ex-combatente da Segunda Guerra Mundial, para receber uma pensão concedida pelo Exército Brasileiro, segundo a decisão. A Corte entendeu que houve um esquema de fraude orquestrado por ela e o filho do militar. A mulher que se casou com o sogro se chama Arlete Torres de Andrade. Ela e o ex-marido, Josualdo Fábio de Andrade Lima, são moradores de Recife (PE) e foram condenados pela Justiça Militar da União, no ano passado, por fraude contra o sistema de pensão do Exército. A Corte considerou que os dois cometeram estelionato e decretou a pena de três anos de prisão. Procurada, a defesa dos dois não respondeu. Em 2012, Arlete se casou com o pai de Josualdo. O idoso, que na época tinha 89 anos, foi combatente na Segunda Guerra Mundial. Ela era 40 anos mais nova que ele. Com Alzheimer, o ex-combatente morreu um ano após a formalização do matrimônio. Um mês após a morte do idoso, Arlete apresentou um requerimento de habilitação de pensão. O benefício foi concedido, e o STM estimou que a mulher recebeu, de 2013 até 2021, R$ 435 mil, que em valores atuais somam mais de R$ 919 mil. De acordo com a denúncia do Ministério Público Militar, Arlete e Josualdo moravam com o idoso. O MP afirma ainda que não é possível atestar que o ex-combatente tinha conhecimento do plano arquitetado pelos dois, devido à saúde debilitada. Após a decisão da Justiça Militar, a defesa do casal recorreu da decisão no STM. O relator do processo na Corte de Brasília, o ministro Marco Antônio de Farias, entendeu que o casal usou do Alzheimer do idoso para formalizar um casamento antes que ele morresse. \"O cenário leva o paciente à demência, termo usado para indicar que o indivíduo perdeu sua capacidade de raciocínio, julgamento e memória, tornando-se dependente de apoio em suas atividades diárias. A doença é fatal e, além de deteriorar a memória, compromete progressivamente as habilidades da vida diária, causando a perda da capacidade de raciocínio, julgamento e organização\", disse o ministro. O ministro Artur Vidigal de Oliveira discordou do relator e votou nesta terça-feira para absolver os dois réus. Segundo o magistrado, a certidão de casamento entre Arlete e o ex-combatente tinha fé pública e não poderia ser admitida como fraude. \"Como visto nos autos, não há comprovação inequívoca que a vontade do ex-combatente não tenha sido livre e consciente. Há a assinatura dele e fotos do casamento, além do ateste do cartório\", afirmou Vidigal. O relator discordou, afirmando que mesmo com a certidão de casamento oficial, os fatos mostravam que o enlace era uma fraude. A maioria dos ministros seguiu a interpretação de Marco Antônio de Farias. Atenção! Os comentários do site são via Facebook.
