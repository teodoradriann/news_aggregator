    "text": "NEWBURYPORT — The Custom House Maritime Museum will jump-start its yearlong 50th anniversary celebration at the Blue Ocean Music Hall on Sept. 19 by hosting the Seafaring Soiree gala. Museum Executive Director James Russell promises an evening of elegance, community spirit and historical maritime significance that will also feature a new watercolor painting by City Clerk Richard Jones. “This will be pure fun and provide lasting memories,” he said. “It will allow participants to go on a vicarious voyage that will position the Custom House well for the next 50 years.” Tickets for the fundraiser went on sale Monday with admission being $200 per person or $2,000 for a table of 10. For the price of admission, guests will enjoy dinner, dancing, entertainment and a live auction. Jones said he is in the midst of painting a watercolor study that depicts the Custom House as the focal point of the downtown in the mid-1800s. It will be featured prominently at the September gala. “I was going for recreating the feeling of the era, as you come along Water Street, beginning with existing buildings like the ferry wharf building and leading up to the Custom House,” Jones said. “I think a lot of the Custom House and have always wished them the best. I hope this will make for a terrific gala celebration.” The Custom House, according to Russell, began as a place for the federal government to collect taxes on imported goods in the early 1800s. Seafaring Soiree Gala Board co-Chair Susan Bernhard said the painting should be unveiled sometime before the event, with prints available for sale to benefit the museum. “Richard is capturing the essence of the city in the 1800s with the Custom House as a shining beacon in the background,” she said. “It will hang in the museum for the next year, with the gala’s sponsors listed along with it.” Russell extended his thanks to the gala’s anchor sponsor and honorary chair, Dan Healey, as well as flagship sponsor Newburyport Bank and maritime sponsor Fritz DeGuglielmo. Andrew Sidford Architects, Bentley’s Real Estate, Darling Consulting, Finneran & Nicholson, P.C., Jeffrey C Kirpas & Co., the Institution for Savings, Matter Communications, Mead Talerman & Costa were also given credit by Russell as merchant sponsors. “On behalf of the board, staff and volunteers, as well as the entire community who benefit, we thank these sponsors for stepping up to the plate and being true philanthropists and community leaders,” he said. “Their tremendous support will elevate the museum to new heights.” Bernhard said the support of sponsors is instrumental in preserving the Custom House’s maritime heritage while also propelling the museum into a future of excellence and community service. “Our 50th anniversary gala is both a tribute to our rich past and a launching point for our ambitious future,” she said. “We’re calling on our community to join us in celebrating our maritime legacy of the lower Merrimack Valley and to support our vision for the next half century.” Museum volunteers and staff have spent most of 2024 preparing for the 50th anniversary celebration by meticulously cataloging and preserving the Custom House’s 6,000-item collection. Russell said the effort will continue into 2025 and new exhibitions are being installed. “I’m extremely fortunate to be the executive director during the museum’s golden anniversary year,” he said. “I know the board of directors is excited to launch the museum into the future with new robust community initiatives, all with the intention of providing meaningful and relevant programming for visitors and residents, alike.” To purchase tickets to the Seafaring Soiree, go to: www.thechmm.org .

Saunders. “I would like to thank the Sansing family and our generous donors for allowing us to enhance UWF’s care for student-athletes as they compete in their given sports. This facility will serve as a source of pride for the University and the community for years to come.”\nThe 10,000-square-foot center will provide enhanced care and expanded space for more than 370 UWF student-athletes and staff. Sandy Sansing ‘69, CEO of Sandy Sansing Automotive, Peggy Sansing and the Sansing Foundation were recognized at the ceremony for their gift commitment of more than $600,000 to the center and student-athlete scholarships.\n“As a UWF graduate and a former student athlete, I am thrilled to be able to help make this facility happen for current and future Argonauts,” said Sansing. “To be able to get behind our university and our athletic program and help them add state-of-the-art facilities and continue to grow and get better is something that my family and I are excited about. We hope this new center helps with the health and wellness of all our future Argos and continues to help the University build champions for life.”\nUWF athletics worked with Andrews Institute for Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine on design and necessary spaces within the facility for student-athletes and coaches. Through a partnership with Baptist Health Care and Andrews Institute for Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine, students in UWF’s movement sciences and health department will be training in this space, earning contact hours and lab hours through internships and learning opportunities on-site.\nDarrell Gooden ‘73; Dr. Judy Bense, UWF President Emeritus; Eric and Peg ‘81, ‘03 Nickelsen; Rodney ‘91 and Amy ‘98 Sutton; Joe and Maggie Ambersley; Jason ‘04, ‘10 and Heather Crawford; Stephen ‘81 and Mona ‘79 Wright; and Rick Fountain ‘70 and many other donors helped make this project a reality.\nFor more information about UWF Athletics, visit goargos.com.",

    "text": "Highway patrol officer provides safety driving tips for winter weather Police officers can see the worst of the worst on their jobs. This is why one officer is providing some safety tips while driving on potential ice roads next week. COLUMBUS, Miss (WCBI)- Temperatures are expected to stay below freezing for at least 48 hours next week, and much of the area is under a winter weather alert. this means ice could cover the roads. Mississippi Highway Patrol Public Affairs Officer Derrick Beckom said there are a few things you should do before buckling up to drive. “If you have to travel you want to make sure that you have plenty of fuel, you want to check your antifreeze level and all our other fluid levels, you want to also check your tire pressure. So that you do not end up stranded out there, if you are out there and we have to respond to you, then our response time may be slower than usual, so you may end up out there longer than you need to be. Again, I would like to add that if you do not need to be out there, then don’t. Go ahead and get the things that you need to get for your home before this weather gets bad,” said Derrick Beckom. Beckom also said to be sure you have a backup plan just in case you cannot make it back to your home. “If you are out and have to travel, you want to keep blankets in your vehicle and something to drink. Preferably something warm like coffee or hot cocoa, travel with those things if you can,” said Beckom. If you do not take the necessary precautions, it could hurt you in the long run. “You could be stuck out there for hours, and that could cause some serious health issues for people that have bad health. You do not want to get out there and be stuck out there for hours and hours, if we get a lot of calls during this time, that could prevent us from getting to someone in a bad situation,” said Beckom. Beckom said he has seen the result of people not taking precautions during inclement weather. “It is year-round, whenever we see things like this, that potential bad weather when people sliding off the roadways and crashing into each other and that is what we don’t want, we cannot tell you not to drive, but we want to encourage every person that if you do not have to travel during this inclement weather then don’t,” said Beckom.",

    "text": "Drama in Bordeaux! Historic Girondins Bordeaux Renounces Professional Football Club Status The historic French club will disappear due to economic instability and its players will be free. Sad news from France: According to “Sud Ouest,” the historic club Girondins de Bordeaux has informed the French Football Federation (FFF) that it will give up its professional football status, which it has held since 1937. On Tuesday, the French club was relegated to the third division due to financial instability for a second-division club, and now it faces potential extinction.\nThe Bundesliga Will Test Ball Contact Technology\nThis situation has serious implications for others, as players, staff, and coaches under Albert Riera will have their contracts dissolved and will become free agents. Additionally, the team’s training center will lose its accreditation, so youth players will also be released, and if they find new teams, Girondins won’t receive any compensation.\nGirondins is leaving as a historic team in France, with six French league titles in its trophy cabinet, the last one in 2008 under Laurent Blanc. The club also boasts four French Cups, three League Cups, three Super Cups, and an Intertoto Cup. The team will also be remembered for reaching the UEFA Cup final in 1995-96, where they lost to Bayern Munich.\nPlayers like Zinedine Zidane, Bixente Lizarazu, and Christophe Dugarry are examples of the greatness Girondins once had, featuring world-class talent that was exported to clubs where they became international football stars.\nRonald Araujo Begins Recovery with Barcelona\nThis is the sad reality for a once-great and historic team that has lost its way and hit rock bottom. Today, Girondins looks to the future, facing only extinction and the collapse of what was once a major European club.",

    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) – France has expelled a Tunisian Muslim cleric for “radicalism” and “unacceptable remarks”, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in a statement on Twitter.\n“The radical Imam Mahjoub Mahjoubi has just been expelled from the national territory, less than 12 hours after his arrest. We will not let people get away with anything,” Darmanin said in a statement on X.\nIn an earlier statement, Darmanin said he had given instructions to issue a ministerial deportation order against “this radical ‘imam’ with unacceptable remarks”. “Firmness is the rule,” he added.\nIn a post that went viral on social media and was widely reported in French media, the imam referred to “the three-coloured flag” as “satanic”.\nMahjoubi, who preached in the Ettaouba mosque of Bagnols-sur-Ceze, southern France, has denied any wrongdoing. He told French media that his comments had been taken out of context and that he had not meant to disrespect the French flag. The French flag has three colours: blue, white and red.\nHis lawyer told French media he will appeal the expulsion procedure.\nFrench media published excerpts of the expulsion order, which stated that Mahjoubi had “conveyed a literal, backward, intolerant, and violent conception of Islam, likely to encourage behaviors contrary to the values of the Republic, discrimination against women, identity retreat, tensions with the Jewish community, and jihadist radicalization’.”\nBFM reported that Mahjoubi was being held in administrative detention in the Paris region.\nDarmanin did not specify where the imam had been held nor when, how and where to he was expelled.\nFranceinfo reported that Mahjoubi was on a plane headed to Tunis on Thursday evening.\nDarmanin said that the French government’s new immigration law, voted earlier this year, had allowed for the quick expulsion of the imam.\nWith the far-right RN party leading in polls for European elections in June, President Emmanuel Macron is under pressure to be tough on immigration and identity issues.\n(Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Alistair Bell)",

    "text": "Ivan Zhakata Herald Correspondent\nZANU PF spokesperson Cde Christopher Mutsvangwa has denied that the ruling party is rubbing its hands with glee over the crisis bedevilling the main opposition CCC party, saying instead, they feel the unfolding drama does not bode well for the country’s democratic processes.\nThis comes as the opposition party has disintegrated in the wake of deep-seated factionalism which has seen its founder, Mr Nelson Chamisa, resigning while several legislators and local authority councillors have been recalled from their positions by interim secretary-general Mr Sengezo Tshabangu, forcing by-elections.\nThe recalls forced Mr Chamisa to stand down amid reports that he is forming another party.\nCde Mutsvangwa said Zanu PF was not gloating over the disaster that was unfolding in the CCC adding that such conduct was not in sync with Zanu PF’s democratic ethos of republican constitutionalism and multi-party democracy.\n“Rather, we commiserate with the ill fortunes of a disintegrating party as a player in a multi-party political milieu,” Cde Mutsvangwa said.\n“On this occasion, we were loudly pondering the mistakes and mis-steps that can befall a political party and in the process, advertising to our membership and cadreship, the political pitfalls to avoid in democratic party building.\n“The travails of CCC are viewed as a live template of what not do. We opt to learn rather than to gloat.”\nThe crisis in the opposition CCC is deepening and broadening, with senior members and advisors to Mr Chamisa publicly firing political salvos and diatribes interpretively directed towards former legislators and what are supposed to be his two deputies, Mr Tendai Biti and Professor Welshman Ncube.\nThe two ex-legislators have been on the receiving end of vicious and unrestrained attacks on online platform X (formerly Twitter) by Mr Chamisa’s allies, who are suggesting that Prof Ncube and Mr Biti are behind the recall of MPs and councillors by Mr Tshabangu.\nMr Chamisa’s close associates allege that Mr Biti and his fellow People’s Democratic Party (PDP) members who followed him into the MDC-A and then the CCC, were conniving with Mr Tshabangu to precipitate the implosion of CCC.",

    "text": "Für die Streaminganbieter sind die Jahre des riesigen Wachstums offensichtlich vorbei. Das ältere Publikum wird jetzt als Zielgruppe attraktiver, besagt eine großangelegte...\nBerlin (dpa) - . Die Streaminganbieter in Deutschland erreichen nur bei Menschen über 30 noch Zuwächse. „Erstmals ziehen die 30- bis 49-Jährigen bei der Streaming-Abo-Nutzung mit 68 Prozent an den Jüngeren (14-29 Jahre) mit 66 Prozent vorbei“, steht in der Bewegtbild-Studie „Screens in Motion 2025“ der Zeitschrift „TV Spielfilm“ aus dem Burda Verlag.\nAufgrund des höheren Bevölkerungsanteils stelle die mittlere Altersgruppe ohnehin die mit Abstand größte Masse der Streaming-Abo-Nutzer. Die Autoren der Studie sehen alles in allem erstmals eine „gewisse Sättigung“ auf Deutschlands Streamingmarkt.\nStreaming schrumpft im jungen Publikum leicht\nDie Langzeitentwicklung der Sehdauern seit 2019 zeigt für jüngere Abonnenten sogar einen minimalen Rückgang der täglichen Streaming-Sehdauer auf hohem Niveau von 2 Minuten auf 1 Stunde 16 Minuten, wie in der Studie zu lesen ist. „In der mittleren Altersgruppe (30-49 Jahre) hat die Sehdauer Streaming im gleichen Zeitraum um 32 Minuten zugenommen, auf nun ebenfalls 1 Stunde 16 Minuten.“\nDie über 50-Jährigen gucken den Ergebnissen zufolge aktuell nur 42 Minuten täglich Streamingangebote, das ist aber eine Zunahme um 25 Minuten. Größeres Neukunden-Potenzial ist demnach bei dem älteren Publikum zu vermuten.\nZwar seien Netflix und Prime Video nach wie vor die Platzhirsche. Auf Platz drei von den Nutzeranteilen her folge allerdings auf ähnlichem Niveau schon YouTube, also eine Video-Plattform. „Warum das so ist? Es hängt sicherlich mit dem Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis zusammen“, sagte die Verantwortliche von „Screens in Motion“, Marion Sperlich, der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Berlin. Sie ist zugleich Head of Research Market Media Insights im Burda-Verlag.\nTrend zum Abo-Hopping\n„Hier besteht eine zunehmende Sensibilität bei den Streaming-Abonnenten“, erläuterte Sperlich. „Stehen Preis und Nutzung nicht mehr im Verhältnis, das heißt sind zum Beispiel nur noch wenige interessierende Formate verfügbar, wird ein Abo gekündigt und ein neues bei einem anderen Anbieter abgeschlossen. Abo-Hopping könnte man das nennen. Prime Video und Netflix scheinen folglich ihre Nutzer am besten mit ihren Inhalten bei Laune zu halten.“\nDie Mediatheken der Öffentlich-Rechtlichen hätten am Streamingboom der vergangenen Jahre durchaus profitiert, so Sperlich. „Wir wissen, dass die lineare TV-Nutzung zurückgeht, aktuell um 45 Minuten Sehdauer pro Tag im Vergleich zu 2019. Die Mediatheken der Sender allerdings, die im Prinzip die gleichen Inhalte anbieten, werden stärker genutzt. Das heißt, das, was klassisches TV an Sehdauer oder auch Nutzeranteilen verliert, geht nicht allein auf die Streaming-Abo-Anbieter über, sondern auch auf die eigenen Mediatheken.“\nFür „Screens in Motion 2025“ hat das Marktforschungsinstitut YouGov Anfang März rund 2.000 Menschen befragt. Die Studie gilt als repräsentativ für die Bevölkerung ab 14 Jahren mit Onlinezugang in Deutschland.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#6](c6#c-6) El sol tiene, entre otros, un ciclo de actividad de 11 años aproximadamente en el que pasa de una actividad minima a una máxima. Ahora estamos en actividad máxima. Aparte de eso las auroras son provocadas por una eyección de masa coronal, pero estas eyecciones (llamadas CME) han de ir dirigidas a la tierra para que aparezcan las auroras, y muchas veces no vienen en nuestra dirección o nos dan de refilón.... y hay otros datos como la polaridad de la CME que tambien influye. En resumen: aparecen por una combinación de actividad solar y suerte que haga que vengan en nuestra dirección. Las dos de este año visibles desde españa no son algo excepcional, aunque si poco frecuente.\n[#19](c19#c-19) Es excepcional que se vean, porque cada once años hay unas pocas y tiene que coincidir que no haya nubes.\nLas de ayer, en Galicia:\n[#45](c45#c-45) Seguro que hay muchos más. P. ej. https://www.gciencia.com/medioambiental/o-ceo-galego-tinguese-de-rosa-asi-foi-a-nova-e-espectacular-aurora-boreal/\n[#12](c12#c-12) y yo que pensaba que \"sin precendentes\" era sinónimo de excepcional...\n[#12](c12#c-12) desde mi humilde ignorancia, yo no recuerdo que en otros máximos solares haya habido auroras boreales tan al Sur.... hay registros de la última vez que ocurrió en España...?\n[#1](c1#c-1) o a Perro Sanxe, a Irene Montero, a rayos laser judios del espacio…\n[#1](c1#c-1) tranquilo ya lo achacan a la geoingieneria\n[#1](c1#c-1) ¿A qué se puede deber?. Realmente me choca que haya auroras boreales en estas latitudes, pero desconozco si es un hecho que ya se ha registrado en el pasado (en el pasado reciente, con registros rigurosos, no en escritos medievales y tal...). Si las auroras son provocadas por el sol, como tengo entendido, ¿qué ha cambiado en ciclo solar que las pueda estar provocando?.\nCuriosidad desde el desconocimiento.\n[#6](c6#c-6) No tiene porque ser solo el sol, el campo magnético de la tierra también cambia y fluctúa.\n[#1](c1#c-1) He visto suficientes películas de desastres como para saber que despues se viene el apocalipsis.\n[#1](c1#c-1) a mi lo que me escama es que el Friker Jiménez que ha dedicado en el pasado programas al \"peligro\" de las tormentas solares haya pasado de puntillas sobre este tema de las auroras boreales tan tan al Sur (cuando ocurrieron por primera vez hace unas semanas y supongo que ahora igual), cuando debería dedicarle un programa entero con ejjjjpertos y teorías a cascoporro... lo que me lleva a pensar que si ni siquiera los \"magufos oficiales\" le prestan atención, es que algo \"gordo\" viene y está aún más tapado que de costumbre....\n[#1](c1#c-1) Aquí lo tienes\n.\n[#7](c7#c-7) [#9](c9#c-9) [#24](c24#c-24) [#26](c26#c-26) \"Si es bien cierto que las auroras boreales en España en realidad no son improbables, lo que sí es una circunstancia que parece única es que en un mismo año hayamos disfrutado de dos espectáculos similares. \"\nParece que a lo que se refiere es que no hay precedentes de que hayan ocurrido dos veces en un mismo año... pero vete tú a saber...\n[#9](c9#c-9) a esto venía\n[#35](c35#c-35) Perdón, no entré a ver los tuits de la noticia. Hablaba por tuits que vi por la mañana al despertar. Con fotos y comentarios que hablaban de las 04:00... Pero bueno, era broma. Si sé a ciencia cierta que va a haber semejante espectáculo estoy despierto yo y hasta despierto a mi hija de cinco años para que lo vea.\n[#39](c39#c-39) Los cometas si no se ven muy bien a simple vista no me llaman tanto la atención. Recuerdo de joven, allá por el ¿96?, el Hale-Bopp que se veía a enorme a simple vista. Aquello si que era un espectáculo...\nY hará 10 años hice mis pinitos de astrofotografía con un telescopio Dobson y la reflex... cómo mola fotografiar tus propias galaxias\nIgual el problema es que ya no tengo telescopio y los últimos cometas los he visto con prismáticos. Sacar fotos del cometa con un telescopio+reflex igual si que era interesante... pero esa afición ya pasó. Ya no hay tiempo para ir de noche a pasar frío jejeje\n[#17](c17#c-17) mmm... no.\n[#17](c17#c-17) No.\n[#17](c17#c-17) Antes comamos unos gambones al vapor.\nEn España lo tenemos todo para el turista. A partir del 2024 incluimos auroras boreales en el catálogo.\nEsto el Ministerio de Igualdad lo iguala rápido.\neso es culpa de los aviones que nos fumigan",

    "text": "IT之家 4 月 3 日消息，谷歌旗下的人工智能笔记应用 NotebookLM 推出了一项令人眼前一亮的新功能 ——“发现资料”（Discover sources），这一功能的上线有望极大地提升学生和研究人员在资料收集方面的效率。\n以往，用户在使用 NotebookLM 时，需要手动添加 PDF 文件、谷歌文档或幻灯片、网站链接、YouTube 视频链接或粘贴文本等资料，才能使用该应用的诸如音频概览（Audio Overviews）和思维导图（Mind Maps）等功能。然而，如今情况发生了改变。\nIT之家注意到，谷歌通过其官方博客 The Keyword 宣布了这一新功能。借助 Gemini 技术的支持，NotebookLM 能够为用户自动搜索网络上的资料，从而节省用户手动查找资料的时间和精力。用户只需打开一个新笔记本或现有的笔记本，在资料面板中，除了传统的“添加资料”按钮外，现在还会看到一个“发现资料”按钮。\n点击该按钮后，会出现一个带有“您感兴趣的是什么？”提示的文本框。用户只需在文本框中描述自己想要查找的内容，越具体越好，然后点击提交按钮。NotebookLM 将在几秒钟内搜索数百个潜在的网络资源，对它们进行分析，并根据用户的话题筛选出最相关的资料。最终，它会整理出一份最多包含 10 个推荐资料的列表，并附上解释其相关性的摘要。用户可以勾选想要导入笔记本的资料，然后点击导入按钮。\n此外，用户还可以像往常一样在 NotebookLM 中使用这些资料，无论是生成音频概览、思维导图、常见问题解答（FAQs）、问答（Q&As）、快速摘要，还是提问等。对于那些想要随机学习新知识的用户，NotebookLM 还提供了一个“好奇心驱动”（I'm feeling curious）按钮，它可以随机生成一个主题的资料。\n谷歌在博客中提到，这只是 NotebookLM 利用 Gemini 收集相关资料功能系列中的第一个。这一新功能从即日起开始向所有 NotebookLM 用户推出，预计将在一周内全面上线。\n尽管有人可能会担心 NotebookLM 可能会出现信息“幻觉”（即生成不准确或虚假的信息），但目前来看，这一问题尚未出现。无论如何，这一新功能的推出无疑是 NotebookLM 在提升用户体验和功能实用性方面迈出的一大步，也让人们对其未来的发展充满期待。",
