    "text": "London: A British Sikh senior medical professional with over 30 years of general practice (GP) experience has been knighted by King Charles III in the 2024 New Year Honours list released in London on Friday night.\nDr Amritpal Singh Hungin, Emeritus Professor of General Practice at Newcastle University, receives a Knighthood for services to medicine on a list including nearly 30 Indian-origin healthcare professionals, philanthropists and community activists honoured for their selfless service to society. Professor Pali Hungin, as he is known, was the founding Dean of Medicine at Durham University and a former president of the British Medical Association (BMA).\n“The New Year’s Honours List recognises the exceptional achievements of people across the country and those who have shown the highest commitment to selflessness and compassion,” said British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n“To all honourees, you are the pride of this country and an inspiration to us all,” he said.\nThe list, released annually by the government’s Cabinet Office in the name of the British monarch, includes Commanders of the Order of the British Empire (CBEs) for Staffordshire GP Dr Chandra Mohan Kanneganti for services to General Practice and Senior Clinical Fellow of Imperial College London Dr Mala Rao for services to public Health, the National Health Service (NHS), and to equality and diversity. Also receiving the prestigious CBE honour is Bidesh Sarkar, Chief Financial Officer at the Department for Business and Trade, for public service.\n“This year’s New Year Honours List celebrates the most selfless, compassionate people in the UK. I send them all my warmest congratulations for what they have achieved,” said UK Deputy Prime Minister and Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden.\n“Our historic honours system exists to recognise these people and shine a light on their heroic contributions and achievements. I hope that the inspiring stories from across the whole of the UK encourage more people to nominate others for an honour in future,” he said.\nAmong the British Indian Officers of the Order of the British Empire (OBEs) include Baldev Parkash Bhardwaj for services to the community in Oldbury, West Midlands; Dr Dipankar Datta, Chair of the South Asia Voluntary Enterprise, for services to charity; Munir Patel, CEO of XRAIL Group, for services to rail exports; Dr Shriti Pattani, President of the Society of Occupational Medicine, for services to occupational health; Rajwinder Singh, Principal Project Sponsor of the Prison Infrastructure Team at the UK’s Ministry of Justice, for public service; Vinaichandra Guduguntla Venkatesham, CEO of Arsenal Football Club, for services to sport.\nThe Cabinet Office said more than 1,200 recipients have been awarded this year for their exceptional achievements, including Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBEs) conferred upon a cross-section including British Indians such as Dr Sanjay Bhandari, Chair of anti-racism charity Kick It Out for services to sport and Jayshree Rajkotia, Trustee and Vice Chair of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan UK, for services to Indian culture.\nOther Indian-origin recipients of MBEs include: Tajinder Kaur Banwait for services to business and to the beauty industry; Dr Manav Bhavsar for services to healthcare, particularly during Covid-19; Nilesh Bhasker Dosa for services to social equality; Dr Dinendra Singh Gill for services to pre-hospital and trauma care in Wales; Dr Gian Parkash Gopal for services to the Hindu community and to multi-faith Cohesion in Oxfordshire; Jasdeep Hari Bhajan Singh Khalsa for charitable services to the Sikh community; Dr Meenakshi Nagpaul for services to the NHS; and Satish Manilal Parmar for public service, among others. Healthcare and charity work also dominates among the Indian-origin Medallists of the Order of the British Empire (BEMs) such as Chandra Shekhar Biyani for services to medical education and Harbaksh Singh Grewal for services to charity.\nAmong the other high honours for 2024, Hollywood filmmaker Ridley Scott is made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire for his services to the UK film industry and Welsh singer Shirley Bassey – made a Dame by the late Queen Elizabeth II – becomes the 64th living member of the Order of the Companion of Honour in recognition of her services to music.\n“This is in recognition of Dame Shirley’s remarkable career which has seen her sell more than 135 million records,” the Cabinet Office said.\n“Individuals have been recognised for being dedicated community champions, role models in sport, pioneers in the arts, passionate health workers, and supporters of young people. The Prime Minister is committed to ensuring that honours are awarded to people across the whole of the UK, so that the honours system captures and celebrates the fantastic contribution of people throughout the country,” it added.\nOf the total, 66 per cent of the recipients are people who have undertaken outstanding work in their communities either in a voluntary or paid capacity and 48 per cent are women.\n(This report has been published as part of an auto-generated syndicated wire feed.

    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Doctors' offices, hospitals and urgent care facilities are being bombarded with patients. \"We commonly see at least a tripling of the rates of these respiratory illnesses after holiday gatherings, said Dr. Ethan Blocher-Smith, a primary care physician at IU Health. Dr. Blocher-Smith says he sees anyone from adults to kids. \"We've seen a sizable number of older adults coming in with COVID, influenza, and RSV. Typically, with fevers, chills, sometimes nausea, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, congestion,\" said Dr. Blocher-Smith. Dr. Chris Ross works for the [Community Health Network](https://www.ecommunity.com/) in the Emergency Room. He says not only does the ER see an influx of patients during the holidays, but this year he's seeing patients with multiple respiratory illnesses simultaneously. \"We're seeing some patients with flu and COVID and some patients with the flu and RSV. It's really a smattering of everything at this point in time. It's in all ages of patients. We've seen older patients with a couple different viruses at one time, we've seen younger patients with more than one virus at a time,\" said Dr. Ross. As for those thinking about going to the ER to get treated for your respiratory infection, Dr. Ross says you may be waiting awhile to see somebody. \"After going through triage, they're sorted into a certain category that is not able to get them back to the room quite as quickly because we have other sicker patents that are back,\" said Dr. Ross. Both Dr. Blocher-Smith and Dr. Ross recommends staying home this New Years Eve if you're feeling sick. This way you can stop the spread, all while waking up in the New Year feeling better.",

    "text": "Skip to content\nPhilly just had its rainiest calendar day since June 5 and broke century-old record\nMost of the rain, which set a record for the date, fell in a three-hour period with tropical storm-worthy downpours.\nThat the region will remain in deep states of drought when the national drought maps are posted Thursday morning is a done deal, but on Wednesday Philly had its rainiest calendar day since June 5, according to the National Weather Service, and broke a 105-year-old record.\nAs of 7 p.m., 1.54 inches of rain had been measured at Philadelphia International Airport, with most of that coming between 3 and 6 p.m. in tropical storm-worthy downpours. The June 5 total was 1.87 inches.\nThe rains were set off by a potent front that generated gusts past 50 mph, including a 52-mph gust at PHL. Gusts have been frequent visitors these days.\nHowever, wind damage in the region appeared to be minimal, and Peco reported only about 6,500 power outages.\nNo significant flooding was reported, with stream levels way down from months of persistent dryness.\nIn the last 60 days, precipitation throughout the region has been about half of normal.\nIn its most recent national update, posted last Thursday, the inter-agency U.S. Drought Monitor had the entire region in states of “moderate” to “extreme” drought.\nThis was the first precipitation of any kind this month in Philly, and given that the drought maps are drawn on Tuesdays, they shouldn’t change significantly for Southeastern Pennsylvania, Delaware, and South Jersey.\nThus, the rains have had a decided positive side, along with flushing out some of the accumulated road salt.\nThe rain amounts, which eclipsed the 1.40-inch record for the date set in 1920, turned out to be a splash higher than forecast.\nSaid Amanda Lee, a meteorologist in the Mount Holly office, “We’re not going to be complaining about a bit of extra.”",

Enhances Curb Appeal and Property Value\nYour home or business’s exterior is the first thing visitors and potential buyers notice. A clean and well-maintained exterior can instantly enhance curb appeal, giving your property a fresh and welcoming appearance. Pressure washing is one of the most effective ways to remove dirt, grime, algae, and mildew from surfaces like siding, driveways, sidewalks, and decks.\nRegular pressure washing by professionals like Mr. Clean Power Washing LLC can help prevent long-term damage to your property’s exterior, ensuring that your home or business maintains its value over time. If you’re planning to sell, a well-kept exterior can make a strong first impression and increase your property’s value.\n2. Saves You Time and Energy\nPressure washing is not a DIY task that can be done with a garden hose. It requires specialized equipment and knowledge to ensure thorough cleaning without damaging surfaces. Renting or purchasing a pressure washer can be costly, and operating it safely and effectively takes experience.\nHiring a professional pressure washing service in Bel Air saves you time, energy, and the hassle of figuring out how to clean every nook and cranny of your property. At Mr. Clean Power Washing LLC, our experienced technicians have the expertise and tools needed to efficiently clean large areas, freeing you from the hard work and giving you more time to focus on other important tasks.\n3. Protects Your Property from Damage\nNot all surfaces are created equal, and using the wrong pressure or technique can cause significant damage. Wood, vinyl, brick, and concrete all require different levels of care during pressure washing. Improper use of pressure washers can lead to chipped paint, cracked siding, or damaged surfaces.\nWhen you hire professionals like Mr. Clean Power Washing LLC, you can trust that our team understands the nuances of different materials and knows the appropriate pressure levels to use. We take great care to protect your property from any potential harm while delivering superior cleaning results.\n4. Improves Health and Safety\nOver time, mold, mildew, algae, and other contaminants can accumulate on outdoor surfaces. These substances aren’t just unsightly—they can pose health risks, especially for individuals with allergies or respiratory conditions. In addition, slippery surfaces caused by mold or algae growth can become safety hazards, increasing the risk of slips and falls.\nHiring a professional pressure washing service in Bel Air helps remove these harmful contaminants, promoting a healthier environment for your family, employees, or customers. Mr. Clean Power Washing LLC uses eco-friendly cleaning solutions that are tough on grime but safe for your property and the environment.\n5. Prolongs the Life of Your Surfaces\nThe buildup of dirt, mold, mildew, and other debris can gradually break down your property's exterior surfaces. If left untreated, these substances can cause wear and tear, leading to costly repairs or replacements down the line. For example, algae and mold growth can deteriorate wood decks, while dirt buildup on concrete can lead to cracks and erosion.\nRegular pressure washing helps extend the life of your exterior surfaces by keeping them clean and free from damaging contaminants. Mr. Clean Power Washing LLC provides high-quality pressure washing services that help preserve the integrity of your home or business, ensuring you won’t have to invest in expensive repairs in the future.\n6. Eco-Friendly Cleaning Solutions\nAt Mr. Clean Power Washing LLC, we are committed to providing environmentally responsible cleaning solutions. Many DIY pressure washers may use harsh chemicals that can damage your landscaping and pollute local water sources. Our team uses eco-friendly detergents and biodegradable cleaners to remove tough grime and stains without harming the environment.\nThis approach not only ensures your property is thoroughly cleaned but also protects the surrounding ecosystem. You can rest easy knowing that your pressure washing service in Bel Air is being done in a sustainable way.\n7. Convenient and Cost-Effective\nWhile some homeowners may think they can save money by attempting to pressure wash their property themselves, it often ends up being more expensive in the long run. Renting equipment, purchasing cleaning solutions, and spending hours learning how to operate a pressure washer can add up quickly. Not to mention, if you cause any damage to your property during the process, you’ll have additional repair costs.\nHiring Mr. Clean Power Washing LLC ensures that the job is done right the first time, saving you money and stress. Our services are competitively priced, and our team is fully insured, meaning you don’t have to worry about accidents or damages.\n8.
