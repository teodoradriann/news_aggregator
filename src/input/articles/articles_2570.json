    "text": "Male student in Thailand forced to leave teacher exam as he wore female uniform A male student in Thailand, who was forced to leave his teacher license exam because he wore a female uniform, has received a generous outpouring of support after his story went viral.\nThe story has prompted opposition politicians to question whether the Thai government was serious about making Thai society inclusive.\nThe original post, published last Saturday (21 June), has more than 6,400 shares at the time of writing .\nStudent forced to leave exam over female uniform In the post, Charleamchai Dechbamrung said proctors prevented him from completing his exam as his attire did not match his assigned sex at birth.\nThe student, more commonly known by his nickname Tonkhao, claimed the rules only required students to wear formal attire or their university uniform for the exam. It apparently wasn’t specified that students’ attire must match their assigned sex at birth.\nSource: Charleamchai Dechbamrung on Facebook\nTonkhao added that proctors only stepped in 30 minutes after the exam began. “It was a waste of time and opportunity,” the student lamented.\nAccording to the Bangkok Post, Tonkhao is from the faculty of fine and applied arts at Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi (RMUTT) .\nIn a follow-up post published a day later, the student said he is grateful for all the support he received online . His professors are currently helping to assess the options available.\nCriticism over incident In an interview with ThaiPBS, Tonkhao said he still has plans to get his teacher’s license — he will retake the exam in November.\nIn addition to Tonkhao, ThaiPBS also reports that a trans woman was prevented from taking the exam.\nA proctor allegedly prevented the trans woman from entering the exam room, asking the student to buy a pair of pants.\nHowever, because the exam was just about to start, the exam taker did not have enough time to make the purchase.\nExam officials have since apologised for the incident. To further remedy the situation, they said they would revisit the rules to better reflect the values and norms of Thai society. Once accomplished, they will invite the affected examinees to retake the exam.\nSource: คุรุสภา on Facebook. For illustration purposes only.\nMeanwhile, some politicians questioned if such incidents are a violation of citizens’ rights and a hindrance to the country’s growth .\nThere were also questions about whether the Thai government is serious about rights and diversity, or simply interested in portraying an inclusive image.\nAlso read: Same-sex marriage law takes effect in Thailand, hundreds of LGBTQ+ couples register their union\nSame-sex marriage law takes effect in Thailand, hundreds of LGBTQ+ couples register their union\nHave news you must share?

    "text": "East metro firefighter credits thermostat app with saving his home from complete loss after fire The community is rallying around an east metro volunteer firefighter and his family after their home suffered major damage in a fire. But it’s thanks to one piece of technology that likely prevented it from burning to the ground. Matt Lebeis has been a volunteer firefighter for the Lower St. Croix Valley Fire Department for two years now. “I’ve always wanted to do it since I was a small kid,” Lebeis said. But Lebeis and his fiancée, Danielle, never thought they would be the ones needing an emergency response team at their Lake St. Croix Beach home. “It was like looking at a house that wasn’t mine,” Danielle Vinson said. If it weren’t for a thermostat and the app connected to it, Lebeis believes his home would be a total loss. “I had an alert on my phone that said your house is higher than normal,” Lebeis said. “It’s the cheapest peace of mind that I’ve ever bought and I would suggest it for anybody.” Eventually, the app that tracks his thermostat read 131 degrees but no one was home on the evening of March 16. “I was like, ‘I think there might be a fire,'” Lebeis recalled. Lebeis called his fire chief and the crew put out the flames as quickly as they could. Unfortunately, his home still suffered major damage and his family’s two dogs did not survive. “We went on car rides and even the back of my car still has her nose prints on it and it’s hard; I don’t want to wash them out,” Lebeis said. “It was really emotional when it hit you,” Vinson said. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. For now, Lebeis and Vinson, who are getting married in June, are staying in a house nearby. While they’re saddened by what they lost, they’re grateful for all the support. “Everybody is just coming together and it’s truly amazing,” Vinson said. Lebeis and Vinson say it’ll take between six and nine months to rebuild. They do have a [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/lebeis-family) for anyone who’d like to donate.",

    "text": "Tovino Thomas starrer ‘Ajayante Randam Moshanam (ARM)’ continues to run houseful in many centers across the state. The film directed by debutant Jithin Laal, features Tovino Thomas in triple roles. As the film garners appreciation and wins the hearts of the audiences, Basil Joseph has lauded the team’s effort.Basil Joseph, who is a successful director has acted in ‘ARM’ along with his confidant Tovino. In a note shared on Instagram, Basil Joseph recalled how Jithin Laal, the director of ‘ARM’ started off his career with him, and has finally delivered his debut directorial. “ARM is making waves globally, and as someone who has closely followed the journey of these two blessed talents, I couldn’t be more proud. Jithin and I started our filmmaking careers together with short films, and later he joined our direction team for ‘Kunjiramayanam‘ and ’Godha’. I remember him sharing his dreams for ARM during the ‘Godha‘ days back in 2017. Fast forward seven years to 2024, and witnessing his hard work pay off in such a historic way is incredible. I can confidently say, Jithin is here to stay. I’ve seen firsthand the challenges he had to overcome to bring this mammoth of a film to life, especially as his debut. The roadblocks were many, even a day before its release, but his dedication and passion never wavered. His journey proves that genuine effort and perseverance always pay off in the end,” Basil said, lauding the ‘ARM’ director. Basil Joseph was also thrilled to see his friend and frequent collaborator Tovino Thomas acing three roles for the film. “As for Tovi—he absolutely nailed all three avatars: Ajayanan, Kunji Kelu, and Maniyan. But it was Maniyan that truly blew me away, a career-defining performance. The swagger, the intensity—it shows just how much Tovi has grown as an actor. I’m immensely proud to call him my friend and to have witnessed his evolution. Tovi has been Jithin’s strongest pillar throughout this journey, going above and beyond what an actor typically does. Together, they’ve proven once again that hard work pays off. Congrats, guys! There’s so much more to come. Keep making us proud!” he added. 113436713113494047Meanwhile, ‘ARM’ is also making solid numbers at the box office.",
