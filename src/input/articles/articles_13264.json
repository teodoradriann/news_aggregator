    "title": "Poll: Likud crashes to 16 seats, Gantz in the lead | Israel National News - Arutz Sheva",
    "text": "If elections were held today, Israel's leading Likud party would receive only 16 seats. Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid would receive 15 seats, while Benny Gantz would receive 38. A poll by Channel 13 and Camil Fuchs found that Shas would receive nine seats, Otzma Yehudit and Yisrael Beiteinu would receive eight seats a piece, UTJ would receive seven seats, United Arab List six seats, Religious Zionism five, and Meretz and Hadash-Taal would get four each. Both Labor and Balad would not pass the electoral threshold. When divided by blocs, the current coalition would receive 45 seats, while the previous coalition would receive 71, with Hadash-Tal in the middle. If the Likud would be led by former Mossad Director Yossi Cohen, the party would get 23 seats. In this case, National Unity would lose five seats, and Yisrael Beiteinu and Yesh Atid would each lose one. In an additional scenario that was examined, a party led by former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett would receive 15 seats, a party led by Yossi Cohen would receive six, and a merger between Labor and Meretz led by Yair Golan would receive seven. In such a situation, National Unity would drop to 23 seats, the Likud would go down to 15, and Yesh Atid would crash to only ten seats.",

    "title": "Trump won’t rule out revoking access to the abortion pill mifepristone - The Washington Post",
    "text": "Donald Trump suggested in a news conference Thursday that he is open to curbing access to abortion pills through federal regulations, declining to rule out a sweeping move that some antiabortion allies have advocated. A reporter noted that there are ways the federal government could restrict abortion besides a national ban and asked whether Trump would direct his Food and Drug Administration to “revoke access” to mifepristone . Trump did not reject the idea. “Sure, you could, you could do things that will be, would, would supplement,” the GOP presidential nominee said. “Absolutely. … But you have to be able to have a vote, and all I want to do is give everybody a vote.” (Trump has defended his appointments of Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade by saying that the decision allowed states and voters to weigh in on the issue.) Mifepristone is part of a two-drug regimen to end a pregnancy through the first 10 weeks of gestation. Most abortions in the United States are now carried out via medication, and curbing access to mifepristone would be hugely consequential. Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Friday that the former president was not changing his stance. “As President Trump said numerous times during the news conference, the questions being asked were difficult to hear. His position on mifepristone remains the same — the Supreme Court unanimously decided on the issue and the matter is settled,” she said in a statement. But the Supreme Court ruling has no bearing on whether a future administration could restrict mifepristone, and Trump’s comments Thursday could undercut his efforts to distance himself from the hardest-line abortion opponents in his party. He previously rebuffed activists’ pressure to campaign on a national restriction, framing it as a states’ issue, and supported a new GOP platform that angered some antiabortion activists. Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request to clarify his position on mifepristone. Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign has made abortion access a central campaign issue and immediately highlighted Trump’s Thursday comments. Some antiabortion activists have long argued that the federal government’s decades-ago approval of mifepristone was flawed and should be revoked, but such a move would face legal hurdles . Antiabortion groups also say the FDA could place restrictions on the medication — for instance, by reinstating a requirement that patients obtain them in person rather than through the mail. Trump has sent mixed signals on abortion policy throughout his campaign. During his debate this summer with President Joe Biden , Trump was asked if he would “block abortion medication.” “First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it,” Trump said. The court had actually declined to limit access , siding with the Biden administration and manufacturer of mifepristone on the grounds that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue over the issue. In his Thursday news conference, Trump continued his response to the mifepristone question by saying, “There are many things on a humane basis that you can do outside of that, but you also have to give a vote, and the people are going to have to decide.” Trump, a Florida resident, also declined to say how he would vote on a ballot measure that seeks to override the state’s ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. “I think the abortion issue has been very much tempered down,” he said. “I answered, I think, very well in the debate, and it seems to be much less of an issue.” Michael Scherer and Isaac Arnsdorf contributed to this report.

I've tried a few things but can't get the button to come out again. There’s a lot of similar threads so this seems to be a common issue. Has anyone had the same and managed to free it?",

    "text": "El ministro-presidente de la Baja Sajonia, Stephan Weil, junto a los servicios de emergencia trabajando en el río Aller.\nEl servicio meteorológico de Alemania (DWD) informó este viernes (29.12.2023) que se prevén más lluvias torrenciales en algunas zonas del país, como en Renania del Norte-Westfalia y la Baja Sajonia, afectadas ya durante varios días por graves inundaciones.\n“Tenemos una situación muy, muy tensa”, dijo este viernes la Ministra de Interior de Baja Sajonia, Daniela Behrens (del Partido Socialdemócrata o SPD), en la radio Deutschlandfunk. “Casi toda la Baja Sajonia está bajo el agua”, añadió Bahrens, por lo que se han desplegado cerca de 100.000 bomberos y organizaciones de ayuda técnica.\nBehrens añade que “todavía no se vislumbra un alivio”. De hecho, según las previsiones meteorológicas, habrá más lluvias y tormentas en los próximos días, lo que no aliviará la situación, sino que “la agravará en un lugar u otro”, sentenció.\nEn el municipio sajón de Lilienthal, por ejemplo, el ayuntamiento emitió un decreto prohibiendo el uso de fuegos artificiales en Nochevieja y Año Nuevo para proteger a los servicios de emergencia de despliegues adicionales.\nLa situación también es tensa a lo largo de los ríos Aller, Leine y Weser, situados en las partes más meridionales del Estado. Otras partes más céntricas ya estaban inundadas, según el Departamento de Aguas, Costas y Conservación de la Naturaleza (NLWKN, por sus siglas en alemán).\nEl premier de Baja Sajonia, Stephan Weil, declaró el jueves que nunca se habían producido inundaciones de esta magnitud.\n“Los expertos llevan mucho tiempo advirtiendo de que los fenómenos meteorológicos extremos están relacionados con el cambio climático”, dijo.\nEl DWD que remarcó el estado occidental de Renania del Norte-Westfalia sufriría de fuertes precipitaciones durante este viernes y el sábado. No obstante, la situación aquí ha remitido temporalmente, aunque sigue “a un nivel alto”, según el Ministerio de Medio Ambiente.\nEl nivel de las aguas también bajó en el Elba, a su paso por la ciudad oriental de Dresde. El jueves por la tarde, el agua alcanzó los 5,92 metros, justo por debajo de la marca de los 6 metros, lo que hubiese activado el segundo nivel de alerta más alto. El nivel de agua suele alcanzar los 2 metros por esta zona.\naa (dpa,afp)",

These conditions combined with fallen branches and debris on the roads will make travel hazardous.\n“We would also advise motorists to avoid driving through floods. If a road is flooded, do not attempt to drive through it and choose an alternative route, as flood waters can be deeper than they appear. Pavement and road surfaces may also be damaged beneath the flood waters.”\nMotorists are also reminded to be conscious of vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists when driving during bad weather.\nWaterford City and County Council’s severe weather management team is monitoring the situation and Council ground crews are on stand-by to deal with any issues that may arise, such as localised flooding, blocked drains, and gulley overflows.\nMembers of the public can contact Waterford City and County Council’s Customer Services Desks on 0818 10 20 20 during normal office hours, after which calls will be transferred to the Council’s emergency services number.\nWaterford City and County Council has advised the public to:\nStay away from all coastal areas for the duration of the Met Éireann warnings. All road users should be aware of the hazardous travelling conditions, and allow extra time for journeys. The public are warned electricity wires are always live, never approach. If you see fallen or damaged wires, keep clear and phone ESB Networks immediately on 1800 372 999 A Status Yellow wind and rain warning is also in place in Clare, Kerry, Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, and Sligo until 6am, Friday December 29.\nAn additional Status Yellow rainfall warning will also come into place at 6am Friday December 29 for Donegal, Leitrim, North Mayo and Sligo. This warning will then end at 9pm on that evening.\nGet ahead of the day with the morning headlines at 7.30am and Fionnán Sheahan’s exclusive take on the day’s news every afternoon, with our free daily newsletter.",
