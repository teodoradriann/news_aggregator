    "text": "Here’s What DeFi Can Do for You (Yes, You!) [Beth Canova](/en/experts/beth-canova)On December 28, 202304:00 PM Eastern |By Beth Canova| Our week of “how to trade crypto” tutorials continues. So far, we’ve covered how to turn your cash into crypto on [centralized exchanges](https://weissratings.com/en/weiss-crypto-daily/turn-cash-into-crypto-with-centralized-exchanges). And, once you’ve done that, how to set up [soft wallets](https://weissratings.com/en/weiss-crypto-daily/create-your-crypto-keys-in-6-easy-steps) and [hard wallets](https://weissratings.com/en/weiss-crypto-daily/find-extra-security-in-hard-wallets). Once you’ve followed those steps, your next logical move is to dive in to DeFi. Let’s start with the basics: What is DeFi? DeFi — or decentralized finance — is a sector within crypto that aims to remove third parties and centralized institutions from financial transactions. All the platforms and projects in DeFi are currently, or are working to become, noncustodial. For a new DeFi project to even have a hope of succeeding, it must embrace the core crypto ideology of “not your keys, not your crypto.” In short: DeFi allows you access to financial platforms — that offer lending, borrowing, trading, insurance and interest on your crypto — without you ever needing to give your crypto to a third party. This is starkly different to traditional finance and even centralized crypto platforms such as Coinbase or Binance. In those cases, you are required to give it custody of your assets for it can invest or trade on your behalf. In other words, you as an investor need to trust the firm you’re dealing with. DeFi cuts out these middlemen. How? Through smart contracts — algorithms of “if/then” code that run on a blockchain when certain conditions are met. Basically, “if” a condition is met, “then” the code is enacted. The action is then recorded and verified on the blockchain. For example, let’s say you’ve got some Ethereum ( [ETH](https://weissratings.com/en/crypto/coin/eth), “B+”) sitting in your crypto wallet. You’re not planning on selling anytime soon. So, you decide to lend your ETH to a reputable DeFi platform in return for a reward, an act called liquidity providing. When you connect your soft wallet (e.g., [MetaMask](https://weissratings.com/en/weiss-crypto-daily/create-your-crypto-keys-in-6-easy-steps)) and lend your ETH, you enact a smart contract. One that says if there’s an Ethereum transaction on the platform, then you get a percentage of the fees received by that transaction. This happens because you provided the liquidity (your ETH) that allowed the platform to function. The technology is groundbreaking. It has also expanded beyond the DeFi space. Sonoco, a global temperature assurance packaging provider, recently teamed up with IBM. Together, they want to reduce issues in the transport of lifesaving medications. To do so, they see an opportunity to increase supply chain transparency. To this end, they created a smart contract that runs on a blockchain-based platform. It tracks pharmaceuticals through the supply chain to provide trusted, reliable and accurate data across multiple parties. But within the DeFi space, the dedication to decentralization has taken smart contracts in a different direction. Instead of developers maintaining control, DeFi platforms have democratized by delegating decision making to the community. This is commonly done through governance tokens. These provide voting rights to holders, allowing them to participate in governance decisions for a particular protocol or platform. All these developments combine to bring three core benefits to the DeFi space: - Low Fees and High Interest Rates: More efficient and cost-effective financial transactions due to the elimination of third-party intermediaries. - Security and Transparency:Increased transparency due to blockchain technology provides users with a higher level of confidence in their financial activities. - Accessibility: The removal of geographical restrictions means that DeFi operates around the clock, opening new opportunities for financial inclusion and economic empowerment. As you may expect, a brand-new financial sector is going to endure some growing pains along the way. At the time of this writing, the main cons of the DeFi space can be summed up this way ... - Complexity: The complex nature of the elements that make up DeFi can be daunting for less tech-savvy individuals, which could lead to them making costly errors. - Smart-Contract Risks: Smart contracts are just algorithms. These lines of code are only as secure as the coder made them. As such, they can be susceptible to hacks and bugs. - Lack of Protections: The open-source nature of blockchains make hacks incredibly easy to identify quickly. Yet, there is little that can be done once your crypto has been taken. Platforms largely do not have any consumer protection mechanisms in place. If you want to go for the opportunities made possible by DeFi, you’ll need to be mindful of the above detriments to the space. To do that, here are ... 5 Ways to Navigate DeFi Do Your Own Research: Naturally, taking time to vet any DeFi platform you’re interested in should be at the top of your list. And you don’t need to be a tech expert to do this. Read the project documentation and assess the credibility of the team behind it. Usually, these can be found on the project’s main website. Be wary of any platform that isn’t transparent about its tech or team. You can also use platforms like [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/chains) to see the total value locked on each platform. TVL, as it’s called, represents the volume of liquidity locked on a platform. This translates into a measure of usage. Think of TVL like bank deposits. If a bank is attracting deposits, it can earn money by lending or investing that money. If deposits are declining, then the opposite is true — the bank can’t lend as much, leading to less income. If a DeFi platform has a large TVL, then it gives the impression that it is a secure platform, trusted by crypto investors. Update Your Software: Developers often release updates to address security vulnerabilities and improve performance. So, keeping your wallet software and browser extensions up to date is important for interacting with DeFi. Stay Informed: The DeFi space is dynamic, and new risks and opportunities arise regularly. Most platforms have an X — formerly Twitter — account, Reddit account or an online blog they use to update the community of any pressing news or developments. You can also always check in with us here at Weiss Crypto Daily. Like with the Ledger hack two weeks ago (where the remedy was as simple as [clearing your cache](https://weissratings.com/en/weiss-crypto-daily/immediate-action-required-temporary-suspension-of-all-wallet-activities)), we’ll let you know what to do as soon as we can. Beware of Scams: While this is good advice in general, phishing attacks are particularly common in DeFi. Treat any unsolicited emails, texts or messages with caution. Double-check the sender’s name and the URLs of any links before clicking them. And when in doubt, don’t click at all. And remember: Anyone who asks for your [wallet seed phrase](https://weissratings.com/en/weiss-crypto-daily/create-your-crypto-keys-in-6-easy-steps) or prompts you to fill it in yourself is a scammer. Diversify Your Portfolio: Just like in TradFi, making sure you don’t have all your eggs in one basket can go a long way in insulating you from harm in the DeFi space. Use multiple platforms to go for more opportunities and spread any risk exposure across multiple assets or platforms. That will reduce the potential impact of a security breach or loss on your overall portfolio. Arm yourself with the knowledge and tips above. And I’ll come back tomorrow to cover some of the most popular DeFi platforms and how you can use them to further your crypto goals. Best, Beth Canova Crypto Managing Editor",

    "text": "Un important mouvement de grève à l'usine Girpi d'Harfleur, près du Havre\nPublié le\n90% des salariés de l'usine Girpi à Harfleur, dans l'agglomération havraise sont en grève depuis le 26 mars. Ils dénoncent la décision du groupe qui possède l'usine de ne pas leur verser de prime cette année, une première.\nLa très grande majorité des 154 salariés de l'usine Girpi d'Harfleur dans l'agglomération du Havre sont en grève. Le groupe belge Aliaxis, leader dans la production de systèmes de tuyauterie et raccords en PVC et qui possède le site normand, a annoncé mercredi 26 mars que les salariés n'obtiendraient pas de prime d'intéressement sur les bénéfices cette année. Depuis des décennies, les salariés recevaient une prime de l'ordre de 4.000 euros.\nL'annonce a été faite mercredi 26 mars en début de matinée. Immédiatement, les salariés ont décidé de se mettre en grève, depuis ils tiennent un piquet devant les grilles de l'usine, cette dernière est à l'arrêt. \"Cette prime est très importante pour nous, rappelle Tony Foubert, représentant Force ouvrière sur site. Ça fait 20 ans que je travaille ici, et chaque année je reçois cette prime, elle est entièrement intégrée dans mon budget annuel\".\nUne prime qui récompense le travail\nLe syndicaliste ajoute : \"cette prime c'est aussi ce qui nous motive à aller au travail. Nous avons accepté de travailler les samedis, par exemple. Nous la retirer c'est ne pas récompenser nos efforts\".\nLa direction du site a expliqué aux salariés que les résultats de l'entreprise étaient moins bons en 2024 que les années précédentes, \"mais elle n'est pas non plus en faillite\", s'indigne Tony Fourbet. L'intersyndicale regroupant FO, la CGT et la CFDT a tenté de négocier une prime moitié moins conséquente, sans obtenir satisfaction pour le moment. Le mouvement de grève devrait reprendre lundi 1er avril.\nSur le même thème\nL'ensemble du personnel de Lubrizol appelé à la grève à partir de ce jeudi sur les sites de Rouen et d'OudalleRouenL'intersyndicale appelle à une grève illimitée sur les sites normands de Lubrizol, à Rouen et à Oudalle, à partir de ce jeudi. Les syndicats dénoncent une situation \"intolérable\", alors que le plan de sauvegarde de l'emploi (PSE) est en discussion avec la direction du géant de la chimie.\nÉolien en mer : l'usine Siemens Gamesa du Havre produira des turbines plus puissantes pour concurrencer la ChineLe HavreLe ministre de l'Industrie était au Havre ce lundi 17 février, pour poser la première pierre du chantier d'agrandissement de l'usine d'éoliennes en mer Siemens Gamesa. Y seront produites les pales \"parmi les plus longues au monde\", dans le but de rivaliser avec la Chine.\nCrise de l'industrie automobile : Renault Sandouville, près du Havre, réduit son activité, 300 intérimaires remerciésSandouvilleLors d'une réunion ce lundi 24 février, la direction de l'usine Renault à Sandouville (Seine-Maritime) a annoncé voir à la baisse sa production pour 2025, indique le syndicat Force ouvrière. À partir du 17 mars, l'activité sera réduite, et 300 intérimaires non reconduits.\nÀ Lubrizol, les syndicats se mettent en ordre de bataille, une semaine après l'annonce du plan socialRouenUne semaine après l'annonce par Lubrizol d'un plan social sur ses usines de Rouen et du Havre, une petite centaine de personnes s'est réunie devant le site rouennais à l'appel de la CGT ce jeudi. Entre colère, angoisse, et incompréhension, ils organisent leur lutte à venir.",

    "text": "Young students at Monroe Elementary School cheered as they opened shoe boxes on Wednesday morning.\nStarting with TK-kindergarten, each and every student at Monroe received a shiny new pair of kicks. It was all thanks to national nonprofit Shoes That Fit, partnering with Santa Barbara Steps Up for Monroe, a fundraiser created by longtime Shoes That Fit supporters and Santa Barbara residents Liisa and Andrew Primack.\nStudents opened up their shoe boxes all at the same time. | Credit: Callie Fausey Shoes That Fit was founded about 30 years ago in Claremont, starting with a teacher, Elodie McGuirk, who recognized that students were coming to class with shoes that were too small, or broken or full of holes, explained Liisa Primack, who moved from Claremont to Santa Barbara in 2021.\nPrimack has been supporting the cause since noticing a bulletin board at her local bakery in Claremont, which would list a student’s name, their age, their shoe size, and their favorite color to encourage people to buy shoes for kids in need. She would go with her family to the bakery, pick out a couple of kids, buy the shoes, and bring them back to the bakery, which would send them to Shoes That Fit to be given out to the kids that needed them.\n“Like Santa Barbara, Claremont is an affluent town, but there is a lot of poverty within it that you don’t really see,” Primack said.\nNow, Shoes That Fit partners with multiple brands and donors. Last year, the nonprofit gave away nearly one million shoes to kids across 30 states. More than 300 students at Monroe — a small school with a socioeconomically disadvantaged population of 72 percent — joined that cohort on Wednesday.\n“We moved to Santa Barabra, and we thought, ‘We need to do something for Santa Barbara,’ so this is where we landed,” Primack said. “This seemed like a good place to start. Since a lot of people don’t know about Shoes That Fit, it was about bringing awareness so we can build on the program now.”\nSupervisor Laura Capps gives a student her new pair of shoes. | Credit: Callie Fausey Each student received a personal pair of shoes based on their shoe size and preferred style. | Credit: Callie Fausey A volunteer gives a student a new pair of shoes. | Credit: Callie Fausey The fundraiser’s organizer Liisa Primack hands off a new pair of shoes to a happy student. | Credit: Callie Fausey A Monroe kindergarten class made a “Thank You” sign for Shoes that Fit. | Credit: Callie Fausey County supervisor Laura Capps talked to the crowd of TK and kindergarten students before they got new shoes on Wednesday morning. | Credit: Callie Fausey Mayor Randy Rowse spoke to the gymnasium full of students getting new shoes on Wednesday morning. | Credit: Callie Fausey Volunteers, organizers, and local officials all helped distribute shoes to the students on Wednesday. | Credit: Callie Fausey Most Read Recent News Car-mageddon Hits Highway 101 in Santa Barbara County By Callie Fausey | Tue Nov 26, 2024 When Is an E-Bike Street Legal or Not?

    "text": "Unos 250 migrantes, entre ellos venezolanos, salen en caravana hacia EEUU desde Honduras\nFreddy Sánchez caminó junto a su familia durante horas bajo un sol abrasador hasta entrar a territorio estadounidense gracias a una brecha en la frontera en el desierto californiano, apenas un día después de que el presidente Joe Biden anunciara nuevas restricciones migratorias.\n“Aunque digan que cierren fronteras, nunca se va a poder cerrar porque quiera o no, es una fuente de trabajo para muchas personas”, dijo Sánchez, uno de los tantos que llegaron en busca de asilo el miércoles a la pequeña comunidad de Jacumba Hot Springs, en la frontera entre Estados Unidos y México.\nEl hombre de 37 años, que viajó durante semanas por tierra desde su natal Guatemala, escuchó sobre cambios en la frontera el mismo martes, la víspera de cruzar hacia Estados Unidos.\n“Lo pensé y me desanimé. Pero con la misma dije ‘No, en el nombre de Dios vamos a llegar’. Y aquí estamos, más dentro que fuera”, afirmó.\nAlex Román, un colombiano de 31 años quien cruzó a través del mismo penoso y desértico camino que Sánchez y su familia, también escuchó sobre el decreto cuando estaba del lado mexicano.\n“Pues había que sacarlo adelante. Porque todo el dinero que se invierte para venir a esta tierra … como para ¿devolverse sin intentarlo?”, refirió.\nA los pies del muro, unos 80 migrantes de India, China, Honduras, Nicaragua, Turquía, República Dominicana y Jordania aguardaban por una oportunidad de defender sus casos.\n– “Nada ha cambiado” –\nBiden firmó el martes un decreto ejecutivo para impedir la entrada a los migrantes en busca de asilo que intentan cruzar fuera de los puertos oficiales fronterizos, en un intento de neutralizar las críticas a su gestión.\nEl número de cruces ilegales a lo largo de la frontera de 3.050 kilómetros alcanzó nuevos récords durante su gobierno, llegando a totalizar 10.000 en un único día en diciembre del año pasado, algo que los republicanos atacan sin cesar.\nLa cifra ha disminuido en los últimos meses, pero el tema es amargo para Biden, en busca de la reelección, al tiempo que la campaña de su rival Donald Trump, centrada en un mensaje antimigratorio, gana adeptos con la promesa de deportar a millones y reforzar la frontera.\nLa medida anunciada por el presidente demócrata le permitiría “suspender la entrada” de migrantes cuando el promedio diario de aprehensiones supere las 2.500 durante una semana consecutiva.\nEsta cifra es inferior al promedio diario desde febrero de 2021, destacó el martes Adam Isacson, especialista en migración del centro de estudios Oficina en Washington para Asuntos Latinoamericanos, por lo que la medida debería entrar en efecto de inmediato.\nSin embargo, no se notaban cambios el miércoles en Jacumba Hot Springs.\n“Nada ha cambiado”, dijo bajo anonimato un oficial de la patrulla fronteriza tras contabilizar las decenas de migrantes que se agolpaban a la espera de pasar a los centros de procesamiento.\nEl miércoles fue un día más en la frontera: unos 4.000 migrantes fueron aprehendidos por las autoridades de acuerdo con datos extraoficiales citados por medios estadounidenses.\n– “Tierra prometida” –\nBiden, quien enfrentará una reñida revancha a Trump por la Casa Blanca, ha sido fuertemente criticado por la medida, una de las más restrictivas en materia migratoria impulsada por un demócrata.\nEl decreto se asemeja a uno que Trump emitió en 2018, cuando era presidente, y que fue bloqueado en la justicia gracias a una demanda de la ONG Unión Estadounidense por las Libertades Civiles, que también prevé ir a los tribunales contra la acción de Biden.\nUna de las diferencias es que el decreto contempla excepciones para casos como el de menores sin compañía de adultos.\nEl miércoles, dos adolescentes provenientes de Jordania cruzaron solos a Estados Unidos.\n“Sus padres se quedaron en México”, dijo una voluntaria que asistió a los jóvenes con comida y agua mientras aguardaban por la patrulla fronteriza.\n“Venían juntos pero a última hora, asustados por el decreto decidieron no cruzar y enviarlos a ellos. Su tío vive aquí”, dijo la mujer quien conversó con los hermanos.\nA la distancia otro grupo de migrantes de Colombia y Perú llegaban caminando, exhaustos, tras cruzar a través de otra brecha en el imponente muro fronterizo, el cual las personas utilizaban para amarrar trapos y protegerse del sol cuando el termómetro se aproximaba a los 40ºC.\nPara los migrantes, muchos de los cuales relatan torturas, amenazas y todo tipo de calamidades económicas en sus países de origen, no hay decreto u obstáculo físico que los desaliente de buscar suerte en el norte.\n“Aquí hay gente de muchísimos países (…) es una cuestión a nivel mundial”, dijo Alex Román.\n“Yo creo que es algo de nunca acabar, porque pues para todo mundo, Estados Unidos, es el sueño americano, nuestra tierra prometida”.

FOTO DE ARCHIVO-Amigos y familiares lloran a Alon Lulu Shamriz, uno de los tres rehenes israelíes que fueron abatidos por error por el ejército israelí mientras estaban secuestrados en Gaza por el grupo islamista palestino Hamás, en su funeral en Shef Por Emily Rose\nJERUSALÉN, 28 dic (Reuters) - Las tropas israelíes mataron a tres rehenes en Gaza el 15 de diciembre porque confundieron sus gritos de auxilio con una treta de militantes de Hamás para hacerles caer en una emboscada, dijo el jueves el Ejército, concluyendo que los soldados actuaron correctamente.\nEl Ejército asumió inmediatamente la responsabilidad por la muerte de los tres rehenes, secuestrados por militantes durante el ataque de Hamás del 7 de octubre contra ciudades del sur de Israel.\nLa fuerza concluyó en su reporte \"que no hubo malicia en el suceso, y los soldados llevaron a cabo la acción correcta según su mejor comprensión del suceso en ese momento\".\nEl comunicado dijo que el jefe del Ejército, el general Herzi Halevi, enfatizó en la importancia de respetar los procedimientos operativos estándar.\n\"En una situación en la que no existe una amenaza inmediata y no se ha identificado a un enemigo claro, es necesario un momento para examinar lo que ocurre antes de disparar\", sostuvo.\nLa muerte de los tres rehenes cuando se acercaban a las tropas israelíes en la zona de Shejaiya, en la ciudad de Gaza, conmocionó a los israelíes.\nEl Ejército declaró que las imágenes mostraron que los rehenes se habían quitado la camisa y que uno de ellos ondeaba una bandera blanca, pero que recién fueron identificados como rehenes tras examinar sus cuerpos.\nSus gritos de auxilio fueron malinterpretados como un engaño de los militantes que intentaban atraer a las tropas hacia una emboscada.\n\"Las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel fracasaron en su misión de rescatar a los rehenes\", dijo Halevi. \"Toda la cadena de mando se siente responsable de este suceso, lamenta este desenlace y comparte el dolor de las familias de los tres rehenes\".\n(Reporte de Emily Rose; editado en español por Javier Leira)\nReporte dice que soldados israelíes mataron a rehenes al confundir gritos de auxilio con emboscada",
