    "title": "The Brothers Sun's Churros Obsession Explained and Why It Matters",
    "text": "Netflix's [The Brothers Sun](/article/the-brothers-sun-cast) is catching fans' eyes, and not for it thrilling plot alone. Viewers are also interested in the churros, because Brothers Sun features a lot of them. Charles Sun: Hitman or Baker? [The Brothers Sun](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/81389634) TV series follows Charles Sun (Justin Chien), a hitman from Taipei who has settled into a ruthless life. When his father is assassinated, however, Charles must move to L.A. to protect his mother ( [Michelle Yeoh](/article/michelle-yeoh-net-worth-see-the-success-of-the-everything-everywhere-all-at-once-star)) and younger brother (Sam Song Li). Already from the trailer, it is evident that The Brothers Sun is full of action and conflict. However, fans are also interested in the quieter scenes, particularly the ones that reveal the passionate baker hidden behind Charles' ruthless assassin persona. Explaining Charles' Churros in Brothers Sun Throughout The Brothers Sun TV series Charles is often seen cooking, baking, or appreciating food. One scene in particular sticks out for fans as it really gave them a craving for churros, full with the sweet crunch you would expect when eating one! After encountering churros for the first time at the college his brother Bruce attends, Charles becomes increasingly interested in the tasty treat. Charles explains that, to him, churros are a bit like cinnamon sugar youtiao, and many fans loved this description. Charles' interest in churros and baking more generally adds to his characterization, showing that he isn't just any hitman from any gangster movie. In fact, he would much rather spend his time perfecting his churros recipe instead of killing. So What Is Youtiao? Youtiao is a popular flour-based Chinese treat that many consider as an [anscestor to churros](https://umamidays.com/youtiao-ancestor-churros/). Like churros, youtiao are long strips of deep-fried dough. That being said, a youtiao consists of two braided strips of dough, so the recipe is a bit different from churros' characteristic shape. Moreover, youtiao is typically savory. Regardless, fans of deep-fried dough treats are likely to love both. The Deeper Meaning of Churros in The Brothers Sun At its heart, The Brothers Sun tackles the culture clash between the East and the West. In this context, churros can become a metaphor of Charles' conflict, especially if their similarties to youtiao are taken into account. Food is often an element that brings people from different cultures together, helping them appreciate their differences but also recognize possible similarities. Charles' love for churros could symbolize his gradual opening up to American culture without this meaning that he lets go of his own traditions. After all, Charles also perfects other baked goods, including [Chinese pineapple cakes](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/the-brothers-sun-release-date-photos)!

Après avoir licencié 34 personnes en 2023 dans le cadre d'une première restructuration, qui faisait suite à la fermeture de l'atelier mécanique et de carrosserie du site, la société basée dans le zoning de Ghislenghien doit encore se séparer de plusieurs membres de son personnel.\nSi en octobre, on évoquait le départ de vingt personnes (17 ouvriers et trois employés), ce seront finalement quinze personnes qui quitteront la société prochainement. Cette décision fait suite à la non-reconduction d'un contrat historique par le principal client de l'entreprise, à savoir Stellantis, qui représente à lui seul 60 % du volume de travail de toute l'entreprise. Le contrat s'est clôturé le 31 octobre dernier.",

    "text": "Keep Newton Beautiful (KNB) and Newton County Commissioners are sponsoring a series of District Cleanups in our community. The next cleanups are coming up soon, and KNB is seeking volunteers to help pick up roadside litter. The District 1 Cleanup will kick off at Alcovy High School on Saturday, October 12. KNB encourages individuals, families, civic clubs, scout troops and business, church, neighborhood, school, and other groups to organize volunteers to participate. Volunteers will meet at 9 a.m. for free breakfast and pick up of supplies and t-shirts. Then groups will go out to clean up trash in neighborhoods and on roadsides near the school. The next cleanup in the series will be the District 4 Cleanup on Saturday, October 26 at 9 a.m. at Springhill Park. The cleanup will work in the same way with volunteers getting t-shirts, breakfast, and supplies at the park and then heading out to pick up roadside litter. Event details are posted on the KNB website (www.keepnewtonbeautiful.org). “Having cleanup volunteers working along roadsides in Newton County brings greater awareness to the necessity of litter prevention. We greatly appreciate their willingness to devote time to make a positive impact and improve our community,” said Laurie Riley, KNB Manager. KNB welcomes everyone to participate in cleanup events. Children under 12 years old must be supervised by responsible adults. Children will work away from busy roads in safe locations such as parks and playgrounds. Every event participant will be required to sign a release form. Keep Newton Beautiful representatives will sign volunteer hour forms for students and others who are completing required community service. Keep America Beautiful studies show people litter more in areas already littered because they believe no one cares. KNB’s educational programs teach that an important step to a litter-free community is to clean up any trash already on the ground. Then commit to never litter. Next, teach others the importance of properly disposing of trash to improve health and safety, increase property values, and beautify surroundings. The last and most important step is to show you care by taking responsibility to keep your community clean and continuing to spread the word about the necessity of litter prevention. KNB visits schools, civic clubs, and other groups with litter prevention, beautification, recycling, and water pollution prevention programs and sponsors related community events. The organization’s goal is to inspire positive behavior change through acceptance of personal responsibility. Its mission is to challenge, motivate, and inspire everyone to take responsibility for a clean and beautiful community. After groups participate in District Cleanups, KNB encourages them to “Adopt-a-Mile”. A sign is erected recognizing the efforts of groups that commit to clean up litter 4 times per year along one mile of road or street. For more information, visit KNB’s website: www.keepnewtonbeautiful.org, send email to lriley@co.newton.ga.us, or call 770-784-2015.",
