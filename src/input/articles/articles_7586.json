    "text": "Two Tunisian-born brothers and a third Iraqi man are to face trial at Preston Crown Court on 7 October 2025, to answer terrorism-related charges, some of which was directed at the Jewish community in Manchester.\nWalid Saadaoui, 36, and Amar Hussein, 50, are accused of preparing acts of terrorism between 13 December 2023 and 9 May this year. Walid’s brother, Bilel Saadaoui, 35, is charged with failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism.\nOn Friday 24 May, after an initial hearing two weeks ago at Westminster Magistrates, the three men appeared by videolink from custody at Wormwood Scrubs Prison, for a hearing at London’s Central Criminal Court (the Old Bailey) in front of Mr Justice Jeremy Baker.\nProsecutor Jocelyn Ledward KC said that Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein had planned “an Isis or Daesh-inspired terrorist attack in the UK”, with the alleged intent “to cause multiple fatalities using automatic guns. The main targets of the attack plans were the Jewish community in the north-west of England, members of law enforcement and military”. Ms Ledward said that the prosecution alleged that the men “took significant steps to prepare for that attack”, which included the alleged “purchase and delivery of firearms”.\nThe trial, beginning in autumn next year, is anticipated to last in the region of 12 weeks. A detailed timetable of further hearings this year was agreed by the court.\nWalid Saadaoui, of Crankwood Road, Abram, Wigan, Bilel Saadaoui, of Fairclough Street, Hindley, Wigan, and Amar Hussein, of no fixed abode, spoke to confirm their identities during the hearing. The Saadaoui brothers were represented by barristers Irfan Arif and Nadesh Karu; Amar Hussein has so far chosen to represent himself.\nThe defendants were further remanded into custody.\n ",

    "text": "By Solange Reyner | Friday, 08 August 2025 12:13 PM EDT\nThe FAA is looking to hire 8,900 air traffic controllers through 2028, including 2,000 in 2025, to \"supercharge\" recruitment and retention.\n\"Under President Trump's leadership, the USDOT isn't just solving today's problems. By looking ahead and planning for the future of transportation, we can ensure America remains the global aerospace leader,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a statement.\n\"Putting the best and brightest in our towers and in the field will allow us to make flying safer, reduce delays and cancellations, and bring about a Golden Age of travel.\"\nThe FAA will also initiate a year-round hiring track for experienced controllers from the military and private industry, fill every seat at the FAA Academy and increase classroom capacity, expand the Enhanced Air Traffic – Collegiate Training Initiative, and deploy upgraded tower simulation systems at 95 facilities, the agency said in the release.\nStill, hiring nearly 9,000 air traffic controllers would not solve a nationwide staffing shortage, reports The New York Times.\nThe FAA expects to lose almost 6,900 controllers and trainees over the next three years.\n© 2025 Newsmax.

    "text": "Potential Tropical Cyclone Four formed Friday morning over eastern Cuba and is expected to strengthen into a tropical depression, then a tropical storm, and bring heavy rain and flooding to South Florida over the weekend.\nThe National Hurricane Center said a tropical storm warning is in effect for parts of Southwest Florida from East Cape Sable — at the tip of the Florida Peninsula — north to Bonita Beach.\nIn addition, a tropical storm watch is in effect for parts of the Florida Keys and coastal Southwest Florida. Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast are not under any watches or warnings right now.\ncyclone 2.png The NHC said this wave is expected to develop into a tropical depression on Saturday as it moves across the Straits of Florida, followed by intensification into a tropical storm by Saturday night.\nThe wave has a 70% chance to develop over the next two days and an 90% chance over the next seven. It's expected to move near or over Cuba throughout the day Friday and then emerge over the Straits of Florida tonight or Saturday.\ncyclone 1.png TRACKING THE TROPICS: Hurricane Center | Hurricane Guide\n\"Clouds are bubbling up, indicating thunderstorm activity,\" WPTV First Alert Weather meteorologist Jennifer Correa said. \"But it's still not confined, tight enough that there's a center.\"\nCorrea added that environmental conditions are expected to be conducive to additional development, and a tropical depression is likely to form this weekend over the Straits of Florida or eastern Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Peninsula.\nTropical Disturbance Parts of Palm Beach County are under a \"slight\" risk of excessive rainfall, the second lowest tier, while the rest of our viewing area is under a \"marginal\" risk, the lowest tier.\n\"We are under a risk of excessive rainfall. Basically calling for scattered flash flooding,\" Correa said. \"More than likely, the farther south you are, the heavier or the more accumulated rainfall you'll get.\"\nCorrea said parts of our area could pick up two to five inches of rainfall over the coming days.\nPoster image (2).jpg Correa said the rain and storms will start to ramp up late in the morning on Saturday and continue into Sunday, before eventually clearing out on Monday.\n\"These scattered showers and thunderstorms are gonna come in almost in feeder bands,\" Correa said.\nWATCH: WPTV First Alert Weather forecast\nWPTV First Alert Weather forecast, morning of Aug. 2, 2024 Tropical storm watches or warnings could be issued for portions of Florida later today, Correa said.\nScripps Only Content 2024",

    "title": "Wicklow’s Aldi shoppers returned more than 650,000 items via deposit return scheme last month",
    "text": "June was the most successful month to date for the Deposit Return Scheme (DRS) at Aldi, as shoppers across Ireland collectively returned 16.7 million items. In Wicklow, shoppers returned more than 650,000 items in June, bringing the total number of items returned locally to more than 1.6 million since the launch of the scheme earlier this year. This equates to a total of almost €280,000 in vouchers being issued in Wicklow to date. The top three Aldi stores in Wicklow in terms of returns are Arklow, Bray and Rathnew. The average Aldi store in Wicklow has processed more than 330,000 items since February, worth almost €56,000 in returned deposits. This is well above the national average across all of Aldi’s 161 stores in Ireland, which have handled an average of 264,000 items each since the launch of the scheme, worth almost €45,000 in returned deposits. Aldi DRS units have seen a steady increase in the numbers of items returned since February, as customers become acquainted with the scheme. Under the scheme, empty bottles and cans containers marked with the re-turn logo can be returned to the reverse vending machine at all participating retailers, regardless of where the item was originally purchased. Customers receive a voucher for their returned items, which can be used to reduce their shopping bill or returned in cash. Jason Carolan, Plastics and Packaging Manager at Aldi Ireland, commented: “As we can see from the figures today, the DRS scheme has been very popular with Aldi shoppers, and since going live in February of this year, the number of items being returned on a monthly basis has steadily increased. “Customers have redeemed more than €7 million in cash and vouchers at Aldi’s 161 stores, ensuring that more than 42 million items have been returned for recycling through the scheme. We’re proud to play our part in supporting and operating this scheme, which is a key part of helping to ensure more sustainable and circular economic activity. “We’re sure that it will continue to grow from strength to strength, and we’re excited to see the innovative ways that sports clubs and charitable organisations look to harness its potential.” The scheme aims to reduce the amount of litter across Irish towns, villages and countryside, by incentivising consumers to recycle their empty items. Prior to the introduction of the DRS, Ireland had one of the lowest rates of recycling of PET and aluminium drinks bottles and cans, with approximately only 60pc of all drinks containers being recycled. Similar schemes across Europe have been successful in increasing this number in line with the EU target of 77pc of all drinks containers to be recycled by 2025.

    "title": "Urdu varsity staff members block road in protest over salary and pension delays - Newspaper - DAWN.COM",
    "text": "KARACHI: The ongoing unrest at the Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science, and Technology (FUUAST) intensified on Thursday when a significant number of teachers and non-teaching staff blocked University Road in protest against the prolonged delay in salaries, dues, pensions, and the withdrawal of the rental ceiling allowance. Holding banners and chanting slogans against the university administration, the staff staged a sit-in on the road, causing a traffic jam that lasted for hours. The protest followed a general body meeting at the university’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal campus, where staff members unanimously passed a resolution to boycott academic and administrative work until their demands were met. Retired employees, the teachers said, had been deprived of their pensions for months, while the university administration had decided to withdraw the rental ceiling allowance. They also pointed out that the medical facility for employees had been closed for almost a year, and salary delays had become a routine issue on campus. In a statement following the general body meeting, the teachers’ society held the university administration responsible for the institution’s financial crisis, which was causing unrest on campus and disrupting academic and administrative activities. The society also criticised the issuance of show-cause notices to employees and called on the administration to take immediate measures to address the staff’s grievances. In its response, the university administration alleged that the protestors had manhandled administrative staff, including a female employee, during the demonstration. The administration further claimed that “a few teachers and non-teaching staff are trying to disrupt the peaceful environment of the campus for their personal gain, including the payment of the rental ceiling allowance, by using illegal means.” “The majority of teachers and non-teaching staff have rejected these elements, and teaching and administrative activities are continuing in most departments,” it asserted. Regarding the rental ceiling allowance, the administration explained that the university had set up a committee to review applicants’ documents and that the allowance would be granted in accordance with relevant laws. The university acknowledged that it had been facing a financial crisis for years due to several illegal appointments, corruption, and the absence of a permanent vice chancellor, and added that the administration was working to address employees’ grievances.

    "title": "Arteta: VAR not being clear is a shame - but we had enough to win",
    "text": "Arsenal went 1-0 down after 13 minutes when Tomas Soucek poked home Jarrod Bowen's cross; VAR checked to see if ball had gone out of play, but original decision to award the goal was allowed to stand; West Ham went on to win 2-0 to give David Moyes his first win as a manager at Arsenal Friday 29 December 2023 00:33, UK Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said it was a \"shame\" that VAR was not clear enough to determine whether West Ham's first goal in their 2-0 win over the Gunners should have stood. Tomas Soucek tapped home from close range from Jarrod Bowen's cross from the left byline on 13 minutes to give the Hammers the lead, but it was unclear as to whether the ball had gone out of play in the build-up. A three-and-a-half-minute VAR check saw the technology look at the best angles possible before awarding the goal, with Arteta revealing the officials told him that the image was \"not conclusive\" - so the on-field decision stood. \"I haven't seen it, they only thing they [the officials] said was the image was not conclusive,\" said Arteta in his post-match press conference. \"It's just a shame that the technology that we have is not that clear that we can say it's out of play. It's done, it's gone and there's nothing we can do about it now.\" \"So what we have to do is without that, win the game, and with the situations we had today, we had more than enough.\" Arsenal had 30 shots on goal and 77 touches in West Ham's box - the latter statistic being the most on record since 2008-09 in a single Premier League match for a team who failed to score. In the end, former Arsenal defender Dinos Mavropanos doubled West Ham's lead after half-time, with David Raya forced to save a Said Benrahma penalty in stoppage time to deny a Hammers third. However, the post-match talk surrounded the awarding of the first West Ham goal. This is the second time Arsenal have been involved in a situation similar to this, with Newcastle's winner against the Gunners in November controversially awarded after Joe Willock took the ball near the byline. According to the written reasons given after Arteta avoided an FA charge for his post-match comments, Willock told the Arsenal players that he had taken it out of play. Meanwhile, Bowen - the player directly involved in the incident - said it was difficult to tell whether it had gone out. \"I haven't seen it. It's difficult because the ball was in the air,\" he told Amazon Prime Sport. \"It was hard to tell. It would have been easier to tell if it had been on the ground. \"It was really important to get the first goal. We've won tonight. We need to take one game at a time. It sounds boring but we have to keep getting results.\" Sky Sports' Sam Blitz at the Emirates Stadium: Mikel Arteta may be grateful that Arsenal's 2-0 loss to West Ham came just days before the January transfer window opens. Thursday's night to forget showed why there are doubts that the Gunners can finish on top come May 19. Thirty shots without a goal - including two big misses from Gabriel Jesus and little-to-no impact from attacking substitutes Eddie Nketiah, Emile Smith Rowe and Reiss Nelson - raises more questions about whether more firepower is needed, especially a centre forward. But do Arsenal need a full-back too? Takehiro Tomiyasu is likely heading to the Asia Cup and Jurrien Timber is still on the injury list, which means there's too much focus on Oleksandr Zinchenko - and it's showing. A poor outing against Mohamed Salah at Liverpool and then unconvincing for West Ham's first goal. Perhaps it may be time to move on from the Ukrainian, especially in the big games. But what order these two positions sit on the priority list - and whether there are decent enough options out there - is still unclear.",
