    "title": "Celsius Network gets green light for Bitcoin mining",
    "text": "Cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network has received the green light to make a strategic shift into [bitcoin mining](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-to-mine-bitcoin/), following approval from a [U.S.](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-congress-has-had-a-very-dramatic-year/) bankruptcy judge. The decision represents a significant pivot for the company, which had originally aimed to earn fees from validating crypto transactions but had to alter its course after encountering regulatory obstacles. Here’s a closer look at Celsius Network’s bold move into the world of bitcoin mining. A Judge’s Approval for a New Direction In a recent ruling, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan granted Celsius Network the ability to deviate from its previously approved bankruptcy plan. This decision came after the company faced challenges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Judge Glenn determined that the new restructuring would not negatively impact creditors or customers, thus allowing Celsius Network to proceed with its bitcoin mining venture. Celsius Network’s journey to bitcoin mining began when it filed for Chapter 11 protection in July 2022. This move was in line with several other crypto lenders who faced financial difficulties amidst the rapid growth of the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally, Celsius had grand plans to generate revenue by validating crypto transactions and exploring new business avenues. However, the SEC’s rejection of this plan prompted a strategic shift. The change in direction also meant that the lender would no longer work with certain outside bidders who were initially chosen to oversee the new company. Instead, the responsibility for running the creditor-owned mining business fell squarely on the shoulders of mining company US Bitcoin Corp. Celsius’ Fahrenheit Consortium US Bitcoin Corp, founded by Hut 8’s Asher Genoot, was originally part of a consortium of bidders known as “Fahrenheit.” This consortium also included Arrington Capital and was intended to manage Celsius Network alongside other companies. However, with the pivot to bitcoin mining, Celsius parted ways with these bidders, leaving US Bitcoin Corp as the primary manager. While the shift in focus was deemed significant by some creditors and the U.S. Department of Justice’s bankruptcy watchdog, Judge Glenn ultimately approved the deal without calling for a new vote by creditors. Despite initial concerns that this change was not in line with what creditors had originally voted on, Celsius Network was granted the opportunity to move forward with its bitcoin mining plans. Celsius Network now looks ahead to emerging from bankruptcy in early 2024. The company’s scaled-back bankruptcy plan not only allows for the pursuit of bitcoin mining but also frees up $225 million in cryptocurrency assets. These assets were initially intended to fund new business lines that were rejected by the SEC. Benefits for Customers As a result of this strategic pivot, more cryptocurrency assets from Celsius will be returned to customers. Additionally, customers will receive equity shares in the new bitcoin mining venture. This move represents a unique approach to bankruptcy restructuring, one that aims to ensure that creditors and customers are not left in a worse position. Celsius Network’s foray into bitcoin mining is a testament to the evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency industry. As regulatory challenges continue to shape the sector, companies are finding innovative ways to adapt and thrive. This bold move by Celsius Network signals its determination to explore new opportunities in the world of digital assets.",

    "text": "Temperatures in the country were 2.16 degrees Celsius higher than average, breaking last year's record for July of 1.91 degrees Celsius above average. apan sweltered through its hottest July since records began 126 years ago, the weather agency said, as extreme heatwaves fuelled by climate change engulfed many parts of the globe. Temperatures in the country were 2.16 degrees Celsius higher than average, breaking last year's record for July of 1.91 degrees Celsius above average. \"It was the highest since statistics began in 1898,\" the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said Thursday, noting that the figures were \"considerably higher\" nationwide. Of 153 observation posts across Japan, 62 broke their average temperature record in July. Contributing factors included a high-pressure system over the Pacific and \"warm air from the south\" that shrouded northern parts of the archipelago, the JMA said. Since April, heatstroke has killed 59 people in Japan, according to the disaster management agency. Parasols and chunky necklaces that can be stored in the freezer have been a common sight around Tokyo, where street performer Jiro Kan, 56, told AFP he was feeling the heat. \"After spending two hours standing here, I get so sweaty I can literally squeeze it all out from my shirt. I'm drenched,\" said Kan, dressed in an all-yellow suit. \"People who are used to a more dry type of heat like in the United States find the heat and humidity in Japan more difficult to handle,\" he said in tourist hotspot Asakusa. Last month, Shizuoka west of Tokyo became the first Japanese region to see the mercury reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) this year -- far surpassing the 35-degree threshold deemed \"extremely hot\" by authorities. Heatwaves are becoming increasingly common across the globe, with the European Union's climate monitor saying in July that the Earth experienced its warmest day in recorded history.

    "text": "Wynnton Boots and Shoe Repair serves Columbus community for 75 years COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - Wynnton Boot and Shoe Repair has a long history in Columbus dating back three decades. The hum of specialized vintage equipment fills the workroom at Wynnton Boot and Shoe Repair in Midtown Columbus. Johnny Davis and his wife Karbina Davis have worked together in harmony for over 30 years at the shop’s current location. “It was Mr. Lee Brady that taught me how to fix shoes, J.E. Hagler started it, I worked for him for about 30 years before I bought it.” said Davis Wynnton Boot & Shoe Repair was first owned by J.E. Hagler. It was first located in the Midtown area in a shopping center where the old Rite Aide building now stands. Hagler handed down the shop to his two sons then it was later purchased by Johnny Davis in 1995. The shop is now located at the corner of Wynnton Rd. and Peacock Ave. “We do everything from putting on heels to re-soling shoes to fixing purses, sewing patches, anything that can be done with leather, we pretty much do it.” said Davis. “You can see the difference when the shoes come in- they looking old and rough and when they leave out they looking new.” said Karbina. From re-soling, stitching, adding taps to high-heeled shoes, shaping, and shinning, Cobbler and Karbina have repaired shoes for customers far and near. “Man, I done had customers ship me shoes from overseas. G-I’s, North Carolina, South Carolina, New York, Florida that used to live here, moved, but they still send me their shoes.” said Cobbler Many customers expressed their love and support for Wynnton Boot and Shoe Repair. “It’s the best place in town to get your shoes fixed. They do it quick and very inexpensively.” said longtime customer, Shawn Flowers “I’ve been coming for years. They are reliable, dependable, do excellent work at a reasonable price.” said longtime customer, Phyllis Jones Davis says if his customers are happy, he’s happy. Copyright 2024 WTVM.

Noga's enlistment day came more than five months after she was released and about four months after the announcement that her father, Ilan Weiss, 56, from Kibbutz Be'eri, was murdered and his body held in Gaza. \"After a very tumultuous period, I feel that enlisting is the right thing for me. I always wanted to enlist and contribute to the country, and the army for me is a combination of processing what happened, a distraction, daily routine and mainly getting in touch with reality,\" Noga said during the enlistment ceremony. \"Being a social welfare soldier was my dream role for years. I feel that I can contribute a lot, be significant and help others. I remember that on the day my mom and I were released, they took us to Kerem Shalom, and there the hangar was full of soldiers. The presence of the soldiers made me feel safe, and it only strengthened my desire to be a part of and serve in the army,\" she said.",

    "text": "Os primeiros 25 quilómetros de um muro de betão entre a África do Sul e Moçambique, para combater a criminalidade e a imigração ilegal, estarão concluídos no início do próximo ano, anunciaram esta quinta-feira as autoridades sul-africanas.\nO responsável do governo provincial de KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) para a área dos Transportes e Assentamentos Humanos, Siboniso Duma, adiantou, em conferência de imprensa, que o projeto pretende instalar na totalidade 160 quilómetros de muro em betão junto à fronteira com o país vizinho lusófono.\nA primeira fase de construção do muro de betão, iniciada em 2018, estende-se desde o posto de fronteira de Kosi Bay até à margem oeste do parque nacional Tembe Elephant Park , segundo as autoridades locais que divulgaram esta quinta-feira imagens da obra na imprensa sul-africana.\nO projeto ligará ainda ao parque de elefantes a região oeste da reserva animal de iSimangaliso e do rio Phongolo, no nordeste da província sul-africana de KZN, que faz fronteira com Moçambique, segundo as autoridades locais sul-africanas.\nPUB • CONTINUE A LER A SEGUIR\nO porta-voz do executivo provincial de KwaZulu-Natal, Ndabazinhle Sibiya, declarou ao jornal sul-africano Citizen que “o governo moçambicano não está obrigado a contribuir financeiramente para a construção do muro” de betão.\nDesde fevereiro de 2021, a África do Sul mantém destacada uma força de segurança especial a tempo inteiro ao longo da fronteira com Moçambique para travar o “enorme problema” da imigração ilegal oriunda do país lusófono, segundo o governo sul-africano.\nEm novembro de 2023, o Presidente sul-africano, Cyril Ramaphosa, aprovou também o destacamento de 3.300 efetivos do exército para impedir a exploração mineira ilegal em todo o país, que é rico em recursos como ouro, diamantes e platina.\nO setor, que conheceu um dos desenvolvimentos mais lucrativos do continente africano, está frequentemente associado à atividade de grupos criminosos organizados na África do Sul.\nPelo menos 83 moçambicanos, de um total de cerca de 1.200 mineiros ilegais, foram detidos desde abril de 2022 na África do Sul no âmbito do combate à mineração ilegal em várias províncias, anunciou a polícia sul-africana.",

    "text": "Due diversi governi, quello di Draghi e quello di Meloni, e due diversi ministri dell’Economia, il tecnico Franco e il politico Giorgetti, hanno investito non poco tempo della loro attività istituzionale a spiegare in lungo e in largo, a parole e numeri, la voragine aperta nei conti pubblici dal Superbonus 110%.\nMa le decisioni, sinora, non sono mai state una vera conseguenza delle stringenti analisi.\nLa cassa non si è mai chiusa per davvero e ciò che è derivato dai complessi “spiegoni” è una fila interminabile di correzioni, aggiustamenti delle correzioni, strette, riallargamenti, pseudo-archiviazioni e proroghe di fatto che non hanno fermato l’impatto sul debito e in aggiunta hanno mandato nel caos (e talvolta in crisi) imprese, tecnici, condomini e famiglie.\nIn qualche modo l’intera storia del Superbonus 110% è la rappresentazione della confusione in cui versa la politica e il partitismo italiano. Da un lato la consapevolezza “istituzionale” che bisogna rimettere ordine nelle spese, a partire da quelle meno giustificabili, dall’altro la consapevolezza, politico-elettorale, che le generose misure pandemiche sono ancora centrali per tenere il segno “più” davanti all’anemico Pil nazionale. E quindi non sorprende l’unità da destra a sinistra nel rinnovare, a discapito ancora una volta delle posizioni di Giorgetti, una misura che aggiunge debito sulle spalle dei figli.\nMa un’osservazione è doverosa: la stessa bonaria comprensione delle «difficoltà» dei cantieri non si è vista quando si è deciso di tagliare il Reddito di cittadinanza, a fronte di un volume di truffe molto ma molto più basso rispetto a quelle cumulate con il 110%.",
