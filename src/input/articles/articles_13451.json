    "title": "Asked by party not to canvass in NE barring Arunachal: Sarma | India News - Times of India",
    "text": "GUWAHATI: Assam CM and BJP star campaigner Himanta Biswa Sarma said Thursday the party brass had directed him to refrain from canvassing in northeastern states, except Arunachal Pradesh, because of boundary disputes involving his state and its neighbours.Sarma’s comments came in the wake of NDA’s electoral setbacks in BJP-governed Manipur, where it lost both seats to Congress. Similarly, NDA conceded one seat to Congress in Nagaland, and regional outfit Voice of the People Party (VPP) and Congress secured one each in Meghalaya.According to Sarma, he was asked to “not be seen in these states frequently”, and instead focus his campaign efforts in eastern India, covering Odisha, Jharkhand, and Bengal. “I could not contribute to the best of my abilities in Manipur, Nagaland, and Meghalaya,” said the CM, who is also the convener of BJP-led North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), an NDA-like grouping for the region.He attributed NDA’s defeats in these states to the influence of a particular religious community over the electorate. “When religious people take part in politics, politicians cannot compete. You can compete with Congress, BJP, AGP, but how can you compete with the Sankaracharya or Srimanta Sankardeva? When spiritual leaders decide voting patterns, politicians’ roles become minimised,” Sarma said.Further clarifying, he said: “It’s unimaginable that Agatha Sangma (sitting MP of NDA ally NPP) would lose by more than one lakh votes (in Tura, Meghalaya).”Responding to Sarma’s remarks, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi condemned the CM’s statements. He tweeted: “…He does not have the maturity to accept responsibility for the NDA’s losses in Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Manipur. I appeal to the chief ministers of the respective states to publicly condemn the statement. Together we must preserve the unique identity of the Northeast.”Sarma described the setbacks as specific to this election. “This time they (people) had some grievances and expressed them through voting. It will be erased.”NDA performed well in Assam, winning 11 of 14 seats. The alliance also maintained its dominance in Arunachal and Tripura, securing both seats in each state. BJP also formed its govt in Arunachal, with a landslide victory in simultaneous assembly polls. However, NDA’s overall LS tally of 15 seats in the region was three less than what it achieved in 2019.TOI reported earlier on BJP’s decision to deploy Sarma outside the region, suggesting a strategic move to leverage his skills nationally and potentially groom him for a larger role within the party. This also suggested a deliberate distancing from the complex political climate of North-East, where BJP has had a mixed record.",

    "title": "Meet Crush, the rare orange lobster diverted from dinner plate to aquarium by Denver Broncos fans",
    "text": "The Downtown Aquarium in Denver has a new resident — a rare orange lobster that was rescued from a shipment of crustaceans delivered to a Red Lobster restaurant in Pueblo, Colorado.\nA long-term employee who is a dishwasher and head biscuit maker spotted the bright orange lobster while unpacking a shipment last Friday and alerted restaurant managers, aquarium officials said. The staff named it Crush after the Denver Broncos’ legendary Orange Crush defense from 1976 to 1986.\n“Myself and many of my team are born and raised Denver Broncos fans, so as soon as we saw that orange color, we knew that Crush would be an excellent representation,” said Kendra Kastendieck, the restaurant’s general manager. “And we all want our defensive line to be that good again.”\nWhen the Pueblo Zoo couldn’t take Crush, Kastendieck called the Downtown Aquarium, which she said was interested right away.\nKastendieck packed Crush with ice packs in a plastic foam container and delivered it to the aquarium on Wednesday.\n“As soon as they acclimated him to his quarantine tank at the Denver aquarium, he was very active right off the bat and was really exploring his little area,” Kastendieck said Thursday.\nStaff had set up a tank with a new generation Denver Broncos helmet on top and an older generation one sitting in the tank “so he can actually climb into it and play around it,” she said.\nCrush will be examined by a veterinarian and after 30 days in quarantine will be placed in the “Lurks” exhibit that houses other cold water North Atlantic Ocean species, aquarium staff said.\n“We are thrilled to be able to share this very rare and extraordinary animal with the community and visitors to Colorado,” Ryan Herman, general curator at Denver Downtown Aquarium, said in a statement.\nCrush was shipped to the Pueblo restaurant from a supplier in Tennessee. It was caught off a coast of Canada, said Kastendieck, but she was unable to confirm which coast.\nGenetic mutations can lead to lobsters that are orange, blue and yellow. Downtown Aquarium has had one orange lobster previously.\nThe Downtown Aquarium has more than 700 species of fish along with a stingray reef and three Sumatran tigers.\n___\nHanson reported from Helena, Montana.",

    "text": "Dry, windy conditions are expected Friday afternoon, bringing with it a brush fire danger.\nThe National Weather Service issued the following Special Weather Statement this morning, urging caution with flammable items outside today.\n…ELEVATED FIRE DANGER TODAY ACROSS PARTS OF EASTERN WEST VIRGINIA, NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VIRGINIA, AND DC METRO AREA…\nElevated potential for the rapid spread of fire is expected this afternoon to early evening due to the combination of dry conditions and gusty winds. Relative humidity values drop to around 25 to 35 percent, along with sustained northwesterly around 15 mph and gusts to 20 to 30 mph. This will result in the rapid drying of fine fuels like grass, leaves, and small shrubs.\nResidents and visitors are urged to exercise caution if handling open flames or equipment that create sparks. Also, dispose of cigarette butts, matches, and other flammable items in appropriate containers. Keep vehicles off of dry grass and obey local burn bans. Most dry grasses, dead leaves, and other tree litter could easily ignite and spread a fire quickly.\nFor more information about wildfire danger, burn restrictions, and wildfire prevention and education, please visit your state’s forestry or environmental protection website.\nWhile there were a few sprinkles around the region this morning, no measurable rain was recorded and thus the D.C. area’s dry streak continues to approach record-breaking territory, according to the Capital Weather Gang .\nDC did not receive measurable rain from these showers so the dry streak lives on and is poised to become the longest on record next week. https://t.co/dPt29kcrPR\n— Capital Weather Gang (@capitalweather) November 1, 2024",

    "title": "La nueva ley de inmigración de Texas \"viola la Constitución de EE.UU.\", advierte Gobierno de Biden",
    "text": "(CNN) -- La nueva ley de inmigración en Texas, que otorga a las autoridades locales la facultad de arrestar a inmigrantes, “viola la Constitución de Estados Unidos”, advirtió este jueves el Departamento de Justicia en una dirigida carta al gobernador Greg Abbott. El departamento también amenaza con demandar la medida, a menos de que Abbott no la implemente.\nLa carta, obtenida por CNN, marca la escalada más reciente entre el presidente Joe Biden y Abbott sobre la gestión de la frontera entre Estados Unidos y México.\nA principios de este mes, Abbott promulgó una ley, conocida como SB4, que permite a las fuerzas locales detener a migrantes y a los jueces emitir órdenes para deportarlos de Estados Unidos.\nLa nueva ley de inmigración de Texas siembra confusión e incertidumbre a lo largo de la frontera\nLa Casa Blanca criticó la ley, al calificarla de \"increíblemente extrema\". Se espera que entre en vigor en marzo.\nEl vicesecretario adjunto de Justicia, Brian Boynton, dijo en su carta a Abbott este jueves que “Estados Unidos tiene la intención de presentar una demanda para prohibir la aplicación de la SB 4 a menos que Texas acepte abstenerse de implementarla”.\nSi bien el gobierno federal está “comprometido a... asegurar la frontera”, escribió Boynton, la ley de Texas es “contraria a estos objetivos”.\n¿Cómo es la nueva ley de Texas que penaliza la entrada irregular de migrantes al estado? Las claves de la polémica ley SB4\nEl actual aumento de migrantes que registra la frontera entre Estados Unidos y México ha ejercido una inmensa presión sobre los recursos locales y federales. La amenaza legal de este jueves sigue a una demanda del Departamento de Justicia contra Texas por el uso de barreras flotantes en el río Grande. Una batalla que sigue su curso en los tribunales.\nHacer cumplir la ley de inmigración es una responsabilidad federal y los opositores a la medida de Texas argumentan que esta es inconstitucional.\nLa nueva ley ha desatado oleadas de miedo en toda la comunidad latina de Texas, que representa el 40% de la población del estado. Grupos de derechos civiles, incluida la Unión Estadounidense de Libertades Civiles, presentaron una demanda para bloquear la medida.\n¿Qué acordaron México y EE.UU. en su reunión sobre migración? Puntos clave\nLa amenaza del Departamento de Justicia de demandar se produce inmediatamente después de conversaciones de alto nivel entre altos funcionarios estadounidenses y mexicanos esta semana.\nLos funcionarios de ambos países describieron las conversaciones como productivas y se espera que los funcionarios mexicanos visiten Washington el próximo mes para continuar las discusiones.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
