    "title": "EDITORIAL: Highlight the resume with fast-food work",
    "text": "It was a political stunt for the ages when former President Donald Trump donned a McDonald’s apron to work the fry machine and drive-thru window. Whether it helps reelect him remains to be seen, but let’s hope it does one thing for sure.\nLet’s hope it symbolizes the dignity and importance of entry-level work.\nFast-food jobs become more important as inflation prices millions of Americans out of fast casual and sit-down restaurants. As the value of these jobs continues to rise, we see employment ads offering considerably more remuneration than the highest state minimum wages.\nToday’s fast-food employees are increasingly rewarded with health insurance benefits, tuition assistance, flexible schedules and more. Some businesses offer hiring bonuses or “get paid the first day you work.”\nThough an assortment of entry-level employers offer the moon and stars to young unskilled workers, McDonald’s has come to symbolize the first job. In 2015, the company began marketing itself for offering “America’s Best First Job.”\nThe 20th and 21st centuries provide countless examples of people who began their working years at McDonald’s and/or other fast-food establishments.\nJeff Bezos, founder and former CEO of Amazon, has amassed a fortune worth hundreds of billions. For him, it all began with flipping burgers and fulfilling orders at age 16.\n“You can learn responsibility in any job if you take it seriously,” Bezos said, as quoted by Wired magazine. “You learn a lot as a teenager working at McDonald’s. It’s different from what you learn in school. Don’t underestimate the value of that!”\nTaylor Morrison, CEO of the Taylor Morrison homebuilding company, began working at McDonald’s at age 15, climbing the ranks to become the company’s marketing manager for San Diego stores by the time she turned 20.\n“Every 16-year-old should have to work at McDonald’s, because you really do learn how to work,” said Morrison, as quoted by Business Insider.\n“You have to pull back the equipment and sweep behind. There are no shortcuts. You had to do it right because it was such a part of their brand. There were a lot of life lessons in that job.”\nPaul Ryan, former speaker of the U.S. House, credits much of his success to fast-food experience.\n“When I was flippin’ burgers at McDonald’s, when I was standing in front of that big Hobart machine washing dishes or waiting tables, I never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life,” Ryan said during a 2012 speech.\n“I thought to myself, ‘I’m the American dream on a path and journey so that I can find happiness however I can find it myself.’”\nColorado’s unlikeliest member of Congress, Rep. Lauren Boebert, credits a McDonald’s job for keeping her off welfare — which she grew up on — and for showing her the freedom and fulfillment that comes with working for money.\nVice President Kamala Harris claims a McDonald’s work history, hoping it will help her become the first female president.\nSome of the most successful people in the world tell war stories of entry-level work — usually at a fast-food chain — before they mention Ivy League degrees or promotions in the suit-and-tie world.\nThat’s because all work is important. All work elevates, strengthens and enlightens the person putting in the hours. Politics aside, it is good to see our country’s most accomplished leaders highlighting entry-level work as the foundation for success.\nThe Gazette Editorial Board",

    "text": "O atacante Ênio se pronunciou, pela primeira vez, após a divulgação das investigações sobre uma possível manipulação na partida do Juventude no Brasileirão 2025.\nDurante a primeira rodada, uma suspeita foi levantada após a alta entrada de apostas em um cartão amarelo que o atacante levou, ainda no primeiro tempo da partida.\nSuspeitas\n- A partida entre Juventude e Vitória, na primeira rodada, entrou na mira das autoridades;\n- Relatório da Ibia (Associação Internacional de Integridade nas Apostas Esportivas) cita 111 usuários na aposta, mas com muitas contas criadas antes do jogo;\n- A CBF já recebeu o relatório sobre as suspeitas.\nÊnio se pronunciou\nO cartão que o atacante levou, ainda no primeiro tempo, veio por meio de reclamação contra o árbitro, Paulo Zanovelli. Ênio recebeu uma entrada, a falta não foi marcada e por isso, se exaltou contra a arbitragem, causando sua punição:\n“Desde o início da minha trajetória no futebol, há cerca de 10 anos, sempre tive uma conduta absolutamente correta. Em minha vida pessoal, jamais me envolvi com qualquer indivíduo, grupo de pessoas ou coisas que o valha, que objetivasse algo ilícito, imoral ou desabonador; Trabalhei ao longo desses anos para voltar a um clube de Série A. Não desperdiçaria essa oportunidade. Além disso, não decepcionaria meus companheiros e o clube que abriu as portas para mim.\nDiante da gravidade das acusações, já estão sendo tomadas as medidas judiciais cabíveis para comprovar minha total inocência e responsabilizar os que porventura estejam agindo de má-fé ou de forma precipitada. Por fim, deixo clara a minha total disponibilidade em contribuir com o que for necessário para que, no mais curto espaço de tempo, eu possa voltar a desempenhar o meu ofício\".\nCartão amarelo na mira\nA Ibia (Associação Internacional de Integridade nas Apostas Esportivas) entregou um relatório para a CBF onde cita 111 usuários e aproximadamente R$ 56,7 mil em apostas feitas.\nEntretanto, a maioria das apostas foram feitas momentos antes do jogo e por contas recém-criadas e feitas somente para a aposta no cartão amarelo de Ênio. O movimento em massa ligou o alerta sobre uma possível manipulação.\nCinco bets diferentes foram citadas no documento da Ibia. Ênio levou o cartão aos 36 minutos do primeiro tempo, e com diversas apostas feitas de fora do Brasil. O jogador foi afastado do clube, que deu a justificativa de que o negociaria com o futebol estrangeiro. Entretanto, até agora, a venda não foi feita.\nConfira os placares dos jogos pela 2ª rodada da Série A do Brasileirão 2025\nSábado (5):\n- Corinthians 3 x 0 Vasco — 18h30 (de Brasília) — Neo Química Arena\n- Ceará 2 x 0 Grêmio — 18h30 (de Brasília) — Castelão (CE)\n- Botafogo 2 x 0 Juventude — 21h (de Brasília) — Nilton Santos\nDomingo (6):\n- Fluminense 2 x 1 Red Bull Bragantino — 16h (de Brasília) — Maracanã\n- Atlético-MG 0 x 0 São Paulo — 16h (de Brasília) — Mineirão\n- Mirassol 1 x 1 Fortaleza — 18h30 (de Brasília) — Maião\n- Internacional 3 x 0 Cruzeiro — 18h30 (de Brasília) — Beira-Rio\n- Vitória 1 x 2 Flamengo — 18h30 (de Brasília) — Barradão\n- Sport 1 x 2 Palmeiras — 18h30 (de Brasília) — Ilha do Retiro\n- Santos 2 x 2 Bahia — 20h30 (de Brasília) — Vila Belmiro\nQuais times vão disputar a Série A do Campeonato Brasileiro em 2025?\n- Atlético-MG\n- Bahia\n- Botafogo\n- Ceará\n- Corinthians\n- Cruzeiro\n- Flamengo\n- Fluminense\n- Fortaleza\n- Juventude\n- Grêmio\n- Internacional\n- Mirassol\n- Palmeiras\n- Red Bull Bragantino\n- Santos\n- São Paulo\n- Sport\n- Vasco\n- Vitória\nTimes rebaixados para a Série B 2025:\nAtlético-GO, Athletico-PR, Cuiabá e Criciúma caíram e irão disputar a Série B do Campeonato Brasileiro neste ano.\nTimes que subiram para Série A 2025:\nOs times que subiram foram Santos (campeão da Série B), Mirassol, Sport e Ceará.\nComo é disputada a Série A do Brasileirão?\nDisputado no sistema de pontos corridos desde 2003, a elite do futebol brasileiro passou a ter 20 clubes competindo a partir de 2005. Desde então, o formato de disputa segue sendo utilizado.\nOs 20 times jogam entre si uma vez por turno. No segundo turno, ou returno, as partidas são realizadas na mesma ordem do primeiro, invertendo o mando de campo. O vencedor soma três pontos por jogo, empate dá um ponto para cada time, e derrota não dá nenhum.\nNo Campeonato Brasileiro não há campeões por turnos. O troféu vai para quem somar mais pontos durante as 38 rodadas, podendo ser matematicamente definido com antecedência ou apenas no final, dando mais emoção aos torcedores na disputa!\nOs seis primeiros clubes na tabela de classificação vão para a Libertadores 2025, sendo os quatro primeiros classificados direto para a fase de grupos, e o 5º e o 6º indo para a fase preliminar.\nOs times que terminam do 7º ao 12º lugar vão para a Sul-Americana 2025, e os quatro últimos colocados são rebaixados à Série B.\nO campeão brasileiro disputa, no início do ano seguinte, a Supercopa do Brasil contra o campeão da Copa do Brasil de 2024. As 380 partidas do Brasileirão contam com árbitro de vídeo (VAR), e a partir desta edição, os árbitros terão que comunicar, em áudio e vídeo, a decisão para todo o estádio.\nCritérios de desempate:\nCaso haja empate entre times na pontuação ao final da disputa, serão aplicados os seguintes critérios de desempate, em ordem:\n- Número de vitórias;\n- Saldo de gols;\n- Gols pró (marcados);\n- Confronto direto;\n- Menor número de cartões vermelhos;\n- Menor número de cartões amarelos;\n- Sorteio.",

    "text": "La AEMET mantiene los avisos rojos: hoy y este fin de semana continuarán las lluvias fuertes en estas zonas\nAntes de retirarse todavía los restos de la DANA dejarán precipitaciones fuertes y persistentes en puntos dónde lloverá sobre mojado, con tormentas localmente intensas y granizo.\nSeguimos bajo la influencia de las bajas presiones que están dejando precipitaciones importantes especialmente en el cuadrante suroeste peninsular, pero también en el Levante, sur de Aragón, litoral de Cataluña y Baleares. Las tormentas son localmente fuertes y persistentes en la Andalucía occidental.\nLa AEMET mantendrá un aviso rojo hasta las 12 horas en el litoral de Huelva, allí hay que extremar las precauciones ante las lluvias que se están produciendo, de hasta 140 l/m2 en 12 horas. También lloverá en el Bajo Ebro y las Islas Baleares, así como en la vertiente sur del Sistema Central occidental, al suroeste de Castilla y León.\nFrente a esto, en el Cantábrico, norte de Galicia, alto Ebro y norte de la meseta norte son muy poco probables, al igual que en Canarias. Sí se pueden dar en cualquier otro punto de la península Ibérica.\nEn la vertiente mediterránea oriental puede haber acumulados de entre 20 y 30 l/m2 por hora y 60 l/m2 en 12h. En Baleares se pueden registrar 50 l/m2 por hora y más de 120 l/m2 en menos de un día.\nLas temperaturas máximas subirán hoy por el oeste peninsular, pero seguirán en descenso en el resto del país. Los vientos predominan del componente este, siendo algo más intensos en las zonas litorales y registrando intervalos fuertes en Cádiz y en el archipiélago balear.\nMás precipitaciones fuertes este sábado\nAunque la inestabilidad irá a menos, se seguirán registrando precipitaciones durante el fin de semana. La jornada del sábado será una jornada de transición hacia la estabilidad, pero todavía con precipitaciones en el sur de Andalucía y levante, la zona del medio-bajo Ebro, este de Cataluña y Baleares.\nRiesgo importante por acumulados de precipitación en torno a 40 l/m2 en una hora y 100 l/m2 en 12 horas en el litoral y prelitoral sur de Tarragona, algo inferiores en el litoral e interior de Castellón, y hasta primeras horas de la mañana en Mallorca y Menorca.\nLos chubascos y tormentas podrán volver a ser localmente fuertes y persistentes en el sur de Cataluña, Baleares y los litorales de Castellón y Valencia, aunque pueden registrarse también en sus interiores. Por contra, en Canarias se podrán registrar algunas precipitaciones débiles, más dispersas y ocasionales en las islas de mayor relieve.\nSeguirán subiendo las temperaturas máximas por el oeste peninsular, manteniéndose sin muchos cambios en el resto de la península. Y sin variaciones importantes de las mínimas por la noche.\nLos vientos continuarán soplando en general débiles de componente este, y variables en Canarias. Aunque en los litorales volverán a soplar con intervalos fuertes y también el levante fuerte en el Estrecho.\n¿Menos lluvia para el domingo?\nEl domingo seguiremos caminando hacia la estabilidad atmosférica pero con precipitaciones todavía en las comunidades mediterráneas, medio-bajo Ebro y los litorales catalanes. También en la zona del Estrecho y Baleares, así como en otras zonas del este peninsular.\nEn el Bajo Ebro habrá chubascos y tormentas localmente fuertes y persistentes hasta el mediodía, especialmente en el litoral norte de Castellón y sur de Tarragona. Además, continuaremos con posibilidad de precipitaciones débiles y dispersas en las islas montañosas de Canarias.\nLas temperaturas se mantendrán sin grandes cambios para terminar la semana, con aumentos ligeros de las máximas. El viento de levante seguirá soplando con intervalos fuertes en la zona del Estrecho y el Mar de Alborán. Con viento del este reforzado en los litorales y Baleares un día más, y viento flojo de componente variable en el archipiélago canario.",

    "text": "Colombia alcanza la cifra más baja de deforestación en 23 años Publicado: 18 jul 2024 21:49 GMT El canciller de Colombia, Luis Gilberto Murillo, informó este jueves que su país ha logrado alcanzar \"la cifra más baja de deforestación en 23 años\", una noticia que calificó como \"esperanzadora\" y que responde a una reducción de 36 % en la deforestación durante 2023, al dejar de talar 44.261 hectáreas de bosques.\nMurilló detalló, a través de la red social X, que la superficie no deforestada \"equivale a casi tres veces el tamaño de Bucaramanga\", un municipio que es capital del departamento de Santander, ubicado al noreste del país. \"Este logro es el resultado del compromiso de todos los colombianos y de las políticas claras y decididas del Plan Nacional de Desarrollo 2022 – 2026\", resaltó.\nEl ministro agregó que Colombia proyectaba reducir la deforestación en al menos 20 % respecto a 2021; sin embargo, ya esa cifra ha sido superada \"con creces\", dijo. \"Este avance demuestra que, unidos, podemos salvaguardar nuestra riqueza natural y construir un futuro sostenible para las próximas generaciones\", apuntó.\nComparto una noticia esperanzadora: Colombia logró la cifra más baja de deforestación en 23 años.

    "title": "¿Por qué es peligroso usar doble calcetín para protegerse del frío?",
    "text": "Mujer se pone unos calcetines color gris\nUsar doble calcetín como método para protegerse del frío puede parecer una solución tentadora en climas fríos, pero en realidad, esta práctica puede ser peligrosa para tu salud. Aquí te decimos por qué.\nEsta práctica puede restringir la circulación sanguínea en los pies, especialmente si los calcetines son muy ajustados o si se usan zapatos que no tienen el espacio suficiente para acomodar la doble capa.\nLa reducción del flujo sanguíneo no solo disminuye la capacidad del cuerpo para mantener el calor en los pies, sino que también puede llevar a condiciones como el entumecimiento, las ampollas o incluso la congelación en climas extremadamente fríos.\nTe recomendamos: Clima en México: seguirán las heladas en la noche; ingresa el frente frío 20\nPor ello, es crucial elegir la ropa adecuada y evitar prácticas que puedan parecer beneficiosas a corto plazo, pero que, en realidad, podrían comprometer la salud y el bienestar.\n¿Por qué no es bueno ponerse doble calcetín contra el frío? Según una publicación de la Secretaría de Gobernación, se aconseja no usar dos pares de medias o calcetines simultáneamente, ya que esto puede interrumpir la circulación en los pies.\nEsta restricción circulatoria puede causar la formación de manchas distintas a los moretones en la zona afectada.\nSíntomas como el hormigueo, picazón, hinchazón de pies y tobillos, cambio de color a tonos morados o azules, calambres y la aparición de varices rojizas son indicativos de mala circulación sanguínea.\nLos calcetines normalmente tienen una banda elástica en su borde superior para evitar que se deslicen, ejerciendo presión alrededor del tobillo.\nEl uso de una doble capa aumenta esta presión, obstruyendo aún más el flujo sanguíneo.\nPor lo tanto, se recomienda optar por calcetines de lana, que mantienen los pies cálidos sin causar exceso de sudoración, son libres de costuras y suficientemente ligeros para usar cómodamente.\n¿Cómo protegerse de frío? Para protegerse eficientemente del frío, se pueden adoptar varias medidas. Una de ellas es la técnica de la cebolla, que consiste en vestirse con múltiples capas de ropa.\nEs vital también proteger las áreas más expuestas al frío como el rostro, cabeza, manos y orejas. El uso de accesorios como guantes, bufandas, gorros y orejeras ayuda a mantener estas áreas calientes y prevenir la pérdida de calor corporal.\nLa alimentación juega un papel importante en el refuerzo del sistema inmunológico. Consumir frutas y verduras ricas en vitamina C, como naranjas, limones, guayabas, fresas, ciruelas, pimientos y brócoli, puede ayudar a fortalecer las defensas del cuerpo.\nFinalmente, al pasar de un ambiente cálido a frío, es recomendable cubrirse boca y nariz para evitar el choque térmico y proteger las vías respiratorias.\nCon estas prácticas, se puede minimizar el impacto del frente frío y mantener una buena salud durante la temporada invernal.",

    "text": "RMP tras aprobación del predictamen en la Comisión de Constitución: \"El Congreso no para de atacar a la JNJ\" La periodista mencionó que el Congreso está decidido a modificar importantes secciones de la Constitución ante la pasividad de la población. [Rosa Maria Palacios](https://larepublica.pe/tag/rosa-maria-palacios), a través del programa Sin Guion, se pronunció sobre el predictamen aprobado en la Comisión de Constitución que busca eliminar a la Junta Nacional de Justicia (JNJ) y crear la Escuela Nacional de la Magistratura. La periodista mencionó que el Congreso está decidido a modificar importantes secciones de la Constitución ante la pasividad de la población, pues el dictamen preparado por la exfiscal [Gladys Echaiz](https://larepublica.pe/tag/gladys-echaiz) , aprobado con 13 votos a favor, 5 en contra y 5 abstenciones, tiene diseñado todo un sistema para que los miembros del próximo reemplazo de la JNJ pasen por otro esquema que no sea el aprobado a través de un referéndum en diciembre de 2018. PUEDES VER: [JNJ tras aprobación de predictamen en Constitución: “Afecta a todo el sistema de justicia”] Bajo ese contexto, Palacios recuerda que el origen de la Junta Nacional de Justicia se dio cuando, en julio del mismo año, se filtró un audio donde se negociaban los puestos de fiscales y jefes del Consejo Nacional de la Magistratura, hecho que desencadenó la destitución de los miembros de aquel entonces. Posteriormente, el expresidente [Vizcarra ](https://larepublica.pe/tag/martin-vizcarra) presentó un proyecto de reforma constitucional que culminó en un referéndum, donde el 86% de los peruanos aprobaron la modificación del sistema de justicia, entre otros temas, como el fin de la reelección congresal. Palacios menciona que \"hace más de un año que el Congreso no para de atacar a la Junta Nacional\" desde que destituyó a todos sus miembros por causas graves el año pasado e inhabilitó por 10 años a dos de ellos. Además, si la [Comisión de Constitución](https://larepublica.pe/tag/comision-de-constitucion) también aprobó el dictamen para que puedan elegir de manera directa a los jefes de la ONPE y la RENIEC, lo que el Pleno está buscando sería apoderarse en su totalidad del sistema electoral y de justicia. RMP también se pronunció sobre la agenda del viaje a China de Boluarte y la aprobación de la Comisión de Relaciones Exteriores Palacios cuestionó la agenda del viaje de la presidenta Boluarte a China, que fue autorizado en el Pleno del Congreso el día de ayer con 71 votos a favor, 41 en contra y 6 abstenciones. Si bien se presenta como una visita de Estado, 3 de los 7 días serán destinados a reuniones con empresarios chinos y constructoras. Entre ellos, se incluyen representantes de la empresa de tecnología Huawei, la misma que financia algunos de los viajes de los congresistas. Asimismo, Rosa María Palacios también se pronunció sobre la aprobación del dictamen del proyecto de ley que busca regular y sancionar a las Organizaciones No Gubernamentales (ONG) que reciben financiamiento del exterior, bajo el pretexto de contribuir con la supervisión y correcto uso de recursos del exterior. Según la periodista, esta aprobación por parte de la Comisión de Relaciones Exteriores del [Congreso](https://larepublica.pe/tag/congreso-del-peru) es una violación a la Constitución y pondría en riesgo el financiamiento de organizaciones de prensa, defensoras de derechos humanos y las que defienden la salud sexual y reproductiva en mujeres. Organizaciones que, para Palacios, serían 'enemigas' de los congresistas.",
