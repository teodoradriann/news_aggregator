    "title": "What Is the Historical Context of Easter?",
    "text": "Christians celebrate Easter in commemoration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. In the early Church, there were different dates for the Easter celebration. Many people are also unaware of the connection between Easter and the connection to the Jewish feasts. The Feast of First Fruits is relevant to our understanding of the significance of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Drawing from the New Testament, we will discover how Paul made the connection. It is, however, not only the Jews that influenced how we celebrate Easter today.\nThe Paschal Controversy\nSetting a date for Easter became quite a controversy in the\nEarly Church. In Asia Minor, churches determined when to celebrate the resurrection of Christ according to the Jewish Pesach feast. This feast is set on the 14th day of the first month of the Jewish calendar. The first new moon of Spring began this first month, called Nissan (or Nisan). Like a birthday, the 14th day of Nissan falls on a different weekday every year.\nWestern churches began celebrating Easter according to the day of the week rather than the date of the month. According to their reckoning, by prioritizing the days they could then have Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday every year.\nEventually, the\nCouncil of Nicea took up the issue. Proponents of each view could make their case. In the end, a majority voted to prioritize the day rather than the date of the Jewish feast. The Quartodecimans (“14th-day” proponents) had to abandon their observance of the Pesach feast day as the basis for setting a date for Easter. Easter can fall on any Sunday between March 22nd and April 25th. Easter falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the Spring Equinox. This Vernal Equinox falls on March 21st.\nGet the latest articles delivered to your inboxSign up to our Free Weekly Newsletter\nThe Eastern Orthodox Easter date is slightly different from that of the Roman Catholic or Protestant reckoning. They follow the Julian, rather than the Gregorian calendar. Because of this, Easter tends to be later in their system since the Julian Calendar is thirteen days later than in the Gregorian version. They also have a rule that Easter may not be set before or coincide with the Passover.\nConnection With the Old Testament Feasts\nEven with the prioritization of the days, rather than the date, Easter still has some connection with the first three Old Testament feasts. Good Friday has its roots in the Passover, the Sabbath\nJesus spent in the grave aligns with the first day of the week-long Feast of Unleavened Bread, and the Feast of First Fruits prefigured Easter Sunday, the day of the Resurrection. Let’s take a closer look at these feasts.\nPassover commemorates the salvation of Israel from Egypt. According to Leviticus 23:5, the 14th day of the first month of the Jewish year was the date for the Pesach feast. The next day, 15 Nisan, the week-long feast called the Feast of the Unleavened Bread began. The day after the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread was the Feast of First Fruits. On this day, the Israelites had to take the first fruits of the harvest to the Tabernacle and later the Temple. It follows that this feast would fall on the 16th of Nisan. If Passover fell on a Friday, then the first three feasts of the Jewish calendar would follow a Friday-Saturday-Sunday sequence.\nThe third feast, which the Israelites had to institute when they left Egypt, was strange. The feast was associated with the agricultural cycle and a successful harvest is essential to fulfilling the given instructions. Yet when God gave the instructions about this feast, the Israelites did not possess any land. They still had some way to go through a desert in order to conquer the land the Lord promised them. It turned out to be a 40-year journey.\nDuring this time, the Israelites could not meet the requirements for observing the Feast of First Fruits. But what did this feast point to? In retrospect, for Christians, the Passover pointed to the crucifixion of Jesus. It is believed that the symbol of the unblemished lamb, the blood on the doorposts, and unleavened bread all pointed to Christ. It would, therefore, make sense that the Feast of First Fruits would also point to Christ in some way.\nThe Concept of First Fruits and the Feast of First Fruits\nThe principle of “first fruits” is a concept found in the\nOld Testament. It involves dedicating the first portion of agricultural produce to God as an expression of gratitude and acknowledgment of his provision. The idea behind offering first fruits is to recognize God’s sovereignty over the harvest and to demonstrate trust in his ongoing provision.\nAccording to Exodus 23:19, the first fruits the Israelites had to present must be the best of the crop. It was, therefore, not only the first in sequence of the harvested crop but also the first in quality.\nFrom the New Testament perspective, we find that Paul, educated among the elite in the intricacies of the Jewish faith, made the connection between the resurrection of Jesus and the concept of first fruits. Paul wrote the following about the first fruits in the context of the resurrection of Jesus in 1 Corinthians 15:20-23:\n“But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ.”\nThe Feast of First Fruits pointed to the resurrection of Jesus Christ on the Sunday after Passover. Jesus makes the resurrection of all believers to eternal life possible and serves as the first fruits, the best of the harvest.\nJesus fulfills the first fruit principle because he did not deserve to die, was without sin, and exemplified the love of God by sacrificing himself on behalf of others. He was the first to overcome death, not in sequence, but in rank.\nCelebrating the Resurrection in Early Christianity\nIn the past, the different Christian communities had different ways of celebrating the resurrection of Christ. Some observed it as a solemn occasion, while others celebrated it as a joyful feast.\nDuring the rule of\nConstantine, when the Council of Nicea set the date for the commemoration of Easter, Christianity incorporated many pagan customs and symbols into their practices, and it was no different with the celebration of the resurrection of Christ. Since some pagan feasts align with the general time associated with the celebration of the resurrection—names, traditions, and symbols common to other religions soon became part of the Christian practice as well.\nThe name “Easter” comes from the pagan goddess of Spring and is associated with fertility. Easter is an example of a Christianized practice. The hare, often depicted alongside the Goddess Eostre, became the Easter Bunny, and eggs—a sign of fertility—also entered the Christian tradition.\nThe Historical Context of Easter: Conclusion\nThere were some contentious issues surrounding Easter in early Christian history. These were settled at the Council of Nicaea when churchmen established the method for setting the date for Easter.\nThe early Church decided to prioritize Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday over the connection to Passover when calculating the date for Easter. There is, however, significant symbolism in the concept of the first fruits that points to Jesus as the pre-eminent One that rose from the dead. Later, when the Western Church adopted the Gregorian calendar in the Middle Ages, the dates for Easter in the Eastern and Western Churches no longer aligned.\nPaganism also influenced Easter as we know it today. Some of the imagery and practices related to Easter come from the Eostre cult. The name “Easter” comes from Eostre, and the Easter Bunny and eggs have similar ties.",

    "text": "Photo: Strike on the port of Kavkaz (Russian media) Today, a strike hit the Russian port of Kavkaz in Kuban. As a result, a ferry carrying fuel sank in the port, with 15 crew members on board, SHOT reports. According to a Russian Telegram channel, so far only four crew members of the sunken ferry in the port of Kavkaz, who ended up overboard, have been rescued. In total, there were 15 people on board. The Governor of Krasnodar Krai, Veniamin Kondratyev, stated that the Russians are currently attempting to rescue the other crew members. Strike on Russian port Earlier today, Russian public channels began reporting that smoke was visible over the port of Kavkaz. Soon after, it was confirmed that a strike had hit the port of Kavkaz in Kuban. Initially, Russian authorities claimed that a fuel ferry had been attacked. However, just a few hours later, Russian media, citing local authorities, reported that the fuel ferry had sunk. Notably, this is not the first strike on this port. For instance, at the end of May, Ukraine&#039;s Defense Forces attacked an oil terminal in the vicinity of the port of Kavkaz. At that time, the strike damaged the ferry crossing and the port&#039;s oil terminal. Moreover, there was another attack on the port in July. Recently, drones attacked a ferry vessel in the port of Kavkaz. The General Staff of Ukraine noted that the Russians had been using this ferry for transporting, among other things, railway wagons.",

Sin embargo, hay una oración poderosa que la iglesia Católica propone para conmemorar este día:\nOración para el Viernes Santo\n“Oh, mi Señor Salvador, he venido este día viernes Santo, para revivir el calvario que tus verdugos te propinaron. Fuiste condenado a la crucifixión, simplemente por ser el Hijo hecho carne del Padre Supremo. Despojado de tu ropa, avergonzado y maltratado con piedras, dijiste la verdad y nada más que la verdad. Hoy te suplico que nos perdones por todos los pecados cometidos hacia ti. Cargaste una cruz pesada hasta el lugar donde finalmente serías crucificado al lado de ladrones y asesinos. Culminando con tu Vía Crucis, ofreciste la vida eterna. Ayúdanos a reconocer tu pasión y muerte, y no permitas que nos alejemos de tu sendero. Tú, luz entre las tinieblas, consuelo en el sufrimiento, acompáñanos en nuestro calvario. Queremos ser tan humildes como tú, confiando en que tu sacrificio valió la pena. Amén”.\nCostumbres asociadas al Viernes Santo Durante el Viernes Santo en Colombia, los fieles participan en una variedad de actividades que incluyen:\nLiturgia de la Pasión del Señor: Asisten a esta liturgia que conmemora la muerte de Jesús en la cruz. Veneración de la cruz: Se realiza la solemne adoración de la Cruz , recordando el camino de Cristo hacia el Calvario.

    "text": "(Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department has criminally charged 193 people, including 76 doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, with participating in health care fraud schemes worth $2.75 billion, the agency said on Thursday. The two-week operation ensnared defendants accused of illegally distributing millions of pills of the stimulant Adderall. It also included $176 million in fraudulent schemes involving drug and alcohol abuse treatment, including one defendant accused of billing the federal Medicaid program for treatment that was either inadequate or nonexistent, Attorney General Merrick Garland said. The bust also targeted schemes involving telemedicine, charging 36 defendants accused of collectively submitting over $1.1 billion in false claims to the U.S. Medicare program. “The Justice Department will bring to justice criminals who defraud Americans, steal from taxpayer-funded programs, and put people in danger for the sake of profits,\" Garland said during a press conference. The government seized more than $231 million in cash, luxury vehicles, gold and other assets in the law enforcement action that spanned 32 federal districts. In one scheme, federal prosecutors charged seven people associated with the San Francisco-based telehealth startup Done Global with illegally distributing Adderall, a stimulant used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, commonly known as ADHD. One nurse practitioner at the company was accused of prescribing 1.5 million pills of Adderall while having little interaction with patients. The company's founder and top doctor were charged earlier this month. U.S. officials said fraud schemes may have played a role in well-publicized shortages of Adderall in recent years. A spokesperson for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The investigations were led by the Justice Department's criminal fraud unit and involved the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration. Officials said they have increasingly relied on data analytics to spot fraud schemes that either put patients at risk or cost the U.S. government.
