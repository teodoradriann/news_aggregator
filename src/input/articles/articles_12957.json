    "text": "HOUSTON — As we get closer to the peak of our sun's 11-year solar cycle, solar flares, sun spots, prominences and coronal mass ejections become more likely. It's these coronal mass ejections (CME) that are famous for causing the [Aurora Borealis](/video/news/local/northern-lights-shine-over-texas-panhandle/285-4d1b5c62-6604-49cc-9225-bfb68e4b7b99) to erupt in the sky across our northern latitudes. Just a few days ago, on Oct. 8, our sun produced one of those CMEs -- a big one! This severe solar storm sent a cloud of plasma and charged particles racing directly toward our Earth. NOAA defines this one as a G4-level storm. That's only one level away from the most severe level of G5. The storm will arrive tonight, Oct. 10, and last through the first part of the weekend. It's the kind of geomagnetic storm that can do damage to communication satellites, GPS devices and other electronic infrastructure but also produce a tremendous display of the [Northern Lights](/video/news/local/northern-lights-shine-over-texas-panhandle/285-4d1b5c62-6604-49cc-9225-bfb68e4b7b99). Because of the strength of the storm, skywatchers will be able to see the show across a wider swath of the Northern Hemisphere than usual. That means people as far south as Texas should be able to witness the glow of the Northern Lights. The Northern Lights were visible in the northeast on Thursday night in places they're usually not able to be seen. Will we be able to see them in the Houston area? Well, probably not. Forecasters say you'll have to go to North Texas for the closest chance of catching the show. But folks as far south as Dallas to Wichita Falls to Amarillo have a real shot at seeing the Aurora for the next few nights through Saturday. Now, I personally witnessed the Northern Lights on a camping trip near San Marcos back in 1990. It appeared as a faint red glow in the northern night sky. Nothing spectacular, but it was there. Just knowing I was seeing the Northern Lights in Central Texas was amazing enough! So, if you can get far, far away from the city lights of the Greater Houston area, stay up late and keep an eye on the north. Skies will be very clear, the stars will be out, and you never know when Mother Nature will throw a surprise our way!",

Proponents of the bill point to a $50 billion rural hospital fund. WATCH KATRINA'S STORY BELOW STATEMENT FROM HEARTLAND FAMILY SERVICE “At Heartland Family Service, 82% of our clients make less than $25,000 per year (2023 data). Therefore, Medicaid is essential for many of our clients to be able to access behavioral health services with HFS and physical health services elsewhere. We oppose limiting that access to care because we know how important and life-saving Medicaid can be.” RELATED | Medicaid cuts loom as senate prepares to vote on federal budget bill BROADCAST TRANSCRIPT: I'm Southwest Iowa neighborhood reporter Katrina Markel in Council Bluffs. Half of Iowa Medicaid recipients work full-time; others are permanently disabled adults. Many are children, and there are worries that cuts to that health insurance program could hurt some of the state's most vulnerable citizens. Rep. Josh Turek: \"It's a horrific bill, and every single American should be appalled.\" State Representative Josh Turek uses a wheelchair and has been advocating for changes to Iowa's Medicaid system for years. He was just in Washington D.C. talking to members of Congress about proposed cuts to Medicaid. \"And you're doing all of this to be able to cut the taxes for people that make more than $550,000 a year,\" he said. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation — a large healthcare nonprofit — 600,000 Iowans are on Medicaid, and at least 86,000 Iowans would lose healthcare under the proposed budget cuts. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said on Wednesday that only able-bodied adults will be removed from Medicaid: \"...the fully able-bodied, who are sitting on Medicaid, turning down work. They're going to be going to get work, but they're also going to be getting private insurance, which is better for hospitals than Medicaid.\" Turek points to the large percentage of people on Medicaid who are already working but qualify because they have low income. He's also worried about rural healthcare. \"Over the last five years, we've already lost 31 nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities,\" he said. \"So we’re already talking about a system that is underfunded — with critical shortages oftentimes — and we're talking about making significant cuts to that. It's fundamentally wrong.\" Proponents of the bill point to a $50 billion rural hospital fund. In a statement, a spokesperson for Sen. Joni Ernst told me: \"Senator Ernst will continue to stand up for Iowa's rural hospitals, clinics, and community health centers that serve our state.\" \"We know what's going to end up happening. It's going to be fewer people that are eligible, it's going to be fewer services, fewer providers, and it's going to be longer wait lists,\" said Turek.",

    "title": "US imposes sanctions on Yemen after military threat falls flat",
    "text": "The US has targeted a number of individuals and entities for allegedly helping the flow of financial assistance to Yemen after failing to build a coalition against the country and deter it with military threats. Yemen has lately come on the US radar for hostile measures after seeing the country's armed forces intercept or target Israeli ships or vessels bound for Israeli ports in the Red Sea in a bid to deter Tel Aviv from its ongoing genocide in Gaza. According to a US Treasury statement released on Thursday, the head of the Currency Exchangers Association in Sana’a and three exchange houses in Yemen and Turkey are designated for sanctions. Those targeted were responsible for \"facilitating the flow of financial assistance\" to Yemen's National Salvation Government and the country's Ansarullah movement, it said. The sanctions freeze any US assets belonging to the targeted entities and generally prohibit Americans from doing business with them. Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson accused Ansarullah of conducting dangerous attacks on international shipping and destabilizing the region. “The United States, along with our allies and partners, will continue to target the key facilitation networks that enable the destabilizing activities\" of Ansarullah, it added. In recent weeks, a series of seaborne strikes attributed to the Yemeni forces have been conducted in solidarity with the Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip. Yemen has already warned it will prevent the passage of all ships in the Red Sea bound to the occupied territories. The Bab el-Mandeb Strait is a crucial waterway between Yemen and northeast Africa leading to the Red Sea, up to the Suez Canal and the Israeli port of Eilat. An estimated $1 trillion in goods pass through the strait annually. The European Union earlier agreed to contribute to a US-led coalition against Yemeni armed forces. But in a major setback, France, Spain, and Italy later officially withdrew their participation from the controversial alliance. The three nations have explicitly stated their commitment to operating exclusively under the command of international bodies such as the United Nations, NATO, or the European Union, choosing not to align with the United States. The leader of Ansarullah recently said Yemen's armed forces will not hesitate to target US military warships in the Red Sea if Washington and its allies carry out military strikes against Yemen. Yemenis have declared their open support for Palestine’s struggle against the Israeli occupation since Tel Aviv launched a devastating war on Gaza on October 7 after Palestinian resistance movements carried out a surprise retaliatory attack, dubbed Operation Al-Aqsa Storm. Palestinian resistance movement Hamas has said Yemeni strikes against ships heading to Israel send a message to the West that they should stop the ongoing carnage or expect the crisis to expand across the region.

    "text": "Get ready for yet another GPU shortage, as Nvidia has warned about potential shortages in the current quarter. Although the company’s third-quarter revenue saw a healthy growth, in its recent earnings call , company Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said that the fourth-quarter revenue is expected to decline sequentially due to supply constraints.\nThe anticipated GPU shortage could potentially stem from a strategic shift in production to prepare for the next-generation RTX 50-series “Blackwell” GPUs, slated for release in 2025. This supply transition, coupled with surging gaming and professional use-case demand, seems to have left the company in a tight spot. Nvidia acknowledged its struggle to maintain stock for both gamers and enterprise customers, emphasizing its ongoing efforts to expand manufacturing capacity.\nRecommended Videos For gamers, this warning means longer wait times and potential price surges for Nvidia’s GPUs during the holiday season. Retailers may face limited inventory of RTX 40-series models, especially premium cards like the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 . This challenge arrives as gamers increasingly seek powerful hardware for 4K gaming and emerging AI-enhanced features, making GPU availability crucial.\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox! Privacy Policy Nvidia remains optimistic about a recovery though, projecting improved supply by early 2025 as production ramps up. Analysts note that the company’s dual strategy — balancing gaming and enterprise segments — has proven profitable but may exacerbate short-term shortages. Additionally, the ramp-up to the RTX 50-series could generate renewed interest among gamers, potentially easing pressure on older product lines.\nRelated The hype is real: Nvidia finally teases the RTX 50-series Indiana Jones and the Great Circle proves Nvidia wrong about 8GB GPUs Nvidia may have found a new way to bypass GPU export restrictions Despite these challenges, Nvidia continues to solidify its leadership in both gaming and AI markets. The company’s GPUs remain a cornerstone of the gaming ecosystem and the driving force behind advancements in generative AI technologies. However, gamers should brace for a challenging quarter in obtaining sought-after GPUs until supply levels stabilize.\nOn the positive side, Nvidia’s third-quarter revenue surged 94% year-over-year to $35 billion, with net income rising 109% to $19.3 billion. The data center segment drove this growth, contributing $30.7 billion (87.7% of total revenue), fueled by strong demand for H100/H200 and upcoming Blackwell GPUs.\nEditors’ Recommendations Intel Arc B580 vs. Nvidia RTX 4060: a one-sided showdown Nvidia’s RTX 5090 might be up to 70% faster than its predecessor Don’t bother with GPU deals during Cyber Week. Do this instead Nvidia CEO in 1997: ‘We need to kill Intel’ Nvidia’s next-gen GPU plans could be good news for Intel and AMD",

(ROL) has reported robust financial results for the first quarter of 2025, highlighting a solid start to the year. The company's revenues rose to $823 million, marking a 9.9% increase compared to the same period last year, with organic growth contributing 7.4% of this increase. Despite the negative impact of a stronger dollar reducing revenues by 40 basis points, Rollins maintained impressive growth figures.\nThe company's net income reached $105 million, up 11.5% year-over-year, while earnings per share (EPS) saw a notable rise of 15.8%, settling at $0.22 per diluted share. Additionally, Rollins showcased its financial strength with operating cash flow climbing 15.3% to $147 million.\nRollins' strategic focus on mergers and acquisitions, including the recent acquisition of Saela Holdings, LLC in April, played a significant role in its expansion strategy. This acquisition underscores Rollins' commitment to integrating new businesses and enhancing its service offerings amidst favorable market conditions.\nDespite these achievements, Rollins experienced a minor contraction in its operating margin, which decreased by 40 basis points to 17.3%, partly due to increased fleet expenses and other operational costs. Nonetheless, the company's strategic investments and robust organic growth continue to bolster its market position and future outlook.\nThe financial results for Q1 2025 hint at a strong year ahead for Rollins, as the company continues to capitalize on its diverse portfolio and the expansion of its business through strategic acquisitions.",
