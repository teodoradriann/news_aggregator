    "text": "Kelly Clarkson has recently opened up about her kids’ reaction after relocating from Los Angeles to New York City Season 5. Speaking to PEOPLE, the singer said, “I was very unhappy in L.A. and had been for several years. I needed a fresh start.” “Remington (her son) walked out of the school here and was like, ‘This is the school for me. This is better than the last school. This is where I should be.’ And he’s 7,” said the musician. Kelly continued, “So it’s amazing that work is going well, but as a mom, that’s a win for your kid.” The American Idol alum recounted one moment with her nine-year-old daughter River, stating, “She was wanting a dog so we got one and I was like, ‘Well, what do you want to name her?’ And she was like, ‘I want to name her Charlie because Charlie Brown.” Kelly mentioned, “‘Okay. Well, some people might think that it's a boy.’ And she was like, ‘What do I care what people think?’ I was like, ‘I'm sorry. Say it again and slower.’ I felt like I had succeeded as a parent.” “I was just so proud of him for using all the correct words and not being overwhelmed emotionally. He just said it so clear and calm. I was like, ‘Okay. I could learn something from you today.’ The moments that seem small are really epic,” explained the songstress. Kelly added, “I can be hard on myself, but I think I do a pretty good job. I’m definitely not a helicopter mom.” “I like that they’re independent, but I’m adamant about my schedule, making sure I’m there as much as I can be. There’s no perfect parent; I’m definitely screwing up my children somehow! But I’m doing my best,” she concluded.

    "text": "Scientists Worried As Lifesaving Malaria Drug In Africa Proving Less Effective Malaria is caused by a parasite called Plasmodium falciparum, which spreads through the bite of a mosquito. Edited by: Abhinav Singh Science Nov 15, 2024 09:59 am IST Published On Nov 15, 2024 09:50 am IST Last Updated On Nov 15, 2024 09:59 am IST Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email As the resistance spreads, it could make treating malaria harder. Scientists have warned that the fight against malaria in Africa may have got tougher after a new study found that a lifesaving drug was becoming less effective among children with serious infections. The study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) stated that children had developed resistance to artemisinin - a key malaria drug that rapidly eliminates most malaria parasites in the body. Artemisinin resistance was first identified in southeast Asia in the 2000s but it is the first time it has been identified specifically in children with severe malaria in Africa.\nMalaria is caused by a parasite called Plasmodium falciparum, which spreads through the bite of a mosquito. The World Health Organization's (WHO) 'gold standard' treatment involves the use of a course of pills containing an artemisinin derivative combined with a 'partner' drug that circulates in the body for longer and kills the remaining parasites. These regimens are called artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).\nStudy methodology The study was conducted in Uganda, involving 100 children hospitalised with severe malaria. The test findings showed that 11 of these children had developed partial resistance to artemisinin -- meaning that the parasites were evolving to evade the 'gold standard' malaria treatment. All the children with resistant malaria carried genetic mutations linked to drug resistance.\n\"If this is verified by other studies, it could change guidelines for treatment of severe malaria in African children, and they are the biggest target group by far,\" Chandy John, a specialist in paediatric infectious diseases at Indiana University in Indianapolis and co-author of the study told Nature .\nNotably, another group of ten children in the study had a malaria infection that recurred after their treatment concluded.\n\"What the recurrence suggests to us is that maybe that partner drug is not working as well as it should, because the parasites are coming back,\" said John, adding that recurrence might have been caused by resistance to lumefantrine, a partner drug administered orally during ACT.\nAlso read | Making Mosquitoes Deaf Can Stop Spread Of Dengue, Study Finds\nWhat does it mean? As the resistance spreads, it could make treating malaria harder, especially in a region like Africa which accounted for 95 per cent of the 608,000 malaria-related deaths in 2022.\n\"The emergence of artemisinin partial resistance in Africa is a major threat to malaria control,\" he says. \"We are now only starting to understand what's going on,\" said Philip Rosenthal, a malaria specialist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\"Even if the drug still works, that slower action could make a difference and lead to higher levels of mortality,\" he added.\nShow full article Comments Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world Follow us: Malaria , Africa , Parasite",

    "text": "The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that a California youth soccer coach charged with murdering a 13-year-old soccer player has been identified as an illegal immigrant from El Salvador.\nIn a Monday press release, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office announced that 43-year-old Mario Edgardo Garcia-Aquino had been charged with “one count of murder with the special circumstance allegation of murder during the commission or attempted commission of lewd acts with a child, making him eligible for the death penalty.”\nAccording to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office, Garcia-Aquino allegedly killed 13-year-old Oscar “Omar” Hernandez in Lancaster, California, on March 28.\n“On March 28, the teen was reported missing by his family after he boarded a train to Lancaster to visit Garcia-Aquino and wasn’t heard from again,” Monday’s press release stated. “Garcia-Aquino is accused of killing Oscar and then dumping his body in Oxnard.”\nAccording to Fox News, multiple law enforcement sources told the outlet on Tuesday that the 43-year-old suspect is an illegal immigrant from El Salvador. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security described Garcia-Aquino in a post on X, formerly Twitter, as a “depraved illegal alien who should have never been in this country.”\nFox News reported that Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna confirmed that Garcia-Aquino “was a youth travel soccer coach with the Hurricane Valley Boys Soccer Club in the Sylmar area working with different age divisions” and that he “had no reported criminal history.”\nREAD MORE: Illegal immigrants kill good Samaritan in Los Angeles\nIn a statement obtained by Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin, U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Bilal Essayli said, “This was an avoidable crime and the result of failed border policies. We cannot and will not tolerate illegal aliens who flout our nation’s immigration laws then prey on children.”\nIn an interview on Fox News, Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said that the 13-year-old victim was an “innocent child star soccer player” who “should still be alive today.” McLaughlin told Fox News that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have lodged a detainer against the illegal immigrant suspect; however, she said it was not yet clear whether the detainer would be “honored” due to Los Angeles’ status as a “sanctuary city.”\nMcLaughlin added, “These sanctuary city politicians are playing Russian roulette with the lives of American children and American citizens.”\nIn addition to the murder charge against Garcia-Aquino, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office also announced that the 43-year-old suspect was being charged with one felony count of assault with the intent to commit a sexual offense against a 16-year-old boy in February of 2024 and for one felony count of assault with the intent to commit a sexual offense and lewd act against a 14 or 15-year-old child in December of 2022.",

    "text": "OTTAWA — Israel advocates are asking the Federal Court to reverse Ottawa's decision to continue funding the main United Nations agency supporting Palestinians. The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs is joining Canadians whose relatives were killed in the Hamas attack last October in asking Ottawa to stop funding UNRWA. A notice of application argues that allegations UNRWA staff took part in the October Hamas attack means that the agency falls short of Canada's law on foreign aid, which requires it be provided \"in a manner that is consistent with Canadian values.\" Canada suspended aid to UNRWA in January when the agency declared it was investigating whether some of its staff took part in the attack; Washington has said 12 staff members are being investigated. The Liberals restored the funding in March, citing the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the suspension of all staff under investigation. CIJA says it's unreasonable to restore funding until that investigation concludes. The application also cites Israel's argument that UNRWA has collaborated with Hamas in recent years, which the agency rejects, and it says Canadian funds are legally benefiting a terrorist organization. Lawrence Greenspon brought the application, and says the government can fund humanitarian relief for Palestinians through other agencies. \"Turn the tap back on, but use a different water fountain,\" he said in an interview. UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, is separate from the UN agency serving refugees worldwide, and has long faced criticism from Jewish groups and the Conservatives. They point to social-media statements by the agency’s staff that they argue don't uphold neutrality. Israel has accused hundreds of staff of being members of Hamas in documents that have not been shared publicly. The Harper government cut off Canadian funding for UNRWA in 2010 amid allegations it was too closely tied to Hamas. Advocates for UNRWA say it's the best agency for effectively distributing aid in Gaza, and it maintains the designation of refugee for Palestinians who were displaced by the founding of Israel and their descendants. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly praised UNRWA last November for providing the essentials of life in Gaza, noting it’s \"the only organization able to concretely do this.\" The United Nations says the recent Gaza conflict has killed more than 175 of its aid workers, the most aid workers killed in any conflict in UN history.
