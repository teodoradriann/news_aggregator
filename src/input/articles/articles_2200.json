    "text": "Dana White claims he planned to cut Francis Ngannou from UFC back in 2018: ‘I was going to’ In the latest twist in the saga surrounding UFC CEO, Dana White and recent PFL debutante, [Francis Ngannou](https://www.lowkickmma.com/tag/Francis-Ngannou/) — the promotional leader claimed he had planned to cut the Batie native from his contractual obligations back in 2018 following his decision loss to former title challenger, Derrick Lewis. Ngannou, a former undisputed heavyweight champion under the banner of the UFC, made his PFL debut over the course of last weekend, turning in [a dominant opening round knockout win over Brazilian contender, Renan Ferreira](https://www.lowkickmma.com/pfl-founder-francis-ngannou-surpassed-ufc/) in his first venture to the SmartCage. And sidelined from mixed martial arts for two years before his debut against Ferreira, Cameroonian knockout artist, Francis Ngannou landed a unanimous decision win over then-interim champion, [Ciryl Gane](https://www.lowkickmma.com/tag/ciryl-gane/), handing the Frenchman his first professional loss in the pair’s title unification pairing.

Francis left because he knew that if he fought [Jon Jones](http://lowkickmma.com/tag/jon-jones) and didn’t win, it would hurt his chances of making the money that he wanted to make. But realistically, his deal was bigger here. His deal was bigger here if he stayed in the UFC. … They can deny it all they want, why the f*ck would I lie? Why do I care? It doesn’t matter to me one way or the other. “I was going to cut Francis when he lost two in a row,” White continued. “I was going to cut him. Somebody around here begged me not to do it. So it wouldn’t have mattered to me, one way or the other. There’s a much deeper story to this whole thing and he would have made more money if he stayed in the UFC.”",

    "title": "A New Generation of Catholics Discovers Latin Mass 60 Years After Vatican II",
    "text": "Growing up in a rural enclave in western Pennsylvania, Gina McNulty regularly attended Catholic Mass with her family each Sunday. But something always felt missing about the experience, McNulty said — something she could not put her finger on until a few years ago when she and her husband, Steven, began attending a traditional Latin Mass at the Most Precious Blood of Jesus parish a 20 minute-drive away in Pittsburgh.\nAdvertisement Initially the couple and their children worshipped at Most Precious Blood only occasionally — their regular parish was just a short stroll away. But by the time the couple had their third child three years ago, they started attending weekly. Now expecting her fifth kid, McNulty says she feels deeply connected with the ancient ritual that is Latin Mass.\n“My husband was definitely the driving force behind it,” McNulty, 35, said, of their shift to Latin Mass. “There are people who are interested in the Latin Mass, that are drawn to it because of the intellectual aspect of it,” she said. “But there are people like me who are drawn to it for the beauty.”\nDating back to at least the 15th century, Latin Mass is rich, mysterious, strictly arranged and (as its name suggests) conducted entirely in Latin. Also known as the Tridentine Mass, McNulty said it offers a direct connection to the scores of generations of Catholics who came before her.\nThe service certainly feels ancient, like a journey through space and time. Rather than facing his congregants, for instance, the priest conducts the mass with his back to them. He’s facing the Eucharist — the symbolic body and blood of Christ himself and the central act of Christian worship. There are also plumes of incense floating through the nave, while both Gregorian chants and periods of profound silence help instill within worshippers the mass’s history and significance.\nAdvertisement Latin Mass was the standard service given by Catholic churches worldwide until the mid-1960s, when it was abolished as part of the Second Vatican Council in an effort to make the religion more accessible to the modern world.\nWithin months, the majority of Catholic parishes were conducting Sunday services in their local languages, while those Gregorian chants were replaced by guitar-playing and folk singers. Most crucially, a parish priest could now face his worshippers.\nBut the traditional Latin Mass never completely vanished; today of the 17,000 Catholic parishes in the United States, 592 of them perform the extraordinary form in Latin — including at least six in New York City and four (including Most Precious Blood) in Western Pennsylvania.\nCanon William Avis — a church cleric who was formally installed as the first pastor of Most Precious Blood of Jesus Parish in 2019 — said their services have seen robust growth over the past few years. “We have 800 to 850 at our Masses on Sunday,” he said.\nThat robust growth isn’t just taking place in Pittsburgh — it’s happening nationwide. A recent survey by Crisis Magazine, an independent journal covering Catholicism and Catholic issues, revealed a marked increase in TLM attendance since the beginning of the pandemic. This boom is playing out against a backdrop of recent restrictions on the Latin Mass from Pope Francis. Last year, the Argentine-born pontiff described Latin Mass as “divisive” and imposed new limits on the service, which had been partially reintroduced over the past three decades by both of his predecessors, Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI.\nAdvertisement In June of this year, Francis went even further, demanding the faithful stop exploiting Latin Mass for ideological reasons, which he feared might fracture the very unity of the Catholic Church. Francis was harshly criticized by many young traditionalists for his stance, some of whom took to Twitter in outrage.\nThose worshippers included 26-year-old Brendon Miller-Boldt, who along with his wife, Elizabeth, and their two young children, also attend Latin mass at the Most Precious Blood parish in Pittsburgh. A Minnesota native studying in the Ph.D. Computer Science program at nearby Carnegie Mellon University, Miller-Boldt said he was drawn to Latin Mass for its solemnity, reverence and mystery. “Just the atmosphere, the willingness to have a space that doesn’t feel like it’s as kind of trying to meet the broader American culture halfway; something that’s willing to stick to its roots was a big difference,” he explained.\n“While there is nothing egregiously wrong with (our local parish), it wasn’t as conducive to worship as what we found when we visited Most Precious Blood,” Miller-Boldt said. “The integration with the community definitely feels more vibrant.”\nMany of the East Coast and Midwestern parishes where Latin Masses are still conducted are majestic and ancient in design, often built during the great European immigration wave of the 20th century and tucked into old ethnic working-class neighborhoods where most of the parishioners once lived, worked and worshipped.\nAdvertisement They’re parishes like Most Precious Blood — which is filled each Sunday with hundreds of children, most of whom also attend weekly religious education programs in the adjoining elementary school. Canon Avis says that people are initially drawn to the liturgy for its sheer beauty, “especially the high mass where you have Gregorian chants, the incense and all ritual.”\nBoth the McNulty and Miller-Boldt families planned on attending Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve, a solemn ceremony where parishioners hold candles and sing carols as the church’s lights are dimmed in salute to the majesty of the birth of Christ.\nThey’re rites, observed Canon Avis, performed today much as they have been for centuries. “Latin Mass has developed through history since the time of the Apostles,” he said, “so it kind of gives a certain sense of foundation, of roots. It’s something that it’s not just going to randomly change.”\nSalena\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "STOMP it anytime, anywhere.\nDownload the new STOMP app today.\nTabla\nFeb 14, 2025\nWith almost 16,000 devotees participating in Thaipusam on Feb 11 – an increase from previous years – many of them experienced delays at the Tank Road temple.\nMs Saritha Rajaraman, 40, who carried a paal kudam, said there was some confusion over queues for participants at the Sri Thendayuthapani Temple. “This led to overcrowding and caused some tired devotees to lose their composure,” she added.\nThis year’s event drew some 30,000 visitors – a 12,000 increase from last year.\nHome Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam, who was guest of honour at the festival, commended the arrangements, but noted that “something can be done” about the long waiting periods to enter the temple in Tank Road.\nSpeaking to reporters on the sidelines, Mr Shanmugam said: “Quite a few people mentioned that they were waiting for a very long time. The elderly and those carrying milk said they had been waiting for two, 2½, even three hours.”\nMr Shanmugam said he met with the management of both temples involved to discuss possible solutions.\n“The main issue is that when people come in front of the deity at the sanctum, they want to spend some time. If they are asked to leave quickly – after having waited for hours – they understandably want at least four or five minutes. You can imagine if 10 people spend five minutes each, that’s an hour.”\nHe added: “The two temples, the Hindu Endowments Board, as well as the management of the Tank Road temple, will need to come together to explore solutions – perhaps using technology or releasing people in batches.”\nRemarking that he does not yet know “what is feasible”, he said he would speak with the authorities to see what could be done.\n[Thaipusam] Every year, schedule permitting, I try and go for the Thaipusam festival. I usually go to the Perumal...\nIn a joint statement by Sri Thendayuthapani Temple, Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple, and Hindu Endowments Board, a spokesperson said: “We acknowledge the comments made by Mr Shanmugam on the importance of reducing wait time to improve the experience during Thaipusam.\n“We recognise that many devotees faced prolonged wait times to reach the sanctum to fulfil their vows. We deeply appreciate their patience and devotion.\n“To address this, we will conduct a thorough review of this year’s Thaipusam arrangements, analysing both the ground logistics and operational challenges. Feedback will be sought from devotees and other stakeholders to help us identify areas for improvement.\n“The safety, well-being, and comfort of all devotees remain our highest priority. We are committed to improving the Thaipusam experience while preserving its significance as a sacred and meaningful celebration.”",

The deadline for submission of proposals is until August 31, 2024.\nThree (3) proposals will be announced as global winners by December 2024.\nShown here are (from left) Roberto N. Galang, Ph.D (Dean, Ateneo School of Management), Raphael A. Guerrero, Ph.D (Dean, Ateneo School of Science and Engineering), Alex Lai (Director, Taiwan External Trade Development Council, Manila), Christine Kuo (Manager, Taiwan External Trade Development Council, Manila), Faye Martinez (Director, Philippine Marketing Association). To generate awareness about the initiative in the corporate sector and the academe, Go Green with Taiwan partnered with two reputable institutions, the Philippine Marketing Association (PMA) and the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU).\n“ We are incredibly grateful to Ateneo de Manila University and the Philippine Marketing Association for partnering with us in this purposeful program in the Philippines. Together, we can empower Filipino minds and intelligence that not only benefit the Philippines but serve as a beacon of hope for a greener future on a global scale ,” says Director Alex Lai from the Taiwan External Trade Development Council Manila.\nLai likewise invited Filipinos to unleash their creativity by joining Go Green with Taiwan. “ We are eager to see how you turn ideas into action. Let’s go green, innovate, and let’s build a brighter future, together ,” he added.\nRoberto Galang, the Dean for Ateneo School of Management, representing Ateneo de Manila University, said the initiative perfectly aligns with Ateneo’s unwavering commitment to environmental responsibility, as embodied in the university’s “Laudato Si’ Plan of 2022-2029.”\n“ The ‘Go Green with Taiwan’ competition is aligned with the profound mission of Ateneo. It ignites the spark of creativity in young minds, inspiring them to bridge the gap between environmental sustainability and economic progress. Imagine Filipino ingenuity combined with cutting-edge solutions from Taiwan, a global leader in green technology! This is the kind of collaboration that can truly propel us towards a brighter future ,” Galang pointed out.\nGalang also reminded those who will submit proposals, that they are not just competing but also becoming architects of a greener future. “ So, let’s work together to turn ideas into action, and build a world where environmental responsibility and technological innovation go hand-in-hand .”\nFaye Martinez, Director of the Philippine Marketing Association, said that the Go Green with Taiwan campaign isn’t just about sustainability but also about unlocking a future brimming with innovation.\n“ Sustainability doesn’t have to be a burden – it can be an engine for growth. This is where the campaign comes in. It’s an opportunity for all of us, as seasoned marketing practitioners, to unleash our creativity and develop groundbreaking ideas to save the environment. Let’s go and influence the brilliant minds in this room to come up with innovative solutions that seamlessly integrate environmental sustainability into various business models across the Philippines ,” explains Martinez of PMA.\n“ Remember, the future is green, and the power to shape it lies in our creative hands.

    "text": "Voilà trois ans que Céline et Clément Baudrand ont rejoint le casting de l’émission Familles nombreuses, la vie en XXL, diffusée sur TF1. [Leur intention est claire dès le départ : se marier](/tvactu/articles/article-1000101474.html) en présence de toutes les personnes qui comptent le plus à leurs yeux et notamment de [leur clan recomposé de huit enfants](/tvactu/articles/article-1000086298.html). Les débuts de la cérémonie tant attendue ont été diffusés sur la première chaîne ce mercredi 17 septembre. \"Ça fait deux ans et demi qu'on attend ce jour-là et c'était encore mieux, encore plus beau que ce que j'avais imaginé. Nos huit enfants assis, les trois petites qui sont là, émerveillées. Ça fait des mois et des mois qu'on prépare ça et voilà, on y est\", s’est enthousiasmée la mère de famille. Cependant, quelques minutes plus tard, un problème inattendu a conduit à l'interruption du mariage. Clément Baudrand proche du malaise en pleine cérémonie de mariage Tandis que le prêtre récitait ses textes, Clément Baudrand a été pris d’un coup de chaud. \"En plein milieu de la cérémonie, je commence à me sentir pas bien. Je commence à avoir des fourmis dans les jambes, à avoir mon champ de vision qui se rétrécit : symptômes du malaise vagal. Je me dis pas maintenant, c'est pas possible !\", a-t-il confié face aux caméras de TF1. Après avoir essuyé son front avec un mouchoir, il a dû quitter l’autel pour s’asseoir… L’épisode de Familles nombreuses, la vie en XXL s’est terminé là, laissant les téléspectateurs sur leur faim. Céline et Clément Baudrand sont enfin mariés Ce jeudi 19 septembre, les fans du programme étaient donc nombreux devant leur poste pour assister, enfin, aux vœux des Baudrand.

C’est l’union de nos deux âmes, c'est notre amour et c’est à vie\", a confié Céline Baudrand avant d’ajouter : \"Tu te sens encore plus fort et plus amoureux que jamais. Là, tu te dis que c’est pas aujourd'hui que tu vas te prendre le chou pour des broutilles\". Clément Baudrand a également manifesté sa joie : \"Maintenant on est mariés. Notre famille est officiellement recomposée. C’est énormément de joie parce que ça veut dire que toute notre aventure, toutes nos envies communes, on a bien fait de faire tout ça. C’est du bonheur\".

    "text": "1 2 Jaipur: Water resources minister Suresh Singh Rawat acknowledged in the state Assembly that polluted water from Ludhiana was being discharged into the Sutlej River, which eventually flows into Rajasthan through the Indira Gandhi Canal, Sirhind Feeder, and Bikaner Canal, but he assured that before reaching households in Rajasthan, including in Sriganganagar, the water undergoes a filtration and treatment process.\n\"A total of 313 rural and seven urban drinking water projects in the district use sedimentation tanks, slow sand filters, and rapid gravity filters. Further, chlorination is done using chlorine gas and bleaching powder to make the water bacteria-free before distribution,\" said Rawat.\nIn response to a written question from Congress MLA Rupinder Singh Kooner on the issue of residents of Sriganganagar consuming polluted water, Rawat said 57 sewage treatment plants (STPs) had been constructed in the Sutlej River's catchment area to address pollution, and they were being continuously monitored.\nKooner raised concerns about the health hazards caused by polluted water, including skin diseases, renal failure, and cancer in Sriganganagar district. Rawat said the govt was aware of the issue and was in communication with its counterparts in Punjab.\n\"Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) was informed about the major sources of pollution, and directives were issued to increase the capacity of sewage treatment plants and ensure their full utilisation. Strict measures have also been taken to prevent untreated sewage from being discharged into the Sutlej River,\" Rawat said.\nRawat informed the House that \"A Real-Time Water Quality Monitoring System has been installed at RD 368.50 on the Bikaner Canal at the Rajasthan-Punjab border. This system continuously tracks critical water parameters such as pH levels, turbidity, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chlorides.\"\nStay updated with breaking news , weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march .\nEnd of Article FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Tired of too many ads? go ad free now Trending Stories In City Entire Website Tired of too many ads? go ad free now",

    "text": "A brief cloudburst in several localities of the city on Friday evening brought traffic in the western part of the city to a snail pace, stranding commuters on the road. It rained between three and six cm in over half an hour in a few areas. Madhapur and Gachibowli recorded the highest rainfall at close to six cm, followed by Chandanagar at four cm. Linampally, Borabanda, Hafeezpet, Balajinagar, Kukatpally and Miyapur, too, were pounded by rain. A light drizzle in other areas of the city brought residents relief from the scorching heat of the day. Traffic slowed down on several stretches in Kothaguda, Gachibowli, Kondapur, Madhapur, Lingampally and other areas of northern and western parts of the city, due to flooding. “Big rain and there will be big ponds on the roads of our #Hyderabad no matter where. This is in the highly elite Gachibowli at AIG Hospital. The water level is so scary all the cars are simply stopping and with great trepidation crossing the big pond only after the car ahead crossed over! #Hyderabadrains I was very scared whether my car will stall in the middle of the pond but had no option but to take the plunge, pun deliberate!” posted a user Arunn Bhagavathula on ‘X’. Traffic police personnel stepped in to clear the stagnant water in some places. The Cyberabad Traffic Police posted a clip on their social media account in which they were seen opening a manhole to drain the water. No worker of the GHMC or the Disaster Response Force was seen in the clip. Published - November 01, 2024 08:26 pm IST",

    "text": "Storm Gerrit unleashed chaos across the United Kingdom, leaving a trail of severe damage in its wake. The storm, characterised by high winds, heavy snow, and relentless rain, struck with unparalleled force, resulting in damaged homes, cancelled transportation services and widespread power outages.The Liberal Democrats, in the wake of the devastation caused by a \"localised tornado\" in Greater Manchester, have called on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to convene a Cobra meeting. The tornado, which damaged approximately 100 properties, has thrown hundreds of lives into chaos, particularly affecting those whose homes were destroyed just after Christmas.Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat transport spokesperson, highlighted the urgency of the situation, stating: \"Rishi Sunak needs to call an urgent Cobra meeting to ensure a swift, robust recovery plan so those affected can begin rebuilding their lives.\"Hobhouse pointed out that any delay in action could have a devastating impact on families already displaced, whose lives have been turned upside down by this unexpected disaster.Storm Gerrit's impact on transportation has been profound, with British Airways cancelling more than 20 flights to and from Heathrow on Thursday. The storm's disruptive force has not spared ferry services either, with warnings of delays and cancellations affecting routes to the Hebrides, France and the Isle of Wight. This further compounds the challenges faced by individuals trying to navigate their way through the aftermath of the storm.An inspection of the damage revealed that major rail lines remained closed across the country. Scotrail, in an announcement on Thursday, confirmed the continued closure of significant routes, including those between Aberdeen and Edinburgh, Glasgow to Oban and Edinburgh to Dundee.The persistence of these disruptions underscores the extensive challenges faced by the transportation sector in the wake of Storm Gerrit, hindering the restoration of normalcy for those who rely on these vital services.The coastal areas of Scotland bore the brunt of Storm Gerrit, with wind speeds reaching a staggering 80 miles (128 kilometres) per hour.Falling branches and debris severed utility lines, plunging thousands of households into darkness. The severity of the storm was exemplified in Tameside, where a tornado tore roofs off houses and demolished walls. Residents described the scene as a \"whirlwind of madness\", with trees falling like dominoes, leaving chaos and destruction in their wake.Greater Manchester Police declared a major incident as approximately 100 homes in Tameside faced significant damage. Local resident Kerry Hogan vividly described the pandemonium, stressing the sheer bedlam that unfolded.Reports emerged of trees crashing into homes, with one woman recounting a terrifying incident where a tree fell into her bathroom. Miraculously, there were no reported injuries caused by the tornado, a testament to the resilience and preparedness of the affected communities.As Storm Gerrit swept through Wales and Scotland, leaving destruction in its path, the National Grid reported a staggering 36,000 properties without electricity in Ceredigion. A lightning strike had compromised part of the network, exacerbating the challenges faced by utility workers. In Scotland, nearly 14,000 homes were left without power overnight, amplifying the difficulties in the storm's aftermath.Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) worked tirelessly to restore power, with around 34,000 customers regaining electricity by 11 am on Thursday. Graeme Keddie, the Director of Corporate Affairs at SSEN, highlighted the obstacles faced by repair teams, including blocked roads, flooded fields and snow-related issues. Despite the challenges, significant progress was made, offering hope to the communities grappling with the aftermath of Storm Gerrit.Storm Gerrit disrupted transportation networks, with heavy snow in Scotland bringing the main artery through the Highlands to a standstill. The A9, a vital route, witnessed stranded motorists enduring hours of delay at a remote mountain pass. Police Scotland confirmed the reopening of the A9 on Thursday, urging caution for those navigating the still challenging conditions.The Met Office, which had named Storm Gerrit earlier in the week, issued eight weather alerts on Wednesday. Snowfall, rain and high winds created hazardous travel conditions, prompting law enforcement to advise extra caution for all road users.The occurrence of Storm Gerrit against the backdrop of Britain's hottest year on record raises questions about the broader implications of climate change . The Met Office notes that rising temperatures, driven by climate change, have contributed to 2023 being the hottest year in the country's recorded history. December, while unusually mild and wet, has not broken records but has seen a 20 per cent increase in overall rainfall for Britain and a 40 per cent surge in Northern England.The average temperature this December has been 1.6 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than the historical average, with temperatures hovering around 42 degrees Fahrenheit.© Copyright IBTimes 2023.
