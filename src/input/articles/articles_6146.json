    "text": "Thiruvananthapuram: Pothencode block panchayat officials were honoured by RCC additional director Dr Sajid for organising cancer control programme ‘First Check' within its jurisdiction. The programme is being conducted in collaboration with Regional Cancer Centre RCC as part of its comprehensive cancer control plan.The project involves organising cancer detection camps in various parts of the panchayat and ensuring follow-up examinations for those diagnosed or identified with potential cancer, facilitating timely treatment and preventing the disease from becoming severe.The camps primarily focus on the early detection of cancers in the cervix, breast, and mouth. Individuals diagnosed or identified with potential cancer during the monthly camps will be referred to RCC for specialist examinations. Over the past three years, approximately 4,000 women were screened in 33 camps conducted.The ceremony held at the RCC conference hall was presided over by Dr Kalavathi M C from the RCC community oncology department and was attended by Pothencode block panchayat president Hariprasad T R, vice president Anija K S, secretary Veena Babu, standing committee chairman R Anil Kumar, RCC community oncology department head Dr Jiji Thomas, Dr Jayakrishnan R, and deputy medical superintendents Dr Sugeeth M T and Dr Rona Joseph.",

    "title": "Scientists Have Found The Driving Force Behind Your Darkest Impulses",
    "text": "Psychologists call it the\ndark triad: an intersection of three of the most malevolent tendencies of human nature – [psychopathy](psychopath-capital-of-the-us-according-science-states-ranked-washington-dc), [narcissism](we-might-have-been-wrong-about-what-s-going-on-inside-narcissists-agentic-implicit-esteem-mask), and Machiavellianism.\nBut the truth goes deeper, and darker. There's also egoism, sadism, spitefulness, and more. And behind this rogues gallery of all our worst inclinations on the surface, a central, common core of human darkness lies, researchers say.\nIn a 2018 study, psychologists from Germany and Denmark mapped this driving force behind all our darkest impulses and gave it a name. Meet D, the newly identified Dark Factor of Personality.\nThe theoretical framework of the D factor has its underpinnings in what's known as the\ng factor): a construct proposed by English psychologist Charles Spearman over a century ago when he observed that individuals who performed well on one kind of cognitive test were more likely to score well on other kinds of intelligence tests, too.\nIn other words, a 'general intelligence factor' could be measured. But it turns out that's not all scientists are able to detect.\n\"In the same way, the dark aspects of human personality also have a common denominator, which means that – similar to intelligence – one can say that they are all an expression of the same dispositional tendency,\"\nexplained psychologist Ingo Zettler from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark back in September 2018.\nIn a series of four separate studies involving over 2,500 participants, Zettler and fellow researchers surveyed participants with questions designed to measure their levels of nine distinct dark personality traits: egoism, Machiavellianism, moral disengagement, narcissism, psychological entitlement, psychopathy, sadism, self-interest, and spitefulness.\nTo do so, participants were asked to disagree with a range of variable 'dark' statements, such as: \"I know that I am special because everyone keeps telling me so\", \"I'll say anything to get what I want\", \"It is hard to get ahead without cutting corners here and there\", and \"Hurting people would be exciting\".\nWith all the responses in hand, researchers ran a statistical analysis, with the results suggesting that while these dark traits are all distinct, they all overlap to some extent, owing to the central core darkness factor, D, which reveals itself in different ways in different people.\n\"In a given person, the D factor can mostly manifest itself as narcissism, psychopathy or one of the other dark traits, or a combination of these,\"\nZettler said.\n\"But with our mapping of the common denominator of the various dark personality traits, one can simply ascertain that the person has a high D factor. This is because the D factor indicates how likely a person is to engage in behavior associated with one or more of these dark traits.\"\nIt's pretty provocative stuff, but you don't just have to take the researchers' word for it: You can take the D test yourself.\nThe team set up an\nonline portal where you can measure your own D score via a questionnaire.\nWhy would people want to know? Well, apart from personal curiosity about how dark you really are, the researchers said their findings could one day lead to new discoveries in psychology and therapy, advancing our understanding of how we interpret people's malevolent actions.\n\"We see it, for example, in cases of extreme violence, or rule-breaking, lying, and deception in the corporate or public sectors,\"\nZettler said.\n\"Here, knowledge about a person's D-factor may be a useful tool, for example, to assess the likelihood that the person will re-offend or engage in more harmful behavior.\"\nThe findings were reported in\nPsychological Review.\nAn earlier version of this article was published in September 2018.",

    "text": "ISLAMABAD : Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Chaudhry Salik Hussain has urged the Hajj welfare staff (Moavineen-e-Hujjaj) to perform their responsibilities with devotion as serving the pilgrims is a sacred duty.\nHe said this on the occasion of orientation sessions held by the Hajj mission for supporting staff in Makkah to make them aware of assisting pilgrims during the Hajj days.\nEmphasizing the need for effective communication, the minister suggested that guides fluent in various Pakistani languages should be deployed to assist pilgrims visiting the Haram Sharif for Umrah or prayers. “This move would enhance the experience of pilgrims and help them navigate the area with comfort, given Pakistan’s multicultural nature with language diversity,” he added.\nHe urged the supporting staff to ensure that the pilgrims should be provided with the best possible facilities and services during their stay for Hajj, showing compassion and empathy towards them in addition to their duties.\nThe minister noted that properly marked and men-supported bus pick-up points could facilitate the transportation of pilgrims to and from their residences. He urged guides to be proactive in guiding pilgrims to the right ways towards their destinations, ensuring they were readily available to assist those who may feel distracted or lost on their way to their residences.\nIt is important to note that over four hundred members of Hajj welfare staff currently performing duties in transport, accommodation, and food departments, have already received orientation sessions to prepare them for their roles during the Hajj days.",

    "text": "Eclipse viewers can now donate their glasses to others around the world On Thursday, Moshe Gai, an astronomy professor at UConns’ Avery Point campus, still raved about the spectacular views he saw of the total solar eclipse in northern Vermont. “It was the best I have ever seen, out of four so far,” Gai said about Monday’s eclipse. Gai, also a member of the Thames Amateur Astronomical Society, was part of a second historic event on Monday as well, as eclipse watchers created one of the worst traffic jams in Vermont history. Gai left his Branford home at 7 a.m. for the normally 4 ½-hour drive to the farm in Newford, Vt. owned by former physics student Tristan Kading. He arrived shortly after 3 p.m., just 15 minutes before the eclipse totality and 8 hours after he left home. The drive back to his hotel in White River Junction was even worse, as Vermont officials estimated more than 160,000 visitors trekked to what was forecast to be some of the best weather for the total eclipse. “It was worth every minute of this ride,” Gai said. Now, days later, Gai and many others still have those cardboard framed, dark film lens viewing glasses they used on Monday on their kitchen counters, tables and bureaus. Gai warned against stowing the glasses in a drawer to await the next solar eclipse years from now. The film in the eclipse viewing glasses deteriorates over time, developing tiny pinholes not visible to the naked eye. But those tiny holes could damage the eyes if users looked at the sun. Nationwide eclipse glasses collection drives underway Two organizations, [Astronomers Without Borders](https://astronomerswithoutborders.org/programs/solar-glasses-distribution) and [Eclipse Glasses USA](https://eclipse23.com/pages/donate-eclipse-glasses), have launched eclipse glasses collection drives nationwide. The groups will inspect the glasses to make sure they are in good condition and send them to schools and groups at sites around the world where solar eclipses can be viewed in the coming months. Locally, Otis Library, 261 Main St., Norwich, and the Norwich recreation center, 75 Mohegan Road, Norwich, will collect eclipse glasses for donation. Glasses in good condition can be dropped off at the front desk during library and recreation department hours. Idis Andino, administration specialist for Norwich Human Services Youth, Family and Recreation division, said she and library Executive Director Cathleen Special worked to set up the collection. Andino said the glasses will be collected through April 19 at both the library and the recreation center and will be mailed to Eclipse Glasses USA on April 22, Earth Day. “We thought that would be an appropriate day to send them,” Andino said. Astronomers Without Borders does not have a direct collection center in eastern Connecticut, but the California-based organization has partnered with eyeglasses company Warby Parker to collect eclipse glasses. The company has store locations in Darien, Greenwich, Norwalk, Farmington and New Haven. “Astronomers Without Borders has been sending solar glasses for annular and total solar eclipse since 2008,” the group posted on its website, astronomerswithoutborders.org. “From Africa, Asia, North and South America, our members, partners and National Coordinators helped to bring glasses to people who may not otherwise have a safe way to view the eclipse directly.” Eclipse Glasses USA plans to send glasses it collects to Central America for an eclipse viewing this August. The organization will accept glasses mailed to its Utah office until Aug. 1. Package glasses in a padded envelope and send to Eclipse Glasses USA, P.O. Box 50571, Provo, UT 84605. If the recent solar eclipse experience sparked an interest for viewers in the day or night sky, the Thames Amateur Astronomical Society welcomes new enthusiasts. Club member R. M. “Max” Maxwell of Groton said the group has about a dozen active and interactive members and more than 60 people on its email group list. The club partners with UConn Avery Point in September for night sky viewing sessions every Wednesday that has good weather and either no moon or up to a quarter moon. Gai said the events are very popular, sometimes with 100 attendees. Announcements of the events will be placed in The Day in advance, Gai said. The club also collaborates with Mystic Seaport Museum for programs at the museum’s planetarium, where Maxwell is a part-time staffer.

    "text": "Alrededor de 33.000 trabajadores de Boeing (NYSE: BA ) abandonaron sus puestos de trabajo la medianoche del viernes, hora del Pacífico (8:00h CEST), tras votar a favor de ir a la huelga el jueves. Este es el último golpe al fabricante de aviones, que se enfrenta a problemas financieros y de reputación .\nLa Asociación Internacional de Maquinistas y Trabajadores de la Industria Aeroespacial (IAM) ha comunicado que sus miembros han rechazado un contrato que habría supuesto un aumento salarial del 25% en cuatro años.\nEl sindicato añadió que el 94,6% había votado a favor de rechazar el contrato, mientras que el 96% había votado a favor de la huelga. Sólo se necesitaba una mayoría de dos tercios para que la huelga siguiera adelante.\nLos dirigentes sindicales habían aconsejado inicialmente a sus afiliados que aceptaran el contrato , propuesto a principios de esta semana.\nAdemás de aumentar los salarios, el acuerdo habría mantenido la construcción del próximo avión comercial de Boeing en la zona de Seattle, siempre que el proyecto se iniciara antes de que finalizara el contrato.\nSin embargo, los trabajadores están enfadados por el estancamiento de los salarios y las concesiones que han hecho desde 2008 en materia de pensiones y asistencia sanitaria. Sostienen que han renunciado a ventajas a lo largo de los años para evitar que la empresa traslade puestos de trabajo a otros lugares.\n\"Se trata de respeto, de abordar el pasado y de luchar por nuestro futuro\" , declaró Jon Holden, presidente del Distrito 751 de la IAM, al anunciar la votación. Boeing subrayó que estaba \"dispuesta a volver a la mesa para alcanzar un nuevo acuerdo\" tras la votación.\n\"El mensaje era claro: el acuerdo provisional que alcanzamos con la dirección de la IAM no era aceptable para los miembros. Seguimos comprometidos a restablecer nuestra relación con nuestros empleados y el sindicato\", afirmó la empresa en un comunicado.\nLa huelga hace caso omiso de un ruego de última hora del nuevo director ejecutivo de Boeing, Kelly Ortberg , nombrado el mes pasado.\nJusto antes de la votación, advirtió a los trabajadores de que la huelga pondría \"en peligro la recuperación\" de la empresa, añadiendo que \"nadie gana\" con una huelga.\nMuy pocas cosas le han ido bien a Boeing este año, desde la explosión de un panel en uno de sus aviones de pasajeros en enero, hasta el hecho de que la NASA dejara a dos astronautas en el espacio en lugar de enviarlos a casa en una nave espacial de Boeing con problemas.\nMientras continúe la huelga, Boeing se verá privada del tan necesario dinero que obtiene de la entrega de nuevos aviones a las compañías aéreas.\nLa última huelga de los trabajadores de Boeing podría afectar a la entrega de aviones",
