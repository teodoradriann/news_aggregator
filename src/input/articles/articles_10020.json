    "text": "Group of Palestinian-Americans skip Blinken meeting over Biden admin’s support for Israel’s offensive in Gaza By Jennifer Hansler, and Khalil Abdallah, CNN (CNN) — A number of Palestinian-Americans refused to attend a roundtable meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday to discuss the [situation in Gaza](https://www.cnn.com/world/middleeast/israel) in protest against the Biden administration’s ongoing support for Israel’s offensive in the war-torn strip – a military campaign that has exacted a massive humanitarian toll. “We do not know what more Secretary Blinken or President (Joe) Biden need to hear or see to compel them to end their complicity in this genocide,” several of those who rejected the invitation said in a press statement distributed by the non-profit Institute for Middle East Understanding (IMEU). “They show us every day whose lives they value and whose lives they consider disposable. We will not be attending this discussion which can only amount to a box-ticking exercise. Our families, our community and all Palestinians deserve better,” the signatories wrote. “There is one thing that we, our community and countless others around the US and the world, including American unions representing nearly 8 million workers and at least 47 US cities, have been asking of this administration: to demand a permanent ceasefire to save Palestinians lives and stop the destruction of Gaza,” they wrote. “A meeting of this nature at this moment in time is insulting and performative.” Blinken and other members of the Biden administration have [called on Israel to do more to protect civilian](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/07/politics/blinken-israel-middle-east-tensions/index.html)s and allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. The officials, however, have continually rejected the idea of a ceasefire, instead advocating for “humanitarian pauses.” Thursday’s meeting with Blinken comes amid continued outrage from many progressive Democrats, Muslim and younger voters about the administration’s handling of Gaza – opposition that poses a growing political problem for Biden. The refusal of several invitees to attend underscores the immense anger felt by many in the United States – including some within the federal government – over the toll from the conflict, which was launched following [Hamas’ brutal attack](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/09/middleeast/hamas-attack-strategy-israel-mime-intl/index.html) on Israel on October 7. More than 26,000 have been killed, hundreds of thousands have been displaced, and Gaza is on the brink of famine. More than 200 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the offensive. Six people did attend the meeting, a source familiar told CNN, and those who attended felt conflicted about doing so, but felt they should take advantage of the opportunity to speak to the need for urgent change in US policy toward Gaza. ‘Soul-searching’ One of the invitees to the roundtable, Dr. Tariq Haddad, said in an intensely personal, 12-page letter to Blinken that he initially intended to go to the meeting. However, “after a lot of soul-searching I have decided that I cannot in good conscience meet with you today knowing this administration’s policies have been responsible for the death of over 80 of my family members including dozens of children, the suffering of hundreds of my remaining family, the famine my family is currently subjected to and the destruction of all my family’s homes,” Haddad wrote in the letter. “The more I thought about this meeting, the more I could not emotionally bring myself to look you in the eyes, Secretary Blinken, knowing you and President Biden have knowingly contributed to the suffering and murder of so many of my family, the homelessness and dispossession of 2 million Gazans, and the famine that has befallen my remaining family members,” Haddad said. “How does one meet for what I was told would be 3 minutes, with a person you hold responsible for not just the killing of your child, but rather the murder of over 80 of your family members?” he asked in his letter. “How do I look you in the eyes knowing you couldn’t even do the basic minimum like calling for a ceasefire to end the suffering and carnage, and even worse, are cutting off humanitarian assistance to 2 million people going through a famine of historic proportions,” he wrote, appearing to reference the suspension of US aid to the UN’s main relief agency in Gaza, UNRWA. “My family are subsisting on animal feed, Secretary Blinken, because of your policies,” he said. “You could have called for a cease-fire at any point in the past four months and ended all this suffering and death, and you have not. You could have used your diplomatic pressure to end the suffering, and you chose not to. You could have recognized that shutting off aid to an area that is experiencing the worst famine and human rights disaster in modern history is unethical, yet you chose not to. This is why it is very difficult emotionally for me to meet you today, to somehow normalize a meeting with an administration that continues day after day to cause so much suffering and death with their policies,” he wrote. Haddad urged Blinken to call for an immediate ceasefire, “end the continued transfer of US military reserve equipment to the Israeli military to stop further murder,” “call for an immediate withdrawal out of Gaza and equality for the Palestinian people,” and a “call for an end to the Israeli occupation, for equal rights, freedoms, and laws in this land regardless of one’s religion, ethnicity, or background.” Haddad told CNN that the letter – in which he also included photos of some of his relatives who have been killed – was going to be handed directly to Blinken at Thursday’s meeting. The source familiar with the meeting said some parts of it were read out loud to the top US diplomat during the hour-and-a-half long session at the State Department. That source said Blinken seemed engaged, but largely stuck to talking points in his remarks. At a briefing Thursday, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller confirmed that Blinken met with “a number of leaders in the Palestinian-American community.” “It was the latest in a series of meetings that the Secretary has had with individuals and organizations both within the department and from outside the department that hold a wide range of views across the ideological and political spectrum,” Miller said. “He has held these meetings because he thinks it’s important to hear directly from individuals as I said, both inside the State Department and outside the State Department.” “He finds that process to be constructive. It informs his thinking. It helps him, he believes, shape policy in the best way possible,” he said. Public opposition And while Blinken was quietly confronted behind closed doors about the administration’s policy toward Gaza on Thursday, members of the administration, including Blinken, have also faced public displays of opposition. A number of protesters have camped in front of Blinken’s house since last Friday to try to pressure a change in policy. At a public speech on Tuesday, Samantha Power, head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) was twice confronted about the administration’s position toward Gaza. One questioner, who identified herself as a USAID contractor, asked Power about the loss of the US’ ability “to be moral leaders” due to the “US funded genocide in Gaza.” Another person interrupted her speech to raise the massive humanitarian toll. “It is a devastating situation where not enough resources are getting in, via the Rafah crossing or the Kerem Shalom crossing,” Power said. “And we are working 24/7 to try to dramatically expand the flow of food, medicine, shelter – I mean, so much is needed. But, you know, you have families right now that are living in unimaginable conditions.” “In addition, of course, the greatest loss of life has come from the war itself and from the bombing, and more than 25,000 civilians have been killed. There is not a single call that President Biden makes, or engagement that anybody in the Biden administration does, that doesn’t put the importance of civilian protection and international humanitarian law, at the top of the conversation,” she said. A USAID spokesperson said that “since the start of this conflict, Administrator Power and other Agency leadership have held numerous engagements with staff in the US and at USAID Missions around the world to discuss the US and USAID response to the conflict, offer appreciation for their work, and hear a range of perspectives and concerns.” The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Mas a verdade é que já houve um precedente\", referiu.\nO porta-voz do movimento Pais em Luta, Jorge Castro, sublinhou que a decisão do diretor é \"discriminatória\", já que, numa escola do concelho vizinho de Esposende, alunos nas mesmas circunstâncias conseguiram que lhes fosse garantida a renovação de matrícula no 12.º ano, já pela quarta vez consecutiva.\n\"Os nossos filhos não são 'precedentes', são seres humanos com necessidades especiais, e os recursos aparecem quando a necessidade assim o exige\", apontou.\nEm 12 de junho, os pais de crianças e jovens manifestaram-se frente à Segurança Social de Braga contra a falta de vagas em CACI na região.\nJorge Castro entrou mesmo em greve de fome, um protesto que acabaria por terminar já à noite, depois de o Instituto da Segurança Social ter deixado a garantia de criação de 60 vagas em Esposende, num \"curto espaço de tempo, entre seis meses a um ano\".\n\"Por um ano, se houvesse o mínimo de sensibilidade, o Agrupamento de Escolas Vale do Tamel não podia acolher mais dois alunos?\", criticou, sublinhando ser \"lamentável\" que o Estado \"atire para o desemprego pais trabalhadores, para cuidar dos seus filhos com necessidades especiais\".\nOs pais presentes na manifestação empunhavam cartazes com frases como \"Dignidade para os nossos filhos\", \"Somos pais, queremos trabalhar\", \"A deficiência não se esconde\" e \"Respeito pelo cidadão portador de deficiência\".\nO diretor do agrupamento, Alípio Barbosa, manifestou-se indisponível para falar aos jornalistas.\nVCP // JAP\nLusa/Fim\nEm destaque",

    "title": "Health data of millions of veterans might have been leaked in cyberattack of VA vendor | Stars and Stripes",
    "text": "Fifteen million veterans were notified by the Department of Veterans Affairs this week that a cybersecurity breach involving one of its vendors might have exposed their private health care information. Change Healthcare, which processes payments for VA patients, informed the agency that a “substantial proportion of people in America could have had some information leaked,” VA Secretary Denis McDonough said Thursday during his monthly news conference. “We are pushing for more information. We will move quickly to provide full support and protect veteran data. We are not waiting for that confirmation,” he said. Change Healthcare is the nation’s largest payment processor for health care services. Clinics, pharmacies and community providers submit patient claims via a portal or directly to Change Healthcare, which processes them for payment. United HealthGroup, parent company of Change Healthcare, described the breach as a “malicious criminal cyberattack” and issued a statement this week following an audit of the company’s systems. “Based on initial targeted data sampling to date, the company has found files containing protected health information or personally identifiable information, which could cover a substantial proportion of people in America,” the company said. But there is no evidence that “doctors’ charts” or patients’ “full medical histories” were transferred from Change Healthcare systems. The attackers were identified as a criminal organization that deployed a ransomware attack against United HealthGroup. The VA was first notified in February of a cybersecurity incident at Change Healthcare that delayed payment processing and some prescription orders for veterans using VA health services, McDonough said. “The incident initially impacted a good number of our IT functions, community care payment processes among them. We’ve now restored many of those capabilities, and we’re working to get 100% of them up and going,” he said. McDonough said there was no impact on patient care. He also said the VA has remained focused on restoring systems and strengthening firewalls to protect veteran data. Veterans have been notified by email that they are eligible to sign up for two years of free credit monitoring paid for by Change Healthcare, McDonough said. The VA also is providing veterans with links to resources for preventing online identity theft and fraud. McDonough said as Change Healthcare provides more information on the scope of the breach, the VA will inform Congress, veterans service organizations and veterans. “We are committed to transparency and moving quickly to provide full support for protecting veterans and their data,” he said.",

    "text": "James “Jim” Novotny, age 72, of Roseau, MN, passed away Tuesday, January 16, 2024, at his home. A Celebration of Life will be held on Saturday, March 2nd, 2024, at the VFW Post #9317 in Mantador, ND at 3pm. Inurnment will be held at a later date at St. Paul Lutheran Cemetery near Mooreton, ND. Arrangements have been entrusted to Helgeson Funeral Home in Roseau, MN\nJames Charles Novotny was born October 11, 1951, to James and Helen (Hejtmanek) in Breckenridge, MN. He grew up on a family farm in Mandator, ND and attended grade school in Mantador, ND, graduating from high school in Hankinson, ND in 1969. Jim enrolled at NDSCS in Wahpeton, ND where he graduated in 1972 with an Associate of Science in Architectural Drafting.\nJim was united in marriage to Victoria (Vicki) Lynn Johnson on October 29, 1972, at Bethel Lutheran Church in Wahpeton, ND. Shortly after as a member of the US Army, Jim was assigned to Nuremberg, Germany where he and Vicki resided for 5 years. In 1977 Jim and Vicki moved from Germany to Breckenridge, MN where they celebrated the birth of their first daughter Christina Lynn. In the winter of 1979 Jim and Vicki moved to Roseau, MN, where Jim and Vicki welcomed two more children, Amanda Kay in 1980 and Seth Gordon in 1983.\nJim worked as the service manager for both Roseau Farm Service and Roseau Diesel before taking the leap into self-employment in 1988. Novotny’s Overhead Doors became recognized in the Roseau Community, especially when his “milk” van dropped his three children off at school. Jim was a reliable, honest, and all-around asset to the community he called home. Jim’s son Seth has taken on the legacy that Jim left and is operating Novotny’s Overhead Doors still today in Roseau, MN.\nAfter leaving the Army Jim enrolled in the Roseau Army Reserve and was a Staff Sargent for more than 20 years. In addition to serving his country, Jim joined the Roseau Volunteer Fire Department and spent many years serving his community.\nJim and Vicki built a lovely home on 3rd Ave, that was bustling with kids, friends, family, and a cat named Bonkers who, legend has it, was named even before “Bonkers” was a candy.\nEveryone belonged at the Novotny’s house, Jim and Vicki made sure of it. In 2001 Jim and Vicki lovingly welcomed Jamie Everett, followed by Ryan Thorson in 2008, and later Brittany Nosbusch.\nWhen Jim’s kids were not making trouble in the early years, they were living life and making Jim and Vicki proud. This applied to the next generation as well. Jim and Vicki could not be prouder of their three beautiful granddaughters, Emma, Hannah, and Ava Everett.\nJim is preceded in death by his parents Helen and James Novotny, his beloved wife, Victoria and brother-in-law Gary Gabbert. Jim is survived by his children Christina (Jamie) Everett of Fargo, ND, Amanda (Ryan) Thorson of Ottertail, MN and Seth (Brittany) Novotny of Roseau, MN. As well as his granddaughters Emma Everett (Brandon Miller), Hannah Everett, and Ava Everett all of Fargo, ND. Jim is also survived by his brother Clifford (Marie) Novotny, and his sisters Shirley (Art) Heley and Dorothy Gabbert.\nGuestbook URL: https://www.helgesonfuneralhome.com/obituary/JamesJim-Novotny",
