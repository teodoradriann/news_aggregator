    "title": "Jeanine Amapola Ward on Freedom in Christ After Porn Addiction",
    "text": "How to Find Freedom in Christ After Porn Addiction By Movieguide® Contributor Sadie Robertson Huff and influencer Jeanine Amapola Ward are talking about finding freedom from pornography addiction through Christ. “I do believe that our stories have so much power to bring someone else freedom, and I truly want nothing to have power over me, to have a hold over me. I want to be able to speak everything freely,” Ward [began](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88vNwKUTN_g). She described how she was accidentally exposed to porn at a young age when she was flipping through channels at a hotel with her sisters and a friend. She called that moment the “scariest” of her life. “The devil took this one — literally [it] was like…5-seconds — moment and used this as a seed in my life of lust and opening doors to this,” Ward [recalled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88vNwKUTN_g). “And so I began to be addicted to pornography, and I also struggled with masturbation, and so these were two things that I kept in the darkness for so many years, and I remember feeling just like a weight, like it was literally these chains just dragging behind me everywhere I went it.” It wasn’t until attending a young adult event where she encountered the Holy Spirit for the first time that she found freedom. She remembered that someone felt compelled to lead an alter call, saying, “I feel like there’s people in here that have been carrying a secret for far too long, and it’s something that you need to release, and you’re going to break free of that tonight.” Ward ran to the front and confessed her sin to a leader who prayed over her. “She begins to pray this powerful pray over me. I confessed it, and I literally said, ‘Pornography and masturbation, you have no hold over me.’ And I said it over and over and over, and I kid you not, from that day, the desire left. I mean by the grace of God, it left me, and it never came back,” she [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88vNwKUTN_g) Huff. Huff reflected on the importance of confession, quoting Romans 8:1, which [says](https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm), “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” Huff was exposed to pornography on X, formerly Twitter. “Here I am in high school, like accidentally stumbling upon something and doing something I don’t even really know what it is and then just feeling like an incredible wave of shame from that moment on and knowing like I cannot tell anybody about this kind of thing and thankfully like I was able to stop that. I did not become addicted to it,” she [recalled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88vNwKUTN_g). She still felt shame from the experience, though, and eventually confessed it to her husband Christian. “There’s freedom for you…there’s freedom from that on the other side of confession and accountability and having people and things help you come out of that,” Huff [encouraged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88vNwKUTN_g). “And you do not have to stay in that forever, friend. Don’t stay in that forever. It’s not a way to live a happy and healthy life. It’s not a way to live a full life. It’s not a way to live a life of freedom.” Living a happy and healthy life is something Ward explores further in her new book “ [Becoming Happy & Healthy: Real Life Advice on Friendship, Dating, Career, and Everything Else You Care About](https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Happy-Healthy-Friendship-Everything/dp/076424177X).” “In 2018, I told the Lord I wanted to write a book, but I had no idea what it would be about and if I was ready to yet,” she [posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2QHEeALiRE/?img_index=1) on Instagram. “After spending much time working on myself, growing my relationship with Jesus, working on my daily habits, I feel I have finally overcome many of my past struggles that kept me back and in bondage for so long; you’ll hear all about my story in the book. But now that’s my goal for you too – to become free, happy, and healthy, and ALL that God has for you.” Movieguide® previously [reported](https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/influencer-jeanine-amapola-ward-talks-finding-identity-in-christ.html) on Ward’s testimony: Sadie Robertson Huff and influencer and podcaster Jeanine Amapola Ward talk about the importance of finding one’s identity in Christ during a recent episode of Huff’s “WHOA That’s Good” podcast. Ward described how, when she was growing up, she struggled to understand why God made her the way she was. Her father was German while her mother was Guatemalan, and she didn’t know where she fit in with either of those cultures. “It honestly caused me to get this massive disdain for myself where I was like, ‘God, why did you make me like this? Like, people don’t accept me. I’m always the outcast. I’m the girl that’s left out. I don’t look like my peers in my neighborhood, in my church, in my school.’ And so it really made me change myself to do whatever I needed to do to fit in,” Ward [described]… “She [Ward’s mentor] was like, ‘You are a hypocrite’…It was a bold statement, and it hurt. I remember being like, ‘Okay, like, you don’t the audacity to say that. Like, you don’t know me,’” she [described]. However, her mentor’s direct approach changed her life. “I mean it struck such a chord because it was true, and she spoke the truth in love, and it was exactly what I needed to hear that day, and that phrase that God gave her was the start of a fresh, new beginning with the Lord and myself, and it was a moment I will never forget,” Ward [told]Huff.

    "text": "Mohamed Mandour\nUnder the chairmanship of His Eminence the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Dr. Ahmed Al-Tayeb, the Muslim Council of Elders significantly focuses on empowering youth and enhancing their skills to meet global challenges. This commitment stems from the Council's belief in the crucial role of youth in fostering peace and promoting human coexistence, viewing them as the backbone of nations and their promising future.\nA standout initiative by the Muslim Council of Elders to nurture young people's abilities and refine their skills in peace-making and human coexistence is the Emerging Peacemakers Forum. The first edition of this forum was launched in London in 2018, organized by the Council in collaboration with Al-Azhar and the Archbishop of Canterbury. The second edition was held in July 2023 in Geneva, Switzerland, in partnership with the World Council of Churches and the Rose Castle Foundation, each welcoming 50 young participants from around the globe.\nThe forum serves as a dialogue platform for young individuals aged 18 to 30, who are committed to developing innovative and lasting solutions for peace in communities. It aims to empower young people to initiate national and regional peace-building projects and to disseminate the principles of tolerance and human fraternity.\nIn its endeavor to spread and reinforce the values of human fraternity, tolerance, and coexistence among the youth, the Council launched the Global Student Dialogues on Human Fraternity program in cooperation with Georgetown University. This program aims to familiarize university students with human fraternity values and create a global network for students to exchange creative ideas that advance interreligious and intercultural solidarity in societies.",

The wreck happened just before 10:20 p.m. when a pickup truck hit a 2023 Kawasaki Ninja 400R motorcycle that was \"traveling at a high rate of speed\" southbound on Richmond Highway approaching Pine Bluff Drive, police said. The 2020 Chevrolet Colorado truck was traveling northbound on Richmond Highway when it entered the intersection in front of the motorcycle’s path, said Prince William County police Master Officer Renee Carr. After hitting the bike, the pickup driver fled the scene. The rider, 20-year-old Joseph Emmanuel Word of Dumfries, was thrown from the bike, Carr said. He was taken to an area hospital, where he was pronounced dead, she said. The truck was later found unoccupied behind a nearby business. A police K-9 searched for the suspect without success. Investigators want to talk to anyone who may have witnessed the crash or has information about those involved.",

(WCSC) - The South Carolina Board of Education determined a Dorchester School District Two band director will have her certificate suspended for a year after alcohol was found in her belongings. A lawsuit heard by the state board on Tuesday references an incident from March 23, 2023. The suit claims Hannah Maile Carlson was employed at Gregg Middle School at the time of the incident. The suit claims Carlson reported to a school nurse she had passed out. The administration came to the nurse’s office with a school resource officer, where staff noticed she smelled strongly of alcohol. The water bottle Carlson was carrying was determined to contain alcohol, according to the suit, and other empty and full containers of alcohol were located in Carlson’s belongings. Dorchester School District Two officials confirmed Carlson is no longer employed with the district. The board determined in their ruling that Carlson was believed to engage in unprofessional conduct and her suspension will expire on June 10, 2025. Copyright 2024 WCSC. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "New Research Brief Dispels the Idea That More Incarceration Would Address Crime Upticks\nNearly levels in the last 10 years.\nRelated to: Incarceration\nWASHINGTON, DC – Today, The Sentencing Project released a new research brief, “\nIncarceration & Crime: A Weak Relationship,” that highlights the limited contribution of mass incarceration to the crime drop that began in the 1990s. The research brief also shows that 46 U.S. states have been able to reduce both incarceration and crime levels in the past decade, and provides several evidence-based recommendations for increasing public safety without increasing incarceration rates.\n“We hope this research brief will help to educate both policymakers and the public about the fact that crime rates and incarceration levels are not closely related,” said Nazgol Ghandnoosh, Co-Director of Research with The Sentencing Project and co-author of the report. “During the 1990s, crime rates increased along with incarceration rates, yet incarceration rates continued to go up when U.S. crime rates started falling. While data may indicate that incarceration has some impact on crime – albeit, very limited – non-prison approaches to community safety that are supported by research should be prioritized. We don’t need to rely on mass incarceration to bring down the recent uptick in crime.”\n“\nIncarceration & Crime: A Weak Relationship” shows how more than 24 countries experienced historical States, The research brief similarly describes how most U.S. states, including states such as Louisiana which are working to undo their recent decarceration, experienced a drop in crime rates in the last 10 years while also scaling back mass incarceration.\n“In the last decade or so, most states have started reducing their incarceration levels while also experiencing a reduction in crime levels,” Ghandnoosh said. “We simply don’t need to put so many people behind bars to promote community safety.”\nSome evidence-based policies discussed in “\nIncarceration & Crime: A Weak Relationship” that could address the underlying safety needs of communities include:\n- Reducing unnecessary justice involvement through an investment in expanded substance abuse treatment programs, improved access to harm reduction services, expanded diversion programs, and investments in violence prevention programs.\n- Leveraging non-carceral responses to crime, such as community supervision programs,\n- Eliminating lengthy and extreme sentences with a cap at 20 years of imprisonment with limited exceptions.\n- Permitting a “second look” at lengthy and extreme sentences after 10 years of imprisonment so that sentences reflect the latest knowledge and standards.\n- Eliminating bias through the use of racial impact statements that will help lawmakers\n ",

The reason: the cathedral may be a target for Islamists. However, no explosives have been found so far.\nCologne - So far, there have been no arrests in North Rhine-Westphalia in connection with a possible attack plan on Cologne Cathedral. The German Press Agency learned this on Sunday morning from security circles.\nDuring the search of the cathedral, no explosives were discovered. The explosives detection dogs had found nothing on Saturday evening.\nAccording to their own statements, the police have increased the security measures at Cologne Cathedral because of indications of a possible attack plan by an Islamist group. Police officers searched the cathedral with sniffer dogs on Saturday evening and announced that they would check all visitors on Christmas Eve. The \"Bild\" had previously reported that there had already been the first arrests by special forces in Vienna and also one in Germany on Saturday.\nAccording to dpa information, security authorities had received indications of a possible attack plan by an Islamist group on Cologne Cathedral. A church in Vienna was also a possible target, it was said on Saturday.\nAccording to dpa information, the group could possibly have a connection to an offshoot of the terrorist network Islamic State (IS), which calls itself the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISPK) and has been fighting an armed conflict with the militant Islamist Taliban in Afghanistan for several years.\nCologne police increase protective measures According to \"Bild\", the first arrests by special forces in Vienna and also one in Germany were made on Saturday. The Directorate of State Security and Intelligence in the Austrian Ministry of the Interior did not want to comment on possible arrests. \"We ask for your understanding that we do not comment on current investigations,\" a spokesman in Vienna said late Saturday evening on request.\nA statement from the Vienna police said earlier that security authorities in Austria had increased their protective measures in the face of calls for terrorist attacks against Christian events across Europe, especially on Christmas Eve. Also due to a current risk assessment by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, there is generally an increased risk situation during the Christmas holidays, the police said. As a precautionary measure, there will be increased surveillance of endangered places in Vienna and in the provinces, including churches and Christmas markets.\nAccordingly, civilian and uniformed forces with special equipment and also rifles will be deployed. \"Police attention is mainly focused on churches and religious events, especially church services, and Christmas markets,\" the police said. The terror alert level in Austria is still elevated, the police said. The additional precautionary measures were intended to maintain general safety in Austria, it said.\nMy news After shooting down Russian bombers: Putin's soldiers must be tremblingRead\n\"Kleptomaniacs\" – Lavrov insults German authorities\nYear-end spurt fails to materialise – CDU/CSU and traffic light continue to be on an equal footing in survey\nCracks in Putin's 'illusion of normality': German ambassador gives insight into life in RussiaRead\nIndications of planned attack on Cologne Cathedral – Police announce special protective measures Read more\nPutin apparently plans to recruit teenagers for the Ukraine warread more\nSince the terrorist attack on Israel by the Islamist Hamas on 7 October, fears have been growing that there could also be attacks in Germany.
