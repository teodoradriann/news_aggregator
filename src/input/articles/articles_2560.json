    "title": "Principal: School riot started with fights, drinking off-campus | News | guampdn.com",
    "text": "A bout of drinking and fighting during an off-campus school activity came before a reported riot between Simon Sanchez High School students at the John F. Kennedy High School campus earlier this month. That’s according to Sanchez High Principal Carla Masnayon, who shared more details about the fights at JFK during a roundtable on school violence hosted by the Office of the Attorney General this Wednesday. Masnayon confirmed that students involved in the incident earlier this month were from Sanchez High, and were not fighting JFK students. Sanchez students have been left attending double-session classes at JFK after the Sanchez campus in Yigo was abandoned due to serious damage from Typhoon Mawar in May. Police responded to a reported riot at the JFK campus on Dec. 11, and two students who were 18 years old were arrested and charged following the incident, the Pacific Daily News reported previously. But trouble began a day before, during a school concert that was held at Ypao Beach, according to Masnayon. Guam Police Department had to be called to stop a fight between students who had become intoxicated and started fighting around a pavilion at the beach. “This was the first time that we did an off campus, open area event. We wanted to showcase some of the talents of our students, and one of the challenges that we’ve had because we were doing a double session was that we didn’t have a facility to do these things,” she said. When fighting broke out at Ypao Beach, it was dark, and difficult to identify students in the wide-open beach, Masnayon told Attorney General Douglas Moylan on Wednesday. School administrators had to focus on keeping parents and students who had come for the concert away from the fighting. By the time GPD arrived for the incident, the fighters had dispersed. Fighting at Ypao, “that was brought into the campus on the following day,” the principal said. Charging documents alleged the Dec. 11 fight at JFK campus started after one student, Attshawn Kasuta, 18, approached another with his fist wrapped in a red bandana and asked if “we’re going to throw down?” Christian Rick Ada, also 18, told police he witnessed the first fight, and said that more students jumped into the fight after Kasuta and the student Kasuta was fighting, fell on the ground, court documents stated. Masnayon said Sanchez High has implemented a Student Advocate Mentorship program, to provide mentors to students in the hopes of keeping them on the right track. The school has been tracking a higher number of ninth graders involved in “mischief” this year, from contraband to fighting. 84 riots so far this school year Though the Simon Sanchez fights, which were caught on camera, were the most recent to make headlines, there have been a total of 84 riots reported at public schools just halfway through the 2023 to 2024 school year, according to data shared by the Guam Department of Education. A perceived high level of violence on school campuses is what led to the OAG’s Wednesday’s roundtable. If the rioting trend continues through the second half of the school year, this year will be on track to record more school riots than every school year since the summer of 2019, based on GDOE data. The number of fights reported this school year, however, are on par with what’s been seen in previous years. Simon Sanchez students actually have a lower daily average of disciplinary incidents than every high school besides Tiyan High School, according to GDOE data, though data doesn’t differentiate between minor infractions and violent behavior reported at each school. ‘Disturbing’ videos of fights Also more commonplace are videos of altercations between students. Education oversight chairman, Sen. Chris Barnett, said he’s discovered a number of Instagram pages which are entirely devoted to fights on school campus—both disagreements and sparring matches between students. “What I see when I see these videos, I see students who are very comfortable with disrespecting each other. I see students who are also very comfortable with the amount of time they have,” he said. Guam Education Board Chair Mary Okada said the board called the fight videos that have been circulating “quite disturbing,” and that the board wants to support GDOE to deal with issues at local schools. “Many of us have seen the videos over the past several months, as school began. Post-COVID students returning to campus, and they’re bringing back to campus, perhaps a lot of built up energy that they’ve had during COVID,” she said.",

According to early estimates by trade website Sacnilk, Hari Hara Veera Mallu collected around Rs 4.67 crore net in India on its first day for all languages. Further data is awaited. The film has also earned well overseas. According to US distributor Prathyangira Cinemas, Pawan Kalyan’s film has grossed over $600,000 (around Rs 5 crore) overseas by 1 pm PST on July 23. The film is released in the theatres on Friday, July 24 and is expected to enjoy a decent run at the box office on its first Sunday. The Telugu language film notably didn’t have a strong contender at the Indian box office on its release day.

De acuerdo a la información presentada por la UF-ADPOL, Barralaga no ha podido justificar el origen de 197 bienes y más de 277 millones de lempiras movidos en sus diferentes cuentas bancarias. Entre los bienes solicitados para privación definitiva están 169 vehículos entre livianos y pesados, varios lotes de terreno y viviendas, 22 productos financieros y tres sociedades mercantiles, investigación comprendida entre los años 2007 al 2016 mientras era parte de la Policía. Cabe recordar que fue el Ministerio Publico que presentó en julio de 2017 un requerimiento fiscal contra Barralaga y su esposa Reyna Elizabeth Ayala, además de Montse Paola Fraga, pareja del narcotraficante condenado Winter Blanco, considerado líder del Cartel del Atlántico y condenado en Estados Unidos por narcotráfico. No obstante, mediante un recurso de casación presentado por la defensa de Barralaga, la Sala de lo Penal de la Corte Suprema de Justicia dictó el pasado -19 de abril- un sobreseimiento definitivo por lavado de activos a favor del comisionado retirado, bajo la reforma del decreto 93-2021, que exige un delito precedente al que se le acusaba al uniformado. Mientras tanto su hijo Jorge Barralaga Rivera y su esposa Carmen Alejandra Sarmiento fueron condenados, mediante procedimiento abreviado, por el delito de lavado de activos en donde ambos aceptaron haber utilizados sus empresas para cometer este delito. Barralaga Hernández fue condenado a una pena de diez años de prisión y al pago de una multa de 114.9 millones de lempiras el 25 de marzo de 2021, al ser hallado culpable del delito de lavado de activos, presuntamente procedentes del narcotráfico. Barralaga fue sobreseído tras ser condenado a 10 años de prisión Tras el fallo a favor de Barralaga Hernández con un sobreseimiento definitivo, le fueron absuelto los cargos por los que se le imputaban relacionado a lavado de activos. El uniformado fue detenido en julio de 2017 en el marco de la Operación Perseo y fue enviado a prisión en la Penitenciaría Nacional de Támara, donde guardaba prisión por la sentencia de 10 años que se le fue dictada. A finales de 2019, el ex jerarca policial fue hallado culpable de lavado de dinero, al no poder justificar la procedencia lícita de más de 76 millones de lempiras. Además de la prisión, los jueces además le impusieron al subcomisionado una multa de 114 millones de lempiras.",

    "title": "Fire ants could be spreading on Australian military bases due to ‘massive surveillance failure’, experts say",
    "text": "RAAF base Amberley in Queensland. A 2021 review found that ‘Amberley airbase provides ideal fire ant habitat’. Photograph: Sgt Andrew Eddie/Department of Defence Defence bases pose a “huge risk” when it comes to stopping the spread of invasive fire ants in Australia, with experts suggesting there has been “a massive surveillance failure” on the commonwealth-owned properties. Fire ants have been detected at eight defence sites in Queensland. Seven are within the state’s 700,000-hectare fire ants containment zone which stretches from the Gold Coast to Caboolture. But the eighth infestation is outside that zone – at Swartz Barracks in Oakey, 130km west of Brisbane. That infestation was discovered in April and at least 128 nests have been destroyed since then. The defence department insists specialist pest managers are routinely engaged across defence properties but experts believe the nests at Swartz Barracks went undiscovered for years. The Invasive Species Council is so worried that its chief executive, Andrew Cox, has written to the defence minister, Richard Marles, calling for an urgent audit of all defence properties across Australia. “Fire ants are likely to have been at [Oakey] for several years indicating a massive surveillance failure on defence land,” Cox wrote to Marles, who is also the deputy prime minister, in April. “The detection at Oakey must trigger an audit of defence force land in Australia for fire ant infestation.” Queensland is home to the largest army base in the country and 14 significant defence facilities. Across Australia, there are 3m hectares of defence land. Defence sites inside Queensland’s red imported fire ants (Rifa) containment zone include Victoria, Gallipoli, Damascus and Kokoda barracks as well as the Greenbank vehicle training centre and RAAF base Amberley. Earlier this week, the federal minister for agriculture, Murray Watt – who received a copy of Cox’s letter – replied that the Oakey detection was a “high priority” for defence and the national fire ant eradication program. Watt said that, in addition to the 128 nests being destroyed, 192 hectares were under surveillance and 7,151 hectares were being treated around Swartz Barracks. The minister said the federal and Queensland governments were “working on improved Rifa management, surveillance and suppression activities on defence bases in Queensland” – particularly Greenbank and Amberley. The Swartz nests were linked to existing populations in the containment zone with ants being transferred via contaminated turf, not military vehicles, the minister’s letter states. A defence department spokesperson added that specialist pest managers were “routinely engaged by defence to deliver land-management services across the estate including monitoring and control programs”. “Defence facilitates access to enable external parties to undertake biosecurity management activities on defence land in accordance with defence policy,” they said. Reece Pianta, the advocacy manager at the Invasive Species Council, said the nature of defence land – which is often used for weapons testing or artillery ranges – meant the sites were “not visited enough and they are not maintained from an ecological point of view”. “I’ve had reports of fire ants personnel having difficulty accessing defence land because it’s restricted land by its very nature,” he said. “I’m keen to hear how they are going to improve fire ants management on defence land. I think defence land is a huge fire ant risk – it’s a risk they have moved from that [Oakey] site and we should check. I suspect there are undetected fire ant nests on defence land.” Pianta said it was “disappointing” the federal government was not surveying defence land. He also asked: “What else is on these sites that is an invasive risk to other species? There is a lack of transparency.” The Invasive Species Council spokesperson claimed the nests at Swartz Barracks – which were located in a quadrangle – had been there for two to five years and were reaching the density of Rifa reported in some parts of the US. The independent Invasive Species Council was formed in 2002 “to seek stronger laws, policies and programs to keep Australian biodiversity safe from weeds, feral animals and other invaders”, according to the council’s website. A 2021 strategic review commissioned by the Queensland government into what has now become a $1.2bn fire ant elimination program warned that defence land was “of particular concern” in the fight against the pest. That report was not made public until 2023. The review panel, led by Dr Helen Scott-Orr, singled out Greenbank reserve and RAAF base Amberley as “two major parcels” of at-risk defence land. Greenbank “could well act as a reservoir for reinfestation if it were not included in any nearby suppressive program. Likewise the Amberley airbase provides ideal Rifa habitat,” the review stated. In March, a Senate committee chaired by Matt Canavan heard the scope of the Rifa problem was immense. Should the ants spread through Australia’s habitat, the impact would be worse than the combined effects of rabbits, cane toads, foxes, camels, wild dogs and feral cats, the inquiry was told. Up to 650,000 Australians could be stung annually and the beef industry could be slashed by 40%. The defence spokesperson said the department regularly reinforced biosecurity obligations and “guidance on how to identify red imported fire ants at defence sites to all defence personnel, via base-wide communications” and worked with the agriculture department to “ensure robust biosecurity policies and processes are in place to manage risks from pests, weeds and pathogens”. They said the eight infested defence sites were now managed in accordance with fire ant eradication program guidelines. The most recent treatment at Oakey was completed on 30 April. “As Oakey is located outside of the biosecurity zone, the biosecurity zone protocols did not previously apply at that site. The increased protocols have now been applied,” the spokesperson said. Restrictions at Swartz Barracks prevent the movement of soil, rock, mulch, potted plants or other similar material from the base, the department said. A spokesperson from the national fire ant eradication program said eradicating fire ants would take a “whole-of-community” approach and that under the Biosecurity Act 2014 “all Queenslanders have a general biosecurity obligation to manage biosecurity risks and threats on property they own, manage, or work on”.",

The new game will feature 24 racers and a free roam mode that allows players to explore the world beyond the racetracks.\nOne of the biggest surprises was the reveal of a new game from the acclaimed Japanese developer FromSoftware Inc, called The Duskbloods , that will be out next year as a Switch 2 exclusive.\nThe company’s first entirely new platform in eight years, the Switch 2 has the potential to lift sales for game makers and retailers after what has been a lackluster three years for the industry.\nTo buoy sales, Nintendo is also leaning on a large lineup of third-party games that were not playable on the previous Switch, including old entries in franchises such as Street Fighter and Final Fantasy .\nRather than asking customers to start from scratch, as it did with most of its previous consoles, Nintendo is instead taking an iterative approach. The Switch 2 resembles the Switch, with its large screen and detachable controllers, but is slightly bigger. Like its predecessor, the Switch 2 will play games both on the go and on a television using a dedicated docking station. The new machine can play almost every Switch game as well as games that will be developed exclusively for Switch 2.\nThe Switch 2 will also have some additional features, such as allowing players to flip over the controllers and use them as a computer mouse for playing certain games.\nThe Switch 2 controller includes a button dedicated to a new feature called GameChat. Players will be able to use it to talk to friends using the system’s built-in microphone and can share their screen with friends while playing games. A separately sold camera will allow users to appear on screen while playing, much like they would while streaming on Twitch or YouTube.\nThe Switch 2 will also allow you to play select supported games locally or online with people using other Switch 2 systems, even if they don’t own the game.\nOther features of the system include two USB-C ports, an adjustable stand with more flexibility than the original Switch and 256GB of built-in storage. The screen will support HDR, while the new dock will be capable of outputting at 4K resolution when playing on the television.\nAlthough the Switch 2 is still not as graphically proficient as rivals PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the new power boost has allowed Nintendo to court third-party publishers such as Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc, which said that the popular action role-playing game Elden Ring will be on the new system. Capcom Co’s Street Fighter 6 and Electronic Arts Inc’s sports games Madden NFL and EA Sports FC will also come to Switch 2.\nSome old Switch games will be enhanced for Switch 2 and support the system’s new features, Nintendo said, showing off an iteration of last year’s Super Mario Party Jamboree that allows players to use the camera and mouse controls. Existing owners of the game will be able to pay for an upgrade.\nEnhanced Switch 2 versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will improve both games’ graphics and include a feature called Zelda Notes with supplementary features like map navigation that you can access on your phone.\nThe upcoming game Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will feature both Switch and Switch 2 versions.\nTake-Two Interactive Software Inc will release Switch 2 versions of the strategy game Civilization VII , the sports games NBA 2K and WWE 2K and the upcoming Borderlands 4 . – Bloomberg\nOpen Modal × $(document).ready(function(){ var freeBoxShow = false; $(window).scroll(function() { var scrollPercent = 100 * $(window).scrollTop() / ($(document).height() - $(window).height()); window.setTimeout(function () { //scroll to page length 35% then show the pop-up if (scrollPercent >= 35 && !freeBoxShow) { freeBoxShow = true; $('#freeHTMLBoxBtn').click(); } }, 500); }); var freeModal = document.getElementById(\"freeModal\"); $(\"#freeHTMLBoxBtn\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"block\"; //$('body').addClass('free-modal-open'); }); $(\".free-close\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"none\"; //$('body').removeClass('free-modal-open'); }); var freeBox = '",
