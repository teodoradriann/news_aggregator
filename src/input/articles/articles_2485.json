    "title": "Deebo Samuel Gets at Cam Newton and Micah Parsons for Brock Purdy Criticism | VladTV",
    "text": "San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel addressed the team's recent loss and the criticism they have been receiving while on the \"Up and Adams\" show with Kay Adams. Despite the loss, Samuel remains confident in his team's abilities and their position as the number one seed in their division. When asked about the loss, Samuel acknowledged that turnovers were a major factor in their defeat. The team had five turnovers, including three in the first half, which severely impacted their chances of winning. However, Samuel emphasized that regardless of the loss, they still hold the top seed and control their own destiny. In regards to the criticism surrounding quarterback Brock Purdy, Samuel defended his teammate and expressed frustration with how quickly people are quick to judge and criticize. He pointed out that Purdy has had many successful games and that one bad game does not define his abilities. Samuel stated that it is unfair how the media and fans are so eager to tear him down. Furthermore, Samuel addressed the comments made by Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons. Parsons took a jab at Purdy on social media after his own team's loss. Samuel brushed off Parsons' comments, stating that the 49ers had beaten the Cowboys weeks ago and questioned why Parsons was still concerned with their team. He also jokingly mentioned Cam Newton's recent comments, highlighting how Newton had praised Purdy before changing his tune. Despite the loss, Samuel maintains a positive outlook and continues to focus on the next game. He stressed the importance of minimizing turnovers and believes that everything else will fall into place. Samuel also shared his post-game routine, which involves receiving treatment and getting his body ready for the upcoming game. You can hear more above.

    "text": "Oklahoma’s top education official Ryan Walters praises right-wing media figures as among “the best minds” to develop the “best history standards in the country” Published On July 9, Oklahoma’s superintendent of public instruction Ryan Walters [announced](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24796756-walters-announces-revisions-to-social-studies-standards25) that a number of people — many of them key figures in right-wing media — would be rewriting the social studies curriculum in the state. The list includes right-wing hosts with ties to Walters like Steve Deace, Dennis Prager, and Stacy Washington, as well as Kevin Roberts, the head of The Heritage Foundation, which has organized Project 2025. (For more on the right-wing figures helping guide Oklahoma's curriculum, see [here](https://www.mediamatters.org/education/oklahoma-having-right-wing-media-figures-rewrite-its-social-studies-curriculum-heres-what).) Walters appeared on the July 11 episode of Jenna Ellis in the Morning and discussed the plans for a new curriculum, using rhetoric that appears to [mirror](https://www.salon.com/2022/09/13/without-the-bible-there-is-no-america-josh-hawley-goes-full-christian-nationalist-at-natcon/) Christian nationalism and expressing excitement with the group of right-wing figures that will help develop the curriculum.",

    "title": "Ukraine Update: Ukraine sinks another Russian warship",
    "text": "The Russian guided-missile corvette “Ivanovets” sank on Wednesday evening following a nighttime attack by Ukrainian aquatic drones. The 56-meter-long ship was one of three Project 1241.1 “Trantul”-class corvettes in service in Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, and though its standard armament includes anti-ship missiles, that didn’t prevent the drones from reaching the ship, The Ivanovets sank rapidly after tilting to an almost vertical position, generating comments comparing the ship to the Titanic. There is no word on the ship’s 40-man crew, though search-and-rescue operations were reportedly underway. Video from the attack appears to show the involvement of multiple drones. With this sinking, Russia has now lost 20% of its Black Sea Fleet. That includes the sinking of the flagship “Moskva” and the Kilo-class submarine “Rostov-on-Don.” Ukraine’s use of aquatic drones, aerial drones, and anti-ship missiles has reportedly pinned down Russia’s fleet and allowed Ukraine to maintain shipping of grain and other goods despite the collapse of the official grain deal. Just as aerial drones have reshaped every aspect of the battlefield on land, making it almost impossible for armored vehicles to be deployed in the way they have for decades, aquatic drones are shaking up ideas of naval power. The AFU appears to have sunk the Russian Navy pr. 12411 Tarantul Class Corvette \"Ivanovets\" with multiple marine drone strikes on the night of January 31 to February 1 in western Crimea.Stunning images of the boat sinking! #UkraineWar #UkraineRussianWar #OSINT #Ukraine… pic.twitter.com/xtHds1fWNi— OSINT (Uri) 🇺🇸 🇨🇦 🇬🇧 🇺🇦 🇮🇱 (@UKikaski) February 1, 2024 The AFU appears to have sunk the Russian Navy pr. 12411 Tarantul Class Corvette \"Ivanovets\" with multiple marine drone strikes on the night of January 31 to February 1 in western Crimea.Stunning images of the boat sinking! #UkraineWar #UkraineRussianWar #OSINT #Ukraine… pic.twitter.com/xtHds1fWNi Like other features of Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s illegal invasion, expect widespread use of aquatic drones to shake up strategies around the world. Open-source intelligence analyst Andrew Perpetua has another long list of losses recorded in the last day. Here are the losses I could identify today. https://t.co/lZLivxUud6 pic.twitter.com/ZIAYgVD0Kv— Andrew Perpetua (@AndrewPerpetua) February 1, 2024 Here are the losses I could identify today. https://t.co/lZLivxUud6 pic.twitter.com/ZIAYgVD0Kv These losses show Russia is still giving up jaw-dropping amounts of armor in failed assaults. They continue to show how important both FPV drones and bombs dropped by rotary-wing drones are in turning Russian tanks and APCs into junk. One big (figuratively and literally) feature of this list that’s new over the past few weeks is Ukraine’s Baba Yaga “mothership” drone. Named for a wicked witch character in Slavic folk tales, the drone is a giant six-rotor hexacopter that is designed to emerge at night, when most FPV drones are grounded, and deliver bombs as large as 15 kilograms to Russian targets. But, as usual, Perpetua’s list is far from all good news. Particularly concerning is the number of boats that Ukraine has lost, which appears to be related to attempts to hold the bridgehead on the east side of the Dnipro River at Krynky. These boats, which are forced to land at very few locations to support the relatively small Ukrainian force, have been increasingly vulnerable to Russian attacks. There was some hope that the boats might fare better after Ukraine took out a notorious Russian ace FPV pilot. But based on this latest report, that doesn’t seem to be the case. The big Russian losses on Perpetua’s list are likely connected to a Russian attack that was repulsed on Wednesday near the town of Novomykhailivka, on the eastern front, southwest of Donetsk.

The tally of tanks and other vehicles lost is simply incredible. But Russia seems willing to take such losses over and over again. After days of infighting and reports of standoffs with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, it appears that Ukrainian General Valery Zaluzhny may finally be on his way out. According to CNN, Zaluzhny was informed on Monday that he was fired, and a presidential decree is expected by the end of the week. Zelenskyy reportedly holds Zaluzhny largely responsible for the planning and execution of the failed Ukrainian counteroffensive last year. Ukraine’s inability to gain more than a few small areas in moving against heavily defended Russian positions has led to months of near-stalemate, and to increasing difficulties for Ukraine when it comes to securing adequate levels of ammunition and equipment. Zaluzhny, has been commander in chief of Ukraine’s armed forces since 2021. Zelenskyy reportedly offered to appoint Zaluzhny to a different position, but the general declined. Replacements for Zaluzhny reportedly include the head of the Defense Intelligence Directorate, Kyrylo Budanov, and Commander of Ukrainian Land Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi. Syrski is considered the “brain” behind Ukraine’s wildly successful counterattacks in Kharkiv and Kherson. The European Union has overcome opposition by Hungarian strongman Viktor Orbán to finalize a $54 billion financial assistance package for Ukraine. This represents a win for both the E.U. and Ukraine, and could signal that Orbán is vulnerable on other issues where he has continued to protect Russia and Vladimir Putin.

    "title": "Alumni Spotlight: Rena Kraut | Northwestern Bienen School of Music",
    "text": "Rena Kraut ‘99 is founder and executive director of the Cuban American Youth Orchestra (CAYO), a cultural exchange experience for young Cuban and American musicians to travel, work, and perform together. CAYO successfully completed its inaugural tour of Cuba in May 2019, with debut concerts in Matanzas and Havana's National Theater featuring the premiere of two compositions by Cuban composers. CAYO’s Director of Artistic Operations, fellow Bienen alumnus Timothy Zavadil ‘94 MMus, selected musicians for the inaugural orchestra, which comprised 25 American and 45 Cuban student and pre-professional musicians. Kraut graduated from Northwestern with degrees in clarinet performance and English creative writing. An active performer, educator, and writer, she was named one of Musical America’s top 30 professionals of the performing arts in 2019. What made you choose the Bienen School of Music? I fell in love with Northwestern at age nine when my older sister (cellist Melissa Kraut ‘03 DMus) enrolled as a freshman. In middle school, I participated in a Center for Talent Development writing course and in high school I was a music cherub for two summers. I knew Northwestern had everything I needed to thrive in music and writing, and I didn't apply anywhere else. Which professors influenced you most during your time at the Bienen School of Music? Russ Dagon, my teacher and mentor, is number one for his graciousness in letting me pursue dreams in and out of the practice room and his steady belief in my potential. Steve Peterson and [Mallory Thompson](https://www.music.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile/mallory-thompson) as leaders on and off the podium. Joseph Epstein, my writing mentor, and Richard Ford, who taught a guest seminar and gave me the best career advice when I asked whether I should pursue music or writing after undergrad: \"Music. You won't have anything interesting to write about until you're 40 anyway.\" It was true! Tell us about a particular experience that impacted you during your time at the Bienen School of Music? I love telling my students this one: being seated dead last chair after my first pool audition at Northwestern. I was a kid that needed to be humbled. Failure is the best teacher. What lesson did you learn at Bienen that has continued to resonate with you in your career? The clarinet studio was at that time led by Russ Dagon, Charlene Zimmerman, Lawrie Bloom, and Leslie Grimm. I spent time in each of their studios. We never saw anything but collegiality and partnership between these four very different musicians and teachers. Students were encouraged to get what they needed, where they needed it, depending on their personal progress. It wasn't until I spent time at other institutions that I realized how rare this was. It was clear that they all put our education first. And they were friends! What inspired you to start the Cuban American Youth Orchestra? In 2015 I was an extra musician in the Minnesota Orchestra tour to Havana, which heralded the opening of diplomatic relations between our two long-estranged countries. We boarded a plane that had never flown that route, touched down in a country we had never seen and that had few traces of American influence, and spent 100-odd hours interacting with colleagues and students who blew us away with their open curiosity, talent and relentless drive in the face of adversity. Sitting in a side-by-side with the national youth orchestra, we attempted to clap a Cuban rhythm written into a piece by composer Guido López-Gavilán (whom CAYO later commissioned). Rehearsal all but collapsed as every single Cuban musician turned to us with smiles and tried to demonstrate how to properly feel the clave rhythm. It was a singular moment of cultural humility, a powerful reminder of how much we all have to learn when we walk unfamiliar paths. I couldn't forget that feeling, and started CAYO to seize a moment in history where cultural diplomacy could have a real and lasting impact. What is next for CAYO? CAYO symbolizes what so many of us have been missing: on one level, live performance and people-to-people interaction; on a higher level, international dialogue, collaboration, and exposure to new experiences that challenge our worldview. We are so excited to release this pent-up energy in a national tour of the US in 2022. My dream? To bring this orchestra of joyous hope for the future to Chicago—and to Northwestern.

    "text": "CASTELLÓ. La planta logística de Amazon en Onda vive este viernes su primera jornada de huelga convocada por el comité de empresa del centro para reclamar mejoras salariales que compensen la pérdida de poder adquisitivo de la plantilla y un plus por las épocas de más actividad como el 'Black Friday'. El centro logístico de Onda cuenta con unos 600 trabajadores y, de ellos, medio millar (los que realizan tareas de almacén) estaban llamados a la huelga que ha comenzado a las 7.00 horas de la mañana.\nDesde el comité de empresa han destacado el fuerte despliegue policial desde primera hora de la mañana. Néstor Hernández, presidente del comité y miembro de CCOO, ha indicado que unas 70 personas se han concentrado a primera hora frente a la planta para protestar por sus condiciones laborales y, especialmente, salariales.\nDesde Amazon han indicado por su parte que la participación de la huelga en el turno de la mañana se sitúa en un 13% (contando el personal de la planta, tanto logística como de otras áreas) y han destacado que \"no está teniendo impacto en los pedidos\". \"Todo se está entregando sin retraso, el servicio está garantizado\", han asegurado.\nPor el momento, la representación de los trabajadores no ha dado una cifra de participación pero han apuntado al hecho de que gran parte de los y las trabajadoras son personal temporal y eso, apuntan, es un hándicap a la hora de sumarse a la protesta.\nCon esta protesta (que se alargará hasta las 00.00 horas de la noche y que se retomará el sábado), la plantilla quiere exigir a Amazon el pago de las gratificaciones por la llamada temporada 'Peak', el pico de trabajo que comprende desde el 'Black Friday' y el periodo de Navidad hasta el día de Reyes. En concreto, solicitan un bono de 490 euros por toda esta temporada y/o un incremento de la mejora voluntaria de 87 euros mensuales.\nPara Amazon, las personas trabajadoras \"perciben salarios por encima de lo establecido en el convenio colectivo provincial del sector logístico, con un salario de entrada de más de 1.483 euros al mes (brutos) y tienen oportunidades para crecer y desarrollar sus carreras profesionales\".\nLa huelga, que inicialmente estaba prevista desde este viernes al próximo lunes, ha sido desconvocada a partir del domingo. Según ha explicado el presidente del comité de empresa, la reducción de los paros a la mitad responde a la \"nula intención\" por parte de la empresa a negociar las condiciones salariales. \"Desconvocamos porque vemos que no hay respuesta por parte de Amazon y quienes más van a perder son los trabajadores, que ya tienen unos salarios reducidos, queremos evitar un mal mayor para ellos\", dice Hernández.\nLa huelga continuará este sábado hasta las 00.00 horas. Los paros de domingo y lunes han sido desconvocados.",
