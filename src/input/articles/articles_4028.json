    "text": "According to the HCMC Department of Natural Resources and Environment, the city generates an average of 9,800-10,000 tons of waste per day, around 70 percent of which is disposed of through sanitary landfills. However, observations in the vicinity of these landfills indicate that the landfilling process is negatively impacting the environment. For instance, in Phuoc Hiep Landfill (Cu Chi District), severe pollution was observed in late July 2024, with black smoke plumes and a strong stench. Additionally, residents near the landfill have been affected by leachate from the landfill, contaminating water in nearby canals and emitting a foul odor. More seriously, the leachate has seeped into the groundwater, affecting the lives of local residents. Unable to endure the pollution, many have been forced to sell their homes and relocate. The local authorities have repeatedly asked for feasible solutions, but the situation is not at all better. Similarly, at Da Phuoc Landfill (Binh Chanh District), a strong odor was noticeable even at a distance of 30-50 meters from the landfill gate. According to local residents, while the odor has improved compared to the past, it still persists, especially during rainy weather. Hanoi is also grappling with severe waste pollution. The city generates 6,500-7,000 tons of waste daily. Despite having two large-scale landfills, namely Nam Son (Soc Son District) and Xuan Son (Son Tay Town), pollution from waste remains a significant issue for residents. In Hong Ky Commune of Soc Son District, residents have been enduring the foul odor from Nam Son Landfill for over 20 years. The dust and pollution from the constant traffic of garbage trucks have made daily life difficult for residents. The furniture inside their house has to be cleaned daily yet is still covered with dust. That is not to mention a large number of flies which annoy dwellers and pose a menace threat to their health. Even with its vast area, Lam Dong Province only owns two solid waste treatment plants, both using outdated incineration technology. The waste treatment plant in Da Lat City emits a strong odor, negatively impacting the surrounding environment and agricultural productivity. Farmer Vo Duc Vinh, living in Xuan Truong Commune, annoyedly said that his coffee farm used to yield 15 tonnes per hectare before the operation of the plant. For the past two years, with the introduction of this plant, the farm output has been only 1-2 tonnes per hectare. Phu Quoc City of Kien Giang Province is not a better case. With its growing tourism industry, the island generates 190 tonnes of waste per day. While efforts have been made to attract investors for a new waste treatment plant that can process 300 tonnes a day, progress has been slow. The island's existing landfill is overflowing, causing severe pollution. This ultimately harms the flow of tourists to the famous attraction, resulting in great loss to the local tourism sector. Con Dao, often hailed as a pristine island paradise, has been struggling with a massive 70,000-tonne waste accumulation at Nhat Beach over the past 30 years. The island, which sees a growing number of tourists and residents, generates an average of 22.5 tonnes of daily waste, reaching 30 tonnes during peak seasons. While a 200-ton-per-day waste treatment plant was initiated in February 2022 to address this issue, it has yet to become operational. As a result, the island's pristine image is tarnished by the foul odors from the landfill during dry seasons and leachate during rainy seasons. In a separate incident, the authorities in Binh Duong Province uncovered a massive illegal industrial waste dump in Tan Long Commune of Phu Giao District. The landfill, operated by Tra Vinh Environment One-member Co. Ltd., covered an area of 28,000 square meters and contained a variety of hazardous waste, including industrial chemicals, oil-contaminated packaging, and glass. Despite regulations mandating the transportation and then disposal of such waste at a specialized facility in Tra Vinh Province, the perpetrators had illegally dumped the waste at this site. They purposedly constructed a 2-meter high fence surrounding the site to hide their illegal act. Meanwhile, Phu Quy Island in Binh Thuan Province is grappling with its own waste management challenges. The island has accumulated over 140,000 tonnes of waste over the past 20 years. Although a project to construct a waste treatment plant over an area of 2.1ha was approved in February 2020, its implementation has been delayed due to land acquisition issues. As a result, the island's waste disposal capacity remains inadequate.",

    "text": "A $100,000 investment in the title might give you goosebumps. But when you work out the math, it is a pragmatic investment. Because to convert $100,000 into $1 million in 10 years, your portfolio should give a 26% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) or a 1,000% return in a decade. Three TSX stocks to buy for a $1 million retirement Constellation Software stock Constellation Software ( [TSX:CSU](https://www.fool.ca/company/tsx-csu-constellation-software-inc/343181/)) is a stock you can consider buying anytime, as its acquisition model makes it a resilient growth stock. It buys small vertical-specific software companies with stable cash flows and then reinvests that cash to acquire new companies with stable cash flows. Constellation is compounding its cash flows, which is reflected in its stock price. And in compounding, it is always the first $1,000 that takes time. The time to convert $1,000 to $2,000 and $2,000 to $3,000 keeps reducing. That is happening with Constellation. The stock took 31 months (January 2019-August 2021) to rise from $1,000 to $2,000. But it reached the $3,000 mark in 27 months in November 2023. The stock has surged 1,300% in the last 10 years and continues to grow. If you only have 10 years left for retirement, Constellation is a relatively stable [growth stock](https://www.fool.ca/investing/how-to-choose-growth-stocks/) to invest a significant portion of your portfolio. Descartes Systems stock Descartes Systems ( [TSX:DSG](https://www.fool.ca/company/tsx-dsg-the-descartes-systems-group-inc/345114/)) is another resilient growth stock with the potential to give you at least a 20% CAGR return in the long term. The supply chain management solutions provider has been growing its [revenue ](https://www.fool.ca/investing/what-is-revenue/)every year for over a decade. It also improved its net profit margin from 11% during the pandemic to 21% at present. Trade and logistics are ever evolving. And with global supply chain and geopolitical tension, the trade network is revamping. New trade routes, inventory and logistics planning, adjusting to a new supplier network and transporting goods from another country to your doorstep. Steps keep adding in trade and logistics, and technology makes it efficient. Descartes stock grows with the economy when trade and commerce flourish. But it is also resilient to economic downturns as companies use Descartes’s solutions to overcome new trade challenges. For instance, the pandemic saw increased subscriptions for its e-commerce services. Descartes Systems is in a long-term secular growth trend. It keeps evolving with the needs of trade and commerce. Being among the top 10 providers of supply chain management solutions, it has the potential to tap the industry’s growth. Nuvei stock Unlike the above two growth stocks that have been trading on the TSX for over a decade, Nuvei ( [TSX:NVEI](https://www.fool.ca/company/tsx-nvei-nuvei/363800/)) is relatively new and has yet to prove its worth as a sustainable growth stock. It started trading on the TSX in September 2020 during the tech bubble. The stock fell when the bubble burst. It is trading 28% below its initial price. You can relate to Nuvei’s stock price momentum with the 2000 dot-com bubble when many internet stocks crashed. Only the ones with a strong foundation and robust balance sheet thrived. Today, investors who bought tech stock in 2001 are millionaires. Nuvei is a payment platform with a wide array of payment options to choose from. It is currently dependent on e-commerce clients to generate a higher transaction volume. It is expanding into enterprise transactions, attracting [big names](https://nuvei.com/company/press-releases/nuvei-enters-global-payments-partnership-with-microsoft/) like Microsoft. Enterprise-level transactions can reduce the e-commerce seasonality and give it a stable platform for growth. While Nuvei stock could be volatile in the first few years, it could pick up momentum when the global economy begins to recover.",

    "text": "Damascus, Dec 29 (IANS) A fresh Israeli missile attack targetted the outskirts of the Syrian capital of Damascus, triggering a response from the Syrian air defence system, the media reported. The Syrian army said on Thursday in a statement that the \"Israeli enemy\" carried out an aerial attack from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, targetting some points in the southern region, without elaborating on the targeted sites.\nIt added that the Syrian air defence forces intercepted most of them, with losses limited to material damages.\nPrevious Israeli strikes in Syria had reportedly targetted military sites suspected of harbouring Iranian-backed militias, arms convoys, and alleged weapons storage facilities, according to the opposition watchdog group -- the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\nIsrael has recently upped its attacks on Syrian targets in tandem with its military campaign in the Gaza Strip, Xinhua news agency reported.\nSyria has been engulfed in over 12-year war, with the government forces of President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, fighting against various opposition groups.\nIsrael, on the other hand, has a long-standing policy of preventing Iran from establishing a military presence in Syria by repeatedly conducting airstrikes to destroy alleged Iranian weapons supplies.\nThe previous Israeli attack in Syria on Monday evening killed Seyyed Razi Mousavi, who was also one of the longest-serving advisors of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Syria and a close associate of the late Iranian top commander Qassem Soleimani, who was assassinated by a US drone attack in Iraq in 2020.\n--IANS\nint/khz\nAdd Chart to Comment",

    "text": "In an impactful community outreach event, Liberty Bank's Community Outreach Office partnered with Ruth's House in Longmeadow, Massachusetts, aiming to arm local residents and their families with critical information on identifying and preventing elderly scams. The collaboration brought together experts and community members in a shared effort to safeguard one of the most vulnerable segments of the population against financial fraud.\nEducational Outreach: A Beacon of Hope\nMary-Anne Schelb, the Regional Director of Business Development, engaged with the attendees, highlighting the imperative need for elderly individuals to communicate suspicious activities to trusted family members, friends, or caretakers. In instances where seniors may find themselves isolated, Schelb emphasized the importance of reaching out to professionals within their living community or trusted financial institutions for guidance and support. The event also featured Dawn Creighton, Liberty Bank's Community Outreach Officer, who shared invaluable advice on recognizing common scam tactics, particularly those involving impostors posing as family members in distress.\nBuilding Strong Defenses Against Scams\nThe initiative by Liberty Bank and Ruth's House underscores a critical approach towards combating elder fraud - education and open dialogue. Drawing on resources like Protecting Elderly Parent's Assets and Shield & Shine, the event provided attendees with a comprehensive toolkit for scam prevention. These resources advocate for initiating conversations about financial management, securing personal information, and employing technology such as call blockers and multi-factor authentication to deter scammers effectively.\nCommunity Solidarity in Action\nThe collaborative effort between Liberty Bank and Ruth's House not only served as an educational forum but also as a testament to the power of community solidarity in facing societal challenges. By bringing these issues to the forefront and equipping individuals with the knowledge to protect themselves and their loved ones, such initiatives play a crucial role in mitigating the risks posed by financial scammers targeting the elderly.\nAs society continues to navigate through the complexities of financial security in the digital age, the union of community organizations, financial institutions, and individuals in such educational endeavors represents a beacon of hope and resilience. It reinforces the collective responsibility to shield our elders from the perils of scams, ensuring their dignity, security, and well-being remain intact.",

    "text": "Opinion\nJudge Makes Shock Ruling Over Ban on Prayer and Bibles\nThe U.K. High Court upheld a special order that criminalizes prayer and Scripture reading in front of an abortion clinic in Bournemouth, England, according to court documents.\nAccording to the\nBBC, Christian campaigners lost a legal challenge regarding the enforcement of a Public Spaces Protection Order banning prayers outside the abortion clinic. The local governing authority, the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, imposed a safe zone around the abortion clinic in October 2022.\nThe PCP Council began receiving reports of “alarm and distress” caused by protesters outside the clinic in 2017, Lord Justice Warby and Mrs. Justice Thompson, the two judges who\nissued the ruling, wrote. In response to the reports, the PSPO was put in place.\nThe petition to challenge the PSPO was spearheaded by two\nChristian groups, 40 Days for Life and Christian Concern, who argued that the order banned what they called “peaceful and lawful behavior.”\nHowever, the judges were unsympathetic to these arguments and concluded that there was evidence to demonstrate that the protests caused harm.\nStop the censors, sign up to get today's top stories delivered right to your inbox\n“It is, in our judgment, naïve and simplistic to suggest that activities of this kind in this context cannot be considered ‘detrimental’… just because they are silent,” Warby and Thompson wrote.\nThey argued that any interference with human rights was “justified by the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of women attending the clinic, their associates and the staff.”\nChristian Concern decried the High Court’s ruling in a\nstatement issued on its website.\nAndrea Williams, CEO of Christian Concern, said that the organization plans to appeal the ruling.\n“Peaceful witness near abortion centers are helpful to many women in crisis pregnancies, offering genuine choice by providing support. Whatever the guidance or law says, arresting peaceful pro-lifers in these zones clearly breaches their human rights,” Williams stated.\nLivia Tossici-Bolt, who leads 40 Days for Life in Bournemouth, noted that the group was “very disappointed by the judge’s ruling and will continue to support women in crisis pregnancies and will continue to fight for justice.”\nAbortion has become a renewed hot topic issue around the globe since the U.S. Supreme Court\nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf the landmark Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in June 2022, in which the justices ruled that abortion is not a fundamental right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.\nEvidently, the U.K., which\nallows abortion to take within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy if two doctors approve, is trending towards placing abortion on a higher pedestal over rights such as freedom of religion or speech.\nHowever, judges place themselves in precarious positions when they vow to protect one right at the expense of others. The High Court’s ruling demonstrates that, when legal issues are not concretely defined, some judges will use the opportunity to impose their own personal beliefs.\nUnfortunately, the law can be fragile in the hands of the wrong individual.\nBut the silver lining in all of this is the resilience shown by the Christian organizations and their steadfast commitment to protecting unborn lives.\nAnd historically, suppression and bans of religion only seem to strengthen the faith of the respective leaders.\nAfter all, Christians were persecuted mercilessly in the early days of the Roman Empire. Yet, they remained steadfast in their\nfaith, and within a few hundred years, Christianity became the largest religion in the world.\nSo in this instance, the Christian groups may have lost a battle in the fight against abortion. However, let’s hope that will only serve to invigorate the desire to put an end to the greatest evil of our time.\nThis article appeared originally on\nThe Western Journal.",

    "text": "ATHENS/LONDON (Reuters) -Rescuers pulled three more crew members and a security guard alive from the Red Sea on Thursday, maritime security sources said, a day after Houthi militants sank the Greek ship Eternity C and said they were holding some of the crew still missing.\nIt was the second Greek bulk carrier sunk this week by the Iran-aligned Houthi militia, shattering months of relative calm off Yemen's coast, the gateway to the Red Sea and a critical route for oil and commodities to the world.\nMany shipping companies have suspended voyages due to the fear of attack. The Houthis are believed to be holding six of the Eternity C's complement of 22 crew and three guards, maritime security sources said.\nEternity C was first hit on Monday with sea drones and rocket-propelled grenades fired from speed boats.\nOn Thursday, the Greek operator of the vessel, Cosmoship Management, confirmed that so far ten people have been rescued - eight Filipino crew members, one Indian and one Greek security guard. Ten remain unaccounted for, including one guard, it said.\nOne person is believed dead and another four have not been seen since the attack on the ship, the company added.\nIf confirmed, the casualties would be the first fatalities in the area since June 2024.\nThe crew were forced to jump into the water, following a second attack on the vessel on Tuesday morning. Rescuers have been searching for survivors since Wednesday morning. The four people rescued on Thursday morning had spent nearly 48 hours in the water.\nOn Wednesday, the Houthis' military spokesperson said in a televised address that the Yemeni navy had \"responded to rescue a number of the ship's crew, provide them with medical care, and transport them to a safe location\".\nThe United States Mission to Yemen has accused the Houthis of kidnapping crew members and has called for their immediate, unconditional safe release.\n\"We understand that the Houthis have picked up some people and we are working through multiple channels as a matter of priority to verify this information,\" Cosmoship Management said.\nRescuers are continuing their search, said Cosmoship, which has asked vessels passing in the area to assist in that effort.\nFRAUGHT PASSAGE\nEternity C had delivered a cargo for the UN World Food Program to Berbera, Somalia, and was sailing in ballast condition to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for fuel at the time of the first attack on Monday, the operator said.\nThe vessel went down on Wednesday, days after Houthis hit and sank the Magic Seas, reviving a campaign launched in November 2023 that has seen more than 100 ships attacked in what the group said was solidarity with the Palestinians in the Gaza war.\nBoth of the vessels hit this week flew Liberian flags and were operated by Greek companies. All crew from the Magic Seas were rescued before it sank.\nSome of their sister vessels in the respective fleets had made calls to Israeli ports in the past year, an analysis of shipping data showed.\n\"These are blameless victims who were simply doing their job,\" the UK-based Seafarers' Charity association said.\n\"Seafarers should be able to work safely at sea. Instead, they are being unfairly forced into the firing line.\"\nAbdul Malik al-Houthi, the leader of Yemen's Houthi fighters, reiterated in a televised address on Thursday the group's ban on companies transporting goods related to Israel through the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea.\nHe said this week's attacks were part of that ban, which has been in place since 2023.\n\"It was never stopped or cancelled, and it is a valid decision,\" he said. \"What was discovered (this week) was the violation by some companies of the decision.\"\nThe insurance cost of shipping goods through the Red Sea has more than doubled since this week's attacks, with some underwriters pausing cover for some voyages, industry sources said on Thursday.\nThe number of daily sailings through the narrow Bab al-Mandab strait, at the southern tip of the Red Sea and a gateway to the Gulf of Aden, was 32 vessels on July 9, down from 43 on July 1, Lloyd's List Intelligence data showed.\nSeveral ships on Thursday broadcast messages referring to Chinese crew and management or armed guards on board, according to MarineTraffic data. One vessel broadcast that it had no relation with Israel.\n(Reporting by Renee Maltezou and Yannis Souliotis in Athens, Jonathan Saul in London, Jana Choukeir in Dubai; Writing by Renee Maltezou, Jonathan Saul, Andrew Mills and Lisa Baertlein; Editing by Gareth Jones, Alex Richardson and Diane Craft)\nBy Renee Maltezou and Jonathan Saul\nShare © Reuters - 2025",

    "text": "At Temple B’nai Torah in Wantagh, congregants of all ages came together to take part in a day of caring and service, Mitzvah Day, on May 19. Mitzvah means a good deed done as part of one’s religious duty, and throughout the day, temple members were busy with activities that benefited those in need. Several stations were set up at the temple to address different needs in the community, from homelessness to hunger. “This is extraordinary, what we do,” Cantor Rica Timman said. “It’s an amazing, wonderful thing that involves every age.” At one station, congregants created no-sew fleece blankets for residents of Bethany House, which offers emergency shelter and transitional services to women and children in need. “We’re working with bigger organizations so we can have as big of an impact as possible,” Rabbi Daniel Bar-Nahum said. According to Bar-Nahum, Mitzvah Day was scheduled at the end of the school year to remind children in the temple to make the world better. The idea, he explained, is to kick off a summer in which children remember values that are most important to them, which includes helping those in need. “Every group in our community finds a way to target something special and specific,” Bar-Nahum said. Activities were designed and supervised by several groups in the congregation, such as the Social Action/Social Justice Committee, which focuses on helping those in the community who are struggling. According to the committee’s Co-chair Rona Kauffman, its members organize collections, educational presentations and other activities that stress civic engagement all year long. For Kauffman, Mitzvah Day is a culmination of all that work. “We’ve got a lot going on,” she said with a laugh. “It’s kind of a celebration of everything we do all year.” Grocery sorting was another activity, and congregants boxed donated nonperishable food. The boxes are picked up by Island Harvest, a food bank in Melville. At another station, children decorated and packed snack bags for young clients of the Interfaith Nutrition Network, a nonprofit in Freeport that provides essential services to those challenged by hunger, poverty and homelessness. “There’s a lot of kids who come in who are very food insecure, on the brink of homelessness, or maybe they’re in a shelter,” Kauffman said, “so this gives them a little something to feel better about.” When children are in crisis and taken out of their homes, she said, sometimes they leave with their belongings in a plastic bag. To help them transition to foster care, the temple set up a station to fill backpacks with items such as blankets, stuffed animals, and journals. The temple’s day of good deeds even extended to its Hebrew school, where second-grade teacher Colette Brancaccio cut her hair for a good cause. She was assisted by her students, who lined up to cut off a lock, and the hair was donated to Maggie’s Wigs for Kids, a nonprofit in Michigan that provides wigs and support services to children and young adults who experience hair loss due to cancer and other disorders. “This was a great opportunity for me to motivate them to do good deeds while also doing good deeds myself at the end of the school year,” Brancaccio said. She was also doing it to celebrate her sister, Gabrielle, who has been cancer-free for 15 years. Brancaccio’s mother, Dana, also participated, with Colette cutting her hair. Dana said that her daughter is an inspiration to her, and she wasn’t surprised that she wanted to get her students involved in her hair donation. Dana added that Colette gives her all when she’s with her students. “It just made me proud of the teacher she is and the person she is,” Dana said. Other temple congregants made greeting cards and filled bags with self-care items for seniors; collected prom clothes for students who can’t afford them; and organized dignity bags, personal care items for homeless women, to be delivered to the Long Island Coalition for the Homeless. For Timman, Mitzvah Day is an extraordinary effort by the temple to help those who are struggling, and she said she hoped it inspires kids to do good deeds of their own. “It’s really involving the community in a beautiful way,” Timman said, “and this is the message that we want to send our children.”",
