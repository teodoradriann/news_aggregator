    "title": "Protests in Germany: “The Whole Regime Is Shifting to the Right” - Left Voice",
    "text": "Since Friday, over 1.4 million people have protested the far-right party AfD (Alternative for Germany), according to Fridays for Future and the NGO Campact, two of the organizers. Can you talk about the scale of this mobilization and its origins? On Sunday, the mobilization in Munich was so large — about 250,000 people — that it had to be halted due to overcrowding. In Berlin, over 350,000 people marched to the Bundestag [parliament]. Demonstrations didn’t only take place in the major cities. Smaller towns were also the scene of sizable mobilizations, particularly in the east and in historic AfD strongholds. Anti-AfD mobilizations have multiplied in recent days, with over a hundred rallies held between Saturday and Sunday. Most “civil society” organizations, NGOs, religious representatives, and even Bundesliga [soccer federation] coaches, as well as youth organizations and some members of the government, had called for the protests. The trade unions, for their part, also sought to mobilize — a new development, but they didn’t mobilize in the workplaces. This broad front brought more than 1.5 million people to the streets, a mobilization unprecedented in Germany in recent years. By way of comparison, the previous major mobilization of this kind against the extreme Right, in 2018, on the initiative of the Unteilbar coalition, brought 250,000 people to the streets. The scale of the mobilization reflected the shock provoked by the revelation on January 10 by the investigative media Correctiv of a plan initiated by the AfD and neo-Nazi activists, as well as members of the conservative CDU, to mass expel several million people from the country on the basis of their origin, as well as those who come to refugees’ aid, notably in the Mediterranean. This revelation is a deep scandal at a time when the AfD has become the country’s second-strongest political force and is steadily gaining ground in the polls just a few months ahead of three important regional elections in the east, where voting intentions for the far-right party are even higher than in the rest of the country. You mention a broad “civic front” behind this protest. Over the weekend, the social-democratic chancellor Olaf Scholz joined a protest in Potsdam, as did Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and several members of the government, mobilizing to “block” the Far Right. In recent months, however, the ruling coalition has been at the forefront of serious attacks on democratic freedoms, foreigners, and workers in general. Could you elaborate? Scholz and several of his ministers have indeed decided to join the protests. While government organizations, particularly youth organizations, were very much present this weekend, it seems to me that the picture is mixed for the government, and in particular for the SPD (social democrats). First, because most of the protesters took to the streets with slogans in defense of “democracy,” more against the Far Right than in support of the government. Second, and more importantly, because besides the AfD, the whole regime is shifting to the right. Scholz’s policies, for example, were severely criticized in the marches this weekend. More and more people are becoming aware that the government is doing nothing but creating the conditions for the current growth of the Far Right. This weekend, even organizations such as Fridays for Future openly criticized the government’s policies. A situation that could spell trouble for the Greens, a member of Scholz’s coalition. In recent months, the Scholz government has pursued a particularly tough policy, especially on immigration. At the end of November, after a conference, the federal and state governments adopted a series of measures designed to reduce migration and tighten asylum policy, as well as reinforcing border controls and facilitating deportations. In line with this, Scholz recently [declared that he wants to carry out “large-scale deportations.”](https://www.leftvoice.org/the-german-government-is-paving-the-way-for-the-far-right/) Against a backdrop of the violent criminalization of the Palestinian cause, the government has also proposed in recent months to make the granting of German citizenship conditional on recognition of Israel’s right to exist. At the same time, bans on demonstrations have multiplied since October 7, with the support of all the regime’s parties, right up to the reformist left party Die Linke. Over the past few months, the Palestinian and migration issues have come together, against a backdrop of increasing racist rhetoric targeting foreigners, and Muslims in particular. This context has undoubtedly benefited the AfD. All the more so as inflation continues to eat away at public service budgets, particularly in education and health care, but also for precarious workers. There is a conscious policy of dividing workers in a difficult economic context, while there’s a massive plan passed by the Bundestag to rearm Germany, raise police budgets, and support sanctions against Russia. In my sector, education, it was explained to us that it is impossible to increase salaries because of the money paid to migrants. This weekend’s protests, however, beyond their limits, could pave the way for a different scenario. In this context, and considering the contradictions you pointed out, what possibilities are opened up by the protests of the last few days, and in particular for the intervention by the Far Left? Several polls are already showing a shift in public opinion. The latest opinion polls show growing opposition to the ongoing massacre in Gaza and to Scholz’s policy of unconditional support for Israel. In recent days, the AfD has seen a slight decline. Even the CDU was forced, after some of its activists were implicated by Correctiv’s revelations, to openly position itself against the far-right AfD. This situation could complicate the CDU’s electoral prospects for the regional elections, as the organization could need the AfD to govern, even in the event of a minority government. What is certain is that a mobilization on this scale provides an opportunity to discuss the political response to the Far Right. Many protesters in the marches, for example, called for banning the AfD. While their concern is understandable, these discussions miss the point and give the impression that the danger represented by the rise of the AfD could simply be banned by criminalizing the party, reinforcing illusions in the state. At a time when the government has been the source of serious attacks in recent months, we need to broaden our slogans and make this weekend’s mobilizations a starting point for a wider riposte, notably against anti-Muslim racism, but also because this is linked, against the genocide in Gaza, and finally against the government and the Far Right. This is not yet the direction in which the mobilization seems to be moving. This weekend, protesters in support of Palestine were thrown out of the marches, excluded, and harassed. The question of union intervention also needs to be addressed. The leadership of labor movement organizations should seek to mobilize in workplaces, convene company meetings to discuss the regime’s right-wing turn, and address the student movement in universities. This is what was at the heart of our intervention with Klasse Gegen Klasse this weekend: reminding us that no illusions could be maintained in the government or in an antifascist front from above, and that we have to organize at the grassroots. This is all the more vital given that you can’t fight the Far Right alongside those who prepare the ground for it, and adopt some of their programmatic elements. In recent months, the polarization you pointed out has been partly expressed in the eruption of a movement among farmers, as well as in calls for strikes among railway workers. Could you elaborate on these? There are signs that the social situation may be changing in Germany. Last year had already seen the return of many strikes to win back what had been lost to inflation. Unfortunately, most of these strikes achieved little, but they undoubtedly marked the return of a certain form of social conflict to Germany. But also in this contexts polarization is on the rise. The farmers’ movement of recent days has been a particularly vivid expression of this. While it expresses social aspirations, it has also served as a platform for reactionary agitation, notably on the part of Finance Minister Christian Lindner — leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (FDP), a member of the government coalition — who has endeavored to position farmers against migrants, the unemployed, and the climate movement. A central task is to link these kinds of concerns with those of the labor movement, getting the trade unions to take up the demands, to take the wind out of the sails of the Right and Far Right. From this point of view, a key factor is the calls by the metalworkers’ union IG Metall, and above all by the railways union, to reduce working hours. A historic six-day strike will begin this Wednesday at the state-owned rail operator Deutsche Bahn, after the unions rejected the company’s latest wage offer. There is undeniably a new concern about working conditions. Many workers no longer want to work 40 hours a week for poverty wages. This is also the battleground in the fight against the Far Right, and the government it uses as a staging ground. And it’s on this terrain that we need a generalized counterattack.

    "title": "Cloud Computing Kings: 7 Stocks Dominating the Digital Sky",
    "text": "Cloud computing has changed how businesses store data and make decisions. This technology enables higher productivity for corporations, small businesses and individuals. It’s also a lot more affordable to use cloud computing than it is to have physical servers. The rapid growth of the industry has resulted in many top-performing stocks that exceeded market returns. The great thing about cloud computing from an investing perspective is that the technology often becomes the backbone for its customers. That’s why many cloud computing companies have renewal rates that exceed 90%. Once a company uses cloud computing solutions, those monthly costs become a fixture in that company’s budget. These are some of the cloud computing kings that are dominating the digital sky and rewarding long-term investors. The Trade Desk (TTD) The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: [TTD](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ttd-stock-quote/)) is a rapidly growing programmatic advertising company that uses a cloud-based platform to assist businesses with ad placements. The company helps corporations run more profitable ad campaigns and is gaining market share in a space that has normally been reserved for Alphabet and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: [META](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/meta-stock-quote/)). The Trade Desk may be smaller than those two companies, but its stock has comfortably outperformed both big tech companies over the past five years. Shares have gained 67% year-to-date and are up by 543% within five years. Shares are still removed from their all-time high in November 2021 when the stock briefly exceeded $100/share. Revenue growth continues to be a strong point for the company. In the third quarter, the company [increased revenue by 25% year-over-year](https://investors.thetradedesk.com/news-events/news-details/2023/The-Trade-Desk-Reports-Third-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results/default.aspx). It’s an acceleration from the 23% year-over-year increase from the nine months ended Sep. 30. Customer retention once again exceeded 95% which has been the norm for the past nine years. Net income more than doubled year-over-year and reached $39 million in the third quarter. Monday (MNDY) Monday (NASDAQ: [MNDY](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/mndy-stock-quote/)) is a cloud-based project management system that helps companies stay on top of key tasks. The company has applications and features that aid in work management, sales customer relations management, and product development. 180,000+ customers use Monday including more than [2,000 customers who pay over $50,000/yr for the software](https://s29.q4cdn.com/881027206/files/doc_financials/2023/q3/3Q23-_-Shareholder-Letter.pdf). This customer base grew by 57% year-over-year and helped the company achieve 38% year-over-year revenue growth. High retention rates suggest the good times will keep on rolling. It’s been a good year for shareholders as the stock is up by 59% year-to-date. Shares have been roughly flat since their IPO but Monday had the unfortunate timing of going public in June 2021. [Tech stocks](https://investorplace.com/industries/technology/) like Monday crashed in 2022 before rebounding in 2023. Shares [briefly traded over $400/share](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MNDY/monday/stock-price-history) which means the stock has to more than double to reclaim its all-time high. The company only has a $9 billion market cap and recently reported a profitable quarter. ServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow (NYSE: [NOW](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/now-stock-quote/)) is a cloud computing company that offers information technology workflows, data protection, and other services for businesses. The company serves approximately 7,700 global enterprise customers that combine for a 98% renewal rate. Many of these customers allocate large budgets for ServiceNow’s products, and the cloud computing company is experiencing growth among its seven-figure deals. The company [closed 83 new deals](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/other-document/servicenow-fact-sheet.pdf) in the third quarter each exceeding $1 million in annual revenue. The company has 1,789 customers who pay over $1 million per year and 49 customers who pay over $20 million per year. The renewals and new deals helped the company [grow revenue by 25% year-over-year](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/servicenow-third-quarter-2023-financial-results.html) while raising 2023 subscription revenues and operating margin guidance. The company’s financial strength has translated into outperformance. Shares are up by 82% year-to-date and have soared by 290% over the past five years. The company is a larger player in the cloud computing space with a $140 billion market cap but it is not the largest. Profit expansion will make the valuation easier to justify in the future. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft (NASDAQ: [MSFT](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/msft-stock-quote/)) is close to having the highest market cap in the stock market and is only behind Apple (NASDAQ: [AAPL](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/aapl-stock-quote/)) in that regard. The company’s historical outperformance stems from the leadership’s ability to capitalize on innovative technology like cloud computing and make acquisitions to fill in any gaps. Shares are up by 56% year-to-date and have gained 272% over the past five years. The stock offers a 0.80% dividend yield but that isn’t the company’s strength. Microsoft’s versatility and high profit margins along with top and bottom-line growth make it a popular pick for many funds. Microsoft Azure is a leading cloud computing application that helps businesses store data, become more efficient, and minimize the risk of cyber attacks. Azure helped Microsoft’s “server products and cloud services” revenue increase by 21% year-over-year in the [third quarter](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2024-q1/press-release-webcast). Microsoft as a whole grew revenue by 13% year-over-year while net income jumped by 27% year-over-year. The company is also a frontrunner in the artificial intelligence industry with OpenAI and its bundle of Microsoft Office products.

The company continues to innovate its software to increase retention. For instance, the company made several additions designed to [help DevOps and security teams address issues quickly](https://investors.datadoghq.com/news-releases/news-release-details/datadog-adds-identity-vulnerability-and-app-level-findings). Time is of the essence during a cyber attack, and a quicker response can mitigate the damage and potentially save millions of dollars. The company makes it easy to patrol your digital assets from one central hub and can detect suspicious activity. Datadog has been very rewarding for shareholders as the stock has gained 70% year-to-date. DDOG is up by 240% over the past five years. Datadog has given investors several reasons to be excited in recent quarters. The company became profitable and is rapidly expanding its margins. In the [third quarter](https://investors.datadoghq.com/static-files/27c898b8-fb12-48b8-af68-5958f226a2fc), Datadog posted $22 million in unaudited net income and grew revenue by 25% year-over-year. The company has a reliable foundation of 3,130 customers that generate over $100,000 in annual recurring revenue for the company. Datadog also has a [healthy balance sheet](https://investors.datadoghq.com/static-files/0b16f121-198b-46c7-8920-5707c84f0769) to support continued growth. Total current assets are at $2.8 billion while total current liabilities are $842 million. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (NASDAQ: [GOOG](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/goog-stock-quote/), NASDAQ: [GOOGL](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/googl-stock-quote/)) got its start as a search engine. The company still makes the majority of its revenue from Google and YouTube advertising, but the conglomerate has expanded into other areas. Google Cloud is a high-growth segment that has paid off for Alphabet. Google Cloud helps businesses increase productivity and stay secure while lowering their costs. The company uses Generative AI to improve its product and offers [$300 in free credits on signup](https://cloud.google.com/) to entice business owners to get started. Google Cloud made up more than 10% of the company’s total revenue. It’s also growing at a fast pace and hit [$8.4 billion in revenue in the third quarter](https://www.abc.xyz/assets/4a/3e/3e08902c4a45b5cf530e267cf818/2023q3-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf). Google Cloud revenue grew by 22.5% year-over-year while the company’s overall revenue increased by 11% year-over-year. Google Cloud also become a profitable segment for the company in 2023. That segment generated $266 million in operating income in the third quarter compared to a $440 operating loss during the same time last year. Digital Ocean (DOCN) Digital Ocean (NYSE: [DOCN](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/docn-stock-quote/)) is a cloud computing company that serves small and medium-sized businesses. Most cloud computing companies focus on larger corporations which leaves an opportunity for Digital Ocean. The firm generates [$713 million in annual recurring revenue](https://investors.digitalocean.com/overview/default.aspx) and has 154,000 customers that spend more than $600 per year. It’s a smaller figure to lead with compared to companies like Datadog and ServiceNow. However, it further demonstrates Digital Ocean’s focus on smaller businesses. The strategy worked well this year as the stock is up by 50% year-to-date. The 5-year picture isn’t as impressive as shares are down by 8% during that time. The company recently reported profitable quarters including [$19 million in net income during the third quarter](https://investors.digitalocean.com/news/news-details/2023/DigitalOcean-Announces-Third-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results/default.aspx). Revenue growth came in at 16% year-over-year which is lower than previous quarters. Digital Ocean has enticing retention rates and is smaller than most of the other cloud computing companies. DOCN only has a $3 billion market cap and it looks like it can swing to the upside as profits expand. Investors should monitor revenue growth rates to see if they return to the 25%-35% levels from earlier in the year. On this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NOW and MSFT.

    "text": "TCH screencap The Ukrainian Bradley Fighting Vehicle gunner whose attack on a Russian T-90M Breakthrough tank was captured in a viral video says playing video games helped prepare him for that engagement.\nIn an interview with the Ukrainian TCH media outlet , that soldier, identified only as “Serhiy,” explained he’d just recently returned to Ukraine in December from Bradley training in Germany. Also the vehicle commander, he and his driver, Oleksandr, were only on their second mission together. Members of the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade, their job was to protect troops in a trench under fire from Russian tanks.\nA more personal and detailed interview with the crew of the Ukrainian Bradley which took on a russian T-90M. Also goes over using American-supplied Bradley IFVs in conditions of the Ukrainian winter 💪 pic.twitter.com/GtSGt8Cxiq\n— WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated) January 19, 2024 You can read all about the Bradley and what it brings to the fight in Ukraine in this recent article of ours.\nGoing up against a heavily armored T-90M, Russia’s most advanced frontline tank armed with a 125mm cannon, with the Bradley’s 25mm chain gun was risky, said Serhiy.\n“Yes, it was very scary,” he said. “But I think we did well.”\nOne of several direct hits Bradley Fighting Vehicle gunner Serhiy was able to land on a Russian T-90M tank. ( TCH screencap) “I can’t express what it means to see a tank in the sights,” said Serhiy. “In training, I was saying, ‘God forbid I see a tank in the sights.’ It so happened that I did, and very close.”\n“There was another crew that came first. It didn’t work out, so we had to muster up the courage and go.”\nSerhiy didn’t explain what happened to that other Bradley, which is seen on the second video we wrote about yesterday, which you can see below.\nHigher quality footage of a pair of Ukrainian M2A2 Bradley IFVs from the 47th Mechanized successfully dueling a Russian T-90M in Stepove, disabling it, with a follow up FPV munition strike causing the crew to abandon the damaged vehicle. pic.twitter.com/Vor8IuVlBZ\n— OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) January 13, 2024 Regardless, Serhiy’s Bradley took over the job of attacking the tank.\n“We fired with all we could” with the Bradley’s Bushmaster M242 25mm automatic cannon ‘s armor piercing rounds.\nThen there was a problem with those rounds, he said, without offering details. This is when his experience with video games kicked in.\n“But as I played video games, I remembered everything. Both how to hit and where. I could stop him at any cost.”\nMany video games over the years have highlighted the need to hit certain armored vehicles, especially tanks, in areas where their armor is thinnest and/or critical components are more exposed. Tanks are most heavily armored in the frontal hemisphere and less so in the rear. Other weak points exist, on the sides between the turret and the hull, for instance. Simply blinding the tank by destroying its sensors can result in a mission kill, leaving it repairable but useless on the battlefield, too.\nConfirming what two armor experts told us after seeing a video of the battle , Serhiy said that he switched to another type of round and began aiming for the tank’s optics. He didn’t specify what kind of round, but as our experts said , the Bradleys usually have anti-armor and high explosive rounds.\n“Due to issues with anti-armor, I started blinding him so he couldn’t leave,” said Serhiy. As we suspected, he achieved a mission kill on the tank by knocking out its optics.\nThere are three things you can watch forever.

( TCH screencap) As they stood beside their Bradley, one of nearly 200 promised by the U.S., the two men praised the vehicle.\n“This vehicle ruins enemy plans,” said Serhiy. “They really want to get us.”\nSerhiy (left) and Oleksandr are interviewed outside their Bradley Fighting Vehicle (TCH screencap) Given that Russia shows no signs of backing off its full-scale invasion, it’s very likely they will have another shot at Serhiy and his crew very soon.\nContact the author: howard@thewarzone.com\nThe post Video Games Helped Ukrainian Bradley Gunner Win Duel With Russian T-90M Tank appeared first on The Drive .",

    "title": "11 Unfortunate Things People Have In Their Homes That Keep Them Broke, According To Feng Shui",
    "text": "11 Unfortunate Things People Have In Their Homes That Keep Them Broke, According To Feng Shui\nYou might be sabotaging good energy in your living space.\nWhile feng shui has evolved and grown into a nontraditional version in the home decor and interior design space, the ancient Chinese art is rooted still in \"chi\" — the life force that lives within everything and everyone. By organizing your space, furniture, decorations, or building in a way that balances the chi, you have the power to improve the feng shui in your living space to promote peace and prosperity.\nBy setting intentions with rearranging, cleaning, or organizing your space, you can set yourself up for success, but ignoring the feng shui and natural flow of chi in your living space can have adverse effects. In fact, there are certain unfortunate things people have in their homes that keep them broke according to feng shui principles and ideas, and other home decor mistakes that sabotage their well-being.\nHere are 11 unfortunate things people have in their homes that keep them broke according to feng shui\n1. Broken appliances\nRawpixel.com | Shutterstock\nBroken appliances, furnishings, or electronics have bad feng shui. They not only symbolize stagnation, lacking energy or productivity, and neglect, but they symbolize the kind of bad energy that sabotages manifestations of abundance.\nIf you've been putting off fixing the microwave, keeping old and faulty pieces of clothing around, or even furnishing your home with broken shelves or drawers, chances are you're sabotaging wealth by keeping your space flourishing with bad and neglectful energy.\n2. Clutter near the entrance\nNew Africa | Shutterstock\nIf you have a pile of shoes in your entryway or hardly ever mop the floors inside your front door, chances are you're sabotaging wealth, prosperity, and opportunity from entering into your life.\nFeng shui is rooted in chi — the life force that brings new opportunities and things into your life. When you literally block the entrance into your living space and home with clutter, you also block the positive energy from having the chance to enter.\n3. Dead plants or flowers\nOkrasiuk | Shutterstock\nAccording to feng shui practitioner and consultant Tanita Okanovic, while there are specific symbols and natural elements that you can bring into your home to manifest wealth and abundance, having certain things — like dead plants, rotting houseplants, or unwatered flowers — can have an opposite effect.\nBringing nature and natural elements into your home is great for the feng shui and flow of chi in your living space, but letting them die without nourishment can quickly sabotage the abundance you're manifesting.\nAn unwillingness to care for the living things in your life and home is the root theme behind many of the unfortunate things people have in their homes that keep them broke according to feng shui, which is why intentionality is important when it comes to filling your space and sticking to your daily routine, even if it's just watering a plant.\n4. Trash cans without lids\nHurst Photo | Shutterstock\nWhen you have open trash in a bin without a lid, you're letting negative energy unsuspectingly seep into your environment and living space. Of course, there's a sanitary element to a trash without a lid — there's smells and visuals that aren't pleasing — but it's also a negative movement of chi into your kitchen, bathroom, or whatever room you have a trash can within.\nOur trash is symbolic of the things we're ridding from our lives. When we keep our trash too long, let it overflow into our spaces, close it behind doors, or let it linger in sight, we're allowing those things to seep back into our routines and environments in ways that can sabotage new opportunities, abundance, and wealth.\n5. An open toilet lid\nPrastiRodPhan | Shutterstock\nSimilar to trash cans or recycling bins, toilets are often placed in a practical area. But without intentional decorations or actions, they can sabotage our prosperity and good chi energy. When the toilet seat is left open, it's not just leading to a less sanitary space, it's draining good energy from the room.\nAccording to feng shui coach Kim Julen and certified feng shui consultant Ping Deters, \"Open toilet lids don't just cause unmitigated grossness, they're also the biggest drain of positive energy in the home, so be sure to close the lid. For the same reason, you also want to cover up drains in the tub and shower.\"\nWhen you're intentional about flushing with the lid closed and leaving it closed when you're not using it, you can promote a more balanced flow of chi in your bathroom and a more intentionally positive energetic space.\n6. Trash in closed spaces\naslysun | Shutterstock\nOf course, it's convenient to keep your trash tucked away in a closed closet or in a kitchen nook, but these spaces are some of the unfortunate things people have in their homes that keep them broke according to feng shui.\nAccording to feng shui educator Anjie Cho, trash is symbolic — it's what we're getting rid of from our lives. And being intentional about the practical use of garbage cans is important for protecting our energy.\nIt should never be the first thing someone sees when entering into your living space. Find a spot for it outside of the focal point in a room, where it's accessible, but still not being hidden away.\nWhen it's behind a closed door or in a closed space, it can represent the repressed things we're hiding from — like emotions or even financial concerns — and remain unresolved until it's brought into view.\n7. Mirrors facing doors\nProstock-studio | Shutterstock\nAccording to feng shui expert Suzanne Roynon, mirrors are powerful tools for feng shui, as they replicate and double the things that we \"see\" in our homes. When you place a mirror facing your bed, you're doubling the energy of your restful state in that room, sabotaging quality sleep and restful energy.\nSimilarly, when a mirror is facing an entrance — like a front door or an entry way in your bedroom — it's attracting and repelling the opportunities and energy entering, sabotaging newness and abundance from making its way to you. Be intentional about the things you want to see and bounce back into your space.\n8. Negative or gloomy artwork\nAndrew Angelov | Shutterstock\nBeing intentional about the kinds of artwork and symbols you bring into your home and greatly affect your manifestations and energy. For example, having photos of withering plants, stormy scenes, and dark artistry in your bedroom can quickly sabotage the calmness and restfulness the space is supposed to spark.\nWhen it comes to financial abundance and wealth, it's important to also intentionally pick artwork and home decor that helps to promote success in those areas, rather than subconsciously sabotage it.\nFeng shui and curating spaces with chi in mind is all about intentionality. When you make choices and pick home decor, you're bringing new energy into your living environment. Be careful with the kinds of depictions and energy you allow in.\n9. Storage underneath a bed\nMaster1305 | Shutterstock\nClutter underneath a bed, whether it's storage or random clothing items lost from laundry baskets, can all sabotage restfulness and tranquility in your living space. When you're battling with lacking sleep and rest, it's not just your general well-being and peace that's altered, but your ability to be productive and make decisions — financial or otherwise — in your best interest.\nBe intentional about where you're allowing clutter and chaotic energy to live in your home. Of course, you can never completely rid your living space of \"stuff,\" but having clear spaces for all of it to live can ensure you're not sabotaging your energy.\n10. Furniture facing away from the door\nLook Studio | Shutterstock\nPositioning your furniture in an intentional way, using feng shui to guide your home decor and choices, and help better energy to flow within your living space. Furniture that forces you to sit with your back to the door or an entrance into a room is one of the unfortunate things people have in their homes that keep them broke according to feng shui, which is why making intentional choices about furnishing is important.\nWhen you're always turned away from an entrance, you're not receptive to newness — from financial opportunities, to good energy, and even abundance or wealth. By crafting a space where you have a view of an entrance and the ability to move freely in a room without dodging furniture, you're more likely to accept and appreciate new energy.\n11. Nonmetal furnishings\nProstock-studio | Shutterstock\nMetal furnishings and decor often spark clarity in a living space, so incorporating metal objects into your home office or working space can ensure that you're balancing calm and productive energies at home. If you're feeling disorganized, scattered, or overwhelmed at home — the space that's supposed to be most calming and grounding in your routine — it could partially be a fault of the materials from your furnishings.\nWhen you make little intentional choices with feng shui in mind, you're helping to balance chi, manifesting abundance, wealth, and calmness into your space, even when you're not actively thinking about it.\nZayda Slabbekoorn is a staff writer with a bachelor's degree in social relations & policy and gender studies who focuses on psychology, relationships, self-help, and human interest stories.",

    "text": "'Tyranny of the bosses': How Musk plans to trample workers’ rights across the board\nElon Musk at the 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland on February 20, 2025.jpg)(Gage Skidmore)\nBreaking Social\nBillionaire Elon Musk, leader of Tesla, SpaceX and X.com and head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is making it clear that no federal government agency in the U.S. is safe from mass layoffs. The Trump Administration and DOGE are drawing criticism not only from liberals and progressives, but also, from some Never Trump conservatives on the right.\nMSNBC's Joe Scarborough and former Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Michael Steele, for example, are saying that while they are fine with fat and pork being trimmed from the federal government, the U.S. is facing a dangerous threat when vital experts — such as air traffic controllers, food inspectors and health officials — are being arbitrarily laid off.\nIn an article published by Salon on March 28, journalist James Hassett argues that the damage being inflicted by the DOGE layoffs goes way beyond putting so many federal employees out of work at once — it is an attack on workers' rights across the board.\nREAD MORE: 'Open declaration': Hegseth slammed over new tattoo seen as insult 'to the Muslim world'\n\"From arbitrary layoffs to intimidation tactics to targeted harassment,\" Hassett warns, \"Elon Musk has brought the tyrannical practices of the corporate Americaworld to the federal government…. Musk has led his legally ambiguous 'Department of Government Efficiency,' known as DOGE, on a rampage across the federal services — an attack that resembles the ruthless cost-cutting of private equity acquisitions, or rather, Musk’s own disastrous takeover of Twitter.\"\nHassett adds, \"With Trump's fawning approval, Musk is dismantling the American constitutional system, flouting federal law to purge perceived ideological enemies from the civil service and circumventing congressional authority by cutting off appropriated federal funding — and doing so in open defiance of the courts.\"\nDescribing Musk as a \"corporate hatchet man,\" Hassett stresses that the DOGE head favors a workplace in which employees have few, if any, rights.\n\"Musk doesn't just bring Silicon Valley's 'disruptor' mindset to DC — he embodies the idea that the executive, whether a CEO or a president, should be the unbridled sovereign of his domain,\" Hassett explains. \"A boss can hire and fire at will, cancel contracts and direct funding without any checks to his power. Now, Musk threatens to remake the federal government into a business — with the president as an all-powerful boss. Musk and Trump don’t just want the government to run like a business, they want to rule it like one. Welcome to the tyranny of the bosses…. It's not efficiency that Musk pursues, but authority.\"\nREAD MORE: 'Game over': Yale fascism expert moving to Canada because US is becoming a 'dictatorship'\nJames Hassett's full article for Salon is available at this link.",
