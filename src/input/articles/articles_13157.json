It's like, why, who?\" Jimmy Bullard has revealed he has been told a football club employed a private investigator to follow him in a bid to catch him breaking internal rules.\nThe former Fulham, Wigan and Hull star, 45, did not say which of his former employers allegedly hired the sleuth. But he told how he has personally spoken to him and has seen photographs of himself apparently taken during surveillance, including one of him playing golf.\nBullard, whose career saw him called up once for England before a knee injury forced him to retire, said he first made contact with the man earlier this year after he sent him a private message on Instagram.\nRecalling their first conversation, via phone, the former midfielder said: \"He said 'I private investigated you once while you was playing for a football club.\nImage: FC Bullard/YouTube) FC Bullard/YouTube)\n\"I followed you... a club got in touch with me and they wanted me to find any rule that you broke in your contract...

Stakeholders said the first turbines have started spinning, feeding electricity into Victoria’s grid. When the 1.3-gigawatt wind farm reaches completion in 2027, it is expected to power 765,000 homes in Victoria and meet 9 percent of the state's current energy demand. The Golden Plains complex also will be coupled with 300 megawatts of battery-storage capacity upon completion. “Victoria is the clean energy investment capital of Australia,” said Lily D'Ambrosio, energy minister in the Parliament of Victoria, “and this project is another example of how Victoria’s ambitious renewable-energy policies are creating jobs and driving the renewables sector.\" TagEnergy, a global renewable energy enterprise, began the first stage",

    "text": "Argentine farmers made good progress sowing corn and soy crops following recent abundant rainfall, the Buenos Aires grains exchange said on Thursday, as industry groups prepare to fight government plans to hike export taxes on their produce.\nThe South American nation is one of the world’s top exporters of corn, soybean oil and soy meal, but its last harvest was devastated by a historic drought. Faced with a severe economic crisis, Argentina’s new government is looking to the sector to boost its tax take.\nThe grains exchange said in a weekly report that soybean planting is 78.6% complete after advancing 9.5 percentage points in seven days, while corn planting has also progressed well and is now 69.9% complete.\nArgentine farmers should plant some 17.3 million hectares of soybean and 7.1 million hectares of corn this season, according to the exchange’s estimates.\nWheat farmers have meanwhile harvested some 70.9% of an estimated 14.7 million-metric-ton harvest, it added, noting it had not yet assessed the extent of damages from strong winds and hail that swept farmlands alongside the recent rains.\nThe report comes a day after the government of President Javier Milei sent a package of economic reforms to Congress, including a proposal to hike export taxes on the country’s key grain products, sparking backlash from the sector.\nArgentina’s CAA agro-industrial council said it would alert lawmakers about this “erroneous decision,” arguing the measure goes against the new right-wing government’s pledges to boost employment, production and exports.\n“We will seek to have the duty hike corrected and eliminated,” the council said in a statement.\nSource: Reuters (Reporting by Maximilian Heath; Writing by Sarah Morland and Alistair Bell)\n2023-12-29 ",

The Met Office has warned that snow and freezing rain are likely to lead to disruption across the region and possibly up to 7cm of snow in some areas.\nThere is a chance that some rural communities could become cut off due to delays and cancellations to public transport, road closures and some untreated pavements becoming impassable. This weather warning is in place from 6pm on Saturday, January 4 until 12pm on Sunday, January 5.\nThe Met Office states: \"Snow will become persistent and locally heavy as it pushes south to north across the warning area. As well as snow, a period of freezing rain is also likely bringing some hazardous travel conditions, before milder air follows across all areas by Sunday morning.\n\"Whilst there is some uncertainty in details, 3-7 cm of snow is likely for much of the warning area, with locally 15-30 cm for the higher ground of Wales and the southern Pennines. Freezing rain could lead to ice accretion in places, especially parts of Wales, before the milder air leads to a rapid thaw of snow and ice in the south of the warning area through Sunday.\"\nThe amber warning covers a portion of the county to the east, including Lincoln, Sleaford, Gainsborough and Scunthorpe. Meanwhile there is a yellow warning for snow and ice in place across all of Lincolnshire except some parts of the coast between Grimsby and Skegness.\nThis yellow warning is in place from 12pm on Saturday, January 4 until 11.59pm on Sunday, January 5. It warns that \"heavy snow, and some freezing rain in places, may cause some disruption over the weekend.\"\nAccording to the forecast, Lincoln will not go above 3C on Saturday and at times it will feel as cold as -2C. The cold temperatures are expected to continue into next week. Snow is currently forecast between midnight on Sunday and 6am.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
