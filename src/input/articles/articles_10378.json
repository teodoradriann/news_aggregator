    "text": "Jason Kelce said it was \"surreal\" to meet the British Royal Family. The 36-year-old retired NFL star met Prince William and his children Prince George and Princess Charlotte at Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour show at London’s Wembley Stadium last month and Jason revealed he found it strange to be mixing with royalty. He told PEOPLE: \"It was a nice interaction. They were lovely, and it was surreal to even be in their presence.” Jason and his brother Travis, 34 – who has been dating Taylor for the past year - previously spoke about the meeting on their &apos;New Heights With Jason and Travis Kelce&apos; podcast, with Travis calling William \"the coolest motherf \". Travis said: \"Dude, he was the coolest motherf .\" Jason interjected and described William as \"awesome\", while Travis added: \"He was so cool.\" The Kansas City Chiefs sportsman also admitted he wasn&apos;t sure what the right protocol was when meeting the royals, explaining he didn&apos;t know whether to \"bow\", \"curtsy\", or \"just be an American idiot and shake their hand\". He said: \"We wanted to be polite, especially on this side of the park.\" He also joked that he had never seen Jason \"give someone that much respect\" when he got the chance to talk to them at the gig. He quipped: \"You put your beer, like, 10 feet away from you.\" Referencing a viral video of himself holding a beer cup between his teeth during one of Taylor&apos;s gigs, Jason teased: \"I didn&apos;t have it in my teeth when I met [Prince William]!\" He continued: \"They were wonderful people, and that&apos;s what it&apos;s about. You know? Obviously, literally part of a monarchy, royalty. Yeah. \"Hard to be a down to earth human being, I would assume. But came off that way completely.” Travis agreed, adding: \"Very genuine, very cool.\"",

Above the people, the legislature and now the courts.”\nWA GOP Chair Jim Walsh posted a\nresponse on Facebook that says in part: \"The cynical thing about Reykdal encouraging public school districts to break the law is that he faces little (direct) consequence. The districts will be the ones sued and held liable if they follow his dumb advice. WA school districts: Ignore Chris Reykdal. Do the right thing. Follow the law.\"\nThe lawsuit challenging the new law was filed 2 weeks ago and this week King County Superior Court denied the plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order, which would have blocked it from taking effect Thursday.\nOn June 21, the Court will consider a preliminary injunction.",

    "title": "Chingu Amiga confiesa que \"ganó su libertad\" en México - UnoTV",
    "text": "Sujin Kim, influencer surcoreana conocida como Chingu Amiga, confesó en entrevista con [Unotv.com](https://www.unotv.com/) que vivir en México le ayudó a conseguir una libertad que no habría podido encontrar en su país natal. Esta libertad fue, justamente, el factor que le permitió afrontar un reto como “LOL: Temporada 6“. “Puedo morir feliz en este momento”: Chingu Amiga La influencer, que recientemente llegó a los 10 millones de suscriptores en YouTube, reconoció que los más de cuatro años que ha vivido en México le ayudaron a ser libre de ser ella misma. “Esta libertad que gané es lo que me hizo actuar como yo, me hizo poder vivir una vida como a mí me gusta. En Corea sentía que estaba viviendo como la gente quería, pero aquí yo estoy viviendo como a mí me gusta”.Sujin Kim (Chingu Amiga) En una emotiva conversación con UnoTV, la creadora de contenido expresó que podría morir feliz en este momento. Según sus palabras, la cultura mexicana le da la posibilidad de expresarse tanto como ella quiere e, incluso, pintarse el pelo de color. [TE RECOMENDAMOS: [Eugenio Derbez confesó que muchos de sus amigos no se atreven a participar en LOL](https://www.unotv.com/entretenimiento/eugenio-derbez-confeso-que-muchos-de-sus-amigos-no-se-atreven-a-participar-en-lol/)] Su libertad le ayudó a participar en “LOL: Temporada 6” Chingu Amiga también confesó que, de seguir viviendo en Corea del Sur, y recibir una oferta como la de “LOL: Temporada 6“, probablemente no se habría atrevido a participar en el proyecto. “En Corea es muy difícil que una persona hable y haga reír a alguien más. Con mis amigas, se molestan de mí, porque prefieren que sea más callada y reservada (…) piensan que uno quiere sobresalir cuando no debería”, dijo Sujin Kim. En este sentido, reconoce que aún suele inhibirse ocasionalmente cuando se percata de que está hablando sin parar y remató: “Si hubiera estado en Corea, no me hubiera atrevido a hacer comedia o hablar así“. Al vivir en México y poder demostrar más su personalidad, la youtuber reconoció que se preparó mucho, aprovechando su capacidad para burlarse de sí misma para generar humor. ¿La familia de Chingu Amiga pudo verla en “LOL”? El padre de Sujin Kim, quien incluso le mostró su orgullo cuando alcanzó los 10 millones de seguidores en YouTube, no pudo verla en “LOL” por una curiosa razón. “No pudieron ver porque no existe Amazon en Corea“, bromeó Chingu Amiga, sin embargo, aseguró que sus padres han podido ver fragmentos del show. Su mamá reconoció su esfuerzo a secas, mientras que su papá celebró su participación. - “LOL” es un concepto en el que varios comediantes son metidos a un espacio reducido durante varias horas. Los participantes deben buscar que los demás re rían, pero sin reírse en el intento. El último en reír, gana. La sexta temporada está disponible en Amazon Prime Video. Chingu Amiga reconoció que, al salir de la casa de “LOL“, salió con el trauma de que nadie se reía de sus chistes, por más que lo intentara.",

    "text": "Igor Babuschkin, a co-founder of Elon Musk's xAI, announced his departure from the company he helped establish in 2023. Babuschkin, who led engineering teams and was instrumental in building the startup's AI models, is leaving to launch his own venture capital firm, Babuschkin Ventures.\nIn a post on X, Babuschkin stated that his new firm will focus on supporting AI safety research and backing startups dedicated to \"advancing humanity.\" This move comes after he was reportedly inspired by a dinner with Max Tegmark of the Future of Life Institute, where they discussed building AI systems safely. Babuschkin previously worked at Google DeepMind and OpenAI, where he was involved in pioneering projects like AlphaStar.\nHis exit follows a turbulent period for xAI, which has faced several scandals involving its AI chatbot, Grok. The chatbot has been at the center of controversies, including citing Musk's personal opinions on controversial topics, making antisemitic comments, and generating AI-based nude videos of public figures like Taylor Swift. These issues have at times overshadowed the strong performance of xAI's models on industry benchmarks.\nBabuschkin's departure also comes amid environmental concerns surrounding xAI's supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee. The facility's temporary gas turbines have been criticized by environmentalists for emitting pollution into nearby communities, a claim that Babuschkin’s post did not address. He did, however, reflect positively on his time at xAI, crediting Musk for teaching him to \"be fearless\" and have a \"maniacal sense of urgency.\"\nRead More: Elon Musk takes on Apple in app store antitrust battle\nADVERTISEMENT",

    "text": "Mexican president calls on civilians not to support drug cartels despite any pressure Mexico's president is calling on citizens not to support drug cartels or oppose the installation of National Guard barracks, after a number of videos surfaced showing residents cheering convoys of cartel gunmen MEXICO CITY -- Mexico’s president called on citizens Friday not to support drug cartels, or oppose the installation of National Guard barracks, after a number of videos surfaced showing residents cheering convoys of cartel gunmen. Several videos have been posted on social media in recent weeks of villages in southern Chiapas, showing farmers lining roadways near the border with Guatemala and cheering convoys of Sinaloa Cartel gunmen. The Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels are fighting turf battles in the region to control the smuggling of drugs and migrants, and income from extortion. “I want to call on people not to support the gangs,” President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Friday, noting that he understood that the gangs may be pressuring civilians to appear in such videos “out of fear” of reprisals. López Obrador acknowledged the cartels have mounted a public relations effort. “They are going to shoot videos and post them on social media, they also have propaganda operations,” the president said. “They tell people ‘line up on the highway,’ and if people don't line up, they could be subject to reprisals.” But López Obrador also accused anybody who opposes the building of National Guard barracks in their communities of aiding the cartels. “If they don't want the Guard to be there, they are protecting criminals,” he said. In fact, residents of several municipalities across [Mexico](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/Mexico) have opposed barracks construction for various reasons, including that they would be on environmentally sensitive or culturally significant land, or because they don’t feel the Guards’ presence helps. López Obrador has dispatched more troops and guard officers to Chiapas in the last few months as the violence has grown worse. Despite that, hundreds of local residents who live around the Angostura dam reservoir in Chiapas took the desperate step this week of fleeing in boats across the lake, after cartel gunmen engaged in shootouts near their homes. “There was gunfire lasting more than a half hour, bullets hit our houses and vehicles were set on fire,” said Mauricio Gómez. Gómez and 20 of his relatives have taken refuge in the nearby city of Comitan. “They told us we couldn't return,” he said of the cartel gunmen. But it's not clear whether Gomez and his relatives can continue to stay in Comitan. They are staying with six other families in a house that a local resident lent them. López Obrador has made the quasi-military National Guard the centerpiece of law enforcement in Mexico, though critics say its expansion has come at the expense of civilian police, who in many cases are better suited to investigate and prevent crime. There is no doubt there have been incidents — especially in the western state of Michoacan — in which drug cartels have forced local residents to demonstrate against the army and National Guard, and even attack or confront federal forces. But inhabitants in many parts of Mexico have been left under the complete domination of the cartels for years, forcing them into a form of coexistence with the gangs. In the southern Pacific coast state of Guerrero, residents have been subjected to drug cartel extortion and violence for around two decades. On Friday, authorities found four bodies dumped on a highway near the state capital, Chilpancingo, and three other men were shot to death in a bar. The killings were under investigation and it was not immediately clear whether the deaths were related to ongoing drug gang turf battles in Chilpancingo. The city's mayor was seen in a video posted on social media earlier this year sitting a restaurant chatting calmly with the leaders of one of the gangs.",

    "text": "When the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are considered children under state law, its chief justice had a higher authority in mind.\nBy citing verses from the Bible and Christian theologians in his concurring opinion, Chief Justice Tom Parker alarmed advocates for church-state separation, while delighting religious conservatives who oppose abortion.\nHuman life, Parker wrote, “cannot be wrongfully destroyed without incurring the wrath of a holy God, who views the destruction of His image as an affront to Himself.”\nThe Alabama court's ruling last week stemmed from wrongful death lawsuits brought by couples whose frozen embryos were accidentally destroyed.\nAdvertisement\nThe most immediate impact of the ruling was to leave in vitro fertilization clinics in Alabama potentially vulnerable to more lawsuits and reluctant to administer treatment. But not far behind were mounting worries about Parker's explicit references to Christian theology.\nWhile Parker’s concurring opinion does not carry the force of precedent, advocates for church-state separation fear he could inspire judges in other states to push the envelope.\nGet Breaking News Alerts Stay up-to-date with important news developments, delivered right to your inbox. Enter Email Sign Up “Now we’re in a place where government officials feel emboldened to say the quiet part out loud, and directly challenge the separation of church and state, a foundational part of our democracy,” said Rachel Laser, CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.\nShe said Parker's opinion was just the latest example – and a brazen one at that – of government officials advocating for Christian nationalism, a movement that seeks to privilege Christianity and fuse Christian and American identity.\nOther instances she cited include Missouri lawmakers citing Catholic and biblical teachings for restricting abortion and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson saying the notion of church-state separation in the U.S. was a \"misnomer.\"\nParker argued in his opinion that the court was merely enforcing the Alabama state constitution, which was amended in 2018 to recognize \"the sanctity of unborn life.” That principle has “deep roots that reach back to the creation of man ‘in the image of God,’” Parker said, quoting the Book of Genesis.\nAdvertisement\nParker sprinkled his opinion with a litany of religious sources, from classic Christian theologians like St. Thomas Aquinas and John Calvin, to a modern conservative Christian manifesto, the Manhattan Declaration, that opposes “anti-life” measures.\nHe also quoted a Bible verse that is legendary within the anti-abortion movement, in which God told the prophet Jeremiah, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.”\nThe roots of a ruling The Alabama court’s ruling that frozen embryos are children is an extension of the ideology that undergirds the anti-abortion movement, said Mary Ziegler, a historian of the abortion debate and a law professor at the University of California, Davis.\nAnd it points to the influence of the conservative Christian legal movement, she said. Namely, its position \"that the U.S. has an intrinsically Christian Constitution\" — a notion that Ziegler and many historians reject.\n“The point, I think, for the movement was never just getting rid of Roe,\" Ziegler said. \"It was always to achieve fetal personhood,” the idea that human rights are conferred at conception.\nThe Alabama ruling could influence decisions in other state courts and legislatures, particularly in the 11 states that already have fetal personhood language in their laws, Ziegler said. But because it’s about the interpretation of a state law, she said the case is unlikely to make its way to the Supreme Court.\nAdvertisement\n‘Victory for life’ Some anti-abortion activists rejoiced at the ruling.\nIt’s “a tremendous victory for life,” said the powerful Christian legal firm Alliance Defending Freedom. “A beautiful defense of life,\" said Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Council.\nThe Liberty Counsel filed a notice with the Florida Supreme Court, saying the Alabama decision — including Parker's concurrence — should be factored into a pending decision about a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would protect abortion rights.\n“Unborn life must be protected at every stage,” Mat Staver, Liberty Counsel's chairman, said in a statement.\nStill, Christian perspectives on IVF are mixed, and in some cases, undecided.\nWhile the Catholic Church condemns such reproductive technology as immoral, many Protestant churches and denominations do not have a firm stance against the practice.\nKellyanne Conway, the political consultant who worked for former President Donald Trump, lobbied GOP lawmakers in December to advocate for contraception and fertility treatments. She cited her firm's finding that even anti-abortion evangelicals overwhelmingly support access to IVF.\nJustice Parker’s mission Parker is no stranger to church-state debates.\nHe served as former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore's spokesperson during fights over a Ten Commandments monument Moore erected inside the building housing the Supreme Court.\nParker is a member of Frazer Church, a Montgomery megachurch that until 2022 was part of the United Methodist Church. The congregation, which left amid a UMC schism over the denomination not upholding its LGBTQ clergy and marriage bans, is now part of the Free Methodist Church, a more conservative denomination.\nAdvertisement\nNeither United Methodists nor Free Methodists specifically condemn IVF in their church doctrines. The Free Methodist Book of Discipline emphasizes the value of human life at all stages. It notes that reproductive technologies raise many “ethical, medical, legal and theological questions even as they offer hope.”\nParker was the founding executive director of what is now called the Alabama Policy Institute, which is associated with the evangelical ministry Focus on the Family. On its website, Focus on the Family recommends that married couples not freeze or discard embryos created during IVF.\nFertility experts say IVF without the option of frozen embryos would likely increase the costs of fertility treatments and reduce the chances for patients trying to have a baby.\nA setback for the secular state? Because religious groups have different opinions about when life begins, “it’s quite problematic to see a judge essentially embedding a Christian view into state law,” said Greer Donley, an associate professor of law at the University of Pittsburgh who specializes in bioethics and health.\nShe said that other judges might increasingly apply religious thinking to their decisions.\n“It’s particularly notable that (Parker) is not trying to hide that, but even if judges were careful in their language, the result is essentially the same,” Donley said.\nLaser, of Americans United, said that even the Alabama court's majority decision — which does not explicitly reference religion — is problematic; it states that all participants in the case “agree that an unborn child is a genetically unique human being whose life begins at fertilization and ends at death.”\nAdvertisement",
