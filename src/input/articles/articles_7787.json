    "text": "Operation Jal Rahat is underway in Nagaland, Assam, and Manipur, addressing heavy rains and urban flooding. As of July 10th, 40 relief columns have rescued 3,820 people, distributed 1,361 food packets, and provided medical aid to 2,095 individuals.\nNew Delhi: The Indian Army has been carrying out rescue and relief operations across multiple flood-affected areas, providing critical assistance to the people of Himachal Pradesh and northeastern states In Himachal Pradesh, the Indian Army, in close coordination with the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and local authorities, has deployed dedicated relief columns across key locations including Thunag, Bagsiad, and Pandoh.\nAs part of its Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations, the Army column has been actively engaged in opening of vital access routes, providing medical assistance and distribution of relief material, aid to inaccessible villages among others. On July 6, a critical mule track from Bagsiad to Thunag was successfully cleared which enabled the delivery of essential supplies. At Thunag, the troops distributed relief materials, including first aid and ration kits to affected families.\nIn partnership with civil administration, the Army has also ensured delivery of relief material to remote villages cut off by the flood. “All columns are in communication via mobile networks, with limited coverage at some locations like Thunag. Satellite communications including ISAT phone, RS STARSV and HX systems have been provided to ensure uninterrupted operational connectivity,” an official said.\nArmy launches Operation Jal Rahat 2\nIn response to the recent wave of heavy rains and urban flooding in the northeastern region, the Army has launched Jal Rahat 2, with coordinated deployment across Nagaland, Assam, and Manipur. These efforts are being led by Headquarters Inspector General Assam Rifles (North) [HQ IGAR (N)] in collaboration with local civil administration.\nNagaland\nOn July 10, the Deputy Commissioner of Dimapur formally requisitioned assistance from the Indian Army to provide immediate flood relief in Singrijan Colony, one of the worst-hit areas. The Army swiftly responded with the deployment of an Engineer Task Force (ETF) team. While a verbal de-requisition was received later in the day, the Army remains on standby with resources mobilised through the Flood Relief Control Centre at HQ IGAR (N).\nAssam\nIn Upper Assam, the Dhansiri River in Golaghat district has breached danger levels. Although water levels are now receding, the Indian Army continues to monitor the situation closely and is ready to intervene should the need arise.\nManipur\nIn Manipur, the Nambol River flowing through Imphal West and Bishnupur districts has also surpassed danger levels. While floodwaters are beginning to recede, the Army remains actively engaged in relief operations in coordination with civil authorities.\nFlood Relief Operations: Key Statistics\nAs of 10 July, the Army has deployed a total of 40 relief columns across the region, rescuing 3,820 individuals. A total of 1,361 food packets were distributed and provided medical aid to 2,095 individuals.",

    "text": "China boosts global marine protection China has built extensive blue partnerships to carry out all-around international cooperation on marine eco-environmental protection, contributing Chinese wisdom to global marine governance, according to a white paper released on Thursday by the State Council Information Office. \"The ocean serves as a rich repository of natural resources and a strategic priority for high-quality development,\" said Sun Shuxian, vice-minister of natural resources and director of the State Oceanic Administration, at a news conference held in Beijing for the release of the white paper. \"Amid prominent global challenges such as marine security, development and governance, China has consistently advanced global marine governance processes and remains a steadfast advocate of and active participant in the protection of marine ecosystems,\" Sun said. Since China ratified and became a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1996, the country has joined more than 30 multilateral treaties related to oceans. China has also established a policy system surrounding marine eco-environmental protection, resource conservation and management of polar activities under the framework of international conventions, the white paper said. Guo Fang, vice-minister of ecology and environment, cited the China National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and Action Plan (2023-30), which was adopted under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework of the 15th Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, or COP15. By designating the ocean as a critical focus, the plan underscores the restoration of essential yet fragile marine ecosystems such as estuaries, bays, mangroves, coral reefs and seagrass beds. With over 28,000 marine species, representing around 11 percent of the world's known species, China stands as one of the most biodiverse countries in terms of marine life, showcasing the country's efforts on marine protection and restoration, Guo said. Sun highlighted China's commitment to tackling global marine eco-environmental issues through extensive collaborative endeavors. \"China has signed marine cooperation agreements with more than 50 countries and international organizations participating in the Belt and Road Initiative, contributing significantly to solid cooperation,\" he said, adding that China has engaged in practical cooperation with countries in the European Union, Southeast Asia and Africa. China also leads in international deep-sea and polar exploration, according to the white paper. The country has conducted more than 80 scientific research voyages in the deep sea, including collaborations with Russia, Japan, Nigeria, Seychelles and Indonesia. In addition, China's approach to marine eco-environmental protection has provided insights for global marine restoration efforts. Guo cited the governance of the Bohai Sea, the semi-enclosed sea in China, which used to be plagued by problems such as water quality deterioration, ecological degradation and resource depletion. However, the water quality of 83.5 percent of nearshore areas now ranges from good to excellent. limenghan@chinadaily.com.cn [Fugitive on wanted list repatriated to US](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202407/12/WS66906550a31095c51c50dab3.html) [Astronomical satellite detects gamma-ray bursts](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202407/12/WS669060dfa31095c51c50daa4.html) [Ten photos from across China: July 5 - July 11](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202407/12/WS66905f42a31095c51c50da9d.html) [Shanghai celebrates 20th National Maritime Day with various themed activities](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202407/11/WS668fec91a31095c51c50da5c.html) [Guangzhou to suspend food delivery riders with multiple traffic violations](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202407/11/WS668fea84a31095c51c50da59.html) [Chinese scientists reveal world's largest-scale pan-cancer vascular system single-cell atlas](//www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202407/11/WS668fe3d9a31095c51c50da55.html)",

    "title": "Badminton-All change for India's Sindhu in push for Olympic gold - CNA",
    "text": "LONDON : A new coach, new mentor and a new home - India's PV Sindhu has overhauled her life in an all-out bid to land an Olympic badminton gold in Paris after having to settle for silver and bronze in the previous two Games.\nShe's now in Bengaluru, India, far from Hyderabad, where she trained through most of her career, the highlights of which include bagging the women's singles silver in Rio 2016, bronze in Tokyo and being crowned world champion in 2019.\nBut the move in October was deemed essential for Sindhu, who wanted to be closer to her new mentor, Prakash Padukone, the Indian badminton great and father of Bollywood superstar Deepika Padukone.\nThat's not the only change Sindhu has made as she gears up to be \"smarter\" for the Paris 2024 Olympics, having recently replaced several members of her team, from her personal fitness trainer to her physiotherapist.\nThis week, Indonesia's Agus Dwi Santoso started coaching Sindhu, who parted company with Malaysia's Muhammad Hafiz Hashim, whom she first said she would work with in July after splitting with long-time coach Park Tae-Sang earlier in the year.\n\"I'd been training with Hafiz and then I wanted some change - I thought it was not suiting my game - and that's when I asked Agus,\" Sindhu told Reuters in an interview.\n\"It's a new year, a new team. Every aspect I touch on is going to be completely different,\" Sindhu said. \"Paris is something that's an ultimate game for us. I think we need to be 100 per cent in every aspect, physically, in skill and in strategy.\n\"It's always good to have some change,\" said the 28-year-old, who decided she had to shake up her team and \"go forward\" with Agus, whom she has known for years.\n\"He's really good for me because every coach has a different mindset. It's super tough; you're fatigued, you're tired but they (help you) get back that strength and they make sure your muscles are strong enough to be back on court the next day.\"\nSindhu, who has previously raised awareness about the stigma surrounding prioritising mental health in sports, said she also has a \"mental trainer.\"\n\"Some of it is meditation, but at the same time it's important that you know what's going on in your head while playing, there's a lot of pressure or responsibility, a lot of expectation,\" she said.\nSindhu said she went into the Rio 2016 Games as an underdog and had no pressure before smashing her way to a silver medal after upsetting Japan's Nozomi Okuhara in the semis. Spain's Carolina Marin beat Sindhu to the gold, however, closing out a 19-21 21-12 21-15 victory.\n\"Tokyo was much harder than Rio because I lost in the semi-finals and there were expectations.\"\nIn Tokyo, then-world number one women's singles shuttler Taiwan's Tai Tzu-Ying beat Sindhu and took the silver medal.\nNonetheless, Sindhu is the only Indian to become badminton world champion and only the second individual athlete from India to win two consecutive medals at the Olympic Games.\n\"If I want to achieve something - and my aim is to achieve the Olympic gold - then I would do anything for it,\" Sindhu said. \"It means everything to me.\"\nSource: Reuters Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...

    "text": "Drought Relief The Past Week The good news about the rain we saw earlier this week across the state: some drought relief! While we still have 0.25% of the state under D3 Extreme Drought (down in far southeastern Minnesota), we saw weekly decreases in the D0-D2 drought categories - decreasing by 13.19% for D0 Abnormally Dry, 4.68% for D1 Moderate Drought, and 5.59% for D2 Severe Drought.\nHere's a look at where we did see that improvement in the drought situation over the past week. A lot of it occurred across central Minnesota, which saw some of the heaviest precipitation over the seven-day period that went into the Drought Monitor update (which has a data cutoff of 7 AM Tuesday).\nMany of these areas across central Minnesota saw 1.5-3\" of liquid over the seven days ending Tuesday morning, with a lot of that occurring around Christmas.\nWarm, Wet, Not-So-Snowy December It's been a weird December, with warm temperatures, rainy weather, and not a lot of snow. We are on track to see the warmest December on record as temperatures at/above average are expected to continue through the end of the month. In the precipitation department, we're currently sitting at the 12th overall wettest December on record. If we saw no more snow, it would be the 8th least snowiest December on record.\nLooking at precipitation, this December will be the wettest on record in St. Cloud. Meanwhile, Duluth is sitting at its overall 7th wettest December.\nSunnier Skies For Friday A nice, quiet Friday will be in place for any travel across the metro with sunny skies. While morning temperatures will start in the upper 20s, highs look to climb to around 40F.\nQuiet, sunny weather is expected across much of the state on Friday as any cloud cover or fog in both northwestern and southeastern Minnesota quickly clears in the morning hours. Highs will be in the 30s to low 40s - once again about 15-20F degrees above average for the end of December.\nCooler To End 2023 - Clipper Brings Light Snow Saturday Night It's the last weekend of 2023! Here's what's on tap:\nSaturday : We will be watching a clipper system and cold front approach the state. This will start to bring some snow into northern Minnesota during the afternoon hours, but won't impact the metro until Saturday Night. Otherwise, a mainly cloudy Saturday is on tap with highs in the low to mid-40s.\nSaturday Night : While not shown above, that is when the chance for a few tenths of an inch of snow will occur across the metro. Lows bottom out in the mid-20s.\nSunday : For the last day of 2023, we'll have pushed out that clipper system by sunrise. It'll be slightly cooler behind that cold front with highs in the low 30s. Cloudy skies stick around.\nMonday : Happy New Year! Mainly sunny conditions are expected with highs in the low 30s.\nForecast loop between 6 AM Saturday and 6 PM Sunday.\nHere's a look at that clipper system that'll bring our next chance of some quick-hitting snow across mainly northern and eastern Minnesota Saturday into Saturday Night. Precipitation will start across northern Minnesota in the late morning hours Saturday, spreading to Duluth in the late afternoon hours, and clipping at least parts of the metro Saturday Night. Snowfall will have cleared the state by midday Sunday.\nThe heaviest snow with this clipper is expected across northern Minnesota - particularly in the Arrowhead - where totals of 1-2.5\" will be possible. Snow totals will decrease as you head toward the metro, with maybe half an inch possible. The greatest snow totals in the metro currently appear to be on the north and east sides. Despite the lighter totals toward the metro, slick surfaces will be possible.\nHeading out to celebrate the New Year - or to the Vikings/Packers game - on Sunday evening? Clouds will be on the decrease as we head through the evening hours with temperatures in the 20s. By Midnight, it'll feel like the upper teens.\nHighs right around 30F are expected across the state on the first day of 2024 with mainly sunny skies. This will be after temperatures start the day around 20F in the metro.\nOld Man Winter Just Can't Be Bothered\nBy Paul Douglas\nOld Man Winter is ghosting us. He's distant, disinterested and listless. It seems there's a new kid in town, El Nino, who is stealing the limelight. Hijacking the jet stream, flooding North America with a firehose of relatively mild, Pacific air.\nPersistent winds howling from the west are a). mild and b). generally dry with big storms pushed south of Minnesota. This pattern may change in January and February. Big snowstorms are possible during Super El Nino patterns, but as my dear wife of 40 years keeps reminding me: lower your expectations.\nI expect the sun to be out much of today, and with a lack of snowcover more of the sun's energy can go into heating the air instead of melting snow. We may hit 40F before a weekend clipper drops a coating of snow Saturday night into early Sunday.\nFirst week of 2024? Ditto.

Why it matters: A hotter 2024 would lend credence to the hypothesis that global warming is accelerating. \"If things follow the normal pattern, 2024 should be a bit hotter than 2023. But 'the normal pattern' may not exist anymore,\" said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University. \"In any event, it's certainly going to be one of the hottest years in the record.\" The big picture: The combination of human-caused global warming from the burning of fossil fuels for energy, along with deforestation, plus other factors like a naturally occurring El Niño, have boosted 2023's record warmth, stunning many in the scientific community. \"\nBiden Administration Takes Historic Step to Protect Old-Growth Forest\nMore from Inside Climate News : \" In an unprecedented step to preserve and maintain the most carbon-rich elements of U.S. forests in an era of climate change, President Joe Biden's administration last week proposed to end commercially driven logging of old-growth trees in National Forests. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, who oversees the U.S. Forest Service, issued a Notice of Intent to amend the land management plans of all 128 National Forests to prioritize old-growth conservation and recognize the oldest trees' unique role in carbon storage. It would be the first nationwide amendment to forest plans in the 118-year history of the Forest Service, where local rangers typically have the final word on how to balance forests' role in watershed, wildlife and recreation with the agency's mandate to maintain a \"sustained yield\" of timber. \"\nFord will follow Toyota as it leans into hybrids, scaling back EV targets\nMore from electrek : \" As Ford struggles amid the industry's shift to EVs, the automaker plans to lean into its hybrids. In a move that mirrors Toyota, Ford is scaling back its transition to EVs to bet on hybrids. Despite Ford's EV sales hitting a new record with 8,958 electric vehicles sold in November, the automaker is scaling back. Ford sold more F-150 Lightning models last month (4,393) than it did in the entire third quarter (3,503). The Lightning edged out Rivian's R1T for the top-selling electric truck spot through November. Despite this, Ford's CEO Jim Farley explained on the company's Q3 earnings call that he's \"so thankful we have kept our foot on the has to freshen our ICE and HEV products as we enter a changing market.\" \"",

    "text": "Artificial intelligence is now essential for triaging threats, automating routine work, and flagging the most urgent cases.Canada has been bombarded by an unprecedented wave of cyberattacks this year, with security firm Fortinet reporting more than 12 billion malicious attempts in just the first six months of 2025.From its Burnaby campus, one of Fortinet’s largest global hubs, hundreds of cybersecurity analysts work around the clock to track, block, and investigate threats. The company says cybercriminals are evolving rapidly, and in many cases, they no longer even need to write their code.“We’re on the dark web every day, we’re threat-hunting, we’re creating those protections,” said Derek Manky, Fortinet’s chief security strategist, in an interaction with CTVNews. “The business model now is crime-as-a-service, and it’s making criminals faster and more sophisticated.”The crime-as-a-service model would allow hackers to buy ready-made ransomware or data theft tools online, enabling attacks at scale. Manufacturers have been the top targets so far this year, followed closely by health-care providers and critical infrastructure sectors once considered off-limits by many hackers.“When you have more affiliates working for you, everyone has a different mentality,” Manky said. “The ethics start to go out the window, and it becomes more competitive.”AI on the frontlinesThe flood of attacks has left cybersecurity teams drowning in alerts. Fortinet says artificial intelligence is now essential for triaging threats, automating routine work, and flagging the most urgent cases.“It’s avoiding analyst burnout and allowing cybersecurity professionals to get new skills and embrace the technology,” Manky said.The company’s latest threat report also highlights a spike in automated scans targeting industrial control systems and Internet-of-Things devices, along with a surge in stolen credentials being sold on underground forums.Founded in 2000, Fortinet’s Burnaby facility now serves as a research, product development, and training hub, linking more than 500 threat researchers worldwide. Collectively, they analyze millions of events every minute, blocking the vast majority before they ever reach their intended targets.",
