    "title": "Study Reveals How Ultra-Processed Foods May Fuel Bowel Cancer",
    "text": "Colorectal cancer's characteristic tumors are spurred on by chronic inflammation, and new research shows this might be linked to a diet of ultra-processed foods high in unhealthy oils.\nWHO stats show colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. People over the age of 50 make up the majority of cases, but recent studies show diagnoses in younger people are on the rise00600-4).\nIn colorectal cancer, the body's inflammation and resolving processes – the alarm bells that recruit the body's cells to battle, or tell them when to stand down – are thrown off balance, leading to a suppressed immune system and kicking cell formation into overdrive.\nWhen the body is fighting a tumor that won't quit, it makes sense not to add more fuel to the fire in the form of ultra-processed foods that inflame even tumor-free guts.\n\"It is well known that patients with unhealthy diets have increased inflammation in their bodies. We now see this inflammation in the colon tumors themselves, and cancer is like a chronic wound that won't heal,\" says surgery professor Timothy Yeatman from the University of South Florida (USF).\n\"If your body is living off of daily ultra-processed foods, its ability to heal that wound decreases due to the inflammation and suppression of the immune system that ultimately allows the cancer to grow.\"\nMany unprocessed food sources contain a balance of fats that our bodies can use to mount an inflammatory response, and wind it down afterwards. The omega-3 in avocados, for instance, metabolizes into bioactive lipid compounds that actively resolve inflammation.\n\"Bioactive lipids are very small molecules derived from the foods that we eat… If the molecules are coming from processed food products, they directly imbalance the immune system and drive chronic inflammation,\" says USF pharmacologist Ganesh Halade.\nHighly processed foods, common in a Western diet, are stripped of the lipids and fiber that would balance out the remaining excess of omega-6 fatty acids.\nAn example is the linolenic acid in vegetable oils (sunflower, rapeseed, canola, corn, etc), which metabolizes into arachidonic acid (AA), an important player in the pathway to inflammation. Diets high in omega-6 fatty acids have strong links to chronic inflammation and colorectal cancer, and this new study brings us closer to understanding why.\nThe researchers used liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to assess the lipids found within the colon tumors of 81 people, and in the normal mucosa of 81 matched healthy people.\nThe cancerous tumors were filled with molecules that promote inflammation – especially those derived from AA – and had nowhere near enough of the mediators that resolve it and promote healing.\nThe lipids tasked with switching between these processes were either inadequate or ineffective in the tumors, contributing to the cancer's development.\n\"A human's immune system can be extremely powerful and drastically impact the tumor microenvironment, which is great if harnessed correctly for health and wellness,\" Yeatman says. \"But not if it's suppressed by inflammatory lipids from processed foods.\"\nRestoring that balance by encouraging patients to eat healthy, unprocessed foods rich with omega-3 fatty acids and derivatives of fish oil called 'specialized pro-resolving mediators' may give their bodies much-needed relief from the chronic inflammation fueling their tumors.\nThe immune potential of this tumor microenvironment could be used to treat colorectal cancer, and with further research, this may prove to be the case for other tumor types, too.\nThis research was published in the journal Gut.",

There is an Elevated Fire Danger alert for parts of Northern Virginia, including Fairfax County, for Friday, Nov. 1.\nElevated potential for the rapid spread of fire is expected this afternoon to early evening due to the combination of dry conditions and gusty winds. Relative humidity values drop to around 25 to 35 percent, along with sustained northwesterly around 15 mph and gusts to 20 to 30 mph. This will result in the rapid drying of fine fuels like grass, leaves and small shrubs.\n- You are urged to exercise caution if handling open flames or equipment that create sparks.\n- Dispose of cigarette butts, matches and other flammable items in appropriate containers.\n- Keep vehicles off of dry grass and obey local burn bans. Most dry grasses, dead leaves and other tree litter could easily ignite and spread a fire quickly.\nDiscover more from Fairfax County Emergency Information\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.",

Например, у одного из нарушителей обнаружили шпаргалку, но то, что было на этой шпаргалке, удивило абсолютно всех организаторов оценивания. Это была таблица умножения. Здесь действительно стоит задуматься о том, что является основой обучения и как обеспечить овладение базовыми знаниями и навыками в рамках каждого из учебных предметов\", - сказала она в эфире национального телемарафона в четверг.\nКроме того, Вакуленко рассказала, что, как и в прошлые годы, есть определенное количество нарушителей правил прохождения НМТ, но их немного.\nРанее Вакуленко опровергала информацию из социальных сетей о сложности и \"оторванности от реальности\" НМТ по математике. В частности, она подчеркивала, что для преодоления минимального проходного балла нужно знать предмет на уровне 7-го класса.\n\"На мой взгляд, если поступающий или поступающая не способны выполнить задания 5-го, 6-го, 7-го классов, то, наверное, нужно несколько подождать с высшим образованием и наверстать школьные программы для того, чтобы комфортно себя чувствовать в учреждениях высшего образования\", - заявляла директор.\nКак сообщалось, в 2025 году НМТ включает тестирование по обязательным учебным предметам: \"украинский язык\", \"математика\", \"история Украины\" и учебного предмета по выбору (\"иностранный язык\", \"биология\", \"география\", \"физика\", \"химия\", \"украинская литература\"). НМТ по истории Украины будет охватывать весь курс истории с древнейших времен до наших дней. Тестирование будет проходить во время основных и дополнительных сессий. Основные состоялись в течение 14 мая - 25 июня; дополнительные пройдут 14-25 июля.\nРанее УЦОКО опровергал распространенную в социальных сетях информацию о содержании НМТ по истории Украины, о сложности и \"оторванности от реальности\" НМТ по математике, о чрезмерной сложности НМТ по английскому языку, а также заявил, что ни одна из подборок тестовых заданий НМТ по английскому языку не содержит вопросов IELTS или других международных тестов.\nТеги:\nЕЩЕ ПО ТЕМЕ: РЕКЛАМА РЕКЛАМА UKR.NET- новини з усієї України\nРЕКЛАМА",

    "text": "Commenter Réagir Envoyer par mail Envoyer Partager sur Facebook Partager Partager sur Twitter Twitter La polémique s’envenime. Alors que la municipalité d’Hiroshima avait accueilli l’ambassadeur d’Israël le 6 août à la cérémonie marquant les 79 ans du bombardement atomique de la ville par les Américains, la ville de Nagasaki a refusé d’inviter vendredi 9 août Gilad Cohen, tout en conviant le représentant de la Palestine au Japon, Waleed Siam. En conséquence, plusieurs ambassadeurs de pays occidentaux – Australie, Italie, Canada, Union européenne, Allemagne, France, États-Unis et Royaume-Uni – ont annoncé mercredi 7 août qu’ils ne se rendraient pas à la cérémonie commémorative.\nBoycott de plusieurs ambassadeurs occidentaux Dans un pays d’ordinaire si paisible, cette absence fait figure de véritable tempête diplomatique. Les cérémonies du souvenir des deux bombes atomiques larguées par les Américains les 6 et 9 août 1945 sur Hiroshima (140 000 morts) et sur Nagasaki (80 000 morts) sont si symboliques que le moindre faux pas diplomatique secoue la sensibilité de l’opinion japonaise, qui a du mal à comprendre ce boycott. Le maire de Nagasaki, Shiro Suzuki, a jugé cette décision « regrettable ».\nDans une lettre qui lui a été envoyée en juillet, l’Australie, l’Italie, le Canada, l’Union européenne, l’Allemagne, les États-Unis et le Royaume-Uni avaient prévenu qu’il leur serait « difficile d’avoir une participation de haut niveau à cet événement » si Israël en était exclu.\nÀ lire aussi Japon : le conflit israélo-palestinien s’invite à Hiroshima et Nagasaki L’édile de Nagasaki avait souligné la semaine dernière que la décision de ne pas inviter Gilad Cohen n’était pas motivée par des considérations politiques, mais par la volonté de « tenir la cérémonie dans une atmosphère paisible et sombre » , en raison du risque de manifestations liées à la guerre dans la bande de Gaza. Shiro Suzuki avait écrit en juin à l’ambassade d’Israël pour appeler à un « cessez-le-feu immédiat » dans ce territoire palestinien.\nPolitisation des cérémonies commémoratives L’ambassadeur américain Rahm Emanuel a choisi de ne pas se déplacer pour la commémoration à cause de « la politisation par le maire de Nagasaki de l’événement » . Cet ancien chef de cabinet de Barack Obama, lorsque ce dernier était président des États-Unis, participera à un autre événement dans un temple de Tokyo.\nÉgalement absente de Nagasaki, l’ambassadrice britannique Julia Longbottom estime que le fait de ne pas convier Israël « crée une équivalence malheureuse et trompeuse avec la Russie et la Biélorussie, les deux seuls autres pays qui n’aient pas non plus été invités à la cérémonie de cette année » . Les deux États ne sont plus les bienvenus à cet événement depuis l’invasion de l’Ukraine, en 2022.\nÀ lire aussi Chasse à la baleine : le Japon ira jusqu’au bout contre Paul Watson La France sera, elle, représentée par le numéro deux de l’ambassade, qui regrette auprès de l’Agence France-Presse une décision « regrettable et contestable » .\n« Un mauvais message au monde » Gilad Cohen, présent à Hiroshima mardi 6 août, avait dit la semaine dernière que la décision de Nagasaki envoyait « un mauvais message au monde » . Lundi, il a déclaré à la chaîne américaine CNN que les problèmes de sécurité, invoqués par le maire de Nagasaki, étaient « inventés » et qu’il était « vraiment surpris que (Shiro Suzuki) détourne cette cérémonie pour des motivations politiques » . D’autant que les ambassadeurs de Syrie, du Yémen, de la Chine, de la Birmanie et d’Afghanistan, qui ne sont pas des modèles de respect des droits humains, ont été conviés.\nÀ lire aussi JO 2024 : la fièvre olympique s’empare du Japon Le porte-parole du gouvernement japonais, Yoshimasa Hayashi, s’est refusé à tout commentaire mercredi, les invitations relevant d’ « une décision de l’organisateur, la ville de Nagasaki » . La position officielle du gouvernement japonais tranche avec celle du maire de Nagasaki. Tokyo soutient le droit d’Israël à se défendre pour répondre au massacre du Hamas le 7 octobre.",
