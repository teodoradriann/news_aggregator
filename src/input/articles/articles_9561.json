    "title": "3 Songs by Lainey Wilson that Will Make You Tear Up",
    "text": "Louisiana-born singer/songwriter Lainey Wilson is red hot today in the country music genre. Thanks to her 2022 album Bell Bottom Country and its fiery hit single “Wildflowers and Wild Horses,” Wilson’s name has rocketed up the charts and she’s garnered handfuls of prestigious awards.\nBut while “Wildflowers and Wild Horses” is a whiplash of a song, that doesn’t mean Wilson doesn’t know how to live on the sensitive side of the sonic street. Indeed, just as she is able to walk through a ring of flames , Wilson is able to tug at your heartstrings. And these three songs from the artist are evidence of just that.\n[RELATED: Top 10 Lainey Wilson Songs]\n“Rolling Stone,” from Sayin’ What I’m Thinkin’ (2021) One of the most important aspects of country music is the honesty it can offer, that heart-on-your sleeve quality. And on Wilson’s 2021 album Sayin’ What I’m Thinkin’ , she offers that exact quality, especially on the LP’s 11th track, “Rolling Stone.” The track is about love but it’s also about distance—a combination that can tug at anyone’s soul. On the offering, Wilson sings of the juxtaposition between the two.\nAin’t got a thing to do with love\nI was born to roll like a tumbleweed does\nAnd I belong to a long highway\nAnd there it goes, callin’ my name\nCallin’ my name\nCallin’ my name\nThink you’re the one that’s gonna turn me around\nGive me a ring and settle me down\nGot a little old on me, don’t get me wrong\nBut, baby, my heart runs wild and free\nYou gotta know ‘fore you fall for me\nLike a feather in the wind, I could be gone\nYou don’t give a rock to a rolling stone\nNo, you don’t give a rock to a rolling stone\n“Heart Like a Truck,” from Bell Bottom Country (2022) From Wilson’s 2022 album Bell Bottom Country , this song is both powerful and melancholy. Wilson compares her heart to a country music staple—a truck. It’s both sturdy and well-worn; reliable and used. On the song, she’s vulnerable—she goes as far to say heart’s been drug through the mud , which is something many of us can relate to in our own lives.\nI never stay in one place too long\nA dirt road’s singing me a siren song\nI gotta find a field\nI need to spin my wheels\nI got a hankering for four wide tires\nAnd I can’t help it it’s the way I’m wired\n‘Fore you get too close\nBoy you need to know\nI got a heart like a truck\nIt’s been drug through the mud\nRuns on dreams and gasoline\nAnd that ole highway holds the key\nIt’s got a lead foot down when it’s leaving\nLord knows it’s taken a hell of a beating\nA little bit of love is all that it’s needing\nBut it’s good as it is tough\nI got a heart like a truck\n“Things a Man Oughta Know,” from Sayin’ What I’m Thinkin’ (2020) Sometimes when you hear words of wisdom the right way, they can make you pause and reflect both on your life and who you were in it. Sometimes it takes an emotional gut punch to stop you in your tracks and help you change course. That’s exactly what this song does. Released first on Wilson’s 2020 Redneck Hollywood EP (and later on the 2021 album Sayin’ What I’m Thinkin’ ), this is the song that put Wilson on the proverbial map—and for good reason. She presents a wise and generous self, mixing with an emotive quality that can put a lump in your throat.\nIf I can’t have it, I can do without\nI can hang a picture same as I can take it down\nAnd how to keep it hidden when a heart gets broke\nYeah, I know a few things a man oughta know\nHow to know when it’s love\nHow to stay when it’s tough\nHow to know you’re messin’ up a good thing\nAnd how to fix it ‘fore it’s too late\nAnd yeah, I know a boy\nWho gave up and got it wrong\nIf you really love a woman, you don’t let her go\nYeah, I know a few things a man oughta know\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.\nPhoto by Kevin Winter/Getty Images",

    "title": "La Nina Will Complicate Things For Biden Ahead Of Elections As Hurricanes Threaten Oil Refineries | ZeroHedge",
    "text": "La Nina Will Complicate Things For Biden Ahead Of Elections As Hurricanes Threaten Oil Refineries The Biden administration must now contend with the La Nina weather phenomenon, which is expected to fuel an active Atlantic hurricane season. These storms could potentially disrupt major US Gulf Coast refineries, driving average gasoline prices at the pump to the politically sensitive $4 a gallon mark ahead of the November presidential elections. News last month of the Department of Energy planning to release a million barrels of gasoline from reserves held in the Northeast ahead of the Fourth of July holiday and summer driving season shows just how concerned Democrats in the White House are about elevated inflation as their election odds falter . According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, La Nina conditions indicate reduced wind shear in the Alantic Basin, which promotes more tropical development in the Caribbean Sea. \"The upcoming Atlantic hurricane season is expected to have above-normal activity due to a confluence of factors, including near-record warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, development of La Nina conditions in the Pacific, reduced Atlantic trade winds and less wind shear, all of which tend to favor tropical storm formation,\" NOAA wrote in a recent update. Here's a breakdown of NOAA's hurricane season forecast: NOAA predicts an 85% chance of an above-normal 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. There's a 10% chance of a near-normal season. There's a 5% chance of a below-normal season. The forecast includes 17 to 25 total named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher). 8 to 13 of these storms are expected to become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher). 4 to 7 of the hurricanes may become major hurricanes (category 3, 4, or 5; winds of 111 mph or higher). Forecasters have 70% confidence in this range Given the context that La Nina is set to produce a more active hurricane season, Goldman analysts are now focusing on the potential refinery impacts of these storms and what this could potentially mean for gasoline prices at the pump. Goldman's Callum Bruce's base case is that gasoline pump prices average around $3.3/gallon through October. Bruce estimates pump prices in October could jump to the politically sensitive level of nearly $4 if the hurricane season is super active. If the season is calm, prices drop to $3.2. Here's more from the report: This fall's hurricane season, focused around August-October, but spilling modestly into July and November, may therefore be unusually important for the upcoming US Presidential election. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season, issuing a record high forecast for storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes in its May outlook. The midpoint of its stated forecast ranges for each category is 100-200% of their historical averages (Exhibit 3). Hurricanes have the potential to cause significant disruptions to US Gulf Coast refining capacity, where c.50% of US capacity lies. Most hurricanes that hit the refining centers on the Gulf Coast will take out 0.5-2.5 mb/d of refining capacity temporarily. Hurricane disruptions in the top quartile of events will take out more than 1mb/d of capacity for over a month. While these impacts are mostly temporary, large disruptions can leave c.10% of the peak disrupted capacity offline for a more extended period of time (Exhibit 4). Wholesale gasoline refining margins have the potential to spike around these events (Exhibit 5), by $5/bbl or more, depending on the exact path of the hurricanes. Gasoline prices tend to be most volatile as – unlike distillate – the US is a net importer, and resupply is much further away. The price impact tends to dissipate relatively quickly, however, as refining capacity returns relatively rapidly. In addition, there can be significant negative impacts on demand from the poor weather and flooding. We find that large USGC hurricanes disrupt 100 kb/d of demand on average in the affected months, and closer to 300 kb/d for the largest. Evacuations provide only a modest offsetting boost (<25 kb/d). Diesel margins meanwhile benefit more sustainably as demand is only modestly impacted (<50 kb/d) as reconstruction and rescue efforts support consumption (Exhibit 6). Nevertheless, retail gasoline prices can remain supported for longer as retailers are slow to lower prices after the initial spike, allowing marketing margins to expand. Despite normalized wholesale gasoline margins within a month, the top quartile of hurricane disruptions saw retail gasoline margins $0.20/gal higher over the following couple of months. The largest hurricanes have the capacity to raise these retail prices by almost $0.50/gal at their peak over this time period (Exhibit 7). This may be amplified by a normalisation in current very low speculative positioning in refined products – 10th-20th percentile across refined products. Our prior research has found a c.$5/bbl impact on wholesale refined product margins simply from positioning normalisation, equating to around c.$0.10/gal at the retail level. A significant hurricane disruption combined with a normalisation in positioning could therefore lift Oct-24 retail gasoline prices by $0.2-0.5/gal above our baseline forecasts over the full month (Exhibit 8). An extreme disruption would therefore take US retail gasoline prices to $4/gal, potentially leading to a spike in media coverage. However, retail prices would drop to $3.2/gal if crude prices are flat and disruptions are avoided. Queue up more SPR gasoline dumps if the active hurricane season takes out a refinery or two, as the administration will do everything in its power to prevent pump prices from hitting $4 before the elections.

    "text": "Трамп заявил о «конце прогресса» между Украиной и Россией\nПрезидент США Дональд Трамп перестал излучать оптимизм по поводу российско-украинских переговоров. Отвечая на вопрос журналиста о том, какие козыри есть у Вашингтона в плане принуждения сторон к миру, хозяин Белого дома ответил, что прогресс между Москвой и Киевом подошёл к концу.\nАмериканский лидер подчеркнул, что ранее США удалось достичь определённых результатов в достижении дипломатического урегулирования. Однако сейчас всё изменилось.\n- заявил Трамп.\nОчевидно, речь идёт об обмене ударами, которые происходят между конфликтующими сторонами в последние недели. Между тем не совсем понятно, что имел в виду президент США под выражением «не должны были».\nВероятно, это упрёк в адрес главы киевского режима Зеленского и его операции «Паутина», в ходе которой были атакованы наши аэродромы со стратегической\nавиацией. В Вашингтоне заявляют, что ничего не знали о намерениях Киева, и обвинили украинское руководство в разжигании третьей мировой войны.\nВ то же время Трамп выразил недовольство и российской стороной. Как он выразился, наша страна теряет много солдат, как и Украина, но при этом у него складывается впечатление, что президенту РФ Владимиру Путину «безразлично».\n- подытожил хозяин Белого дома.\nНапомним, что в администрации США в последнее время всё чаще заявляют о возможном выходе из переговорного процесса по Украине в случае отсутствия прогресса.",
