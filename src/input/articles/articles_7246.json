    "title": "Bethlehem ‘without Christmas trees, without lights’ due to Israel-Hamas war | Salisbury Journal",
    "text": "Bethlehem, the normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus, resembles a ghost town this Christmas Eve, with celebrations called off due to the Israel-Hamas war. The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square are missing, as are the foreign tourists who gather each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrol the empty square. Gift shops have been slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did open their doors once the rain stopped pouring down. There are few visitors, however. Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years, said: “This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there’s just darkness.” He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, symbolising the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounds the scene, with grey rubble added to the spectacle reflecting none of the lights and bursts of colour that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square, said: “We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to.” Mr Salameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. “Normally, you can’t find a single chair to sit, we’re full from morning till midnight,” he said. This year, just one table was taken – by journalists sheltering from the rain. He said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and was not able to cover operating costs. Mr Salameh estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income – almost all of that during the Christmas season. With many major airlines cancelling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say around 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed. More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel’s air and ground offensive against Gaza’s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault October 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since October 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.

Ein 19-Jähriger wurde in den USA von einem industriellen Fleischwolf erfasst. Für den jungen Mann kam jede Hilfe zu spät.\nAlles in Kürze\n- 19-Jähriger von Fleischwolf erfasst und getötet\n- Vorfall in Burrito-Fabrik in Vernon, Kalifornien\n- Polizei bewertet den Vorfall als Arbeitsunfall\n- Opfer wollte Maschine reinigen, als sie sich angeschaltet hat\n- Unternehmen will mit Ermittlern zusammenarbeiten\nNach dem schrecklichen Unglück vom Sonntag stehen die Angestellten der Burrito-Fabrik in Vernon (Kalifornien) unter Schock.\nDer junge Fabrikarbeiter, dessen Name nicht veröffentlicht wurde, kam am Sonntagabend ums Leben. Nach allem was bekannt ist, wollte der 19-Jährige soeben einen industriellen Fleischwolf reinigen, berichtet abc7.\nDoch plötzlich schaltete sich die Maschine an: Der junge Mann rief noch um Hilfe, seine Kollegen versuchten noch, die Maschine abzuschalten. Vergeblich.\nDer 19-Jährige wurde regelrecht zerhäckselt. Seine Kollegen mussten alles mitansehen, sie standen nach dem Vorfall unter Schock.\nPolizei bewertet den Vorfall als Arbeitsunfall\nDer Vorfall passierte in einer Fabrik des Unternehmens \"Tina's Burritos\", einer in den USA beliebten Marke für mexikanische Spezialitäten. Das Opfer war zuletzt für das Reinigungsteam der Fabrik im Einsatz.\nDie örtliche Polizei wertet den schrecklichen Vorfall als Arbeitsunfall. Man sehe keine Anzeichen, die für ein Fremdverschulden sprechen, sagte Sergeant Daniel Onopa vom Vernon Police Department zu Journalisten.\n\"Unser tiefes Mitgefühl gilt seiner Familie, seinen Freunden und allen, die ihn kannten und mit ihm zusammengearbeitet haben. Dies ist ein verheerender Verlust für alle bei Tina's.\" Das Unternehmen will mit den Ermittlern zusammenarbeiten und das tragische Unglück lückenlos aufklären.\nTragische Unglücke wie dieses passieren leider häufiger. Zuvor verfing sich in Griechenland eine 50-jährige Reinigungskraft mit ihren Haaren in einem Fleischwolf. Die arme Frau wurde vor den Augen ihrer Tochter in das Gerät gezogen und zerfleischt.\nTitelfoto: 123rf/davit85",

    "title": "Romanian defense chief: Russia 'will not stop' with war in Ukraine, calls for better preparation amid potential conflict with NATO",
    "text": "In an [interview](https://romania.europalibera.org/a/interviu-one-2-one-generalul-gheorghita-vlad/32799927.html) with Europa Libera Romania on Feb. 1, Romanian Chief of Defense Gheorghita Vlad urged Romania and Europe to better prepare for a potential war with Russia, warning that Russia will continue its escalation if it is successful in Ukraine. \"The Russian Federation has become a problem for the world order, for democracy. In fact, it is a war of Russia with the democratic world. It is not a war with Ukraine,\" said Vlad, Romania's highest-ranking military officer. Vlad, who was recently [appointed](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/who_is_who_172922.htm) Chief of Defense in November 2023, said he believes that Russia \"will not stop\" at Ukraine. \"If (Russian President Vladimir Putin) wins in Ukraine, the main target will be the Republic of Moldova. We will witness tensions in the Western Balkans. I am more than convinced that President Putin's policy will escalate in the immediate future.\" Vlad's comments come as European and NATO officials have warned in recent weeks civilians in NATO countries should be prepared for the prospect of an all-out war with Russia. Although there is little consensus as to when Russia may launch an attack against Europe, NATO officials [warned](https://kyivindependent.com/nato-official-warns-of-all-out-war-with-russia-within-next-20-years/) a military confrontation could occur within the next 20 years. Other NATO commanders and alliance leaders have warned in increasingly stark terms about the dangers of such a war, [indicating](https://kyivindependent.com/polands-national-security-chief-russia-could-attack-nato-within-3-years/) it could occur as soon as within the next three years. NATO officials believe that Russia may target a NATO alliance member in Eastern Europe, including countries such as Poland, Estonia, Romania, and Lithuania. While the prospect of the war escalating to an all-out clash between the alliance and Russia has so far been averted, there are concerns that the West has not truly accepted that it may still be a possibility. Echoing these sentiments, General Vlad urged NATO countries to replenish arms stocks while prepare their population for escalatory aggression from Russia. \"We need to discuss a policy for preparing the population,\" said Vlad, referring to held up Romanian legislation that seeks introduce voluntary military training for Romanians aged 18 to 35. Earlier this week, NATO officials warned that there are still some issues in preparations for conflict that could hinder an appropriate response from NATO, such as problems with the interchangeability of [NATO equipment and personnel](https://kyivindependent.com/reuters-uk-to-commit-20-000-personnel-to-nato-exercises/). Vlad confirmed that Romania currently has 80,000 professional soldiers in its military and aims to increase that number to around 120,000 active personnel. Vlad also noted that Romania's military reserves have remained at the levels seen in 2007.",

    "text": "Getty Image\nFanatics’ Michael Rubin is walking back his comments on black culture.\nEarlier this week, Rubin went viral on social media when he went on the Breakfast Club and made comments criticizing black culture while defending his friend Meek Mill.\n“Look, I’m just being blunt. It’s me, It’s the one thing I’ve learned about Black culture that I don’t like is that Black hate on hate.”\n“I think there’s a little bit of Black culture where it’s Black hate on hate. It’s like that Black judge that Meek had, that hated on him and want to go extra hard on him. Okay. I, it’s what people always say to me. It’s like black hate on hate, so I think it’s terrible. It’s something that I think it’s culturally wrong and I’ll probably get killed for saying this.”\nHow do y'all feel about Fanatics founder, Michael Rubin saying this about Black culture? pic.twitter.com/ZFCgMp2S78\n— Yours in negritude, Ryan K. Smith. (@MeWeFree_) August 14, 2024\nA day after going viral, Rubin apologized for making the remarks.\n“I got a phone call from one of the people I have the most respect for in the world – they told me while they appreciate my intention, it’s not my place to speak on black culture. I get it and really appreciate the input!”\n“My intention was to say how important it is that we need to uplift each other, stop hate on each other, and push each other to win, and always root for each other’s success!”\n“My bad , Much love and appreciate the feedback”\nMeek Mill also commented on Rubin’s rant.\nRubin shouldn’t be saying that type stuff out loud … a black man suppose to but nobody saying it… Its like we only collab on songs women and parties… he be hearing my friends getting murdered like why meek, I can’t explain it to him in a sensible way!\n— MeekMill (@MeekMill) August 15, 2024",

    "text": "Due to the extreme cold wave, all schools in Noida for students from classes to 8 will remain closed starting from today until further notice. The District Magistrate of Gautam Buddha Nagar, Manish Kucmar Verma, has made this decision because of the severe cold weather conditions and fog in the area.\nThis closure includes all schools, whether they follow the state board, CBSE, or ICSE curriculum. Rahul Panwar, the district’s basic Education Officer, sent a letter to all school principals in Noida to inform them of the closure. According to the official notice, the closure is necessary due to the worsening situation of weather conditions and the problems students would face traveling through fog. On Thursday, the temperature in the region was between 8-27 degree celsius, according to the Indian Metrological Department.\nDecember 29, temperature dropped suddenly, and similar measures were taken in other districts like Meerut and Bagpat. Schools in Ghaziabad were also closed on December 30 due to heavy rainfall.\nWinter Vacation in UP and Other State\nMany schools in Uttar Pradesh have started their winter vacation and will remain closed until January 15.
