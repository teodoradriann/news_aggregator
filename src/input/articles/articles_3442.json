    "text": "[KNA/CNS photo/Paul Haring (Archivbild)]\nCardinal dean denies rumours of Pope Francis' resignation\nRome - The cardinal dean is not only a key figure in the Vatican intrigue in the cinema film \"Conclave\". The real dean Giovanni Battista Re is now intervening in the debate in Rome about a papal resignation.\nPublished on 21.02.2025 at 10:22 –The Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re (91), has intervened in the current debate about the possible resignation of Pope Francis, who is ill. Re told the Italian daily newspaper \"Repubblica\" (Friday): \"The Pope is on the road to recovery, let's not make things up. There should be no talk of resignation, he will return to the Vatican in a few days.\"\nRegarding rumours that cardinals are already meeting to prepare for a conclave, Re said: \"The dean has not had a meeting of cardinals.\" When a pope dies or resigns, it is up to the cardinal dean to convene the cardinals to Rome to elect a successor.\nSeveral cardinals speculate\nThe previous day, several cardinals had declared to the press in Rome that a papal resignation was possible. However, the President of the Italian Bishops' Conference, Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, emphasised that, according to his information, the Pope was on the way to a full recovery. He hoped that this would happen as soon as possible.\nThe cardinals who spoke of the possibility of a resignation, however, pointed out that Francis could consider resigning if his health remains severely impaired in the long term. His predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, resigned in 2013 because he no longer felt able to fulfil his office with the necessary strength.\nMeanwhile, Pope Francis' condition has apparently stabilised further. As the Vatican announced on Friday morning, the 88-year-old spent a quiet night in the Gemelli Clinic in Rome and got up for breakfast. The day before, there had been talk of slightly improved blood values. Meanwhile, there is also speculation in the Italian media as to whether the Pope will be able to leave hospital next week.
