    "title": "Future of diplomacy: CICERO, hagglebots and the turing test",
    "text": "Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the landscape of diplomacy and negotiation. While AI has long been associated with computational efficiency, its ability to engage in complex, strategic and cooperative decision-making represents a major shift in international relations. Meta’s CICERO, an AI system that achieved human-level performance in a strategy game named Diplomacy, stands as a landmark development in AI-assisted negotiation and strategic interaction. Alongside similar advances, such as Hagglebots, AI is now being positioned not just as an analytical tool but as a potential actor in diplomatic practice. This shift raises fundamental questions about the future of negotiation, strategic decision-making and the role of AI in global governance.\nAt the core of these developments lies a deeper question: Can AI truly engage in diplomacy, or is it merely simulating human-like negotiation? The Turing Test, a foundational benchmark for artificial intelligence, provides an essential framework for evaluating AI’s communicative and strategic capabilities. As AI becomes more sophisticated in language processing, trust-building and strategic reasoning, the implications for diplomacy, conflict resolution and international negotiations become increasingly profound.\nMeta’s CICERO represents a significant departure from traditional AI applications, which have historically excelled in structured environments such as chess or GO but struggled in open-ended, multiagent interactions. Unlike these deterministic settings, diplomacy requires persuasion, alliance formation, and deception management, which make human negotiations both unpredictable and strategic.\nIn a controlled study of 42-hour games involving 82 human participants, CICERO demonstrated remarkable performance by scoring more than twice the average of human players and ranking among the top 10% of participants who played multiple games. What sets CICERO apart is not just its computational efficiency but its ability to engage in dynamic negotiations, build alliances and anticipate the long-term consequences of its diplomatic actions.\nThe significance of CICERO extends beyond gaming. It provides a proof of concept for AI-driven diplomacy, where AI could assist in strategic forecasting by predicting alliance stability and geopolitical shifts. It could also support multilateral negotiations by analyzing historical treaties and suggesting optimal diplomatic strategies. Furthermore, CICERO could be instrumental in conflict mediation by identifying common ground between adversaries and simulating potential agreements.\nHowever, the integration of AI into diplomatic processes raises fundamental concerns. While AI can model negotiation strategies and predict likely outcomes, its ability to truly understand the complexities of international relations remains questionable. The key issue is whether AI is merely mimicking diplomatic behavior based on existing patterns or developing independent strategic reasoning that could contribute meaningfully to global diplomacy.\nWhile CICERO operates in a multiagent, long-term strategic environment, Hagglebots represent another frontier of AI in negotiation. These AI systems are designed for bargaining, trade deals and economic negotiations. They rely on game theory, reinforcement learning and natural language processing to optimize agreements in bilateral or multilateral settings.\nUnlike CICERO, which excels in high-level strategic alliance-building, Hagglebots focus on economic trade-offs, pricing strategies and contract formulation. Their relevance to diplomacy lies in their ability to automate trade negotiations, potentially expediting international economic agreements. Additionally, they can analyze market conditions and predict how economic factors influence diplomatic relations. In the context of global policymaking, Hagglebots could assist in sanction policies and trade conflicts by modeling economic retaliation strategies.\nDespite their distinct applications, both CICERO and Hagglebots share a common technological foundation. They rely on reinforcement learning to optimize long-term strategies, use natural language processing to engage in human-like dialogue, and employ trust and reputation modeling to predict how negotiation partners will respond to different diplomatic tactics. These AI models highlight the increasing convergence of AI, diplomacy and economics, suggesting that autonomous systems may soon play a pivotal role in international trade, treaty negotiations and global economic policymaking.\nThe question of whether AI can replace human diplomats ties back to a long-standing measure of artificial intelligence: the Turing Test. Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, the test assesses whether an AI system can engage in a conversation that is indistinguishable from that of a human. While CICERO and Hagglebots demonstrate advanced linguistic and strategic capabilities, they do not yet exhibit true understanding, consciousness or independent judgment.\nOne of the main limitations of AI-driven diplomacy is that it often prioritizes deception over intelligence. An AI can pass the Turing Test by mimicking human negotiation tactics, but this does not equate to genuine diplomatic reasoning. Moreover, ethical and accountability concerns arise when AI systems are integrated into decision-making processes. Unlike human diplomats, AI lacks moral responsibility and legal accountability in negotiation outcomes. Another challenge lies in bias and interpretability. AI systems are trained on historical data, meaning they may inherit biases from past diplomatic failures or conflicts. This raises concerns about whether AI-generated diplomatic strategies will perpetuate historical injustices or create unintended geopolitical tensions.\nWhile large language models such as GPT-4 and CICERO can convincingly simulate diplomacy, they remain constrained by pattern recognition rather than authentic strategic reasoning. The real test for AI in diplomacy will not be its ability to deceive human negotiators but its potential to offer new, creative diplomatic solutions that humans might overlook.\nThe emergence of CICERO and Hagglebots marks a paradigm shift in AI’s role in international relations. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into strategic decision-making, negotiation analysis and diplomatic forecasting, it will reshape the way states engage in diplomacy. However, the application of AI in global governance must be approached with caution.\nPolicymakers and international organizations must consider how AI-driven negotiations should be regulated to prevent unintended escalation in diplomatic conflicts. Additionally, human oversight must remain central in AI-assisted diplomatic decisions, ensuring that AI recommendations align with broader geopolitical and ethical considerations. The ethical implications of AI in international relations, particularly concerning accountability and transparency, must also be addressed to prevent AI from being exploited for strategic manipulation or coercion.\nWhile CICERO’s success in alliance-building and Hagglebots’ precision in economic negotiations demonstrate AI’s growing capabilities, human diplomats will remain essential. The art of diplomacy is not solely about winning negotiations; it is about preserving peace, managing conflicts and fostering long-term international cooperation.\nAs we enter an era where AI becomes a diplomatic tool rather than a mere analytical instrument, the international community must ensure that technological advancements align with global stability, ethical governance and human values. The true test of AI in diplomacy will not be whether it can pass the Turing Test, but whether it can contribute to a more cooperative, stable and just international order.",

Ventura isn't the only place experiencing tumultuous coasts. The National Weather Service has issued surf and flooding advisories along the California coast and in Hawaii. A video from Ventura officials opens on a seemingly tranquil scene. People are scattered along the seawall, leaning against it and watching the rolling waves in the distance. Suddenly, people start to back away from the wall moments before a wave spikes up in front of them. As it crashes down into the street, many of the people running get their feet knocked out from under them and a truck seems to skip forward in the waves. Another angle captured by [Facebook user Colin Hoag shows the waves chasing him](https://www.facebook.com/1 103854833/videos/339998562146021/) down the street.

    "text": "Primeira sessão da recém-eleita câmara regional do estado alemão teve que ser suspensa após confusão envolvendo a AfD e os outros partidos.A primeira sessão do recém-eleito Parlamento regional do estado da Turíngia, no leste da Alemanha, teve que ser interrompida nesta quinta-feira (26/09), devendo ser retomada no sábado após confusão envolvendo a legenda de ultradireita Alternativa para a Alemanha (AfD) e os outros partidos da câmara regional. Foi a primeira reunião parlamentar após as eleições de 1º de setembro, em que a AfD obteve ganhos históricos, conquistando mais de um terço dos assentos e terminando em um claro primeiro lugar. Por ter sido a legenda com mais votos nas eleições, a AfD tinha o direito de apresentar um candidato à presidência do Parlamento regional da Turíngia. No entanto, os outros partidos anunciaram que não votariam em nenhum candidato da sigla, endossando assim o cordão sanitário em torno do grupo. Os conservadores da União Democrata Cristã (CDU) e os populistas da Aliança Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) queriam apresentar uma proposta de alteração das regras de procedimento para permitir que os outros partidos apresentassem candidatos em uma primeira votação. De acordo com as atuais regras de procedimento, eles teriam que esperar até que o candidato da AfD não obtivesse a maioria nas duas primeiras votações. Jürgen Treutler, membro da AfD, foi indicado para presidir a sessão devido à sua idade e impediu que a proposta fosse colocada em votação. Treutler argumentou que as regras de procedimento do Parlamento só poderiam ser alteradas após a eleição de um presidente. Sessão foi interropida seis vezes A disputa fez com que a sessão fosse interrompida até seis vezes e, no final, o gerente parlamentar da bancada da CDU, Andreas Bühl, anunciou que levaria o caso ao Tribunal Constitucional da Turíngia, alegando que Treutler havia violado os direitos dos deputados com seu comportamento. Durante a sessão, houve discussões acaloradas entre Treutler e Bühl, que chegou a acusar o deputado da AfD de perpetrar uma \"machtergreifung\", expressão frequentemente usada para definir a tomada do poder pelos nazistas em 1933. A AfD obteve 32,8% dos votos nas eleições de 1º de setembro, o que lhe deu 32 das 88 cadeiras, e apresentou como candidata a presidente do parlamento Wiebke Muhsal, que foi condenada a pagar uma multa em um caso de fraude na última legislatura. A CDU, com 23 cadeiras, é o segundo maior partido no Parlamento da Turíngia e pretende apresentar Thadäus König, um parlamentar que tem o apoio de outros partidos além do AfD. A Turíngia é o primeiro estado federal alemão em que o AfD se tornou a principal força parlamentar. A CDU quer eleger seu líder regional Mario Voigt como governador. Para isso, está considerando a formação de uma coalizão tripartite incluindo o BSW e o Partido Social-Democrata (SPD). Essa aliança, no entanto, teria apenas 44 assentos, o que também exigiria o apoio dos socialistas do A Esquerda. md (EFE, DPA)",

    "text": "Amitabh shares Helen's heroic escape from Japanese invasion in World War 2 Later on, Helen got her major break at the age of 19 in 1958, when she performed on the song 'Mera Naam Chin Chin Chu' in the movie ‘Howrah Bridge’. NEW DELHI: Megastar Amitabh Bachchan shared an anecdote about the veteran actress Helen, and talked about how she had escaped from the Japanese occupation of Burma in 1943, during the World War 2, and came to India. Helen is a well known dancer and is known for her character roles. Born in Rangoon, Burma (now known as Myanmar), Helen’s family trekked to Dibrugarh, Assam in 1943 in order to escape from the Japanese occupation of Burma. Later on, Helen got her major break at the age of 19 in 1958, when she performed on the song 'Mera Naam Chin Chin Chu' in the movie ‘Howrah Bridge’. With legendary actor Shammi Kapoor, she did many hit dance numbers like 'Suku Suku' in 'Junglee', 'Yamma Yamma' in 'China Town', and 'O Haseena Zulfonwali' in 'Teesri Manzil'. Amitabh, who is currently hosting the quiz based reality show ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati 15’ welcomed the roll over contestant Lalit Kumar to the hot seat. For Rs 25 lakh, he was asked: “Which of these actresses was born in Myanmar and later escaped with her family to India during the Second World War?” The options given were -- Sulochana, Suraiya, Nadira, and Helen. The correct answer was Helen. However, Lalit was not sure about the answer, hence he decided to quit the show, and took the price money of Rs 12,50,000. Amitabh then went on to say, “Helen and her family escaped Myanmar...called Burma back then. In order to escape and come to India, they had to trek alternately through miles of wilderness passing through rivers, mountains and forests. In order to escape from the Japanese occupation of Burma, she had to do this in 1943.” “She became a popular actress in our film industry. Watching her dance would leave one enthralled,” shared the ‘Brahmastra’ actor. Helen has shared screen with Big B in the movies like ‘Mohabbatein’, ‘Don’, ‘Sholay’, ‘Amar Akbar Anthony’, ‘The Great Gambler’ and ‘Ram Balram’. In the movie ‘Sholay’, she had a special appearance in the track ‘Mehbooba Mehbooba’. Talking about the same, Amitabh added: “I had the good fortune of working with her in a few films. She's a kind and compassionate woman. She used to look after everyone. We pray she stays in good health. She's old now.”",

    "title": "'Not just a game': The dark implications of AI outsmarting humans",
    "text": "One might tend to chuckle at the news that a ‘chess Olympiad’ was recently held, not between human players, but Artificial Intelligence (AI) entities. Yet, the developments in the sphere of automatons, which are becoming as smart as human beings if not yet smarter, are no laughing matter, posing as they do risks for human civilisation.\nIt has now become a standard practice for technology companies to use chess to assess the progress and abilities of a computer. Already, modern chess machines are proving to be unbeatable against even the top human players. However, the latest competition did not involve computers designed especially for chess games, but between AI programs designed for everyday use.\nNo less than eight models from Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, xAI, as well as Chinese developers DeepSeek and Moonshot AI, battled against each other during the three-day tournament. The ‘champion’ turned out to be OpenAI’s o3 model, which defeated xAI’s model Grok 4 in the final. Google’s model Gemini claimed third place in the tournament, after beating a different OpenAI model.\nThe AI chess tournament took place on Google-owned platform Kaggle, which allows data scientists to evaluate their systems through competitions. While Sam Altman’s OpenAI model claimed the top spot, Grok’s developer Elon Musk shrugged off the defeat as not disproving his AI model was the smartest!\nSlowly, but surely, humanity is waking up to the imminent dangers posed by AI, which, apart from facilitating violation of privacy, is capable of interfering with the global democracy scenario through spread of misinformation, or causing market volatility, automation-spurred job losses, as also cataclysmic abilities to induce weapons automatisation! The biggest concern is the possibility of ‘thinking’ machines being actually developed in real life, and the threat of humankind being outsmarted by machines. In this context, it may be recalled that around a year back, Musk had attacked third-place winner Google’s AI model Gemini by claiming that it was sexist, thereby pointing to alleged biases within that AI system.\nMusk’s charge has serious implications, considering that Gemini plays a crucial role in various Google products, including YouTube. Indeed, if Gemini’s narrative is controlled by a particular ideological perspective, it could lead to a distortion of truth and the censorship of diverse perspectives! Because the tech giant Google is a key player in the communication world and wields a significant influence in shaping public perceptions, the potential consequences of its using biased AI can well be imagined!\nThe Gemini example illustrates the reality that it is no longer merely a question of job losses or stolen identities, for AI has the ability to empower giant tech corporations in an unimaginably devastating way, and enable them to control societal thinking and way of life.",
