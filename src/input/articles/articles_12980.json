    "text": "Rav Frand| Level: Intermediate\nThese divrei Torah were adapted from the hashkafa portion of Rabbi Yissocher Frand’s Commuter Chavrusah Series on the weekly portion: ##1319 – Honoring Your Parents Wishes After Their Death: How Far Must You Go? Good Shabbos!\nOn his deathbed, Yaakov gives brachos to his children. He begins with his firstborn son and tells him: “Reuven, you are my firstborn… Yeser s’ais v’yeser az (greater by raising and greater by might).” (Bereshis 49:3).\nWhat do the words “yeser s’ais v’yeser oz” mean? Rashi interprets, “You were potentially fit to be greater than your brothers by having the kehunah, as indicated by the word s’ais which is related to the expression “nesias kapayim” (“lifting of the palms,” which takes place during Birkas Kohanim). Rashi also interprets the expression “v’yeser oz” as implying that Reuven should have also had the leadership role in Klal Yisrael – malchus (monarchy). Rashi infers this from the similar expression “v’yiten oz l’malko” (Shmuel I 2:10).\nWhat caused Reuven to lose this greatness, for which he had been destined? Yaakov continues his blessing to Reuven in the next pasuk: “Pachaz k’mayim al tosar olisa mishkivay ovicha” (Haste like water – do not take more, because you mounted your father’s bed…) (Bereshis 49:4). Rashi interprets “Pachaz k’mayim” – your impetuousness, which caused you to react impulsively when you felt your mother was slighted (in the incident in which Reuven shifted Yaakov’s bed from the tent of Rochel’s handmaiden to the tent of his mother, Leah, following the death of Rochel). The impulsiveness you demonstrated on that occasion disqualified you from being the king. Rashi says the expression “pachaz k’mayim” connotes fast flowing water that is in an apparent hurry to get to its destination. “You are like a quick flowing stream – too quick, too trigger-happy. Therefore, you are ineligible to receive all these extra benefits (kehuna and malchus), which you were destined to receive.”\nOn the other hand, by the bracha of Yehuda – who does receive the monarchy – the pasuk says: “A lion cub is Yehudah; from prey my son, you ascended (m’teref b’nee alisa)” What does that mean? Rashi interprets: You, Yehuda, were part of the conspiracy to kill Yosef. You were the one who came up with the supposed story that Yosef was killed by a wild animal. You were part of all that. But what happened, Yehuda? You changed your mind. You withdrew and you said “What gain will there be if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? (Bereshis 37:26) You argued, let’s not kill him, but rather throw him into a pit. We can sell him to the Yishmaelim.\nAccording to Rashi, Yaakov further noted that this is not the only time Yehuda changed his mind and regretted an earlier statement. He also initially issued a decree that Tamar should be executed (when he suspected her of being unfaithful and having illicit relations outside her family). But upon seeing her evidence to the contrary, he said “She is more righteous than I.” (Bereshis 38:26)\nWhat is Rashi teaching?\nRabbi Buxban from Florida wanted to explain these Rashis as follows: There is one quality that disqualifies a person from being a king or a leader in Klal Yisrael – the quality of impetuousness and impulsiveness. Knee-jerk reactions are unacceptable for a Jewish leader. A leader needs to be able to think things through, and rethink things if necessary. Before carrying out a decision, a king must ask himself “Is this the right way to go?”\nReuven did not rethink his steps. He was offended. He stood up for his mother’s honor – all well and good. But he didn’t say “Hey, wait a minute! Let me think this thing through. What am I doing to my father? I am insulting him.” Because of that quality, Reuven could not be the melech.\nYehudah, on the other hand, also made mistakes. His initial reaction was “Let’s kill Yosef. Let’s kill Tamar.” But then he thought about the matter and said “mah betza” (What is to be gained by this)? He changed his mind and retracted his position. He said, “Maybe I was not right.” That is an attribute needed to be a melech Yisrael.\n“Shoot from the hip and ask questions later” is not the quality we want in a Jewish leader. And if a person cannot say the words “I was wrong. I made a mistake” he cannot be the melech.\nReuven ultimately did teshuva. In fact, the Medrash (Bereshis Rabbah 98) says that when Yaakov Avinu explains that Reuven did teshuva, he expresses it as follows: “You have made yourself a mikvah of water and have purified yourself within it.”\nThose who know a little about the laws of tahara (ritual purification) know that there are two kinds of bodies of water that can provide tahara to a person. The first is called a “mikvah” which is an accumulation of rainwater. It must be completely still water, so still that if there is any leakage, it is not a mikvah anymore. It is called zochalim (flowing waters), which invalidate a mikvah. The other type of medium of purification is a “ma’ayan,” which is a fast-flowing stream. If a person immerses in the Mississippi River, he has achieved the highest form of tahara. A “ma’ayan” even purifies a Zav (a form of impurity which cannot achieve tahara by immersion in a standard “mikvah“).\nYaakov emphasizes that the way Reuven repented was by immersion in a mikvah. As opposed to “pachaz k’mayim…” (as impetuous as a fast-flowing stream), which was the quality of Reuven that previously caused him to offend his father. Now he immersed in a stationary mikvah. The choice of that mode of tahara is symbolic. Reuven said to himself, “No. Don’t rush. Sometimes we need still waters, like the waters of a mikvah, rather than the fast-flowing waters of a ma’ayan.”\nHow the Doctor from Minnesota Won His Friday Night Bet With the Yerushalmi Yid\nThere is a custom throughout the Jewish world to bless our children on Friday nights. (Some people do this every Friday, and some people do it specifically on Erev Yom Kippur.) We bless our sons with the famous blessing (from this week’s parsha) “May Elokim make you like Ephraim and Menashe.” (Bereshis 48:20) and we bless our daughters with the blessing “May Elokim make you like Sora, Rivka, Rochel, and Leah.”\nOver the years, we have said numerous peshatim on the meaning of the bracha “May Elokim make you like Ephraim and Menashe.” Tonight, I would like to say over the following story which I heard recently:\nThere was a medical conference in Yerushalayim that brought together experts from all over the world on the topic of epilepsy. A doctor from Minnesota, who was a world-renowned expert in this field, came to the conference. He met there a Yerushalmi looking Jew who was participating in these meetings.\nThis was not the type of person who looked like a doctor (although today it is not always easy to tell). The doctor asked him, “Nu, is your medical expertise in the field of epilepsy?” The Yerushalmi said, “No. I am not a doctor at all, but I have a child who has epilepsy. Many times, I have travelled all over the world to conferences on this condition to hear what is new in the field. I want to know if there are any new medications or new treatments. Now there is an epilepsy conference in Yerushalayim, so certainly I came.”\nThe Yerushalmi then invited the doctor, the epilepsy expert, to his home for Shabbos dinner the Friday night after the conference concluded. The doctor accepted the invitation.\nAs the guest entered the house, the host told him (in private), “I have five daughters. One of them has epilepsy. I bet you won’t be able to tell which of the five has epilepsy. Her epilepsy is for the most part under control, and my daughter is perfectly normal. She is not self-conscious about her condition. I bet you won’t be able to tell which daughter has epilepsy.”\nThe doctor responded, “Listen, I am a world class expert in epilepsy. I will be able to tell which daughter it is.” The host asked, “Would you like to bet on that?” The doctor said he did! (I don’t know what exactly they bet, but that is not important to the story.)\nThroughout the entire meal, everything was fine. There were no outward manifestations of her illness at all. After the meal, the host (privately) asked the doctor, “So tell me: Which is the one that has epilepsy?”\nThe doctor said (not in front of the daughters) “It is that one!” The host was astonished. He said “You are right! How did you possibly figure that out? She behaves exactly the same as all of her sisters! How did you know?”\nThe doctor explained: “Do you know how I knew? It was because when you benched your daughters before the meal, I saw that your heart rate increased when you benched her.”\nWhen we sit at our Shabbos tables Friday night and we bench our children, in our minds we think “What do I want from this child? What do I want this child to be? What do I want this child to become?” As much as this father knew his daughter’s illness was under control, still, her condition affected his heart strings. It affected his heart rate. That is how the doctor knew.\nThe moment when we bless our children Friday night is really special. We have a unique ability to connect with each child, and then give each a bracha asking that they become like Ephraim and Menashe or like Sora, Rivka, Rochel and Leah. This is a most emotional moment. Perhaps the outer manifestations of these emotions are not visible to the average person. Perhaps this is not even something we are ourselves aware of — but these subconscious expressions of bracha come from the deepest place in our heart.\nTranscribed by David Twersky; Yerushalayim\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\nEdited by Dovid Hoffman; Baltimore, MD\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#65010d0a030308040b25110a17040d4b0a1702)\nThis week’s write-up is adapted from the hashkafa portion of Rabbi Yissochar Frand’s Commuter Chavrusah Series on the weekly Torah portion.

Vendredi, elles ont plongé de 5,53% à 63,94 euros, atteignant un nouveau plus bas depuis l'été 2020.\nEn 2024, les actions du groupe chimique bavarois faisaient déjà partie des plus gros perdants de l'indice des valeurs moyennes, le MDax, avec une chute de près de 39 pour cent. En 2025, la situation n'est pas meilleure, avec une baisse de près de 9% jusqu'à présent.\nL'analyste Andreas Heine de la société d'investissement Stifel a contribué à la mauvaise humeur des investisseurs en fin de semaine. L'expert estime certes qu'il y a encore de la marge pour atteindre son objectif de cours, qu'il a abaissé de 135 à 77 euros, et il n'a dégradé les titres \"que\" de \"acheter\" à \"conserver\", mais ses déclarations sceptiques sur l'activité silicium solaire semblent inquiéter les investisseurs.\nLe marché américain du photovoltaïque est le seul sur lequel Wacker Chemie peut encore vendre son polysilicium solaire de manière rentable, a déclaré Heine. Cependant, les États-Unis sont actuellement confrontés à une offre excédentaire de modules solaires et des capacités de production supplémentaires sont en cours de construction. Parallèlement, la demande ne devrait pas augmenter dans les années à venir. Il pourrait donc y avoir une surabondance structurelle de l'offre.\nCela pèserait également sur Wacker et entraînerait une nette sous-utilisation des capacités de production de silicium solaire de l'entreprise. Parallèlement, le marché du polysilicium semi-conducteur - celui des puces d'ordinateur - ne croît pas assez vite pour assurer la pleine utilisation des capacités de production existantes.",

    "title": "Cáncer de próstata: Descubre si estás en riesgo de padecer esta enfermedad",
    "text": "En noviembre, se conmemora el Mes Internacional de la Lucha contra el Cáncer de Próstata, un momento crucial para sensibilizar sobre una enfermedad que afecta a miles de hombres cada año. El cáncer de próstata es el tipo de cáncer más común entre la población masculina, con aproximadamente 9,000 nuevos casos diagnosticados anualmente en el país. Sin embargo, a pesar de su alta incidencia, muchos hombres siguen temiendo o postergando los chequeos urológicos, lo que contribuye a que, según datos del MINSA, el 60% de los pacientes diagnosticados lleguen en etapas avanzadas. La falta de síntomas en las primeras fases y el temor a someterse a un examen preventivo son algunos de los principales obstáculos en la lucha contra esta enfermedad. “El miedo al diagnóstico y la falta de conocimiento sobre la importancia de los chequeos periódicos dificultan la prevención. Es esencial que los hombres se concienticen de que los exámenes de descarte son la única forma de detectar la enfermedad a tiempo y reducir la tasa de mortalidad”, afirma el Dr. Iván Ugarte, director médico de la Clínica San Juan de Dios Lima. “Por ello, ofrecemos exámenes preventivos y consultas urológicas accesibles desde S/.50, para garantizar que toda la población pueda realizarse los descartes necesarios”. Factores de riesgo del cáncer de próstata - Edad: A partir de los 50 años, aumenta la probabilidad de padecer cáncer de próstata, por lo que la edad es un factor de riesgo clave. - Raza: Los hombres afrodescendientes tienen el doble de probabilidades de desarrollar esta enfermedad en comparación con otras razas. - Factor genético: Si un familiar cercano, como el padre, tiene cáncer de próstata, el riesgo aumenta hasta tres veces. Si varios hermanos lo padecen, el riesgo puede incrementarse de cinco a once veces. La prevención es clave para reducir el impacto de esta enfermedad. Por eso, los hombres deben superar sus temores y hacerse chequeos regularmente, pues un diagnóstico temprano puede salvar vidas.

    "title": "Captive Care For Leopard Geckos - Reptiles Magazine",
    "text": "Leopard geckos ( Eublepharis macularius ) are one of the most popular pet reptiles for many understandable reasons. Their beautiful colors, docile temperaments, and manageable care makes them a rewarding and hardy species to keep. Leopard geckos have many features that make them distinct and unique compared to other lizard species. Their popularity is unmatched in the realm of lizard keepers but their requirements are specific and should be carefully considered.\nDescription Leopard geckos are native to the arid and rocky regions of Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, and parts of India where they spend their lives as a crepuscular species. In the wild they live in burrows, rock crevices and other small spaces to avoid direct sunlight. They tend to be more active during the dawn and dusk hours when the light is low so they can hunt insects and small prey. Leopard geckos are primarily insectivores, which means they eat insects as their main source of food. Captive bred leopard geckos enjoy eating crickets, mealworms, waxworms, and roaches.\nLeopard geckos are one of the top two pet reptiles. Photo by Cathy Keifer/Shutterstock\nLeopard geckos are a relatively small species of lizard reaching maximum lengths of only about 10 inches including their tail. Males are slightly larger than females but this can vary depending on the individual animal. Since leopard geckos are smaller in size, they have many predators in the wild such as birds, mammals, and larger reptile species. Their defense mechanisms include tail dropping, camouflage, vocalizations and biting. Leopard geckos have unique, bumpy textured skin that enables them to hide and blend into their habitats. Leopard geckos have many teeth that they can use for defense but they are mostly used for holding prey items in place. Leopard gecko teeth are regenerative so they lose them often but they are replenished fairly quickly so they can efficiently hunt and survive. Leopard geckos are able to produce loud and unique vocalizations which can be used to hunt, communicate, or scare off predators that may be trying to eat them.\nLeopard Gecko Captive Care For many decades, leopard geckos have been kept successfully in captivity under the proper conditions. Like all captive reptiles, advancing the husbandry of the species is ongoing and each gecko is an individual. It is important to observe any captive animal daily to ensure the conditions are optimal. It is a best practice to modify conditions as needed.\nHabitat In the wild leopard geckos are typically solitary. In captivity, leopard geckos can be kept individually unless temporarily for breeding. Keep a juvenile gecko in a 30”x12”x12” glass reptile terrarium with a screen top or custom habitat. As your gecko grows, move your leopard gecko to a 36” x 18”x 18” terrarium with a screen top to ensure proper ventilation and temperature regulations. If you can go as large as 4’ x’2’x 2’ go for it. There are many variations that can be used and creativity/research is encouraged.\nLeopard gecko eating its shed. Photo by Landshark/Shutterstock\nIt is important to have the proper habitat conditions for captive leopard geckos so they remain healthy. Leopard geckos do best in a naturalistic habitat that makes them feel safe. Since they are from the arid regions, a captive set up should attempt to replicate the wild conditions. This may vary depending on the location(s) of keepers around the world.\nHeating and Lighting There should be adequate heating and lighting to ensure the health of captive leopard geckos. While leopard geckos are crepuscular, they are known to bask. Normal or wild-type leopard geckos will benefit from a UVB lamp placed strategically over a basking area. The UV basking index should be 0.4 and 1.4, which is Zone 1 under the Ferguson Zones, one of four groups or zones (Zone 1 through 4, with Zone 1 targeted at shade dwellers or crepuscular species and Zone 4 targeted at full sunlight baskers) that identify daily sun exposure for reptiles. Zone 1 is for crepuscular species such as leopard geckos. Leopard gecko morphs with lighter colorations such as albinos and patternless should be presented with a UV basking index of 0.5 to 0.7 percent. This is all dependent on your mesh or screen top as UVB doesn’t penetrate through glass. You can also Google search for Dr Frances Baines’ article “How much UVB does my reptile need? The UV-Tool, a guide to the selection of UV lighting for reptiles and amphibians in captivity.” Use the UV-Tool Baines provides in the article to ensure proper UVB based on your animal and its enclosure.\nA healthy leopard gecko will have a fat tail. Photo by Gina Cioli/I-5 Studio\nA low intensity visible light can be used to help align the circadian rhythm. This can be used as a cycle meant to replicate night and day. Reptile timers are especially helpful to use when setting these cycles on a schedule. Although leopard geckos can handle drastic temperature differences in the wild, consistency is a best practice in captivity typically between 75 to 92 degrees Fahrenheit (23.9 to 33.3 degrees Celsius).\nHeat Belly heat is an adequate source for leopard geckos in captivity. There are many commercial options available that include heat pads, heat tape, and heat wire. A thermostat should always be used alongside heat sources to remain safe and maintain ideal heating conditions. Leopard geckos should be provided a hot side, a cool side, and a moist side, in their captive habitats/enclosures. This is to replicate the natural conditions of their dry, wild environments. Leopard geckos should have a hot spot of around 88 to 92 degrees Fahrenheit (31 to 33 degrees Celsius) and a cooler side around 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius).\nHumidity Leopard geckos come from arid regions so their captive set ups should not be overly moist. This can lead to an array of health issues and illnesses in leopard geckos. Humidity should not exceed 50% in the habitat, year round. Humidity boxes with water-spritzed sphagnum moss can be used to provide this element in captivity. This helps leopard geckos shed their skin on a continual basis.\nLeopard gecko on sand in the wild. Photo by Shutterstock/pulushkin ivan\nDecor/Enrichment Leopard geckos can benefit from enriching decor in their habitats. Each habitat is unique and many commercial decor options are available. Some examples include faux branches, caves, rocks, and other structures used for hiding and climbing. It is important to provide hide options in the hot, cool, and moist areas of the captive enclosure. These hides can be commercially bought or custom made as long as they are safe for reptiles. While leopard geckos enjoy a stimulating environment, it is important to leave space and not over clutter the habitat.\nSubstrate For Leopard Geckos Many substrate options are commercially available for leopard geckos and preferences vary among keepers. Some options include slate tile, ceramic tile, coconut bark, and bioactive layered substrates. Some prefer to mix these options and add things like rocks to mimic the natural environment of leopard geckos. In the wild, leopard geckos burrow in loose soil and enjoy hiding between rocky crevices of the desert. Loose substrates should be avoided so that the risk of impaction is minimized.\nFeed your leopard gecko a variety of insects. Gut load the insects and dust them with calcium supplements. Photo by DWI YULIANTO/Shutterstock\nInsects That Leopard Geckos Eat Leopard geckos are insectivores that enjoy a variety diet of mealworms, waxworms, crickets, roaches, and more. There are many commercial food options available and live feeder insects as well. Both are often used by keepers to nourish their leopard gecko pets but each animal is individual. Young leopard geckos should be fed daily and adults can be fed every other day. Each leopard gecko is an individual so modification may be necessary when it comes to captive diet. Dust the feeder insects with a high quality calcium supplement for reptiles and reptile vitamins.\nMealworms are a popular insect for leopard geckos. IamJang/Shutterstock\nWater A clean water dish should always be accessible to leopard geckos. Many options are available but the dish should not be too deep. A shallow dish is preferred for sanitary and practical purposes.\nLeopard gecko lapping up water. Make sure the water in the leopard gecko’s bowl is fresh. Photo by Gaschwald/Shutterstock\nWaste Captive habitats should be monitored constantly with waste removed as needed. Spot cleaning may be necessary daily and deep cleans should be done before conditions become too messy. This includes cleaning any stains, replacing substrate, and cleaning or replacing enrichment structures. Leopard geckos are known to poop in the same spot, which makes cleanup easier. Some people will lay down a small piece of paper towel in that spot, which makes cleanup easier.\nLeopard Gecko Morphs Leopard geckos gained popularity in the 1990s because of their manageable care, beautiful pattern options, and calmer demeanors. Although only one species of leopard gecko is recognized, there are hundreds of morphs recognized within the species. Some examples include:\n• Normal/Wild Type: The natural coloration of leopard geckos, featuring a mix of brown, yellow, and white with spots or bands.\n• High Yellow: Enhanced yellow coloration with reduced black spotting.\n• Hypo: Reduced pigmentation, resulting in lighter colors and fewer spots.\n• Mack Snow: A recessive gene that lightens the background color and reduces pattern intensity.\n• Tremper Albino: The first commercially available albino morph, displaying red eyes and a pale background with yellow or orange markings.\n• Rainwater Albino: Similar to the Tremper Albino but with a slightly different appearance.\n• Eclipse: Characterized by an absence of pattern due to melanin reduction.\n• Enigma: Known for its unique pattern and sometimes neurological issues, although not all individuals have these issues.\n• Raptor: A combination of Tremper Albino, Eclipse, and Patternless traits.\n• Blizzard: Almost completely lacking in black pigmentation, resulting in a white or pale appearance.\n• Super Giant: A morph that grows much larger than the typical leopard gecko, often originating from Giant or Super Giant lines.\n• Jungle: Featuring bold striping and reduced spotting, resembling the patterns found on jungle reptiles.\n• White and Yellow: A striking morph with high contrast white and yellow colors.\n• Bell Albino: A line of albinos developed by Ron Tremper, known for their unique appearance.\n• Murphy Patternless: Lacks the typical spots and bands, resulting in a more uniform appearance.\nAll of these morphs, and so many more, are the result of selective breeding which mostly occurs by human customization. Wild mutations do occur. Leopard gecko morphs continue to diversify and expand with beautiful colors, patterns, and even textures. Leopard geckos seem to be abundantly successful when it comes to breeding which has taken the pressures off wild population collection. Due to the overly abundant success of the species, careful consideration is necessary before purchasing a leopard gecko from a breeder. It is important to support ethical, high quality, reputable breeders only. This sometimes means paying the higher price tag on an animal, but it is worth it. Research is encouraged when sourcing reptile pets.\nAn albino Tremper hatchling. Photo by Massimiliano Bodigoi.\nAs with most reptile species, the market for leopard geckos changes. Depending on the times, leopard gecko morphs can be bought and sold for thousands of dollars. It takes serious consideration and life dedication to commit to being a successful and ethical breeder.\nConclusion It is completely understandable why leopard geckos quickly rose to fame during the reptile industry boom. They carry their well-deserved place as they continue to be successfully kept under the proper conditions. It is important to remember that leopard geckos can live up to 20 years and longer in captivity and are a serious commitment to consider. Leopard geckos depend on their keepers to thrive and lots of factors go into keeping them successfully, including proper husbandry, maintenance, and even genetics.\nAlthough they are often described as a beginner species, leopard geckos require specifically tailored care to keep them healthy and thriving. With the proper conditions, leopard geckos shine as beautiful display animals that are hardy and rewarding to keep.",

    "title": "First Alert Weather: Sunshine and warmer temperatures this weekend",
    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. ( WBRC ) - Happy Saturday! We have another weekend full of fun events and several fall festivals across Central Alabama. The good news is that the weather will not be an issue for you. The big story in the short term is that temperatures will trend several degrees above average for afternoon highs. Significantly cooler air will return next week. Temperatures are a little chilly this morning with most of us starting out in the upper 40s and lower 50s. Temperatures are nearly three to five degrees cooler than at this time Friday morning. First Alert AccuTrack Satellite and Radar is showing us clear and dry. High pressure remains in place giving us plenty of sunshine this weekend. We are looking at temperatures climbing into the lower 80s this afternoon with a sunny sky. Winds today will likely come from the west at 5-10 mph. You’ll definitely want to grab the hat and sunglasses if you plan on being out today. I also recommend sunscreen if you plan on attending the Alabama football game at 11 a.m. CDT in Tuscaloosa. If you have any evening plans, we will remain clear and dry with temperatures cooling into the upper 60s and lower 70s by 7-8 p.m. CDT.\nFall Cooldown (wbrcnews) Very warm Sunday: We want to give you a first alert for very warm temperatures tomorrow afternoon! We will likely start tomorrow morning mostly clear with temperatures a little warmer than this morning in the mid 50s. We should end up sunny tomorrow afternoon with a few clouds possible to the north. Temperatures will likely trend 5-8 degrees above average with highs in the mid 80s. Upper 80s can’t be ruled out in far west Alabama. Winds will likely come from the southwest at 5-10 mph.\nOak Grove Fall Festival (wbrcnews) Next Big Thing: The big story next week is the arrival of a strong cold front Sunday night into Monday morning. This cold front will likely drop our temperatures below average for mid-October. Breezy conditions will be possible Sunday night into Monday as a cold front approaches the state. A stray shower can’t be ruled out early Monday morning, but I think the majority of us will remain dry. Temperatures will likely cool into the mid 70s Monday afternoon. It will end up even cooler Wednesday and Thursday with highs in the mid to upper 60s. You will likely need a coat or jacket on Wednesday and Thursday mornings with temperatures cooling into the lower 40s. It would not surprise me if we saw some upper 30s along and north of Hwy 278. Scattered frost will be a possibility for areas north of I-20. You may need to cover or bring any sensitive plants inside by the middle of next week. The upcoming week will remain dry and sunny. No sign of any rainfall over the next seven days.\nTropical Update (wbrcnews) Tropical Update: Tropical Storm Leslie continues to spin away in the Central Atlantic. Winds are at 50 mph as it rapidly pushes to the northeast at 20-25 mph. Leslie will not impact the United States. It will continue to push to the east-northeast and lose tropical characteristics over the next couple of days.\nWe are also watching a tropical wave in the far eastern Atlantic that is located a couple of hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands.
