    "title": "Transforming Wood Waste into Innovative Metal Alternatives",
    "text": "Research at the University of Tennessee is embarking on an ambitious journey that seeks to revolutionize the way we think about wood waste. The innovative project aims to transform scrap wood, often relegated to landfills, into a robust, metal-like alternative that could significantly reduce our reliance on traditional metals for structural applications. Led by Art Ragauskas, a prominent figure in biorefining and the acting department head of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, the project not only tackles waste management but also addresses sustainability concerns inherent in metal production.\nThe project, entitled “Waste Upcycling for Defense” (WUD), is noteworthy as it has secured a $2 million contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). This collaboration is a strategic move, as DARPA is renowned for pioneering advanced technologies with implications for national security. The University of Tennessee is not navigating this path alone; it is partnering with esteemed institutions such as the University of California, Riverside, and Georgia Tech, creating a robust network of research expertise aimed at tackling this monumental challenge.\nAt the heart of Ragauskas’s research lies the transformative potential of wood. Often dismissed as inferior when compared to steel and other alloys, wood possesses unique properties that can be harnessed with the right processing. By understanding the composition of wood, researchers have found that by removing lignin—the natural glue that binds wood cells together—wood can be rendered incredibly strong. The densification process, wherein wood is compressed after lignin removal, significantly enhances its strength and suitability as a material for a broader range of applications.\nDuring the densification process, the cell walls of wood remain intact but are transformed at a molecular level. The removal of lignin creates spaces within the wood that, when compressed, allow the cellulose fibers to bond more effectively. Yunxuan Wang, a post-doctoral researcher on the team, explains that this results in an ultra-strong product that can rival the mechanical properties of metals. This transformation of waste wood into a high-performance material is groundbreaking, especially in a world where resource efficiency and environmental sustainability are becoming increasingly critical.\nHowever, the project faces challenges, particularly when dealing with mixed waste wood materials, such as those derived from construction sites, furniture manufacturing, and landscaping. The diverse nature of these biosources can complicate the production process. Wang points out the difficulty of sourcing large, uniform chunks of wood; instead, much of what is available is often imperfect and fragmented, comprising sawdust and other byproducts. Therefore, the goal of the project is to maximize the utility of these lesser-quality materials, transforming them into high-strength densified boards without sacrificing performance.\nThe environmental implications of this research are significant. With an increasing awareness of the energy-intensive processes involved in metal production, there is an urgent need for alternative materials that minimize ecological footprints. The potential for strong wood composites to be utilized in various sectors, including automotive, aerospace, and construction, underlines the importance of this study. Historically, densified wood has found applications in high-stakes arenas, such as military aircraft during World War II, suggesting a rich legacy that could be revived in contemporary contexts.\nAs Ragauskas emphasizes, “The conversion of waste wood to a high-performance board provides a unique opportunity to turn ‘trash to cash.’” This approach has the potential to minimize landfill use while also addressing the logistical challenges associated with material sourcing for construction and manufacturing, especially in remote areas where traditional supply chains may falter.\nThe research aligns perfectly with global initiatives aimed at promoting sustainability and reducing material waste across industries. As the demand for sustainable building materials increases, findings from the University of Tennessee project could pave the way for new standards in material science. The application of high-strength wood composites could redefine traditional manufacturing paradigms, prompting industries to reconsider their material choices.\nDespite the promising prospects, the journey ahead is fraught with uncertainties. Mistakes in processing or changes in material sourcing could derail efforts, but the collective expertise of the research team and their partnerships positions them well to navigate these obstacles. The collaboration not only provides a wealth of knowledge but also enhances the complexity of the research, allowing for a multidimensional approach to solving the problems associated with wood waste.\nFurthermore, the projects’ implications extend beyond mere technical advancements; they also resonate deeply within the socio-economic context. The bridging of the gap between waste generation and high-performance material production aligns with global sustainability goals, providing economic opportunities while also addressing environmental concerns. Such innovations could lead to new industries centered around waste upcycling, thus generating jobs in regions where unemployment has been a persistent issue.\nAs we look ahead to a future where resource scarcity and environmental awareness shape our material choices, the University of Tennessee’s WUD project could serve as a beacon of hope. Transforming what was once considered waste into valuable material underscores a necessary paradigm shift in how we approach material science and environmental conservation. This pioneering research not only speaks to the technical advancements in wood processing but also highlights an ethic of stewardship toward the planet.\nIn summary, the project at the University of Tennessee promises groundbreaking advancements in turning wood waste into a viable metal alternative, with implications for various industries and the environment. As researchers delve deeper into the intricacies of wood densification and alternative applications, the hope is that this transformative approach will inspire similar initiatives worldwide.\nSubject of Research : Conversion of wood waste into a high-performance metal alternative\nArticle Title : University of Tennessee Explores Transformative Wood Waste Research\nNews Publication Date : October 2023\nWeb References :\nReferences :\nImage Credits : University of Tennessee\nKeywords",

    "text": "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs illegally appointed ‘de facto’ agency directors, judge rules Jun 6, 2024, 11:56 AM | Updated: 11:57 am (File Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images) PHOENIX – An Arizona judge ruled Wednesday that Gov. Katie Hobbs illegally appointed “de facto” agency directors while sidestepping opposition to her nominees by state Senate Republicans. Hobbs didn’t have the authority to install “deputy directors” to lead 13 state agencies after multiple picks were rejected by the Senate Committee on Director Nominations following often-contentious hearings, [according to the ruling](https://www.scribd.com/document/739949622/Under-Advisement-Ruling-Arizona-State-Senate-v-Katie-Hobbs). Senate President Warren Petersen created the vetting committee about a month after Arizona’s first Democratic governor since 2009 took office in early 2023. As a result, Hobbs’ director nominees couldn’t go to the full Senate for a confirmation vote without approval from the committee, which is chaired by Sen. Jake Hoffman. [Under state law](https://www.azleg.gov/ars/38/00211.htm), the governor’s nominees can’t serve as director for more than a year without Senate confirmation. How did Gov. Hobbs bypass Senate confirmation for nominees? In September 2023, a frustrated Hobbs [said she was withdrawing](https://ktar.com/story/5541341/arizona-gov-katie-hobbs-pulls-remaining-director-nominations-cites-partisan-obstructionism/) her nominees from the 13 remaining director vacancies to “pursue other lawful avenues” for filling the leadership roles in the following departments, commissions and offices: - Administration - Economic Security - Environmental Quality - AHCCCS Administration - Child Safety - Gaming - Housing - Insurance and Financial Institutions - Veterans’ Services - State Land - State Lottery Commission - Residential Utility Consumer Office - Office of Tourism Hobbs went on to name an interim director to each agency. The interim then appointed an executive deputy director and resigned, leaving the deputy in charge. However, the GOP-led Senate [filed a lawsuit](https://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/docket/CivilCourtCases/caseInfo.asp?caseNumber=CV2023-019899) in December 2023 challenging the maneuver. Why did judge rule that Gov. Hobbs illegally appointed directors? On Wednesday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Scott Blaney ruled in favor of the Senate, saying Hobbs “has improperly, unilaterally appointed ‘de facto’ directors for these 13 agencies, despite the actual job title she has assigned to them.” Blaney also wrote that Hobbs’ “frustration with a co-equal branch of government – even if that frustration was justified – did not exempt her director nominees from Senate oversite.” Blaney didn’t issue relief to the Senate in Wednesday’s ruling, instead giving the parties a chance to settle their dispute. The judge said the court will set an evidentiary hearing or oral argument for late July or early August. “This will give these co-equal branches of government an opportunity to meet and confer in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable resolution,” the ruling says. “If they are unsuccessful, the Court will hold a brief hearing to consider the evidence and arguments regarding mandamus and injunctive relief.” How did Hobbs, Senate Republicans react to ruling Hobbs’ office issued a statement vowing to appeal the decision. The statement took aim at Hoffman, who is under indictment in Arizona’s fake elector case. “Arizonans want sanity, not the chaos of indicted fake elector Jake Hoffman’s sham committee that he abuses to force his radical political agenda on Arizonans,” the statement said. “Gov. Hobbs stands ready to work with anybody in the Senate who is serious about putting the political games aside and delivering for everyday Arizonans, and as she’s said from day one, she remains open to a fair and timely process for confirmation of nominees.” Senate Republicans, meanwhile, used Wednesday’s ruling to accuse Hobbs and her party of abusing their power. 🚨FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Court Rules Katie Hobbs Violated State Law by Failing to Nominate Directors for Senate Confirmation Full Statement: [https://t.co/LxPcX2138z] [pic.twitter.com/1TnrlZMEj4] — AZSenateRepublicans (@AZSenateGOP) [June 5, 2024] “This case is a prime example of Democrats weaponizing Arizona’s government for their own political gain and to implement their radical left agenda,” Petersen, the Senate president, [said in a press release](https://www.azsenaterepublicans.gov/post/court-rules-katie-hobbs-violated-state-law-by-failing-to-nominate-directors-for-senate-confirmation). “Unfortunately, every decision made by these fake directors on behalf of our state agencies will be under a microscope, opening the door for a myriad of lawsuits.” For his part, Hoffman said he’s ready to resume confirmation hearings. “I look forward to continuing our confirmation hearings in the near future now that much needed clarity on the law has been provided by the courts to Hobbs and her staff,” Hoffman [said in a release](https://www.azsenaterepublicans.gov/post/senator-jake-hoffman-responds-to-court-ruling-on-katie-hobbs-unlawful-scheme-to-circumvent-senate-c). “If Katie wishes to continue her petulant insults against me and to play petty political games, so be it; but I’m going to continue faithfully fulfilling my duty to the people of this great state to ensure that we have a sane government that works for every Arizonan.” We want to hear from you.

    "title": "Superyacht becomes world's first to be powered by patented hydrogen fuel cell system — here's what sets electric luxury apart",
    "text": "Guests at an exclusive event in Monaco in May were treated to a glimpse of the superyacht 50Steel, a first-of-its-kind luxury vessel powered by a patented green methanol fuel cell system.\nAs Designboom detailed , Italian architect, art director, and designer Piero Lissoni designed the superyacht's interiors. Lissoni described how the \"creative\" horizontal mechanical systems open up space for a living area that would usually be taken up by vertical components.\nYachtmaker Sanlorenzo has dubbed this revolutionary system HER, which stands for Hidden Engine Room, according to a press release .\nDesignboom notes this concept also created room for a barrier-free beach club larger than 1,400 square feet, as well as a spa and gym, on a level that would otherwise be occupied by machinery. Five staggered decks designed by Zuccon International Project Studio add to the feeling of openness on the vessel, as do Lissoni's coffered ceilings.\nMeanwhile, the 50Steel's modular Reformer Fuel Cell system, developed in partnership with Siemens Energy, operates by turning green methanol (produced using nonpolluting, renewable energy) into hydrogen, according to the yachtmaker's release , which says it can do all this with the diesel engines fully turned off and keeping the power carbon-neutral. If accurate, this would allow the ship to generate up to 100 kilowatts of clean energy, which can power its hotel systems.\nIt also significantly reduces the amount of backup diesel required for the yacht to function when at anchor, with Sanlorenzo explaining it can cover around 90% of typical usage time. According to Designboom , the vessel has four guest cabins and one primary space for the owner.\nWatch now: Would you wear a shirt made out of oysters? While this is an exciting development, the superyacht industry has received significant criticism for its outsi z ed generation of pollution and harmful environmental impact, from operations to construction.\nAs Bloomberg notes , analysis from Oxfam reveals that a person in the bottom 99% of the population would need 1,500 years to produce as much carbon as one of the top billionaires, and superyachts are the biggest offenders.\nThe top 300 superyachts alone generate more pollution than the island nation of Tonga , according to data from lifestyle social scientist Gregory Salle, cited by Bloomberg.\nHowever, there have been efforts to make superyachts greener, including incorporating recycled materials into electric vessels, developing solar skins to convert sunlight into energy, and moving toward alternative fuels like hydrogen. Sanlorenzo's latest project is yet another step in the right direction .\n\"With the launch of the 50Steel, Sanlorenzo celebrates a fundamental milestone in its history…\" Chairman and CEO Cav. Massimo Perotti said in the Sanlorenzo release. \"I believe what sets us apart is the ability to drive industry innovation, embracing cutting-edge solutions not only in design, always elegant and comfortable, but also in the field of technology and sustainability, to achieve the ambitious goals of reducing our environmental footprint.\"\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future , and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "text": "Local View: Documentary film shines light on ‘moral injuries’ suffered by veterans\nFree screenings, with discussions, scheduled in Duluth Sept. 25-26\nI served in the U.S. Army as a scout sniper during a combat tour in Baqubah, Iraq, in 2004. Before that I was deployed to Kosovo on a nine-month peacekeeping mission. My father is a Vietnam War veteran, and my two grandfathers fought in World War II.\nI want you to know about moral injury. It’s a profound psychological and emotional wound that many veterans carry from their wartime experiences. Unlike post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, which often is characterized by anxiety and hyper-vigilance, moral injury stems from deep-seated conflict between one's actions and one's personal moral beliefs.\nI appear in the recently released documentary film, \"What I Want You to Know,\" which was produced by combat veterans Tommy Furlong and Travis Weiner and directed by Catie Foertsch. This powerful film features the personal narratives of soldiers and Marines who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan where they faced moral dilemmas and ethical conflicts.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBut the film does more than recount individual wartime experiences. It provides an unfiltered look at how veterans wrestle with the guilt, shame, and self-reproach that are symptoms of moral injury. It also explores how our nation's justification for its wars can be just as damaging to the mental health of members of the Armed Forces as the terrible events that happen during war and as their own conduct in war.\nViewing the film can be both cathartic and validating for veterans grappling with moral injury. Seeing their experiences reflected in the stories of others can diminish feelings of isolation and self-blame, because the film fosters an understanding that they are not alone in their struggles. This shared connection can be a crucial first step toward healing, empowering veterans to seek appropriate help and to confront their own moral wounds within a supportive framework.\nThose who haven’t served in war may not fully grasp the toll of veteran moral injury. \"What I Want You to Know\" lays bare the full extent of what war does to those who do the actual fighting. This can increase awareness and understanding of the complexities of war experiences and encourage empathy and support for veterans.\nIt’s a fact that whenever a nation goes to war, the fighters on the ground are going to be profoundly affected, not just by physical injuries and PTSD but also by moral injury. Our nation must ask itself if this price is worth paying before we send our young men and women to fight another unnecessary war, as in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nMy hope is that public screenings and discussions of \"What I Want You to Know,\" particularly those that include veterans, will stimulate meaningful conversations about these issues and about the need for tailored support systems for our veterans.\nThe film will be shown in Solon Campus Center 120 at the University of Minnesota Duluth on Wednesday, Sept. 25 at 6:30 p.m. and in the Mitchell Auditorium at the College of St. Scholastica on Thursday, Sept. 26 at 7 p.m. Both screenings are free and open to the public.\nI will be present at both screenings to discuss the film and answer audience questions. Please join me at one of these screenings so we may explore these important issues together.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArmy veteran Garett Reppenhagen operates an ice cream shop with his wife Therese in Rockport, Maine.

    "text": "An Excessive Heat Warning will be in effect Friday for Billings and areas to the east as record-breaking daytime highs will be possible with temperatures reaching the upper 90s to low 100s under lots of sunshine.The extreme heat stays put on Saturday with highs remaining in the upper 90s to low 100s. Record temperatures will be possible again. A disturbance zips through the area Saturday, bringing a slight chance of isolated showers and possibly a few thunderstorms. High pressure breaks down on Sunday, allowing moisture to stream back into the area. This will bring a wet pattern through next week with daily showers and thunderstorms possible.We'll also enjoy a cooling trend next week as daily temperatures will lessen each day with highs topping out in the upper 70s to low 80s by the middle of the week.Wildfire smoke will begin to stream back into the area Friday afternoon and could linger through the weekend. Air quality should be okay for most of the general population, but those who have a sensitivity to smoke should definitely take precautions if heading outdoors.-Miller RobsonQ2 Morning Meteorologistmiller.robson@ktvq.com",
