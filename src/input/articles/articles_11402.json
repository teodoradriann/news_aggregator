    "text": "I tennisti italiani Andrea Vavassori e Sara Errani hanno vinto il torneo di doppio misto agli US Open, uno dei quattro tornei del Grande Slam , i tornei più importanti del tennis. Era la prima volta che una coppia italiana raggiungeva una finale nel doppio misto in uno Slam, e di conseguenza quella di Vavassori ed Errani è anche la prima vittoria per una coppia di tennisti italiani in uno di questi tornei. In semifinale i due avevano battuto per 2 set a 0 (6-3, 7-5) gli statunitensi Tyra Grant e Aleksandar Kovacevic e nella finale di giovedì hanno battuto un’altra coppia statunitense, quella formata da Taylor Townsend e Donald Young, di nuovo per 2 set a 0 (7-6, 7-5).\nSara Errani ha 37 anni, Andrea Vavassori, 29, e tutti e due sono tra i migliori doppisti al mondo. In passato Errani aveva vinto tutti i tornei del Grande Slam nel doppio femminile, mentre quest’anno ha vinto la medaglia d’oro alle Olimpiadi di Parigi in coppia con Jasmine Paolini. Vavassori invece in questa stagione ha giocato due finali Slam nel doppio maschile con Simone Bolelli, gli Australian Open e il Roland Garros.\nIl doppio misto è una specialità meno praticata rispetto a quelli maschile e femminile: ad alti livelli si gioca solamente nei tornei del Grande Slam e alle Olimpiadi. Prima d’ora i tennisti italiani che avevano vinto uno Slam nel doppio misto erano stati Nicola Pietrangeli nel 1958 al Roland Garros e Raffaella Reggi nel 1986 agli US Open: entrambi però con compagni stranieri.\nTag: Andrea Vavassori - Sara Errani - tennis - us open",

    "text": "|Authors suggest complying with current European air pollution standards could reduce cataract surgery costs and improve population quality of life. Photo: Getty Images.|\nIt’s known that oxidative stress is a well-established factor underlying the development of cataract. In a recent study, French researchers sought to investigate the relationship between air pollution exposure and the incidence of cataract surgery in Europe; they found an almost 50% increase in the risk of cataract among individuals exposed to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels exceeding 40μg/m3. The team’s paper on the work was recently published in Acta Ophthalmologica.\nThe basis for the work was a population-based cohort of 829 residents of Bordeaux, France aged 65 years or more without cataract surgery prior to inclusion. They were recruited in 1999 and 2000 and followed every two to three years until 2017, with cataract surgery self-reported and checked at the slit-lamp. Average air pollution exposure (particulate matter ≤2.5μm), black carbon and nitrogen dioxide in the 10 years preceding baseline was estimated at the participants’ geocoded residential address.\nExposure to a 10-year average of NO2 concentrations above 40μg/m3 at baseline was associated with an approximately 50% increased risk of undergoing cataract surgery by comparison with an exposure below 40μg/m3, which is consistent with previous studies showing that NO2 is the pollutant most often associated with an increased risk of cataract surgery.\n“This concentration represents the current regulatory threshold of the European Union; however, it is still not achieved in several cities across Europe,” the authors wrote in their paper. “Adhering to this threshold could likely lead to a reduction in medical expenses for society.”\nThe authors did not find any association with exposure to fine particulate matter, which is consistent with the results of a cross-sectional study involving 30,000 Canadian participants and a South Korean longitudinal study. “However, among participants from (a UK Biobank study), those exposed to particulate matter 2.5 in the highest quartile were found to be 14% more likely to undergo cataract surgery compared to those in the lowest quartile,” the authors wrote. This may be due to differences in exposure ranges, which was particulate matter 2.5 in the United Kingdom and between 8μg/m3 and 21μg/m3, compared to 23μg/m3 to 34μg/m3 in this study.\n“Given the dissimilar concentration ranges, an effect at lower thresholds with a ceiling effect at higher concentrations cannot be ruled out. In addition, the composition of fine particulate matter might also differ between study areas. Particulate matter 2.5 and black carbon consist of a mixture of various constituents, some of which are more toxic, such as heavy metals. Moreover, the follow-up periods and durations were different, as well as the age of participants.\nAnother point the authors made is that access to healthcare may differ on a national scale, such as in the United Kingdom, compared to more localized areas with a good supply of healthcare professionals, like the Bordeaux metropolitan area.\nComplying with current European air pollution standards could reduce cataract surgery costs and improve population quality of life, the authors concluded.\n|\nClick |\n|\n|\nGayraud L, Mortamais M, Schweitzer C, et al.

This warning comes ahead of the expected opening of the plant this coming autumn.\nThe plant, operating under the terms of Japan's nuclear fuel cycle policy has faced a number of obstacles such as technical problems as well as an environmental safety risks which could further delay operations.\nAccording to Mitsuhisa Watanabe, a professor at Toyo University, \"A reverse fault, which could cause a giant earthquake, is reaching just under the uranium-enrichment factory within the plant, while the reprocessing facility is a little apart from the fault. The factory must be moved to another place immediately.\"\nIn Watanabe’s opinion, “such a plant should not have been established on such soft ground.\" He also found an active fault under Tsuruga Nuclear Power Plant in Fukui prefecture, and announced his findings at the end of May at the annual Japan Geoscience Union meeting in Chiba prefecture and in Tokyo Tuesday.\nThe massive Rokkasho plant, which consists of a spent fuel reprocessing facility, a uranium-enrichment factory, a low-level radioactive waste disposal center and a high-level radioactive waste management facility, has come under international spotlight, as it is the first such commercial plant in a nonnuclear-weapon state. Resource-poor Japan has decided to reprocess by extracting plutonium, which can be used to produce nuclear weapons and uranium from spent nuclear fuel.\nAccording to Watanabe, who acknowledges the importance of nuclear power for reducing dependency on fossil fuels, the plant is built on an uplifted marine terrace on the northeast coast of the mainland, and the reverse fault may be connected to an undersea fault. In this case, the active fault could total around 62 miles, and could potentially trigger an 8-magnitude earthquake.\nIt is a given rule in international communities that electric companies or governments geologize candidate sites carefully to avoid building nuclear facilities near active faults. Experts agree that active faults cause earthquakes sooner or later, and if a fault is found to be longer than 3 miles in length, the energy generated could be 6 times greater.\nTo construct a nuclear facility, Japan's electric companies are required to undergo two inspections and also need permits from the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan under the Cabinet Office. Some geologists and citizen groups who oppose nuclear power plants have pointed out the hazardous nature of active faults, which the electric companies and other related agencies never accepted. It is only recently that they have admitted to the existence of active faults under the facilities.\nThe Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd., which runs the Rokkasho plant, denied Watanabe's findings, stating, \"We have confirmed that there is no active fault that needs to be taken into consideration for the earthquake-resistant design of the reprocessing plant, except the fault Watanabe mentioned, which is not situated directly under the site, but in the vicinity of the site.\" In addition, the JNFL denied any link between the reverse fault and the undersea faults because the undersea faults running on the outer edge of the continental shelf are older than at least 700,000 to 800,000 years and the two faults were active during different epochs and lie in different directions.\nHowever, Taku Komatsubara, an expert in geology at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, acknowledges the two as active faults and agrees with Watanabe. At the same time, Komatsubara believes that, \"JNFL's counterstatement could be accepted if we were living in 1980 but that is quite far from the current standard of active fault study.”\nThe JNFL submitted its seismic report in November last year to the NISA, where a public relations officer explained that it was reviewing the report and that Watanabe's findings would be taken into consideration.\nNuclear reactors that require huge amounts of water to cool their facilities are typically built along a coastline, which is usually unstable. Electric power companies and safety review agencies tend to underestimate risk or neglect unfavorable data; doing otherwise would prevent the building of such facilities in Japan, one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries. \"I guess that they create the story that a potential building site is safe by deliberately ignoring active faults in order to facilitate the construction of nuclear reactors at that site,\" said Watanabe.\nAnother topographer, who spoke under the conditions of anonymity, investigated a site twenty years ago for a nuclear reactor for an electric power company. He admitted feeling uneasy when he saw the surveying technique, which differed from the standard procedure. \"They deliberately neglected active faults,\" he acknowledged.\nProtesters are wary of an active fault below or around nuclear facilities because there is the high possibility that it could be the epicenter of an earthquake that could damage a nuclear reactor from below including the reactor's water-cooling system and trigger a reactor meltdown, causing a catastrophic incident.\nIn the case of the Rokkasho plant, which holds roughly 3000 tons of spent nuclear fuel collected from 55 reactors in Japan, and located in an area the size of California; radiation contamination could possibly cover the whole of northern Japan.\nOnce the Rokkasho reprocessing facility starts operations to extract uranium and plutonium from nuclear wastes, the facility will discharge a vast amount of radioactive material into the air and ocean. The JNFL admits that the amount of radioactivity the facility discharges a day is almost similar to that produced by one of Japan's general nuclear reactor in a year. While the JNFL insists that the discharge is safe if the ingredients are diluted and spread, protesters argue that it may cause serious effects on humans as well as the environment.\nThe reprocessing facility also faces technical difficulties in the disposal process of the leftover radioactive waste after extracting uranium and plutonium. The material is mixed with molten glass and poured into steel containers where it is solidified and later buried.\nAs the technology required more research, the JNFL announced that it would finish the test to make glass canisters in July instead of May. After the test it will meet with Aomori prefecture administration officials and neighborhood communities and sign a formal agreement before starting full-scale operations. However, the problem of the newly emerged active fault undermines the reliability of the earthquake-resistance strength of the plant. That coupled with the pollution problems and technical difficulties in making glass canisters could postpone the operations further.\nThe negligence of safety review agencies was exposed when the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Station north of Tokyo, the world's largest rated nuclear power plant, was damaged by the tremors of a 6.8-magnitude earthquake last July. An undiscovered active fault was found directly below the plant. All seven reactors remain inactive.\nIn September 2006, outdated earthquake-resistant design standards were revised by strict new standards. In March, in accordance with the new standards, all electric power companies announced interim reassessment reports. The report admitted the existence of an active fault just below the Mihama Nuclear Power Plant and the Monju fast-breeder nuclear reactor, which was suspended in 1995 after a natrium leakage accident in Fukui prefecture. The report also acknowledged an active fault that ran within the area of the Tsuruga Nuclear Power Plant, a finding Watanabe had declared two months earlier, which was reported by Japan's daily Mainichi Newspaper in January. This may have brought pressure on the company to acknowledge the presence of the active fault.\n\"Although the study of active faults is a constantly advancing field, a review was conducted only once before the construction of nuclear facilities. The government should change the system to mandate a survey every ten years,\" said Kazuki Koketsu, of the Earthquake Research Institute at the University of Tokyo.\nWatanabe, who no longer trusts electric power companies and safety review agencies, is committed to continue surveying all nuclear facilities in Japan along with other impartial experts. \"I am sure that other active faults will be found just below or around nuclear facilities,\" he said.\n[\nlink to upiasiaonline.com\n]\nA.

    "text": "首页/\n城市/\n新政/\n经济/\n社会/\n文化/\n体育+/\n科教卫\n瞒着即将出院的父亲，他住进医院做了一件“有力的事”\n杭州日报讯 4月22日中午，48岁的徐培川成功捐献造血干细胞混悬液251毫升，成为浙江省第1195例、杭州市第373例造血干细胞捐献者。\n还有一些数字，更能代表徐培川的经历：20多年里130次挽起袖子，累计献血超5万毫升；因为婚前的一句承诺，为妻子做了20多年的饭；为了自考成人专科、成人本科，在开货车的业余时间用掉70多支笔芯备考；准备住院注射动员剂的前一晚，他还在给身患癌症的父亲送饭……\n一个个数字刻画出了一个“一根筋”的形象，可不同的数字串联到一起，正是徐培川的多味人生。\n自家人“淋过雨”，他更想为别人“撑把伞”\n今年正月，徐培川和妻儿在温州老家过完年后返回杭州。返程那天，他叮嘱父母，有不舒服的一定要告诉他。没想到，第二天一早，他的父亲就出现了小便出血症状，去医院一查，膀胱癌。\n也就是徐培川回到杭州当天，上城区红十字会的电话打来了：他与一名血液病患者配型成功。该不该答应捐献造血干细胞？在那个坎上，徐培川和家人都有顾虑，但他们深切地知道，找到合适的配型者有多不容易。\n2010年，徐培川的表哥患上了白血病，家中先后花去治疗费用200余万元。“等了两年都没等到合适的配型者，表哥36岁就走了。”徐培川说。\n自家人“淋过雨”，徐培川更想为别人“撑把伞”。在等待造血干细胞正式采集的日子里，徐培川比以往更加注意饮食、锻炼。然而，患病的父亲始终让他放心不下。\n4月17日，徐培川住院注射动员剂的前一天，他傍晚下班后，照常买菜、做饭：凉拌黄瓜、酸菜鱼、清炒茼蒿、萝卜炒猪肉、红烧排骨。他留出了二人份，准备晚点送去浙大二院的病房。“老爸刚动过手术，老妈陪着，明天上午就能出院了，他们还不晓得明天下午我也要住院去了。”徐培川说，因为自己要一连住好几天院，没法照顾父母，所以事先已经托姐姐、姐夫接手。\n徐培川和妻子赶到医院时，饭菜还是热乎的。79岁的老父亲在接受两次手术治疗后，身体像漏气的气球一样瘪了下去，瘦了几十斤。他躺在病床上，朝徐培川的方向看，喉咙里咕噜着，像是在喊一个名字。“他把你认成他的大孙子了。”徐培川向记者解释。\n母亲给父亲喂饭时，徐培川叉腰站在床尾，喃喃道：“当年我爷爷也是在这个年龄患上癌症……那时我还小……”\n最无力的时候，他选择做一些有力的事\n徐培川出生于温州的农村，在他记忆里，小时候家里很穷。年少时的他很皮，没读几年书就跑去山西，在姐姐的服装店里当学徒。学了两年，他开起了自己的小店。1999年，手头的生意越发红火，他迅速招兵买马，开起了服装厂，店面也扩充到了3家。\n然而，没过几年，服装厂就倒了。徐培川赔了20万元，还欠了一身债。2002年，他去了陕西运了一车苹果，本想着靠这挣钱还债，没想到，低温导致苹果受损严重，20多吨的苹果有8吨是坏的，钱没挣到，反而亏了8000元。\n祸不单行，那一年，徐培川的父亲生病住院，他的爷爷也被诊断为癌症。生活拮据的一家人再面难题，而徐培川已找不到好的解法。在医院陪护期间，徐培川偶然在报纸上看到了献血报道。“是好事啊，献血有益于血液新陈代谢，家里人如果需要用血，费用也可以减免。”徐培川说，20余年的献血生涯就是从那时开始的，而2018年的一次献血中，他申请加入了中华骨髓库。\n为什么要在最困难的时候去献血，徐培川也记不清了，只说了一句：“或许，人越在无力的时候，越想做一些有力的事情。”\n跑货运还债的路上，他“啃”出了本科文凭\n2003年，为尽快还债，徐培川借钱买了一辆车，开始跑货运，专门运输旧衣服、旧纸箱。当时，开货车收入不错，加上他踏实肯干，很快赚到了钱，又买了两辆货车，后来还在杭州买了房。\n就在日子好起来的时候，天降横祸。某天，徐培川在路上被一辆车迎面撞倒，车上下来一人，朝着他的腹部就是一刀。等他定睛看时，竟发现对方是有过数面之交的人。经过9个多小时的手术，徐培川切除了部分大肠，又在医院住了20多天，总算捡回了一条命。“有些人觉得我挣钱了，就眼红，笑你穷、恨你富、怕你有……”在病床上，徐培川想了很多，最后得出了一个结论，“为什么这么多年我总是失败？还是因为知识欠缺，机会来了，却没有足够的智慧去接住。”\n调养身体期间，徐培川报考了成人自考专科。因为基础太差，26个英文字母都背不全，他学得很吃力。他报了培训班，又一遍遍地上网课，资料、笔记摞起来有1米高，笔芯都被他写废了70多支。2019年，他又报考了成人自考本科，跑长途时，他的身边也总带着复习资料。“我花了五六年时间，总共考了33门课，考了39次。”他说，这么做不仅是要弥补自己成长路上的遗憾，更要为两个孩子做榜样，“以身作则是最好的家教。”\n曾有朋友说徐培川，都多大年纪了，考出文凭也用不上。那时候，徐培川这么反问对方：“就算我只活到70岁，也还有20多年时间，为什么不学呢？”\n为了完成捐献，他对妻子“失信”了一回\n话说回来，命运对徐培川还是公平的，在他最困难的时候，送来了最珍贵的“人生礼物”。“他说对我一见钟情。”徐培川的妻子笑着说，“我是不相信的。”\n妻子是个直性子，当初经人介绍与徐培川相识那会儿，她就把丑话说在了前面：“我可不会做饭。”徐培川情商也是在线的，一拍胸脯：“不需要你做，我来。”\n徐培川这记拍胸脯换来了一个果断的决定。那时候，徐培川欠着债务，介绍人让女方想想清楚。没想到，这个女人只说了一句话：“他有本事亏掉，就有本事挣回来。”\n结婚20多年，徐培川履行诺言，成了穿围裙下厨房、家务包干的好丈夫，妻子则当上了“翘脚媳妇”。在徐培川的影响下，妻子也开始献血，14年间献血8000多毫升，连献血站的工作人员都认识了这对爱心夫妻。徐培川住院注射动员剂期间，妻子还独自跑去献了一次血。徐培川入院注射动员剂那天是4月18日，妻子和小儿子在医院陪他。因为没法下厨，徐培川第一次用手机给妻儿点外卖，捣鼓了半天才搞定。\n如今，徐家人早已无债一身轻，徐培川也进入杭州市水上运动中心，当起了接送运动员的专职司机。住院前，他向单位请了十来天假，领导得知内情后十分支持。\n在水上运动中心当司机，总该认识一两个出名的运动员吧？“我都不晓得名字的。”徐培川笑着说，“我就是个普通人，还是更专注怎么过好自己的生活。”",

Teammates and celebrities alike have flooded social media with messages that tug at the heartstrings, as the reality of her departure begins to sink in. Sophia Smith, her teammate, captured the collective sadness with a simple yet deeply touching note: “Thank you for everything. Love you.” Mallory Pugh, who shared the field with Morgan since her own debut in 2016, echoed the sentiment: “Thank you for all that you’ve done for this game. Love you.” What’s your reaction? Did Alex Morgan just break your heart with her retirement announcement? React! Reactions Naomi Girma, who stood beside Morgan during their recent FIFA Women’s World Cup run, expressed a deep sense of loss: “A legend of the game in every way. I’m going to miss you so much, all love.” And across social media, the reactions were equally emotional. Korbin Albert’s tribute on X summed up what so many are feeling: “Thank you, Alex Morgan … a legend never to be forgotten. ❤️ #ThankYouAlex.” Alex Morgan’s influence stretches beyond the soccer field. Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit, [shared his personal gratitude](https://x.com/alexisohanian/status/1831711547267195274): “ICON: @alexmorgan13, I know the sky is the limit for you, and you’re going to continue achieving greatness for football and beyond. You’re the reason I got into women’s soccer, and your reply led me to fund and launch @weareangelcity. For that, I’ll always be grateful. Can’t wait to see what’s next.” These heartfelt messages speak volumes. First, that Alex Morgan is, without question, a towering figure in women’s soccer—a legend whose name will be spoken with reverence for years to come. And second, her absence will be felt deeply, both on and off the pitch. So what exactly prompted this retirement? Why did Alex Morgan retire? As Alex Morgan retires, her journey has been one that is worth looking back at. Her journey started back in 2009 when she first joined the U.S. Women’s National Team. Since then, her rise has been historic. And now her heartfelt goodbye is gut-wrenching and beautiful, but nothing short of historic. In her emotional retirement video, she went on to say, “I grew up on this team; it was so much more than soccer. It was the friendships, the unwavering respect, and the relentless push for global investment in women’s sports.” Alex also announced that she is expecting her second child. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad What’s your perspective on: With Alex Morgan retiring, who will step up as the new face of women's soccer? Have an interesting take? View this post on Instagram Alex’s retirement is a sad one but it is also the celebration and end of a great legacy. Alex Morgan has a series of wins that will be remembered. She holds two FIFA Women’s World Cup titles (2015 and 2019). She also holds an Olympic Gold Medal (2012), an Olympic Bronze Medal (2020), and a CONCACAF W Gold Cup (2024). On the pitch, she was quite literally a game-changer for the US. The U.S. Women’s National Team almost never lost a match when she scored. With her the team has a total of 76 wins out of 86 times. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Alex Morgan’s club career is an equally iconic one. Alex has played with several NWSL teams including the San Diego Wave, Portland Thorns, and Orlando Pride, and in Europe with Lyon and Tottenham. With over 90 goals in 212 appearances and six trophies to her name, her impact on the field is ineffable. As Alex herself reflects, “I learned so much about myself in that time and so much of that is a credit to my teammates and our fans. I feel immense pride in where this team is headed, and I will forever be a fan of the USWNT.” Alex also went on to add, “My desire for success may have always driven me, but what I got in return was more than I could have ever asked and hoped for.” The world is saying goodbye to more than a player; they’re saying farewell to an icon, a trailblazer, and a beloved figure who changed the game forever. As she steps away from the limelight, her name will echo across generations to come.",

    "text": "El Invima alerta de la venta de cápsulas para la probiota vaginal sin registro sanitario\nLa autoridad sanitaria afirma que el producto Fem Vaginal Probiotic Capsules, presentado como un ‘suplemento dietario’, no ha pasado por un control de calidad y se comercializa de forma ilegal\nEl Instituto Nacional de Vigilancia de Medicamentos y Alimentos (Invima) ha lanzado una advertencia sobre un nuevo producto que se ofrece como un suplemento alimenticio con bacterias benéficas para la salud vaginal. A través de una alerta sanitaria, el Invima llamó a evitar el uso de las cápsulas ‘Fem Vaginal Probiotic Capsules’ por los riesgos a la salud de los consumidores.\nLa autoridad sanitaria aseguró que el producto no cuenta con ningún registro y, por lo tanto, no cumple con la normatividad vigente en el país y su venta se considera ilegal. Sin el aval de la Dirección de Medicamentos y Productos Biológicos del ente encargado de dar el visto bueno a los fármacos y suplementos antes de ser lanzados al mercado, resulta imposible conocer las características de las cápsulas, como su fabricación, trazabilidad, condiciones de almacenamiento y transporte.\nDe acuerdo con el sitio oficial del producto, que ofrece un paquete de 60 cápsulas por 99.900 pesos, se trata de “un suplemento alimenticio que contiene bacterias beneficiosas para la salud vaginal”. Tanto la web como las redes sociales hacen énfasis en la que se trata de un “producto avalado por ginecólogos”, sin una referencia explícita al Invima u otro organismo regulatorio. El sitio también incluye enlaces para hacer el pedido por vía WhatsApp y ordenar las cápsulas en línea.\nEn caso de haber adquirido los óvulos, el Invima llamó a suspender su aplicación y comunicar al Instituto los datos sobre los lugares donde se comercializa el producto. Ante algún efecto adverso provocado por su consumo, las autoridades recomiendan reportarlo por correo electrónico a la dirección invimafv@invima.gov.co.\nEn diciembre de 2024, las autoridades advirtieron de la comercialización de Yoni Pearls, otro sello de óvulos vaginales que se promocionaban como un tratamiento alternativo para tratar infecciones y carecían de regulación sanitaria. Para verificar el registro de cualquier producto en Colombia, basta con ingresar al sitio oficial del Invima, seleccionar el grupo al que corresponde (medicamento, suplemento, etc.) y hacer una búsqueda por nombre. El microbioma vaginal, clave en el estado de salud del tracto reproductivo femenino, es una de las grandes asignaturas pendientes de la medicina y el conocimiento científico del cuerpo humano. La atención prestada en investigar a fondo las bacterias, hongos y virus que dan forma a la flora vaginal es aún insuficiente, un sesgo de género que impide conocer a fondo los microbios del ecosistema vaginal y cómo interactúan entre ellos.\nTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo\n¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?\nSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.\nFlechaTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.\nSi quieres compartir tu cuenta, cambia tu suscripción a la modalidad Premium, así podrás añadir otro usuario.

    "title": "La DANA va a complicar el puente con más de 100 l/m2 en Cataluña y la Comunidad Valenciana",
    "text": "La presencia de la DANA va a seguir complicando el tiempo durante el puente de Todos los Santos y podría dejar este viernes más de 100 litros por metro cuadrado (l/m2) en el sur de Cataluña y el norte de la Comunidad Valenciana, según la predicción del portavoz de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET), Rubén del Campo. Por ello, ha pedido consultar el estado del tiempo y de las carreteras si se va a emprender un viaje. Del Campo ha explicado que la situación más complicada de este viernes estará en el suroeste peninsular. En concreto, Huelva (Andalucía) registrará chubascos muy fuertes y podrá superar los 40 litros por metro cuadrado (l/m2). A su vez, también caerán probablemente chubascos fuertes en otras zonas de Andalucía occidental y sur de Extremadura. Además, ha añadido que la situación seguirá siendo complicada en el área mediterránea, en el sur de Cataluña especialmente y en el norte de la Comunidad Valenciana. Allí, los chubascos podrán ser persistentes y los acumulados podrán superar los 100 l/m2. Esto puede provocar de nuevo crecidas en cauces e inundaciones en zonas bajas, por lo que el portavoz de AEMET ha recomendado alejarse de este tipo de zonas. A su vez, ha advertido sobre el clima en Baleares durante la jornada de mañana. En las islas, las lluvias podrán ser muy intensas y podrán dejar 50 l/m2 en sólo una hora o incluso 120 l/m2 en unas pocos horas. Al igual que en el caso de la Comunidad Valenciana, Del Campo ha pedido precaución en el archipiélago, dado que también pueden producirse crecidas e inundaciones en zonas bajas. El sábado continuará la inestabilidad con chubascos de nuevo fuertes y persistentes en el sur de Cataluña, en la Comunidad Valenciana y de nuevo en el archipiélago Balear. De forma más débil, se podrán registrar en puntos del tercio sur de la península. El portavoz de AEMET ha avanzado que la tendencia para el domingo y el lunes es la de que la DANA vaya desapareciendo y que la situación sea más estable. Aún así, ha indicado que todavía se producirán chubascos en el Levante, en Cataluña, en el área del Estrecho y en Baleares. Estos podrán ser fuertes aún durante el lunes, en especial en el sur de Cataluña, en la Comunidad Valenciana y en el sur de Aragón. De cara al martes y días siguientes probablemente se dará una situación más estable en todo el país, aunque a día de hoy, Del Campo no descarta posibles chubascos, una vez más, en el área Mediterránea. Todo esto estará acompañado con unas temperaturas que no van a variar demasiado y que serán en general algo más cálidas de lo habitual para esta época del año.
