    "text": "Crisis interna en el PDG: diputada Medina presenta querella contra presidente del partido por presunta falsificación de instrumentos La acción legal apunta a una serie de irregularidades, incluyendo la manipulación de actas de proclamación y certificados del Tribunal Supremo. La diputada del Partido de la Gente (PDG), Karen Medina, presentó una querella contra del actual presidente, Luis Moreno Villablanca, y otros posibles responsables del presunto delito de falsificación de instrumento privado vinculados a la constitución y elecciones internas del partido. En sus declaraciones, la parlamentaria expresó: “No estoy disponible para mirar desde la galería cómo se siguen mal utilizando los recursos de los chilenos y haciendo triquiñuelas para ostentar el poder. Esto es caiga quien caiga”. Revisa también La querella documenta una serie de irregularidades, incluyendo la manipulación de actas de proclamación y certificados del Tribunal Supremo. Es más, se alega que Moreno y su equipo utilizaron firmas de miembros que nunca participaron en los eventos mencionados. Estas supuestas acciones fraudulentas tenían como objetivo obtener subvenciones estatales para el partido, alcanzando la cifra de $1.331.619.361 entre 2021 y 2023. Legitimidad de la administración La denuncia también pone en tela de juicio la legitimidad de la actual administración del PDG, ya que el Servicio Electoral (Servel) registró al órgano ejecutivo del partido para el período 2021-2023, basándose en procesos electorales que, según la querella, fueron adulterados de manera fraudulenta. En la misma, la diputada Medina destacó su preocupación por las presuntas irregularidades en el Partido de la Gente, cuestionando la prórroga irregular del mandato del actual timonel, quien habría cumplido su plazo en agosto pasado.

    "title": "Steve Bannon: I Will Be Shocked If There Are No Criminal Referrals for What Victoria Nuland and Others Have Done in Other Countries in the Name of the American People",
    "text": "The Gateway Pundit’s Richard Abelson revealed in August 2023 how Victoria Nuland and the Biden regime were responsible for the overthrow of Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan.\nThe Biden Regime is behind the overthrow of Pakistan’s democratically elected Prime Minister Imran Khan, explosive diplomatic cables reveal. Revolver News’ Darren Beattie charges that Color Revolution insurrectionist Victoria Nuland, who is also to blame for the Ukraine Coup 2014 and the current horrific war, orchestrated the coup.\nOn March 7, 2022, Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Donald Lu and Deputy Assistant Secretary Lesslie Vigueri met with Pakistan’s ambassador to the U.S. Asad Majeed Khan in Pakistan House in Washington D.C., and threatened U.S. sanctions unless Prime Minister Imran Khan is ousted. The Pakistani side comprised Deputy Chief of Mission Syed Naveed Bokhari and the defense attaché, The Dawn reports.\nThe next day, March 8, the Pakistani National Assembly voted to remove Khan.\nOn March 27, Imran Khan produced the diplomatic cipher, showing US demands to remove Khan in a coup. As early as 2021, Imran Khan had accused Victoria Nuland and the Biden administration of trying to oust him. Ironically, Khan was investigated in October 2022 over daring to reveal the diplomatic cipher’s evidence of a “foreign conspiracy,” The Dawn reported, and banned from running for re-election.\nImran Khan is a former cricket star turned Pakistan’s most popular politician, who had taken a neutral stance on the Ukraine War after the Russian invasion Feb. 24, 2022. In November 2022, Imran Khan was the target of an assassination attempt at a political rally, in an attack that wounded him and killed one of his supporters. In May 2023, he was arrested for corruption by paramilitary troops who smashed their way into the Islamabad High Court. On August 5, 2023, he was sentenced to three years in jail.\nUnbeknownst to the American public – The Biden regime has been working behind the scenes to plot wars, and blow up pipelines, and pay off Iranian mullahs, and set up secret biological labs, and overthrow Pakistani leaders, and meddle in Israeli politics – and the list goes on and on and on…\nAnd, quite often, Victoria Nuland’s name seems to appear in the mix.\nOn Thursday, Steve Bannon invited Darren Beattie from Revolver News on The War Room.\nSteve Bannon discussed what was next for Victoria Nuland and the Color Revolution folks when President Trump returns to office.\nSteve Bannon: I got to ask you, because you’re the world’s living expert on Victoria Newland and color revolutions, it’s kind of sad to see her, really, the queen of Ukraine sitting there on a cold square in the middle of the night, getting off a plane with one microphone there. No Zelensky, no big pomp in the circumstance. Your thoughts, sir?\nDarren Beattie: Yes. Truly a sad moment for Ms. Newland, but in the color revolution game, there are ups and there are downs, and I’m sure that she’ll have her next regime change opportunity soon enough. But, yeah, I mean, she’s not a new player to this game. She’s been around for a long time. Revolution, I guess a more successful endeavor than she has now. But most recently, I’d like to note that the former prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, that we’ve reported on her involvement in his know, Biden talks about meddling in all this, literally, he meddled directly in pakistani politics. The point of demanding that they overthrow Imran Khan or else they actually did do that and more. So they put him in jail and he was recently sentenced. So, you know, for Victoria Newland, there are ups and downs. So she’s had a recent victory, and we’ll see how the Ukraine thing turns out, but it doesn’t look good for her.\nSteve Bannon: Well, when we win in November, it’s going to be. I tell you, I would be very shocked if there were no criminal referrals on what Victoria Nuland and others have done in other countries in the name of the American people. The American people had no earthly idea what they were doing.\nDarren also gave the latest update on the mysterious DC pipe bomb investigation from January 5-6, 2021.",

    "text": "British Journalist Douglas Murray Demolishes Progressive Cenk Uygur in Debate Over Israel and Hamas\n“As far as I can see, you’re very ill-traveled as well as rather ill-lettered and ill-spoken”\n14 Comments\nJournalist and author Douglas Murray appeared opposite Cenk Uygur of the ‘Young Turks’ on the Piers Morgan program this week to talk about the Israel/Hamas conflict. Uygur is a progressive and holds pretty much every left wing view on the topic one could imagine. Murray’s view is more in line with conservatives.\nUnfortunately for Uygur, this was not even close to a fair fight. Murray made Uygur look like the president of the high school Democrats debating a renowned expert.\nSpencer Brown writes at\nTownhall:\nWATCH: Three Straight Minutes of Douglas Murray Absolutely Destroying Cenk Uygur on Israel and Hamas\nToo often, since October 7, the anti-Israel Hamas-sympathizing figures in the media have had their lies and propaganda go unchecked. But on “Piers Morgan Uncensored” this week, Cenk Uygur was roundly put in his place by bestselling author and columnist Douglas Murray in a righteously indignant takedown.\nPoking holes all through Uygur’s arguments — and therefore also the smears being lobbed by his ilk — Murray demonstrated how vapid the catchphrase-y calls from those who seem enthused by the prospect of Hamas living to fight another day truly are.\nAfter Uygur retreated to the usual talking points about needing a “two-state solution” and called Israel’s supporters — including Murray — a “monster” supporting “genocide” and not caring about civilian deaths in Gaza, Murray let him have it after correctly pointing out Uygur is “just a very low-rent racist.”\n“Yes, I do care — I care very deeply about it,” Murray said in response to Uygur’s claim that he didn’t care about the death of Gazan children. “But I also know that the responsibility for their deaths lies on Hamas which has misgoverned their society for the last 16 years and now has been leading the country into being in a war with Israel. Yes, it’s on Hamas, this.”…\n“As far as I can see, you’re very ill-traveled as well as rather ill-lettered and ill-spoken, and I mentioned that I cover wars and go to wars because I happen to think myself that it’s worth seeing things with your own eyes including things that you don’t particularly like but you report the truth,” Murray explained. “I don’t know if you ever even leave your own bedroom.”\nMurray goes on to cite numerous other conflicts involving Muslims and points out that Uygur never talks about those situations because Jews are not involved.\nHere’s the short version:\n\"If there was an election tomorrow in the West Bank, Hamas would win.\"\nTensions rise as Douglas Murray and Cenk Uygur debate the Israel-Hamas war.\n[@DouglasKMurray]| [@CenkUygur]| [@piersmorgan]| [#PMU] [pic.twitter.com/8q1U8JoGVh]\n— Piers Morgan Uncensored (@PiersUncensored)\n[December 21, 2023]\nHere’s the full segment, if you’d like to watch it:\nThis is getting lots of attention on Twitter/X:\nHello 911, I’d like to report a murder.\n[pic.twitter.com/rBK0rSfAZo]\n— Rita Panahi (@RitaPanahi)\n[December 22, 2023]\nI loved every second of\n[@DouglasKMurray]outclassing Cenk Uygur on [@piersmorgan].

    "text": "A Lynwood, Washington man was sentenced on June 4, 2024 to seven days in jail for thermal trespass at Steamboat Geyser in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). A YNP press release said 21-year-old Viktor Pyshniuk was also placed on two years of unsupervised release and received a two-year ban from the park. Pyshniuk was also ordered to pay a $1,500 fine, $30 mandatory court processing fee, and $20 special assessment. The offense occurred on April 19, 2024, according to court documents. WATCH RELATED COVERAGE: 'Tourons' called out for bad behavior at YNP The release said a YNP law enforcement officer was dispatched to the thermal area at Steamboat Geyser, located in the Norris Geyser Basin, by an on-duty park employee. The employee reported a person walking off the boardwalk at Steamboat Geyser. A photo taken by the employee allegedly showed that Pyshniuk had clearly crossed over the fence and was walking up the hillside within 15-20 feet of Steamboat Geyser’s steam vent. Pyshniuk told the YNP officer he left the boardwalk to take photos. According to the release, the officer pointed out signs posted throughout the area stating that it is illegal to leave the boardwalk and explained the dangers of walking in a thermal area to Pyshniuk. WATCH MORE: Bison gores 83-year-old woman in Yellowstone National Park During sentencing, Magistrate Judge Stephanie A. Hambrick told Pyshniuk that the sentence was intended to deter both him and members of the public, who might have witnessed his actions, from leaving the boardwalk in a thermal area. Hambrick also explained that the three-foot fencing around the boardwalk is a clear sign that the area is closed and entering it is prohibited. “Trespassing in closed, thermal areas of Yellowstone National Park is dangerous and harms the natural resource,” Acting United States Attorney Eric Heimann said in the release. “In cases like this one where we have strong evidence showing a person has willfully disregarded signs and entered a closed, thermal area, federal prosecutors will seek significant penalties, including jail time.” The case was investigated by Yellowstone National Park law enforcement officers and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Ariel Calmes. According to the release, Steamboat Geyser, the world's tallest active geyser, is also the most dangerous, with erratic and unpredictable eruptions that can rise anywhere from six to 300 feet high.",

    "text": "La caída de la empresa Caminos del Río Uruguay SA como concesionaria vial en rutas nacionales hizo que ayer un nutrido grupo de trabajadores se manifieste en el peaje del enlace vial Rosario-Victoria, para renovar el alerta ante la certeza de que 500 familias quedarán sin empleo. Leandro Bond, titular de Sutracovi, el sindicato que agrupa a esos trabajadores del peaje, indicó que el plazo perentorio es el 8 de abril. “Acá el 9 de abril la ruta quedará sin nada ni nadie, sin protección ni auxilio al que sufra un accidente. Nadie ayudará”, advirtió. Desde entonces, la barrera será levantada y solo quedará un retén de Gendarmería en el inicio de la ruta 174 que atraviesa el humedal del Paraná para unir Santa Fe con Entre Ríos, a la altura de Rosario y Victoria.\n“Luego dicen que se hará cargo Vialidad (nacional), pero los mismos compañeros nos dicen que es inviable eso porque también en Vialidad habrá 1500 despidos”, avizoró Bond. Por todo eso, los manifestantes exigen al Gobierno nacional que garantice no solo la fuente laboral sino también las condiciones de mantenimiento vial para la seguridad de los usuarios.\n“La empresa nos dijo que no tiene el dinero ni para las indemnizaciones, y culpa al Estado porque hace cinco años que no le permite actualizar la tarifa. En el medio estamos nosotros”, redondeó el gremialista.\nCaminos del Río Uruguay (CRUSA) explota los peajes en las rutas nacionales 174 (conexión a Victoria), 12 y 14 desde hace tres décadas. Pero hace tiempo ya que viene denunciando incumplimientos del Estado nacional al pliego de concesión, en lo que hace a la actualización tarifaria. Dicen que el costo de peaje que hoy está en 900 pesos debería ser de $2.400.\nSegún plantea la concesionaria, los incumplimientos vienen desde 2009, y ese historial ha llevado a que hoy la empresa esté concursada, a riesgo de quiebra, y con la retirada del servicio a partir del 9 de abril.",

    "text": "La lavadora realiza funciones específicas que pueden ayudarle a mantener sus prendas limpias, ya sea de manera profunda o en lavado rápido, sin malos olores o manchas, mientras que protege el tono, la elasticidad y la suavidad de las telas blancas o de color. (Lea también: El sencillo elemento que debe poner en la lavadora para que la ropa quede más limpia y además ayuda a ahorrar energía). Pero cuando se trata de ropa que necesita en el transcurso de la semana como los uniformes del colegio o del trabajo, puede ser tedioso esperar hasta que la humedad se vaya por completo, debido a que suele tomar mucho tiempo secar al aire libre. En caso de que no solo le interese mantener sus prendas libres de manchas, sino que también desee cuidar el medio ambiente, opte por utilizar el percarbonato de sodio, también conocido como peróxido de hidrógeno sólido, que se obtiene a partir de sal, agua y tiza dos materias primas naturales, según el sitio web ‘Usar y reusar’. (Siga leyendo: El truco de las pelotas de tenis en la lavadora que le cambia la vida a quienes tienen mascotas). Este ingrediente le permitirá desmanchar, limpiar, desodorizar, blanquear y descalcificar sin decolorar, el cual contiene un pH alcalino que le ayuda al detergente a actuar de una manera más efectiva, especialmente si se emplea con agua tibia o caliente. Para utilizarlo, solo debe añadir un par de cucharadas al tambor de la lavadora, ya sea en la carga completa de la ropa color o blanca, y dejar que el electrodoméstico realice las funciones que le indicó dependiendo de las prendas a limpiar. Si alguno de sus jeans o buzos tiene una mancha difícil de quitar, lo mejor será que prepare una pasta de percarbonato de sodio añadiendo en un pequeño recipiente una cucharada del polvo y dos de agua, mezcle muy bien, frote con un cepillo en el área y deje que actúe durante media hora. (De interés: ¿Cuál es el vinagre adecuado que debe utilizar para limpiar la lavadora?). Cuando se encuentre en apuros y necesite que algunas de sus prendas queden completamente secas o no tan húmedas para utilizarlas ese mismo día o el siguiente, puede intentar este sencillo truco para aquellos que no cuenten con una lavadora secadora en su hogar. Para esto solo necesita una toalla que debe usar después de que el electrodoméstico haya completado su ciclo de lavado. Retire todas las prendas que se encontraban en su interior y ubique la tela dentro del tambor, tapándolo por completo, de acuerdo con ‘Ok Diario’. Este elemento debe estar seco y limpio para volver a introducir toda la ropa mojada a la lavadora. Luego, seleccione el modo de centrifugado o el programa que usted considere que le ayude a secar más rápido y la tela absorberá parte de la humedad contenida mientras termina el ciclo. ¿Cuál es la hora en que la lavadora utilizaría más energía y no se debería de usar?

The funding is part of a $750 million effort in President Biden’s Investing in American agenda. The money from the Department of Energy will go to 52 projects across 24 states to position the United States as a global leader in the clean hydrogen industry.\nThe combined outcomes of the 52 projects should allow the U.S. to produce enough technology per year to power 15% of medium- and heavy-duty trucks sold each year, produce an extra 1.3 million tons of clean hydrogen annually, and support more than 1,500 new jobs.\nDing’s three-year project will address the technical challenges of proton-conducting solid oxide electrolysis cell stacks, a type of technology that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen gases using electricity. By enabling this process, the stacks allow for the efficient conversion of electrical energy into chemical energy, producing hydrogen as a clean and renewable fuel source. Hydrogen produced through this method can result in zero greenhouse gas emissions. The goal of Ding’s project is to develop the technology to be suitable for real-world use.\n“This project will advance the technology maturity of [the technology] and, from a bigger picture, promote the green hydrogen applications of the state of Oklahoma,” Ding said.\nFinding a way to store and convert energy is necessary to make renewable and sustainable energy more feasible. Clean hydrogen is a way for industries to reduce emissions while continuing to provide services needed for modern life. Ding’s Advanced Materials and Clean Energy Laboratory researches technological improvements to reach net-zero emissions. The lab specializes in materials research, development and prototype system demonstration for fuel cells, hydrogen production and electrochemical processing.\nUnder this grant, OU will collaborate with researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Kansas State University and Chemtronergy LLC to deliver this advanced electrolysis technology. The Idaho National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory also support the research.\nDing’s project is well aligned with the goals of the Oklahoma Hydrogen Roadmap from the Hydrogen Production, Transportation and Infrastructure Task Force report, which includes a near-term goal of hydrogen storage and innovative technologies and long-term goals of low carbon hydrogen and equipment manufacturing.\nAbout the project: The project, “Development of Readily Manufactured and Interface Engineered Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells with High Efficiency and Durability,” is funded through the Department of Energy grant DE-FOA-0002922 .\nAbout the University of Oklahoma: Founded in 1890, the University of Oklahoma is a public research university in Norman, Oklahoma. As the state’s flagship university, OU serves the educational, cultural, economic and health care needs of the state, region and nation. OU was named the state’s highest-ranking university in U.S. News & World Report’s most recent Best Colleges list . For more information, visit www.ou.edu",

No specific details of the proposed agreement were released, although union officials said it includes higher wages, additional pension contributions, better and faster access to health care benefits and improvements in staffing.\n“This victory wouldn’t have been possible without the power of our collective action,” the United Food and Commercial Workers Stater Bros. Bargaining Committee said in a statement.\n“Together, we stood up to the company’s disrespect and made it clear that we are a strong union family, united in solidarity to fight for the contract we deserve. ”\nFurther details of the tentative agreement will be shared exclusively with union members in upcoming meetings, with more information shared with the public after voting is completed, the union said.\nThe agreement was reached after four negotiating sessions in nine days.\n“Negotiations were conducted in good faith, with both sides working hard to reach a fair deal that supports our teammates and holds the line on prices for our customers,” Stater Bros. Markets said in a statement.\n“We appreciate the collaborative effort and are encouraged that the union is recommending the agreement for ratification.”",
