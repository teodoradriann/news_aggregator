The party has published a Bill which would allow asylum seekers to have a right to work while their asylum applications are being processed. [Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/movement-of-asylum-seekers/) (MASI) spokesman Bulelani Mfaco said asylum seekers are not motivated by a right to work when choosing where to apply for international protection. Speaking at a press conference in Dublin, Mr Mfaco, a South African man who was granted asylum last year having been in Ireland since 2015, said countries such as Sweden and Portugal have less restrictive employment rights than Ireland but are not getting relatively more migrants.

He responded: “I don’t believe that there is anybody in Nigeria, Sudan, Jordan or Palestine that is going through different asylum systems at present who is selecting what country will give them the best reception. I don’t believe that is the case.” He suggested there was “pure ignorance” out there as to how the asylum process worked and not many people knew that asylum seekers are not allowed to work when they first arrive in Ireland. “Things like that fuel the kind of ignorance we see online and [that] is now spilling over into the streets. We need to have responsible leadership when it comes to how we talk about migration.” Currently asylum seekers can apply for the right to work only after being in Ireland for five months and there is a 150-day wait. PBP TD Paul Murphy said the Government was currently engaged in “performative cruelty” with asylum seekers and was pandering to far-right protesters. The cruelty is intended to distract from Government failures in terms of housing, healthcare and cost of living and instead to focus attention on migrants, he claimed. He said the fact that there are 2,000 asylum seekers in the State who are currently on the streets is an “absolute scandal”. “There are enough empty beds in the system for every one of the currently homeless asylum seekers.” He was also critical of Sinn Féin’s policy on asylum, stating that in three of its recently announced five-point plan it planned to be harder on asylum seekers than the current Government. Mr Murphy suggested it would make “all the sense in the world” for asylum seekers to be allowed to work and contribute where there are labour shortages such as in the construction industry and in public transport where bus drivers are needed. Up to 10,000 asylum seekers could benefit from an automatic right to work based on current figures, he suggested. “That would result in a real integration in workplaces. It would break down some of the suspicion and fear that exists because people would be working side-by-side with asylum seekers and seeing that these are people like you and me who want to work and contribute to society.” The latest figures for international protection applicants show 429 arriving the week ending July 7th, 328 the week ending July 14th, 285 the week ending July 21st, 424 for the week ending August 4th and 388 for the week ending August 11th.

    "title": "Open Letter to Jewish Students",
    "text": "Dear Jewish Students,\nI know many of you just experienced your worst semester, ever. Beyond the shared anguish of every Jew, and every moral human being, following Hamas’s October 7 th savagery, you’ve endured the added agony of betrayal. You’ve seen roommates, classmates, professors, and university presidents cower before evil – or, worse, collaborate with it by celebrating it — depending on the context, of course. This, therefore, may have been your most illuminating semester too. You discovered who your friends are — and aren’t. You saw what happens when people, even intellectuals, get swept up in an ideological mania demanding total loyalty, tolerating no disagreement, no nuance, no complexity, no doubt. You had to think independently. You saw what moral clarity looks like and experienced what it feels like. And, most important, you unlearned much of what you and your parents foolishly pay up to $77,000-a-year to swallow.\nIt’s true, our super-heroic Israeli soldiers have shown remarkable bravery – and modeled extraordinary values. But, remember, wherever they go in Israel, they get “feergun,” that wonderful Hebrew word describing “attaboys” conveyed with slaps on the back and high-fives. By contrast, you students need tremendous spiritual courage to embrace Israel and Zionism on campus. The fact that you get the opposite – cold shoulders, social ostracism, online hostility, even harassment – increasingly requires physical courage, too.\nLet’s return to October 7 th . The campus ethical dynamics would have differed had more students and professors stopped, on hearing about the massacre, and felt your pain. Had more said, “I dislike Israel, but this sadistic violence, rape and kidnapping is inexcusable,” you wouldn’t have felt so victimized once these Palestinian apologists started denouncing Israel’s bombing in Gaza.\nIsrael faces difficult military dilemmas and healthy debates are always welcome. But the way so many academics and students denied what Hamas did, or justified Hamas’s evil, is inexcusable – shattering the bond of trust real education and genuine community require.\nSimilarly, as Israel’s military campaign advanced, if some Bash-Israel-Firsters had acknowledged that Hamas was wrong to hide armaments or terrorists in Hamospitals, Hamosques and Killergardens, you could discuss issues reasonably. Had any of these Isra-critics credited Israel for some restraint, for trying to minimize civilian deaths, you could have a productive conversation about “do”s and “don’t”s. Had anyone proposed a better solution to the problem of Hamas turning Gaza into a ticking time bomb that already caused so much death and destruction, we all might have learned something.\nInstead libelous cries of “genocide” – demonizing Israel, romanticizing Hamas – muddied the campus conversation. Meanwhile, the masked Pro-Palestinian protesters’ sheer thuggishness has further shut down conversation. Where are all those overpaid administrators who call for “safe spaces,” censoriously monitoring students’ and professors’ glances and words, when hooligans menace you aggressively?\nLet’s be clear. Every death in Gaza since October 7 th is on Hamas – they started it. And every death near Lebanon is on Hezbollah. Note how Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis attack Israel simply because Israel exists. To these haters, just having Israel around is a “causus belli” – why does the world accept that?\nNow, here’s your chance to join the crowd. Let’s shout: “CEASEFIRE NOW!!!!” Demand a ceasefire from Hezbollah, from the Houthis, from Iran, and from Hamas — free the hostages, surrender the October 7th war criminals, then we can have peace!\nTaking a breath, let’s think. How did Hamas control Gaza with an iron fist, yet still convince academics and students that Israel occupied Gaza? And how did Hamas smuggle in tons of weapons, including over 30,000 explosive devices, and build hundreds of miles of tunnels, yet still convince academics and students that Israel blockaded Gaza and starved the Palestinians?\nDid any of your former friends consider what Hamas could have built instead of its fortifications? Finally, why would feminists ally with rapists, gays support homophobes, and liberals support dictators? It takes a lot for intelligent people who see themselves as human rights activists to ignore so many facts. Only people gripped by an ideological mania, swept up by some cultish fad, could be so fanatically embrace such horrific friends, such an embarrassing cause.\nAdmittedly, even if Hamas exaggerates, Palestinians’ civilian death toll is heartbreaking. As the father of soldiers, attending too many funerals these days, I don’t need to be told how ugly this war is — all Israelis, alas, understand. We wish it would end. But it’s hard to believe that these fashionable radicals really care about suffering Palestinian suffering. Campuses were silent as the war in Yemen killed over 377,000 and the Syrian civil war killed over 600,000 – many of them Palestinians too.\nThree factors fuel this anti-Israel pile-on. First, the De-colonizing Grievance Junkies have made Israel the ultimate oppressor, reflecting every Western flaw, while treating Palestinians as the ultimate, Christ-like innocents, forever innocent, no matter how sadistic and violent they are. Second, the anti-Western Guilt-mongers caricature Jews and Israelis as the avatars of “white privilege,” even though we’re not all rich, we’re not all white, and people should judge our character and behavior by what we do and say not what we look like or how much we earn. And, alas, the Jews stand out so prominently in this new demonology because we have been starring in different people’s darkest dystopic fantasies and conspiracies theories for millennia.\nI don’t claim that Israel is beyond reproach on this issue or others. But, the fanaticism, the orthodoxy, the viciousness, the conversation’s total all-or-nothingness is distorting.\nI hope this semester of slaughter taught you a few essential life-lessons:\nFirst, never cower – the enemy smells fear. Stand up for yourself, your friends, your people. Don’t be like so many sniveling professors these days: if you spend your life swivel-headed, forever looking over your shoulder, your neck will always hurt. Don’t avoid Jewish spaces because of threats – invite non-Jews for free steaks or beers to join you there. This too will clarify who your friends are – and aren’t.\nSecond, sift, clarify, and find allies. I believe a Silenced Majority of Americans, even on campus, abhors rapists, maimers, murderers, Hamasian despots, Palestinian terrorists, and the Iranian mullahs- let alone goons who deface America’s national monuments and harass Christmas shoppers. Find them. Befriend them. And invite them over too.\nThird, stop anguishing. The late New York Senator and Harvard Professor, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, didn’t ask “what’s wrong with the accused,” he asked “what’s wrong with the accuser?” Review the facts, from Israel’s full Disengagement out of Gaza in 2005 through October 7. And ask the question Amos Oz asked in 2014 about Hamas attacks from Gaza then: if your neighbor attacked, hiding behind kids, “what would you do” – knowing how America fights terrorists who hide behind the West’s civilized niceties.\nFourth, use this trauma as a moment of liberation. Free yourselves from orthodoxies, from rigidities, from fanaticism – on all sides. Beware extremists. Weigh, question, doubt, and find the middle path.\nFinally, use this crisis to think about your personal Jew-jitsu. How do you transform all this negative energy into something positive? Maybe it’s a new approach to your studies or a new career-path. Maybe it’s a renewed connection to Judaism or Zionism.\nDon’t just focus on the bad, the anger, the betrayal. Start dreaming of a better tomorrow, and what you can do, both to make it happen – and enjoy it.",

    "text": "Following Gen Zs remarkable victory in compelling the government to halt Sh346 billion in tax increases, the young Kenyan activists are now focusing on deeper issues such as entrenched corruption and poor governance.\nProtesters believe that the Finance Bill 2024, which President William Ruto withdrew was merely a symptom of broader challenges in a nation where numerous young individuals face limited job opportunities despite robust economic growth.\nIn a functioning democracy, the passage of a Finance Bill is a critical step in ensuring that a country’s budget and fiscal policies are effectively implemented. However, when a Finance Bill is rejected during presidential assent due to popular influence, it opens a complex debate about the legitimacy and potential dangers of an ensuing Appropriation Bill prepared and signed by the president.\nWhen a Finance Bill is rejected by the president, it often signifies a significant disagreement between the Executive branch and the Legislative process, potentially influenced by public opinion. This rejection can stem from various reasons, including public outcry over proposed taxes, spending cuts, or economic reforms. The president, responding to the will of the people, may decide not to assent to the Bill, forcing a reconsideration of fiscal policy.\nIn the wake of a rejected Finance Bill, the president and his team may draft an Appropriation Bill as an alternative fiscal policy measure. An Appropriation Bill typically outlines how government funds will be allocated and spent, often serving as a stop-gap measure to ensure the continued operation of government services.\nPotential dangers of the signed Appropriation Bill will lead to a lack of comprehensive legislative scrutiny whereby, unlike a Finance Bill 2024, which undergoes extensive debate and scrutiny in the legislature, an Appropriation Bill 2024 prepared by the Executive may not receive the same level of detailed examination.\nThis can lead to gaps or oversights in fiscal policy, potentially resulting in inefficient or wasteful spending. Again, the question emerges regarding this, as Kenyans, do we have doubts? The response is yes, reason being the same question led to the rejection of the Finance Bill 2024 by the people of Kenya.\nAnother critical problem is the centralisation of Power. The Executive unilaterally prepares and signs an Appropriation Bill, which can lead to an imbalance of power. The legislative branch, which represents the people’s interests, may be sidelined, undermining democratic principles and checks and balances within the government.\nThird, potential for unconstitutional actions whereby the legal framework of many countries mandates that financial legislation must be approved by the legislature. An Appropriation Bill, by passing this process, might be deemed unconstitutional, leading to legal challenges and further political instability.\nFinally, on public trust and legitimacy, the public perceives the Appropriation Bill as an Executive overreach or a deviation from democratic norms, it can erode trust in government institutions. This lack of trust can result in civil unrest, protests, and a general decline in social cohesion.\nThe legality of the Appropriation Bill hinges on the country’s constitution and legal precedents. In many democratic nations, the constitution delineates the roles of the Executive and Legislative branches in financial matters. If the executive’s actions violate these constitutional provisions, the Appropriation Bill may be considered illegal.\nHowever, there are scenarios where emergency powers or special provisions allow the executive to act unilaterally in times of crisis. If such provisions exist, the legality of the Appropriation Bill would depend on whether the current situation meets the criteria for these emergency measures.\nThe signed Appropriation Bill 2024 does not address the real problem that the country is facing at the moment, it was expected that this would speak to how the government will deal with issues on abductions, and the death toll of the young people who were fighting for their rights during demonstrations and as held accountable the police who were involved in the shooting of innocent Kenyans.\nThe acceptance of the Appropriation Bill by the people depends on several factors, including but not limited to transparency and justification. The president and his team can transparently justify the need for the Appropriation Bill and demonstrate that it serves the public interest, it might garner acceptance.\nStay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter\nClear communication about the reasons for bypassing the usual legislative process is crucial. Legal compliance is where the people are more likely to accept the Appropriation Bill if it complies with the Constitution and legal frameworks.\nIf the bill is challenged and upheld by the judiciary, it can lend legitimacy to the executive’s actions and public benefit and allow the contents of the Appropriation Bill to address the concerns that led to the rejection of the original Finance Bill, 2024.\nIf the new bill is perceived to provide tangible benefits and address public grievances, it might be accepted despite the unconventional process.\nIn conclusion, the rejection of a Finance Bill, 2024, and the subsequent preparation and signing of an Appropriation Bill, 2024 is a complex issue with significant legal and social implications.",

    "title": "Will Blue Throat trigger eat peppermint shrimp?",
    "text": "Will a Blue Throat Triggerfish Devour Your Peppermint Shrimp? The Cold, Hard Truth The short answer? Yes, a Blue Throat Triggerfish will likely eat your Peppermint Shrimp. While Blue Throat Triggers ( Xanthichthys auromarginatus ) are often touted as one of the more reef-safe triggerfish, “reef-safe” is a spectrum, not a guarantee. Their inherent nature as carnivores , combined with their opportunistic feeding habits , makes Peppermint Shrimp ( Lysmata wurdemanni ) a tempting snack.\nBlue Throat Triggers have a varied diet in the wild consisting of invertebrates. It’s this natural instinct to hunt invertebrates that creates the potential conflict in a reef tank environment. While some individuals may leave your Peppermint Shrimp alone – especially if well-fed and introduced to the tank after the shrimp have established themselves – you’re ultimately rolling the dice. Let’s dive deeper into why this is the case and explore the nuances of keeping these beautiful fish in a reef environment.\nUnderstanding the Blue Throat Triggerfish Blue Throat Triggerfish are prized for their striking coloration, relatively peaceful demeanor compared to other trigger species, and manageable size. They typically reach about 8-10 inches in captivity, making them suitable for larger reef tanks (125 gallons and up is recommended). However, their semi-aggressive nature and potential to prey on invertebrates need to be carefully considered.\nTemperament and Tank Mates While not as aggressive as the infamous Clown or Titan Triggerfish, Blue Throat Triggers are still triggers. They can be territorial, especially towards other triggers or similar-looking fish. Choosing appropriate tank mates is crucial. Consider larger, more assertive fish that won’t be bullied but also won’t provoke the trigger. Good choices often include tangs, larger angelfish, and wrasses.\nDiet and Feeding Habits Blue Throat Triggers are carnivores with a diverse diet in the wild. They consume a variety of invertebrates, small fish, and algae. In captivity, they readily accept a wide range of foods, including:\nHigh-quality marine pellets: These should form the base of their diet. Frozen foods: Mysis shrimp, brine shrimp, krill, and chopped seafood are excellent supplements. Live foods: Ghost shrimp, blackworms, and other small live foods can provide enrichment and mimic their natural feeding behavior. Algae: Offer nori seaweed sheets to supplement their diet with plant matter. A varied and nutritious diet is crucial for maintaining their health and reducing the likelihood of them preying on other invertebrates in the tank.\nPeppermint Shrimp: Beneficial but Vulnerable Peppermint Shrimp are a popular addition to reef tanks due to their appetite for Aiptasia anemones , a common pest that can quickly overrun corals. They are also relatively small and peaceful, making them seemingly ideal inhabitants. However, their small size and docile nature make them vulnerable to predation from larger fish, including the Blue Throat Trigger.\nSetting Up the Tank for Success To maximize the chances of cohabitation, consider these strategies:\nIntroduce the Peppermint Shrimp first: Allow them to establish themselves and become familiar with the tank before adding the triggerfish. This gives them a head start and provides them with hiding places. Provide plenty of hiding places: Rockwork, caves, and crevices offer refuge for the shrimp and can reduce the likelihood of them being targeted. Maintain a well-fed triggerfish: A satiated triggerfish is less likely to hunt for food, including your Peppermint Shrimp. Regularly observe your tank: Monitor the interactions between the triggerfish and the shrimp. If you notice any signs of aggression, be prepared to separate them. Ultimately, the success of keeping a Blue Throat Triggerfish with Peppermint Shrimp depends on the individual fish’s personality and your diligence in providing a suitable environment.\nIs it Worth the Risk? The decision of whether or not to keep a Blue Throat Triggerfish with Peppermint Shrimp is a personal one. If you are particularly fond of your Peppermint Shrimp or rely on them for Aiptasia control, it may be best to avoid the risk altogether. However, if you are willing to take a chance and can provide a suitable environment, it may be possible to keep them together successfully. Keep in mind that all species of triggerfish are aggressive towards each other.\nIt’s crucial to weigh the potential benefits of having a Blue Throat Triggerfish in your tank against the risk of losing your Peppermint Shrimp. Carefully consider your priorities and make an informed decision based on your specific circumstances. For more information about the impact of humans on aquatic ecosystems, check out The Environmental Literacy Council at enviroliteracy.org .\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What size tank is needed for a Blue Throat Triggerfish? A minimum of 125 gallons is recommended for a single Blue Throat Triggerfish. Larger tanks are always preferable, especially if you plan on keeping other fish or invertebrates.\n2. How do I introduce a Blue Throat Triggerfish to a reef tank? Acclimate the triggerfish slowly to the tank’s water parameters. Observe it closely for any signs of aggression towards other inhabitants. It’s often best to introduce it after other fish have established themselves.\n3. What are the signs of aggression in a Blue Throat Triggerfish? Signs of aggression include chasing, nipping, and cornering other fish. They may also display territorial behavior around specific areas of the tank.\n4. Can I keep a Blue Throat Triggerfish with other types of shrimp? Similar to Peppermint Shrimp, other types of ornamental shrimp, such as Cleaner Shrimp, are also at risk of being eaten by a Blue Throat Triggerfish. While some aquarists have had success keeping them together, it’s not a guarantee.\n5. What is the best way to feed a Blue Throat Triggerfish? Offer a varied diet of high-quality marine pellets, frozen foods, and occasional live foods. Feed them 2-3 times per day, providing only as much food as they can consume in a few minutes.\n6. Are Blue Throat Triggerfish prone to any diseases? Like all marine fish, Blue Throat Triggerfish can be susceptible to diseases such as ich (white spot disease) and marine velvet. Maintaining good water quality and quarantining new arrivals can help prevent these issues.\n7. How long do Blue Throat Triggerfish live? With proper care, Blue Throat Triggerfish can live for 10-15 years in captivity.\n8. What are some good tank mates for a Blue Throat Triggerfish? Suitable tank mates include larger tangs, angelfish, wrasses, and other fish that are not easily bullied. Avoid keeping them with smaller, more docile fish or other triggers.\n9. Will a Blue Throat Triggerfish eat corals? Blue Throat Triggerfish are generally considered reef-safe with corals . They are unlikely to nip at or damage corals.\n10. How can I reduce the risk of my Blue Throat Triggerfish eating my Peppermint Shrimp? Provide plenty of hiding places for the shrimp, introduce the shrimp before the triggerfish, and maintain a well-fed triggerfish.\n11. What should I do if my Blue Throat Triggerfish starts eating my Peppermint Shrimp? If you observe your triggerfish preying on your Peppermint Shrimp, you will need to separate them. This may involve moving the shrimp to a separate tank or rehoming the triggerfish.\n12. Are Blue Throat Triggerfish easy to care for? Blue Throat Triggerfish are relatively easy to care for, provided you can meet their needs for space, water quality, and diet.\n13. Do Blue Throat Triggerfish need a lot of rockwork in their tank? Yes, providing plenty of rockwork is important for Blue Throat Triggerfish. It provides them with hiding places, territories, and opportunities to exhibit their natural behaviors.\n14. Can I keep multiple Blue Throat Triggerfish together? It is generally not recommended to keep multiple Blue Throat Triggerfish in the same tank, unless it is a very large aquarium with plenty of space and hiding places. They can be territorial and aggressive towards each other.\n15. Where can I learn more about marine aquarium keeping? There are many resources available online and in print, including books, websites, and forums dedicated to marine aquarium keeping. Local fish stores and aquarium clubs can also be valuable sources of information and support.",
