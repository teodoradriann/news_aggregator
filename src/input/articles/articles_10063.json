    "title": "America Sees Its Future With India, Says US Envoy Eric Garcetti",
    "text": "US envoy Eric Garcetti was speaking at the Unites Services Institution (USI), Delhi on Thursday. In an interconnected world, \"no war is distant anymore\", US envoy Eric Garcetti said on Thursday and asserted that one must not just stand for peace, but also take concrete actions to make sure those who don't play by peaceful rules, their war machines \"cannot continue unabated\". \"And that is something the US needs to know and that India needs to know together,\" the ambassador said during a keynote address at an event here as he also pitched for forging a stronger partnership between New Delhi and Washington envisioning them together as an \"unstoppable force for good in the world\". His comments come in the backdrop of multiple ongoing conflicts in the world, including in Ukraine and Israel-Gaza. In his address at a defence news conclave here, he described India-US ties as deep, ancient and increasingly broad, and said \"today I think that culminates together as we look at the US-India defence partnership\". The event was held at the Unites Services Institution (USI), Delhi, and attended by many defence experts. \"We don't just see our future in India and India doesn't just sees its future with the US, but the world can see great things in our relationship. In other words, there are countries on the sidelines hoping this relationship works. Because, if it works, it doesn't just become a counterbalance, it becomes a place where we are developing our weapons together, integrating our training together,\" Garcetti said. In times of emergencies, whether that be a natural disaster or god forbid, a human-caused war, \"the US and India will be a powerful ballast against the waves that will sweep over Asia and other parts of the world\", he asserted. \"And I think, we all know that we are interconnected in the world, no war is distant anymore. And we must not just stand for peace, we must take concrete actions to make sure those who don't play by peaceful rules, that their war machines cannot continue unabated. And that is something the US needs to know and that India needs to know together,\" the envoy said. \"In the past three years, we have witnessed countries which have ignored sovereign borders. I dont' have to remind how important borders are, it's a central principle to peace in our world,\" he added. The American ambassador to India underlined that he had come to the event not to teach, preach or lecture, but always to listen in and learn and remind of their \"commonly shared values\". \"That when we stand on those principles and stand together, even in difficult times, we are friends, that we can show that principles are the guiding light of peace in our world. And together the world's two largest democracies can enhance the security, the stability of our region,\" he said. Underlining various areas of commonalty in India-US and its potential, the envoy said, \"India sees its future with America, America sees its future with India.\" \"Any objective observer will see that. We see it in our commerce, we see it in our people and certainly we see it in our security and future,\" he added. In his address, he also spoke of the historic state visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the US in June 2023. \"And a year after the prime minister came for that historic (visit), yes, one of the highlights of post-Independence India's relations with the US, there has nothing that has died down in enthusiasm, the focus, the relationship of Americans towards India,\" the envoy said. Describing the essence of the bilateral ties as \"commitment\", he said, \"It is a relationship. It is true, it is trusting and it is tried and it is tested.\" \"Love is the only thing you can give more and receive more of it back. It is not a finite thing, it's not a win or lose, it is not a zero-sum game. It is important for us as Americans and as Indians, the more we put into this relationship, the more we will get out (of it). The more we insist on kind of cynical calculations in the place of trusted relationships, the less we will get,\" the ambassador said. He said the US-India relationship is \"wide and it is deeper than it has ever been\" but it is \"not yet deep enough\". But this senator or this member of the Congress concerned about an NGO, concerned about a religious group, concerned about a human rights issue, concerned about a thing that \"sometimes we pretend don't exist, but we must actually confront and find a good language to talk about\", he said. \"If you look at the circles that unite our values, they are not completely concentric, but they mostly overlap, I would say 80-90 per cent,\" the envoy said. Garcetti said \"our heads and hearts are aligned\" but the question is can the two countries \"move the feet together\" and build that continued deep trust and have the outcomes that meet the security threats of this moment. \"Because if we only look inward, neither the US nor India in the Indo-Pacific will keep up with the pace of threats today,\" he said, adding, \"be they, state actors on your border that we are also concerned about, in this region and other regions\", be that climate change and the associated threats that US sees in this country. \"The stakes for our technological innovation together, the stakes for our climate action together, the stakes for our military cooperation have never been higher because pace of change has never been faster,\" Garcetti asserted. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com He described the US-India defence partnership as one which stands \"among the most consequential\" in the world.

    "text": "CES is always full of surprises – after all, it's the event where the tech world shows off its latest and greatest gadgets.\nHowever, one device is turning heads for another reason. As reported by [Sammobile](https://www.sammobile.com/opinion/my-heart-skipped-a-beat-spotting-samsungs-playstation-2-lookalike-at-ces/), a walk past Samsung's CES 2025 stand might lead you to assume the Korean giant has somehow brokered a deal with Sony to relaunch the [PS2](guides/best-ps2-games-of-all-time-playstation-2-titles-you-need-to-play) – but sadly, this isn't the case.\n[As Sammobile writer Mihai Matei explains](https://www.sammobile.com/opinion/my-heart-skipped-a-beat-spotting-samsungs-playstation-2-lookalike-at-ces/):\nWhen I first laid my eyes on the new Samsung Wireless One Connect box, I really thought Samsung brought a PS2 to CES. It almost felt like my brain glitched out and my heart skipped a beat. It took me a moment to realize the absurdity of what I was imagining.\nLooking at the photo, you can forgive Matei's confusion. From a distance, the unit does indeed look a lot like the original PS2 model, right down to the fact that the power LED is located in the same place as the PlayStation logo.\nThe device is actually a lot smaller than Sony's 160 million-selling console, and it goes without saying that it doesn't play [God of War](games/ps2/god_of_war) or [Gran Turismo 3](games/ps2/gran_turismo_3_a-spec); it's designed to reduce the tangle of wires behind your television by using WiFi 7 to stream your HDMI connection to your TV.\nThis year's CES has also seen [Capcom and Bandai Namco join forces](news/2025/01/capcom-and-bandai-namco-are-joining-forces-for-this-massive-handheld) on a new handheld.",

    "title": "Storiaverse pairs writers and animators together to create multimedia stories. It’s partnering with one of TikTok’s biggest animators.",
    "text": "One of the founders of FameBit (which Google acquired and later turned into YouTube BrandConnect ) has launched a new app that pairs writers and animators together to create what it calls a “read-watch” experience in storytelling.\nStoriaverse , which launched earlier this month, taps writers to submit their works, then matches accepted stories with artists who animate sections of those stories. The end result, with writing and animation combined, lets Storiaverse users swipe up on a story to watch animated clips as they’re reading.\nAgnes Kozera , the aforementioned FameBit co-founder and now co-founder and chief content officer of Storiaverse, says the platform was inspired by “the popularity of graphic novels and shows like Love, Death & Robots ,” which “demonstrate the changing creative landscape and increasing demand for animation among digital natives in adulthood.”\n“We are thrilled to merge animation with exceptional writing to allow writers and animators to unleash their creativity and go beyond the usual boundaries of storytelling solely for younger audiences in traditional formats,” Kozera added.\nStoriaverse has raised $2.5 million in funding so far, and currently has more than 100 creators working on over 100 different story projects. Kozera told TechCrunch that Storiaverse pays both writers and animators, and that compensation “varies based on factors such as length and complexity of the story.”\nStoriaverse is also considering increasing creator monetization by running ads, including product placement, and offering merch and subscriptions, Kozera said.\nOne of the creators currently working with Storiaverse is King Science , an animator who has 13.5 million followers on TikTok . He partnered with Storiaverse and, according to the platform, plans to debut the cartoon version of himself he animates on TikTok in a “longer, more immersive format” that’ll be exclusive to Storiaverse.\n“As an independent animator, I’m eager to captivate audiences in new ways and explore creating longer-form animation content that gets into the heart of storytelling, and Storiaverse offers that opportunity,” King Science said in a statement. “It has been so fun to write and animate my own story for the unique read-watch format and I can’t wait for my fans to dive into this immersive experience. What truly resonates with me is the platform’s easy-to-work-with team and the creative freedom to champion my ideas. I think Storiaverse will make a positive impact on the animation community and give fans a totally new way to experience storytelling. I’m excited to launch my story in the app soon!”\nStoriaverse says it’s looking to secure partnerships with more content creators like King Science.\nthe meantime, it launched with a handful of fully completed stories, including:\nA Night at the Park – A suspenseful mystery about two fugitives who try to take shelter in the wrong house, written by John M. Floyd , the award-winning author of more than 1,000 short stories in publications like Alfred Hitchcock’s Mystery Magazine and The Best American Mystery Stories. Animated by Josh Ryba , a writer, director and animator who has worked on projects such as Ridley Scott’s Netflix series Raised by Wolves.\nThe End of the West – An exciting Western where the line between predator and prey becomes blurred, written by Maxim Loskutoff , an award-winning novelist who has been published by The New York Times. Animated by Shahab Serwaty , a story art and 2D animation artist who has worked on TV series, films, music videos, board games, and graphic novels.\nThe Kelpie – An inspiring fantasy about a young witch’s courage, transformation, and magic, written by queer, working-class Scottish writer Lindz McLeod and animated by Jonathan Fontaine, who has worked on movies including Disney’s Descendants and Paramount’s Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank.\nA Last Taste – A wild sci-fi story about the space heist of a lifetime, written by novelist Lyndsay Ely , who has contributed to books in the video game-inspired “Overwatch” series. Animated by Michael Winn , an animation instructor at Detroit’s The College for Creative Studies who has worked on projects for Warner Brothers and Sony.\n(Descriptions provided by Storiaverse.)\nYou can check Storiaverse out here . It’s looking for story submissions from writers and portfolio submissions from animators.",

    "text": "Actualizada 12 JUN 2025 - 18:43 El presidente ruso Vladímir Putin ordenó a sus tropas invadir la vecina Ucrania el 24 de febrero de 2022. Desde entonces, la guerra sigue anclada en el este de Europa. Sigue al minuto las últimas noticias del avance militar de Rusia y de la respuesta de Kiev. Estados Unidos impulsa vías para alcanzar el fin de la guerra. La tregua está más cerca.\nActualizar 12 JUN 2025 - 18:43\nUcrania busca cambiar el rumbo de la guerra mientras Rusia avanza pese a sus altas bajas A pesar de que Kiev calcula que las bajas rusas han superado el millón de soldados heridos y muertos en más de tres años de invasión, las tropas de Moscú mantienen la presión en el frente mientras Ucrania busca aumentar las bajas rusas y socavar su capacidad ofensiva.\nLos analistas ucranianos sostienen que la estrategia rusa de \"sacrificar\" un gran número de tropas a cambio de mínimas ganancias territoriales es militarmente poco sólida y esperan que eventualmente desestabilice la sociedad rusa.\nSin embargo, los dirigentes rusos parecen creer que pueden sostener más de 1.280 bajas diarias mientras Ucrania se enfrenta a sus propias limitaciones y espera una ayuda más rápida de sus socios.\n12 JUN 2025 - 17:19\nEl Kremlin considera \"noticia muy positiva\" la felicitación de Rubio en el Día de Rusia El Kremlin calificó hoy como \" una noticia muy positiva \" la felicitación del secretario de Estado de EE.UU., Marco Rubio, a los rusos por su Día Nacional, festividad instaurada tras la caída de la Unión Soviética.\n\"Es una noticia muy positiva. Demuestra una vez más que la actual Administración en Washington es completamente diferente a la anterior Administración de (Joe) Biden\", dijo Dmitri Peskov, portavoz presidencial, al canal de Telegram del conocido periodista Pável Zarubin.\nAunque admitió que, aún existen \" una gran cantidad de discrepancias, que siempre las hubo y las habrá entre nuestros países, de todas formas la Administración (del presidente Donald Trump) aboga por la solución de los problemas a través del diálogo\".\n12 JUN 2025 - 16:12\nAlivio, esperanza, gratitud y angustia: cómo vuelven a Ucrania los cautivos en Rusia Al escuchar las sirenas del convoy en el que vuelven a casa los prisioneros de guerra ucranianos, decenas de familiares de combatientes desaparecidos alzan los carteles con las fotos de sus seres queridos, se ponen de puntillas y se preparan para el milagro que esperan desde hace meses.\nLos más afortunados podrán abrazarse a su s hijos, hermanos, maridos, hijos y esposos , mientras que otro grupo con menos suerte escuchará al fin de uno de los cautivos liberados que su familiar está vivo y aguarda a ser canjeado entre torturas y humillaciones en Rusia.\nPara la mayoría, sin embargo, cada intercambio significa una nueva decepción y la prolongación de la espera.\n12 JUN 2025 - 14:39\nZelenski dice que el millón de bajas rusas \"es el precio que Putin está dispuesto a pagar\" por \"fantasías\" El presidente de Ucrania, Volodimir Zelenski, ha señalado este jueves que el millón de bajas sufridas por el Ejército de Rusia desde el inicio de la invasión, según el recuento de Kiev, \"es el precio que (el presidente ruso, Vladimir) Putin está dispuesto a pagar por sus enfermas fantasías geopolíticas\". \"Aún así, se niega a poner fin a esta guerra\", ha apuntado Zelenski que ha agregado que \"Rusia no se preocupa realmente por la vida de millones de sus propios ciudadanos, pero sí lo hace por las sanciones duras, especialmente su petróleo y finanzas, así como por su aislamiento político cuando Moscú no es invitado a foros internacionales\".\n12 JUN 2025 - 12:03\nMilei reitera su apoyo a Israel en la Universidad de Jerusalén, entre vítores y protestas El presidente de Argentina, Javier Milei, reafirmó este jueves en Jerusalén los lazos estrechos entre su país e Israel, durante una visita a la Universidad Hebrea, donde fue recibido con vítores de estudiantes y la protesta de algunos manifestantes propalestinos. \"Fui claro en la política internacional, me declaré a favor de la paz, a favor del libre comercio y desde el primer momento definí claramente quiénes eran o quiénes yo pretendía que fueran mis aliados\", afirmó Milei durante una conferencia en el auditorio de la universidad, ante un público compuesto por estudiantes y profesores. \"Y esos aliados que yo dije que iba a pasar son los Estados Unidos e Israel\", añadió.\n12 JUN 2025 - 11:55\nEl ministro de Defensa alemán niega en Kiev que Moscú tenga interés en la paz con Ucrania El ministro de Defensa de Alemania, Boris Pistorius, que realiza una visita sorpresa este jueves en Kiev, denunció que Moscú no tiene interés en alcanzar la paz en la guerra ruso-ucraniania, como demuestran los últimos ataques de Rusia contra el país del presidente Volodímir Zelenski. \"Con esa gran cantidad de ataques con drones y misiles se deja una señal clara de Moscú: no hay interés en una solución pacífica\", dijo Pistorius a su llegada a la capital ucraniana, donde tendrá varias reuniones con responsables del Ejecutivo de Zelenski para abordar, entre otras cosas, la ayuda a Kiev frente a la invasión rusa. Pistorius manifestó que los últimos ataques rusos, en los que las tropas del presidente de Rusia, Vladímir Putin, han empleado cientos de drones y misiles contra lo que el político alemán calificó de \"creciente número de zonas civiles\", deben \"fortalecer el apoyo decidido a Ucrania\".\n12 JUN 2025 - 9:36\nZelenski teme que Rusia esté engañando a Trump, que sigue acercándose al Kremlin El presidente ucraniano, Volodímir Zelenski, ha declarado en una entrevista concedida al diario alemán Bild, antes de viajar a Canadá para participar en la cumbre del G7, que teme que Rusia le esté \"mintiendo\" al presidente de EEUU, Donald Trump, acerca de sus verdaderas intenciones sobre la guerra. \"Creo que Rusia está mintiendo a Trump, esa es mi opinión, y la mayoría de jefes de Estado y de Gobierno comparten mi opinión\", dijo Zelenski, que espera reunirse en la cumbre con el presidente de EEUU para seguir intentando convencerle de que dicte medidas económicas punitivas contra Rusia para forzarla a declarar el alto el fuego que piden Kiev y sus socios y que también le ha reclamado sin éxito Washington. La publicación de la entrevista de Zelenski con Bild coincide con la felicitación a los rusos del secretario de Estado de EEUU, Marco Rubio, con motivo del Día de Rusia, en un nuevo paso simbólico a la normalización de las relaciones de Washington y Moscú pese a la falta de voluntad que está mostrando el presidente ruso, Vladímir Putin, de poner fin a la guerra como le pide Trump.\n12 JUN 2025 - 8:00\nUcrania dice que bajas rusas, entre muertos y heridos, han superado el millón desde 2022 El ministro de Asuntos Exteriores ucraniano, Andrí Sibiga, afirmó este jueves que el número de bajas rusas ha superado el millón, entre muertos y heridos, en los casi tres años y medio desde que empezó la guerra en febrero de 2022. \"Un millón perdido para nada: Rusia no ha alcanzado ni uno solo de los objetivos estratégicos de sus objetivos a gran escala. Y no lo hará\", aseguró Sibiga en la red social X. El ministro subrayó que Ucrania no comenzó la guerra y quiere \"más que nadie\" que termine, pero que Rusia está obstaculizando todos los intentos para llegar a una solución negociada del conflicto, rechazando la propuesta de Kiev de un alto el fuego y de una reunión a nivel de presidentes. \"Hay que incrementar la presión sobre el agresor\", reclamó.\n12 JUN 2025 - 7:30\nAl menos 14 heridos en un nuevo ataque nocturno ruso contra Járkov Al menos 14 civiles resultaron heridos este jueves en un ataque nocturno con drones rusos contra la ciudad de Járkov, en el noreste de Ucrania, y la segunda más grande del país después de Kiev, un día después de que murieran tres personas y otras 60 fueran heridas en circunstancias similares. \"Por la noche, el enemigo atacó Járkov con drones. Se produjeron incendios en los distritos de Saltivski, Slobodski y Shevchenkivski de la ciudad; ardieron viviendas, locales comerciales y coches. 14 personas fueron heridas, incluidos cuatro niños\", informaron los servicios de emergencia del Estado en Telegram. Las labores de rescate y de apagado de incendios todavía continúan.\n11 JUN 2025 - 14:59\nSistema de misiles antiaéreos Patriot Rusia afirmó este miércoles haber recibido aclaraciones de lsrael acerca del supuesto envío de un sistema de misiles antiaéreos Patriot a Ucrania, que le permiten desmentir esta información. \"Hemos recibido aclaraciones del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Israel que indican que estas declaraciones no se corresponden con la realidad\", señaló en rueda de prensa la portavoz del Ministerio de Exteriores de Rusia, María Zajárova.",
