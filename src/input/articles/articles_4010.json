    "text": "Une récente mise à jour d'Android Auto a provoqué des bugs de contraste dans l'interface du système. Le problème semble provenir du côté de Google, et non des utilisateurs, ce qui le rend impossible à régler de manière définitive tant qu'un correctif n'est pas déployé.\nCrédit : Thehazzawitty / Reddit Android Auto est un système incontournable pour accéder à des fonctions connectées et intelligentes directement depuis l'écran de bord de son véhicule. Mais depuis une récente mise à jour, de nombreux utilisateurs se plaignent d'un bug d'interface . Les couleurs sont devenues délavées et les noirs sont devenus des gris très pâles, détériorant fortement l'expérience. Ce problème de contraste paraît impossible à régler du côté de l'utilisateur en essayant de régler les paramètres d'affichage.\nSur Reddit, les témoignages affluent. “Tout est tellement flou maintenant, comme si quelqu'un avait poussé le contraste. C'est tellement moche que la première fois que je l'ai vu, j'ai cru que mon écran était en panne” , fait savoir un utilisateur, photo à l'appui. “J'ai également remarqué un glissement des noirs vers le gris sur Android Auto dans ma Ford Puma. En revanche, je n'ai pas constaté de contraste accru sur les autres couleurs. Je pensais donc que c'était un mauvais choix de Google de remplacer les fonds noirs par des fonds gris” , explique un autre.\nUne interface au contraste déréglé dans Android Auto Certains recommandent de désactiver l'option “Utiliser le fond d'écran du téléphone” dans Android Auto pour obtenir un retour à la normale, estimant qu'il peut s'agir d'une mauvaise interaction avec le design Material You d'Android. Mais cette solution ne semble pas fonctionner chez les utilisateurs victimes de ce souci.\n“J'ai moi aussi ce problème depuis des mois. Je ne comprends pas vraiment pourquoi tout le monde rencontre soudainement le même problème” , rapporte un conducteur, qui précise qu'en vidant les données ou le cache de l'application Android Auto, le problème disparaissait temporairement.\nGoogle n'a pas encore réagi, mais on espère qu'un correctif sera vite publié pour qu'Android Auto retrouve de son éclat. En attendant, pour tenter d'apaiser quelque peu votre frustration avec le système, nous vous proposons de consulter notre sélection des cinq applications indispensables d'Android Auto pour transformer vos trajets en voiture .",

    "title": "Colorado police department implements the 4-day work week — with great success",
    "text": "A police department in Golden, Colorado, recently transitioned to a 32-hour workweek — a significant shift from the traditional longer hours associated with law enforcement. This change has been met with surprise by many within the department, as the concept of a reduced workweek was previously unfathomable in this profession.\nThe trend towards shorter workweeks has gained momentum globally, especially as remote work has become more prevalent, allowing for increased flexibility. While some labor groups have pushed for a four-day workweek during negotiations, this particular police department’s adjustment to a condensed schedule posed several challenges but also presented an opportunity to test the feasibility of such a change across various job roles within the city’s workforce.\nCity officials held community meetings to address concerns about the new schedule, emphasizing that the expectation was not for employees to work less but rather to maintain or increase productivity within fewer hours. They aimed to ensure that service levels would remain consistent or improve despite the reduced hours.\nEmployees, including those in investigative roles, initially found the adjustment to be stressful, having to condense their workload into fewer days. However, many reported improvements in focus and productivity, as well as personal well-being thanks to an extra day off each week dedicated to family and personal time, according to\nCNN Business.\nPublic sentiment toward the shortened workweek has been positive, with high satisfaction scores from employees and no negative feedback from the community. The pilot program is being closely monitored for its effects on productivity and efficiency, with personal assessments forming an integral part of the evaluation.\nAs well as improving current staff well-being, the new work schedule is seen as a potential advantage in recruiting and retaining personnel in a field that has faced challenges in these areas. One new officer cited the shortened workweek as a motivating factor for joining the department, hoping it becomes a permanent feature.\nShould the pilot prove successful, it may be expanded to include all city employees, though adjustments might vary based on role and responsibilities.\nCNN",

    "text": "Hamada Fara'neh, a Palestinian-Jordanian journalist and author who is also a member of the Palestinian National Council, recently published an an article titled \"They Stole Christianity from Us\" in the Jordanian daily Al-Dustour and the Palestinian daily Al-Quds. In the article he claimed that Jesus, who was born in Bethlehem and lived in Palestine, was a Palestinian and that the West stole Christianity from the Palestinians, just as it later stole Palestine itself and settled it with Jews. This, he said, is why the West and its churches support Israel and do not come out against the crimes it commits against the Palestinian people. He added that, just as Jesus – who was the first Palestinian fida'i (self-sacrificing fighter) and an emblem of sacrifice for the sake of others – was crucified as a result of a pact between Judas Iscariot and the Roman colonialists, the Palestinians people are now victims of a pact between Israel and the colonialist West, headed by the U.S. It should be noted that this is not the first time Palestinians draw a link between Jesus and the Palestinian national struggle. [[1]](https://www.memri.org/reports/palestinian-jordanian-journalist-west-stole-christianity-us-just-it-stole-palestine-jesus#_edn1) Hamada Fara'neh (Image: Alqalahnews.net) The following are translated excerpts from Fara'neh's article: [[2]](https://www.memri.org/reports/palestinian-jordanian-journalist-west-stole-christianity-us-just-it-stole-palestine-jesus#_edn2) \"Jesus was not a Roman but a Palestinian. He was born in Bethlehem, his divine revelation and his resurrection occurred in Palestine, and he was baptized in the Jordan River, for Jordan-Palestine was his homeland and the homeland of his disciples and his message. SUPPORT OUR WORK \"He was not a European from Moscow or London, or from anywhere else outside out region, although his message transcends borders and his followers come from every nation and continent – just as Islam transcends borders and nations, and its followers are not confined to the Arabian Peninsula but come from all over the Arab world and every continent: from Asia through Africa to Europe and America. Religion has no homeland; it spreads in an effort to embrace all of human existence, for it is a divine message to human beings everywhere. \"The West stole Christianity from us, from our people, just as it did with Palestine, which was openly stolen by British imperialism. [This was done] by means of the Balfur Declaration, so as to bring all the foreign Jews together, help them emigrate [to Palestine] and settle them by force in the Palestinians' land at the Palestinians' expense. But no matter how large and strong the Israeli colony becomes, it will never be entitled to steal [the Palestinians' land] – as long as the Palestinian people remain alive and productive, its women remain fertile and its men remain willing to act, sacrifice and cleave to their homeland, their honor and their rights, which cannot be made to evaporate or be forgotten and do not expire with time. \"They [the Westerners] stole the Christian religion from our land, just as they stole Palestine [itself], and that is why they have not come out against the horrific violent takeover, the killing and the destruction [wreaked by Israel against the Palestinian] people and the residents of the cities, villages and neighborhoods of the Gaza Strip. [The Israelis] did this before, in 1948, but without being scrutinized, filmed and monitored. They inherited this behavior from their predecessors, for they did to the Palestinians what Tsarist Russia, German Nazism and Italian Fascism did to them. \"They [the Westerners] stole the Christian religion from us, and that is why the patriarchs and archbishops [of the Western churches] have not stood up against what the [military] forces of the [Israeli] colony are doing to the Christians and Muslims in Palestine, the land of Jesus. And this is despite the fact that the three Palestinian churches – the Church of the Nativity [in Bethlehem], the Church of the Annunciation [in Nazareth] and the Church of the Sepulcher [in Jerusalem] – are lamenting along with their people and their worshippers in Palestine, for their people, churches, schools, hospitals and family homes are in Gaza. His Holiness the Pope confirmed this in his Christmas message, which addressed the horrors of the heavy disaster that the Palestinian people are experiencing at the hands of the Israeli imperialists. \"The Palestinian people is facing death, murder, execution and destruction, along with starvation, shortage and the loss of the right to life. The churches of London and Moscow and their branches do not feel the pain and suffering of the Palestinian Christians and Muslims. \"Christmas, the festival [marking] the birth of Jesus – who was the first Palestinian and first fida'i, characterized by sacrifice, altruism and an untimely death – [will be marked this year] without joy, because the Palestinian people are being crucified in their own homeland, just like Jesus [was crucified] because of a pact between the Roman imperialism of his era and the treason of Judas Iscariot. Today, too, the cruelty, racism, fascism, and disgraceful actions of the [Israeli] colony [are met with] treason against the values of humanity by those who support [Israel], stand with it, help it, lend it political backing and protect it from accountability. This is what the U.S. administration did when it provided Israel with 230 cargo planes and 30 cargo vessels [loaded with] weapons, bombs and means of destruction. [These weapons are now] killing the Palestinians, both Christians and Muslims, who honor [Christ], the Messenger of Love and Peace, just as they love all the messengers and prophets, chief of them [Muhammad], the Messenger and Prophet of the Muslims.\" [[1]](https://www.memri.org/reports/palestinian-jordanian-journalist-west-stole-christianity-us-just-it-stole-palestine-jesus#_ednref1) See e.g., MEMRI Special Dispatch 9135, [Palestinian Authority Commemorates, Glorifies Terrorists In 'Martyr Day' Events; Article In PA Daily: Jesus Was The First Palestinian Martyr](https://www.memri.org/reports/palestinian-authority-commemorates-glorifies-terrorists-martyr-day-events-article-pa-daily), January 12, 2021.

    "text": "LAND O' LAKES, Fla — Changes with Humana TRICARE, the primary healthcare program used by active duty military, have left some local military families fighting for their medical reimbursements.\nA 10 Tampa Bay media affiliate confirmed that on Jan. 1, 2025, Humana Military switched the company it uses for claims processing from WPS Health Insurance to PGBA.\nRetired U.S. Airman Kevin Sellers dutifully tracks his wife's medical expenses. Kim Sellers was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2016 and sees multiple doctors at USF Health and through Tampa General.\nKevin Sellers said he had never faced any issues with her TRICARE health insurance until this past January, when a special test was flagged as \"NOT APPROVED,\" leaving them with a nearly $1,500 unexpected bill and many questions.\n\"When I go through it I can't get a whole lot of information about it, it doesn't tell me why,\" Sellers said. \"I submitted the appeal. It should just show up here to show they have the appeal and that they're working on it, but it still shows up as 'not approved.'\"\nSellers also said he's sent several unanswered emails to TRICARE about the issue.\nFlorida Congressman Gus Bilirakis, a state leader in veteran healthcare, is now looking into the situation on behalf of the Sellers family and others who have brought similar issues to his attention.\nBilirakis tells 10 Tampa Bay that TRICARE is undergoing a \"major system transition\" which has delayed their \"usual\" claims processing time frame. Now, he's filing a formal congressional inquiry with TRICARE.\nFor the Sellers family, this is a matter of transparency.\n\"If they need time, or if they need to get systems up in place, then help us, let us know that,\" Sellers said. \"I don't want to spend my days playing hospital administrator, I'd like to spend my days with my wife.\"\n10 Tampa Bay has reached out directly to TRICARE several times this week for comment about its system transition and issues it has caused for patients. We have not yet heard back.",

    "title": "Home prices will fall as 'silver tsunami' of baby boomers to unload fresh housing supply, top Wall Street forecaster says",
    "text": "Home prices will fall as 'silver tsunami' of baby boomers to unload fresh housing supply, top Wall Street forecaster says Meredith Whitney, who called the 2008 crash, said a \"silver tsunami\" will bring more supply of homes to the market. More boomers are looking to downsize as they age, freeing up inventory, Whitney told Yahoo Finance. \"You're going to see existing home prices come down.\" Boomers are growing older, and they'll start downsizing their homes at a quicker pace — and that's great news for the housing market, one expert says. Meredith Whitney, known for calling the 2008 housing crash, said that aging boomers will bring a wave of supply to the market by freeing up inventory as they shift to smaller houses. \"Another major demographic trend you see is the aging of America, what's called the 'silver tsunami', is 10,000 people a day turning 65, and by 2030, the entire baby boomer generation will be over 65,\" Whitney [told Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/silver-tsunami-reshape-housing-market-180931282.html) on Thursday. \"That'll be 20% of the US population.\" That trend will help bring prices down, as more homes on the market will soften the impact of housing demand, which is a big change compared to the past few years during which a massive supply crunch has helped push [housing prices to all-time highs](https://www.businessinsider.com/housing-market-outlook-home-prices-2024-mortgage-rates-fed-cuts-2023-12?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com). But more homes seem to be [coming to the market](https://www.businessinsider.com/housing-market-outlook-construction-starts-homes-prices-mortgage-rates-builders-2023-12?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), though the trend varies by region. \"You're going to see more affordable housing being created by new home builders, and you're going to see existing home prices come down,\" Whitney said. While home prices are still perched at high levels, mortgage rates are also at multi-year highs, although they have been sliding lower over the past month. This week, DoubleLine Capital said that a 5% rate is the [\"magic number\" that could allow prices to drop.](https://www.businessinsider.com/mortgage-rates-magic-number-housing-market-home-prices-homeowners-inventory-2023-12?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com) \"If you lower the overall home price, the serviceability becomes more affordable,\" Whitney said. \"That's what I think is invariably going to happen because you're going to have more seniors, the silver tsunami, selling and there are fewer buyers so the give is going to be lower home prices.\" As for now, Whitney said she would advise Millennials to wait before buying, while she would advise boomers to sell.
