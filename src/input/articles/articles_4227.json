    "text": "Ecuador, Indigenous group reach deal to end oil field blockade December 30, 2023 at 10:05 pm EST Share QUITO, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Ecuador has reached an agreement with an Indigenous community in the country's Orellana province to end the group's blockade of oil projects in the area, the ministry of energy and mining said on Saturday.\nProtests by the Waorani Kawymeno community that blocked access to the Ishpingo oil field in Orellana impacted output from the site starting on Monday and prompted state-run oil producer Petroecuador to declare a force majeure on the operations on Friday.\nThe protests in Orellana had cut oil output at Ishpingo by about 17,000 barrels per day.\nA force majeure is the legal term for when a company cannot meet its contractual obligations because of acts beyond its control.\nAfter \"arduous conversations\" with the Waorani Kawymeno, the ministry said a deal was reached that would restart drilling at Ishpingo over the next three days, though wells would start operating Saturday and thereby the force majeure would be lifted.\nThe ministry statement acknowledged that public works promised to the community by previous administrations had not been carried out.\nThe ministry vowed to mobilize machinery to start land clearing works, provide an internet connection for the community as well as deliver kits with food, awnings, blankets and medicine.\n\"We assume responsibility for correcting these omissions and ensuring that each community receives the attention and resources it deserves,\" the ministry said in the statement.\nIn the past, Indigenous organizations have led protests that paralyzed the South American country for nearly two weeks as they attempted to stop extractive activities near their communities.

    "title": "Live Review: Korn, Gojira and Spirtbox at Ameris Bank Amphitheatre",
    "text": "Words by Gordon Lamb and photographs by Mike White\nEven though Los Angeles-via-Bakersfield, CA’s Korn has been through Georgia multiple times over the past 30 years, including one notable stop in Athens back in 1997, the only other time I’d seen them before this night was at the Phillips Arena on Apr. 13, 2000. That’s both a show I saw by convenient accident as well as a date I had to actually look up because I couldn’t remember. This night on Monday, Sept. 16 in Alpharetta, they were on their 30th anniversary tour. When I first saw them way back when, that was my first real exposure to what was really being sold to the most diagnosed and medicated ADD generation yet. From the first note of the first opener to the last note of Korn’s headlining set, the entire arena remained darkened while incredibly violent and disturbing cartoons were displayed on a huge stage screen. The intensity never let up and only got more and more tightly wound. By the time Korn took the stage the crowd was, kinda rightfully so, ready to explode.\nThis night out in the suburbs, things were decidedly more relaxed, but even then still very far from what one might call a picnic. Korn is currently on tour with France’s Gojira, who the man on the street may only know from their performance during this Summer’s Olympic opening ceremonies in Paris, but who have been thrilling metal fans for nearly as long as Korn itself. They also brought along Canadian band Spiritbox, and since Mike White was nice enough to shoot this entire show, I promised him I’d mention these folks who I had not planned on covering at all. So, let’s get that out of the way.\nMike White Spiritbox The moment singer Courtney LaPlante mentioned how glad they were to be on tour with the other two bands she said, and I’m paraphrasing here, “Every note of music we play wouldn’t exist without those guys!” And I suppose that’s a cool way to say thanks except, good Lord, I’d hate to be accused of being an influence on Spiritbox. There’s just no way to categorize their particular style of melodic-metal-death growl pastiche other than to call it Pro Tools rock. Everything they played sounded like it came from a sound bank and was just pieced together by a producer. Yes, they were as polite onstage as a group of Disney concierges, but with a lot less personality. If Mike had been shooting on actual film, I would have mourned the money he wasted.\nMike White Gojira Now, Gojira cleaned house quickly, efficiently and with a mighty wave of its fist. This was my second time seeing the band in the past 18 months. Opening with 2012’s “L’Enfant Sauvage,” it was as if Gojira was purifying the stage with fire. Enormous bursts of flames, shaped more like rockets that mushrooms, went off continuously and were timed perfectly to the beat. It was a lot cooler than I’m making it sound because I don’t know that many ways to describe stage pyrotechnics. Then they reached even further back to 2008’s “Toxic Garbage Island,” and the band’s technical metal skills came right out front. As best I can tell, Gojira first played in Georgia as the first act on a four-band bill at The Masquerade almost exactly 17 years ago (i.e. October 2007). Now, I’ve seen ’em twice and, this honestly very rarely happens, wish I’d seen them at many more of these occasions when they came through our area.\nI was excited to see Korn, and that’s a sentence I never really imagined I would write, but my anticipation grew over the few hours from arrival to the band’s set time. Korn has steadily released music their entire career, and this tour was no mere nostalgia-based cash grab. The band has release 14 studio albums in the past 30 years and is still writing and recording. By comparison, R.E.M. released 15 studio albums in its 31-year career. I don’t know if I really want to write a sentence that purports that R.E.M. is about to be lapped by Korn, but I certainty have one in mind. Like I said, this was no oldies tour but Korn didn’t offer anything created relatively recently until their seventh song when they played “Start The Healing” from 2022’s Requiem .\nMike White Korn Before then, they came out onstage with “Here To Stay” and then worked strongly and confidently through “Dead Bodies Everywhere,” “Got The Life,” “A.D.I.D.A.S.,” “Hey Daddy” and “Good God.” The next most recent song was 2016’s “Insane,” but even that wasn’t played until they’d caught up with their gathered people and had played “Blind.” “Ball Tongue,” “Clown,” “Shoots And Ladders,” “Twist” and “Make Me Bad” were played. They then finished out their primary set with the now 20-year-old “Y’all Want A Single.” Before they launched into it, they had the crowd put both middle fingers in the air and prepare themselves for the sing-along chorus’ refrain of “Y’all want a single, say fuck that (fuck that)/ Fuck that, fuck that (fuck that).” OK, so it’s not Wordsworth, but it’s one of the most poignant, direct-to-fans criticism of media consolidation, the then-current prohibitive costs associated with music video promotion, the music industry’s persistent and demanding knee on the neck of all artists including the most successful, the major label system as a whole and corporate rock radio. Yeah, it’s not polite, but I’ve never seen a crowd as fully responsive to this stance as I did this night. Not even during the most hardcore of punk shows I’ve ever been to. But this wasn’t, say, a Rage Against The Machine-type stance which, for better or worse, always seemed to come from a learned place of intellectual reflection and analysis, no matter how aggressively delivered. Korn is much more down to earth. Like its namesake crop, it’s literally in the dirt, and this song doesn’t take a reflective role at all. It’s a defiant burst of anger from the band directed at the hands that both fed it and juiced it. The industry that always has one hand in its artist’s pocket while the other hand is making a peace sign. And I do believe that’s the only use I’ll ever have for an Alanis Morisette lyric.\nThey even played fun with the audience for a few minutes before they came out for an expected encore. On their stage screens, they kept asking for more noise, teased the crowd for several minutes that they weren’t loud enough, etc. It was really corny, pun intended, and both the band and crowd were in on the joke. Then they came out and finished up with a three-song blast of “Falling Away From Me,” “Oildale (Leave Me Alone)” and the highly anticipated “Freak On A Leash.” Missing only one original member, but lacking for nothing onstage, Korn was charged up, engaging and still prepared to go the live distance.\nMike White Korn But, you know, no matter how much I’d come around to these dudes this night and honestly enjoyed their set, there’s still no way this music was made for guys like me. You know, snobs. When the group first appeared on anyone’s radar outside decades ago, they were simultaneously cheered and mocked for being the folks who, for all practical purposes, invented that then-new genre of nu metal. At the time, it was like Kurt Cobain had just died, and then all of the sudden here come these upstart kids who 1.) have no roots in the punk/hardcore or even basic alternative scene, and how the hell do they have a record deal already? and 2.) they don’t even seem to respect metal—as it was then understood—well enough to play by its rules. The music press at large, and in the underground, had a great time getting a good laugh out of these funny boys who weren’t really upsetting the apple cart, so to speak, but completely sidestepping it as if it didn’t exist. They went directly to their fans and stayed on the road basically until they went platinum and then stayed on the road some more. Their loyal followers were also roundly made fun of at the time. They were essentially treated like they were hard rock juggalos whose entire culture was born at some mystical three-way intersection between Walmart, Hot Topic and Tractor Supply. Now they’re all solidly middle-aged, and many had brought along their kids to the show.\nA few days ago my friend Paul Nunn, former Athens musician with several bands, posted a statement about how he had overheard someone mocking The Bee-Gees and disco in general, and this caused him to say, “It made me wonder what weird programmed hangups I could stand to take a second look at in 2024.” This was on the day after I saw this show, and it got to me because he’s right.\nMike White Korn At its elemental level, away from scene politics, rules, fashion, etc. there’s so much about Korn’s music that is only ignored because of its messenger. I’m willing to bet any honest person 20 bucks to tell me convincingly that if Jonathan Davis’ nonsense, guttural scatting were delivered by, say, Swans Michael Gira that there wouldn’t be a positive NPR review of it. Further, if JG Thirwell (Clint Ruin, Foetus, et al.) had scraped out the same type of sometimes noodle-y guitar punctuated with the exact same metal riffing, it would be noted positively in his extensive discography.\nI dunno, man. I guess my point is that sometimes you have to ask yourself if what you think is bullshit is really only such because you’re not really its audience. That, of course, cannot be entirely true because that stance gives a free pass to anything outside your own specific wheelhouse and reduces an audience down to being merely a target market. But there is most definitely something to be said about ingrained biases, judging the messenger, and—especially among those of us who have voluntarily subjected the world to our non-stop opinions for years—refusal to allow for any similarity or connection between what we hold as important cultural markers and that which is smirked at as low-brow and less-than.\nI was never a huge fan of Korn, and I’m still not really. But after tonight, I feel like I finally better understand where they’ve always been coming from and look forward to catching them again.\nSpiritbox Mike White Mike White Mike White Gojira Mike White Mike White Mike White Mike White Mike White Mike White Korn Mike White Mike White Mike White Mike White Mike White Mike White Mike White Mike White Mike White",

    "title": "Die Stadt der Kanäle - und Taschendiebe",
    "text": "Man hätte gewarnt sein können. Die Hinweistafeln hängen ja in der ganzen Stadt, am Bahnhof Santa Lucia, auf dem Markusplatz, an den Vaporetto-Anlegestellen, und das in allen möglichen Sprachen. „Attenzione borseggiatori“. „Attention pickpockets“. „Beware pickpockets“. Und „Achtung Taschendiebe“ selbstverständlich auch. Aber dann ist das Portemonnaie halt doch nicht mehr in der Hosentasche. So geht es in Venedig ein paar Dutzend Urlaubern jeden Tag. Was das Delikt Taschendiebstahl in der Kriminalitätsstatistik angeht, kann die italienische Lagunenstadt mit ihren nicht einmal mehr 50.000 Einwohnern locker mit Millionenmetropolen mithalten. Vor allem jetzt in der Hauptsaison: Die täglich bis zu 150.000 Besucher aus aller Welt versprechen lohnende Beute. In den engen Gassen sind keineswegs nur Kleinkriminelle aktiv, sondern richtige Banden: Männer, Frauen, Kinder. Und auch sie kommen in der Regel von außerhalb, Tagesbesucher sozusagen. Nun ist das Problem mit den geklauten Geldbörsen in Venedig nicht ganz neu. Die Lokalzeitung „Il Gazzettino“ klagte schon 1961: „Nessun giorno senza ladri“ („Kein Tag ohne Diebe“). Mit dem zunehmenden Tourismus ist es inzwischen aber so schlimm geworden, dass Bürgermeister Luigi Brugnaro jetzt einen Hilferuf an Regierung und Parlament in Rom richtet - was die Venezianer mit ihrem in mehr als anderthalb Jahrtausenden angesammelten Stolz eher ungern tun. Er fordert dringend härtere Gesetze. Einen Eindruck, wie groß das Problem inzwischen ist, bekommt man im Polizeirevier gegenüber dem Markusdom. Dort gibt es einen Raum mit 15 schwarzen Säcken voller Taschen und Brieftaschen - allein die Fundstücke aus den vergangenen anderthalb Monaten. In der Regel werfen die Diebe ihre Beute weg, wenn sie das Bargeld und die Kreditkarten herausgenommen haben. An Ausweispapieren sind sie wenig interessiert. Man findet die Portemonnaies dann auf dem Pflaster, in Briefkästen, in Gärten oder auch in den Kanälen. Längst handelt es sich dabei um organisierte Kriminalität, das Werk von Banden. Meist sind es Leute vom Festland, aus Städten wie Mailand, die für ihr kriminelles Tagwerk nach Venedig gebracht werden, manchmal eigens in Kleinbussen. Inzwischen werden sogar Kinder im Alter von 12 oder 13 Jahren erwischt - gerade noch unter 14, der Altersgrenze für Strafbarkeit. Man nennt sie „baby borseggiatori“: „Baby-Taschendiebe“. Auf Italienisch klingt das natürlich besser und harmloser. Meist kommen sie nach ein paar Stunden auf dem Revier am selben Tag wieder frei. Als besonders gefährliche Gegenden gelten Santa Lucia, wo die Züge vom Festland ankommen, der Busbahnhof an der Piazzale Roma, die Anlegestellen der Gondeln und sonstigen Boote sowie die engen Gassen zwischen Rialtobrücke und Markusplatz. Manchmal ist dort in diesen Tagen kaum noch ein Durchkommen. Im dichten Gedränge haben Taschendiebe leichtes Spiel. Zwar hat die Stadt mehr als 850 Überwachungskameras aufhängen lassen. Die Aufnahmen laufen auf einer der vielen Inseln in einem Kontrollraum zusammen, der rund um die Uhr besetzt ist. Aber bis die Beamten da sind, ist es oft zu spät. Außerdem, und das sorgt aktuell für enorm Ärger, ist die Gefahr, ins Gefängnis zu müssen, auch für erwischte Diebe nicht hoch. Polizeichef Marco Agostini klagte diese Woche in der Tageszeitung „Corriere della Sera“ über eine „große Blase der Straflosigkeit“. „Weil Taschendiebstähle nur auf Anzeige hin verfolgt werden können. Und wenn der Beraubte nicht zur Verhandlung erscheint, gilt die Anzeige als fallengelassen.“ Die meisten Opfer sind Ausländer. Viele reisen am selben Tag wieder ab. So kommt es nur selten zum Prozess. Derzeit sitzen wegen Taschendiebstählen in Venedig gerade einmal vier Häftlinge ein. Bürgermeister Brugnaro forderte die Politik in Rom deshalb in einem landesweit verbreiteten Appell auf, die Gesetze zu verschärfen. Eine vor einiger Zeit verabschiedete Reform, wonach zahlreiche kleinere Delikte nur noch auf Antrag der Geschädigten verfolgt werden, will er rückgängig machen. Bislang gab es jedoch nur einige kleinere Änderungen; beim Taschendiebstahl blieb alles beim Alten. „Wir dürfen uns nicht daran gewöhnen, dass solche Delikte zum Alltag gehören“, so der Bürgermeister.",

    "text": "South Bend vigil group prays for less gun violence in 2024 SOUTH BEND, Ind. -- There are promising signs in South Bend’s fight against gun violence, but still plenty of work to be done. Through November, South Bend police recorded 18 fatal shootings this year, according to the department’s crime dashboard, though that number will go up once December numbers are included. It’s slightly lower than the city’s average of 22 fatal shootings over the last three years. However, the significant change is total victims, including non-fatal shootings. There were 73 this year through November, compared to 117 over the same period last year according to the crime dashboard, a 60% drop. But that’s still preliminary and doesn’t include December when police have responded to six additional shootings. For every deadly shooting that happens in South Bend, you can expect a small group of community members to be there on-site days or weeks after, with uplifting prayers for the victim and their family. During the last vigil of the year, they also prayed for the gun violence to end going into the new year. “It helps heal,” says Michael Elliott, with the On-Site Prayer Ministry. Elliott has led on-site prayer vigils for 18 years, remembering victims killed, typically victims of gun violence. Thursday was the 25th vigil Elliott has led this year. “And we’re going to start 2024 off with two more,” Elliott says. Elliott and the group prayed in remembrance of thirty-four-year-old Isiah Siggers, who was shot and killed on O'Brien Street earlier this month. His death, happening just 20 minutes after another shooting that killed a 52-year-old woman on Ardmore Trail. The two tragedies add to the 18 fatal shootings the South Bend Police Department recorded through November. Four of them were children. “The ones with the children, those are the hardest,” admits Elliott. It’s hard to bear, but Elliot says he knows these vigils help victims’ families move forward. For both vigils held for 11-year-old T’yon Horston and one-year-old Kylin Brooks, Elliott remembers it’s something both families were thankful for. “I think it shows the family that there are people who care, even if we don’t know each other,” says Elliott. He doesn't know if the vigils can help stop gun violence, but he does know it can help heal. “I don’t have any more of an answer than the police chief does, or the mayor,” Elliott says. “Everybody’s working in their own way to try to reduce the violence.” Siggers’ shooting is one of the few that remain unsolved. If you have any information, you're urged to call Michiana Crime Stoppers at 574-288-STOP. All callers can remain anonymous.",
