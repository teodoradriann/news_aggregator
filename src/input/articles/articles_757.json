    "text": "By John Franchi\nClick here for updates on this story\n OGDEN, Utah ( KSTU ) — Cold hard cash gifted to kids for Christmas may have a better use than being spent on the newest video game or stylish new sneakers.\nJust ask 9-year-old Elsa Kate Dees in Ogden who is already earning awards for her stellar saving.\nHigh-yield savings accounts offer about a 5% annual return and dabbling in the stock market can be even more lucrative. The S&P 500 averages about a 10% gain every year.\nWhile investing was once reserved for adults, it’s now accessible to kids under their parent’s supervision.\nElsa doesn’t complain about doing chores as she knows each completed task will earn her a little money from her parents.\nBut instead of running out the door to spend her cash, Elsa has bigger goals in mind.\n“Make sure you save your money instead of just spending it all the time,” she explained to FOX 13 News.\nThe fourth grader saves her money in an app called “Busy Kid.” She did so well with her savings this year that the developers honored her with their “Best of the Best” award for 2023.\n“In a world where finances are in a mess this is exactly what we are trying to do,” explained Gregg Murset, CEO of Busy Kid. “Change the next generation in how they think about this stuff.”\nMurset said the app allows kids to invest their money and use their very own debit card to make purchases with parental approval.\nHe believes that children as young as 5 years old, kindergartners, can learn smart financial habits.\n“If they can learn it early in life, it changes how they think about money, how they deal with their own money and it sets them up for success in the future,” Murset said.\nElsa’s parents have the same mindset, encouraging their daughter to categorize her money into savings, spending and charitable contributions.\n“I hope these principles set in and they stick she can take these her whole life,” reflected Matt Dees, Elsa’s father. “It gives her this great foundation of financial achievements we want to instill in our kids.\nElsa is saving up with her sights set on a trip to Harry Potter’s Wizarding World in Florida.\n“I have been trying to save everything,” she explained. “It’s easy to save money because then you’ll have more money that you can get other things that you want instead of just spending it really fast.”\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "title": "In new year, hope for ending wars and famine",
    "text": "William Lambers is the author of The Road to Peace and partnered with the UN World Food Program on the book Ending World Hunger. Before heading into the New Year 2024, step back in time for a moment to Jan. 1, 1945. On that day, the United States was still fighting World War II against Germany and Japan. The headline in the Hartford Courant read “Patton Launches Full Scale Offensive.” Underneath that headline also read “Hitler Says War Will Not End Before 1946.” The Battle of the Bulge was underway in Europe after Nazi Germany launched a surprise offensive, which would be its last of the war. Gen. George Patton was leading the U.S. Third Army to stop the German attack, which they ultimately did. America and its allies would have to keep fighting for several more months before Germany finally surrendered. Famine would descend upon the German occupied Netherlands that winter leading to starvation. Famine is the inevitable result of war. It was challenge enough to have a war on one front, but America was also fighting Japan in the Pacific. In that same Jan. 1 newspaper Americans were reading the latest on the war in Asia with hopes that it would end in the new year. These were the daunting challenges America faced to begin the New Year in 1945. Both wars would end in 1945 with America and its allies emerging victorious in Europe and the Pacific. The Allies also airlifted food to the Netherlands to end the famine and prevent other ones in Europe. Even when the war itself ended Americans were helping Europe and Asia. Catholic Relief Services launched a nationwide collection called the “Food for the War-Stricken” campaign which my alma mater, Mount St. Joseph University, took part in. The American public, whether for WWII relief or helping today, can always make a big difference. We should remember the mountains we have climbed as a nation, like those in 1945. For this history can give us hope as we head into the New Year and its own perils. As 2024 begins there are wars raging in many parts of the globe including the recent Israel-Hamas conflict and Russia’s continuing invasion of Ukraine. There is fear the Israel-Hamas war could widen to include more nations. There is starvation taking place in Gaza because of the war. The U.S. must take the lead to build peace between Israel and Palestine and bring food to the hungry. There is also war and hunger in Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Yemen, Syria, Burkina Faso and other nations. The worsening effect of climate change also threatens Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya and other nations with severe food shortages. The UN World Food Program and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization put out a report at the end of 2023 warning of what is to come in the New Year. The report “identifies 18 hunger ‘hotspots’ in a total of 22 countries or territories where it is expected a significant deterioration of the already high levels of acute food insecurity, putting lives and livelihoods at stake.” Many parts of the globe in 2024 are desperate for food and peace. The United States, as it did in 1945, must be a leader during this time of global crisis. The Congress, for example, had a major failure in not passing the Ukraine aid package at the end of 2023. Ukraine needs that assistance to resist the Russian invasion and prevent further aggression. By showing strength we can better convince Russia to withdraw from Ukraine and negotiate peace and disarmament treaties. The legislation also included much needed funding for global food aid to help nations facing starvation because of war and climate change. Congress needs to remember America’s leadership role in the world and get the aid package passed. With so many conflicts at once and the resulting starvation it is clearly a time of international despair. But history reminds us we have overcome huge challenges before and if we work together we can end the wars and famine that threaten the world today.",

    "title": "Tesla could benefit if Trump returns to the White House",
    "text": "Elon Musk and Trump have met multiple times. If Trump were to return to the White House, it could prove beneficial to Tesla, Wedbush analysts wrote in a note to investors. Marc Piasecki/Joe Raedle/Getty Images Wedbush analysts note a Trump presidency may hurt the EV sector but benefit Tesla. Higher Chinese tariffs could limit competition, giving Tesla an edge in the US EV Market. Overall, Wedbush writes that Trump&#039;s presidency would be an overall negative for the industry. As Tesla&#039;s stock surges and the EV giant gears up for its (reportedly delayed) robotaxi unveiling, questions are swirling about how the impending US presidential election will impact Elon Musk&#039;s car company. According to a note to investors from Wedbush analysts, Trump&#039;s possible return to the White House could be a good thing for Tesla. &quot;Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Elon Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment,&quot; Wedbush analysts wrote in the note. Additionally, the Wedbush analysts wrote that a likely increase in tariffs on Chinese goods would &quot;continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) from flooding the US market over the coming years.&quot; Chinese tariffs have remained a large talking point in Trump&#039;s campaign. The Republican candidate has discussed implementing a 60% tariff on Chinese imports, largely exceeding his former tariff policy on China during his presidency. Some of Tesla&#039;s biggest competitors include BYD and Nio, which are currently not available in the US. But Musk has previously said China is &quot;by far&quot; Tesla&#039;s biggest competitor. He said a lot of people think the top 10 car companies will be Tesla, followed by nine Chinese car brands, and &quot;they might not be wrong.&quot; Most recently, Tesla&#039;s biggest competitor BYD just made a deal to build a $1 billion factory in Turkey, which could provide the automaker with a way around EU tariffs and make it a larger threat in the global EV market. Even though a Trump presidency could benefit Tesla, Wedbush analysts said in the note it &quot;would be an overall negative for the EV industry&quot; because the EV tax incentives would likely be removed. EV tax incentives allow buyers to save up to $7,500 when they purchase a new EV, although there&#039;s some caveats to the tax break, like a limited number of eligible vehicles. Musk hasn&#039;t announced who he&#039;s voting for in the 2024 Presidential election, but has said it&#039;s unlikely he&#039;ll vote for Biden. Musk has met with the former President on multiple occasions and said at Tesla&#039;s annual meeting that Trump calls him &quot;out of the blue for no reason.&quot; He also mentioned in the meeting that Trump&#039;s &quot;a huge fan of the Cybertruck&quot; and his friends that have Teslas &quot;love it.&quot; If you enjoyed this story, be sure to follow Business Insider on Microsoft Start.",

    "text": "La Cámara de Senadores sancionó el proyecto de ley que eleva penas por sustraer energía eléctrica de manera ilegal. La Administración Nacional de Electricidad (Ande), expresó su conformidad por la iniciativa aprobada por el Congreso, dado que distingue y endurece las penas para aquellos que causan un perjuicio a la institución. “Estamos conformes porque responde al proyecto que fue remitido por el Poder Ejecutivo. La Ande conjuntamente con la Asesoría Jurídica hemos trabajado y consensuamos los términos de esta ley”, manifestó Nelson Medina, asesor jurídico de la Ande en conversación con “Tarde de perros”, emitido por Universo 970 AM/Nación Media. La ley sancionada por el Congreso no hace distinciones entre funcionarios de la institución o el ciudadano común que hayan sido partícipes del robo de energía, de modo que el castigo es dirigido a todos por igual y se exponen a las penas establecidas en la ley, según sea la gravedad y la cantidad de energía utilizada ilegalmente. [Lea también: ANR está lista para una contienda electoral, dice González](https://www.lanacion.com.py/politica/2024/07/11/anr-esta-lista-para-una-contienda-electoral-dice-gonzalez/) “En el segmento que se encuentran las criptominerías, está contemplada la pena de hasta 10 años de cárcel porque consideramos una situación agravante”, explicó Medina, quien indicó que hay una sanción menor de tres años de cárcel o multa para usuarios domiciliarios, asentamientos, consumidores ilegales menores. La distinción entre estos dos grupos se hace debido a que el primer segmento consumen energía eléctrica de una manera intensa, ocasionan un daño patrimonial terrible a la institución e incluso perturban el suministro, según manifestó el asesor de la Ande. Asimismo, la ley estipula incautaciones y comisos de las maquinarias utilizadas para el robo de energía. “De forma imperativa el fiscal deberá incautar las máquinas y esos objetos están sometidos al comiso, e incluso se contempla la posibilidad de que el Ministerio Público entregue esto a la Secretaría Nacional de Administración de Bienes Incautados y Comisados (Senabico) y a petición de la Ande, puede entregarle a la institución para su guarda, depósito provisional o incluso para su uso”, refirió.

    "text": "Boeing workers going on strike after 96% vote for walkout The workers' first strike since 2008 will start at midnight Pacific time (0700 GMT) as Friday begins, just weeks after new CEO Kelly Ortberg was brought on in August to restore faith in the planemaker after a door panel blew off a near-new 737 MAX jet in mid-air in January. Reuters Last Updated : 13 September 2024, 06:44 IST Follow Us :\nComments Seattle: Boeing's US West Coast factory workers will walk off the job after 96 per cent voted on Thursday in favor of a strike, halting production of the planemaker's strongest-selling jet as it wrestles with chronic output delays and mounting debt.\nThe workers' first strike since 2008 will start at midnight Pacific time (0700 GMT) as Friday begins, just weeks after new CEO Kelly Ortberg was brought on in August to restore faith in the planemaker after a door panel blew off a near-new 737 MAX jet in mid-air in January.\nRoughly 30,000 workers who produce Boeing's 737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas voted on their first full contract in 16 years.\nInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) members voted 96 per cent in favor of striking and 94.6 per cent to reject the agreement.\n\"This is about respect, this is about addressing the past, and this is about fighting for our future,\" said Jon Holden, who headed the negotiations for IAM, Boeing's largest union, before announcing the vote result.\n\"We strike at midnight,\" he said, as members in the union hall cheered and chanted: \"Strike! Strike! Strike!\"\nBoeing did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\nThe deal included a general wage increase of 25 per cent, a $3,000 signing bonus and a pledge to build Boeing's next commercial jet in the Seattle area, provided the program was launched within the four years of the contract.\nAlthough IAM leadership recommended last Sunday that its members accept the contract, many workers had responded angrily, arguing for the originally demanded 40 per cent pay rise and lamenting the loss of an annual bonus.\n\"We're going to get back to the table as quickly as we can,\" Holden told reporters, without saying how long he thought the strike would last or when talks would resume. \"This is something that we take one day at a time, one week at a time.”\nWorkers have been protesting all week in Boeing factories in the Seattle area that assemble Boeing's MAX, 777 and 767 jets.\nBoeing shares closed up 0.9 per cent on Thursday before the vote results were announced but are down 36 per cent this year on concerns over safety, production and a $60 billion debt burden.\nThe duration of the walkout is not clear. A long strike would weigh not only on Boeing's financials, but on airlines that depend on the planemaker’s jets and suppliers who manufacture parts and components for its aircraft.\nAccording to a pre-vote note from TD Cowen, a 50-day strike could cost Boeing an estimated $3 billion to $3.5 billion of cash flow.\nThe Boeing workers' last strike in 2008 shuttered plants for 52 days and hit revenue by an estimated $100 million per day.\nS&P Global Ratings said that an extended strike could delay the planemaker's recovery and hurt its overall rating. Both S&P and Moody's rate Boeing one notch above junk status.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nADVERTISEMENT Published 13 September 2024, 06:44 IST Business News US Boeing companies Follow us on : Follow Us\nADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT",
