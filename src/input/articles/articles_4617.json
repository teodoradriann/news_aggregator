    "text": "Once Upon Two Times Movie Review: Family Drama About Estranged Exes Is Absorbing The Hindi drama about the meeting of two families in marriage takes an unexpected turn in this Zee5 feature by Sonakshi Mittal. Once Upon Two Times Movie Review: Family Drama About Estranged Exes Is Absorbing About Once Upon Two Times Sonakshi Mittal's directorial debut, Once Upon Two Times, begins with the romance of two college classmates Ahaan (Anud Singh Dhaka) and Ruhi (Kashish Khan). After they decide to tie the knot, it's time for the families to meet, except there's a hitch. Their parents already know one another and didn't part on good terms. In fact, Ruhi's mother Purnima (Mrinal Kulkarni) was the ex-girlfriend of Ahaan's dad Kaushik (Sanjay Suri). These revelations all tumble out during a family get-together when the connections are unveiled and the older pair wonders about their past and their children's future. The Zee5 film also features the late Nitesh Pandey. Produced by Shashi Mittai, Sumeet Mittai and Ajay Rai, Once Upon Two Times is also written by Sonakshi Mittal. The family drama weaves into a bit of comedy once the secrets are all out in the open. But mostly the Hindi film looks at the issues of commitment and fidelity as it ties into the institution of marriage. Janhit Mein Jaari actor Dhaka and Khan play the central couple, but it is the older generation that draws in our interest. The dynamics of the elders and youngsters are intriguing as they try to work a way forward. Incidentally, this plotline was also seen in the 2022 Bengali film Kishmish and in an episode of the second season of Amazon Prime Video's Made In Heaven. Real-life couple Samir Soni and his wife Neelam played the older pair who had had a romance and now their children were set to be wed.

    "title": "Taylor Mac and Will Davis on How Orlando Is a ‘Gift to the Queer Community’",
    "text": "When director [Will Davis](https://www.playbill.com/person/will-davis-director) was 17 years old, he read [Virginia Woolf](https://www.playbill.com/person/virginia-woolf)’s novel Orlando for the first time. In it, a young man named Orlando wakes up one day to find that he’s been transformed into a woman. For the young Davis, who would eventually come out as a trans man, this notion of fluid change felt profound, though he couldn't pinpoint why at the time. But as Woolf wrote, “Orlando remained precisely as they had been. The change of sex, though it altered their future, did nothing whatever to alter their identity.” Now in his 30s, Davis can better articulate why this felt pivotal. “There is something, in all the most delightful ways, subversive,” he says. “This character, who can move through time and also can move through iterations of themselves…It’s not a problem, it's not a burden. It's just another thing that happens.” When he got the offer to direct [Sarah Ruhl](https://www.playbill.com/person/sarah-ruhl-vault- 27664)’s adaptation of Orlando Off-Broadway at [Signature Theatre](https://www.playbill.com/person/signature-theatre-vault-0000123118), naturally the busy director said yes. The show runs until May 12. Orlando has been adapted various times into other mediums—a film starring Tilda Swinton, several operas, and plays. Ruhl’s play encompasses Orlando and a chorus (who play multiple characters, including Orlando’s lovers and historical figures such as Queen Elizabeth and William Shakespeare). Previous versions cast mostly cisgender performers. To Davis, there was room there for something different. He’s used to breaking boundaries; he is currently artistic director of Rattlestick Theater Company, making him the first trans person to run an Off-Broadway theatre. Davis wanted to create an Orlando that was “gender expansive,” made up primarily of trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming performers. At the Signature, playwright-performer [Taylor Mac](https://www.playbill.com/person/taylor-mac-1) (of the upcoming [Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil](https://www.playbill.com/article/cast-complete-for-midnight-in-the-garden-of-good-and-evil-musical-starring-j-harrison-ghee-tom-hewitt-sierra-boggess)) plays the title role. The supporting cast is stacked: Tony winner [Lisa Kron](https://www.playbill.com/person/lisa-kron-vault- 26617), [Nathan Lee Graham](https://www.playbill.com/person/nathan-lee-graham-vault- 49131), [Jo Lampert](https://www.playbill.com/person/jo-lampert-performer), Janice Amaya, TL Thompson, and Rad Pereira. As Mac playfully puts it, “The entire company is queer, except for Sarah [Ruhl]—we gotta have one token.” Orlando was a story Woolf wrote for her female lover, Vita Sackville-West; initially, it was read through a cisgender lens, with the transition being treated as a metaphor. Though in the story, Orlando and other characters change their genders (either physically or through presentation), they are never explicitly identified as trans, or even gay. As a man, Orlando falls in love with a woman; as a woman, Orlando marries a man. But, the story was revolutionary for presenting gender as a social construct, something that is malleable—people could have aspects of multiple genders inside of them. Over time, Orlando has become a seminal piece of queer and trans fiction. “I'm continually surprised at how much of our history is presented as heterosexual and cis,” says Mac. “And it's just shocking when you discover these things from the past that are so present.” Mac is something of a historian, having performed in the 24-hour-long show A 24-Decade History of Popular Music, which is now a concert documentary on Max. Below, Davis and Mac discuss what Orlando has to teach audiences today. This interview has been condensed and edited. Taylor, you usually perform in your own work. Why did you want to speak someone else's words? Taylor Mac: I started in this business as an actor. And to be frank, the business is so biased against anyone of my persuasion. When I started out, I spent seven years trying to get auditions and I couldn't even get an audition. And so I made my own work. It’s been almost 10 years since I've been in somebody else's play. There is this part of me that really loves just digging into plays, and just being an actor and not having to carry 20 jobs all at the same time, in order to express myself as an artist. So I'm just really grateful for this experience. As an actor, the play is so beautiful. Playing Orlando is just delicious. You get to do Restoration of the 18th century, you get to do Melodrama of the 19th century, you get to do realism of the 20th century. You're using all the tools. So it's like 10 years of not acting in other people's work squished into one play. I love that. The stage directions for Orlando say that the chorus, “may be played by as few as three gifted transformational virtuosic actors or as many as you can fit on a stage and pay.” Will, it seems that there’s a lot of room direction-wise. What did you want to bring to the play that you hadn’t seen before? Will Davis: Sarah says, “It's an open text.” And it's true. You can assign it in any way with any number of performers. And that's really wonderful to me. I'm interested in plays that are interested in directors, when it's saying, “I can't wait for you to collaborate.” I get really excited and Orlando is a perfect example of that. We did a reading with Taylor in 2020, the week before we all quarantined. Sarah and I had met not long before that and I had said, “Have you ever heard this play with a gender-expansive cast?” And she said, “No.” And I said, “I think some wonderful things might happen.” And she got very excited about that, which just made me love her even more. And so when we read it, the thing happened—that I feel like always happens in work like this—which is a group of performers that inhabit really, gender-full, gender-expansive spaces are such a gift to this kind of language, because there's an added complexity and depth that immediately just erupted into the room. Do you see this production as a reclamation of a piece of queer history that has been cloaked in heterosexuality? Davis: It's not a reclamation, this is my opinion. It's something that Taylor was saying, that through time, there were these things that were just—it needs to get straighter, it needs to get more cisgendered, often it needs to get whiter. That is what makes it part of the canon, 'cause it's responding to the dominant paradigm. Shakespeare’s like this, too—we don't need to reclaim it, it's already there. No one needs to queer it. It is queer. We get to give it to you, and show you some of this pure incredible queer energy that is sitting inside of it. But we don't have to reclaim it, because it's already ours. Mac: It's like discovering America—this thing that's been there the whole time. If anything, people have kept this from us for whatever weird, protective thing they thought they were doing. They kept it from us. Why wasn't I reading this instead of The Lord of the Flies? What do you think this story has to teach us at this time? Davis: I have very purposefully built the world of this play to have a lot of Easter eggs and moments that are very much intended to be gifts to the queer community. And I have also built the world of this play as an invitation to everyone to come join. That's always the question, when you're working on a text, where we have conversations about who's telling the story and there's some (for whatever reason) tension around that. But I think that my job is to say, “We can't come to you because we're having the very best time. But you're very welcome to join us. We cannot wait to have you.” Mac: Everyone’s invited to the party. Not everybody's in charge, but everybody's invited. [chuckles] What I've been thinking a lot about lately is that gentle queerness is what this play is offering. The way that Will directed the play and designed the play, which is so beautiful and elegant, it’s all very gentle queerness…in a way that you don't normally see queerness. Usually queerness on a stage has a lot of capitalism attached to it. So it's all very, like, “Hey, we're selling you! We're selling you! We're trying to survive!” And I find this such a relief, at this stage of my life, to just be in something that is gentle, and still is expressing this queerness. Davis: I'm entering a place in my own work—there’s nothing to prove in that arena. There's something to share, though.",

    "text": "The Delhi HC dismissed a plea seeking permission to offer prayers and visit graves at the site of the recently demolished 600-year-old Masjid Akhonji. New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed a plea seeking permission to offer prayers and visit graves at the site of the recently demolished 600-year-old Masjid Akhonji in Mehrauli area on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat. Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav dismissed the application filed by the Managing Committee of Delhi Waqf Board (DWB), saying that the court is not inclined to issue any directions at this stage, as the matter is already under consideration in a pending petition since 2022. Justice Kaurav noted that the site is currently under the possession of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), and the court has already issued a status quo order on the area where the mosque stood. The court said that the plea for unhindered entry for prayers and visits to the graveyard constitutes a request for a mandatory injunction, which it is not inclined to grant at this time. Advocate Shams Khwaja, representing the Managing Committee of Delhi Waqf Board, stressed the urgency of the application due to the significance of Shab-e-Barat, a night of forgiveness observed by Muslims. He argued that the demolished mosque, believed to be 600-year-old, was illegally razed by DDA officials. However, the counsel for the DWB (not the same as DWB's Managing Committee) opposed the application, disputing the age of the mosque and its status as a waqf property. After hearing both parties, the court dismissed the application. Earlier, the court had directed the DDA to maintain status quo specifically on the area where the mosque was situated but clarified that this order does not prevent the DDA from taking action on adjacent areas. The Managing Committee of DWB alleges that the demolition of the mosque and madrasa was conducted in a brazen manner, leaving the Imam and his family without shelter as their hutment was also destroyed.

    "title": "ISIS terrorists arrested in Maharashtra have been sharing ‘DIY kits’ with contacts, have taken ‘oath of allegiance’ to serve caliphate: What NIA chargesheet says",
    "text": "In a significant revelation, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday said that members of the Maharashtra Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terror module had been sharing “DIY (Do It Yourself) kits” with their contacts committed to propagating the extremist and violent ideology of the global terrorist organisation within India. The accused were also found to be raising funds to finance their terror plans and designs, as mentioned by the NIA in its charge-sheet against six persons to tighten its noose further around the ISIS terror conspiracy in India. “NIA investigations so far in the Maharashtra ISIS terror module case (NIA RC-02/2023/NIA/MUM) have revealed a larger conspiracy with international linkages and the involvement of foreign-based ISIS handlers,” states the charge-sheet “The investigations have also exposed a complex network of individuals committed to propagating the extremist and violent ideology of ISIS within India.” Those chargesheeted have been identified as Tabish Nasser Siddiqui of Mumbai, Zulfikar Ali Barodawala alias Lalabhai, Sharjeel Shaikh and Aakif Ateeque Nachan of Borivali-Padgha, as well as Zubair Noor Mohammad Shaikh alias Abu Nusaiba and Adnanali Sarkar of Pune. As per the NIA, all the accused are members of the proscribed ISIS outfit and had “hatched a conspiracy to further the terrorist activities of organisation, with the intention to strike fear and terror amongst the people and threaten the security of India its secular ethos and culture and the democratic system of governance.” Two of these accused, Zulfikar Ali Barodawala and Aakif Ateeque Nachan, were earlier also chargesheeted in the Pune ISIS module case for fabrication of IEDs for triggering blasts. The accused, chargesheeted before the NIA Special Court, Mumbai, under various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Indian Penal Code, were engaged in actively propagating the violent and extremist ideology of the ISIS and in carrying out acts preparatory to terrorist violence through recruitment of individuals to the organisation and its cause. Two accused, Tabish and Zulfikar, had taken an oath of allegiance (Bayath) to the self-styled Khalifa (leader) of the ISIS. The NIA Mumbai Branch also found the accused in possession of incriminating material related to Hijrah to Syria, along with propaganda magazines like ‘Voice of Hind’ and ‘Voice of Khurasan’ published by the ISIS. “Further, the accused had been sharing DIY (Do It Yourself) kits with their contacts. The accused were also found to be raising funds to finance their terror plans and designs, as per NIA investigations,” said the anti-terror agency in the charge-sheet. The case was registered by NIA Mumbai on June 28 this year against Tabish Nasser Siddiqui and others, following information received by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) regarding a conspiracy hatched by them to disturb the unity, integrity, security and sovereignty of the country, and to wage a war against the government of India by promoting the terrorist activities of ISIS. Further investigations in the case are continuing in accordance with the provisions of section 173(8) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). It is noted that ISIS, also known by the names Islamic State (IS), Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL), Daish, Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP), ISIS Wilayat Khorasan, and Islamic State of Iraq and Sham Khorasan (ISIS-K), has been operating through various modules to spread terror across India.

    "title": "Kathryn Morris Talks Autism, Motherhood and Confidence | First For Women",
    "text": "Actress Kathryn Morris remembers the first time her twin sons—Rocco and Jameson, now 11—spotted their mother on the small screen in her iconic role as Detective Lilly Rush in the hit CBS series Cold Case. Morris’ beloved character—which she played 2003 to 2010—was a Philadelphia homicide detective who investigated murders that had gone unsolved for often decades, and struck her sons as more intense than the fun-loving mom they knew.\n“You’re very serious, Mom! You’re the boss!” Rocco said as he watched the pilot episode. Morris’ life changed dramatically when she became a mother to the twins in 2013, and changed again when both boys were diagnosed with autism.\nWhile this presented challenges, Morris says the story of autism is a beautiful one—and her life with the boys is an incredible life. “I really hate it when there are all these articles about the struggles and sadness of having children with autism,” Morris says. “It’s always very depressing and kind of ableist, and it’s not celebrating neurodiversity. It’s really so much bigger than that.\n “I wasn’t really on the mom train; I wasn’t really expecting I was going to be a mother, and I never knew it was going to be this challenging—this great adventure,” Morris continues. “I didn’t know what to expect. And this has been the most enriching, powerful, life-changing, exciting experience of our lives. We are having the best time!”\nWanting to help people with autism and their families, Morris launched The Savants , a support community and lifestyle brand. The website offers stories about people on the autism spectrum and a blog. The Instagram page and YouTube channel offer informative and fun videos, and Morris is expanding the YouTube offerings with more entertainment and education, and videos with guest speakers both on and off the autism spectrum.\n“It’s a one-stop place where you can go,” Morris says. “I just want to have a place that really serves the whole family and community unit. We’re really a portal for comfort, community, and connection.”\nHere, Morris shares her advice for life, health and happiness with FIRST for Women .\nKathryn Morris, 2019 Paul Archuleta/FilmMagic/Getty Images FIRST for Women (FFW) : What advice would you give to parents with children who have autism? Kathryn Morris: I would say, if you’re new to the process of early diagnosis and the waiting period, keep your circle small—just your ride-or-die friends. You can say, “Hey, I’ve got a lot going on right now. I think I’m going to cancel everything for the year until I figure out what’s going on with me and my child.” Put a loving, protective wall around yourself. A lot of people will try to bombard you with links and books to “fix” autism.\nThe Savants is really about healing the unit. Keep your ride-or-die friends close, and say, “I’m going to lean into my community, the ones who are going through what I’m going through, and keep my circle insulated with people who’ve been there before.” It’s an act of self-care.\nFFW : What keeps you energized/inspired/motivated on your busiest days? KM: Definitely my children. Slowing down, taking a breath, and watching how they enjoy the simple joys—the little things, like discovering something new. With time being so limited and things so hectic, I’ve had to slow down because health has been such a big focus in our household. I really value the moments: having a meal, having a conversation.\nFFW : What are three actionable ways you relieve stress? KM: First, notice your breath. Find space in the moment. Pay attention to the pattern and allow yourself to process what’s happening in your body. Don’t hold it in—let it flow.\nSecond, take action. Walk, sip water, step outside—whatever helps you reset. It starts with the breath, but you move forward by moving.\nThird, let it go. It’s a fresh start, a do-over. Every moment is a chance to begin again.\nKathryn Morris, 2017 Michael Tran/FilmMagic/Getty Images FFW : Where do you get your inner strength? KM: My inner strength comes from my children and the core values I was raised with—kindness, integrity, and the golden rule. I’m especially inspired by the clarity and moral compass of my neurodiverse children. It’s as if they’re tuned into something higher, and we have so much to learn from that. I’m grounded by the wisdom of our elders, especially grandparents, and the lessons they pass down. I’m an optimistic, hopeful person. I believe in people and in the goodness of others. And I do have faith. I live in hope.\nFFW : Do you have any beauty hacks? KM: I embraced paleo living. I kind of stripped away a lot of things. I like health store beauty products and Korean skin care. For me, at this point, less is more. I have a very clean liver. I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs. I’ve always had the long game in mind. My mom would tell me, ‘Just put Vaseline all over your face.’ Mom is very natural; she applies a little mascara, a little lipstick. She’s a natural beauty.\nFFW : What special projects are you working on? KM: Of course, I’m always an actor, but I pulled back to focus on my kids. Now, I feel so invigorated after launching The Savants . I’m excited that it’s really stepping into another level. I’d love to do a comedy and another powerhouse role. I’m just excited about the future—it feels like a new chapter. It’s been the most intense decade ever, a decade I didn’t expect.\nIf you’re struggling with something, don’t be sad. Be encouraged, because on the other side, it’s so bright, and it brings perspective. My children have taught me so much about life. The conversations we have are unlike anything I’ve ever had with anyone, and I am forever changed because of them. My greatest role has been the transformation into mother, person, and actress. There are layers I never would have imagined.\nFFW : Was Detective Lilly Rush on Cold Case your favorite role? How are you like her and unlike her? KM: I would say she’s one of my favorites. I spent so much time with her, so she felt like family. I would probably say she’s one of my favorites, if not the favorite. I spent so much time with her, and there are pieces of her that we didn’t even cover. I spent so much time doing Cold Case , and Lilly is so close to the heart.\nKathryn Morris, 2017 Roy Rochlin/Getty Images FFW : Many of our readers deal with pain. Do you have any secrets to easing aches? KM: Magnesium creams that you can put on feet, CBD creams, and turmeric creams you can get at a health food store. Those are amazing!\nFFW : What is the wisest advice you’ve ever gotten? KM: ‘Become so talented that they can’t afford not to hire you.’ Larry Moss, my acting coach.\nFFW : What advice would you give them for feeling confident just as they are? KM: If the gym doesn’t make you happy, do something else. Don’t chase trends—do what fills your soul. Dance, move, laugh, run—whatever makes you feel alive, especially with the people you love. That’s where real confidence comes from. If you’ve raised four kids, there’s a swagger in that. If you’ve worked for three decades, take pride in what you’ve learned. Your beauty is in your story, your joy, and your laughter. Most people are drawn to you because of your energy, not a superficial exterior. A healthy body is a miracle. Just watch your kids—they know how to live. And don’t save your nice clothes. Wear them now. You’d be surprised how transformative that simple act can be. You are the special occasion—every day.\nFFW : Do you have any tips or tricks for menopause symptoms or embracing your age? KM: Absolutely. First—more protein, more hydration, magnesium, and collagen. Those basics can be game-changers. Also, work with a great functional medicine doctor for natural support. Ask for specialized testing, including hormone panels and thyroid workups, so you know exactly what your body needs. There are so many options now to support this phase of life in a personalized, empowered way. And strength training—don’t sleep on it. This is your power chapter, Foxy, not the decline. You’ve earned every inch of wisdom and energy you carry. Own it.\nFFW : What brings you the most joy in life? KM: Nothing brings me more joy than watching my autistic children live their best lives—fully themselves, fully included, and full of joy. Seeing my twins experience pure happiness, dancing like no one’s watching, doing the things we were once told might never be possible—that’s everything. That kind of joy, that kind of freedom, is unmatched. Nothing else in life compares.",
