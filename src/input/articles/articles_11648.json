    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "People in California are getting more sick leave and can't be fired for using marijuana outside work",
    "text": "New laws are set to go into effect in California in 2024. One will protect doctors who mail abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is illegal. Doctors in California who mail abortion pills to patients in other states will be protected from prosecution. Workers will receive more paid sick leave on the heels of a big year for labor. And companies can’t fire employees for using marijuana outside work.\nThese are among the hundreds of laws that take effect January 1 in the nation’s most populous state.\nEach year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signs hundreds of laws passed by the state Legislature. Most take effect on January 1 of the following year. But sometimes lawmakers delay a law’s effective date for various reasons, including giving people more time to prepare for the new rules.\nSome of the highest-profile bills passed by the Legislature in 2023 will not take effect until later. Fast food workers will get a minimum wage of $20 per hour on April 1. Health care workers are scheduled to see the first minimum wage increase on June 1. Laws requiring businesses to report their emissions and financial risks from climate change won’t take effect until 2026.\nA law banning people from carrying guns in most public places was blocked by a federal judge just days before it was set to take effect.\nIn 2023, the California Legislature passed 1,046 bills. Newsom signed 890 of those bills into law. He vetoed 156 bills, or 14.9%, according to statistics compiled by veteran lobbyist Chris Micheli.\nHere is a look at some of the new laws Californians face:\nYOU CAN’T GET FIRED FOR SMOKING POT AT HOME Some drug tests don’t determine if a person is high, but only if that person has used marijuana at all in recent days. California lawmakers thought it wasn’t fair for companies to punish workers for failing these drug tests, especially since recreational marijuana has been legal in the state since 2016. A new law passed in 2022 but takes effect this year says companies can’t punish workers for failing these types of drug tests. There are exceptions for construction workers and companies that must conduct drug tests as part of federal contracts.\nA TAX INCREASE FOR HIGHER WAGE EARNERS California has a short-term disability program that pays people who cannot work because of a non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy. A 1.1% tax on wages funds the program. In the past, this tax only applied to wages below a certain amount, about $153,000 in 2023. But starting January 1, a new law, passed in 2022 but takes effect this year, eliminates the wage cap. People who make over $153,000 annually will pay a 1.1% tax on those wages.\nPROTECTIONS FOR ABORTION PILLS Abortion is now illegal in 14 states after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. But doctors and pharmacists in California who mail abortion pills to patients in those states will be shielded from prosecution or fines. The law bans bounty hunters or bail agents from apprehending California doctors and taking them to another state to stand trial. It even prohibits state-based social media companies, such as Facebook, from complying with out-of-state subpoenas, warrants, or other requests for records to discover the identity of patients seeking abortion pills.\nMORE SICK LEAVE Workers in California will receive a minimum of five days of sick leave annually instead of three, which they will accrue once they have been employed for 200 days. Labor advocates say the increase will curb the spread of disease by preventing employees from working when they are sick. But opponents say the law will be another financial burden for employers and claim some workers request sick leave when they are not ill.\nCOMMUNITY COLLEGE TUITION Low-income Mexican residents who live within 45 miles (72 kilometers) of the California-Mexico border will be eligible for in-state tuition rates at participating Southern California community colleges under a new law signed by Newsom. Advocates say the measure will lower the burden for students to receive education and training to help prepare them for the workforce. It resembles another program in the state allowing up to 200 Nevada residents who live in certain areas near the California-Nevada border to receive in-state tuition rates at Lake Tahoe Community College.\nLGBTQ+ FOSTER YOUTH Foster families will be required to demonstrate their ability to meet the health and safety needs of children regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. It was one of several bills the Legislature passed this year to expand protections for LGBTQ+ youth. Newsom vetoed another high-profile bill that would have required courts to consider whether a parent affirms their child’s gender identity in custody and visitation proceedings.\nLOW-INCOME HOUSING ON CHURCH LAND Religious institutions and nonprofit colleges in California can now turn their parking lots and other properties into affordable housing. The new law, which helps these institutions bypass most local permitting and environmental review rules, was among several initiatives attempting to address the homelessness crisis in California. Supporters of the law said it will serve as another tool to build much-needed housing in the state, but opponents said the law takes away local control over housing developments.\nHARSHER PENALTIES FOR FENTANYL DEALERS California lawmakers introduced a slew of bills last year aimed at addressing fentanyl overdoses, which are killing roughly 110 Californians each week. Only one measure cracking down on dealers reached Newsom’s desk. The new law increases penalties for dealers who possess more than 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of fentanyl. Newsom also signed bills requiring stadiums and amusement parks to stock overdose reversal drugs and community colleges and California State University campuses to provide fentanyl test strips.",

    "title": "Elon Musk Trolled His Way Through 2023 – But He’s Still Ending The Year $100 Billion Richer",
    "text": "For Elon Musk, the past year has been a rollercoaster of crises and surprising financial gains. Despite controversies, failed endeavors, and a slump in X’s valuation, Musk has somehow found himself almost $100 billion richer in 2023, maintaining his status as the world’s richest person. Elon Musk’s tumultuous year began with the acquisition of X for $44 billion, which left experts puzzled as loans secured against his Tesla stock financed the deal. While Musk’s net worth peaked at $340 billion in 2021, he experienced a significant dip of $182 billion in 2022. However, against the odds, he rebounded in 2023, accumulating $97 billion and restoring his net worth to $235 billion. The acquisition of X brought unprecedented insight into Musk’s decision-making process, marked by radical changes and surprise rebranding from Twitter to X. Critics, including brand consultant Allen Adamson, deemed the move irrational and driven by Musk’s ego rather than sound business strategy. Musk’s plan to charge users for accessing X raised eyebrows among experts who questioned its financial viability. Musk’s Twitter troubles escalated with a controversial post endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory, triggering an advertiser exodus that included major companies like Disney, Apple, and Walmart. Musk’s confrontational response at the NYT’s Dealbook summit further fueled the controversy. Despite X’s struggles, Musk’s wealth surge is attributed to the success of his other ventures. SpaceX, valued at $175 billion, outstrips the valuations of Disney and Comcast. Tesla’s share price rose by over 100% year-to-date, with the Model Y becoming the best-selling car globally and the Cybertruck launch creating significant buzz. While Musk’s high-risk, high-reward approach has largely favored him, observers caution against his unpredictable behavior as a potential risk to his ventures. Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, identifies Musk’s volatility as a top risk for Tesla. Wedbush’s Dan Ives views X as a “distraction and overhang for the Tesla story/stock.” As Musk navigates the turbulence, his ability to sustain success amid controversies remains a subject of intense scrutiny.",

    "text": "Hitzenächte bergen Schlaganfall-Risiko, wie Forscher entdeckt haben\nSchlaganfälle drohen nicht nur im Alter. Medizinische Studien bestätigen: Hohe Nachttemperaturen steigern das Risiko.\nFrankfurt – Ein Schlaganfall stellt einen medizinischen Notfall dar, bei dem die Blutversorgung des Gehirns abrupt gestoppt wird. Diese plötzliche Erkrankung kann lebensgefährlich sein und oft zu dauerhaften neurologischen Schäden führen. In Deutschland sind jährlich etwa 270.000 Menschen von einem Schlaganfall betroffen, was ihn zu einer der häufigsten Ursachen für Tod und Behinderung macht.\nDie normale Blutversorgung bestimmter Bereiche des Gehirns wird bei einem Schlaganfall unterbrochen. Da das Gehirn keine eigenen Energiereserven hat, ist es auf eine ständige Zufuhr von Sauerstoff und Nährstoffen angewiesen. Bereits nach wenigen Minuten ohne ausreichende Durchblutung beginnen die Nervenzellen, auch Neuronen genannt, abzusterben. Es gibt verschiedene Risikofaktoren, die einen Schlaganfall begünstigen können.\nForscher untersuchen Zusammenhang zwischen Temperatur und Schlaganfall-Risiko\nDie Gefahr, einen Schlaganfall zu erleiden, gilt nicht nur ältere Menschen. Obwohl das Risiko mit zunehmendem Alter steigt, kann laut der Deutschen Schlaganfall-Hilfe jeder, vom Baby bis zum älteren Menschen, betroffen sein. Neben unveränderlichen Risikofaktoren wie Alter, genetische Veranlagung, Geschlecht oder Umweltbedingungen spielen auch vermeidbare Faktoren eine Rolle. Dazu gehören unter anderem Übergewicht, Bluthochdruck und Bewegungsmangel. Forscher haben nun herausgefunden, dass auch nächtliche Hitze im Sommer das Risiko für einen Schlaganfall erhöhen könnte.\nDie Wissenschaftler untersuchten in einer im European Heart Journal veröffentlichten Studie den Zusammenhang zwischen Temperatur und Schlaganfallhäufigkeit in der Region Augsburg über die letzten 15 Jahre. Die Analyse ergab, dass in Nächten mit extrem hohen Temperaturen mehr Schlaganfälle auftraten. Das Risiko soll um sieben Prozent gestiegen sein. Zudem berichtete das Deutsche Ärzteblatt, dass die Anzahl der heißen Nächte in den letzten Jahren zugenommen hat.\nNächtliche Hitze erhöht Schlaganfall-Gefahr: Mögliche Ursachen\nDie Studienergebnisse zeigten, dass das Risiko bei nächtlicher Hitze sowohl für Mini-Schlaganfälle, sogenannte transitorisch-ischämische Attacken (TIA), als auch für ischämische Schlaganfälle (Hirninfarkte) anstieg. Für hämorrhagische Schlaganfälle (Hirnblutungen) bestand kein Zusammenhang. Besonders gefährdet seien Menschen ab 65 Jahren und Frauen, aber auch bei jüngeren Personen und Männern erhöhte sich das Risiko in besonders warmen Nächten. Die meisten durch nächtliche Hitze ausgelösten Schlaganfälle traten innerhalb der ersten 48 Stunden nach Temperaturanstieg auf.\nDie Forscher vermuten zwei Hauptursachen für das erhöhte Schlaganfall-Risiko durch nächtliche Hitze. Einerseits könnte Dehydrierung (Flüssigkeitsmangel) während der Nacht eine Rolle spielen. Andererseits könnte die Hitze den Schlaf und die tageszeitliche Regulierung der Körpertemperatur stören. Laut der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Neurologie könnte dies die Regeneration des Gehirns beeinträchtigen. Die Studienergebnisse verdeutlichen die Bedeutung von Hitzeschutzmaßnahmen zur Schlaganfallprävention. (jbr)",

    "text": "A bipartisan majority in the U.S. Congress recently took the noble and necessary action of devoting a fresh round of aid worth $61 billion to Ukraine. Now that the U.S. has stepped up militarily, the West needs to ramp up a line of effort that has been lacking in its Ukraine strategy: intensifying economic warfare. It’s a tactic that President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would have embraced — and one that will undermine the Russian military and the Vladimir Putin’s regime’s stability.\nReagan came into office perceiving the Soviet Union’s economic weakness, and resolved early in his presidency to use American economic power to bring down the USSR. In 1982, National Security Advisor William Clark said in a speech, “We must force our principal adversary, the Soviet Union, to bear the brunt of its economic shortcomings.”\nLater, the seminal National Security Decision Directive-75 of 1983 articulated the need “to seek to minimize the potential for Soviet exercise of reverse leverage on Western countries based on trade, energy supply, and financial relationships.” Hence, throughout the 1980s the vast majority of U.S-Soviet trade was dominated by agricultural products. American machinery and equipment composed 13 percent of U.S-Soviet trade totals in 1981, but fell to 5 percent by 1985.\nToday, the Western war effort is hamstrung by Kremlin leverage over the West in the form of continued oil and gas exports.\n-snip-\nSadly, many Ukraine-supporting democracies have not done enough to wean themselves from Russian energy — a work Donald Trump started as president by sanctioning the now-defunct Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Hungary, Slovakia, Belgium, Czechia and France were the largest buyers of Russian fossil fuels within the European Union in February 2024.",
