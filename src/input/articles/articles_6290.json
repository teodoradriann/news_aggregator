    "title": "Pakistan facing critical challenge of sending 26.21m children back to school, moot told",
    "text": "Pakistan faces a critical challenge with approximately 26.21 million out-of-school children (OOSC). In response to this crisis, the Sindh Education Foundation (SEF), in collaboration with Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), organised a two-day National Conference for Education Foundations at Karachi. The conference aimed to foster collaboration and knowledge- sharing among education foundations across Pakistan. The foundations participating in the conference identified key challenges within the education sector, share best practices, and explore innovative approaches to enhance support for education sector more effectively. A ‘Foundations’ Action Plan’ developed to address the needs of out-of-school children by way of evolving a synergy amongst the education foundations to amplify collective impact and facilitate mutual learning. In the opening remarks, Managing Director SEF Abdul Kabir Kazi emphasized the collaborative effort to educate every child. He acknowledged that all stakeholders are striving to retain out-of-school children. However, the primary purpose of this conference is to develop an action plan as Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah wants to seriously respond to the education emergency declared by the prime minister. Then, Abid Gill provided an overview around JICA’s efforts in response to the out-of-school-children issues in Pakistan. He added that JICA’s AQAL project has developed ALPs for primary and middle-tech as well as literacy & skill programmes to teach youth and adults. He shared that these learning models are synching extremely well to build a stronger educational ecosystem in the country. Chairman Planning and Development Department, GoS, Najam Shah lauded the efforts of the conference organizers for establishing a consortium of education foundations to respond to the educational emergency in the country. The momentum of the conference was driven by representatives from the Elementary and Secondary Education Foundation (ESEF)-KP, Punjab Education Foundation (PEF), Merged Areas Education Foundation (MaEF), Balochistan Education Foundation (BEF), National Education Foundation (NEF), and the SEF. These representatives presented existing educational models that education foundations are employing to include, retain and teach out-of-school children. They added that prevailing challenges of budgetary constraints, geographical dynamics, and political instabilities are among the major bottlenecks towards addressing the out-of-school crises. The discussion provided valuable insights into governance models, policy priorities, access issues, quality & relevance, accountability, and the monitoring & research frameworks of these education foundations. The conference agenda was made more effective through interactive discussions with panellists, who addressed a wide range of issues, including teacher retention, resource allocation, school infrastructure, poverty, lack of coordination between partners and foundations, and shortages of books and other educational resources. Minister for Education Gilgit-Baltistan Ghulam Shehzad Agha commended the role of the SEF in inspiring regional foundations to work towards a common goal. He said that he will establish an education foundation in GB using the SEF model. Renowned economist and educationist Kaiser Bengali stated that while individual parents are eager to send their children to school; however, communities often fail to make the necessary efforts to ensure access to education through their elected representatives. He added Karachi’s Orangi Town presents notably high literacy because the community has taken ownership of the issue. He pointed out that no member of the provincial assembly (MPA) or member of the national assembly (MNA) has ever lost their constituency for failing to secure the right to education. Bengali further criticised the state’s failure to provide education, attributing it to several factors, including the politicisation of teacher recruitment. He explained that teacher appointments are often influenced by political considerations, with the aim of gaining electoral support. “I have proposed to the government that teachers should not be engaged in election duties,” he added.

    "text": "Us Weekly\nZak Bagans habla sobre la muerte del investigador Dan Rivera, Annabelle\nGhost AdventuresZak Bagans habló con Us sobre su experiencia con Annabelle, días después de que el también investigador paranormal Dan Rivera falleciera en presencia de la muñeca embrujada.\n\"Mis pensamientos y oraciones están con su familia y amigos\", dijo Bagans a Us en una entrevista el miércoles 16 de julio.\nBagans, quien tuvo su propia experiencia con la muñeca en 2017, dijo a Us: \"Solo puedo hablar de mis experiencias con Annabelle\".\nExplicó: \"Tuve la oportunidad de investigar a Annabelle cuando el propietario la trajo a mi museo en 2017\".\n\"Me afectó mucho y eso hizo que tocara la muñeca. Al dueño no le gustó nada\", relató.\nBagans contó a Us sobre un aterrador encuentro en febrero con otra muñeca, que lo dejó asustado y luchando por su vida.\nExplicó: \"Fue una infestación demoníaca que me afectó gravemente y, literalmente, estuve en el hospital al día siguiente. Fue un apego que duró dos meses y una de las peores experiencias de mi vida\".\nDijo a Us que la \"horrible\" experiencia que se extendió durante meses lo llevó a tomarse un descanso de las investigaciones paranormales sobre demonios. \"Esto demuestra que, como alguien que se dedica a este trabajo, las muñecas pueden ser portadoras de posesión y apego demoníaco\", señaló y añadió: \"¿Creo que las muñecas pueden ser portadoras de demonios? Absolutamente. ¿Siento que pueden afectar a las personas? Sí, lo creo\".\nEl 13 de julio, Rivera falleció durante la gira Devils on the Run en Gettysburg, Pensilvania, donde se exhibía la muñeca Annabelle, supuestamente embrujada.\nLa policía confirmó que respondió a una llamada en el hotel donde se realizaba el tour tras recibir el reporte de la muerte de un hombre.\n\"El fallecido fue encontrado en su habitación de hotel por trabajadores\", informó la policía. \"No se observó nada inusual ni sospechoso en el lugar\".\nSegún Francis Dutrow, forense del condado de Adams, la autopsia de Rivera ya fue completada. La causa de la muerte se ha pospuesto a la espera de los resultados toxicológicos, que podrían demorar entre ocho y diez semanas.\nLa Sociedad de Nueva Inglaterra para la Investigación Psíquica señaló que planea continuar con la gira programada por Estados Unidos a pesar del fallecimiento de Rivera.\nAnnabelle ha sido descrita como \"poseída por demonios\". Según People, la Sociedad de Nueva Inglaterra para la Investigación Psíquica, donde trabajaba Rivera y que fue fundada por los reconocidos investigadores paranormales Ed y Lorraine Warren, afirma que la historia de la muñeca se remonta a 1968.\nUna mujer recibió la muñeca, cuya versión ficticia aparece en la saga cinematográfica El Conjuro. Después de que sus compañeras de piso afirmaran haber notado cosas extrañas, una médium les indicó que la muñeca estaba poseída por el espíritu de una niña llamada Annabelle.\nEd y Lorraine se llevaron la muñeca de la casa de la mujer y la mantuvieron bajo llave durante años. Posteriormente, la familia Warren la exhibió en su museo y, en ocasiones, la prestaba para giras como la que realizaba Rivera al momento de su muerte.\nCopyright 2025 Us Weekly.

    "text": "PowerCo, a subsidiary of Volkswagen, launched a hiring campaign Wednesday to begin recruiting thousands of workers for its $7-billion electric vehicle battery plant in St. Thomas. Here are some things to know.\nPowerCo is gearing up to hire for “hundreds of high-quality local jobs,” the company said in a statement, noting it has already doubled its workforce to 200 employees so far this year and aims to a fill a range of positions by year end.\nAn eclectic list of jobs are available to applicants and some of the immediate open positions are building construction leads, IT professionals and engineers as well as sustainability experts.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW “As (PowerCo) grows from 200 to hundreds more people, it’s really the next step towards the huge ramp-up that’s going to happen as we get closer to initial production,” said Sean Dyke, chief executive of the St. Thomas Economic Development Corporation.\nApplicants can find employment opportunities on PowerCo’s website and submit applications for multiple job openings.\nJake Roseman, speaking on behalf of PowerCo, said job listings are open for applications on the company’s website and jobseekers should expect more postings.\n“We have already listed dozens of job openings on our website, and we are looking to fill hundreds more this year,” Roseman said in an email statement.\nThe PowerCo statement said that recruitment efforts would be ramped up in the months ahead through multiple channels, including an advertising blitz on billboards from St. Thomas to London.\nThe plant is expected to employ several thousand employees once fully operational.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW In its statement, PowerCo reiterated the electric vehicle battery plant is on pace to open in 2027.\nAlthough there’s been activity on the site in northeast St. Thomas, PowerCo said the factory would break ground “in the coming weeks.”\nDyke said the opening of the factory is key to creating employment opportunities beyond the electric vehicle battery and automotive industries.\n“Spin-offs can range far and wide, right from direct suppliers to indirect and then, of course, all the way down to restaurants and dry cleaners,” Dyke said.\n“We’re really excited about what’s going to happen here in the future. And I think the future is getting a lot closer, just with announcements like this one . . . From our perspective as a municipality, I think it’s important for people to know that St. Thomas is a great place to work and to live.”\nSt. Thomas Mayor Joe Preston called PowerCo’s hiring push “incredible” for the city, noting the company is a part of a “great industry.”\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Preston said he hasn’t doubted the electric vehicle plant’s opening in St. Thomas despite concerns about the impact of tariffs. He said the employment announcement would help alleviate unease stemming from U.S. imposed levies.\n“PowerCo has been out front saying this is still moving forward in a big way,” Preston said. “PowerCo is pretty happy in St. Thomas, and this shows that they continue to hire great professionals from across Canada and even around the world to work here in St. Thomas at this very large industrial facility.”\nFor those who are interested in applying for a position at PowerCo, visit http://powerco.ca and click “Join us.”\nbwilliams@postmedia.com\nONTARIO NOW NEWSLETTER Get our free new weekly newsletter Error!

    "text": "HELENA, Mont. — It’s the final stretch for a bill that would fund increases to beginning teacher pay in Montana. Having passed the House and with one more vote left in the Senate, the Student and Teacher Advancement for Results and Success Act – the STARS Act – may soon become law.\nSchool districts could then choose to dip into funds created by the act, yearly pools of up to about $350,000 depending on district enrollment.\nSen. John Fuller, R-Kalispell, is carrying the bill through the Senate and said during debate on the bill on Tuesday that it’s worth the price tag.\n“Some of you may know that I'm so tight, I squeak when I walk, but I do support public education and I support it fiercely.”\nTo qualify for funding in the coming fiscal year, districts would have to pay educators a salary that is at least 62% of 2025’s average teacher pay.\nBox Elder Democrat Sen. Jonathan Windy Boy agreed that $55 million in estimated yearly spending seemed steep, but it’s a step in the right direction.\n“This is an issue that we have been looking at on the interim, sitting on the interim budget committee. And I think that the shortfalls that school districts across the state have been experiencing in this last interim. This will help. Probably [will] not make it whole, but at least put back some of the shortfalls that the school districts have been experiencing.”\nThe bill has been referred to the Senate Finance and Claims Committee where lawmakers will discuss how the bill impacts the state’s two-year budget.\nClayton Murphy is a reporter with the UM Legislative News Service, a partnership of the University of Montana School of Journalism, the Montana Broadcasters Association, the Montana Newspaper Association and the Greater Montana Foundation.

    "text": "La Sierra Madre del Sur marca el límite de una de las regiones más violentas del país,\nTierra Caliente: hogar de autodefensas, lugar de nacimiento de miles de desplazados a causa de la violencia y zona de disputa entre el Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG) y otros -cuando menos 10 grupos criminales- que se disputan el control territorial.

En 2022, sólo en la región de Michoacán, tres mil personas huyeron de Tierra Caliente, según datos del Informe de Derechos Humanos de EEUU.\n[Te puede interesar: Vinculan a proceso a 9 presuntos integrantes de “Operativa Barredora” del CJNG en Puebla](/mexico/2023/12/26/vinculan-a-proceso-a-9-presuntos-integrantes-de-operativa-barredora-del-cjng-en-puebla/)\nEn las últimas dos décadas han aparecido diversos grupos criminales que protagonizaron diversos enfrentamientos contra pobladores y otros cárteles por el dominio de la región: La Familia Michoacana, Los Caballeros Templarios, el Cártel del Golfo, Los Zetas y el CJNG los de mayor fuerza.\nSin embargo, también se tiene identificada la presencia de grupo locales que se separaron de organizaciones más grandes o que nacieron de levantamientos armados para defenderse de otros grupos: los cárteles de Los Correa, Los Reyes, Zicuarán, Pueblos Unidos, Tepalcatepec, Los Ardillos, Los Rojos, Los Tlacos, Cárteles Unidos y La Nueva Empresa son sólo algunos ejemplos.\nEl CJNG por el dominio de Tierra Caliente\nTepalcatepec, municipio michoacano colindante con Jalisco, ardió esta semana a manos de ataques orquestados por presuntos integrantes del CJNG contra puestos de control de Cárteles Unidos; autos incendiados, bloqueos carreteros y balaceras provocaron el terror entre los habitantes de Tierra Caliente.\n[Te puede interesar: Aseguran tigre y jaguar en inmueble del CJNG en Ixtlahuacán del Río, Jalisco](/mexico/2023/12/27/aseguran-tigre-y-jaguar-en-inmueble-del-cjng-en-ixtlahuacan-del-rio-jalisco/)\nPero los enfrentamientos de los hombres de “El Mencho” contra los grupos que defienden Tierra Caliente no son nuevos pues el\nCJNG ha intentado en más de una ocasión ganar terreno en Michoacán y avanzar hacía los municipios que le garanticen el dominio de las rutas que conectan los puertos de Lázaro Cárdenas y Acapulco con el Estado de México y la Ciudad de México.\nPor lo anterior, a mediados de 2023 hicieron circular un video en el que advertían su llegada a los municipios michoacanos de Nueva Italia, Huacana y Gabriel Zamora; el objetivo, “limpiar” la zona de Tierra Caliente con la presunta ayuda de Los Viagras.\nY es que después de la muerte de Hipólito Mora -el ex líder de las autodefensas en Michoacán- las organizaciones criminales que se aliaron para frenar el paso del CJNG por Tierra Caliente (Los Viagras, desertores de La Familia Michoacana y Caballeros Templarios) se separaron para un nuevo acomodo de los cárteles en la zona, según reportes de seguridad federal.\nSe presume que algunas facciones de Los Viagras pactaron con “El Mencho” para ganar terreno en Tierra Caliente y quitarle el dominio a La Familia Michoacana, en la región de Guerrero y Estado de México, además de permitir la expansión de los de Jalisco por los municipios de Apatzingán, Tepalcatepec y La Huacana, entre otros.\nDominar Tierra Caliente para el CJNG representaría tener el control total de la ruta hacia Lázaro Cárdenas, el puerto por donde llegan la mayoría de los precursores químicos utilizados para la fabricación de drogas sintéticas; además de apoderarse de los negocios relacionados con extorsiones, cobro de piso y secuestro que los grupos locales han controlado por años para financiar sus operaciones y hacer frente al poder de “El Mencho”.\nMás Noticias\n[Estas sustancias bioactivas han sido estudiadas recientemente y los beneficios a la salud parecen ser prometedores](/mexico/2023/12/28/que-son-los-posbioticos-y-por-que-podrian-ser-clave-para-la-prevencion-y-tratamiento-del-covid/)\nQué son los posbióticos y por qué podrían ser clave para la prevención y tratamiento del covid\n[La dependencia alertó a los consumidores por venta ilegal de estos tres componentes](/mexico/2023/12/28/estos-son-los-tres-medicamentos-oncologicos-que-cofepris-senalo-por-presuntas-falsificaciones/)\nEstos son los tres medicamentos oncológicos que COFEPRIS señaló por presuntas falsificaciones\n[Actualizaciones e información sobre el estatus del servicio en la red a lo largo de este jueves](/mexico/2023/12/28/metro-y-metrobus-cdmx-hoy-noticias-retrasos-avances-y-fallas-en-las-lineas-este-28-de-diciembre/)\nMetro y Metrobús CDMX hoy: noticias, retrasos, avances y fallas en las líneas este 28 de diciembre\n[La fecha límite para obtener el monto económico se recorrerá hasta enero del 2024](/mexico/2023/12/28/mujeres-grandeza-donde-cobrar-el-apoyo-de-la-tarjeta-rosa-en-el-centro-de-mexico/)\nMujerEs Grandeza: dónde cobrar el apoyo de la ‘tarjeta rosa’ en el centro de México\n[El cantante, músico y compositor panameño volverá a México después de más de cuatro años de ausencia](/mexico/2023/12/28/esta-es-la-fortuna-de-ruben-blades-el-salsero-que-recibira-el-ano-nuevo-2024-con-concierto-en-la-cdmx/)",
