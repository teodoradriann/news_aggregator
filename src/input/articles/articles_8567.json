    "text": "In this guide, we’ve focused on compact fitness devices, with and without displays, that deliver a range of health and fitness features designed to match their streamlined form factors.\nYou won’t find smartwatches here; for those, take a look at our comprehensive best smartwatches list —especially if you’re an iPhone owner. While we did include a smart ring in this lineup, we also have an in-depth guide specifically for smart rings if you’re looking for a deeper dive into that category.\nAs of November 2024, our top picks for fitness trackers are the Whoop 4.0, Garmin Vivosmart 5, Fitbit Charge 6, and RingConn Smart Ring. The U.S. fitness tracker market is highly competitive, with each of these brands catering to specific user needs. Fitbit stands out with its mass-market appeal, offering accessible health tracking. Garmin shines among outdoor and fitness-focused users, thanks to its durable build and advanced workout capabilities.\nThe Whoop has carved out a niche with its subscription-based model, delivering data-driven performance insights tailored for athletes. Meanwhile, RingConn is making strides in the smart ring segment, appealing to users seeking a discreet approach to health tracking.\nWith an expected annual growth rate of 18.9% , the fitness tracker market shows no signs of slowing down. Let’s dive into what each device brings to the table and why they’ve earned a place on our list.\n1. Editor’s Choice: Whoop 4.0 The Whoop 4.0 redefines the concept of a “fitness tracker.” It skips smartwatch features entirely—no display, no clock, and no frills. The only feedback you get is from a vibrating alarm and an LED battery indicator. Whoop isn’t trying to be a smartwatch; it’s laser-focused on tracking.\nLightweight, compact, and incredibly durable, the Whoop 4.0 is built to be worn anywhere, anytime. Its electronics are safely housed in a comfortable band for your wrist or upper arm, with alternative mounts available, including boxer shorts and sports bras, if you want completely free arms.\nThe Whoop 4.0 wristband doesn’t stay that pristine white for long. © nextpit\nThe Whoop 4.0 is a fitness tracker that really does just that: track your fitness. © nextpit\nOn the back of the Whoop Fitness Tracker, there is a PPG sensor. © nextpit\nOn the wrist, the Whoop 4.0 is completely wrapped in a strap and buckle and is therefore well protected. © nextpit\nThe battery pack holds well on the Whoop 4.0 and does not interfere with everyday use. © nextpit\nDesigned for 24/7 tracking, the Whoop 4.0 has a unique charging system: no need to remove it to charge. Just slide on a compatible power bank while wearing it, and it recharges seamlessly.\nThe real highlight, though, is Whoop’s in-depth analytics. It continuously tracks vital data, from pulse and sleep to heart rate variability, and syncs with the app where you can log lifestyle habits. From here, the Whoop 4.0 correlates this data to deliver deep insights—and it even includes an AI coach you can consult on your health.\nOne catch: you can’t just buy the Whoop 4.0. It’s available only through subscription, costing $17–$30 per month, which adds up over time. However, with a subscription lasting at least six months, you’ll receive new models as they’re released at no extra cost.\nSummary\nBuy\nGood\nIt can be worn in various ways Comprehensive analysis functions ChatGPT’s integration is more than just a toy Accurate stress analysis No display Bad\nDoes not support chest straps Long-term expensive subscription model No display Go to review\n2. Best Fitness Option: Garmin vivosmart 5 The Garmin Vivosmart 5 is a solid upgrade in the fitness tracker space, balancing simplicity with powerful features. With a 66% larger display than the Vivosmart 4, it’s easier to read and operate, combining a responsive touchscreen with a physical button for seamless control. Lightweight and customizable, it’s available in three colors (black, white, cool mint) and two sizes with a replaceable band.\nThe Vivosmart 5 includes the best workout features Garmin has to offer. © nextpit\nLightweight and comfortable design of the Garmin Vivosmart 5 Fitness Tracker © nextpit\nThe charging port is the same as on the predecessor. © nextpit\nThe display has been enlarged by 66 percent. © nextpit\nClose-up view of the Garmin Vivosmart 5 fitness bracelet. © nextpit Packed with health metrics, the Vivosmart 5 monitors 24/7 heart rate, sleep (with a new sleep score), respiration, stress, and Body Battery energy levels. There’s also women’s health tracking, hydration reminders, and weather updates, plus music control and text reply (Android only). The battery lasts up to 7 days, or 5 with sleep oxygen tracking enabled and recharges with Garmin’s standard cable.\nSafety features stand out, with water resistance, emergency contact alerts, incident detection, and Live Track location sharing. Fitness buffs will appreciate added activity profiles like HIIT, Pilates, and breath work, plus connected GPS via smartphone. With updated heart rate sensors for better accuracy, it handles everything from strength training to cycling with ease.\nThe best part? The Vivosmart 5 doesn’t require a subscription for full access, making it a compelling, tech-forward choice for serious tracking without the hassle.\nSummary\nBuy\nGood\nGreat app with diverse information Reliable pulse and SpO2 tracking High quality processing No subscription necessary Bad\nNo integrated GPS Monochrome OLED display Battery life with 24h SpO2 tracking is quite short Not compatible with Garmin accessories Go to review\n 3. Best Battery Life: Fitbit Charge 6 The Fitbit Charge 6 is a powerful upgrade, packed with Google integrations and a refined feature set at an attractive $159 price. With a reintroduced physical button and a new AI-enhanced heart rate sensor (drawing from Google Pixel Watch tech), it’s more accurate and easier to use. It even supports heart rate broadcasting for third-party apps, though encryption limits some compatibility.\nActivity tracking is extensive, with 40 sport modes and no need to preselect—just pick from the band on the go. The Charge 6 syncs with Google services for a seamless experience, offering YouTube Music controls, Google Maps directions right on your wrist, and contactless payments with Google Wallet.\nThe 1-inch OLED display of the Fitbit Charge 6 is one of the strong points of the tracker. © nextpit\nSensors on the sides make it possible to measure the stress level and create an ECG. © nextpit\nThe button on the side is not a “real” button, but it works with gloves! © nextpit\nThe heart rate sensor is said to have been improved, albeit with AI features. When is the update coming to the Charge 5, Google? © nextpit\nThe charger is still simple, but proprietary. © nextpit Fitbit’s UI is polished, with customizable watch faces and intuitive swipe controls. Accessibility features include a zoom magnifier, and the battery lasts up to 7 days. However, be aware of minor GPS inconsistencies and the need to convert to a Google account for full functionality.\nOverall, the Charge 6 is ideal for users who want Google integrations and reliable health tracking in a sleek, everyday band. At this price, it’s a smart pick for both new and upgrading users, though not a dedicated sports watch.\nSummary\nBuy\nGood\nNice design with a very good display Easy to wear and is comfortable Contains many fitness functions Finally able to pass vital data to third-party manufacturers Bad\nBattery life disappointed in the review Inaccurate GPS module with a 10% deviation Still too expensive and with a premium subscription Leaves “bite marks” on the wrist Go to review\n4. Best for Sleep: RingConn Gen 1 The RingConn Smart Ring is a sleek, health-focused wearable designed for comprehensive biometric tracking without the extras of a smartwatch. At $199, it offers in-depth health insights through a user-friendly app, with no subscription required, making it a competitive choice for dedicated health monitoring.\nCrafted from lightweight titanium with a matte Midnight Black finish, the RingConn ring is available in nine sizes, with a sizing kit included for the perfect fit. Its flat-edged, circular design keeps it comfortable and discreet, though the surface can be prone to scratching. It’s built primarily for health tracking, not fitness or phone connectivity, so there’s no NFC or GPS, and the workout modes are in beta and require a connected phone.\nThe RingConn Smart Ring provides advanced health tracking in a sleek, discreet design. © nextpit\nRingConn Gen 1 is built on titanium and it’s one of the lightest smart rings. © nextpit\nThe RingConn Smart Ring charging case is compact and can hold a charge for up to 150 days. © nextpit\nThe charging connectors are located at the bottom of the ring. © nextpit\nThe RingConn Smart Ring companion app provides insightful information about our health metrics, and for more details, it allows you to dive deep into each metric. © nextpit Yet, the RingConn excels in wellness tracking, with advanced sleep analysis, heart rate variability (HRV), SpO2, and skin temperature monitoring. Its app integrates smoothly with Apple Health and Google Fit, providing users with wellness scores and detailed insights into their daily activity, stress levels, and overall balance. However, the device lacks an open API and browser-based data exports, with data securely stored on UK servers for GDPR compliance.\nWith a 7-day battery life and an ingenious travel charging case capable of 150 days of charges, RingConn is perfect for on-the-go health tracking. Overall, it’s an impressive tool for wellness monitoring, but if you’re seeking a true fitness tracker or smartwatch capabilities, this ring might not fully meet those needs just yet.\nSummary\nBuy\nGood\nComfortable and lightweight Comprehensive and user-friendly app interface Impressive 7-day battery life Ingenious travel charging case No subscription fee Bad\nFitness tracking features are still under development Go to review\nWhat to Consider When Choosing a Fitness Tracker From step tracking to heart-rate monitoring, fitness trackers provide valuable insights that motivate and support healthier habits. With so many options out there, though, finding the right fit for your needs can be a challenge. To help guide your decision, here are some key factors to consider when choosing a fitness tracker:\nGPS: Do You Need It, or Is Your Smartphone Enough? If you keep your smartphone with you during workouts—perhaps for safety or to stream music—you can skip GPS on your fitness tracker. Most trackers can sync with your phone to log distance and route data accurately, relying on the phone’s typically more precise GPS. But if you prefer leaving your phone behind while running or cycling, then a tracker with built-in GPS is worth considering. When a device includes this feature, we’ll highlight it for you.\nMusic Control vs. Music Player It’s easy to confuse music control with music player features in fitness trackers. A built-in music player lets you download songs directly to the device, allowing you to listen without needing your smartphone. Connect Bluetooth or wireless earbuds, and you’re good to go. Meanwhile, a tracker with music control simply lets you manage music already playing on your smartphone, keeping your hands free.\nIs the SpO2 Sensor Necessary? Tracking blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) seems appealing, but unless you’re training at high altitudes or engaging in intense endurance sports, it might not be essential. Healthy individuals usually have stable blood oxygen levels, so this feature can be more relevant for specialized activities. Not all trackers offer SpO2 sensors, so think about your needs before prioritizing this feature.\nThe Fitbit app displays your data nicely. / © nextpit\nSleep Tracking and Mindfulness Tools Fitness isn’t just about the activity—it’s also about recovery. Sleep tracking is one of the most practical features in fitness trackers, measuring sleep quality and duration across light, deep, and REM phases. Many trackers also provide mindfulness tools, like guided breathing or meditation exercises, using heart rate data to encourage relaxation and better recovery.\nHardware Compatibility For users who want deeper monitoring during activities like martial arts or gymnastics, compatibility with additional hardware, such as heart-rate chest straps, can be a valuable feature. Garmin and Huawei, for instance, offer options to pair with external sensors for more precise metrics. Garmin’s HRM-Run models, for example, can capture specific movement data like ground contact time.\nAdditional Features: Notifications, Payments, Calls As fitness trackers blend with smartwatch capabilities, newer models offer advanced features like contactless payments, call capabilities, and notification responses. Although less common, these extras are increasingly available, so if you’re looking for more smartwatch-like functionality, consider a model that supports these additions.\nMaterials, Case, and Weight Your fitness tracker’s design isn’t just about aesthetics—materials and weight affect comfort and durability. Plastic, fabric, or leather straps each come with pros and cons depending on the activity. Fabric bands, for example, may feel uncomfortable when wet, while plastic bands can be more water-resistant. If possible, try on a model in-store to check for comfort. Most trackers offer replaceable bands, but weight and dimensions are set.",

Sorti, l’athlète a assumé son acte devant les médias et présenté ses excuses. Une erreur qui va lui coûter très cher. Membre de l’équipe australienne de hockey sur gazon, Thomas Craig a vu son aventure de Paris 2024 tourner au cauchemar. Mercredi, Craig a été mis en garde à vue après avoir été surpris à acheter de la cocaïne auprès d‘un dealer présumé mineur dans le 9e arrondissement de Paris. Selon Sydney Morning Herald , le joueur s’en est sorti avec un avertissement et sans amende.\nDésormais libéré de sa garde à vue, l'Australien a assumé son erreur face aux médias, tout en assurant que ses coéquipiers éliminés en quarts de finale face aux Pays-Bas dimanche dernier n’ont rien à avoir avec cela: \"J'ai fait une terrible erreur. J'assume l'entière responsabilité de mes actes. Mes actions sont les miennes et ne reflètent en aucun cas les valeurs de ma famille, de mes coéquipiers, de mes amis, de mon sport et de l'équipe olympique australienne”, a-t-il exprimé. \"Je vous ai tous mis dans l’embarras. Je suis vraiment désolé.\"\n\"Une telle décision a des conséquences\" Chef de mission de l’équipe australienne durant les Jeux olympiques, Anna Meares a annoncé des sanctions à l’encontre du hockeyeur: \"Je ne peux pas approuver ce que Tom a fait. C'est une bonne personne qui a pris une mauvaise décision.

    "text": "You've probably heard of Oura's smart rings before, one of the best sleep and recovery trackers, but a new player entered the ring this July: Samsung. It's the first time a big tech company has produced a smart ring, the Samsung Galaxy Ring. As the name implies, it's mostly geared to Samsung users, although any Android user can use it with some limitations. Right now, the Samsung Galaxy Ring is $327.99 (originally $399.99), the lowest price it has reached since its recent release, according to price-checking tools. Samsung Galaxy Ring AI Smart Ring, Size First w\\/Sizing Kit, No App Subscription, Fitness Monitor, Sleep Tracker... $327.99 at Amazon $399.99 Save $72.00 Get Deal Get Deal $327.99 at Amazon $399.99 Save $72.00 Samsung's Galaxy Ring isn't a one-time gadget it threw at the wall to see if it would stick: it's a well-made health-monitoring product that is likely to have improved generations in the future. But as a first-generation smart ring, it's solid, according to PCMag's review, as long as you have a Samsung phone to get the most out of it. It is a solid health and sleep tracker, but the activity tracking is better left to smartwatches. The Galaxy Ring has a titanium finish with color options including gold, silver, and black. Like Oura rings, it’s a bit bulky compared to regular rings at 7 mm wide and 2.6 mm thick. Anyone wearing it can see their sleep, heart rate, and skin temperature, but Samsung users can control their phone’s camera or dismiss alarms by tapping their ring finger to their thumb twice in a row. The best part of the ring compared to the main competition, Oura rings, is that it's subscription-free. It also has a wireless charging case included and is IP68 water resistant so you can wash your hands or shower with it. The battery life will give you about six days of use and you can choose from a size five to 13. If your Android phone can run the Samsung Health app, it's compatible with the ring. If you want to access a feature called Energy Score, which gives you a score on your energy level based on sleep, diet, and activity, you'll need a Samsung phone.",

    "text": "Pourquoi c'est important TikTok sur le point d’être banni des États-Unis ?\nJour de vérité pour TikTok aux États-Unis. La Cour suprême doit examiner ce vendredi la constitutionnalité d’une [loi prévoyant son interdiction le 19 janvier prochain](%20/faits-divers-justice/2024/12/18/la-cour-supreme-va-statuer-sur-une-loi-menacant-d-interdire-tiktok). S’il veut continuer d’opérer chez l’oncle Sam, le réseau social détenu par le [géant chinois ByteDance]( /economie/2024/03/14/tiktok-interdit-six-questions-sur-bytedance-la-maison-mere-du-reseau-social) n’a plus vraiment le choix : soit la plus haute juridiction du pays lui donne gain de cause, soit sa maison mère devra vendre ses activités américaines. Et ce, en vertu du “Pafaca”, une loi votée en avril dernier par le Congrès.\nLe texte, soutenu aussi bien par des démocrates que des républicains, répond à des préoccupations de sécurité nationale, sur fond de guerre commerciale avec la Chine. L’administration Biden n’a jamais fourni de preuves d’une ingérence de Pékin à travers l’application de vidéos courtes. Ce qui n’empêche pas de nombreux élus de redouter une manipulation de son algorithme à des fins de propagande et un transfert des données personnelles des utilisateurs aux autorités chinoises. TikTok nie en bloc ces accusations et ByteDance refuse de céder sa poule aux œufs d’or, au motif que cela serait impossible « technologiquement, commercialement ou légalement ». Mais jusqu’ici, ils ont été déboutés de tous leurs recours en justice. Leur dernier espoir repose sur les juges – en majorité conservateurs – de la Cour suprême.\nTrump retourne sa veste\nCe vendredi, ils entendront les arguments de la plateforme, selon laquelle la loi “Pafaca” bafoue le premier amendement, garantissant la liberté d’expression. Les dirigeants de TikTok ne sont d’ailleurs pas les seuls à penser que « le Congrès des États-Unis a adopté une restriction massive et sans précédent de la liberté de parole » : plusieurs associations, dont Amnesty International et la puissante Union américaine pour les libertés civiles, estiment qu’une interdiction du réseau social serait disproportionnée.\nFait rare, [Donald Trump](/p/donald-trump) partage cet avis. Après avoir voulu bannir TikTok pendant son premier mandat, le milliardaire a opéré un virage à 360 degrés au cours de la [dernière élection présidentielle](/elections/elections-americaines). Bien conscient que le réseau social lui a permis de se faire entendre des jeunes, il a avoué avoir un « faible » pour TikTok et vouloir le « sauver ». Il a même récemment rencontré son PDG, Shou Zi Chew, dans sa résidence privée en Floride.\nLe problème, c’est que la date butoir pour TikTok survient la veille de son arrivée à la Maison Blanche. Fin décembre, ses avocats ont donc [demandé à la Cour suprême de suspendre l’entrée en vigueur de la loi](/politique/2024/12/28/donald-trump-s-adresse-a-la-cour-supreme-pour-secourir-tik-tok), le temps que le républicain résolve la situation « par des moyens politiques ». La juridiction accédera-t-elle à sa demande ? Jugera-t-elle la loi contraire ou conforme à la Constitution américaine ? Si cette dernière hypothèse se vérifie, ByteDance acceptera-t-il de se séparer de TikTok ?\nImpossible de télécharger ou mettre à jour l’appli\nL’homme d’affaires américain Frank McCourt, propriétaire de l’Olympique de Marseille, a déjà manifesté son intérêt. Mais pour Vincent Lefrere, maître de conférences en économie numérique à l’Institut Mines-Télécom, « il n’y aura pas de vente car ce serait un signe de désaveu pour la Chine ». Si la Cour suprême déboute TikTok, Apple et Google pourraient donc être contraints, d’ici une dizaine de jours, de retirer l’application de leur boutique respective.\nDans un tel cas de figure, « TikTok ne disparaîtrait pas des téléphones américains tout de suite », nuance Vincent Lefrere : il ne serait plus possible de télécharger l’application, ni de la mettre à jour, mais rien n’obligerait les Américains à la désinstaller. Reste à savoir « à quel point les utilisateurs resteront fidèles, malgré les coûts d’entrée qui vont être de plus en plus élevés », complète l’enseignant.\nUne interdiction constituerait en tout cas « un coup dur » pour TikTok, qui revendique 170 millions d’utilisateurs actifs aux États-Unis, soit la moitié de la population. En 2024, ce marché lui a permis de récolter 12,3 milliards de dollars (11,93 milliards d'euros) en revenus publicitaires. Les créateurs de contenus américains, qui gagnent au total 300 millions de dollars par an avec leurs vidéos, seraient eux aussi perdants. À long terme, un bannissement pourrait aussi provoquer « un manque de confiance des investisseurs étrangers », voire accroître « la guerre commerciale » sino-américaine si Pékin décide de réagir, avance Vincent Lefrere.\nD’autres pays ont déjà franchi le pays\nSi la Cour suprême valide la loi qui doit entrer en vigueur le 19 janvier prochain, les États-Unis ne seraient pas le premier pays à prohiber TikTok. Le réseau social est banni en Inde depuis 2020 et a rapidement été remplacé par des plateformes alternatives. Plus récemment, c’est l’Albanie qui a décidé d’interdire TikTok pour un an. En Europe, la Commission européenne n’autorise pas ses employés à télécharger l’application sur leur téléphone. En France aussi, les fonctionnaires d’État n’ont pas le droit de l’utiliser. Au printemps 2024, les autorités ont même bloqué pendant deux semaines le réseau social en Nouvelle-Calédonie, alors que des émeutes et blocages secouaient l’archipel.",
