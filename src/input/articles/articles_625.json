    "title": "The warmest December in Lafayette County history",
    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Lafayette County, Missouri from 1901-2000 was 31.1. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Lafayette County, Missouri experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Lafayette County, Missouri history.",

    "text": "SEOUL — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un urged his party to \"accelerate\" war preparations including its nuclear programme, state media said on Thursday.\nThe comments came just a week after Kim warned Pyongyang would not hesitate to launch a nuclear attack if \"provoked\" with nukes.\nKim made the comments at the North's ongoing year-end party meeting, where he is expected to unveil key policy decisions for 2024.\nKim asked the party to \"further accelerate the war preparations\" across sectors, including nuclear weapons and civil defence, Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency reported.\nHe also stressed that the \"military situation\" on the Korean Peninsula had become \"extreme\" due to \"unprecedented\" anti-North confrontations with Washington.\nSeoul, Tokyo and Washington have ramped up defence cooperation in the face of a record-breaking series of weapons tests by Pyongyang this year and recently activated a system to share real-time data on North Korean missile launches.\nEarlier this month, a US nuclear-powered submarine arrived in the South Korean port city of Busan, and Washington flew its long-range bombers in drills with Seoul and Tokyo.\nThe North has previously described the participation of US strategic assets, such as B-52 bombers, in joint drills on the Korean peninsula as the \"intentional nuclear war provocative moves of the US\".\nPyongyang this year successfully launched a reconnaissance satellite, enshrined its status as a nuclear power in its constitution, and test-fired the most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile in its arsenal.\nKim earlier this week defined 2023 as a “year of great turn and great change” in which Pyongyang saw “eye-opening victories”.\nLast week, the United Nations atomic agency said a second reactor at North Korea’s Yongbyon nuclear facility appeared to be operational, calling it “deeply regrettable”.\n‘Nuclear confrontation’\nAt last year’s year-end party meeting, Kim had called “for an exponential increase of the country’s nuclear arsenal”.\nThe United States and South Korea earlier this month held the second meeting of their Nuclear Consultative Group in Washington, where they discussed nuclear deterrence options in the event of conflict with the North.\nThey warned that any nuclear attack from Pyongyang on the United States or South Korea would result in the end of the Kim regime.\nA spokesperson for North Korea’s defence ministry then slammed the allies’ plans to expand annual joint military exercises next year to include a nuclear operation drill, calling it “an open declaration on nuclear confrontation”.\nPyongyang declared itself an “irreversible” nuclear power last year and has repeatedly said it will never give up its nukes programme, which the regime views as essential for its survival.\nThe United Nations Security Council has adopted many resolutions calling on North Korea to halt its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes since it first conducted a nuclear test in 2006.",

    "text": "Nobody was more surprised than\nHolly Brisleyto find out that her daughter Willow wanted to be an actress like her famous mum.\nEven though she began her own career at a similar age, she was still taken aback when her 11-year-old sports-mad daughter caught the acting bug!\n\"I'm definitely not a stage mum,\" Holly, best known for starring on Argo's Cartoon Connection tells Woman's Day.\n\"But I do think it's nice to give options, especially because there is access to it. If it's something she wants to do, and from the sounds of Willow speaking to you just now, it's definite she wants to try and do more.\"Holly and Willow opened up about the unusual experience of working together on new crime thriller movie Kane, revealing that it was a wonderful bonding experience.\n\"I'm playing Sofia and Willow is playing Mia – and they're mum and daughter,\" says Holly.\n\"It was nice to do it with Willow, and being one of the producers, I could be her guardian, chaperone and caretaker on set. \"\n\"It was just nice to watch her see things through fresh eyes. It was similar to how I felt the first time I went on a film set – just watching the awe and the wonder.\"\n\"To see it firsthand was nice for me as a mum.\"\nHolly, 45, was just a year older than Willow is now when she started her own acting career, landing roles in the Australian telemovies The Flood: Who Will Save Our Children and Official Denial, before she shot to national fame presenting Agro's Cartoon Connection in 1994.\n\"It was a great experience, and I now know what to expect next time. I definitely want to be in another film, for sure,\" Willow says, hinting she has already auditioned for another movie to be produced this year.\nIf she mirrors her mum's success, we'll be hearing a lot more about Willow in the years to come.\nAfter her stint on Agro's Cartoon Connection, Holly hosted The Looney Tunes Show and World's Craziest Videos and acted in such films as Garage Days, The Crop and Dynasty: The Making Of A Guilty Pleasure before competing on Dancing With The Stars and landing a coveted role on Home And Away, playing Summer Bay vixen Amanda Vale.\nIt was a near-death experience while climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa that made Holly rethink her entire career.\nThe traumatic ordeal happened during a charity trek just one year after she and her husband, marketing executive Paul Ford, welcomed Willow's older brother Levi, now 14.\nAfter that, Holly took some much-needed time out to be a hands-on mum to Levi and Willow before pivoting into producing films under the banner of Flying Billykart Entertainment.\nHer first venture, drama comedy Ruby's Choice – starring legendary British actress Jane Seymour and Aussie actress Jacqueline McKenzie – was a great success.\nHolly's latest offering is much grittier. Kane is a dark story set in Brisbane and focused on Abe, a violent crime boss with multiple personalities played by Sea Patrol star Jeremy Lindsay Taylor.\nHolly plays his wife Sofia and Willow plays their young daughter Mia.\n\"Kane is Abe's worst version of himself, and when he's unhinged, it unleashes the monster side of him.\"The actress says she shielded Willow from the violent scenes, other than letting her watch a building being blown up for one scene!\n\"Her scenes were cute, but it is an R-rated movie, so she hasn't seen it,\" Holly explains.\n\"We had a little screening up here and I let her watch her own scenes, but then she wasn't allowed to watch the rest of the movie. She will have to wait until she is much older to watch the whole thing!\"\nHolly says she was concerned Willow might find it confusing relating to a screen dad, particularly when he kissed her real-life mum in one scene.\nBut Willow insists she was fine with the make-believe, and loved getting acting tips from Jeremy.\nFor now, Willow, who made her acting and singing debut in her school's musical, is happy turning socks into jackets for her new bearded dragon and playing touch footy and soccer with Levi and her cousins.\n\"I'm so proud of her,\" says Holly.",
