    "text": "Summary: Adult neurogenesis, the creation of new brain cells, supports verbal learning and memory. Using brain tissue from epilepsy patients, researchers discovered a direct link between fewer immature brain cells and cognitive decline, particularly in verbal learning and memory.\nThis work highlights the potential for therapies like exercise or drugs to boost neurogenesis and improve cognitive function in conditions like epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, and aging. The findings underscore the value of studying human brain tissue to uncover insights not visible in animal models.\nKey Facts:\nNeurogenesis slows dramatically during the first 20 years of epilepsy, correlating with declines in verbal learning and memory. Human neurogenesis plays a unique role in verbal learning and memory, unlike visuospatial learning in animals. Boosting neurogenesis could offer therapeutic potential for cognitive decline in epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, and aging. Source: USC\nWhy do adults make new brain cells?\nA new study published in Cell Stem Cell provides the first cellular evidence that making new brain cells in adults supports verbal learning and memory, which enables people to have conversations and to remember what they hear.\nThis discovery could point to new approaches to restore cognitive function.\nThe study, led by scientists from USC Stem Cell and the USC Neurorestoration Center at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, relied on brain tissue from patients with drug-resistant cases of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), which involves seizures as well as accelerated cognitive decline.\n“Treating patients with epilepsy allows us to investigate the purpose of generating new neurons in our brains. We observe that one of reasons is to learn from the conversations we have” said co-corresponding author Michael Bonaguidi, an associate professor of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, gerontology, biochemistry and molecular medicine, biomedical engineering, and neurological surgery, and assistant director of the USC Neurorestoration Center.\n“These findings are clearly important for all people who suffer from learning and cognitive decline, but they are also specifically relevant to the epilepsy patients who participated in the research,” added co-corresponding author Charles Liu, a professor of neurological surgery, neurology, and biomedical engineering, director of the USC Neurorestoration Center, and director of the USC Epilepsy Care Consortium.\nIn the study, first authors Aswathy Ammothumkandy and Luis Corona from USC and their collaborators investigated how the process of making new brain cells—called neurogenesis—affects different types of cognitive decline during the progression of MTLE.\nThe researchers found that MTLE patients experience cognitive decline in many areas including verbal learning and memory, intelligence, and visuospatial skills.\nFor verbal learning and memory, as well as for intelligence, patients undergo a dramatic decline during the first 20 years of seizures. During those same two decades, neurogenesis slows to the point where immature brain cells became nearly undetectable.\nBased on these observations, the scientists searched for links between the number of immature brain cells and the major areas of MTLE-related cognitive decline. They found the strongest association occurs between the declining number of immature brain cells and verbal learning and memory.\nThis is a surprising finding because neurogenesis levels in rodents and other lab animals contribute to a different type of learning and memory using visuospatial skills. The role of neurogenesis in verbal learning and memory highlights the value of studying human brain tissue.\nThese highly valuable surgical specimens were generously donated by patients of the Rancho Los Amigos Epilepsy Center- a unique resource in the public safety-net health system advancing health care and research equity for the underinsured population in the region.\nDuring the complex operations, the neurosurgeons carefully removed the affected hippocampus in one piece, curing the majority of the patients of their seizures.\n“Our study provides the first cellular evidence of how neurogenesis contributes to human cognition—in this case, verbal learning and memory,” said Bonaguidi.\n“This work opens a gateway for future studies exploring ways to improve verbal learning and memory by boosting neurogenesis, possibly through exercise or therapeutic drugs. Those approaches could help not only patients with MTLE, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, but also all of us with aging brains.”\nNeuropsychologist Jason Smith from the Medical University of South Carolina is also a co-corresponding author.

    "text": "Caste Discrimination\nNon-Brahmin priests at Tamil Nadu temple allege they were barred from sanctum sanctorum\nIn a petition to the state government, they accused hereditary Brahmin priests at the temple in Tiruchirappali of denying them equal rights.\nTwo non-Brahmin priests at a temple in Tamil Nadu’s Tiruchirappalli have alleged that hereditary priests have not allowed them to enter the sanctum sanctorum of the presiding deity, The Indian Express reported on Wednesday.\nThe priests, S Prabhu and Jayapal, were appointed in 2021 at the Kumaravayalur Subramania Swamy Temple in Tiruchirappalli as part of an initiative of the Tamil Nadu government to open priesthood to all castes.\nIn a petition to the state government, Prabhu and Jayapal claimed that they had not been allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum of the temple’s main deity, Murugan, even though they had been serving there for three years. They alleged that they have been restricted to conducting rituals only at the secondary shrines at the temple.\nThe priests addressed the petition to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin, Minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments PK Sekar Babu, as well as top officials from the ministry, PTI reported.\nPrabhu and Jayapal told the state government that they had been “completely sidelined” ahead of a consecration on February 19.\nThey said that while devotees at the temple treat them with respect, the hereditary Brahmin priests deny them equal rights.\n“This discrimination has caused us immense mental distress and humiliation,” they said in the petition, according to The Indian Express. “We wonder how we can face our families and our villagers when we are kept away from the very rituals we were appointed to perform.”\nThe state minister for Hindu religious and charitable endowments has not yet commented on the matter.\nSince 2022, a total of 382 persons, including 15 women, have completed government-certified training to become priests. However, only 29 of them have been appointed till now, The Indian Express reported. Another 92 persons are currently undergoing training.\nIn September, the Pattali Makkal Katchi, a constituent of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance, alleged that the Tamil Nadu government had not been able to protect the rights of non-Brahmin priests.\n“Ten out of 24 non-brahmin archakas appointed under the scheme alleged they were not allowed inside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple to perform pujas by the hereditary priests,” party founder S Ramadoss had said, according to The Hindu. “Instead, they were only made to clean the temple premises.”\nletters@scroll.in.",
