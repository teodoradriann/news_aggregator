    "text": "Los Angeles, California--(Newsfile Corp. - December 28, 2023) - Locker Room Insurance is a forward-thinking insurance brokerage co-founded by 2021 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Calvin Johnson Jr. and Rob Sims, his former NFL teammate, along with experienced business executive and licensed insurance agent Craig Freeman. Together, they're on a mission to elevate the insurance industry and reach underserved markets through Locker Room Insurance.\nJohnson Jr. , known for his Hall of Fame football career with the Detroit Lions, has been deeply engaged in community service since childhood, in part because he is the grandchild of a Baptist minister. His dedication led him to establish the Calvin Johnson Jr. Foundation , which has made a difference for nearly 13 years.\n\"The feeling you get from serving people is contagious. It feels great knowing I'm serving my neighbors and providing for families,\" Johnson Jr. said.\nSims , a nine-year NFL veteran who also played with the Lions, shared a similar sentiment. \"We're big on finding solutions that benefit other people. It fills us with excitement to empower those without similar opportunities, enabling them to secure their family's financial future and enhance the community.\"\nLocker Room Insurance\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8798/191320_bd8138025409e9b3_001full.jpg\nFreeman, a mission-driven executive known for his broad business acumen and servant leadership style, is equally excited about the program and its impact on the community.\n\"A quarter of the population doesn't have any type of insurance,\" Freeman observed. \"We want to be able to help. Rob and Calvin have a lot of people they love to help in various ways, but they can't take all of them to the NFL. They might also not be able to help them with other capital-intensive ventures. With insurance, they'll help many agents change their lives and their families' futures through a low barrier entrance, low capital insurance model.\"\nTo get an in-person look at how they operate, apply for an opportunity to attend the Locker Room Insurance launch party in the Detroit area later this year, where they will hosting a NFL Playoff watch party as well as providing a business overview for prospective agents.

    "text": "Hillary Clinton came pretty close to being America’s first female president back in 2016, but of course, lost the electoral vote in the end. But no, she won’t be jealous if Kamala Harris manages to snag that title in November.\nStopping by “The View” to promote her new book “Something Lost, Something Gained” on Thursday morning, the former presidential hopeful reflected on her race against Donald Trump as compared to Harris’.\n“The person I was running against, people didn’t know very much about him,” she recalled. “They’d seen him on TV playing a businessman. They didn’t know about the six bankruptcies, they didn’t know about all the failures, and his character and all the rest of it.”\nAs Clinton and the hosts looked back, host Sunny Hostin admitted she was curious about how Clinton will feel if Harris wins, knowing she came so close herself.\nRead Next\n'The View' Roasts Trump for Taylor Swift Jealousy: 'Next He'll Say She's Eating a Dog' “You are the woman that didn’t crash through the [glass] ceiling, but man, you made a lot of cracks,” Hostin said. “And so I wonder, in reading your book, and you address it a little bit, how will you feel when she wins? Will there be a part of you that feels, ‘Wow, I wish that were me.'”\n“No. Not anymore,” Clinton replied decisively. “Not anymore!”\nShe noted that she finished writing her book before President Joe Biden even stepped down and endorsed Harris, but deliberately went in and added an epilogue to the audiobook version of the memoir when that twist came.\nClinton admitted that she did wonder how she would feel, but when she and husband former President Bill Clinton endorsed Harris just after Biden did, she found she was more excited than anything else.\n“I felt excited, exhilarated, I was literally thrilled. And it was in large measure because I know her, and I’ve been involved with her since she has been vice president, her sister worked for me in 2016, so I’m just so personally fond of her,” she shared. “But also I think she’s the right person for our country at this time.”\n“The View” airs weekdays at 11 a.m. ET on ABC.

    "text": "Paola Muñoz, festejando su triunfo. Foto: Gran Fondo Curacaví.\nEn una disputada final, tanto para mujeres como varones, los destacados ciclistas nacionales Paola Muñoz y Nicolás Cabrera se quedaron con el oro del Gran Fondo Curacaví 2024 by Kross, la carrera de ciclismo más masiva del primer semestre, que en su tercera edición reunió a casi 700 deportistas en un circuito de 120 kilómetros, con partida y meta en la reconocida cervecería Kross.\nLa múltiple medallista nacional y panamericana terminó la prueba en 3.26′45″, superando en el sprint final a la también destacada triatleta Pamela Tastets, quien llegó apenas tres segundos después (3.26′48″) a la meta. El podio lo completó Rosita Marín, con 3.30′11″.\nEn cuanto a la competencia masculina, la definición tuvo que revisarse en el photofinish. Esto, debido a que cinco corredores llegaron juntos a la meta. Ahí, Nicolás Cabrera fue el más veloz, pausando el crono con un destacado tiempo de 2.58′12″042, sólo un par de milésimas de segundo de Claudio Álvarez, que finalizó con 2.58′12″252. Francisco Kotsakis completó el podio, con una marca de 2.58′12″592.\nLa campeona, Paola Muñoz, se mostró contenta frente al resultado, asegurando que “fue un evento espectacular, ver a más de 600 ciclistas tomándonos las calles es algo impactante. Fue un circuito súper amigable, esta carrera tuvo de todo: al principio una gran subida, donde las especialidades se hicieron notar, ahí me fui quedando un poco atrás porque no soy sprinter, pero luego conseguí conectar con un buen pelotón y de ahí me fui a la meta”.\nEl crecimiento\nFernando Almuna, de la productora Epic Rides, destacó que “este año hubo varias mejoras en la carrera y eso es algo que los ciclistas agradecieron. Lo bonito es que esta carrera tiene un carácter familiar, entonces aquí se encuentran no solo los deportistas, sino que todo su entorno”. Además, el organizador de la prueba adelantó que para la próxima edición se está preparando una distancia más corta, para que los corredores que están recién comenzando también puedan participar.\nEl GF Curacaví by Kross este año sumó a Víctor Garrido como director de carrera. “Fue una hermosa carrera, transversal, pero también competitiva. Fue muy entretenida, con corredores muy fuertes y que además contó con gran presencia de mujeres y atletas paralímpicos”, destacó el exciclista.\nAlgo que resaltaron todos los corredores fue la gran cantidad de personas apoyando en las calles. El alcalde de Curacaví, Juan Pablo Barros, aprovechó de agradecer a sus vecinos por vivir de tal forma este evento: “Vivimos una competencia de primer nivel. Estoy muy contento porque nuevamente pudimos mostrar las hermosas rutas de nuestra comuna y posicionarnos un poco más como una de las grandes carreras de ciclismo del primer semestre. Las y los vecinos fueron muy entusiastas, lo que demuestra que en Curacaví vivimos el deporte”.\nSigue en El Deportivo",
