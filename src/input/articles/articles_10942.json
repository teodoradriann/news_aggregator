En las imágenes se puede ver al desarrollador dictando instrucciones al sistema: \" ChatGPT, estamos bajo ataque en el frente izquierdo y derecho. Responda como corresponde \", generando en el rifle una respuesta rápida y precisa al disparar a las paredes cercanas.\nGuy on tiktok ( @sts_3d ) used the #OpenAI realtime api to make a voice controlled smart gun pic.twitter.com/VGGxBkDEv9\n— andrew gao (@itsandrewgao) January 7, 2025 El dispositivo utilizaba la API Realtime de OpenAI para interpretar comandos y transformarlos en instrucciones ejecutables por la máquina. Con un entrenamiento básico, ChatGPT era capaz de procesar órdenes como \"gira a la izquierda\" y traducirlas al lenguaje operativo del aparato. Esta demostración encendió el debate sobre los peligros de la automatización en sistemas letales.\nChatGPT ayudó a planear la explosión del Cybertruck frente al hotel de Trump en Las Vegas En respuesta, OpenAI confirmó que había tomado medidas contra el desarrollador. \"Identificamos de manera proactiva esta violación de nuestras políticas y notificamos al desarrollador para que cese en su actividad\", declaró a Futurism un portavoz de la compañía. Asimismo, recordó que las políticas de uso de OpenAI prohíben explícitamente emplear sus servicios en el desarrollo de armas o sistemas automatizados que puedan poner en riesgo la seguridad personal.\nLa creación de STS 3D, según Futurism, parecía tener un enfoque experimental, pero su rifle automatizado representa una visión inquietante de un futuro en el que las armas controladas por inteligencia artificial podrían usarse para eliminar adversarios sin intervención humana. OpenAI dejó claro que tal uso de su tecnología no está en línea con sus principios ni con las normativas que rigen el desarrollo responsable de la IA.\nArmas Inteligencia artificial Redes Tecnología comentarios You use your browser with disabled JavaScript.

    "title": "Asylum Seeker Murders British Retiree, Cites Gaza Revenge Motive",
    "text": "In a shocking incident that has captured national attention, Ahmed Alid, a 45-year-old asylum seeker from Morocco, was convicted on Thursday for the murder of 70-year-old Terence Carney in Hartlepool, a seaside town in England. The conviction comes in the wake of a brutal attack that occurred on October 15, just days after the onset of the Israel-Hamas war triggered by a Hamas attack on October 7.\nAlid&apos;s violent spree began with him stabbing Carney six times in a public area of Hartlepool, shortly after attacking a sleeping housemate, Javed Nouri. During both assaults, Alid reportedly shouted \"Allahu Akbar,\" an Arabic phrase meaning \"God is great.\" The motivation behind these heinous acts, as stated by Alid to the police, was in retaliation for the people of Gaza, following the recent conflict between Hamas militants and Israel.\nThe court at Teesside Crown Court heard that Alid had expressed a desire to kill more people if he had access to more lethal weaponry. This statement was part of the evidence presented by prosecutor Jonathan Sandiford. In addition to the murder charge, Alid was also found guilty of attempted murder for his attack on Nouri, his housemate. The attack on Nouri was reportedly motivated by Alid&apos;s displeasure towards Nouri&apos;s conversion to Christianity.\nTestimonies from other housemates revealed that Alid&apos;s behavior became increasingly erratic after watching television coverage of the Hamas attacks and Israel&apos;s bombing of Gaza. Nouri recounted to the police how Alid would laugh and praise God upon seeing footage of Hamas killings, which deeply disturbed him.\nDespite complaints to housing officials, the Home Office, and the police about Alid&apos;s behavior and threats, it was only after the attacks that significant action was taken. During his police interview, Alid justified his actions by blaming Britain for its role in creating the state of Israel and equating his murder of an elderly man to Israel&apos;s military actions in Gaza.\nThe situation escalated during his interview when Alid attacked two female detectives. An attempt to use a panic button failed due to malfunction, leading to intervention only after an emergency call was made by Alid&apos;s defense lawyer. This incident led to additional convictions for assaulting the officers.\nDespite acknowledging the stabbings, Alid denied any intent to kill or cause serious harm. His sentencing is scheduled for May 17, concluding a case that has highlighted not only the individual tragedy but also broader issues of radicalization and community safety.\nSathish Raman Oneindia",

Depois de as seis representantes do feminino avançarem, nesta quinta foi a vez de o masculino colocar sete dos oito skatistas na próxima fase, garantindo 13 atletas nacionais na disputa.\nMedalha de bronze nos Jogos Olímpicos de Paris-2024, Augusto Akio, o Japinha, foi beneficiado e não precisou disputar a classificatória, avançando direto. Na pista, outras seis vagas foram definidas, mas sem uma apresentação de destaque como houve no feminino com duas skatistas no top 5.\nPedro Barros é quem garantiu a melhor classificação nas duas voltas disponíveis em Roma, com o nono lugar, seguido por Pedro Carvalho (13º), Luigi Cini (19º), Luiz Francisco (21º), Kalani Konig (22º) e Pedro Quintas (30º).\nBarros se garantiu na segunda volta, na qual somou 76,63 pontos. O xará Pedro Carvalho também alcançou a melhor nota na segunda apresentação, com 72,17. Cini já confirmou a vaga de início, cravando 65,50, assim como Konig, com 63,56 e Quintas, com 58,90. Por fim, Luiz Francisco somou 64,20 na apresentação final.\nO único representante brasileiro a não se garantir nas quartas de final foi Murilo Peres, que teve seu melhor resultado na primeira volta, com 45,65 pontos, insuficientes para garanti um lugar na próxima fase. Ele terminou apenas na 38ª colocação.\nAs quartas ocorrem nesta sexta-feira, a começar com o time brasileiro, representado por Raicca Ventura (2ª), Yndiara Asp (4ª), Sofia Godoy (14ª), Fernanda Tonissi (16ª), Helena Laurino (18ª) e Dora Varella (23ª).

Well, Adobe has a solution that might make you some scratch to put into your camera fund or, if nothing else, buy yourself a nice dinner.\nAdobe is investing heavily in\nFirefly, its generative AI platform, after all the viral buzz of the controversial Sora videos.\nBut, as you can imagine, training generative AI in Firefly is actually pretty hard, especially with all the probable copyright claims that may come where generative AI programs get sued for using other people's work to train programs.\nAdobe needs a way around that, so they're turning to you.\nBloomberg reports that Adobe is “offering its network of photographers and artists 120 dollars to submit videos of people engaged in everyday actions such as walking or expressing emotions including joy and anger, according to documents seen by Bloomberg. The goal is to source assets for artificial intelligence training, the company wrote.”\nAdobe seeks over 100 short video clips showcasing everyday actions, emotions, basic anatomy (feet, hands, eyes), and people using objects like smartphones and fitness gear. Please avoid copyrighted material, nudity, or offensive content.\nSo, how much can you make?\nThe article says you can make $2.60 per minute for the submitted video, although it can range up to as much as $7.25 a minute.\nNow, this may feel like you're training your own replacement... and it's hard to argue with that notion. Hopefully, AI will become a tool that skilled filmmakers are allowed to wield, and not one that takes their jobs.\nLet me know what you think in the comments.\nHow Adobe's AI Brings Crystal-Clear Audio to Your Projects › Why Are Adobe Staff Worried About AI? › How Is Adobe Photoshop’s AI Generative Fill Like a Matte Painting? ›",

    "text": "Vietnam veteran reunited with dog tag he lost nearly 60 years ago LAKE CITY, S.C. (WPDE) - A Vietnam veteran from South Carolina has been reunited with his dog tag that he lost decades ago, thanks to a treasure hunter and the power of social media. Larry Morganti is still stunned the dog tag he lost in a rocket attack nearly 60 years ago is back in his possession. He was the crew chief on a C-123 cargo plane during the Vietnam War as part of the 311th Squadron of the Air Force from October 1967 to October 1968. Morganti recalled that while serving, he once heard a loud bomb and began running for his life. Somewhere in the chaos, he lost his dog tags and later went to his first sergeant for a new pair, thinking little of it. It hadn’t really crossed his mind where the originals might be until a Swedish construction worker named Kristoffer Hansen made contact with him. Hansen saw Morganti’s artwork on a Facebook post for The Vault, a shop that holds works by an array of vendors, and realized he’d been searching for the man for two years. He reached out to store manager Debrah Lane for help contacting Morganti. Hansen said he found one of the veteran’s dog tags with a metal detector. At first, Lane was skeptical of the claim, wary of scammers and hackers, but she says she knew it was real when Hansen provided Morganti’s personal information, such as when and where he served. “I thought, ‘What a wonderful moment that this guy felt the need to return these tags to their original owner’ and the fact that he cared enough to do it,” Lane said. “And the fact that Mr. Larry is still alive is fabulous to me. I just thought that it was the best story that we, as Americans, can hear today.” During an art event where Morganti was being honored, Lane shared the incredible news about his dog tag, bringing chills and tears of joy to all. Morganti himself says he’s still in shock. “It was real surprising. In fact, for a second, I didn’t believe it. It’s such a far-fetched idea to find tags 56 years old and then another two years to bring them to me. He searched, I’m sure, long and hard to find them,” Morganti said. Lane says it was a gift from God that she was able to bridge that gap and make this phenomenal connection. Hansen sent the dog tag to Morganti, along with a letter thanking him for his service, in late April. Copyright 2024 WPDE via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.",
