(Photo by Mahmoud Zaki/Xinhua) GAZA, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has risen to 40,265, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Thursday. During the past 24 hours, the Israeli military killed 42 people and wounded 163 others, bringing the total death toll to 40,265 and injuries to 93,144 since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out, it added. There are still a number of victims trapped under the rubble and scattered on roads, as ambulance and civil defense crews cannot reach them, it said. \"Critical water wells and sanitation infrastructure have been repeatedly damaged throughout the war,\" the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East said on social media platform X on Thursday. \"With overcrowding, lack of hygiene and unbearable heat, access to clean water continues to be a struggle in the Gaza Strip,\" it added. Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in Gaza to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct. 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage.

Lo sottolinea la Cei che mette in guardia: \"Tale rischio non puo' essere sottovalutato, in particolare alla luce delle disuguaglianze gia' esistenti, specialmente nel campo della tutela della salute, cui e' dedicata larga parte delle risorse spettanti alle Regioni e che suscita apprensione in quanto inadeguato alle attese dei cittadini sia per i tempi sia per le modalita' di erogazione dei servizi\". \"Da sempre - afferma la Conferenza episcopale italiana - ci sta a cuore il benessere di ogni persona, delle comunita', dell'intero Paese, mentre ci preoccupa qualsiasi tentativo di accentuare gli squilibri gia' esistenti tra territori, tra aree metropolitane e interne, tra centri e periferie\". \"Non c'e' sviluppo senza solidarieta', attenzione agli ultimi, valorizzazione delle differenze e corresponsabilita' nella promozione del bene comune\", aggiungono i vescovi che rivolgono un appello \"alle Istituzioni politiche affinche' venga siglato un 'patto sociale e culturale' (Evangelii gaudium, 239), perche' si incrementino meccanismi di sviluppo, controllo e giustizia sociale per tutti e per ciascuno\".",

    "text": "This week, the Nikkei and the broad-based Topix surpassed previous records to hit fresh all-time closing highs on Thursday. The Topix notably breached a 34-year record set in December 1989. Jesper Koll, expert director at Tokyo-based financial services company Monex Group, tells CNBC that the current rally is due to a single driver: earnings. Analysts from Nomura however, say that these gains do not look especially sustainable, but could become sustained if corporate earnings surprise to the upside. Japanese stocks have been on a stellar run in 2024.\nIn February , the country’s benchmark Nikkei 225 smashed through its 1989 high .\nThis week, the Nikkei and the broad-based Topix surpassed previous records to hit fresh all-time closing highs on Thursday . The Topix notably breached a 34-year record set in December 1989.\nHow did the markets reach these level, especially for the Nikkei, which has scaled new peaks for the second time this year?\nEarnings are the single driver to the current market rally, Jesper Koll, expert director at Tokyo-based financial services company Monex Group, told CNBC.\n“Corporate Japan is now benefitting from decades of operational restructuring,” Koll said, adding that “breakeven points are at world record lows, so even minimal increases in top-line revenues feed explosive profit growth.”\nHe predicted earnings growth of 35% over the next two financial years — from April 2024 to March 2026 — as well as topline growth of 4% per year.\nHis forecasts stem from a prediction that Japanese companies will see domestic and global sales growth, and he explained that his prediction of a 4% sales growth is due to the wage hikes announced by Japan’s largest union on Thursday.\nJapan’s largest union, commonly referred to as Rengo, announced that Japanese companies have delivered the largest wage hikes in 33 this year.\nMonthly pay for union-backed workers will climb 5.1% on average this fiscal year ending March 2025. Rengo also said big firms with 300 or more union-backed employees raised wages by 5.19%, while smaller firms increased pay by 4.45%.\n“You do not have a shunto [wage hike] of 5% and nominal sales rising less than 4%, for example,” he points out.\nMore importantly, Koll said, Japan is a “bastion of stability.” He pointed out that its monetary, fiscal and regulatory policies are stable and pro-growth, and this acts as an important support for financial markets.\nWhen the Nikkei crossed the 40,000 mark in March, Koll told CNBC at that time that it was “perfectly reasonable” for the index to cross 55,000 points by the end of 2025.\nKoll told CNBC this week: “I stand by my forecast — the Nikkei 225 is poised to climb to 55,000 before the end of next year.”\nIf his prediction comes true, it would be a 37% upside from the 40,000 mark.\nPreviously, Koll had predicted that the Nikkei would cross 40,000 in the twelve months from July 2023. He was later proven right when the index reached that level within eight months.\nHow sustainable is the rally? However, the million dollar question will be: how long can this rally last?\nA note by Nomura, published Thursday, said the gains on the Nikkei and Topix do not look appear sustainable. The analysts identified that these have caused by a short covering in futures.\nThere’s a caveat though.\nThey said “these hasty gains could turn out to be sustained if it starts to look likely that April–June corporate earnings will surprise to the upside or that the Japanese equity market will see more inflows of longer-term money.”\nIn the near term, Nomura said that futures will have “much to say” about the stock movement in Japanese equities, noting that as of 28 June, foreign securities companies’ net short interest in futures amounted to 17,000 contracts.\nIf those short positions were to be unwound, Nomura estimates that the Topix would see a boost of about 2%–3%, from its June 28 levels. By their calculations, it will put the Topix at around 2,875 and the Nikkei 225 at around 40,600.\nBoth indexes have since surpassed Nomura’s estimation, although not by much.\n“We will be watching for whether Japan-listed domestic equity investment trusts/ETFs and U.S.-listed ETFs (which have been seeing outflows) start seeing growing inflows,” the Nomura analysts said.",

There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up.\n“You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water.\n“I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.”\nTwo other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help.\nThey said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident.\nMrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions.\nThe area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.”\nA spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous.\n“Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale.\n“There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm.\n“Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety.\n“The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary.\n“Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.”\nWitnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.",
