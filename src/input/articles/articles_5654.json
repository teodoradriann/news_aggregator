    "title": "What To Pack On A White Water Rafting Trip",
    "text": "If you’re an adventurer seeking a pulse-racing experience, whitewater rafting provides an unparalleled viewpoint of your chosen location. It gives you full immersion into the environment, where you can listen to the wild’s echoes as you traverse famous rivers.\nHowever, this activity needs some strategic planning, especially regarding packing! It’s not just about keeping your luggage light, but also incorporating a few unusual items you might not normally bring on your holiday.\nTo aid you in this, we’ve crafted a list of five vital river essentials to remember when preparing for your whitewater rafting expedition.\nTable of Contents\nToggle\nSwimsuit Rain Gear Wet/Body Wipes Helmets Footwear Endnote Swimsuit Spending the whole day on the river equates to being drenched all day. Therefore, opt for swimwear that provides long-lasting comfort and functionality over style. Men may consider donning board shorts and a rash guard to shield against sunburn.\nOn the other hand, women might find two-piece suits with a rash guard top and river/swim shorts more convenient, especially when nature calls in the wilderness!\nAlternatively, women can choose a one or two-piece swimsuit topped with a quick-drying polyester sun layer.\nRain Gear Being soaked is an inherent part of the thrill of white water rafting trips in Yellowstone . However, staying dry might be more appealing when you’re comfortably situated in your camp at night.\nA portable waterproof jacket can be a superb addition if sudden rain showers occur while setting up your camp in the afternoon or during dinner preparation in the evening.\nA high-quality rain jacket can function brilliantly as a splash guard when you want to remain dry while rafting.\nIt’s always wise to have this piece of equipment with you, as its necessity becomes apparent when you need it, leaving you deeply appreciative of its presence.\nWet/Body Wipes Embarking on white-water rafting trips often implies a lack of shower facilities for several days.\nWhile there may be numerous opportunities to dive into the river, cleaning up after an exhausting day before changing into your camping attire is always comforting.\nFor this purpose, wet wipes can be quite handy, assisting in removing any sunscreen or sweat residue that gathers during the day. Make sure you opt for eco-friendly, biodegradable body wipes that won’t contribute to landfill problems for years.\nUpon reaching the campsite, your guides should provide a trash can where you can conveniently responsibly discard your used wipes.\nHelmets On a commercial rafting adventure , your guide should assist you in finding a helmet that fits you properly. The helmet must be worn throughout the journey as it protects from rocks and other debris if you fall into the water.\nIt also safeguards you from inadvertent hits by another person’s paddle.\nEqually important is to consider packing a sun hat or baseball cap for before and after the river excursion. The mountain sun can be quite harsh, making it essential to shield yourself.\nThis advice is particularly pertinent if you are bald, have short hair, or have fair skin.\nFootwear Certain equipment providers may offer neoprene booties. Although neoprene can keep your feet snug, these booties are fragile and unsuitable for traversing rocky or forested terrains.\nIf you don’t possess a pair of river shoes or sandals with a secure heel strap, an old pair of tennis shoes that you’re comfortable getting wet and soiled can serve the purpose effectively.\nIf the cold concerns your feet, investing in your own neoprene socks would be the most suitable solution.\nIt’s recommended to avoid flip flops on the river as they could easily drift away if you happen to fall into the water.\nEndnote Packing adds a sense of anticipation to any journey, and we hope this guide provides assistance as you sift through the multitude of items laid out on your bed or floor.",

    "title": "Colorado approves plan to drill new oil and gas wells near Aurora Reservoir",
    "text": "Colorado regulators approved a preliminary plan to allow more than 150 new oil and gas wells east of Aurora on Wednesday, clearing a path for a project opponents fear could contaminate a local drinking water reservoir and further degrade Front Range air quality. The Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commissions voted 3 to 1 to approve the Lowry Ranch Comprehensive Area Plan, a proposal from Crestone—a subsidiary of Denver-based Civitas Resources—to develop up to 11 drilling sites spread across 32,000 acres in Arapahoe County. “Without a doubt, it’s the wrong decision for the health, safety and environment of our community,” said Marsha Goldsmith Kamin, the president of Save The Aurora Reservoir, a local advocacy group fighting the project. State regulators, however, only allowed the project to move forward if the company uses electric drilling rigs and equipment at all of its proposed drilling sites. Massive gas- and diesel-powered engines have long served as the standard power source for drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations. By requiring a shift to electricity, state regulators aim to mitigate noise and prevent new sources of smog-forming pollution along Colorado’s Front Range, which has [failed to comply](https://www.cpr.org/2024/07/01/summer-smog-air-quality-colorado-front-range/) with federal air quality standards for more than two decades. The proposed project is also a major test for Colorado’s recently revised oil and gas regulatory process. After years of fierce battles over drilling and hydraulic fracturing, [a law signed by Gov. Jared Polis](https://www.cpr.org/2019/06/11/dems-passed-a-law-to-help-counties-tighten-drilling-rules-weld-wants-to-use-it-to-make-drilling-easier/) in 2019 gave local communities greater control over new drilling and required state regulators to consider the broad public health and environmental impacts of development proposals. A first step under the overhauled system requires developers to submit comprehensive area plans—or CAPs—to state regulators. By signing off on the plan from Civitas, Colorado cleared a path for oil and gas development across the area for the next six years. The company, however, must still win approval for each drilling site from the state and Arapahoe County. Fossil fuel development could mark a new chapter for an area flanking Metro Denver’s farthest-reaching subdivisions. After serving as a military gunnery range and housing four ICBM missiles, the Colorado State Land Board bought the expanse of prairie from the federal government in the 1960s. It now borders a former landfill identified as a Superfund site and Aurora Reservoir, a popular recreation site and a major water source for the City of Aurora and its growing subdivisions. Residents are concerned fracking projects could disturb the Superfund site and contaminate the water resources. In response, Civitas has agreed not to drill any horizontal wells under the landfill site. While Kamin is glad regulators will require all-electric equipment, she said regulators haven’t adequately addressed concerns about water quality. Congressman Jason Crow, who represents Aurora, has also [asked](https://crow.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-crow-urges-epa-to-protect-coloradans-groundwater-from-potential-contamination) the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency if it's studied whether fracking could increase the risk of pollution contained at the landfill site from reaching the reservoir. “We’re not giving up. We’re going to continue to address every single one of these wells, especially the pads that are closest to the community, Kamin said. Local activists have earned support from major environmental groups. After the approval, Ben Jealous, the executive director of the Sierra Club, released a statement saying his organization was “disappointed to see Colorado regulators side with a billion-dollar company, dismissing the residents who rely on a clean, protected Aurora Reservoir.” Meanwhile, Kait Schwartz, the director of the American Petroleum Institute, said the approval shows Colorado remains “open for business” despite its recent push for tougher oil and gas regulations. “This application and decision should serve as a model for addressing future projects, and we look forward to ongoing cooperation with state agencies, stakeholders, and the public to ensure we operate responsibly and comply with our state’s increasingly ambitious standards,” Schwartz said in a statement.",

    "text": "Following a major win at the [Tamworth Quality Business Awards](https://www.northerndailyleader.com.au/story/8755438/tamworth-quality-business-awards-lia-mahony-honoured/), Camp Grounds' head camper Matthew Bettwesworth says the sky's the limit for one of the city's favourite cafes. \"I felt really stoked, to win Excellence in Small Business for the second time in a row, it feels like the work we've done together during the move to the CBD's main street has really paid off and I'm so proud of our team,\" Mr Bettesworth said. Looking ahead, the small business owner has big plans for the future. First and foremost, he wants to use Camp Grounds' success to build up Tamworth's night life. \"Our biggest focus at the moment is extending our hours. We've been putting it off for a bit to see what we can do, but what we want is to host events and training in the evenings,\" Mr Bettesworth said. These events will include art nights, music nights, book launches, coffee training sessions, and more. \"Also we'll apply for a liquor license. That won't be the backbone of what we do, but that'll be something that supports our events,\" Mr Bettesworth said. \"Part of my background is in viticulture and wine-making, so I'd like to showcase progressive, new-world Australian wines, like modern lo-fi [few to no additives] and different stuff you don't often get to see out this way.\" But the counterculture cafe isn't moving away from its core ethos of \"coffee + smiles\", meaning no extra food options outside the occasional nibbles and finger foods. \"Food has never been a focus for us. There's a lot of great food places here in town that do what they do really well. Our focus has always been coffee,\" Mr Bettesworth says. Tamworth's coffee connoisseurs will be holding their breath for the extended hours. There's no official start date since Camp Grounds' plans are still in the early stages and will need approval from Tamworth council. Mr Bettesworth says ideally he'd like to tick all his boxes by next year's country music festival, but much like a fine wine he says these things can't be rushed. The popular cafe [announced plans to move from Dowe Street in May last year](https://www.northerndailyleader.com.au/story/8198122/happy-campers-popular-local-cafes-compass-points-to-peel-street/) and opened its new location at 322 Peel Street the following November. \"One of the biggest fears we had with the larger venue was there's more dine-ins, so how were we going to get around that grab-and-go culture we created in our first four years?\" Mr Bettesworth said. The answer, he says, hinged on updating the cafe's vibe from a '60s industrial aesthetic to more of a '90s \"Australiana regional-style camping\" culture. Another challenge was fitting out the new space, which Mr Bettesworth says was done by the sweat of his own brow, completing \"about 80 per cent\" of the renovation himself. The response from customers has been positive, and the cafe is hardly ever empty. DAILY Today's top stories curated by our news team. Also includes evening update.",

    "text": "It’s been a balmy start to winter so far in the Okanagan, and last Thursday, a temperature record that’s stood for over 100 years was broken in Vernon. And the new temperature record is emblematic of the past year of weather in Vernon, as 2023 was the warmest year in the city on record. According to Environment Canada, Vernon saw a high of 6.1 degrees Celsius on Dec. 28, 2023. That broke the record that was set in 1908 for Dec. 28, when the high was recorded at 5.6 C. Vernon was one of 11 B.C. communities that set a new temperature record on Dec. 28, and the only municipality in the Okanagan, according to Environment Canada. The month of December in Vernon was the fifth warmest on record since records began in 1900. The mean temperature for Vernon in December was 0.6 C. Normally, the mean temperature is -4.4 C, according to Environment Canada meteorologist Yimei Li. And looking at the entire year, Li said Vernon had its warmest year on record in 2023. The mean temperature last year was 10 C, the warmest recorded since records began in 1902, and well above the normal mean temperature of 7.7 C. “It’s been a pretty warm and dry year … (2022) was actually pretty snowy and wet,” said Li, explaining that the year before was a La Nina year and 2023 was an El Nino year, which makes for warmer and drier conditions.

    "text": "Muslim Reservation: Political Uproar Intensifies In Uttar Pradesh Over Hindu - Muslim Politics | ABP News The atmosphere is heated again over the reservation given to Muslim castes in OBC quota. Now Yogi government has said a big thing in Uttar Pradesh. The state government will review the reservation given to Muslim castes in OBC quota. It will be investigated as to how the share in OBC reservation for Muslims has been decided. In fact, the issue of entry of Muslims in the OBC quota of reservation arose from Bengal and the politics of Uttar Pradesh started burning. In UP too, there are more than two dozen castes of Muslims who get reservation under OBC quota. There has been BJP government in Uttar Pradesh for 7 years. Now the issue has come up from Bengal, the Yogi government has also started searching the old documents. Now the leaders of Samajwadi Party and Congress are accusing this decision of fitting it into the framework of Hindu-Muslim politics.
