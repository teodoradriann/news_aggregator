    "text": "There is a section of society in India even today which believes that incidents of Grooming Jihad, communal crimes/acts of violence against Hindus, and conversion of people to Islam is a hoax and that Islamists are unnecessarily ‘targeted’ by the Hindus owing to mythical ‘majoritarianism’. However, the truth is far from it. OpIndia has several times earlier [exposed](https://www.opindia.com/2022/09/gps-marine-radio-sets-isis-videos-recovered-from-pfi-in-tamil-nadu/) the sickening mentality of the Islamists who deliberately target Hindu women in relationships and then, indulge in conversion – often violently. The Islamists believe that India is Dar-ul-Harb which must be changed to Da-ul-Islam and they see the conversion of Hindus to Islam as one of the crucial ways towards fulfilling their dreams. The Islamists are encouraged by their religious heads to trap Hindus, especially women in relationships and convert their religion to Islam. There is evidence to suggest that Islamists are also provided with financial aid to trap Hindus, especially women, and convert their religion to Islam. Notably, the state of Maharashtra has recently witnessed numerous situations in which Hindu women have been trapped by Islamists, sexually molested, tortured, and intimidated. The Islamists encourage innocent Hindu girls, including minors, to convert to Islam. OpIndia has received several reports of such instances in the state’s Ahmednagar’s [Rahuri](https://www.opindia.com/2023/08/ground-report-of-rahuri-love-jihad-case-where-hindus-allegedly-booked-in-false-case/), Pune’s [Kondhwa](https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/pune-govt-land-kondhwa-hindu-locality-playground-converted-into-muslim-qabristan/), Nashik, and Sambhaji Nagar districts. However, the majority of the instances in the past year have been reported to have occurred in Mumbai’s Mira road region. Mumbai’s Mira Road and Bhayander area which has a majority Muslim population has become a hub of ‘Grooming Jihad’ and religious conversion. The region has been in the news for all wrong reasons in the recent past for [attacks](https://www.opindia.com/2024/01/threats-vandalism-posters-of-hindu-gods-amid-chants-of-allahu-akbar-fir-in-violence-islamists-in-mira-road/) on Hindus during the Ram Mandir inauguration and deliberately creating [chaos](https://www.opindia.com/2023/06/mira-road-society-controversy-muslim-couple-files-fir-over-slaughtering-goats-in-the-society/) in the Hindu societies. Here are 16 exclusive cases of community crimes from the Mira Road-Bhayander region of Mumbai where Islamists in maximum of the cases moved to convert the Hindu victims to Islam in the past year. Case 1: 22-year-old converted, tortured by ‘husband’ Azam Khan On 16th July 2023, a 22-year-old Hindu girl filed a police complaint saying that she was brutally tortured by her ‘husband’ Amin Sheikh and mother-in-law Reshma Sheikh. The girl said that she was physically and sexually assaulted and forcefully converted to Islam after which she filed a police complaint against the duo under sections 37692)(n), 366, 323, 506, 504, and 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. As per the FIR copy obtained by OpIndia, this case seems to be a pure instance of Grooming Jihad. The victim in the year 2022 was introduced to the accused by a mutual friend named Shahbaz in a computer class. Soon the victim and the accused became good friends and in February 2022, Amin proposed to the girl. However, the girl refused to accept the proposal after which she was threatened to accept the relationship. The accused said that he would commit suicide and blame the girl for it if his proposal was not accepted. The accused then introduced the girl to his family and one day deceptively called her at his home when he was all alone. The girl was not willing to stay in the relationship however, she was threatened to cooperate. On arrival, the accused closed the doors and sexually assaulted the victim. He also shot derogatory videos of her to use them to blackmail her further. After a few days, the accused called the girl and said that he was going to Dubai. He also expressed his will to marry her. He threatened the girl saying that he had derogatory photos and videos of her and that he would viral the videos from Dubai if she refused to marry. The girl got scared but could not utter a word as she was threatened to keep her mouth shut. After a month or so, the accused came back from Dubai and asked the girl to meet. He then forced the girl to send a text message to her parents informing them that she was now married to Amin. He then sexually assaulted the victim. The next day, the accused took the girl to a Masjid and forcefully converted her religion to Islam. He also married the girl and asked her to follow the traditions of Islam hereinafter. He forced her to eat cow beef, and consume drugs while his mother, Reshma Sheikh abused and physically assaulted the girl. She also forced the girl to offer Namaz and said that soon she would be sent to Dubai. The victim then also learned that the accused was already married and had a daughter. She realized that she was being pushed into human trafficking. The accused however shifted the victim to a separate apartment and locked her from outside. As per the copy, the victim yelled for help and screamed from the windows of the building after which the neighbors called the police. The girl was safely recovered and later filed a complaint against the accused, his mother, Kazi Mufti Ismail who converted the girl to Islam, and two other associates of the primary accused who did the job of threatening the victim. She demanded strict action against the accused and his mother and said that the video of her torture had been recorded in the residential CCTV footage. She asked the Police to seize the CCTV footage and provide her justice. Father confirms the conversion of the girl to Islam, says the accused deliberately trapped the victim Team OpIndia contacted the father of the victim in this case to know the current update. The father of the girl, Kishore ji informed OpIndia that the accused had been arrested by the Police and had also been sent to Thane jail. “They were arrested after we complained. However, at present, I don’t know where they are or what they are doing. Amin had deliberately trapped my girl in a love affair, sexually assaulted her for over 1.5 years, and later promised to marry. However, he later converted her to Islam. Whatever happened was very unfortunate and now I am looking after my daughter’s overall growth,” he added while exclusively talking to OpIndia. He also stated that many girls are trapped by people like Amin and they need to be saved from this issue (what OpIndia has been terming as Grooming Jihad). “My daughter was also forced to follow Islamic traditions and was converted at Bandra court. However, now I have brought her back and no she is safely staying with us,” he said. The FIR copy of the incident has been obtained by OpIndia. Case 2: 24-year-old trapped in love affair, converted by Naseer Khan On 19th May 2023, a 24-year-old woman filed a police complaint at Kashmira Police Station revealing that she had been forcefully converted to Islam by one accused identified as Naseer Khan. The woman in the complaint said that she met the accused at her office. Soon the duo developed a friendship and later the accused proposed to the girl. He also asked her to leave the job and work for him. “He said that he would set up an office and allow me to handle all his professional affairs. He did that. Later I left my home for him and insisted he marry me. However, he said that he would not marry me unless I converted to Islam. So he converted my religion to Islam and then we got married at Bandra Court. The horror then began. He used to come home inebriated and hit me. He also used to sexually assault me. He never allowed me to talk to my family and used to check my phone,” the woman said in the complaint. She further said that she got in touch with her sister on Instagram and told her about the plight she was facing under Naseer’s dominance. The sister then informed her family who extended their support to the victim in filing a police complaint. As per the sources, the police filed a police complaint but no action in this case was taken. Case 3: A 13-year-old minor was sexually assaulted, and threatened by Munavar and Ajeem Mansoori to convert to Islam On 15th June, a woman filed a police complaint at Bhayander Police Station against two individuals identified as Munavar Mansoori and Ajeem Mansoori for threatening her 13-year-old daughter with a fake pistol and sexually assaulting her. The woman in the complaint said that the accused boys aged 20 and 19 respectively stayed in a building close to her residence and followed her daughter on her way to school or tuition. She also said that the accused persons once threatened the victim to reach the building terrace where the duo forcefully kissed her and sexually assaulted her. On June 11, the accused gifted a ring and burqa to her and proposed to marry. However, on a refusal by the girl, the accused used a fake pistol to threaten her. “Get converted to Islam otherwise I’ll kill you,” the primary accused Munavar was quoted as threatening in the FIR copy obtained by OpIndia. The girl then gathered the courage and informed about the boys to her parents who then discovered that the boys used fake pistols to torture and threaten their daughter. The mother of the victim then filed a police complaint against the accused. The complaint in the case had been filed under sections 354, 354A, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 8 and 12 of the POCSO, 2012. Parents of the victim confirm their daughter was threatened to wear a burqa Team OpIndia contacted the father of the victim who revealed that his daughter was sexually assaulted by the two accused minors. He also added that the Police had taken the required action in the case after which neither of the two dared to harass the victim. “My daughter was being harassed and being influenced by the accused towards Islam. She was also sexually abused and threatened to wear a burqa. But after we complained, the police took immediate action in the case and also punished the accused. It’s almost been a year since the incident and at present honestly, I don’t know where the accused boys are. My daughter is safe though,” he added. Case 4: 13-year-old minor brainwashed to embrace Islam by a Muslim minor A similar case was reported at Nayanagar Police Station. A 13-year-old minor Hindu girl was trapped in a love affair by an accused minor Muslim boy aged 15. He met the girl from the Mira Road region on Instagram and gained her trust. The duo soon developed a friendship and began chatting constantly over the phone. After a few days, the accused insisted the girl meet at a local garden where he forcefully kissed her and sexually assaulted her. He also used to ask the girl to send her nude photos and videos over Instagram. The accused then began to ask the girl to wear long kurtas and wear a dupatta over her head (hijab). On seeing this change, the mother of the girl discovered her ‘affair’ and read all her chats. On confronting, the girl further revealed that the accused boy also dominated her and controlled what she ate, what she posted on social media, and who she kept contact with. “The boy was trying to influence my daughter to follow his religion slowly. He was asking her to dress us like women in his house,” the mother said in the complaint. As per the FIR, once when the accused was ill, his uncle had called the girl forcing her to meet him. “He also was teaching the girl his language. He has sexually assaulted my daughter several times,” the woman said in the complaint filed under sections 354 of IPC and 8 and 12 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Notably, the mother of the girl alleged that the police in this case neglected many facts and carried out an unfair investigation. The mother in a separate complaint to the senior authorities said that the accused asked her daughter to wear a hijab and asked her to greet people by saying ‘Allah Hafiz’. “He was trying to influence my daughter to convert to Islam. However, the Nayanagar PI Gilani Sayeed refused to write this complaint down. Instead, he wrote an incomplete complaint and threatened us to sign as a complainant. The police also failed to take my statement and filed an FIR based on the incomplete statement,” the lady was quoted as saying in the letter copy that has been obtained by OpIndia. Case 5: 50-year-old Rajesh Jani converted to Islam by Mohsin In the Bhayander region of Mumbai, a 50-year-old individual named Rajesh Jani was forcefully converted to Islam by one Mohsin Soni. The complaint in this case was filed by the son of the victim on 12th June 2023 saying that the accused influenced his family also to convert to Islam and used derogatory words against Hindu Gods and Goddesses. As per the FIR copy obtained by OpIndia, the victim, Rajesh was disturbed due to some problems in his relationship with his wife. Given the situation, he had shifted his residence in the year 2022 from Vasai to Virar and had begun living alone. During this period he happened to come in contact with accused Mohsin Soni who took him to an Ijtema event organised by Muslim community people. Since then Mohsin stayed in touch with the victim. Ijtema is a show of [strength](https://www.opindia.com/2022/12/latur-maharashtra-two-days-off-schools-ijtema-tablighi-jamaat/) event for Muslims which is all about the moral reform of individuals and is often described as ‘making Muslims true Muslims’. It is termed a religious program in which several Islamic scholars are invited to offer guidance. Mohsin used to send videos of Zakir Khan to the victim and ask him to understand Islam and its traditions. He kept on influencing the victim to convert his religion to Islam. In around April 2023, the victim sifted back to his family in Vasai. The incident of his conversion came to the fore only after the victim one day failed to return home from his workplace. “My father on 27th May 2023 didn’t return home. On asking his colleague, we were informed that he had already left the workplace. After a day or so, we filed a missing report at the police station. Later on 29th May 2023 Mohsin called my mother, introduced himself as my father’s friend, and said that the duo was together at his (Mohisn’s) place in Mumbra. He said that the duo got acquainted at the Ijtema event that happened last year. He also informed my mother that my father had embraced Islam and we need not worry about him,” the boy mentioned in the complaint. The family of the victim began worrying more for the victim. Later on 2nd June, Mohsin again called the family and asked them also to convert their religion to Islam. He used derogatory words for Hindu Gods and Goddesses and threatened the family. “Mohsin said that the only way to reach heaven was to embrace Islam. He forced us all to convert to Islam. He said that Hindus worshipping Lord Rama an Lord Krishna are surviving in darkness. Nobody is ready to come out of the darkness. He said that he had brought my father out of the darkness and that now he could reach heaven. He also made us believe that he had some power in him with which he could solve several problems of people. He also mentioned that before this he had converted around 400 persons and that now it was our time,” the boy mentioned in the FIR. The FIR in the case was filed under section 295A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and section 3 of the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice, other Inhuman, Evil, and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013. As per the sources, the accused was arrested by the Police and was sent to Surat after being released on bail while in judicial custody. Case 6: 17-year-old assaulted, and converted to Islam by Shahin, Abueid, Nuzhat, and Nikhat Khan In a dreadful case reported from the Mira road region of Mumbai, a 17-year-old Hindu girl, her brother, and a cousin were converted to Islam by the accused identified as Shahin Khan, Abueid Khan, Nuzhat Khand, and Nikhat Khan. The 17-year-old girl was also sexually assaulted by Abueid Khan several times after which the victim on 10th August filed a police complaint at the Mira Road Police station. As per the FIR copy obtained by OpIndia, the three victims were being tortured by the accused persons after they lost their parents in the year 2022. The father of the victim died of a heart attack while the mother of the victim committed suicide in January 2023. After the death of the parents, the relatives of the victims took them home for some days but later lodged them in an orphanage in Andheri. However, the 17-year-old was not satisfied at the orphanage and wanted to continue her education with her brother and cousin. She informed the orphanage authorities about ‘grandma’ Shahin Khan and her family who she said stayed in the neighborhood when her parents were alive. Shahin Khan’s family proved to the orphanage that they were financially capable of taking care of the children. The children were then adopted by the Khans and soon the horror began. Shahin Khan, a few days after the arrival of the children, made them believe that Islam was the only religion to be followed. She told the victim that she along with her brother and her cousin needed to be converted to Islam. “Hindus staying in the house of Muslims is a sin. The presence of Hindus in a Muslim house creates problems. So you all need to convert to Islam,” Shahin was quoted as saying in the FIR. She also said that the brother of the victim was required to get the circumcision done following which he would be converted to Islam. Notably, the family first converted the boy to Islam and named him Altaaf Sheikh. Later the cousin of the victim was also converted. The victim was then made to believe that her brother and her cousin had consumed beef and that now he was a true Muslim. The family of Shahin Khan tortured the victim and her siblings and restricted them from taking further education. They were also forced to do the house chores and threatened to be sent to an orphanage for not following the orders. The family instead took the Hindu children to various Masjids and forced them to follow the traditions of Islam. They also stopped supporting them financially. This all happened in the course of 7-8 months from January 2023 to August 2023. On 8th August 2023, one of the accused Abueid Khan sexually assaulted the girl when she was fast asleep at night. He pulled her pants and invaded her private parts. He continued to assault her also on 9th August after which the victim escaped from the home and reached Mira Road Police station for justice. The complaint in this case has been filed under sections 376(2)(n), 376, 298, 354, 506, and 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The accused persons have also been booked under sections 8 and 4 of the POCSO, 2012. Apart from these dreadful incidents of Grooming Jihad or conversion to Islam here are further cases of community crimes in which Islamists harassed the Hindu victims, attacked them deliberately, and sexually assaulted them in most of the cases.

The duo also abused the Hindu faith and abused Lord Ram,” the Hindu complainant said. The complainant then is said to have informed the local police who were deployed on the spot to avoid any untoward incident from happening. But the accused persons had fled from the spot by then.

He meanwhile threatened the woman saying that they had already kidnapped her daughter and asked her to cooperate if she wanted to save her daughter. The woman on reaching the accused’s home discovered that the duo had fooled her saying that they had kidnapped her daughter. Later, the primary accused person identified as Danish, forced himself upon her. Also, the mother of the accused, Afsana forced the woman to marry Danish. As per the complaint, the accused also took the victim to a nearby Masjid where he asked the Maulvi to get them married. “The Maulvi asked us to get some documents and said that the marriage would be possible only after the documents were presented. Later Danish kept me dragging from Bandra to Bhaykhala in Mumbai. At Bandra Karter, the police stopped us and on enquiring they discovered that Danish was wanted in a case filed at Bhayander Police Station on 1st April. The Police then detained Danish,” the girl said. However, the woman later in a letter to the Additional Commissioner of Police, stated that she was dissatisfied by the Police investigation. She said that the accused was let go free given his family’s influence. “The accused and his associates are habitual offenders. They have multiple criminal antecedents to their name. They are known for actively supplying drugs and illegal arms and are also part of human trafficking networks with underworld connections,” she said in the letter, a copy of which has been obtained by OpIndia. She also mentioned saying she was threatened by the accused that her 5-year-old daughter would be kidnapped and installed in their human trafficking network. She further highlighted Police lethargy and said that she was scared of the accused and his activities and needed immediate action against him. “I get panic attacks and I am often pushed into suicidal thoughts. I am constantly horrified by the unfortunate incidents that happened to me. If anything happens again the Police will solely be responsible,” the letter added. Earlier Mira Road controversies and acts of violence reported by OpIndia: Mira Road and the Bhayander area in Maharashtra’s Mumbai district have been in the news for all the wrong reasons in the recent past. In June 2023, massive controversy erupted in the capital city of Maharashtra after one of the Muslim families living in a society on Mira Road, Mumbai brought two goats a day ahead of Bakrid (Bakra-eid, Eid-Ul-Adha). The society members happened to refuse the Muslim family to get the goats inside the society premises for slaughter and said that they wouldn’t allow any kind of slaughtering activity within the society premises. The residents of the society on Mira Road protested and opposed the slaughtering of the goats within the society premises on Bakrid and also chanted Hanuman Chalisa. Some of the people also raised the slogans of ‘Jai Shree Ram’, the videos of which had gone viral in the media. Ruckus in— Sonu Kanojia (@NNsonukanojia) [#MiraRoad]high rise society ( Close to Mumbai) over [#BakriEid] [pic.twitter.com/96ZjiCJQgA] [June 28, 2023] But the couple took the lambs to the apartment after which the police were informed. The police who reached the spot immediately tried to maintain peace and communal harmony and assured the other residents in the society that no slaughtering would take place within the society premises. The Police also allowed the goats saying that there was no such rule or law against a man getting goats or animals into his house. However, the authorities said that Mohsin would get arrested if he slaughtered animals in his apartment or within the society premises. After the incident, the residents of the society talked to OpIndia and confirmed that Mohsin had been problematic to the society and that he had broken several regulations of the premises. He abused the society’s women after the latter demanded the removal of lambs from the society premises. Also, his wife had filed a fake complaint against the society members saying that she was molested by the society members. However, nothing like this had happened. The detailed report on this case can be read [ here](https://www.opindia.com/2023/06/mira-road-society-controversy-muslim-couple-files-fir-over-slaughtering-goats-in-the-society/) and [ here.](https://www.opindia.com/2023/06/mira-road-bakrid-case-mohsin-khan-goats-apartment-resigns-shiv-sena-fir-booked-molesting-woman-resident/) In the second crucial incident that was reported recently in January 2024, the Islamists attacked Hindus with stones, iron rods, sticks, and bamboo, leaving over a dozen people who participated in rallies to commemorate the return of Lord Ram in Ayodhya injured. In the incident [reported](https://www.opindia.com/2024/01/threats-vandalism-posters-of-hindu-gods-amid-chants-of-allahu-akbar-fir-in-violence-islamists-in-mira-road/) from Mira Road, Mumbai, Islamists also disrespected the Hindu religion and hurt the Hindu religious sentiments by tearing flags bearing images of Lord Hanuman. Islamists are also said to have vomited over the flags causing disrespect to the Hindu faith. OpIndia contacted the Police to know the details of the incident. The police confirmed that around 13 persons had been arrested in the case, however, IO Dilip Rakh revealed no information about the accused persons given the sensitivity of the case. The videos of the incident had gone viral over the internet in which the Islamists could be heard raising the slogans of ‘Allah-hu-Akhbar’ while attacking the cars. They could be seen using iron rods and sticks to attack the Hindus. Even the videos of women being attacked made rounds on social media. Islamists raised slogans of 'Allah-hu-Akhbar' after cars on— Siddhi Somani (@sidis28) [#miraroad]attacked. They puked on Hindu flags.

[pic.twitter.com/am8vmVkksl] [January 23, 2024] Later the Police and the local administration happened to take cognizance of the event and [bulldozed](https://www.opindia.com/2024/01/mumbai-administration-mira-road-violence-case-bulldozer-action/) the illegal properties of the Islamists staying on the Mira road who were involved in the stone pelting. As per reports, the illegal construction of the accused persons [involved ](https://www.deccanherald.com/india/maharashtra/mira-road-clashes-bulldozer-action-initiated-following-violence-over-ram-mandir-rally-in-mumbai-2860899)in the Mira Road clash was razed to the ground in the presence of Maharashtra Security Force and Mumbai Police. Recent demography changes in Nayanagar area and Mira road The Sakal Hindu Samaj members in an exclusive conversation, informed OpIndia that the Mira Road region in Mumbai is dominated by the Muslim majority population and that the community which claims to be a minority and oppressed is moving to become a problem for the other community residents. Explaining the changing demography of the region, Kishor Sant (name changed for security reasons) of the Sakal Hindu Samaj said, “Earlier this Mira Bhayander region, Nayanagar area was dominated by the Hindu population. In the past few years, several Muslims from the Mumbra region or even from different cities migrated to this area claiming their dominance. Later in the Nayanagar and Mira road region these people began deliberately harassing Hindus. They began harassing their daughters, disturbing them in their businesses and even there are many cases where these people have demanded ransom money from Hindus. As a result of this, several Hindus began migrating to other regions of Mumbai and Thane.” “At present, in the Nayanagar area, no Hindus are allowed. It has now become a Muslim locality. Recently, Hindu devotees were badly assaulted during the Ram Mandir inauguration ceremony that happened in Ayodhya. The Hindus in the Nayanagar area were abused, also derogatory comments were made against Lord Rama. The videos of the incident had gone viral over the internet. This is a growing problem,” he added. As per Pratap Deokate (name changed for security reasons), another Hindu activist, the Muslims deliberately harass the Hindu businessmen in the Bhayander area which still is a Hindu-dominated locality. “They install hawkers in the areas which are literally ‘no-hawkers’ zones and indirectly block the customers from reaching into the Hindu shops. Then they slowly start trapping the daughters of the Hindu shopkeepers leading to the incidents of Love Jihad,” he said. Further, while pressing for a stringent law against the Love Jihad, Deokate also opined that the police need to look into these cases seriously. “When a Hindu girl is harassed, sexually assaulted or murmured, these people in the administration don’t look at it from the perspective of Love Jihad. They don’t doubt the intentions of the Islamists accused. They just treat these cases like other normal criminal cases and that’s why these Islamists most of the time get a free pass. The police and the local administration should understand the intention of the accused Islamists behind targeting the Hindu girls. Only then they will be able to provide justice to the victims in such cases,” he said.",

    "text": "La selección femenina, ganadora de la Liga de Naciones seis meses después de conseguir vencer en la Copa del Mundo, se dio un baño de masas al ser recibida por miles de aficionados a grito de 'campeonas', este jueves en el Palacio de Vistalegre en Madrid con la mirada puesta en los Juegos Olímpicos de París, siguiente objetivo del combinado español. \"Es un placer estar aquí con todos vosotros con este título que han conseguido estas grandísimas jugadoras. Hoy es un día para sentirnos felices y agradecidas. Ahora a disfrutarlo y vamos a por los Juegos Olímpicos\", declaró la seleccionadora Montse Tomé que quiso agradecer el gran papel que desempeña su cuerpo técnico y el 'staff', y sobre todo, a las jugadoras. \"Agradecer personalmente a mi cuerpo técnico porque estoy rodada de ocho personas que sin ellos no sería posible todo el trabajo para conseguir que las futbolistas saquen su máximo rendimiento. También, a todo el staff que trabajan con cariño, profesionalidad y detalle para que todo tenga el orden ideal y a todas estas futbolistas porque ellas son las verdaderas protagonistas de este juego\", afirmó Tomé ante una grada entregada con banderas y camisetas de la selección, que escuchó como Irene Paredes les animaba a seguir apoyando al equipo. \"Es importante sentir vuestro apoyo y por nuestra parte decir que vamos a por más a si que os necesitamos para eso también\", comentó la jugadora del Barcelona . La selección se proclamó campeona de la primera edición de la Liga de las Naciones tras vencer por 2-0 a Francia, en la Cartuja ante 32.6576 espectadores, gracias a los goles de Aitana Bonmatí en la primera parte y de Mariona Caldentey en el minuto 53 que permitió al combinado nacional alzarse con el trofeo. Previamente, tras ganar en semifinales a Países Bajos por 3-0, ya habían logrado certificar el objetivo de la clasificación a los Juegos Olímpicos. Como homenaje a las madres, cada jugadora fue nombrada por su nombre y sus dos apellidos mientras la afición vitoreaba a cada una de ellas llegando al punto álgido cuando Jennifer Hermoso, con el trofeo en mano, entro al escenario con los aplausos y ánimos de la grada que se cayó a bajo a grito de 'Jenni, Jenni'. Otra de las más aclamadas fue Aitana Bonmatí, MVP de la Final a Cuatro. La fiesta, que comenzó a las 17.00 horas con entrada libre hasta que se completó el aforo y contó con música en directo de grandes artistas invitados como Marlena, en dos ocasiones, Michenlo, Delaporte y Elena Farga, tuvo su punto álgido cuando entraron las jugadoras y el cuerpo técnico alrededor de las 19.00 horas y se cerró con el 'We are the Champions' como es habitual en este tipo de acontecimientos. En la mañana de este jueves, la selección fue recibida por la presidenta del Congreso, junto a los portavoces de los grupos, en el Salón de los Pasos Perdidos, desde el que se trasladaron al hemiciclo, donde ocuparon los escaños y se fotografiaron con los diputados presentes. Posteriormente, el combinado nacional tuvo el reconocimiento en el Palacio de la Moncloa del presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, que recibió una camiseta con los nombres de todas las protagonistas del duelo contra Francia y las ánimo a conseguir una medalla en los Juegos Olímpicos de París que se celebran en los meses de julio y agosto y serán los primeros juegos de su historia.

A manifestação aconteceu no Parque da Jaqueira, na manhã da última quarta (27).\nAlém do ato no Recife, também nesta quarta, outra movimentação foi realizada na cidade de Goiana, na Zona da Mata Norte de Pernambuco.\nO Diario entrou em contato com Mauro Fernandes, ex-funcionário do Grupo João Santos que atuou por 44 anos na corporação. Ele foi desligado da empresa há quase dois anos e explicou como foi a situação.\n“Chegaram os representantes da nova gestão. Uma pessoa que eu nunca vi me comunicou meu desligamento. Recebi do RH os cálculos da minha rescisão e nem um real na conta”, desabafou.\nMauro relatou que depois da demissão, não houve mais nenhuma procura por parte da instituição. “Nenhum contato. É uma ingratidão. Uma vida dedicada a essas empresas”, compartilhou.\nMauro e cerca de 10 mil ex-funcionários estão reivindicando rescisões de contrato em função de demissões. Alguns aguardam o recebimento desse valor há sete anos.\nO grupo se uniu e segundo apurado pela reportagem do Diario, organiza outros atos. Em postagem nas redes sociais, a associação de trabalhadores que prestavam serviços ao Grupo João Santos se manifesta com frequência.\nEm uma das postagens, uma ex-funcionária do Grupo Industrial João Santos durante 45 anos, Dona Marluce Cintra faz um desabafo em carta enviada à Ana Clara Pereira dos Santos de Albuquerque Ramalho Monteiro, filha de Dona Rosália Pereira dos Santos. Marluce Cintra relata o tratamento dado aos ex-funcionários que dedicaram grande parte de suas vidas ao trabalho na Nassau.\nConfira alguns trechos:\n\"Dra. Ana Clara, a senhora que tanto conheceu os funcionários do grupo, principalmente as secretárias de Dr. Fernando, que trabalhávamos como escravas, em qualquer horário e demos o sangue por aquele grupo, assim como eu; que passamos mais de 5 anos sem recebermos um tostão de salário mensal e continuamos dando o nosso sangue às empresas do grupo, que perdemos tudo que havíamos conseguido; que vestíamos a \"camisa\" do grupo e que acabamos com o nosso psicológico emocional diante de tanto estresse sem entrarmos em outros detalhes; a senhora acha MESMO, JUSTO o que foi aprovado nesta assembleia da Recuperação Judicial? A senhora acha justo o empregado depois de ter dado a vida pelo grupo, que trabalhou 57 anos, 44 anos, 45 anos (meu caso), sair e ser demitido sem receber seus direitos para tentar ter uma velhice digna?\n[...]\nIsto é um massacre para todos os ex-funcionários que trabalharam mais de 20 anos para o grupo. Isto é roubo. É absurdo. É INJUSTO. Todos sabemos que o grupo tem ativo para pagar as verbas rescisórias e trabalhistas dos empregados”.\nO Diario tentou entrar em contato com o Grupo João Santos, e aguarda retorno.\nPlano de recuperação\nOs credores do Grupo João Santos (GJS) aprovaram, no último dia 5 de novembro, o plano de Recuperação Judicial da empresa em assembleia geral realizada.\nA nova proposta apresentada pela companhia indica o dobro do valor a ser pago aos credores trabalhistas. O plano foi aprovado por 58,86% dos presentes.\nDe acordo com o economista responsável pela estruturação econômico-financeira do plano apresentado, João Rogério Filho, da PPK Consultoria, mais de 25 mil credores trabalhistas serão contemplados no primeiro momento.\n“Mais de R$ 475 milhões serão pagos inicialmente aos credores trabalhistas, considerando-se os 22 mil credores do FGTS e os 6.700 credores de outras verbas trabalhistas. Isso faz com que, no momento zero, possamos afirmar que mais de 25 mil credores serão contemplados”, disse o economista.\nMais notícias\nMais lidas\nÚLTIMAS",

    "title": "Anderson County's Storywalk: A Trail of Tales Connecting Literacy and Nature",
    "text": "In the heart of Anderson County, South Carolina, a novel idea has taken root along the serene paths of Mineral Spring Park. A collaborative venture, titled the 'Storywalk,' has emerged as a beacon of innovation, blending the joy of reading with the beauty of the outdoors. Spearheaded by a coalition of literary organizations including the Anderson County Library, Clemson SNAP-Ed, the Town of Williamston, DocLink, and Friends of the Anderson County Library, this initiative aims to foster a love for literacy amidst nature's backdrop. Introduced to the community on a crisp, sunlit morning, the Storywalk invites visitors of all ages to embark on a mile-long journey through narrative and nature.\nA Trail of Tales\nWinding along the gentle curves of Mineral Spring Park, the Storywalk is more than just a walk in the park. It is an immersive educational experience, where each step unveils a new page. Display cases, strategically placed along the trail, house parts of a picture book, allowing readers to literally walk through a story. The content, carefully curated to captivate a broad audience, ranges from whimsical tales for children to intriguing narratives for adults. With each display offering not only text but also interactive activities, the Storywalk is designed to engage minds and bodies in equal measure.\nEngaging the Community in Literacy\nAt its core, the Storywalk project is a community endeavor aimed at breaking the conventional confines of literacy. By taking the reading experience outdoors, the initiative seeks to attract those who might not frequent libraries or bookstores. The collaborative effort of local organizations underscores a shared commitment to literacy and public well-being. Through this innovative approach, the Storywalk bridges the gap between education and recreation, encouraging families to explore the joys of reading together in the great outdoors. The feedback from visitors, brimming with enthusiasm and curiosity, reflects the project's success in creating a vibrant, literate community.\nA Model for Future Endeavors\nThe Storywalk in Anderson County is not just a local novelty; it stands as a model of creative community engagement that could inspire similar projects far and wide. Its inception and execution demonstrate what can be achieved when organizations with diverse focuses unite for a common cause. Beyond promoting literacy, the Storywalk nurtures a connection with nature, supports physical activity, and offers a platform for family bonding. As this trail of tales continues to weave its magic, it paves the way for future endeavors that blend education, health, and community development in innovative, accessible ways.\nIn summary, the Storywalk at Mineral Spring Park represents a pioneering movement towards integrating literacy with outdoor activity. Initiated by a coalition of literacy organizations in Anderson County, South Carolina, this project transforms a simple walk in the park into an engaging literary adventure. With its interactive displays and inclusive content, the Storywalk not only promotes literacy among community members of all ages but also sets a precedent for similar initiatives worldwide. As visitors wander along this mile-long trail, they are not just reading a book; they are stepping into a story that connects them with their community and the natural world.",

    "text": "THIS PAGE WILL BE UPDATED WITH THE LATEST NEWS UPDATE: 8:30 AM PMOI Resistance Units Show Support for Maryam Rajavi’s 10-Point Plan for Iran While Iran’s regime has been on an expansive campaign to discredit and disparage the Iranian Resistance and the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK), [Resistance Units](https://english.mojahedin.org/article/pmoi-resistance-units-the-vanguards-of-freedom-in-iran/) across Iran have been countering the regime’s efforts by showing their full support for the [10-point plan](https://www.maryam-rajavi.com/en/viewpoints/plan-for-future-of-iran/) of Maryam Rajavi, the president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). The 10-point plan is the platform of the Iranian Resistance for the establishment of a democratic republic of Iran that rejects both the religious dictatorship of the mullahs and the tyrannical monarchy of the shah. It represents the desires of the Iranian people, who have been chanting, “Death to the oppressor, be it the shah or the mullahs!” across Iran. Political Prisoners Challenge Judge’s Visit at Evin Prison Political prisoners held in the women’s ward of [Evin Prison](https://women.ncr-iran.org/2021/12/09/the-conditions-of-women-iran-prisons/) expressed anger during the visit of [Judge Iman Afshari](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86_%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C) on December 27, 2023. Many of these detainees had been sentenced by Judge Afshari, leading to heightened tensions during his presence. The authorities at Evin Prison responded to the protests by punishing the demonstrators. Those who raised their voices against Judge Afshari were either restricted from making phone calls or faced threats of isolation as a repercussion for their protest. The women who protested Afshari’s visit voiced their frustration over their indefinite imprisonment without a clear resolution to their cases. Notable among the dissenters were [Forough Taghipour](https://women.ncr-iran.org/2023/12/12/three-female-political-prisoners/), [Arghavan Fallahi](https://women.ncr-iran.org/2023/05/31/arghavan-fallahi/), and Shiva Esmaili. Who Was Razi Mousavi, the IRGC Commander Killed in Syria On December 26, 2023, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) of the Iranian regime announced the death of Razi Mousavi, a prominent figure known as “Seyed Razi” and recognized as the head of the so-called “Resistance Front” in Syria. The news of his demise sparked a flurry of reports, accompanied by photographs that shed light on this previously unknown commander of the IRGC. The IRGC’s announcement regarding Mousavi’s death was brief and lacking in specific details regarding the time and circumstances surrounding the demise of this senior IRGC commander. However, Hossein Akbari, the regime’s ambassador in Syria, disclosed to Iranian state TV that Mousavi had been present at the regime’s embassy in Damascus until 2:00 p.m. on Monday. After completing his duties, he departed for his residence and was struck by three Israeli rockets at 4:10 p.m. on the same day in the Zainabiya region, located in the suburbs of Damascus. Why Is Khamenei So Keen on Increasing Iran’s Population in 2024? The Resurgence of Pro-Forced Childbearing Discourse The recent reemergence of the promotion of forced childbearing in Iran’s media and its implications. The discourse around forced childbearing in Iran has resurfaced, drawing attention to the persistent struggles of its citizens against government-mandated population policies. Recently, the media spotlighted this issue, highlighting concerns about declining marriages and births, attributing them not just to lifestyle changes but also to poverty and deeper economic roots. Citizens’ Discontent and Resistance Insights into the disillusionment and discontent among Iranians regarding the government’s population policies and their resistance against them. An ordinary citizen’s perspective sheds light on the underlying issues. Disheartened by the Iranian government’s policies, he reflects on the broader disillusionment, citing concerns about the future of his child in a country marred by economic challenges, perilous conditions, and limited prospects. It’s a sentiment shared by many, indicating a profound discontent among the populace. IRGC Commander Walks Back Comments Claiming Oct 7 Attacks Were Retaliation to Killing of Qassem Soleimani In a statement released on its Telegram channels, Hamas denied the remarks of Ramazan Sharif, the spokesperson for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( [IRGC](https://iranfocus.com/terrorism/49443-new-us-sanctions-target-irans-irgc-intelligence-organization-for-hostage-taking/)), regarding the “Al-Aqsa Storm,” the name Hamas uses to refer to the October 7 attack on southern Israel. Ramazan Sharif, the spokesperson for the IRGC, stated in a press conference in Tehran on December 27 that the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 was “one of the retaliations of the resistance axis for the killing of Qasem Soleimani,” in which Israeli forces “lost over 200 commanders and suffered more than 1,500 casualties.” Qassem Soleiman was the notorious commander of the IRGC Quds Force, who was killed in a US drone strike near Baghdad, Iraq, in September 2020. Soleimani was killed along with Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the commander of the Iran-backed Hashd al-Shabi terrorist militia group in Iraq. Iran’s Gold Traders Continue Strike for 6th Day Reports from various markets in different cities of Iran indicate that the gold traders’ strike continued for the sixth consecutive day on Thursday, December 28. [Gold traders](https://iranfocus.com/economy/49363-the-rial-continues-to-sink-hits-record-5 -marks-against-the-dollar/) in Tehran, Isfahan, Hamadan, Mashhad, Qom, Yazd, Arak, Tabriz, and several other cities went on strike on Thursday, similar to the previous days. The strike in this sector began when gold traders were required to register their information and gold inventory on the National Trade Website (NTSW). Alongside this obligation, the registration of buyers’ information in government online systems has also become mandatory. These measures collectively led to the discussion of imposing a 25% capital gains tax, eventually resulting in the strike. MEK Supporters Organize Exhibition in Paris to Express Solidarity With the Iran Revolution, December 26-27, 2023 In Paris, France, on December 26-27, 2023, freedom-loving Iranians and supporters of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran ( [PMOI/MEK](https://english.mojahedin.org/about-iranian-opposition-pmoi-mek)) have diligently arranged an exhibition over the course of several consecutive days.

    "text": "Several places of Christian worship have been turned into other purposes due to the declining number of people attending Christian services in Europe. They were converted into establishments such as hotels, cafes, and discotheques. Christianity in Europe Throughout the 20th century, Europe's religious makeup grew markedly more diversified than before. Christianity was practiced by approximately 95% of Europe's population in 1900; however, by 2020, that number had dropped to about 76%. Based on an article from [Gordon Conwell](https://www.gordonconwell.edu/blog/christianity-in-europe/), the arrival of asylum seekers, refugees, and different types of migrants from the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia, Africa, and other places has caused a change in the religious composition of Europe. This change has resulted in a rise in the percentage of Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. The preeminence of a White (Christian) ethnicity has been publicly called into question, putting Europe's progressive principles to the test. At the beginning of the refugee crisis in 2015, several nations witnessed an increase in prejudice, which has enormously affected Muslims in those nations. Additionally, the proportion of Christians' total population has been continuously falling, resulting in a shift in the demographic composition of Europe. As per [the Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2018/05/29/being-christian-in-western-europe/#:~:text=Some%20say%20they%20gradually%20drifted,and%20practices%20in%20Western%20Europe.) survey, even though a proportion of people claim to have been baptized at some point in their lives, many individuals in today's society do not consider themselves Christians. As mentioned, on religious views and practices in Western Europe, some respondents have claimed that they slowly moved away from spirituality, ceased believing in spiritual teachings, or felt excluded by controversies or church views on social problems. Despite this, the vast majority of persons polled continue to identify themselves as Christians, even while they attend religious services only sometimes. According to the survey findings, the most significant proportion of persons in the region self-identified as Christians but only went to church a few times a year or less. Also Read: [Ontario Church Sold for $300,000 Turns Into A Family Home](/news/ontario-church-sold-for-3 -turns-into-a-family-home.html) Repurposed Churches The steady fall in the number of Christians in Europe has led to the repurposing of various churches. [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/world/churches-across-europe-repurposed-for-nightclubs-and-hotels-as-attendance-shrinks-to-stunning-lows) reported that the trend could be seen to its fullest extent in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking northern area of Belgium, where towns historically had an average of six churches. According to local politicians, there is a drive to turn some of the buildings into new companies because some structures have become eyesores and a financial burden on the municipality. A symbol of the loss of Christianity on the continent, which once contributed to introducing the religion to all parts of the world, is reportedly the increasing number of abandoned chapels across Belgium and Europe. Some chapels have been repurposed as other establishments, such as hotels, nightclubs, and clothes stores. The Sacred Center Church in Mechelen, Belgium, has been closed for the next two years to transform the building into a cafe and concert venue. Investors anticipate that this transformation will transform the church into a new cultural hot spot in the center of Mechelen. One of these kinds of projects was the Martin's Patershof hotel, which was created by emptying the interior of a cathedral to make room for beds with headboards resembling organ pipes and a breakfast area adjacent to where the altar had been. Moreover, the building formerly housed the St. Anthony of Padua church in Brussels is now home to the Maniak Padoue climbing club. Many of the church's historical artifacts can be seen on display there. In addition, a former Anglican church in Brussels has been transformed into a nightclub called Spirito. Its emblem depicts a priest passionately kissing a nun and is located on the building's exterior. However, some people are unhappy with how historic churches are being maintained.

    "text": "Turkey's media watchdog RTÜK dishes out penalties to popular TV show, opposition programs Turkey’s media watchdog RTÜK on Dec. 28 fined the popular TV series about religious cults “Kızıl Goncalar” (Crimson Buds) and various opposition channels for violating “national and spiritual values” and “broadcasting principles.” Duvar English Turkish government’s media watchdog Radio and Television High Council (RTÜK) on Dec. 28 penalized ten networks for 16 counts of violations during its last weekly meeting of the year. On the Council’s agenda was the popular TV series “Kızıl Goncalar” (Red Buds), which received a two-episode ban and a fine. Opposition channels such as Fox TV, Halk TV, SZC, Tele 1, and KRT also incurred penalties for statements violating “Turkish values” and “broadcasting principles” during live programming. The “Kızıl Goncalar” series features a mother and daughter trying to flee a fictional religious cult. The show has garnered popularity since its recent premiere and received backlash for misrepresenting religious organizations. RTÜK investigated the series during its weekly meeting upon receiving over 31,000 complaints. The Council found that the show violated “broadcasting principles” for airing certain dialogues that used adjectives for pious characters unbecoming of Islam and Muslims, and some scenes insulting to segments of society with religious sensitivities. The Council ruled that the broadcaster Fox TV violated Article 8 of the Law on Radio and Television Establishments which states, “Broadcast services,... cannot violate the society’s national and spiritual values, general morality, or the protection of family principle.” The show faced other obstacles in production upon criticism from religious organizations. On Dec. 25, journalist [Birsen Altuntaş reported](https://www.birsenaltuntas.com/dizi/kizil-goncalar-dizisine-bir-engel-de-aile-bakanligindan-geldi-cekim-izni-iptal-edildi-set-durdu/37066/) that Turkey’s Family and Social Services and Culture Ministries revoked filming permits for several of the historical locations of the series, forcing the production team to relocate. Oppositional channel Tele 1 was among the penalized networks for three of its programs. The Council fined the channel for remarks during the live discussion program “Forum Weekend” that described conservatives as “hypocrites.” Another Tele 1 show “Docket Special” was penalized for columnist Nedim Şener’s remarks describing Turkey as an “epicenter of the drug trade” and “dirty money hub” while discussing the social media influencers’ money laundering scandal. The “Public Arena” program on the oppositional Halk TV was penalized as the Council found host İrfan Değirmenci’s remarks “I am sure the Gen-Z LGBT+ watching me are very happy now, and not feeling alone” to violate national and spiritual values. “Money Politics” on SZC was penalized for host Ebru Baki’s criticism of Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) employees. The KRT Network incurred fines for criticizing Health and Social Security Ministers in the “Mediatherapy with Zafer Arapkirli” program. RTÜK also fined online streaming platform Netflix for the brothel scenes in the Spanish show “Pieles,” and removed the show from the Turkish catalog. The penalties came in addition to the 570 fines RTÜK issued on several broadcasters in 2023 as stated by Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy.",
