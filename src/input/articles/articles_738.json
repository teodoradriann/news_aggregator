    "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved tislelizumab-jsgr (Tevimbra, BeiGene, Ltd.) as second-line monotherapy for certain adult patients with unresectable or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Specifically, the novel checkpoint inhibitor is approved for patients with ESCC after prior systemic chemotherapy that did not include a programmed death–ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor. Approval was based on findings from the open-label, phase 3 [RATIONALE 302 trial](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03430843) showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival benefit with tislelizumab vs investigator's choice of chemotherapy. Study participants included 512 adults enrolled at 123 research sites in 11 countries in Europe, Asia, and North America. Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous tislelizumab, a humanized immunoglobulin G4 anti-programmed cell death protein 1 monoclonal antibody, at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of standard chemotherapy with paclitaxel, [docetaxel](https://reference.medscape.com/drug/taxotere-docetaxel-342192), or irinotecan until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study withdrawal. Median overall survival in the intention-to-treat population, the primary study endpoint, was 8.6 months vs 6.3 months in the chemotherapy arms (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70). The survival benefit was observed across predefined subgroups, including baseline PD-L1 status and region. The new agent was also associated with improved overall response rate (20.4% vs 9.8%) and more durable response (median duration of response of 7.1 vs 4.0 months; HR, 0.42) compared with chemotherapy. The most common adverse reactions for tislelizumab, each occurring in at least 20% of treated patients, included increased glucose and [decreased hemoglobin](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/198475-overview), lymphocytes, sodium, and [albumin](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2054430-overview) as well as increased alkaline phosphatase, [anemia](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/198475-overview), fatigue, increased aspartate aminotransferase, musculoskeletal pain, decreased weight, increased alanine aminotransferase, and cough. Fewer patients in the tislelizumab arm experienced grade 3 or greater treatment-emergent adverse events compared with the chemotherapy arm (46% vs 68%, respectively), and fewer patients discontinued tislelizumab vs chemotherapy due to such an event (7% vs 14%). \"Patients diagnosed with advanced or metastasized ESCC, the most common histologic subtype of [esophageal cancer](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/277930-overview), often progress following initial therapy and are in need of new options,\" Syma Iqbal, MD, of the Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, stated in the BeiGene release. \"The RATIONALE 302 trial showed that patients with previously treated ESCC who received Tevimbra saw a clinically meaningful survival benefit, highlighting its potential as an important treatment option for these patients.\" The approval, which was deferred in 2022 due to COVID-19-related restrictions, marks the first for the agent in the United States. Tislelizumab should be available in the United States in the second half of 2024, BeiGene noted. The FDA is also reviewing a Biologics License Application for the agent as a first-line treatment for patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic ESCC and for those with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, BeiGene announced in a [press release](https://ir.beigene.com/news/beigene-receives-fda-approval-for-tevimbra-for-the-treatment-of-advanced-or-metastatic-esophageal-squamous/20eb032c-15ce-456a-a852-39c88a28d811/).

    "text": "A plataforma que reúne cinco sindicatos de enfermeiros recusou a contraposta de valorização salarial apresentada esta quinta-feira pelo Governo, mantendo a reivindicação de aumento de duas posições remuneratórias para todos os profissionais de enfermagem.\n“Nenhuma das cinco estruturas que estão aqui representadas sente-se completamente satisfeita com aquilo que foi apresentado” na reunião negocial que decorreu esta quinta-feira com o Ministério da Saúde, adiantou à Lusa o presidente do Sindicato dos Enfermeiros (SE).\nSegundo Pedro Costa, perante a recusa da contraposta apresentada nas negociações desta quinta-feira, a plataforma sindical — que junta o SE, o Sindicato Independente de Todos os Enfermeiros Unidos (SITEU), o Sindicato Nacional dos Enfermeiros (SNE), o Sindicato Independente Profissionais Enfermagem (SIPENF) e o Sindicato Democrático dos Enfermeiros de Portugal (SINDEPOR) — pretende agendar uma nova reunião já para a próxima semana.\n“O que nós propusemos era duas posições remuneratórias da tabela da carreira de enfermagem divididas em três anos. O que nos está a ser proposto agora é uma posição remuneratória e meia em três anos. Não aceitamos isso” , referiu o dirigente sindical.\nPUB • CONTINUE A LER A SEGUIR\n“Não abdicamos dessa posição”, garantiu Pedro Costa, ao avançar que o ministério de Ana Paula Martins ficou de “analisar a proposta para 2026 e 2027”.\nA reunião desta quinta-feira decorreu depois de na última ronda negocial, no final de julho, o Governo ter retirado a sua proposta de aumento de 52 euros para os enfermeiros que entravam, pela primeira vez, em cada uma das categorias.\nFace a esta evolução nas negociações, o presidente do SE considerou que já foi possível dar “um salto gigante em relação à última reunião”, tendo em conta que a contraproposta esta quinta-feira apresentada pelo Governo representa uma valorização salarial de cerca de 200 euros.\n“Há possibilidade de uma aproximação numa altura em que os enfermeiros vão ser necessários para o plano de inverno, em que vamos começar com a vacinação, é preciso mostrar um sinal de força”, salientou Pedro Costa.\nTambém em declarações à Lusa, a dirigente do Sindicato dos Enfermeiros Portugueses (SEP), Guadalupe Simões, disse que a estrutura sindical tinha marcada uma reunião para esta quinta-feira, mas que foi adiada pelo Ministério da Saúde para a próxima semana, sem indicar ainda a data, alegando que “ainda estava a trabalhar no processo”.\nGuadalupe Simões adiantou que o SEP estava à espera que fosse apresentado na reunião adiada uma proposta que valorize a grelha salarial dos enfermeiros.\nSegundo a dirigente sindical, a proposta deve valorizar o início da grelha na categoria de enfermeiro e de enfermeiro-especialista e todas as posições remuneratórias de todas as categorias.\nO SEP tem agendada uma greve para 24 e 25 de setembro e uma concentração para 25.",

Windows 10 will reach its end of support on October 14, 2025, after which Microsoft will stop providing security updates and bug fixes. Home users can extend Windows 10 support for one additional year by paying $30 for Extended Security Updates (ESU). Microsoft has made a sudden move to shut down the Windows 10 Beta Channel , just five months after bringing it back to life in June 2024. The company will now automatically transfer all Beta Channel users to the Release Preview Channel as per Windows Insider .\nThe Beta Channel was revived in June with the first Windows 10 beta build in three years, aiming to support feature development with Windows Insiders. However, Microsoft has now ended the program without explaining the decision.\nCurrent statistics reveal that Windows 10 maintains a dominant position in the market, with over 60% of Windows systems worldwide still running on this version, while Windows 11 accounts for only 35% despite being available for three years.\nLooking ahead, Windows 10 version 22H2, which is the final release, will continue to receive monthly security updates until October 14 , 2025. After this date, the operating system will reach its end of support phase.\nFor users who need more time to transition, Microsoft has introduced a consumer-friendly option. Home users can purchase Extended Security Updates (ESU) for $30 , which will provide an additional year of support beyond the 2025 deadline.\nDuring its brief revival period, the Beta Channel introduced several features backported from Windows 11, including Windows Copilot, lock screen widgets, and various Microsoft service integrations. The Release Preview Channel will continue to receive Windows 10 builds, though the future of new feature releases remains uncertain as the operating system approaches its end of life.",

Off the 12 games, he played nine on English soil, scoring 556 runs at an average of 32.70.\nPant, however, had struggled the last time India played Tests – in Australia during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. In Australia, he played all five Tests and scored 255 runs at an average of 28.33, including just one half-century.\nTeam India touched down in the UK on June 7 and had wasted no time as they dived straight into intense training sessions, kickstarting their preparations for the five-Test showdown that marks the beginning of the 2025–27 ICC World Test Championship (WTC) cycle for both teams.\nThis series also signals the start of a new era for Indian cricket, following the Test retirements of stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. Led by Shubman Gill, India will face England in the first Test of the five-match series at the Headingley Cricket Ground from June 20. The second Test will be played at Edgbaston from July 2 while the third Test will be held at the iconic Lord’s beginning on July 10.\nBoth India and England will later travel to Manchester for the fourth Test to be played at Old Trafford from July 23, before concluding the Test series at the Kennington Oval in London starting on July 31.\nIndia are aiming to win a Test series in England for the first time since 2007.\n–IANS\nbc/ab",

    "text": "[Attualità](/attualita/)\nA Padova mancano mille metalmeccanici, Cna prova a frugare tra gli studenti\nMontagnin: «Nel mondo artigiano le opportunità professionali non mancano e nemmeno la soddisfazione economiche»\nNon solo informatici, ingegneri e tecnici “da tastiera”, a Padova servono anche tanti professionisti della manualità. Secondo lo studio di Cna Padova e Rovigo, elaborato a partire dall’ultima rilevazione Excelsior-Unioncamere, infatti, nella nostra provincia mancano oltre mille metalmeccanici, più di 700 magazzinieri, quasi 400 addetti alle pulizie e 300 conducenti. L’emergenza lavorativa a Padova continua a registrare numeri importanti, con un fabbisogno crescente di manodopera soprattutto in alcuni settori. Tuttavia, come rilevato da Cna Padova, molte di queste figure sono difficili da reperire: per gli operai edili, in particolare, manca all’appello il 90% del personale necessario. Per i metalmeccanici il 65%. Tra le figure più ricercate dalle aziende spiccano anche estetiste, operai specializzati nel settore tessile e dell’abbigliamento (anche a prescindere dalla crisi del settore), addetti all’assemblaggio, informatici e manutentori di attrezzature elettriche ed elettroniche. Per affrontare questa sfida, Cna ha avviato una serie di iniziative volte a sensibilizzare i giovani sulle opportunità di carriera disponibili. Tra queste, gli “Orienteering innovation labs” svoltisi presso l’Ipsia Bernardi, lo scorso 5 novembre.\nIn quell’occasione è stata sperimentata una formula di grande successo: gli “speed date”. In altre parole, i ragazzi hanno avuto l’opportunità di avere un breve colloquio direttamente con le aziende, in ottica di conoscenza reciproca. Incontri analoghi, che hanno seguito lo stesso format, si sono svolti anche presso l’istituto Valle. Altri eventi sono stato dedicati in modo specifico alle scuole medie e hanno coinvolto il VI Istituto Comprensivo \"Bruno Ciari\" e la scuola media \"Don Lorenzo Milani\". I ragazzi, in questo caso, sono andati a conoscere gli imprenditori direttamente in azienda: nel dettaglio gli studenti del Bruno Ciari hanno incontrato Italbontà srl mentre gli allievi della Don Lorenzo Milani sono stati in visita da Unox, Copiello Giovanni, MedicAir. La prossima settimana il tuor attraverso le scuole di Cna farà tappa all’istituto Manfredini di Este (3 dicembre) e successivamente alle scuole medie di Vigonza. «ll reperimento di nuovo personale da inserire in azienda - commenta il presidente di CNA Padova e Rovigo, Luca Montagnin, è una questione sempre più urgente. E anche le Piccole e Medie Imprese, in tutti i settori produttivi, devono moltiplicare le occasioni di incontro con i giovani, gli studenti e le studentesse che si stanno affacciando al mondo del lavoro. Il calo demografico, ormai ben noto, sta riducendo il numero di ragazze e ragazzi che, dopo il diploma, scelgono di avviare un percorso lavorativo. Questo fenomeno rende i giovani lavoratori una risorsa molto contesa tra le imprese, che spesso se li disputano in base a ciò che ciascuna può offrire loro in un determinato momento.\nCon Cna vogliamo dare alle imprese l’opportunità di presentarsi direttamente agli studenti, di incuriosirli e attrarli attraverso modalità interattive e innovative. Ma non solo, vogliamo anche rivolgersi a loro e alle loro famiglie per far presente che nel settore artigiano le opportunità lavorative non mancano e possono offrire percorsi di crescita molto gratificanti, anche dal punto di vista economico».",
