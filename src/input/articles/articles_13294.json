    "title": "‘No joy in our hearts’: Bethlehem’s Christians face heartbreak at Christmas",
    "text": "Bethlehem, occupied West Bank – At Christmas, Noha Helmi Tarazi normally decorates her home with a large tree, which she describes as a symbol of light and joy.\nThe 87-year-old prepares the house for her family, who gather here each year, and makes Christmas sweets and large, festive meals. She usually places presents under the Christmas tree for her grandchildren, taking care to wrap them and label them with their names.\nThis year, no one will gather in her home. Even the children do not feel like celebrating, she says.\n“There is no joy left in our hearts,” she says.\nIn the birthplace of Jesus Christ, the celebrations for Christmas are on hold. The decision to cancel Christmas has not been taken lightly, but it is one the church and community here are all united on, to show their solidarity with the Palestinians facing Israeli bombardment and a total siege in the Gaza Strip.\nIsraeli bombing and artillery fire have killed more than 20,000 people in Gaza since the war began on October 7, including at least 8,000 children. More than 300 people have been killed in the occupied West Bank, too, either by Israeli soldiers or by settlers who often attack with cover from Israeli troops.\nThe war has brought Bethlehem’s tourism – a bedrock of its economy – to a standstill at the time of the year when it usually peaks. Where visitors from around the world would usually throng Bethlehem’s markets around Christmas, the streets are empty this year.\nBut even if tourists were around, there’s no festivity among the residents of Bethlehem, many of whom have close family members in Gaza.\n“How can we celebrate Christmas in the midst of this genocidal war?” asks Tarazi, known to those close to her as Um Shadi. “How can we celebrate when people in Gaza struggle to get even one meal a day?”\nUm Shadi at her home close to Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank. She has lost two siblings during the war in Gaza and a third has been severely injured during an air strike [Munjed Jadou/Al Jazeera]\nThe images and news of the suffering in Gaza under Israel’s relentless bombardment and ground invasion are too much for her. Um Shadi, whose family lives in Gaza City, says she has been particularly disturbed by videos of people fleeing towards the sea and being forced to boil seawater to make it drinkable.\nShe grew up in the Remal neighbourhood of Gaza City and lived there through her 20s during the 1960s. She has “beautiful memories of the sea”, where she used to swim at night. People lived in peace, she says.\nLife became harder after she graduated with a degree in English literature from Cairo University in 1967. She was unable to return to Gaza because it was occupied by Israel that year, and instead, she spent the next 10 years in Libya, where her brothers also lived and where she met her husband.\nShe eventually returned to the occupied West Bank, where she made her home and built her Christmas rituals with her family – traditions she will skip this year.\n‘This Christmas, may God have mercy on them’ All signs of Christmas have disappeared from the streets and homes of Bethlehem. Usually, people flock to Manger Square, which is adorned with decorations, to watch fireworks. None of that will happen this year.\nLots of people in Bethlehem and the surrounding area have relatives in Gaza. Um Shadi herself has lost a brother and a sister since the war began.\nHer brother died on October 17 after being unable to receive a life-saving gallbladder operation because of the aerial bombardment of hospitals in the Strip.\nJust a few days later, one of her sisters died in an air strike on St Porphyrius Greek Orthodox Church, where the family had taken shelter. Another sister lost a leg during the same bombardment.\nUm Shadi looks at a picture of her sister who was killed during an air strike on a Greek Orthodox church in Gaza where she had taken shelter from the Israeli bombardment [Munjed Jadou/Al Jazeera]\nIt has always been difficult to see her family, even before the war, but now she can barely even speak to them because of the telecommunications blackouts in Gaza.\nUm Shadi was unable to attend another sister’s funeral in the enclave before the war because she was not granted a permit to travel there. Instead, her niece had to take a video of the ceremony for her.\nIn happier years, some Christians from Gaza had been able to obtain permits from the Israeli authorities to travel from Gaza to Bethlehem at Christmas – something her sisters and her friend Rose often did, she says.\n“My sisters used to visit me, and I say this year on Christmas, may God have mercy on them.”\nThe agony of not being able to communicate with her family in Gaza is unbearable, she adds. It has brought her to “the brink of despair”.\nChristmas used to be the one joyful event that everyone could count on each year, Um Shadi says. Now, that has gone, too.",

    "title": "How the Pune centre contributed to IMD’s 150-year-long journey",
    "text": "How the Pune centre contributed to IMD’s 150-year-long journey\nFrom Imperial Meteorological Department to the present-day India Meteorological Department, the department has shifted headquarters four times\nAs the India Meteorological Department (IMD) enters its 150th year on Monday, a walk down memory lane highlights its robust contribution as a national data centre and research hub in accurately forecasting the weather while also serving as a regional centre for South Asia. The journey also underscores the continuing importance of the Pune centre in making IMD the institution it is today.\nFrom Imperial Meteorological Department to the present-day India Meteorological Department, the department has shifted headquarters four times, each time in a different city belonging to a distinct climate zone. Established in Kolkata in 1875, the headquarters then shifted to Shimla in 1904 due to cyclones and heavy rainfall. In 1928, the Bhamburda area of Shivajinagar, Pune, became the IMD’s headquarters while in 1944, they shifted to Delhi during World War II.\nClick here\nDespite these shifts, Pune remained a significant centre for the IMD, with weather records spanning 123 years preserved here. Numerical modelling commenced in 1956 under the leadership of Dr P K Das, and gave a major boost to weather forecasting in the country. After the modernisation programme during 2007-12, the IMD experienced significant change in weather forecasting and services. In the last decade, the numerical weather prediction modelling capabilities of IMD Pune reached new heights with improved dynamic models run in a seamless manner from nowcasts to long-range and seasonal weather predictions.\nThe 12 km resolution global model was introduced in 2016; ensemble prediction model in 2018; extended range forecast system in 2017; dynamic MMCFS (Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecast System) for seasonal forecasting also in 2017; followed by the multi-model ensemble-based seasonal forecasting model in 2021. Due to these milestones, forecast accuracy for all types of severe weather events increased by about 50% in 2023 as compared to 2014. It is a matter of pride for IMD Pune that the data required for all the model development was provided by it through the years. Apart from this, the Pune centre also plays a crucial role in providing weather information for countries in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).\nK S Hosalikar, head of climate research and services, IMD Pune, said, “The Pune office plays a crucial role in training researchers, validating meteorological equipment, and guiding agro-meteorology. Looking ahead, the department aims to make Pune a major centre for validating weather monitoring instruments in the South Asian region.”\n“The department is planning to undertake new experiments in the field of weather observation, especially in upper air circulation. We are in the process of using drone technology to observe the upper air circulation. This technology is cost-effective and reusable. We are working in that direction too,” Hosalikar said.\nHosalikar said that the very high population density and infrastructure in the urban areas of the country demands a special approach to forecasting and early warning systems to minimise losses and overall impact of extreme weather events. “To cater to that, the IMD has a well-developed Megacity forecasting system in which different components like dense observational network, very high resolution weather models (sub-kms), high power computing systems, and disseminations are taken into account. It is also termed as urban meteorology and is built with multi-institutional approaches like IMD, local municipal and state authorities, and other agencies,” he said.",

    "text": "Lynchburg GOP sues to overturn Virginia’s ‘Convention Ban Law’\nFederal lawsuit argues state-run primaries violate First Amendment rights; follows similar legal action planned by 6th District Republicans.\nLYNCHBURG, Va. (VIRGINIA MERCURY) - The Lynchburg Republican City Committee (LRCC) on Tuesday filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Virginia Department of Elections, the State Board of Elections and Elections Commissioner Susan Beals, arguing that a 2021 law known as the “Convention Ban Law” unconstitutionally strips political parties of their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association.\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, comes on the heels of another pending legal challenge from within Virginia’s Republican Party. On March 1, the Republican Committee of Virginia’s 6th Congressional District voted 22-1 to pursue its own litigation against the same statute, claiming it deprives political parties of their ability to control how they nominate candidates.\nAt the heart of both challenges is a new section in the state code, which prohibits parties from using nomination methods that exclude voters “who are otherwise eligible to participate … but are unable to attend meetings” due to certain circumstances including having a disability, temporarily living outside the state, or experiencing a contagious disease.\nThe provision effectively bans long-standing party-run processes such as conventions, mass meetings, and firehouse primaries — instead mandating open, state-run primaries that do not require voter registration by political party.\n“The Convention Ban Law is a direct affront to our freedom of association as a party,” said LRCC Chair Veronica Bratton.\n“Until 2024, the LRCC could choose a party-run process such as a party canvass or a convention to choose its nominee. This allowed us to keep opponents of our party from participating in helping choose our candidate, or even being that candidate.”\nWith the new law taking effect, the commonwealth of Virginia requires Lynchburg Republicans “to allow Democrats, or even people who ran against our nominees, to choose our nominees, or even be our nominees,” Bratton said.\nRead more on virginiamercury.com\nCopyright 2025 WWBT.

    "title": "Declaran estado de emergencia en Florida por onda tropical sobre las Antillas Mayores con potencial de desarrollo",
    "text": "Declaran emergencia en Florida. Perturbación tropical 97L. Se aproxima al sureste de EEUU. El gobernador de Florida, Ron DeSantis, ha declarado el estado de emergencia ante la amenaza de una perturbación tropical en el Caribe. La perturbación, conocida como Invest 97L, podría convertirse en una tormenta tropical al acercarse a los Estados Unidos. Las probabilidades de desarrollo de este sistema han aumentado significativamente en los últimos días. Según el Centro de Pronósticos de FOX, aún no está claro el impacto exacto que tendrá en el país. Alerta en Florida por clima severo Declaran emergencia en Florida por onda tropical-Foto: Shutterstock El sistema podría organizarse en una depresión tropical o incluso en una tormenta tropical a finales de este fin de semana. Además, el Centro Nacional de Huracanes (NHC) informó que la onda tropical está produciendo lluvias y tormentas desorganizadas en varias áreas. También podría interesarte: ¿Maduro no puede con la presión? Hace inesperada petición en Venezuela. Estas áreas incluyen La Española, Puerto Rico, el sureste de las Bahamas y las aguas adyacentes del Atlántico y el Mar Caribe. El NHC advierte que el desarrollo de este sistema será lento en los próximos días mientras se mueve hacia el oeste-noroeste. Se espera que las condiciones ambientales sean más favorables para el desarrollo después de que pase por las Antillas Mayores. Es probable que una depresión tropical se forme este fin de semana o a principios de la próxima semana cerca de la península de Florida. El NHC recomienda a los residentes de las Antillas Mayores, las Bahamas y Florida que sigan monitoreando el progreso de este sistema. La perturbación tiene bajas probabilidades de desarrollarse en los próximos dos días, pero estas probabilidades han aumentado a «altas» para la próxima semana. Los modelos de pronóstico indican que la tormenta se moverá hacia Florida y el este del Golfo de México, aunque hay incertidumbre. El especialista en huracanes de FOX Weather, Bryan Norcross, señala que el sistema traerá mucha humedad a Florida. Se esperan lluvias torrenciales en la península de Florida y posiblemente en los estados circundantes. Asimismo, el sistema podría estancarse y permanecer cerca de la mitad norte de Florida durante varios días. De acuerdo con el portal de ‘Fox News’, áreas desde la costa norte del Golfo hasta las Carolinas podrían verse afectadas por la tormenta. No se descarta una trayectoria en bucle donde la tormenta impacte las mismas áreas varias veces. Debido a la rápida evolución del sistema, habrá poco tiempo para prepararse en Florida. La meteoróloga del medio citado, Britta Merwin, advierte que el tiempo de preparación será de aproximadamente 24 horas. Es posible que la tormenta se desarrolle cuando ya haya lluvia en tierra, lo que complicaría la situación. Si el sistema se convierte en tormenta tropical, se llamará Debby, la cuarta de la temporada de huracanes del Atlántico de 2024. Independientemente de si se convierte en tormenta tropical, el sistema traerá lluvias intensas a Florida. Merwin enfatiza que Florida tendrá lluvias intensas durante el sábado y continúen hasta el lunes, por lo que es importante estar preparado. La posibilidad de inundaciones es alta en varias áreas de Florida durante estos días. Las autoridades aconsejan mantenerse informados a través de fuentes oficiales y seguir las recomendaciones de seguridad. Es importante que la comunidad esté alerta y preparada para cualquier eventualidad relacionada con la tormenta. La declaración de estado de emergencia busca proteger a los residentes y minimizar los daños potenciales, apuntó ‘Fox Weather‘. Para escuchar el podcast da click en la imagen FOTO: MundoNOW",

    "title": "Raising the Bar: Canada's Bold Push for Heat Pumps and Energy Efficiency",
    "text": "In the heart of a nation grappling with the dual challenges of climate change and energy efficiency, the Trudeau government has introduced the Raising the Bar campaign. This initiative, aiming squarely at the climate crisis, showcases a determined push towards adopting heat pumps to slash greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, beneath the surface of this seemingly straightforward solution lies a complex narrative of ambition, skepticism, and the quest for tangible impact.\nThe Drive Towards Energy Efficiency\nAt the core of the Raising the Bar campaign is a compelling video narrative, featuring Canadians who are taking steps to replace gas heating systems with electric heat pumps. These aren't just isolated acts of environmental consciousness but part of a broader governmental effort to pivot households away from oil-fired furnaces. The promise? A significant reduction in heating bills and a meaningful cut in the emissions that exacerbate the global warming crisis. To sweeten the deal, the Trudeau government has unfurled financial incentives, boosting grants from $10,000 to a notable $15,000, with an additional $250 bonus payment dangling as an extra carrot for early adopters.\nChallenges on the Horizon\nDespite these incentives, the uptake has been less than stellar. Nationwide, only 80 installations have been executed—a drop in the ocean compared to the program's ambitions. This lukewarm response is further complicated by a 29% rejection rate among the 1,241 applications received. The reasons behind this are manifold but highlight a significant gap between governmental intentions and public reception. Moreover, skepticism isn't just rooted in the program's uptake but also in the broader narrative around climate change. Questions loom large about the evidence linking worsening extreme weather events directly to climate phenomena, especially within the Canadian context. This skepticism threatens to undermine not just the Raising the Bar campaign but the overall narrative around the urgency of tackling climate change.\nFinancial Feasibility and Future Directions\nThe financial aspect of the Raising the Bar campaign is another point of contention. Originally estimated at $750 million, the program's cost has now ballooned to an eye-watering $2.7 billion. This near quadrupling of expenses raises questions about the program's sustainability and effectiveness in meeting its environmental goals. Despite these challenges, the Trudeau government remains steadfast in its climate ambitions. Apart from the Raising the Bar campaign, it has also laid out plans to implement net-zero regulations on electricity generation by 2035, a move that exempts only the Atlantic provinces from the carbon tax on heating fuels. This ambitious regulatory framework underscores the government's commitment to a greener future but also highlights the hurdles in balancing policy, public acceptance, and practical outcomes.\nIn conclusion, the Raising the Bar campaign represents a microcosm of the broader challenges facing climate change initiatives worldwide. While the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the adoption of heat pumps is commendable, the path is fraught with hurdles—ranging from public skepticism to financial feasibility. The Trudeau government's efforts to encourage Canadians to embrace energy-efficient practices reflect a determined stride towards a sustainable future. However, the success of such initiatives hinges not just on governmental will but on bridging the gap between ambition and tangible, widespread impact.",
