    "text": "Community rallies to help ‘wobbly’ pup\nAn energetic dog with a mysterious neurological condition is one step closer to getting the help he needs, thanks to an outpouring of support from the community. After launching a fundraiser to cover the cost of advanced diagnostic testing, the Wayne County Dog Shelter recently announced its goal of $4,800 has been met.\nThe dog, a male stray named Henna, exhibits a range of concerning signs including unsteady walking, falls, head bobbing, occasionally running into objects and chasing imaginary butterflies. While his behavior is endearing, shelter staff members believe it may be rooted in an undiagnosed neurological disorder.\n“Henna came to the shelter as a stray from Salt Creek Road with two younger pups,” said Summer Foss, shelter manager. “Of course, the pups had a line of adopters wanting them, and they got new homes immediately. Henna watched them leave while he stayed. He trips over his own feet, and he runs into things, but dang it, he’s cute when he does it. He's a very adorable dog.”\nWith funding now secured, shelter staff will schedule a comprehensive series of diagnostic tests including blood work, X-rays, an MRI and a CT scan to try to pinpoint the underlying cause of his symptoms.\n“We’re so thankful for everyone who donated, shared Henna’s story or sent kind words,” Foss said. “Because of you, we’re finally able to move forward with the appropriate steps towards pinpointing a diagnosis for Henna. He deserves this chance at a better life.”\nShelter staff said any remaining funds from the campaign will be used to help other special-needs animals in their care.\nDan Starcher is the public communications coordinator for Wayne County.",

    "title": "Like Your Calendar? Thank the Catholic Church",
    "text": "Like Your Calendar? Thank the Catholic Church\nIf you like saying, 'Happy new year' on January 1, you should say a prayer of gratitude to Pope Gregory XIII.\nOn the night of October 4, 1582, the citizens of Spain and its colonies, Portugal, Poland, and most of Italy went to bed and woke up ten days later.\nThe peculiar event was not some medieval miracle but was, in fact, an effort by the Church to bring about a badly needed change to time. Having decreed months before that a reform of the calendar was essential for the good of Western civilization, Pope Gregory XIII (r. 1572-1585) implemented a new calendar on the night of October 4. The next day, part of the massive fix of the Julian calendar, was counted not as October 5, but October 15, 1582. The calendar reform proved one of the most important and impressive accomplishments for the progress of Europe in the whole of the Renaissance.\nFor critics of the Church, the sixteenth century is a seeming treasury of embarrassments for Catholics—from the so-called “\nbad popes” to the Inquisition to the Protestant Reformation. But the crown jewel for criticism is Galileo and his supposed persecution by an obscurantist, tyrannical, and unenlightened papacy. Lost in much of the rhetoric surrounding Galileo, however, was the immense accomplishment of Pope Gregory XIII in bringing desperately needed changes to the calendar.\nThe problem has always been the fact that a year cannot contain neatly organized days or months. Put simply, the interval between successive vernal equinoxes (every 365.2424 days) is approximately eleven minutes less than 365 and one quarter days. At the same time, the synodic period of the moon (i.e., the time between each full moon or new moon) is around twenty-nine and a half days, so that twelve months add up to only about 354 days. A calendar that incorporates the movements of both the sun and the moon thus becomes quite a challenge, and people of many civilizations have certainly given it their best shot.\nThe most influential, not to mention widely adopted, effort to solve the dilemma was the Julian calendar, introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 B.C. to replace the longstanding Roman calendar that had grown hopelessly inaccurate by the use of the lunar year and the intercalary month. His idea, with a little help from Sosigenes, an Alexandrine astronomer, was to create a solar calendar with months of fixed lengths. Rather than try to introduce a gentle change, Caesar instituted what became called the “year of confusion” by adding ninety days to the year to realign the months of the Roman calendar with the seasons. The first Julian year commenced with January 1, 46 B.C., the 708th year from the foundation of the city.\nThe result was that the average length of the Julian calendar year was 365.25 days. To account as best it could for the subtle but important deviations in the passage of time, every fourth year included an intercalary day to maintain synchrony between the calendar year and the tropical year. Caesar organized the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months (i.e., January, March, May, July, September, and November) to have thirty-one days, and the other months thirty, excepting February, which in common years should have only twenty-nine days, but every fourth year thirty days. To keep himself even with his illustrious predecessor, Emperor Augustus added an extra day to August to have as many days as July, which had been named after the first Caesar. So a day was taken from February and given to August; to prevent three months straight of thirty-one days, September and November were reduced to thirty days, and October and December were assigned thirty-one. The additional day every fourth year was added to February, the shortest month. In modern calendars, the intercalary day is still added to February, but as the twenty-ninth.\nThe Julian calendar remained in use throughout the entire history of the Roman Empire. The Church naturally adopted it in the development of the liturgical calendar. Easter was placed on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the vernal (spring) equinox. Obviously, then, the calculation of the equinox assumed considerable and understandable importance. If the equinox was wrong, then Easter was celebrated on the wrong day, and the placement of most of the other observances—such as the starts of Lent and Pentecost—would also be in error.\nAs the Julian calendar was far from perfect, errors did indeed begin to creep into the keeping of time. Because of the inherent imprecision of the calendar, the calculated year was too long by eleven minutes and fourteen seconds. The problem only grew worse with each passing year as the equinox slipped backward one full day on the calendar every 130 years. For example, at the time of its introduction, the Julian calendar placed the equinox on March 25. By the time of the Council of Nicea in 325, the equinox had fallen back to March 21. By 1500, the equinox had shifted by ten days.\nThe ten days were of increasing importance also to navigation and agriculture, causing severe problems for sailors, merchants, and farmers whose livelihood depended upon precise measurements of time and the seasons. At the same time, throughout the Middle Ages, the use of the Julian calendar brought many local variations and peculiarities that are the constant source of frustration to historians. For example, many medieval ecclesiastical records, financial transactions, and the counting of dates from the feast days of saints did not adhere to the standard Julian calendar, but reflected local adjustments. Not surprisingly, confusion was the result.\nThe Church was aware of the inaccuracy, and by the end of the fifteenth century, there was widespread agreement among Church leaders that not celebrating Easter on the right day—the most important and most solemn event on the calendar—was a scandal.\nPope Sixtus IV (r. 1471-1484) made the first effort to reform the calendar, hiring the astronomer Johann Müller, who, unfortunately, was murdered soon after. As the work of other astronomers could not gain universal acceptance owing to problems of competing national interests and varying opinions, the Church remained the best chance of promulgating a definitive solution to a growing crisis.\nPope St. Pius V introduced a new breviary in 1568 and missal in 1570 in keeping with the mandate of the\nCouncil of Trent, and both of the new texts included adjustments to the lunar tables and the leap year system. The problem of Easter, however, remained, as did the basic difficulties with the Julian calendar.\nIn 1563, the Council of Trent had approved a plan in principle to restore the date of the vernal equinox to that of 325 and to install the needed changes to the calendar to make the calculation of Easter more accurate. Italian astronomer and doctor Luigi Lilius proposed a solution in his ambitious work Compendium novae rationis restituendi kalendarium (Compendium of the New Plan for the Restoration of the Calendar). He suggested a slow ten-day correction to amend the temporal drift since Nicaea and a more careful application of the leap day. Lilius died in 1576, but his brother presented his theories to the one person who could do something about them: the pope.\nCardinal Ugo Buoncompagni had been elected Pope Gregory XIII on May 13, 1572 as successor to Pope Pius, and he was determined to fix things once and for all. Happily receiving the manuscript, the pope appointed a commission to investigate solutions. He placed at its head a Jesuit mathematician and astronomer named Christoph Clavius. The basic ideas of Lilius were adopted, but Clavius preferred that any correction should take place in one sweeping move rather than a gradual implementation. The commission’s recommendations were then presented to the pope and were promulgated by the pontiff in the papal bull Inter Gravissimus, signed on February 24, 1582.\nLike Julius Caesar before him, the pope agreed that small adjustments were no longer viable. Instead, he decreed that Clavius’s approach should be followed: ten days would be removed from the calendar. So October 4 was followed by October 15. With one act, the vernal equinox of 1583 and those that followed would occur around March 20, a date much closer to that of the Council of Nicaea. To overcome the challenge of losing one day every 130 years, the new calendar omitted three leap years every 400 years so that century years were leap years only when divisible by 400. Using this method, 1600 and 2000 were leap years, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not.\nTechnically, the pope could not decree that nations and kingdoms adopt the new calendar, but its value was noted immediately in repairing centuries of inaccuracy on the part of the Julian calendar. The new calendar was first inaugurated in Spain, Portugal, Spanish colonies in the New World, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and most of Italy. The Holy Roman Empire followed, and then the rest of the Catholic world. France deployed the new calendar in December 1582.\nHad the reform occurred a century before, it would have been much easier to implement across all of what was then a united Christendom. As it was, in a post-Reformation Europe, the new computations were greeted with suspicion in the lands that were no longer Catholic. Protestant Germany adopted the calendar slowly. Prussia accepted it in 1610, while the rest of the Protestant states decreed it only in 1700.\nThe English, especially during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (r. 1558-1603), rejected any thought of adopting a calendar created under the name of a pope and remained long suspicious that this was some Catholic plot. Consequently, even as anti-Catholic bigots in the English Isles lampooned the popes as enemies of progress, they were ten days behind everyone else in Western Europe for over 150 years. And after the leap year of 1700, they were eleven days behind. The English compounded the dating dilemma further by celebrating New Year not on January 1, but according to the older custom of March 25. As the American colonies adhered to the English system, they shared in the temporal displacement. Americans now celebrate the birth of George Washington on February 22, 1732, according to the Gregorian calendar. However, according to the English reckoning, he was born on February 11, 1731-32.\nAcknowledging at last that the continued use of the Julian calendar and celebrating the new year on March 25 were “attended with divers inconveniences,” the British Parliament passed the Calendar (New Style) Act in 1750. The New Year would begin on January 1 rather than March 25, and time would be counted according to the Gregorian calendar. The act went into effect on September 2, 1752, and the next day was decreed September 14, 1782.\nRussia and the Eastern Orthodox churches rejected the new calendar and continued to use the Julian calendar in their calculations for Easter. The Gregorian calendar was accepted as the civic calendar in Russia only after the Russian Revolution in 1917. The Eastern Orthodox continue to use a revised Julian calendar, with the exception of the Finnish Orthodox Church, which adopted the Gregorian calendar.\nThe Gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today and has fulfilled well the aspirations of Pope Gregory XIII. And so, the same Church that was supposedly the obstacle to progress and science gave to the world a reliable means of counting the days that has withstood the test of time.\nDonatewww.catholic.com/support-us",

Les performances opérationnelles des autres activités contribuent également à cette amélioration. Le Royaume-Uni réalise une bonne performance, notamment dans l’activité commercialisation. En Italie, la performance de la plupart des activités contribue à la progression de l’EBITDA. En outre, Dalkia réalise une performance commerciale très satisfaisante.\n- Résultat Net\nLe résultat financier représente une charge de 3,3 milliards d’euros, en légère amélioration de 0,2 milliard d’euros par rapport à 2022 en raison de :\n- la bonne performance du portefeuille des actifs dédiés avec un rendement de 10,2 % (vs -8,5 % en 2022), permise par l’évolution favorable des marchés financiers, et en particulier des marchés action en 2023, qui se traduit par une amélioration des autres produits et charges financières de 6,5 milliards d’euros (avec un impact cash limité) ;\n- la hausse de la charge de désactualisation de 4,2 milliards d’euros, principalement liée à la stabilité du taux réel d’actualisation des provisions nucléaires en France en 2023, après l’impact positif de la hausse de 50 points de base en 2022 (sans impact cash) ;\n- l’augmentation du coût de l’endettement financier brut de 2,1 milliards d’euros principalement liée à la hausse significative des taux d’intérêt (avec un effet cash de 1,8 milliard d’euros).\nLe résultat financier courant s’établit à -5,6 milliards d’euros, en baisse de 5,4 milliards d’euros. Il est retraité des éléments non récurrents, dont en particulier la variation de juste valeur du portefeuille d’actifs dédiés.\nLe résultat net courant s’élève à 18,5 milliards d’euros. La hausse de 31,1 milliards d’euros reflète la forte croissance de l’EBITDA diminuée de la charge d’impôt (un produit d’impôt était enregistré en 2022).\nLe résultat net part du Groupe s’élève à 10,0 milliards d’euros, en progression de près de 28 milliards d’euros. Outre la forte augmentation du résultat net courant, la hausse s’explique notamment par les éléments après impôt suivants :\n- la variation de juste valeur des instruments financiers pour 4.0 milliards d’euros ;\n- une dépréciation de la valeur du projet Hinkley Point C et du Goodwill d’EDF Energy en 2023 pour 7,9 milliards d’euros après l’annonce du délai et des coûts supplémentaires faite en janvier 2024.\n- Cash-flow\nLe cash-flow s’établit à 9,3 milliards d’euros versus -24,6 milliards d’euros en 2022. Il s’explique par un EBITDA cash de 43,9 milliards d’euros dû à une bonne performance opérationnelle et à un effet prix très élevé. Il bénéficie également du débouclage des positions de trading 2022 en 2023 à hauteur de 5,3 milliards d’euros.\nLe besoin en fonds de roulement augmente de 7,8 milliards d’euros, dont :\n- 5,1 milliards d’euros pour l’activité d’optimisation/trading liés notamment aux appels de marge restitués à mesure que les positions se sont débouclées en 2023.\n- 3,9 milliards d’euros liés à la créance du bouclier tarifaire 2023 en CSPE qui est compensée par les recettes d’obligations d’achat moindres dans un contexte de baisse des prix, les versements de l’Etat au titre des compensations 2023 et la régularisation des surcompensations des années précédentes.\nCe cash-flow permet de financer des investissements nets de 19,1 milliards d’euros, en hausse de 2,7 milliards d’euros en raison notamment du projet Hinkley Point C, de la maintenance importante du parc nucléaire et du développement des réseaux.\n- Endettement financier net\nL’endettement financier net (1) atteint 54,4 milliards d’euros, en recul de 10,1 milliards d’euros par rapport à fin 2022. En plus du cash-flow positif, la conversion des OCEANE de 2,4 milliards d’euros contribue au renforcement des capitaux propres.\nLes émissions obligataires réalisées pendant l’année pour un montant d’environ 8 milliards d’euros, la baisse du niveau de la dette court terme et les remboursements anticipés de prêts bancaires permettent un allongement de la maturité de la dette financière à 11 ans à fin 2023 (versus 9,4 ans à fin 2022).\nEDF s’est vu décerner le prix 2024 de l’International Financing Review (IFR) dans la catégorie « Corporate Issuer » pour son activité d’émission en 2023.\nRésultats financiers par segment :\nLa ventilation du chiffre d’affaires est présentée aux bornes des segments, avant les éliminations inter-segments.\n- France - Activités de production et commercialisation\n| |\n(en millions d'euros)\n|2022||2023||Variation organique|\n|Chiffre d’affaires||48 686||64 244||31,9 %|\n|EBITDA||-23 144||24 677||N/A|\nLa très forte hausse de l’EBITDA s’explique par le redressement progressif de la production nucléaire pour un effet favorable de 5,7 milliards d’euros.\nEn 2022, les mesures régulatoires exceptionnelles adoptées en France par le gouvernement, afin de limiter la hausse des prix de vente aux consommateurs, avaient pénalisé l’EBITDA pour un montant estimé à\n8,2 milliards d’euros.\nLa baisse de la production nucléaire en 2022 avait conduit à des achats de volumes importants à des prix de marché très élevés, avec des effets nettement réduits en 2023 : cela représente un effet positif de 7,3 milliards d’euros.\nDe plus, la hausse des prix a un impact de 12,1 milliards d’euros pour les consommateurs finals et de 12,5 milliards d’euros pris en charge par le bouclier tarifaire. Elle s'explique notamment par un prix de marché moyen à terme pour 2023 des 2 années précédentes de 218 €/MWh versus 71 €/MWh pour 2022 et un prix de l’écrêtement ARENH de 410€/MWh pour 2023 versus 257€/MWh pour 2022.\n- France - Activités régulées (2)\n| |\n(en millions d'euros)\n|2022||2023||Variation organique|\n|Chiffre d’affaires||18 082||19 413||7,4 %|\n|EBITDA||6 723||3 707||-44,9 %|\n|Dont Enedis||5 864||2 699||-54,0 %|\nLa baisse de l’EBITDA s’explique principalement par un effet prix négatif estimé à 1,3 milliard d’euros, en raison d’achats des pertes réseaux effectués à des prix de marché très élevés (ce surcoût sera compensé dans les hausses de tarif futures). En revanche, l’évolution du TURPE a un effet favorable estimé à 0,7 milliard d’euros (3).\nDe plus, une rétrocession a été accordée en 2022 par RTE au titre des recettes d’interconnexion pour un montant de 1,7 milliard d’euros (4) sans équivalent en 2023.\nLa baisse des volumes acheminés hors effet climat de 8,2 TWh, a un impact négatif limité en EBITDA pour un montant estimé à 0,1 milliard d’euros.\n- EDF Renouvelables - Énergies Renouvelables\nRenouvelables Groupe hors activité hydraulique France\n|(en millions d'euros)||2022||2023||Variation organique|\n|Chiffre d'affaires||3 647||3 636||4,6 %|\n|EBITDA||1 191||1 712||43,6 %|\n|Investissements nets||1 894||2 016||6,4 %|\nDont EDF Renouvelables\n| |\n(en millions d'euros)\n|2022||2023||Variation organique|\n|Chiffre d’affaires||2 158||2 031||2,6 %|\n|EBITDA||909||932||2,8 %|\n|Dont EBITDA production||1 246||1 234||1,8 %|\nL’augmentation de l’EBITDA Renouvelables Groupe s’explique par une hausse de 14 % de la production éolienne et solaire grâce aux nouvelles capacités installées qui atteignent 15,1 GW nets à fin 2023. En Italie et en Belgique, la production hydraulique est également en nette progression dans un contexte de prix favorable.\nConcernant EDF Renouvelables, l’EBITDA production progresse grâce à la hausse des volumes produits de 10,9 % grâce aux mises en service de parcs réalisées en 2022 et 2023 et malgré des conditions de vents moins favorables, notamment au Royaume-Uni et aux Etats Unis. Par ailleurs, la baisse des prix impacte les seuls parcs exposés aux prix de marché.\nLes investissements Renouvelables Groupe sont en hausse, en particulier en raison de développement d’importants parcs solaires aux Etats Unis (dont Fox Squirrel - 753 MW bruts et Desert Quartzite - 527 MW bruts), au Royaume-Uni et de parcs éoliens au Brésil (Eólico Serra do Seridó et Serra das Almas).\n- Dalkia - Services Énergétiques\nServices Énergétiques Groupe (5)\n|(en millions d'euros)||2022||2023||Variation organique|\n|Chiffre d'affaires||8 578||8 618||0,6 %|\n|EBITDA||440||535||18,2 %|\n|Investissements nets||572||589||3 %|\nDont Dalkia\n| |\n(en millions d'euros)\n|2022||2023||Variation organique|\n|Chiffre d’affaires||6 663||6 395||-3,6 %|\n|EBITDA||333||407||22,8 %|\nLes activités de services en France de Dalkia, Sowee, Izivia, ainsi que l’activité d’Edison Next en Italie contribuent à la progression de l’EBITDA des Services Energétiques Groupe.\nConcernant Dalkia, l’augmentation de l’EBITDA s’explique par la performance des activités commerciales notamment en France dans les services d’efficacité énergétique et les activités de décarbonation. De plus, les installations de cogénération ont fonctionné pendant tout le 1er trimestre 2023 (en 2022, Dalkia avait été impacté par leur arrêt anticipé du fait du raccourcissement de l’hiver tarifaire).\nLa hausse des investissements est principalement portée par Dalkia et Edison Next.\n- Framatome\n|(en millions d'euros)||2022||2023||Variation organique|\n|Chiffre d'affaires||4 122||4 066||-2,0 %|\n|EBITDA||589||597||-0,3 %|\n|EBITDA contributif groupe EDF||328||255||-25,3 %|\nL’évolution de l’EBITDA s’explique par l’augmentation des activités de services à la base installée pour le compte d’EDF et la montée en cadence des projets liés au nouveau nucléaire en France et au Royaume-Uni. L'EBITDA contributif Groupe recule essentiellement en Amérique du Nord (difficultés financières dans l’exécution d’un contrat de rénovation d’un contrôle commande de sûreté et moindre production temporaire de l’usine d’assemblage de combustible nucléaire).\nLes prises de commandes s’établissent à environ 4,8 milliards d’euros à fin 2023, en hausse versus fin 2022 notamment grâce aux activités de Base Installée en Amérique du Nord.\nFramatome a finalisé fin 2023 avec Naval Group, l’acquisition de Jeumont Electric. Cette transaction permet à Framatome de consolider ses activités dans le secteur de l’énergie nucléaire en intégrant un fournisseur spécialisé dans la fabrication et la maintenance des moteurs et d’équipements pour le secteur de l’énergie.\n- Royaume-Uni\n| |\n(en millions d'euros)\n|2022||2023||Variation organique|\n|Chiffre d’affaires||16 098||21 132||33,3 %|\n|EBITDA||1 325||3 967||x3|\nLa hausse de l'EBITDA s'explique en particulier par la performance des ventes dans les segments des moyennes et grandes entreprises qui a permis de renforcer les marges et les parts de marché. Les allocations prévues dans le calcul du plafonnement des tarifs résidentiels, qui permettent aux fournisseurs de recouvrer une partie des coûts supportés au plus fort de la crise de l'énergie, ont entrainé un rétablissement des marges sur le marché résidentiel.\nLa performance opérationnelle a été solide pour l'activité de production, l'effet lié à des prix nucléaires réalisés plus élevés ayant été partiellement compensé par ceux d’une production nucléaire de 37,3 TWh en baisse de 6,3 TWh à la suite de la fermeture d'Hinkley Point B en août 2022 (-4,1 TWh) et d'un programme de maintenance plus chargé qu’en 2022.\n- Italie\n| |\n(en millions d'euros)\n|2022||2023||Variation organique|\n|Chiffre d’affaires||29 302||17 787||-39,5 %|\n|EBITDA||1 115||1 855||65,3 %|\nLa hausse de l’EBITDA s’explique, dans les activités de production d’électricité, par une meilleure production renouvelable et en particulier une hausse de la production hydraulique grâce à de meilleures conditions d’hydraulicité. Néanmoins, l’effet prix défavorable du thermique limite cette tendance.\nDans les activités de commercialisation, les marges ont été redressées dans tous les segments de clients.\nEnfin, les activités gaz bénéficient d’une bonne optimisation du portefeuille de contrats d’approvisionnement malgré le fort impact négatif lié à des livraisons de GNL en provenance des Etats Unis qui n’ont pas été honorées.\nLes capacités éoliennes et solaires s’établissent à 650 MW nets (6) à fin 2023.\n- Autre international\n|(en millions d'euros)||2022||2023||Variation organique|\n|Chiffre d'affaires||5 659||5 583||-1,7 %|\n|EBITDA||336||872||x2,5|\n|Dont Belgique||118||673||x6|\n|Dont Brésil||225||210||-7,6 %|\nEn Belgique (7), la progression de l’EBITDA s’explique par une meilleure production nucléaire (+6 %) après une année 2022 marquée par des achats d’énergie à prix élevés conjugués à l’arrêt de la centrale de Chooz. La production hydraulique est également en progression (+54 %), ainsi que la production éolienne (+29 %) dans un contexte de prix élevés.\nLes capacités éoliennes s’élèvent à 633 MW nets (8) à fin 2023.\nAu Brésil, l’EBITDA est en légère baisse du fait du recul des services système et d’un effet prix spot défavorable, malgré la revalorisation du prix de 5 % du Power Purchase Agreement attaché à la centrale d’EDF Norte Fluminense en novembre 2022.\n- Autres métiers\n|(en millions d'euros)||2022||2023||Variation organique|\n|Chiffre d'affaires||19 724||7 677||-59,7 %|\n|EBITDA||7 089||3 255||-52,2 %|\n|Dont activités gazières||606||-66||-110,9 %|\n|Dont EDF Trading||6 407||3 230||-47,5 %|\nLa baisse des prix et la moindre activité du terminal de Dunkerque, après une année 2022 exceptionnelle dans un contexte de prix de marché de gros très élevés, expliquent le net recul de l’EBITDA des activités gazières.\nDans un contexte de baisse des risques de marché et de contrepartie, EDF Trading réalise d’excellentes performances nettement supérieures à celles de 2021, avant la crise énergétique. Ces performances, en baisse toutefois par rapport à 2022 du fait du recul des prix et de la volatilité sur les marchés de gros en 2023, s’expliquent notamment par une bonne diversification.\nExtrait

    "text": "19/01/2024 - 20:11 A Inter de Milão venceu a Lazio por 3 a 0 nesta sexta-feira (19), em Riade, na Arábia Saudita, e avançou à final da Supercopa da Itália, onde vai enfrentar o Napoli na segunda-feira. Os ‘interistas’, campeões das duas últimas edições, podem se tornar o segundo time da história da competição – criada em 1988 – a vencê-la três vezes seguidas, depois do Milan (1992, 1993 e 1994). O técnico da Inter, Simone Inzaghi, pode erguer o troféu pela quinta vez na carreira, o que seria um novo recorde para um treinador. “Abordamos muito bem o jogo, os meninos jogaram muito bem. Estamos na final, que era o que queríamos, agora temos que nos recuperar fisicamente para o jogo contra o Napoli, que será muito difícil”, declarou Inzaghi. A vitória desta sexta-feira do líder da Serie A e atual vice-campeão europeu veio com gols de Marcus Thuram (aos 17 minutos), Hakah Calhanoglu (50′, de pênalti) e Davide Frattesi na reta final (87′). “Fizemos um ótimo jogo. Desfrutamos muito, como não fazíamos há muito tempo”, disse Nicolo Barella à Mediaset. Na quinta-feira, o Napoli, atual campeão italiano, mas apenas oitavo na edição atual, obteve uma vitória maiúscula sobre a Fiorentina, também por 3 a 0, na primeira semifinal. Depois de 2018 e 2019, a Supercopa da Itália está sendo disputada pela terceira vez na Arábia Saudita. Desta vez estreia uma fórmula inédita com quatro times, o campeão da última Serie A (Napoli) e o vice-campeão (Lazio), além do campeão da última Copa da Itália (Inter) e sua vítima na final daquele torneio (Fiorentina). — Resultados da Supercopa da Itália, disputada em Riad: – Semifinais: Quinta-feira: Napoli 3 Simeone (22′), Zerbin (84′ e 86′) Fiorentina 0 Sexta-feira: Inter de Milão 3 Thuram (17′), Calhanoglu (50′ de pênalti), Frattesi (87′) Lazio 0 – Final: Segunda-feira (16h00, horário de Brasília): Napoli – Inter de Milão jr/nip/dr/cl/aam/mvv Siga a IstoÉ no Google News e receba alertas sobre as principais notícias",

    "text": "Aymen Hussein scored two first-half headers as Iraq stunned Asian Cup favourites Japan 2-1 on Friday to reach the knockout rounds.It was Japan's first Asian Cup group-stage defeat in 26 matches and set them on a potential collision course with South Korea in the last 16 in Qatar, assuming they still progress.Iraq -- ranked 63 in the world to Japan's 17 -- endured a nervous finish after Liverpool's Wataru Endo pulled one back in the third of eight minutes of injury time.But they held on and now have six points after beating Indonesia 3-1 in their opening match.They play Vietnam in their final group game on Wednesday.Four-time champions Japan have three points after beating Vietnam 4-2 in their opener and face Indonesia, also on Wednesday.Hajime Moriyasu's side went into the game in Doha on the back of a 10-game winning streak in which they scored 43 goals.But they had no answer for Iraq's power and aggression, backed by the support of almost 40,000 in the crowd.Japan had a penalty award rightly overturned by VAR in the second half.Moriyasu's team were again missing injured Brighton winger Kaoru Mitoma, who was not named in the matchday squad.Takefusa Kubo, who has scored six goals for Real Sociedad this season, started after coming off the bench against Vietnam.Hussein was one of five changes in the Iraq starting lineup, coming into the side after scoring as a substitute against Indonesia.The striker wasted little time in getting on the scoresheet again, heading home after Japan goalkeeper Zion Suzuki flapped at a cross.Japan had made a similarly slow start against Vietnam, conceding two first-half goals before turning things around before the break.But they found Iraq far tougher and failed to create any clear-cut chances for the rest of the first half.Instead it was Iraq who scored again in injury time, Hussein holding off Hiroki Ito to nod home from close range.Japan brought on Takehiro Tomiyasu at the break for the Arsenal defender's first appearance of the tournament.Japan won a penalty in the 56th minute when Rebin Solaka was adjudged to have tripped Takuma Asano.But a VAR check revealed the tackle to have been a clean one, and Ritsu Doan was also out of luck when he curled a free kick over the bar less than 10 minutes later.Substitute Mohanad Ali almost gave Iraq a third goal midway through the second half but his shot rolled agonisingly wide of the post.Endo gave Japan hope when he pulled one back deep in injury time but it was too late.",
