Mike DeWine has announced the state’s 2024-2026 Suicide Prevention Plan, according to a press release from his office.\nWhat You Need To Know Gov. Mike DeWine has announced the state’s 2024-2026 Suicide Prevention Plan\nThe plan is a partnership between DeWine’s RecoveryOhio initiative and the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation\nThe plan, which received input from 30 different organizations, will focus on raising awareness, improving data, expand access to health care and provide support to those who have lost someone to suicide\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide, you can call or text 988 The plan, the release states, is a partnership between DeWine’s RecoveryOhio initiative and the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation that seeks to “promote life-saving strategies statewide.”\n“The heartbreak of losing a family member to suicide is a pain that cuts deep, leaving behind a void that words can't fully capture,“ DeWine said in the release. “This plan will bring about a system-wide commitment to reduce suicides and encourage communities to work collectively to foster understanding and destigmatize mental health challenges.”\nThe plan, which received input from 30 different organizations, will focus on raising awareness, improving data, expand access to health care and provide support to those who have lost someone to suicide, according to the release.\n“It underscores the importance of collaborative efforts with behavioral health care providers, employers, health care systems, schools, and community organizations to stem the increasing rates of suicides,” the release states.\nThe release cites data from the Ohio Department of Health , saying Ohio saw 1,766 suicides in 2021, an 8% increase from 2020. The year 2018 saw the highest in a decade with 1,836.\nThe release also cited national data from the Centers for Disease Control , reporting nearly 50,000 deaths by suicide in 2022, with middle-aged adults being the highest cohort.\n“We are grateful for Governor DeWine’s leadership and focus on improving the lives of individuals who are struggling with mental health and suicide,” said Tony Coder, executive director of the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation, in the release. “We believe that suicide prevention is a health issue that anyone can be an active participant in and we are grateful that this plan is a strategy that can help more individuals seek care.”\nRelated Stories Public Health Fund of Ohio awards $350,000 in funding for suicide prevention strategies\nReport shows suicides increased in Ohio in 2021",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#106](c106#c-106) Ese es el que es público, que cualquiera por 18€ se puede apuntar. Los privados de las DESPEDIDAS, CUMPLEAÑOS, EMPRESAS, que anuncian en sus páginas no cuentan para molestar, verdad?\n[#33](c33#c-33) pueden bailar lo que les de la gana en su casa… o en un sitio que sea para bailar. Y a mi esto me parece que está muy bien para que pase un día o dos. El tener a unos colgados con cascos todos los dias delante de tu casa haciendo el mongol no creo que sea agradable.\n[#57](c57#c-57) No sé las drogas, las armas y el juego generan mucho dinero, pero estas si parece que se pueden criticar\n[#49](c49#c-49) El otro día en el trabajo un americano me preguntó: \"¿ A dónde va un Español cuando quiere ir de vacaciones? \"\nMe cago en los muertos de catetos y caciques que han apostado fuertesimo al turismo.\n[#155](c155#c-155) Si veis como algo positivo que seamos el resort de occidente, que de puertas para afuera solo somos turismo, pues fale 😀\nA ver la frase fue mas bien \"A donde vas de vacaciones cuando vives en España\"\n[#157](c157#c-157) pues ya te digo, desde la distancia y sin conoceros ni a tu compañero ni a ti, me parece un pregunta fruto de la curiosidad.\n[#28](c28#c-28) Tienes un vídeo en la noticia.\nOcupan bastante espacio público y como actividad turística no tiene micho sentido, pero claro, en el tiempo en que nos ha tocado vivir donde hay que presumir de hacer algo \"distinto\" y por supuesto colgarlo/comentarlo en las redes sociales...\n[#4](c4#c-4)\nResumir la avalancha de turismo que se sufre en muchas capitales de éste país diciendo que les molesta que la gente se lo pase bien es demagogia nivel dios.\nTodo tiene un límite, las ciudades también, y en muchas están superando el límite de convivencia y de capacidad para que una ciudad siga siendo y funcionando para que sus habitantes vivan.\nSe tomarán medidas contra ésta locura, no lo dudo, porque es un problema que crece al mismo ritmo que la mala educación de la gente.\n[#31](c31#c-31) Me apostaría 100€ a que si por tu barrio pasaran estos grupos cada 10 min haciendo el monguer serías el primero en cagarte en la puta madre de todos los santos.\n[#67](c67#c-67) si que molestan, están usando una gran porción de la vía para un evento privado. Además de ser ruidoso y molesto, hay quien no le puede agradar que una visita a una cuidad se convierta en un musical.\n[#133](c133#c-133) ¿Ruidoso el que? si llevan auriculares el sonido normal de gente caminando y como llevan auriculares ni siquiera hablan. Ruidoso son los coches y motos, y la gente dando voces en las terrazas.\n[#78](c78#c-78) Pues un poco Sí, porque los demás también aguantarán TUS ESTUPIDECES en algún momento.\nSi vas a cenar a una terraza - Molestas a los vecinos que se levantan a las 5AM\nSi tus hijos juegan con un balón en el parque - Molestan a los ancianitos que le dan de comer a las palomas...\nY así todo.\nSi no sois capaces de aguantar nada iros a vivir al campo o como ermitaños.\n[#116](c116#c-116) el parque es un sitio de juegos.\nSi quieren hacer zoomba que vayan al parque o un gimnasio.\nLo de la terraza lo veo igual de mal.\nPuedes estar en una terraza sin tener que estar a gritos, también.\n[#116](c116#c-116) > porque los demás también aguantarán TUS ESTUPIDECES\nNo. Por lo general, al estar dotado de dignidad, evito hacer estupideces en público.\n> Si vas a cenar a una terraza - Molestas a los vecinos que se levantan a las 5AM\nSi ceno en un restaurante evito las terrazas. Paso de aguantar el humo ajeno, ruido de tráfico, cucarachas y contenedores de la basura a dos pasos.\n> Si tus hijos juegan con un balón en el parque - Molestan a los ancianitos que le dan de comer a las palomas...\n¿Me estás comparando estos \"adultos\" con niños de unos pocos años? Te lo compro. No dan para más.\n> Si no sois capaces de aguantar nada iros a vivir al campo o como ermitaños.\nQue se vaya a vivir al campo el que molesta, no el que intenta vivir tranquilo.\n[#69](c69#c-69) Primero los ciclistas, luego los patinetes, ahora los turistas con cascos el gran problema de seguridad vial.\n[#64](c64#c-64) hasta que quieres salir del portal y te encuentras a 15 monguers caminando a ritmo de Thriller (tres pasitos, manos. Tres pasitos, manos)...\n[#1](c1#c-1) También te digo una cosa, entre estos y las despedidas de soltero/a con escándalos impresionantes a cualquier hora me quedo con lo primero.\nLo que si me parece de cárcel es el \"uniforme\" que le han puesto a los guías, un cruce entre un limón y el chavo del ocho\nEsta crítica refleja el sentimiento de una parte de la población que se siente marginada en su propia ciudad, desplazada por actividades que, aunque novedosas y atractivas para los visitantes, alteran la vida cotidiana de los residentes.\nLa controversia en torno a Bailaloloco Silent Disco Tour es solo un ejemplo más del complejo equilibrio que Valencia intenta mantener entre el desarrollo turístico y la preservación de su identidad y calidad de vida para sus habitantes.\nSuena a ChatGPT.\n[#1](c1#c-1) No estoy en contra, quizás deben limitar el número de asistentes para que no molesten tanto. Se ve que el grupo es bastante grande.\n[#20](c20#c-20) Ingresos para quién y cómo? Cada actividad humana tiene diferentes externalidades negativas, en el caso del turismo las estamos viendo ahora y estamos decidiendo si las queremos o no.\n¿\"Los valencianos explotan\"?, ¿cuántos valencianos?, porque en la no-noticia recopila 3 opiniones de internet, y ya está.\n[#141](c141#c-141) Creo que incluso puede ser un publireportaje, que en estos tiempos de SEO agresivo nunca se sabe, y aparece el nombre de la empresa y el precio del servicio\n[#20](c20#c-20) Amen por esa ultima frase.\nA mi el turismo solo me quita capacidad de consumo.\nQue si, que los hosteleros pagan impuestos. Pero en Valencia ya no puedo tomarme una birra por 1,5€, y alwuilar una casa ni te cuento.\nSe ha vendido el país (su arquitectura, paisajes, hasta las casas mismas...) y los beneficios han ido a cuatro empresarios hoteleros. Muerte a este modelo!!!\n[#80](c80#c-80) era muy bueno ese programa, yo recuerdo al hombre que siempre seguía la línea blanca, simplemente genial\n[#41](c41#c-41) Te compro lo de los alquileres pero creo que eso es un problema de regulación, se están utilizando unas infraestructuras (viviendas familiares) para una actividad que no le corresponde. Y no es solo provocado por grandes corporaciones que hay muchísimos particulares que también la practican y se benefician bastante. Vivo de alquiler y me veo afectado directamente por esto.\nEn cuanto a los sueldos míseros pues también, pero nos es un problema del turismo ¿Crees que hay oferta en otros sectores con mejores sueldos? ¿Crees que se podría prohibir esta actividad en alguna ciudad y mandar a la gente del sector a trabajar en el campo, repartos, construcción o cualquier otro sector?\nEl ser humano cuando se convierte en turista está demostrado que se vuelve (o nos volvemos, no quiero ser más que nadie) gilipollas, bailar por la calle como un poseso, ir por el centro de la calle para hacerte fotos(salir de casa te pone la armadura de Ironman, si te atropella un 🚕 no duele), beber sin control....\n[#123](c123#c-123) para empezar usan la vía pública para dar un servicio que bloquea e invade con ruido y espacio.\nNo es muy diferente que un a terraza delante de un bar. Solo que estas mierdas son móviles.\nLuego, y esto ya es más subjetivo, está en disonancia con una visita turística.\nUna cosa es una visita turística y otra hacer deporte y baile. Las dos ala vez es un sinsentido. Que te gusta ver a gente haciendo el canelo? Perfecto. A mí me disgusta y me fuerza a no estar cerca, porque me produce rechazo y vergüenza. Además de ser una afrenta al patrimonio de una ciudad, hacer una visita haciendo el tolai.",

    "text": "The dazzling Thai holiday islands made famous by Hollywood film \"The Beach\" are facing a severe water shortage following a blistering heatwave across Asia, a tourism official and locals said Thursday.The Koh Phi Phi archipelago, off the west coast of southern Thailand, draws hundreds of thousands of visitors to its pristine beaches and turquoise waters each year.But a deadly heatwave that has sent temperature records tumbling across the region in recent weeks -- as well as a prolonged spell of low rainfall -- has seen reservoirs run low.\"The private company that provides water to the islands may have to stop the supply,\" Wichupan Phukaoluan Srisanya, president of the Krabi Hotel Association, which represents hotels in the area, told AFP.Island authorities have discussed shipping in water from the mainland if the dry weather continues, she said, but would hold off in the hope of the wet season arriving in May.\"But we want to assure tourists who are planning to visit the islands that we can manage this,\" Wichupan added.Residents who asked not to be named told AFP they had suffered fresh water shortages for months, and said some hotels had limited bookings as a result.And online posts by returning tourists warned travellers to \"check if their accommodation has fresh water\" ahead of their stay.One wrote on review site TripAdvisor that \"tap water has stopped running\", as island water reservoirs had been dry since the end of April.Scientists have long warned human-induced climate change will produce more frequent, longer and more intense heatwaves.While the El Nino phenomenon is helping drive this year's exceptionally warm weather, Asia is also warming faster than the global average, according to the UN's World Meteorological Organisation.Local tourism operators have repeatedly called for long-term water supply investments for the Koh Phi Phi islands, which lack sufficient reservoirs and infrastructure.In the Gulf of Thailand, Koh Samui -- another hugely popular tourist island -- has been experiencing similar dry, hot weather but the local tourism board said visitors had not been impacted.\"We have enough from a water truck, but it increases the cost of running hotels by three times more,\" the president of Koh Samui Tourism Association Ratchaparon Poolsawadee told AFP.The extreme recent heat has blasted Asia, triggering heatstroke deaths, school closures and desperate prayers for cooling rain.For around a week in April, Bangkok authorities gave daily extreme heat warnings as the heat index -- which takes into account other factors including humidity -- topped 52 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit).",

    "text": "Descubren cómo el aire contaminado puede causar cáncer de pulmón\nLos tumores de los no fumadores que viven en entornos contaminados tienen más mutaciones\nRafa López\nSegún un estudio publicado ayer en Nature, la contaminación atmosférica podría estar directamente implicada en los casos de cáncer de pulmón en personas que nunca han fumado, que son el 25% de los diagnósticos.\nLa investigación, cuyo primer firmante es el gallego Marcos Díaz Gay, del Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncológicas (CNIO), analizó el genoma de tumores pulmonares de 871 personas no fumadoras de cuatro continentes. Los no fumadores que vivían en entornos más contaminados presentaron un número mucho mayor de mutaciones relacionadas con el tabaquismo (3,9 veces más) y el envejecimiento (un 76% más). Esto no significa que la contaminación provoque una «firma mutacional de contaminación atmosférica» única per se, sino que aumenta el número total de mutaciones, explica Díaz-Gay, antiguo investigador en la Universidad de California de Ludmil Alexandrov, codirector de este estudio.\n«El artículo aporta más evidencia sobre el posible mecanismo carcinogénico de la contaminación ambiental en el cáncer de pulmón», dice a SMC Alberto Ruano, catedrático de Medicina Preventiva de la USC, que echa en falta en este estudio una mención al «segundo factor de riesgo del cáncer de pulmón según la OMS, como es la exposición a radón».\nRRSS WhatsApp\nRRSS Facebook\nRRSS Twitter\nRRSS email\nCopiar URL)\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil",

    "text": "Freddo e Crudo Inverno, La Svolta Gelida in Arrivo\nArticolo Precedente\nArticolo Successivo\nL'inizio del 2025 è stato caratterizzato da un clima mite, grazie alla persistente protezione fornita dall'anticiclone delle Azzorre, che ha garantito condizioni di tempo stabile quasi ovunque. Tuttavia, gli ultimi aggiornamenti dei Centri di Calcolo hanno sostanzialmente confermato la data per una svolta gelida che potrebbe riportare il crudo inverno su gran parte del nostro Paese. Con l'attenuazione dell'anticiclone, si prevede un cambiamento significativo nella circolazione atmosferica, con l'arrivo di correnti umide e miti da sudovest che porteranno neve sulle Alpi, ma solo a quote montane, e piogge e rovesci a tratti in veloci passaggi perturbati.\nSta transitando in queste ore un fronte freddo con traiettoria nordovest-sudest, di moderata intensità e piuttosto veloce, che già al nordovest ha lasciato spazio a schiarite. Tuttavia, il resto del Paese è invitato a seguire l'evoluzione del fronte tramite radar, poiché l'Epifania sarà segnata da maltempo, con piogge, neve e forti venti. Fino al 6 gennaio, l'Italia sarà attraversata da venti, piogge e neve, in attesa poi di una possibile ondata di gelo artico in quota.\nLa prima perturbazione dell'anno, proveniente dal Nord Atlantico, sta già influenzando il meteo su alcune aree del nostro Paese, interrompendo la fase di stabilità garantita dall'anticiclone delle Azzorre. Per l'Epifania si prevedono nubi, neve, Maestrale e freddo proveniente dalle regioni polari. Le previsioni per i prossimi giorni indicano un peggioramento delle condizioni meteorologiche, con piogge sull'Emilia Romagna, poi al Centro e quindi in Campania.\nIl clima mite dovuto all'anticiclone delle Azzorre è ormai un ricordo dell'anno passato. Con il nuovo anno arriva anche il maltempo: pioggia, neve e freddo.",

    "text": "„Würden sonst Deutsch sprechen“: Trump gibt bizarre Erklärung für Militärparade\nEine gigantische Militärparade rollt an Trumps Geburtstag durch Washington DC. Die Feier will sich der Präsident auf keinen Fall vermiesen lassen.\nWashington, D.C. – Während Demonstranten an der Westküste gegen die Abschiebepolitik von\nDonald Trump protestieren, laufen an der Ostküste längst die Vorbereitungen für die Militärparade. Am Samstag (14. Juni 2025) sollen Panzer und Kriegsgerät begleitet von hunderttausenden Soldaten durch Washington DC rollen, um sowohl den 250. Geburtstag der US-Armee als auch den 79. Geburtstag des amtierenden US-Präsidenten zu feiern.\nDoch die Eskalation in Los Angeles macht Donald Trump mit Blick auf die geplanten Feierlichkeiten am Wochenende offenbar nervös. „Haben Sie eine Botschaft an die Kritiker der Feierlichkeiten?“, fragte ein Journalist den US-Präsidenten bei einem Presse-Meeting im Weißen Haus. „Wenn irgendjemand zum Demonstrieren auftaucht, dann werden wir ihm mit sehr großer Gewalt begegnen“, sagte Trump und wiederholte die Drohung sogar noch einmal. „Jeder, der demonstrieren will, wird mit sehr großer Gewalt empfangen“. Ihm seien aber keine geplanten Proteste gegen seine Militärparade bekannt.\nDonald Trump schwärmt von „Panzern“ bei der Militärparade\nDer Plan der US-Regierung für Samstag sieht eine gigantische Show der eigenen Stärke in Washington, DC vor. „Wir haben Panzer, Flugzeuge, wir haben alles mögliche“, schwärmte Donald Trump bereits im Vorfeld über die geplante Militärparade. Nach aktuellen Informationen sollen an dieser mehr als 200.000 Soldatinnen und Soldaten teilnehmen. Daneben werden Panzer, Flugzeuge und Militärgerät aller Art aus verschiedenen Epochen in Washington zu sehen sein.\nDonald Trumps Militärparade: Infos zur Geburtstagsfeier in der Übersicht\n|Datum||14. Juni 2025|\n|Beginn||18.30 Uhr Ortszeit (0.30 Uhr in Deutschland)|\n|Thema||Die Kriege der USA|\n|Umfang||mehr als 100 Militärfahrzeuge und bis zu 200.000 Soldaten|\nDie US-Armee will mit der Militärparade in Washington DC an alle Konflikte erinnern, die das Land seit seiner Gründung erlebte: vom Revolutionskrieg über die Weltkriege bis zum Vietnam-Krieg. Jeder Krieg wird von 60 Soldaten in historischen Kostümen repräsentiert, gefolgt von 400 Soldaten der gleichen Einheit in ihren modernen Kampfanzügen. Außerdem werden hunderte Militärfahrzeuge in Washington DC erwartet. Die Parade dürfte damit anhand der Bilder, die durch die Welt gehen werden, stark an Russlands jährliche Militärparaden erinnern.\nPanzer und Hubschrauber bei der Militärparade in Washington DC\n- M1A2/Abrams-Panzer\n- Bradley-Kampffahrzeuge\n- Black Hawk-Hubschrauber\n- Apache-Hubschrauber\n- Chinook-Hubschrauber\nDer Prunk zum Doppelgeburtstag kostet die\nUS-Politik offenbar eine Stange Geld. Bis zu 45 Millionen US-Dollar sollen laut US-Medien die geplanten Ausgaben für die Militärparade und die Sicherheitsvorkehrungen in Washington DC betragen. Donald Trump aber hat dafür eine Begründung parat. „Zur Abwechslung werden wir unser Land mal feiern“, sagte Trump. Die USA seien das einzige Land, das seinen Sieg im Zweiten Weltkrieg nicht feiern würde. „Ich habe andere Länder angerufen. Alle feiern es. Dabei sind wir diejenigen, die den Krieg gewonnen haben. Ohne uns würden Sie alle sonst heute Deutsch sprechen. Vielleicht würden Sie auch Japanisch sprechen.“\nDonald Trump bekommt die lang ersehnte Militärparade zum Geburtstag\nDie Militärparade in Washington DC an Donald Trumps Geburtstag ist der Höhepunkt der Feier zu Ehren des US-Militärs, die bereits seit Montag (7. Juni) laufen. Der amtierende US-Präsident hatte bereits nach seinem Sieg bei der\nUS-Wahl 2016 eine Militärparade in der Hauptstadt verlangt. Die Behörden des „District of Colombia“ hatten das aber verhindert, weil Kosten und logistischer Aufwand als zu hoch eingeschätzt wurden. Nun aber bekommt Donald Trump seine Militärparade. Das verdankt der US-Präsident wohl der Tatsache, dass seine zweite Amtszeit den 250. Geburtstag der US-Armee umschließt.\nDoch die anhaltenden\nProteste gegen Trumps Abschiebepolitik in Los Angeles dürften dessen Vorfreude auf die Militärparade trüben. Laut einem Bericht der New York Times mache man sich auch innerhalb der Republikaner große Sorgen, die Bilder von Panzern und Soldaten in der US-Hauptstadt könnten im Angesicht der Unruhen in Kalifornien ein falsches Bild erzeugen. Es könne der Eindruck entstehen, die US-Armee würde den Sieg über die eigene Bevölkerung feiern. „Das unglückliche Zusammentreffen der Parade und des Einsatzes der Nationalgarde in Kalifornien wird sich verhängnisvoll anfühlen“, sagte Kori Schake, ehemaliger Verteidigungsbeamter in der Regierung von George W. Bush, gegenüber der US-Zeitung.\nMilitärparade in Washington DC: Trump hält Rede zu Ehren der US-Armee\nDas wiederum dürfte Donald Trump aber nicht abschrecken. Der amtierende US-Präsident ist ein Meister der Selbstinszenierung und wird die Militärparade am 14. Juni vor allem dafür nutzen, um sich und seinen Geburtstag zu feiern. Auch eine Rede Trumps ist geplant. Laut der Website der Veranstaltung will das Staatsoberhaupt „250 Jahre außergewöhnliche Dienste, bedeutende Errungenschaften und ein bleibendes Vermächtnis der US-Armee“ ehren.\nOffiziell sind die Feierlichkeiten und der Soldatenaufmarsch in Washington DC aber nicht für Donald Trumps Geburtstag gedacht. Geehrt wird am „nationalen Flaggentag“ dagegen nur das Militär. Vor 250 Jahren, am 14. Juni 1775, hob der Kontinentalkongress im laufenden Unabhängigkeitskrieg zehn Kompanien aus. Der spätere US-Präsident George Washington wurde zum Oberbefehlshaber der so gebildeten Kontinentalarmee ernannt.\nDamit ist die US-Armee sogar älter als die USA selbst. Die wurde nämlich erst am 4. Juli 1776 mit Unterzeichnung der Unabhängigkeitserklärung ins Leben gerufen. Noch jünger ist Donald Trump. Der feiert am 14. Juni 2025 erst seinen 79. Geburtstag und ist damit nach\nJoe Biden der zweitälteste amtierende Präsident in der 250 Jahre dauernden Geschichte der USA. Sollte er seine Amtszeit beenden, würde Trump seinen Vorgänger noch überholen, und mit dann 82 Jahren und sieben Monaten zum ältesten US-Staatsoberhaupt der Geschichte werden. (dil)",
