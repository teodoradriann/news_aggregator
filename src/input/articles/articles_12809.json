    "title": "What Are the Benefits of Investing in New Construction Homes in Orlando?",
    "text": "Buying a home is a significant decision, and choosing a new property offers unique advantages. Investing in new construction, Orlando provides many benefits for homebuyers, from modern amenities to lower maintenance costs. This article explores why opting for a newly built home in Orlando can be smart for first-time buyers and seasoned investors.\nModern Designs and Features One major benefit of new construction homes is the availability of modern designs and features. New homes are built with the latest architectural styles, often including open floor plans, large windows, and smart home technologies. These contemporary features make the living spaces more functional and attractive. Buyers can also enjoy modern kitchens with energy-efficient appliances, spacious master suites, and updated bathrooms. Having these features in place means there is no need for immediate renovations or upgrades, which can save time and money.\nCustomization Opportunities Investing in new construction allows buyers to customize their homes according to their preferences. Many builders offer various options for floor plans, interior finishes, and exterior designs. This flexibility means buyers can choose the colors, materials, and fixtures that best suit their style and needs. Customization can include choosing the type of flooring, cabinetry, countertops, and paint colors. Having the chance to personalize a new home is a significant advantage over purchasing an older home, where changes can be costly and time-consuming.\nEnergy Efficiency and Sustainability New construction homes are designed with energy efficiency in mind. Builders use the latest materials and construction techniques to ensure homes are well-insulated and energy-efficient. Features like double-pane windows, energy-efficient HVAC systems, and LED lighting help reduce energy consumption, leading to lower utility bills. Some new homes also come with solar panels or smart thermostats, further enhancing their sustainability. Investing in a new, energy-efficient home benefits the environment and helps homeowners save money in the long run.\nLower Maintenance Costs A significant advantage of new construction homes is lower maintenance costs than older properties. New homes are built with high-quality materials and meet current building codes, making them less likely to have immediate repair issues. New homes often have warranties covering major systems like plumbing, electrical, and roofing for several years. This provides peace of mind to homeowners, knowing they won’t have to deal with unexpected repair costs shortly after moving in.\nGrowing Communities and Amenities Orlando is known for its vibrant neighborhoods and growing communities. Investing in new construction in Orlando often means becoming part of a newly developed community with modern amenities. Many new communities offer parks, swimming pools, fitness centers, and walking trails. These features provide residents with a higher quality of life and make new neighborhoods appealing to families, professionals, and retirees alike. Additionally, being in a new community can foster a sense of camaraderie and belonging among neighbors.\nInvesting in new construction in Orlando has many advantages, including modern designs, customization options, energy efficiency, lower maintenance costs, and access to growing communities with excellent amenities. These benefits make new homes attractive for those looking to buy in Orlando. By choosing a newly built property, homebuyers can enjoy a comfortable, efficient, and personalized living space that meets their needs and enhances their lifestyle.",

    "text": "New York, Dec 28 (IANS) Gas prices across the US are projected to fall in the new year in 2024 for the second successive year resulting in a net saving of about $32 billion on fuel costs for the Americans.Oil experts predict that US gas prices will average $3.38 a gallon in the key election year of 2024 representing a significant improvement from this year's average of $3.51 a gallon and an even bigger drop from the average of 2022 of $3.95.\nGas prices skyrocketed to record highs that year as Russia's invasion of Ukraine set off global shockwaves, media reports said.\nGas stations around the country boosted prices by an average of 26 cents a gallon over the past month, as irregular temperatures made fuel-making more challenging due to the slowing of cooling processes needed to refine crude oil .\nEven as the Russia-Ukraine war still lingers and there is a risk the Israel-Hamas war spills into a regional conflict, GasBuddy, an oil and gas analyst, is betting drivers will get more relief in 2024.\nGasBuddy expects Americans will spend about $32 billion less on fuel than in 2023 and $79 billion less than in 2022.\n\"Next year should represent a continued march towards what most Americans would consider normal prices at the pump,\" Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy's head of petroleum analysis, told CNN.\nThe price drop forecast bodes well for consumers. White House can exercise caution as optimism emerges while fighting an uphill battle trying to sell its economic message to a sceptical public, CNN analysts wrote.\nCheaper gas prices would give the Federal Reserve a carte blanche as it seeks to pull off a rare soft landing of the US economy by taming inflation without starting a recession. The Feds closely monitor gas prices but it's not included in its \"core\" inflation gauge.\n\"Gas prices may still be a bit elevated but considering wage growth, it is taking less of Americans' hard work to pay for that gallon of gasoline,\" De Haan said.\nGasBuddy doesn't see gas prices averaging $4 a gallon in any single month next year.\nThe US is an energy power house that pumps more oil than any other country in the world , according to S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI ) Insights.\nIn December 2022, GasBuddy projected gas prices would average $3.49 a gallon in 2023. That forecast was nearly spot-on, with actual gas prices averaging $3.51 a gallon so far this year.\n--IANS\nash/pgh\nAdd Chart to Comment",

    "text": "Local seafood restaurant becomes hot spot after viral video WILMINGTON, N.C. (WECT) - A seafood restaurant in Wilmington is getting some out-of-town visitors to this popular hot spot. But these aren’t typical tourists, they’re social media surfers stopping by the check out the menu. “It’s insane,” said Darren Keeler with Shuckin’ Shack. “At last check, the video had almost three million views in a matter of days.” The video Keeler is talking about is Adam Moran’s food channel called “Beard Meets Food”. He’s a competitive eater from across the pond who came to Wilmington to try the hidden secret lobster roll on Shuckin’ Shack’s menu. “If you know, you know,” said Keeler. “It’s the “Mega Gregga.” The meal is a lobster roll feast with fries and slaw that weighs in at a whopping eight pounds! “The owner just told me it’s gonna weigh 8 pounds; this is gonna be tough,” said Moran in his viral video. “Hopefully I can do it; I don’t know.” Well, he did do it, as the video documents. Moran finished the platter in a little more than 40 minutes, and that meal has become a viral sensation. Shuckin’ Shack, downtown, goes through anywhere from two to four thousand oysters a week. It’s ironic it’s getting this international attention for a lobster roll that’s not printed on the menu. It’s word of mouth. “Oh, making it was fun,” said chef Zach Watford. But it’s not just about food. It’s about friends and fellowship. “Shuckin’ Shack. I like to tell people who work here and our customers that the shack part is important,” said Watford. “We’re not fancy, we’re not pretentious; we take pride in what we do.” Up for the challenge? Give a Shuckin’ Shack 24 hours’ notice. If you finish the meal, you get a free dinner, a t-shirt, and bragging rights. If you don’t finish the meal, well, you’re out $200 and your face gets plastered on the restaurant’s “Wall of Shame.” “Beard Meats Food” has brought the restaurant some global notoriety. The management team must have done something right. This restaurant, which had its original location in Carolina Beach, has grown to a franchise of 18, with five more in development to open within the next year. Basking in the glow of Adam Moran’s fame, and the over 3 million followers are just icing on the cake. “As a businessman, the moral is simple,” said Keeler. “Respond to everyone who reaches out on Facebook or Messenger to your business, because you don’t know who that’s gonna be.” To learn more about Adam Moran’s fame as he eats his way across the globe in “Beard Meats Food” [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=aNxWIZ8Ou7OTaELz&v=M0CX9rjiVCY&feature=youtu.be).

В ответ Трамп начал пространные рассуждения о своей работе в Овальном кабинете, Флориде и том, что планирует задержаться в штате как можно дольше.\n\"Затем он продолжил разглагольствовать о налогах в Нью-Йорке, прежде чем завершить свой ответ, заявив: \"Но большое спасибо, я буду здесь столько, сколько смогу\", – говорится в публикации.\nЧасть общественности восприняла ответ Трампа так, будто он отнес себя к содержащимся в открытом им центре мигрантам, что вызвало бурную реакцию в соцсетях и опасения о его психическом здоровье, подытожило издание.\nРанее The Washington Post рассказала, что Трамп попросил медиков оставить ему снимок компьютерной томографии головного мозга, сделанный после покушения на него в Пенсильвании в 2024 году.",

    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nWhen Tyler Hubbard recorded one of the tracks on his newly-released sophomore solo album, a memory resurfaced of a moment he had a run-in with police.\nHubbard reminisced on that moment when he appeared on The Kelly Clarkson Show on Thursday morning (April 18). The country hitmaker told host Kelly Clarkson , “halfway through the song, as we were writing it…I was starting to have a flashback. I’m like, ‘I remember when I was 15, I got caught parking in a parking lot with my girlfriend, who was 16 and had her own car.”\nClarkson pointed out that that Hubbard’s story took place in a church parking lot, garnering a surprised laugh from the audience. Hubbard replied that the church parking lot “is supposed to be the safest spot to be. …No judgement. We were leaving enough room in the middle for Jesus,” he insisted as Clarkson laughed and replied, “no, you were not!”\n“It’s this big, dramatic thing,” Hubbard remembered. “(The) cop pulls up, I’m thinking he’s gonna be cool. He’ll just tell us to go home. No. He wanted to make an example out of us. So, he gets us all flustered and then he’s like, ‘I’m gonna drive you home. We’re gonna talk to your dad, your parents.’ I’m like, ‘bro.’ Isn’t there like a bro code here or something like this? …So, he took me home, made me go tell my dad the whole scenario. Although I was grounded for like a month from seeing my girlfriend or riding in her car, which is really unfortunate at 15 years old. …My dad was like, ‘son, why didn’t you just come park in the driveway?’ I’m like — next time, dad. Yeah. Next time.”\nHubbard’s sophomore solo album, Strong , made its debut on April 12. In addition to “Park,” the 13-track album includes “Wish You Would,” “A Lot With A Little,” “Back Then Right Now,” “Vegas,” the title track and other highlights. Hubbard is listed as a songwriter on every track, including a solo credit on “'73 Beetle.” Find the full album on iHeartRadio here , and listen to “ Park ” below.",
