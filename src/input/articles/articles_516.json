    "title": "'Relentless' effort needed to get Maine ready for extreme weather, commission says",
    "text": "A group paddles a canoe around a flooded Custom House Wharf at high tide in Portland on Jan. 13, 2024. Ben McCanna/Portland Press Herald\nThe Maine commission created in the wake of damaging storms has released its final report on how to prepare the state for extreme weather events.\nThe 24-member Infrastructure Rebuilding and Resilience Commission was established by Gov. Janet Mills in May 2024 after several extreme storms rocked the state in late 2023, wiping out infrastructure and flooding roadways . The commission aimed to create a long-term resiliency plan for the state as extreme storms become more common due to climate change.\n“Without relentless focus and attention, Maine risks losing the meaningful momentum it’s gained since the devastating storms of December 2023 and January 2024, which prompted the creation of our Commission,” the report said.\nThe commission’s plan has three core pillars: strengthening infrastructure and reducing disaster risk, improving disaster preparedness and response, and sustaining the state’s resilience momentum. Some of the group’s recommendations are already under way, including the establishment of the State Resilience Office, which will fund programs to strengthen homes, improve flood readiness, and support emergency response and communication systems around the state.\nView this document on Scribd The plan calls for that office to track and report the progress as the state works toward improved disaster resilience.\nThe report by the commission highlighted the increased risk for natural disasters in Maine. Between March 2022 and May 2024, the report said, Maine experienced nine natural disasters.\n“The rising severity and frequency of these storms and floods raise urgent alarms about the increasing risks of extreme weather in our state and drive home the imperative that Maine plan for and invest in infrastructure resilience at the state, regional and local levels,” the report said.\nLast week, the Mills administration announced $8 million in grant funding through the state’s Community Resilience Partnership to help communities protect people, businesses, and infrastructure from flooding, storm surge and other climate effects. The report emphasized the importance of harnessing the resources available to make Maine safer in the wake of storms.\n“In Maine, we no longer know the storms of yesterday. Storms are now more frequent and dangerous, flooding our homes and businesses, washing out our roads and bridges, and threatening the health of our people and economy,” Mills said in a prepared statement. “The changes to our weather and our climate are harming people, communities, and businesses across our state.\nRelated Read our complete coverage of the December 2023 storm “We must prevent as much damage as possible and be ready to quickly recover when storms take their toll. … This plan will guide efforts in the year to come to protect this great state we all call home.”\nA statement from Mills’ office said the increasing uncertainty about federal disaster funding highlights the importance of the state’s efforts to address climate change.\n“As the commission completed its work, the federal government proposed eliminating (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) and sunsetting critical funding programs such as the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program,” the statement said. “These developments underscore the importance of state-level leadership and investment in resilience.”",

    "title": "Declassified CIA Document Features Terrifying Claims About Mars | OutKick",
    "text": "A declassified document about Mars might send a chill down your spine. UFOs and aliens are a popular subject here at OutKick. People can't get enough of the unexplainable, and I don't blame them. The amount of video footage we have of objects in the sky that have no explanation is definitely concerning. Well, I suggest you buckle up because there's more troubling content to ponder. Declassified CIA document about Mars is terrifying. A declassified CIA document shows an interview conducted with someone in 1984 who allegedly used astral projection in the past, according to Unilad. Astral projection is described as, \\\"an intentional OBE that usually involves the experience that the self can seem to travel far from their body — even to other countries or planets.\\\" Buckle up because the CIA apparently using out-of-body experiences to explore what Mars was like over a million years ago isn't even the craziest part. It's what the document shows that is bone-chilling. The subject being interviewed by the CIA claims to have seen a \\\"dying\\\" race of creatures described as incredibly tall, \\\"thin\\\" and \\\"ancient.\\\" \\\"They're dying, it's past their time or age,\\\" the subject told the CIA member conducting the interview. You can read the specific page from the report below. There are so many things about this situation that I don't even know where to begin. First, why was the CIA using astral projection to explore Mars in the past? Am I crazy or is that an egregious waste of time and resources? It's either that or the CIA knows something the rest of us don't. If that's the case, then it's time for a very terrifying conversation about the reality we're living in. Furthermore, the subject being interviewed *ALLEGEDLY* witnessed a dying race of \\\"ancient\\\" people in structures on Mars. If that's not absolutely terrifying, then I don't know what is. The page from the document shown above could be out of a horror movie. Scary tall and skinny individuals trying to survive on Mars as they face extinction? Yeah, that's the definition of nightmare fuel, my friends. Of course, there's also the very real possibility (and the most likely) that this interview from 1984 is complete BS and the guy was making it up as we went. Let's hope that's the case, because I want to live in a universe where humans are the only ones running the show. I don't need to lose sleep over Mars potentially having an ancient race of aliens. Let me know at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.",

La denuncia è stata fatta durante una riunione in videoconferenza convocata per fare il punto sulla situazione nelle regioni di Kursk, Bryansk e Belgorod, che dal 6 agosto sono sotto attacco delle forze di Kiev. La regione di Kursk è da oltre due settimane oggetto di una grande offensiva da parte delle forze ucraine. Il capo dell'intelligence di Kiev, Kyrylo Budanov, ha confermato la \"firma ucraina\" dietro l'attacco su larga scala con droni di due giorni fa, che ha raggiunto anche Mosca. Secondo Budanov, sono stati colpiti basi militari e centri per l'intercettazione di dati. Il direttore generale dell'Agenzia Internazionale per l'Energia Atomica (AIEA) ha annunciato che visiterà la centrale nucleare di Kursk la settimana prossima. La visita è attesa con grande interesse, dato il contesto di intensificazione dei combattimenti nella regione. Nel frattempo, il presidente ucraino Volodymyr Zelensky si è recato nella regione di Sumy, al confine con la Russia, per incontrare il comandante in capo delle forze armate, Oleksandr Syrsky. Zelensky ha sottolineato l'importanza dell'operazione in corso a Kursk, definendola un modo sistemico di difendere l'Ucraina e porre fine alla guerra alle condizioni di un'Ucraina indipendente. Le accuse di Putin e la risposta di Zelensky evidenziano la complessità e la gravità della situazione attuale. La visita dell'AIEA potrebbe fornire ulteriori chiarimenti sulla sicurezza della centrale nucleare di Kursk e sulle reali intenzioni delle forze ucraine.",
