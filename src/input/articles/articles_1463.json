    "text": "Costco Just Launched an Exciting New Bakery Item: 'Tastes Homemade' We're only a few days into the new year, but Costco is already tempting members to stray from [their 2024 diets](https://www.eatthis.com/healthy-costco-foods/) with an exciting new bakery item hitting shelves right now. Over the past couple of days, several shoppers have spotted a new Banana Nut Loaf in the retailer's bakery section. While Costco has sold [a similar Banana Pecan Loaf ](https://www.costcuisine.com/post/costco-kirkland-signature-banana-pecan-loaf-review)in the past, the new Banana Nut Loaf is topped with walnuts instead of pecans and weighs in at a whopping two pounds. Laura Lamb, who runs the Costco fan account [@costcohotfinds](https://www.instagram.com/costcohotfinds/) on Instagram, raved about the new bakery find in a [post](https://www.instagram.com/costcohotfinds/reel/C1slt9TOv6C/) this week. RELATED: [25 Best Frozen Foods at Costco Right Now](https://www.eatthis.com/best-costco-frozen-foods-winter-2024/) \"It's soft, not overly sweet, and tastes homemade,\" she said. Several other Costco shoppers who commented on her post were just as enamored with the new bakery option. \"I bought it last weekend and it was gone in my house within a day. It was so good! Apparently my boys thought so too lol,\" one fan wrote. \"Best banana bread ever!!!\" another said. RELATED: [25 Best New Grocery Store Foods Of 2023](https://www.eatthis.com/best-new-grocery-store-foods-2023/) Some shoppers also suggested upgrading the banana bread by warming it up and adding a schmear of cream cheese, butter, or whatever else goes well with bananas. \"It tasted amazing toasted with peanut butter!\" a shopper commented. However, not every member who's gotten their hands on a loaf has been a fan. Some customers have reported back on Reddit that the bakery item is [\"dry\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/18yuqni/comment/kgfvfu7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) or [\"just okay.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/18yuqni/comment/kgdyn4s/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) So if the new loaf has piqued your interest, you might need to sample it yourself to determine whether it's truly worth your hard-earned dollars. RELATED: [13 Costco Items You Should Always Stock Up On, Customers Say](https://www.eatthis.com/costco-items-to-stock-up-on-customers-say/) The Banana Nut Loaf has been selling for $6.99 at warehouses where it's been spotted, but prices may vary depending on the location. Some Costco locations also tend to receive new items earlier than others, so make sure to check directly with your local warehouse to confirm whether the Banana Nut Loaf is in stock yet. This isn't the only exciting new bakery item to hit Costco's shelves in recent weeks. In late December, the retailer [debuted new Almond Florentine Cookies](https://www.eatthis.com/costco-almond-florentine-cookies/) that are drizzled with dark chocolate. The bakery treats quickly started garnering major buzz among Costco shoppers. \"These are insane. They're thin, crispy, nutty, and hard to stop eating. They're super delicate and just delicious,\" Lamb said in an earlier Instagram [post](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1Iuxx5uNnb/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=bd2ab94f-2007-4cfe-82c3-757d1a18809f).

    "title": "Details emerge in Texas head-on crash that killed 6 members of same family - ABC News",
    "text": "A 17-year-old driver of a pickup truck collided with the family's van. Six members of the same family, including two children, were killed in Texas when a 17-year-old pickup truck driver slammed head-on into their minivan while allegedly in the wrong lane of the two-lane highway, authorities said. Relatives of the deceased said they were returning from a post-Christmas outing to a wildlife safari park when the fatal accident occurred on U.S. 67, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth. The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) released details of the two-vehicle collision on Wednesday, saying its preliminary investigation revealed that the teenage driver of a Silverado pickup was heading south when the truck swerved into the northbound lane and slammed into the family's minivan. The DPS said the area where the crash occurred is in a \"no passing\" zone. Killed in the Tuesday evening crash, according to a statement from the Texas Department of Public Safety, were 28-year-old Rushil Barri; 9-year-old Nishidha Potabathula; 10-year-old Krithik Potabathula; 36-year-old Naveena Potabathula; 60-year-old Sitamahalakshmi Ponnada; and 64-year-old Nageswararao Ponnada. The DPS said that only two of the six family members killed were wearing seatbelts at the time of the collision. One person in the family's minivan, 43-year-old Lokesh Potabathula, who was not wearing a seatbelt, survived the crash and was taken to a hospital in critical condition, according to the DPS. The driver of the pickup truck that collided with the family and his 17-year-old passenger were also taken to a hospital in critical condition, the DPS said. The crash investigation is ongoing and it remained unclear on Thursday if any charges will be filed. Rushil Barri's brother, Rakesh Barri, told ABC affiliate station WFAA that his relatives had spent the day at the Fossil Rim Wildlife Safari Park in Glenn Rose, Texas, and were returning to Rakesh Barri's home in Irving, Texas when the crash occurred. Rakesh Barri said his cousin, Lokesh Potabathula, of Georgia, was visiting his brother along with his wife, his 9-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter, who were killed in the crash. He said Sitamahalakshmi and Nageswararao Ponnada were Lokesh Potabathula's in-laws who were visiting from India. \"It's so hard to take,\" Rakesh Barri told WFAA, describing his brother as \"my half.\"",

    "title": "Why I Stopped a GLP-1 Medication After 5 Months",
    "text": "I tried taking [GLP-1 medication](https://www.eatingwell.com/what-are-glp-1-medications-who-should-use-them-8730466) injections for five months. Spoiler alert: They didn’t work as I’d hoped, but I have no regrets. I learned that these GLP-1 medications—which have become highly popular for diabetes management and weight loss—don’t work the same way for everyone. Perhaps best of all, my experiment with the medication renewed my commitment to losing weight primarily through healthy lifestyle choices, like diet and exercise. Here’s what happened, why I stopped and what I learned.\nThe Backstory\nI have always struggled with my weight, and have had bouts of [yo-yo dieting](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041459/fad-diets/) since I was 20. When I quit drinking in 2003, I turned to food and overeating to compensate for the loss of the alcohol. As a result, I gained a large amount of weight—more than 80 pounds—and I have not been able to lose it since. I struggle with an appetite that constantly gnaws away at me. With my busy schedule as a full-time writer and part-time teacher, I tend to deprioritize physical activity. All of these factors have brewed into a cocktail of obesity, and I want to reverse it.\nAbout two years ago, I became more motivated about losing weight. I joined the YMCA and, in a dramatic change of lifestyle, became a gym regular! I often shut the place down, even on a Friday night. I went to the gym several times a week: twice a week for water aerobics and the rest of the time for lifting weights and walking the track. I lost about 40 pounds.\nYet, after many months, my work schedule changed to include a large commute a few days a week that got me home late at night. That affected my gym habits and, once again, made it difficult to manage the food noise (where thoughts of foods become intrusive and inescapable, and can impact the ability to stick with a diet and exercise program).\nTrying the GLP-1 Medication\nI knew I needed the extra help to get back to working toward my weight-loss goals. So, I met with a doctor via video chat, and paid for a three-month introductory supply of GLP-1 medication injections. I was so excited to get my package in the mail with vials of medication, needles and alcohol wipes to clean the injection site on my stomach. This three-month supply started with the lowest dose, then increased gradually every couple of weeks to what would be the maximum dose by the end of the trial period.\nAt first, I felt very optimistic, as the low dose significantly reduced my appetite. I thought I might even be able to stay at that lower and less costly dose, because I was less than halfway to the maximum dose and getting notable results. I had few side effects, and my nighttime hunger (which historically was strong) significantly subsided.\nHowever, several years ago I had tried another GLP-1 medication and while it started off similarly, the effect it had on my appetite wore off quickly. My doctor would increase the dose, and it would suppress my appetite again—and then wear off in a few weeks. Within a couple of months, I was on the maximum dose and noticing hardly any difference in my hunger levels or weight.\nUnfortunately, the same thing happened with this GLP-1 medication. It worked fairly well at the smaller dose, and by the end of the three-month program, I had lost over 10 pounds. I purchased another two-month supply at the highest dose, but after five months total, the drug was barely impacting my appetite and my total weight loss was around 20 pounds. At this point, I made the choice to discontinue using the medication.\nThe Bottom Line\nWhile GLP-1 medications certainly can help with weight loss for some, they did not work as I expected for me. Plus, it is common to regain weight after discontinuing the medication. It may sound like dated advice, but losing weight and maintaining it for the long term typically boils down to tried-and-true lifestyle habits, like balanced diet, regular exercise, quality sleep and stress management.\nMost importantly, I am committed to working around my commute and work schedule and making time for physical activity. Even things like walking up and down the hall for a break at work can add up! To support my goals and meet my nutrition needs, I will continue eating more healthy foods that I enjoy, like salads with [homemade vinaigrette](https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252847/all-purpose-vinaigrette/), [hummus](https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252614/classic-hummus/) and vegetables, fruit and peanut butter and [protein shakes](https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18611/drinks/smoothies/protein/).",

    "text": "My hands are literally over my eyes — EA’s swung the axe again , cutting around 300 jobs, and yep, Respawn took a major hit Around 100 jobs were cut from the team behind Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi , and two mysterious projects in early development have been straight-up canned.\nOne of those? A Titanfall spin-off, reportedly an extraction shooter codenamed “R7.” Pour one out for Titanfall 3 , again.\nThe layoffs aren’t just devs, either. EA ’s “Experiences” team — which includes fan support, marketing, and customer service — also got slashed.\nEA says this is all part of their plan to “better align teams and resources,” but fans (and former staff) aren’t exactly buying the corporate speak.\nOn social media, it’s mostly outrage and jokes about how this definitely won’t help the next Apex season ship without bugs.\nIf this is sounding familiar, it’s because EA already laid off nearly 700 people earlier this year. A\ndd that to recent cutbacks at studios like BioWare and Codemasters, and you’ve got a company that’s feeling the heat from underperforming games and a $6 billion market drop earlier this year.\nRespawn says they’re still committed to Apex Legends and building the next Star Wars Jedi game, promising “bold new experiences” and “pushing the boundaries.”\nBut when your bold ideas get axed before they leave pre-production, it’s hard not to feel like creativity is losing to the quarterly earnings report.\nNo word yet on what Respawn’s working on beyond Apex and Jedi , but if you were holding out hope for a Titanfall comeback… yeah, it’s time to let go (again).\nEA hasn’t ruled out future projects, but for now, the mechs are staying in the garage.\nWhat’s left is another brutal reminder that the people making the games we love are often the first to go when things don’t sell big — even when those things are actually good .",

The shock was very big,” he said, though he noted that the numbers have been steadily increasing since.\nIn the aftermath of the Hamas onslaught on southwestern Israel on Oct 7., a new form of tourism, often referred to as “solidarity tourism,” has emerged, with many traveling to Israel independently or as part of an organized tour and joining volunteer activities for the duration of their stay. Currently some 3,000 people land in Israel daily, at least a third of them falling into the solidarity tourism category.\n“The most important benefit of solidarity tourism in my view is the moral effect,” said Lewi. “We feel that the world is against us. Having tourists come to meet evacuees, volunteer and visit affected areas is a huge boost to collective morale and strengthens the connection between Israelis and Jewish communities abroad,” he added.\nLewi emphasized the importance of the solidarity tourism phenomenon.\n“We are facing a wave of denial. Some think that the atrocities are somehow exaggerated. Each person who comes is another voice, and we need those voices on Instagram, Tik Tok or X, to answer those who oppose Israel’s right to defend itself,” Lewi said.\nThe Sword of Iron-Israel Volunteer Opportunities Facebook group has been a rich resource for those looking to document their solidarity tourism experience in Israel. The group counts just above 13,000 participants, the majority of whom come to Israel for a relatively short period, use the group to find volunteering opportunities and later share their experiences.\n“We kept hearing of a need for a centralized platform featuring volunteering opportunities. We decided to create one,” said Yocheved Ruttenberg, Sword of Iron’s co-founder.\nShortly after the Hamas attacks, Ruttenberg, whose brother serves as an officer in the commando brigade, raised $17,000 and imported 23 duffle bags with equipment for soldiers.\nShe connected with Hagit Greenberg-Amar and her husband Shay, from Ramat Gan in central Israel, who had been fundraising, purchasing and importing medical and military equipment for soldiers on the front lines.\nIn the framework of a program that Ruttenberg and Greenberg-Amar launched in partnership with Livnot U’Lehibanot, an Israel experience program, volunteers from abroad can register and pay $200 a week to take part in rebuilding Israel’s south, receiving accommodation, transportation and two meals a day.\nMax Rosenthal, who arrived in Israel on Jan. 29 from Columbus, Ohio, to volunteer for four weeks, took part in the Sword of Iron and Livnot U’Lehibanot program to rebuild the south.\n“I was based in Sderot and went around towns and villages, painting schools and trying to help prepare the facilities for families about to return with their children,” Rosenthal told JNS.\nThe Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command last week approved the return of evacuees to many southern Israel communities.\nRosenthal also volunteered with Eran’s Angels, a grassroots volunteer organization located at Expo Tel Aviv Center, which gathers and distributes toiletry essentials and other supplies to displaced families as well as non-perishable goods to soldiers on the front lines. “We said to ourselves that if we were able to help even a dozen people, it would be worth it. Today, over 13,000 people help each other via our group,” Greenberg-Amar told JNS.\nSimone Kadden, 74, originally from New York and who currently lives in Madrid, came to Israel to volunteer and used Sword of Iron to organize her trip.\n“I felt that it wasn’t enough to watch the news and send checks. I needed to get involved, come to Israel and be with the Jewish people,” Kadden told JNS.\nAs part of her trip, Kadden guided people through the mock Hamas tunnel at Tel Aviv’s Hostage Square. She picked kohlrabi with Leket Israel, Israel’s leading food rescue organization. She will also be visiting wounded soldiers in hospitals and preparing food for soldiers.\n“I wanted to come as an individual and not as part of an organized trip. The group made that possible for me. They pointed out who to get in touch with and opportunities available at the time of my trip,” she added.\nThe Sword of Iron group comprises 35% Americans who travel to Israel for a short-to-medium period, 33% Israelis as well as 4.4% from the United Kingdom, 4% from Canada, 2.2% from Australia and 1.7% from South Africa.\n“We often hear from those who come to Israel that they could not stay away and that their emotional connection led them to travel to Israel and help out,” Yael Yomtov-Emmanuel, the moderator of the Sword of Iron Facebook group, told JNS. “They understand from us that they don’t necessarily have to spend a lot of money on organized tours, they can travel by themselves and allocate this money to charity,” she added.\nAriel Konstantyn, rabbi at the Tel Aviv International Synagogue, received many requests from volunteers coming from abroad to join the synagogue’s volunteering WhatsApp group and take part in volunteer activities.\n“The group existed before Oct. 7 but it grew exponentially after the war started,” Konstantyn told JNS. “We currently have over 600 members in our WhatsApp group,” he added.\nThe congregation organizes farming activities, cultural events for evacuees from the north and south of the country and barbecues and other food for soldiers.\nAfter interrupting flights due to the war, United Airlines, which previously had the highest number of flights to Israel of any American carrier, said it will resume daily nonstop service from Newark, N.J., to Tel Aviv starting on March 6. However, the airline does not plan to restart flights from additional U.S. cities until at least the fall. Delta Airlines is expected to follow suit on May 1. The low-cost airlines are also beginning to return to Israel.\nTo read more content visit www.jns.org\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window)",

    "text": "WEST ALLIS, Wis. — People often see We Energies trucks after a storm or major outage. What people don’t see is the work that goes into turning the lights back on.\nAfter two decades in the industry, Dale Malecha can explain how just about any piece of power equipment works\nHe began working for We-Energies as a lineman, or the people you see fixing power lines, 23 years ago before moving his way up the ladder to become a Troubleshooter.\n“[Linemen] do the fixing, I do the figuring,” explained Malecha. “And that’s what I enjoy about the job.”\nMalecha is the first face residents will see on the scene when their power is out. It's his job to look around, figure out what went wrong, and see if crews are needed.\n“It’s like a puzzle. One job I’m sent to can sound identical to a job that I just came from, but when you get out there, circumstances can make it a completely different job.”\nHe'll be the first to say how much he loves solving the problems he's called to fix, but on days when storms are knocking out power for thousands of residents at a time, there can certainly be frustration.\nJanuary's storms that caused record-breaking outages were an example of that.\n“The trees would accumulate snow, they would contact our wires and they would cause an outage, and that would cause the snow to fall off the tree,” explained Malecha. “But since it was still snowing, five minutes, ten minutes after we got the power back on, another tree somewhere else on the very same line would do the same thing.”\nThe result was 233,000 outages, some going on for days.\n“Obviously first we prioritize hazard, if there's a hazardous situation, we are going to get to that and address that first,” the Troubleshooter shared.\nHe says after that they’ll tackle the outages that affect the most amount of people and work their way through the list from there.\nThose situations mean 16-hour shifts, and plenty of problem-solving, but for Malecha, all the hard work is a labor of love.\n“I love it, that’s my favorite part of this job, honestly,” he told TMJ4. “My favorite part is just the fact that nothing’s the same and there’s a reason for everything.”",
