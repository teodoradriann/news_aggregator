    "title": "El conflicto con el sindicato STL: quince años de desencuentros",
    "text": "El Sindicato de Trabajadores de Limpieza (STL) es una entidad local, con pocos afiliados, pero muy importante porque controlaba hasta hace semanas el comité de empresa del servicio de recogida de basura y de limpieza viaria. Su fundador y secretario general es Miguel Áncel Sánchez Fuentes. Sus detractores le acusan de métodos poco limpios y fue despedido por PreZero el pasado mes de agosto.\nControlar el comité de empresa de la recogida de basura le había otorgado un poder desproporcionado a STL, que usaba para presionar a la concesionaria y al Ayuntamiento, incluso varias veces al año. Este verano estuvo marcado por el conflicto de la recogida de basura: comenzó en San Juan y terminó cuando la regidora decretó la emergencia sanitaria y recurrió a Valoriza para realizar el servicio de recogida de basura. No es la primera vez. La alcaldesa, Inés Rey, ya había declarado la emergencia sanitaria el 28 de febrero de 2022.\nLo acontecido este verano, sin embargo, no tiene precedentes. La huelga de los basureros fue la más larga que se ha producido jamás en este servicio vital. La regidora aseguró después que no se cedió a los chantajes, ya que, argumentó, no se trataba de una huelga para defender en derecho laboral de los trabajadores.\nEl 9 de agosto fue la primera vez que STL abandonaba la protesta sin conseguir por lo menos parte de sus reivindicaciones, lo que supone un cambio de paradigma importante. Ni siquiera pudo conseguir que la empresa retirase las sanciones con las que castigó a los trabajadores por incumplimientos a la hora de ejecutar su trabajo, ni tampoco readmitir a los despedidos. En este sentido, se puede entender como una victoria del Ayuntamiento frente a un sindicato, el de STL, que controlaba el comité de recogida de basura desde hace más de quince años, a lo largo de los cuales había entrado en conflicto en 21 ocasiones. Ni los desperdicios que llegaron a amontonarse hasta el punto de impedir el paso por las aceras, ni los más de 150 contenedores quemados (algo que STL ha condenado siempre) sirvieron de nada. Ni Ayuntamiento ni empresa cedieron en esta ocasión. Ni siquiera las protestas del comité de empresa, que siempre insistió en que Prezero no cumple las condiciones del convenio ni tampoco el pliego de condiciones de la concesión, sirvieron de nada.\nSTL siempre se ha desmarcado de las quemas de contenedores, algo que también hizo el día 2 de este mes, cuando aparecieron calcinados cinco camiones en la nave de PreZero.",

    "text": "IT isn’t subtle. Nor is it intended to be.\nInstead of a pastoral-looking Nativity scene, the creche features baby Jesus wrapped in a checkered Palestinian kaffiyeh, surrounded by jagged chunks of stone – evoking bombed-out buildings in the Gaza Strip and children buried beneath them.\n“I see God in the rubble,” said Munther Isaac, the Palestinian pastor of a landmark Lutheran church in Bethlehem, the West Bank town revered by Christians as Jesus’ birthplace. “And Christ was born under occupation.”\nTogether with parishioners, he created the wartime tableau, which will remain in place at the church through the Christmas season. The image is a jarring one, Isaac acknowledges – but cannot come close to summing up the daily horrors taking place only 45 miles (72.3km) distant, in Gaza.\nPalestinian Christians, a fast-dwindling minority in the Holy Land, are marking an especially sombre Christmas this year, cancelling holiday festivities in an expression of solidarity with compatriots as Israel’s war on the Palestinian militant group Hamas grinds on.\nThe creche at a landmark Lutheran church in Bethlehem, West Bank, features baby Jesus surrounded by jagged chunks of stone – evoking bombed-out buildings.\nIn this third month of Israeli bombardment of Gaza, coupled with a wide-ranging ground offensive – both launched after Hamas attackers killed hundreds of Israelis in their homes and at an open-air dance festival – the death toll inside the crowded coastal enclave stands at more than 20,000, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to Palestinian officials.\nIn Bethlehem, where many local Christians have relatives in Gaza, the Christmas holiday will be marked by prayers, church services and the annual procession of Christian patriarchs – but the more joyous traditional trappings are being eschewed. No twinkling Christmas lights, no lavishly decorated tree in Manger Square, no festive parade with marching bands.\n“How could we celebrate?” asked the town’s mayor, Hanna Hanania, whose office overlooks a nearly deserted Manger Square. The flagstone plaza facing the Church of the Nativity, a pilgrimage site for Christians the world over, is usually bustling at this time of year, but most of the souvenir shops and restaurants lining it are tightly shuttered.\nBethlehem, where once-majority Christians now make up fewer than one-fifth of the town’s population of some 30,000, is a microcosm of the West Bank’s woes. Checkpoints hem it in, and the stony terraced hills – where shepherds watched their flocks by night, as the traditional Christmas carol has it – are transversed by a hulking Israeli security barrier.\nSurrounded by Jewish settlements, the town is home to two Palestinian refugee camps that seethe with unrest and are regularly raided by Israeli troops.\n“It’s not the little town of the Bible anymore,” said the Reverend Mitri Raheb, president of Bethlehem’s Dar al-Kalima University. At 61, he remembers when the unobstructed view from his nearby family home was a mountainside that turned green in spring rains. Now it is topped by a settlement, one of nearly 150 in the West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law.\nFor Palestinian Christians, the current war marks a catastrophe embedded within a catastrophe: the potential eradication of what was already a minuscule Christian presence in Gaza. Numbering fewer than 1,000 out of a population of more than 2.2 million, the community’s wartime losses are disproportionately felt.\nMany Bethlehem-area Christians have relatives in Gaza, and are terrified for their safety.\nAn outbuilding of Gaza City’s oldest working church, St. Porphyrius, was hit by Israeli bombardment in October, killing at least 16 of the hundreds of people sheltering there, according to Palestinian officials. Former US Representative Justin Amash, a Palestinian American, posted anguished social-media accounts about several Christian relatives killed or maimed in the strike.\n“Our family is hurting badly,” the Michigan Republican-turned-independent wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “May God watch over all Christians in Gaza – and all Israelis and Palestinians who are suffering, whatever their religion or creed.”\nRecently, two Christian women sheltering at a Roman Catholic church compound in Gaza City were killed by Israeli sniper fire, the Latin Patriarchate in Jerusalem said. Relatives identified them as a mother and daughter – Naheda Anton, 71, and her daughter, Samr Anton, 58 – and said that after the older woman was hit, her daughter tried to pull her to safety, and was shot as well.\nJawdat Hanna Mikhail, the grandson of one slain woman and the nephew of the other, said several other family members inside the Holy Family compound tried to reach the pair, and were shot and wounded themselves.\n“Snipers are deployed around the church,” said Mikhail, 27, who lives in Beit Sahur, just outside Bethlehem. “Nobody can move.”\nPope Francis condemned the killing of the women. A British member of Parliament, Layla Moran, has been posting on social media about members of her extended family, including 11-year-old twins, also trapped in the complex.\n“I’m now no longer sure they are going to survive until Christmas,” she told the BBC.\nSome longtime monitors of Christian demographic trends say that after years of hardship, the small and struggling community in Gaza stands on the verge of extinction.\n“I fear that this war will be the end of the Christian presence in Gaza,” said Raheb, the college president. “It is a bleeding wound.”\nThe surging violence also points up the complex internal interplay in the occupied Palestinian territories between Christians and the overwhelming Muslim majority. Recent surveys suggest Hamas’ popularity among Palestinians in both the West Bank and Gaza is running higher despite – or because of – the devastating Oct 7 cross-border attack on Israel that precipitated the war.\nGaza’s Christian population numbered about 3,000 when Hamas took over the narrow Mediterranean strip in 2007; about two-thirds of them left in the intervening years, before the start of this war.\nAlthough generally wealthier and better educated than the population as a whole, Christians in Gaza endured or were driven out by the same privations as other Palestinians – raging unemployment, lack of opportunity, periodic battles between Israel and Hamas. But they were also chilled by the unsolved slaying, in the early days of Hamas rule, of a prominent Christian bookstore manager who had been threatened before his death by jihadist groups.\nIn Bethlehem, a decree from the West Bank’s governing Palestinian Authority mandates that the city’s mayor, deputy mayor and a majority of the municipal council must be Christians. Prior to that, a coalition backed by Hamas, which functions as a political movement in addition to its armed wing, held a council majority, the mayor said.\n“They are our neighbours,” he said.\nAt the Church of the Nativity, the ancient limestone basilica venerated by Christians as marking the place of Christ’s birth, hard times have helped dampen tensions between the three Christian sects that share control of its premises.\nIn past years, jurisdictional clashes over nooks and crannies in the church’s dim, incense-scented recesses had sometimes boiled over into physical altercations.\nFather Issa Thaljieh, a 40-year-old Greek Orthodox parish priest at the Church of the Nativity, said there was relative harmony among the sects now, their disputes vastly overshadowed by the war.\nFather Issa, born and raised in Bethlehem, said that from boyhood on, he felt the powerful pull of spiritual wonder associated with not only the basilica but the town itself, even as the ongoing conflict with Israel disfigured the biblical landscape surrounding Bethlehem.\nThough he could live and work elsewhere, he said he feels a call of duty to stay and minister to his shrinking flock.\nDeep grief over death and destruction in Gaza pervades the holiday, the priest said, but he also saw this season as a beacon of much-needed hope.\n“These are very, very sad times,” he said. “But the message of Bethlehem and the message of Christmas, which is the message of peace, is more important than ever.” — Los Angeles Times/TNS\nOpen Modal ×",

    "text": "Former President Donald Trump promised to use a second term in the White House to defend Christian values and even suggested he'd shield the faith's central iconography, warning a convention of religious broadcasters on Thursday night that the left wants “to tear down crosses.”\n“Remember, every communist regime throughout history has tried to stamp out the churches, just like every fascist regime has tried to co-opt them and control them. And, in America, the radical left is trying to do both,\" Trump told hundreds of cheering attendees at the National Religious Broadcasters International Christian Media Convention in Nashville.\n“They want to tear down crosses where they can, and cover them up with social justice flags,” Trump added. “But no one will be touching the cross of Christ under the Trump administration, I swear to you.”\nPledging protections for the symbol of Christianity recalled the former president recently telling the National Rifle Association, \"No one will lay a finger on your firearms.” It also comes as leading conservatives have increasingly called on the Trump to openly build his second term around Christian values, should he win.\nTrump is favored in a Republican primary where the once crowded field has dwindled to just him and his former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley. The Christian media gathering, where sponsors distributed free red and white baseball caps emblazoned with “Make America Pray Again,” was exceedingly friendly territory for the former president, whose address often felt more like a rally than a staid convention speech.\n“The left is trying to shame Christians,\" Trump said. \"They’re trying to shame us. I’m a very proud Christian.”\nTrump brought the crowd to its feet repeatedly and frequently championed his record on abortion, including appointing three conservative Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the Roe v. Wade decision. But he notably didn't mention the Alabama Supreme Court ruling that has prompted providers there to pause in vitro fertilization after justices ruled that frozen embryos could be considered children under state law.\nPresident Joe Biden 's reelection campaign released a blank statement on the matter late Thursday, ironically calling attention to Trump's lack of reaction on the \"Alabama IVF ruling he is responsible for.”\nInstead, Trump used his speech to boast that he had used his first term to do “more to uphold religious freedom than any administration in history.”\n“The enthusiasm for this election coming up in November is far greater than it was in 2016 or 2020,\" he said. \"Far greater, it’s not even a contest.”\nTennessee holds its primary on Super Tuesday, March 5, when many states around the country vote and could move Trump to the cusp of claiming the Republican nomination.\nSome religious leaders were initially hesitant to get behind multi-divorcee Trump when he first ran for president in 2016, but now they are among his mostly solidly loyal “Make America Great Again” base.\nThat's despite a personal history that has only gotten more checkered in recent years, including Trump being indicted in New York in connection with hush money payments made to a porn actress in an attempt to suppress an extramarital affair.\n“When he came onto the scene, people were skeptical,” said Troy Miller, president and CEO of the National Religious Broadcasters. “But I think, as they’ve learned more and listened to Donald Trump speak, the one thing I hear all the time from people ... is that they really feel like Donald Trump understands them and that’s the biggest connection that people make is, ‘This is a guy in politics who gets us, who understands us, who doesn’t talk like he’s an elitist and talk down to us.’”",
