    "title": "Premier League : Arsenal chute face à West Ham et manque l’occasion de prendre la tête",
    "text": "Ancien joueur d’Arsenal, Konstantinos Mavropanos a marqué le deuxième but de West Ham ce soir et a largement contribué à la victoire de son équipe (0-2) à l’Emirates Stadium. Reuters/Peter Cziborra\nUn petit exploit pour West Ham et un coup d’arrêt pour les Gunners ! En s’imposant (0-2) à l’Emirates Stadium, Alphonse Areola et ses coéquipiers ont assommé Arsenal ce jeudi soir, en clôture de la 19e journée de Premier League.\nLes Gunners devaient s’imposer pour repasser devant Liverpool, prendre la tête du championnat et dans le même temps distancer Manchester City et le Aston Villa d’Unai Emery. Mais les hommes de Mikel Arteta ont manqué de réalisme comme l’attestent les statistiques de la rencontre : 74,2 % de possession en leur faveur, 30 tirs dont huit cadrés, contre seulement six dont trois cadrés pour leurs adversaires.\nFace à eux, les joueurs de West Ham ont su être opportunistes en marquant en début de première mi-temps sur un contre initié par l’ancien Lyonnais Lucas Paqueta et conclu par Tomas Soucek (13e). Les arbitres ont hésité à le valider, en vérifiant si le ballon n’était pas sorti à gauche de la cage sur la remise précédent le but mais ont fini par l’accorder.\nEn seconde période, c’est sur corner et grâce à une tête décroisée d’un ancien d’Arsenal, Konstantinos Mavropanos, bien aidé par le poteau et la barre transversale (55e), que West Ham a fait le break. Les Hammers auraient même pu achever leurs adversaires avec un pénalty obtenu dans les ultimes secondes, stoppé par David Raya.\nTottenham stoppe sa série à Brighton En difficulté à l’extérieur ces dernières semaines, les Hammers réalisent une très belle opération dans la course à la qualification européenne. West Ham occupe la sixième place du classement de Premier League grâce à ce succès et devance notamment Manchester United.\nPlus tôt dans la soirée, l’autre rencontre de cette 19e journée de Premier League a vu Brighton surprendre Tottenham dans un match très rythmé (4-2). Les Spurs, qui restaient pourtant sur une série de trois victoires consécutives, n’ont pas réussi à faire leur retard après deux buts de Jack Hinshelwood (11e) et Joao Pedro (23e sur pénalty).\nIls ont perdu tout espoir après les troisième et quatrième buts de Pervis Estupinan (63e) et Joao Pedro (75e, de nouveau sur pénalty), malgré les réductions du score d’Alejo Veliz (81e) et Ben Davies (85e). Tottenham pointe à la cinquième place du classement.",

    "text": "At a briefing on mpox developments today in African countries, top health officials from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said that an ongoing crisis in South Kivu Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), one of the main hot spots, has forced at least 400 mpox patients to flee treatment centers.\nJean Kaseya, MD, MPH, Africa CDC's director-general, said the development increases the risk of spread within and beyond the province, including to neighboring countries. He added that four healthcare facilities in South Kivu have been destroyed and looted, and that the violence has displaced more than 153,000 people.\nConflict and insecurity have interrupted mpox reporting in South Kivu province over the past 2 weeks, he added.\nMpox outbreaks have affected 22 African countries, and 13 are in the active phase. Cases are trending upward in 6 countries: Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Zambia, the Republic of Congo, Uganda, and the DRC. In the Republic of Congo, nearly 70% cases are among males, and clades 1a and 1b are co-circulating.\nKaseya said that, in the most affected countries, hot spots include capital cities, such as Brazzaville, Congo and Lusaka, Zambia.\nSeven countries have received mpox vaccine shipments, and five are currently vaccinating. So far, more than 200,000 doses have been administered. Kaseya said another promising development is the decentralization of lab capacity.\nWaiting for clarification on US funding waiver\nLast week, officials said a pause in aid from the United States is hampering the transport of mpox samples to labs in some of the most affected counties, which officials said today includes Uganda.\nKaseya said the US government has issued a waiver for humanitarian funds, but the situations for accessing the support haven't been clearly communicated to African countries. He said transportation of samples and vaccines are part of lifesaving assistance.\nAlso, at an African Union assembly that just concluded, leaders approved an African Epidemic Fund that is designed to streamline resources for preparedness and response in the region. Kaseya called the epidemic fund a \"game changer\" and said the African Union also made progress on an agenda for local drug and vaccine manufacturing and built support for innovating health financing.",

In his words, God, who has a “Ukrainian flag on his shoulder”, will give life overcoming death, said Reuters, quoted by BTA.\n“Let’s pray for each other. When we all came closer to each other, we stopped being strangers to each other,” said Zelensky, dressed in a traditional Ukrainian vishyanka shirt and traditional khaki pants, in an emotional address on social media “Telegram”.\nStanding in front of the 1,000-year-old Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, a spiritual and architectural monument of Orthodoxy in Ukraine, Zelensky noted that his country has been fighting for victory against Russia for 802 day.\n“And we believe: God has a chevron on his shoulder with the flag of Ukraine. So with such a friend, life can only defeat death.”\nIn Moscow, President Vladimir Putin attended the holiday service, which was led by the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, who strongly supports the Russian leader and his war in Ukraine.\nTens of thousands of people have been killed and millions displaced from their homes since Putin ordered an invasion of Russia ’s smaller neighbor in February 2022. The war has entered its third year, but no its end is yet to be seen, Reuters notes.\nZelensky, who is Jewish, called for prayers above all for the soldiers who will welcome Easter in the trenches to come back alive and well, as well as the land and the people, at his the spirit is “unbreakable” and who, he said, will. they will one day see a free Ukraine.\n“Only Ukrainians kneel in prayer,” Zelensky said. “There were never before residents and invaders.”\nAdd the rating:\n☆\n☆\n☆\n☆\n☆\n2.1\nAssessment 2.1 from 33 voice\n2024-05-05 08:53:00\n#Volodymyr #Zelensky #called #Ukrainians #Join #prayers #invincible\nRelated posts: Fighters from group \"O\" captured a brand new Bulgarian tank in Ukraine PHOTOS Lied and scolded the spores Covid-19: A first glimmer of hope on the coronavirus front - Switzerland Finally ice hockey, finally ERC - Eishockey.net Share this: Facebook X",
