    "text": "▲林采緹和同居男友的戀情在本刊直擊下曝光。（本刊資料照）\n圖文／鏡週刊\n「蛇姬」林采緹和食品生意負責人男友晨泓均穩定交往4年，近期搬進台北市精華區的小豪宅，卻因林采緹的網購、公關品太多，經常堆積在大廳的公共空間，好幾日未取，惹得有些鄰居抱怨。\n林采緹2022年和前夫胡睿兒離婚，2023年就被本刊拍到和現任男友晨泓均甜蜜約會，兩人還一起經營事業，男友是林采緹投資的海南雞飯品牌負責人，於公於私都黏著著，近期更一同搬進位於台北市精華區的小豪宅居住，顯見兩人感情越來越穩定。\n▲林采緹和男友搬進新居，卻立即遭鄰居抱怨。（本刊資料照）\n有鄰居向本刊透露，社區不是頭一次有藝人入住，大家都很習慣，林采緹在社區不會刻意熱情，鄰居也把她當作普通人看待，只是因為林采緹常常收到公關品和網購，都會堆積在一樓大廳的公共空間，而且好幾天都沒來拿，「就有的鄰居會嫌這樣很亂，有礙觀瞻啦」而目前也僅向管理員抱怨，希望林采緹能夠盡快改善。只是林采緹才剛喜迎新居，就惹來鄰居碎唸，未來還得做好敦親睦鄰。\n▲林采緹身材火辣，有「蛇姬」封號。（翻攝自林采緹臉書）\n這也不是林采緹第一次被鄰居投訴，2017年她和胡睿兒在萬華同居時，就曾被控訴半夜開趴，音樂太大聲，甚至半夜吵架、喧嘩讓人失眠。只不過當時林采緹的經紀人提油救火，回應「萬華人脾氣也不是很好」更批爆料不實，最後則由林采緹發臉書道歉才了事。",

    "text": "Bob Katter has accused Qantas of being anti-Christian after claiming the national air carrier snubbed traditional Christmas carols inside of one of its prestigious business class lounges. In a written complaint against the airline, the independent MP said he was angered to hear no holiday music with faith-based messages while sitting in a Qantas Club during a flight delay. 'I noticed that throughout the two hours I was there, they were playing 'Xmas' music,' Mr Katter said. 'Two hours of the most un-Christmassy music I've ever heard. Bob Katter has accused Qantas of being anti-Christian after claiming the national air carrier snubbed traditional Christmas carols inside of one of its prestigious business class lounges 'Over 80 per cent of Australia's population are generational Australians, and they were brought up on Christmas Carols. 'It would seem then, that Qantas is anti-Christian.' According to the most recent census data, there has been a steady decline in the number of Australians who identify as Christian, with overall numbers dropping from 74 per cent in 1991 to 44 per cent in 2021. The same data found that while fewer people are identifying as Christian, the number of people claiming no religion has risen to 38 per cent in 2021, up from 30 per cent in 2016. In his pre-Christmas rant, Mr Katter, who represents the division of Kennedy in Queensland - went on to lash former Qantas CEO Alan Joyce. In a written complaint against the airline, the independent MP said he was angered to hear no holiday music with faith-based messages while sitting in a Qantas Club during a flight delay Mr Joyce quit in early September after the airline came under the spotlight over allegations of illegal ticket sales and poor service. 'As time goes on, more and more Christians will, I hope, become aware of your spite,' he wrote. 'So whilst Alan Joyce (Australia's most hated man?) may be gone, his 'spirit' clearly lives on. 'But one thing for sure - his spirit 'ain't' 'The Spirit of Australia'. Qantas has been contacted for comment.",

    "title": "RTL resurrects Jesus in Kassel",
    "text": "Kassel – The Son of God donates Pizza Frutti di Mare and Kassel is considered the “new Jerusalem”: RTL has once again retold the story of Jesus Christ in an extraordinary way with its second Bible musical “The Passion”. The show, which interweaves the suffering of the Savior with German pop songs, was staged in Kassel in the evening and broadcast live on television. Unfortunately the sky was not kind to the actors and spectators – it was raining in northern Hesse.\nJesus was played by singer and presenter Ben Blümel (42), actor Jimi Blue Ochsenknecht (32) took on the role of the traitor Judas. Singer Nadja Benaissa (41) from the pop band No Angels sang her way through several songs as Mother Mary, while actor Francis Fulton-Smith (57) portrayed a diabolical Roman governor Pontius Pilate with a tie and pocket square. “Good Times, Bad Times” actor Timur Ülker appeared as Peter – the disciple on whom Jesus wants to “build his church”.\nHannes Jaenicke leads through the Bible\nHowever, actor Hannes Jaenicke (64) had the biggest speaking role, as the narrator led through the biblical material and steadfastly defied the rain (“I’m not made of sugar”). The actor is also known as a committed environmentalist – and has highlighted the suffering of rhinos and orangutans throughout his career. That evening he tried to explain why Jesus’ suffering could still be relevant. “Our story today is not a fairy tale. “It really happened one way or another,” said Jaenicke. And it has the potential to “bring people together again”.\nRTL staged “The Passion” for the first time in 2022, back then in Essen. The viewership was impressive. The idiosyncratic mix of a decidedly modern interpretation of the Jesus story, a little theology and all sorts of RTL celebrities in supporting roles was fascinating and provided plenty of topics for discussion. The format has been running in the Netherlands for several years.\nLast Supper: Ciabatta and pizza\nSo now the second German performance, in which the ancient material was illustrated with images from a German city in the here and now. Jesus, for example, arrived in Kassel rock solid on the Deutsche Bahn – “on time,” as Jaenicke emphasized, which led to the biggest laugh of the evening in the audience. Meanwhile, some disciples roared up on e-scooters. For the Last Supper, the Savior then ordered Italian food – five ciabatta breads and two pizzas. Topping: Frutti di Mare. As a silent witness, ex-football manager Reiner Calmund followed the order of the Savior in a guest role, as he did in 2022. Reality TV veteran Jenny Elvers played a blind woman who was given back her sight by Jesus. Long robes, dust and sandals like those in Bible films were looked for in vain.\nSome people were still quite surprised. “I’m a bit irritated,” said viewer Mareike from Kassel. She didn’t realize that the production was so modern. Apart from the weather, she liked it. 8,000 people were able to watch the show on the main stage at the central Friedrichsplatz.\n“Kassel should be our new Jerusalem”\nNarrator Jaenicke portrayed Kassel – a city in the middle of Germany that is rarely featured in the media with a rough charm in some places – as an almost perfect location for the Bible drama. The “population center” of the Federal Republic is very close, he said. “So if we were all going to have a big meeting, Kassel would be the place for it.” Unfortunately, there is currently a long way to go in the country for a family reunion.\n“Society is drifting apart at an alarming rate. Racism, sexism, anti-Semitism and the climate crisis threaten our society,” said Jaenicke. And he added the iconic sentences: “Our population center today is RTL. And Kassel should be our new Jerusalem.” When looking at the television images showing many people in rain ponchos, it was sometimes difficult to follow this mental journey to Jerusalem.\nGod saves marriage after infidelity\nParallel to the Jesus story on stage, a procession with a heavy, glowing cross moved through the city. RTL presenter Angela Finger-Erben (“The atmosphere here is really breathtaking”) interviewed people there about their stories with God. Sometimes astonishing things were heard. For example, the story of a family that traveled from Flensburg to Kassel especially for the “Passion”. The husband, who was carrying the cross, told the TV audience about an affair that had once caused the marriage to break up. But she was saved with the help of God. “I prayed a lot,” said his wife. “He gave me courage to forgive.”\nAt the end, singer Ben Blümel stood on a multi-story shopping street in Kassel – beaming, in a white shirt and as a resurrected Jesus. Whether it was North Hesse or Jerusalem – the main thing was that Easter could come.",
