    "title": "'Essential' gardening hack will make your lawn 'deep green' and moss-free this winter - NewsBreak",
    "text": "By Angela Patrone & Samantha Ibrahim ,\n31 minutes ago Moss can pose a significant challenge to lawn care, as it severely impacts the health of grass . While fertilizers can aid in rejuvenating your lawn, most are ineffective during colder periods due to low ground and air temperatures.\nHowever, gardening experts at Lawn Smiths suggest an excellent alternative for winter lawn care - ferrous sulphate, also known as iron sulphate. For maintaining a lush lawn throughout the year, the professionals stress the importance of applying iron sulphate, even during winter.\nThey stated: \"Ferrous sulphate is great for grass . From greening in the summer to protecting in the winter and killing moss in spring, it's the perfect lawn treatment.\"\n\"Iron sulphate provides a wonderful deep green hue without necessitating extra mowing. It also helps keep the grass healthy during the cooler months.\"\nThis product replenishes the soil with nutrients during or after winter. Iron sulphate is available from various online stores and brands, reports the Express .\nThe Pro-Kleen Iron Sulphate is priced on Amazon. Customers have found this fertilizer effective in controlling moss growth and enhancing the greenness of their lawns.\nIt is easy to apply, comes with clear instructions, and many customers consider it good value for money. The Cleenly Iron Sulphate has been praised as \"excellent\" for treating moss. Alternatively, Pure Source Iron Sulphate is available on eBay.\nTo achieve a lush, verdant lawn, garden aficionados have a helpful tip: mix iron sulphate with water. This concoction will produce a \"superb green-up effect on the grass\" and is quite safe, provided there's an abundance of moisture around.\nFor a 100-meter square patch, mix 60 to 250g of iron sulphate (variable based on conditions and soil pH) with 100 liters of water. To handle the solution easily, take a 10-liter watering can, fill it with water, and add six to 25g of iron sulphate.\nExperts recommend using iron sulphate in dry, calm weather for maximum potency. A little watering post-application aids the soil absorption process, but you might also time your spreading before expected rainfall—though not during heavy showers that could wash the benefits away.\nThe specialists at Moowy note that iron sulphate \"eliminates moss within four days\" of treatment. Once applied, give your lawn some downtime to fully integrate the compound without disturbance, typically several weeks.\nAlso, beware of potential stains from iron sulphate; especially when working near stones, concrete, or pavements where unsightly marks could materialize.\n1",

    "text": "CLEARWATER, Fla. -- A couple who moved to Florida's Gulf Coast this summer after spending years in New Kent, Virginia, are breathing a sigh of relief Thursday after Hurricane Milton crossed the Sunshine State overnight. While the storm brought destruction, flooding, power outages, and a least four deaths, officials said it was not a worst-case scenario. [ ](https://www.wtvr.com/weather/hurricane-milton/florida-spared-from-hurricane-miltons-worst-case-scenario-gov-desantis-says) National News Florida spared from Hurricane Milton's worst-case scenario, DeSantis says \"We just lost power, which is minor, nothing,\" Juli Ranschaert said. \"We bought a generator. So we're good... I think we dodged a bullet with this one.\" Ranschaert, who spoke to CBS 6 ahead of the storm, said she chose not to evacuate because her location is in a higher elevation area of Clearwater, Florida. While other parts of Clearwater became flooded from the over 12 inches of rain that fell, Ranschaert's neighborhood did not. However, her area did sustain wind damage. \"There's multiple trees down, there's multiple roof tiles down, pieces of building or down, fences are down,\" Ranschaert said. \"We tried to go outside and walk on the sidewalks and then through the neighborhoods around us. But I was very close to stepping on a downed power line.\" With the storm now passed, the focus now switches to rescue, recovery, and cleanup across the state, of which several Virginia agencies are helping with. WATCH: She just moved to Florida. Now she's facing another major hurricane: 'It's just very difficult' Virginia Task Force 2, is an urban search and rescue team of over 200 members of the Virginia National Guard, and a Blackhawk helicopter rescue team made up of the guard and Chesterfield Fire members. Around 80 volunteers from Virginia are assisting with the American Red Cross for both Helene and Milton. Kristopher Dumschat, the regional communications manager for the Virginia Red Cross, said they have staged in Tallahassee on the panhandle and are waiting to get cleared to move into the affected areas. \"It allows us to be ready to react and get down into the hard-hit areas of Florida as soon as conditions [warrant] a safe area for our volunteers to go to,\" Dumschat said. Dumschat said they will be working with those who've lost homes with long-term recovery, but in the near future are focused on providing food and shelter to those who evacuated. \"Last night, we had over 83,000 people in evacuation centers across the state of Florida, not just Red Cross, but all evacuation centers,\" Dumschat said. \"So we definitely know there's going to be a lot of individuals that might not have a home to go back to.\" Dumschat said that while the Red Cross is providing that support on the ground, there are ways you can help them with those efforts.

    "title": "Number of Catholic parishes in Baltimore’s core will be halved, archdiocese says",
    "text": "CNA Staff, May 23, 2024 / 14:08 pm (CNA). The Archdiocese of Baltimore announced this week that more than half of the parishes in Baltimore’s historic city core will close or merge as part of a major pastoral planning process. The [final plans,](https://www.archbalt.org/seek-the-city-final-plan/) announced May 22, will see 61 parishes at 59 worship sites in Baltimore City and some nearby areas of Baltimore County reduced to 23 parishes at 30 worship sites. “These decisions, while difficult, are made with an eye toward a future goal of hope,” Archbishop William Lori said in a [video message,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ2-xVWj9Yc) saying the plan was put together, “guided by the Holy Spirit,” with an eye to helping the parishes prioritize announcing the Gospel and helping neighbors in need. The many Catholic churches in Baltimore City were built to serve “a surging population that’s now lost hundreds of thousands of people,” the archdiocese says on the [website](https://www.archbalt.org/seek-the-city-final-plan/) for the initiative. From a high of 1 million people in the 1950s, the population in the city stands at fewer than 570,000 people. According to the archdiocesan publication [Catholic Review,](https://catholicreview.org/final-seek-the-city-plan-released-archdiocese-will-reduce-parishes-in-baltimore-area-by-half/) the 61 current parishes serve approximately 5,000 Catholics — about 1% of the Catholics in the archdiocese, served by 44% of the archdiocese’ current parishes. Lori said the mergers will enable the remaining parishes to “focus on mission and ministry, as opposed to leaking roofs, crumbling walls, and failing electrical and plumbing systems.” After first announcing the intentions for the plan in 2022, this past April the archdiocese [revealed the details of the consolidation plan,](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/257385/baltimore-archdiocese-announces-major-restructuring-that-will-merge-dozens-of-parishes) saying the initiative had “entered its public comment phase.” Several public fora held by the archdiocese on the plan drew “more than 6,000 voices in prayerful listening,” and Lori said their feedback helped to shape the final plans. “We have known for a long time that we could not continue to ignore the decline in Mass attendance and increased resources required to keep up with building and property maintenance,” the archdiocese said. “To achieve the Church we envision, one where parishioners are welcomed, engaged, and constantly growing in faith, and one strengthened by our varied ethnicities, cultures, and backgrounds, we must realign and consolidate our efforts and resources. Our failure to do so would be shortsighted and render us to be poor stewards of the time, talent, and material gifts with which God has blessed us.” According to the Catholic Review, the new configurations and mergers will be complete for most parishes by the first Sunday of Advent 2024, Dec. 1. For others, it could be the first Sunday of Lent 2025, and for some even later. Numerous other large dioceses including [Chicago,](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/250349/chicago-archdiocese-announces-new-groupings-from-parish-mergers) [Pittsburgh](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/43100/pittsburgh-diocese-announces-next-round-of-parish-mergers), [St. Louis,](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/254044/st-louis-catholics-petition-archbishop-to-halt-diocese-wide-parish-merger-plan) and [Cincinnati](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/249802/cincinnati-archdiocese-announces-parish-family-groups-amid-massive-consolidation-effort), and [smaller ones such as Peoria, Illinois](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/257749/peoria-diocese-to-reduce-the-number-of-parishes-in-the-diocese-by-half), have in recent years announced reorganization plans to greatly reduce their number of parishes. Baltimore was [the first Catholic diocese](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/252810/why-baltimore-here-s-the-reason-us-bishops-meet-here-every-year) in the United States, having been established as such in 1789 and elevated to an archdiocese in 1808. The territory of the Diocese of Baltimore originally included the entire fledgling U.S., and it remained the only archdiocese in the country until 1846. Last fall, Lori announced that the Archdiocese of Baltimore would [declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/255520/archdiocese-of-baltimore-files-for-bankruptcy-amid-clergy-sex-abuse-claims) as a result of hundreds of abuse claims against it in recent decades. Lori insisted in his recent video message that the mergers are not related to the bankruptcy and that proceeds from any building sales will remain in the parish, as supported by canon and civil law.

    "title": "Did over 100 mm of rain in an hour lead to Delhi deluge? Why does Capital struggle with flooding?",
    "text": "The rain gods unleashed their fury on India’s capital on Wednesday night (July 31), bringing Delhi and its adjoining areas of National Capital Region to its knees. Heavy rainfall submerged the streets, caused flights to be delayed and even death and destruction came calling. In light of such a situation, the Delhi government announced that all schools would remain shut today — on August 1. Moreover, India’s weatherman, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), has issued a red alert warning, urging citizens to stay at home and avoid travelling. But what caused this rain fury? And how bad is the destruction caused by it? Here’s what we know so far. A cloudburst? On Wednesday evening, Delhi turned into a watery mess after it experienced heavy rainfall in a short period of time. The capital recorded more than a hundred millimetres of rainfall in one hour, leading to waterlogging in several areas of the national capital and prompting the weather office to issue a ‘red’ warning. As per the IMD’s Automatic Weather Station (AWS) network, the Pragati Maidan observatory in central Delhi recorded 112.5 mm of rainfall in one hour. Incidentally, the IMD describes extreme rainfall in a short period of time, specifically 100 mm of rainfall within an hour, as a “cloud burst”. However, officials haven’t termed this rainfall to be the impact of a cloud burst. But then what caused this sudden, heavy rainfall? The IMD around 7 pm on Wednesday said on X: “Clouds have converged over Delhi from all four sectors. Widespread light/moderate rainfall with isolated intense to very intense spell (3-5 cm/hr) likely over Delhi during the next two hours.” Later, the IMD also forecast that the rainy conditions would continue until August 5. A caved in portion of a road near Hauz Khas after heavy rainfall, in New Delhi. PTI How bad was the rainfall? Torrential rainfall unleashed chaos in the national capital on Wednesday, inundating large parts of the city. This led to unending traffic snarls, and people being stranded on roads that resembled rivers. In Ghazipur, located in east Delhi, a woman and her three-year-old son fell into a waterlogged drain and drowned. The police in its report identified the victims as Tanuja and Priyansh, adding that they were out to buy household items when they slipped and fell into the drain. The incident occurred near the Khoda Colony area, where the roadside drain was under construction. According to reports, three others in Gurugram aalso died in the deluge, taking the death toll to five. Police personnel and others during a rescue operation at Sabzi Mandi area after a house collapsed following heavy rainfall, in New Delhi. PTI The heavy rainfall also led to a house collapse in north Delhi’s Sabji Mandi area near Robin Cinema, injuring one person. Authorities also reported a wall collapse in southwest Delhi’s Vasant Kunj, in which a woman was injured. In Pragati Maidan area, officials recorded 112.5 mm of rain within an hour, leading to waterlogging and a mess. The IMD also recorded 79.2 mm of rainfall between 5.30 pm and 8.30 pm at Safdarjung. In the same timeframe, Mayur Vihar saw 119 mm of rainfall, while Delhi University saw 77.5 mm of rainfall, Pusa saw 66.5 mm and Palam recorded 43.7 mm of rainfall. Waterlogging in Lutyens’ Delhi caused bad traffic snarls, with people complaining on social media about the roads and the watery mess. Visuals from many places across Delhi showed vehicles wading through waterlogged roads while traffic police personnel tried to manage vehicular movement. One image shared online also showed rainwater gushing into the Press Club of India, where people were seen sitting in knee-deep water. In other parts of the capital, visuals showed water gushing into showrooms and restaurants. Some parts of Delhi even lost power in the rains, with many residents being forced to sit in darkness for hours. Incidentally, Old Rajinder Nagar, where students were protesting the death of three UPSC aspirants due to flooding in a coaching institute basement, was under knee-deep water. People wade through a waterlogged road during rain at Jangpura area, in New Delhi. PTI The weather also affected air traffic. At least 10 flights scheduled to land at the Delhi airport were diverted — eight to Jaipur and two to Lucknow — due to inclement weather conditions. Airlines also warned of the possibility of more flight disruptions. The downpour and the subsequent water mess prompted Delhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena to ask officers to remain on alert. Meanwhile, Delhi Education Minister Atishi announced that all schools in the city will remain closed on Thursday. “In light of the very heavy rainfall this evening and the forecast of heavy rainfall tomorrow, all schools both government and private will remain closed on August 1,” she posted on X. Why does Delhi struggle with flooding? Wednesday’s rain caught Delhi unaware, as they have been witnessing a dry spell and sweltering heat. However, Wednesday’s rain chaos isn’t new to the capital. Delhi and the surrounding NCR region battles with flooding almost every year. But what is the reason for this mess? Experts note that Wednesday’s rain was torrential and unexpected. It was, as they say, too much, too soon. As per records, parts of the capital saw over 100 mm of rain within an hour. Waterlogging near the Bharat Mandapam during rain, in New Delhi. PTI But it’s not just the unprecedented rain that leads to this flooding. Unchecked and ill-thought-out urban expansion is also a reason for Delhi struggling. According to data from NASA’s Earth Observatory, the geographic size of Delhi almost doubled from 1991 to 2011. However, this expansion hasn’t taken the area’s topography into consideration. Manu Bhatnagar, principal director, Natural Heritage Division, INTACH, explained to Indian Express, “Topography determines drainage patterns. If one looks at Delhi’s historic cities — from Tughlakabad, Mehrauli, and Shahjahanabad to Civil Lines, New Delhi, and the Cantonment area — all were carefully selected, and built on higher ground. In Delhi’s villages too, the centre of the village would always be five to six metres higher than the village periphery.” This allowed rainwater to drain out. But as the city has expanded, not enough thought has gone behind the building with regards to the land’s drainage capacities. A car damaged under the debris of Happy School&#039;s boundary wall that collapsed due to heavy downpour, in Daryaganj area, in Delhi. PTI The constant construction also doesn’t help. Concretisation leaves little room for rainwater to percolate into the soil, leading to flooding. The constant encroachment on the Yamuna floodplains is also to blame for Delhi’s flooding woes. Lakhs of people live on the floodplains of the Yamuna in the city, several of whom have converted the area to agricultural fields to make a livelihood. According to a report by the Centre for Science and Environment, the Yamuna floodplain had over 600 wetlands and waterbodies, but “more than 60 per cent of them are without water, making the city prone to flooding.” The report further states that “the river-fed water bodies in the Yamuna floodplain are disconnected from the river because of embankments.” With inputs from agencies",

    "text": "The AH-64 Apache in the Gulf War: A Game-Changing Platform\nSummary:\nThe AH-64 Apache attack helicopter emerged as one of the most decisive weapons during the Gulf War, significantly contributing to the Coalition victory. Designed to perform in frontline environments, the Apache demonstrated its superior firepower, advanced targeting, and robust survivability against Iraqi forces. It played a critical role in destroying enemy armor, fortifications, and air defenses, showcasing its capabilities in modern warfare. This article delves into the AH-64 Apache’s impact during the Gulf War, examining its contributions and the technological advancements that made it a formidable force on the battlefield.\nThe AH-64 Apache: An Introduction\nThe AH-64 Apache is an advanced multi-role combat helicopter designed primarily for destroying tanks, armored vehicles, and other ground targets while offering counter-air defense capabilities. Produced by Boeing Defense, Space & Security, its maiden flight occurred in September 1975, leading to its introduction to the U.S. Army in 1986. Equipped with a tandem cockpit, state-of-the-art avionics, and integrated weapons systems, the Apache was a leap forward in rotary-wing aircraft technology.\nDeployment in the Gulf War\nDuring Operation Desert Storm, the Gulf War of 1991, the AH-64 Apache was deployed by the United States Army with significant effectiveness. It was its first operational test in a significant conflict, and the Apache quickly proved itself as a critical asset in the Coalition’s arsenal.\nKey Roles and Missions\nThe AH-64 Apache undertook various missions, including:\n– Deep Strike Operations: Conducting long-range missions to destroy high-value targets and disrupt enemy supply lines.\n– Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD): Neutralizing Iraqi radar and SAM sites, paving the way for Coalition air forces.\n– Close Air Support (CAS): Providing direct support to Coalition ground troops engaged with Iraqi forces.\n– Eradication of Armored Threats: Hunting and destroying Iraq’s formidable tank forces, which were considered a significant threat.\nTechnological Superiority\nThe Apache’s advanced technology, including its Target Acquisition Designation Sight (TADS) and Pilot Night Vision System (PNVS), allowed for precision targeting day or night. The Hellfire missile system, in particular, was instrumental in the destruction of enemy tanks and armored vehicles.\nImpact and Aftermath\nThe AH-64’s performance during the Gulf War validated its design and led to its continued use in subsequent conflicts. Its success also influenced other nations to consider the Apache or similar platforms for their own military needs.\nFAQ:\nQ: How many AH-64 Apaches were used in the Gulf War?\nA: The U.S. Army deployed around 300 AH-64 Apaches during the conflict.\nQ: Did the Apache suffer any losses during the Gulf War?\nA: Yes, but losses were limited, which testified to the Apache’s survivability and effectiveness in combat.\nQ: What were the primary armaments used by the Apache during the Gulf War?\nA: The Apache was equipped with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, Hydra 70 rocket pods, and an M230 chain gun.\nQ: How has the performance of the AH-64 Apache in the Gulf War influenced modern military strategy?\nA: The Apache’s success underscored the importance of advanced reconnaissance and precision strike capabilities, shaping modern aerial warfare doctrine.\nSources:\nFor more comprehensive information on the AH-64 Apache and its use during the Gulf War, readers can visit the official websites of Boeing\nwww.boeing.com and the U.S. Army www.army.mil.\nThis article has been compiled through research and existing knowledge; any factual reporting or analysis has been sourced from the referenced official domains.
