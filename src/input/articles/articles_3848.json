Mike Thompson (D-Calif).\nTheir calls came a day after Congress paused for a moment of silence, to honor the 49 people who died in the Pulse Nightclub shooting in 2016. Wednesday marked eight years since the shooting.\nOn Tuesday, high school graduates in Newtown, Connecticut remembered the 20 classmates who didn’t graduate, because they died in the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012.\n“I do feel like, for the first time, the gun violence prevention movement is stronger than the gun lobby,” said Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.).\nMeanwhile, last month, former president Donald Trump spoke at the NRA convention, encouraging voters who care about gun rights to vote this November.\n“Let there be no doubt: the survival of our Second Amendment is very much on the ballot,” Trump said. “If the Biden regime gets four more years, they are coming for your guns.”\nDemocrats believe public opinion is on their side about this issue.",

    "text": "The Israeli hammering continues. For one more day Israeli forces struck southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah facilities. At the same time, the Lebanese organization tried for the first time to attack Tel Aviv.\nAccording to what has become known, he launched a missile aimed at Mossad headquarters, but Israel managed to shoot it down. Hezbollah’s arsenal is impressive to non-experts, especially since the Israelis claim to have inflicted heavy damage on it.\nHowever, the strikes of the Israelis are not enough for this many are those who consider that we are close to a total war.\nHezbollah’s underground arsenal Hezbollah reportedly has an underground arsenal and last month released footage that appeared to show its fighters driving trucks with rocket launchers through tunnels, according to two sources who spoke to Reuters.\nHezbollah’s arsenal reportedly includes about 150,000 rockets, the US congressional report said. The Lebanese organization has been building a network of tunnels for years which, according to Israeli calculations, stretches for hundreds of kilometers.\nThe Israeli military said Monday’s airstrikes hit Hezbollah rocket launchers under houses in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah has in the past stressed that it does not place military infrastructure near civilians.\nConfirmed details of the tunnel network remain scant. A 2021 report by Alma, the Israeli think tank specializing in Hezbollah, said Iran and North Korea helped build the tunnel network after the 2006 war.\nIsrael is sending more reserve brigades to the border with Lebanon Israel is deploying two more reserve brigades to its northern border for operational activities, the military said today after days of escalating airstrikes against Hezbollah targets in various parts of Lebanon.\n“This will enable the continuation of the fight against the terrorist organization Hezbollah, the defense of the State of Israel, and create the conditions for the residents of northern Israel to return to their homes,” the army said in a statement.\nIsraeli media reported, moreover, that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is calling a meeting of the Council of Ministers for 20:00 Greek time.\nThe pounding of Israel continues, the dead are increasing The Israeli military announced today that it hit more than 280 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, from where the Islamist group fires rockets into Israeli territory.\nAfter “several missiles” were fired from Lebanon “by the Hezbollah terrorist organization” the military “hit the launchers used” for those attacks as well as “other terrorist targets,” the statement said. In total, “more than 280 Hezbollah terrorist targets” were hit, according to the military.\nMeanwhile, Lebanon’s health ministry said 23 people were killed today in Israeli raids on various communities, some of them in mountainous areas outside Hezbollah strongholds, as the Israeli military says it continues “large-scale” shelling.\nSOURCE: APE-ME, REUTERS\n#Lebanon #Hezbollahs #hidden #weapons #Israel #Death #toll #rises",

    "title": "AI Health Advice: Risks & My Grok3 Experience",
    "text": "AI Health Advice: Proceed with caution Published: June 12, 2025\nThe increasing use of AI chatbots raises concerns about the accuracy of health data provided. The Allure of AI and the Quest for Information The digital age has fostered a culture of instant access to information. For many, notably those with a strong interest in technology, exploring new tools and platforms is a natural inclination. We’re constantly seeking ways to optimize our lives, both professionally and personally, and AI chatbots present themselves as potential solutions. Though, this enthusiasm must be tempered with a healthy dose of skepticism, especially when dealing with sensitive topics like health and wellness.\nRecent data indicates a notable rise in the use of AI chatbots for health-related inquiries. A survey conducted by Statista in early 2025 showed that 32% of adults in the US have used an AI chatbot to ask about health concerns, up from just 8% the previous year. This trend highlights the growing reliance on these tools, but also underscores the need for critical evaluation of the information they provide.\nThe Problem with AI-Generated Health Information While AI chatbots excel at processing and presenting information, their understanding of nuance and context is often limited. This can lead to inaccurate, incomplete, or even harmful advice. The issue isn’t necessarily malicious intent, but rather the inherent limitations of the technology. AI models are trained on vast datasets, and if those datasets contain biases or inaccuracies, the AI will inevitably reflect them.\nConsider the analogy of a highly skilled translator who doesn’t fully grasp the cultural context of the language they’re translating. They might produce a grammatically correct translation, but it could still be misleading or inappropriate. Similarly, an AI chatbot might provide a technically accurate response to a health query, but fail to account for individual circumstances or the latest medical research.\nThis is particularly evident with newer models. As one observer noted, “So far, it looks like Grok 3 enjoys getting pretty weird with Health & wellness info… “. This observation points to a concerning tendency for some AI models to generate unconventional or unsubstantiated health recommendations.\nA Case Study: Grok 3 and Questionable Advice Recent experiences with Grok 3, a prominent AI chatbot, have highlighted the potential dangers of relying on AI for health information. Users have reported receiving responses that range from unhelpful to outright bizarre. For example, some users seeking advice on managing anxiety were given suggestions based on pseudoscientific theories or outdated practices.\nThe core issue is that AI chatbots are not qualified medical professionals. They lack the training, experience, and ethical obligations of doctors and other healthcare providers. They cannot diagnose illnesses, prescribe medications, or provide personalized treatment plans.\nAs a cautionary tale, it’s crucial to remember that “You Might Want To Take Any AI’s Health Info With A Little Salt: “. This sentiment is crucial, especially given the increasing sophistication of AI and its ability to present information in a convincing manner.\nnavigating the AI landscape Responsibly The rise of AI chatbots doesn’t mean we should dismiss the technology entirely. They can be valuable tools for general information gathering and preliminary research. Though, it’s essential to approach AI-generated health information with a critical eye.\nAlways verify information obtained from AI chatbots with a trusted healthcare professional. Consult yoru doctor, pharmacist, or other qualified medical provider before making any decisions about your health or treatment. Remember that AI is a tool, not a replacement for human expertise and judgment.\nmoreover, be aware of the limitations of AI. Don’t rely on chatbots for emergency medical advice. If your experiencing a medical emergency, seek immediate attention from a qualified healthcare provider.\nThis article provides general information and should not be considered medical advice.Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.",
