    "text": "首页/\n城市/\n新政/\n经济/\n社会/\n文化/\n体育+/\n科教卫\n杭州日报讯 《2024年度浙江青年献血白皮书》近日发布，统计数据显示，2024年度全省18至35周岁青年献血总人次达38.41万，全省青年献血总人次占全省总献血人次的48.37%。\n青年成为无偿献血的“主力军”，这样的青春风采让人感动和敬佩。血液是生命之源，无偿献血对于拯救生命、守护健康有着无可替代的重要意义。青年本身就处于身体最强健的年龄，再加上他们普遍拥有强烈的使命感和责任感，自然就成了无偿献血的主要力量。\n青年积极参与无偿献血，有助于吸引更多的人加入到无偿献血的队伍。青年朝气蓬勃，他们参与无偿献血，等于用实际行动向周围的人宣传普及了无偿献血的知识。特别是在校大学生，这是一个庞大的青年群体，他们也善于运用新的传播方式，宣传推广无偿献血这一充满爱心的公益行为。这也彰显了当代青年无私奉献、守望相助的高尚情怀。\n要鼓励更多的居民特别是青年加入到无偿献血的队伍中来，还需要完善对无偿献血者的激励制度。为进一步鼓励广大青年参与无偿献血工作，2018年，浙江推出“热血先锋”养成计划这一志愿服务公益活动。根据这一计划，青年在一定年限内无偿献血达到一定数量，可以获得相应的荣誉称号，并享受部分公园、旅游景区免门票待遇。这样的激励内容非常实在。此外，对于无偿献血者来说，最重要的激励内容可能就是他们本人及亲属可以减免临床用血费用。这样的好措施不妨进一步简化落实，更好地保障无偿献血者的权利。\n捐献可再生的血液，挽救不可再生的生命。无偿献血者用实际行动献上了爱心，全社会在向他们致以敬意和表达感谢的同时，也应当给予他们更多优待和关怀。这是中华民族知恩图报的传统美德，也能形成爱心善举的双向流动，提升无偿献血者的荣誉感，吸引鼓励更多的人加入到无偿献血的队伍中。当每一位无偿献血者都得到尊重，更多的热血才能汇聚起来，支撑更多的生命奔向美好的明天。",

    "text": "28/12/2023 - 20:46 O número de mortes violentas na Venezuela caiu cerca de 25% em 2023, estimadas em 6.973, segundo um relatório apresentado nesta quinta-feira (28) pela ONG Observatório Venezuelano da Violência (OVV), que serve de referência diante da falta de estatísticas oficiais. “Esses números representam uma mudança na tendência recente […] A taxa de 26,8 mortes violentas por 100.000 habitantes é uma importante redução de 8,5 pontos em relação às registradas durante 2021 e 2022, que ficaram em 34,9 e 35,3”, informa o relatório do OVV. No entanto, segundo esse estudo baseado principalmente em casos publicados na imprensa, a Venezuela continua sendo um dos países mais violentos da América Latina. Do total de 6.973 mortes violentas registradas pelo OVV em 2023, 1.956 foram homicídios, 953 ocorreram durante operações policiais e 4.064 estão sob investigação. Em 2022, o número total ficou em 9.367 em 2022 e em 9.447 em 2021. Esses números não incluem desaparecimentos, que o OVV estimou em 1.443 em 2023, frente aos 1.370 de 2022 e 1.634 de 2021. Este país sul-americano de 30 milhões de habitantes vem registrando uma importante diminuição no número de mortes violentas desde 2016, quando o OVV contabilizou 28.479 óbitos desse tipo, em meio a uma enorme emigração, a uma grave crise econômica e à pandemia de covid-19. “Há uma acentuação dos efeitos do que vinham ocorrendo”, disse à AFP Roberto Briceño-León, diretor do OVV, para quem o crescimento de facções do crime organizado “monopolizou” a violência diante da debilidade do Estado e, com isso, a letalidade da criminalidade diminuiu. “A redução das mortes violentas não significa necessariamente uma diminuição da criminalidade, mas sim uma mudança da criminalidade”, destacou. A média mundial de homicídios é de 5,8 por 100.000 habitantes (15 a cada 100.000 nas Américas), de acordo com o último relatório do Escritório das Nações Unidas contra a Droga e o Crime (UNODC, na sigla em inglês). erc/jt/dg/dd/mvv/rpr",

(Bernama pic) PETALING JAYA: Selangor’s Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah has reminded non-Muslims to respect and refrain from interfering in matters relating to Islamic affairs. Sultan Sharafuddin was responding to a proposal by Beruas MP Ngeh Koo Ham to include non-Muslim constitutional experts in a committee studying the conflicts between shariah laws and the Federal Constitution. ADVERTISEMENT “His Majesty hopes that politicians, especially non-Muslims, refrain from continuously interfering in Islamic matters. “Instead, non-Muslims should emulate Muslims, who do not interfere in the religious affairs of other faiths in Malaysia,” the ruler said in a post on the Selangor Royal Office’s Facebook page today.

Sultan Sharafuddin said he also took note of DAP secretary-general Loke Siew Fook’s statement on the matter. ADVERTISEMENT Earlier today, Loke sought to downplay the controversy stemming from Ngeh’s proposal. He said the party is not trying to interfere in Islamic affairs, and also clarified Ngeh’s comments on the authority behind the setting up of the committee, while saying that any recommendations which involve amendments to the law must be brought to the Cabinet. ADVERTISEMENT He said non-Muslims need not be concerned about the composition of the committee as any legal amendment involving the rights of non-Muslims must be scrutinised and decided by the Cabinet before following the “usual parliamentary process”.

Upgrading this 19th century plant was our top priority.\"\nA grant exceeding Rs7?billion financed the rehabilitation of aging tanks, modernization of filtration systems, and replacement of transmission pipelines - tripling water output for urban and peri-urban areas.\nManaging Director WASA Aamer Aziz, represented by Deputy Managing Director Engineering Saqib Raza, praised the collaboration.\n\"Learning from Japanese engineers has elevated our technical expertise,\" Raza said. \"This facility now delivers clean water directly to more than 200,000 Faisalabad residents. The Punjab government's timely funding release was crucial to meeting project milestones.\"\nJICA's Resident Representative, Naoaki Miyata, emphasised the facility's impact on public health and sustainable development.\n\"This project advances SDG 6ensuring clean water and sanitation for all,\" he noted.\n\"We remain committed to technical cooperation that secures safe water supplies and bolsters local capacity.\"\nProject Director Ali Ahmed traced the project timeline: in March 2022 WASA established a project management unit; by year-end JICA had selected consultants and pre-qualified contractors; technical and financial bids concluded in mid-2023.\nTo align costs with loan parameters, WASA revised the project scopereducing treatment capacity from 8?MGD to 5?MGD and shortening the maintenance phase. The revised PC-1 received provincial approval in January 2025, paving the way for this month's inauguration.\nThe ceremony concluded with Ambassador Akamatsu unveiling a commemorative plaque and touring the revamped plant.\nAttendees included Deputy Managing Director Admin Shoaib Rashid.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
