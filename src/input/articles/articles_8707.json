    "text": "The Richmond RCMP Bike Patrol Unit has been in the city centre area during the holiday season, resulting in arrests and tickets. While out and about, they arrested a man allegedly stealing clothes and other items at a mall and another man who allegedly damaged a store door. They also arrested an “extremely intoxicated man” and investigated a domestic disturbance. Over the holiday, bike patrol officers also found and arrested people in Richmond who had outstanding warrants and gave out tickets to drivers. According to RCMP, they have also been helping people who are in mental distress and have been able to patrol areas with a “high concentration of the unhoused.” “Many of the businesses and members of the community have provided feedback on the presence of Bike Patrol officers in the area,” said Staff Sgt. Paul Maan. “It has been overwhelmingly positive. Their unique capabilities and flexibility are unmatched in the urban environment.” Bike patrol officers can move “quickly and quietly, covering greater distances than on foot,” explained Richmond RCMP media spokesperson Cpl. Adriana O’Malley. “Their stealthy nature often lends to the element of surprise with criminals not noticing them,” she added. Many officers bring extensive experience from other sections within the RCMP, O’Malley explained. “This includes knowing many of the offenders by appearance and name,” she said. “They are keenly focusing on the downtown core of Richmond and areas along Bridgeport Road corridor to arrest criminals, deter suspicious activity and safeguard the community.” Help prevent crime: Police RCMP are asking the public to take precautions to prevent crime: - Lock your vehicle doors. Sounds simple. It takes less than a second to do so. It’s the first thing thieves do when they are on the prowl. It also takes them less than a second to check. - ’Tis the season to be shopping. Keep your valuables out of sight. If you can see them, thieves can as well. - Report any suspicious activity. Your eyes and ears are some of the greatest crime fighting tools available.

    "text": "Antonio La Camera • Director of The Lost Memories of Trees\n“Being immersed in the Amazon was an inner journey to discover my limits and my strengths”\n- The Italian director participated in Playlab’s 2022 Creators Lab with Apichatpong Weerasethakul, where he shot his Venice-awarded short film\nItalian director Antonio La Camera participated in\nPlaylab Films’ Apichatpong Weerasethakul Creators Lab: Filming in the Amazon in 2022 (see the news), which took filmmakers and creatives to the Peruvian Amazon rainforest during ten days to develop a short film each. His effort, The Lost Memories of Trees, was one of the 15 selected by Playlab in order to support their international distribution, and was subsequently chosen for the 38th International Film Critics’ Week at last year’s Venice Film Festival, winning the Award for Best Short in the section.\nCineuropa: How did the rich cultural heritage of the Peruvian Amazon and the influence of this specific culture inspire or impact your creative process during the Playlab Films workshop?\nAntonio La Camera: Being immersed in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest was a great opportunity for me to reconnect with myself. More than being influenced by the local culture in the conventional sense, for me it was an inner journey to discover my limits and my strengths, in a great dialogue with the nature around us, which, in the Amazon, has a huge spiritual force and a unique atmosphere.\nHaving grown up in Italy, in the countryside, the relationship with nature has always been something that has really belonged to me, and finding myself immersed in the Amazon rainforest was a bit like a return to a home to which you belong, but which is, at the same time, different and new. I will never forget the starry night sky of the forest while the screeches of distant animals filled the air, creating an atmosphere that was earthly and alien at the same time. These are all suggestions that I tried to convey in my short film and which inspired me greatly.\nCan you share some insights or key learnings from working with the famous director who led this year's workshop, and how did these experiences contribute to the development of your film?\nCertainly, what I still carry with me from the workshop and from the teachings of a master like Apichatpong is having understood that to make a film, you have to take one step at a time. You have to have faith in the process, live very much in the present, and even the things that seem the most difficult and impossible will find a way to come true. Having ten days to conceive a film, write it, cast it, choose the locations, shoot it and then edit it would seem like something impossible or restrictive, but if you have faith in the process and are able to listen to what is happening outside and inside you, limitations can become strengths, and the possibilities multiply.\nPresenting your film at the Venice Film Festival is a significant achievement. How did the intensive, ten-day workshop at Playlab Films prepare you for this milestone, and what feedback or reactions did you receive at the festival?\nThe presentation at Venice was a very important moment for me because it was the first time I saw the film finished in a theatre with hundreds of people. For me, it is important that films are not just films, but that they can aspire to become pure cinema - that is, to access an experiential dimension that embraces narrative and audiovisual form in order to create a true sensory journey. And of course, the movie theatre is the perfect place to create this dimension. So, at Venice, I was able to watch the film exactly as I hoped it would be, and the feedback from those in the theatre was very positive and emotional. So, it was proof that regardless of whether you like it or not, the film managed to get somewhere inside the viewer, and that for me is the most important thing.\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

    "title": "Pope encourages Ukraine to show ‘white flag’ courage in negotiations - World News",
    "text": "Pope encourages Ukraine to show ‘white flag’ courage in negotiations Story highlights Pope Francis emphasised a different perspective, stating that true strength lies in considering the well-being of the people and having the courage to negotiate. Pope Francis said that Ukraine should demonstrate what he referred to as the 'courage of the white flag' and engage in negotiations to end the ongoing conflict with Russia, which began with Moscow's full-scale invasion two years ago and has resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of lives. In a recent interview with Swiss broadcaster RSI, Pope Francis expressed his view on Russia-Ukraine war by engaging in negotiations to end the war with Russia. The interview took place last month, predating Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's recent offer to host a summit between Ukraine and Russia to seek a resolution to the conflict. During the interview, Pope Francis responded to a question about the ongoing debate over whether Ukraine should surrender, given its challenges in repelling Russian forces. The term white flag was used in the question to describe a potential surrender. While acknowledging this interpretation, Pope Francis emphasised a different perspective, stating that true strength lies in considering the well-being of the people and having the courage to negotiate. He stressed the importance of international involvement in facilitating these talks. In his remarks, the Pope suggested that negotiating is a courageous act, especially when faced with adversity. He encouraged timely negotiations to prevent further escalation of the conflict, mentioning Turkey among the countries that could offer mediation. Last year the 87-year-old pope sent a peace envoy, Italian Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, to Kyiv, Moscow and Washington to sound out leaders in those countries. This interview marked the first time Pope Francis used terms such as white flag or defeated in discussing the Ukraine war. He reiterated the need for negotiations and expressed a willingness to mediate if required. In another part of the interview, Pope Francis drew a parallel to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, emphasising that negotiating should never be seen as surrender. The Ukrainian leader's own peace plan calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops from all of Ukraine and the restoration of its state borders. The Kremlin has ruled out engaging in peace talks on terms set by Kyiv. A spokesman for Volodymyr Zelensky did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the pope's remarks.

    "text": "El sorpresivo reclamo de los trabajadores sobre la Inteligencia Artificial La IA está revolucionan muchos sectores y, en materia laboral, propone grandes desafíos. Si bien puede generar pérdidas de empleos, también ofrece beneficios para los trabajadores El mundo del trabajo está cambiando cada vez más rápido y la llegada de la [inteligencia artificial](https://www.mdzol.com/temas/inteligencia-artificial-3428.html) genera un fuerte desafío en los trabajadores, pero también en las empresas. No todas las compañías se actualizan de la misma manera ante las nuevas tendencias y la incorporación de empleados jóvenes la ponen a prueba respecto a su capacidad para adaptarse a las nuevas corrientes. Un estudio realizado en 15 mercados, incluido Argentina, que indaga sobre la IA y su impacto en el [mercado laboral](https://www.mdzol.com/temas/mercado-laboral-13239.html), reveló que la relación empleador-empleado no siempre está alineados ante los desafíos que imponen las nuevas tecnologías. Randstad, la compañía de búsqueda de talentos a nivel global, presentó los resultados del informe Escasez de Talento, IA y Equidad. De ese trabajo surge que el 41% de los trabajadores argentinos considera que su empleador está retrasado en la adopción de IA y el 47% cree que su empleador podría obtener más beneficios con un mayor uso de la IA en el lugar de trabajo. Al profundizar en el último punto, se remarca que el 47% de los trabajadores considera que la empresa en la que trabaja podría sacar mayor provecho del uso de la IA, mientras que el 29% se mantiene en una posición neutral y el 24% no percibe beneficios potenciales en una mayor adopción de la IA por parte de su empleador. \"La IA está transformando muchas de las tareas que cotidianamente se realizan en el marco del trabajo, generando un impacto creciente en la forma en que trabajamos, en las habilidades que las organizaciones demandan y en las necesidades de formación que requiere la fuerza laboral. En este contexto de cambio, en el que la escasez de talento se agudiza, es necesario asegurar el acceso equitativo a las habilidades, los recursos y las oportunidades para evitar la creación de nuevas brechas\", señala el informe. Sobre este contexto, Andrea Ávila, CEO de Randstad para Argentina, Chile y Uruguay, afirmó que \"la inteligencia artificial llegó para quedarse y su uso cada vez es más común en el ámbito laboral, ya sea porque las organizaciones la impulsan o porque los trabajadores se interesan por el fenómeno y experimentan con las nuevas herramientas. En un contexto de escasez estructural de talento, con brechas de adopción que ya se perciben, tenemos que tomar medidas activas para abordar la formación de la fuerza laboral en habilidades digitales y de IA para que las desigualdades y las brechas de acceso no hagan más crítica la escasez de talento en todo el mundo”. De esta forma, el 51% de los trabajadores en Argentina cree que la IA hará más fácil su trabajo; mientras el 24% no considera que facilitará sus labores y el 25% mantiene una posición neutral. Por su parte, el 48% de los trabajadores cree que la IA hará su trabajo más interesante; mientras que el 26% no considera que la IA vaya a hacer sus tareas más interesantes y el 27% de los encuestados en Argentina toma una posición neutra al respecto. Por su parte, el Grupo Adecco, empresa en consultoría integral en Recursos Humanos, indagó acerca del impacto de la Inteligencia Artificial en el ámbito laboral, analizando los primeros indicios de aumento de la eficiencia gracias a la IA. Para esto, se encuestó a 35.000 trabajadores de todo el mundo, incluyendo a 1.000 argentinos. El dato importante que se vio reflejado en el estudio es que el ahorro promedio para los trabajadores que utilizan IA es de 1 hora al día, aunque una quinta parte de los usuarios afirmó que la tecnología les ahorraba hasta 2 horas al día. El 5% afirmó que les ahorraba entre 3 y 4 horas al día. El ahorro de tiempo parece consistente y homogéneo en todos los sectores. El área de energía, servicios públicos y tecnologías limpias reportó el mayor ahorro de tiempo con 75 minutos al día, mientras que en el sector aeroespacial y defensa el ahorro es menor, con 52 minutos. Los trabajadores de tecnología, servicios financieros y manufactura ahorran entre 57 y 66 minutos.
