    "title": "Australian Islamic Preacher Omar Najjarine: Jews Cursed by Allah | MEMRI",
    "text": "Australian Islamic preacher Omar Najjarine said in a December 1, 2023, Friday sermon at the Sydney Roselands Mosque, which was streamed live on the mosque's YouTube channel, that the Israelis feel superior to the Arabs. He claimed that in contrast, the many Jewish settlers in all the Muslim countries are happy to live under Muslim rule. Najjarine continued to say that Allah has warned the Muslims about the Israelites in the Quran many times, that they have \"always been a problem,\" and he asked: \"What is your expectation from people that Allah has told you they are cursed?\" Omar Najjarine: \"Arabs to the Israelis are like nothing. [They say], 'We are superior.' And we [Arabs] are nothing. Mind you to say, there are thousands of Jewish communities in the world that live in Muslim lands. There are Jewish communities in Yemen, in Iran, in Iraq, in Lebanon, parts of Africa, and probably in any Muslim country in the world, you would find pockets, communities of Jewish settlers in these countries, that have no fear of where they are living. If anything, they are happy to be under the rule and protection of the Muslims. This is how it has been for hundreds of years. \"What we see today [in Israel] is different, and people are asking, 'Why? Why? Why?' This is who they are. Allah told us about the Israelites so many times in the Quran. This is the children of Israel—this is the Israelites. Allah has warned us over and over about them. He has told us they have killed prophets and messengers because they didnt like them. Allah told us how they disobeyed Moses. The Israelites have always been a problem. They have broken their covenant with Allah over and over and over again. This is why you find Orthodox Jews standing with Palestine. When is it [found], in any history, that the so-called other side is standing against their own selves? Jews—Orthodox Jews—that understand that Allah banished them from the Land of Israel, from this land, because they disobeyed Allah. \"What is your expectation from people that Allah has told that they are cursed? They cannot fight a people who love death more than they love life. This is the key. Why are there so many verses [in the Quran] and chapters even about the Israelites? Because Allah is teaching you about who they are. Because there will be many days to come, when these people will cause strife, corruption, and evil on this earth.\"",

    "title": "Arsenal perde em casa para o West Ham e deixa escapar a liderança isolada do Inglês - Bem Paraná",
    "text": "O Arsenal decepcionou a sua torcida nesta quinta-feira ao ser derrotado em seu estádio por 2 a 0 pelo West Ham, no encerramento da 19ª rodada do Campeonato Inglês. O tropeço custou caro, já que o revés tirou a chance de o time do técnico Mikel Arteta assumir a liderança da competição. Na classificação, a diferença para o líder Liverpool é agora de dois pontos (40 a 42). O West Ham festejou o triunfo e também a posição na classificação. Os visitantes somam 33 pontos e aparecem no sexto posto, logo atrás do Tottenham, que também perdeu seu compromisso na rodada. As duas equipes voltam a jogar pelo torneio no próximo final de semana. O Arsenal vai tentar a reabilitação visitando o Fulham no domingo. Na terça-feira, o West Ham recebe o Brighton no estádio Olímpico de Londres. O resultado surpreendente começou a ser construído ainda no início do primeiro tempo. Jarrod Bowen faz uma bela assistência para Tomas Soucek, que teve frieza para dominar e chutar forte: 1 a 0, aos 13 minutos. Com a necessidade de virar o jogo e a pressão da torcida, a partida foi ficando dramática. O West Ham perdeu Lucas Paquetá com 30 minutos de confronto. A baixa obrigou a equipe visitante a se fechar ainda mais a fim de segurar a vantagem. Com mais volume de jogo, mas sem ser efetivo, o Arsenal foi para o intervalo sem conseguir o empate. Quem esperava uma pressão total da equipe de Mikel Arteta desde o início, acabou se surpreendendo. O West Ham se aproveitou de uma bola aérea e fez o que poucos acreditavam: aumentou a vantagem para 2 a 0 em cabeçada de Mavropanos. A bola ainda bateu no travessão antes de entrar, aos 10 minutos. O Arsenal foi para cima, criou seguidas chances, mas pecou nas finalizações. Em dois lances praticamente seguidos, Gabriel Jesus perdeu dois gols na pequena área. No primeiro cabeceio, Aréola defendeu. Na segunda oportunidade, o camisa nove cabeceou por cima. O tempo passou a ser mais um adversário e o Arsenal não conseguiu se organizar diante de um rival retrancado. Ödegaard ainda teve outra chance em cabeçada nos acréscimos mas parou no goleiro. O pior quase aconteceu no último lance do jogo com um pênalti anotado para o West Ham. David Raya, no entanto, conseguiu defender a cobrança de Benrahma garantindo a derrota de 2 a 0.",

    "text": "The U.S. Department of Justice sent a letter to Texas Governor Greg Abbott saying if the state enforces a new border control law, it will sue.\nThe law allows state police to arrest anyone suspected of illegally crossing the border.\nThe ACLU sued Texas the day after Gov. Abbott signed it into law, and now it appears the Biden administration is threatening a lawsuit as well.\nAt the start of next year, state police will be allowed to arrest anyone they suspect crossed into Texas illegally.\nFeatured\nThe law makes crossing the border without using a port of entry a Class B misdemeanor. Migrants will be given the choice between returning to Mexico or facing a potential six-month jail sentence.\nIn its letter to Gov. Abbott, the DOJ said only the federal government can enforce immigration laws. It cited a 2012 Supreme Court decision that rejected a similar law in Arizona.\nMORE: Border Security News Coverage\nBut Abbott has claimed the federal government isn’t doing its part to control the flow of migrants into U.S. He re-affirmed that statement on Twitter shortly after the letter was sent, claiming the U.S. refuses to enforce current immigration laws.\nAdditionally, the president of Mexico has said his government also plans to challenge the law.\nAnother border policy enacted by Texas, involving floating barriers in the Rio Grande, has already been challenged by the Biden administration.",

The contract, secured by Teamsters Local 120, includes a 30 percent wage increase, expanded vacation time, increased pension contributions, and Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a paid holiday. The new agreement also includes strong strike protections and new language to guard against job loss from automation.\n\"We made it clear to Sysco we were ready to walk if they didn't come to the table with a fair contract,\" said Andy Ketcher , a Sysco driver and Local 120 steward. \"Because we stood together, we won a deal that rewards our hard work and gives us the respect we deserve.\"\nSysco is one of the largest and most profitable food service companies in the United States . In 2024, it reported $1.95 billion in net profits — up more than 10 percent from the year prior. Just days before the deal, Local 120 members voted unanimously to authorize a strike , pressuring Sysco to return with a contract that reflects its record profits.\n\"This is a huge win for our members and their families,\" said Brandon Brink , a Local 120 business agent. \"Our members stood tall and didn't back down in the face of corporate greed. That solidarity delivered real results.\"\nTeamsters Local 120 proudly represents over 15,000 workers in Wisconsin , Minnesota , Iowa , North Dakota , and South Dakota .

He will also strengthen capacities of national governments and regional organizations towards effective implementation of the 2024-2027 IPBES work plan.\nAn applied ecologist and associate professor at the University of Khartoum, Sudan, Ahmed brings his unmatched interdisciplinary perspective to his role at IPBES, including participation in facilitating workshops in the IPBES fellowship programme; training and familiarization programme; youth workshops; dialogues with governments and stakeholders; support for uptake of IPBES assessments; communities of practice; IPBES capacity-building forum; and encouragement of national science-policy platforms/networks and assessments.\nBeing a member of such a group of highly selected and world-class scientists and practitioners is not an easy job and indeed requires a multitude of characteristics, all of which Ahmed has. His expertise in areas of ecological monitoring and global change ecology made him a perfect fit for this task force, in addition to his active initiatives on science diplomacy, young scientist mentoring and empowerment, and service as capacity-building advisor/consultant to many developmental organizations in Africa.\nOverall, Ahmed is hoping that his work in the next three years with his colleagues and stakeholders at IPBES will not only enhance personal and institutional capacities worldwide – especially in developing countries – but also spread knowledge about environmental stewardship to ultimately contribute to biodiversity conservation and human wellbeing in a sustainable manner.\nContent Tags:",

    "text": "A cyclist in a rain poncho pedals along Arch Street on a rainy morning earlier this month. It hasn't rained around here since March 9, and that's about to change. Read more Alejandro A. Alvarez / Staff Photographer by Anthony R. Wood Updated Mar. 22, 2024, 5:25 p.m. ET | Published Mar. 22, 2024, 12:45 p.m. ET A flood watch is in effect for the entire region for the first weekend of spring for soaking downpours that were expected to result in the rainiest March day in 150 years of record-keeping in Philadelphia.\nA potent storm that will drench the I-95 corridor from Washington to Boston is forecast to generate widespread heavy rains, with up to 4 inches in and around Philly, from late Friday night or early Saturday into Saturday evening, the National Weather Service says. The heaviest rain is expected late Saturday morning and in the afternoon.\nThe flood watch is in place from 4 a.m. Saturday until 8 a.m. Sunday. Some stream flooding could occur and power outages are “possible,” the weather service says, with winds forecast to gust to 45 mph Saturday night at the Shore and 40 mph inland.\nLate Friday the storm appeared destined to follow a track right along the coast that would put the I-95 corridor in the bull’s-eye of the heaviest rain, said Eric Hoeflich, a meteorologist with the weather service’s Mount Holly office.\nAdvertisement » READ MORE: Spring is a volatile season, and it can affect your health\nA wild card would be the development of a corridor of very heavy rain, where 4 inches or more could fall. “That’s going to be a nowcast situation,” said the weather service’s Joe DeSilva. In other words, we won’t know until it happens.\nThe record for precipitation for any March day in Philadelphia is 2.79 inches, set in 1912. The record for March 23 is 1.36 inches, set in 2005.\nThe warm Atlantic, not to mention El Niño The storm, tracking from the South, will be feeding off two generous moisture supplies, said Dave Dombek, senior meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc.\n“It’s tapping into some pretty moist air that’s across the Southeast,” he said. As is typical during El Niño events, when the water temperatures over vast expanses of the tropical Pacific are well above normal and affect upper-air patterns, storm tracks across the southern United States become active.\n» READ MORE: With El Niño, forecasters said big coastal storms were possible\nRainfall in the Southeast was well above average during the winter and has left a moist legacy in the air, said Dombek. The weather service said the storm will tap into “deep tropical moisture.”\nPlus, with its onshore winds, on Saturday the storm will be importing moisture from the Atlantic, where sea-surface temperatures also are substantially above normal. “There’s some really juicy air, and almost borderline tropical air offshore,” said Dombek.\nThe potential impacts It’s possible that some streams could slosh over, and urban street flooding is very likely, the weather service says.\nScattered power outages are in play as the ground becomes saturated.\nFortunately, most of the trees aren’t yet weighted down with leaves, and that lessens the potential for tree damage, as winds can sail through bare branches.\nAlso, no measurable rain has fallen in two weeks, and Dombek noted it has been quite windy, and that has contributed to drying out the soils.\nThe rain is expected back off around 8 p.m. Saturday.\n» READ MORE: For Sunday's half-marathoners, expect a dry, but quite a chilly, run\nThe sun is due to reappear Sunday, but for the 12,000 people expected to participate in Philly’s Love Run , it will be a chilly half marathon or 7K, with temperatures in the low to mid-30s, winds from the north gusting 30 to 35 mph, and wind chills in the 20s. At least it should be a dry run.",

    "text": "The talented teenage surfer who died in a shark attack on a remote South Australian beach has been identified as 15-year-old Khai Cowley. The young man died after his leg was torn off in the attack and he was pulled from the water near Ethel Beach in Innes National Park, on South Australia’s Yorke Peninsula, about 1.30pm on Thursday. Witnesses said the horrific attack took place in front of his horrified father, who had brought his son there from his home in Seaford, Adelaide. Just two weeks ago, Khai had been named the “most outstanding grom artist” by his local surf club Seaview Road Board Riders. The talented teenage surfer who died in a shark attack on a remote South Australian beach has been identified as 15-year-old Khai Cowley. “The shark grabbed his leg, so another local ran out, jumped on his board and paddled out to help him,” one local told the Adelaide Advertiser. ‘The shark was surrounding them when the guy pulled the boy out of the water. There was a lot of blood. “He brought it to shore, but I think it was too late.” His friends have paid tribute to the young man online, posting on social media: “Fly high Kai, lots of love and I miss you already.” Emergency services desperately tried to save the teenager, but he could not survive his injuries. Your aunt Lauryn Barley has now created a GoFundMe appeal to raise funds for the family after the tragedy. “A white pointer suddenly snatched our beloved Khai from us while we were surfing in the Ethel Wreck off the coast of Yorke Penisula,” he posted. “I’m here to try and help raise money for my sister Kate and brother Tim to cover the cost of the funeral.” There has been a great deal of grief following the tragic news. ‘A boy with a lot of potential. He will hold a place in everyone’s hearts,” a family friend wrote on social media. A local fisherman said large sharks are a common sight along Marion Bay in Innes National Park. “We’ve seen some pretty big broncos in the area, but that’s normal here,” he said. ‘I went to take the boat out and the rangers blocked the way to Ethel’s house. “There is no mobile coverage in the park, so we didn’t know what had happened until we returned to Marion Bay.” Unfortunately, there have been a number of shark attacks in South Australia in recent months.
