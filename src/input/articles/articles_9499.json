    "text": "Pop Culture\nLily Allen's joke about her kids 'ruining' her career is a spot-on comment about motherhood\nNo, most women can't \"have it all.\"\nWikipedia_(cropped).jpg)\n“You can have it all.”\nThis has been a\npost-3rd wave feminism promise sworn to women. That you can have a big family, a high achieving career, a fulfilling relationship, a never-ending sense of purpose, no bad hair days, healthy lunches that make themselves, and so on and so on. myth. There is still measurable inequalitybetween men and women when it comes to being able to advance in their careers and have children. Even the ones who do seem to “have it all” are the exception to the rule, and likely have sacrificed other aspects of their identity.\nThat goes for pop stars too, apparently. While appearing on an episode of the\nRadio Times Podcast, British singer Lily Allen spoke candidly about her own experience of not being able to move up in the music industry after becoming a mom.\nAllen shot to prominence in 2006 thanks to her hit song “Smile.” Only two years later, she earned a nomination for best alternative music album at the 2008 Grammy Awards for debut album, \"Alright Still.”\nBut instead, Allen followed in the footsteps of celebrities like Rick Moranis, and chose to focus on her children.\n\"Some people choose their career over their children, and that’s their prerogative,\" she explained. \"My parents were quite absent when I was a kid, and I feel like that really left some nasty scars that I'm not willing to repeat on mine. I’m glad that I have done that, because I think they’re pretty well-rounded people.”\nIn other words: “My children ruined my career,” she joked, before adding “I love them and they complete me, but in terms of pop stardom, totally ruined it.”\nThough Allen has no regrets, she brought up the story to address how unrealistic it is for most women to be able to do both, and being told otherwise by society is less-than-empowering.\n\"It really annoys me when people say you can have it all, because — quite frankly — you can’t.\"\nBetween pay inequality, difference in work life balance, corporate attitudes towards pregnancy leave, and already being less likely to advance than their male counterparts even without the factor of children (not to mention the world not fully being set up for two working parents with zero community support) it feels safe to assume that Allen is touching on something fairly universal here.\nThough her pop star chapter might have reached a close, Allen seems to still be living a pretty cool life— from her swanky\nNew York apartment with David Harbour to winning awards for her stage acting. So though she might not “have it all,” she certainly has some pretty cool things going for her.",

    "text": "The coach for Canada ‘s Olympic women’s soccer team has been suspended over alleged drone use to spy on opponents. On Thursday, the Canadian Olympic Committee announced that Bev Priestman will no longer lead the team at the games , following a FIFA and IOC investigation that tied her to drone use “predating” the Olympics .\n“Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,” read a statement from Canada Soccer CEO Kevin Blue. “In light of these new revelations, Canada Soccer has made the decision to suspend Women’s National Team Head Coach, Bev Priestman, for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.”\nPriestman’s suspension will last until the completion of an independent investigation from Canada’s soccer governing board, Blue explained. Assistant coach Andy Spence will take on interim coaching duties for the remainder of the games.\nCanada WNT Head Coach Bev Priestman has been sent home from the 2024 Olympics, COC announced 🇨🇦 pic.twitter.com/jkXURVrtqT\n— FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) July 25, 2024 The decision to remove Priestman comes days after a non-accredited member of the Canada Soccer team was detained detained by French authorities following an incident in Saint-Étienne. The discovery of the drone usage led to the removal of two staff members from the team. On Wednesday, Priestman denied her involvement in the incident.\nCanadian Olympic Committee (COC) said a “non-accredited member of the Canada Soccer support team” had been detained by French authorities in Saint-Étienne, a city 250 miles south of Paris, for improperly using a drone.\n“Irrespective of the details, I’m ultimately accountable for this team,” the coach said following a team practice, per The Guardian . “By no means did I direct the individuals.”\n“I’m still learning the details and obviously this is all unfolding,” she added. “But again, I think the important thing right now is to look forward, put the actions in place and take the sanctions.”\nThe COC had released a statement Wednesday that Joseph Lombardi, an unaccredited analyst with Canada Soccer, and Jasmine Mander, an assistant coach to whom Lombardi allegedly reported, were “sent home immediately.” Trending Elon Musk's Daughter Fires Back After He Says She Was 'Killed' By 'Woke Mind Virus' So ...

Canada defeated New Zealand 2-1 on Thursday during the team’s Paris Olympic debut, although Priestman was not at the game.\nCanada is next set to play France, the Games’ host, on July 28 as part of the competition’s Group A, which also includes New Zealand and Colombia. Canada is the reigning gold medal winners.",

    "text": "A tres días de la primera vuelta de las cruciales elecciones legislativas en Francia, la ultraderechista Marine Le Pen ha elevado la apuesta sobre una posible cohabitación política al afirmar que el título de \"jefe de las fuerzas armadas\" para el presidente es \"honorífico\". Le Pen asegura que al controlar los fondos destinados a las operaciones militares podrá rechazar el envío de tropas a Ucrania, lo que Emmanuel Macron ha evitado descartar.\n¿Qué ocurrirá con la política exterior de Francia en caso de una victoria de Agrupación Nacional en las elecciones legislativas ? ¿Qué pasará si el presidente Macron, que debe quedarse en el poder hasta el 2027 debe convivir con, como primer ministro, Jordan Bardella, del partido de la derecha radical? ¿Dónde quedará el apoyo diplomático y militar de Francia?\nEsta situación, llamada de \"cohabitación\" del poder entre un presidente y un primer ministro de distinto signo político supone un reparto de las prerrogativas. Durante las tres cohabitaciones políticas anteriores en Francia, el Presidente conservó amplios poderes en materia de política internacional y defensa, en virtud de este \"dominio reservado\". Sin embargo, Agrupación Nacional podría cambiar esta tradición.\nEn una entrevista concedida al diario Télégramme , la probable candidata a las elecciones presidenciales de 2027 Marine Le pen subrayó que \"es el Primer Ministro quien maneja la chequera \". Por ello, en su opinión, \"el Presidente no podrá enviar tropas a Ucrania\", aunque Emmanuel Macron se ha negado a descartar esta opción.\nEl cargo de primer ministro será para el partido de extrema derecha si obtiene la mayoría absoluta en la Asamblea al término de los comicios del 30 de junio y el 7 de julio.\nFrançois Bayrou, presidente del partido centrista Modem y estrecho aliado del jefe del Estado, considera que Marine Le Pen ha \"desafiado profundamente la Constitución\" con esta declaración \"extremadamente grave\".\n\"Cuando los partidos nacionalistas y populistas han ganado el poder en toda Europa, han aplicado una estrategia metódica para arrogarse plenos poderes\", añadió el ministro francés de Asuntos Europeos, Jean-Noël Barrot.\nSin embargo, Le Pen pareció matizar esta afirmación el jueves por la mañana en X aludiendo al \"dominio reservado del Presidente de la República\" sobre estos temas sensibles de política exterior y defensa, pero mantuvo que \"el primer ministro dispone, a través del control presupuestario, de los medios para oponerse\" al envío de tropas al extranjero.\n\"Si llegamos al poder (...), no será para fingir\", añadió el vicepresidente de RN, Sébastien Chenu, refiriéndose a otras \"líneas rojas\" como la negativa a suministrar a Kiev armas de largo alcance.\nPor el momento, se prevé que la extrema derecha se imponga en la primera vuelta del domingo, con un 36% de las intenciones de voto, según un sondeo Ipsos-Fondation Jean-Jaurès-Cevipof-Institut Montaigne realizado entre cerca de 12,000 personas para Le Monde .\nSegún este amplio estudio, que no ofrece proyecciones en términos de escaños, la izquierda cosecharía el 29% de los votos, el bando del presidente Macron el 19,5% y Les Républicains (derecha tradicional) el 8%.\nSin embargo, hay muchas incógnitas en las 577 elecciones en cada circunscripción, y es probable que las ecuaciones se alteren radicalmente entre las dos vueltas en función del número de apoyos, retiradas o incluso instrucciones de voto.\nUna mayoría relativa abriría también la perspectiva de un bloqueo institucional, reforzado por la negativa del líder de extrema derecha, Jordan Bardella, a formar gobierno sin mayoría absoluta.\nTEMAS - Marine Le Pen Seguir Tema + Siguiendo ✓ Agrupación Nacional Seguir Tema + Siguiendo ✓ Elecciones legislativas Seguir Tema + Siguiendo ✓ RFI RFI es una radio francesa de actualidad, difundida a escala mundial en francés y en 15 idiomas más, mediante 156 repetidores de FM en ondas medias y cortas en una treintena de satélites a destino de los cinco continentes, en Internet y en aplicaciones conectadas, que cuenta con más de 2,000 radios asociadas que emiten sus programas.\nEn portada Ver todos Actualidad Eugenio Cedeño culpa a la prensa por sus nefastas declaraciones",

    "title": "Lidl's champagne 'better than Moët & Chandon' slashed to under £10 ahead of New Year",
    "text": "We may have just had Christmas less than a week ago, but another party event is fast approaching - Hogmanay. If you're planning to ring in the New Year, then chances are that you will be on the hunt for another bottle of bubbly. However, some of us might have been a bit over indulgent over the festive period and might need to head to the shops over the next few days. Luckily, partygoers can nab a bargain, as Lidl has today slashed the cost of its award-winning [Montaudon Champagne Brut](https://www.lidl.co.uk/p/montaudon-champagner-aop-brut/p178908) to under a tenner. Originally priced at £14.99, the supermarket's champagne is reduced to £9.99 for [Lidl Plus members](https://www.lidl.co.uk/c/lidl-plus/s10023095) - and there is a three bottle maximum for each customer. Lauded by experts, this budget bottle of fizz recently went toe-to-toe with some heavyweights in a blind taste test panel. The result found that six out of 10 participants thought Lidl's champagne was \"better than Moët & Chandon.\" Boasting delicate aromas of citrus fruits and a dry-finish, the supermarket's Montaudon Champagne Brut was also praised by Decanter magazine for its “real depth and complexity for the price.\" Meanwhile, Good Housekeeping called it the \"best budget champagne.\" Shoppers are not just winning on taste, but also price, as Tesco stocks a [75cl bottle of Moet & Chandon Brut Imperial Non Vintage Champagne](https://go.skimresources.com?id=76202X1529444&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fgroceries%2Fen-GB%2Fproducts%2F255245509&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailyrecord.co.uk%2Flifestyle%2Ffood-drink%2Flidls-champagne-better-mot--31762678) at £43 for regular shoppers and £35 for Clubcard members. It means that Lidl customers are saving themselves between £43 and £25 for a bottle of bubbly that matches the quality of the premium champagne house. A bottle of the prestigious champagne has also been slashed to £35 at [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3NHxGkJ) and [Sainsbury's.](https://go.skimresources.com?id=76202X1529444&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sainsburys.co.uk%2Fgol-ui%2Fproduct%2Fmo%25C3%25ABt-chandon-imp%25C3%25A9rial-brut-non-vintage-champagne-75cl&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailyrecord.co.uk%2Flifestyle%2Ffood-drink%2Flidls-champagne-better-mot--31762678) Either way, Lidl [shoppers](http://ord.co.uk/all-about/shopping) are still getting the cheaper deal for New Year's Eve this year.

    "text": "Manchester United star Casemiro leads Europe in a key metric, suggesting he still has something to offer the club under Ruben Amorim.\nSpeculation over Casemiro’s future has been rife, amidst suggestions that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS are desperate to offload him and get his hefty £350,000 per week wages off the books.\nDuring the January transfer window, it appeared like a move to Saudi Arabia was set to happen but it didn’t materialise and the Brazilian ended up staying at Old Trafford.\nHe has since insisted more than once that his wish is to see out his contract, which expires in the summer of 2026.\nA report covered by The Peoples Person relayed that Casemiro will only move to a club that matches his salary as he is not willing to give up even a penny.\nAmidst the spate of injuries the Red Devils are dealing with, Casemiro has seen his playing time dramatically improve. In the early stages of Amorim’s spell, the five-time Champions League winner was at the bottom of the pecking order but he is now a regular presence in the team.\nCasemiro started both legs of United’s Europa League triumph over Real Sociedad and also came off the bench for the last 20 or so minutes of last weekend’s 3-0 victory over Leicester City. At the King Power Stadium, his superb long pass to Diogo Dalot created the opportunity for the defender to assist Bruno Fernandes for United’s third goal of the night.\nNow statisticians Squawka have revealed that Casemiro is averaging more tackles per 90 minutes than any other player across Europe’s top five leagues this season.\nThe 33-year-old is making an impressive 4.97 tackles per 90 minutes. Bournemouth’s Tyler Adams ranks second with 4.56 tackles made per 90. Everton man Idrissa Gana Gueye rounds up the top three with 4.36 tackles per 90.\nCasemiro’s teammate, Manuel Ugarte, is fourth on the list with 4.2 tackles per 90.\nMost tackles per 90 in Europe’s top five leagues this season. pic.twitter.com/93HHInKbn0\n— Squawka (@Squawka) March 18, 2025\nDespite a noticeable decline in his speed and physicality, Casemiro continues to demonstrate his ability to make a positive impact for United.\nIn addition to his wealth of experience, he is still a solid disruptor and defensive stalwart in the middle of the park.\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images",

    "title": "Protecting small pockets of the Hauraki Gulf will have huge impacts | The Spinoff",
    "text": "Marine ecologist Benn Hanns has spent more than 10 years sticking his head under the water in the Hauraki Gulf to monitor the effects of marine reserves, and let him tell you – they’ve got benefits. When I first started quantifying marine life in the Hauraki Gulf, I was a third younger than I am now. There were no grey hairs, and somehow I had a six pack without ever going to the gym. Times have changed. It was back then (the peak of my youth) that the Hauraki Gulf / Tīkapa Moana Marine Protection Bill, which is currently before parliament, was starting to take shape among scientists, iwi and other stakeholders. Right now, only 0.3% of the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park is fully protected across six marine reserves. Even though they are relatively tiny, their impacts have been massive. Populations of important species have rebuilt, and ecosystems have been restored. In the older reserves like Goat Island (officially called Cape Rodney to Okarari Point Marine Reserve), reef predator populations such as tāmure (snapper) and kōura (crayfish) have recovered. These predators have suppressed kina numbers and the impact of kina grazing which in turn has allowed kelp forests to flourish. Marine reserves are not surrounded by fences and their effects are not limited to their boundaries. The Goat Island marine reserve, which is only about 5km2, has been estimated to contribute up to [11% of newly settled juvenile tāmure to the surrounding 400 km2](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2017.1300). This is because marine reserves allow animals to get big and [big animals produce more eggs](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00775.x) – it takes 36 30cm-long tāmure to make the same amount of eggs as one that is 70cm long. In essence, the reserve has acted as a baby snapper factory, supplementing tāmure populations in surrounding areas. The protections proposed in the Hauraki Gulf / Tīkapa Moana Marine Protection Bill would protect about 6% of the Gulf by extending two existing marine reserves and creating 12 new high protection areas. It would also introduce five new seafloor protection areas. The main difference between marine reserves and high protection areas (HPAs) is that while the former are “no take”, the latter allow for customary fishing. Their placements of the proposed HPAs have been designed using key principles on size and location to create a network of effective protection around valuable ecosystems and key species. For the most part, the proposed protections have been warmly welcomed. People are well aware that the [Hauraki Gulf is facing ecological problems](https://gulfjournal.org.nz/state-of-the-gulf/) and is under pressure from fishing, contamination from surrounding land use and climate change. But, there has been some pushback from recreational fishing groups such as [Legasea](https://legasea.co.nz/2023/10/01/hauraki-gulf-marine-park-fisheries-plan/), and [interesting rhetoric](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/could-shane-jones-be-the-fishing-champion-the-industry-is-looking-for/NTXSBKBLVJCINAQHJK7TWCILLA/) from our new minister for oceans and fisheries Shane Jones, who is often aligned with the interests of commercial fishing. It’s a good time, then, for a reminder and deeper dive into the potential benefits the bill promises. Like the nerd my work allows me to be, I’ve spent a bit of time calculating the potential benefits of the proposed protections. My research has mainly focused on crayfish and snapper, because they are key species in the gulf and have been heavily impacted by fishing. A few weeks ago I published [research in the Gulf Journal](https://gulfjournal.org.nz/2024/01/how-will-the-hauraki-gulf-tikapa-moana-marine-protection-bill-impact-fish-and-fishing-in-the-gulf/), where you can find more detail on the following. My calculations indicated the proposed HPAs have the potential to dramatically increase the biomass (literally the mass of living animals) and egg production of tāmure and kōura in the Gulf. I estimated that the biomass of reef-associated tāmure in the Hauraki Gulf could increase by 3.5 times and overall egg production could increase by 3.8 times. For kōura, the spawning biomass (the combined weight of all sexually mature females) could increase by 3.8 times and annual egg production by 3.3 times. These are dramatic increases considering the proposal aims to only protect 6% of the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park. The animation below shows how you’d expect the larvae to move beyond the protected areas over 10 days. Exisiting marine reserves are in purple, while the proposed HPAs are in red. This preliminary analysis uses a hydro-dynamic model which takes into consideration the movement of the water in the Gulf alongside the biology and size of tāmure eggs. I also plan to make a similar model for kōura, so watch this space. Protecting specific areas, rather than species specific regulations on fishing is important in the Hauraki Gulf. The gulf is unique because it’s an area where recreational fishing is equally, if not more, impactful than commercial fishing. Recreational fishing has fewer limitations and is harder to manage. The beauty of protecting areas is you protect a whole ecosystem. It’s a multi-species holistic protection, which would be hard and time-consuming to achieve with regulations like size limits and catch limits. The conversation around marine protected areas is too often about fishing. These areas are about so much more. They’re not even just about being able to study things (we’ve already got plenty of material). They’re about preserving. People can go snorkelling there and see a healthy ecosystem, because it still exists. They’re also about resilience – climate change will bring new pressures and protected ecosystems will be stronger to be able to cope. When I am three times as old as I am now, there will be too many grey hairs to count. If the bill passes, fish in the gulf will multiply in the same way.",

    "text": "Kansas City Chiefs defeat Miami Dolphins in conditions so cold that head coach Andy Reid’s mustache freezes CNN By Jacob Lev, CNN (CNN) — The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Miami Dolphins 26-7 at Arrowhead Stadium on Saturday, in conditions so cold that Chiefs head coach Andy Reid’s mustache froze over. The temperature at kickoff was -4 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind chill of -20 degrees, making it [the fourth coldest game](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/13/weather/coldest-nfl-games-trnd/index.html) in National Football League history, according to the Peacock broadcast. Pictures of Reid with icicles in his facial hair have since gone viral on social media. Amid the brutal conditions, the Kansas City offense hit the ground running, marching down the field on the opening drive and capping it off with an 11-yard touchdown throw from quarterback Patrick Mahomes to wide receiver Rashee Rice. Rice would go on to finish the game with eight receptions for 130 yards. The Chiefs never looked back, shutting down the Dolphins offense completely. Chiefs’ kicker Harrison Butker went 4 for 4 on field goals and running back Isiah Pacheco ran it in for a three-yard rushing touchdown to put the game on ice (literally) in the fourth quarter. Mahomes finished the game with 262 yards and a touchdown. Taylor Swift was in attendance and braved the frigid temperatures wearing a #87 Kelce jacket in support of her beau Travis Kelce. Kelce finished the game with seven receptions for 71 yards. At the end of the game, the temperature was -9 degrees and felt like -28 degrees, according to the broadcast. Players could be seen huddling by pitch-side heaters and many made the most of heated benches in a bid to keep out the cold. Mahomes downplayed the weather, saying “it is what it is” when asked about it on the Peacock broadcast after the game. “We’re in Kansas City, at Arrowhead,” Mahomes said. “We are going to play in some games like this. So, our mentality was to come out here, play football and see what happens.” Still, Saturday’s conditions are rivaled by the coldest NFL game on record: the December 1967 “Ice Bowl” in Wisconsin, when the Green Bay Packers beat the Dallas Cowboys amid -13 air temperature and a -48 wind chill, according to the NFL. Earlier on Saturday, the Houston Texans defeated the Cleveland Browns 45-14. It was a historic day for rookie Texans quarterback CJ Stroud, who threw for 274 yards and three touchdowns. Stroud’s three touchdown passes tied a rookie record in a playoff game. The 23-year-old former second-overall pick also became the youngest quarterback to win a playoff game in NFL history. The NFL playoffs continue on Sunday with the Green Bay Packers heading to Texas to take on the Dallas Cowboys. Matthew Stafford will also make his grand return to the city where he started his NFL career when the Los Angeles Rams take on the Detroit Lions. On Monday, the Pittsburgh Steelers head to a snowy Orchard Park, New York, to take on the Buffalo Bills and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers host the Philadelphia Eagles.
