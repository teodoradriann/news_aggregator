    "title": "The Golden Bachelor: Signs Mel Owens Is Less Committed Than He Says (Mel May Not Truly Be Looking For Love On The Show)",
    "text": "All eyes are on The Golden Bachelor’s next lead, Mel Owens, but could the football star have joined the competition for all the wrong reasons? Mel would be the second to lead the senior dating spin-off, following last season's Gerry Turner. Gerry, while passionate about the competition and his contestants, didn’t find lasting love. After whittling down his 22 contestants to just two finalists, Gerry proposed to Theresa Nist. He and Theresa embarked on a three-month marriage before their ultimate divorce. With this history, fans are hoping Mel finds more success through the dating competition.\nMel seems to have the best intentions for The Golden Bachelor season 2, but he may be concealing red flags. He is no stranger to this limelight, as Mel played professional football on behalf of the LA Rams for 9 seasons. After this lengthy NFL stint, Mel retired from the industry and set his focus on law and justice, specifically regarding sports-related injury cases. He’s now living a quieter life, but Mel could be craving stardom once more. If Mel enters the competition with the sole purpose of fame and entertainment, countless hearts could be broken.\nMel May Only Join For The Experience\nCould He Just Be Bored?\nMel’s accustomed to the limelight. After years of being a star football player, Mel’s quieter life may not be as fulfilling. He could be seeking out the fame and fortune he once knew, and reality TV is one of the best places to start an influencer career. The Ringer discusses this phenomenon, explaining that franchises like The Bachelor can attract contestants for the “wrong reasons,” such as online attention. The article’s author, Alyssa Bereznak, aptly writes:\n“The Bachelor franchise has become a launchpad for influencers who sell a wide range of lifestyle products, sustain a growing media ecosystem, and function as recurring characters within the show’s extended universe.”\nWhile audiences tune in to follow the drama and, ideally, lasting love, the franchise has undeniable ties with budding influencer careers. Mel could be one of many stars who have joined the cast, hoping for a platform rather than a genuine love story. His life has undergone radical changes, from star status to fatherhood and divorce. Mel could be looking for some excitement again.\nMel’s two sons, Lucas and Andre, are leaving the nest. Following the divorce, Mel focused his attention on raising his children. The Golden Bachelor’s press release informed audiences that after his father’s passing and the divorce, “Owens channeled his energy into being the best father he could be, focusing on raising his sons and coaching their extracurricular sports teams.” Now that they are college-aged and moving out, Mel may want a new challenge. The show could provide this. However, this could signify inauthentic intentions.\nMel May Not Be Interested In Women His Age\nMel’s Ex Was Much Younger Than He\nEven if Mel enters the competition with a genuine interest in finding love, the show's age bracket does not correlate with his dating history. Mel divorced his wife, whom he refers to as his “first love,” in 2020. His ex-wife, revealed to be Fabiana Pimental, was married to Mel for nearly 18 years. The pair tied the knot when she was just 21 years old.\nMel is 19 years older than Fabiana.\nThe age gap between Mel and his previous wife is substantial. Mel was 40 when he committed to the relationship with the 21-year-old. Now, he is entering a senior-oriented dating competition with women in their 60s. Mel may not have the same interest in these more mature contestants.\nThe age bracket for women contestants on The Golden Bachelor is 60 to 75 years old.\nThe show revolves around dating at a later stage in life, and the minimum age for each bachelorette starts at 60 years old. If younger women are more likely to pique Mel’s interest, his contestants could be set up for failure. Assuming that he is genuinely searching for love, the age ranges of the women involved could sway Mel’s opinion. Hopefully, Mel enters the competition with an open mind and heart.\nDoes Mel Have The Best Intentions?\nMel Could Break Hearts\nMel seems like an authentic candidate. He claims a legitimate interest in finding his forever partner through the dating competition. Mel endured his fair share of heartbreak, and hopefully, his experiences will encourage a genuine and kind approach to the season.\nIf the former football star enters with malicious intent, contestants and fans could be devastated. He may damage the show’s reputation further by promoting the idea that contestants enter for the “wrong” reasons. Only time will tell if The Golden Bachelor will exceed expectations and disprove franchise tropes.\nThe Golden Bachelor is available to stream on Hulu.\nSource: The Ringer\nYour comment has not been saved\nThe Golden Bachelor\n- Release Date\n- September 28, 2023\n- Network\n-\nABC\nCast\n-\nJesse Palmer\n-\nJesse Palmer",

Opciones para compartir Agentes de la Policía Nacional de la Comisaría de Siero han salvado la vida de un hombre de 67 años en El Berrón. Los hechos tuvieron lugar el pasado 14 de junio en la Calle Los Laureles de la localidad. Tres agentes, pertenecientes a la Brigada Local de Policía Judicial, se encontraban realizando labores propias de su cargo cuando observaron al varón tendido en la calle, rodeado por varias personas. El hombre había sufrido una parada cardíaca mientras se encontraba en el interior de un bar cercano, cayendo desplomado. A la llegada de los agentes, el hombre se encontraba sin signos vitales, por lo que procedieron a practicar maniobras de reanimación cardiopulmonar, a la par que daban aviso a los servicios sanitarios de emergencia a través de la Sala Operativa de la Policía Nacional. Los agentes desarrollaron labores de reanimación durante veinte minutos, practicando varios ciclos completos hasta la llegada de una ambulancia medicalizada. Finalmente, la posterior llegada de los servicios sanitarios y el empleo de un desfibrilador, permitió a estos estabilizar al varón, el cual se encontraba en parada cardiorrespiratoria. La rápida intervención de los agentes resultó fundamental para salvar la vida del hombre, el cual aún continúa ingresado en el Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias en proceso de recuperación.

    "text": "Inteligencia artificial nos ayudaría a vivir hasta los 150 años Así lo determinó un estudio de la Universidad de Chicago. Periodista: Rubén Mcadam. ¿Alguna vez usted se ha preguntado cuántos años le gustaría vivir? Para algunos, la barrera de los 100 años parece lejana de alcanzar, aunque le vamos a dar un dato que lo puede sorprender: en Costa Rica, la esperanza de vida es de 83,3 años en mujeres y 78,4 en hombres, pero un estudio de la Universidad de Chicago, Estados Unidos, estima que, gracias a la inteligencia artificial (IA), podríamos aumentar nuestra esperanza de vida hasta los 150 años. Además, la empresa biotecnológica Singapur Gero complementó la investigación, demostrando que, con ayuda de la IA, se podrá alcanzar esa edad, por medio de la preservación de los tejidos y órganos. Pero también hay que explicar un tema: ¿vivir con calidad de vida o con cantidad de años? El decano de Medicina de la UCIMED, Pablo Vargas, nos explica la diferencia. “La esperanza de vida saludable es aquella donde la persona puede ser independiente, puede hacer sus compras, realizar ejercicios sin depender de asistencia; entonces, la esperanza de vida saludable es, por ejemplo, 65 años y luego hay 15 años donde la persona va a estar viva, pero va a requerir un apoyo, esa es la diferencia de la esperanza de vida normal y la esperanza de vida saludable”, explicó el médico. Ahora bien, es arriesgado determinar hasta qué edad podremos vivir. Pero, según la Ciencia, no importa qué tantos avances científicos se logren, el límite de la vida humana son los 150 años, afirma la investigación.",

    "text": "With the arrest of three accused, police claimed to have busted a UP-based cow-slaughtering gang active in Delhi-NCR, police said. Delhi Police Joint Team of AATS/NED and PS Karawal Nagar busted a cow slaughtering gang of Sambhal (UP) active in Delhi-NCR and solved the cow slaughtering case and arrested three accused, police said. According to the police, the apprehended accused have been identified as Wajhat alias Ajju (32), Jahane Alam alias Jahna (30), and Sajid alias Sadva (28). All the accused are residents of UPs Amroha district. A four-wheeler vehicle used in the commission of crime has also been recovered, police said. The main accused, Sajid alias Sadwa, is a notorious criminal who was caught earlier by UP Police in an encounter, and he came out of jail in July 2023. According to North East Delhi DCP Joy Tirkey, a PCR call was received in Karawal Nagar police station on December 24 informing that some severed heads of cow and other parts were found near Janki Panchal Vihar, Karawal Nagar, Delhi. Accordingly, a case under Section 429 and 424(4) of the IPC and Section 12 of the Prevention of Cruelty Against Animals Act was registered at Karawal Nagar Police Station, and an investigation was subsequently taken up. During the course of the investigation, all possible efforts were made to trace the accused persons. Several CCTV footages were analysed, and upon analysing the CCTV footage, a Honda City car was found involved in the case, police said. The route of the car was followed, and it was found that three people disembarked from the car near Seemapuri Depot, Delhi. Based on collected inputs and information, the police zeroed in on three suspected persons and succeeded in apprehending them from their rented accommodation in Old Mustafabad, Delhi. On verification, their identities were established. On sustained interrogation, the apprehended accused confessed to their crime and further disclosed that they procured the Xylaxin injections used to make cows unconscious from a chemist in Jafrabad and used to lift stray cows from various areas of Delhi-NCR. According to the police, 17 syringes and 34 needles were also recovered from their possession. All three accused persons have been found to be dreaded criminals, previously involved in more than 15 cow slaughtering cases registered in Nagli (UP), Shalimar Bagh, and Gokulpuri, while other locations are still being verified, police said.",

    "title": "After 2-wk hosp stay, patient with pig kidney heads home - Times of India",
    "text": "The first patient to receive a kidney transplanted from a genetically modified pig has fared so well that he has been discharged from the hospital on Wednesday, just two weeks after the groundbreaking surgery. The transplant and its encouraging outcome represent a remarkable moment in medicine, scientists say, possibly heralding an era of cross-species organ transplantation. Two previous organ transplants from genetically modified pigs failed. Both patients received hearts, and both died a few weeks later. In one patient, there were signs that the immune system had rejected the organ, a constant risk.But the kidney transplanted into Richard Slayman, 62, is producing urine, removing waste products from the blood, balancing the body's fluids and carrying out other key functions, according to his doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital. The procedure brings the prospect of xenotransplantation, or animal-to-human organ transplants, significantly closer to reality, said Dr. David Klassen, the chief medical officer for the United Network for Organ Sharing, which manages the nation's organ transplant system. \\\"Though much work remains to be done, I think the potential of this to benefit a large number of patients will be realised.\\\"Whether Slayman's body will eventually reject the transplanted organ is still unknown, Klassen noted. There are other hurdles: A successful operation would've be replicated in numerous patients and studied in clinical trials before xenotransplants become widely available. If these transplants are to be scaled up and integrated into the healthcare system, there are \\\"daunting\\\" logistical challenges, he said, starting with ensuring an adequate supply of organs from genetically engineered animals. The cost too, he said, may be a substantial obstacle.",

    "text": "Korean rapper and actor Choi Seung Hyun, known as T.O.P, has made a notable return to the screen in 'Squid Game' Season 2, portraying the character Thanos. This role marks his first major appearance since his 2017 conviction for marijuana use, which led to a hiatus from the entertainment industry.\nIn 'Squid Game,' Thanos is depicted as a former rapper who becomes Player 230, participating in the deadly games. The character's background mirrors T.O.P's real-life experiences, adding depth to his portrayal.\nDirector Hwang Dong Hyuk expressed admiration for T.O.P's performance, stating, \"I'm very satisfied with what he did with the character.\" He also acknowledged the challenges T.O.P faced due to his past, noting that taking on such a role required \"a lot of guts.\"\nDespite initial controversies surrounding his casting, T.O.P's portrayal of Thanos has been met with praise, marking a successful comeback for the artist. His involvement in 'Squid Game' Season 2 not only highlighted his acting skills but also signified a new chapter in his career.\nT.O.P shared with NME, \"Then I ended up disappointing so many people and, at that time, I had to go through an intense darkness – so dark that it’s hard to imagine. There were some moments back then when I felt such intense and heavy shame that I just wanted to quit everything.” The artist continued, \"I did think that getting to portray a role like this character might end up leading to me being pigeonholed, especially because Squid Game is such a global series. This was a concern, not just personally but from people around me as well. But I also thought that, in a way, it almost felt like destiny that I met this character, which is what led me to gather my courage.\"\nT.O.P reflected on his character and explained, \"There’s a lot of connection with him and parts of my past and my past mistakes. I had to really sit down and think about if I was going to go through with it. I felt the only way to repay the trust that director Hwang had placed in me was for me to really do a good job in portraying Thanos.” The artist confessed he felt immense pressure to do well on this mega 'Squid Game' project. He explained, \"There was a lot of pressure, especially [because] initially in Squid Game, there are so many actors on set and so many members of the crew.When I first arrived, everything felt very surreal. To be a part of the 456 players of Squid Game and being there, having so many sets of eyes on me, I think that’s when it just really hit me that, ‘Oh, I am really a part of Squid Game'.”\nDuring his interview with NME, T.O.P also shared exciting news about his musical activities. He shared he is currently aiming to return as a musician to share his music. He explained, \"What I am currently hoping to do is share with the world T.O.P – me as a musician – because I will be sharing my music [for the first time] in almost a decade. The musician T.O.P would be the character that I want to play [now].\"\nNot only did T.O.P give insight into his portrayal of Thanos and his plans, but he also expressed his deep reflection over the years. He shared, \"Over the years, I spent a lot of time really thinking about and regretting what I have done, and I spent a lot of time on self-reflection as well. I think those years have allowed my musical universe to change greatly. I feel that my music has become richer and expanded in size as well, so I’m quite confident that my fans will feel that I have matured musically.\"\nFor more of T.O.P's in-depth interview, you can visit NME.\nSEE ALSO: [T.O.P shares Netflix gifts ahead of 'Squid Game 2' teaser]",

    "text": "Giallo nel tardo pomeriggio ad Andora quando un ciclista di 64 anni è stato trovato a terra da alcuni passanti lungo la strada comunale per Conna, dopo una brutta caduta. Ancora incerta la dinamica dell’accaduto: non è chiaro se l’uomo sia caduto a causa di un malore improvviso o se l’incidente sia stato provocato da un ostacolo sulla strada. Sembra escluso, per ora, ipotesi di un pirata della strada che possa aver colpito il ciclista e poi essersi allontanato.\nL’allarme è stato lanciato intorno alle 17,45, e sono immediatamente intervenuti i sanitari del 118 e un’ambulanza della Croce Bianca di Andora. Il ciclista, che presentava un grave trauma cranico, è stato stabilizzato e trasportato in codice rosso all’ospedale Santa Corona di Pietra Ligure. Le sue condizioni verranno monitorate nelle prossime ore.\nLeggi i commenti I commenti dei lettori\nVideo © Riproduzione riservata La guida allo shopping del Gruppo Gedi i Consigli.it sceglie e raccomanda in maniera indipendente prodotti e servizi che si possono acquistare online o tramite la consulenza di esperti.
