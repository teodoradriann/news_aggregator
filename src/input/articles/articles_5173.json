    "text": "Today, multi-Platinum-selling rapper Kodak Black unleashes “Non Believer,” a spiritual new song that marks one of his most deeply personal to date. Coated in piercing reflection and existential exploration, the new single is as vulnerable as it is mesmerizing. Listen to “Non Believer” [HERE](https://77yjo5bab.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001adw7d9kHY2_BBDzzX_neLa1a-9HYUZpvCiRg_Hp1sORMO9wuGnFjvAe3XkFY_QDycEysi1na-5EOtzpq9RZEtEM-cltjza5Rb-ioRxPQYK9_0kkjn4xgaHJv2crTTyLMhBcJpo7gWd9L5igSO3XcXMqnLRsIuwN-1JGCAdNqqqg=&c=ZZ-baSvBqev9TWwFNvtKWGKvw-7QwZT9vNQ04-uzZP45utxh4hpGrA==&ch=NGbjD1j4meNP68QF9ssk55_IKW4w9chYT2smRXN_wNvlqx89_ynIRA==) out now via Vulture Love / Capitol Records. Coasting bursts of insistent percussion and supple guitar strings that let his words breathe, Kodak Black dives into themes of morality. The Pooh Beatz, EJ Beats, and Juji produced record sifts through tragic outcomes and evolving morality with disarming honesty. “Lord knows I’m not perfect, but I try to make it right,” he raps, his raw admission spilling out with unguarded sincerity. Earnest, melodic and unflinchingly transparent, it’s quintessential Kodak. It’s also a sign of a young creator growing as a rapper while turning his mistakes into the most compelling art in the world of music. “Non Believer” follows the release of “Shampoo,” a confident burst of street rap that typifies the style that made him a superstar. On “Shampoo” he effortlessly shifts his cadence as he victoriously and confidently assures, “I got the sauce—like a condiment.” Of course, “Shampoo” was preceded by When I Was Dead, an engrossing album that sees Kodak lay bare his nightmares and blood-stained aspirations. Powered by lead single, “Lemme See,” the LP only reaffirmed Kodak’s status as one of the most powerful artists of his generation.",

    "text": "Pune: The labour department has begun mapping gig workers to create a centralised database in a key step towards extending legal protection and welfare benefits to them. State labour minister Aakash Fundkar told TOI on Friday that the comprehensive policy, expected to be announced by the year-end, would cover platform-based workers across companies and offer benefits such as health and accident insurance, pension schemes, skill development, and emergency financial aid. \"There are 321 registered e-commerce establishments in the state. A robust database is essential to ensure effective delivery of benefits and safeguard workers' rights,\" Fundkar said. A review meeting was held in Mumbai on Thursday. The meeting saw representations from Pune and Mumbai, including workers' groups and platform companies. Fundkar stressed the govt's commitment to bringing gig workers under the ambit of labour laws and relevant social security codes. \"States like Rajasthan, Karnataka, and Telangana are already moving in this direction. We, too, are working along similar lines and should be able to finalise the policy soon,\" he said. So far, two to three meetings have been held, but more consultations are planned, with wider stakeholder participation, including workers' collectives and platform operators. \"This is a crucial step in bringing gig workers on a par with the organised sector. They must not remain outside the scope of govt labour protections,\" the minister added. Workers have voiced concerns over job insecurity, absence of benefits, and erratic income. \"Once we lose our jobs, there is no safety net. Many of us work two to three shifts a day just to make ends meet,\" said a gig worker representative. Fundkar said the state is exploring ways to integrate gig workers into existing labour laws or create specific provisions tailored to their needs.\nStay updated with the latest local news from your city on Times of India (TOI).

    "text": "Strolling hand-in-hand through the manicured grounds of the luxury California hotel where they married, Golden Bachelor newlyweds Theresa Nist, 70, and Gerry Turner, 72, looked the picture of marital bliss the day after they tied the knot live on TV. Exclusive DailyMail.com photos show the happy couple out for a morning walk, with both dressing up for the occasion in bright colors. Glamorous gran Nist was pretty in a pair of coral chinos teamed with white boots and a blue floral blouse while her new husband was dapper in jeans, a pale blue linen blazer and a bright yellow shirt. 'Retired restaurateur' turned pool maintenance man Turner was first up and was seen taking a solo stroll through the grounds of the La Quinta Resort and Club early in the morning before returning to his wife in their $300-a-night room. Exclusive DailyMail.com photos show Golden Bachelor newlyweds Theresa Nist, 70, and Gerry Turner, 72, strolling hand-in-hand on a morning walk Friday Nist wore a pair of coral chinos teamed with white boots and a blue floral blouse while her new husband was dapper in jeans, a pale blue linen blazer and a bright yellow shirt The pair exchanged vows at the exclusive La Quinta Resort and Club in La Quinta, California, on Thursday Nist and Turner later were seen saying goodbye to friends and family before leaving the hotel The couple enjoyed a whirlwind romance since meeting just over three months ago – before marrying in a sunset ceremony on Thursday night Theresa was seen saying her goodbyes to friends and family after their televised wedding 'Retired restaurateur' turned pool maintenance man Turner was first up before his new wife joined him The pair are now set to enjoy an all-expenses paid Italian honeymoon after taking a short break for all the festivities Later, both Nist and Turner were up and about and were seen saying goodbye to friends and family before leaving the hotel. The pair are now set to enjoy an all-expenses paid Italian honeymoon but said they plan to take a shorter break first. Nist and Turner have enjoyed a whirlwind romance since meeting just over three months ago – before marrying live on ABC in a sunset Thursday night ceremony. The ceremony, which included multiple Bachelor Nation guests, saw financial services professional Nist arrive on the arm of son Tommy, 46, accompanied by her new stepdaughters Angie Warner, 43, and Jenny Young, 49, along with Turner's granddaughters Charlee, 16, and Payton, 22. For her big day, she plumped for an ivory tulle gown designed by New York fashion house Badgley Mishka and styled the dress with a white veil and a simple pair of gold satin sandals. Turner, meanwhile, was smartly dressed in a neat black tuxedo and was flanked by his groomsmen including his best man – son-in-law Rob, 44. Both became tearful as they read out their handwritten vows, with Turner telling Nist: 'Theresa when I think of all the decisions that we have made to be here in this position tonight, I know the hand of God and the winds of fate have ordained this moment. 'From our first sip of chocolate shake to the last taste of Costa Rican coffee, I have learned that you are the woman I can't live without. 'I learned that you make me calm with the touch of your hand. I've learned that you make me laugh with the easy comfort of a long-lost friend.' After being declared man and wife by officiant and Golden Bachelor contestant Susan Noles, 66, the pair enjoyed a kiss to cheers from their guests under a rose arch constructed for the ceremony. Gerry and Theresa raised their arms triumphantly after being named husband and wife Gerry kissed his bride Theresa during the live wedding ceremony Theresa got emotional during the wedding ceremony as she talked about finding love late in life Gerry looked into Theresa's eyes while saying his wedding vows to her The Coachella Valley wedding was the finale to ABC's Golden Bachelor series – itself a spinoff from the popular Bachelor and Bachelorette franchises. Like its sister shows, the Golden Bachelor hasn't been without controversy after Indiana 'retired restaurateur' Turner was revealed to be a hot tub maintenance man who sold his last restaurant – a hamburger joint named Mr Quick – in 1985. And despite claiming to have been single since Toni, his wife of 43-years, died unexpectedly in 2017, Turner has, in fact, dated multiple women – even dumping one ex-girlfriend in January 2020 after she allegedly gained weight. Even his romance with Nist didn't go entirely to plan, with a blubbering Turner almost handing the rose to runner-up Leslie Fhima, 64. Ahead of the big reveal, which was screened on November 30, Turner spent one night each with Nist and Fhima – separately telling each woman she is 'the one'. After finally plumping for Nist, a sobbing Turner said of Fhima: 'The only time I've felt this bad in my life is when my wife died and this comes a goddamn close second.' He added: 'I took a really good person and broke her heart.' Despite the drama, the couple have finally got their happy ending, with both looking blissful following the nuptials. The Golden Wedding appropriately took place in the retirement golf haven of La Quinta Resort & Club in La Quinta, California, 25 miles South of Palm Springs On Thursday night, the pair were seen partying with their guests at their reception which included a choice of two wedding cakes – a vanilla, chocolate and cappuccino confection picked by Turner and a lemon and raspberry number chosen by Nist. Dinner began with a selection of appetizers served with cocktails while entrées included steak and halibut as well as a vegetarian option. The Coachella Valley resort of La Quinta has previously hosted Bachelor contestants, with the 2020 season of the Bachelorette also shot at the La Quinta Resort and Club. The 2019 season was also filmed in La Quinta at the Hyatt Regency while in 2003, the resort's Ritz-Carlton hotel was the venue for the first wedding to happen as a result of the franchise. As well as its long association with the Bachelor, the La Quinta Resort and Club also has a storied Hollywood history – including being the spot where director Frank Capra wrote the screenplay for classic adventure movie, Lost Horizon, poolside in 1937. The property is also home to a PGA golf course while La Quinta itself has been dubbed 'the golf capital of the world' due to its smorgasbord of top-class courses. As a result, the hotel has repeatedly welcomed celebrity visitors, among them Kevin Costner, Justin Bieber, Eddie Murphy, Drew Barrymore and Susan Sarandon.",

    "title": "El espectáculo celestial del año: la alineación planetaria histórica que no volverás a ver hasta 2028 si te lo pierdes",
    "text": "Este mes de febrero de 2025, los aficionados a la astronomía y los observadores del cielo tienen la oportunidad de presenciar un evento que no se repetirá hasta dentro de varios años: una impresionante alineación de siete planetas en el firmamento. Conocido como \"desfile planetario\" o \"alineación planetaria\", este fenómeno permite observar simultáneamente a Mercurio, Venus, Marte, Júpiter, Saturno, Urano y Neptuno.\nDe acuerdo con la nota de prensa de la NASA, aunque algunos de estos planetas han sido visibles desde enero, la alineación alcanza su punto culminante el 28 de febrero, cuando Mercurio se une brevemente al espectáculo antes de desaparecer en el resplandor del atardecer. Se trata de una oportunidad poco común para contemplar gran parte de nuestro sistema solar en una sola mirada, algo que ha captado la atención de astrónomos y fotógrafos de todo el mundo.\n¿Qué es un desfile planetario y por qué ocurre?\nEl término \"desfile planetario\" no es un concepto técnico en astronomía, pero se utiliza para describir aquellas ocasiones en las que varios planetas son visibles al mismo tiempo en el cielo. La alineación aparente ocurre porque los planetas orbitan el Sol en el mismo plano, conocido como la eclíptica. Desde nuestra perspectiva en la Tierra, esto hace que parezcan formar una línea o un arco en el cielo nocturno.\nSi bien las alineaciones planetarias no son extremadamente raras, la oportunidad de ver hasta siete planetas a simple vista o con instrumentos básicos sí es un evento poco frecuente. En esta ocasión, cinco de ellos (Mercurio, Venus, Marte, Júpiter y Saturno) serán visibles sin necesidad de telescopios, mientras que Urano y Neptuno requerirán óptica especializada debido a su lejanía y brillo tenue.\nLa mejor manera de ver el desfile planetario\nObservar esta alineación requiere una planificación adecuada. Los expertos recomiendan buscar un lugar con un horizonte despejado, ya que algunos planetas estarán muy cerca de la línea del horizonte al anochecer. Además, cuanto más oscura sea la ubicación, mejor será la visibilidad.\nEl mejor momento para mirar al cielo será aproximadamente media hora después de la puesta del sol, cuando el resplandor del atardecer aún no ha oscurecido demasiado los planetas más cercanos al horizonte. Venus será la referencia más brillante en el cielo, seguido de Júpiter y Marte. Saturno estará más bajo y podría ser difícil de ver sin una vista despejada.\nPara quienes deseen capturar este momento en fotografías, los expertos en astrofotografía recomiendan el uso de cámaras con lentes gran angular y exposiciones largas para captar el máximo detalle posible. De hecho, algunos fotógrafos ya han logrado impresionantes imágenes de esta alineación en distintas partes del mundo, destacando la belleza del cielo nocturno cuando el tiempo y la visibilidad lo permiten.\n¿Qué hace especial a esta alineación planetaria?\nAunque no es la primera vez que varios planetas se alinean, lo que hace única esta configuración es la combinación de tantos mundos visibles al mismo tiempo. Mientras que alineaciones de tres o cuatro planetas ocurren con relativa frecuencia, la coincidencia de siete planetas en el cielo nocturno es mucho más inusual.\nAdemás, este fenómeno coincide con otra posible sorpresa astronómica: la inminente explosión de una nova en el sistema estelar T Coronae Borealis. Este evento podría añadir un punto brillante inesperado en el cielo, compitiendo en espectacularidad con la alineación planetaria.\nPor otro lado, para los más nostálgicos del sistema solar clásico, hay una pequeña decepción: Plutón no será visible durante esta alineación, ya que se encontrará por debajo del horizonte. Desde su reclasificación como planeta enano en 2006, Plutón ha quedado fuera de estos desfiles astronómicos, aunque sigue siendo objeto de interés para los astrónomos.\nSi te la pierdes, tendrás que esperar años\nEste desfile planetario no es un evento de una sola noche. Si bien su punto máximo ocurre el 28 de febrero, la alineación es visible durante varios días. Sin embargo, a medida que avancen las semanas, Saturno se irá desvaneciendo en el resplandor del sol poniente, reduciendo la cantidad de planetas visibles a simple vista.\nPara quienes no logren observar esta alineación, habrá otra oportunidad en agosto de 2025, cuando cuatro planetas estarán alineados en el cielo antes del amanecer. Pero si lo que buscas es una alineación de cinco o más planetas, tendrás que esperar hasta octubre de 2028, cuando otra configuración permitirá ver varios mundos al mismo tiempo.\nUna ventana al universo\nEventos como este sirven para recordarnos nuestro lugar en el cosmos. Mirar hacia el cielo y ver a simple vista a varios de nuestros vecinos planetarios es una experiencia que conecta a la humanidad con el universo de una manera única. La alineación planetaria de 2025 es un recordatorio de que, aunque estamos separados por millones de kilómetros, todos los planetas del sistema solar comparten un mismo recorrido alrededor del Sol.\nSi tienes la oportunidad, sal a observar este fenómeno. No solo es un espectáculo impresionante, sino que también es una oportunidad para reflexionar sobre nuestro lugar en el universo y maravillarnos con la inmensidad del espacio.\nReferencias\n- NASA.\nPlanetary Alignments and Planet Parades.
