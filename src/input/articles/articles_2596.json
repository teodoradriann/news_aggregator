    "title": "La production de Boeing en partie paralysée par sa première grève depuis 2008 - 13/09/2024 à 16:46 - Boursorama",
    "text": "Les syndiqués de Boeing dans la région de Seattle en grève, le 13 septembre 2024 ( AFP / Jason Redmond )\nPlusieurs dizaines de milliers d'ouvriers de Boeing ont lancé vendredi une grève sans précédent depuis seize ans, bloquant notamment la production dans son berceau de la côte nord-ouest américaine.\nL'arrêt de travail a débuté dans le sillage du rejet massif du projet de nouvelle convention collective, négocié depuis le 8 mars par Boeing et l'antenne locale du syndicat des machinistes (IAM-District 751) et qui devait succéder à celle datant de 2008 qui expirait jeudi à minuit.\nLes plus de 33.000 syndiqués de l'avionneur dans la région de Seattle - sur quelque 170.000 employés du groupe - ont rejeté l'accord annoncé le 8 septembre à 94,6% et approuvé un débrayage à 96%, selon Jon Holden, président de l'IAM-District 751.\n\"La grève commence à minuit\", a-t-il lancé lors d'un point de presse jeudi soir, au cours duquel il a annoncé un recours contre Boeing auprès de l'agence fédérale chargée du droit du travail (NRLB) pour pratiques déloyales pendant les négociations.\nJon Holden, président du syndicat IAM-District 751, à Seattle, le 12 septembre 2024 ( AFP / Jason Redmond )\nLa dernière grève chez l'avionneur américain, en 2008, avait duré 57 jours.\nFace au mécontentement des adhérents, M. Holden avait toutefois affirmé ne pouvoir \"garantir que nous obtiendrons davantage en faisant grève\".\nCe mouvement social paralysait dès vendredi matin les deux grandes usines d'assemblage de Renton et d'Everett, qui produisent le 737 MAX - best-seller de Boeing -, le 777 et le 767 (version cargo et ravitailleur militaire), dont les livraisons cumulent déjà les retards.\nLa production d'autres sites, notamment une usine de pièces détachées à Portland (Oregon) tout proche, étaient également à l'arrêt, tout comme le réusinage de dizaines de 787 Dreamliner effectué à Everett depuis plusieurs mois.\nEn revanche, l'assemblage du Dreamliner n'était pas perturbée à ce stade car l'usine se trouve en Caroline du Sud (est) et n'est pas concernée par cette convention collective.\n- \"Chancelant\" -\nDes salariés de Boeing viennent voter pour ou contre la grève, à Renton, dans l'Etat de Washington, le 12 septembre 2024 ( AFP / Jason Redmond )\nL'avionneur encaisse la plus grosse partie du paiement (environ 60%) à la remise des avions. Il peut livrer les avions ayant reçu le feu vert du régulateur FAA avant la grève mais son rythme de production fonctionne au ralenti depuis un incident en vol début janvier sur un 737 MAX 9 d'Alaska Airlines.\n\"Pour un Boeing financièrement chancelant, une grève est la dernière chose dont il avait besoin\", a relevé le site spécialisé dans l'aviation Leeham News,\nSelon les analystes de TD Cowen, une grève de 50 jours priverait Boeing de 3 à 3,5 milliards de dollars de liquidités et aurait un impact de 5,5 milliards sur le chiffre d'affaires.\n\"Le message selon lequel l'accord de principe conclu avec les dirigeants de l'IAM n'est pas acceptable pour ses membres est clair\", a réagi Boeing. \"Nous restons engagés à réinitialiser notre relation avec nos employés et avec le syndicat, et nous sommes prêts à retourner à la table des négociations pour parvenir à un nouvel accord\", a-t-il poursuivi.\nUne semaine après sa prise de fonction le 8 août, le nouveau patron de l'avionneur Kelly Ortberg s'était engagé à \"réinitialiser\" cette relation.\nVers 14H00 GMT, l'action Boeing chutait de 2,66% à la Bourse de New York.\nLes adhérents du syndicat des machinistes IAM-District 751 ont approuvé la grève, le 12 septembre 2024 ( AFP / Jason Redmond )\nLa convention collective rejetée prévoyait une hausse salariale de 25% sur quatre ans, un engagement d'investissements dans la région, ainsi que la construction du prochain avion - annoncé pour 2035 - dans le berceau historique de l'avionneur, ce qui devait assurer des emplois pour plusieurs décennies.\nBoeing espérait que ces concessions suffiraient à esquiver une grève. Sa situation financière est précaire depuis le crash de deux 737 MAX 8 en 2018 et en 2019 (346 morts), et moult problèmes de qualité de la production.\n\"Ce n'est un secret pour personne: notre activité traverse une période difficile, en partie à cause de nos propres erreurs du passé. (...) Une grève mettrait en péril notre reprise commune\", avait prévenu mercredi soir M. Ortberg, exhortant les employés à ne pas \"sacrifier\" les progrès futurs en raison de \"frustrations liées au passé\".\nMais les mécontents jugent la hausse salariale trop éloignée des demandes du syndicat (+40% initialement) et le volet sur les retraites insatisfaisant. \"On nous a bradés\", a lancé jeudi à l'AFP Kamie Bryan, employée chez Boeing depuis 18 ans.\n\"Ils parlent d'une augmentation de 25%, mais ce n'est pas le cas\", a déclaré Paul Janousek, estimant que la présentation par Boeing était \"trompeuse\". Selon cet électricien de 55 ans, dont treize chez Boeing, son augmentation n'atteindrait qu'environ 9% du fait de la suppression d'une prime annuelle.\nSelon le règlement de l'IAM, les grévistes recevront 250 dollars par semaine à partir de la troisième semaine d'arrêt de travail.",

    "title": "Sri Lanka hold their nerve and clinch ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2024 qualification",
    "text": "SL WOMEN TEAM ( SOURCE : X / TWITTER ) The experienced Sri Lanka side was given a run for their money by hosts, United Arab Emirates (UAE), in defence of their 149-run total in the do-or-die clash in the second semi-final of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup Qualifier in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.\nSri Lanka will now play Scotland in the ICC Women's T20 World Cup Qualifier final at the same venue on Tuesday, 7 May.\nSri Lanka were put in to bat first at the toss and openers, Vishmi Gunaratne and captain, Chamari Athapaththu, delivered a sound start in the form of a 52-run partnership, brought up in 7.2 overs. Athapaththu (21) threatened to take the game away from the UAE with some big shots, including two consecutive sixes, but allowed the UAE to breathe a sigh of relief when she was dismissed by leg-spinner, Vaishnave Mahesh (2/33).\nGunaratne then added 44 for the second wicket with Harshitha Madavi (24), but the partnership was broken by Mahesh, who struck again in the 16th over. Gunaratne, who went past Kathryn Bryce as the tournament's leading run-scorer during her 45-run innings (180 runs in five innings), was stumped off a wide ball by Esha Oza (2/27). The right-hander hit five fours in her 44-ball innings.\nAfter Gunaratne's departure, middle-order batters Hasini Perera (15), Kavisha Dilhari (17), and Nilakshi De Silva (18) hit eight boundaries between them in the death overs to take the team to a competitive, 149-run total.\nOza then went on to produce one of the standout innings of the tournament as the UAE gave Sri Lanka a real fight with the bat. She lost her opening partner, Theertha Satish without scoring, in the first over of the chase. Oza then led the second-wicket partnership of 66 runs with Khushi Sharma (22). She added 37 for the third wicket with Kavisha Egodage (16) to keep her team in contention.\nOza played some scintillating shots in her blazing 66 off 44, which included four big sixes as Sri Lanka's bowlers searched for answers. The Islanders got the much-needed breakthrough when the right-hander was bowled out by Udeshika Prabodhani in the 16th over with the score at 108. During the course of her breathtaking innings, Oza went past Gunaratne as the tournament's highest run scorer to date, 189 runs at 47.25.\nThe captain's loss derailed the UAE's chase, the lower-order batters failing to get the required boundaries with Sri Lanka's bowlers and fielders tightening the screws. The UAE's innings continued to stutter until the end of their allotted overs, where they managed 134/7.\nAthapaththu was the best bowler of the night for Sri Lanka with two wickets for 28 in four overs. Sugandika Kumari, Inoshi Priyadharshani and Udeshika Prabodhani took a wicket each.\nScores in brief:\nSecond semi-final:\nSri Lanka beat UAE by 15 runs\nSri Lanka 149 for 6, 20 overs (Vishmi Gunaratne 45, Harshitha Madavi 24, Chamari Athapaththu 21; Esha Oza 2-27, Vaishnave Mahesh 2-33)\nUAE 134 for 7, 20 overs (Esha Oza 66, Khushi Sharma 22; Chamari Athapaththu 2-28)\nPlayer of the Match - Esha Oza",
