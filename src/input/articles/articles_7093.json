    "text": "KYIV, Ukraine: Ukraine said Thursday it had destroyed a Russian warship in the Black Sea off the Crimean peninsula, which has come under increasing Ukrainian attacks. Crimea, which was annexed by Moscow in 2014 and is home to Russia´s Black Sea Fleet, has been extensively targeted by Ukrainian drones and missiles, putting Russia on the defensive. “An enemy missile corvette was destroyed” during the night, Ukraine´s military intelligence agency said in a statement online. Russia made no immediate comment. The Ukraine agency named the vessel as the Ivanovets and claimed the ship was worth up to $70 million. In a night-vision video it published purporting to show the attack, a small vessel is seen approaching the Russian ship, followed by a large explosion and the warship then appearing to start rolling over and sinking. AFP was not able to independently verify the footage or Ukraine´s account of the incident. Kyiv said it happened near Lake Donuzlav — a lake that flows into the Black Sea on the western coast of Crimea. Ukraine also claimed a Russian search and rescue operation after the attack was “not successful”.",
