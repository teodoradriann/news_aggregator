    "text": "Norrie Beats Teammate Boulter's Boyfriend As Britain Down Aussies\nMuhammad Rameez\nPublished December 29, 2023 | 09:04 PM\nBritain eased to victory over hosts Australia in their United Cup opener on Friday with Cameron Norrie defeating Alex de Minaur the boyfriend of British teammate Katie Boulter\nPerth, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 29th Dec, 2023) Britain eased to victory over hosts\nAustralia in their United Cup opener on Friday with Cameron Norrie defeating Alex de Minaur the boyfriend of British teammate Katie Boulter.\nBoulter showed no mercy to Ajla Tomljanovic, who missed 10 months of action this year due to a knee injury, beating her 6-2, 6-4 to clinch victory for Britain in the mixed teams\nevent.\nThe British ran out 2-1 winners as\nAustralia saved some honour in prevailing in the mixed doubles.\nThe winners joined\nSpain, who beat Brazil 2-1 to begin the competition at the 18-team tournament being staged in Perth and Sydney prior to the Australian Open.\nNorrie lifted his level at the end to overcome good friend and training partner Alex de Minaur 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7/2), repeating a victory he earned against the Aussie at the\nevent a year ago.\nSouth Africa-born Norrie, with\nfamily in Australia watching, ended a nine-match loss streak against Top 20 opponents as he beat de Minaur in front of a packed-out local crowd.\n\"I had to dig deep and play bravely in the third set,\" Norrie said after a match that lasted nearly two-and-a-half hours.\n\"At the end of the second set he was\nfiring and I could not match his level.\n\"We always have great battles, I had to run a lot today. But it's good to start the year with a win,\" added the 28-year-old.\nBoulter, ranked 56 in the\nworld, was thrilled to give Britain an unassailable lead on her United Cup debut.\n\"I've been been training well coming in, I've tried to work as hard as I could.\n\"This win starts the year really well. Having the entire team behind really does help you.\"\nEarlier\nworld number 11 Beatriz Haddad Maia got her season off to a winning start, but it was not enough to prevent Brazil losing 2-1 to Spain.\nThe tie came down to a deciding doubles rubber, with Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and Sara Sorribes Tormo defeating Haddad Maia and two-time Grand Slam winner Marcelo\nMelo 6-4, 7-5.\nDavidovich Fokina got\nSpain off to a winning start as he dispatched Thiago Seyboth Wild 6-4, 6-0, requiring four match points to earn the first victory of the tournament.\nHaddad Maia then prevailed by defeating Sorribes Tormo 7-6 (7/1), 6-2 to level the tie at 1-1.\nThe end of the crunch mixed doubles tie was tight, with\nBrazil saving a match point before falling seconds later.\n\"I knew I had to be calm near the end,\" Davidovich Fokina said. \"I needed to focus on every point -- in doubles things can change very quickly.\"\nSpain are playing without Rafael Nadal, with the 37-year-old ending a year-long injury absence at the Brisbane International instead.",

    "title": "Advanced Future Military Laser Achieves UK First",
    "text": "LONDON --- A military laser which could boost the UK Armed Forces with greater accuracy while reducing the reliance on high-cost ammunition has reached its next milestone.\nDuring a trial at the MOD’s Hebrides Range, the DragonFire laser directed energy weapon (LDEW) system achieved the UK’s first high-power firing of a laser weapon against aerial targets. The range of DragonFire is classified, but it is a line-of-sight weapon and can engage with any visible target.\n-- First high-power firing of a laser weapon against aerial targets\n-- Laser boasts pinpoint accuracy and low long-term costs\n-- Partnership with industry making positive progress for UK Armed Forces\nDragonFire exploits UK technology to be able to deliver a high power laser over long ranges. The precision required is equivalent to hitting a £1 coin from a kilometre away.\nLaser-directed energy weapons can engage targets at the speed of light, and use an intense beam of light to cut through the target, leading to structural failure or more impactful results if the warhead is targeted.\nFiring it for 10 seconds is the cost equivalent of using a regular heater for just an hour. Therefore, it has the potential to be a long-term low-cost alternative to certain tasks missiles currently carry out. The cost of operating the laser is typically less than £10 per shot.\nDragonFire is led by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), on behalf of the UK MOD, working with its industry partners MBDA, Leonardo and QinetiQ.\nThis milestone demonstrated the ability to engage aerial targets at relevant ranges and is a major step in bringing this technology into service. Both the Army and Royal Navy are considering using this technology as part of their future Air Defence capabilities.\nDefence Secretary, Grant Shapp said: This type of cutting-edge weaponry has the potential to revolutionise the battlespace by reducing the reliance on expensive ammunition, while also lowering the risk of collateral damage. Investments with industry partners in advanced technologies like DragonFire are crucial in a highly contested world, helping us maintain the battle-winning edge and keep the nation safe.\"\nThe latest milestone builds on a series of highly successful trials, including the first static high-power laser firing of a sovereign UK capability and demonstration of the DragonFire system’s ability to track moving air and sea targets with very high accuracy at range.\nBuilding on this research, the MOD recently announced its intention to fund a multi-million-pound programme to transition the technology from the research environment to the battlefield.\nThe latest trial was sponsored by the MOD’s Defence Science and Technology (DST) organisation and Strategic Programmes and enabled by many other agencies across government, ensuring all regulatory and safety approval requirements were satisfied.\nDstl’s Chief Executive, Dr Paul Hollinshead said: \"These trials have seen us take a huge step forward in realising the potential opportunities and understanding the threats posed by directed energy weapons. With our decades of knowledge, skills, and operational experience, Dstl’s expertise is critical to helping the armed forces prepare for the future.\"\nThe DragonFire weapon system is the result of a £100 million joint investment by the Ministry of Defence and industry. Together, the companies involved are supporting highly-skilled UK jobs in new cutting-edge technologies that are delivering a significant step-change in the UK’s capability in LDEW systems.\nIn 2017 the MOD’s Chief Scientific Advisor’s Research Programme awarded a £30 million contract to the DragonFire consortium to demonstrate the potential of LDEWs.\nDr Nick Joad, DST said: \"This is a really innovative application of science and engineering and is the fruit of sustained investment and effort. DragonFire uses cutting-edge science and technology and delivers much greater performance than other systems of a similar class. DragonFire provides a step-change in our ability to deal with high-performance and low-cost threats.\"\nUK defence is continuing to invest in these game-changing technologies and is advancing the plans which will ultimately bring them into service.\nShimon Fhima, Director Strategic Programmes for the MOD said: \"The DragonFire trials at the Hebrides demonstrated that our world-leading technology can track and engage high-end effects at range. In a world of evolving threats we know that our focus must be on getting capability to the warfighter and we will look to accelerate this next phase of activity.\"\nLDEW research and technology is delivered in partnership and is a cost-effective way of meeting the needs of the MOD while maintaining UK industry’s technology and skills base.\nUK defence is continuing to invest in these game-changing technologies and is advancing the plans which will ultimately bring them into service\n-ends-",

    "text": "All fitness enthusiasts love to try a new workout to change their fitness regimen. And if you want to try a new muscle gain exercise, look no further and try incorporating Bulgarian split squat into your workout routine. The Bulgarian split squat is considered one of the best single-leg exercises. Moreover, the Bulgarian split squat exercise is the most popular and often considered the king of single-leg exercises since it improves balance, strength, and power. This exercise engages many muscles with a focus on the quadriceps when performed with one leg behind you and lifted off the ground. Here are the benefits of Bulgarian split squat and here’s how to perform it correctly. What is a Bulgarian split squat? The Bulgarian split squat, also referred to as \"rear foot elevated split squats,\" or RFESS, is a highly effective leg exercise that targets multiple muscle groups. This exercise involves elevating one foot off the ground while the other leg bears the majority of the weight. This unique unilateral single-leg exercise requires a split stance, stimulating the quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings. By engaging these muscle groups, the Bulgarian split squat can help build strength, improve balance, and enhance overall athletic performance, says fitness expert Mahesh Ghanekar. What are the benefits of Bulgarian split squat? Here are some of the notable benefits of Bulgarian split squats as explained by the expert. 1. Good for glutes If you're looking for an effective exercise to build strength, tone your muscles and butt, Bulgarian split squats are the best choice for you. This exercise targets your glutes and tone your butt. Also Read: Perform these 5 glutes exercises right at home 2. Aids weight loss Bulgarian split squats engage multiple muscle groups and increase heart rate, making them an effective exercise for burning calories and weight loss. 3. Improves your body symmetry In addition to helping you balance your legs unilaterally, strengthening your lower body with moves like the Bulgarian split squat will improve your body's overall symmetry. Plus, this is particularly useful if you're recovering from an injury or trying to correct any muscle or strength imbalances in your body. 4. Increases hip flexor flexibility The Bulgarian split squat allows for a wide range of motion in the hips and knees. Increasing the range of motion can reduce muscle tension and improve hip mobility. 5. Helps to improve running ability Regular Bulgarian split squat workouts will strengthen your leg muscles and improve your running efficiency. Therefore, you need to incorporate this into your training routine if you're an athlete or wish to run faster. 6. Promotes muscle strength Bulgarian split squats are a great way to build muscle and develop your legs while working out. You will get more muscle and single-leg strength the harder you work. This workout will become even more beneficial if you do it with weights. Also Read: Butt kicks: Try this perfect lower body exercise for beginners How to do Bulgarian split squats? Here is a complete guide to Bulgarian split squats. Step 1: Stand in front of a bench or a chair, with eyes and chest forward, shoulders back, core engaged and your feet hip-distance apart. Step 2: Place your right foot on the bench behind you. You can either position your ankle joint on the bench or flex your ankle and balance on the ball of your foot and toe. Step 3: Make sure your feet are still about hip distance apart, if not slightly wider. It will be harder to balance if your elevated foot is right behind your front foot. Step 4: Keep in mind that the engagement and movement of the exercise are all centred on the front leg and your back foot is only there to assist you in maintaining your balance. Step 5: Lower down while keeping your right knee and ankle naturally bent. Engage your core while keeping your chest up and your eyes forward. This will prevent your back leg from bearing the entire weight of the activity. Step 6: As you lower the leg, keep the load evenly distributed on your left foot. Hinge slightly forward at the hips, keeping your left knee aligned with your left toe (don't cave in or bow out). Step 7: Take a deep breath and lower the leg until your left quadriceps is almost parallel to the floor. Step 8: Go back to the initial position, using your left quad and glute to power the upward phase of the exercise. As you push yourself to a standing position, breathe. Step 9: Do desired repetition on one side and move on the other side. This completes one set. Also Read: Not ready for cardio or strength training? You can start with these 5 quad stretches Common mistakes to avoid while doing Bulgarian split squat Here are some of the common mistakes to keep in mind while doing the Bulgarian split squat. 1. Putting the back leg directly behind the front If you place your back foot directly behind your front foot, you'll have trouble balancing during the workout. This is already a unilateral balancing challenge because your front leg powers the action; you must maintain balance while lowering yourself into a squat predominantly supported by your front foot. 2. Using the back leg to support movement Always remember that the Bulgarian split squat is a single-leg squat. While the back leg is intended to aid in balance, it isn't necessary to be engaged to perform the exercise, making it more of a lunge. 3. Allowing the front knee to lose alignment One common and important error made when performing the Bulgarian split squat, as with all squat and lunge variations, is to allow the front knee to move inward or outward, out of alignment with the same-side toes. Particularly in single-leg exercises when one leg is supporting both the weight and the resistance, this puts far too much strain on the knee, so be cautious while performing this exercise. Are there any side effects of doing the Bulgarian split squat? It does not have side effects unless the posture is wrong. When done correctly, it doesn't impact your body in a bad way. However, If you have knee or ankle pain or an injury that limits your flexibility and mobility, this workout is not appropriate for you. Plus, If you experience any pain or discomfort when performing the split squat variation exercise with your back foot balanced on the floor, you should stop. Make sure you consult your doctor and trainer before adding any new exercises to your fitness routine.",

    "text": "Trump «vale» 6,1 miliardi di dollari, quest'anno più ricco grazie a Truth\nLa ricchezza di Donald Trump è aumentata di 3,6 miliardi di dollari, con il presidente-eletto arrivato a valere 6,1 miliardi grazie alla sua quota nel Trump Media & Technology Group, la società a cui fa capo il social Truth. A fare i conti è Forbes, secondo il quale Trump all'inizio dell'anno valeva 2,5 miliardi.\nIn marzo il presidente-eletto si è arricchito con la quotazione di Truth, arrivando a valere fino a sette miliardi. In aprile invece le quotazioni di Truth hanno perso terreno, «impoverendo» temporaneamente il tycoon. In maggio però la sua fortuna è schizzata fino a otto miliardi con il rally del suo social in Borsa, prima di calare nuovamente quando è stato rinvenuto colpevole da una giuria di New York di 34 capi d'accusa per i soldi alla pornostar Stormy Daniels. Nei mesi successivi si sono susseguiti alti e bassi, fino a un assestamento della sua ricchezza a 6,1 miliardi.\nSecondo i calcoli di Forbes, Trump spende in media - sulle base dei dati che vanno dal 2010 al 2019 - 130 milioni di dollari l'anno. I suoi primi quattro anni alla Casa Bianca lo hanno arricchito, con le sue attività che hanno realizzato 2,4 miliardi di dollari di ricavi e 550 milioni di utile fra il 2017 e il 2020.",
