    "text": "\nThe cover of the report\nCONVERTS from Islam are being put under pressure to leave Iran by the Shia regime, Christian charities concerned with religious freedom report.\nThe charities — Open Doors, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, Middle East Concern, and Article 18 — presented their findings in a joint report, Faceless Victims: Rights violations against Christians in Iran 2024. It was lanched on Tuesday at an event at Portcullis House, Westminster.\nConversion from Shia Islam, evangelism, teaching in Sunday school, and being a member of a house church are all punishable offences under the penal code of the Islamic Republic founded in the 1979 Iranian revolution.\nChurches pre-dating the revolution — namely Assyrian and Armenian churches — are officially recognised, the report says, but, “unlike other places of worship”, four Persian-language Anglican churches have remained closed since the pandemic.\nWorshippers at these churches, the report says, “have been forced to congregate in private gatherings”, which are illegal.\nThe report analyses information from Christian networks in Iran. It says that at least 166 Iranians were arrested last year for offences relating to the practice or spreading of the Christian faith; and 21 were imprisoned for an average of two years. This compares with at least 134 arrests in 2022.\nHouse churches, the report says, are facing “increased digital surveillance”, while more Christians are being forced to attend Islamic “re-education”.\nIt also says that some converts who are imprisoned and then released are “actively encouraged” to emigrate “by intelligence agents, usually after they have refused to return to Islam or to accept a job as a spy of the Ministry of Intelligence”.\nThe news director for Article 18, Steve Dew-Jones, told the Church Times this week: “It is common practice for jailed Christians to be told they have just two choices upon release: to recant their faith and work for the authorities as spies within house churches, or to leave the country.”\nFor those who decline these options, he said, “work and education options will be closed off to them; they will be monitored to ensure they don’t have any further contact with other Christians. . . It is also common for these Christians to be threatened that they and their family members may suffer an ‘accident’.”\nThe 40-page report gives examples of systematic abuse, including the case of a Christian who was detained arbitrarily, another who arrested without being informed of the charges against her, and another who was told that his guilty verdict had been decided before his court hearing.\nThe report was published in the wake of accusations, led by the former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, that churches in England had been “facilitating industrial-scale bogus asylum claims” (News, 9 February). This has been fervently denied by senior church leaders (News, 16 February).\nHome Office figures suggest that, between June 2016 and 2022, more people claiming asylum in the UK were Iranian than any other nationality. In the year to June 2023, Iranian nationals were the third most common nationality to claim asylum in the UK, making 7776 applications, the Home Office reports. In 2019, the House of Bishops authorised a Persian translation of the service of holy communion for the increasing numbers of Iranians in congregations (News, 8 March 2019).\nThe charities behind Faceless Victims estimate that Iranian Christians make up a “significant portion” of the more than 15,000 Iranian asylum-seekers in Turkey. They argue that the Shia regime is contravening 11 articles of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a signatory, and call on Iran to release “immediately and unconditionally” all Christians “detained on charges relating to their faith and religious activities”.\nThe report also urges Iran to “clarify where Persian-speaking Christians may worship freely in their mother tongue, without fearing arrest and prosecution”.\n08 Dec 2023\n14 Oct 2022\n15 Sep 2023\n17 Jan 2024\n01 Dec 2023\n02 Feb 2024\n23 Feb 2024\n21 Feb 2024\nSneering at a new Live Aid show has political repercussions, argues Paul Vallely\nThe Bishop of Chichester acting on behalf of the Archbishop of Canterbury seeks a priest of prayer and spiritual insight,\nThe Benefice of Sawbridgeworth seeks to appoint a locally funded Associate Minister (House for Duty)\nWe are a 6 church benefice located in NE Lincolnshire, near the beautiful Lincolnshire Wolds and east coast.\nFind more jobs\n11 March 2024 | 6pm GMT\nAn expert panel discusses trust between the media and the public\nOnline Tickets available\n26 - 28 April 2024\nSee the full programme on the festival website.\nEarly bird tickets available\nClosing date: 30 June 2024\nRead more details about the awards\n ",

    "title": "New Jersery Works to Expand Labor Protection for Cannabis Workers",
    "text": "New Jersey lawmakers recently advanced a bill that would expand labor protections for workers in the cannabis industry. If enacted, the measure—which provides stronger union organizing rights, protections for employee representation and collective bargaining, and a clear prohibition on unfair labor practices—would have profound implications for cannabis industry employers.\nQuick Hits\n- New Jersey lawmakers have advanced a bill to provide stronger labor protections for cannabis industry workers, aligning their rights with those covered by federal and state labor laws.\n- The proposed legislation would empower the State Board of Mediation to enforce unfair labor practice charges and expand union organizing rights and collective bargaining protections for cannabis workers.\n- If enacted, the measure would enforce prohibitions against unfair labor practices by cannabis employers and grant unions greater access to engage with employees.\nOn June 30, 2025, the New Jersey Assembly passed Assembly Bill (A) No. 4182, which now must be considered by the New Jersey Senate. The bill comes amid a significant expansion of the industry after New Jersey legalized recreational marijuana use with the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (CREAMMA) of 2021.\nNew Jersey law already provides some labor protections for cannabis industry workers. However, there is a question as to whether some workers involved in the cultivation or harvesting of cannabis fall under the “agricultural laborer” exemption to the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).\nA4182 seeks to ensure that all workers in the cannabis industry, including those working for medical and recreational licensed cultivators and dispensaries, have similar labor protections to those provided by the NLRA and similar to those provided to public employees under the New Jersey public employment relations law and the Workplace Democracy Enhancement Act (WDEA). Specifically, the bill would enhance organizing and union rights, empower state authorities to enforce unfair labor practice (ULP) charges, and increase potential penalties for noncompliance.\nKey Terms\nThe bill would define a “[c]annabis employer” as a private employer that is an authorized medical cannabis cultivator, manufacturer, distributor, or dispensary. It would also apply to “[c]annabis worker[s],” defined as employees of a cannabis employer who are not subject to the NLRA.\nState Board of Mediation\nSpecifically, A4182 would expand the responsibilities of the State Board of Mediation in the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development (Board) to cover employment in the cannabis industry not covered by the NLRA. The Board would have “exclusive power” to prevent anyone from engaging in any listed ULP and bring enforcement actions against alleged violators. The Board would be required to adopt regulations for selecting majority representatives, negotiation procedures, grievance resolution, and other employment terms.\nThe bill would further provide workers employed by cannabis employers with rights and protections equal to those provided to other workers regarding employee representation, collective bargaining, and unfair labor practices.\nUnfair Labor Practices\nThe bill would prohibit cannabis employers and their representatives from engaging in unfair labor practices, such as:\n- interfering with or coercing employees in their exercise of rights granted by the bill;\n- “[d]ominating or interfering” with employee organizing;\n- discriminating against employees for exercising their rights;\n- “[r]efusing to negotiate in good faith with a majority representative of employees”; and\n- violating board regulations.\nSimilarly, it prohibits organizations representing or seeking to represent cannabis workers from engaging in unfair practices against employees or employers.\nOrganizing Protections\nNotably, A4182 contains several protections for cannabis employee organizing and requirements for cannabis employers with regard to employee representatives. Specifically, the bill would grant employee majority representatives or unions the right to access cannabis employers’ premises to meet with employees, investigate grievances, and conduct meetings. The bill would also require employers to provide contact information of employees to the employee organization and to facilitate payroll deductions for union membership dues.\nThe bill would further grant organizations representing cannabis workers “the right to engage in publicity.” Notably, this right would include “picketing … for the purpose of truthfully advising the public, including consumers, that products or the ingredients of products are produced by a cannabis employer with which the organization has a dispute,” even if the publicity “has the effect of requesting the public to cease patronizing businesses which distribute or sell those products.” (Emphasis added.)\nFines and Penalties\nA4182 would increase the potential penalties for cannabis employers found to be in noncompliance with the law. The bill would increase the maximum daily fine from $1,000 to $5,000 for each day that an employer failed to provide the required information to the Board or otherwise prevented the Board from carrying out its responsibilities.\nAdditionally, the bill would allow for the imposition of other remedies, such as:\n- reinstatement of employees who were discharged or discriminated against;\n- payment of any wages lost due to discrimination;\n- payment of reasonable costs of action; and\n- liquidated damages equal to the wages due.\nIf enacted as proposed, the legislation would empower the Board to order a cannabis employer found to have violated the law to “make whole the employee organization for any losses suffered by the organization as a result of the violation.”\nNext Steps\nA4182 aims to ensure that cannabis workers have the same protections and rights as other workers, particularly with regard to collective bargaining and protections against unfair labor practices. The New Jersey Assembly has advanced the bill, but the New Jersey Senate must still pass it. It is unclear whether the bill will gain traction in the Senate now. The bill would take effect immediately upon its enactment into law.",

    "text": "Autoridades do governo de Israel recusaram nesta quinta-feira (26) a proposta feita por Estados Unidos e França de cessar-fogo com o grupo extremista libanês Hezbollah. O ministro israelense das Relações Exteriores, Israel Katz, afirmou que não haverá um cessar-fogo, e o chanceler Benjamin Netanyahu confirmou que a ideia foi descartada.

    "text": "All products and services featured are independently chosen by editors. However, StyleCaster may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.\nWith all the different sneaker bra n ds out there, it can be difficult to determine what’s actually worth the money. So what if a celebrity was spotted wearing a pair? What we want to know is if these shoes will give us blisters, provide arch support, and last us for years to come. That’s why StyleCaster’s commerce team wanted to share an honest review of Cariuma sneakers . This company gets a lot of hype — and yes, is beloved by everyone from Helen Mirren to Pete Davidson — but are the shoes really that good?

After putting a few pairs to the test, we’re convinced this brand has nailed the combination of cute and comfortable, while also being well-made and eco-friendly . Ahead, check out everything you need to know about Cariuma, along with which sneaker styles StyleCaster editors highly recommend.\nTable Of Contents The best sneakers to buy from Cariuma, at a glance: Why is Cariuma so popular?

View More\nThe best sneakers to buy from Cariuma, at a glance: White LWG Leather/Black & Green Salvas , $129 White Polka Dots Canvas Oca Low , $89 Black Premium Leather & Suede/Black Salvas , $129 Black Contrast/Ivory Catiba Pro Low , $89 Off-White Knit IBI Low , $119 Why is Cariuma so popular? Part of the reason why Cariuma sneakers are so popular does have to do with the celebrities who wear them. Pete Davidson, Dame Helen Mirren, John Hamm, and Whitney Port are just a few recognizable names that enjoy slipping into these shoes. However, Cariuma also famously combines comfort with classic styles and prides itself on putting sustainability first. There are a handful of sneakers for men, women, and kids, all of which are made from ethically-sourced, raw materials and come with a reasonable price tag (nothing is over $200).\nAre Cariuma shoes comfortable? Cariuma’s founders, David and Fernando, launched the brand in 2018 with comfortability in mind . The goal for them is to create shoes that are “lightweight, durable and come with that perfect already broken-in fit.”\n“We knew the industry-standard ‘cool-classic’ sneakers were really uncomfortable and that the big corporations weren’t socially responsible and didn’t really care about sustainability in an active way,” they shared on Cariuma’s website .\nThe sneakers are made up of soft, easy-to-wear materials and include supportive mamona oil and bio-based cork inserts along with slip-resistant, natural rubber soles .\nAre Cariuma shoes eco-friendly? Yes, Cariuma uses raw materials such as organic cotton, bamboo, and sugarcane to make its designs, and some pairs even include recycled nylon and recycled plastics. Materials are dyed with non-hazardous, Bluesign-certified chemicals and the brand packs its products in recycled and recylable boxes. For every shoe sold, Cariuma also plants two trees in the Brazilian rainforest.\nCariuma Sneakers: White LWG Leather/Black & Green Salvas Colorways available: 13\nSizes available: 5-13\nMaterial: Premium leather\n“These constantly sold-out sneaks are, in fact, worth the hype (and the wait). Similar to Stan Smiths, these sneakers have that effortless, minimalist feel to them while also providing tons of room for feet — they’re the perfect shoe to throw on when you’re in a hurry and don’t feel like untying and re-tying (looking at you, Old Skool Vans — I love you, but it takes years to put you on!).\nTheir comfort is definitely their biggest selling point aside from looks. Made from premium leather, they’re soft and flexible without ever feeling flimsy. The sole is 100 percent slip-resistant (they ARE a skater shoe, after all), and the insole is made from removable cork and bio-based foam, so they’re also earth-friendly on top of everything.\nI’ve been wearing my Salvas for about two years, and they’re in fantastic shape. I’ve taken them to Disneyland (clocking 25,000 steps), worn them while running errands all day, and paired them with my cutest brunch outfits. They’re great for long walks as well as just a relaxed vibe. They’re the ultimate everyday shoe you can feel good about investing in. And they don’t wear down easily!”\n— Gina Vaynshteyn, Senior Commerce Director\nWhite LWG Leather/Black & Green Salvas $129 Buy Now Cariuma Sneakers: White Polka Dots Canvas Oca Low Courtesy of Cariuma, Samantha Sutton Colorways available: 18\nSizes available: 5-13\nMaterial: Cotton canvas\n“Typically, it takes a few wears for me to break in a pair of shoes, so when I realized I’d only packed Cariuma’s Oca Low sneakers for a weekend away, I experienced a brief moment of panic. As I walked up and down the streets of New York City, getting in a week’s worth of steps over the course of two days, I waited for blisters to form on the backs of my ankles. Then I realized they weren’t coming.\nThe brand really nailed that soft, broken-in feel, and unlike other my canvas sneakers, these were comfortable from the moment I put my foot inside . They even blocked my feet from feeling the wind, which is pretty impressive considering the temperature was in the 40s.\nPersonally, I’m all about simple designs, and while this pair satisfies my need for a crisp white shoe, I thoroughly enjoy the polka-dot pattern, which adds something extra to my outfits while still being neutral enough to mix with other prints. The thick, natural rubber sole is also one of my favorite features. It’s almost like a platform but easier to walk in, and I felt super supported as I made my way over uneven sidewalks, squeezing through crowds of people.”\n— Samantha Sutton, Commerce Writer\nWhite Polka Dots Canvas Oca Low $89 Buy Now Cariuma Sneakers: Black Premium Leather & Suede/Black Salvas Courtesy of Cariuma, Maya Gandara Colorways available: 5\nSizes available: 5-13\nMaterial: Premium leather and suede\n“Two words came to mind when I first slipped into the Cariuma Salvas sneakers: instant comfort. While the brand has garnered a ton of buzz for quite some time (celebrities like Pete Davidson and Helen Mirren are even fans), I’d yet to give it a go. But I’m so glad I finally did — sneakers that don’t require a ton of break-in time are hard to find, but these remained pain-free from the beginning.\nAs someone who lives in New York City, my shoe collection needs to be both supportive and comfortable (and stylish, too, let’s be honest), and these hit all the marks. They didn’t feel stiff on my feet like most pairs do during the initial wear time, and to this day I’m never left feeling sore after being out and about in them all day long.\nPlus, designed from LWG-certified premium pebbled leather, the sneakers are crafted to only look better the more you wear them — and that’s an investment well spent. While the Salvas shoe comes in a variety of white-based designs, I went with the sleek, all-black pair. They look good with jeans, leather pants or skirts, and are polished enough to wear out on the town to bars or simply during errand runs.”\n— Maya Gandara, Commerce Editor\nBlack Premium Leather & Suede/Black Salvas $129 Buy Now Cariuma Sneakers: Black Contrast/Ivory Catiba Pro Low Courtesy of Cariuma Colorways available: 12\nSizes available: 5-13\nMaterial: Triple-stitch, premium suede and organic cotton canvas\n“Not only do the Catiba Pro sneakers look good, but they also feel extremely comfortable. The kicks feature mamona oil and bio-based cork inserts and completely slip-resistant natural rubber soles. As soon as I stepped into these shoes, I could feel the arch support and knew I’d be able to wear them all day long. Per usual, I was right. The memory foam insole is everything. I lace them up for everything from errands to the office to travel, and my feet have never ached or blistered.\nI ordered mine in a 6 and would say they fit pretty true to size. However, if you prefer your toes to have some extra wriggle room, don’t hesitate to go up half a size.\nNow that I’ve been rocking these shoes for over a year now , I can confidently say they’ve become my go-to sneakers — plus, they still look like they’re in mint condition. I like them so much that I even gifted a pair to my mom, and trust me, she loves them just as much as I do.”\n— Katie Decker-Jacoby, Associate Commerce Editor\nBlack Contrast/Ivory Catiba Pro Low $89 Buy Now Cariuma Sneakers: Off-White Knit IBI Low Courtesy of Cariuma, Samantha Sutton Colorways available: 15\nSizes available: 5-13\nMaterial: Perfect-fit Bamboo Knit (bamboo and recycled plastics)\n“While I know these shoes are better suited for everyday activities rather than fitness, I was still shocked when I opened up my box of Cariuma IBI sneakers and immediately spotted the cork insole. It didn’t seem like something that would be very comfortable or supportive, but I was wrong.\nIt turns out that part (which is also removable) includes memory foam and Mamona oil as well, which makes it thick and squishy to the touch rather than thin and flimsy.\nI have a few pairs of knit sneakers sitting in my closet, but the IBI might be my favorite. It’s nice that they’re made from self-regenerating bamboo and recycled plastics, but I’m most impressed with how breathable and light they are. Plus, most of my knit sneakers are thin and form-fitting, which is something I’m not really a fan of — they look weird when I style them with oversized pieces, as if I have extra-tiny feet. These are a little larger in appearance without looking bulky and oversized, and can perfectly balance out wide-leg jeans and loose-fitting sweats.”\n— Samantha Sutton, Commerce Writer\nOff-White Knit IBI Low $119 Buy Now",

    "text": "Haley Cavinder reversed her commitment to TCU on Thursday, saying she was returning to Miami after a year off. Haley and twin sister Hanna Cavinder played three seasons at Fresno State, then transferred to Miami for the 2022-23 season. After the Hurricanes' run to the Elite Eight in the 2022-23 season, the twins announced their retirement to pursue other interests. But last fall, Haley Cavinder announced her plan to play in 2024-25 at TCU, using her final season of eligibility. On Thursday, a day after Hanna said she was heading back to Miami for one final lap, Haley Cavinder said on social media that she would be putting on the Hurricanes uniform again. \"Given the news yesterday that my sister was returning to play ball at Miami and after careful consideration and thought, I've decided to return to the University of Miami and play with Hanna for our final and 5th year,\" Haley Cavinder, 23, announced on social media. \"There is nothing more important than family and the bond I share with my Twin sister. Being presented with the opportunity to play together one more time is something I cannot pass up. I am excited for this upcoming season and can't wait to play at the U.\" Haley Cavinder was a three-time All-Mountain West selection at Fresno State. In her one season at Miami, she averaged 12.2 points, 4.9 rebounds and 2.5 assists in 35 starts. In her college career, she has played in 124 games (122 starts) and has averages of 16.7 points, 7.2 rebounds and 3.8 assists. ",

    "text": "L'ONG Action contre la faim (ACF) a pris en charge au moins 2 096 enfants malnutris, en l’espace d’une année, dans la zone de santé de Punia (Maniema). C’était dans le cadre du Projet de réponse d'urgence en matière de nutrition et sécurité nutritionnelle. Ces résultats sont salués par les autorités sanitaires, administratives et la communauté locale, à Punia. Le coordonnateur du PRONANUT, Dr Musa Bikulobyanse s’est réjoui que 1.789 enfants sont guéris sur plus de 2000 pris en charge. « L'insécurité alimentaire, les épidémies et d'autres aléas sont les causes favorisant la malnutrition à Punia », a-t-il fait savoir. Dr Musa Bikulobyanse s’est dit satisfait de constater que l’ACF a respecté le protocole et atteint les indicateurs de suivi et d’évaluation des activités. L'instruction aussi a été donnée aux différents prestataires parce que ACF a laissé les intrants pour couvrir au moins deux mois et les prestataires sont instruits de gérer ces intrants en bonne et due forme. La communauté plaide pour la pérennisation de ces activités. « Avec ce que ACF venait de nous présenter, je suis très ravi puisque ACF a dépassé même la cible. ACF a sauvé des vies des enfants et récupéré de nombreux enfants qui devraient mourir ici à Punia », a rapporté le président de la société civile de Punia, Christophe Kamwanga. Environ 425 enfants restent sous suivi de l’ACF malgré la fermeture du projet avec un stock d'intrants de deux mois.",
