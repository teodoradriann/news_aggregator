    "text": "Meteo in Campania, dopo la tregua delle feste, arriva un’ondata di maltempo e gelo: ecco fino a quando\nMeteo in Campania, dopo la tregua delle feste, arriva un’ondata di maltempo e gelo: ecco fino a quando\nDopo un periodo di relativa stabilità atmosferica, caratterizzato dall’anticiclone delle Azzorre che ha dominato le festività natalizie, l’Italia si appresta a fronteggiare un brusco cambiamento delle condizioni meteorologiche. Le previsioni indicano l’arrivo di una doppia perturbazione che porterà piogge, temporali e un sensibile calo delle temperature, con la possibilità di gelo su tutto il territorio nazionale.\nSecondo gli esperti meteorologici, già da venerdì 3 gennaio una prima perturbazione interesserà il Mediterraneo, portando precipitazioni anche a Napoli e in Campania. Questa fase di maltempo proseguirà anche nella giornata di sabato 4 gennaio, con l’arrivo di correnti di aria polare sospinte da venti meridionali, intensificando la sensazione di freddo.\nUn secondo sistema perturbato è atteso per domenica 5 gennaio, con venti forti che potrebbero influenzare negativamente anche la giornata dell’Epifania. Questo peggioramento segnerà una vera e propria svolta climatica, aprendo la strada a un’ondata di gelo che si concretizzerà nel weekend successivo.\nTra il 9 e il 10 gennaio si prevede un progressivo abbassamento delle temperature, che culminerà tra il 12 e il 13 gennaio con l’arrivo di un flusso freddo di origine nord-atlantica. Questa massa d’aria gelida intensificherà ulteriormente il freddo già presente, con la concreta possibilità di nevicate anche a bassa quota su buona parte del territorio italiano.\nNonostante le proiezioni attuali indichino un’ondata di freddo significativa soprattutto a metà gennaio, gli esperti invitano alla prudenza. Data la distanza temporale, è necessario attendere ulteriori aggiornamenti e conferme per avere un quadro meteorologico più preciso e affidabile. In ogni caso, è consigliabile prepararsi ad affrontare un periodo di instabilità e basse temperature, con particolare attenzione alle possibili conseguenze del gelo e delle nevicate.",

    "text": "VAR could not determine whether the ball had gone out of play before West Ham’s goal against Arsenal (Photo: Amazon Prime)\nGary Neville couldn’t help but troll Arsenal fans after the Gunners conceded another controversial goal during their match with West Ham.\nArsenal shockingly went behind early on at the Emirates on Thursday night after Tomas Soucek found the back of the net, but there was a long delay before the goal was given.\nVAR were checking to see whether Jarrod Bowen had kept the ball in play in the build-up to the goal, and as the camera angles couldn’t find conclusive evidence that it had gone out, it was given.\nIt did look incredibly close however, and bought back memories of the goal Newcastle scored in their victory over Arsenal earlier this season, which sparked Mikel Arteta’s infamous rant about referees.\nOn that occasion, the camera angles being used appeared to show the ball going out of play but nothing was conclusion, though it was later revealed from a different angle it had stayed in.\nNeville took time on Sky Sports to demonstrate how the situation had played out and after Arsenal fans began to fume over Soucek’s goals, he cheekily tweeted an image from that segment showing how the ball hadn’t crossed the line.\nSoon after, he responded to a Gunners supporter who replied to his tweet with: ‘You were the worst full back in the PL [Premier League]’.\nThe Manchester United legend replied: ‘Agreed but great at goal line technology’ before later adding: ‘On a positive note for Arsenal the front 3 are playing narrower and closer to each other to combine. They look dangerous!’\nFormer referee Mark Clattenberg, speaking on Amazon Prime, explained why West Ham’s goal was not ruled out, saying: ‘The on-field decision is a goal, so they have to find conclusive evidence that the ball has gone out of play.\n‘From the angles I have seen, the ball looks to be slightly in play.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nNever miss a beat throughout the season or transfer window with weekly Arsenal news updates, exclusives and analysis.

    "text": "Centurion: You can’t bowl without teeth for close to a hundred overs and bat without skin in the game for two innings and expect to win Test matches.\nA showing of such unaccountability will not fetch you sessions or games anywhere in the world, let alone in South Africa.\nThe Indian team was left to digest that easy-to-understand-but- difficult-to-process truth on Thursday as they lost by an innings and 32 runs at the SuperSport Park.\nOh, how quickly the tides change!\nA few days ago, India were talking about history, talking about having what it takes to become the first of their kind to win a series in South Africa.\nThere was some apprehension after the first day where they were down to 208 for 8, but the second day’s KL Rahul-inspired push to 245 made it seem alright.\nThen Dean Elgar’s 185 happened. Then Marco Jansen’s unbeaten 84 happened. Then South Africa’s 408 all out in 108.4 overs happened.\nThen - if all that wasn’t humbling enough - India’s second innings of 131 all out in 34.1 overs happened.\nBy the way, this is after they ‘rebuilt’ the innings courtesy Virat Kohli’s 82-ball 76.\nIndia were down three wickets in 16 overs before tea, and less than ten overs after that, they were down another three wickets. At this point, the scoreboard read 96 for 6.\nAt the non-striker’s end when India’s sixth-wicket (Ashwin) fell was Kohli. He was so enraged by his partner’s loose cut to gully that he flung his gloves on the ground and turned away with a mouthful.\nIt’s quite possible that Kohli would have known at that very moment that India were not going to bring South Africa out to bat again.\nIndia were trailing South Africa by 67 runs at the time while attempting to overcome a 164-run deficit.\nGoing by how the South Africans batted for nearly 459 minutes, one would have assumed that India could, objectively, get those runs and possibly even add to it.\nTurns out, South Africa’s run glut had more to do with how poorly the Indian bowlers bowled than it did with how well they batted.\nEvidently so because from the time the Proteas came onto bowl in the second innings, it was apparent that they were just better at exploiting these conditions.\nJust as they had in the first innings, the four horsemen of the orchestrated apocalypse - Kagiso Rabada, Nandre Burger, Marco Jansen and Gerald Coetzee - kept it simple, kept it tight and kept it in areas which the Indian batters couldn’t resist.\nRohit is the only batter in the line-up who can possibly turn around and say that he couldn’t do much about his dismissal. It was Rabada angling the ball in and shaping it away at the last moment to knock the off stump out.\nIt was similar to the ball which got rid of Kohli in the first innings, but this wicket was in the optics and the subsequent impact.\nYashasvi Jaiswal was unsure of a bouncer from Burger and ended up gloving it to the ’keeper. Guilty.\nShubman Gill looked good for a while and then let the ball go between his bat and pad in search of an expansive drive. Guilty.\nShreyas Iyer’s feet were stuck in concrete on a drive and ended up inside-edging it onto the stumps. Guilty.\nRahul threw his hands at a full and wide delivery and nicked it to Aidan Markram. Guilty.\nThe rest didn’t matter because, by this time, India’s fate was written. Kohli stuck around, bolstering his Test numbers, but at the stroke of 5 pm SAST, he flat-batted one over the Jansen’s head. Rabada ran it down from long-on and threw in a dive to complete a fine catch. That’s what commitment looks like. India will want to try it at some point.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 28 December 2023, 21:13 IST)",

    "text": "Advertisement\nUpdated March 27th 2025, 19:54 IST\nLayoffs in 2025: Infosys, Block, IBM Among Firms Cutting Workforce | Full List Inside\nAmid economic challenges and AI advancements, companies like IBM, Boeing, Infosys, CNN, and Block have massively cut jobs in 2025.\nNew Delhi: In the wake of ongoing economic challenges, recession and advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Several major companies have recently announced job cuts, including IBM, Boeing, Infosys, CNN, Dropbox, Block, Adidas, and BlackRock. Despite these reductions, sectors like AI, fintech, and big data are expected to see growth by 2030.\nThis wave of mass layoffs around the globe has not left India untouched. On March 26, software giant Infosys terminated approximately 30 to 45 trainees from its Mysuru campus after they failed to pass internal assessments.\nLayoffs in 2025: List of Companies Laying off their Employees\nBlock: Jack Dorsey’s financial technology company, plans to lay off nearly 1,000 employees while implementing other operational changes in its second such move in just over a year. The layoffs will affect more than 930 employees, with nearly 200 managers transitioning into non-management roles, and around 800 open positions being closed.\nDorsey, who co-founded and previously ran Twitter before co-founding Block in 2009, informed employees of the upcoming cuts on Tuesday via an email titled “smaller block,” which was viewed by the Guardian.\nInternational Business Machines: IBM, known as ‘Big Blue,’ is reportedly cutting jobs across various U.S. locations as part of an ongoing workforce reduction in the tech industry. The company’s decision follows a wave of layoffs this year affecting thousands of employees.\nAccording to The Register, IBM’s job cuts are targeting around a quarter of its workforce within its Classic Cloud operations. While the exact number of affected employees remains undisclosed, the layoffs are expected to impact thousands. IBM has yet to make an official announcement on the matter.\nBoeing: On February 8, Boeing announced plans to cut 400 roles from its moon rocket program due to delays and rising costs associated with NASA's Artemis moon exploration missions. A spokesperson stated that impacted employees will receive 60-day notices of involuntary layoffs in the coming weeks.\nInfosys: Software giant Infosys terminated approximately 30 to 45 trainees from its Mysuru campus on March 26, after they failed to pass internal assessments. However, the company is offering alternative career paths to the affected trainees, including a 12-week training program for potential roles in Infosys Business Process Management (BPM).\nIn addition, Infosys is providing impacted trainees with a one-month ex-gratia payment and a relieving letter. For those who choose not to pursue the BPM course, the company has offered to fund further training to help them explore other career opportunities.\nAdidas: In January, Adidas announced plans to reduce its workforce at its headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany, potentially cutting up to 500 jobs, according to CNBC. This would represent nearly a 9% reduction in the headquarters' workforce, which currently employs around 5,800 people, as per the Adidas website.\nThe announcement of the layoffs came shortly after Adidas reported better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2024, surpassing its profit expectations. Despite strong financial performance, the company proceeded with the workforce reduction as part of ongoing restructuring efforts.\nCNN: CNN announced a reduction of about 200 television-focused roles, accounting for approximately 6% of its workforce, as part of a shift toward a digital-first strategy. In a memo sent to staff on January 23, CNN CEO Mark Thompson emphasized the need to \"shift CNN's gravity towards the platforms and products where the audience themselves are shifting\" to secure the company’s future as a leading global news organization.\nBlackRock: In January, BlackRock informed employees of plans to cut around 200 jobs from its 21,000-strong workforce, according to Bloomberg. However, these reductions are offset by the addition of 3,750 new hires last year and another 2,000 expected in 2025. BlackRock's president, Rob Kapito, and COO, Rob Goldstein, stated that the layoffs were part of an effort to realign the firm's resources with its strategic goals.\nAmid ongoing economic uncertainties and restructuring across industries, the wave of mass layoffs in the tech sector continues without indication of slowing down.\nPublished March 27th 2025, 19:54 IST",
