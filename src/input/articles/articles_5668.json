Los individuos hablaban con los menores y les pedían fotos íntimas. Haciéndose pasar por menores de edad, periodistas de T13 contactaron a los pedófilos, quienes les comenzaron a pedir fotos íntimas a través de los mensajes. Un individuo aseguró ser peruano pero estar viviendo en Francia. El sujeto le ofreció dinero virtual, que se utiliza en el videojuego Free Fire, a cambio de realizar acciones sexuales a través de una videollamada. \"Depende de lo que hagas. Si haces... el esto... y te tocas así, serían 5.000 (diamantes, monedas del Free Fire)\", solicitó el individuo.

La reacción del individuo fue simplemente guardar silencio, para después de unos segundos cortar la videollamada. En otro caso expuesto en Reportajes T13, apareció un sujeto de nacionalidad boliviana, quien aseguraba que tenía 18 años y ofrecía recompensas para un videojuego, pero con la condición de que la supuesta menor de edad se quite la ropa durante la videollamada. Al momento de ser encarado, el individuo se mostró sorprendido, apagó su cámara y, posteriormente, decidió cortar la llamada. Según se conoció durante el reportaje, la situación ha ocurrido en distintos videojuegos, tales como Roblox, Fortnite, Minecraft o League of Legends, las cuales serían las más recurrentes.

    "text": "A NSW berry farm has grown the world's heaviest blueberry. Weighing 20.40 grams and measuring 39.31 millimetres, the fruit has officially broken the [Guinness World Record title](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/heaviest-blueberry) set in 2020 by a 16.20 gram Western Australian blueberry. The record-breaking blueberry was picked at Costa Berries' farm in Corindi, on the Mid North Coast, in November 2023 and grown by Brad Hocking, Jessica Scalzo and Marie-France Courtois. Mr Hocking said the blueberry was from the Eterna variety which is known for its large fruit size, crisp texture and long shelf life. \"When we picked this one there were probably around 20 other berries of a similar size,\" he said. \"This really is a delightful piece of fruit. \"While the fruit is large, there's absolutely no compromise on quality or flavour as would be expected when developing a premium variety blueberry.\" The Costa Group said its variety improvement program develops one or two new varieties of blueberries on average each year. It licenses Costa bred varieties overseas such as the Americas, Morocco, China and south east Africa. Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date. We care about the protection of your data.

    "text": "Sports\nNBA Announces Exciting Cade Cunningham News, Fans React\nThe Detroit Pistons have really turned their franchise around. After finishing at the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings in the past two seasons, they are now in contention for an automatic playoff spot.\nEntering Wednesday's game against the Miami Heat, Detroit boasts a 38-31 record for the sixth seed in the East. They are five games ahead of the seventh-seeded Atlanta Hawks, giving them a pretty good cushion amid their postseason bid.\nSure enough, however, the Pistons wouldn't have had that much success had it not been for their superstar, Cade Cunningham.\nCunningham has been sensational so far this 2024-25 season, even making his first All-Star Game. He has averaged 25.6 points, 6.0 rebounds and 9.3 assists through 64 outings so far this campaign.\nFurthermore, the NBA announced on Wednesday before the Pistons-Heat clash that Cunningham is actually just the third player in league history to have at least 4,300 points, 1,000 rebounds and 1,400 assists in their first 200 games.\nNBA legend Oscar Robertson and now Los Angeles Lakers star Luka Doncic are the other two.\n\"DETROIT'S MOTORCADE,\" the NBA wrote on X. \"Cade Cunningham joined Oscar Robertson (1960-63) & Luka Dončić (2018-21) as the ONLY players to tally at least 4,300 PTS, 1,000 REB, and 1,400 AST through their first 200 games!\"\nDETROIT'S MOTORCADE.\n— NBA (@NBA)\nCade Cunningham joined Oscar Robertson (1960-63) & Luka Dončić (2018-21) as the ONLY players to tally at least 4,300 PTS, 1,000 REB, and 1,400 AST through their first 200 games![pic.twitter.com/lVYjcvMv5K][March 19, 2025]\nNaturally, the news stirred excitement among fans, with many heaping praise on the young guard.\n\"Cade Cunningham is in elite company,\" a commenter wrote. Another one said, \"Cade Cunningham is driving full speed ahead in Detroit!\"\n\"The future is looking bright for Detroit's star,\" a fan added.\n\"This is epic!\" a follower shared, along with a fire emoji.\n\"Cunningham is insane,\" a poster noted. A social media user further stated, \"That's very impressive.\"\n\"This is greatness,\" a seventh supporter said.\nCade Cunningham has certainly proven in this 2024-25 season that he deserves to be in the conversation among the league's best players today. And at 23 years old, he definitely has plenty of room to grow.\nAs fans have said, the future is looking great for Cunningham and the Pistons.\nRelated: Slow-Mo Video of Cole Anthony's Dangerous Collision With Jaden Ivey Emerges\nCopyright 2025 The Arena Group, Inc.

Al final solo serán los dos”. Veamos ahora por partes, dicho enunciado. Tus hijos se van. Empecemos diciendo que nosotros como pareja, un día abandonamos el nido, el hogar formado por nuestros progenitores, y a su vez, ellos hicieron lo mismo en relación a sus padres… y así ha sido y será siempre en forma sucesiva. Desde luego, razón no le falta a Khalil Gibrán, el poeta y filósofo libanés, cuando en un apretado resumen de su poema, dice: “Tus hijos no son tus hijos, son hijos e hijas de la vida ansiando vivir por sí mismos… Tú eres el arco del cual tus hijos como flechas vivas son lanzados. Deja que la inclinación en tu mano de arquero sea para la felicidad”. En mi caso, de mis tres hijos, dos ya están casados y tienen su propia descendencia, y el tercero vive en el extranjero. Tus padres se van. Por supuesto, un día desaparecen físicamente. De hecho, por cuestión de edad y precedencia, esto es lo que suele ocurrir, pero ojo, no necesariamente, pues a veces toca el infortunio y son los hijos quienes primero recorren ese ignoto camino. En este apartado, mis padres ya descansan en paz y confío, que puedan gozar de la vida eterna. A propósito, ¿qué pasa cuando se abrazan el amor y la muerte? ¿Se muere el amor? ¿O se enamora la muerte? Tal vez la muerte moriría enamorada y el amor amaría hasta la muerte. En todo caso, nunca mejor dicho, ese pensamiento aborigen australiano: “Todos estamos de visita en este momento y lugar. Solo estamos de paso. Hemos venido a observar, aprender, crecer, amar y volver a casa”. Tus amigos se van. Ya sea porque fallecen, o, por el contrario, se van apartando de nuestra vida, con o sin razón, en este último caso, porque ya no les interesa mantener la amistad. Y en este punto tengo claro que, si alguien quiere entrar a tu vida, que entre. Si alguien quiere salir de tu vida, que salga. Pero no permitas que se queden en la puerta… porque estorban. De hecho, muchas son las personas que cambian con el tiempo… o el tiempo te muestra lo que en realidad son. Igual, te prometen estar ahí para lo que necesites, pero mira a tu alrededor a ver cuántos lo han cumplido. Al final, esto tiene su propia moraleja, y es que algunas personas pasan por nuestras vidas para enseñarnos a no ser como ellas. Acaso será por ello, que de vez en cuando sea necesario sacudir el árbol de la amistad para derribar la fruta podrida. El dinero se acaba. Es como una llave abierta, sobre todo, si no sabes administrarlo bien. El cuerpo cambia… El paso de los años es inexorable, no solo porque ahora peinas canas o se te arruga la piel, sino lo que es peor, te enfrentas con los achaques propios de la edad… Sobre este particular viene a mi memoria la siguiente fábula del poeta y escritor colombiano, Luis Alberto Padilla Pardo: “Una vez decidí dar un paseo debajo de mi cama para preguntarles a los monstruos de mi infancia por qué ya no me visitaban por las noches como antes. Cuando finalmente los encontré, les dije: Viejos amigos, ¿cómo están? ¿Por qué ya no me visitan? ¡S ! Se supone que ya no debes hablarnos. Ya no eres un niño, ahora eres un adulto. Me secaron las lágrimas que se desbordaban de mis ojos y se despidieron diciendo: Te tocará duro a partir de ahora, porque los monstruos más feroces estarán haciendo ruido dentro de ti”. Al final solo serán los dos. Ilustrémoslo con un relato. “Un esposo fue a visitar a un sabio consejero y le dijo que ya no quería a su esposa y que pensaba separarse. El sabio lo escuchó, lo miró a los ojos y solamente le dijo una palabra: Ámala, luego guardó silencio. Pero es que ya no siento nada por ella. Ámala, repuso el sabio. Y ante el desconcierto del señor, después de un oportuno silencio, el viejo sabio agregó lo siguiente: Amar es una decisión, no un sentimiento; Amar es dedicación y entrega, amar es un verbo y el fruto de esa acción es el amor”. “El Amor es un ejercicio de jardinería: arranque lo que le puede hacer daño a su jardín, prepare el terreno, siembre, sea paciente, riegue y cuide. Esté preparado porque habrá plagas, sequías o excesos de lluvias, más no por eso abandone su jardín. Ame a su pareja, es decir, acéptela, valórela, respétela, dele afecto y ternura, admírela y compréndala. Eso es todo, ámela”. Cuida a tu pareja. No existen expadres, exhermanos, ni hay exfamilias. Tu pareja requiere de cuidado especial para que nunca sea expareja. Por último: “Si le vas a hacer una cirugía a tu mujer para verla más bella, primero hazte una cirugía en el corazón para tratarla mejor”.",

    "text": "Kool-Aid Man Viral Trend Is Back In New York Causing Residents A Lot Of Money\nDid you know that the fruit flavored drink Kool-Aid has been around since the 1920's? The brand's ambassador, Kool-Aid Man, started busting through walls in television commercials in the 1950's and in 2024 the band Bring Me The Horizon even released a song called 'Kool-Aid\".\nToday there is a, not-so-cool, 'Kool-Aid Man Tik-Tok Challenge, which popped up in New York a few years ago only to return in 2025. This challenge is when, mostly young, people literally run through a neighborhood fence like Kool-Aid Man would but causing real-life property damage.\nI recall watching Saturday morning cartoons and seeing Kool-Aid commercials showing a kid yell \"hey Kool-Aid\" and Kool-Aid Man would bust through the wall of a bowling alley, kid's bedroom, any wall really and say 'oh yeah\"!\nAccording to NBC New York the trend is back and busting through fences in New York State.\nA busted up fence is not insignificant. Fence pricing varies quite a bit depending on which materials are used, style of fence and how much yard are you fencing in. For an average half-acre property you could pay as much as $10,000 for a new fence.\nWhatever happened to kick the can, red light/green light or spirited game of tag?\nIf You Grew Up in the '70s and '80s, These Foods Were Super Fancy\nGallery Credit: Stephen Lenz\nTop 200 '70s Songs\nGallery Credit: UCR Staff\nLOOK: 79 of the Most 1970s Photos You've Ever Seen\nGallery Credit: Stephen Lenz",

    "title": "10 times Kris Jenner's fashion choices left fans confused and offended",
    "text": "Kris Jenner's ultimate fashion choices have left fans in a questioning state.\nHollywood's favourite momager, Kris Jenner, has perfected the art of finding the best spotlight for her daughters, but sometimes that mark has missed her. Though Kris's style rarely misses the mark and can be described as bold and maximalist, there have been a few outfits from the past that have left fans confused and questioning.\nThe diva has definitely had some extremely notable fashion moments in her past, from her Toys For Tots Benefit look from Escada Margaretha in 1990, to a butter yellow Oscar De La Renta number at the 2022 Met Gala, a look ahead of today's trends, Kris has takes the cake in leaving an impact with her bold fashion choices.\nHere are 10 times the Kardashian-Jenner Matriarch has left her fans confused and offended:\nAll Metallic Concert look\nYes, the theme of Beyonce's Renaissance tour was metallics, silver and fringes, but maybe the Jenner mama dropped the ball in this one. The all silver look comprised of a silver trench coat, silver shoes, metallic pants, silver mesh like top, silver bag and, well you get the gist, making the look a tad on the nose, especially for a concert, a simple black or white tee or pants could have cut down the excess and given a nice contrast to the look.\nMET Gala 2019\nThe theme for the 2019 Met Gala was \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\", and Kris was definitely going for something daring with her Tommy Hilfiger look and platinum blonde bob, but compared to her other iconic MET looks, she may have dropped the ball on this one. The look was quite camp, going with the vibe of every gala, but it was veering more on the side of kitschy than anything else and given the theme, it seemed too costumy.\nKris Jenner during the 2002 ESPY Awards\nFor the 2002 ESPY (Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly) Awards, the icon attended the event with her ex-partner, Caitlyn Jenner, sporting a lacy little black dress with a signature yellow-and-purple Lakers leather jacket on top. The jacket was for sure on theme for the event, but it might have been a little too adventurous to pair it with a lacy black formal dress. Maybe a pair of black trousers, white shirt and black tie would have worked out better for the overall vibe, especially since the socialite has dropped some major pant suit looks over the years.\nVacation Mode Kris\nThough the Jenner mom drops major fashion week, red carpet looks, maybe casual looks are not something she has quite figured out. Decked out in a casual kaftan-style dress on a yacht, Kris was giving full vacation mode. The kaftan was made in the iconic Pucci print fabric and exhibits stunning and vibrant summer colours. However, the look seemed a bit lacklustre when donned by Kris Jenner.\nKris Jenner hot pink pants\nAnother controversial look of Kris that received quite a bit of backlash from the internet was this hot pink skinny jean look that she wore in 2012. The look consisted of a leather detail jacket, hot pink skinny pants, leopard print booties, square sunglasses and chunky silver jewellery. The outfit was definitely time appropriate with he 2010s statement jewellery pieces and the 2000s reminiscent love for leopard print, however, the look would work more for a 20-year-old Kim. According to one user,\n“She is a garish attention-seeker. She dresses too young for her age.”\nKris's Sportswear look\nMaybe sportswear and streetwear are not strong suits for the 69-year-old, as she tried to pair a cardigan with a half-zip hoodie inside. The combination of knitwear with sportswear was definitely brave. The pop of colour overall looked great; however, when closely analysed, something seems amiss. The strings of the hoodie definitely clash against the cardigan.\nKris at the 2010 Primetime Emmy Awards\nFor the 2010 Primetime Emmy Awards, Jenner was decked out in a one-shoulder patterned black and white belted dress with a black metallic geometric clutch, black chunky earrings, silver studded ring and black peep-toe studded heels. The dress had a retro-esque vibe to it, and the outfit featured many early 2000s trends, but for a red carpet that was as grand as the Emmys, the look was not for lack of a better word grand enough. Granted, the family was still not as big as it is today, and her red carpet style has evolved over the years; Jenner was not a stranger to the grandeur of major event styling.\nJenner at the Last Action Hero Premiere, 1993\nKris Jenner walked the Last Action Hero Premiere carpet with her partner in an all white look that tried to balance a formal carpet look with chunky, kitschy accessories. The all-white ensemble was a combination of an oversized white blazer and loose white trousers, which were very appropriate for the time period. However, the pantsuit was paired with a sheer white top with a V-shaped covering around the chest, making the sleek and chic outfit look a bit gaudy, especially paired with the gold charm waist chain.\nKris at The Hollywood Reporter’s Women In Entertainment Breakfast, 2015\nDecked in an all black gothic look, Jenne was spotted at the 2015 Hollywood Reporter’s Women In Entertainment Breakfast, wearing Anna K. As much as she likes to dress campy, the look overall didn't make quite a lot of sense, especially given the event and the fact that it was a day program. The design also didn't quite fit right on the entrepreneur, who usually stuns in black. The stockings also felt like overkill.\nKris at the People’s Choice Awards, 2021\nBeing a winter event, the momager was definitely dressed for the part in a velvet crimson suit set. However, the lighter shade of the top inside the top added a touch of tackiness to the entire look. A darker top or a contrasting colour would have helped break down the overwhelming impact of the look. She could have also achieved that with a statement bag or chunky rings.\nBut no matter what, at the end of the day, every celebrity faces fashion faux pas in their very public lives; in fact, it comes with the territory. However, it's more about Kris Jenner's aura and recovery that make her a true style icon.\nLove movies? Try our Box Office Game and Movie Grid Game to test your film knowledge and have some fun!",

Ja’Mar Chase se ausenta al Training Camp de los Bengals por qué quiere nuevo contrato ¿Por qué Ja’Marr Chase está ausente en las prácticas de los Bengals?: Esto es todo lo que necesitas saber sobre la situación contractual del receptor de 24 años OHIO. Estados Unidos.- La temporada baja de la NFL ha sido agitada para los receptores abiertos, y Ja’Marr Chase no ha sido la excepción. En medio de rumores sobre un nuevo contrato, el receptor estelar de los Cincinnati Bengals se perdió su segunda práctica consecutiva. Esta situación se da en un contexto donde los contratos de jugadores clave están en el centro de la atención. Bengals WR Ja’Marr Chase is not participating at practice for the second straight day.— Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) He’s currently seeking a new contract. [pic.twitter.com/stDbsc7WtX] [July 25, 2024] Ja’Marr Chase y los Rumores Contractuales - Según Kelsey Conway del Cincinnati Enquirer, Chase, que estaba en la banca durante la práctica, ha estado ausente en los entrenamientos recientes, lo que ha generado especulaciones. - Adam Schefter de ESPN ha reportado que Chase tiene un salario base de $1 millón de los $4.86 millones totales que ganará esta temporada. - El receptor está buscando un nuevo acuerdo que refleje su valor en el campo. La Situación Contractual de Tee Higgins - Chase no es el único receptor abierto en el ojo del huracán en Cincinnati. Tee Higgins también está lidiando con una situación contractual complicada. - Higgins jugará la temporada 2024 bajo la etiqueta de franquicia después de no alcanzar un acuerdo para un nuevo contrato. - Aunque no recibió el intercambio que solicitó, ha manifestado su deseo de seguir contribuyendo al equipo, a pesar de la incertidumbre. Zac Taylor said he’s comfortable with his plan and communication with Ja’Marr Chase but wouldn’t comment specifically on if he expects him to participate in camp at some point and if this is contract related— Kelsey Conway (@KelseyLConway) [pic.twitter.com/JTs53U0PL4] [July 25, 2024] Comparación con otros receptores abiertos - La búsqueda de un nuevo contrato por parte de Chase no es sorprendente, especialmente con el reciente mercado de receptores abiertos. - Justin Jefferson renovó su contrato con un promedio de $35 millones por año, mientras que otros receptores como A.J. Brown, Amon-Ra St. Brown y Jaylen Waddle también aseguraron extensiones significativas. Desempeño de Ja’Marr Chase en la NFL - Chase, elegido con la quinta selección del draft de la NFL de 2021, ha demostrado ser uno de los receptores más productivos. - Ha superado las 1,000 yardas en cada una de sus tres temporadas y ha sido seleccionado al Pro Bowl en cada una de ellas. - En la temporada pasada, registró 100 recepciones, 1,216 yardas y siete touchdowns en 16 partidos. Ja’Marr Chase ha jugado 3 temporadas para los Bengals. Tiene 268 recepciones para 3,717 yardas y anotó 29 touchdowns.

    "text": "In questi ultimi giorni, con riferimento allo sciopero generale di oggi, si sta parlando molto di precettazione. Tuttavia, in pochi sanno di che cosa si tratta e cosa comporta il suo mancato rispetto. Per fare chiarezza su questo tema ha risposto Vincenzo Ferrante dello Studio legale Daverio e Florio specializzato in diritto del lavoro e della previdenza. Cosa si intende per precettazione e quando viene attuata Si tratta di un ordine rivolto ai lavoratori, perché riprendano il servizio in relazione al quale è stato proclamato lo sciopero, garantendo in questo modo che l’astensione si svolga fornendo comunque ai cittadini prestazioni minime. Il potere di precettazione è attribuito al Presidente del Consiglio dei ministri o a un Ministro da lui delegato (spesso quello dei Trasporti) ovvero al Prefetto , in caso di conflitti locali e deve essere esercitato solo all’esito di un confronto con i sindacati che hanno proclamato lo sciopero.\nL’ ordine di precettazione si può anche solo limitare a posporre il momento dello sciopero ad altra data , anche unificando astensioni collettive già proclamate, ovvero anche prevedere la riduzione della sua durata complessiva. Cosa succede se non viene rispettata? Un tempo si prevedeva per i lavoratori una sanzione penale, in quanto ordine dato dall’autorità di governo; la legge del 1990 prevede ora solo una sanzione economica per i lavoratori che, individuati come destinatari, non si presentino al lavoro, stabilendo anche (ad ulteriore tutela del diritto individuale di sciopero) che quanti non ottemperino alla precettazione non possano mai essere licenziati a ragione del solo mancato rispetto dell’ordine ricevuto.\nIn qualche caso, come a Milano alcuni anni fa, in occasione di uno sciopero dei trasporti, il Sindaco chiese alla procura di perseguire gli autisti per interruzione di pubblico servizio, ma il procedimento fu archiviato per la difficoltà di individuare esattamente quanti erano stati raggiunti dall’ordine di precettazione, che in genere viene reso noto mediante i media o (utilizzando un sistema che risale ad un passato lontano) attraverso l’affissione dell’ordinanza nei luoghi di lavoro, e solo in occasioni eccezionali viene direttamente comunicato ai singoli destinatari. Quali conseguenze ha sui lavoratori e, eventualmente, i sindacati? Sono previste sanzioni economiche non solo per i lavoratori, ma anche per i sindacati e per le associazioni e gli organismi di rappresentanza degli autonomi o dei professionisti e piccoli imprenditori (tassisti, farmacisti, autotrasportatori etc.) che non ottemperino all’ordinanza di precettazione. Poiché la sanzione è molto elevata (si può arrivare teoricamente anche sino a 50.000 euro) è abbastanza raro che l’ordine non sia rispettato. Poiché la legge tutela utenti e cittadini, anche le imprese che non favoriscano la ripresa del servizio possono essere assoggettate a sanzioni.",
