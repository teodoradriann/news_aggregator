    "title": "New Study Reveals Genetic Variants Linked to Lassa Fever Severity | Psychreg",
    "text": "Scientists have identified specific human genetic variants that significantly influence the fatal outcome of Lassa fever, a severe haemorrhagic illness. This breakthrough, emerging from a comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS), sheds light on the long-standing mystery of why some individuals suffer severe consequences from Lassa virus (LASV) infection while others experience mild or no symptoms. The [findings](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01589-3) were published in the journal Nature Microbiology. Lassa fever is a grave public health threat in West Africa, characterised by its alarming fatality rates and unpredictable clinical outcomes. Caused by the Lassa virus, the disease is notorious for its varied manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe conditions leading to death. The illness typically starts with symptoms such as fever, vomiting, and cough, which can escalate to respiratory distress, mucosal bleeding, and multiorgan failure. The study, conducted over a period of seven years in Nigeria and Sierra Leone, involved 533 cases of Lassa fever and 1986 population controls. It focused on understanding the role of human genetic variation in determining the severity of LASV infection. Utilising techniques like GWAS, seroprevalence surveys, and functional characterisation assays, the researchers aimed to unravel the genetic underpinnings of susceptibility to the disease and its fatal outcomes. Scientists identified genome-wide significant variant associations with Lassa fever outcomes near the genes GRM7 and LIF in the Nigerian cohort. These genes are believed to play critical roles in the disease’s progression. The study also revealed that a haplotype bearing signatures of positive selection, overlapping the LARGE1 gene – essential for LASV entry into cells – is associated with a decreased risk of Lassa fever in the Nigerian population but not in the Sierra Leone cohort. The Lassa virus is primarily transmitted to humans through exposure to aerosolized particles from rodent excrement, with Mastomys natalensis, a rodent species prevalent in many West African regions, identified as the main host. Despite the high seroprevalence of LASV, the majority of infections are undocumented, often resulting in mild symptoms. This phenomenon has long puzzled the scientific community. This research marks a significant advancement in our understanding of Lassa fever, especially in the context of the clinical heterogeneity of the disease. The identification of genetic factors that influence disease severity paves the way for new strategies in treatment and prevention. The findings also underscore the importance of considering genetic factors in the clinical management and public health strategies for Lassa fever. Conducting research on Lassa fever, especially in resource-limited settings, poses significant challenges. The team dealt with issues like small sample sizes, the complexity of case and control definitions, and the impact of environmental variables. Moreover, the genetic diversity of LASV and the insufficient characterization of genetic diversity in African populations added layers of complexity to the study. The study’s outcomes are crucial for guiding future therapeutic and preventive measures against Lassa fever. It also opens avenues for further research into the genetic basis of susceptibility to other infectious diseases, particularly in African populations. The insights gained from this research could lead to more effective interventions and a deeper understanding of infectious diseases’ pathogenesis.",

    "text": "Excitement is at its peak in the preparation for the match between Jaguars and Titans in the 18th round of the NFL. Jaguars (9-7) chief strategist Doug Pederson has a clear mission: defeat the Titans and capture a second consecutive AFC South title. Meanwhile, the Titans (5-11), who have already been eliminated, look to finish the season with respect, marking the departure of personalities like Derrick Henry and Ryan Tannehill under their existing contracts. To offer an even more interesting perspective, we have entered the world of artificial intelligence. Using data collected by BARD, the AI gives us a detailed forecast on this exciting encounter. strategies underway Pederson’s uncompromising focus is clear: winning over Tennessee. Last season, the Jaguars prevented the Titans from winning the division, and now, with the playoffs looming, they are determined to repeat the feat. Tannehill resumed the starting role due to Lewis’ injury, and his positive history with Henry makes for a tremendous combination. Ball security has been key for the Jaguars, who have played eight times without a turnover, culminating in a 6-2 run in those games. Trevor Lawrence’s approach from distance could prove beneficial after ball security issues. Meanwhile, Travis Etienne and Calvin Ridley are trying to surpass 1,000 yards against the Titans, despite their early expectations. Bittersweet farewell to the Titans This matchup is also the final game for Derrick Henry, who turns 30 and looks to become the NFL’s all-time leader in rushing yards. Although the Titans are out, Henry remains a key player and the team will want to say goodbye with respect. AI forecast BARD’s artificial intelligence gives us a fascinating insight into the possibilities. As per the given information, Jaguars’ probability of victory is 60%, while Titans’s probability is 37%. A tie at 3% is a remote possibility. most likely markers - Jaguars 31-24: This score reflects the Jaguars’ home advantage and current good form. The probability of this outcome is 23%. - Jaguars 24-21: A close score that shows the Titans’ potential for a surprise. The probability of this outcome is 20%. - Jaguars 21–20: Closest score, indicating the game could be very close. The probability of this outcome is 12%. These predictions are exciting, but let’s remember that American football is unpredictable and actual results may vary. conclusion The anticipation of a showdown between the Jaguars and the Titans is obvious. With artificial intelligence shedding light on the obstacles, fans can prepare for a show full of excitement, master strategies and unforgettable moments. The fate of the Jaguars in the playoffs and the departure of key personalities on the Titans will be intertwined in this important chapter of the NFL. Get ready for an epic battle on the field!",

Notable cold spots include Purulia and Darjeeling. The northwesterly to northerly winds are contributing to these chilly conditions, impacting both the plains and sub-Himalayan regions.\n- Country:\n- India\nThe Met office forecast indicates that cold wave conditions will persist across western West Bengal districts until December 15. Residents should prepare for colder-than-usual weather due to prevailing northwesterly to northerly winds.\nIn districts such as Purulia, East and West Bardhaman, Birbhum, Bankura, Jhargram, and West Midnapore, temperatures are expected to remain below normal, plunging 2 to 4 degrees Celsius lower. The Himalayan region in Darjeeling recorded notably low temperatures, reaching a frigid 1.0 degrees Celsius.\nKolkata, the capital, experienced a minimum temperature of 14 degrees Celsius, whereas areas in the western part of south Bengal saw temperatures fall at least 5 degrees below the average.\n(With inputs from agencies.)",
