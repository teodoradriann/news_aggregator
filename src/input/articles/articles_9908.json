Healthy skin should be soft, smooth, and clear instead of greasy, flaky, or rough. Your dog's health and nutrition have an impact on the luster and texture of his or her coat from the inside out, as well as regular grooming and skin care. All dogs will benefit from routine grooming to remove loose hairs and dead skin cells, as well as dirt, debris, and external parasites. The frequency of grooming will depend on your dog's coat type and length, as well as any health concerns. Double-coated dogs, for example, should be brushed daily to prevent matting and remove dead hair from the undercoat. Dogs with short coats may only need weekly brushing, while those with long or curly coats may require daily or even twice-daily brushing to prevent tangles and mats. Whatever the coat type, all dogs need occasional baths to remove dirt, debris, and any potential irritants from their skin. The best dog shampoos are designed to cleanse without stripping natural oils, leaving your pup's coat soft, shiny, and healthy-looking. How often should I shampoo my dog? This is a common question that pet parents have. The answer depends on your dog's individual needs and lifestyle. Some dogs may need to be shampooed as often as once a week, while others can go months between baths. If your dog spends a lot of time outdoors, or if they have skin allergies, they may need to be shampooed more often. Talk to your veterinarian about how often you should shampoo your dog based on their individual needs. Now that you know how often to shampoo your dog, the next question is: what kind of shampoo should you use? There are many different types of dog shampoos on the market, and it can be confusing to try to figure out which one is best for your pet. Do the Best Smelling Dog Shampoos have Oatmeal in them? The answer is that some do and some don't. It really depends on your dog's individual needs. If your dog has sensitive skin, you may want to look for a shampoo that contains oatmeal, as it can help to soothe and protect the skin. If you're looking for a shampoo that will leave your dog's coat looking and smelling great, there are many to choose from. We've featured our top 25 best options for your dog today, but there are so many more available online.

Why does my dog smell so quickly after a bath? This is a question that many dog owners ask themselves. After all, you just spent an hour bathing your pup and they already smell again. There are a few reasons why this may be happening. First, it could be the type of shampoo you're using. If it's not formulated for dogs, it might not be getting rid of all the dirt and bacteria that's on their skin and coat. Second, you might not be rinsing them off properly. Make sure you're using warm water and rinsing until the water runs clear. Finally, they may just have a naturally oily coat that needs to be washed more often than other dogs. What dog shampoo smell lasts the longest? There is no definitive answer to this question as each dog's sense of smell will be different. However, some of the most popular scents used in dog shampoos include lavender, eucalyptus, and citrus. Ultimately, it is up to the pet owner to decide which scent they think their dog will like best. Some dog owners may also prefer to use unscented shampoos on their pets. This is often done for dogs with sensitive skin or allergies. There are a number of unscented dog shampoos on the market that still cleanse and condition the coat effectively. What dog shampoo helps with odor? Pupper Shampoo Coat helps the best with odor. That's why we included them as number one on our list of the 25 best smelling dog shampoos in 2022. This shampoo is made with natural ingredients. Pupper Shampoo is also safe for dogs with sensitive skin, as it is free of harsh chemicals. To use Pupper Shampoo, simply wet your dog's coat and apply the shampoo from head to tail. Lather well and rinse thoroughly. For best results, use Pupper Shampoo once or twice a week. What is the most popular dog shampoo scent? The most popular dog shampoo scent is lavender. This floral scent is not only pleasant for people, but many dogs seem to enjoy it as well. Lavender is also thought to have calming properties, which may be beneficial for dogs that are anxious or stressed. There are a number of lavender-scented dog shampoos on the market, so pet owners should have no trouble finding one that suits their needs. How can I make my dog smell good between baths? There are a few things you can do to keep your dog smelling fresh between baths. The first is to brush them regularly. This will help to remove any dirt and debris that may be trapped in their fur. You can also use a pet-safe dry shampoo in between baths to help absorb any excess oils. Finally, make sure to give them a good rinse after each walk to remove any dirt or mud that they may have picked up. How often should you bathe a dog? How often you should bathe your dog will depend on a few factors, such as their coat type and activity level. Generally speaking, most dogs only need to be bathed every few weeks. However, if they are particularly active or have a lot of fur, they may need to be bathed more frequently. Are you supposed to wash a dog's face? YES! You should always wash your dog's face with a shampoo that is made specifically for dogs. Dogs have very sensitive skin, so it is important to find a shampoo that will not irritate their skin. You should also avoid using human shampoos on dogs, as they can be harmful to their health. Do dogs feel better after a bath? It's no secret that dogs hate baths. Most of them will do anything to avoid it. But does that mean they don't feel better after a bath? The answer is complicated. While some dogs may not enjoy the process of getting a bath, most of them do feel better afterwards. This is because baths can help remove dirt, debris, and other irritants from their fur. So, if your dog is in need of a bath, don't hesitate to give them one. Just be sure to use a shampoo that's designed for dogs. Not all shampoos are created equal, and some can actually be harmful to your pup. Final Thoughts on 25 Best Smelling Dog Shampoos in 2022 When it comes to finding the best smelling dog shampoo, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, consider what your pup's needs are. If they have sensitive skin, you'll want to find a shampoo that is gentle and won't irritate their skin. Second, think about what scent you want. There are many different scents available, so you should be able to find one that you and your pup will love. Finally, don't forget to read the reviews before purchasing a shampoo.

    "title": "Eliminating Notions and Attachments | Falun Dafa - Minghui.org",
    "text": "(Minghui.org) Before the age of forty, I had many challenges in life and also many doubts about my existence. These two factors together caused me to develop many rigid notions about life and “how things are.” Add to this the heavy tribulations due to karma from previous lives, and you get the situation I was in before I obtained Dafa: I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Childhood Trauma When I was young, it was early years of the Chinese Communist Party rule. Class struggle was promoted, people were divided into various groups, and landlords and rich peasants were subjected to social discrimination and persecution. My father belonged to this targeted group. As an outlet for his emotions, he became hot-tempered and vicious—there was almost nothing beneath him except the taking of a human life. Life was hard. My parents fought a lot. As the oldest of six children, I became the prime target for my parents’ frustration and stress. I was blamed for everything and anything, and treated like a servant. At mealtimes, I had to serve everyone and stand there while everyone else sat down. If I was slow, I’d be slapped, beaten, or hit with whatever was within reach. My father beat me so savagely that the neighbors even stepped in to stop him; both they and I wondered if I was really his child. To please my parents, I did all the household chores and took good care of my younger siblings. But that did not change the way they treated me. Gradually, I became fearful, resentful, argumentative, and insecure. Not only I did not know how to speak up, but I did not know what to say. There was a fear that disaster would befall me at any moment, but also a deep resentment of people being unreasonable. Between these two emotions, I felt trapped and had no way to escape. The only thing that seemed like a solution was to somehow grow more powerful than the people who bullied me, so I was determined to get ahead. My ambition for fame and fortune was thus born. My personality changed for the worse, and after I got married, the demonic side of my personality manifested itself at home and work. I hurt a lot of people and gained a lot of karma, which jeopardized both my physical and mental health. I don’t think I could have made it to today if I didn’t find guidance within Falun Dafa. At age 22, things got a little bit better for me when I became the only person in my family who passed the exam to go to school and get a job. My family was proud of me for the first time. However, this only intensified my desire for fame, profit, and achievement. Changing Notions and Eliminating Attachments After I got married, I seemed free from the harm from my parents, but the trauma I endured over the years had already distorted my psyche in profound ways. I developed a strong pursuit of comfort, a good life, and avoiding hardship. After I began practicing Dafa, I realized that all the pain I endured was the karma that I had accumulated over many lifetimes. I also understood that these hardships were there to pave the way for me to obtain Dafa. But the notions and attachments that I developed along the path were very hard to let go of, as if they were carved into my bones. For example, fear was one of these attachments. I had a hard time speaking to strangers, and as soon as I opened my mouth, I would tremble all over. This made it very difficult for me to [clarify the truth] after I obtained the [Fa]. My first thoughts about a situation were always negative and mixed with fear, resentment, and insecurity. These were all my attachments, and some were even notions and attachments I wasn’t aware of yet. I felt miserable as a human being, and my state at that time only reinforced my human thoughts and heart. At the early stages of my cultivation, [Master] purified my body and mind, but I needed to cultivate away the attachments myself. It was very hard, particularly the resentment towards my father. Other practitioners noticed that my state was not right, as whenever I spoke to my father, I would quiver. They wondered why was I so afraid of my father. Even though I knew the fear was forced on me, I had a hard time eliminating it. I was extremely afraid of talking about Dafa to my father. In 2006, when my father was critically ill, he shouted “Falun Dafa is good” and miraculously recovered. Five years later, he got sick again, and whenever I got close to him, he would chase me away and curse at me. He eventually passed away. After my father passed away, my fear of him disappeared, but my resentment hid in the shadows. Because I lost the environment to proactively cultivate away my resentment, I thought I had no more resentment. With constant Fa study and looking within, I gradually found that selfishness is the source of immoral behavior. Maybe I harmed my parents too much in previous lives, so in this life I get to suffer to repay the debt. From the perspective of a life that has been hurt, repaying a debt is only a natural principle, so I shouldn’t feel resentful. Plus, a little bit of pain is a paltry price to pay for the fortune of obtaining the Great Way today. When cultivators endure hardship, we can use the hardship as an opportunity to find our attachment and eliminate it. That is the process of cultivation. Having made that realization, I am now grateful for Master’s compassionate arrangement and for everyone and everything that I have come across in my life. How can I still have resentment? These difficulties are only there to help me change my notions and get rid of attachments—they are my path to divinity. Elevating Xinxing Through Guarding Every Thought Master told us: “…“He’s right.And I’m wrong.”What’s to dispute?” (“Who’s Right, Who’s Wrong,” [Hong Yin III](https://en.falundafa.org/eng/hy3_001.htm#flipbook-hy1_link/1/)) I have benefited so much from this teaching in the Fa. Whenever I felt I was right about something in a conflict, I’d grow indignant, lose my temper, and become irrational. When that happened, I’d recite these lines over and over again, which would calm me down. Then, I’d be able to look inward for my attachment and figure out where I went wrong. Cultivation is about cultivating each thought, bit by bit. Gradually, I am able to use the Fa teachings to evaluate situations more. Sometimes I’d find myself arguing and pointing fingers when I thought my spouse, a family member, or any other person was being unreasonable. But in the end, I found that I was just debating right and wrong at the human level. As a cultivator, I should be applying a higher standard to myself instead. Master also said: “...because whoever has acquired the karma feels uncomfortable. It is guaranteed to be this way.” (Lecture Four, [Zhuan Falun](https://www.falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl2014/zfl_2014_4.html#3)) It is my karma that has fallen on others, that causes them to be uncomfortable in the conflict. They’re manifesting the karma for me and helping me to eliminate it, so I should sympathize and be compassionate to them. At the same time, I believe that it is my failure to cultivate well that has given the evil factors a loophole to exploit. Thus, they are making other people suffer in this conflict and are harming people. When I can see it this way, I no longer feel indignant—all I think about is easing other people’s pain and apologizing for my mistakes. In coming to terms with my anger, I also eliminated my feelings of being wronged, my resentment, and my attachment to debating with others. I truly elevated my [xinxing] and entered a cultivator’s state of mind. The Importance of Sending Forth Righteous Thoughts to Cleanse My Field When I send forth righteous thoughts to cleanse my own field, my mind used to wander at times. I once heard a story about a cultivator who had to traverse a vast desert. At first, he was happy and content because he could feel that his God was with him, and that he was not alone. He knew this because when he turned back to look at the sand, he saw two rows of footprints. Later on, this cultivator faced many challenges on his path, challenges so difficult that he didn’t know if he could make it through. He wanted to ask God for help, but when he turned around, he only saw one row of very deep footprints. The cultivator became crestfallen, thinking that God had forsaken him in his moment of greatest need. He even began to resent God. But in that moment, a voice whispered in his ear: “Child, those footprints are mine. I have carried you on my back all this way.” I was in tears when I heard the story. The story helped me see my own despair and negativity regarding my faith in Master and the Fa. A master sacrifices so much to protect his disciples—and just like in the story, always watches over the disciples and guides them through the toughest challenges so that they can surpass themselves. How could a disciple be so narrow-minded and only think about his own suffering? And don’t these resentful thoughts lead to even more karmic debt? Master has suffered so much to provide salvation to us all! That’s not to mention when we have issues with our cultivate state and add additional hardship to an already difficult path. When we as cultivators do not proactively get rid of our own attachments and negative factors, Master has to endure more on our behalf. After coming to this realization, I am able to be attentive during the first five minutes of sending forth righteous thoughts when we clean our own minds. I feel that Dafa is rectifying all that is improper within me, all that would be an obstacle to Master’s Fa-rectification. I know now that if I can cleanse myself well, I will have a greater effect in eradicating evil forces. Copyright © 2024 Minghui.org. All rights reserved. Category: [ Improving Oneself ](/cc/63/)",

    "title": "Infringes Constitutional Rights Of Tribal People: Kerala HC Quashes GO Allotting Agricultural Land To Encroaching Church 'In Public Interest'",
    "text": "The Kerala High Court has stated that encroachers of government land are not entitled to any equity and there is no public interest to assign a property when there is an admitted encroachment. It stated that even if the encroachment was decades back, the state should work to repossess the land unless there is any legal impediment to it.The petitioners are social workers from the landless tribal community in Wayanad district and have approached the Court seeking direction to the government for facilitating the allocation of residential and agricultural lands to tribal families of Wayanad. They also alleged that the government assigned land 5.5358 hectares of land was transferred by government order to the 'Kallodi St.George Forane Church' for a meager amount of Rs 100 per acre illegally and against statutory provisions when hundreds of landless tribal people were waiting for agricultural and residential plots.A single bench of Justice P.V.Kunhikrishnan stated that the Kerala Land Assignment Act and Rules were not intended for enriching persons who hold extensive lands under the guise of encroachment. It thus found that the assignment of land to the Church was unsustainable and that there was no public interest involved in it. The Court held: “Assignment on the Registry of Government lands to such persons would defeat the very purpose of the Act and Rules. There is no vested right in any person to claim assignment on the registry of Government land. Encroaching on the government land and making illegal constructions on it will not give any vested right to encroachers. The government land should be allotted to the downtrodden and not to the wealthy and mighty people.”The Court stated that about 20 percent population in the Wayanad district consists of tribal communities. It stated that several tribal people were waiting to get lands for residential and agricultural purposes and that the State has to ensure that all tribals are happy and a beautiful smile continues on their face forever.BackgroundThe petitioners alleged social exclusion and a high degree of deprivation faced by the tribal community despite government initiatives. It was argued that around 32 tribal starvation deaths took place in 2001, pursuant to which the government agreed to a seven-point agreement. It was submitted that based on the agreement, tribals were promised lands, implementation of a five-year livelihood program, enactment of a new statute to prevent alienation of lands, a master plan for tribal development, and that about 10,000 acres would be found and distributed in Wayanad. The petitioners further stated that a government circular was also issued in 2001 to prevent the assignment of land in favor of persons/ associations that did not involve public interest. Respondents contended that the land in possession of the Kallodi St.George Forane Church had been used to build educational institutions, school playgrounds, buildings for church, cemetery, etc., and that the land had been in their possession since 1955. Relying upon Kerala Land Assignment Rules 1964, it was stated that lands were assigned to the church only after setting apart other similar unoccupied areas for the members of the SC/ST community. They claimed that no encroachment has been done on lands set apart for the SC/ST community. It was argued that the impugned land was initially given to the church on lease and the same was assigned on registry by following the existing rules under the powers of the state government.The Court found that the church was an encroacher of 5.5358 hectares of land till it was assigned the same based on the government order granting pattayam. It found that the land was being assigned at a meagre amount which was much less than the market price of the land. It thus noted that the intervention of the Court was necessary since the assignment of land was unsustainable.Relying upon Rule 24 of the Kerala Land Assignment Rules, it noted that the government can assign land in the public interest subject to fulfilling other rules and conditions. “What is the \\\"public interest\\\" in this case…..After encroachment on land, if churches or schools or other buildings are constructed on the Government's land, can the Government assign the land based on \\\"public interest\\\"?”, enquired the Court. It then referred to Rule 7 of the Kerala Land Assignment Rules to state that land had to be assigned on a priority basis and stated that the assignment of land to the Church was not a priority. It noted that even though the land was encroached on as early as 1971, it can only be assigned if the encroachment was not considered objectionable. In the facts of the case, the Court concluded that going by Rule 7, the Church was encroaching upon government land and that there was no public interest involved. “Simply because some educational institutions and religious institutions or cemetery are constructed after the encroachment, the land cannot be assigned stating...",

En este sentido, ha destacado que Europa \"exige que eso sea así y no te permite que esas ayudas las mantengas sine die, cuando las circunstancias que motivaron las ayudas han cambiado\". \"Es verdad que hay que hacerlo poco a poco, que no pueden cambiar rápidamente para que tengan un efecto negativo muy importante en la ciudadanía, pero poco a poco los ciudadanos también se deben ir adaptando a esta nueva realidad\", ha indicado.",
