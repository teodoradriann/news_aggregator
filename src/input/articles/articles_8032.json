    "text": "Opinion editor's note: Star Tribune Opinion publishes a mix of national and local commentaries online and in print each day. To contribute, click here .\n•••\nThe environmental community is diverse in the opinions and strategies each member uses to realize a collective goal of protecting and enhancing our environment and protecting human health. This includes holding elected leadership and state agencies accountable, particularly the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). We are quick to render judgment when we're unhappy with the MPCA, offering public criticism and making demands. I'm here to remind my dedicated colleagues and fellow environmentalists that we need to learn to be quick with praise as well. For this partnership to be impactful for future generations, we must give credit when credit is due.\nThis April, the MPCA took swift and decisive action to enforce air quality standards at the Northern Iron and Machine foundry in the Payne-Phalen neighborhood of St. Paul. This environmental justice neighborhood has the highest levels of lead in blood for children in Minnesota. The EPA has identified Northern Iron as among the lead-emitting facilities in the country with the greatest likelihood of impacting children.\nThis April, the MPCA ordered Northern Iron to reduce operations and take actions to reduce emissions. Northern Iron pushed back and asked for a stay to the order, and the MPCA did the right thing by denying that stay, which was a step taken to protect the surrounding community. In other words, the MPCA took firm action against a known polluter — behavior environmental organizations have long been demanding of the agency.\nUnfortunately, Northern Iron filed a petition for an order of review with Ramsey County District Court. After settlement discussions fell through, Northern Iron asked the judge for an emergency order allowing the foundry to resume its normal operating hours for the next few months. Instead, Northern Iron can try installing pollution control equipment and see whether that will sufficiently reduce its emissions.\nLead exposure impacts almost every part of our bodies, with children being the most susceptible to injury. Exposure in people of all ages can cause detrimental neurological and gastrointestinal effects, anemia, kidney disease and more. And because this is presenting as particulate matter, pollution is being released into the air and therefore highly mobile. You don't have to live immediately next to Northern Iron to be impacted.\nAs such, I feel it is only right to hold Judge Leonardo Castro as accountable as we would the MPCA for a decision made that is harmful to both the environment and human health. Judge Castro has an impressive résumé, but nowhere on that résumé lists an environmental sciences or public health degree. We must leave these decisions on how to address dangerous pollution to the experts. In this case, the expert is the MPCA.\nDespite Castro's decision, this case is not over. The law clearly states that Northern Iron must reduce its emissions. Northern Iron must install better pollution control equipment and prove that this has brought the foundry into compliance with air quality standards. The MPCA must carefully and vigilantly take all necessary steps to make sure that Northern Iron does not pull the wool over the community's eyes again, by producing faulty modeling or by hiding the truth about its equipment. And if Northern Iron cannot reduce its emissions, Castro must reinstate the MPCA's administrative order.\nFor all the complaints and bad-faith arguments polluters make when court cases go against them, it's always crickets when judges decide in their favor. Favor that can result in serious health impacts on us, our families and our communities.\nAlso, consider the message sent to businesses in compliance with their permits and abiding by regulations. Why does Northern Iron get a free pass to pollute while others do not? This ruling is no way to inspire businesses to honor Minnesota law regarding what is considered allowable levels of pollution discharge. This only makes the work of the MPCA that much harder to enforce.\nThe MPCA did what we have been asking them to do by taking serious steps to stop Northern Iron from releasing toxic particulate matter into the air we breathe. And we need to be in their corner for this fight.\nAvonna Starck, of Minneapolis, is state director for Clean Water Action Minnesota.",

    "title": "Two Guangdong Women in Detention for Their Faith in Falun Gong, Both Previously Jailed for 3 Years | Falun Dafa - Minghui.org",
    "text": "(Minghui.org) Two residents of Maoming City, Guangdong Province remained detained since their arrests weeks ago for their faith in Falun Gong, a mind-body practice that has been persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party since July 1999. Ms. Wang Ying, around 64, accompanied Ms. Tao Yonghong, 63, to visit the latter’s mother, 90-year-old Ms. Ding Jiaxi, on December 13, 2023. As soon as they arrived, more than ten officers from the Guandu Police Station barged in and raided Ms. Ding’s home, before proceeding to search Ms. Tao’s and Ms. Wang’s homes. The police had been staked outside the home of Ms. Ding, also a Falun Gong practitioner, and knew that her daughter Ms. Tao visited her often. Both Ms. Wang and Ms. Tao were taken to the Guandu Police Station before being transferred to the Maoming City Detention Center, where they remain. This is not the first time that Ms. Wang and Ms. Tao have been targeted for their faith. Ms. Wang was a jade expert and an engineer at Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. She served two years of forced labor and three years in prison for practicing Falun Gong. Her employer fired her in May 2011 after she was released from prison. They also reduced her years of service to zero from her pension calculation formula, resulting in her complete loss of retirement benefits. Ms. Tao is a retiree of Sinopec Maoming Petrochemical Company. She served three years in prison for her faith (2011-2014) and was briefly detained on several occasions. Around June 2022, the local social security office ordered Ms. Tao to pay back more than 102,000 yuan in pension benefits (including about 50,000 yuan of payments issued during her three-year prison term and more than 52,000 yuan in annual benefit increase she received since her prison release). They threatened to suspend her future pension if she did not comply. It is unclear whether she paid the money as ordered. Additionally, when Ms. Tao was not in detention, she and her mother faced constant harassment from the authorities. Past Persecution of Ms. Wang: 2 Years of Forced Labor, 3 Years of Prison Sentence, Wrongful Termination, and Loss of Pension In August 1988, Ms. Wang contracted kidney disease, which eventually developed into uremia at the end of 1994. Just when her life seemed hopeless, she encountered Falun Gong the following year. In just one month, her uremia symptoms disappeared. She also became an even more conscientious worker and an authoritative jade appraiser. At work, the laser Raman spectroscopy analysis tests she was responsible for always turned out accurate results, and she won the title of advanced worker at the Guangzhou Regional Scientific Instrument Collaboration Network several years in a row. After the persecution of Falun Gong began in 1999, Ms. Wang became a target. She was given two years of forced labor at the Guangzhou City Women’s Labor Camp in July 2000. Officers from the Tianhe District Police Department arrested Ms. Wang in April 2008 and took her to the Tianhe District Detention Center, where the guards kept her handcuffed and shackled for long stretches of time. The Tianhe District Court later sentenced her to three years and she served time at the Guangdong Province Women’s Prison. On May 6, 2011, not long after Ms. Wang was released from prison, her employer fired her and reduced her years of service to zero, which rendered her with no pension when she reached retirement age three years later. On July 22, 2017, Ms. Wang called the inspection team of the central government’s Commission for Discipline Inspection to complain about her wrongful termination and loss of pension, only to be harassed by Wu Min of the local street committee. She had to leave Guangzhou (capital of Guangdong Province) and move in with her grown children in Maoming City. To this day, Ms. Wang has not received a penny of her pension benefits. Past Persecution of Ms. Tao: Jailed for 3 Years and Multiple Short-term Detentions Ms. Tao used to suffer from numerous diseases, including stomach problems, migraines, cervical hyperplasia, rhinitis, gum bleeding, breast hyperplasia, heart disease, rheumatism, lower back pain, hemorrhoids, thrombocytopenia, low blood pressure, and frequent colds. She was thin, frail and had a spotted, dark complexion. In early 1998, one of her relatives urged Ms. Tao to give Falun Gong a try. She agreed and soon recovered from her symptoms. She has never needed to take any medication since. Jailed for 3 Years and Brutally Tortured Ms. Tao was arrested on June 9, 2011 after being reported for distributing Falun Gong informational materials. The arresting officers from the Zhensheng Police Station put her on criminal detention at the Maoming City First Detention Center the next day and she was issued a formal arrest warrant on July 14 that year. The Maonan District [Procuratorate] indicted Ms. Tao on September 29, 2011 and the Maonan District Court sentenced her to three years on November 10, 2011. Presiding judge Dai Wen, judges Li Weiming and Wu Yuemei, as well as clerk Wu Xiaoting were present during her trial. Ms. Tao’s appeal was denied by the Maoming City Intermediate Court on January 16, 2012 and she was transferred to the Guangdong Province Women’s Prison on February 10, 2012. During her eight months of detention at the Maoming City First Detention Center, Ms. Tao was brutalized for refusing to do hard labor without pay. Deputy director Zhong directed three inmates to beat her in a corner without surveillance cameras. She sustained severe internal injuries to her ribs and afterwards had trouble lying in bed due to the pain. The inmates also dunked her head into a bucket full of water and splashed water into her ears. Before her internal injuries healed, Zhong ordered Ms. Tao to be shackled for 14 days. She lost about a third of her weight in no time. About two months later, her left ear became infected and oozed pus, causing hearing difficulties. Her weight continued to drop. An inmate commented that she looked like a skeleton. The torture of Ms. Tao continued after she was admitted to the Guangdong Province Women’s Prison. On more than one occasion, she was deprived of sleep for 24 hours straight. She once became so fatigued that she passed out and struck her head against a wall. Only then did the guards allow her to sleep for the next two nights. Even so, the inmates assigned to watch her still beat her to wake her up from time to time during her sleep. During the day, she was forced to watch anti-Falun Gong videos and clean her cell. After lunch, she was forced to wash the dishes used by more than 700 inmates. At night she was forced to either stand or sit on a small bench in a corner without surveillance cameras. Six guards and five big and tall inmates took turns watching her at night. The inmates actively abused her in order to get term reductions. They bragged that they had all kinds of tricks up their sleeves to “deal with her” if she refused to renounce Falun Gong. One inmate stomped on Ms. Tao’s feet every few minutes. She also twisted her feet to make Ms. Tao suffer even more. Inmate Li Yanli pinched Ms. Tao’s thighs once every few minutes, leaving deep bruises. When Ms. Tao had to defecate, inmate Li Qiong squatted down to see whether her stool came out. Inmate Lai Bingmei slapped Ms. Tao in the face but claimed she was being hit first. Guard Min saw what happened from the surveillance camera but he came over to reprimand Ms. Tao, “You dared to beat Lai? I doubt you’d still have the audacity to do so if I had my electric baton with me.” Min also forced Ms. Tao to do military training as punishment. He and several inmates would follow her and flog her fingers with thin whips. Her hands turned red and swollen from the beatings. Ms. Tao was not ill, but the guards instructed several inmates to pin her on the ground and pry open her mouth to force-feed her unknown drugs. Ms. Tao was only given two minutes to take a shower each time. She had barely taken off her clothes when the roll call bell rang. Guard Min threatened to drag her out naked when he noted she had not come out of the shower yet. For a period of time, the guards gave Ms. Tao very little food and no water to drink. They also did not allow her to shower or use the restroom. From June to September each year, Ms. Tao was held in a small room without air conditioning or electric fans. Because she was denied restroom use, she had to relieve herself in her pants. The guards did not allow her to change clothes. She was not allowed to go to bed until 3 a.m. She was so tired that she hit the pillow with her soiled pants. The guards still did not allow her to change clothes the next morning unless she said, “I am a criminal and I now request to change my pants.” In order to force Ms. Tao to renounce Falun Gong, the guards resorted to various tactics to try to break her physically and mentally. The long-term torture caused her feet to swell terribly. Her left ear rang all the time. Her entire body was in pain. She had diarrhea once every two days. 15 Days of Criminal Detention in 2015 At around 10 a.m. one day in May 2015, more than two dozens officers, led by Zhou Wen from the Maonan District Domestic Security Office, broke into Ms. Tao’s mother’s – Ms. Ding’s – home. About ten more officers joined the first group during the raid, including the chief of the Maonan District Police Department. They confiscated a newly purchased laptop worth more than 2,000 yuan, several hundred yuan in cash, scissors, an iron, hair dryer and other valuables. The police suspected Ms. Tao of distributing Falun Gong materials and they raided her mother’s home because they knew she often stayed there for days at a time. They gave her 15 days of criminal detention at the Maoming City First Detention Center. Held in Custody for 23 Hours in 2016 Six people, including director Xu Yue’e and deputy directors Liang Yamei and Xu Yaqiu from the Shita Neighborhood Committee, as well as director Deng Huizhen and deputy directors Wu Fuquan and Zhou Hong from the Qiaobei Neighborhood Committee, showed up at Ms. Tao’s mother’s, Ms. Ding’s, home at 4:30 p.m. on September 12, 2016. They claimed they were there to see if Ms. Ding had renewed her senior citizens’ certificate (which comes with benefits for seniors, such as free bus rides). One of them took out her phone to take pictures. Ms. Tao, who was with her mother, stopped the woman. They then left. Three hours later, Ms. Tao needed to run some errands. When she stepped out of her mother’s apartment building, she saw around twenty people from the two neighborhood committees outside. Four of them swarmed her and asked her some random questions to stop her from leaving. About twenty minutes later, two officers (with badge numbers 224656 and 050080) from the Guandu Police Station arrived. Then a woman from the Guandu Street Office came over and asked Ms. Tao to go to the police station to answer some questions. She promised her that the police would let her go home as soon as everything was done. Ms. Tao believed the woman and got into the police cruiser. No one ever asked her questions and she was held at the police station for 23 hours, during which time director Feng and others from the neighborhood committees watched her. Neither they nor the police ever provided any legal basis for keeping her there. 15 Days of Administrative Detention in 2019 One day in October 2019, Ms. Tao went to the Maoming Railway Station and lost her wallet. A railway worker found the wallet and saw a few Falun Gong [amulet]s in it. When he saw Ms. Tao looking for her wallet, he seized her and took her to the Railway Police Station. At 2:30 that afternoon, her mother’s house was raided by Li Jie of the Maonan District Domestic Security Office, deputy chief Pan of the Railway Police Station, more than a dozen officers from the Guandu Police Station, and staffers from the Shita Neighborhood Committee. They seized some cash and valuables. Ms. Tao was given 15 days of administrative detention at the Maoming City Second Detention Center. Another 15 Days of Administrative Detention in 2020 Ms. Tao was arrested at 3 p.m. on August 24, 2020 and given 15 days of administrative detention at the Maoming City Second Detention. The Maonan District Police Department, the Guandu Police Station, and the Gaotie Police Station were responsible for her arrest. Endless Harassment of Ms. Tao and Her Mother Ms. Ding lives alone, so her youngest child, Ms. Tao, visited her often and sometimes stayed with her for days. They both faced endless harassment from the authorities. Below are harassment episodes from recent years that did not result in Ms. Tao’s arrest. Numerous Harassment Episodes in October 2017 Before the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, from October 16 to 23, 2017, the Shita Neighborhood Committee came to harass Ms. Tao at least once a day, sometimes twice a day. She was living with her mother during that period. The harassers took pictures of her with their phones. Once, Ms. Tao and her mother were having lunch, when two people from the Shita Neighborhood Committee came to harass them. Another time at 10:30 p.m., two men in plainclothes came. One was waiting on the third floor, and the other knocked on the door. Ms. Ding had already gone to sleep and she was awoken by the loud pounding on the door. They said they were from the Guandu Police Station, and they’d come to check on her. There were at least 12 other episodes of harassment in October 2017. They also called Ms. Tao’s husband when they could not find her at her mother’s house. One Harassment Episode Each in 2018 and 2019 Deputy directors Xu Yaqiu and Liang Yamei from the Shita Neighborhood Committee, led two staffers to harass Ms. Ding at home at 3:30 p.m. on June 11, 2018. They claimed to be doing a welfare check. Ms. Tao told them that her mother had been healthy for twenty years thanks to Falun Gong. They left. Xu and Liang knocked on Ms. Ding’s door at 3:15 p.m. on January 15, 2019. They brought in a document and ordered her and Ms. Tao to sign. Both refused to comply. Harassment in the Name of Welfare Check and Census in 2020 Deputy director Liang from the Shita Neighborhood Committee and a man who was the director of the local Stability Maintenance Office came to Ms. Ding’s home at 10:30 a.m. on May 29, 2020, when Ms. Ding and Ms. Tao were having a late breakfast. Liang said they were there to visit the elderly Ms. Ding and the man said they came to see whether Ms. Ding had renewed her senior citizens’ certificate. Ms. Tao said that her mother could go to their office to do the renewal and that they did not need them to bother them at home. They then left. At 9 p.m. on August 24, 2020, deputy directors Liang and Xu of the Shita Neighborhood Committee came to Ms. Ding’s house to “conduct a census.” After checking her household registration book, they asked if she still practiced Falun Gong. They then asked the names of her oldest daughter and her son-in-law. Ms. Ding refused to answer, as that was not part of the census. They left. Neighbors Condemn Harassment of Ms. Ding in 2021 On March 2, 2021, deputy director Xu of the Shita Neighborhood Committee came to Ms. Ding’s apartment building and asked her neighbors about her. Three days later, Xu came to harass Ms. Ding, using the excuse of checking the status of the renewal of her senior citizen’s certificate. Ms. Ding learned from two of her neighbors that Xu had actually talked to them outside the apartment building before going up to her home. Xu asked the two neighbors if they had seen her shopping for groceries and whether her daughter Ms. Tao had visited her. The neighbors found Xu’s questions odd and replied that it was normal for a daughter to visit her mother. They condemned her for harassing Ms. Ding. One night at the end of November 2021, two groups of people from the Guandu Street Office, the Shita Neighborhood Committee, and the Qiaobei Neighborhood Committee harassed both Ms. Ding and Ms. Tao at their respective homes using the census as an excuse. About one month later, Ms. Ding and Ms. Tao both noticed people monitoring them outside their homes. There were also two high-resolution cameras installed on the gate of Ms. Ding’s apartment complex. Three Harassment Episodes in 2022 At around 4 p.m. on April 21, 2022, someone saw a police officer and a female neighborhood committee member at the door of Ms. Ding’s home. The woman knocked on the door and left when no one answered. Around 5:00 p.m. on December 16, 2022, a middle-aged man was spotted outside Ms. Ding’s apartment building. He pretended to be looking at his phone. At around 10 a.m. on December 18, 2022, deputy director Liang of the Shita Neighborhood Committee knocked on Ms. Ding’s door with a piece of paper in her hand. Ms. Tao, who was with her mother, opened the door. The man who accompanied Liang said he needed to see Ms. Ding. Ms. Tao demanded to know his identity and he replied he was from the Guandu Street Office, also surnamed Liang. Director Liang wanted to take a picture of Ms. Tao but Ms. Tao stopped her. Liang said that the higher-up sent them there. Ms. Tao took pictures of him. He became nervous and offered to treat her and her mother to tea. Harassment in 2023 Preceding Ms. Tao’s Latest Arrest At around 10 a.m. on February 17, 2023, a tall man knocked on Ms. Ding’s door. He was about fifty years old and wearing glasses. He took a photo of the door and knocked on it for a long time before leaving. Outside the apartment building, a short and yellow-haired woman was seen monitoring the entrance to Ms. Ding’s apartment building. After the tall man came downstairs, he monitored everyone who entered or exited Ms. Ding’s apartment building. There was a camera in the courtyard recording everyone coming out of the apartment building, with another camera facing outside to record anyone entering the building. Opposite the gate of the apartment complex, there was a middle-aged man in light green clothes monitoring the pedestrians in the courtyard. Ms. Tao suspected they were personnel from the Shita Neighborhood Committee and the Guandu Street Office who were monitoring her and her mother. In early February 2023, Ms. Tao’s son received a call from the police, asking where she lived. On February 13, her husband received another call from the police, again asking where she was. Her husband said he did not know and told the police not to bother him. Related Articles in Chinese: Copyright © 2023 Minghui.org. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "In the first reported interception of an anti-ship missile, a US Navy warship shot down two incoming anti-ship ballistic missiles fired by Houthi rebels from Yemen. [300 Attacks, ZERO Interceptions! What Makes Russia’s KH22 Deadlier That Kinzhal Hypersonic Missile?] While the firing of the anti-ship missiles heralds a new era in naval warfare, the interception highlights that the US Navy has incorporated technologies to take on lethal anti-ship ballistic missiles as it readies itself for the rise of the Chinese Navy. The Red Sea trade waterway is growing dangerous with each passing day as the Houthis have been targeting vessels passing through the region protesting against the Israeli invasion of Gaza. On December 30, the US destroyer USS Gravely was responding to a distress call from a container ship hit in a separate strike. The ship’s radar detected the missiles moving toward its position at [supersonic](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a45666219/navy-test-fires-sm6-missile/) speeds, each loaded with well over a half-ton of explosives. Two anti-ship ballistic missiles were fired at it from territory controlled by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, the US Central Command said in [a social media post](https://x.com/CENTCOM/status/1741259817602429357?s=20), describing it as the 23rd illegal attack by the Houthis on international shipping since November 19. According to CENTCOM, the USS Laboon and USS Gravely, both destroyers, answered a call for help from the Maersk Hangzhou, a container ship operated and owned by Denmark that was flying the Singaporean flag and had reported being hit by a missile while sailing the Red Sea. Anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs), a type of weapon never before used in combat, were fired “toward the ships,” and the Gravely shot them down in response. It heralds a new age in naval warfare, one in which ships at sea must defend themselves against ballistic missiles fired from far-off coastlines and coming through the Earth’s atmosphere, in addition to torpedoes and surface-skimming missiles. “USS Gravely is an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, which is a warship primarily built around the concept and capabilities provided by Aegis Combat System and the SPY-1D multi-function passive electronically scanned array radar,” Commander Milind Kulshrestha (retired) told the EurAsian Times. He undertook the ab initio design, development, and successful onboard deployment of the first indigenous Naval Combat Management systems (CMS) for modern warships in the Indian Navy. “These (Aegis Combat System) systems provide one of the best Anti-air Warfare capabilities, especially against a small cross-section of incoming missiles and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS),” Kulshreshta added. According to US Central Command, the attack on USS Gravely was [preceded](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/houthis-show-no-sign-of-ending-attacks-on-ships-in-the-red-sea-u-s-commander-says) by another destroyer, the [USS Mason](https://x.com/CENTCOM/status/1740527574772834536?s=20) downed a drone and anti-ship ballistic missile that were fired by the Houthis. [On December 27](https://x.com/CENTCOM/status/1739746985652158755?s=20), US F/A-18 Super Hornets from the Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group shot down twelve one-way attack drones, three anti-ship ballistic missiles, and two land attack cruise missiles in the Southern Red Sea that were fired by the Houthis over 10 hours. The Houthis most likely used a homegrown derivative or Khalij Fars (“Persian Gulf”) ASBM, which was manufactured in Iran. With a potential range of 186 miles, the almost 9-meter-long Khalij Fars can reach a top speed of 40 to 50 miles per minute (Mach 3 or 4). In 2022, the Houthis unveiled a purportedly native 10-meter-long Aasef (or Aasif) missile, which bore a striking resemblance to the Khalij Fars. It had a 700-millimeter diameter, a 1,212-pound warhead, and a 250-mile range. The US forces in Iraq and Syria have repeatedly come under fire from drone and rocket attacks that Washington says are being carried out by Iran-backed armed groups. The US Central Command sees the deployment of anti-ship cruise or ballistic missiles as a difficult challenge. Cruise missiles designed to counter ship threats “may approach low and pierce a ship’s hull above the waterline.” These are the same kinds of munitions that struck USS Stark in the Persian Gulf in 1987 and sank many British ships during the Falklands War. Ballistic missiles might pose an even bigger risk. The undisputed cornerstone of contemporary anti-ship combat, cruise missiles are essentially a type of replaceable drone aircraft. In comparison, a ballistic missile has significantly less maneuverability and acts more like a rocket ship. However, the most potent ballistic missiles are extremely difficult to intercept without specialized defenses since they can exit the atmosphere and travel enormous distances at absurd speeds. The weapon’s payload and terminal velocity might cause significant harm to a warship or commercial vessel, and it might take the greatest US tracking radars like SPY-6 and interceptors, such as the speedy [SM-6 multi-role missile](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a45666219/navy-test-fires-sm6-missile/), to shoot it down. Defending against the Chinese ‘Carrier-killer’ missile DF-21D As China pumped in more money in the development of the DF-21 D missile, which has earned the moniker of “Carrier-Killer” missile, it became imperative for the US Navy to deploy a spectrum of new air defense capable of stopping anti-ship ballistic missiles. These featured the SM-2ER Block IV, the swift SM-6 multirole missile, and the very potent SM-3, which could protect wide regions. Even the Navy’s short-range missile defenses, which consist of RIM-116 SeaRAM launchers mounted on non-destroyer vessels and RIM-67 Evolved Sea Sparrow medium-range missiles that can be quadruple-packed into a destroyer’s missile cells, can offer some defense. The Houthi rebels anti-ship missile technology is much inferior to the [DF-21 D](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/df-21d-chinas-missile-built-sink-navy-aircraft-carrier-war-207393), which, integrated with China’s maritime reconnaissance-strike network of satellites, over-the-horizon radars, and maritime intelligence assets, could deny access to the best of the warships in case of a conflict. The ground-launched DF-21 D has a reported range of 1,000 miles, ostensibly able to [ destroy aircraft carriers](https://news.yahoo.com/chinas-rocket-forces-practicing-launching-181253989.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall) with advanced range and guidance systems. The Red Alert In Red Sea The attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels are showing no signs of letting up. [More nations](https://twitter.com/CENTCOM/status/1740827730026049595) are joining the [international maritime mission](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/pentagon-announces-new-international-mission-to-counter-attacks-on-commercial-vessels-in-red-sea) to protect vessels in vital waterways. Around 1,200 commercial ships have passed through the Red Sea region since Operation Prosperity Guardian was launched a little over ten days ago, and none of them have been struck by drone or missile strikes. Denmark became the latest country to declare intentions to contribute a frigate to the operation, stating on Friday that “this is an international challenge that demands collective action.” The Gulf of Aden is connected to the Red Sea and thereafter to the Suez Canal via the slender Bab el-Mandeb Strait. Markets in Asia and Europe are connected by this important trading corridor. Numerous shipping firms have ordered their vessels to remain in place and not enter the strait until the security situation has improved due to the intensity of the attacks, several of which have resulted in damage to vessels. Significant shippers extended the duration and expense of the voyages by circling Africa and the Cape of Good Hope with their vessels. - Ritu Sharma has been a journalist for over a decade, writing on defense, foreign affairs, and nuclear technology. - She can be reached at ritu.sharma (at) mail.com [Follow EurAsian Times on Google News](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMJvlgwswtsTaAg?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN:en)",

The extreme cold has led to the freezing of portions of the iconic Dal Lake. Let's take a look: Frozen beauty The extreme cold has transformed the Dal Lake into a winter spectacle, drawing tourists worldwide to witness its frozen beauty. It has not deterred tourists, with thousands flocking to the Kashmir Valley, to experience the chilly conditions. \"To see the frozen Dal Lake is a dream come true. I had only seen this on TV and today witnessing this live was a very unique experience for me. I have come along with my friends To enjoy the beauty of Kashmir in winters. So far, we have seen the frozen Dal Lake and all of us are extremely amused at looking at the frozen lake,\" Ashish, a tourist told WION. (Photograph:WION) A unique experience Popular destinations like Gulmarg, Pahalgam, and Sonmarg are fully booked, attracting visitors from various Indian states and around the world. Tourists express awe at the unique experience of witnessing the frozen Dal Lake, describing it as extremely beautiful. Talking to WION Correspondent Idrees Lone, Sajad, a tourist from India's Kerala said: \"I have never witnessed these visuals in my life before. The frozen looks extremely beautiful and a unique experience. We have especially come to witness the cold weather in the Kashmir Valley, and we are having the time of our lives. We are also planning to go to Gulmarg and Pahalgam to witness the snow. I will recommend Kashmir to everybody when I go back to Kerala.\" (Photograph:WION) A challenge for locals However, for the locals, the cold has disrupted daily life in Srinagar. As temperatures plummet across the valley, the frozen portions of the lake have posed serious challenges for locals living on the lake, who now have to cut through the ice to reach the banks. (Photograph:WION) Chilai Kalan The Kashmir Valley is experiencing Chilai Kalan, a 40-day harsh winter period, due to which places like Pahalgam and Gulmarg have emerged as among the coldest in the region. Pahalgam recorded a temperature of -6.2 °C, while the resort town of Gulmarg recorded a minimum temperature of -4 °C. (Photograph:WION) Meteorological Department prediction The Meteorological Department in Srinagar predicts mainly dry weather until January 3, with chances of snowfall and rain over the higher reaches from January 6.",

    "text": "In the aftermath of October 7, many (including this author) noted the similarity between the atrocities perpetrated by Hamas and those of the Amalekites during the Israelite exodus from ancient Egypt. This, in turn, led others to suggest that any comparison to the Amalekites could be seen to justify genocide.\nAccording to Hebrew scripture and Midrash, as the Israelites came out of Egypt, the Amalekites slaughtered defenseless stragglers, women and children, the elderly and wounded. The Amalekites cut off the circumcised organs of the males, the mark of God’s covenant with Abraham, which they hurled toward the sky, calling out in mockery to heaven: “Here, take what you have chosen.” This, Yahweh seems not to have taken well.\nAfter Moses sent Joshua to defeat the Amalekites and “put their people to the sword,” God told Moses to write down God’s words and repeat them for Joshua: “I will completely blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven.” Moses then constructed an altar, “because the Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.” The command “do not forget Amalek” recurs throughout Hebrew scripture and liturgy. The enmity between God and Amalek is unique in scripture: nowhere else does God declare a perpetual state of conflict with a human community. This perplexed Jewish and later Abrahamic scholars for centuries. Since October 7, it has been debated more widely, invoked as evidence of the genocidal ethos of primitive paganism or of the genocidal inclinations of Israel.\nNeither Jew nor Christian is required to believe in the historicity of the account, nor in the mandate to eradicate Amalek. It may be that the Amalekites never existed. But whether the Amalekites existed, and whether God is at war with some regenerate incarnate malevolence called Amalek—none of which is falsifiable—misses the point. What’s certain is that the Jewish people have been targeted in a distinct way for centuries (one could say, in every generation) and that they’ve often forgotten this fact—or have tried desperately to forget.\nWhat’s also certain, moreover, is that the violence of the kind described in Midrash was standard practice in pagan societies, as was ritualized torture of every conceivable kind, human sacrifice, and cannibalism. The myth of ‘the noble savage’ somehow survives despite the mounting evidence. In truth, there is nothing noble in our origins, only savagery, and the primary reason few of us have encountered such savagery is the spread of the Abrahamic religions.\nMost will agree that civilized behavior, at a minimum, consists of abstaining from ritualistic torture, rape, sexual mutilation, human sacrifice, cannibalism, and related conduct. Yet for most of human history such conduct was normative and often sacralized. Habits of ritual violence and scapegoating to satisfy blood lust and communal anxiety were ubiquitous.\nHuman sacrifice was a near-universal practice in primitive pagan societies, even among sophisticated pagans. Greeks had elaborate religious rituals for killing their pharmokoi (scapegoats). Romans buried sacrificial victims alive in religious rituals to spare Rome from enemies like the Carthaginians, and though human sacrifice was later banned, crucifixion, mass executions, and murderous entertainment continued until banished in the Christian era. The Carthaginians, like their Phoenician and Canaanite ancestors, sacrificed their own children, as did many Mediterranean peoples. Aztec, Maya, Chinese, Japanese, and Indian civilizations all had rituals for human sacrifice.\nRitualistic violence among low pagans was less well documented but often more horrific. Christians from the medieval to modern eras, travelers like Ahmad ibn Fadlan and Samuel de Champlain, and missionaries all personally witnessed ritualized torture, murder, and cannibalism, from North America to Northern Europe and Asia. Celtic and Baltic, Germanic and Angle, Comanche and Guanche—more peoples partook than can be numbered because most have gone extinct. Ritualistic barbarity was universal.\nWe probably cling to the myth of the noble savage despite the evidence because the truth—that we all descend from inbred cannibals who made a sacred ritual of torture, rape, sexual mutilation, child sacrifice, and murder—is too unpleasant. We have no desire to confront our history, ourselves, or what the world looks like with different gods. The earth beneath us is a vast crime scene, and those of us walking around descend from something far worse than our simian ancestors. Apes are incapable of the tortures humans inflict on one another.\nSo what brought most of that savagery to an end? And why do we believe in universal moral norms that restrain violent impulse rather than indulge it? Each inquirer is free to examine cause and effect throughout history. But if by progress we mean the spread of universal concepts of human dignity, equality, and morality—rather than, say, democracy or roads or sound architecture or law—then it all began with the Hebrews. It was the Jews who gave us monotheism, universal moral standards, the notion of the human person, and much else besides. Civilizational progress came from the Abrahamic faiths—unevenly, imperfectly, and undeniably.\nSacrificial violence and scapegoating were cathartic. They satisfy blood lust and the innate sense that there is injustice, that something is wrong, and that someone ought to be held to account, hence the sacrificial victim. The Hebrews shifted the violent cathartic urge from man to creature, and Christians shifted it to bread and water.\nThere are of course examples of civilized conduct among high pagans, though many of these had a threshold for quotidian violence that we conveniently ignore. And there are Abrahamic peoples who, often in the name of God, inflict unspeakable violence—much of it on each other, and the worst of it on the Jews. However, in general, civilized conduct among high pagans requires a deviation from pagan norms, and uncivilized behavior among Abrahamic communities requires a deviation from their own morality. Sorting through the genealogy and authenticity of moral systems today is nearly impossible for many reasons. Suffice it to say, most of us behave very differently from our pagan ancestors—and why we do so has everything to do with Judaism.\nSophisticated pagans, like primitive pagans, have tried to do away with the Hebrew God, Hebrew scripture and tradition, and the Hebrews themselves. Some early Christian sects, thanks to various pagan influences, sought to do the same—to supplant the wrathful Yahweh.\nThe problem of Amalek contributes perhaps more than any single factor to the Marcionite impulse. Marcionism, which existed as early as the second century and survives today, is the belief that Jewish and Christian deities were distinct, or that Hebraic and Christian scriptures and traditions should be severed. Marcionism was condemned as a heresy—a gnostic attempt to wrest Christianity thoroughly from Judaism—but it survives into our century, giving rise to an odd bed-fellowship of Enlightenment secularists and Christians. The late Christopher Hitchens lamented the failure of the Hellenistic empires, and later Marcion, to eradicate Hebraic influence (and, by implication, the Jews). Over the centuries, many Christians not only joined in the lament but in the work of eradication.\nEnlightenment Europe was so far removed in time from the ritualized pagan violence of their ancestors that philosophers could develop amnesia, the evidence buried and forgotten. So Kant and Kierkegaard, in languages that had no word for mercy before their conversion to Abrahamic faiths, and with no memory of the ritual horrors of their Norse and Germanic ancestors, had the luxury to ponder with horror the story of Isaac’s binding by his father Abraham.\nIf Abraham’s God could suspend the ethical, then what need did we have for him? Reason was a sufficient basis for rejecting child sacrifice, and so Enlightenment secularism, in the spirit of Marcionism, retained Christian sentiment but parted ways with its Hebraic origins—embarrassed of its Abrahamic patrimony, apparently unaware of its pagan patrimony. It was pagan man who demanded a human sacrifice, not God—and it is Isaac’s unbinding that began humanity’s liberation from child sacrifice and paganism’s attendant horrors. But all this was lost in the spirit of modernity and universal values free of religion.\nThe Enlightenment first made those values secular and then, once they were safely divorced from their Abrahamic origins, made them sacred again in various ideologies. Some modern movements essentially retained Hebraic values like equality and personal dignity, and kept the spheres of religion and state separate.\nEnlightenment ideologies had universal appeal—the first such non-Abrahamic universalist movements since the Hellenistic era. These ideologies sought, like ancient pagans, to reforge the unity of political and religious power in a single entity—the totalitarian state. Even where the modern state was limited, religious and voluntary associations in civil society—a distinctive feature of Abrahamic cultures—were often brought under state dominion. America has been an exception to this trend, generally if unevenly preserving personal liberty and civil society, and rejecting ethno-racial or religious uniformity. Not coincidentally, it is one of the few places where all three Abrahamic faiths and many others have equal citizenship and protection of law.\nHowever, many modern ideologies, amid the resurgence of paganism, condemned Judeo-Christian morality as a mark of weakness, a ‘slave morality.’ There were two kinds of Enlightenment secularism: the soft paganism that preserved most of the moral sentiments of biblical religion and the hard neopagan ideologies that made political-religious idols of the state or an ideology, often fusing low paganism (ethnos) and high paganism (ethos) in centralized and industrialized societies.\nAmong the incalculable violence of the last century, one struggle was distinct: the neopagan Nazis, possessed by a drive to exterminate the Jews, who were often armed only with a divine command to survive. The Nazis, like Amalek, targeted the weakest for murder, but on an unimaginable scale. The modern exodus consisted not only those who survived the Shoah but also Jews from around the Middle East, forced out after 1948, more than a million of whom were exiled and who today constitute the majority of Israeli Jews. Hence a better-informed protestors’ clamor would be, “Go back to Iran,” instead of, “Go back to Poland.”\nOver three-quarters of a century, Israel has survived several attacks from their neighbors, each of which aspired to genocide, sometimes in word, sometimes in deed. Israel survived. October 7 was distinct in that it posed no existential threat to Israel but that it nevertheless constituted the most murders of Jews in a single day since the Shoah. Israel’s sentinels forgot Amalek.\nThere is another side to the Amalek problem: Israel has long been accused of apartheid and—as the term has become so readily invoked as to lose significance—genocide. Both claims might readily be refuted by good faith inquiry, but even the stubbornest of facts struggles to survive the rhetoric of colonialism, victimhood, and frequently bandied but seldom defined terms like ‘Zionism.’ Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, Israel’s critics, mainstream and fringe alike, have variously asserted that the Israeli Defense Forces have been indifferent to the lives of non-combatants or that the casualty rates in Gaza are higher than other urban conflicts, such as the U.S.-led campaign against ISIS in Mosul at the height of fighting in 2017.\nMosul was truly genocidal, as anyone who saw it can attest. The U.S. declared it a Sunni-on-Shia genocide in 2016, and the following year, the Shia got their revenge. Nothing like that is happening in Gaza. It has been reported that the Pentagon offered the IDF blueprints for Gaza based on the anti-ISIS campaigns in Mosul and Raqqa and that the IDF refused, opting instead for a protracted urban campaign that was certain to increase IDF casualties but reduce non-combatant deaths. That’s the strategy the IDF pursued and the result has been fewer non-combatant deaths than in Iraq and Syria—far fewer.\nInternational media relied, with little scrutiny, on the casualty rates published by the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry, despite its own admission that its figures came from uncited but “reliable media sources,” and despite the ministry’s exaggerated claim of 500 casualties from a hospital bombing on October 16, which even most Israel critics acknowledge was conducted by Palestinians. In early April, the health ministry adjusted its casualty data, revealing that approximately one-third of the casualties couldn’t be verified. The adjusted data upend claims that the IDF have been indifferent to civilian casualties and support the counterclaim that the IDF is setting the standard for limiting civilian deaths in urban combat—especially where the enemy has built its defensive strategy around human shields. This is all the more astonishing since getting the IDF to kill Palestinian civilians is the essence of Hamas’ strategy.\nNATO set forth Hamas’ mindset with clarity: “The strategic logic of human shields has two components. It is based on an awareness of Israel’s desire to minimise collateral damage, and of Western public opinion’s sensitivity towards civilian casualties.” This begs the strategy of whether, given the enemy’s mindset and willingness to kill its own people, it makes sense to restrict one’s objectives, thereby incentivizing the use of human shields?\nAssuming one’s war is just on its own merits, is its justice negated because the enemy adopts ever more ruthless methods, such as positioning civilians to be killed in order to gain the upper hand in public relations? Wouldn’t the most just approach in such an instance be to convey to the enemy that one will not take extraordinary measures to limit collateral damage? Of course, only one side in the conflict is even bothering with such questions—Israel—which is also the only side being held to any kind of moral standard. That perverse ethic is what gives rise to human shields.\nFor Hamas, their strategy values collateral damage over killing the IDF. In other words, they’re not trying to repel the invasion but rather to get the Israelis to kill as many Palestinians as possible. The IDF, for their part, are trying to kill Hamas and trying not to kill non-combatants, which makes them the only party to the conflict whose strategy seeks to avoid killing Palestinian civilians. Yet the Palestinians overwhelmingly support Hamas, whose objective is to kill them. These macabre perversities would be impossible but for two factors: first, disproportionate media attention, which obsesses about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; and, second, an extremist movement rooted in academia that’s substantially funded by foreign entities with Islamist ties.\nThere are several reasons why Israel might seek to reduce civilian casualties, some of which wouldn’t occur to most Westerners. First, they need support from the U.S. and the West. Second, they need the tacit approval of many Arab governments, for whom Hamas and other Islamists are an existential threat (which Hamas is not to Israel). Third, they need the support of their Arab-Israeli citizens, who are one-fifth of Israel’s population—and most of whom support the war despite Netanyahu’s unpopularity. Fourth, and fundamentally, there remains the core ethics of the Israelis themselves. One either understands this or one does not. Simply put: Israel could commit genocide but won’t, while Hamas would commit genocide but can’t. Until this is grasped by good faith observers, they won’t understand.\nThe admonition to remember Amalek was not for vengeance but for survival. Hebrew scripture also commands Jews to be kind to the stranger (“for you yourselves were once strangers in the land of Egypt”) and to show compassion for the ‘other,’ its patriarchs and prophets serving as advocates for the gentiles. How can this be reconciled with the command to make merciless war on Amalek?\nThere’s a paradox in the story of the Amalekites and the Hebrews: the Hebrews (and with them monotheism) would have perished had they not been ruthless in the unspeakably violent horror of that ancient world. Were it not for the Jews and their Abrahamic progeny, the world would never have conceived its luxury beliefs, as Rob Henderson aptly termed it—morals that had no equivalent in the pagan world. Kantians can invoke the categorical imperative, but that notion was Christian before it was secular, and Hebraic before it was Christian—and before the Hebrews, it existed only in the mind of God. The rage over the treatment of the Hebrews’ treatment of the Amalekites is only possible because of a moral framework brought to us by the Hebrews—which we presumably wouldn’t have inherited if the Amalekites had prevailed.\nAgain—most primitive languages had no word for ‘mercy,’ or any such concept for those outside their tribe. Many languages only incorporated words like ‘mercy’ after they were converted to an Abrahamic religion, usually by Christian or Muslim missionaries. True, primitive languages tend not to have abstract terms, but even words that alluded to tenderness or kindness were reserved for intimates, rather than ‘the other’—and the story of primitive humanity is, to paraphrase Hobbes, little more than a war of “other against other.” Not so the Hebrews: while few languages had a word for mercy, the Hebrews had several.\nNotions of mercy, compassion, charity for ‘the other,’ began with the Jews and to this day continue to make them vulnerable to attack: ancient pagans and modern pagans alike diagnose this weakness. But so, apparently, had their God and his prophets. This is why Hebrew scripture and liturgy enjoin the Jewish people to never forget Amalek, who will rise in every generation.\nThe Hebraic way and the pagan way tend toward mutual exclusivity. The Hebrew God was one, and made superior claims against those of the pagans that bound Jew and gentile alike. The patriarch Abraham stood solitary among the pagans: the father who did not kill his son when all the pagans did. That was the beginning of the long Abrahamic struggle against humanity’s natural state: libido dominandi, lex talionis, primitive savagery.\nToday, spectacles of violence can be seen when scrolling through social media, from the horrors of October 7 to the streets of Gaza. But the spectacles on campuses commemorate the distant violence into strange rituals of their own: frenzied mobs chanting wrathful phrases in quasi-liturgical cadences, making ritual of slaughter, sometimes searching out scapegoats in their midst, as if summoning what Gerard Manley Hopkins called “the death-dance in our blood.”\nIt may be fair to wonder whether those who’ve long lectured on subjects like, say, unconscious bias might themselves experience some hidden satisfaction from the bloodshed, perhaps in the form of moral superiority, perhaps some more tenebrous sensation: not merely emotional distance and catharsis but sheer dominance. Much of the protest spectacles feels pagan.\nFew protesters, including the professors, have spent much time in the region, and few grasp the salient facts. Fewer still were seeking before the war to help Palestinians, or will help after. Yet Palestinians serve an important function in the ritual indignation: their suffering gives form to the protests, their blood the substance. But it’s not really about them. In this perverse amalgam of narcissism, ideology, and outrage, the distant Palestinians are the victim, the wicked oppressors are the Jews, and they—the protesters—are the heroes, the righteous priestly class, who preside and render moral judgments.\nIdeology, ritual protests, sacrificial victims, oppressor classes, liberation, and moral supremacy—even good faith protesters fail to grasp that there’s no amount of self-loathing that will bring peace. For the pagan, compassion is a weakness and the compassionate deserve to be dominated and victimized—enslaved by the very logic of their own morality. Even the ‘underdogma’ theory, that the weaker side is morally righteous, is Hebraic in origin. But it’s a perversion of even this Judeo-Christian sentiment, for it ignores the systematic rape, torture, mutilation, and murder that followed October 7. Mercy presupposes justice: mercy without justice only invites more injustice. Antisocial types prey on that weakness.\nThe anti-Zionist axis of Western elites—academia, media, establishment institutions, and increasingly the state—are party (wittingly or unwittingly) to a strategy that gets more Palestinians killed, all in order to feel morally superior, which is perhaps the most pagan and colonial perversity of all. Many among the polite anti-Zionists don’t want to say that they simply don’t believe that Israel has a right to exist. That’s the essence of anti-Zionism—and that notion itself contains a genocidal whiff, however polite the anti-Zionist is.\nIt’s likely that professors, more than students, delight in reenacting the ’60s. But most of the campus protests then were anti-war. Today’s protesters aren’t anti-war: they’re simply upset that the wrong side is prevailing. One wonders if some of the new pagan folk secretly delight in the ritual, the violence, whether the scapegoat urge has overpowered them, or satisfies some atavistic prurience—the sanguine “death dance.” Whatever the case, and whatever the clamorous mobs utter, they do so with “the approval of their own consciences,” as C.S. Lewis said. And, as ever, there’s another way—the Hebraic way.\nThe story of the Jewish people has been described as that people’s long struggle against paganism. The Hebrew God was the first transcendent deity, removed from the earth. He chose a people but gave a moral law for all of humanity. The Jews had to survive in order to transmit monotheism and objective morality to the world. The Jews were not and are not tribal in the sense that they only care about their own group—but they are tribal in the sense that, at some level, they know that the nations will turn on them, that Amalek will rise, and that they still struggle to survive. But anyone who doubts Jewish gratitude to non-Jews should visit the trees on the Mount of Remembrance at Yad Vashem, which plants new trees each year: it’s Jews, not Christians, who preserve the names of those who risked everything but their souls to save Jews.\nFor all the angst of some Christians over the Amalekite problem, many have eagerly joined in antisemitism over the centuries, often with the approval of their own consciences. Christian institutions and leaders often struggle to confront antisemitism beyond overly vague condemnations. In this way, past wrongs survive into the present and the burden of memory falls to the Jews. Christianity’s ultimate failure to confront antisemitism, however, lay not in the particulars of conduct but deeper: in the failure to confront the paganism that rises anew in every generation, and perhaps in the perverse tendency to have sympathy for Amalek.",

    "text": "On Saturday night, the [Kansas City Chiefs](https://www.chiefs.com/) players were prepared for the extremely cold weather. It was predicted that the Chiefs playoff matchup with Miami would be among the coldest in NFL history, with an anticipated two-degree temperature and a windchill of -30 degrees. Allen Wright, the equipment director for Kansas City, [ told People](https://people.com/how-kansas-city-chiefs-prepare-for-cold-playoff-game-8425962) that the team would be use a range of equipment to combat it and stay warm for the game. Wetsuits, thermal socks, heated benches, “long” underwear, and even infrared sideline heaters are among this equipment’s offerings. Wright continued by saying that he gives the wetsuits to each member of the team. Only half of the squad decides to accept them, though. He went on to say that tight end [Travis Kelce](https://blacksportsonline.com/tag/travis-kelce/) is one guy who won’t be dressing very differently for the game. “So he’s a guy that doesn’t really change much on what he wears,” Wright said of Kelce. “He’s one that believes on staying warm on the sideline and then going out there for the 5, 6, 8 minutes, whatever an offensive drive is, then come back over and get warm when he comes off the field.” Although the Dolphins vs. Chiefs game is chilly, it won’t be the coldest NFL game ever played. That distinction goes to the 1967 NFL Championship game between the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys, which took place in negative -13 degree weather with a negative -48 wind chill. In the AFC Wild Card Game against the Miami Dolphins, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice scored the first touchdown for the team with an 11-yard pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes.",

    "text": "La battaglia di Elon Musk contro Microsoft: il caso OpenAI si amplifica.\nAd agosto, [Elon Musk ha fatto causa a OpenAI e Sam Altman](https://tech.everyeye.it/notizie/elon-musk-ritorno-causa-openai-sam-altman-734336.html) per averlo \"tratto in inganno\" e per aver danneggiato xAI con un accordo con Microsoft. Difficile dire se queste accuse reggeranno in tribunale, ma ciò che è certo è che il miliardario fa sul serio: a quanto pare, addirittura, vorrebbe trascinare persino Microsoft sul banco degli imputati.\nNelle scorse ore, riporta il [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/technology/elon-musk-microsoft-openai.html), Elon Musk ha modificato la sua causa legale contro OpenAI per includere anche Microsoft tra gli imputati che dovranno presentarsi in tribunale. Tra i querelanti, inoltre, ora non figura più solo il nome di Musk, ma anche quello di xAI, l'[azienda dietro all'IA di Grok](https://tech.everyeye.it/notizie/grok-xai-diventera-open-source-musk-risponde-openai-sam-altman-704599.html), e quello di Shivon Zilis, ex-membro del board di OpenAI e madre di tre dei figli del tycoon, che non sarebbe stata informata della partnership della startup di Sam Altman con Microsoft proprio per via del suo rapporto con Musk.\nIl nodo della causa resta sempre lo stesso: secondo il CEO di Tesla e SpaceX, OpenAI avrebbe violato il suo codice da non-profit stringendo una collaborazione con Microsoft. La questione è stata sollevata da tempo da Elon Musk, che prima ha denunciato OpenAI in un tribunale statale in Texas e poi ha ritirato la causa per ripresentarla a stretto giro in una corte federale. Dopo che Musk si è ritirato dal board di OpenAI, l'azienda ha iniziato a ricevere cospicui finanziamenti da Microsoft, al punto che oggi molti credono che [Microsoft si comprerà la startup IA di Sam Altman](https://tech.everyeye.it/notizie/futuro-scritto-microsoft-acquistera-openai-entro-3-anni-secondo-analista-747548.html) nel giro di tre anni.\nLa causa legale del miliardario sudafricano solleva anche delle questioni di Antitrust: [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/musks-amended-lawsuit-against-openai-names-microsoft-as-defendant/), infatti, riporta che Elon Musk crede che OpenAI stia eliminando la concorrenza con delle politiche aggressive, a partire proprio dalla partnership con Microsoft. Tra le altre figure citate nei documenti processuali ci sono anche il Vicepresidente di Microsoft Dee Templeton e il co-fondatore di LinkedIn Reid Hoffmann, che erano legati sia OpenAI che a Microsoft al momento della stipula della collaborazione tra le due aziende.\nFONTE:\n[Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musk-adds-microsoft-as-defendant-in-his-lawsuit-against-openai-140023400.html)Questo testo include collegamenti di affiliazione: se effettui un acquisto o un ordine attraverso questi collegamenti, il nostro sito potrebbe ricevere una commissione in linea con la nostra [pagina etica](https://www.everyeye.it/advertising/).

    "title": "La cruda autocrítica de Carlos Alcaraz tras su derrota en el US Open en segunda ronda",
    "text": "Con 35 días de diferencia, [Carlos Alcaraz](https://www.ole.com.ar/tenis/carlos-alcaraz-record-novak-djokovic-wimbledon_0_M64YIqty85.html) conquistó Roland Garros y Wimbledon. Como si fuera poco, también llegó a la final de los Juegos Olímpicos, donde obtuvo la medalla de plata. Sin embargo, quedó eliminado del US Open en segunda ronda luego de caer por 6-1, 7-5 y 6-4 ante Botic Van De Zandschulp (74°) en dos horas y 19 minutos. Sabía mejor que nadie que por la gran temporada que tuvo era uno de los favoritos. Por lo tanto, una vez que terminó el fatídico duelo contra el neerlandés, el murciano alzó las manos en el aire e hizo un gesto de perdón frente al público. Además, hizo una fuerte autocrítica. \"Siento que di pasos hacia atrás a nivel mental y no entiendo por qué\", confesó en la conferencia de prensa. Acto seguido, reforzó: \"Venía de hacer un verano espectacular. Salí de esos torneos diciendo que mentalmente había dado un paso al frente. Me había dado cuenta de que para ganar grandes cosas, para ganar títulos de Grand Slam, había que estar duro de cabeza y vine a esta gira y di pasos hacia atrás\". A su vez, el número 3 del mundo encendió varias alarmas con una preocupante declaración sobre su estado de ánimo. \"Mentalmente no estoy bien, no estoy fuerte. Ante los problemas no sé controlarme y no sé cómo gestionarlo\", soltó. Ya más calmado, Alcaraz reflexionó sobre los tiempos, una queja que también existe en el mundo del fútbol. \"Ha sido un verano con muchas emociones, muy exigente. El calendario es muy apretado\", indicó. Luego, tuvo un poco de compasión consigo mismo. \"He tenido mis momentos de desconexión pero pienso que me estoy conociendo todavía. Quizás, como persona, necesito más tiempo. Tengo que ir conociéndome a mí mismo, lo que necesito. A lo mejor yo soy un tipo de persona que ante un calendario así se exige mentalmente más de la cuenta. Tengo que ver qué pasa exactamente\", reconoció. Para cerrar, explicó que tiene varios compromisos por delante pero que necesita parar la pelota para pensar. \"Ahora mismo la verdad es que no quiero decir algo porque puede ser totalmente lo contrario. Tengo que hablar con la gente cercana, con mi equipo, con mi gente, y ver a ver qué pasos vamos a seguir. Obviamente tengo torneos por delante, pero sinceramente no quiero pensar en nada de ello\", remarcó. Cabe destacar que esta es la segunda eliminación más temprana de su carrera luego de la de Wimbledon 2021, torneo en el que perdió por 6-4, 6-1 y 6-2 ante Daniil Medveded (5°) cuando solo tenía 18 años. Aunque en aquella oportunidad también se quedó afuera en la segunda ronda, fue premiado por ser el tenista más joven de la competencia. La palabra de Van De Zandschulp luego de eliminar a Carlos Alcaraz en US Open \"Estoy un poco sin palabras. Ha sido una noche increíble. Es la primera vez en mi carrera que juego una sesión de noche en el Arthur Ashe Stadium. La gente en las gradas estuvo increíble. Gracias por ello. Es una noche inolvidable\", aseguró Botic Van De Zandschulp luego de la victoria ante Carlos Alcaraz.",

    "text": "Sixty percent of respondents in a recent national survey favored the use of nuclear energy, with only 25 percent opposing its use. While the latest Bisconti Research poll focuses on nuclear power and electricity generation, its findings on public interest in climate change and using a spectrum of sources to meet energy needs are consistent with a recent Pew Research Center poll on a broad set of energy policy and climate change topics. The approaches the two online surveys took to measuring public opinion on nuclear energy yielded different numbers but found some common ground.\nTo continue reading, log in or create a free account !",
