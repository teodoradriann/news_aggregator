America is composed of a melange [mixture], a salad, a mosaic of different groups\".\nRabbi Wolpe, perhaps suffering from temporary memory loss or amnesia, forgot to mention that his people are responsible for making that salad. Maybe it slipped his mind. Wolpe also says that America is a very hateful place where anti-Semitism grows for no reason other than jealousy. He adds that Jews are at the forefront of every (((movement))) but just as he's about to explain why, his momentary amnesia strikes again. Of course, there's no causation between what Jews do and why people hate them. 1.5 billion people simply woke up one day and hated Jews, for no reason at all.\n🔚\nSidenote: Ignore the \"knowmorenews\" label. It refers to the unbelievably sick crypto Jew dog, Adam Green, who pretends to be Aryan. In case you missed his blatant anti-Christian sorcery, his Jewish last name, his trips to Israel or even who he has on his shows, this inferior Jew even claims that Jews invented Christianity to dupe Christians. World class kikery. Just stay away for your own sake.",

    "title": "33,000 Boeing factory workers begin a planned strike",
    "text": "A vote on a new labor contract has resulted in the biggest strike at Boeing for 16 years, with 33,000 workers participating after the vast majority rejected the deal. On the night of September 12, 2024, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) announced that Boeing factory workers had turned down the proposed new labor contract. The rejected deal would have given Boeing factory workers a 25% salary increase over the next four years and better job security. The manufacturer is committed to producing its upcoming Boeing 797 commercial jet, which has not yet been revealed, at a unionized facility. The strike started just after voting on the contract closed, at 00:01 local time on September 12, 2024. It was officially recognized the next day, September 13, 2024, leading to thousands of Boeing workers leaving their jobs early in the morning. For a strike to take place, at least two thirds of the 33,000 workers needed to approve the tentative agreement. In the event, 94.6% of workers voted against the contract and 96% voted in favor of a strike. In the morning of September 13, 2024, IAM union made the announcement official on X (formerly Twitter), claiming that “33,000 members are officially on strike for a fair contract at Boeing”. The union added: “They're fighting for everyone – and we have their backs!” https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/MachinistsUnion\\/status\\/1834487181508841732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1834487181508841732%7Ctwgr%5E309c21eecf1a76b420c697fb6cbed7d39b73f5c7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fboeing-strike-overwhelming-vote%2F A day before the voting, Boeing’s CEO Kelly Ortberg had asked employees to accept the contract and not to strike, claiming that the strike would “jeopardize” the company’s recovery. Boeing has faced a tough year, starting with a panel blowing off to create a large hole in one of its passenger aircraft back in January 2024. This was followed by NASA leaving two of its astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS), instead of bringing them back on a Boeing CST-100 Starliner which had developed several safety issues. Boeing responded to the strike on its official website, stating that “no one benefits from a strike – not employees, company, customers or communities”. According to the company, workers currently on strike will not receive their salaries, nor will they be able to charge time off to holiday, or swap strike action with sick leave. While the strike continues, Boeing will lose much-needed cash that it gets from delivering new aircraft to airlines. This will especially impact the production of its best-selling models like the 737 MAX, the 777, and the 767 Freighter aircraft. The ultimate financial impact of this strike will depend on how long it lasts. Some experts are predicting that the action could run until November 2024, leading to a $3.5 billion loss in cash flow. If approved, the agreement would have been the first fully negotiated contract for Boeing workers in 16 years. The last strike by Boeing mechanists took place in 2008, lasting 52 days and costing around $100 million in revenue each day. \"},{\"@type\":\"NewsMediaOrganization",

    "text": "'Persons of interest' sought in 18-year-old pregnant woman's shooting death: San Antonio police [Amaris Encinas](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/5133245001/amaris-encinas/) San Antonio police are asking the public to help identify two 'persons of interest' at the scene of a fatal shooting that killed a [missing pregnant woman and](/story/news/nation/2023/12/27/savanah-nicole-soto-found-san-antonio/72039504007/) her 22-year-old boyfriend. Police announced Thursday that the male victim was Matthew Guerra, and investigators and family members presume the woman in the vehicle was [18-year-old Savanah Nicole Soto, who was carrying her unborn son](/story/news/nation/2023/12/26/savanah-soto-missing-texas-18-year-old/72030874007/), Fabian. Investigators on Thursday also released surveillance footage from a residential neighborhood in San Antonio near where the bodies were discovered Tuesday evening, in an attempt to identify the two individuals who were seen near the couple's vehicle. \"We are hoping that someone is able to identify the individuals that are seen in this video,\" McManus said at the press conference. Here's what we know. Surveillance footage may piece together events leading up to shooting In the video, the couple's Kia Optima slowly approaches a dark-colored Chevy Silverado stopping briefly to interact with the driver, who was seen exiting the vehicle. Another individual was seen exiting the victim's Kia Optima, but it's unclear if the person leaves the area alone or with the person driving the truck. The minute-long video concludes with the Kia Optima leaving the area. McManus would not confirm or deny whether the couple was alive or dead when the video was taken, citing an active investigation. \"Detectives right now are combing through days of surveillance video from several different locations where the victims were known to be. Detectives are hopeful that surveillance video will lead to the events leading up to their death,\" McManus said, adding that social media and cellphone records would also be accessed to determine the last communications with the victims. The medical examiner determined that Guerra died from a gunshot wound to the head, but that the manner of the death was still pending, according to McManus. The case is currently being investigated as a capital murder, unless they get information from the medical examiner that indicates otherwise, McManus said. Investigators said the other person found in the car has been identified as “a full-term pregnant female,” according to a [Facebook pos](https://www.facebook.com/SanAntonioPD/videos/1023556412274319/)t by the department. “I think we can be confident that the second victim was Savanah,” McManus said. Family mourns loss of Soto and unborn son Fabian A candlelight vigil with a dove release was slated for Thursday afternoon, Soto’s mother Gloria Cordova [ reminded](https://www.facebook.com/gloria.cordova.5872/posts/pfbid0276TqmNhtiuV8zzmgAuGa742rdfrLA52ZbCnkkXJYz3kNsD3B8u4ECcBxDHh87uDkl) potential attendees on Facebook. “Thank you and we appreciate everybody’s love and support. Miss you my baby girl and my baby Fabian. You are now in a beautiful Paradise where there is no bad. Till we meet again,” Cordova wrote in the post. [A GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/savanah-nicole-soto-baby-fabian?utm_campaign=p_cp%20share-sheet&utm_content=facebook_cta_control&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&mibextid=Zg00Y8&fbclid=IwAR17jQxACBw7a5JpMF3TnQvxouFxwt7rpEhClplG-hBby-n_Bd2TbLiGhQk) was created Wednesday to help assist the family give “Savanah and Baby Fabian the funeral they deserve,” according to the page. “The tragic passing of Savanah Nicole Soto and Baby Fabian has brought so much pain and heartache to us all. As we all loved Savanah and Baby Fabian so much,” the fundraiser description reads. The page has raised $10,670 as of Thursday. The couple was reported missing the day before Christmas Eve Soto was last seen Friday in Leon Valley, a city about 10 miles from downtown San Antonio. Soto’s family began to grow concerned when she failed to show up to a doctor’s appointment. Soto, who was nine months pregnant, was supposed to be induced the day she went missing. The couple was initially reported missing by Leon Valley Police Department that same day before Texas Department of Public Safety issued a Clear Alert or Coordinated Law Enforcement Adult Rescue Alert for Soto. Its purpose is to help police locate and rescue missing, kidnapped or abducted adults or adults who are in immediate danger of injury or death, according to the [ Texas Department of Public Safety.](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/intelligence-counterterrorism/clear-alert) It wasn’t immediately clear that authorities were also searching for Guerra since the alert was only issued for Soto. Both families reached out to the San Antonio Police Department to file a missing persons report before they learned that Leon Valley had already reported the pair missing. Officers did document details provided by family members in a San Antonio police information report, McManus said. San Antonio police responded to assistance requests from Leon Valley police around 4 p.m. Tuesday, McManus said. Relatives from both families were on scene when authorities arrived, telling Leon Valley police officers that they had received a tip that the missing Kia Optima was located at that address.",

    "text": "Jorge Bergoglio , al que los católicos llaman Francisco , ha decidido permitir a sus sacerdotes que bendigan a los divorciados y a los homosexuales . Algunos han tomado este anuncio como un gran avance en la posición de la Iglesia católica respecto a la homosexualidad, aunque de hecho no cambia más que el lenguaje.\nEn vez de decir que los homosexuales tienen comportamientos “contra natura” o que son “enfermos” o “pervertidos” como hacen hoy mismo algunos obispos, se permite que se les bendiga. Pero la bendición no la ha negado la Iglesia a nadie. Cuando celebra la festividad de San Antonio bendice hasta a los animales y coincidiendo con San Cristóbal , los coches.\nEl problema es que los textos canónicos en los que la Iglesia basa sus valores (la Biblia ) condenan la homosexualidad porque el sexo sólo está permitido cuando está enfocado a la reproducción de la especie. No es reconocido ni como acto de amor ni como factor de placer; sólo actividad reproductora. Por eso los obispos se oponen también al uso de la píldora, al de los preservativos y al control de natalidad en general. No es maldad, es mandato divino: “Creced y multiplicaos”.\nLa condena afecta a toda práctica sexual no encaminada a la generación, incluyendo la masturbación o el coitus interruptus . Por practicarlo, recibió Onán (de ahí viene onanismo) la muerte de manos de su Dios. La homosexualidad es un caso extremo de práctica considerada perversa.\nEl Viejo Testamento lo dejaba claro: “Si alguien se acuesta con un hombre como si se acostara con una mujer, se condenará a muerte a los dos, pues cometieron un acto infame”, Levítico (20, 13), si bien la Iglesia no pide hoy pena de muerte por estas prácticas. Si ese libro es considerado muy antiguo y se prefiere acudir al Nuevo Testamento, ahí está la Carta a los Corintios de Pablo de Tarso : “No os engañéis: ni los impuros ni los idólatras ni los adúlteros ni los afeminados ni los homosexuales ni los ladrones ni los avaros ni los borrachos ni los ultrajadores heredarán el reino de Dios”.\nLlama la atención que, pese a ser tan nutrido el grupo a los que anatemiza Pablo, la Iglesia se haya centrado apenas en un par de colectivos y no se haya mostrado igualmente firme frente a los ladrones o los avaros. En tiempos pasados, el Vaticano consideraba un grave pecado la usura.\nSi se aplicaran hoy los mismos criterios, casi toda la actividad de la banca debería ser criticada por el obispado con la misma saña que se pone en las cuestiones relacionadas con la actividad sexual. Sin embargo, no salen de los púlpitos diatribas contra los altos intereses de las hipotecas ni hay pandillas de meapilas ante las entidades de ahorro, ocupados los creyentes como están en concentrarse frente a las clínicas ginecológicas. Los católicos condenan el aborto y hasta la fecundación in vitro . Pero defienden la pena de muerte , a pesar del mandamiento mosaico: “No matarás”. A eso se le llama coherencia.\nLas condenas a la libertad sexual , sean prácticas entre hombres y mujeres o entre individuos del mismo sexo, chocan con la permisividad y tolerancia frente a comportamientos que, además de estar prohibidos por su dios, lo están también por las leyes de los hombres, como es el caso de la pederastia .\nLos obispos españoles han desdeñado, sin datos, las conclusiones de la investigación realizada por el Defensor del Pueblo e incluso la que ellos mismo encargaron a un bufete de abogados. Y, ya de paso, llama la atención el silencio de Francisco sobre el asunto. Hay quien piensa que ese silencio está relacionado con el potencial económico de la Iglesia española, gracias, entre otras cosas, a las aportaciones del Estado, las inmatriculaciones de bienes y las exenciones de impuestos, contraviniendo una vez más las palabras atribuidas a Jesús , su fundador reconocido, quien preguntado por si había que pagar impuestos respondió: “Dad al César lo que es del César y a Dios lo que es de Dios”.\nEn la Iglesia católica (como en todas partes) hay gente muy seria. Algunos de sus fieles son también homosexuales, empeñados en pertenecer a un club que no los quiere porque confían en cambiarlo desde dentro. Es un gran mérito el suyo, bogando contra viento y marea. Aunque, en realidad, nunca han estado ni la mitad de marginados que las mujeres. Los homosexuales varones pueden ordenarse sacerdotes; ellas, sean o no homosexuales, ni eso.\nA todos los benditos, felices fiestas .",

    "title": "‘A big wake-up call’: Son tells Tottenham to learn from wild defeat to Brighton",
    "text": "Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images\nSon Heung-min described Tottenham’s 4-2 Premier League defeat at Brighton on Thursday night as a “big wake-up call” after a performance that was “nowhere near the level” required.\nSpurs lacked sharpness – a consequence, surely, of being stretched by injuries – and were ripped apart by a rampant Brighton who took a 4-0 lead, the outstanding João Pedro scoring two of them from the penalty spot. Son’s team rallied in the last 10 minutes, scoring twice, and they pushed hard during nine additional minutes when they almost scored a third, advertising the wildest of comebacks.\nBut Son, who will depart in early January for Asian Cup duty with South Korea, made it clear that the response was too little, too late.\n“It is a very disappointing performance,” the captain said. “This is not how we’ve approached the season. This performance was nowhere near the level we want to play at.\n“We have to talk about the first half and the early parts of the second half rather than the end. We know we have to play like that from minute one. Every team is strong in the Premier League and if we’re not playing like the last 15 minutes in every game we’re going to struggle. This has to be a big wake-up call. The first half was not our game and not us. We have to take a big, big lesson.”\nAnge Postecoglou was upset at the award of Pedro’s first penalty for 2-0; it was given after advice from the VAR that Dejan Kulusevski had pulled Danny Welbeck’s shirt. In the 81st minute, the officials took no action following an X-rated tackle by the Brighton captain, Lewis Dunk, on Kulusevski in the build-up to Spurs’ first goal, scored by the substitute Alejo Véliz.\n“It [the first penalty] was obviously clear and obvious because it only took him [the referee, Jarred Gillett] three minutes to see it on the screen,” Postecoglou said. “VAR picked up everything today except the one tackle which nearly cost me another player.”\nRoberto De Zerbi, whose resources have also been severely depleted by injuries, said it was “the best way to finish the year”. The manager called Pedro the best player on the pitch and said: “I hope in the next year to work with him but I think it will be very tough.”",

    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — Two federal judges have issued rulings that will allow Kilmar Abrego Garcia to be released from custody while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges in Tennessee, without fear of immediate deportation.\nU.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia after denying a motion by the Justice Department to revoke a prior release order.\nIn his ruling, Crenshaw wrote that the government \"failed to carry its burden of showing that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure Abrego's appearance or the safety of others.\"\nSimultaneously, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland issued a ruling barring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from immediately detaining Abrego Garcia once he's released on bond.\nAbrego Garcia is suing the Trump administration in Maryland over his wrongful deportation in March while facing two human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\nThe combined judicial orders mean Abrego Garcia can be released from custody while awaiting trial without fear of immediate deportation. Immigration officials have also been ordered to provide Abrego Garcia 72 hours' notice if they plan to initiate removal proceedings to any country other than his native El Salvador.\nThose countries include Mexico and South Sudan.\nAbrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop where troopers suspected he was speeding while driving an SUV with nine other Hispanic men. Body camera footage captured troopers suggesting that Abrego Garcia was transporting undocumented people across state lines for money.\nAbrego Garcia, who entered the country illegally in 2011, was deported in March and sent to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, despite a 2019 court order barring his return to the country where he claimed he feared persecution from neighborhood gangs.\nHe was brought back to the U.S. in March after the Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return.\nHe walked off a plane and into a Tennessee jail, where he faced human smuggling charges that some argued were politically motivated.\nAfter extensive testimony between attorneys, Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes ultimately determined that prosecutors did not provide enough evidence to show that Abrego Garcia, whom DOJ officials accused of being a dangerous MS-13 member, was a threat to others or a flight risk.\nHolmes outlined conditions for Abrego Garcia's release, including living with his brother in Maryland, wearing an ankle monitor, seeking employment, and avoiding legal trouble.\nHowever, Abrego Garcia will remain in U.S. Marshal custody for at least the next 30 days after Holmes granted a request by both sides to delay issuing a new release order. Defense attorneys filed the motion on Sunday, saying they had reason to believe the Department of Homeland Security would begin removal proceedings to a third country immediately after Abrego Garcia was transferred into their custody.\nProsecutors did not object to the motion, as they've also stated they would rather try Abrego Garcia in Tennessee than have him deported.\nDOJ spokesperson Chad Gilmartin emphasized that \"the defendant has been charged with horrific crimes, including trafficking children, and will not walk free in our country again.\"\nDays later, a Justice Department official explained that Abrego Garcia would most likely be removed to a country other than his native El Salvador.\nJudge Xinis expressed concern that, depending on what happened in Tennessee, Abrego Garcia could be \"spirited away\" and removed from the U.S. without due process.\n\"We're a court of laws and we don't operate on 'take my word for it,'\" Xinis said.\nThe Maryland order provides Abrego Garcia some of the same protections from the 2019 order that allowed for supervised release while his immigration case is reviewed by the courts. Previously, Abrego Garcia had permission to live in Maryland and was authorized to work.\nXinis' order allows the Trump administration to initiate immigration proceedings, but only after Abrego Garcia is returned to Maryland.\nDefense attorneys in Tennessee also filed a motion on Tuesday requesting that the courts clarify the requirements of \"Local Criminal Rule 2.01\" with DHS and make it clear that none of those involved in the investigation make extrajudicial claims against Abrego Garcia.\nThey accused DHS Secretary Kristi Noem of violating court rules in her Nashville press conference, where she called Abrego Garcia a \"horrible human being and a monster\" who \"should never be released free.\"\nAbrego Garcia's attorneys said Noem’s comments, “are precisely of the type that are most likely to prejudice Mr. Abrego’s right to a fair trial. Secretary Noem assailed Mr. Abrego’s character and reputation, including with verbal insults and allegations that are irrelevant to the offenses charged in the indictment and almost certainly inadmissible at trial.”\nAccording to the filing, attorneys requested that the government issue a retraction on Monday but have not heard back from the Trump administration.\nThere's been no decision on this latest filing.\nMeanwhile, a trial date for Abrego Garcia's criminal case has been set for January 27, 2026.",
