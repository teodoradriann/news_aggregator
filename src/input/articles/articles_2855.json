    "text": "'Very different from anything we've experienced': SMUD uses lessons from January storms to improve The utility said it has examined every step of its power restoration process going into this winter. The utility said it has examined every step of its power restoration process going into this winter. The utility said it has examined every step of its power restoration process going into this winter. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District says that it now has a new benchmark for severe winter weather following the unprecedented damage caused by last January's storms. According to SMUD, 600,000 customers experienced an outage over a several-week span beginning on New Year's Eve. To restore power, the utility had to replace more than 425 poles. SMUD Chief Operating Officer Frankie McDermott said that was about a third of the replacements done in a typical year. \"This was different. This was very different from anything we've experienced,\" he said. The January 2023 storms are now the new high water mark for the kind of damage that the utility will be ready for in the future. | Storm Ready 2024 | [City of Sacramento reflects on lessons learned 1 year after a series of damaging winter storms](https://www.kcra.com/article/city-of-sacramento-damaging-winter-storms/46267960) McDermott said that shortly after the stormy pattern concluded, SMUD decision-makers met to dissect their entire outage response process. \"We really had to look at our overall system over the last year to be prepared for storms that are going to be more severe in the future,\" McDermott said. In addition to increases in inventory, SMUD has also added new technology to improve in-house communication. An app will allow responders in the field to quickly tell decision-makers exactly what equipment has been damaged and to what extent. Logistics for delivering replacement materials have also been restructured. McDermott said he believes that by making these changes at each step of the restoration process, SMUD customers can expect more efficient response times and more accurate communication from the utility. \"I think the public can be reassured that we will be even more efficient at each step driven out of the experiences we saw in January,\" McDermott added. SMUD customers can now sign up for [more detailed notifications](https://myaccount.smud.org/manage/outage) during an outage. The new service will provide updates on when a crew is called to an outage, when a repair is ordered and an estimate of how long that repair could take. This is in addition to the estimated time of power restoration. It was one year ago that severe storms hit Northern California.

    "text": ">\nKOTA KINABALU, Feb 23 ― A full-time housewife was fined RM8,000 by a Magistrate’s Court here yesterday for submitting a fake Shariah High Court order for her application to change her religion from Islam to Christianity.\nMagistrate Lovely Natasha Charles ordered Nur Sarimah Subuka to be jailed for 18 months if she failed to furnish her fine.\nIt was learnt that the 23-year-old woman had paid her fine yesterday.\nAdvertisement When Nur Sarimah’s plea for a charge under Regulation 25 (1) (b) of the National Registration Regulations 1990 (amendment 2007) was about to be recorded, she said that she only submitted the letter to the National Registration Department (NRD).\n“But the letter was from someone,” she further said.\nThe magistrate then asked her whether she pleaded guilty to the charge, Nur Sarimah answered “Yes”.\nAdvertisement “There is no ‘but’ if you want to admit to this offence, if you want to admit, you have to admit as per what the charge against you, so are you admitting to this offence?” the magistrate asked Nur Sarimah.\nNur Sarimah then answered again “Yes”.\nThe court heard that Nur Sarimah went to the Identity Card Division of the NRD Kota Kinabalu to make an amendment to her religion status and to change her name.\nNur Sarimah had submitted supported documents for his application to be processed namely her MyKad, her birth certificate, a NRD form whom she already filled up and the said order to change her Islam faith.\nPutrajaya NRD found that Nur Sarimah had submitted a fake document which was the said fake order letter.\nA police report was then lodged by the complainant and an investigation had been carried out for this case.\nNur Sarimah admitted to committing the offence at a counter of the NRD on September 12, 2022.\nIn mitigation, National Legal Aid Foundation counsel Lim Ming Zoong @ Lawrence, who represented Nur Sarimah, prayed for a non-custodial sentence be imposed on his client and requested for a lower amount of fine punishment.\nThe counsel submitted that Nur Sarimah is married, has two kids and her husband is working.\nLim explained that Nur Sarimah told her that she was informed by a runner that the application would get through as long as there was payment in exchange for changing her faith.\nLim submitted that Nur Sarimah was involved in this case two years ago but she still came to court and had pleaded guilty to her charge which had saved court’s time.\n“She wanted to change her religion to Christianity because she was raised in a broken family. She claimed her father had abandoned them and she was solely raised by her mother, who is a single mom with Christian background,” the counsel explained.\nIn reply, the prosecution urged the court to impose an appropriate sentence against the accused.\nThe prosecution argued that even though Nur Sarimah had pleaded guilty to the charge, it was still important to remember that her action had serious implications for integrity of the legal system and public trust.\nThe prosecution further submitted that failure to impose an appropriate punishment would send the wrong signal to the public and could encourage would-be offenders to engage in a similar activity. ― Borneo Post pic",
