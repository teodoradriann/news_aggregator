    "title": "Cleveland's Muni Lot is packed with Browns fans looking for a win Thursday and a playoff spot | Ideastream Public Media",
    "text": "The air in Cleveland was thick with anticipation and optimism Thursday as Browns fans prepped for a face-off against the New York Jets.\nYgal Kaufman / Ideastream Public Media Giovanni Castelli and Paul Kaspick have been friends since second grade and have been tailgating Browns games together for over 19 years. They insist the Muni Lot is the best place on earth to tailgate and the only place they'll do it. If they prevail, the Browns will clinch a spot in the playoffs. The team has only pulled that off two other times since they rejoined the NFL in 1999: once in 2002 and again in 2020.\nNicole Bozickovich grew up a Steelers fan but she and her husband Brandon have been a Browns season ticket holder for four years.\n\"This is the whole reason to be here,\" she said while tailgating in the city's Municipal Lot Downtown. \"It's the environment, everyone here and then walking into the stadium just getting to feel the energy before you're even in the game.\"\nYgal Kaufman / Ideastream Public Media Nicole Bozickovich comes to tailgate regularly with her husband Brandon and their friends, and she says the atmosphere is unlike any other. Giovanni Castelli and his friend Paul Kaspick met in second grade and have been tailgating together with their group, named the Muni-Lot Degenerates, for over 19 years.\n\"Good times are here finally,\" Castelli said. \"There's been a lot of pain and suffering, you can say, but good times are here.\"\nThe team will be led by Joe Flacco, who stepped in as starting quarterback after Deshaun Watson's season-ending injury in November. Flacco most recently played for the Jets.\nYgal Kaufman / Ideastream Public Media Being \"wacko for Flacco\" has become one of the most commonly heard refrains around the city of Cleveland for the last month. It's the perfect storm for Adam Watters, who, despite being an Akron native, is a Jets fan. He said he saw a Jets game on TV when he was a kid and fell in love with Chad Pennington. This is his second time coming to tailgate a Browns-Jets game here in Cleveland while wearing his Jets gear.\nYgal Kaufman / Ideastream Public Media Adam Watters has no fear proudly wearing his Jets colors, despite him being from Akron. Perhaps his comfort comes from being flanked by a bevy of friends who bleed brown and orange. \"Last time we got a hard time... It's been pretty, pretty chill today,\" Watters said at the Muni Lot. \"They should beat us, and they're not giving us too many problems today.\"",

    "text": "Organizations challenging the constitutionality of Kenya’s Maisha Namba digital ID in court fear for the safety and security of citizens’ data as more than 450 different entities are expected to be allowed access to the database.This is what the petitioners told the Kenyan High Court recently, buttressing their challenge of the biometrics-backed digital ID’s rollout, according to The Standard. Some of the entities to be granted access to the Maisha Namba database include the Kenyan Police – which raises fears of state surveillance -- and other bodies not providing essential government services.At the close of July, the High Court placed another injunction on Maisha Namba issuance, pending further hearing and a final ruling on the matter. A ruling is expected to happen this coming Monday, per the outlet.In their recent arguments against the digital ID, legal representatives of Haki na Sheria and Katiba Institute -- the two organizations which have taken the government to court – said authorities have not disclosed an appropriate data protection plan or other data sharing agreements with these entities.While the lawyers of the petitioners argue that the actions of the government in the implementation of the Maisha Namba project are illegal and the program should be definitively halted, those of the Ministry of Interior think the injunction should be lifted as the pause in digital ID rollout is penalizing about 1.2 million Kenyans who already applied for their cards but cannot have them.The Interior Ministry lawyers have also argued that no new data is being collected for the Maisha Namba scheme. Instead, it is “an upgrade of the second-generation ID,” said government lawyer George Ogembo, as quoted by The Standard.Recently, Kenya’s Commission on Administrative Justice, known commonly in the country as the Ombudsman, raised concerns about the problems rocking ID issuance in the country. In a statement, the government agency called on the director of the National Registration Bureau to explain not only reasons for the huge ID card issuance backlog, but also all the measures that are being taken to address the problem.The Maisha Namba is said to be a welcomed initiative among many Kenyans, but the road to its full implementation has been rugged and ensnared with several hurdles which the government is being called upon to surmount.",

    "text": "It’s hard to visit Palermo without understanding the deep devotion that binds locals with their patron saint, St. Rosalia. The urban landscape of Palermo itself is dominated by the relationship between locals and the saint, with the Sanctuary of Santa Rosalia towering over the Sicilian city from its hilltop location on [Mount Pellegrino](https://www.italia.it/en/sicily/palermo/monte-pellegrino). According to a local tale, it was in a cave on this mountain just outside the city that on July 15, 1624, the relics of Rosalia – a local noblewoman who had retired to Mount Pellegrino to live her devotion as a hermit – were found inside a cave. After the miraculous find, the [relics were paraded](/2021/09/08/when-saint-rosalia-helped-palermo-fight-the-plague/) through the city and the fast-spreading plague that had been tormenting locals for months ended. Since then, Palermitani adopted Santa Rosalia as their patron saint with a moving and heartfelt celebration taking place each year during the Feast of Saint Rosalia on July 15, culminating with a procession from Palermo up to Mount Pellegrino. This year marks the 400th anniversary of the discovery of the miraculous remains of Santa Rosalia and Palermo will celebrate the “Santuzza” (“little saint” in Sicilian) with a rich calendar of events and cultural initiatives starting from May until early 2025. Rosalia 400 One of the highlights of the celebrations is the monumental exhibition called “Rosalia 400” set up in [Palazzo Branciforte](https://www.palazzobranciforte.it/), curated by Laura Barreca with the support of the European Union’s Cultural Heritage Active Innovation for Next-Gen Sustainable Society Program, which includes a guided walk inside the [Monte dei Pegni](https://www.tripadvisor.it/ShowUserReviews-g187890-d3317049-r431107826-Museo_Palazzo_Branciforte-Palermo_Province_of_Palermo_Sicily.html), a large room lined with ceiling-high wooden shelves that used to host Palermo’s pawnshop where citizens could sell objects for cash. The pawnshop, locally known as “Monte Santa Rosalia,” has played a crucial role in the daily lives of people since its establishment in 1800. The heart of “Rosalia 400” is a multi-disciplinary exhibition called “The Carriage, the Feast, and the Saint” curated by the Beaux Art Academy, focusing on the themes of rebirth, resilience, and devotion. Hosted inside former horse stables, it features drawings, photographs, and various visual materials documenting the celebration of Santa Rosalia over the years, including photographs from iconic Palermo photographer [Letizia Battaglia](https://www.icp.org/browse/archive/constituents/letizia-battaglia?all/all/all/all/0). “This year Palermo is going to celebrate a journey that began in 1624 and today is marking 400 years of history and traditions,” said the Mayor of the Municipality of Palermo, Roberto Lagalla, in a [press release]. “It is going to be a busy year of celebrations dedicated to Santa Rosalia which, thanks to the active participation of the entire territory and institutions, will allow the tourist revival of the city with a renewed metropolitan internationally oriented identity.” Celebrations will likely draw many devotees from the US, where Catholics of Sicilian heritage [maintain](https://columbuscitizens.org/blog-post-2/#:~:text=This%20year%2C%202024%2C%20marks%20an,due%20to%20their%20Sicilian%20ancestry.) a special devotion to St. Rosalia with dedicated parades held each year in New York. For the duration of the 400th anniversary celebrations, visitors will be able to explore the Sicilian capital with dedicated [spiritual](https://www.scent-of-sicily.com/news/5-itineraries-to-discover-palermo-folklore/) and [cultural](https://freewalkingtouritalia.com/products/palermo-unesco-tour) itineraries that explore the complex and rich history of this city built at the crossroads of the Mediterranean. “Palermo will express itself in all its beauty, through spiritual and cultural itineraries, showing the world its priceless historical and artistic heritage,” Mayor Lagalla concluded.",

    "text": "The Palestinian foreign ministry has welcomed a request by Chile and Mexico for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate crimes against civilians, as Israel’s war on Gaza continues unabated.\nIsraeli attacks have devastated the Gaza Strip since Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack inside Israel on October 7 that killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel retaliated with a relentless air and ground offensive that has killed more than 24,600 people, about 70 percent of them children, women and the elderly, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza.\nIn a statement on Thursday, Mexico’s foreign ministry said the referral “is due to the growing concern over the latest escalation of violence, particularly against civilian targets”.\nIt added that the court based in The Hague was the proper forum to establish potential criminal responsibility, citing “numerous reports from the United Nations that detail many incidents that could constitute crimes under the ICC’s jurisdiction”.\nMeanwhile in Chile’s capital, Santiago, foreign minister Alberto van Klaveren said in a news conference that the country supports “the investigation of any possible war crime … whether they are war crimes committed by Israelis or by Palestinians”.\nThe Palestinian foreign ministry welcomed the move.\n“The referral confirms the urgent need for the Court to fulfill its mandate, to deter, investigate and prosecute the most serious crimes of concern for the international community,” a ministry statement said on Friday.\n“Israeli officials are not deterred as they continue with their genocidal war,” the statement added.\nMexico said it was closely following the case presented last week before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in which South Africa accused Israel of carrying out genocide in Gaza and demanded that the court order an emergency suspension of Israel’s military campaign. Israel rejected the accusation.\nBoth the ICJ and the ICC handle cases of alleged genocide, with the former resolving disputes between states and the latter prosecuting individuals for crimes.\nThe ICC opened an investigation into Israel as well as Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups for possible war crimes in the Palestinian territories in 2021.\nICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said in November that the investigation now “extends to the escalation of hostilities and violence” since the October 7 attacks.\nHis remarks followed calls from South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, the Comoros and Djibouti for an ICC investigation into the conflict.\nIsrael is not a member of the ICC and does not recognise its jurisdiction.\nThe post Palestinians welcome Chile and Mexico’s call for ICC probe into Gaza war appeared first on Al Jazeera .",

    "text": "Summary: Learning a new language isn’t just about practice—it’s about sleep. Researchers found that sleep enhances memory of new words and grammar by synchronizing specific brainwave patterns during NREM sleep.\nParticipants who slept after learning performed significantly better than those who stayed awake, highlighting sleep’s transformative role in learning. These insights may inform future treatments for language-related impairments and improve educational strategies.\nKey Facts:\nSleep boosts language learning by coordinating brainwaves (slow oscillations and spindles) during NREM sleep. Participants who slept after learning a new language performed better than those who didn’t. The findings could aid in treating language impairments, such as aphasia and autism spectrum disorder. Source: University of South Australia\nSleep is critical for all sorts of reasons, but a team of international scientists has discovered a new incentive for getting eight hours of sleep every night: it helps the brain to store and learn a new language.\nA study led by the University of South Australia (UniSA) and published in the Journal of Neuroscience has revealed that the coordination of two electrical events in the sleeping brain significantly improves our ability to remember new words and complex grammatical rules.\nThose who slept performed significantly better compared to those who remained awake. Credit: Neuroscience News In an experiment with 35 native English-speaking adults, researchers tracked the brain activity of participants learning a miniature language called Mini Pinyin that is based on Mandarin but with similar grammatical rules to English.\nHalf of the participants learned Mini Pinyin in the morning and then returned in the evening to have their memory tested. The other half learned Mini Pinyin in the evening and then slept in the laboratory overnight while their brain activity was recorded. Researchers tested their progress in the morning.\nThose who slept performed significantly better compared to those who remained awake.\nLead researcher Dr Zachariah Cross, who did his PhD at UniSA but is now based at Northwestern University in Chicago, says sleep-based improvements were linked to the coupling of slow oscillations and sleep spindles – brainwave patterns that synchronise during NREM sleep.\n“This coupling likely reflects the transfer of learned information from the hippocampus to the cortex, enhancing long-term memory storage,” Dr Cross says.\n“Post-sleep neural activity showed unique patterns of theta oscillations associated with cognitive control and memory consolidation, suggesting a strong link between sleep-induced brainwave co-ordination and learning outcomes.”\nUniSA researcher Dr Scott Coussens says the study underscores the importance of sleep in learning complex linguistic rules.\n“By demonstrating how specific neural processes during sleep support memory consolidation, we provide a new perspective on how sleep disruption impacts language learning,” Dr Coussens says.\n“Sleep is not just restful; it’s an active, transformative state for the brain.”\nThe findings could also potentially inform treatments for individuals with language-related impairments, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and aphasia, who experience greater sleep disturbances than other adults.\nResearch on both animals and humans shows that slow oscillations improve neural plasticity – the brain’s ability to change and adapt in response to experiences and injury.\n“From this perspective, slow oscillations could be increased via methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation to accelerate aphasia-based speech and language therapy,” Dr Cross says.\nIn future, the researchers plan to explore how sleep and wake dynamics influence the learning of other complex cognitive tasks.\n“Understanding how the brain works during sleep has implications beyond language learning. It could revolutionise how we approach education, rehabilitation, and cognitive training.”\nAbout this language, sleep, and memory research news Author: Candy Gibson\nSource: University of South Australia\nContact: Candy Gibson – University of South Australia\nImage: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\nOriginal Research: Closed access.\n“ Slow oscillation-spindle coupling predicts sequence-based language learning ” by Zachariah Cross et al.

    "text": "Celebrations will be happening around the Red Deer area this weekend to mark the end of 2023 and the start of a brand-new year. From a two-day dance party to a dinner-side performance by a mariachi band, your choice of entertainment could depend on your stamina level. The electronic music starts up at 9 p.m. on Saturday night at the Glitter and Glow New Year’s event — and it continues on through New Year’s Eve Sunday night. Featuring performances by Eric Allen, Rich Glow, Van Damage, K2, Sean Lamb, Charles Parker and more, the dance party will take up the entire eighth floor of the Stantec Building, with floor-to ceiling windows offering a 360-degree views of Red Deer’s downtown. (Tickets are through showpass.com.) Meanwhile, many local live music venues are also offering music, as well as midnight champagne toasts, confetti guns and snacks. This includes the Silver Buckle in the Quality Inn hosting a 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. New Year’s Eve Cowboy Rave on Sunday, with entertainment by DJ Shugaboy. (The same venue will be holding a “Pre-New Year’s Eve” event on Saturday night, featuring musician Brandon Lorenzo.) The Vat Pub will featuring Hytami and Phonik OPS and special guests on New Year’s Eve, while Bo’s Bar and Stage will present a throwback Y2K New Year’s Eve party with The Discmen, celebrating “Big Shiny Tunes and the Millennium.” For a more laid-back vibe, several area restaurants will be bringing in live music — including the Mariachi Borealis band, entertaining at Red Deer’s Taco Loft on Sunday night. Red Deer singer Randi Boulton will perform on New Year’s Eve at the Black and White Gala at the Son of a Beach restaurant on Sylvan Lake’s Lakeshore Drive. Diners are invited to “dress to impress” in black and white attire to ring in 2024. And the Canadian Brew House in Red Deer will be hosting special New Year’s Eve party with a prize draw. As for parents with younger kids, a Rockin’ New Year’s Family Party will be held Sunday evening at the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame with a DJ, party games, pizza and museum access from 6 p.m. (Yes, the balloon will drop at 9 p.m.) To help 2024 enter with a bang, the Town of Sylvan Lake will once again be setting off a Jan. 1 fireworks display at 7 p.m., above the main pier. While the fireworks are free to experience, more information about ticketed New Year’s Eve events are available from the venues.",
