    "text": "LOVELAND, Colo. — The parents of Gabby Petito are using the story of their daughter's disappearance and murder to help raise awareness about domestic violence in Colorado.\nOn Wednesday, Petito's mother and stepfather Nichole and Jim Schmidt attended the Purple Ribbon Breakfast event in Loveland to support the local nonprofit Alternatives to Violence.\nPetito's story garnered world-wide attention after she was killed by her fiancé Brian Laundrie during a cross-country trip in 2021. Her body was discovered in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming three to four weeks after she had been killed. Laundrie initially drove the van the two were traveling in back to his parent's home in Florida where he refused to discuss Gabby's whereabouts with police. He eventually took his own life and his remains were found in an environmental park in Florida.\nThe Alternatives to Violence nonprofit in Loveland said this year's Purple Ribbon Breakfast event was one of the largest they have ever seen, with more than 500 people in attendance.\nKari Clark, executive director for Alternatives to Violence, said she believes that was because Petito's story reached so many people world-wide, and people wanted to gather in Denver to hear from her mother and stepfather.\n\"I think it really touched a lot of people's hearts. And as soon as they saw that we were having them come speak, people wanted to learn more, and it's a very tragic situation to have to happen for people to be educated on what can happen if you're in a DV situation,\" Clark said.\nPetito's parents now are using their family's tragedy as a powerful call for action. Part of their work includes traveling around the country to speak at different events, like the one in Colorado.\nPetito's parents have also launched the Gabby Petito Foundation that aids organizations that help locate missing persons and ones that support domestic violence victims through education, awareness and prevention.\nDenver7 spoke with Petito's parents exclusively about their efforts to shed a light on this important topic.\n\"We think that a life could be saved by someone connecting with her story,\" said Petito's mother. \"When I speak about her, it makes a difference.\"\n\"We're just very appreciative of everybody here in Colorado,\" her stepfather said. \"This was an amazing turnout for Alternatives to Violence, and everybody's just been so supportive here. And we ask that you take that support and support your local nonprofits like ATV and other agencies to help them continue the great work.\"\nClark added that their nonprofit receives more than 200 crisis calls every month.\n\"People don't like to talk about it, but everybody needs help. There's prevention — but getting out of the situation is hard, and especially in the economic times that we are in now, it's really difficult for people to leave,\" Clark said.\nClark said that it's a critical time for the community to support nonprofits while many are facing uncertainty with federal funding.\n\"It's up in the air. It's an unknown,\" she said. \"We do everything in our power, too, but having events like this and raising awareness and hoping to bring in critical funds is very necessary.\"\nDenver7 asked Petito's mother what she wants people to remember most about her daughter.\n\"Just remember Gabby's spirit the way she was — be fearless. Live in the moment. There might not be a tomorrow. So love your loved ones. Be kind, just all the good things. Enjoy your life while you're here, because it could be gone in an instant,\" she said.\nYou can donate to Alternatives to Violence here.\nDenver7 is committed to making a difference in our community by standing up for what's right, listening, lending a helping hand and following through on promises. See that work in action, in the videos above.",

    "text": "Perhaps, the greatest tragedy of human history is man’s failure to achieve a high level of God-realization, or deeper discovery of God. The way to attain realization of God is to contemplate in God’s creations. Prior to the scientific age, humans knew very little about the creations of God. In ancient times, the framework did not exist which was required for attaining a high level of God-realization.\nIn present times, the scientific revolution has made available to a person that superior framework which was predicted thus in the Quran: “We shall show them Our signs in the universe and within themselves, until it becomes clear to them that this is the Truth.” (41:53)\nIn ancient times, because of the absence of any scientific framework, it was difficult to attain a high level of realization. Even in present times, in spite of the scientific framework available to man, he has not been able to attain a high level of God-realization, the reason being that, in present times, man has been diverted from thinking positively. This, without doubt, has been the greatest deprivation for an individual.\nA high realization of God is the greatest of blessings for a person and it is possible for everyone to reach such a high level of realization. But for this to happen, one must completely desist from negative thinking. Positive thinking is essential in all circumstances.\nThose who can fulfill this condition will certainly succeed in attaining a high level of realization.\nIt is a tragedy of human history that the majority of human beings have fallen into negative thinking on one pretext or the other. They have not been able to adhere to positive thinking and have, therefore, not been able to attain God-realization. This is the greatest reason for the unattainability of a high level of realization.",

    "title": "Hong Kong consumer watchdog records 17,000 online shopping complaints in 2024 | South China Morning Post",
    "text": "Hong Kong’s consumer watchdog recorded 17,000 complaints linked to online shopping last year, accounting for about 40 per cent of all cases, with problems including an inability to return products, delays that caused fines and loss of packages.\\nThe Consumer Council also revealed on Thursday that 148 online shopping complaints related to logistics services were received between January and July in 2024, which nearly doubled to 279 this year over the same period.\\nOne such complaint involved a defective computer monitor, valued at 1,650 yuan (US$230), that could not be returned, despite the mainland Chinese e-commerce platform advertising a local return service in Hong Kong.\\nThe complainant initially brought the product back to the logistics provider’s service point in Fo Tan as per the local return policy and received her HK$72 delivery fee refund. But she was told her product was “ineligible” for local return service, prompting her to file a complaint with the platform.\\nUpon the intervention of the council, a refund was issued, with the whole process taking 2½ months.\\nAnother complaint was due to a lag between the sending and receiving times of a mobile text message, which resulted in a late fee for the customer despite collecting the package from a self-pickup locker within the designated time frame of 24 hours.\\nThe council said the complainant received a text message from a courier at 12.27pm on January 1 to collect her package that she picked up at 12.14pm the next day but was still charged a late fee of HK$10.\\n\\nShe sought the council’s help after her complaint to the courier was not addressed. It was revealed that the fine was a result of the courier’s system recording the text message as being sent at 10.47am, with the firm acknowledging the technical issue and offering a refund for the late fee.\\nIn a separate case, a customer was told that the items in his 270 yuan (HK$295) package had already been picked up when he visited the collection point after receiving a confirmation of its arrival from a logistics company.\\nHe lodged a complaint with the council after observing how packages at this self-pickup point, which managed items for multiple logistic providers, appeared to be unattended in a back alley accessible to passers-by.\\nHe raised concerns about the verification procedure of customer identity and inadequate security. Upon the intervention of the council and the confirmation of the loss of the package from the logistics company, a full refund was issued.\\nThe watchdog urged the industry to review its operations to ensure they met service commitments, as disputes could undermine consumer confidence.\\nFrancis Ho Ying-fu, deputy chief executive of the council, said the success rate of resolving cases related to online shopping logistics services was about 50 to 60 per cent over the years.\\nHo stopped short of revealing the companies involved in the cases the council had dealt with.\\n“Once products involve cross-border online shopping, customers should understand the clauses and conditions involved, and whether there is protection, such as whether terms apply in Hong Kong,” he said.\\n“If disputes arise, unless the terms stipulate that they can be dealt with in Hong Kong, they’d have to be handled according to the regulations of the place of origin of the company, and could be difficult for customers to follow up.”\\nAccording to Ho, the council would refer cases related to e-commerce platforms to consumer organisations on the mainland to follow up, which had a success rate of about 70 to 80 per cent. The rate for European and US cases was not high, he added.\\n",
