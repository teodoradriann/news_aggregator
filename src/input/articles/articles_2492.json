    "text": "(Photo : Miami Dade Corrections ) Gregory Fitzgerald Gibert, 53, was initially arrested on a second-degree murder charge in the killing of a transgender woman whose body was found near the Miami City Ballet. Family members of a [homeless woman beaten to death](https://www.hngn.com/articles/259991/20240424/trans-woman-killed-pipe-florida-attack-sleeping-homeless-random.htmhttps://) in her sleep are seeking answers as her accused killer appeared via video to face formal charges, according to a report. Andrea Dorias Dos Passos, 37, was found beaten to death outside the Miami City Ballet on Tuesday morning, HNGN previously reported. Passos identified as a transgender woman and was homeless, [according to WPLG.](https://www.local10.com/news/local/2024/04/24/man-arrested-after-transgender-woman-found-beaten-to-death-outside-miami-city-ballet-building/https://) Passos' stepfather, Victor Van Gilst, said his family is devastated. \"I knew one day this could happen,\" Van Gilst said to [NBCMiami.](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/family-of-slain-miami-beach-transgender-woman-seeks-answers-as-suspect-in-court/3294803/https://) \"I need to go through the stages of anger and grief and denial and acceptance and all that,\" he added. Gregory Fitzgerald Gilbert, 53, was arrested on a second-degree murder charge in the killing of the 37-year-old. Gibert went before Miami-Dade Judge Mindy Glazer on Thursday by video after failing to appear for a bond court appearance on Wednesday. Glazer concluded there was probable cause to charge Gilbert with a more serious offense. \"I've had a chance to review the arrest affidavit; to me, it looks like it should be a first-degree murder, not a second-degree, based on the facts alleged in this arrest affidavit,\" the judge said. Investigators discovered surveillance video capturing Gilbert beating Dos Passos with a metal pipe as she slept near the entrance of the building, according to an arrest report filed by Miami Beach Police. Upon discovering Passos' body, law enforcement officials discovered lacerations to her head and face, a puncture wound to her chest, and two wooden sticks lodged in her nostrils The suspect can be seen dumping the metal pipe in a nearby trash can in the footage. Police were able to track down Gilbert after retrieving the weapon and obtaining his fingerprints. He was found with bloodstained shoes and basketball shoes, per the report. Records reveal Gilbert had just been released from jail, where he was being held for armed robbery and aggravated assault, a week before committing the crime. While prosecutors sought at least a 10-year prison sentence for the attempted robbery of a moped, the case wasn't strong enough to go to trial, in part due to a corroborating witness's repeated failure to appear in court. Gilbert was given four years of probation instead. Miami Beach spokesman Christopher Bess does not believe the evidence points to a hate crime, commenting, \"The evidence does not allude to the fact that the defendant targeted the victim based on her sexual orientation or gender.\" The victim's stepfather told NBC Miami he wants answers and said Dos Passos had struggled with mental health issues in recent years. \"I think that the system let her down. At this moment, I also have the feeling that I let her down,\" Van Gilst expressed. Nobody deserves this. \"Nobody deserves this, to die like this.\" Gibert, who's known as a habitual violent offender, faces a possible life sentence if convicted on the first-degree murder charge. A motive for the crime remains unknown.",

    "text": "The Future of Medicine: How the AMA is Shaping the next Generation of Physicians Are you ready for a healthcare system that truly supports its doctors, allowing them to focus on what matters most: patient care? The American Medical Association (AMA) is actively working to shape that future, addressing critical issues like physician burnout, exam support, and streamlined compliance training. Let’s dive into how these policies could revolutionize the medical landscape.\nStreamlining Compliance: A Win-Win for Doctors and Patients Imagine a world where doctors aren’t bogged down by redundant compliance training. The AMA is pushing for reciprocity programs that allow physicians to earn credit for training completed at one healthcare facility and apply it to others. This could free up valuable time, allowing doctors to spend more time with patients.\nThe Problem with Redundancy Physicians practicing at multiple hospitals often face the frustrating reality of repeating the same compliance training modules at each facility. This is not only a waste of time but also contributes to administrative burdens that pull doctors away from patient care.\nThe Solution: Reciprocity and Fair Compensation the AMA’s new policy supports the creation of reciprocity programs, allowing physicians to earn credit for compliance training completed at one healthcare facility toward requirements at other facilities. Furthermore, the AMA is advocating for fair compensation or CME credits for the time healthcare providers spend on these trainings.\nExpert Tip: Hospitals can start by auditing thier current compliance training programs to identify areas of overlap and potential for reciprocity. This will not only benefit physicians but also improve overall efficiency. Supporting Students: Removing Barriers to Medical Licensure The path to becoming a doctor is rigorous, filled with demanding exams and meaningful financial burdens. The AMA is advocating for greater support from the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners and National Board of Medical Examiners for medical trainees facing logistical or financial hurdles when undergoing licensure exams.\nThe High Stakes of Medical Exams Medical trainees are required to pass expensive licensure exams during their training, and failure could end their medical career. Unforeseen events, such as a family tragedy or personal crisis, can considerably disrupt a trainee’s exam preparation.\nA Call for Comprehensive Support The AMA is urging all stakeholders in graduate medical education to remove barriers and offer support to trainees during this demanding process. This includes providing financial assistance, logistical support, and mental health resources to help trainees succeed.\nDid You Know? The average medical student graduates with over $200,000 in debt. Providing financial support for licensure exams can significantly alleviate this burden. Combating Burnout: Prioritizing Physician Well-being Physician burnout is a growing crisis in the healthcare industry, leading to decreased job satisfaction, increased medical errors, and even suicide. The AMA is tackling this issue head-on by advocating for flexible burnout prevention programs that prioritize autonomy, mindfulness, and personal well-being.\nThe Pitfalls of Inflexible Programs Inflexible burnout prevention programs can actually increase stress and workload for physicians and trainees. Mandatory assignments and punitive measures can backfire,leading to resentment and further burnout.\nThe Power of Adaptability and Autonomy Effective burnout prevention programs should empower participants to choose activities that fit their needs and schedules. This includes offering a variety of options, such as mindfulness training, exercise programs, and peer support groups.\nQuick fact: Studies have shown that mindfulness-based interventions can significantly reduce burnout symptoms in physicians. Championing Physician-Lead Care: Ensuring Quality and Expertise The AMA is a staunch advocate for physician-led care, recognizing that physicians are uniquely qualified to lead patient care and ensure decisions are made with the highest level of expertise. The association is encouraging residency programs to promote opportunities for residents and trainees to engage in advocacy for physician-led care.\nThe Importance of Physician Leadership Physicians possess the knowledge,skills,and experience necessary to make informed decisions about patient care. Physician-led teams ensure that patients receive the safest, highest-quality care possible.\nEquipping the next Generation of leaders the AMA is expanding its toolkits, workshops, and educational resources that residency programs can use to teach trainees about physician-led care and prepare them to engage effectively with policymakers. This will empower residents to advocate for their profession and their patients.\nExpert Quote: “Physicians face increasing administrative burdens that take time away from patient care. Lifelong learning is essential to maintaining high standards of patient care and professional conduct, but the system needs to be more efficient. Every minute matters – and streamlining these trainings will give physicians time back to do what matters most – caring for patients.” – Melissa J. Grerette, MD, AMA Trustee The AMA’s policies represent a significant step forward in supporting physicians and ensuring the future of high-quality patient care. By streamlining compliance training, supporting medical students, combating burnout, and championing physician-led care, the AMA is paving the way for a healthier and more sustainable healthcare system. The future of medicine is looking brighter, thanks to these proactive initiatives.\nThe Future of Medicine: An Expert’s View on How the AMA is Supporting the Next Generation of Physicians The American Medical Association (AMA) is actively working to reshape the healthcare landscape, focusing on key issues like physician burnout, medical licensure exam support, and streamlined compliance training. but how will these initiatives truly impact doctors and patients? We sat down with Dr. Anya Sharma, a healthcare policy expert, to get her insights.\ntime.news Editor: Dr. Sharma, thank you for joining us. The AMA is making significant strides in several areas. Let’s start with compliance training.How will streamlining this process benefit physicians and patients?\ndr. Anya Sharma: Streamlining compliance is a game-changer. Currently, physicians often face redundant training requirements across different hospitals. The AMA’s push for reciprocity programs – where training completed at one facility counts at others – is crucial. This initiative directly addresses administrative burdens, freeing up valuable time that doctors can then dedicate to patient care, ultimately improving the overall patient experience.\nTime.news Editor: So,it’s a win-win scenario,increasing the time doctors can spend with patients?\nDr. Anya Sharma: Precisely. And there’s another layer to it. According to the AMA, there should be fair compensation or CME credits for the time healthcare providers spend on these trainings. Fair compensation indicates respect for their time and expertise.\nTime.news Editor: It sounds like the AMA is also focusing on supporting medical students, especially concerning the financial and logistical burdens of medical licensure. Can you elaborate on that?\nDr. Anya Sharma: The path to becoming a doctor is incredibly demanding, both academically and financially. Medical licensure exams are expensive, and failure can derail a student’s career. The AMA’s call for increased support from organizations like the National Board of Medical Examiners is vital. They are pushing for financial assistance, logistical support and mental health resources. A family tragedy or financial crisis could dramatically affect exam success,and resources to help in these situations are invaluable [[1]] .\nTime.news Editor: physician burnout is a serious concern in the medical field. What are your thoughts on the AMA’s approach to combating this?\nDr. Anya sharma: Absolutely. Physician burnout is a critical issue leading to decreased job satisfaction and, alarmingly, increased medical errors [[2]] , [[3]] . The AMA’s emphasis on flexible burnout prevention programs is key.Inflexible, mandatory programs can backfire.The AMA advocates for programs that prioritize autonomy, mindfulness, and personal well-being. This allows physicians to choose options that best fit their needs, such as mindfulness training or peer support groups.\nTime.news Editor: That makes sense – personalization and autonomy are crucial. the AMA is a strong advocate for physician-led care. Could you explain why this is so vital?\nDr. Anya Sharma: Physician-led care is central to ensuring patients receive the highest quality and safest care possible. Physicians possess the deep knowledge, skills, and experience needed to make informed decisions about patient well-being. The AMA is encouraging residency programs to provide opportunities for residents to engage in advocacy for physician-led care. Their focus on equipping the next generation of leaders ensures that trainees are prepared to advocate effectively for their profession and their patients.\nTime.news Editor: Dr. Sharma, thank you for your insightful commentary.Any final thoughts for our audience?\nDr. Anya Sharma: Keep an eye on the AMA’s initiatives. these policies directly impact the quality of healthcare we all receive. By supporting our physicians and medical students, we are investing in a healthier future for everyone. Hospitals can begin by auditing their compliance training programs, identifying areas of overlap and incorporating reciprocity, benefitting not only the physicians but also the overall efficiency of the healthcare industry.",

    "text": "Aux antipodes des prédictions des conservateurs, l’Espagne, gouvernée par une coalition progressiste, voit sa croissance largement surpasser la moyenne des pays de la zone euro. Monde Janvier 2020. Le socialiste Pedro Sánchez passe un accord de gouvernement avec Unidas Podemos (UP) – composé de partis situés à sa gauche – sur la base d’un programme résolument progressiste. Un gouvernement de coalition est formé, il vise à faire de l’Espagne une « référence pour la protection des droits sociaux en Europe », soit résorber les mesures néolibérales et antisociales qui flagellent la population depuis plus de dix ans. Abrogation des aspects les plus néfastes de la réforme du travail, réforme fiscale ambitieuse avec des hausses d’impôts pour les plus riches et les grandes entreprises, augmentation du salaire minimum, mesures en matière de logement, de transition écologique, de lutte contre les inégalités, etc. L’accent social – ainsi que féministe – est omniprésent et fait alors hurler les porte-voix de la bourgeoisie et du grand patronat. Du jamais vu en 15 ans Le moment est historique – il s’agit du premier gouvernement de coalition depuis 1936 – et toute la droite pousse des cris d’orfraie, dénonce l’alliance du PSOE avec la « gauche radicale », et accuse Sánchez de pousser le pays vers l’abîme avec une politique « irresponsable et dangereuse ». Le devenir de la stabilité économique, prétendument au cœur de leurs préoccupations, vise surtout à effrayer l’opinion publique. Pour les conservateurs, pas de doute : avec les hausses des dépenses publiques et les mesures de protection sociale, le programme de la coalition « embrasse le communisme bolivarien », décourage les investisseurs, augmente la dette publique, nuit à l’emploi et à la compétitivité espagnole. Sans parler de la discipline budgétaire. Quatre ans après , force est de constater que c’est tout le contraire qui s’est produit. La droite n’y croit pas, la gauche le fait Les résultats macroéconomiques du gouvernement de coalition – qui a vu Sumar remplacer UP en novembre 2023 – sont bons, voire très bons, malgré l’impact de la pandémie de Covid et la guerre en Ukraine. Les politiques de relance, qui forment un bouclier social protecteur vis-à-vis des familles, des travailleurs et des PME, ont porté leurs fruits et permis d’atteindre des chiffres records en matière d’emploi – jamais vus en quinze ans. À cela s’ajoutent la hausse du salaire minimum (passé en quatre ans de 900 à 1 134 euros), les réformes qui ont permis aux travailleurs de recouvrer des droits, l’augmentation des retraites ou encore la création d’un revenu de solidarité active. Les budgets « anti-austéritaires », la mise en place d’une taxe sur les transactions financières, sur les grandes fortunes ou encore sur les bénéfices exceptionnels des grands groupes financiers et de l’énergie, les plus de 200 autres lois approuvées depuis 2020 n’ont pas freiné l’économie. La situation budgétaire a été plus solide que prévu l’an dernier. Avec une croissance annuelle de 2,5 %, l’économie espagnole a largement dépassé la moyenne de la zone euro (cinq fois inférieure), allant même jusqu’à se hisser sur la première marche du podium devant les autres principales économies européennes. La droite espagnole ne voulait pas y croire, la coalition progressiste au pouvoir l’a pourtant fait. Avant de partir, une dernière chose… Contrairement à 90% des médias français aujourd’hui, l’Humanité ne dépend ni de grands groupes ni de milliardaires. Cela signifie que : - nous vous apportons des informations impartiales, sans compromis. Mais aussi que - nous n’avons pas les moyens financiers dont bénéficient les autres médias. L’information indépendante et de qualité a un coût. Payez-le. Je veux en savoir plus",

    "title": "WATCH: Texas SWAT Team Uses ‘The Rook’ to Take 18-Wheeler Driver Into Custody After Highway Chase",
    "text": "After the driver of an 18-wheeler refused to stop for law enforcement or comply with any of their commands, a Texas SWAT team had to use a heavy piece known as “The Rook” to extract him from the vehicle and into custody. Houston law enforcement was initially called to the scene on the I-10 East Freeway after a semi-truck was reportedly stopped in the middle of the highway on Dec. 27. When Harris County Sheriff’s Office deputies arrived and approached the truck, they said the driver took off and led them on a slow pursuit. The truck eventually stopped on the side of the highway after about three miles when spike strips were deployed, but the driver, later identified as 42-year-old Trinidad Cutshall, did not respond to deputies' commands to exit the vehicle. As reported by KTRK-TV , law enforcement tried verbal commands, tear gas, crisis negotiators, and less-lethal munitions, but Cutshall resisted all of their efforts. After Cutshall continued to not respond to the officer's commands, HCSO SWAT brought in a heavy piece of machinery known as “The Rook” to blast through the side of the semi-truck, crushing its windows and tearing off the passenger-side door. Once “The Rook” had done its job, deputies brought a K-9 to take Cutshall into custody. The driver’s face appeared to be bloody as he was being apprehended. Paramedics loaded him onto a gurney and took him to the hospital to be treated for lacerations to the face sustained during the ordeal, according to HCSO. Investigators said at a press briefing that they believe Cutshall had “some level of impairment” as he appeared unfazed when officers launched tear gas into the truck’s cabin. The standoff took several hours, leaving hundreds of drivers in gridlocked traffic as deputies blocked all lanes. Sheriff Eric Gonzalez said in a press briefing before the suspect was arrested, \"We don't know if he is armed or if he has a long rifle or serious firepower in there, so we have to consider all things at this point.\" Officials said that no cargo or weapons were found aboard the semi-truck, as reported by KHOU . HCSO said that Cutshall will be charged with felony evading, and his court date will be scheduled once he is released from the hospital.",

    "text": "El ministro de Salud, Guillermo Alfonso Jaramillo, salió al paso de las especulaciones sobre la salida del superintendente Nacional de Salud, [Luis Carlos Leal, ](https://www.bluradio.com/salud/saliente-superintendente-de-salud-luis-carlos-leal-es-el-nuevo-gerente-del-fomag-rg10) y aclaró que su desplazamiento de la Superintendencia hacia el cargo de director general del FOMAG es una decisión del presidente Gustavo Petro, sin relación con las investigaciones que había denunciado recientemente el saliente superintendente. Jaramillo, expresó durante sus declaraciones un firme respeto por la honestidad y profesionalismo de Leal. “Yo tengo un gran respeto por el doctor Leal, es una persona íntegra y transparente”, afirmó Jaramillo, descartando que su salida tenga algo que ver con las recientes denuncias de corrupción que habrían sido reportadas en su gestión hacia 4 EPS. Según el ministro, los movimientos en el Gobierno son parte de una estrategia más amplia de reestructuración y Leal continúa siendo un actor valioso para el desarrollo de la salud en Colombia. En cuanto a las inquietudes sobre la influencia de un informe en la salida de Leal, el ministro fue categórico: “No, de ninguna manera. El presidente de la República nos tiene a todos en alta estima”, asegurando que, tanto él como Leal, están comprometidos con los cambios que el gobierno desea implementar en el país. El ministro también se refirió a las intervenciones a las EPS, explicando que son necesarias para garantizar la estabilidad del sistema de salud, dada la crisis financiera de las entidades prestadoras. Según Jaramillo, estas intervenciones buscan poner a las EPS “en cuidados intensivos” para que, tras la reforma, salgan fortalecidas y puedan continuar contribuyendo al sistema de salud colombiano.

She was born on August 21, 1935, in Mauston, Wisconsin, to William Patrick and Mary Elizabeth (Warkins) Donovan of Lyndon Station, WI.\nMargaret attended St. Mary's School in Lyndon Station and graduated from Mauston High School. Following high school, she ventured out on her own, moving first to Madison, then to Chicago, and seeking even more adventure, enlisted in the United States Army.\nShe began a meaningful career as a laboratory technologist with the U.S. Army, serving in several locations including El Paso, Texas, and Baltimore, Maryland. It was during her service that she met her future husband, Vincent Marchetti. They were married on February 7, 1959, in the Army hospital chapel in El Paso.\nMargaret was always fond of her farming roots and loved raising fruits and vegetables in her city yard gardens for her family. She enjoyed cooking, sewing, and other crafts.\nMargaret's faith was central to her life. She was known for crafting thousands of rosaries for homeless veterans and generously helping them by providing clothing, food, and prayer books — a true testament to her compassion and devotion to those who served the country. She served as the chaplain in various roles for the state and local Vets organizations for many years.\nShe also had a strong passion for public service. She served for 22 years on the Juneau County Board of Supervisors (1992-2014) and was an active member of the American Legion Post 277 in Necedah. She was deeply dedicated to teaching others about the love of Jesus and the power of prayer.\nMargaret was very proud of her Irish heritage, and never missed a chance to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. Green was her favorite color.\nMargaret's legacy is one of unwavering dedication to her faith, her country, and her community. Her influence is immeasurable, and her spirit will continue to guide and inspire all who knew her.\nShe is survived by her son, Vincent (Lana) Marchetti Jr., of California; daughter, Judy (Terry) Weter of Arizona; three granddaughters; Morgan, Madison, and Ann; and siblings, Bill Donovan, Pat Donovan, Joan (Jim) McLaughlin, Colette (Bill) Hale, and Coleen Peterson. She is preceded in death by parents, husband (Vince), and brother-in-law (Pete Peterson).\nFuneral services will be held on Friday, July 18, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. at the Torkelson Funeral Home in Necedah. Burial with full military honors will follow at Queen of the Holy Rosary Mediatrix of Peace Cemetery in Necedah. Family and friends are invited for visitation from 10:00 a.m., to 11:00 a.m., on Friday at the funeral home.\nThe Torkelson Funeral Home in Necedah is assisting the family with arrangements. Online condolences may be offered at www.torkelsonfuneralhome.com\nIn lieu of flowers or any donations, the family requests you spend a few minutes on your own reflecting on the many blessings we all have each day.",
