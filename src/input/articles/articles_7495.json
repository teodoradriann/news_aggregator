También se le sindica como uno de los autores materiales del secuestro de Cristián Edwards del Río.\n“Ya ha sido dejado de ser considerado como un refugiado político a nivel administrativo, por lo que ahora corresponde activar con la justicia el caso”, explicó la ministra trasandina, quien se encuentra en Chile para participar en Enade.\n“Creemos que es justo que Argentina no solamente le haya sacado el refugio de manera administrativa, sino que la justicia hable y termine de cerrar un caso que, está claro, no es un caso de un refugio por persecución política sino por haber cometido asesinatos”, agregó.\n“Argentina no va a ser tierra que mantenga asesinos y estamos acelerando y pidiendo a la justicia que acelere los tiempos para resolver los casos”, afirmó Bullrich.\n“Nosotros queremos cumplir con la ley, por eso vamos a hablar con la justicia para resolver esto de manera inmediata. Así que esperemos poder cumplir con Chile en ese sentido”, aseguró.",

    "text": "The Full Hunter’s Moon It already begins to shine on October nights, illuminating the sky with its radiance. This, which is also the biggest supermoon of 2024 has not yet reached its peak luminosity and here we tell you when will be the best time to enjoy this astronomical phenomenon and some interesting facts about the origin of its name.\nFull Hunter’s Moon 2024 The October Full Hunter’s Moon is about to reach its maximum splendor being one of the biggest supermoons of the year . This astronomical phenomenon is not only a visual spectacle, but also has deep roots in history and traditions. In 2024, this will be the third of four supermoons that have been observed since August.\nThe Hunter’s Moon It will reach its maximum brightness on October 17 at 5:26 am in Guatemala, although the phenomenon can be enjoyed for three days, from Tuesday night to Friday morning. While Earth’s only natural satellite will be at its brightest before dawn on the 17th, the Old Farmer’s Almanac indicates that the satellite will be below the horizon, for that reason it will be easier to admire it at sunset, when it rises and rises in the sky.\nPhoto description for the visually impaired: The only natural satellite of the Earth observed from space. (Credit: NASA) The biggest supermoon of the year This month, Earth’s natural satellite is especially impressive, as it is a supermoon, a phenomenon that occurs when there is a full Moon and the orbit of this satellite is closest to Earth. This will be the biggest of the year, since compared to its perigee or average nearest point which is 363,300 kilometers, this month will be only 357,363 kilometers away.\nThis will make it appear larger and brighter than other typical full moons, surpassing previous supermoons in August and September by a small margin.\nWhy is it called that? The name of this moon comes from ancient agricultural and hunting traditions. According to NASA, the first documented use of this term dates back to 1710 in the Oxford English Dictionary . Although the satellite’s well-known names are linked to Native American traditions and European folklore, the Hunter and Harvest Moon, which occurred in September, is not linked to these traditions and its names are also not fixed for a certain month.\nTheir names are related to the autumn equinox. According to the Old Farmer’s Almanac If the October moon occurs closer to the autumn equinox, it is called the Harvest Moon. Otherwise, the September moon would take that name, as happened in 2024. The Harvest Moon is a moon that with its light provided help to farmers to carry out the harvest, while the Hunter’s Moon marks the beginning of the hunting season, when animals have gained weight before winter and the fields are clear after harvesting the crops, making the work of hunters easier, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.\nThis astronomical phenomenon has received other names, such as Travel Moon , Dying Grass Moon o Blood Moon .\nVisually Impaired Photo Description: A full moon is observed from the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.

    "title": "Taiwan Acquires 4000-Ton Heavy Patrol Vessel 'Taipei' To 'Defend Freedom & Democracy' From China",
    "text": "Taiwan has reportedly secured the delivery of a massive 4,000-ton patrol boat amid increased activity by the Chinese Coast Guard and People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) in and around the waters of the contested Taiwan Strait.\nSix Aircraft Carriers By 2035 – China’s Ambitious Plan For PLAN As It Looks To Counter US, Cut Indian Influence\nTaiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen oversaw the launch of the Coast Guard ship “Taipei” on March 9. Focus Taiwan reported that Taipei is one of the Chiayi-class offshore patrol vessels manufactured indigenously by Taiwan’s CSBC Corporation.\nTsai stated that Taiwan anticipated that its national shipbuilding program would highlight the nation’s commitment to defending freedom and democracy during a ceremony in Kaohsiung. Tsai also witnessed the delivery of “Yunlin,” the sister ship of Taipei, which was formally launched in December 2022.\nSome military experts have noted that the Chiayi-class patrol vessels, including the ones that were launched on March 9, were originally designed to have a displacement of 4,000 tons, but it was later changed to 5,000 tons during the constriction phase. EurAsian Times does not have an official verification of this information.\nThe Chiayi-class patrol vessel is a heavy patrol vessel of the Coast Guard Administration of Taiwan. The class’s helipad and hangar can accommodate a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter. The vessel also has an X-ray facility, a surgical suite, and a medical center with a negative pressure area.\nPresident Tsai Ing-wen oversaw the launch Saturday of the 4,000-tonne Coast Guard ship \"Taipei,\" one of the Chiayi-class offshore patrol vessels ordered from Taiwan's CSBC Corporation. https://t.co/qiJ7d99TbZ\n— Focus Taiwan (CNA English News) (@Focus_Taiwan) March 9, 2024\nFour ships of the Chiayi class were planned for the Taiwan Coast Guard. The first Chiayi was launched in June 2020, the second Hsinchu in April 2021, and the third Yunlin in December 2022. With the Taipei, all four vessels have now been delivered.\nPresident Tsai informed reporters that the government has allocated NT$42.6 billion (US$1.35 billion) for an initiative to strengthen Taiwan’s maritime patrol capabilities and the local shipbuilding industry. Under the program, which started in 2018, 141 Coast Guard ships are expected to be completed by 2027, according to the Ocean Affairs Council (OAC).\nThe Council claimed on February 9 that the Yunlin has a 10,000-navigational-mile range and can endure level-10 winds. According to the OAC, it has three water cannons for chasing away targets and field hospital-caliber medical stations.\nAdditionally, the ship’s helicopter pad could be used to transfer wounded soldiers. The Chiayi-class Coast Guard patrol vessels are known for their excellent range and maneuverability.\nSu Tzu-yun, a research fellow at Taiwan’s Institute for National Defense and Security Research, told CNA in an interview that the ships’ purpose was to guard civilian ships from pirates and escort fishing boats registered in Taiwan operating in disputed waters. If needed, Su added, they could even be used against Chinese coast guard vessels.\nMilitary experts also believe that the displacement of the vessels is similar to that of the largest patrol vessels in the USCG fleet, the Legend-class national security cutters of the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The vessel is equipped with water cannons, 20mm guns, remote weapons stations, and 2.75-inch rockets. It also has space for the placement of anti-ship missiles in case they become necessary during a battle.\nThe launch ceremony comes at a time of high cross-strait tensions with China since two Chinese fishermen died while being chased by the Taiwanese Coast Guard on February 14 off the coast of Kinmen, where the fishermen were allegedly trespassing. In response, China began regular patrols in the Kinmen Island waters, which are controlled by Taiwan but lie close to the Chinese coast.\nTaiwan Under Pressure According to official reports, China will increase its defense spending by 7.2% this year, supporting a military budget that has more than doubled during President Xi Jinping’s 11 years in office as Beijing toughens its stance on Taiwan.\nThis year’s hike is far higher than the government’s predicted rate of economic growth, and it is consistent with the pace reported in the previous year’s budget.\nFile Image As it unveiled the budget statistics, China also formally adopted harsher language toward Taiwan, eliminating any reference to “peaceful reunification” from a government report Premier Li Qiang presented at the opening of the National People’s Congress (NPC).\nJust two days after this, a Taiwan defense ministry report said China has escalated its use of “grey-zone” warfare against Taiwan, hoping to “saturate” the region around the democratic island with balloons, drones, and civilian boats.\nTaiwan’s administration, which denies Beijing’s claims to sovereignty, has been complaining recently that China has been employing what is known as “grey-zone warfare,” which is the use of erratic tactics to wear down an adversary without going to war.\nThe ministry claimed that to harass Taiwan, Beijing has started using “multi-front saturated grey-zone” methods, such as stepping up ship and aircraft patrols.\nReferring to an unofficial border between the two sides that China’s forces have started routinely crossing in recent years, the report claimed that China has attempted to “increase burdens of our naval and air forces and to obscure the existence of the median line in the strait.\nThe report also allegedly added that China has resorted to using research and militia vessels in a move to “disguise military activities with civilians”. EurAsian Times recently reported on how China deployed the Zhu Hai Yun to investigate the waters of the Taiwan Strait around the self-ruled island state that it has vowed to occupy and unite with the Chinese mainland.\nThe confrontation between the two countries’ Coast Guards appears to be a by-product of the larger tensions festering in the region. On its part, Taiwan has called on China to cease its effort to change the status quo in the Kinmen Islands.\nThe operation of all four Chiayi class patrol vessels would likely bolster its effort at warding off threats in the region.\nContact the author at sakshi.tiwari9555 (at) gmail.com Follow EurAsian Times on Google News",

Es el caso, por ejemplo, del brócoli: con antioxidantes y nutrientes, su aporte de vitamina C es casi el doble que el de las naranjas.De exquisito sabor, el brócoli es súper versátil en la cocina y permite combinaciones saludables tanto como guarnición en ensaladas o salteados, como a modo de salsa para fideos y otras pastas. Recuperá el sueño La técnica de respiración que te relaja en un minuto, te ayuda a dormir rápido y mejora el descanso Nuevas oportunidades El país de Sudamérica que tiene un bajo costo de vida y es ideal para emigrar después de los 60 años ¿Qué beneficios tiene el brócoli, el alimento con mayor vitamina C que las naranjas? El brócoli ofrece múltiples beneficios para la salud. Aporta aproximadamente 89 mg de vitamina C por cada 100 gramos, mientras que la naranja contiene alrededor de 53 mg. Recordemos que la vitamina C es esencial para fortalecer el sistema inmunológico y cuidar la salud de la piel. Además, es un alimento fuente de vitaminas A, E y K y otras del complejo B. En términos de minerales, el brócoli es rico en potasio, calcio, magnesio, zinc e hierro.El brócoli contiene más vitamina C que las naranjas, convirtiéndose en una excelente opción para fortalecer el sistema inmunológico. (Foto: Freepik)Un reciente estudio que incluyó a más de 730.000 participantes reveló que aquellos que consumían brócoli con frecuencia presentaban un 36% menos de riesgo de desarrollar cualquier tipo de cáncer en comparación con quienes no lo incorporaban en su dieta. El brócoli es rico en sulforafano, un compuesto conocido por sus propiedades quimiopreventivas que podrían ayudar a proteger contra el cáncer. Aunque los resultados son alentadores, los investigadores enfatizan la necesidad de realizar más estudios para validar estos hallazgos.Asimismo, el brócoli es uno de los 30 alimentos destacados por Paula Martín Clares en su libro La salud de tu piel está en lo que comes. Este vegetal se caracteriza por su gran densidad nutricional, ya que contiene pocas calorías, pero un alto contenido de proteínas y fibra. Salud Los beneficios de la bicicleta fija: el impacto positivo de este ejercicio en la respiración y la capacidad pulmonar Longevidad El hábito que conviene dejar después de los 50 años para aumentar la esperanza de vida ¿Cómo preparar fideos con brócoli? Preparar fideos con brócoli es muy sencillo, y lo mejor es que probablemente ya tenés la mayoría de los ingredientes en casa. Tomá nota y hacé la receta de Paulina Cocina. Ingredientes: 400 g de fideos u otra pasta1 brócoli mediano 1 diente de ajo Un trozo de manteca Un trozo de mozzarella o queso mantecoso 3 cucharadas de crema de leche 3 cucharadas de queso rallado Sal y pimienta al gustoCon pcoos ingredientes podés tener un plato de fideos con brócoli delicioso. (Foto: Freepik)Preparación: Comenzá por hervir agua, una vez que esté en ebullición, agregá los \"arbolitos\" de brócoli. Es crucial que el brócoli se ponga en el agua hirviendo para preservar sus nutrientes. Cociná durante aproximadamente 5 minutos, hasta que adquiera un tono fluorescente. Después, retiralo y colalo. Cortá el brócoli en trozos más pequeños. En una sartén, derretí un trozo de manteca y agregá el ajo picado, salteándolo. Añadí el brócoli cortado a la sartén y saltealo brevemente, solo lo suficiente para que tome el sabor del ajo sin deshacerse. Después, agregá las cucharadas de crema y retirá del fuego. Salpimentá al gusto y reservá. Cociná la pasta según las indicaciones del paquete. Una vez lista, escurrila y volcala en la sartén con la mezcla de brócoli y crema. Mezclá bien para que los fideos queden bien cubiertos con la salsa. Distribuí trozos de mozzarella sobre la pasta y espolvoreá con queso rallado. Llevá la fuente al horno a alta temperatura o usá el gratinador hasta que el queso esté dorado y crujiente.",

Las operaciones continúan según lo previsto”.\nUn portavoz de la base de Geilenkirchen dijo que el nivel de amenaza se había elevado a Charlie, el segundo más alto de los cuatro estados de alerta, que se define como “un incidente (que) ha ocurrido o se ha recibido información de inteligencia que indica que es altamente probable algún tipo de acción terrorista contra organizaciones o personal de la OTAN”.\nFue la segunda vez que la base que alberga la flota de aviones de vigilancia AWACS de la OTAN eleva el nivel de seguridad, tras un incidente ocurrido la semana pasada cuando una base militar de la cercana Colonia fue acordonada temporalmente mientras las autoridades investigaban un posible sabotaje del suministro de agua.\nEse mismo día, la base de Geilenkirchen también informó de un intento de allanamiento que motivó un barrido completo de las instalaciones.\nPara leer la nota completa ingrese AQUÍ",

    "text": "Más de 15 pasos deben durante el fin de semana previo a la Semana Santa, entre el [Viernes de Dolores](https://www.estadiodeportivo.com/estar-al-dia/sociedad/semana-santa-sevilla-2024-viernes-dolores-itinerario-recorrido-horario-hermandades-cofradias-hoy-20240321-446506.html) y el Sábado de Pasión, por las calles de Sevilla. El viernes saldrán en procesión cinco hermandades y dos agrupaciones parroquiales. Los pasos que salen estos dos días pueden hacerlo con relativa tranquilidad, en lo que a la previsión meteorológica se refiere, pero a partir del Domingo de Ramos la cosa cambia. Venimos avisando desde hace unas semanas que [ la nota dominante del tiempo para esta Semana Santa iba a ser la inestabilidad](https://www.estadiodeportivo.com/estar-al-dia/sociedad/semana-santa-sera-tranquila-que-tiempo-refiere-20240315-445856.html), así lo apuntaban varios expertos. Luego llegó la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología [(AEMET) y mandó un mensaje de calma y tranquilidad, ](https://www.estadiodeportivo.com/estar-al-dia/sociedad/aemet-mayor-las-alegrias-para-semana-santa-sevilla-20240318-446200.html)con buenas noticias en cuanto a las lluvias, pero poco ha durado ese mensaje de calma. Ahora las previsiones desde la AEMET no son nada halagüeñas. Pese a lo oscuro que está el cielo este [Viernes de Dolores](https://www.estadiodeportivo.com/estar-al-dia/sociedad/semana-santa-sevilla-2024-viernes-dolores-itinerario-recorrido-horario-hermandades-cofradias-hoy-20240321-446506.html), parece que no habrá que preocuparse en lo que a lluvia se refiere. Lo que sí que ven los sevillanos es el polvo en suspensión que trae la calima, el cual se hace patente en los coches aparcados en la calle. Esta situación es la misma que se espera para el sábado, llegando los cambios el domingo debido a una DANA. La probabilidad de lluvia para el Domingo de Ramos, a partir de las 12 del mediodía, es ya del 60%. Esto hará que las hermandades y cofradías que salen por la tarde tendrán que estar mirando al cielo y muy pendientes de las predicciones, no teniendo asegurado poder realizar su estación de penitencia. Pero si hay un día que pinta muy negro es el Lunes Santo, con un 100% de probabilidades de agua la primera parte del día y un 95% la segunda. Algo menos importante, pero que también anticipa AEMET será la baja de las temperaturas a partir del martes, con mínimas por debajo de los 10 grados, mientras que este viernes, sábado y domingo se pueden superar los 30 grados centígrados. Como pasa en Sevilla, la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología ha pronosticado inestabilidad para buena parte del país. La DANA que llega en nuestro país dejará lluvias este fin de semana incluso en las Canarias, así como en el extremo norte peninsular. \"La semana del 25 al 31 de marzo se prevé un cambio de tiempo, con la Península y Baleares bajo la influencia de bajas presiones atlánticas y sus frentes, dejando precipitaciones generalizadas\", dice el comunicado emitido por la AEMET.",
