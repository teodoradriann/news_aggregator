    "title": "On Holy Thursday, Pope Francis asks priests to weep over their sins",
    "text": "Vatican City, Mar 28, 2024 / 09:30 am (CNA). On Holy Thursday, Pope Francis presided over a chrism Mass at which more than 1,880 priests, bishops, and cardinals renewed the promises made at their ordinations. Pope Francis encouraged the priests to turn their gaze upon the crucified Lord and to weep over their sins in repentance, saying that tears can “purify and heal the heart.” “Once we recognize our sin, our hearts can be opened to the working of the Holy Spirit, the source of living water that wells up within us and brings tears to our eyes,” Francis said on March 28. “The Lord seeks, especially in those consecrated to him, men and women who weep for the sins of the Church and the world and become intercessors on behalf of all,” he added. Forty-two cardinals, 42 bishops, and 1,800 priests living in Rome concelebrated the Mass with the pope in St. Peter’s Basilica. Holy Thursday marks the institution of the Eucharist and institution of the sacrament of the priesthood at the Last Supper. Pope Francis will also preside over a Mass of the Lord’s Supper on Thursday evening at a women’s prison in Rome. The 87-year-old pope arrived in St. Peter’s Basilica on Thursday morning in a wheelchair. Before giving his more than 20-minute homily, the pope took a sip of water and put on his reading glasses. Pope Francis reflected in his homily on Peter’s tears after denying the Lord three times as recorded in the Gospel of Luke: “Peter remembered the word of the Lord … and went out and wept bitterly.” “Dear brother priests, the healing of the heart of Peter, the healing of the apostle, the healing of the pastor, came about when, grief-stricken and repentant, he allowed himself to be forgiven by Jesus. That healing took place amid tears, bitter weeping, and the sorrow that leads to renewed love,” he said. Compunction Pope Francis said that he wanted to speak to the priests about the importance of compunction — an awareness of guilt due to sin — which the pope admitted is a “somewhat old-fashioned” term and “an aspect of the spiritual life that has been somewhat neglected, yet remains essential.” The pope added that compunction “is not a sense of guilt that makes us discouraged or obsessed with our unworthiness, but a beneficial ‘piercing’ that purifies and heals the heart.” “Compunction demands effort but bestows peace. It is not a source of anxiety but of healing for the soul, since it acts as a balm upon the wounds of sin, preparing us to receive the caress of the heavenly physician, who transforms the ‘broken, contrite heart,’” Pope Francis said. The pope said that through compunction “the natural tendency to be indulgent with ourselves and inflexible with others is overturned and, by God’s grace, we become strict with ourselves and merciful toward others.” “Weeping for ourselves … means seriously repenting for saddening God by our sins … It means looking within and repenting of our ingratitude and inconstancy, and acknowledging with sorrow our duplicity, dishonesty, and hypocrisy — clerical hypocrisy, dear brothers, that hypocrisy which we slip into so much — beware of clerical hypocrisy,” Francis said. “How greatly we need to be set free from harshness and recrimination, selfishness and ambition, rigidity and frustration, in order to entrust ourselves completely to God and to find in him the calm that shields us from the storms raging all around us,” he added. “Let us pray, intercede, and shed tears for others; in this way, we will allow the Lord to work his miracles. And let us not fear, for he will surely surprise us.” During the Vatican’s chrism Mass, the pope, as the bishop of Rome, blessed the [oil of the sick](https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=35245), the [oil of catechumens](https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=35243), and the [chrism oil](https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=33948), which will be used in the diocese during the coming year. Cardinal Angelo De Donatis served as the celebrant at the altar. The oils were processed up the main altar of St. Peter’s in large silver urns as the hymns of the Sistine Chapel Choir filled the basilica. Pope Francis prayed over the oil of the sick: “O God, Father of all consolation, who through your Son have willed to heal the infirmities of the sick, listen favorably to this prayer of faith: Send down from heaven, we pray, your Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, upon the rich substance of this oil, which you were pleased to bring forth from vigorous green trees to restore our bodies, so that by your holy blessing this oil may be for anyone who is anointed with it a safeguard for body, mind, and spirit, to take away every pain, every infirmity, and every sickness.” The blessed oil will be used for the anointing of the sick in Rome throughout the year. Pope Francis thanked the priests gathered in St. Peter’s Basilica for all they do to bring “the miracle of God’s mercy” to the world today. “Dear priests, thank you for your open and docile hearts; thank you for your labors and thank you for your tears; thank you because you bring the miracle of mercy … you bring God to the brothers and sisters of our time,” he said. “Dear priests, may the Lord console you, confirm you, and reward you.” Watch the full Mass here: ",

    "text": "Escritorio MENÚ Temas Noticias Política Economia Cultura Internacional Deportes Reportajes Opinion Línea Editorial Radio Señal en vivo FM Programación Vuelve a escuchar Medio Ambiente Algas marinas, alimento ancestral para dietas saludables y sostenibles y un planeta sano Columna de opinión por Lorena Rodríguez Osiac, Gabriela Lankin Vega y Paulina Larrondo Valderrama\nJueves 18 de julio 2024 18:27 hrs.\nCompartir en\nGracias a nuestro mar frío, a lo largo de las costas de Chile tenemos gran abundancia y diversidad de algas de distintos grupos: rojas como el pelillo, verdes como la lechuga de mar y pardas como el cochayuyo, los huiros y el sargazo. Desde el punto de vista nutricional, ambiental y social son muy importantes ya que, aparte de ser un alimento para los humanos y un insumo para la industria, son hábitat y alimento de cientos de especies marinas, lo que las convierte en el sostén de economías e identidades locales desde los pueblos originarios en varias regiones del país.\nLas algas son un alimento ancestral en países costeros como Japón, Indonesia, Filipinas y Chile; el cochayuyo, por ejemplo, forma parte de la dieta tradicional de comunidades costeras del país y desde la época precolombina se usaban como trueque. De hecho, en Monte Verde, Puerto Montt, se encuentra el registro del uso de algas más antiguo de Latinoamérica, con una data de 14.000 años.\nSegún FAO, cada año en el mundo se recogen unos 25 millones de toneladas de algas marinas, las que, además de usarse para consumo fresco, crudas, cocidas, horneadas, asadas, en polvo y en escabeche y en la industria gastronómica en forma de snacks, galletas o harinas, se han utilizado como complementos y suplementos nutricionales y como aditivos naturales. También, por su alto contenido en alginato, se usan en la industria de la cosmética y por su gran cantidad de minerales, en la industria de los fertilizantes.\nDesde el punto de vista nutricional, las algas son ricas en vitaminas del complejo B, proteínas, fibra, omega 3, antioxidantes y minerales como yodo, hierro, calcio y magnesio; al mismo tiempo son bajas en calorías y grasas saturadas, lo que las convierte en un alimento muy saludable.\nNumerosos estudios muestran que la ingesta de algas se asocia inversamente con el riesgo de cardiopatía isquémica, debido a su efecto reductor de los lípidos (triglicéridos y colesterol LDL) y a su efecto reductor de la presión arterial y de la circunferencia de cintura (obesidad), desempeñando un papel importante en la modulación de diversas enfermedades crónicas asociadas a estos factores de riesgo. También se les atribuyen propiedades antivirales y anticoagulantes, así como la capacidad de modular la salud intestinal (microbiota). Existe abundante bibliografía que destaca las propiedades anticancerígenas de los compuestos bioactivos marinos, tanto en modelos in vitro como in vivo, y se hace muy interesante la probable asociación inversa entre consumo de algas y algunos tipos de cáncer, aunque se necesitan estudios epidemiológicos para confirmar esta hipótesis.\nUn desafío pendiente para el crecimiento del negocio de las algas como producto comestible es garantizar su inocuidad, ya que por ser Chile un país minero, las algas que crecen adheridas a sustratos como las rocas, suelen estar contaminadas con algunas cantidades diversas de metales pesados, lo que hace necesario su lavado profuso para conseguir su remoción.\nEl promedio mundial de consumo anual de productos del mar es de 20 kilos por persona y el chileno es de 16,8 kilos por persona. Por ello se celebró el convenio “Del Mar a tu Escuela», entre Junaeb y Subpesca, que llevará pescados, mariscos y algas, a escolares, y se espera que derive en efectos favorables para la pesca artesanal y la economía local. Sin embargo, son escasas las iniciativas que fomentan una mayor apreciación de las algas, la incorporación de prácticas ancestrales y el uso de las algas en la dieta chilena.\nDesde el punto de vista ambiental, las algas son a los ecosistemas acuáticos, lo que los árboles a los terrestres: ambos son cruciales para la vida en el planeta, al cumplir roles fundamentales en los ecosistemas marinos. En Chile existen grandes extensiones de bosques formados por algas pardas que, gracias a su rápido crecimiento, alcanzan alturas de 15 metros en 1 a 3 años (los bosques terrestres tardan 20 a 30 años) constituyendo formaciones que pueden vivir muchos años.\nAsí como los bosques de árboles son cruciales para la vida terrestre, estos “bosques de algas” son cruciales para las comunidades acuáticas, entregando, a través de la fotosíntesis, la energía necesaria para sustentar cientos de especies de invertebrados y peces que las utilizan como alimento y refugio: cangrejos, erizos, caracoles y lapas se alimentan de ellas, atrayendo, a su vez, depredadores como el loco, estrellas de mar y peces. Estos últimos atraen peces más grandes y mamíferos como lobos marinos, chungungos, o a distintos tipos de aves marinas, las que utilizan estas praderas como áreas de alimentación.\nAdemás, su estructura tridimensional ofrece refugio a peces e invertebrados acuáticos como la centolla y el ostión, que los usan como zonas de reclutamiento, desove, asentamiento larval y sitios de crianza, ya que los discos basales con que las algas se adhieren al fondo marino los protegen contra depredadores y corrientes de fondo marino. Cuando las hojas viejas se degradan, pasan a formar parte de la alimentación de invertebrados filtradores como choritos y otros bivalvos.\nEstos ecosistemas son también fundamentales para resolver la crisis climática actual, ya que son las plantas con mayor crecimiento en el planeta, siendo capaces de secuestrar y absorber grandes cantidades de carbono inorgánico y, por lo tanto, amortiguan la acidificación oceánica. Aunque aún no se ha estudiado completamente, se piensa que su potencial de captura de carbono puede generar un impacto gigantesco en términos de mitigación y adaptación al cambio climático.\nLamentablemente, los bosques de algas del mundo se han visto extremadamente afectados por efectos del cambio climático, que ha elevado la temperatura de los océanos, y, en el caso de Chile, por la explotación indiscriminada para su consumo y para la extracción de alginato. La extracción, que antes consistía sólo en la recolección de algas que llegan a la orilla de forma natural, actualmente se hace también con prácticas ilegales como el “barreteo”, donde se arranca con una herramienta llamada barreta incluso el disco basal con que las algas se adhieren a la roca.\nEsto equivale a sacar un árbol de raíz, impidiéndole regenerarse posteriormente y dejando verdaderos desiertos en el fondo marino, impactando a toda la comunidad de especies que viven asociadas a las algas. Esto incluye numerosas especies con roles fundamentales en los ecosistemas, destruyendo el equilibrio de las tramas tróficas y la biodiversidad y otras muchas que se capturan para el consumo humano, afectando las economías locales.\nEn los últimos años el interés económico por las algas ha ido en aumento, llegando a quintuplicar su precio y actualmente, más que por su rol ambiental, económico o social, se las aborda como un “recurso bentónico”, representando casi el 80% del volumen y el 21% del valor total de las exportaciones pesqueras, con mayor importancia comercial que los erizos, locos u otras especies emblemáticas. La extracción de algas ha reemplazado, a través del barreteo, que atenta contra la sostenibilidad de estos bosques, a la pesquería de especies sobreexplotadas o definitivamente colapsadas.\nDesde el punto de vista social y económico, actualmente existen cerca de 74.063 recolectores de orilla, de los cuales 22.450 son mujeres, las que componen el 85% de la pesca artesanal del país, junto a armadores, pescadores y buzos. Nos encontramos en un cambio de paradigma, donde es urgente fortalecer estrategias económicas locales y sustentables en dirección a la protección y promoción de la autonomía económica, especialmente de las mujeres.\nEn este sentido, las algas marinas pueden ayudar a impulsar los medios de vida y cerrar la brecha de género desde la base de su cadena productiva: las recolectores de orilla. Por esto, una Nueva Ley de Pesca debiese velar por las principales demandas del sector: el reconocimiento de las algas como ecosistemas únicos, junto con incorporar a expertos en desarrollo bioeconómico y comité técnico-científico para recursos algales.\nLamentablemente, existe una brecha histórica entre ciencia y comunidad, y el conocimiento no llega cabalmente a toda la población. Entre la institucionalidad, tomadores de decisión, los territorios y academia podemos fortalecer la vinculación con el medio, la transferencia tecnológica, la producción local y el turismo sustentable según los principios de la salud y economía azul.\nLas algas marinas pueden ayudar a impulsar la economía, abordar el cambio climático y contribuir a la salud de las personas. Para esto se requiere con urgencia agregar valor a este quehacer y a sus productos.\nPor Lorena Rodríguez Osiac, Escuela de Salud Pública y Grupo Transdisciplinario para la Obesidad de Poblaciones (GTOP), de la Universidad de Chile; Gabriela Lankin Vega, Facultad de Ciencias Agronómicas y GTOP, de la Universidad de Chile y Paulina Larrondo Valderrama, Departamento de Educación en Ciencias de la Salud, Facultad de Medicina y proyecto “Hierbas de Mar” , Universidad de Chile\nEl contenido vertido en esta columna de opinión es de exclusiva responsabilidad de su autor y no refleja necesariamente la posición de Diario y Radio Universidad de Chile.\nNoticias relacionadas Aguas servidas en Puerto Guadal: los episodios de malos olores y contaminación que ensucian la Perla del Lago La Algarabía y el folclor en resistencia: \"La cueca va a seguir siendo la voz del pueblo\" Resistencia socioambiental para la defensa de la naturaleza, los océanos y los derechos humanos ¿Las desaladoras son una solución?: los riesgos para el borde costero de Chile Destacados En portada",

    "text": "El delantero uruguayo Adrián \"Rocky\" Balboa se hizo la revisión médica, firmó contrato por cuatro años y se convirtió de manera oficial en nuevo jugador de Racing . Balboa, que llega a Avellaneda luego de su paso por Unión de Santa Fe, será la alternativa de Adrián \"Maravilla\" Martínez, quien el año pasado fue el goleador académico al haber anotado 30 goles y entregó nueve asistencias en 48 partidos.\nRacing será el decimoquinto club en la carrera de Balboa, quien llega a la Academia a cambio de 800 mil dólares por el 70 por ciento del pase. El centroatacante oriental, de pasos anteriores por Patronato de Paraná, Belgrano de Córdoba y Unión, tendrá una actividad muy intensa, ya que competirá entre el 21 y el 28 de febrero próximos por la Recopa Sudamericana ante Botafogo de Brasil, los torneos Apertura y Clausura de la Liga Profesional de Fútbol, la Copa Argentina y la Copa Libertadores.\nBalboa es el tercer jugador uruguayo del plantel, junto a Gastón Martirena y Martín Barrios, y también la tercera incorporación de este libro de pases tras las llegadas de Matías Zaracho (Atlético Mineiro) e Ignacio Rodríguez (Banfield). El técnico Gustavo Costas ahora pretende un lateral izquierdo para que pelee el puesto con Gabriel Rojas, un volante mixto y un delantero.",
