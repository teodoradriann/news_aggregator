    "text": "FOOTBALL-SHAPED CHINOOK of the clipped adipose fin variety are being found by anglers from Neah Bay to Port Angeles harbor.\nSekiu and Port Angeles opened to hatchery chinook fishing Monday and its been a solid start to the summer for many.\nSteve Hazard, manager of Angler’s Hideaway in Sekiu (\nhttps://www.anglershideaway.com), enjoyed a quick bite while fishing with his good buddy Morris Bond in the Turquoise Avenger on Wednesday morning.\nHazard and Bond, 83, who has fished Sekiu for his entire life, were on-and-off the water in a matter of hours.\n“We launched at 5:15 a.m. and those were in the freezer by 9:30 a.m.,” Hazard said.\nHazard found his big king while the tide was changing while fishing near the Coal Mine stretch of shore on the way to Pillar Point.\n“I was rigged up on the downrigger fishing in about 80-feet of water around 50-feet on the downrigger,” Hazard said. “We were rigged up with a cotton candy flasher and a cop car colored 3-inch spoon. I caught that one about 7 a.m. about an hour after the sun came up, the tide was set to change at 7:30 a.m., so it was on the move.”\nHazard said its been an early bite out west.\n“The early morning bite has been working better, most folks are done for the day by 10:30 a.m. And its the normal thing, if you find the bait you find the fish. There has been a lot of good fish found nearer to shore but there are still a lot of boats fishing out in 300 or 400-feet of water in about 120-to-180-feet on the downrigger.”\nFish checks on opening day in Port Angeles showed success.\nA total of 52 hatchery kings were landed by 79 anglers in 37 interviews conducted at the ramp at Ediz Hook for a 67-percent catch rate. The boat haven ramp had even better numbers with 63 hatchery chinook checked in by 79 anglers in 31 interviews (80-percent catch rate).\nOcean salmon\nFishing estimates for the first weekend and the first full week of the ocean salmon season (June 24-30) were released.\nThe first weekend of ocean salmon fishing saw an impressive 462 chinook taken off the board by the 1,510 anglers estimated to have fished off Neah Bay (Marine Area 4).\nLast week, 1,093 kings and 564 coho were landed by 2,919 anglers off Neah Bay.\nReports said most kings were being found nearer to shore on the outside, with no need to make the long, bouncy trip out to Swiftsure or Blue Dot.\nIn total, 17-percent of the chinook guideline of 9,430 hatchery kings was snapped up before the extended Fourth of July weekend even started.\nAnglers are doing a solid job of staying away from the smaller coho, with 776 cumulative coho taken so far out of a 8,300-coho quota for Neah Bay.\nIt should be said that every silver landed now means a shorter season when the coho are larger and more plentiful in August and September.\nLa Push saw 46 anglers catch 26 chinook last weekend (2-percent of the area guideline) and nine coho (less than 1-percent of area quota).\nShrimp dates July 12-15\nAll shrimp species are available for harvesting July 12-15 in Marine Area 6 (Port Angeles Harbor, eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca outside of the Discovery Bay Shrimp District).\nShrimping runs from one hour before official sunrise to one hour after official sunset.\nThe daily limit is 80 spot shrimp with a total daily weight limit of 10-pounds (whole shrimp) all species combined. If retaining non-spot shrimp, all shrimp heads (spot and non-spot) must be retained in the field until anglers are ashore and finished fishing for the day.\nHalibut dates added\nAdditional recreational halibut fishing dates for August and September are now pending final approval by the National Marine Fisheries Service.\n“Spring halibut catches and effort were lower than anticipated, which means we have sufficient remaining quota to offer more harvest opportunity,” said Lorna Wargo, intergovernmental ocean policy coordinator for Fish and Wildlife. “The proposed schedule for August and September reflects angler input and expands late season opportunity compared to previous years.”\nThe 2024 fishing season is based on statewide recreational quota of 299,781 pounds with 116,227 pounds remaining.\nAdditional 2024 coast and Puget Sound halibut dates, subject to available quota:\n• Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound (Marine Areas 5, 6, 7, 8-1, 8-2, 9, and 10): Daily through Sunday and then from Aug. 16 through Sept. 30.\n• Neah Bay and La Push (Marine Areas 4 and 3): Open through Sunday then open daily from Aug. 16 through Sept. 30.\n___",

    "text": "Did you know Sushmita Sen spent her pocket money to buy THIS Khan's poster? says, ‘I was in love with this man’\nIn a new interview, Sushmita Sen revealed how she used to buy a superstar's posters with her pocket money and later got a chance to work with him.\nSushmita Sen, who began her career by winning the Miss Universe Pageant, is widely known for her grace and acting talent.

She shared that during those years when Khan made his debut as a lead in Maine Pyar Kiya, she used to buy his posters for her room.\n\"Whatever pocket money I got, I would buy Salman Khan posters from that, and in those days, Maine Pyar Kiya had released, so I even had a picture of the kabootar from that film because it was from a Salman Khan film,\" she recalled.\nSomehow, they became her source of motivation, realizing the significance of the posters for her use to ask her to complete her homework. They mentioned that they would remove those posters otherwise. Consequently, the Aarya actress completed the task. \"Those posters were sacrosanct to me. I was completely in love with this man,\" she fondly reminisced.\nYears later, Sen got a chance to work with the Tiger 3 actor, and he saw a picture of her from when she was 15 years old and his poster behind her.

    "text": "Reuters Israeli tanks, missiles strike Gaza in offensive against Hamas Read full article Nidal al-Mughrabi and Bassam Masoud December 29, 2023 at 12:50 a.m. · 4 min read Israeli tanks, missiles strike Gaza in offensive against Hamas\nBy Nidal al-Mughrabi and Bassam Masoud\nCAIRO/GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli forces attacked areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip where residents have been expecting a renewed ground offensive in areas crammed with tens of thousands of Palestinians already displaced by the Israeli-Hamas war.\nWith nightfall on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the southern city of Khan Younis killed eight Palestinians, health officials said. Three Palestinians were killed and six injured in an Israeli missile strike on a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent said.\n\"The task here is to dismantle Hamas - so that it no longer has military and governing capabilities,\" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said at a press briefing on operations in Khan Younis. \"We will be required to show a lot of perseverance and determination.\"\nA Palestinian journalist posted pictures of Israeli tanks near a mosque in a built-up area of Bureij in central Gaza.\nThe Islamist group Hamas released video it said showed its fighters targeting Israeli tanks and soldiers east of Bureij. Reuters was not able to verify the location or the date the video was filmed.\n\"That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,\" said Omar, 60, who said he had been forced to move with at least 35 family members. He declined to give his surname for fear of reprisals.\nYamen Hamad has been living in a school in Deir al-Balah, also in central Gaza, since fleeing from the north. He said people newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nIn one of Israel's latest airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. Their bombed building was housing displaced civilians, according to local medics and residents.\nSEARCHING THROUGH RUBBLE\nStory continues Reuters video showed rescuers scrabbling frantically through rubble to uncover and pull out victims including a baby and several children and rushing them through milling crowds of dazed and weeping people to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital.\nPalestinian health authorities said earlier that 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 - nearly 1% of Gaza's population. Thousands more dead were feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nOver the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nHamas and its fighters are dug deep into the Gaza Strip's dense cities and towns and their leaders are still at large.\nIsrael has reported 169 of its soldiers killed in its Gaza campaign after Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.\nSome 110 hostages were freed during a Nov. 24-Dec. 1 humanitarian pause and more than 20 others have been declared dead.\nU.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Hamas killed an American hostage, Judith Weinstein, 70, on Oct. 7. Last week he said her husband Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on the same day.\nThe Israeli military released findings of an investigation into the killings in error by its troops of three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Dec. 15. Soldiers mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding.\nEGYPT'S PLAN TO END CONFLICT\nEgypt confirmed on Thursday that it had put forward a framework proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip that includes three stages ending with a ceasefire and said it was awaiting responses on the plan.\nThe proposal is an attempt \"to bring viewpoints between all concerned parties closer, in an effort to stop Palestinian bloodshed and the aggression against the Gaza Strip and restore peace and stability to the region,\" Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt's State Information Service, said in a statement.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will keep some form of security control of all Gaza indefinitely, though he insists that this would not amount to reoccupying the enclave.\n(Reporting by Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo, Bassam Masoud in Gaza and Emily Rose in Jerusalem; writing by Grant McCool; editing by Howard Goller)\nTRENDING 1.

    "title": "Notre Dame men’s swimming suspended: 7 questions about gambling scandal",
    "text": "Thursday afternoon saw a bombshell report from Sports Illustrated’s Pat Forde send shockwaves across the world of collegiate swimming.\nNotre Dame is suspending men’s swimming for a “minimum” of one year after internal and external investigations into the team discovered a culture “dismissive of Notre Dame’s standards for student-athletes”. This reportedly included swimmers gambling on the performance of their teammates.\nPer Forde :\nHead coach Chris Lindauer and his staff were not disciplined, after reviews found that “the staff was not aware of gambling or the scope and extent of other troubling behaviors because team members effectively concealed such behaviors from the coaches and staff through concerted efforts.”\nThe Notre Dame men’s team effectively created its own sports book for the purpose of wagering on their swimming performances, sources say. A majority of the returning 2024–25 team is believed to have placed bets. “Over/under” lines were established for a swimmer’s times in certain races, with wagers being placed on the outcomes.\n…\nSome Fighting Irish swimmers also placed wagers on other sports and involving other schools, sources said, such as the NCAA basketball tournaments.\nThe NCAA rules are pretty straightforward when it comes to gambling: “If you put something at risk (such as cash, entry fee, dinner or other tangible item) on any amateur and/or professional sporting event with a chance to win something in return, you violate NCAA sports wagering rules.”\nStill, there’s a lot we don’t know here, and to take a step as drastic as a self-imposed suspension of the program requires plenty of evidence we hope to see soon. In the meantime, we’re left with seven questions that immediately stand out.\n1. Why did Notre Dame feel the need to take such harsh action before the NCAA could weigh in? Notre Dame men’s swimming just sent Chris Guiliano to the Paris Olympics, where he won gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay for the Americans while Lindauer was an assistant coach for Team USA. The Fighting Irish also completed it’s best finish (10th) at the NCAA championships in school history.\nIf the statement from ND athletic director Pete Bevacqua confirms the investigation cleared Lindauer and a “small number of team members who did not participate in the conduct”, why did the school move ahead to effectively shutter the men’s program before the NCAA had a chance to rule on the case?\nWhat other punishments were available to Notre Dame why was this the correct route? How would any punishment from the NCAA have differed from Notre Dame’s decision?\n2. How did the gambling ring actually operate? If we’re talking about swimmers setting over/unders on their teammates’ times, this could be anything from one swimmer betting another that they’ll break a personal record, or something more nefarious like taking bets on who finishes in which position.\nWhich begs some follow up questions: How much money was actually being wagered between teammates? Who was acting as the bookie? How were odds set? How were winnings and losses collected?\nWagers of $200 or less incur nothing more than a slap on the wrist from the NCAA (via additional rules and prevention education), whereas anything over $200 begins to incur loss of eligibility. Anything over $800 is subject to potential permanent loss of eligibility .\n3. Does the NCAA need to adjust its gambling rules (again)? The spirit of the NCAA rules are understood in regards to bookies and sportsbooks, but should wagers among teammates be included if there is no impact or influence on the outcome of the event?\nPut another way: If the swimmers were betting each other on whether or not a teammate would finish under a certain time, should the NCAA treat them the same as a football player betting on his props with a bookie or sportsbook? What if the swimmer being wagered on was unaware of the bets? What if the swimmer in question knew he was being wagered on by his teammates, but didn’t know where the line on his over/under was set?\nWhat exactly is the NCAA attempting to punish with the way its rules are currently set up?\n4. What other sports were waged on? This is crucial. Because while no regulated sportsbook sets lines on collegiate swimming, there are plenty of other sports regulated books will take wagers on. The report from Forde specifically notes the NCAA basketball tournaments. Were those wagers placed among teammates or were they made using the mobile betting apps we’ve all become familiar with?\n5. Was inside information provided to individuals involved in sports betting? You can consider this an extension of the last question, but the consequences are far more severe. If members of the public were betting on those other sports with the knowledge of inside information, this becomes a much larger deal. Think more along the lines of the Alabama baseball scandal .\n6. What conditions must the team meet before the men’s team is reinstated? The fact that this wasn’t laid out — especially considering the coaching staff was exonerated — is concerning and leads to our most cynical question…\n7. Is this just a convenient way to kill a non-revenue sport? Yeah, this is pretty harsh and there’s no evidence that’s what’s going on here. But in the absence of more information it’s hard not to view Notre Dame’s decision in the larger context of college athletics.\nRevenue-sharing among colleges and student-athletes is here . Coaches — particularly those in Olympic sports — have already started ringing alarm bells about the future of their programs now that schools won’t get to keep every cent brought in by their top sports.\nWithout knowing more about the full scope of the swimming team’s activities, conspiracies will linger about what was actually happening and why Notre Dame took such drastic steps.\nWe need more information sooner than later to fully judge how the Fighting Irish have handled this.\nGannett may earn revenue from sports betting operators for audience referrals to betting services.
