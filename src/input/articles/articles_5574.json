    "text": "The recent feature film “Napoleon” has people taking a fresh look at The Little Corporal and his namesake nephew. Napoleon Bonaparte left the world a boatload of legacies. He radically revolutionized military organization and thinking in the early 19th century. His Napoleonic Civil Code profoundly affected government institutions in France and much of Europe for decades after his death. He popularized (but did not create) the famous hand-in-waistcoat portrait pose. And his family eventually gave the world several items that may be in your kitchen right now. Napoleon is remembered for supposedly saying, “An army marches on its stomach.” Talk to anyone who has worn the uniform, and they’ll tell you what was true in Napoleon’s time still holds true today. A commander who keeps his troops properly fed gets the most out of them. In the Napoleonic Era, army regulations called for soldiers to receive a daily ration that included 24 ounces of bread; a half-pound of meat; either an ounce of rice or two ounces of dried beans, peas or lentils (depending on availability); a quart of wine; a gill of brandy (about a quarter pint); and a half gill of vinegar. The French forerunners of GI grunts had gourmand tastebuds. (However, those rations were received only when supplies were to be had and could be delivered to an army on the move. More often than not, French soldiers subsisted on salted meat and stale bread.) Satisfying his soldiers’ tastebuds would go a long way in keeping order in the ranks as French forces kept busy overrunning much of Europe. Napoleon wasn’t the kind of guy who let problems stand in his way. When he wanted something, he either obliterated obstacles or found a way around them. And so it was with supplying his men with special treats. He offered a prize of 12,000 francs to whoever could devise a better way to store and preserve food to feed his soldiers. Nicolas Appert, known today as the Father of Food Science, rose to the challenge. Until the late 1700s, people had difficulty keeping food for an extended period. Sure, they had known for centuries that salting or drying helped it last longer. But it wasn’t fun getting through a long winter on dried meat, fruits and vegetables. Appert gave the world the first modern food preservation techniques. He was a pioneer in using airtight canning to preserve comestibles. (Though he started using empty champagne bottles instead of the tin cans we know today.) He won Napoleon’s prize, and fame soon followed. But the Bonapartes weren’t finished making contributions to culinary culture. Half a century later, the original Napoleon’s nephew was sitting on the throne of a revived French Empire. And he was growing tired of hearing his soldiers complain about their chow. Napoleon III realized something extra was needed, something that was essential to the French palate. An old joke reminds us that the three secrets to French cooking are “Butter, butter, and more butter.” But there was a problem, and it was a biggie. Butter must be kept refrigerated. Because it easily melts. And when that happens, it makes a big mess. Hardly an ideal situation for field kitchens. On top of that, France was experiencing a butter shortage, forcing the poor to go without their beloved butter. So, like his famous namesake, Napoleon III issued a challenge in 1869: Come up with a new butter substitute. And just as had happened before, another inventor stepped forward. Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès was a French chemist. He mixed processed beef tallow with skimmed milk. He tinkered with it a little more and found it made a good spread on bread and could be stored at higher temperatures than traditional butter. And it was much cheaper to produce than the real thing. He called his discovery oleomargarine. You and I know it by its shortened name, margarine. Two centuries later, you’ll find ample canned food and margarine stocks at your local grocery store. Health food advocates and cooking purists may lift their noses at both in contempt, but food prices make each look more appealing to many consumers these days. Canned foods and margarine help many Americans make it through tough times. And we have two French emperors from long ago to thank for it.",

    "text": "The chief of the World Health Organization, that group of international bureaucrats who not only apparently protected China when the COVID-19 pandemic came out of a research lab there but demanded masks and shots for the world, now is insisting on a plant-based food supply chain to save the globe.\nWHO's Tedros: \"Our food systems are harming the health of people and planet. Food systems contribute to over 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, and account for almost one third of the global burden of disease. Transforming food systems is therefore essential\"\n[pic.twitter.com/hE8UeXEy0H]\n— The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial)\n[December 26, 2023]\nIn an online video, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, \"Our food systems are harming the health of people and planet. Food systems contribute to over 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, and account for almost one-third of the global burden of disease. Transforming food systems is therefore essential by shifting for this healthier, diversified and more plant-based diets.\"\nGet\nHe continued, \"If food systems deliver healthy diets for all we could save 8 million lives per year. WHO is committed to supporting countries to develop and implement policies to improve diets and fight climate change. I'm therefore very pleased that over 130 countries have signed the code 28 UAE Declaration on climate and health. Together, we can protect and promote the health of both people and planet.\"\nHe cited no documentation for his claims.\nA\nreport at the Post Millennial explained with the statement, he was declaring \"war on meat and traditional farming.\"\n\"A new declaration from the World Health Organization has revealed that it wants the masses to eat less meat and more plant-based foods in order to supposedly combat 'climate change,'\" the report continued.\nIt explained the comments align with a page posted by the United Nations regarding the COP28, a recent global warming conference attended by bureaucrats from around the globe who often arrived in private jets.\nThat U.N. page \"pushes for the uniting of 'global leaders behind commitments and plans to achieve the Paris Agreement,' which it falsely refers to as a 'legally binding UN treaty to tackle climate change and limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C,'\" the report said.\nActually, the report explained, the Paris Accord asks for \"non-binding commitments.\"\nFurther, the U.N. site insists on a \"transition away from fossil fuels\" and calls for nations \"to implement integrated, multisectoral solutions to deliver sustainable, climate-resilient food systems as a climate change adaptation measure.\"\nA report at Rolling Out bluntly charged the WHO chief \"wants to take away your meat.\"\nAnd there was reaction, the report said.\n\"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declares war on meat and traditional agriculture, in the name of 'fighting climate change,'\" Wide Awake Media posted, the report said.\n\"Anyone remember electing this clown to dictate what kind of agriculture and diets are permissible? Nope, me neither.\"\n\"And Dennis McCleney, a self-proclaimed \"hard-rocking, hard-riding conservative Christian,\" explained, \"The assumption that the Earth’s atmosphere is a closed system and that CO2 is a hazard is absolutely absurd. Without CO2, there would be no life on Earth. It also comprises just 0.04% of the atmosphere. Quit giving credence to these liars and elitists.\"\nIMPORTANT NOTE TO WND READERS: America – long the freest, most prosperous, powerful, altruistic and Christian nation on earth – is on the brink of destruction. Every decent and aware American adult knows this. The evidence is everywhere.\nDemocrat politicians today overwhelmingly favor late-term abortion up to the very moment of birth – formerly known as \"infanticide.\" They encourage children too young to drive or vote to have their breasts and/or sex organs amputated in pursuit of a \"gender transition\" that is both delusional and impossible, and which leads to staggering rates of depression and suicide. They have not just allowed, but ENGINEERED, a full-scale foreign invasion of America across her southern border.\nTheir standard bearer, President Joe Biden – a senile, pathologically dishonest and epically corrupt career political hack – is destroying America's economy, energy sector, military, law enforcement, election integrity, national security, Constitution and overall national wellbeing as rapidly as possible. At the same time, Team Biden demonizes and, increasingly, IMPRISONS critics as \"violent extremists,\" \"domestic terrorists,\" \"white supremacists\" and \"insurrectionists.\" Indeed, they're currently engaged in an obviously corrupt multi-front legal war against Biden's chief political rival, Donald J. Trump, in an attempt to send the 45th president of the United States to prison for the rest of his life.\nNone of this constitutes \"politics\" in any conventional or traditional American sense. Rather, it is all darkly spiritual. The greatest nation on earth is in the throes of a full-blown spiritual war between good and evil.\nThe big question, then, is WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SAVE AMERICA? Fortunately, real answers and uncommon wisdom are showcased in the December issue of WND's critically acclaimed monthly Whistleblower magazine, \"CAN AMERICA BE SAVED? The world's freest, most Christian nation is on the brink of destruction.\"\nIn this very special issue, readers will experience the best and deepest thoughts and strategies on how to restore America to her former goodness and greatness, from some of the nation's most respected analysts – everyone from Tucker Carlson to Dennis Prager to Victor Davis Hanson to Newt Gingrich and many more.\nWHISTLEBLOWER is available in\nboth the popular print edition and a state-of-the-art digital version, either single issues or discounted annual subscriptions.\nFor 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

    "text": "Local\nRed Cross helps families forced out of south Charlotte apartment from fire\nAmerican Red Cross volunteers were on site helping families at a south Charlotte apartment complex Thursday morning as fire investigators walked through the charred remains of units that were burned in a two-alarm fire. Five people were hospitalized.\nThe fire was reported at 5:30 a.m. and burned through the second and third floors of an apartment unit at Aurea Station Apartments, said Charlotte Fire Battalion Chief J.P. Soto.\nAt least four apartments in the 8500 block of Winter Oaks Lane were damaged, he said.\nEight or nine fire trucks responded and extinguished the fire in under 90 minutes, Soto said.\nThe cause of the fire is being investigated. Soto said investigators were also looking through the units to make sure there was nothing that could reignite the fire.\nFamilies displaced by apartment fire\nNeighbors watched as fire investigators walked through the apartments later Thursday morning. Some neighbors stood eating on top of the hood of a car, while others huddled with American Red Cross volunteers who arrived to help.\nJason Gudzunas, the executive director, said he and volunteers arrived on scene about two hours after the fire broke out.\n“We want to make sure their immediate needs are met,” Gudzunas said. “We want to make sure they’re safe and comfortable.”\nPeople impacted will receive mental health support and spiritual care, as well as referrals for long term care. He said the Red Cross was still evaluating if the families impacted would receive financial assistance or be set up in a shelter.\nThe total number of people affected wasn’t yet available.\nGudzunas’s wife, Christina, is also a Red Cross volunteer and was on site to support the families.\nOne of the first things she does when arrives to help people is give them comfort and someone they can talk to. She also finds out what they immediately need and helps them get those things, like blankets and hairbrushes.\n“All those things that they’re going to go to first thing in the morning,” she said. “They’re going to brush their teeth and not have a toothbrush. We have all that set up.”\nGudzunas said the Red Cross website has information on fire safety and training, as well as opportunities to have smoke alarms installed homes.\nThis is a developing breaking news story.

    "text": "Secciones\nServicios\nDestacamos\nLas fuertes lluvias que ha traído esta última Dana, han provocado distintos daños en la Serranía de Ronda, que incluso mantuvo activo el aviso rojo por intensas precipitaciones este pasado lunes. Aunque fue en el Alto Valle del Genal donde se produjeron más destrozos, con cortes de carreteras y el rescate de una joven que quedó atrapada en su vehículo por la crecida del río Genal y un desprendimiento de piedras y rocas; en el Bajo Valle del Genal, este episodio también se dejó sentir.\nEn Jubrique, los vecinos están sin agua potable debido al problema de turbidez que se ha generado. Se produjo una avería el lunes y el corte del servicio y tras solucionarse ésta, se detectó la turbidez. El alcalde de este pueblo, Alberto Benítez, explicó que se repartió agua entre los vecinos, con un camión de Cruz Roja y gracias a la gestión de Emergencias 112. «Ya la situación ha mejorado mucho», añadió el regidor, en relación a la situación durante este miércoles, por lo que confió en que este problema se pueda solucionar próximamente. Así, el Consistorio está realizando las pertinentes analíticas para comprobar que el agua pueda ser de nuevo apta para el consumo.\nHay que recordar que en la comarca de Ronda, Gaucín, con motivo de la pasada Dana, la del mes de noviembre, también se enfrentó a esta situación, al igual que otros municipios, pero en éste, se llegó del mismo modo, a repartir agua embotellada durante varios días, gracias también a la ayuda de Cruz Roja y de los voluntarios de Protección Civil, hasta que los resultados de las analíticas permitieron volver a consumir el agua. Especialmente se hizo llegar agua a las personas mayores de este municipio del Genal.\nTambién Benaoján, aunque no duró tanto, en noviembre, tuvo problemas con la turbidez. La alcaldesa de El Burgo, María Dolores Narváez, en la misma línea, señaló posibles problemas con la turbidez por la Dana de esta semana. La misma dejó más de 130 litros en prácticamente una hora en el pueblo.\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nTe puede interesar\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nEsta funcionalidad es exclusiva para suscriptores.\nReporta un error en esta noticia",

    "text": "The Miami Hurricanes had a pretty subpar season, finishing 7-5 on the year which earned them a matchup against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights in the Pinstripe Bowl. And their year ended on a sour note, falling in the game which earned them the program as a whole and head coach Mario Cristobal a ton of criticism on social media. Rutgers dominated the line of scrimmage in this game, recording 208 rushing yards in the game to come away with a 31-24 victory. This now marks two straight seasons for Miami under Cristobal where the team has not performed up to expectations. And it sure seems like the college football world is tired of seeing this from a once-great program like Miami. Former Ohio State quarterback Cardale Jones made his feelings known on social media Thursday when it came to one ACC program. “Man, I feel bad for the recruits going to Miami U for NIL……. Bad staff, no stability within program and one of the worst college home game atmospheres. Chasing the money isn’t always the answer. But good luck.” Jim Leavitt, a former defensive coordinator under Cristobal during his time at Oregon, also criticized Cristobal and his team after this most recent loss. “Unreal. Miami 4-2. Lots of time. Own 40. Up the gut. Gets stuffed. GT game. Take a knee. Decisions by a HC are so big. Miami ends up 7-6.” A number of fans also chimed in, echoing Jones and Leavitt in their criticism of Miami. In two years with Cristobal at the helm, Miami has recorded just a 12-12 record, a 12-13 record if you add in this most recent bowl game loss to Rutgers. Miami was obviously once a dominant program in college football that got some of the top players in the country. They still happen to bring in some of the top players in recruiting. But the results on the field certainly leave a lot to be desired.

    "text": "„Verantwortungslos“: Müller-Kundin tobt – Drogeriemarkt entfernt Produkt aus Sortiment\nDer Drogeriemarkt Müller hat das größte Spielwarensortiment unter den führenden Drogerien. Für ein Modellfiguren-Set hagelt es aber scharfe Kritik.\nHamm – Nach dm und Rossmann gehört Müller, mit Hauptsitz in Ulm, zu den führenden Drogeriemärkten in Deutschland. Von Drogerieprodukten über Schreib- und Spielwaren bis hin zu Haushalt und Multi-Media, bietet die Drogeriekette Kunden eine bunte Angebotsvielfalt. Mit 190.000 Artikeln besitzt Müller das größte Sortiment der drei Wettbewerber, berichtet die Tagesschau. Auch im stationären Spielwarenhandel ist die Drogeriekette die Nummer Eins. Doch jetzt sorgt ein Modellfiguren-Set der Marke „Noch“ für Diskussion. Der Grund: die verkauften Miniaturfiguren stellen „voyeuristischen Szenen“ dar.\n„Hier wird Voyeurismus verharmlost“ – Kundin empört über Modellfiguren-Set bei Müller\nDas Set mit dem Titel „Voyeure“ zeigt unter anderem Frauen mit nacktem Oberkörper oder im Bikini, ein Kind, das sich die Augen zuhält sowie einen Mann auf einem Klappstuhl mit Fernglas – offenbar ein „Spanner“. Angeboten wurde das Set im Online-Shop von „Noch“ als auch bei Amazon und zwischenzeitlich in Filialen der Drogeriekette Müller.\nIn der Produktbeschreibung des Herstellers wird das Miniaturfiguren-Set als „ideal, um humorvolle oder ungewöhnliche Szenen auf Ihrer Modellbahnanlage darzustellen“ beworben. „Die Damen in verschiedenen stehenden Posen kleiden sich an und cremen sich ein. Ein Mann beobachtet die attraktiven Damen durch sein Fernglas.“\nEine Kundin (Christine B.), die das Set in einer Spielwarenabteilung einer Müller-Filiale entdeckt hat, übt gegenüber der Bild scharfe Kritik: „Hier wird Voyeurismus verharmlost und Kindern als harmlose Unterhaltung vermittelt“. Dies sei „nicht nur geschmacklos, sondern auch höchst verantwortungslos.“ Auf einer jährlich stattfindenden Fitness-Messe sorgte eine perfide Spanner-Masche ebenfalls für Diskussion.\nMüllers Figuren-Set in der Kritik: Hersteller bietet es weiterhin an\nNach Kundenbeschwerden reagierte Müller und stoppte den Verkauf. Ein Unternehmenssprecher erklärte gegenüber der Boulevardzeitung, dass man beim Handelskonzern „größten Wert auf ein verantwortungsvolles und familienfreundliches Sortiment“ lege. Im Zuge einer Systemumstellung seien Produkte ins Sortiment aufgenommen worden, die nicht den internen Ethikstandards entsprächen. Die betroffenen Artikel seien umgehend entfernt worden.\nIm Onlineshop des Modellbauer Noch ist das Figuren-Set weiterhin erhältlich. Dass das beworbene Set aktuell unter scharfer Kritik steht, scheint den Hersteller nicht zu stören. Im Gegenteil. Auf seiner Webseite ist das „Voyeure“-Set der Aufmacher. Mit einem großen, gelben Smiley wird sogar auf den Bild-Artikel verwiesen.\nNeben dem umstrittenen „Voyeure“-Set werden auch weitere Sets wie „FKK-Badende“ und „Sexy Ladies“ angeboten, die leicht bekleidete Frauen in unterschiedlichen Posen und Kostümen zeigen.\nVoyeurismus in Deutschland – Heimliches Beobachten nicht strafbar\nHeimliches Beobachten ist per se keine Straftat und nur in bestimmten Fällen strafbar. In Deutschland wird Voyeurismus laut dem Rechtsportal Juraforum.de durch verschiedene Gesetze und Vorschriften reguliert. Zu den wichtigsten zählen § 201a StGB „Verletzung des höchstpersönlichen Lebensbereichs durch Bildaufnahmen“ und § 183 StGB „Exhibitionistische Handlungen“.\nDie Strafnorm des § 201a StGB schützt dabei das Recht „auf informationelle Selbstbestimmung und damit die Intimsphäre des Betroffenen“. Für eine Strafbarkeit müssen laut dem Rechtsportal mehrere Voraussetzungen erfüllt sein:\n- Die Person muss sich in einer Wohnung oder einem gegen Einblick besonders geschützten Raum befinden.\n- Der Täter nimmt heimlich und ohne das Einverständnis des Betroffenen Bildaufnahmen der Person vor.\n- Die Bildaufnahmen verletzen den höchstpersönlichen Lebensbereich der betroffenen Person, beispielsweise weil sie nackt, in Unterwäsche oder in einer sexuellen Handlung dargestellt ist.\n- Die Bildaufnahmen müssen eine erhebliche Verletzung der Intimsphäre darstellen.\nSexuelle Belästigung ist ein weit verbreitetes Problem, für das immer noch das Bewusstsein fehlt und das oft noch im Verborgenen bleibt. In einem Podcast spricht Außenministerin Baerbok über ihre eigene Erfahrung und die Bedeutung der öffentlichen Diskussion über das Thema. Eine Studie enthüllte das erschreckende Ausmaß sexueller Belästigung auf dem Oktoberfest. (vw)",

    "text": "<p>Cimiseni, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 24th Dec, 2023) Long torn between loyalty to the Russian or Romanian Orthodox Church, the Moldovan village of Cimiseni has made its choice, triggered by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p> The parish in the village near the capital Chisinau, whose 2,850 inhabitants mostly speak Romanian, is one of a growing number that have switched allegiance from Moscow to Bucharest.</p><p> The divorce mirrors the former Soviet Republic's bigger struggle as it seeks to leave behind Russia's influence and join the European Union.</p><p> \"This fight between Orthodox brothers has outraged people,\" priest Ioan Solonaru told AFP, referring to the war in Ukraine.</p><p> Parishioners \"started to tell me that they no longer wanted to come to Kirill's church to receive communion\", said Solonaru, referring to Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the leader of Russia's Orthodox Church and a staunch supporter of the invasion.</p><p> The reception of Ukrainian refugees pouring over the border has also raised awareness in Moldova.</p><p> Since the invasion, more than 50 parishes have switched allegiance from Moscow to Bucharest, according to Moldova's Romania-linked Metropolis of Bessarabia.</p><p> \"Nothing unites us with Moscow any more,\" said the 55-year-old Solonaru, incredulous at \"the nostalgia of some people for the USSR\".</p><p> In a recent letter, Metropolitan Vladimir, head of the Russia-linked Metropolitanate of Moldova, expressed concern about the departure of priests.</p><p> He wrote to patriarch Kirill of the \"marginalisation\" of his church \"because of its membership in the Moscow Patriarchate, perceived in Moldovan society as an outpost of the Kremlin\".</p><p> The Moldovan people aspire to get closer to Romania, he suggested, asking for a solution to \"end the crisis\".</p><p> A meeting of the highest dignitaries -- held following the letter -- decided to maintain their allegiance to Moscow.</p><p> Around 1,350 parishes in Moldova are Moscow-linked, far more than some 200 with allegiance to Romania.</p><p> \"We do not feel in danger,\" Ioan of Soroca, vicar of the Metropolitanate of Moldova, told AFP.</p><p> The Metropolitanate of Moldova has condemned the war in Ukraine -- though not Kirill -- with Bishop Ioan describing those who left as \"lost sons (who) must come to their senses\".</p><p> Metropolitan Vladimir said this week that their actions were \"reckless\".</p><p> Russia's invasion of its neighbour in February 2022 has accelerated the pro-European drive in the country of 2.6 million people, situated between Ukraine and EU member Romania.</p><p> The Metropolis of Bessarabia is receiving newcomers \"with open arms\", according to spokesman Constantin Olariu, just as Moldova is preparing to open accession negotiations with the EU.</p><p> \"It's a pro-European signal,\" he said, adding that his church had to resume its activities \"from scratch\" in 1992 following Moldova's independence.</p><p> President Maia Sandu sent a similar message, calling in a recent radio interview on \"all of society, including the Church\" to unite for \"peace\" on the path to European integration.</p><p> The war has also sowed division among Orthodox Christians in neighbouring Ukraine.</p><p> In October, Ukrainian lawmakers advanced legislation to ban the Moscow-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church -- which says it has severed ties with Russia since May 2022.</p><p> Ukraine also passed legislation to move its official Christmas holiday to December 25, in a break with the Russian Orthodox Church that celebrates it on January 7.</p><p> Ukraine had been under Moscow's spiritual leadership since the 17th century at the latest, but part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church broke with Moscow in 2019 over Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in the east of Ukraine.</p>",
