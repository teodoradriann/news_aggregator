Anda y checa la casa”, dijo, “Tú vienes conmigo, acá no va a quedar gente. Todo esto va a ser fuego”, le respondieron.\nAgregó que una de las principales problemáticas que encontró fue el lenguaje, ya que ella no comprendía lo que decían estas personas; sin embargo, una palabra el común los unió, mejor dicho, un apellido: Messi.\n“¿¡Qué es Argentina!?”, le preguntaron, a lo que ella encontró como punto de referencia el futbol y específicamente que de ahí es Messi.\n“Yo soy de donde es Messi” , dijo la mujer de 90 años. ¡¿Messi!? A mí me gusta Messi, respondió el hombre, quien inmediatamente soltó el arma y la dejó libre.\n💥🇦🇷Ester Cunio, 90, was saved on Oct 7 when she told the Hamas terrorist who invaded her Nir Oz home that she came from Lionel Messi country.

    "text": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is deploying extensive emergency resources to assist Central Texas communities impacted by recent severe flooding.\n“As a native Texan, this disaster is deeply personal, and I want the people of Central Texas to know the USDA will be by their side through the totality of this response and long-term recovery,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins said.\nMultiple disaster assistance programs have been established to support farmers and ranchers. These include crop insurance, livestock indemnity, emergency assistance programs, tree replacement aid, and conservation restoration initiatives. Details and eligibility are available on farmers.gov .\nUSDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is supporting livestock operations, with guidance available on protecting animals during disasters.\nResponse efforts involve multiple other federal agencies:\nThe U.S. Forest Service (USFS) is coordinating with state and local partners to support debris removal, hazard mitigation, and search and rescue operations. Trained crews and incident management teams from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi have been deployed for debris clearance and hazard reduction, with law enforcement officers assisting in ongoing rescue efforts.\nThe Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is monitoring watershed structures, deploying connectivity devices to offices, and coordinating flood control inspections. The agency continues to engage with the Texas Division of Emergency Management and local officials, providing updates on available assistance programs such as the Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP).\nNutrition assistance has been expanded to affected households. As of July 8, USDA authorized the use of SNAP benefits for hot food purchases in seven counties through August 7. The agency also waived the 10-day reporting requirement for SNAP households in 21 counties to report food loss, effective through August 4, 2025.\nFood safety guidance includes recommendations for residents to reduce foodborne illness risks following flood exposure, such as using only bottled water, discarding flood-exposed foods and porous items, and thoroughly sanitizing utensils and surfaces.\n*Featured photo is for reference only.",

    "title": "Buffalo chicken pizza: All the spice with none of the mess",
    "text": "Meredith Deeds | (TNS) Star Tribune\nI’m a big fan of Buffalo chicken wings. The heat and the sourness from the hot sauce, contrasted with the cool, creamy, slightly funky blue cheese dressing, takes chicken to a new level. I love everything about them — except the wings.\nEating chicken wings is messy business; I end up with Buffalo sauce up to my elbows. So if I can capture the same elements that make Buffalo chicken wings so good, and use them to top another beloved dish, pizza, that’s a win-win.\nWelcome to this week’s recipe, Buffalo Chicken Pizza.\nOK, I know many of you are thinking “if my pizza isn’t topped with red sauce, mozz and pepperoni, it isn’t pizza.” For those of you who feel strongly about what is and isn’t pizza, you can quietly call this delightful version flatbread.\nBut no matter what you call it, the flavor combination works well on top of a crisp pizza crust.\nSpeaking of crust, most people have no idea how quick and easy it is to make your own. You can do it by hand, or in a food processor, which whips up a respectable dough in a flash. It only needs a short time to rise before rolling it out, adding toppings and popping it into the oven.\nYes, if time is of the essence, you can buy pizza crust at the grocery store. If possible, look for the dough that comes in a bag in the deli section. Crust from a tube is less palatable.\nWhen it comes to the toppings, red sauce doesn’t make an appearance. Instead, cream cheese is mixed with Parmesan cheese and hot sauce (Frank’s is my choice for anything Buffalo wingish) and slathered over the uncooked crust. Shredded mozzarella is showered over the cream cheese and topped with shredded cooked chicken that’s been bathed in more hot sauce.\nThe pizza is baked to bubbly, browned perfection and drizzled with blue cheese dressing. Either thinly sliced celery or green onions can be used as a garnish.\nYou may still need a napkin after eating this pizza, but you won’t need a shower.\nBuffalo Chicken Pizza Makes 2 (12-inch) pizzas.\nAlthough making your own pizza crust is ultra-easy, if preferred, you can substitute with 2 (12-ounce) packages of store-bought pizza dough. From Meredith Deeds.\nFor the crust:\n3 1/2 c. (420 g) unbleached flour 1 (2 1/4 tsp.) pkg. dry yeast 2 tsp. salt 1 tsp. sugar 1 1/4 c. (283 g) lukewarm water 1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil Cornmeal for dusting For the topping:\n8 oz. cream cheese, room temperature 3/4 c. grated Parmesan cheese 1/4 c. plus 2 tbsp. Frank’s Red Hot Original Sauce 1/2 tsp. garlic powder 2 c. shredded mozzarella 2 c. shredded cooked chicken 1/3 c. blue cheese dressing Sliced green onions or celery, for garnish Directions\nTo make the crust: In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, salt and sugar. Create a well in the center of the dry mixture.\nPour the water and olive oil into the well. Stir the mixture together until the dough comes together. Knead the dough with your hands until mixed and smooth. Dough may be sticky and you may need to sprinkle a little more flour on it, but don’t add too much. The dough should be very soft.\nForm dough into a ball, place in an oiled bowl and cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap. Let rise for an hour at room temperature or refrigerate overnight, and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before shaping. (Alternately, combine all the crust ingredients in the bowl of a food processor and pulse several times until the dough comes together in a ball. No need to knead with your hands. Let rise in the closed food processor bowl for 1 hour.)\nThirty minutes before making the pizza, preheat the oven to 450 degrees and place a pizza stone, tiles or a large baking sheet turned upside down on the lowest rack.\nTo make the topping: In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoons hot sauce and garlic powder.\nIn another bowl, combine the chicken with the remaining 1/4 cup hot sauce.\nTo make the pizza: Divide the dough into 2 pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time, on a floured work surface, roll out to a 10- by 14-inch oblong or, if preferred, a 12-inch circle. Place on a pizza peel or a large rimless baking sheet.\nTop with half of the cream cheese mixture, half of the mozzarella and half of the chicken mixture. Carefully slide the pizza off the peel or baking sheet onto the hot pizza stone, tiles or baking sheet. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until the crust is browned and cheese is melted. Remove from the oven and cut into 8 pieces. Repeat with remaining dough and toppings.\nDrizzle the top of each pizza with half of the blue cheese dressing and garnish with sliced green onions or celery.\n____\nMeredith Deeds is a cookbook author and food writer from Edina.
