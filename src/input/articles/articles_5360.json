    "text": "SEOUL - South Korea&#039;s professional baseball league cancelled a scheduled game on Friday due to high temperatures, the first time in the league&#039;s 42-year history that it invoked a provision that allows for a game cancellation due to extreme heat. The game between LG Twins and Lotte Giants was scheduled to start at 6:30 p.m. (0930 GMT) local time in the southeastern city of Ulsan, where the daily high temperatures exceeded 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) for a second straight day on Friday. A Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) official said Friday&#039;s heat warning cancellation was the first since the league was launched in 1982. Ground temperatures in the Ulsan stadium were higher than 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) at times during the day, he said. South Korea is under heat warnings for all of the country, a week after the end of the annual monsoon season when heavy rains pounded mostly the central regions causing flooding and landslides. South Korea is in a temperate zone in the northern hemisphere with four distinct seasons, but the climate is seen to be getting warmer, according to experts and officials who cited annual average temperatures. Several regions of the country have been under daily heat warnings since July 21, issued by the meteorological agency when daily high temperatures exceed 33 degrees Celsius (91 degrees Fahrenheit).

    "text": "Guillaume Marion, Media365 : publié le jeudi 01 février 2024 à 23h55\nAvant le match du Real Madrid à Getafe ce jeudi soir, Vinicius Jr a été la cible de plusieurs insultes racistes. Des « Vinicius Mono » (« Vinicius singe ») ont notamment été entendus...\nVinicius Junior sur le racisme : « Je peux changer l'avenir » - Foot - Entretien par L'Équipe\nDécidément, ça ne s'arrange pas au niveau du racisme dans le foot. En effet, une dizaine de jours après l'affaire qui a touché Mike Maignan, lors d'une rencontre de l'AC Milan face à l'Udinese en Serie A, c'est cette fois en Espagne qu'une nouvelle sombre histoire a vu le jour ce jeudi 1er février. En marge de la rencontre entre Getafe et le Real Madrid, comptant pour la 20eme journée de Liga, des supporters des Azulones en dehors du stade ont scandé des insultes racistes à l'encontre de Vinicius Jr. Ainsi, selon plusieurs médias espagnols, dont As et la Cope, l'ailier brésilien des Merengue aurait été traité de singe. Sur des vidéos présentes sur X (anciennement Twitter), on peut notamment entendre des « Vinicius Mono » (« Vinicius singe ») , alors que les joueurs de Carlo Ancelotti ont aussi été sifflés aux abords du stade\nA Getafe, Vinicius Jr a répondu sur le terrain Après l'affaire qui avait touché Maignan, Vinicius Jr avait notamment passé un coup de gueule nécessaire et disait : « Il est temps d'emprisonner les racistes ». Cette fois, insulté, le Brésilien a répondu à sa manière. Car, ce jeudi soir, au Coliseum Alfonso Pérez, l'ancien joueur de Flamengo s'est illustré lors de la victoire du Real Madrid à Getafe (2-0). Après un premier but de Joselu dès le premier quart d'heure de jeu (14eme), sur une passe de Lucas Vazquez, l'attaquant des Merengue a inscrit un doublé en deuxième période, peu avant l'heure (56eme). Pour faire le break dans cette rencontre, ce dernier a pu profiter d'une passe décisive de Vinicius Jr, qui a donc participé activement au succès des siens. Pour rappel, ce serait au moins la 8eme fois que le Brésilien est victime d'insultes racistes en Espagne , selon As. Les autorités compétentes vont vraiment devoir se poser les bonnes questions pour éradiquer ce fléau présent dans les tribunes.",

    "text": "By harnessing the unique auditory capabilities of these insects, scientists hope to revolutionize the capabilities of disaster relief efforts. Mosquito antennae are complex structures that transduce sound into electrical signals, which are then zapped to the brain.\nDifferent mosquito species have antennae structured to pick up different sounds, such as frog calls or the sound of female wingbeats.\nIn the future, the antennae of what we think of as pests could inspire both soundproofing and sound-detecting materials.\nMosquitoes. We swat them, spray them, and otherwise try to get rid of them by any means necessary. But it turns out that these insects—which have been little more than insufferable pest to humanity for most of our existence—might actually be useful for something.\nHypersensitive mosquito antennae are able to pick up specific signals, even through the buzz of their noisy wingbeats, and a team of researchers hoped that finding out how they do it could inspire soundproofing materials and super-sensors. The interdisciplinary team, led by Pablo Zavattieri and Ximena Bernal of Purdue University, zoomed in on the antennae of two mosquito species using microscopy and CT scanning. What they saw were complex structures built to optimize sound detection.\nAedes aegypti and Uranotaenia lowii are mosquito species which use the acute hearing capabilities of their antennae for different purposes. Ae. aegypti males seek out potential mates by listening for female wingbeats, and U. lowii females (which need a blood meal to lay eggs) hunt for frogs to prey…\nElizabeth Rayne",
