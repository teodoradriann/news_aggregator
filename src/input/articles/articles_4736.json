    "title": "The cold drop disaster in Valencia seen from space by the Landsat 8 satellite",
    "text": "The catastrophe caused by the cold drop phenomenon on Tuesday, October 29 in Spain is of such magnitude that it can already be seen from space.\n[Initiatives to help the victims of the cold drop in various regions of Spain](https://www.outono.net/elentir/2024/10/30/initiatives-to-help-the-victims-of-the-cold-drop-in-various-regions-of-spain/)\n[The terrible images of the floods recorded in several regions of Spain](https://www.outono.net/elentir/2024/10/29/the-terrible-images-of-the-floods-recorded-in-several-regions-of-spain/)\nSeveral images from NASA's Landsat 8 satellite, released in the last few hours, show the extent of the damage caused by this catastrophe in the province of Valencia. Tonight at 9:48 p.m. CET, [NASA Landsat published these two photos.](https://x.com/NASA_Landsat/status/1852090203235660177) The first was taken by the satellite on October 6, and in it we can see the coastal lagoon of the Albufera de Valencia clearly outlined in blue (click on the images to see them enlarged):\nThe second image is from October 30. In it we see the Albufera de Valencia in a greenish color, surrounded to the north and south by two brown spots: the flooded areas.\n[The European Space Agency (ESA) has released a processed version of these images](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2024/10/Valencia_flood_disaster). Here we can see the first one, taken on October 8:\nHere we see the image from October 30th. The coastal lagoon of Albufera is completely overflowing:\nIn addition, this afternoon [the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)](https://x.com/JPSSProgram/status/1852068566536990991), a collaborative program of NASA and NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the USA), has published two more satellite images of this disaster. The first one shows the situation on the Valencian coast on September 30:\nThe second image is from September 30th, and in it we see the brown spots of flooding in the coastal areas of the Valencian Community:\nFinally, [this is the satellite image of Valencia published by Google Maps this year](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.4443342,-0.3716186,11263m/data=!3m1!1e3?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAyOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (I don't know the exact date this image was taken):\n[Soar.earth has published this image of the city of Valencia](https://soar.earth/draw/1739?pos=39.45151309295295%2C-0.4190965353553767%2C12.15) taken on October 30 by Landsat. We can clearly see the large amount of sediment that the Turia River is spewing into the Mediterranean Sea due to the floods:\nMy prayers are with all the people of Valencia, especially with the families of the dozens of people who have died in this catastrophe, the families of the missing people and those who have lost everything due to the floods.\nDon't miss the news and content that interest you.

    "title": "Nicole Kidman ‘Silently Struggling’ After Fans Notice Weight Loss | In Touch Weekly",
    "text": "A day after arriving in Sydney on a long-haul flight from the U.S., Keith Urban was back at the airport to pick up his wife of 17 years, Nicole Kidman , as she came home for Christmas on December 18.\nThe pair smiled widely as he led her by the hand and ushered her outside into his waiting car. “It was all very sweet and lovey-dovey — he even opened the car door for her,” says an observer, “but it definitely seemed a little bizarre, like they were putting on a show of unity and happiness for all of the cameras.”\nIn private, it’s a different story. “Nicole has been secretly struggling and doing her best to hide it,” says an insider exclusively to In Touch . But fans have started to notice her erratic social media posts, dramatic weight loss and changing face due to suspected plastic surgery. “Everyone wants to know what’s wrong with her. Even those close to her are concerned. The truth is, Nicole has been working herself ragged, and it’s taking a toll.”\nUnrelenting Schedule In the past two years, Nicole has filmed five TV shows and three movies. “She’s been acting in projects nearly back-to-back while also doing advertisements and producing,” says the insider. “She even just took on the job as a Balenciaga brand ambassador, as if she didn’t have enough on her plate.”\nAnother source reveals she also earns upwards of $1 million for a few hours’ work appearing at private events, such as corporate conventions and sales conferences. “The sheer frequency of these jobs seems to indicate she’s desperate for easy cash,” says the source. Despite already being worth an estimated $250 million, “it’s as if she fears if she turns down work opportunities, she’ll lose the career she worked so hard for,” the insider adds of the 56-year-old. “She’s shown no signs of slowing down.”\nBrokenhearted! See the Messiest Celebrity Breakups Ever Here And she throws herself into every new job, body and soul. As a practitioner of the Method acting style, she’s admitted her preparation for roles is “bats—t crazy.” She’s been known to lose herself in a character to the point where those on set have observed that “something inside her just snaps and she becomes a different person,” says the insider.\nIt’s difficult to turn off that level of intensity when she gets home. After making the 2020 series The Undoing , Nicole admitted, “I went down for a week because your immune system doesn’t know the difference between acting and truth.”\nThe side effects are more than just physical. “Certain things penetrate in a really deep way. There is just no getting around that, and I wish there was. It does take a toll on my health and my spirit,” she’s said, adding that sometimes when she gets home, her children “are going, ‘Why are you looking like that, Mummy?’”\nAlarming Photos Fans wonder the same thing. “Nicole has always been shy and slightly quirky, which can cause her to act awkwardly in social situations. But her recent behavior has drawn a lot of attention,” says the insider. “She just seems off at times.”\nIn a series of Instagram photos posted on November 30, the actress made faces while wearing just rock band T-shirts and no pants.\nSee Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman’s Complete Relationship Timeline Aside from acting like “she’s 15 years old,” as one commenter griped, others fretted about her bony frame and speculated that she seems to have gotten plastic surgery.\nScary Skinny In person, the changes are even more noticeable. “She looks incredibly skinny. People are whispering about how boney she is,” says a witness who’s seen her on set for the erotic thriller Babygirl in NYC recently. (Nutrition expert Dr. Fred Pescatore , who has not treated Nicole, estimates that the 5-foot-11 actress is about 25 pounds below the average weight for her height.) “Her face doesn’t look so sunken,” adds the witness, “because she appears to have had fillers.”\nNew York-based plastic surgeon Dr. Ramtin Kassir believes she’s done a lot more than that. “I think the [recent] pictures you see are the result of surgery, fillers and injectables,” says the doctor (who has not treated her), adding that he believes Nicole has had face, brow and neck lifts. (She admitted to using Botox in 2011 but claimed she stopped.) “When you get a lot of injectables and fillers, it interferes with the lymphatic drainage,” adds Dr. Kassir, “so you get this puffy balloon face.”\nMuch-Needed Break Some believe Nicole needs to slow down. “She tends to lose weight when she’s overworked,” notes the insider, adding that even an A-list Oscar winner can’t escape Hollywood’s demanding beauty standards, which have led to her being criticized for dressing in age-inappropriate outfits in photo shoots to maintain her youthful appearance. “And on top of dealing with all that public criticism, she’s not giving herself enough time to recover from the constant strain of travel and long working hours. She doesn’t have the comforts of home and barely sees her family, which is difficult for her and could explain why she doesn’t seem like herself.”\nSo Grown Up! Photos of Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman's Daughter Bella Today The holidays are her chance to recharge. “The good news is that she gets to spend them with her family,” the insider says of Keith, 56, and their daughters Sunday, 15, and Faith, 13, as well as Nicole’s mother and sister. “They mean everything to her. Nicole is going to cherish this time and try to relax and re-center herself for the new year — before she pushes herself too far.”\nHave a tip? Send it to us!

    "title": "Scientists Discover a New Color 'Olo' With Lasers",
    "text": "Although a team of California scientists have discovered what is being called a new color, it may be a while before it winds up in any consumer products.\nResearchers at the University of California, Berkeley, used laser beams on five participants to stimulate cone-cells in their retinas, which led to sightings of the same ultra-saturated blue-green. Their findings were published last week in Science Advances. Ren Ng, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, co-authored the study and participated in the experiment along with two of his colleagues. Each subject in the study has a laser beamed into one of their retinas, which have cone cells that control an individual’s perception of color.\nEach participant had three cone cells “S,” “L” and “M,” which are sensitive to wavelengths of blue, red and green. Using a laser to stimulate M cone cells, which are sensitive to wavelengths of green, participants were said to have seen a color that had not been seen in natural vision.\nYou May Also Like\nAnyone who remembers the global online debate about the color of a dress in 2015 understands that colors can literally be in the eye of the beholder. Some saw the dress in question as white and gold, and others saw it as black and blue.\nNg acknowledged that human color vision is “highly adaptive and subjective.” He said, “In color vision science, we have to be very careful.”\nFor the olo study, to know that the subjects were truly seeing a blue-green that was more saturated than anything possible in the normal world, the subjects had to directly compare olo against the most saturated natural teal. That was created with a laser in the teal wavelength. Olo looked much more saturated, according to Ng, who said that olo needed to be desaturated with white light before it could be matched to the natural teal.\nGiven that olo can now only be seen by directly stimulating thousands of cells in the retina, it will not be utilized in consumer products anytime soon. Ng said that it could not be produced as a paint or fabric, but it is theoretically possible to incorporate olo into display technology in the future.\nEnvisioning olo requires some imagination. Ng noted that the color in the large square that accompanies this article is meant to only give readers a sense of olo. He said, “But this is extremely pale and what distinguishes olo is how incredibly saturated it appears. If you could dial the saturation of the square that is shown here higher and higher, you could get to a blue-green that looks like peacock feathers. Beyond that, you would get to laser light at the teal wavelength. That is the definition of the most saturated teal one can see in the real world.”\n“Olo is the color you get, if you could dial the saturation beyond. Directly compared to olo, laser teal pales in comparison. That may enable folks to imagine olo,” Ng said.\nLeatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, said that she has read about olo. But having not been one of the five people who viewed the actual color, she said it would be difficult to find the closest Pantone match. But she added, “As it is described, there is the possibility that it is close to a deeply saturated Pantone blue-green that is already in the system.”\nEiseman believes that talk about the possibility of a “new” color will cause a lot of buzz on social media and via media outlets. That will bring attention to that blue-green color grouping such as a deep teal that already exists, according to Eiseman.\nAs of now, Ng’s team at the University of Berkeley is focused on the basic science and not on display technology commercialization. But one of the next things on the horizon in basic science is to see whether the human brain can perceive a dimension of color beyond the rainbow. He said, “If so, I suspect that would drive a lot of interest in trying to bring it into commercial display technology.”\nThe prospect of such limitless colors could bode well for designers, artists and consumers. Eiseman said, “People are always fascinated by that which can be imagined, but not actually seen.”\nThe public’s current zeal for space travel may be heightening interest in all things blue and teal. Eiseman said, “The olo type blue and blue-greens are very much connected to space travel, as those are the shadings that come into our consciousness when we think of outer terrestrial distances. We can only imagine what lies out there in outer space and a ‘new’ color certainly fits into that mysterious realm.”\nThe same might be said of the vibrant green comet that is believed to have broken apart. Astronomers and amateur skywatchers had been anticipating seeing the Comet C/2025 F2 (SWAN), with their naked eyes light up the night sky later this month.\nRegarding novel colors that could potentially appear in consumer products, Ng’s group at the University of California, Berkeley, is at work on another research project on tetrachromacy that is more relevant. Tetrachromacy is a rare ability that, according to a 2010 study, up to 12 percent of women worldwide have, due to having four types of cone cells in their retinas which allows them to distinguish hundreds of millions of colors. Most people have three types of cones and can tell apart several million types of colors. Their project, “Theory of Human Tetrachromatic Color Experience and Printing,” will explore how more of those colors might be put into practice.",

El Vaticano no afirmó cuántos días va a tener que estar internado aquí en el Gemelli, ya lleva cinco, y fue un comunicado de cinco párrafos que salió hace un ratito”.\nLa corresponsal señaló que, en el comunicado, el Vaticano especificó a qué tratamientos están sometiendo al Papa y que “se habló de complejidad”. “Lo vienen haciendo en el día de ayer, y que tuvieron ir cambiando la terapia antibiótica”, contó.\n“El comunicado también afirma que el Papa hoy recibió la Eucaristía, que estuvo rezando, que estuvo leyendo algunos textos y haciendo este reposo absoluto (…).

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Photo by New York Times Consider this your dependable, blank-slate turkey burger that will always be juicy and well-seared no matter how you embellish it. Add ground spices, such as cumin or garlic powder; chopped herbs; or Worcestershire sauce or anchovies for umami — or leave the patty alone. With just a swipe of ketchup or mustard, it’ll hold its own. Grated zucchini keeps the burgers moist, mayonnaise helps bind and brown them, and salting only on the outside ensures that the meat stays tender. (For a cheeseburger, drape sliced cheese on the patties during the last 2 minutes of cooking and cover the pan.)\nTurkey Zucchini Burgers\nIngredients:\n• Neutral oil (such as grapeseed),\nfor greasing\n• 1 pound ground turkey\n• 1/2 cup coarsely grated unpeeled\nzucchini (from 1 small zucchini)\n• 1 tablespoon mayonnaise\n• Kosher salt (such as Diamond\nCrystal) and black pepper\n• Hamburger buns, toasted\n• Toppings and condiments, as\ndesired\nDirections:\nLightly grease a plate with neutral oil and set aside. In a medium bowl, mix together the turkey, zucchini and mayonnaise. Form 4 patties, each about 4 1/2 inches wide (about 5 ounces). Press a small dimple in the center of each patty, then place the burgers on the plate and refrigerate to firm up for at least 5 minutes (or keep them covered for up to 2 days).\nHeat a large (12-inch) cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add about 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet to lightly coat. Generously season the tops of the patties with salt and pepper. Add the patties, seasoned-side down, to the skillet and cook until seared and dark brown, 3 to 5 minutes. (Don’t press down; that’ll release juices.) Season the tops generously with salt and pepper, then flip and cook until cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes, turning the heat down as necessary to avoid scorching.\nTransfer to a clean plate and let rest for at least 5 minutes before building into a burger on the buns with desired toppings and condiments.\nTotal time: 30 minutes, serves 4.\n© 2024 The New York Times Company\nDon't miss out on what's happening!
