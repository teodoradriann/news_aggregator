    "title": "HRCP report highlights marked rise in street crime, kidnappings in 2023",
    "text": "The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan’s (HRCP) annual report on the state of human rights in 2023 details the deteriorating law and order situation in Sindh, particularly the marked increase in street crime — about 11 percent in Karachi — and kidnappings. In response, the Sindh police launched a large-scale operation against dacoits in the Katcha (riverine) area with the help of the army and Rangers. Violations of civic and fundamental rights continued to take place. During the 9 May riots, a number of public and private properties were damaged. In an excessive crackdown by the state, over 25 PTI leaders, including former Sindh governor Imran Ismail, were arrested. Enforced disappearances of political workers, nationalists, lawyers and journalists also continued unabated, with at least 175 cases reported from different districts during the year. In another incident, a security operation in a village near Sakrand resulted in at least four people being killed extrajudicially and nine others injured, according to the report. The rights of vulnerable groups in Sindh also took a hit; scores of Afghan refugees and migrants were arrested and deported following the federal caretaker government’s executive order to deport ‘illegal’ foreigners. Unfortunately, the civil society’s response was visibly divided in Sindh, with a large faction endorsing the policy. Violence against women and children remained a persistent issue, with at least 546 cases of child abuse reported in Sindh during 2023. In terms of labour rights, the minimum wage for unskilled worker was increased to Rs32,000 although implementation of this wage at workplaces remained lax. Attacks on worship places of religious minorities, especially the Hindu and Ahmadi communities, and forced conversions were also reported, with the affected communities frequently demonstrating for an end to these violations. In welcome news, amendments to the Sindh Local Government Act were approved that gave mayors and chairs of municipal corporations more powers. Another key amendment paved the way for reserved seats for transgender persons in local councils for the first time, increasing representation and visibility for the community and their rights. However, the state must make a concentrated effort to uphold the fundamental rights of Sindh’s vulnerable groups, and restore law and order without further delay.",

    "title": "Ottawa declassifies more details from Rodal report on Nazi war criminals in Canada",
    "text": "OTTAWA — The federal government has released previously classified details from a report that outlines the extent to which Canada provided a safe haven to former Nazis during the Cold War. Ottawa faced renewed calls for greater transparency about the presence of war criminals in Canada after parliamentarians inadvertently gave two standing ovations last fall to a man who fought in a Nazi unit in the Second World War. Yaroslav Hunka, who fought for the Waffen-SS Galicia Division, a voluntary unit created by the Nazis to help fight the Soviet Union, was welcomed to the House of Commons last fall to hear a speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The report by researcher Alti Rodal, known as the Rodal report, was prepared as part of a Commission of Inquiry on War Criminals in Canada in 1985 and was intended to provide the commission with information on the historical policies and circumstances that led to the presence of Nazi war criminals in Canada. It was initially released under the Access to Information Act in heavily censored form in 1987, and more details were made public last summer in response to a Freedom of Information request by B’nai Brith Canada. The newly released and nearly complete version makes 15 previously classified pages public, the immigration minister's director of communications, Aissa Diop, said in a statement Thursday. \"While additional information that is no longer sensitive due to the passage of time can now be released, some information still remains protected in accordance with the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act,\" Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said in a news release Thursday. There are no individuals identified in the newly released version of the document, but it does include information Canada received in confidence from foreign governments, details previously protected under solicitor client privilege, as well as information that would harm international affairs and the enforcement of Canadian laws, Diop said. “Those who suffered under Nazi Germany and their descendants want transparency when it comes to this shameful chapter in our history,\" Immigration Minister Marc Miller said in a statement Thursday. Rodal's report concludes that in the decade following the war, there was “ample opportunity” for war criminals and Nazi collaborators to enter Canada. B’nai Brith Canada has advocated for the release of the full document since the 1980s, and filed several requests under Access to Information Laws in the past year, which the group says the government repeatedly denied. “We welcome this almost complete disclosure of the Rodal Report,” David Matas, who represented the group during the commission, said in a statement Wednesday. Though it has been 79 years since the Second World War and 37 years since Rodal's work was completed, Matas said ongoing mass atrocities and efforts by perpetrators to seek haven in Canada lend contemporary relevance to the report. \"We cannot learn from the past unless we know the past. The almost complete disclosure of the Rodal Report is an important step in coming to grips with our past and applying its lessons for the present,\" he said. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 1, 2024. Laura Osman, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "Lithium Ionic Unveils Significant Growth in Baixa Grande Resources\nHannah LewisUpdated: 02-27-2025 05:15 PM\nLithium Ionic Announces Technical Report for Enhanced Mineral Resources\nLithium Ionic Corp. (TSXV: LTH; OTCQX: LTHCF; FSE: H3N) has recently filed a technical report showcasing a 32% increase in the mineral resources at its Baixa Grande Lithium Project in Brazil. This updated Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) reflects significant advancements in the company’s exploration efforts, reinforcing its commitment to the lithium market.\nDetails of the NI 43-101 Technical Report\nThe independent technical report, prepared by GE21 Consultoria Mineral Ltda., is compliant with NI 43-101 standards and reveals valuable insights into the updated resources present at the Baixa Grande site. The report identifies Measured and Indicated resources of 6.52 million tonnes at a grade of 1.11% Li?O, translating to around 179,580 tonnes of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE). Furthermore, the Inferred category holds an additional 12.90 million tonnes at 0.96% Li?O, contributing to a robust resource base in Brazil's Lithium Valley.\nImplications of the Technical Report\nThis technical report is crucial for Lithium Ionic as it marks a significant milestone in the company’s journey. By unveiling this enhanced resource base, Lithium Ionic is solidifying its role as a pivotal player in the rapidly expanding lithium market, which is essential for powering electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions.\nBaixa Grande Project: A Promising Asset\nThe Baixa Grande project, located within a fruitful region rich in spodumene-bearing pegmatites, is a key asset for Lithium Ionic.

    "text": "The Memphis Grizzlies have been on fire since the return of their star point guard, Ja Morant, after serving a 25-game suspension. With Morant back in action, the team has gone undefeated, winning all four games. This winning streak is in stark contrast to their 6-9 record without Morant at the start of the season. The Grizzlies' recent come-from-behind victory against the New Orleans Pelicans showcased Morant's impact on the court and his ability to lead his team to victory. During the game, Morant did a dance [celebration](https://www.vladtv.com/article/302636/ja-morant-pulls-out-gun-celebration-after-game-clinching-dunk-against) called \"pistols and bazooka,\" which many incorrectly associated with firearms. While discussing the situation, Gilbert Arenas told Shannon Sharpe it is actually a New Orleans dance, a cultural expression common among NBA players like Russell Westbrook. This dance is a form of joy and celebration, not aggression or anger. The confusion arises from the optics, as people tend to associate any form of gun-related gestures negatively. They also spoke about Morant's return profoundly impacting the team. The Grizzlies were struggling without him, highlighting his importance on the court. With his leadership, the team has quickly turned things around, currently enjoying an undefeated streak. This performance solidifies Morant's status as one of the future stars of the NBA and a player who can be marketed effectively to the Grizzlies' audience. To hear more, including Gilbert speaking about Morant being \"Ja Wick,\" hit the above video. Source: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TuxCdSgaxg)",

    "text": "آتش پارکینسون از روده زبانه میکشد\nسالها «بیماری پارکینسون» تنها به عنوان اختلالی مغزی شناخته میشد؛ بیماریای که با خاموش شدن سلولهای تولیدکننده «دوپامین» (Dopamine) در مغز، حرکت و تعادل را بهتدریج از بیمار میگیرد. اما نشانههایی که گاه دههها پیش از بروز مشکلات حرکتی پدیدار میشوند، داستان دیگری روایت میکنند؛ یبوست مزمن، خوابهای ناآرام و کاهش حس بویایی، همه خبر از آغاز مسیری میدهند که ظاهراً از مغز شروع نشده است. در دل روده، جایی که میلیاردها میکروب در سکوت زندگی میکنند، تغییری آرام، اما عمیق رخ میدهد و همین تغییر، شاید نخستین جرقه این بیماری باشد. امروز، پژوهشهای تازه با دنبال کردن رد این تغییرات، ارتباطی شگفتانگیز میان میکروبهای روده و «بیماری پارکینسون» را آشکار ساختهاند.\nروده و میکروبیوم؛ کلید راز بیماری\nنشانههای این تغییر دیدگاه به تدریج و از چند دهه پیش آشکار شد. پزشکان متوجه شدند که بسیاری از بیماران، سالها پیش از بروز علائم حرکتی، از مشکلاتی مانند یبوست مزمن، اختلالات خواب و حتی کاهش حس بویایی رنج میبرند. این علائم زودهنگام، که گاهی تا ۲۰ سال پیش از مشکلات حرکتی دیده میشوند، سرنخی مهم برای دانشمندان بود که شاید بیماری از جایی خارج از مغز آغاز میشود. با پیشرفت فناوری «توالییابی ژنوم میکروبی» (Microbiome sequencing) و امکان بررسی دقیق «میکروبیوم روده»\n(Gut microbiome)، پژوهشگران شروع به مقایسه جمعیت باکتریهای روده در بیماران و افراد سالم کردند. نتایج اولیه حیرتآور بود. بیماران پارکینسون نهتنها ترکیب متفاوتی از باکتریها داشتند، بلکه تغییرات میکروبیوم آنها سالها پیش از ظهور علائم حرکتی رخ میداد.\nمطالعه جدید و کشف ارتباط ویتامینها\nدر تازهترین گام، تیمی به سرپرستی «هیروشی نیشیوآکی» (Hiroshi Nishiwaki) از «دانشگاه ناگویا» (Nagoya University) ژاپن، پژوهشی منتشر کرد که نقطه عطفی در فهم این ارتباط به شمار میرود. آنها نمونههای مدفوع ۹۴ بیمار پارکینسونی و ۷۳ فرد سالم نسبی را در ژاپن آنالیز کردند و نتایج را با دادههای حاصل از چین، تایوان، آلمان و آمریکا مقایسه کردند. با وجود تفاوتهای جغرافیایی و گونههای مختلف باکتریایی، الگوی یکسانی دیده شد: مسیرهای زیستی مربوط به تولید دو ویتامین حیاتی به نامهای «ریبوفلاوین» (Riboflavin)، «ب ۲» (B2)، «بیوتین» (Biotin) و «ب ۷» (B7) در بیماران دچار اختلال بود.\nتأثیر کمبود ویتامینها بر سلامت مخاط روده\nاین یافته نقطه شروع زنجیرهای از اتفاقات بیوشیمیایی را توضیح میدهد. کاهش ریبوفلاوین و بیوتین به افت سطح «اسیدهای چرب کوتاهزنجیر» (Short-chain fatty acids - SCFAs) و «پلیآمینها» (Polyamines) منجر میشود. این دو ترکیب برای حفظ سلامت لایه مخاطی روده و جلوگیری از افزایش نفوذپذیری آن حیاتیاند. وقتی لایه مخاطی ضعیف میشود، روده به اصطلاح «نشتپذیر» میگردد و سموم محیطی از جمله مواد شوینده، آفتکشها و علفکشها به آسانی وارد جریان خون میشوند.\nاینجاست که نقش این سموم در مکانیسم پارکینسون آشکار میشود. تحقیقات نشان دادهاند که چنین ترکیباتی میتوانند تولید بیشازحد «فیبریلهای آلفا-سینوکلئین» (Alpha-synuclein fibrils) را تحریک کنند. این پروتئینها به شکل غیرطبیعی تاخورده، تمایل به تجمع در سلولهای عصبی دارند و در بیماران پارکینسون، بهویژه در سلولهای تولیدکننده دوپامین، انباشته میشوند. تجمع آنها نهتنها عملکرد سلولی را مختل میکند، بلکه التهاب عصبی را نیز دامن میزند. این التهاب، به مرور زمان، مسیرهای حرکتی مغز را تخریب کرده و علائم کلاسیک بیماری را آشکار میکند.\nاز روده تا مغز؛ مسیر انتقال پروتئینهای آسیبزا\nبه گزارش سایت «ساینس آلارت» (science alert) شواهد نشان میدهند که این پروتئینهای سمی میتوانند از روده به مغز منتقل شوند، احتمالاً این کار از طریق «عصب واگ» (Vagus nerve) که یکی از مهمترین شاهراههای ارتباطی روده و مغز است؛ انجام میشود. این مسیر انتقال، ایده «محور روده-مغز» (Gut-Brain Axis) را از یک فرضیه به یک مدل علمی معتبر ارتقا داده است.\nاین یافتهها همچنین با شواهد تاریخی همخوانی دارند. یک مطالعه در سال ۲۰۰۳ نشان داد که مصرف دوز بالای ریبوفلاوین میتواند عملکرد حرکتی بیماران پارکینسون را بهبود دهد، بهویژه در بیمارانی که گوشت قرمز را از رژیم خود حذف کردهاند. آن زمان ارتباط مستقیمی میان کمبود این ویتامین و تغییرات میکروبیوم مطرح نبود، اما امروز این حلقه گمشده بهخوبی پیدا شده است.\nبا این حال، پژوهشگران تأکید میکنند که پارکینسون یک بیماری چندعاملی است و همه بیماران از مسیر بیوشیمیایی یکسانی به آن نمیرسند. برخی ممکن است بیشتر تحت تأثیر عوامل ژنتیکی باشند، برخی دیگر بیشتر از عوامل محیطی آسیب ببینند، و در تعدادی، ترکیبی از هر دو عامل نقش داشته باشد. از این رو، توصیه میشود که پیش از هر مداخله درمانی، آنالیز میکروبهای روده یا بررسیهای مدفوع انجام شود تا کمبودهای خاص هر بیمار شناسایی گردد. سپس میتوان بهطور هدفمند مکمل ریبوفلاوین و بیوتین را تجویز کرد.\nنگاهی فراگیر به آینده درمان پارکینسون\nاین دیدگاه جدید، پیام مهمی برای پیشگیری نیز دارد. اگر میکروبیوم سالم بتواند از بروز تغییرات آغازین بیماری جلوگیری کند، آنگاه تغییرات سبک زندگی، رژیم غذایی غنی از فیبر و پروبیوتیکها، و کاهش تماس با آلایندههای شیمیایی میتواند بخشی از استراتژی پیشگیری باشد. چنین رویکردی نهتنها بر بهبود کیفیت زندگی بیماران تمرکز دارد، بلکه ممکن است بتواند آغاز بیماری را به تأخیر بیندازد یا حتی از آن جلوگیری کند.\nبه این ترتیب، آنچه زمانی تنها در محدوده مغز جستوجو میشد، اکنون به نقشهای گستردهتر و چندبعدی بدل شده است که روده، سیستم ایمنی، محیط زیست و سبک زندگی را در هم میآمیزد. آینده درمان پارکینسون شاید در ترکیبی از مداخلات دارویی، اصلاح میکروبیوم و تغییرات محیطی نهفته باشد رویکردی که ریشه بیماری را هدف میگیرد، نه فقط شاخههای آن.\nآنچه سالها به عنوان یک اختلال صرفاً مغزی شناخته میشد، امروز چهرهای تازه یافته است. «بیماری پارکینسون» دیگر فقط داستان مرگ سلولهای عصبی در مغز نیست؛ بخشی از روایت آن در ژرفای رودهها نوشته میشود، جایی که تغییرات میکروبیوم میتواند آغازگر زنجیرهای از رویدادها باشد که به تخریب عصبی منتهی میشوند. این کشف نهتنها افق تازهای برای درک مکانیزم بیماری گشوده، بلکه امید به مداخلات سادهتر و مؤثرتر از مکملهای ویتامینهای گروه «ب» گرفته تا اصلاح سبک زندگی و کاهش تماس با سموم را زنده کرده است. آینده درمان پارکینسون، بیش از هر زمان دیگر، در گرو نگاه جامع به بدن و احترام به پیوند ظریف میان روده و مغز خواهد بود.\nانتهای پیام/",
