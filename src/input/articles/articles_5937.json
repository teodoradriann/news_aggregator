    "title": "Blackstone Inc. (BX) Outperforms Broader Market: What You Need to Know - December 28, 2023 - Zacks.com",
    "text": "Blackstone Inc. ( BX Quick Quote BX - Free Report ) ended the recent trading session at $133.13, demonstrating a +0.39% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.04%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.14%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.03%.\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the investment manager had gained 19.07% over the past month. This has outpaced the Finance sector's gain of 8.22% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.28% in that time.\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Blackstone Inc. in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.03, down 3.74% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $2.58 billion, indicating a 10.34% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $3.86 per share and a revenue of $9.74 billion, signifying shifts of -25.34% and -22.61%, respectively, from the last year.\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Blackstone Inc. should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.46% lower. Blackstone Inc. currently has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell).\nWith respect to valuation, Blackstone Inc. is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 34.33. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 11.46 for its industry.\nInvestors should also note that BX has a PEG ratio of 5.33 right now. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Financial - Miscellaneous Services was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.16 at yesterday's closing price.\nThe Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry is part of the Finance sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 174, positioning it in the bottom 31% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.",

The next year, he missed seven games due to injury, totaling 356 yards on 28 receptions. In 2023, he posted 667 yards on 53 catches.

Los enfrentamientos entre las Fuerzas Armadas Sudanesas (SAF) y las Fuerzas de Apoyo Rápido (RSF) han cobrado más de 16.650 vidas, mientras que 24,8 millones de personas requieren asistencia humanitaria urgente.

Hay que actuar. La ONU sirve de muy poco. Només s'intenta crear opinió pública per adoptar mesures poc ètiques. Un exemple és Veneçuela, occident vol robar-li el petroli i per tant, surt a les notícies cada dia. Sudan no deu tenir minerals valuosos i no deu interessar. La ONU és una banda de pallassos que només regula que els oligarques segueixin tenint privilegis En España también tenemos el problema de avalanchas de inmigrantes y nadie se inmuta,y esto sí que es un problema serio. El mundo en general es una olla a presión,sólo falta una chispita para irnos todos al garete",

    "text": "Génial ! Un clavier physique pour iPhone On pourrait appeler ce miniclavier Back to the future ! Quand l’ère des téléphones intelligents plein écran est apparue avec la première génération d’iPhone, ce fut le coup de grâce pour la canadienne BlackBerry. Mais pas pour cette petite entreprise qui récupère la part matérielle des BlackBerry ou des Nokia ; le clavier physique. [Clicks Technology](https://www.clicks.tech/) dévoile aujourd'hui le clavier Clicks creator pour les iPhone. Il s'agit d’un retour nostalgique à l'époque de BlackBerry et Nokia, où appuyer sur des boutons physiques était le summum de la communication mobile. « Nous utilisons des claviers sur nos ordinateurs de bureau, nos ordinateurs portables et nos tablettes tous les jours – il est donc un peu étrange que nous ayons abandonné les touches physiques sur le téléphone intelligent », selon Michael Fisher, cofondateur de Clicks Technology. Bonus : davantage d’espace sur l’écran Le clavier Clicks réunit les avantages du toucher et de la dactylographie. En déplaçant le clavier hors de l'écran lorsque vous tapez, Clicks double presque l'écran disponible. Avec de véritables touches, vous pouvez désormais ressentir dans vos doigts la délicate pression de vos frappes lorsque vous tapez vos textes et messages. Les claviers Clicks intègrent aussi les raccourcis tels que Commande + H pour naviguer vers l'écran d'accueil, ou Commande + Espace pour lancer la recherche. Comme vous le faites sur votre clavier d’ordinateur. 139 $US Le clavier Clicks se connecte directement à l'iPhone via le port Lightning ou USB-C. Clicks est vendu 139 dollars US (environ 190 $CA) pour les appareils iPhone 14 Pro et 15 Pro, et 159 $US pour l’iPhone 15 Pro Max. L'entreprise ouvre son carnet de commandes dès aujourd'hui, et précise qu'il sera expédié le 1erfévrier; au choix jaune ou gris. En espérant que l’entreprise développe une version étui-pile de son clavier physique pour iPhone.",
