Johnson writes about her two terms in office, decades ago — and caregiving for her spouse after he suffered a traumatic brain injury.\nBy Laura McCallum\nThe Minnesota Star Tribune September 19, 2024 at 7:00PM Marlene M. Johnson (John Kaul/U of Minn Press) Comment Gift Share Listen Since this is an election cycle of firsts — first Black woman to head a major party ticket, first time a Minnesota governor is on the ballot as a veep candidate (Humphrey and Mondale were U.S. Senators) — I looked forward to reading about another: Minnesota’s first woman lieutenant governor.\nMarlene M. Johnson, 78, served as DFL Gov. Rudy Perpich’s second-in-command for two terms, from 1983-91. Her book, “Rise to the Challenge: A Memoir of Politics, Leadership, and Love,” starts with her political career, then pivots to her role as a caregiver after her husband suffered a traumatic brain injury.\nFirst the politics, starting with a Minnesota history refresher: the late Perpich, an Iron Range DFLer opposed to abortion rights, was elected lieutenant governor in 1970, re-elected four years later on a ticket with Wendell Anderson. When Walter Mondale became V.P., Anderson was appointed to the Senate and Perpich became governor. He served one term, lost the next, then challenged the party’s endorsed candidate to win again. That detail is significant since it may have hindered Johnson’s ability to run for other offices later — some DFLers didn’t forget that her ticket bucked the party.\nWhen Perpich picked Johnson as his running mate, she said there was evidence that “the political establishment was not ready for a female lieutenant governor candidate.” Yet the ticket prevailed, and Perpich tasked her with leading the governor’s appointments, aiming to bring in more women and people of color, and expanding tourism.\nPolitical junkies will be interested in that section of the book, including the prominent people she mentions. Johnson met Mondale as a high school student, helped longtime legislator Linda Berglin win her first race and met a young Joe Biden while campaigning for a congressional candidate in 1976.\nJohnson was single when she was first elected, a workaholic who surrounded herself with friends and family for support. In her first year in office, she met a Swedish businessman, Peter Frankel, during a meeting about creating a “sister state relationship” between Minnesota and Sweden’s Kronoberg County. The two began a long-distance relationship that turned into a transatlantic marriage, even after she left public office and moved to D.C. to run a nonprofit for international educators.\nThe logistics of making that work, with two homes in two countries, is fascinating. Then in 2010, Peter fell down the stairs, and the last third of the book focuses on his convalescence in Sweden. Also interesting — but maybe less so for readers who pick up the book expecting a political memoir.\nRise to the Challenge (U of Minn Press) The book is organized thematically, not chronologically, so the narrative jumps around and there’s repetition in some chapters. And Johnson’s writing is a bit dry — she said she journaled her whole life and parts of it read that way, listing who came to visit and places they traveled.\nJohnson does offer insight into the challenges of both being a politico first and taking care of her husband as he slowly declined. One lesson? “Learning to let go of those things I can’t control.”\nRise to the Challenge: A Memoir of Politics, Leadership, and Love\nBy: Marlene M. Johnson.\nPublisher: University of Minnesota Press, 235 pages, $24.95.\nEvent: 7 p.m. Sept. 30, Humphrey School of Public Affairs, 301 19th Av. S., Mpls.

    "text": "Terraform Labs, the company behind the collapsed TerraUSD (UST) and Terra (LUNA) tokens, has reached a $4.47 billion civil settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nAccording to a June 12 Reuters report , the settlement comes after a jury found Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, liable for defrauding cryptocurrency investors . This alleged fraud resulted in estimated losses of $40 billion during the tokens’ collapse in 2022.\nThe proposed final judgment, filed in Manhattan federal court, requires approval from U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff. The settlement includes $4.05 billion in disgorgement plus interest for Terraform Labs and a $420 million civil fine.\nHowever, due to Terraform’s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, much of the settlement is unlikely to be paid and will instead be treated as an unsecured claim in the Chapter 11 case.\nTerra’s Do Kwon sentenced Do Kwon, who agreed to a personal civil fine of $80 million, will be banned from participating in cryptocurrency transactions and must transfer $204.3 million to Terraform’s bankruptcy estate. The SEC commented in a court filing:\nEntry of this judgment would ensure the maximal return of funds to harmed investors and put Terraform out of business for good. […] Thus, this proposed judgment is fair, reasonable, and in the public interest.\nBoth Terraform Labs and Kwon have consented to the judgment, although their lawyers have not provided immediate comments on the matter. The SEC accused the company and its founder of misleading investors about the stability of TerraUSD.\nThe TerraUSD stablecoin was meant to maintain a constant $1 price, and its backers falsely claimed that Terraform’s blockchain was used in a popular Korean mobile payment app. The collapse of TerraUSD and Luna in May 2022 occurred when TerraUSD failed to maintain its peg to the dollar.\nKwon, who designed both tokens, has been detained in Montenegro since March 2023. United States and South Korean authorities seek his extradition to face criminal charges. Despite the allegations, Kwon continues to deny any wrongdoing.",

Los Pumas 7’s habían llegado a París 2024 con chapa de candidato, muchísima confianza después de una temporada inolvidable en el Circuito Mundial de Seven y una ilusión enorme de subirse al podio olímpico, como habían hecho en Tokio al ganar el bronce. Aunque esta vez, apuntaban todo al oro. Pero se irán con las manos vacías (al menos si de resultado deportivo se habla). Porque en un partido picante y cargado de tensión en un Stade de France que fue, al igual que el miércoles, una caldera, los dirigidos por Santiago Gómez Cora cayeron por 26 a 14 ante Francia por los cuartos de final y se quedaron afuera de la lucha por las medallas. La tristeza de Revol, un emblema del seleccionado argentino, con el que está disputando su último torneo, fue la de todo un equipo que se vio superado por un rival que aprovechó muy bien su localía y que lo sorprendió con el planteo de juego. Y que lo pasó por arriba en un primer tiempo en el que los argentinos no encontraron la pelota, cometieron muchísimos errores y no pudieron pasar la mitad de cancha. Marcos Moneta , la estrella del conjunto albiceleste, no anduvo con vueltas cuando le preguntaron cuál fue el punto de quiebre del partido. “Para ellos, el kick-off. No arrancamos bien”, afirmó el Rayo , que volvió en este torneo olímpico después de más de tres meses de inactividad por la fractura en el peroné derecho que sufrió en abril. Aunque lo cierto es que los dueños de casa empezaron a jugar el match mucho antes de esa patada inicial, a través de l as casi 80 mil personas que llenaron el estadio y lo tiñeron de rojo, azul y blanco (colores que hasta adornaron los palos de las “H” en las salidas de los jugadores a la cancha). Ese público que hizo de cada error argentino una fiesta y que castigó cada acierto con una lluvia de silbidos y abucheos logró quebrar de alguna manera la cabeza de Los Pumas. Lo reconoció el mismo Gómez Cora. “No jugamos dentro de nuestro plan de juego. Creo que nos abrumó el entorno. Es aprendizaje. Hace 20 años cuando yo arrancaba como jugador había 20 personas en la tribuna . Estos chicos jugaban al principio sin que nadie esperara nada de ellos, con 50 espectadores. Y hoy, además, había una ilusión enorme de todo el pueblo argentino, porque les dimos con qué ilusionarse. Este público francés te fuerza a correr más y más y ellos lo disfrutaron y lo aprovecharon”, analizó el entrenador argentino. Francia fue un huracán en los primeros siete minutos. Se apoderó de la pelota desde el kick off, como dijo Moneta, y no la soltó más. Y en dos jugadas consecutivas logró anotar dos tries (Andy Timo a los 3m27 y Aaron Grandidier a los 4m49), que lo dejaron 14-0 arriba. Los argentinos no hacían pie en la cancha y estaban muy imprecisos en las recepciones, lo que los llevaba a equivocarse demasiado. Y los locales no perdonaron. Al ritmo del “Allez les Bleus” que se hacía eco en todos los rincones del estadio y ahogaba cualquier intento de aliento de los fanáticos albicelestes -que cantaban, pero no lograban hacerse oír-, los franceses estiraron la diferencia a 21-0 antes del descanso. El público festejó el cierre de la primera mitad como una victoria. Es que todo hacía pensar que el partido estaba liquidado. Sin embargo, los argentinos se animaron a soñar . “En el primer tiempo no anduvimos bien en defensa, fue el punto clave, no estábamos conectados. Pero nunca damos los partidos por perdidos, eso es lo que nos caracteriza. Con esa mentalidad salimos a jugar el segundo tiempo”, contó Luciano González . No había pasado ni un minuto y medio cuando Rodrigo Isgró , que regresó tras la sanción que le habían impuesto por aquel tackle peligroso en la Final de Madrid ante (justamente) Francia, sumó el primer try argentino y encendió la luz de esperanza. Tres minutos más tarde, y con un jugador más (por la amarilla a Jordan Sepho), Moneta -que un ratito antes había intentado sin éxito una jugada individual al patear larga la pelota hacia el ingoal para tratar de llegar a apoyar- se escapó tras un enorme pase de Isgró y sumó una conquista más. Y la buena puntería de Santiago Mare y de Joaquín Pellandini dejaron a Los Pumas a nada del empate: 14-21. Estuvo cerca el equipo argentino, pero no le alcanzó. Con el tiempo cumplido, Antoine Dupont se escapó en soledad y le puso números finales al marcador. Y le dio a los argentinos -que el sábado arrancarán la lucha por el quinto puesto ante Nueva Zelanda- el golpe más duro de los últimos tiempos. “ Las derrotas duelen y más de esta manera. En el primer tiempo no nos pudimos acomodar. En el segundo empezamos a encontrar nuestro juego y nos ilusionamos, pero pagamos el precio de un año que fue espectacular, pero que nos hizo llegar con cansancio, lesiones, suspendidos... y nos sacó el foco de nuestro juego. Hay que ajustar y terminar con la frente en alto. Si no tomamos esto como aprendizaje, la derrota no sirvió de nada. Las derrotas son parte del juego. Y en las derrotas no hay que exteriorizar culpas, sino aprender y seguir construyendo”, comentó el entrenador argentino. Isgró afirmó: “Es difícil hacer una análisis ahora. A veces los resultados no se dan y duele porque preparamos mucho este partido y significaba mucho para nosotros. Nos equivocamos en un montón de cosas, lo asumo, no quiero poner excusas. Pero nada va a cambiar el orgullo que siento por este equipo. Soñaba con una medalla. Vinimos para ganar y duele esta derrota. Para mí igual, ganamos en un montón de aspectos”.",

    "title": "Irán lanza por primera vez un satélite a una órbita por encima de 500 kilómetros - RT",
    "text": "El satélite de fabricación iraní Soraya ha sido puesto en órbita a 750 kilómetros de altura, siendo la primera vez que Irán supera los 500 kilómetros en este tipo de lanzamientos, informó la agencia IRNA el sábado, citando al Departamento de Defensa del país. El satélite fue lanzado al espacio con el cohete Qaim-100, un transportador vertical de combustible sólido de tres etapas de las Fuerzas Aeroespaciales del Cuerpo de la Guardia Revolucionaria Islámica. Según el Ministro de Comunicaciones iraní, el cohete puede transportar hasta 100 kilos, mientras que el satélite de investigación tiene un masa aproximada de 50. Desde Washington avisaron en 2020 que los lanzamientos de satélites de Irán desafían la resolución del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, e instaron a Teherán a no emprender ninguna actividad que involucre misiles balísticos capaces de transportar armas nucleares. Por su parte, la Inteligencia estadounidense alertó en junio de 2023, a través de un comunicado , que el desarrollo de vehículos de lanzamiento de satélites por parte de Irán \"acorta el cronograma\" para que el país desarrolle un misil balístico intercontinental, ya que utiliza tecnología similar. Cabe mencionar que las sanciones de 2011 de la ONU relacionadas con el programa de misiles balísticos de Irán expiraron el pasado mes de octubre.",

    "title": "La trufa alcanza precios de récord de hasta 3.000 euros el kilo por la sequía",
    "text": "La temporada de la trufa negra, tuber melanosporum, va camino de pasar a la historia por su escasez y por los precios desorbitados que alcanza el oro negro, de hasta 3.000 euros por kilo.\nLas previsiones del sector ya eran negativas en los inicios de la campaña en noviembre, como informó Mediterráneo, del grupo Prensa Ibérica, pero la\n[sequía](/tags/sequia/) crónica, que no da tregua, la han convertido en pésima en el interior de Castellón y no parece que vaya a cambiar hasta el cierre, a mediados de marzo.\nBuscadores y comerciantes coinciden en que la extrema falta de agua es el principal factor de la ausencia del preciado hongo. Además, la situación afecta tanto a la silvestre como a las de plantación.\nDiego Pitarch, experto trufero que gestiona plantaciones y regenta la carnicería l’Arc en Morella, donde también se venden trufas, destaca que \"los terrenos destinados a plantar están sacando mucho menos de lo esperado, concretamente estamos al 30% de la producción que deberíamos obtener en un año normal\".\nPeor aún es la coyuntura de la trufa silvestre, como remarca el buscador morellano, José Luis Grau: \"He salido tres días y no he visto nada. Lo poco que podía haber lo han arrasado los jabalís. La temporada depende únicamente de la trufa de plantación\".\nMonte \"muy seco\"\nSergi Borràs, de Cinctorres, comparte las opiniones de los otros aficionados: \"El monte está muy seco. El último día que salí no pude ni clavar el machete en el suelo. La silvestre es casi inexistente por la sequía\".\nAnte esta tesitura, el miedo en el sector es que la temporada concluirá mucho antes de lo esperado. \"Aún no hemos terminado el año y la producción es muy baja. Sin agua, tenemos muy difícil que se alargue mucho más durante los próximos meses\", asegura el especialista trufero Javier Segura.\n\"Precios por las nubes\"\nAl por menor, durante esta semana, se han llegado a pagar a 3.000 euros el kilo en la gama superextra de trufa, explica Pitarch. En su establecimiento en la capital de Els Ports no se han alcanzado estos importes \"por respeto al cliente\". Ha optado por partidas de segunda categoría, con un precio al detalle de 1.500 euros el kilo.\n\"Los precios están por las nubes. Son semanas de Navidad y de mucha demanda del sector hostelero\", dice Pitarch. Al respecto, Segura añade que \"la diferencia entre el mercado mayorista y al detalle es acusada y más en fiestas, pero los precios estallaron por la escasez\". El sector ha ofrecido trufas al por mayor con valores oscilantes entre 900 y 1.000 euros.",
