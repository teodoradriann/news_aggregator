The protest call, by various religious and political groups led by hardline Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) whose rallying cry is \"death to blasphemers\", said that remarks by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa in a case against a member of the minority Ahmadi community were blasphemous. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Islamabad | Updated: 23-02-2024 16:02 IST | Created: 23-02-2024 16:02 IST - Country: - Pakistan Hundreds of supporters from Pakistani Islamist parties on Friday rallied to protest against what they say were blasphemous remarks by the country's chief justice. The protest call, by various religious and political groups led by hardline Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) whose rallying cry is \"death to blasphemers\", said that remarks by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa in a case against a member of the minority Ahmadi community were blasphemous. The court had granted bail to an Ahmadi community member earlier this week, ruling that blasphemy charges against him did not stand. The man, accused of blasphemy for distributing Islamic literature, had been in jail for 13 months. \"We (will) monitor the sermons and protests outside mosques,\" said police official Abrar Hussain in southern city of Karahci, warning the protesters to remain peaceful. Hundreds of the protesters took to streets in the northwestern city of Peshawar, chanting slogans against the chief justice, said police official Mubarak Khan. The top court on Thursday issued a statement after the Islamist parties and some political groups launched a campaign accusing the chief justice of deviating in his ruling from the constitutional definition of a Muslim, which excludes Ahmadis. \"This impression is absolutely wrong,\" the court statement said, deploring what it called a \"vicious campaign\" against Isa. The campaign against Isa was also joined by some supporters and aides of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who think a ruling by the chief justice stripping Khan's party of its symbol on ballots cost them votes in an election on Feb. 8. Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party's information secretary Rauf Hasan did not respond to a request for a comment. Human rights groups say Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores, and just accusing someone of such a crime could lead to mob justice. Judges hesitate to take up such cases for fear of retribution, which leaves accused languishing in jail for years without cases being heard. Blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan. No one has been executed by the state for it, but numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs.

    "text": "En medio de una niebla tremenda en Anfield Road y con el escenario del 'Boxing Day' de fondo, el Liverpool amplió su renta al remontar al Leicester City (3-1) y, pese a tener un partido menos, tiene una ventaja de siete puntos sobre el Chelsea y de 14 sobre el Manchester City en la cima de la Premier League inglesa.\nLos de Arne Slot cerraron la jornada postnavideña con un trabajado triunfo ante los 'Foxes', que sólo necesitó seis minutos para adelantarse por medio de Jordan Ayew, pero que acabó notando la presión y arrollo del mejor equipo de Europa.\nJusto antes del descanso, en el tiempo de descuento, Cody Gakpo dibujó una parábola a la escuadra para empatar el juego cimentar la remontada de los Reds.\nEn la segunda mitad, no tardó ni cinco minutos el Liverpool en poner el 2-1. Curtis Jones en el primer palo culminó una gran combinación iniciada por Salah y continuada con un pase raso de Alexis Mac Allister. Jones empujó la pelota de primeras y, pese a que el VAR revisó un posible fuera de juego, el tanto subió al marcador y el Liverpool respiró tranquilo.\nLas ocasiones empezaron a fluir y, aunque a Gakpo le anularon su doblete por un fuera de juego de Darwin Núñez, lo que no se pudo evitar fue el tanto de Salah, el decimosexto de esta Premier League al 82' para poner cifras definitivas.\nEl egipcio clavó el esférico en el palo largo y se dirigió a la grada con los brazos abiertos. Esta le respondió con su cántico habitual y sólo queda que la directiva de su escuadra le ofrezca un nuevo contrato.\nA nivel grupal, el Liverpool, con un partido menos, tiene 42 puntos, siete más que el Chelsea y ocho más que el Nottingham Forest; si ganara el Arsenal al Ipswich Town este viernes, el equipo de Mikel Arteta se colocaría como el máximo perseguidor, con una desventaja de seis unidades.\n*Con información de EFE",

    "text": "Cake in the time of war, in Gaza RAFAH, Gaza Strip — There is war in Gaza, and now, for some, there is also cake — with peanut butter cream, coconut flakes and sprinkles. Batool Cakes, [a professional bakery](https://www.facebook.com/batoolcake2) with three branches throughout Gaza, started baking cakes at its Rafah branch a month ago, for the first time since the Israel-Hamas war began. It's surprisingly busy with orders in a city of tent camps, shelters and bread lines. \"We were shocked by the huge demand,\" says Ibrahim Abu Hani, head baker and co-owner of the family business. It might sound jarring: a cake shop in Rafah, the southernmost city that has become swollen with the majority of Gaza's population, many of whom eat only one meal a day, and facing an Israeli threat to send in troops for a final battle against Hamas. Selling cake — while, at the opposite end of Gaza, in the battered north, Palestinians suffer extreme hunger. But children need cheering up. Birthdays come only once a year. And couples won't let a war delay their weddings. \"We Gazans love life. People are pushing themselves to hope,\" Abu Hani says. \"Because there are no other options.\" The first cake orders Abu Hani had not planned on making cakes during this war. He had to flee his home, like most people in Gaza. As Rafah took in more than 1.5 million Palestinians fleeing the fighting, he kept the cake shop open, without cake, just to let people charge their phones for free. There's no electricity now in Gaza, and the bakery runs on solar power. A month ago, a man walked into the bakery. He told Abu Hani his son had been injured in the war, gone to the hospital, woken up from the anesthesia and said: \"My birthday has arrived. Where is the cake you promised?\" \"Should we work on the cake?\" Abu Hani wondered. He didn't have to think twice. He got started, using leftover ingredients in the bakery from before the war began. As he was baking that first cake, another man walked into the shop. His little daughter was scared by the war and he wanted to throw her a party. He became Abu Hani's second customer. Little by little, the baker was baking again. Every cake comes with a story \"Each person who came in had his own story,\" he says. One evening, as Abu Hani was closing up for the day, a man begged for a cake for his wedding that very night. \"It's the night of my life, and I'm living in a tent,\" Abu Hani recalls the groom said. The baker couldn't resist. Some customers ask for a take-home bag that's not see-through, so other people in their tent camp won't get jealous of their cake. \"Two hours ago,\" the baker says, \"someone called me and said, 'I'm embarrassed to come to the shop. I'm in a shelter. Ever since we passed by your shop, my child has been asking for a cake.'\" The caller couldn't afford a whole cake, and asked if he could buy a smaller one. The baker told him to pay whatever he could. Abu Hani handles each cake, and customer, with care. Flour from the black market During the war, supplies in Gaza are low and prices are high. Sugar and eggs cost a fortune — a kilo of sugar has jumped from $1 to $20 in Rafah, and a large crate of eggs that normally sells for $10 can now cost more than $50, he says. Batool Cakes now sells its standard \"mini-medium\" cakes for 70 shekels, or nearly $17 — up from its pre-war price of 35 shekels, nearly $10, due to the rising cost of ingredients during the war. Abu Hani is not making a profit on his bakery. He buys black-market flour that belongs to the United Nations, that is meant to be given away as aid. He says he feels bad, but that it's worth it to see the joy in his customers' eyes. Abu Hani struggles to find other ingredients. He can't find the cream he used to buy. He has butter cream, but he says people in Gaza don't like it. They prefer lighter cream, so he's trying to recreate it from scratch. He closes the bakery whenever he needs to test a new recipe. He doesn't want to sell something that's not first rate. He says the people of Gaza deserve it. Even in their worst desperation, he says, they have standards, and he has standards, too. The war hasn't changed that. \"We are not a garbage dump. We are not a place where people will eat just anything,\" Abu Hani says. \"People in Gaza have very refined taste.\" Copyright 2024 NPR.
