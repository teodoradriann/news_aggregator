    "text": "Campaign spokeswoman: Permanent ceasefire a first step to end the unfortunate situation (French) The Global Campaign for an Immediate, Permanent Ceasefire in Gaza has called for New Year's Eve celebrations to be an opportunity to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, and to carry out a symbolic event to accompany local celebrations around the world. A statement from the campaign said it called for making the New Year's Eve moment \"an opportunity to make decisions for a brighter future\". \"With nearly 30,10 civilians killed, including more than , children, our only decision in the new year is to call for a permanent ceasefire.\" The campaign aims to mobilize people from around the world to join their local New Year's Eve celebrations, on 31 December, to call for an immediate and lasting ceasefire in Gaza. \"Our goal is to turn the traditional countdown to the new year into an effective and resounding countdown to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza,\" the statement said. \"The campaign has been successfully embraced by more than 30 countries united in its mission to stop the brutal killing of civilians and save lives in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel,\" the statement said. \"A permanent ceasefire is the first step to ending the current unfortunate situation, and a concrete move towards a future where trauma-affected communities can rebuild and recover,\" said campaign spokeswoman Bushra Mohammed. According to its founders, the campaign was launched in London in mid-December by a group of young activists who fell apart on social media. Source : Al Jazeera",

    "title": "Ukraine Funding Debate Persuaded Allies To Increase Defense",
    "text": "It’s always nice when your political opponents make your arguments for you. And in the recent dustup over the $60 billion Ukraine subsidy bill — which in late April passed [the House](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2024/04/20/ukraine-israel-border-funding-house-vote/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) and [Senate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2024/04/23/senate-vote-tiktok-ban-ukraine-israel-aid/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) — that’s precisely what foreign policy hawks have done. As many beltway wonks have observed, increasing debate in the United States over funding the two-year-old war in Ukraine — not to mention our myriad other military commitments around the globe — has led many U.S. allies to reconsider their own defense spending. In other words, just the fact that there is no longer a consensus about America’s “policeman of the world” post-Cold War security strategy among the American people and their representatives is persuading our allies to meet the various military commitments we have been demanding of them since [Ronald Reagan was president](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/22/world/us-warns-its-allies-they-must-increase-military-spending.html). That should be designated a strategic win, but, as interpreted by our blinkered foreign policy establishment — who have unswervingly endorsed the growing number of U.S. military disasters this century — it is somehow a loss. Max Boot: Exhibit A in the Incompetent Internationalists Museum Leading the charge of incoherence in service of our discredited conventional foreign policy is Washington Post columnist and “former neoconservative” Max Boot. In an [April 29 op-ed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/29/ukraine-aid-trump-isolationism-threat/), Boot argues the recent scuttlebutt over the Ukraine funding bill “should give U.S. allies pause about whether they can still count on the United States.” He notes that “U.S. allies will have to make contingency plans on the assumption that America may no longer be there for them in the future.” He cites as evidence of this shifting paradigm the fact that [Canada and the European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization raised their defense budgets by 11 percent in 2023](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_222664.htm). Japan, too, is [set to increase defense spending](https://thediplomat.com/2023/12/japan-approves-16-5-increase-in-defense-spending-for-fy2024/) by 16.5 percent this year. He adds that U.S. allies should “do more to strengthen their multilateral defense ties” and “raise defense spending.” One would think this is good news, given that U.S. administrations [since at least when Boot and his family emigrated to the United States during the Carter administration](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1981/03/22/footing-the-bill-for-nato/06c1bebc-6dd1-4c92-9aa0-950f2c398003/) have been failing to persuade our European NATO allies to pick up the slack and increase their defense budgets. But no, in Boot’s eyes, this can only be understood as America “turning its back on the world.” Indeed, Boot bemoans the end of the decades-long “underlying, bipartisan consensus in U.S. politics that internationalism was in America’s interest.” Now that there’s no such consensus, Boot cries, even when America gets what it wants from its allies. Boot was an early advocate for the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq. In a [2001 article](https://web.archive.org/web/20220526073157/https:/www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/the-case-for-american-empire) titled “The Case for American Empire,” Boot urged U.S. intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq, writing: “Once Afghanistan has been dealt with, America should turn its attention to Iraq … Once we have deposed Saddam, we can impose an American-led, international regency in Baghdad, to go along with the one in Kabul.” In 2011, Boot [endorsed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303661904576451913355531024) the NATO intervention in Libya, a disaster [still affecting Europe](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44709974). Thus does the bizarre illogic of Boot’s opinions become manifest: our allies’ increased defense spending makes them less client states dependent on America to protect them, and thus less willing to cooperate with the kinds of disastrous adventurism that has defined U.S. foreign policy the last two decades. Foreign Policy Gurus Won’t Admit the Obvious Not that Boot is all that unusual among the Western foreign policy establishment in lamenting that growing U.S. concern over decades of military adventurism and foreign policy overreach is provoking worried responses from Washington’s traditional security partners. Earlier this year, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg [conceded to criticism](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/14/nato-chief-concedes-spending-criticism-as-allies-up-defense-budget.html) that some NATO members were guilty of underfinancing the coalition’s defense budget, while also noting a record 18 allies were set to meet their military spending goals this year because of fears the United States might no longer fulfill once-presumed security guarantees. “European diplomats and officials said that continuing their upwards spending trajectory was the first of a three-plank Trump containment strategy,” [reported the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/2e7fe5e0-2eb7-4ee3-be04-22f9ca856bd4). The Japan Times [cited](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/commentary/2024/02/13/world/world-watching-as-us-dithers/) numerous international security experts blaming Trump and a dysfunctional Congress for increased concerns about U.S. security commitments in the Pacific region. “Allies are hedging,” it noted, and then added, arrestingly, “which can be a good thing. Governments are increasing defense spending and diversifying security relationships.” A [March 23 CNN analysis](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/23/europe/eu-ukraine-aid-us-defense-intl-cmd/index.html) reported: “Europe is trying to fill a US-shaped hole in funding for Ukraine,” as if it is America, and not Ukraine’s immediate neighbors, which needs to be most concerned about Russian aggression in eastern Europe. A Realist Victory in U.S. Foreign Policy At a February campaign event, former President Trump recounted a story about an unidentified NATO member. Trump reported telling the NATO member: “You didn’t pay? You’re delinquent? No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay. You gotta pay your bills.” In a rare exception from establishment hand-wringing over such threats, a [March op-ed in Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/03/07/trump-nato-europe-russia-defense-spending/) acknowledged that Trump’s “inflammatory comments [about NATO] could have the positive effect of forcing European leaders to contribute more to their continent’s defense.” This reality frustrates Boot and other foreign policy wonks: the most effective mechanism for persuading our allies in Europe and Asia to take their own security more seriously has been to persuade them that their U.S. big brother may not always come to their rescue. Those are harsh words, especially for nations with whom we have enjoyed strategic partnerships for many decades. Yet it’s the only tactic that has proved effective in a half-century of Washington finger-wagging at NATO and other allies. In truth, it’s the harsh consequences of post-Cold War neoconservative and liberal foreign policy that necessitates such tough love toward our friends around the globe. Military intervention in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria [cost](https://www.brown.edu/news/2021-09-01/costsofwar) America approximately $8 trillion, resulted in the deaths of about 900,000 people, and [displaced more than 30 million people](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/figures#:~:text=People%20Displaced%3A%2038%20Million,Yemen%2C%20Somalia%20and%20the%20Philippines.). For decades we foolishly bled our military and budgets, making us weaker and less prepared for a future conflict that threatens our national security. Thus you would think anything that pushes our allies to do their fair share would be welcomed by the likes of Boot and his fellow travelers. That it has instead provoked criticism of increasingly vocal realism and restraint among conservatives tells you all you need to know about the group-think delusions of our internationalist “experts.”",

    "text": "Valladolid\nLa 'melé más grande del mundo' se queda a las puertas del récord GuinnessSecciones\nServicios\nValladolid\nLa 'melé más grande del mundo' se queda a las puertas del récord Guinness«'Crouch', 'bind' y 'set', ahora fuerte, fuerte y aguantamos». Así ha sido el grito de guerra para dar comienzo a un nuevo récord mundial, la melé más grande del mundo, en Valladolid -con una de las formaciones más características del rugby donde los delanteros ... reinician el juego con una lucha por la posesión-. Una gesta que ha reunido a más de mil personas en la Plaza Mayor en la tarde de este jueves 30 de enero, pero que, sin embargo, no han sido suficientes para ocupar un lugar en la historia.\nUn récord que estaba fijado en 1.080 personas y que se ha quedado a las puertas de ser superado. Desde la organización han contado «más de mil personas, a pocas decenas de alcanzar la cifra deseada». Una gesta que a primera hora de la tarde ya parecía difícil de conseguir, sobre todo cuando las propias concejalas Blanca Jiménez, Mayte Martínez y Mercedes Cantalapiedra han tenido que abordar a todos los viandantes que de forma curiosa se acercaban a la Plaza Mayor para tratar de unirlos a la melé.\nEduardo Téllez, comentarista en Movistar Plus, ha destacado que es una «pena» que no se haya podido conseguir, pero que no debe haber tristeza, sino estar contentos por la gran convocatoria que se ha conseguido y la gran visibilidad que se ha dado al rugby. «El año que viene lo volveremos a intentar, y se va a conseguir de manera holgada», ha finalizado.\nA pesar de no batir el récord, el buen ambiente ha sido el protagonista en la Plaza Mayor, India Pérez ha recalcado la importancia de estos eventos donde la ciudad se «vuelca» por dar valor a un deporte «noble» en el que reina el buen ambiente y el compañerismo. «Valladolid es la capital del rugby, no nos cansamos de repetirlo y nuestros equipos lo demuestran en cada partido», ha destacado.\nAarón García se mostraba entusiasmado por «batir este récord». Dos largas filas esperando para recoger el número alababan su optimismo, «creo que estaremos cerca de las 1.200 personas, aunque si no se consigue tampoco pasa nada, al final la cosa es este pedazo de ambiente que hay». Un optimismo que contrastaba con los setecientos participantes que vaticinaba Maca Valle, «aunque yo soy muy pesimista para estas cosas, pero me gusta ver como este deporte va haciendo 'cantera' entre todos los vallisoletanos. Que se vea que existe algo más que el fútbol. Y en esto encima somos muy buenos».\nNoticias relacionadas\nJ. C. Cristóbal\n«Valladolid es una ciudad que arropa este deporte», ha incidido Pedro Martínez. Quien asegura que los domingos de Pepe Rojo son un «obligatorio» en su casa y no solo por «el tercer tiempo». Pedro ha destacado que cuando era más pequeño dio alguna que otra carrera con el «balón ovalado» sobre sus manos y ver cómo ha evolucionado todo en Valladolid es «increíble».\nUna opinión que comparte Alonso Lucas, que se aficionó a este deporte cuando comenzó la universidad, «siempre he sido de El Salvador, yo hablaba en casa de unirme al equipo y recuerdo cómo mi madre no lo veía con buenos ojos, decía que esos eran unos brutos. Una opinión que gracias a dios ha cambiado y fíjate hasta donde hemos llegado. Me llegan a decir a mí con veinte años que iba a ver a los dos equipos de mi ciudad disputarse una final de Copa del Rey en un Estadio José Zorrilla a reventar y no me lo creo, guardo un maravilloso recuerdo de ese día, también que la ganaran 'mi Chami' tiene algo que ver, ojalá se repita este año», confesaba entre risas.\nAlonso también ha destacado el importante trabajo que se realiza desde hace años en los equipos de la ciudad, «es muy positivo para el rugby nacional ver como cada vez en los equipos hay menos extranjeros -también porque no hay dinero para grandes fichajes- como llegan a División de Honor jugadores criados en casa. Algo que luego se traduce en un equipo nacional muy fuerte y que justo este domingo tiene una gran cita para poder estar en el mundial de 2027 que nos los merecemos», ha concluido.\nSonia Bravo aseguraba que «abraza» este deporte por «la familia que se crea». Se trata de una competición «donde luego todos somos amigos y donde el tercer tiempo es casi tan importante como el partido, pero eso sí, hay que ganarse el tercer tiempo con una buena melé», ha incidido.\nTodo ello bajo el amparo del comienzo del campeonato de rugby más importante a nivel internacional -El Torneo de las Seis Naciones- donde se enfrentarán, desde este viernes mismo, Gales, Italia, Inglaterra, Francia, Escocia e Irlanda como la gran favorita, que además luchará por conseguir su tercer gran campeonato de manera consecutiva. Y así ha sido destacada entre los padrinos de esta convocatoria por otorgar a la ciudad de Valladolid un nuevo récord mundial. Quienes han destacado que Valladolid respira rugby y que si bien la ciudad «fue hace siglos la capital de España, ahora es la capital del pincho y del rugby».\n¿Ya eres suscriptor/a?

    "text": "La Confederazione boliviana degli autisti ha annunciato uno sciopero a tempo indeterminato a partire da lunedì prossimo a causa della presunta \"violazione\" da parte del governo degli accordi presi con il settore, in particolare per quanto riguarda il mancato licenziamento di due autorità e la regolarizzazione delle forniture di carburante.\n \"Finora non abbiamo ricevuto alcuna risposta dopo l'incontro con il governo in merito al carburante. Le file si stanno allungando molto e non ci sono risposte alle nostre lamentele contro il presidente dell'Amministrazione autostradale boliviana (Abc) e il viceministro della Tutela del consumatore\", ha affermato Víctor Tarqui, un rappresentante degli autisti, citato dal sito Visión 360.\n Il sindacato della categoria chiede le dimissioni del presidente dell'Abc, Marcel Claure, per presunta mancanza di manutenzione stradale in tutto il Paese. Il malcontento per il viceministro della Tutela del consumatore, Jorge Silva, è dovuto all'aumento dei prezzi dei pezzi di ricambio e di altri accessori per veicoli che, come i prezzi di quasi tutti i prodotti nel Paese, sono saliti alle stelle negli ultimi mesi.",

    "text": "There is some great news regarding the [injury of Philadelphia Eagles star A.J. Brown](https://clutchpoints.com/eagles-news-aj-brown-practice-sighting-good-news-injury-vs-jaguars) as he has [logged a full session of practice](https://x.com/FieldYates/status/1854655398487240729) Thursday, leading to being available Sunday, according to Field Yates of ESPN. The [Eagles wide receiver in Brown suffered an injury scare](https://clutchpoints.com/eagles-news-aj-brown-leaves-jaguars-knee-injury) last Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars, where he missed the entirety of the second half due to a knee injury. “Eagles WR A.J. Brown was a full participant in practice today,” Yates wrote on his X, formerly Twitter, account. “Another sign he'll suit up against the Cowboys after leaving last week's win early due to a knee issue.” This is no doubt encouraging to hear for fans of the team as the [Eagles take on the Dallas Cowboys](https://clutchpoints.com/eagles-vs-cowboys-predictions-pick-odds-spread-for-nfl-week-10-2024) in what is obviously a heated matchup between NFC East division rivals. Eagles' A.J. Brown looking to perform big against the Cowboys [Brown being ready for Week 10](https://clutchpoints.com/eagles-news-a-j-brown-avoids-serious-knee-injury-early-exit-jaguars) seemed to always be the expectation as NFL insider Jordan Schultz posted on his social media accounts Monday that the 27-year-old wide receiver [avoided serious injury.](https://x.com/Schultz_Report/status/1853430454747033673) “Sources: #Eagles WR A.J. Brown, who left Sunday’s game with a knee injury, avoided anything serious and is expected to be fine,” Schultz posted on his X account. The Ole Miss product returned to practice Wednesday as he recorded a limited session before being upgraded to a full practice Thursday. In a video by Dave Zangaro of NBC Philadelphia it showed the [star wide receiver going through drills](https://x.com/DZangaroNBCS/status/1854244003308261818), looking ready to make a huge impact for the Eagles. [Brown has only played](https://clutchpoints.com/eagles-news-aj-brown-gets-brutal-injury-downgrade-for-week-4) in five games this season for Philadelphia in what has been a time where he has battled injuries like earlier in the season with a hamstring ailment. So far this season, Brown has caught 23 catches to go along with 444 yards and three touchdowns, as he is averaging 19.3 yards per reception. At any rate, he looks to further boost an Eagles team that is currently 6-2, which puts them second in the NFC East right behind the Washington Commanders, who are 6-2.",
