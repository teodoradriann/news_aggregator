    "title": "Something Is Infecting Memes on X. It’s More Nefarious Than You Think.",
    "text": "If you’ve been on X lately, you’ve probably seen this but not even realized it: a clean-looking logo for an online crypto casino called Stake pasted onto a [poorly cropped](https://x.com/ylevi/status/1845857153757712413) and [low-res](https://x.com/PercThaGoat/status/1837586316596310485) meme or a video.\nFounded in 2017 by Australian entrepreneurs Ed Craven and Bijan Tehrani (but [ostensibly operated out of the small Caribbean nation of Curaçao](https://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/the-secret-australian-origins-of-the-world-s-biggest-crypto-casino-20211208-p59ftb.html)), Stake is a crypto gambling site worth more than $2.6 billion today. The company’s [most recent blog](https://stake.com/blog/september-casino-sports-betting-highlights-stats) post claims that over 1.2 billion bets were placed in September alone, and the [Financial Times reported](https://www.ft.com/content/2490279b-9c94-49a8-beff-cbd7c3307586) in 2023 that the company had roughly 600,000 regular users with 6 million registered accounts. Despite this, public perception of the site [seems overwhelmingly negative](https://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/the-secret-australian-origins-of-the-world-s-biggest-crypto-casino-20211208-p59ftb.html)—and much of its bad reputation comes from the viral marketing ploys the company uses to reel in new users.\nIts new watermarking scheme on X is an amorphous advertising campaign that ignores international borders and the gambling laws that exist within them. While it’s legally sketchy, it’s also morally dubious. Kids who just want to look at memes have become the targets of a casino’s ruse.\nThe company has a history of strange marketing gimmicks. In 2022, many Twitch streamers like [Canadian star xQc](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2023/07/15/kick-vs-twitch-inside-streamings-billion-dollar-death-match-xqc-amouranth-ed-craven-stake/?sh=5e12638e129f) were offered what seemed like an [infinite money glitch](https://slate.com/technology/2024/09/chase-atm-money-glitch-viral-tiktok-trend-fraud.html) to gamble freely on Stake as long as they streamed their slot binges, blackjack games, and [mini-games such as Plinko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGYk8iSwehM) while live; xQc [reportedly bet an estimated $685 million](https://gamerant.com/twitch-xqc-gambling-streams-half-billion-dollars-wagers/) on the site with the company’s help. This added to [Twitch’s eventual decision to ban Stake](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Prohibiting-Unsafe-Slots-Roulette-and-Dice-Gambling-Sites?language=en_US#:~:text=As%20such%2C%20starting%20October%2018th,periods%2C%20and%20age%20verification%20systems.) (among other gambling sites) from its platform soon after, citing the effects on its highly impressionable audience of Gen Z and Gen Alpha.\nIn response, Craven and Tehrani created Kick, a competitor streaming site, and tempted Twitch streamers with massive contracts to hop platforms and gamble freely. Now, more than a year later, xQc has reportedly bet [more than $2.9 billion](https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-xqc-reveals-wagered-2-9-billion-gambling-stake) on Stake while livestreaming on Kick. (He’s openly admitted to having [a gambling addiction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H0rpa66zCE) in the past.) Stake may be shameless about using its Kick stars to promote gambling, but its marketing strategies are not isolated to their Twitch knockoff.\nStake and Kick thus work in tandem, generating a slew of free marketing that spreads well outside their sites’ limits. But Stake’s latest tactic involves paying X accounts to watermark its logo on any and all posts they make.\nLet’s say you make a meme, and you post it on your Instagram. It gets screenshotted and reposted by casual meme spreaders. Eventually, there’s a chance it winds up in the photo gallery of a Stake employee, where your content becomes an ad for the company. Nothing is removed. Only a logo is added. It’s then posted by an X account which has Stake tagged in its bio. It goes viral, giving the company tons of eyeballs on their logo. Rinse and repeat.\nPatient zero for this ad experiment [appears to be](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/stake-ads-on-twitter-x) X user [@FearedBuck](https://x.com/FearedBuck), who started as a Milwaukee Bucks fan account but later pivoted to posting Kick clips full time. In August, Stake logos [began showing up](https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/1820905715562692949) on the account’s videos. The page has since amassed more than 645,000 followers—up from [64,000 last December](https://archive.ph/Z1OBQ).\nViewers, [seemingly tired](https://x.com/HUN2R/status/1821335625926099265) of the account’s engagement-baiting antics and appalled by the obvious money grab, [Community Noted](https://x.com/i/birdwatch/n/1821553142112153832) all of @FearedBuck’s Stake-sponsored posts, explaining that the user was violating X’s guidelines on undisclosed promotions as well as violating the [Federal Trade Commission’s guidelines](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/disclosures-101-social-media-influencers) on gambling advertisements.\nAs quickly as it started, @FearedBuck went full-stop on the Stake logos. But other accounts have since stepped in, all of which mostly post Kick clips. The only thing that’s changed is that the Stake watermarks now have clarifying text, often reading “[Gamble Responsibly](https://x.com/picsthatg0hard_/status/1841577646100013388)” or “[This Is An #Ad](https://x.com/CFC_Janty/status/1827428302593589495),” in addition.\nThe additional declaration may swerve X’s guidelines but it doesn’t bypass the U.K.’s Advertising Standards Authority, which has [reportedly begun monitoring](https://insidersport.com/2024/10/11/asa-stake-watermarks-social-media/) Stake’s X campaign. The ASA has[ already taken action](https://insidersport.com/2023/10/18/sky-bet-neville-gaming-advertising/) against Sky Bet (a similar gambling site) from when ex-footballer Gary Neville watermarked the Sky Bet logo in a video.\nStake has landed in hot water for its advertising before. Back in August, the Dutch Gaming Authority [ordered the removal](https://insidersport.com/2024/08/21/formula-one-ordered-to-remove-stake/) of Stake logos from its sponsored Formula 1 cars, again citing influence on minors. Stake is not legal in the Netherlands and the ads (on a car, being televised) could not simply be geoblocked based on a user’s IP address.\nNow they’ve made the jump to sponsoring meme pages, believing they can take the same tack: plaster your company logo on everything—like a player’s jersey or a stadium wall—and let the constant exposure become brand awareness. But memes and internet chatter are inherently organic and communal, which makes it much more egregious when they try this approach.\nTake [this one](https://x.com/PercThaGoat/status/1841603758985195639) between two X accounts, [@PercThaGoat](https://x.com/PercThaGoat) and [@KillaMinga](https://x.com/KillaMinga), that both have Stake tagged in their bios. The latter shared a video of artwork with a Stake watermark. The subsequent quote tweet attested, “Average coworker phone wallpaper,” receiving over 28,000 likes.\nThe only problem: This is an elaborate two-part copycat that blatantly plagiarized the exact contents of [earlier X posts that happened](https://x.com/sparrows_honor/status/1741313879425053026) months before. The copycat post banks on the proven virality of its parts and the fact that many users haven’t seen the original posts yet.\nEver since Elon Musk [instated Twitter Blue](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/technology/elon-musk-twitter-blue.html), money grabs from blue-check accounts have become commonplace. A [“rent due” tweet](https://x.com/gayest_tone/status/1753168070372159622) has [become an axiom](https://x.com/byetyler/status/1848472819358654698) explaining the constant lewd shock-and-outrage bait that floods most of the timeline. To combat the onslaught, the site’s Community Notes feature acts as the law—but it’s an illusion of control. Individuals like @FearedBuck may have stopped posting Stake ads, but their original promotional posts [were never removed](https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/1820944327989690701) from the site entirely.\nIt’s well-known that [Musk is struggling with advertisers](https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/elon-musk-x-twitter-advertisers-antisemitic-post-spending-go-f-yourself-1235813657/), and although he’s promised to [remove the bots](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/10/elon-musk-bots-x-users-have-to-foot-the-bill), he’s seemingly too addicted to the site’s engagement numbers to fully delete anything that’s going viral (unless [it challenges his right-wing dogma](https://x.com/esjesjesj/status/1845523107978830035)). While we can’t say that Stake is paying off Twitter, it’s obvious that Twitter’s turning a blind eye.\nAnother more drastic solution would be for the government to step in and do something about it. Stake is illegal in America. To work around this, Stake created [Stake.us](http://stake.us), which operates as a sweepstakes casino, meaning there’s no real money being bet. It’s all pretend money (tokens), and when an American opens the Stake homepage, it urges them to redirect to its legal stateside alternative where no real money can be wagered.\nBecause of this redirection, Stake has managed to abide by the FTC’s guidelines. However, if one views memes as a piece of media with disproportionately high influence on young minds, then the legality of Stake’s watermark campaign is much more murky.\nThis all depends on the viewpoint of FTC Chair Lina Khan, who is reportedly [more anti-business than many Democratic Party donors are comfortable with](https://www.wired.com/story/ftc-chair-lina-khans-democrats-donors-harris/). However, in an upcoming Trump presidency, the new FTC elect will likely be from the same talent pool as an [axe-throwing Fox News hos](https://www.tmz.com/2024/11/13/pete-hegseth-hits-bystander-with-axe-resurfaced-fox-news-clip/)t or even [Elon Musk himself](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/trump-appoints-elon-musk-government-efficiency-department). With a Stake logo on many of his website’s viral posts, maybe [the Phantom of Mar-a-Lago](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-elon-musk-maralago-florida-b2645385.html) and his host will never appoint someone anti-business enough to throw the hammer down soon.\nMeanwhile, the conveyor belt of repackaging viral internet media and moments to advertise for a crypto casino keeps rolling. The watermarked Stake meme gets screenshotted and passed on, where it spreads through successive channels—like when publications that need to embed Twitter videos [become complicit in Stake’s amorphous campaign](https://www.dexerto.com/kick/n3on-banned-on-kick-after-guest-threatens-multiple-streamers-2954811/).\nMeme creators who have [taken notice of the Stake watermarks](https://x.com/Mlickles/status/1837951358198337760) have begun parodying the campaign by [adding excessive amounts](https://x.com/NintendoGCN/status/1838308628706791660) of Stake logos to their own memes or pretending they’re instead [sponsored by Dave & Buster’s](https://x.com/M1das_OW2/status/1838263159339258265). The collective shaming [has built a grassroots rebellion](https://x.com/idiotpeach/status/1837855478145339616) but—like Community Notes—it doesn’t seem to be producing real-world effects.\nHope is not lost, though. While marketing gambling to minors across international borders might be an actual crime, it’s well understood what the real crime is in the eyes of an irony-poisoned, meme-consuming council: being cringe. As long as this public perception remains and compounds with Stake’s already shady reputation, then the brainwashing might fall flat.",

    "text": "Living\n31 Workers Rescued After Los Angeles Tunnel Collapse\nMore than two dozen workers have been safely rescued after a tunnel collapsed in Los Angeles, according to The Independent.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) reported that a total of 31 workers were rescued in the late hours of July 9 after an industrial tunnel collapsed in the city of Wilmington. \"Thirty-one persons, all believed to be tunnel workers, have been safely removed from the tunnel alive without visible injury,\" the update read. \"None are missing.\"\nThe collapse occurred at a \"horizontal excavation site\" located underground and \"about five to six miles south of the sole entry/rescue access portal.\" The tunnel, intended \"for municipal wastewater management,\" was in the process of being built when the catastrophe occurred. The initial collapse reportedly separated the workers into two factions, with one group of four having to climb over piles of loose soil, which were between 12 and 15 feet high, in order to reach the other 27 victims.\nThe successful operation required more than 100 LAFD workers on the scene, including some with special experience in rescuing people from confined spaces. Footage captured by ABC7 shows the workers being lifted out of the tunnel.\n\"LAFD has just reported that all workers who were trapped in the tunnel in Wilmington are now out and accounted for,\" L.A. Mayor Karen Brass wrote on X. \"I just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped. Thank you to all of our brave first responders who acted immediately. You are L.A.'s true heroes.\"\nRelated: Why Glen Powell's 'Running Man' Role 'Worries' His Mom\n31 Workers Rescued After Los Angeles Tunnel Collapse first appeared on Men's Journal on Jul 10, 2025\n2025 The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.

The issue is the will to do it.” “We actually have 967 evictions filed in July. A lot of people talked about how do we solve homelessness. How do we solve homelessness? There's a direct correlation between our rising rents and the rent and rates of homelessness,” said Sasha Rose from Austin Mutual Aid. “We really need to prioritize our housing and our vulnerable communities in Austin and investing more money into APD isn't going to do that. investing money into our housing Rapid Rehousing, permanent supportive housing, rent relief.” City manager T [C Broadnax arrived in Austin](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/story/lone-finalist-for-austin-city-manager-job-offers-views-on-homelessness-police-oversight) with some success tackling homelessness in Dallas. The NPR station in north Texas reports there were 3,718 people experiencing homelessness in Dallas and Collin counties on a count conducted in January of this year – that’s down 19% from 2021. [ALSO| Five years since El Paso shooting, border \"invasion\" claims have pervaded](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/five-years-since-el-paso-shooting-border-invasion-claims-have-pervaded) Thursday however, on the city council budget question board, there were more than a dozen questions about homelessness and affordable housing most still not answered. Among those that are answered – what is the projected gap in permanent supportive housing? The answer: $4.2 million. And how much funding is going to emergency shelters? The answer is more than $26 million, with fourteen million coming from the general fund. “ I thought it might be helpful if on Tuesday, we had a dedicated briefing on our homelessness response system, particularly want to dig into the details around permanent supportive housing, Rapid Rehousing preventative services, and a couple of other areas,” said Council Member Vanessa Fuentes The city council is expected to vote on the budget on August 14.",

    "text": "Not many months ago I needed a fairly major surgery.\nMy healing and general progress has been a combination of great medical care and that of a loving and diligent family. Through it all, from the most uncomfortable moments to date, God has been with me growing my faith.\nI would have preferred a quick healing, yet God had something more important to do in my life than simply physical healing. He gave birth to a vision over and over the same words and teaching concerning the location of the \"ark of the covenant.\"\nSearching to find this historic and magnificent item, history records show that the Roman empire in 70 A.D. entered Jerusalem and sacked the most sacred place, the Temple. Taking what they found of worth, they never found the ark.\nSo, one might rightly ask, \"So where is the ark of the covenant?\"\nThis is where my vision began also. Eventually it was revealed to me that on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the apostles and other believers, each believer was filled with the Holy Spirit.\nMany signs and wonders are recorded in the New Testament. Many came to faith on that day and the \"church\" of Jesus was born.\nMy simple conclusion is this: Every born-again Christian believer is indwelt by that same magnificent person we call the Holy Spirit, third person of the \"Triune God head: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\"\nEach born-again believer is endowed (sealed) with the same Holy Spirit, which in biblical times was often referred to as \"the presence.\" The tabernacle as well as the ark of the covenant were believed to contain the very presence of God.\nEach of the elements of the \"tabernacle\" declared the very presence of the one true and only God.\nThe table of showbread: 12 loaves representing the 12 tribes. The large curtain that separated the holy place from the most holy place, which housed the actual \"ark\" of the covenant (you all have seen the movie, right?) in which were certain articles such as the 10 commandments (Mount Sinai), some of the manna which God provided in the desert, Aaron’s rod that budded.\nThe history of Gods’ deliverance after the fall, out of the garden into an abundant land, once again needed to be addressed. How about a great worldwide flood, the years wandering around in the desert only to end up as slaves in Egypt only to miraculously escape to raging waters and end up on Mount Sinai.\nTen commandments were given, and the Aaronic priesthood was established. The sacred nation began to take form and yet sin and disobedience continued.\nThe original ark was constructed, captured and returned. There is much more to say but the essence of my vision is this.\nThere may be an ark of the covenant somewhere, but it matters little for God has established this same presence within each believer. We must adjust to this new reality.\nConclusion: Every born-again believer is indwelt by the \"presence\" of God. The Bible refers to this third person as the Holy Spirit so that wherever this person goes God goes with him.\nWe each have become like \"little arks\" of the presence. As the tabernacle contained the ark of the covenant, i.e. the very presence of God, so we as born-again believers in Jesus carry this same presence (person) with us.\nThe presence comes with us. The church building where we go each Sunday morning depends on believers to bring the presence to the place we meet. We each are like mini arks bringing the presence to our sacred gatherings.\nThe Rev. Patrick Serna is the lead pastor of Highway International Christian Fellowship ...

    "text": "Interesante carta la del lector Arturo Garvich (28/03), la cual se agradece –por cierto– ya que denota trabajo, investigación y organización de las ideas y párrafos. La mirada que de los judíos tenían los católicos apostólicos romanos (cuya Santa Inquisición persiguió y asesinó a millones de judíos por todo el mundo) no solo fue mejorada durante las últimas cinco décadas desde los altares y homilías, sino incluso desde la mismísima figura de la máxima autoridad de la Iglesia. Francisco y su posición geopolítica, es un claro ejemplo. Juan Pablo II también, muy bien explicado en el libro “El Papa oculto” de Darcy O’Brien. No obstante, sigo lamentando que la Iglesia se haya convertido en un gran negocio (desde las indulgencias recaudatorias medievales, pasando por eventos religiosos para limpiar la imagen de algún corrupto o de algún dictador, hasta las actuales indulgencias plenarias, según la cara y el aporte del arrepentido) y que la historia borrara la real figura de aquel Jesús revolucionario y disruptivo, que abrazaba al ser humano por el ser mismo; que colocaba en igualdad de condiciones a la mujer y al hombre, convirtiéndose -de ese modo- en enemigo del patriarcado vigente hasta este Siglo XXI. Es ese Jesús el que se debe resucitar en nuestras mentes, corazones y acciones; después de todo, de eso se trata la Pascua: de resucitar nuestra capacidad de saber repartir lo mucho que se nos dio.

    "text": "Recortes públicos\nMilei premia con mejoras salariales a los altos cargos de la Administración que despidan a más funcionarios\nLa \"motosierra\" del Gobierno de ultraderecha ya ha dejado en la calle a 43.778 trabajadores estatales desde diciembre de 2023\nEl Gobierno de ultraderecha de Argentina ha decidido premiar con mejoras salariales a los jefes de las dependencias estatales que se desprendan de más empleados públicos en 2025. El premio se aplicará las \"autoridades superiores incorporadas al régimen de Gabinete de Asesores\". Los \"suplementos extraordinarios\" serán otorgados a los funcionarios que mejoren sus \"objetivos de productividad\", y uno de ellos es la reducción al \"mínimo\" de las estructuras públicas. La medida busca dar continuidad y contundencia a lo que el presidente Javier Milei ha denominado \"el ajuste más grande de la historia\", resumido en la imagen de la \"motosierra\". La Asociación de Trabajadores del Estado (ATE) expresó su indignación y decidió movilizarse en las calles de Buenos Aires. \"Es una decisión escandalosa\", dijo el sindicato. \"Se trata de un incentivo económico para el despido de trabajadores\".\nDaniel Catalano, un dirigente de la ATE de la ciudad de Buenos Aires, advirtió que miles de familias se quedarán en la calle. \"Miren lo que hacen con el dinero de los despidos en la Administración Nacional, le subirán el salario a las 'autoridades superiores' y dejarán vacías áreas enteras de atención a la población. La plata es para sus bolsillos y no los contribuyentes\". Rodolfo Aguiar, del mismo sindicato, también repudió el anuncio. \"De verdad que ahora van a cobrar por despedir? Al final este no es más que un Gobierno de mercenarios. El salariazo es solo para los funcionarios que luego de haber hecho el trabajo sucio, destrozado el Estado y provocado la cesantía a miles de estatales, recibirán la recompensa\".\nEl proyecto diseñado por el Ministerio de Desregulación y Transformación del Estado, a cargo de Federico Sturzenegger, se conoce en un momento de tensión en la Administración pública debido a que a fin de marzo vencen 50.000 contratos laborales. Sturzenegger calcula que el gasto estatal se ha reducido en 4.012 millones de dólares y quiere ir a por más. La ATE advirtió que se busca eliminar el régimen de estabilidad laboral en el Estado que está garantizado en la Constitución Nacional.\nMiles de despidos en 2024\nLa \"motosierra\" es para Milei un instrumento de disciplina económica y social que se ha convertido en emblema al punto de regalarle a Elon Musk una réplica metálica para que aplique en Estados Unidos la misma receta argentina que tiene cifras concretas: entre diciembre de 2023 y enero de 2025 han sido despedidos 43.778 trabajadores estatales, según el Centro de Economía Política Argentina (CEPA). El Hospital Bonaparte, especializado en salud mental, perdió al 51,7% de su fuerza laboral, mientras que fue destituido el 47,6% del personal del Instituto Nacional de Cine y Artes Audiovisuales (INCAA:). En el Polo Tecnológico, un 40% de los empleados perdieron sus puestos.\nEl \"mayor ajuste de la historia\" no solo tiene consecuencias contables. Las sucesivas olas de despidos han impactado en el funcionamiento de numerosos organismos del Estado. Tras el reciente desastre climático en la ciudad bonaerense de Bahía Blanca, que quedó en buena parte inundada, la ministra de Seguridad, Patricia Bullrich, dijo que el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) emitió tarde su alerta cuando ya habían caído 200 milímetros de agua desde el cielo.\nDistintas fuentes del organismo rechazaron de plano la acusación de la ministra que expresa las posiciones más duras de la Administración de ultraderecha. A la vez recordaron que en el SMN no solo se ha prohibido usar palabras como \"cambio climático\" y \"calentamiento global\" en sus publicaciones. Ha comenzado una \"caza de brujas\" de aquellos que se resisten al negacionismo oficial. El SMN ha sido uno de los primeros blancos de la \"motosierra\". Cuando Milei tomó posesión, el 10 de diciembre de 2023, contaba con 1.162 empleados. Lo primero que hicieron las nuevas autoridades fue recortar los contratos de la mitad de su personal que, además, fue sometido a exámenes de idoneidad que nada tenían que ver con la meteorología. Debieron responder sobre sus conocimientos matemáticos.\nRRSS WhatsApp\nRRSS Facebook\nRRSS Twitter\nRRSS email\nCopiar URL)\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil",
