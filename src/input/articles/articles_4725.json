    "text": "Le camion à pizza a été victime d'un incendie le 4 juin dernier. Le gérant, déjà victime de vols et effractions, soupçonne un nouvel acte criminel. Sept ans de travail partis en fumée. Le camion de la \"Pause pizza\", bien connu des habitants de la rue Bottero à Nice , a été victime d'un incendie le 4 juin dernier. En quelques minutes, un épais nuage de fumée s'est propagé, et les riverains ont appelé les pompiers.\nLes flammes sont parties de l'avant du véhicule, à l'opposé des fours à pizza. Une vingtaine de jours plus tard, le gérant ne s'explique toujours pas ce départ de feu. \"Tout était coupé, j'avais vérifié. Ça faisait deux jours que je n'avais pas travaillé\", assure Joaquim, le gérant, au micro de BFM Nice Côte d'Azur.\n\"Je ne peux plus avancer\" Déjà victime de plusieurs effractions et vols, dont le dernier remonte à deux mois, le gérant soupçonne à nouveau un acte criminel.\n\"Certainement qu'on m'a forcé le camion, parce que c’était pas la première fois. En un an, on me l’a ouvert plusieurs fois\", indique-t-il. Il avait d'ailleurs fait installer une caméra de surveillance, qui n'a visiblement pas dissuadé les éventuels malfaiteurs. Joaquim attend désormais l'ouverture de l'enquête, un processus qui prend du temps.\n\"Je ne pensais pas que ça mettait aussi longtemps. Déjà, il faut qu’ils viennent, qu’il l’enlève (le camion) pour faire l’expertise dessus, voir si c’est criminel ou pas. Là, de toute manière, je ne peux plus avancer.\"\nÉtabli dans le quartier depuis sept ans, Joaquim ne souhaite désormais plus rester dans le secteur. Attristés du sort du camion à pizzas, les riverains ont quant à eux décidé d'apporter leur aide au pizzaïolo.\n\"Il a tout perdu: plus de travail, plus de revenus, il faut repartir à zéro, et là c’est compliqué\", déclare l'un d'entre eux.\nUne cagnotte en ligne a été lancée et a déjà récolté plus de 1.400 euros. Plus de 200 affiches ont également été collées dans le quartier pour faire connaître cette cagnotte.\nKelly Vargin, Corentin Marabeuf avec Laurène Rocheteau Les plus lus\nGrand oral du bac 2024: de l'or sur Mars, du basilic contre l'hypertension... des profs nous racontent leurs pépites",

    "title": "North Atlantic Right Whale Spotted Off Irish Coast for First Time in More Than a Century",
    "text": "For the first time in over a century, a North Atlantic right whale — a critically endangered species with only about 360 individuals remaining — has been seen off the Irish coast. Adrian Maguire , on vacation from Northern Ireland’s County Tyrone, saw the whale’s enormous figure as he fished for mackerel in a boat with his wife and a couple of friends, reported The Guardian. “I just looked in amazement at the size of it,” Maguire said. “I’ve never experienced that in my life.” Macguire described letting the boat drift as they watched for about an hour while the whale swam and surfaced in McSwynes Bay off Ireland’s northwest coast. “The sound of the blowing – it’s great to hear that in real life,” Maguire said, as The Guardian reported. Conor Ryan, a Scottish Association for Marine Science research fellow, said it was the first North Atlantic right whale sighting off the coast of Ireland in 114 years. “I was very sceptical at first because it’s such an unbelievable occurrence,” Ryan said. North Atlantic right whales — which can grow to more than 52 feet long — are normally found off North America’s east coast. Photos taken by Maguire’s party left Ryan and colleagues unsure of the species of whale at first, but after watching video footage, they knew it was a North Atlantic right whale from the cetacean’s crusty white callosities — skin that had been damaged by whale lice. “There’s no other whale in the North Atlantic with that,” Ryan explained, adding that sightings of the species in Europe are extremely unusual. The majestic whales were once commonly found in European waters, but whaling decimated their populations centuries ago. The sighting was confirmed as a North Atlantic right whale by the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group (IWDG), who said there aren’t many whales who frequent Irish waters. “The thing about whales in Ireland, in common with most places around the globe, is that there will only be a relatively short list of ‘usual suspects’ in any one area,” a press release from IWDG said. “[I]n Irish coastal waters, the only whale that routinely lifts its tail clear of the water before a deep dive, is the humpback whale , and this clearly was no humpback. So not only could we rule out this species, but along with the humpback, we could eliminate minke, fin and sei whales, who simply don’t tail fluke.” Illustration of a North Atlantic right whale. William Helps / Irish Whale and Dolphin Group IWDG sightings officer Pádraig Whooley contacted the New England Aquarium in Boston, which keeps track of known individuals of the species, reported The Guardian. Whooley said the aquarium was in the process of trying to identify which particular whale was observed off County Donegal from footage of its markings. According to IWDG, the survival outlook for this critically endangered species is fragile, as each year entanglement in fishing gear and ship strikes kill individuals from their dwindling population. Ryan said the current rate of North Atlantic Right whale deaths is too high for them to recover, The Guardian reported. However, while Ryan didn’t anticipate the species would “make a comeback” in Irish waters in the near future, he said the sighting was “a glimmer of hope.” IWDG advised caution for anyone going in search of the rare visitor. “As always we ask wildlife and whale enthusiasts who’d like to visit the area with a view to seeing this animal to look for it and watch it from the shore using optics. North Atlantic Right whales are most susceptible to ship strike and even a collision with a small vessel can have fatal consequences for the individual and a significant impact at population level. There is an enormous onus on us all to ensure this whale remains as long as it needs in Donegal bay, where it’s most likely feeding on tiny copepods, without having to run the gauntlet of small craft and sightseers,” IWDG said in the press release. “This is our chance to help a population of whales on the very brink.

    "title": "Rate Cuts Coming? New Poll Projects When",
    "text": "About 60%, or 68 out of 116, said they expect two rate cuts in 2024. These results are both similar to those from the same Reuters poll conducted last month. However, fewer economists now expect the Fed to take action at its July meeting. In the May poll, 11 out of 116 economists predicted that the first rate cut would come in July; in this new survey, only five economists, or about 4%, called for the first cut in July. Not a single respondent thought the next interest-rate reduction would come at the June 11-12 meeting next week. Good data needed This should not come as a surprise to most investors even though the last Fed “dot plot,” or summary of projections, in March suggested that there would be three rate cuts. Of course, that was before inflation rates ticked up in March. Based on statements by Fed officials over the past two months, it seems clear that they probably won’t act until inflation rates trend lower toward their 2% target. Most recently, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he would need to see several months of good inflation data to warrant action. “The economy now seems to be evolving closer to what the Committee expected,” Waller said on May 21. “Nevertheless, in the absence of a significant weakening in the labor market, I need to see several more months of good inflation data before I would be comfortable supporting an easing in the stance of monetary policy. What do I mean by good data? What grade do I need to give future inflation reports? I will keep that to myself for now, but let’s say that I look forward to the day when I don’t have to go out two or three decimal places in the monthly inflation data to find the good news.” Next dot plot coming soon The Federal Reserve is due to release its next dot-plot projections later this month. Based on the recent commentary, it will be surprising if the consensus among the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) doesn’t call for only two rate reductions this year — or fewer. Going back to the Reuters poll, some 28% of economists, or 33 of 116, said they expect just one rate cut in 2024. Additionally, just 13%, or 15 of 116, expect more than two rate reductions this year.",
