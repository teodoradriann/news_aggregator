    "title": "Boeing Urges 737 MAX Inspections for Possible Loose Bolt",
    "text": "Thursday, 28 December 2023 06:12 PM EST Airplane maker Boeing is urging airlines to inspect 737 MAX airplanes for a possible loose bolt in the rudder control system, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Thursday. The FAA said it was closely monitoring Boeing 737 MAX targeted inspections and will consider additional action based on any further discovery of loose or missing hardware. Boeing recommended inspections after an international operator discovered a bolt with a missing nut while performing routine maintenance on a mechanism in the rudder-control linkage, the FAA said. Boeing discovered an additional undelivered aircraft with a nut not properly tightened, the agency said. \"The issue identified on the particular airplane has been remedied,\" Boeing said. \"Out of an abundance of caution, we are recommending operators inspect their 737 MAX airplanes and inform us of any findings. We informed the FAA and our customers and will continue to keep them aware of the progress.\" The planemaker has recommended that airlines inspect their MAXs within two weeks, but delivered 737 MAX planes can continue to fly safely, Boeing said. Production and delivery of the MAX will continue. The issue does not affect older-model 737 Next Generation planes, Boeing said. Boeing shares were down 1% in midday trade. United Airlines American Airlines, two major domestic customers of the MAX, each said it did not expect inspections to have an impact on operations. Southwest Airlines, a U.S. carrier that solely flies the 737 NG and MAX, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FAA said Boeing had issued a message urging operators of newer single-aisle airplanes to inspect specific tie rods that control rudder movement for possible loose hardware. The rudder controls the position of an aircraft's nose while in flight. The inspections involve taking off an access panel and validating that the hardware had been properly installed, Boeing said. The process should take two hours, and Boeing is inspecting undelivered 737 MAX aircraft before handing them over to customers. \"The FAA will remain in contact with Boeing and the airlines while the inspections are under way,\" the agency said, asking airlines to answer if any loose hardware has been detected previously and provide details on how quickly these inspections can be completed. Any issue involving a rudder that is not working properly would likely be identified in a pre-flight check, as flight crews routinely examine the rudder system before an aircraft pushes back from the gate, Boeing said. The inspections will help the FAA determine how prevalent the problem is and whether it is a sign of a larger lapse in production quality that requires the regulator to take further action, said Anthony Brickhouse, an air safety expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. \"Airlines need to take it seriously,\" he said. \"But as a member of the flying public, I don't see this as an issue to be concerned about.\" The 737 MAX was grounded for 20 months worldwide after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia. Boeing is still awaiting certification of its smaller 737 MAX 7 and larger MAX 10. The FAA has carefully scrutinized the MAX. The FAA in 2021 said it was tracking all 737 MAX airplanes using satellite data. © 2023 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved. Receive breaking news and original analysis - sent right to your inbox.

    "title": "Xbox Game Pass Losing 7 Games Today",
    "text": "Key Takeaways - Xbox Game Pass is losing seven titles on November 15. - The forthcoming departures include two Like a Dragon games—Ishin and The Man Who Erased His Name—and Persona 5 Tactica, making this rotation particularly disappointing for RPG fans. Xbox Game Pass is losing Dicey Dungeons and six other titles later today, November 15. This wave of departures may be particularly disappointing to RPG fans with an [Xbox Game Pass](https://gamerant.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/) subscription. Microsoft's subscription service removed 15 games in September, which was its busiest month of 2024 in terms of departures. Another 10 titles left its content catalog over the course of October. Most recently, [Xbox Game Pass lost Headbangers: Rhythm Royale](https://gamerant.com/xbox-game-pass-games-leaving-october-2024-lonely-mountains-downhill/) and four other games on October 31. [Related1:47 ](/xbox-game-pass-november-2024-games-spyro-reignited-trilogy-announcement/) [ Xbox Game Pass Confirms Arrival of Beloved Trilogy ](/xbox-game-pass-november-2024-games-spyro-reignited-trilogy-announcement/) Xbox Game Pass confirms the arrival of a widely beloved trilogy that some vocal fans have been requesting for over a year by now. Seven more titles are now set to join them in a matter of hours. These [November 15 Xbox Game Pass departures](https://gamerant.com/xbox-game-pass-games-leaving-november-2024-wave-1-persona/) include two popular JRPGs, Like a Dragon: Ishin and Like a Dragon: The Man Who Erased His Name, as well as Atlus's SRPG Persona 5 Tactica. Goat Simulator, Dicey Dungeons, Dungeons 4, and Somerville are also being removed from the XGP catalog as part of the forthcoming rotation. Xbox Game Pass Games Leaving November 15, 2024 Game | Platform(s) | Added | OpenCritic Avg. | How Long To Beat | ---|---|---|---|---| Dicey Dungeons | Cloud, Console, PC | Nov 2021 | 82 | 26–54 hours | Dungeons 4 | Nov 2023 | 78 | 25–35 hours | | Goat Simulator | PC | Apr 2023 | 60 | 2–11 hours | Like a Dragon: Ishin! | Cloud, Console, PC | Oct 2023 | 81 | 23–124 hours | Like a Dragon: The Man Who Erased His Name | Nov 2023 | 80 | 12–32 hours | | Persona 5 Tactica | 78 | 24–38 hours | || Somerville | Nov 2022 | 69 | 3–4 hours | Goat Simulator can be characterized as the smallest loss for Microsoft's subscription service out of this entire group. Not because it's not a fun game, but mainly due to the fact that [Goat Simulator Remastered just made its way to Xbox Game Pass](https://gamerant.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-november-2024-games-goat-simulator-remastered/) on November 7. Granted, the original was available across all non-Core tiers of the service, whereas its recently debuted remaster is exclusive to PC Game Pass and XGP Ultimate, on account of being a day-one release. Most of the soon-to-be-departing titles aren't feasibly beatable in an afternoon. The sole exception is Somerville, as Jumpship's 2022 adventure offers roughly three hours' worth of content. Trophy hunters hence still have enough time to unlock [all 11 Somerville achievements](https://gamerant.com/video/somerville-complete-achievement-guide-all-collectibles-endings/) worth 1,000 Gamerscore points before this indie experience leaves Xbox Game Pass. As for when exactly that's going to happen, Microsoft never specifies exact removal times in advance, but most titles tend to get rotated out of its subscription content catalog around midnight local time. The second wave of this month's Xbox Game Pass departures is expected to take place on November 30. Its full list of titles should be officially announced in the coming days, along with the second wave of November 2024 arrivals. These are already known to include Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, which are planned to be made available to PC Game Pass and XGP Ultimate members on November 19 and 20, respectively. They will be followed by Red Candle Games' metroidvania Nine Sols on November 26. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is the highest tier of Microsoft's flagship game subscription service that offers over 100 game titles that you can play with a single purchase, making it one of the most outstanding value propositions of the Xbox ecosystem to date.",

Regular consumption of fried and heavily buttered potatoes can lead to weight gain.\nHigh Blood Sugar\nThis starchy root vegetable has a high glycemic index, which can cause a rapid increase in blood sugar levels. It may complicate blood sugar management and is concerning for individuals with diabetes.\nDigestive Issues\nEating potatoes regularly can lead to digestive discomfort, including bloating and gas. The presence of resistant starch in raw potatoes ferments in the large intestine and causes gastrointestinal symptoms.\nNutritional Imbalance\nPotatoes do not offer a complete nutritional profile. Relying on the vegetable as a staple food may lead to lack of dietary diversity.\nRisk Of Toxicity\nConsuming damaged or improperly stored potatoes can expose individuals to toxic compounds like solanine and acrylamide. They can cause symptoms like headaches, nausea and digestive issues.\nImage: Pexels\nNEXT: Eating Too Quickly? Here’s How It Impacts Your Digestion And Health",
