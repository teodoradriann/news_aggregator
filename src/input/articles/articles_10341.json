    "text": "The 10 brand new train lines being in Europe set to change the game for tourism (Image: GETTY - STOCK) The EU has outlined plans to welcome 10 brand new train lines that will criss-cross the continent. The bloc's transport department, EU Transport, has outlined the new ongoing projects to \"improve cross-border rail\" and offer “new and better connections” for Europeans.\nWhile the lines will primarily cross countries within the EU27, they will also stretch outside, taking people to other nations in Eastern Europe and within the European Economic Area (EEA).\nOfficials expect they will provide a tourism boom as the bloc celebrates a bumper 2023. And, despite Brexit , even Britons can expect to take advantage of the new projects.\nEach project is managed by national governments in more than a dozen countries, which were selected to receive support from the European Commission in January this year.\nREAD MORE: Russia follows lead of EU in bizarre move as it copies bloc's visa rules\nThe 10 new lines are being put together by the following organisations and will cover the following routes:\nHungarian Ministry of Transport: Hungary, Austria and Romania Connection Germany: Denmark to Sweden Midnight Trains: Night train from Paris to Milan and Venice Flixtrain: Munich – Zurich; WESTbahn: Munich to Vienna and Budapest Nederlandse Spoorwegen + Eurostar: Enhanced Amsterdam to London service European Sleeper: Night train from Amsterdam to Barcelona Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane + Deutsche Bahn,: Rome to Munich and Milan to Munich - possible extension to Berlin ILSA: Lisbon to A Coruña and Lisbon to Madrid Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya: Catalonia and the South of France Don't miss...\nMap shows incredible new transport routes across Europe - but UK misses out [MAP]\nEU told to scrap harmful Green Deal in favour of ‘dynamic’ new strategy [INSIGHT]\nCanada sparks British outrage after rejecting post-Brexit trade agreement [REPORT]\nThe EU Commission shared a map of the new routes (Image: EU COMMISSION) Trending\n The new network has excited Europeans, and two lines in particular have been deemed of special interest to Britons.\nMark Smith, the train expert known by his X account, the Man in Seat 61, said the Paris-Milan-Venice and Amsterdam-Brussels-Barcelona night trains will likely prove especially useful for British tourists.\nPosting on the site, he said the lines would be \"of direct interest to UK travellers\". Adina Vălean, the European Commissioner for Transport, hailed the project as vital for the rail market and cross-border journeys.\nThe links will likely bring more activity to the EU at a bumper time for the bloc, which has seen a surge in tourism over the last year.\nAccording to figures released by the EU Commission in September, 193 million people spent the night in tourist accommodation in the first half of 2023, an increase of 11 million compared to the same period in 2019.\nRelated articles Beautiful European ghost town where each house has been gobbled up by trees Spain fuming at 90-day cap on Britons days after France rebels against EU rule EU’s Grinch-like plans to hit UK firms with new requirement for ‘toy passports' EU rebellion brews as overwhelmed Canary Islands hit out at migration deal EU fears over Cold War confirmed as Putin no longer a 'short-term problem'",

    "text": "6 Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? And not one of them is forgotten before God. 7 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. When was the last time you bothered to stop, stoop and pick up a lost penny from the ground? To the person who dropped it, it wasn’t worth looking for. It’s hardly worth the risk of putting your back out to stoop over and pick it up. A trip to the chiropractor would cost much more than the value of the penny. Value is an odd thing to define. A penny, nickel, dime or quarter has hardly any value anymore. That dollar bill in your wallet is the new penny. The twenty? The new five. That “Benjamin”? The new fifty. Inflation is a hidden thief that robs value. It’s no big deal to become a “millionaire” anymore. On the other hand, a thin piece of cardboard smaller than a 3”x5” card sold for over two and a half million dollars. It happened to have the picture of Honus Wagner on it. Value is in the eye of the beholder. Jesus says that sparrows are valued at two cents apiece. But even they get the attention of God. This bring us eventually to the question; “What is your value?” What are you worth? I once read a story of a naval aviator who ditched his aircraft in the ocean in World War II. He was eventually captured by Indigenous people on an island. He was traded to others for a sack of rice. They valued this man as equal to a sack of rice. The gospels tell us the story of God sending His only Son to earth to pick up every lost penny as it were. Jesus even tells a story of the “Lost Coin” illustrating the lengths He goes to find everyone of us who is a lost coin. That was His mission. Matthew 18:11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost. Jesus asks us this question: Matthew 16:26 For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul? What would you be willing to give to save your life? Everything. Nothing is worth more than our very life. God values your life more than you do. He was willing to send His only Son to save you. He took your place on a cross He didn’t deserve to save us from death. Think of it! As we celebrate this weekend the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, it reminds us that we are of great worth to the One who created us. We owe Him everything, even our very lives for stooping down, picking us up and affirming that we do in fact, have value. John 3:16 16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. The world will sometimes treat us like we have little value. God never will. Your life is of great value to Him. Why not put your trust in someone who places such great value on you? Rev.

    "title": "This All-in-One Electric Hydrofoil and Surfboard Is Amazing but Costs Nearly a Kidney - autoevolution",
    "text": "With summer just around the corner, I've decided to bring to light some of the toys that lie in wait. One of those toys is Scubajet's Hybridboard, an all-in-one water sports solution that lets you switch between a hydrofoil and an e-board without ever changing the board you're on. That's right, folks, the wonderous machine you see in the image gallery is an That manufacturer is none other than Austrian-based Scubajet, started by Armin Kundigraber in 2016. His love of water sports sparked the beginnings of this crew, and while it's their boards that take the spotlight, Scubajet's focus on the way their drivetrains function is also key. Now, there are two ways you can go about things. According to Scubajet's website, you can purchase the Hybridboard as just a hydrofoil or e-board, both of which cost €15,800 ($17K at current exchange rates) each. The all-in-one unit is going for €18,960 ($29,400). Quite a bit more than other such trinkets on the market, but there are clear reasons for this, and the starting point is Just how nimble? Well, if you've ever ridden an e-surfboard, then you know darned well that your board-manipulating skills are going to play a huge factor in your ability to enjoy the experience; it's not at all easy, and to carve, you really need to know what to do, when to do it, and to actually have the muscles to do so. That said, Scubajet is showcasing a top speed of up to 50 kph (31 mph) for e-foil operation and 45 kph (28 mph)while under surfboard mode. No matter which of the two you enjoy, that's As for just how much fun you can have with one of these babies, Scubajet shows us a runtime of 1.5 hours with just one battery under e-foil operation, but once we switch over to surfboard mode, that runtime drops to 40 minutes, with both batteries in place! This makes sense, considering the dynamics of both systems. With two batteries in the board, the e-foil is going to cruise around for up to 3 hours. As for the battery bay itself, it's hidden under the footboard, and you shouldn't have to worry about this thing catching on fire while out in the water; these babies are fitted with waterproof battery bays. Once those powerhouses are drained, you'll be pulling off to the side for 3.5 hours before being able to go out there again. Now, to understand the magic behind such a system, let's say you head out to a lake on a weekend or even own a yacht where you'd have a couple of these babies stored. After breakfast, you can start your day with a smooth and gentle ride out on the waters to help tame the dopamine of the day's first meal. Tap into that meditative state you seek as you glide above the watery landscape below. But Finally, I need to point out that these babies have been in the preorder stages for almost a year. According to the manufacturer's website, the Performance Series boards, the ones we talked about today, are That said, if you've never ridden an e-foil or e-surfboard, find them in your area, take them for a spin - beware the learning curve as it's going to be a tough first experience, so keep at it - and then you'll know what Scubajet has achieved here. But, if you're in the US, \"Shipping will be available soon.\" Hang tight, or was that hang ten? [electric hydrofoil and e-board](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/the-new-renault-5-will-be-unveiled-in-geneva-next-to-these-crazy-yellow-mobility-vehicles-229569.html)all in one neat package, and since I've ridden both a hydrofoil and e-board, I found it rather nice to see a manufacturer think of such a solution. That manufacturer is none other than Austrian-based Scubajet, started by Armin Kundigraber in 2016. His love of water sports sparked the beginnings of this crew, and while it's their boards that take the spotlight, Scubajet's focus on the way their drivetrains function is also key.

The all-in-one unit is going for €18,960 ($29,400). Quite a bit more than other such trinkets on the market, but there are clear reasons for this, and the starting point is [what these babies are crafted out of](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/azimut-s-new-grande-44m-flagship-boasts-an-innovative-eco-friendly-four-deck-design-231452.html). If you've had a look at the images in the gallery, it's possible you noticed all that carbon fiber. Well, this building material definitely isn't cheap, nor is it shaping such a body; you need to create molds, find qualified technicians, and put in the man-hours to work with carbon fiber. This ensures a light construction, with the board weighing just 11.5 kg (25.3 lbs) without the batteries. The batteries tack on an extra 10 kg (22 lbs) of weight, which is still decent and should feel rather nimble on the water. Just how nimble? Well, if you've ever ridden an e-surfboard, then you know darned well that your board-manipulating skills are going to play a huge factor in your ability to enjoy the experience; it's not at all easy, and to carve, you really need to know what to do, when to do it, and to actually have the muscles to do so. That said, Scubajet is showcasing a top speed of up to 50 kph (31 mph) for e-foil operation and 45 kph (28 mph)while under surfboard mode. No matter which of the two you enjoy, that's [more than fast enough](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/do-summer-right-with-gosun-s-elcat-splash-inflatable-and-solar-powered-fun-for-the-family-229968.html). As for just how much fun you can have with one of these babies, Scubajet shows us a runtime of 1.5 hours with just one battery under e-foil operation, but once we switch over to surfboard mode, that runtime drops to 40 minutes, with both batteries in place! This makes sense, considering the dynamics of both systems. With two batteries in the board, the e-foil is going to cruise around for up to 3 hours. For example, a hydrofoil relies on an underwater fixed wing sitting on a mast to create lift, and once your board is off the water's surface, it's all a very neat and almost frictionless experience; it's like having your own magic carpet. But a surfboard is [the exact opposite](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/exclusive-1973-jet-ski-and-passion-birthed-the-hydroblade-frictionless-hydrofoil-fun-204266.html), always in contact with the water's surface and subjected to loads of friction. As for the battery bay itself, it's hidden under the footboard, and you shouldn't have to worry about this thing catching on fire while out in the water; these babies are fitted with waterproof battery bays. Once those powerhouses are drained, you'll be pulling off to the side for 3.5 hours before being able to go out there again. Now, to understand the magic behind such a system, let's say you head out to a lake on a weekend or even own a yacht where you'd have a couple of these babies stored.

But [adrenaline calls](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/searider-evs-are-about-to-change-the-water-sports-game-in-a-big-way-fast-as-hell-231162.html). So, for those of us who are looking for a more aggressive experience, all you have to do is flip your board over, get to work using Scubajet's quick-release system, and switch modes. You'll need to add a couple of fins to the surfboard, and you're good to go. All that's done with no tools and well under a minute once you get the hang of it. Finally, I need to point out that these babies have been in the preorder stages for almost a year. According to the manufacturer's website, the Performance Series boards, the ones we talked about today, are [set to start being delivered before summer 2024](https://www.scubajet.com/shop/accessories/all-in-one-hybridboard/), which is right about now. That said, if you've never ridden an e-foil or e-surfboard, find them in your area, take them for a spin - beware the learning curve as it's going to be a tough first experience, so keep at it - and then you'll know what Scubajet has achieved here.

    "text": "Immunize Infants with Beyfortus As Quickly As Possible The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today announced a change in its guidance regarding using Nirsevimab (Beyfortus™) in a Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity email. As of January 5, 2023, the CDC says that infants and children recommended to receive Beyfortus should be immunized as quickly as possible. [Beyfortus](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/beyfortus-nirsevimab-rsv-antibody) is the first U.S. FDA-approved extended half-life monoclonal antibody offering young children passive immunization to prevent lower respiratory tract infections caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Given the recent increase in Beyfortus supply and the manufacturers’ plan to release an additional 230,000 doses in January 2024, the CDC now advises healthcare providers to return to recommendations put forward by the CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on the use of Beyfortus in young children. Furthermore, healthcare providers should not reserve Beyfortus doses for infants born later in the season when RSV circulation and risk for exposure to RSV may be lower. On October 23, 2023, the CDC issued Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory #499 to provide guidance for the prioritization of Beyfortus given the limited supply. In the setting of increasing supply, healthcare providers should administer a single dose of Beyfortus to all infants aged under eight months and children aged 8 through 19 months at increased risk. The CDC is working closely with jurisdictional partners to ensure adequate supply through the Vaccines for Children Program. Moreover, [neither approved RSV vaccine](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/rsv-vaccines) (Abrysvo, Arexvy) is approved for use in infants or young children. Healthcare providers should take care to use the correct product for the correct population, says the CDC. In early 2024, RSV activity remained elevated nationwide and increased in many parts of the country. However, decreased activity has been observed in the Southeast area of the United States, such as Florida. A [HAN](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/index.asp) is the CDC’s primary method of sharing information about urgent public health incidents.",
