    "text": "At 23, Kellie Finlayson's life was like most young women her age.\nShe finished university, celebrating the milestone with a European summer holiday, before returning home where she met and started dating Port Adelaide AFL star, Jeremy Finlayson.\nIt was around that time she began feeling some discomfort in her stomach. She didn't think much of it though. Back then everyone was intolerant of something, and Finlayson assumed she was in the same boat.\n\"It was popular for someone to say they had an intolerance to something, like gluten or lactose. It was almost like it was weird if you didn't have an intolerance,\" she tells Mamamia .\nWatch: Deborah Hutton's message. Post continues below.\nVideo via Nine Network It bothered her enough to visit a naturopath, but the feeling wasn't going away, even with treatment.\n\"I was stabilising the symptoms , but it wasn't fixing them,\" she says. \"So, I went to see a GP and did a stool sample which came back with some kind of discrepancy.\"\n\"Being a 23-year-old, they're not going to think it's anything serious,\" Finlayson says, and neither did she. By the time a new appointment was booked eight months later, she was pregnant, and wasn't able to proceed. Instead, she focused on her pregnancy, and the arrival of her baby daughter, Sophie.\nNicole Madigan Senior Writer December 29, 2023\nShare via facebook\nShare via twitter\nShare via whatsapp\nSMS Share via SMS\nShare via e-mail 3 Comments Listen Now\n00:00\nHow Matt Moran Really Feels About Fast Food What I Eat When 10 Things I Learnt In My 20s Fill My Cup ADVERTISEMENT After coming up for air from new motherhood, Finlayson found she was still experiencing similar symptoms as before, but now she attributed them to her new post-partum body.\n\"I thought everything was just from having a baby. I had nothing to compare it to. My partner joked about taking a Portaloo everywhere we went, because I always had the urge to go to the toilet.\"\nBut it was something else causing the pressure.\nKellie and Jeremy Finlayson. Image: Instagram/@kelliefinlayson_\nADVERTISEMENT The diagnosis. The ongoing bathroom issues prompted Finlayson to return to the GP.\n\"Then I found blood in my stool, and in three days I was finally having a colonoscopy,\" she says.\nFinlayson recalls how kind everyone was to her when she came out of the appointment. They even let her partner and baby inside the clinic, despite COVID restrictions. She thought it was just a friendly place, but it was more than that. They knew what news she was about to be delivered. The doctor, however, was more direct.\n\"The doctor just turned a piece of paper around and said ‘this is what bowel cancer looks like',\" says Finlayson.\n\"I was in a state of denial. Ended up leaving with my cannula still in my arm because I was so angry at the world. I didn't ask questions, and I didn’t understand what it meant at all.\"\nFinlayson knew nothing about bowel cancer. She'd heard of breast cancer and knew it could be cured. She assumed a similar outcome for herself. \"I didn't come to terms with the cancer being something that could kill you,\" she says. \"The doctors were just so optimistic, my surgeon — bless his soul — would always say 'I'm quietly confident'.\"\nADVERTISEMENT Finlayson was diagnosed with Stage 4 Bowel Cancer. She was 25 years old, with a baby daughter, and a partner she hoped to marry. While she wasn't given a prognosis, Stage 4 is considered terminal.\n\"I think the mental and psychological toll of a terminal diagnosis is probably harder than the physical. My surgeon was cautious of making sure I was looking after my brain as well as my body.\"\nFinlayson underwent a range of intense treatments that took a toll on her both physically and emotionally. When the treatment was over, she received unexpected and incredible news — scans revealed no evidence of cancer.\n\"He wouldn't use the term remission or cancer free, but I was going well considering where I should have been at that point,\" says Finlayson. \"I chose to be more positive rather than negative and I think that positive mindset pulled me through more than what I would have been able to overcome if I'd been set on numbers.\"\nA crushing blow. As the end of 2022 drew near, Finlayson and her family of three returned to her hometown of Port Lincoln for Christmas. Within days, she felt breathless. Assuming she'd caught COVID — it was everywhere and her symptoms matched what COVID-sufferers were reporting — she made a quick visit to the local GP.\nBeing a local, the nurse at the local general practice had been following Finlayson on Instagram, and knew her medical history. She wasn't about to make assumptions.\nADVERTISEMENT \"It was really lucky she was working because she sent me straight up for a CT scan,\" she says.\nThe doctor though, was unaware of her history, and explained the diagnosis of bowel cancer in explicit detail, as though she were hearing it for the first time.\n\"That was very hard to take, especially because I went there confident it was COVID. I had told my partner and mum I didn't need anyone to come with me — I figured I can beat COVID if I can beat cancer.\"\nIt was a crushing blow. Finlayson was looking forward to spending a proper Christmas with baby Sophia, after spending the previous Christmas undergoing chemotherapy.\n\"I put it in the back of my mind, and was very much in denial again.\"\nBut on Boxing Day, she had no choice but to return to Adelaide, where the return of bowel cancer was confirmed.\nHer oncologist gave her three options, depending on the outcome of an upcoming scan. If it was localised to one spot, they would do a resection and possibly some chemotherapy; if it had spread around the area to some lymph does, she'd have to do chemotherapy and radiation along with a resection; if it spread to other organs, that would mean palliative care.\nFinlayson had her heart set on a resection, but the scan revealed the third possibility — the cancer had spread. Her partner was optimistic about potential chemotherapy. She'd done it before, she could do it again, he said.\nADVERTISEMENT \"But nobody knows the extent of treatment and how hard it is unless you've done it. Many people keep the pain to themselves, because you don't want your family to feel guilty.\n\"So, I had to explain to him, which was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I also had to explain to him what that scan meant. My oncologist told me it meant palliative care.\n\"That day he saw himself as a single father for the first time. Even though we'd been through it for a year, he’d never had to wrap his head around me not being here.\"\nWhile Finlayson did understand what the scan meant, at 26 years of age, she decided she wasn't going to palliative care, so she called her surgeon and said: find me a new oncologist.\n\"I did say I would never do chemo again because it was the worst time of my life. But once I found my new oncologist, I was soon hooked back up.\"\nThe couple were married in March. Image: Instagram/@kelliefinlayson_\nADVERTISEMENT Living for today. In March 2023, Finlayson married her partner, Jeremy, a milestone she'd never given up on.\nAfter finishing the last round of chemotherapy in July, her scans showed the tumour was stable. That means the cancer is still there, but it's not active.\n\"It's not showing up in my blood markers at all. My body thinks there’s nothing there,\" she says.\nIt's now a matter of 'wait and see', including blood tests every three weeks, and scans every three months.\nFinlayson's goal now, is to be healthy enough to be a good mum to her daughter, Sophia, and live a happy life for as long as possible.\n\"I'm not naïve, it's a terminal illness after all. I could live for 25 years, I could live for 50 years, or I could live for five months.\"\nThe Finlaysons are now ticking things of their 'living list', including a recent trip to Africa for their honeymoon.\nADVERTISEMENT \"We have a lot of things on it. Our biggest one is to take Sophia to Disneyland for her 5th birthday. But that’s three years away. Another one would be when Jez retires, to travel Australia for a few months.\"\nKellie is now an ambassador for the Jodi Lee Foundation. Image: Supplied.\nRaising awareness. Finlayson is now working with the Jodi Lee Foundation to help raise awareness of bowel cancer, especially for young people whose knowledge of this type of cancer is limited, despite it being the leading cancer killer for people aged between 25 and 35.\nADVERTISEMENT At that age, it's easy to blame bowel cancer symptoms on something else, which is why it's so often detected at a later stage.\n\"The earlier it is detected, the better off you are, the more likely you are to live,\" says Finlayson, who looks back on the initial colonoscopy delay and wonders how different her journey could have been.\nDetected at Stage 1, bowel cancer patients have a 99 per cent chance of survival, at Stage 4, that drops to just 14 per cent.\nSpotting symptoms can be tricky as they can be confused with common ailments, such as bloating, abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, unexplained change in bowel habits.\nIf you see blood in your stools or on the toilet paper, you should immediately visit the doctor. If you have symptoms you're unsure of, check out the JLF symptom checker , and visit your GP.\n\"You are genuinely saving your life just by going to see a doctor,\" she says.\nTo check your symptoms, visit https://www.trustyourgut.org.au/\nFeature image: Instagram/@kelliefinlayson_\nDo you have kids aged under 13 years?

    "text": "Manuel Elkin Patarroyo experimentó con monos nocturnos del Amazonas para conocer la reacción del sistema inmunológico a las vacunas contra la malaria -crédito Diego Pineda En la tarde del 9 de enero de 2025, se confirmó la muerte de Manuel Elkin Patarroyo, por una afección cardiorrespiratoria. El tolimense, ganador del Premio Príncipe de Asturias de Investigación Científica y Técnica de 1994, tuvo problemas legales en 2012 por incumplir con licencias ambientales y afectar a la población animal que utilizaba para realizar experimentos.\nEl 5 de julio de 2012, el Tribunal Administrativo de Cundinamarca falló a favor de una demanda en la que se denunciaban las malas prácticas que Manuel Elkin Patarroyo y la Fundación Instituto de Inmunología de Colombia (FIDIC), llevaban a cabo con los monos aotus.\nAhora puede seguirnos en Facebook y en nuestro WhatsApp Channel .\nSegún las denuncias, el científico tatuaba con consecutivos a los simios y los liberaba sin conocer las repercusiones de la malaria en los animales - crédito Miguel Barreto/EFE Con el fallo, se le retiró la licencia que tenía por entonces el científico para experimentar con los primates hasta que cumpliera con las condiciones necesarias impuestas: crear un zoocriadero y hacer un estudio de la población de monos nocturnos en el área afectada con el fin de no reducir la población significativamente.\nEn una entrevista que el científico concedió al medio La Silla Vacía , explicó que estudiaba con estos simios porque tenían un sistema inmunitario muy parecido al de los humanos. A su vez, negó que incumpliera con las leyes ambientales y que trabajaba “por los que no tienen voz, que son un millón y medio de niños muertos al año”. También indicó que la tasa de mortalidad de estos animales era del 5% y que, una vez finalizado el experimento, eran liberados.\nCabe destacar que, las licencias que tuvo le permitían capturar 800 monos nocturnos al año, pero según Ángela Maldonado, primatóloga que demandó al científico, en varias ocasiones Patarroyo capturó más micos de lo que tenía permitido y los liberaba sin saber las consecuencias que tendrían en ellos la inmersión de la malaria.\nEl científico habría experimentado con animales de territorio brasileño y peruano - crédito NaturaLista Colombia Estas acusaciones fueron negadas por Patarroyo que, según La Silla Vacía , entregó los datos en los que se confirmaba la cantidad de animales capturados entre 1984 y 2010. Según el medio, en 2003 se registró la entrada de 2093 monos nocturnos.\nCon respecto a la liberación de los animales, Patarroyo indicó que eran tratados con antimaláricos, por lo que no había riesgo de propagar la enfermedad.\nMarcas a los monos y experimentos con animales de Perú y Brasil Según confirmó al medio anteriormente mencionado Lina Peláez, que fue veterinaria en la fundación del hoy fallecido científico, el trato con los micos era indebido, puesto que, una vez entraban, eran tatuados con un consecutivo. El número general superaba los 20.000. El científico afirmó que las palabras de la veterinaria eran falsas y que había declarado eso, porque él la había despedido.\nSus experimentos permitieron desarrollar más investigaciones contra la malaria en el mundo, luego de que entregara su proyecto a la comunidad internacional - crédito El Observador Por otra parte, al científico se le acusó de tráfico de fauna, porque habría experimentado con monos provenientes de Brasil y Perú. Algo que dijo, pudo haber pasado antes de 2006, pero no después de aquel año, porque había reforzado las normativas para evitarlo. Además, afirmó que solo pagaba a indígenas colombianos por cada captura. No obstante, la Revista Cambio publicó en 2007 un fotorreportaje en el que se evidenciaba que indígenas colombianos pagaban a los habitantes rurales de los países vecinos por cada simio capturado.\nEn 2014, un fallo del Consejo de Estado suspendió su trabajo con los monos nocturnos a causa de las denuncias de Ángela Maldonado, pero fue revocado en 2015 y la fundación fue sometida a una investigación para saber si Patarroyo cumplía con los requerimientos que le hicieron.",

    "text": "Papa Francisco apresenta sinais de insuficiência renal e recuperação é incerta; entenda\nDurante a manhã, no apartamento montado no 10º andar, o Papa participou da Santa Missa junto àqueles que cuidam dele durante este período de internação\nO novo boletim sobre a saúde do papa Francisco divulgado na tarde deste domingo (23) diz que ele não teve novas crises respiratórias, mas apresenta sinais de insuficiência renal. Pela manhã, o informe do Vaticano dizia que ele teve uma \"noite tranquila\" e descansou.\n\"As condições do Santo Padre continuam críticas; no entanto, desde ontem à noite, ele não apresentou novas crises respiratórias\", diz o comunicado. O texto também cita que ele \"recebeu duas unidades de concentrado de hemácias\" e teve aumento nos níveis de hemoglobina, a proteína responsável por transportar o sangue dos pulmões para o resto do corpo.\n\"Contudo, alguns exames de sangue indicam um início leve de insuficiência renal, que, por ora, está sob controle\", continua o informe, acrescentando que o pontífice está recebendo oxigênio por meio de cânulas nasais. \"O Santo Padre segue alerta e bem orientado.\"\nSegundo a equipe médica, \"a complexidade do quadro clínico e o tempo necessário para que as terapias medicamentosas apresentem alguma resposta tornam necessária a manutenção do prognóstico reservado\". Ou seja, os médicos seguem cautelosos, e a recuperação é incerta.\n\"Durante a manhã, no apartamento montado no 10º andar, [Francisco] participou da Santa Missa junto àqueles que cuidam dele durante este período de internação\", conclui o boletim.\nSábado crítico\nO sábado (22) foi pior dia que o papa Francisco, 88, passou desde que foi internado no hospital Gemelli, em Roma, em 14 de fevereiro, há nove dias. A atualização matinal mantinha a linha do que havia sido revelado na véspera, concisa, limitada a dizer que \"o papa repousou bem\" e só. Sem referências sobre \"café da manhã sentado em poltrona\", por exemplo, como vinha sendo descrito nos dias anteriores.\nDesde que entrou no hospital, a comunicação do Vaticano tem divulgado um boletim mais detalhado no fim do dia, no horário local, e uma nota breve pela manhã.\nNo boletim da noite de sábado, foi revelado que as condições do papa tinham se agravado diante de uma crise respiratória asmática, que exigiu a aplicação de oxigênio suplementar. Ele também precisou de transfusões de sangue porque os testes mostraram que ele tinha uma baixa contagem de plaquetas, associada a uma anemia.\nO texto descreveu que, pela primeira vez, o prognóstico era reservado, confirmando que a evolução do estado de saúde do pontífice é imprevisível, como já havia indicado a equipe médica que trata do papa, em entrevista coletiva na sexta-feira (21). Na ocasião, disseram que o argentino não estava fora de perigo, mas que não corria, naquele momento, risco de morrer.\nAfirmaram ainda que o papa é considerado um paciente bastante frágil pela idade, pela falta de mobilidade e devido à existência de doenças respiratórias crônicas.\nComo anunciado, o Angelus, como é chamada a tradicional oração que o papa conduz ao vivo, da janela do Palácio Apostólico, na praça São Pedro, não foi guiado neste domingo nem por Francisco nem por um substituto, mas limitado à publicação de um texto online, como já havia ocorrido.\nNeste domingo, na celebração do Jubileu dos Diáconos, evento dentro da programação do Jubileu da Igreja, a missa na Basílica de São Pedro foi conduzida pelo arcebispo Rino Fisichella.\nO papa foi internado no dia 14 com sintomas de bronquite e, nos exames, foram comprovadas uma infecção polimicrobiana e uma pneumonia bilateral. O risco, afirmou o médico Sergio Alfieri, é que a infecção atinja a corrente sanguínea e leve a uma sepse, que é uma resposta inflamatória exacerbada do organismo a uma infecção.",

    "title": "Alberta, Ontario, Sask. announce partnership to create recovery-focused addictions treatment | CBC News",
    "text": "[Calgary](/news/canada/calgary) Critics denounce Alberta government's refusal of safe supply Alberta, Ontario and Saskatchewan have announced they're partnering to build addictions treatment systems focused on recovery, instead of safe supply. To start, the three provinces will focus on sharing policy ideas to manage the addictions crisis. Alberta's minister of mental health and addictions, Dan Williams, introduced the partnership on Thursday at the Recovery Capital Conference in Calgary. \"Canada has had a lively discussion surrounding our path forward, especially when it comes to addiction,\" said the minister. \"Recovery-oriented systems of care are an important piece of … how we can improve getting people out of that deadly disease of addiction and into healthy and healed relationships.\" Ontario's associate minister of mental health and addictions, Michael Tibollo, said the partnership will help provinces avoid growing pains and repeating each other's mistakes as they establish new treatment systems. \"Mental health and addictions is always stigmatized,\" he said. \"A lot of times, the way we get over that stigma is by collaborating and talking, learning from each other, doing jurisdictional scans.\" Alberta's provincial government announced on Tuesday it was creating a new organization called Recovery Alberta, which will take over the delivery of mental health and addiction services from Alberta Health Services. Operations are expected to move from AHS to Recovery Alberta by July 1 after legislation is passed. In a statement, Heather Smith, president of the United Nurses of Alberta (UNA), said the premier's announcement of Recovery Alberta left more questions than answers, calling the changes \"confusing and potentially chaotic.\" \"Every AHS nursing employee will be impacted directly or indirectly by this decision to hive off mental health and addiction services into a separate organization, and it appears there was a serious lack of in-depth planning,\" she said. Williams said Alberta's policy approach to the addictions crisis will be affected by the evaluation of another new organization, the Canadian Centre of Recovery Excellence (CORE). The province announced it was creating CORE on Tuesday, saying the new organization will conduct research on mental health and addictions to inform policy. The Alberta government committed $5 million in its 2024 budget to establish CORE. Data shows record number of overdose deaths Last year was the deadliest on record in Alberta when it comes to drug poisoning deaths. Alberta's Substance Use Surveillance System shows that 1,706 people died of drug poisoning from January to November 2023. The number marks a 24 per cent increase from 2022, when 1,375 drug poisoning deaths were recorded during the same period. Last year's death count also marks a more than 150 per cent jump from the 626 drug poisoning deaths recorded in 2019 — the year the United Conservative Party assumed office. When asked how he knows Alberta's focus on recovery treatment is working, Williams said the province's approach is still being established. He also said deaths related to cocaine, alcohol and pharmaceutically prescribed opioids are down. At an NDP news conference on Thursday, Alberta's NDP critic for mental health and addictions, Janet Eremenko, criticized the provincial government's refusal of safe supply harm reduction. \"Danielle Smith's disregard for health expertise and evidence is downright negligent,\" she said. \"Experts have spoken out about the solutions that work. They have offered their advice to this government on how we can stop the terrifying trend and keep Albertans alive.\" Frank Frey, the former chair of Fresh Start Recovery, also criticized the UCP's focus on recovery treatment without safe supply. \"If the UCP really cares about the well-being of Albertans, they must listen to the voice of harm reduction advocates, health-care professionals and people with lived experience,\" he said. \"The ideological games need to stop.\" At the Recovery Capital Conference, Williams said safe supply produces harm, instead of curbing it, and accused safe supply advocates of usurping the term \"harm reduction.\" \"If when they say 'harm reduction' … they mean to say drug consumption sites on every street corner in our cities … then I oppose that,\" said Williams.",

    "text": "By Dylan Svoboda ,\n2 hours ago\nOne of the biggest pieces that was potentially going to hit MLB’s trade market is heading to the injury list just days before the deadline.\nA’s closer Mason Miller was put on the 15-day IL with a broken left pinky on Thursday, complicating a potential trade for the hard-throwing right-hander.\nMiller, 25, fractured the finger on his non-throwing hand after putting “his hand down awkwardly” while preparing for an exercise, according to MLB.com’s Martin Gallegos .\nA’s deny themselves easy run by running into most bizarre out at home plate\nThe closer has been utterly dominant this season, striking out 70 batters over 40 ⅔ innings with a 2.21 ERA and 15 saves for Oakland.\nMiller is averaging a whopping 100.9 mph on his fastball in 2024, according to Baseball Savant, the fastest heater in the big leagues.\nA rookie this season, Miller is under club control for five more seasons and isn’t eligible to become a free agent until after the 2029 season, making him an even more appealing piece for teams looking to improve this year and beyond.\nYankees acquire J.D. Davis in trade with A’s: ‘Give us a little spark’\nA broken pinky will take Mason Miller out of action for at least a couple of weeks. Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports Even before the injury, the A’s appeared disinclined to move their young closer, with ESPN’s Buster Onley reporting Wednesday that Miller was “out of play in the trade market” despite Oakland sitting at 41-63 and in last place in the American League West.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR STARTING LINEUP NEWSLETTER\nEven Miller himself threw water on a potential trade out of the Bay Area recently.\n“I don’t anticipate me really heading out this year,” Miller said earlier this month . “The value I’m bringing right now to the team, I think they want to hold on to that, and I’m happy to be a part of that group.”\nA’s manager Mark Kotsay echoed the same sentiment around the All-Star Break.\n“I don’t [think Miller will be traded]. For us, where we’re trying to go, what we’re trying to do, to build something from within, he is a big part of that development. I can’t say 100 percent because I don’t make those decisions. But when I look at him, I see part of our nucleus.”\nFor the latest in sports, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/sports/\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
