    "text": "Delhi consumer court orders hair transplant clinic to pay Rs 6.3 lakh to man who saw ‘not even 1% improvement’\nThe Delhi consumer court found that the hair transplant clinic was operating without a government licence to perform modern hair transplant procedures.\nNirbhay ThakurJuly 3, 2025 10:57 IST\nThe New Delhi District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission recently directed a hair transplant clinic to pay Rs 6.3 lakh compensation to a client after finding it guilty of negligence in providing service. The Commission also noted that DHI Asian Roots was operating without a government licence to perform modern hair transplant procedures.\nThe complainant, Vivek Kumar, approached the DHI Asian Roots clinic in Safdarjung Enclave in 2012 before his marriage to treat baldness and paid Rs 5 lakh. He alleged before the Commission that he was promised results after 12 months, but even after three sittings, he could not notice “even 1 per cent improvement” with his receding hairline. He filed a complaint with the Commission in December 2023.\nThe Commission’s order, dated May 22, which followed an 11-year legal battle, directed DHI Asian Roots to refund Rs 5 lakh to Kumar, along with Rs 1 lakh for mental harassment and Rs 30,000 for litigation costs.\n“…this Commission is of the considered opinion that there is negligence/ deficiency in service on the part of the opposite parties (DHI) in not providing proper treatment to the complainant despite charging for the same. This is a case where opposite parties transplanted the hairs to cover bald area and created another bald area by over harvesting the donor area,” the Commission held.\n“The OP/DHI-Asian Roots, a unit of SPA Yoga Pvt. Ltd… failed to produce any document showing authorization or license to perform modern scientific hair implantation procedures. They also lacked government approval to engage doctors…for such treatments,” held the Commission.\n“The procedure conducted amounted to an unfair medical trade practice, carried out without the requisite licenses or specialized expertise, and appeared motivated solely by financial gain,” it added.\nCountering Kumar’s allegations, DHI Asian Roots argued that it provided professional treatment in accordance with medical standards and that the chances of success had been explained to him.\nIt also alleged that Kumar’s dissatisfaction stemmed from his impatience and his “disregard for medical advice”. It claimed that Kumar had been informed about the procedure’s limitations and that all the pros and cons of the surgery had been explained to him.",

    "text": "Terrarium startup OBEnaturelle tops 2023 Hen Hatch Share NEWARK – Lauren Roberts caught the entrepreneurial bug at a young age. When the Newark resident was only in third grade, she had already launched her own small business selling fake nails made from paper. Over the years, she would evolve to selling candies and crafts she’d created through the unofficial “Lauren’s Galore Store.” Now, the 20-year-old University of Delaware sophomore has a full-fledged small business focused on plants — an endeavor that already netted her $20,000 in revenue in its first six months and earned the attention of a panel of judges at this year’s Hen Hatch startup competition. “What I have right now is an established system,” she said, noting that the company she started right before high school paused for a while as she transitioned to college. Now, with the support and earnings from the latest contest and other offerings through UD, Roberts hopes to focus more on marketing and scaling her company to get it back to that initial success. The pitch for [her company](https://obenaturelle.com/), OBEnaturelle, which not only offers direct sales of plants, terrarium kits and other merchandise but also corporate or private workshops and parties, caught the attention of the contest’s four judges: Dave Liss, of W.L. Gore & Associates, Mac Macleod, of Carvertise; Wendy Scott, of Blue Blaze Associates; and Glenn Glady, of Robin Hood Ventures. Roberts topped all finalists in this year’s Hen Hatch contest, taking with her $8,300 in funding, $1,000 in Shoprite gift cards and over 30 hours of legal, marketing and workforce services. Hen Hatch is UD Horn Entrepreneurship’s “premier pitch competition,” explained faculty coordinator Daniel Lee, an assistant professor in the Alfred Lerner College of Business & Economics. The multi-round contest starts in the summer with students submitting a multi-page business plan, then moves on to the semifinals and mentoring before whittling down to the four final entrepreneurs who [presented this fall](https://horn.udel.edu/an-epicenter-for-innovation-2023-hen-hatchs-final-round). “It’s important for the students because it gets them boots-on-the-ground experience pitching to a panel of investors,” Lee said. “It’s important to them also because they get help and feedback on these student-run ventures.” It also gives the surrounding business community a closer look at the entrepreneurial spirit and talent coming from the university, while also staying connected to the local business community, he said. Roberts, who is studying entrepreneurship and on track to graduate in 2026, joined marketing student Ian Drogowitz, entrepreneurship and fashion merchandising major Samantha McGhee and entrepreneurship and management student Nicholai Williamson as this year’s Hen Hatch finalists. Lee said this year’s finalists focused a lot on what he would call “disruptive business models” rather than deep-tech or intellectual property. Businesses like ONEnaturelle are those that have already been deployed in the market, and not something that needs years of development in a laboratory. “When you’re in the mid-Atlantic, it’s sort of easy to overlook Delaware. It’s a small state. In northern Delaware, you can look to Philly for a lot of these innovations,” Lee said. “But we have a bunch of [bright, young minds](https://delawarebusinesstimes.com/news/hospitality-app-uds-hen-hatch/) working on really cool things at UD.”",

    "text": "Hito marca un precedente en la educación parvularia del Norte del país.\nLa Facultad de Educación de la Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN), recibió el dictamen de la Comisión Nacional de Acreditación (CNA), que otorgó por unanimidad la acreditación de la carrera de Pedagogía en Educación Parvularia con Mención en Desarrollo Emocional y Cognitivo por un período de tres años, el máximo para carreras sin egresados y egresadas.\nTras años de trabajo, el equipo de autoevaluación lideró un proceso de gran impacto en la formación de educadores y educadoras de párvulo que culminó con la acreditación que entra en vigencia a partir del 4 de diciembre del 2024. La carrera es la segunda en la UCN acreditada con los nuevos estándares de aseguramiento de la calidad de la CNA para las pedagogías.\nLa Dra. Patricia Castillo Ladino, decana de la Facultad de Educación de la UCN, destacó este logro. “Constituye un importante acicate para seguir contribuyendo a la formación inicial docente en el Norte de Chile, lo que nos posiciona como una universidad de excelencia. Sin duda, este proceso de autoevaluación y su resultado, viene a robustecer el aporte al desarrollo profesional de docentes en el norte y nos desafía a seguir avanzando como institución en la formación de masa crítica de excelencia para así garantizar el derecho a la educación de los niños y niñas en el país. Este resultado es el fruto del trabajo de profesionales muy comprometidos con la revalorización social de la labor docente” enfatizó.\nLa carrera de Pedagogía en Educación Parvularia con Mención en Desarrollo Emocional y Cognitivo abrió su admisión en 2021 y es una de las primeras carreras en el Norte del país en ofrecer un plan de estudios que aborda el bienestar emocional de las infancias en contextos educativos. Con esta carrera profesional, la Facultad de Educación UCN establece una línea de formación en educación de párvulos que atiende las necesidades del territorio.\nLa académica Paola Ponce, jefa de Carrera de Pedagogía en Educación Parvularia con Mención en Desarrollo Emocional y Cognitivo, señala que conseguir la máxima acreditación para una carrera sin egresados fue un inmenso logro. “Como carrera nueva en su tercer año de implementación nos orientamos a cumplir altos estándares de calidad, niveles de competencias y logros de aprendizajes en los futuros egresados y egresadas de la educación parvularia. Queremos seguir creciendo en esta nueva etapa, seguir perfeccionando nuestros procesos y empezar a trabajar en la mira de una nueva acreditación que ojalá venga por siete años”, comentó.\nAsimismo, Pía Cavallero, educadora de párvulo, académica y encargada de Acreditación de la carrera de Pedagogía en Educación Parvularia, puso de relieve este logro. “Fue un proceso arduo y de gran dedicación, durante el cual se logró la convocatoria y participación de académicos, profesionales de apoyo, estudiantes y comunidad en general. Esta noticia es una inyección de éxito para la carrera”.\nSegún datos entregados por la Subsecretaría de Educación Parvularia y Elige Educar, se proyecta un déficit importante de educadores y educadoras de párvulos para el año 2034. Por lo que la apertura de la carrera y su acreditación contribuyen significativamente en disminuir esta carencia de profesionales en la Macrozona Norte.\nCon la apertura de las nuevas carreras de pedagogía y la acreditación de ambas, la UCN reafirma su compromiso con la formación de profesores y profesoras en el Norte de Chile.",

    "text": "Vents intenses prévus dans le sud des T.N.-O : les autorités aux aguets Une photo de 2021 d'un feu de forêt dans la région du Dehcho. Un feu de forêt est actuellement combattu près de Fort Liard. Photo : Fournie par le ministère de l'Environnement et des Ressources naturelles Les autorités de gestion des feux de forêt des Territoires du Nord-Ouest avisent les résidents des régions du Slave Sud et du Dehcho d’un risque accru d’activité, vendredi, en raison de l’arrivée d’un épisode de vents violents. D'après leur porte-parole, Mike Westwick, des rafales pourraient atteindre de 50 à 70 km/h, avec des températures à la hausse qui pourraient dépasser les 20 degrés Celsius, asséchant ainsi l’humidité atmosphérique. S’il y a un feu sur le terrain, il est probable qu’il puisse grossir rapidement et qu’il devienne difficile de le contrôler. À lire aussi : Nouveau feu dans le Dehcho Au total, sept feux de forêt ont été détectés jusqu’ici cette année, parmi lesquels trois demeurent actifs. Plus récemment, un incendie à 23 km au sud-ouest de Fort Liard, dans la région du Dehcho, a précipité les équipes de lutte contre les incendies sur place. Des avions-citernes ont été dépêchés sur les lieux pour appuyer les efforts des pompiers au sol. L’incendie s'étend désormais sur six hectares. Aucune communauté ni structure n’est menacée, précisent les autorités, quoique le risque d'incendie demeure extrême au cours des prochains jours pour le secteur. Fort Smith à risque Dans la région de Fort Smith, particulièrement touchée par les feux de forêt l’an dernier, l’événement météorologique pourrait s’accompagner de foudre, un déclencheur important d'incendies dans la forêt boréale. L'été dernier, Fort Smith avait été la cible de nombreux feux de forêt entraînant l'évacuation de la communauté. Photo : Radio-Canada / Julie Beaver Mike Westwick assure que les pompiers sont à l'œuvre pour limiter la propagation des feux déjà en activité afin de prévenir, au mieux, une propagation plus importante vendredi. Il rappelle aux résidents qui ont l’intention de se rendre dans l’arrière-pays de se faire le plus prudent possible pour éviter de déclencher de nouveaux feux. Les autorités anticipent toutefois que les niveaux d’humidité iront en augmentant près de Fort Smith et de Hay River à mesure que les pointes de vent diminueront samedi.",

    "title": "Former Apple employee shares how to reactivate 'essential' iPhone feature removed on new models",
    "text": "When Apple released the iPhone X and tweaked the layout of the screen, the ability to see your current battery percentage automatically was removed, something that persists on the latest models. You can still see it if you open the control center but the default view will simply just show your battery level as a bar.\nHowever, former\nApple employee and TikTok content creator, Tyler Morgan – known by the username @hitomidocameraroll – has revealed that you can reactivate this time-saving feature in a new video alongside a host of other helpful hints and tips.\nReactivate your iPhone battery percentage number\nIf you want to be able to see your\niPhone battery percentage at the top of your screen at all times, Tyler instructs viewers to: “Go to your Settings, go to your Battery settings and ensure ‘Battery Percentage’ is enabled.”\nDespite it being a relatively simple process, it’s one that many have clearly been missing as the caption of Tyler’s video reveals it’s been a heavily requested tip.\n“For all the people DMing me about battery percentage, there you go,” Tyler says.\n- OLD VS NEW:\nSwapping your smartphone for a ‘dumbphone’ could be the answer to social media addiction\nVolume adjusting automatically\nIf you find that your iPhone volume level has a mind of its own, it’s because you have Attention-Aware features turned on.\nTo disable these, Tyler says: “Go to your Settings, go down to Accessibility, Face ID and Attention and turn off ‘Attention-Aware Features.”\nMORE FOCUS STORIES\nClicking typing sound\nFor some strange reason, iPhones will automatically play clicking sounds when you type, despite the fact that it can be incredibly annoying for not only yourself and those around you.\nIf you do find this setting to be an annoyance, “go to Sounds and Haptics, Keyboard Feedback and you can choose if you want the sound or not,” explains Tyler.\n“You can just have the haptic on which I feel like most people will appreciate,” he adds, before inserting a\nclip of actor Cillian Murphy sharing his own frustrations of people who leave the clicking sounds on.\nTurn off ‘Always On’ display\nDepending on your iPhone model, you can choose to have your display in Always On mode.\nBut if this isn’t for you, Tyler says head to “Display and Brightness, [scroll] all the way down, you’re going to see Always On Display, turn it off.”\nDecide how long before your screen auto-locks\nThis setting is really down to personal preference but if you find that your phone screen takes too much or not enough time to auto-lock, you can change this timeframe in the settings.\nAlso found within Display and Brightness, this can be changed under the Auto-Lock setting. Tyler says, “Personally I feel like two minutes is ok.”\nImprove video quality\nIf you’re a budding filmmaker or simply want to improve the quality of the videos you post to social media, you can tweak the quality settings of your videos.\nHowever, it should be noted that doing so will increase the size of their files, so if your phone’s a little tight on space this tip may not be for you.\nTyler says: “In your Settings, go to your Camera, Record Video, [choose] 4K at 60 fps or whatever you prefer.”\nChoose when to carry out software updates\nAnd finally, if you’re not keen on Apple automatically adding new features to your iPhone that you know you’ll never use, you can decide to prevent software updates from downloading by themselves.\n“You should be the one to choose if you want to download the newest update or not,” says Tyler. “For this, go to General, Software Update, [and] turn iOS updates off.”\nIn this setting, Apple also lets you decide if you want to update ‘Security Responses and System Files,’ and as this could help to protect your device from hackers or viruses, it’s wise to leave this on.",

The strike begins Friday, halting 737 MAX production. Despite a proposed contract offering wage hikes and bonuses, workers rejected it, demanding higher pay. CEO Kelly Ortberg and union leaders urged acceptance, but the strike proceeds. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 13-09-2024 10:15 IST | Created: 13-09-2024 10:15 IST Boeing's factory workers on the U.S. West Coast are set to strike after 96% voted in favor, which will halt the production of the 737 MAX. This significant move comes as Boeing battles production delays and increasing debt. The strike, starting just after midnight Pacific time on Friday, follows the recent appointment of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who was tasked with regaining trust in the planemaker following several setbacks. Approximately 30,000 workers involved in producing Boeing's jets in Seattle and Portland were casting ballots on their first full contract in 16 years. Despite a proposed contract including a 25% general wage increase, a $3,000 signing bonus, and a commitment to build Boeing's next commercial jet in Seattle, workers overwhelmingly rejected it, seeking a 40% pay rise and criticizing the loss of an annual bonus. Union rules required at least two-thirds of workers to approve strike action, and they did so overwhelmingly, despite leadership recommending acceptance. (With inputs from agencies.)
