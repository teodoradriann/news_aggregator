    "title": "New Jersey Becomes First State To Mandate EV Battery Recycling",
    "text": "New Jersey has set a significant precedent by becoming the first state to require the recycling of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. This new legislation, which will come into effect in January 2027, places the responsibility for EV battery recycling primarily on the manufacturers of these batteries.\nWhy It Matters: New Jersey passed the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Management Act on January 8. The Act makes it illegal to dispose of EV batteries in landfills and instead mandates their reuse and recycling. The Act also requires EV battery producers to register with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) starting January 2025 and to report the quantity of EV batteries they sell in the state by January 2026.\nThe DEP will then provide the industry with a framework of standards and criteria for the entire recycling process. Once this framework is finalized, each battery producer must develop a written management plan that includes take-back programs for used EV batteries sold within the state. These programs may include a complete vehicle take-back program, a battery take-back program, or any other DEP-approved program.",

    "title": "New initiative to fuel neuroscience and aging research",
    "text": "Demonstrating its commitment to excellence as a member of the Association of American Universities and No. 1 in the state for National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding, the University of Miami has pledged to invest more than $30 million to bolster basic science research that will target neuroscience and aging, some of the most complex conditions confronting the United States population, including in South Florida. The investment over the next five years will create a new program in computational biology within the Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine and build collaborations across multiple University departments and institutes, including the Department of Psychology, the Frost Institute for Chemistry and Molecular Science, and the Frost Institute for Data Science and Computing. Joe Echevarria, University of Miami CEO and acting president, views the University’s investment in basic science research as an example of mission fulfillment for the University, which resulted from teamwork across its schools and colleges initiated this summer. “Our focus is on delivering world-class education, research, and patient care,” said Echevarria. “This investment, which is essential to progress on all three of those fronts, will ultimately benefit the population we serve—patients, students, and the wider community.” While translational medicine, the providence of many academic health institutions, works to “translate” discoveries from basic science research into clinical applications, basic science research makes those fundamental discoveries. An increased focus on basic science research at the University of Miami increases the potential of findings that revolutionize science, shape the future of clinical interventions, and provide unique opportunities for students pursuing careers in science and the healing professions. “This investment, involving critical study in the areas of neuroscience and aging, exemplifies the University of Miami’s long-term commitment to impactful research that benefits society,” said Guillermo “Willy” Prado, interim executive vice president for academic affairs and provost. The Miller School anticipates that the funding will help attract scientific luminaries in neuroscience and aging and more effectively fulfill its mission of delivering high-quality patient-centered care. “We’re investing in fundamental research in neuroscience and aging because that’s an area where we can truly be distinctive and impactful,” said Dr. Henri Ford, dean and chief academic officer of the Miller School. “In part this is because of the location of Miami at the gateway to Latin America and the Caribbean,” said Ford. “And in part it’s because of the unique population we have here and the opportunity to translate fundamental discoveries into interventions that can be applicable to a diverse group of people, an advantage that most other institutions don’t enjoy to the same extent we do.” Computational biology has emerged as a key area that would help advance neuroscience and aging research at the Miller School. Used to simulate and model biological systems, computational biology is a funding priority for the NIH. The program will advance neuroscience and aging research at the University by providing insight into the biological properties of proteins and cells that play a role in aging and neurodegenerative disorders. “This investment in basic sciences will elevate our institution, promoting team science and fundamental discoveries that can someday improve the health of our community,” said Dr. Stephen Nimer, executive dean for research at the Miller School and director of Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. Investing in an advanced computation infrastructure and scientific expertise will help University researchers create models from biological, genomic, and clinical findings. These models can be used to predict disease risk, aid in drug discovery, and tailor patient treatments. In fact, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded recently to researchers who are using computational biology to define protein structure and advance drug discovery, among other benefits. “The benefits of this investment are unlimited. With luminaries at the helm, we will develop robust programs that initiate discoveries,” said Ford. “Those discoveries will then attract companies that want to invest and fund clinical trials that save lives—all while we are attracting more talent and teaching the next generation of scientists to carry this work forward.”",

    "text": "ROME — The Vatican offered a speaking platform this week to Shanghai Bishop Joseph Shen Bin who used the occasion to promote the “Sinicization” of the Catholic Church in China.\nSpeaking at the Pontifical Urban University on the Janiculum Hill overlooking St. Peter’s Basilica, Bishop Shen delivered an address insisting on the need for “Sinicization,” which requires that religious institutions demonstrably embrace State Socialism and the leadership of the atheistic Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n“The Chinese government’s religious freedom policy has no interest in changing the Catholic faith,” Shen insisted, “but only hopes that the Catholic clergy and faithful will defend the interests of the Chinese people and free themselves from the control of foreign powers.”\nIn early 2023, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) unilaterally named Shen as the new bishop of Shanghai in open breach of its 2018 accord with the Vatican, which requires the former approval of both the Vatican and Beijing for all episcopal appointments.\nThe Vatican declared it had given no approval for the installation of the new bishop of Shanghai, China and only learned of the incident “from the media.”\nFile/A group of pilgrims from Communist China waves a red flag during the Pope Francis weekly general audience in St Peter Square at the Vatican, Wednesday, May 22, 2019. (Massimo Valicchia/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nMatteo Bruni, director of the Holy See Press Office, said that the Holy See was informed in April 2023 of Beijing’s decision to transfer Bishop Joseph Shen Bin to Shanghai but only learned of the bishop’s installation “from the media.”\nShen was appointed to the post by the state-run Council of Chinese Bishops, an organization of which Shen himself was the head. Shen pledged to uphold the CCP’s principles of Chinese Church independence and self-administration and the campaign of “Sinicizing” Catholicism in China.\nChinese law prohibits children under the age of 18 from entering a church or receiving any religious education, and the government-approved Protestant church, the “Three-Self Patriotic Movement,” explicitly bans its members from bringing their children up in the Christian faith, labeling the practice “brainwashing.”\nIn October 2023, Beijing passed a “Patriotic Education Law” requiring churches and religious groups to adapt their educational activities to promote the party’s official ideology.\n“The state is to guide and support religious groups, religious institutes, and religious activity sites in carrying out patriotic education activities, enhancing religious professionals’ and believers’ identification with the great motherland, the Chinese people, Chinese culture, the Chinese Communist Party, and socialism with Chinese characteristics,” the law states.\nAccording to Shen, who is also vice-chairman of the state-controlled Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA), the role of the Church is “to provide the explanations of theological classics, doctrines, and canons that align with the requirements of socialist core values.”\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome\nAsia Faith London / Europe Beijing Catholic Church Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Vatican",
