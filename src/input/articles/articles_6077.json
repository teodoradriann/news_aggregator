    "text": "Vehicles queuing at the Port of Dover in August 2023.\nTourists heading to Europe could face waits of up to 14 hours at border controls under a new scheme due to come in this October, MPs have been told.\nThe Port of Dover and the surrounding area could be hit by major disruption when the EU Entry-Exit System launches unless measures are introduced to prevent delays, parliament’s European scrutiny committee heard.\nAshford borough council, responsible for Dover, told the committee that 14-hour queues were a “reasonable worst case” scenario if the scheme is implemented as planned later this year.\nThe new controls will mean people entering the EU will have to register their fingerprints and a photograph alongside their passport.\nThe Port of Dover and surrounding roads have seen multiple episodes of gridlocked traffic over the past few years, with post-Brexit checks adding to waiting times.\nThe tourist organisation Visit Kent voiced concerns that delays caused by the new system could have a knock-on effect on local businesses, which has been the case during previous periods of disruption.\nAshford council said 14-hour delays at the port would likely lead to queues along the A20 and M20 that could block access to staff and tourist traffic at Eurotunnel in Folkestone.\nEurostar said that without upgrades, terminals could see queues of more than an hour at peak times. High Speed 1, which runs UK high-speed rail services, said the decision not to enable online pre-registration would “put enormous pressure on infrastructure at St Pancras International”.\nDowning Street sought to downplay the risks of delays. A No 10 spokesperson said: “On some of those scenarios, rightly we’re not going to get into hypotheticals about delays … but there are tried and tested contingency plans in place and a lot of work is managed by the Kent resilience forum so we will make sure we’re prepared and our focus remains on ensuring the scheme does not unnecessarily impact local communities or result in delays for travellers.\n“We are working very closely as you would expect with the French, with all the port authorities, to ensure that travellers and passengers do not experience unnecessary delays – that work continues.”\nThe chair of the committee, Sir Bill Cash, said: “Queues of more than 14 hours, vehicles backed up along major roads, businesses starved of footfall: this evidence paints an alarming picture of the possible risks surrounding the Entry-Exit System’s implementation.\n“Clearly, this policy could have a very serious impact, not only for tourists and travel operators but also for local businesses. I implore decision makers on both sides of the Channel to take note of this evidence.\n“The scheme is due to be implemented in October this year; the clock is ticking, and these issues must be urgently addressed.”",

    "text": "The conservative House Freedom Caucus voted this week to open a review into Rep. Warren Davidson’s (R-Ohio) standing in the group after he took the unprecedented step of endorsing the primary challenger to the group’s chair, Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), a source familiar with the matter told The Hill.\nA motion was made Tuesday evening for the group’s board to determine whether Davidson is a member in good standing of the Freedom Caucus, which comprises roughly three dozen hard-line Republicans, according to two sources familiar. The group then voted to send the motion to the Freedom Caucus board, according to one of the sources.\nRep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) made the motion, one of the sources and a third source familiar told The Hill.\nIf the board determines Davidson is a member not in good standing, then the threshold to remove him from the group decreases from 80 percent to 50 percent, two of the sources said.\nReached for comment, a spokesperson for the Freedom Caucus told The Hill the group does not comment on membership or internal processes.\nDavidson told The Hill, “I am not doing media on this topic,” when reached for comment, and sent a thread he posted Wednesday night on the social platform X explaining his endorsement against Good.\nDavidson earlier this month endorsed Good’s primary challenger John McGuire in the GOP primary for Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, an extraordinary move for a Freedom Caucus member to take against an incumbent and the leader of the group.\nMcGuire is currently leading Good by 0.6 percentage points, though Good has vowed to demand a recount in the race.\n“John McGuire is conservative and effective,” Davidson wrote in a statement. “He will work well with others to deliver conservative results.”\nDavidson defended his endorsement of McGuire Wednesday evening, writing on X: “I hope my endorsement for John McGuire made a difference and I look forward to serving alongside him in the 119th Congress to support President Trump’s efforts to Drain the Swamp.”\nThe bad blood between Davidson and Good is long-running.\nIn December, Davidson announced that he would not seek re-election to the Freedom Caucus Board after it recommended that Good be the next chairman of the conservative group.\n“I am concerned that our group often relies too much on power (available primarily due to the narrow majority) and too little on influence with and among our colleagues. This approach is not a strong foundation for success,” Davidson wrote in a letter to colleagues at the time, according to Axios . “For me these concerns culminate with the Board’s recommendation that Bob Good serve as the next Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.”",

    "text": "Hormone therapy was Sandra Mesic's saving grace when her [menopausal symptoms](https://www.dailyadvertiser.com.au/story/8410865/inquiry-to-examine-wide-ranging-impacts-of-menopause/) became \"horrible\". Now she hopes a new non-hormonal drug will help more women. Australian doctors will be able to prescribe menopausal women the pharmaceutical drug VEOZA from April 5 to treat hot flushes and night sweats that are known as vasomotor symptoms (VMS). Up to 80 per cent of women in menopausal transition will experience VMS. Sandra Mesic from Victoria was one of these women and described hot flushes as \"volcanic\" episodes that she experienced every hour. \"The heat comes from deep within, you can't escape it, it's horrible,\" the 52-year-old from Maldon said. \"Then at night, you're sweating profusely all night. There's no point even trying to sleep, you wake up and you're drenched.\" For years Ms Mesic battled with ineffective medication and experienced other symptoms including irritability, low moods, dryness, tinnitus and severe aches and pains. \"The worst for me was irritability, it's still a miracle that the people around me are still alive,\" she said. \"You're crying constantly, at every pin drop you start balling your eyes out.\" Unable to work and \"feel like a real human being\", Ms Mesic reduced her employment to part-time hours before seeking medical help from her doctor. There are limited treatments available for menopause with menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT) treatments the most common option. However, a significant proportion were unable to take menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT) due to a past history of breast cancer or other vulnerabilities including blood clotting. Other women are [unwilling to take MHT](https://www.dailyadvertiser.com.au/story/8544712/rethinking-menopause-less-medication-more-empowerment/) from personal preference. Ms Mesic went on MHT in July 2023 and said that improvements were instant allowed her to return to full-time work. \"Within three days, my brain just opened up and I was like, 'oh everything is nice,'\" she said. \"For me, the risk of not feeling well today was far greater than any risk associated with any treatment.\" She is a fierce advocate for [menopause awareness](https://www.dailyadvertiser.com.au/story/7987231/menopause-health-hubs-open-in-nsw/) and believes there are still stigmas and misconceptions among people her age and in the health industry. \"I remember going to one pharmacy and he had one box left, but it was down the bottom of this shelf in the corner behind a box. \"And I thought, oh what a great metaphor for women's health - shoved in a corner where nobody knows it exists,\" she said. Ms Mesic is hopeful the new menopause drug VEOZA might increase the options for women who can not take hormonal therapy. The drug owned by Japanese multi-national drug company Astellas is the first of its kind to be approved in Australia. It costs $59.99 per month in Australia and is a prescription-only drug. Head of the education sub-committee of the board of Australasian Menopause Society Dr Elina Safro welcomed the launch of VEOZA in Australia. \"It's a very different way of approaching the treatment which makes us excited and hopeful that it's going to have good uptake and good results,\" the GP said. Dr Safro works as a clinician in Dubbo and has many patients who are unable to receive hormonal therapy for their menopausal symptoms. Around 385,000 Australian women aged 40-64 years of age with moderate to severe VMS were not receiving treatment. \"It's very important for us to have as many treatment options as we can because no two women are the same,\" Dr Safro said. Due to cost pressures and misconceptions, some women sought off-the-shelf treatments. \"Unless it's been registered with the TGA and unless it's recommended as something that's effective and safe, we advise against women using those treatments,\" she said. VEOZA is also approved in the United States, the United Kingdom and in Europe. Individuals should speak with their doctor to discuss what treatment is right for them.
