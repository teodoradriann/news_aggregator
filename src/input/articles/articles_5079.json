    "text": "The National Weather Service’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) has issued a “severe geomagnetic storm watch,” the first such watch issued in nearly 20 years.\nAccording to the SWPC, this marks the first watch issued by the department since Jan. 2005. The watch comes after multiple earth-directed coronal mass ejections (CME’s) were observed by forecasters this week.\nLarge sunspot groups and strong solar flares led to the issuance of SWPC's first G4 Watch since 2005… pic.twitter.com/oi55cTPXhP\n— NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (@NWSSWPC) May 9, 2024 At least five CME’s have been observed in recent days, and the particles could begin arriving to Earth by Friday afternoon, according to officials. It’s expected that the CME’s could continue to arrive through Sunday, marking for an “unusual event.”\nOnly three “severe” geomagnetic storms have been observed since the current solar cycle began in Dec. 2019. The last G4 storm hit Earth in March, and the last G5 storm hit in Oct. 2003, causing power outages in Sweden, according to SWPC.\nCME’s are “large expulsions of plasma and magnetized particles from the Sun’s corona,” according to the SWPC. Those ejections can expand in size as they approach Earth, and can cause geomagnetic storms when they arrive.\nIn a geomagnetic storm, the particles ejected by the sun cause disturbances in Earth’s magnetosphere. Particularly strong storms can impact the Earth’s ionosphere, adding energy in the form of heat that can “increase the density and distribution of density in the upper atmosphere, causing extra drag on satellites in low Earth orbit,” according to the SWPC.\nA G4 (Severe) Geomagnetic Watch has been issued for May 11… pic.twitter.com/CeEHWEUFiQ\n— NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (@NWSSWPC) May 9, 2024 As a result, disruptions in navigation systems, radio communications and power grids are all possible, though it is unclear if the approaching storm will be strong enough to yield those impacts.\nAnother potential impact that could occur is a much-more vibrant Northern Lights spectacle, which could be seen as far south as Tennessee or even Alabama late Friday and into Saturday, according to officials.\nHowever, space weather forecasts can change dramatically in a matter of hours, with officials providing additional updates as the weekend draws closer.",

    "text": "Starwood Property Trust ( STWD Quick Quote STWD - Free Report ) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.46 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.58 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.35%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this commercial real estate investment trust would post earnings of $0.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.48, delivering a surprise of 4.35%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\nStarwood Property Trust , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust industry, posted revenues of $454.39 million for the quarter ended December 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.73%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $522.28 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nStarwood Property Trust shares have added about 5.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.3%.\nWhat's Next for Starwood Property Trust? While Starwood Property Trust has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nAhead of this earnings release , the estimate revisions trend for Starwood Property Trust: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.50 on $468 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.97 on $1.88 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust is currently in the bottom 34% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\nOne other stock from the same industry, ACRES Commercial ( ACR Quick Quote ACR - Free Report ) , is yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2024. The results are expected to be released on March 5.\nThis commercial real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -60%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nACRES Commercial's revenues are expected to be $10.2 million, down 23.7% from the year-ago quarter.",

    "title": "From Satan to the Sanction: What’s Wrong With Fiducia Supplicans",
    "text": "St. Paul was wrong! His first Letter to the Corinthians, the apostle not hiding his anger and frustration, is loaded with corrections to the neophyte Christian community. And here is Paul’s first complaint against them: It actually is reported that there is lewd conduct among you of a kind not even found among the pagans—a man living with his father’s wife. Still you continue to be satisfied, instead of grieving and getting rid of the offender! As for me, though absent in body I am present in spirit and have already passed sentence in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ on the man who did this deed. …I hand him over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord. …Expel the wicked man from your midst. Two thousand years later, according to a peculiar “development of doctrine,” the man expelled by Paul, and his mistress/stepmother, far from being excommunicated, may actually receive a priestly blessing as a couple in an “irregular union” according to the arguments and logic of Fiducia Supplicans (FS)—the formal declaration issued from the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith by Cardinal Victor Fernández with the approval of Pope Francis. If you think the reference to St. Paul’s discipline is hyperbolic—let us closely examine how the new declaration makes it possible, for the first time in the history of the Church, for priests to bless couples in objectively sinful relationships—including same-sex unions. [Economics in One Lesson](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005459Y?tag=lrc18-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1) Check Amazon for Pricing. In October of this year, Cardinal Fernández granted LifeSiteNews an interview which may be considered a prelude to the DDF’s December 18th declaration. In that interview, Fernández already defended the blessing of same-sex couples—and with language that nearly word for word is found in the declaration itself, namely: Blessing is a sign of the “opera pastorale” [pastoral work], to every people in every situation, and we [need to] know nothing [about] the people with how is his Christian life, the morals and other things [in order] to give the blessing. The declaration is very clear that “couples in irregular situations and same sex couples” may now receive a blessing. In 2021, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, as it was then called, issued a completely opposite statement! That year the CDF, under prefect Cardinal Luis F. Ladaria, S.J., responded to a dubium. To the question proposed: “Does the Church have the power to give the blessing to unions of persons of the same sex?” The response was: “Negative,” and Pope Francis approved of the response. “[I]t is not licit to impart a blessing on relationships, or partnerships, even stable, that involve sexual activity outside of marriage…as is the case of the unions between persons of the same sex.” And the ultimate reason why the Church cannot bless same-sex unions, according to the CDF, is because: “[God] does not and cannot bless sin.” How does FS justify a complete reversal of the 2021 CDF’s Responsum? First of all, FS states that it actually is “offering new clarifications” on the Responsum ad dubium published on February 22, 2021. However, this is Fernández’s sleight of hand, giving the impression that somehow the conclusions of the Responsum are respected, when in fact FS represents a radical departure—even a repudiation. In order to achieve its conclusion, FS doesn’t hide the fact, nor could it really hide the fact, that it is “a real development from what has been said about blessings in the Magisterium and the official texts of the Church,” with “new clarifications,” a “broadening …of the classical understanding of blessings”; and FS doesn’t shy away from even characterizing its “contribution” as “innovative.” FS is consistent with the 2021 Responsum in that FS bends over backward to ensure that in no way may the blessing of same-sex couples give the impression: “…that something that is not marriage is being recognized as marriage.” Therefore, rites and prayers that could create confusion between what constitutes marriage—which is the “exclusive, stable, and indissoluble union between a man and a woman, naturally open to the generation of children”—and what contradicts it are inadmissible. This conviction is grounded in the perennial Catholic doctrine of marriage; it is only in this context that sexual relations find their natural, proper, and fully human meaning. The Church’s doctrine on this point remains firm. This is also the understanding of marriage that is offered by the Gospel. For this reason, when it comes to blessings, the Church has the right and the duty to avoid any rite that might contradict this conviction or lead to confusion. Such is also the meaning of the Responsum of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which states that “the Church does not have the power to impart blessings on unions of persons of the same sex.” FS claims the reason the 2021 Responsum forbade blessing same-sex couples is because “the Church has the right and the duty to avoid any rite that might contradict [the Church’s teaching on marriage] or lead to confusion. In other words, FS makes it appear that the 2021 CDF statement banning such blessings was ultimately, if not solely, due to the danger of confusion. Thus, if that danger is removed, the way is open to permitting the blessing of “irregular unions.” [Christian Economics in...](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YJ4CRCF?tag=lrc18-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1) Best Price: $19.99 Buy New $13.95 (as of 12:37 UTC - Details) The innovation comes next. The danger is removed by developing a “broader understanding of blessings” according to “Pope Francis’ fatherly and pastoral approach.” FS justifies blessings for those in “irregular situations and same-sex couples” by arguing that there is a distinction between formal liturgical blessings and simple, pious, spontaneous blessings—noting that the 2021 Responsum indicated that “when a blessing is invoked on certain human relationships by a special liturgical rite, it is necessary that what is blessed corresponds with God’s designs written in creation and fully revealed by Christ the Lord.” Thus, such formal “liturgical blessings” may not be given to those whose lives do not correspond “with God’s designs written in creation and fully revealed by Christ the Lord.” It is article 12 that finalizes the argument: One must also avoid the risk of reducing the meaning of blessings to this point of view alone, for it would lead us to expect the same moral conditions for a simple blessing that are called for in the reception of the sacraments. Such a risk requires that we broaden this perspective further. Indeed, there is the danger that a pastoral gesture that is so beloved and widespread will be subjected to too many moral prerequisites, which, under the claim of control, could overshadow the unconditional power of God’s love that forms the basis for the gesture of blessing. In a strained and tortured argument, Fernández and the pope have created a new category of blessings by which couples living in situations that are objectively sinful may receive a priestly blessing. Retired Professor of Theology [Larry Chapp](https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2023/12/19/the-ddfs-innovative-declaration-on-blessings-is-a-disaster/) explains that all blessings bestowed by a priest have: …an inherent orientation to the liturgical and sacramental life of the Church. Indeed, is this not why people want a priest to bless them, their houses, and their devotional objects in the first place? I could ask any random lay person to bless those things “in the name of Christ Jesus.” But we seek out instead priests to make such blessings because of his sacramental character as one possessing Holy Orders, which in turn is what links him to Christ and all of the other sacraments in a preeminent way. In other words, we seek out priestly blessings because we rightly sense the full weight of the Church, in all of her sacramental glory, behind those blessings. Thus, all priestly blessings are inherently sacramental and liturgical in a real way. Distinguishing between blessings with a liturgical/sacramental orientation and those without one might seem to make a useful pastoral distinction, but it is a distinction that smacks of a clever theological parlor room trick rather than of a genuine theological development. Cardinal Fernández calls it a development of doctrine, but it is not evident how this constitutes a true and organic development of the doctrines concerning blessings instead of just some slight-of-hand [sic] in order to achieve a predetermined result.",

    "title": "First Alert Weather: Sunshine and above average temperatures Sunday afternoon",
    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. ( WBRC ) - Good morning and happy Sunday! Temperatures are slightly warmer compared to Saturday morning. Most of us are starting out in the low to mid 50s. I recommend a light jacket for the morning hours. By 10-11 a.m. CDT, you’ll likely won’t need it as temperatures rapidly warm into the 70s. First Alert AccuTrack Satellite and Radar is showing us clear and dry. High pressure is moving off to the east and will provide us with a southwest wind today at 5-10 mph with gusts up to 15 mph. The southerly component to the wind will warm us into the mid 80s this afternoon. It is possible that parts of west Alabama could warm into the mid to upper 80s. Temperatures this afternoon will likely end up five to ten degrees above average for October 13th. I doubt we will tie or break any record highs this afternoon. Most of the records are around 89°F-90°F. We will likely remain sunny this afternoon with a few clouds possible late this evening and tonight as a cold front approaches Central Alabama. If you have any evening plans, we should remain mostly clear with temperatures cooling into the lower 70s by 7 p.m. CDT. It’ll be perfect weather to cheer on Legion Soccer this evening at Protective Stadium.\nBarber Vintage Festival (wbrcnews) Cooling down Monday: We want to give everyone a first alert for cooler temperatures Monday afternoon! A cold front will move through Alabama tonight into Monday morning. We may see a few clouds move through early Monday morning, but we will likely see plenty of sunshine and blue sky in the afternoon hours. Temperatures will likely start out in the upper 50s tomorrow morning. Monday will likely end up cooler than today with highs in the low to mid 70s. It’ll likely be a breezy day as drier air moves into the state. Winds will likely come from the northwest at 10-15 mph with isolated gusts up to 20 mph.\nTropical Update (wbrcnews) Next Big Thing: The big story this week is that temperatures will likely trend well below average. We will likely see morning temperatures cool into the upper 40s Tuesday morning with afternoon highs in the upper 60s and lower 70s. Another round of cooler air will move into Alabama Tuesday afternoon giving us a partly cloudy sky. The coolest temperatures this week will likely occur Wednesday into Thursday morning.\nHigh Temperatures (wbrcnews) We want to give everyone a first alert for the potential to see patchy frost Wednesday and Thursday mornings. Temperatures will likely drop into the upper 30s and lower 40s. Patchy frost will become more likely for areas north of Birmingham. It will not surprise me if some locations drop in the mid 30s along and north of Hwy 278. If you are worried about sensitive plants, I would highly recommend covering them up or bringing them inside Tuesday evening and again Wednesday evening. High temperatures will likely remain in the mid to upper 60s Wednesday and Thursday. By the end of the week, we should see plenty of sunshine with high temperatures warming into the 70s with lows in the mid to upper 40s Friday and Saturday. No sign of rain over the next five to seven days.\nTropical Update: The Atlantic is thankfully very quiet at the moment. Leslie dissipated in the Central Atlantic, and the only system worth watching is a weak tropical wave located in the eastern Atlantic. Odds for development has lowered to 20% for the next seven days. Long-range models hint that this low will remain weak for the first half of the week as it pushes off to the west. There’s a chance that it could try to develop by next weekend as it approaches the Lesser Antilles, Hispaniola, and possibly Cuba. It remains too early to know if it could impact the United States. For now, rest easy knowing that the tropics remain quiet for the United States over the next seven days. The next name up on the 2024 Hurricane list is “Nadine”. Hurricane season officially ends December 1.\nMake sure you download the WBRC First Alert Weather app on Android and Apple devices for the latest weather information.\nGet news alerts in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or subscribe to our email newsletter here .\nCopyright 2024 WBRC.

    "title": "Netanyahu boccia la tregua. Gli Usa delusi: \"Aveva dato l'ok\". Ancora bombe sul Libano, ucciso il capo dei droni di Hezbollah - Gazzetta del Sud",
    "text": "Non ci sono spiragli, almeno al momento, per una tregua in Libano. La proposta americana e francese di uno stop di 21 giorni delle ostilità, sostenuta dall’Ue e altri Paesi, è stata respinta da Benyamin Netanyahu, che secondo Washington prima avrebbe accettato il cessate il fuoco ma poi ha ordinato di insistere con gli attacchi contro le postazioni di Hezbollah. Il risultato, l’ennesima ondata di raid ed un nuovo blitz mirato a Beirut, per eliminare il comandante sciita responsabile degli attacchi con i droni. L’iniziativa diplomatica sul Libano ha avuto un’accelerazione dopo che i vertici dell’esercito israeliano hanno annunciato i preparativi per un’incursione via terra. Un’escalation che secondo Joe Biden rischia di portare ad un conflitto su larga scala in Medio Oriente. Il presidente americano ha incontrato il collega francese Emmanuel Macron a margine dell’Assemblea Generale dell’Onu per concordare una strategia. In una dichiarazione congiunta i due leader hanno chiesto «un accordo sul confine tra Israele e Libano che garantisca sicurezza e protezione per consentire ai civili di tornare alle loro case». Il piano - sottoscritto anche da Regno Unito, Ue, Italia, Germania, Australia, Canada, Giappone, Arabia Saudita, Emirati e Qatar - prevede un cessate il fuoco di tre settimane per dare spazio a negoziati più ampi, anche su Gaza. Le speranze di una pausa nelle ostilità si sono però infrante sul muro di Netanyahu. Il premier israeliano, arrivato a New York per intervenire all’Onu, non ha neanche risposto all’appello di Usa e Francia, come ha fatto sapere il suo ufficio. Anzi, appena messo piede a terra dopo il viaggio, ha affermato perentorio che «continueremo a colpire Hezbollah con tutta la forza finché non riporteremo i residenti del nord nelle loro case». Una decisione accolta con malcelata irritazione dalla Casa Bianca, che in serata ha puntualizzato attraverso la portavoce Karine Jean-Pierre che la dichiarazione comune per il cessate il fuoco era stata «coordinata» proprio con Israele. Il voltafaccia dell’ultimo minuto, con concessioni offerte e poi ritirate, è una tattica che Netanyahu ha già adottato nel corso del conflitto a Gaza. E così come ha promesso di fare nella Striscia, il leader israeliano ha annunciato di voler andare fino in fondo anche in Libano, per smantellare definitivamente Hezbollah. Bibi, inoltre, è sembrato scommettere ancora una volta sul fatto che gli Usa, al momento delle scelte di campo, si sono sempre schierati con lo Stato ebraico. Come dimostra l’ennesimo e ingente pacchetto da 8,7 miliardi di dollari in aiuti militari. Il leader israeliano, per andare fino in fondo contro Hezbollah, considera necessaria un’ulteriore prova di forza. In questa direzione, l’Idf ha fatto sapere di aver condotto un’esercitazione con una brigata di carri armati «a pochi chilometri dal confine libanese, in un terreno montuoso» per \"migliorare la prontezza operativa e logistica per vari scenari di combattimento in territorio nemico sul fronte settentrionale\": ancora una volta, prove generali di invasione. Nel frattempo, per il quarto giorno consecutivo l’aviazione ha bombardato con intensità il Libano, affermando di aver centrato 75 obiettivi militari di Hezbollah nel sud e nella valle della Bekaa, fino al confine con la Siria. Nella capitale libanese invece è stato preso di mira Mohammed Surur, a capo delle unità aeree della fazione. Un altro pezzo grosso dell’élite militare del Partito di Dio, che era stato inviato in Yemen per addestrare gli Houthi nei raid con i droni. Secondo fonti dell’Idf, Surur è stato ucciso. Dal Libano verso Israele invece sono stati lanciati in un solo giorno circa 150 razzi, arrivati fino ad Haifa e alla città di Safad. Il bilancio delle vittime nel Paese dei cedri ha continuato a crescere. Soltanto giovedì, secondo le autorità libanesi, sono state uccise 81 persone, inclusa una cittadina francese di 87 anni, nel crollo di un palazzo. Sono oltre 700 le vittime da lunedì. Un dramma nel quale l’Ue ha «deplorato il pesante prezzo pagato dai civili, compresi i bambini e il personale delle Nazioni Unite». Disastrosa anche la situazione degli sfollati, arrivati a centomila.",
