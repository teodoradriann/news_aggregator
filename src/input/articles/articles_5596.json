    "text": "Estado de salud del papa Francisco preocupa a los jóvenes en Panamá\nDesde antes de su elección como sumo pontífice, Francisco ha trabajado de cerca con los jóvenes, haciéndolos sentir parte fundamental de la Iglesia.\nCiudad de Panamá/La preocupación por el estado de salud del\npapa Francisco incrementó a nivel mundial tras confirmarse que sufre de neumonía bilateral. A pesar de sus diversos problemas de salud en los últimos años, el pontífice ha mantenido su ritmo de trabajo y ha dejado en claro que no tiene intención de reducir su actividad.\nEn Panamá, jóvenes vinculados a la Iglesia que han tenido la oportunidad de estar cerca del santo padre siguen con atención su estado de salud y resaltan el impacto de sus mensajes. Para ellos, el papa Francisco ha sabido conectar con las nuevas generaciones a través de su lenguaje cercano y su presencia en redes sociales.\n“Sus mensajes han sido de conectar, de volver a una esencia de fe que conecta con la parte social y con el pobre en la misericordia\", comentó Orlando Sánchez, quien participó en la Jornada Mundial de la Juventud (JMJ) celebrada en Panamá en 2019.\n🔗Podría leer:\nEl papa 'no está fuera de peligro' y permanecerá hospitalizado al menos diez días más\nPor su parte, el diácono permanente Boris Cruz señaló al papa como un promotor de la cercanía con los jóvenes, alentándolos a ser valientes y a no tener miedo. “Su manera y sus expresiones son más aterrizadas al nivel de los jóvenes”, expresó.\nDesde antes de su elección como sumo pontífice, Francisco ha trabajado de cerca con los jóvenes, haciéndolos sentir parte fundamental de la Iglesia.\nSu presencia en redes sociales, con su cuenta oficial @Franciscus, también ha sido clave para conectar con la juventud. A través de estas plataformas, comparte sus reflexiones que son replicadas a nivel mundial en diferentes plataformas.\nEn los últimos años, el máximo líder de la Iglesia católica ha sufrido de dolores en la cadera, la rodilla y varias infecciones respiratorias, pero aun así ha mantenido una agenda activa a sus 88 años.\nCon información de Jorge Quirós",
