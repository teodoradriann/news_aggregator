    "text": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams designated social media as a “public health hazard” and an environmental toxin, as his city struggles with crime and a surge in illegal immigrants, in a speech on Wednesday.\nAdams claimed that platforms like TikTok and YouTube are “fueling a mental health crisis by designing their platforms with addictive and dangerous features” and bragged about leading the first city to treat social media like “tobacco and guns.” The mayor chose to take on social media while his city struggles to deal with the more than 150,000 migrants that have arrived since spring 2022 and increasing violent crime , like the more than 4,500 stabbings in 2023.\nAdams’ health department issued an official advisory designating social media as an “environmental toxin,” according to the mayor’s Twitter account. (RELATED: NYC Mayor’s Campaign Paid Almost $300K To Former Fundraiser Who Was Raided By FBI)\nIn a post to social media, the mayor compared social media to cigarettes.\nSocial media companies are fueling a mental health crisis, especially for our young people. But we won’t let Big Tech endanger our kids. @NYCHealthCommr Vasan is today issuing an advisory officially designating social media as an environmental toxin in New York City. #SOTC2024 pic.twitter.com/8Rddkzr1hM\n— Mayor Eric Adams (@NYCMayor) January 24, 2024\nWhile Adams rails against social media, some crimes are on the rise in New York and the city is facing budget issues stemming from its ongoing migrant crisis.\nStabbings, assaults and grand larceny all increased in New York City between 2022 and 2023, Fox 5 New York reported . While homicides decreased from 438 murders in 2022 to 386 in 2023, the total remains above the pre-pandemic figure of 318 homicides, according to Reuters.\nAs crime rises in some areas, Adams is cutting the New York Police Department’s budget, the New York Post reported . Cuts to the police budget are the result of the ongoing costs of providing for illegal immigrants in the city.\nThe city estimates that accommodating these migrants will cost $12 billion over the next three years.\nThe city has cut funding for trash removal, libraries and public safety, among other things, as it copes with the costs of the migrant crisis, Politico reported .\nThe migrant crisis has fed into the city’s ongoing homelessness crisis, according to the NYT. There were more than 92,000 homeless people in New York City as of November 2023.\nAdams’ problems extend beyond handling the various dilemmas facing his city.\nNew York’s mayor is being investigated by federal authorities in connection with allegations that he worked with the Turkish government to steer foreign donations into his campaign account.\nThe mayor’s office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

It’s going to be two years since I last wore the India colours and there’ve been a lot of learnings for me in this tour which had a combination of young players and those who have played for India,” said Karthi.\nThe India ‘A’ side under Coach and former India striker Shivendra Singh, began the tour with back-to-back wins against Ireland (6-1 and 6-0) followed by a win and a loss against France (3-2 and 2-0).\nWhile their match against England was close (2-3), India ‘A’ lost 1-3 to Belgium, and suffered 0-3 and 2-8 loss against the Netherlands. “We started the tour very well and the match against England was also quite close. But we couldn’t finish the tour on a high with the Netherlands posing stiff competition. Overall, it was a top experience for us,” he said.\nSpeaking about his own game, Karthi said, “There have been some specific inputs that Craig (Fulton) has given me and also Cosma, our Analytical Coach, has provided valuable inputs for my game particularly on off-the-ball tactics. I’ve been implementing this in my game and look forward to breaking into the India side again,” added Karthi.\nThe India ‘A’ side has returned to their base in SAI, Bengaluru where they will join the Senior India players for the remainder of the national camp.\nThere have been some specific inputs that Craig (Fulton) has given me, and also Cosma, our Analytical Coach, has provided valuable inputs for my game particularly on off-the-ball tactics",

    "text": "World Network's Latest Innovations Set to Transform Identity Systems [Logan Wright](https://investorshangout.com/profile/view?id=79745)Updated: 10-17-2024 04:48 PM World Network's Exciting New Developments At a recent event in San Francisco, World Network, previously known as Worldcoin, enthralled attendees with a series of groundbreaking updates aimed at revolutionizing how identities are verified and utilized. Co-founders Sam Altman and Alex Blania hosted this exclusive gathering where they showcased innovative technologies poised to enhance user experiences in a rapidly changing digital landscape. As artificial intelligence evolves, these advancements empower individuals while fostering systems that prioritize collective benefits. Revolutionary Updates Unveiled The event launched several key updates that promise to redefine the World Network experience. Let’s take a closer look at what was disclosed. Next-Generation Orb: Redefining Human Verifications One of the standout presentations featured the unveiling of the latest Orb device, which amplifies the efficiency and scalability of World ID verifications. This revolutionary gadget, utilizing the new NVIDIA Jetson chipset, offers nearly five times the AI capabilities of its predecessor. Remarkably, its design simplifies the verification process with a 30 percent reduction in components while incorporating a removable external SD card to facilitate complete auditability. This next-generation Orb advances verification models, including flagship locations, on-demand devices, and self-service kiosks, thereby speeding up the global deployment of human verification processes. Introducing World ID 3.0 for Enhanced Privacy The launch of World ID 3.0 marks a significant milestone in user credentialing. The new features allow individuals to store details from their NFC-enabled passports on their devices securely. This facilitates age, nationality, or ownership verification without exposing full identities. Moreover, World ID 3.0 incorporates Advanced Multiparty Computation (AMPC) and the newly developed World ID Deep Face, tools designed to bolster online security and tackle fraudulent activities in digital interactions. The All-New World App 3.0 World Network introduced the revamped World App 3.0, a platform engineered to grow alongside the network's expanse. Supporting Mini Apps, this redesign allows third-party developers to integrate seamlessly with World ID, Wallet, and Contacts, all while preserving user anonymity. With additional wallet functionalities like Vault and World Pay, the app enhances both utility and security for its users. Official Launch of the World Chain Mainnet Amongst the most anticipated announcements was the launch of the World Chain mainnet. The transition of over 15 million World ID holders and app users signifies a major milestone. World Chain is unique as it is the first blockchain dedicated to prioritizing human activity and transaction efficiency. Supported by top-tier blockchain services such as Optimism and Uniswap, this initiative promises robust infrastructural support for a global user base. Worldcoin Transitions to World Network The rebranding of Worldcoin to World Network signifies a strategic shift reflecting the project's ambitious vision to drive progress for humanity. This evolution emphasizes three core components: World Chain, World ID, and World Network itself—a network engineered to ensure that human needs remain central in AI development. The Vision and Mission of World Network World Network, founded by thought leaders such as Sam Altman, Alex Blania, and Max Novendstern, aspires to create the most inclusive identity and financial public utility accessible to all. Aiming to foster a global alliance of developers, economists, and technologists, this initiative is spearheaded by the World Foundation. Their overarching goal is to drive participation and accessibility in economic systems worldwide. About Tools for Humanity Another pivotal player in this landscape is Tools for Humanity (TFH), a global technology entity committed to nurturing a fair economic system. TFH paved the way for World Network's initial development and continues to manage the World App independently from the World Foundation. The organization envisions crafting essential tools that will support the World Network's mission as it grows, spearheading advancements that align with socio-economic fairness. Frequently Asked Questions What are the key updates introduced by World Network? The major updates include the Next-Generation Orb, World ID 3.0, the revamped World App 3.0, and the launch of the World Chain mainnet. What is the purpose of the new Orb device? The new Orb is designed to enhance human verification efficiency and scalability, offering advanced AI performance and simplified design. How does World ID 3.0 improve user privacy? World ID 3.0 allows users to store crucial identity information while availing stronger privacy features, making verification safer and more secure. What does the rebranding to World Network mean? This transition signifies a broader vision focusing on collaborative development and human-centric technological growth for the future. Who oversees the development of World Network? World Network is directed by the World Foundation, which collaborates with various global stakeholders to foster economic participation and inclusivity.

    "title": "Brasil tem menor número de pessoas em busca de trabalho em uma década e taxa de desemprego bate mínima Por Reuters",
    "text": "Por Camila Moreira e Rodrigo Viga Gaier\nSÃO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - O Brasil registrou uma taxa de desemprego de 6,2% no trimestre até outubro, batendo a mínima recorde da série histórica iniciada em 2012 e com o menor número de pessoas em busca de trabalho em uma década, evidenciando continuidade de um mercado de trabalho aquecido.\nO resultado divulgado nesta sexta-feira pelo Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) mostrou baixa ante a taxa de 6,8% do trimestre imediatamente anterior, até julho, e dos 7,6% vistos no mesmo período do ano passado.\nO dado ainda ficou em linha com a expectativa em pesquisa da Reuters.\n\"O momento do mercado de trabalho, pelos indicadores que temos, dá para dizer que é uma fase muito consistente, é o melhor momento e com uma diversidade de bons dados e números\", disse a coordenadora da pesquisa, Adriana Beriguy.\n“Os fatores econômicos, bens, serviços, produção justificam essa taxa recorde. A melhora vem se dando tanto nas atividades ligadas à produção quanto em serviços e demanda\", disse, ressaltando que o resultado pode estar ligado também às festas de fim de ano.\nUm mercado de trabalho aquecido, com taxa de desemprego muito baixa, levanta pontos positivos e negativos. Se por um lado o maior número de pessoas ocupadas favorece a atividade econômica, por outro complica o controle da inflação, destacadamente com a pressão sobre os preços dos serviços.\nNo início do mês, o Banco Central elevou a taxa básica de juros Selic em 0,5 ponto percentual, a 11,25%, e deve realizar novo aumento no início de dezembro, em meio a um cenário inflacionário desafiador, atividade econômica sólida e graves preocupações fiscais.\nNos três meses até outubro, o número de desempregados alcançou 6,839 milhões, uma queda de 8,0% ante o trimestre imediatamente anterior e de 17,2% sobre o mesmo período de 2023. Esse é menor número de pessoas desocupadas desde o trimestre encerrado em dezembro de 2014.\nO total de ocupados atingiu novo recorde, de 103,6 milhões, o que representa alta de 1,5% na comparação trimestral e de 3,4% na base anual.\nOs trabalhadores com carteira assinada no setor privado somavam 39,021 milhões no trimestre até outubro, também recorde e um aumento de 1,2% sobre os três meses imediatamente anteriores.\nOs que não tinham carteira aumentaram 3,7%, para 14,4 milhões, outro recorde da pesquisa, o que elevou a taxa de informalidade a 38,9% --isso equivale a 40,3 milhões de trabalhadores informais, o maior contingente da série iniciada em 2016.\n\"A recorrente expansão da ocupação em 2024 tem gerado esses recordes\", destacou Beringuy.\nTrês dos dez grupamentos de atividade avaliados na PNAD Contínua do IBGE puxaram a alta da ocupação em relação ao trimestre de maio a julho. A população ocupada na indústria cresceu 2,9%, na construção houve aumento de 2,4% e o número de trabalhadores em outros serviços subiu 3,4%. Juntas, as três ganharam mais 751 mil trabalhadores no trimestre até outubro.\nNo período, a renda chegou a 3.255 reais, uma alta de 0,8% sobre os três meses imediatamente anteriores e de 3,9% sobre o mesmo período do ano passado.",

    "text": "Canada defender Vanessa Gilles insisted her team were \"not cheats\" despite a spying scandal before their 2-1 opening win over New Zealand in the Olympic women's football competition on Thursday.\nAssistant coach Jasmine Mander and analyst Joey Lombardi were sent home from the Games in Paris on Wednesday.\nLombardi was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session in Saint-Etienne in the build-up to the match.\nFIFA has since opened disciplinary proceedings against Canada. \"Honestly, it wasn't easy,\" Gilles told reporters. \"There was a lot of emotion, frustration and humiliation because as a player, it doesn't reflect our values and what we want to represent as competitors at the Olympics.\n\"The Games represent fair play. As Canadians, these are not our values or those of our country. We are not cheats. It was very hard but we knew how to be united.\"\nCanada are defending their Olympic title in Paris after defeating Sweden to win gold in Tokyo three years ago.\n\"It's up to us to stay together and try not to let social media and the press break into our bubble,\" added on-loan Lyon defender Gilles. \"We've been able to do that in the past.\"\nHead coach Bev Priestman also took no part in the game after the controversy, but is expected to be back on the bench for Canada's second Group A match against France on Sunday.\n\"She took a step back from this match and left the bench to her assistants but for the next matches, she should take her place again,\" said Gilles.\nGoals from Arsenal forward Cloe Lacasse and Evelyne Viens helped Canada come from behind to win.\nNew Zealand coach Michael Mayne refused to blame the spying incident on his side's loss.\n\"I don't want to make excuses for this result,\" he said. \"But, yes, we are disappointed. There is the question of how this happened and the reasons that led to this situation.\n\"Yes, maybe it influenced part of the game. We wanted to play and we did our best.\"\nNew Zealand next face Colombia on Sunday, needing to avoid defeat to give their quarter-final hopes a boost.\nTags: Canada New Zealand Olympic Vanessa Gilles Want to send us a story?
