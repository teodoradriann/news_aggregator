    "text": "Lula afirma que golpistas do 8/1 ‘nem foram julgados e já querem anistia’ Presidente diz que é preciso apurar todas as denúncias e que um tempo na cadeia pode ajudar essas pessoas a aprender sobre a democracia O presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva disse nesta quinta-feira (27) que acusados de participar dos atos golpistas de 8 de janeiro estão pedindo anistia antes de serem julgados. O pedido de perdão aos suspeitos é uma bandeira do ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro. [+ Lula sanciona taxação de compras internacionais de até US$ 50 e programa de incentivo a veículos sustentáveis](https://sbtnews.sbt.com.br/noticia/politica/lula-sanciona-taxacao-de-compras-internacionais-de-ate-us-50-e-programa-de-incentivo-a-veiculos-sustentaveis) Lula comentou que, no passado, lutou pelo direito à anistia, mas acredita que discutir o tema, no momento, é precipitado. Segundo o presidente, é preciso que os processos e as investigações cheguem ao fim para, depois, debater a possibilidade de um perdão aos envolvidos na tentativa de golpe. Ainda segundo o presidente, é necessário “dar a essas pessoas o que elas merecem”, pois um tempo na cadeia pode ajudá-las a aprender sobre a democracia. “Não dá para precipitar essa discussão de anistia. Temos que terminar de uma vez por toda apurar todas as denúncias do 8 de janeiro e quando todo mundo estiver preso ou livre de processo você pode até perdoar pessoas presas há muito tempo. Eu passei parte da minha vida lutando pela anistia, eu não vou ser contra, mas nesse caso eles nem foram condenados ainda, a gente nem sabe todos aqueles que praticam o golpe. É preciso que a sociedade saiba quem é que tentou dar golpe neste país”, disse o presidente da República em entrevista à rádio Itatiaia. [+ Lula diz que quem apostar na alta do dólar vai “quebrar a cara”](https://sbtnews.sbt.com.br/noticia/economia/lula-diz-que-quem-apostar-no-enfraquecimento-do-real-e-na-alta-do-dolar-vai-quebrar-a-cara) Lula ainda criticou o ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro ao falar que, quando assumiu a Presidência, o Brasil “parecia a Faixa de Gaza” e citou que instituições de governo estavam “totalmente destruídas”. O petista acredita que seu governo conseguiu melhorar as condições do país. \"Estamos em um momento extraordinário [...], nós avançamos muito. Se o povo soubesse como pegamos esse país, nós pegamos esse país como se fosse uma Faixa de Gaza, totalmente destruído. E estamos recuperando este país”, disse. “Não tinha Ministério indígena, da Cultura, da Pesca. Nós recompusemos os ministérios. Porque a Cultura é a coisa mais importante neste país. Um povo sem cultura não é povo, é rebanho”, disse.",

    "title": "Bengaluru startup fires fresher via text, \"I'm wondering if I was set up for failure by...\" - Times of India",
    "text": "A young software developer in Bengaluru was abruptly terminated from his first full-time job after just 2.5 months, highlighting growing concerns about workplace practices in startup environments. The developer, who had six months of internship experience, was hired as a frontend developer but quickly found himself overwhelmed by unexpected full-stack responsibilities.In a detailed account shared on Reddit's \\\"DevelopersIndia\\\" community, the developer revealed the challenges he faced during his short tenure. \\\"In the first week, I was assigned a project where 70% of the tasks were backend-related,\\\" he explained, admitting he had no prior experience in backend development. Despite his willingness to learn, the workload became increasingly unmanageable.Communication became a critical issue as the developer navigated his challenging role. \\\"I conveyed every problem I faced in the project's Slack channel, as instructed,\\\" he shared. The response was inconsistent - sometimes receiving feedback, often left in silence. Pull request reviews dragged on for 3-4 days, creating significant workflow disruptions.The termination came suddenly via a text message from a board member, leaving the young professional feeling \\\"confused and defeated.\\\" He was given no prior warning and no opportunity to explain his perspective. \\\"They said they couldn't continue with me, without prior warning or an opportunity to explain my side,\\\" he shared.Left feeling lost and questioning his professional trajectory, the developer reflected on the experience. \\\"I'm wondering if I was set up for failure by being assigned tasks I wasn't experienced enough to handle,\\\" he said.Online reactions were swift and sympathetic. \\\"This wasn't your fault. It's a poor reflection on the company's management,\\\" one Reddit user commented. Another suggested, \\\"Startups can be chaotic; always clarify job roles before joining.\\\"Some commenters pointed to broader industry issues. \\\"Unfortunately, some startups exploit freshers to cut costs. This seems like a case of unrealistic expectations,\\\" one user noted. Others offered supportive advice: \\\"Don't let this setback define you. Use this as a learning opportunity.\\\"",

    "text": "With its best five players in Brooklyn Wednesday night, the Long Island Nets had a limited roster to face the Wisconsin Herd and lost, 114-82, at Nassau Coliseum. The Nets three two-ways, Jalen Wilson (21), Armoni Brooks (12) and Keon Johnson (12,) combined for 45 points while Brooklyn’s two first round picks, Noah Clowney (14) and Dariq Whitehead (2) combined for 16. But back in Uniondale, the G League Nets got hammered, their roster falling to nine players after the NBA Nets called everyone up to play the Herd’s parent club, the [Milwaukee Bucks](https://www.brewhoop.com). Long Island was led by Nets guard Kyler Edwards as he posted 17 points, one rebound, two assists and five steals in 37 minutes. Long Island guard Kennedy Chandler notched 16 points, five rebounds, six assists and one steal in 32 minutes. Nets forward Jordan Hall recorded 15 points, three rebounds, three assists and one steal in 30 minutes. The two teams got off to an even start in the first quarter, until consecutive dunks by Wisconsin forward — and one-time Brooklyn big — Wenyen Gabriel allowed the Herd to sneak past the Nets. Long Island closed the period down by 10, 29-19. Long Island worked hard to close the gap in the second quarter, but Wisconsin’s defense created some difficulty for the Nets. The Herd kept their lead and went into halftime ahead by 15, 60-45. Wisconsin outscored Long Island 23-18 in the third quarter while outrebounding the Nets 16-10. The Herd went into the final period ahead by 20, 83-63. Long Island struggled to string baskets together in the fourth quarter, as the Herd continued to outscore the Nets 31-19 in the period. Wisconsin went on to defeat Long Island by 32, 114-82. Gabriel recorded a double-double with 21 points and 14 rebounds to go along with two assists and one block in 28 minutes. Herd forward Elijah Hughes tallied 17 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block in 27 minutes. Long Island will travel to Cleveland to face the Charge on Friday, at 7:00 p.m. ET. All five of the call-ups — the three two-ways and the two first round picks — will be in Ohio with Long Island.",

    "title": "Not drinking this New Year's Eve? Local Christian nonprofit hosts sober celebration at Zera Coffee | Entertainment | dentonrc.com",
    "text": "For 1,500 years, people have been toasting the New Year with alcohol. It was first recorded during the reign of the Roman dictator Julius Caesar and became an American tradition when European settlers [started arriving in North America](https://imbibemagazine.com/why-we-drink-champagne-on-new-years-eve/). In Colonial times in the U.S., New Year’s Eve became a time when young women would make a large bowl of wassail, a spiced ale, and would take it door to door and offer it to people in exchange for a gift. But nowadays, finding a New Year’s Eve celebration without alcohol is difficult for those recovering from addiction, especially in Denton where it often feels like the bars may outnumber the churches. It’s one of the reasons the Denton Freedom House, a local nonprofit focused on addiction recovery, started the annual “Jesus Jam” New Year’s Eve event at the Zera Coffee to offer a celebration free from temptation. This year’s Jesus Jam celebration will not only offer an alcohol-free environment for a family-friendly evening, but also a chili cook-off, games both for adults and children and live music from Freedom Song, a band made up of alumni from the Denton Freedom House program. The event kicks off at 7 p.m. and lasts until midnight. There is a $10 cover charge for food and a raffle ticket for items donated by local businesses. “Because Jesus and freedom from addiction are at the core of what we do, Jesus Jam remains a sober- and faith-filled event to celebrate New Year’s with others,” Jason Young, a development associate from Denton Freedom House, wrote in a Dec. 12 press release. This freedom-from-addiction mission, Young said, began nearly 20 years ago in Denton. Originally from Waco, Young was one of those people who sought recovery at Denton Freedom House. Young’s addiction had landed him in jail, and he contacted the Denton Freedom House for help. “I wanted to get sober,” Young said. “I was addicted to pain medicine and alcohol and needed a place to go when I got out of jail.” Most people with substance-use disorder [don’t receive treatment](https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2023-01-06-survey-most-americans-substance-use-disorders-dont-receive-treatment#:~:text=Survey%3A%20Most%20Americans%20with%20substance%20use%20disorders%20don't%20receive%20treatment,-Jan%2006%2C%202023&text=Over%2046%20million%20Americans%20aged,of%20Drug%20Use%20and%20Health.), according to the American Hospital Association. But Young started the addiction treatment program at Denton Freedom House in 2019. Three years later, Young had graduated from the program, served as a volunteer and then became a full-time staff member helping others who struggled with addiction. According to the AHA, 46 million Americans aged 12 and older were living with a substance abuse disorder in 2021. Young said the Jesus Jam New Year’s Eve celebration is just one of several events that Denton Freedom House hosts throughout the year. The event was free in previous years. However, this year a charge of $10 was added to cover the costs of the drinks, hot dogs and other snacks that will be available. A raffle ticket is also included. It’s similar to how the Denton Freedom House operates Zera Coffee. Known as “Coffee with a Cause,” the coffee sold at the Zera is a way that Young said the nonprofit generates funds for the program as well as teach those who seek help there “ [to become prosperous](https://dentonfreedomhouse.org/zera-coffee-and-event-center/) disciples of Christ in a sober and healthy workplace.\" “It’s that theme of Christianity and helping that community,” Young said. “This is just one of the events and the close-out event.” Wake Up with the DR-C: Get today's headlines in your inbox Success!

    "text": "Un processore AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D (di cui abbiamo pubblicato la recensione pochi giorni fa) si è bruciato insieme al socket AM5 della scheda madre, causando danni irreparabili a entrambi i componenti. L'incidente è stato segnalato su Reddit dall'utente TrumpPooPoosPants, che ha condiviso le immagini del processore danneggiato.\nIl Ryzen 7 9800X3D è attualmente considerato il processore più veloce per il gaming, ed è molto richiesto sul mercato. Questo è il primo caso segnalato di un simile danneggiamento per questo modello, con l'utente che ha riferito che il PC non si avviava e, dopo un'ispezione, ha scoperto che sia la CPU che diversi pin dorati del socket AM5 della scheda madre MSI MAG X870 Tomahawk risultavano bruciati.\nLe cause esatte dell'incidente non sono ancora chiare. Alcuni utenti su Reddit hanno ipotizzato che potrebbe trattarsi di un errore durante l'installazione del processore, notando che i pin sembrano piegati e il socket danneggiato su un lato. Altri hanno suggerito che la scheda madre potrebbe aver inviato voltaggi eccessivi attraverso i contatti dorati.\nAMD ha avuto problemi simili in passato con il Ryzen 7 7800X3D, un altro processore con tecnologia 3D V-Cache, che si era bruciato su una scheda madre ASUS X670 a causa di voltaggi eccessivi; all'epoca, quel problema era stato risolto rapidamente attraverso aggiornamenti del BIOS.\nPer quanto sia difficile commettere errori durante l'installazione di una CPU moderna, dato che il chip può essere inserito solo in un verso, è fondamentale prestare la massima attenzione durante il montaggio:\n- Verificare che i pin della CPU e del socket siano perfettamente allineati\n- Controllare che non ci siano pin piegati o danneggiati\n- Assicurarsi che la CPU sia correttamente bloccata nel socket\nAl momento questo sembra essere un caso isolato per il Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Non sono state segnalate altre situazioni simili dagli utenti. AMD e MSI non hanno ancora rilasciato dichiarazioni ufficiali sull'accaduto.\nOvviamente seguiremo con attenzione gli sviluppi di questa vicenda, per capire se si tratta di un problema isolato o se emergeranno altre segnalazioni. Nel frattempo, il consiglio è quello di prestare la massima attenzione durante l'assemblaggio del proprio PC, soprattutto con componenti di fascia alta come il Ryzen 7 9800X3D.",
