In fact (as the image below shows) you prepared, typed, signed and delivered that letter the morning after the passing away of the former President was announced. With the greatest respect to you, this clearly demonstrates that your obsession with your perennial Presidential ambition knows no sympathy or empathy.</b><br><br><i>And since we are on the issue of your letter, it is both morally and legally wrong to continue to use the Coat of Arms of the Federal Government in your private or political communications when you stopped being a functionary of the Federal Government more than 18 years ago. Section 6 of the Flag and Coat of Arms Act, Cap. F30, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004 makes this an offence. </i><br><br><b>Morally, it is also reprehensible to use a symbol suggesting that you are acting on behalf of the authority which that symbol represents. It borders on impersonation. Imagine a situation where all former Government functionaries continue to use the Coat of Arms of Nigeria in their personal, political or private communications. There would certainly be confusion everywhere. </b><br><br>I have a bounden duty both as a Cabinet member and a member of the Inner Bar to protect our laws and constitution. <br><br>Please, be well guided.<br></blockquote><br><a rel=ugc href=\"https://x.com/fkeyamo/status/1945536929140732180't=XK9k4fZqT712AVphe4WUFA&s=19\">https://x.com/fkeyamo/status/1945536929140732180't=XK9k4fZqT712AVphe4WUFA&s=19</a><br><br><br><u>Atiku's aide replies</u><br><blockquote>Dear Mr. @fkeyamo <br><br><b>Ordinarily, your latest sanctimonious outburst would not deserve a response. But since youve taken it upon yourself to play the unsolicited role of moral compass in a government drowning in contradictions, it is only fair to set the record straightif not for your sake, then for the benefit of the Nigerian public.</b><br><br><b>Let us begin with the obvious: you serve in an administration where a senior official, your colleague @aonanuga1956, had the moral indecency to publicly excoriate former President Muhammadu Buhari barely hours after his death was announced. His statementpublished before Buharis body even touched Nigerian soilwas a scathing attack laced with bile and revisionism. Yet we did not hear your voice. You neither condemned the insensitivity nor reminded your colleague of sympathy or empathy. Where was your so-called bounden duty then'</b><br><br>But suddenly, Atiku Abubakars resignation letter from the PDPwhich he had every right to make public in response to false claims about his political futurehas become your moral crisis. The same Atiku who honoured Buhari with a dignified tribute, even when people in your circle chose to desecrate his memory with political venom.<br><br>Spare us the hypocrisy.<br><br>Your desperate attempt to deflect public attention from the rot within the APC, and the internal decay within your own government, is transparent. Nigerians are mourning not just a former President, but also the steady collapse of governance, civility, and coherence under your watch.<br><br><b>On the issue of the Coat of Arms: Atiku Abubakar is a former Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The use of a ceremonial letterhead bearing the Coat of Arms on a formal letter of resignation is not an impersonationit is a nod to the office he once held, much like former U.S. Presidents retain their presidential seals for formal communications. There is no confusion thereonly the confusion of a man eager to pick a fight where none exists.</b><br><br>And if your obsession with technicalities was matched by even half the commitment to rule of law, perhaps we would not have witnessed the daily desecration of our courts, the assault on press freedom, or the economic asphyxiation of Nigerians under the Tinubu administration.<br><br><b>In closing, the real tragedy is not Atiku Abubakars letterit is your governments failure to provide Nigerians with dignity, direction, or hope. If your silence over Bayo Onanugas desecration of Buharis legacy is anything to go by, you have no moral standing to lecture anyone on decorum or timing.</b><br>Please, be well guidedby principle, not by partisanship.<br></blockquote><br><a rel=ugc href=\"https://x.com/phrankangel/status/1945553291405910358't=RQ6r654TSwTPOrtXuXJvxw&s=19\">Phrank Shaibu, <br>SA on Public Communication to Atiku Abubakar </a>\nClick here to read full news..\nAll Channels\nNigerian Dailies:\nPunch\n|\nVanguard\n|\nThe Nation\n|\nThisday\n|\nDaily Sun\n|\nGuardian\n|\nDaily Times\n|\nDaily Trust\n|\nDaily Independent\n|\nThe Herald\n|\nTribune\n|\nLeadership\n|\nNational Mirror\n|\nBusinessDay\n|\nNew Telegraph\n|\nPeoples Daily\n|\nBlueprint\n|\nNigerian Pilot\n|\nSahara Reporters\n|\nPremium Times\n|\nThe Cable\n|\nPM News\n|\nAPO Africa Newsroom\nCategories Today:\nWorld\n|\nSports\n|\nTechnology\n|\nEntertainment\n|\nBusiness\n|\nPolitics\n|\nColumns\n|\nAll Headlines Today\nEntertainment (Local):\nLinda Ikeji\n|\nBella Naija\n|\nTori\n|\nDaily News 24\n|\nPulse\n|\nThe NET\n|\nDailyPost\n|\nInformation Nigeria\n|\nGistlover\n|\nLailas Blog\n|\nMiss Petite\n|\nOlufamous\n|\nStella Dimoko Korkus Blog\n|\nYnaija\n|\nAll Entertainment News Today\nEntertainment (World):\nTMZ\n|\nDaily Mail\n|\nHuffington Post\nSports:\nGoal\n|\nAfrican Football\n|\nBleacher Report\n|\nFTBpro\n|\nKickoff\n|\nAll Sports Headlines Today\nBusiness & Finance:\nNairametrics\n|\nNigerian Tenders\n|\nBusiness Insider\n|\nForbes\n|\nEntrepreneur\n|\nThe Economist\n|\nBusinessTech\n|\nFinancial Watch\n|\nBusinessDay\n|\nAll Business News Headlines Today\nTechnology (Local):\nTechpoint\n|\nTechMoran\n|\nTechCity\n|\nInnovation Village\n|\nIT News Africa\n|\nTechnology Times\n|\nTechnext\n|\nTechcabal\n|\nAll Technology News Headlines Today\nTechnology (World):\nTechcrunch\n|\nTechmeme\n|\nSlashdot\n|\nWired\n|\nHackers News\n|\nEngadget\n|\nPocket Lint\n|\nThe Verge\nInternational Networks:\n|\nCNN\n|\nBBC\n|\nAl Jazeera\n|\nYahoo\nForum:\n|\nNairaland\n|\nNaij\nOther Links:\nHome\n|\nNigerian Jobs\nHome\n|\nAbout Us\n|\nContact Us\n|\nDisclaimer\n|\nPrivacy Policy\n|\nCopyright\n|\nSubscribe To News Alert\n|\nFacebook\n|\nTwitter\nAll trademarks and copyrights on this page are owned by their respective owners\nCopyright © 2025. latestnigeriannews.com - All rights reserved",

    "text": "The film stars Tanna Frederick, Judd Nelson, Billy Baldwin, Angelo Boffa and more. Buffalo 8 has acquired North American rights to South of Hope Street, director Jane Spencer's new sci-fi allegorical film, starring Tanna Frederick, Judd Nelson, Billy Baldwin, Angelo Boffa and including Patricia Sluka, Egyptian star Asser Yassin, Michael Madsen, Craig Conway, Meredith Ostrom, Pascal Ulli, and Jack McEvoy. The film is slated for both theatrical release and available on demand on Amazon Prime on April 19th. Written and directed by Spencer, and produced by Ward 9 Productions and Carm One Productions, South of Hope Street is a dystopian sci fi Impact film that tells of a mysterious event in the sky. Only a young woman and her alienated friends try to call attention to it - but they are voiceless misfits. As the sky gets stranger above, it becomes more fascist below, until, suddenly, the powers-that-be build a \"wall\" to cover the mystery of the sky... The film has retro music alluding to a 'time of rebellion' by Donovan, Laura Nyro, an original score by Marc Holthuizen and award-winning composer Marcel Vaid, and is edited by Patricia Rommel ('The Lives of Others'). Executive Producers include Matthew Helderman, Luke Taylor, Remo Muggli, Steven Adams of AltaGlobalMedia and MAD Solutions. South of Hope Street will have a Red-Carpet Premiere at the Westwood Bruin April 18th at 7PM, followed by a Q & A with the filmmakers and cast. The screening is being sponsored by LA Femme International Film Festival, the Swiss Film Fund, and Carm One Productions. The acquisition deal was negotiated by Nikki Stier Justice of Buffalo 8 and Jason Ingber via Ward 9 Productions' Marc Holthuizen and Producer Angelo Boffa. Videos",

    "title": "Derrick Evans: Carol Miller is a 'Traitor' After Vote to Fund Invasion, Trump Persecution - National File",
    "text": "Last Updated on February 1, 2024 J6 Patriot and leading candidate for Congress in West Virginia’s 1st District, Derrick Evans labeled GOP incumbent Carol Miller a “traitor” after her vote with Democrats and the GOP establishment to approve Chuck Schumer’s Continuing Resolution that funds the persecution of President Trump and the invasion of America. West Virginia Rep. Carol Miller (R-1), a staunch supporter of Kevin McCarthy’s short-lived speakership, voted in favor of the continuing resolution backed by Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and Mike Johnson, that allowed the Biden Regime to continue its campaign against America to the tune of more than $1.6 trillion. The big spending package is just the latest to be approved by Miller, who has also voted to send aid to Ukraine and to [keep American troops in Syria](https://nationalfile.com/war-hawk-carol-miller-voted-against-bringing-troops-home-from-syria/). “Democrats are weaponizing government against Donald Trump going into 2024, and rather than fighting to defund Joe Biden’s out-of-control Department of Justice and Jack Smith’s lawless prosecution of Donald Trump, RINO Carol Miller is voting to fund the destruction of Donald Trump,” Evans told National File. “Congress just passed a CR that funds everything on Biden’s wish list, and West Virginia’s own Carol Miller voted with Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer,” Evans said. “There was NO FUNDING to bring to an end the weaponization of Joe Biden’s DOJ against President Trump. There are NO cuts in spending.” “This budget funds Open Borders, and allows Alejandro Mayorkas to continue the invasion at our southern border — even as a handful of Republicans in the House try to impeach Mayorkas in the Homeland Security committee,” Evans explained. “Carol Miller doesn’t just need to be removed from office. She needs to be arrested and tried for TREASON,” said Derrick Evans. “Yes. I’m calling Carol Miller a TRAITOR!” [Related: General Flynn Endorses J6 Patriot Derrick Evans for Congress in WV](https://nationalfile.com/general-flynn-endorses-j6-patriot-derrick-evans-for-congress-in-wv/) “United States Code makes it very clear,” Evans said. “Title 8, U.S.C. § 1324(a) (1)(A)(iv): it is a federal crime to conspire with others to bring unauthorized aliens into the United States or assist them in doing so, whether for financial gain or not,” Evans said. “Article III of the U.S. Constitution states: ‘Treason against the United States shall consist . . . in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort,'” Evans explained. “By supporting sanctuary jurisdictions, refusing to pay for the wall, and allowing the border to remain open, Biden and Mayorkas both are giving aid and comfort to aliens who show contempt for our laws and sovereignty. By definition, these invaders are enemies of the United States. Therefore, Joe Biden and anyone helping to enact this policy is a traitor,” Evans said. “No member of the U.S. Congress or of any government anywhere should be immune from prosecution for treason on these grounds. Not Ilhan Omar. Not Rashida Tlaib. Not Joe Biden. Not Kamala Harris. Not Chuck Schumer. And Not Carol Miller,” Evans added. “When I am elected by the great patriots of West Virginia, I will stop at nothing to make sure traitors are treated as they deserve — with swift accountability.” [Related: West Virginia Rep.

Y Mussolini tuvo que pararle los pies a Julius Évola y su \"imperialismo pagano\".\nEl núcleo intelectual del fascismo era bastante hostil al vaticano. Supongo que al franquismo lo trataban como a su primo tonto.\nAquí los obispos no se pronuncian, pero rezuman afinidad con la ultraderecha.\nEl asociacionismo ultracatolico formado por el entramado HazteOír/Derecho a Vivir/CitizenGo tuvo miembros que fue en listas del PP, aunque recomiendan abiertamente votarna Voz y han ido en sus listas.\nLa ultraderecha alemana puede ser, la española además de ultraderecha es ultracatólica.
