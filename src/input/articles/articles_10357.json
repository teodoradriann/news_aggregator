    "text": "Jakarta—Ending AIDS as a public health threat in the Asia-Pacific region by 2030 can be achieved only if leaders take rigorous actions now to ensure necessary resources for human immunodeficiency virus responses and human rights protection, according to the global AIDS update from Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).\nIn the report, “The Urgency of Now: AIDS at a Crossroads,” the progress of some countries in reducing HIV infections and AIDS cases was acknowledged, but significant treatment gaps and the stigma still faced by people living with HIV were also highlighted.\nWith a new HIV infection every two minutes, governments in Asia-Pacific countries must urgently invest in prevention programs and community-led initiatives, the report suggested. Asia Pacific, home to 6.7 million people living with HIV in 2023, has the largest HIV epidemic in the world outside eastern and Southern Africa, according to Eamonn Murphy, UNAIDS director of regional support teams for Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia.\n“We must do more, and do it faster,” Murphy said during the regional launch of the 2024 global AIDS update.\nFEATURED STORIES OPINION Pilfering PhilHealth funds OPINION Greatness knows no bounds for Carlos Yulo OPINION Our young – today and tomorrow The Asia-Pacific region accounted for a quarter of new HIV infections in the world in 2023, with 300,000 new infections. Men having sex with men, drug users, sex workers, and transgender people are among those at risk for HIV infection.\nProgress to halt new infections have stalled since 2010, with the region seeing just a 13-percent decline in new infections, one-third the 39 percent global average. While AIDS-related deaths in the region has declined by half since 2010, it still translates to 17 people dying from an AIDS-related illness every hour. Nine youths aged between 15 and 24 lose their lives every day in what could be avoidable outcomes, UNAIDS suggested.\nThe 2024 estimates for the region indicate no significant change in the figures of both new infections and deaths between 2022 and 2023, “a serious warning sign that momentum has been lost, and that more has to be done,” Murphy said.\nThe report also found that six countries with increasing infections—Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Fiji, Laos, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines—recorded growing death rates, while Indonesia, Mongolia, and Pakistan recorded an increase in AIDS-related deaths.\nADVERTISEMENT It also suggested that the “Undetectable = Untransmittable” (U=U) campaign had been a game-changer in lower viral transmissions, even though it was largely unknown to policymakers, health workers, and people living with HIV. The concept means that a person living with HIV who continues treatment and has an undetectable viral load cannot sexually transmit the virus.\nMost cases of transmission involve people who do not know they have HIV. In some cases, transmission occurs among people with diagnosed HIV but who are not on treatment, and people who are on treatment but have not reached viral suppression.\nADVERTISEMENT Only 78 percent of people living with HIV globally were aware of their status in 2023, according to UNAIDS. Two-thirds of people with HIV were on antiretroviral treatment last year, with the remaining third not receiving the care and support they needed to stay healthy and prevent virus transmission.\nIn Indonesia, only 31 percent of people living with HIV were receiving treatment, higher than Pakistan (15 percent) but lower than the Philippines (43 percent) and Bangladesh (49 percent).\n“We have a moral and a public health imperative to help people learn their status, provide testing, start them on treatment right away if they are positive, and to ensure that the treatment works completely and they’re able to access treatment throughout their lives,” Murphy said.\nFunding shortfalls were a key factor impeding progress, said Harry Prabowo, program manager at the Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS and a representative of the Seven Alliance consortium of people living with HIV in the region.\n“We need to sustain and increase investments to ensure that no one is left behind in this fight,” he said, as he called for renewed commitments to end the epidemic.\nThese efforts could include scaling up access to testing and treatment services, improving the services of HIV prevention programs for key populations, and ensuring comprehensive and sustained funding to close the resource gap.\n“We need to address stigma and discrimination, and we do this by addressing the legal and society barriers. This includes implementing legal protections against discriminatory policies,” said Cecilia Oh, program adviser of the HIV, health, and development group of the United Nations Development Programme.

    "text": "La famiglia Galaxy S25 sarà presentata nel corso dei primi mesi del 2025 ma l’attenzione degli addetti ai lavori è già concentrata sui prossimi [flagship Samsung](https://www.tecnoandroid.it/2024/11/14/samsung-galaxy-s25-trapela-in-rete-la-data-di-presentazione-ufficiale-1477568/). L’idea iniziale del produttore era quella di adottare il SoC Exynos 2500 su tutti i modelli che comporranno la famiglia. Tuttavia, lo sviluppo della piattaforma hardware proprietaria sta procedendo a rilento causando non pochi problemi al produttore coreano. Stando a quanto indicato da alcuni report, Samsung potrebbe essere in ritardo sull’ottimizzazione e sulla produzione a causa delle limitazioni imposte dal governo sulle ore lavorative. Secondo la legislazione coreana, nel Paese non è possibile superare le 52 ore di lavoro settimanali, includendo 12 ore di straordinari. Un limite che si ripercuote sulle attività del gigante coreano in termini di sviluppo e produzione del chipset di nuova generazione. Le limitazioni sulle ore lavorative settimanali stanno causando problemi a Samsung per lo sviluppo e la produzione dei SoC Exynos 2500 A causa di questi [limiti](https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/11/14/samsung-says-koreas-52-hour-workweek-is-the-reason-behind-exynoss-failure-to-compete-with-qualcomm-and-apple/), si sono accumulati notevoli ritardi nel processo di realizzazione del SoC Exynos 2500. Samsung ha cercato di trovare una soluzione direttamente con il Governo per ottenere una deroga ma i negoziati sembrano falliti Ne consegue che Samsung ha dovuto rivedere completamente i propri piani per adattarsi alla situazione. Per questo motivo, il produttore coreano potrebbe utilizzare il SoC [Exynos 2500](https://www.tecnoandroid.it/2024/11/06/galaxy-s25-samsung-sta-testando-il-soc-exynos-2500-1473238/) solo sulla la versione base e su quella Plus. La variante Ultra, invece, sarà spinta dal SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite per diminuire la pressione sulla produzione di Samsung. Gli analisti stanno facendo notare che la problematica è comune a tutti gli altri produttori coreani oltre che Taiwanesi, tra cui spicca TSMC. Tuttavia, Samsung è attiva in molti più settori e include anche la progettazione dei semiconduttori oltre che la produzione vera e propria. Il rispetto delle ore lavorative diventa vincolante se tutto il processo, dall’ideazione allo sviluppo, viene svolto in corea.",

    "title": "​Un matrimonio se enfrenta a una pena de prisión por su fe y difundir material sobre Falun Gong | Falun Dafa - Minghui.org",
    "text": "(Minghui.org) Un matrimonio de la ciudad de Honghu, provincia de Hubei, fue juzgado el 10 de noviembre de 2023 por su fe y por distribuir material sobre Falun Gong. Mantuvieron que no habían infringido ninguna ley al practicar su fe o distribuir información para denunciar la persecución de Falun Gong por el régimen comunista chino. El juez levantó la sesión sin emitir un veredicto. La Sra. Zhang Jingqiong, de 58 años, y su marido, el Sr. Weng Zuguo, ambos antiguos empleados de la Fábrica de Textil de la ciudad de Honghu, fueron detenidos por Zhou Huarong y otros agentes de la Oficina de Seguridad Interior de la ciudad de Honghu, cuando acababan de salir de su casa para ir a hacer la compra, por la mañana del 10 de mayo de 2023. La policía les arrebató las llaves, irrumpió en su casa y confiscó sus libros de Falun Gong, material informativo y dos teléfonos móviles. Meses antes de la detención de la pareja, la policía instaló una cámara de vigilancia en el edificio de apartamentos situado frente al suyo, con el fin de controlar sus actividades diarias. La Sra. Zhang fue recluida en el Centro de Supervisión de la ciudad de Jianli, a unos 80 kilómetros de Honghu. El Sr. Weng fue detenido en el Centro de Detención de la ciudad de Honghu. Sus detenciones se aprobaron a mediados de agosto de 2023. Tras las detenciones, la policía acosó e intimidó con frecuencia a sus hijas gemelas, que tienen poco más de 30 años. La Sra. Zhang reveló que sufrió malos tratos en el centro de supervisión. Se le restringió estrictamente el uso del baño y sus heces se volvieron de color negro. Tanto ella como Weng sostuvieron que no violaron ninguna ley ni perjudicaron a nadie al distribuir información sobre Falun Gong. Añadieron que ninguna ley en China ha criminalizado a Falun Gong y que practicar Falun Gong es su libertad de creencia. El juez no dictó sentencia tras la vista. No es la primera vez que la pareja es perseguida por su fe. En los últimos 24 años, han sido detenidos, encarcelados y torturados en repetidas ocasiones. Sus hijas también crecieron con miedo. La esposa sufre rotura de un ovario en el campo de trabajos forzados de Shayang Entre 1999 y 2004, la Sra. Zhang fue encarcelada cuatro veces. Desarrolló una grave afección cardiaca debido a las torturas sufridas bajo custodia. El 3 de marzo de 2004, Zhang fue detenida de nuevo y condenada a un año y medio de prisión en el campo de trabajos forzados de Shayang. Sus hijas gemelas de 12 años, Weng Mengyun y Weng Menghua, acudieron al gobierno municipal para pedir ayuda al alcalde, pero los funcionarios se burlaron de ellas. Como su padre estaba detenido en el Primer Centro de Detención de la ciudad de Honghu, las dos niñas se quedaron con su abuela de 82 años. También tuvieron que hacer trabajos esporádicos para cubrir sus gastos. Sin embargo, las niñas destacaron en la escuela y ganaron varios concursos de redacción. El 18 de agosto de 2004, Zhang fue golpeada por un recluso. Sufrió la rotura de un ovario y se desmayó debido a una hemorragia excesiva. Cuando su hermana fue al hospital a visitarla, la Sra. Zhang estaba demacrada, con la tez cetrina. Después de sólo cinco meses de detención, también le habían salido canas. Sin embargo, los guardias del campo de trabajo se negaron a liberarla. Uno de ellos dijo: \"Si ella no abandona su práctica ni sigue las reglas, incluso si muere, no seremos responsables de ello\". El marido con huesos fracturados a causa de una paliza policial El Sr. Weng fue detenido de nuevo cuando salió sobre las 5 de la mañana del 24 de septiembre de 2011. La policía le arrebató las llaves y allanó su domicilio sobre las 7 de la mañana de ese día. Tras unas pocas horas en comisaría, el Sr. Weng sufrió fracturas óseas debido a los golpes que le dio la policía y fue trasladado de vuelta a casa. Zuo Shihong, jefe de la Oficina de Seguridad Nacional de la ciudad de Honghu, le amenazó con condenarle a un campo de trabajos forzados si volvía a ser detenido. La pareja detenida de nuevo y la esposa golpeada Zuo y más de diez agentes se presentaron en el restaurante de pescado frito de la pareja alrededor de las 7 de la mañana, del 25 de agosto de 2017 y los arrestaron. Empujaron a la pareja al suelo y los esposaron, antes de meterlos a empujones en un coche de policía. La policía confiscó de la casa los libros de Falun Gong, el retrato del fundador de Falun Gong, los materiales informativos, el televisor, el reproductor de DVD, la grabadora de DVD y el altavoz de la pareja, y también les quitó las llaves. Como resultado, la familia tuvo que cambiar las cerraduras. En la Estación de la policia de Xindi, la pareja fue retenida en una habitación sin ventanas ni ventilación. Con el calor del verano, estaban empapados de sudor. Cuando el Sr. Weng pidió agua, la policía se negó a dársela y también amenazó con torturarlos hasta la muerte. La policía inmovilizó a la pareja en bancos de tigres durante dos horas y no los soltó hasta que tuvieron que ir al baño. Al trasladar a la pareja entre diferentes habitaciones, la policía no les permitió caminar, sino que los arrastraron por el suelo esposados. Sus cuerpos y extremidades estaban cubiertos de heridas. La policía también abusó verbalmente de ellos. La frente, el brazo, la pierna y la espalda de la Sra. Zhang resultaron gravemente heridas después de los abusos durante su detención. También tenía dolores agudos en los huesos y órganos internos. Ella no podía levantar los brazos.

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Festler in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Festler says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Festler standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Festler would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Festler told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Festler found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Festler said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Festler wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Festler gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Festler waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Festler is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Festler said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Festler added.",

I did play with my teammates. Obviously by chatting you get to communicate with your teammates. So, I really had a great experience playing games with my teammates. And now that this game is coming out, I think I might have to start taking it up again and start playing again.”\nEven in something as trivial as a video game, Ohtani is able to find ways to improve teammate synergy and improve communication around the clubhouse.\nThe Ohtani character in Fortnite comes with Dodgers home and away uniforms, a LEGO version of the slugger, a Samurai outfit, and even a bobblehead based on Decoy, Ohtani’s beloved dog.\nMore news: Longtime Evaluator Says Bobby Witt is Best Player in World Over Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani\nPhoto Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\nHave you joined our Discord Channel yet?
