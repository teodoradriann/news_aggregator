    "text": "RICHMOND spearhead Tom Lynch \"can't take a trick\", placed into concussion protocols after a collision in the Tigers' match simulation on Friday.\nThe 32-year-old has played just eight games in the past two seasons, dogged by serious foot and hamstring injuries, but has been training well this summer.\nIn his scheduled press conference, assistant coach Steve Morris was unable to provide much clarity about Lynch's timeline to return, given the immediacy of the incident.\nPLAY AFL FANTASY Pick your team NOW\n\"'Lynchy' can't take a trick, he's entered concussion protocols. He's had an outstanding probably eight weeks of training, he's firing on all cylinders,\" Morris said.\n\"I found myself on the bump bag – unfortunately – a few times and just he's just training with some real purpose. So it's a bit of a speed bump for him, but he's in really good nick and hope to see him back in in the really near future.\"\nDion Prestia completed one-third of the hitout before running laps, and is on a managed load this pre-season given his extensive history of soft tissue injuries. Nick Vlastuin and Kane McAuliffe also completed two-thirds of the scrimmage.\nMid-season recruit Jacob Blight left the field in considerable pain, holding his right shoulder, but Morris said it appeared he has escaped damage.\nNoah Balta – who is in the midst of a four-match club ban after he pled guilty to an assault charge – only trained in the gym, providing Category B rookie Ollie Hayes-Brown plenty of time up forward, after Jacob Koschitzke was switched to defence.\nJacob Bauer played up forward in the As, at one stage booting a set-shot goal from 55-60m.\n\"He's tracking all right. We've asked him to really dig in into his training over the last little bit and what I've seen is a guy who's really committed to earning the trust of his teammates,\" Morris said.\n\"He's put everything out on the table over the last few weeks, doing extra sessions and he knows that he's got to get himself red-hot fit.\n\"He's a really important player to our team and our club and I think he's doing a really good job at the moment under the circumstances he's facing.\"\nRising half-forward Seth Campbell racked up plenty of midfield minutes in the \"A\" team, alongside Tim Taranto and Jacob Hopper, while Samson Ryan, Thomson Dow, Tom Brown, James Trezise and Tyler Sonsie were in the \"B\" side.\nSam Banks provided plenty of dash out of defence, while No.1 pick Sam Lalor appeared to be spending more time forward with occasional midfield stints in the \"As\", as did Rhyan Mansell.\nMorris is set to accompany five Richmond players – Josh Gibcus, Judson Clarke, Tylar Young, Taj Hotton and Mykelti Lefau – to the latter's family homeland of Samoa on Saturday.\nThe quintet is all recovering from torn ACLs, and the trip – the brainchild of head of communications Nicki Malady – will see the group visit Lefau's grandparents' village.\n\"I just honestly don't really have too much words, I'm just super excited. I can't believe we're actually going. It's just such a massive opportunity and I'm just so grateful for the club.\n\"I think that Nicki had it and planned for a while since I came to the club, from what I've heard, but we had little discussions about it just saying there would be such an awesome opportunity to go over there and sort of start a Tiger footprint there,\n\"[My aunties and uncles] were just there for my great-grandmother's birthday last week, so they were all there just talking about it. They wish they could stay. Some of them did stay just to see me over there.\n\"This is my first time going, I'm just going back to my roots where my culture is and just doing it with the club that I love here, with Richmond, being able to do it with them is just such a massive opportunity.\"",

    "title": "IG nominee says paralysed force led to a breach of Parliament - The Standard",
    "text": "The police were unable to stop the breach of Parliament on July 25 this year because they were incapacitated, Inspector General of Police nominee Douglas Kanja yesterday revealed. The infamous invasion of Parliament by protestors, the contested police deployment to Haiti, the incessant banditry and cattle rustling in the North Rift as well as the extra-judicial killings during the Gen Z protests confronted Kanja on his big day of vetting. Kanja, who was appearing before the Joint National Assembly and Senate Committee on Administration, Internal Security and Defence and Foreign Relations for vetting, disclosed that the police force was overwhelmed and resources overstretched by the protests that rocked the country on the day that Parliament fell. Warding off claims of incompetence and laxity from the police service on the fateful day, Kanja, who served as the Deputy Inspector General then, submitted that the multitude of numbers that thronged the capital made it difficult for his personnel to adequately deal with the situation. \"We were fully prepared (for the protests) despite the fact that the multitude of people that turned up was huge...Areas such as the Globe roundabout were blocked, Thika road was also blocked and equipment such as fire engines could not pass. We needed clearance even for fire engines to pass,\" said Kanja. He was responding to a query by committee chair Gabriel Tongoyo (Narok West MP) who sought to understand the effectiveness of the police reaction during the breach of the August House. \"On the July 25th issue, how comes that a breach happened in Parliament yet the police lacked equipment even to put out the fire? Was this a case of laxity?\" Tongoyo posed. His was a supplementary question to Kisumu West MP Rosa Buyu who sought to know why the police could not have stopped the invasion of the critical infrastructure and whether the police followed the law in dealing with the protests. And in what came in the form of a quick-fire cross-examination, Senator Tom Ojienda took the cue. “When the demonstrations took place, do you think the police handled it well?” he asked. To which Kanja responded, “I believe we handled it well, that is why we are seated here today.” “Were you pleased by the invasion? How differently would you have handled it or any other arising from the Gen Z protests?” pressed Ojienda. Kanja replied, “No I was not.” He further pledged to do everything possible to protect critical government infrastructure if appointed Inspector General. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter “This is an area that we cannot afford to take lightly. I will do whatever it takes to ensure this Parliament is secured,\" added the IG nominee. The House team also held Kanja’s feet to fire over the deaths witnessed from the anti-government protests sparked by the controversial Finance Bill 2024. “You were the Deputy Inspector General when more than 70 Kenyans were killed during the protests, you were also the Deputy Inspector General when bodies were recovered and dumped from Kware slums, Kenyans are asking why you should be elevated to the Inspector General,” posed Homa bay Town MP Peter Kaluma. The legislator further questioned Kanja’s academic journey, questioning his degree acquired at Inorero University, which he said had since shut down operations. The House team also heard that the IG nominee is banking on leveraging technology to deal with the scourge that is banditry and cattle rustling in the North Rift region. Kanja submitted that he would support the deployment of tracking units with georeferencing capabilities to police to monitor livestock herds and intercept those found outside assigned jurisdictions. Once approved, he vowed to hasten the recruitment and arming of National Police Reservists, noting that the current shortage has curtailed progress in ending insecurity.",

Kennedy Jr. announced sweeping cuts to his department on Thursday, the latest step by the Trump administration to dramatically shrink the size of the federal government’s workforce and responsibilities.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Kennedy plans to cut 10,000 employees, according to a statement from HHS. Combined with other departures from buyouts, the reductions mean the agency will employ 62,000 workers, down from 82,000.\nKennedy also intends to streamline the department by consolidating its 28 divisions into 15, and cut regional offices from 10 to five.\nThe department will create a new Administration for a Healthy America division. HHS says the changes will cut costs by $1.8 billion per year.\n“We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy said in a statement. “This Department will do more – a lot more – at a lower cost to the taxpayer.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Wall Street Journal first reported Kennedy’s plans.\nKennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic with unorthodox views on many public health issues, has vowed to reshape the department and the federal government’s policies, under what he has dubbed a Make America Healthy Again agenda.\nIn his role, he has control over agencies including the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, giving him oversight over the approval of new medicines, vaccine recommendations and public health guidance. HHS accounts for about a quarter of the federal budget through its control over federal insurance programs for elderly and low-income Americans.\nThe moves are likely to draw blowback from Democrats and public health advocates already worried about the scope of the Trump administration’s federal cuts, spearheaded by billionaire adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency effort.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Critics have warned that cuts to federal health programs risk impacting food safety, vaccine development and the approval of medical treatments.\n(Updates with additional details, background throughout)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nAdvertisement About Our Ads",

    "text": "Everyone needs a GP, and the Australian Government must build the country's health workforce so everyone can get the care they need today, and in the future, says the Royal Australian College of GPs (RACGP). The call comes in the lead up to World Health Day on Sunday 7 April 2024. This year's theme is 'My health, my right,' which highlights that the right to health is increasingly coming under threat. RACGP Vice President Associate Professor Michael Clements said: \"Australia has a world class health system, but investment in building our health workforce to meet growing patient needs is critical. \"More than 22 million Australians received 179 million services from GPs in 2022, making general practitioners not only the most visited health professionals, but also the most cost-effective form of care. \"But demand for GP care is skyrocketing in Australia due to our demographics. We have an ageing population, and nearly half of all Australians are living with chronic illness, including mental health issues. \"More and more people require complex, ongoing care in the community. And GPs are the only health professionals who train for over 10 years to provide this kind of care. \"A strong general practice workforce is essential for a healthy Australia. This is why the RACGP is calling for the government to invest in the next Federal Budget to get enough GPs in every community. \"Being a GP is one of the most rewarding jobs, but attraction has declined after decades of underfunding. \"The RACGP is responsible for training 90% of Australia's GPs, including those training in rural and remote communities. We know what needs to be done to attract and retain this essential workforce. \"We're calling on the government to boost our homegrown GPs by removing the barriers to GP training. This includes funding incentives and basic work entitlements – parental and study leave – so GP registrars get the same as their hospital-based counterparts. Currently GPs in training lose these entitlements and take a pay cut when they leave the hospital for private practice, and many opt to stay in the hospital system for this reason. \"We're also calling for the government to help get more international and local GPs in regional and rural Australia in the immediate future by subsidising their training to work as specialist GPs. This will also work to boost our rural workforce in the long-term, because the research shows GPs who train rurally are more likely to choose to live there. \"These investments will help ensure Australia has the health workforce we need to meet patient needs today, and into the future. GP care helps people live healthier and longer, and having enough GPs in every community is essential for the health of our nation.\" The RACGP is calling for funding and reforms to improve access to affordable care for all Australians and boost the GP workforce in its [pre-Budget Submission 2024-25](https://www.racgp.org.au/advocacy/reports-and-submissions/view-all-reports-and-submissions/2024-reports-and-submissions/racgp-pre-budget-submission-2024-25). $75 million per annum to incentivise more junior doctors to specialise in general practice by providing paid parental and study leave for GP registrars and an incentive payment to ensure they're paid the same as those working in hospitals. $25 million per annum to subsidise training for 1,100 more international and local doctors so they can work as specialist GPs in regional and remote communities.

    "text": "C’était une sensation indescriptible pour la Québécoise Aurélie Rivard.\nL’athlète âgée de 28 ans originaire de St-Jean-sur-Richelieu a gagné le 400 m style libre féminin dans la catégorie S10 en quatre minutes et 29,20 secondes, jeudi, aux Jeux paralympiques de Paris.\nRivard est ainsi devenue la première Canadienne à gagner l’or dans la même épreuve lors de trois éditions consécutives des Jeux paralympiques depuis Stephanie Dixon au 100 m dos dans la catégorie S9 en 2000, 2004 et 2008.\n« C’est invraisemblable en ce moment parce que c’est la chose la plus difficile que j’ai jamais faite — me préparer pour cette course, a déclaré Rivard. Surtout mentalement — depuis les Championnats du monde de 2022, alors que je n’avais pas été en mesure de compléter la course, mais aussi parce que j’ai connu un début de semaine difficile avec deux performances décevantes. »\n« J’ai dû retrouver ma confiance pour être dans les blocs de départ ce soir et livrer la marchandise. Ç’a été difficile, et j’en suis très fière. Je suis heureuse d’être parvenue à surmonter mes craintes », a-t-elle renchéri.\nIl s’agit de la troisième médaille de Rivard aux Jeux de Paris, qui a d’ailleurs établi le record paralympique au 400 m style libre aux Jeux de Tokyo en 2021. Elle a aussi gagné l’argent au 100 m style libre et le bronze au 50 m style libre dans la capitale française.\nCependant, après sa contre-performance au 100 m style libre dimanche, Rivard a envisagé de quitter Paris. Elle a signé un temps de 1:00,82, soulignant au passage que c’était la première fois en une décennie qu’elle complétait cette épreuve en plus d’une minute.\nElle possède le record du monde dans cette épreuve en 58,14 secondes, un chrono réalisé aux Jeux paralympiques de Tokyo en 2021.\n« J’ai envisagé de rentrer à la maison, après le 100 m style libre, a-t-elle reconnu. Puis, je me suis couchée, et j’ai ensuite eu une très bonne discussion avec mes entraîneurs et mon équipe. Je devais simplement me rappeler que j’étais la nageuse à battre dans cette épreuve. Je devais me concentrer sur moi-même. »\n« Oublie où tu es, oublie les autres filles, ce qui est difficile parce que tu es aux Jeux paralympiques. Mais c’est ce que j’ai fait », a-t-elle poursuivi.\nL’Américaine Alexandra Truwit (4:31,39) et la Hongroise Bianka Pap (4:35,63) ont complété le podium, dans l’ordre.\nÀ lire aussi Quatre médailles de plus pour le Canada aux Jeux paralympiques de Paris Routliffe fête sa médaille en famille Quelques minutes avant l’exploit de Rivard, Tess Routliffe a aussi atteint le podium pour le Canada en paranatation.\nRoutliffe a obtenu la médaille de bronze au 100 m brasse féminin dans la catégorie SB7, doublant ainsi sa récolte parisienne. La paranageuse de Caledon, en Ontario, avait mérité l’argent au 200 m quatre nages individuel féminin dans la catégorie SM7.\nPhoto: Ian Rice Agence France-Presse Tess Routliffe a obtenu la médaille de bronze au 100 m brasse féminin dans la catégorie SB7. Routliffe, qui est âgée de 25 ans, a pu célébrer sa plus récente conquête d’une médaille avec sa soeur, Erin, qui est arrivée à temps à Paris après avoir pris part aux Internationaux de tennis des États-Unis.\n« Je l’ai vue dans les gradins et je l’ai saluée. Toute ma famille est ici. C’est tellement merveilleux de la voir ici. Je suis contente qu’elle soit là », a dit Tess Routliffe, qui a aussi souligné que son autre soeur, Tara, a aussi assisté à chacune de ses courses à Paris.\n« Elle [Tara] a toujours été là, donc je dois lui lever mon chapeau. Tout le monde parle d’Erin, mais elle a toujours été là, à mes côtés », a-t-elle ajouté en riant.\nErin Routliffe et sa partenaire de jeu Gabriela Dabrowski, d’Ottawa, étaient les championnes en titre du double féminin aux Internationaux des États-Unis. Elles ont cependant plié l’échine en devant la Russe Veronika Kudermetova et la Taïwanaise Hao-ching Chan en quarts de finale.",
