The rate of warming has been relatively steady at 0.2°C per decade since 1970, significantly faster than any period before3.\nThe primary driver of this rapid warming is human emissions of greenhouse gases.

    "title": "Citizens against war",
    "text": "“Technological advantage is always crucial in a war but, historically, the motivation to fight should not be ignored. The elites in the West might be inclined to solve problems by fighting/supporting a war but western citizens are twice less inclined to bear arms, compared to the citizens of the rest of the world. \"The narrative in the G7 plus EU countries that the war in Ukraine is also their own war seems to bear no correlation with the citizens of these countries’ willingness to fight.” The above was stated by Kancho Stoychev, president of the Gallup International Association, Centre for Public and Political Studies, on March 11. A Gallup survey carried out between October and December 2023 showed that only 32% of EU citizens are willing to fight for their country if there is a war. Those least willing (and answered “no”) are Italy (78%), Austria (62%), Germany (57%) and Spain (53%). EU leaders feel the need to talk up the ‘Russian threat’. They want their citizens to support war. EU leaders want to persuade their citizens about the need to spend much more on armaments. European Council president Charles Michel wrote on Euractiv (March 18): “Europe must strengthen its defence capabilities and shift to a ‘war economy’ mode in response to the threat posed by Russia.” This means the reorientation of national economic structures to prioritise military needs over civilian consumption. Branislav Slantchev, a professor at the University of California San Diego, told Euronews (May 28): “The public is not going to like public services cut, higher prices, and higher taxes. Moving too fast toward reinvestment in defence risks draining public support before meaningful changes are made, especially if the threat to which the government is supposed to be responding does not seem imminent or realistic.” Will EU citizens support a drop in their living conditions and the deterioration of public services to pay for more armaments? Will this widen the gap between the EU elite and ordinary Europeans weighed down by the cost of living and expensive housing, and rootlessness in their societies? The EU is militarising itself through the European Defence Fund to invest in high-end defence capabilities, a European Air Shield and a new Commissioner for Defence. The European Investment Bank has created a Security and Defence Office offering streamlined financial support totalling €6 billion and expert assistance aimed at strengthening Europe’s security and defence capabilities. One-third of this military budget has come from the already severely underfunded Horizon Europe Research Programme in science and industry, badly needed for innovation and productivity if the EU is not to continue falling behind the United States and China. At the beginning of this year, McKinsey Global Institute warned: “Unless Europe can re-energise growth, its leading position on sustainability and inclusion could be compromised, eroding Europeans’ standard of living. Accelerating growth requires becoming more globally competitive, even in the face of mounting pressures.” The EU’s demographic decline makes it a smaller part of the world. The Europe of 27 would lose 60 million workers over the next 30 years, 33 million of whom between the ages of 20 and 45, the most productive and creative period of life. Instead of humbly resetting its relations with the global majority in a multipolar world, the EU, as part of the West, wants desperately to live on, in denial, as the centre of a unipolar world that is no more. Instead of rediscovering the politics of diplomacy, dialogue and negotiation with Russia and China, most of the present EU leaders are choosing the path of war and confrontation. The total breakdown in relations between the EU and Russia because of the terrible war in Ukraine has its roots in the decision of the United States in 2008 to enlarge NATO to the borders of Russia. A number of top American diplomats (Madeleine Albright, George Kennan and Strobe Talbot, to mention just a few) warned that expanding NATO to Russia’s border with Ukraine would be the beginning of a new Cold War. That has come to pass. It is tragic for Ukraine that, when it was on the point of signing an agreement with Russia in April 2022, British prime minister Boris Johnson visited Kiev and told President Volodymyr Zelensky to break off negotiations with Russia as the West was not ready to end the war. Instead of building a new security architecture for Europe within the OSCE, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, to look after each country’s security without undermining that of their neighbour, the United States ignored Russia’s security concern and enlarged NATO. Since then, NATO is spreading globally, absorbing the EU in the process. Malta’s constitutional neutrality was part of the package to join the EU. We should adhere to that right and obligation. In a 2021 survey, 63% of Maltese expressed themselves strongly in favour of Malta’s position of neutrality. 18% of respondents considered Malta’s neutrality as important while 14% did not take any position. Just 6% of Maltese were against neutrality, on the grounds that, as a member of the EU, Malta was obliged to adhere to its common foreign and security policy. The main reasons given for supporting neutrality was that it was the only way to avoid involvement in conflict and wars and maintain open global commercial relations. The biggest threat to our neutrality may come from ourselves and the quality of our national leadership. We should foster good relations with all other countries and deny the use of our territory as a launching pad to attack others. Today’s technology, both in terms of missiles and air and sea transport, has greatly diminished Malta’s strategic importance in the central Mediterranean. We should use this fact to our advantage and refuse to again become a military logistical centre threatening others. Our neutrality is totally compatible with upholding the values of the United Nations: equality of states, solving disputes through non-military means, respecting the sovereignty of states, human rights, democracy and peace.

    "text": "[Monde](https://www.rts.ch/info/monde/) Un nouveau risque de pluies torrentielles plane sur l'Espagne, déjà meurtrie par des inondations A Utiel, des agriculteurs travaillent sans relâche, à l'aide de tracteurs, pour enlever la boue, retirer les objets drainés par les eaux, mais aussi les meubles des maisons inondées. Ce large élan de solidarité est porté notamment par les réseaux sociaux. \"Nous allons de maison en maison en demandant si les gens ont besoin d'aide\", explique une habitante de 26 ans. \"Certains ont tout perdu, il y a des personnes âgées de 90 ans qui vivent seules\", détaille-t-elle. Dans la ville, située à moins de cent kilomètres de Valence, l'électricité n'est pas encore rétablie partout. L'eau potable reste coupée ou fortement restreinte, comme dans une vingtaine de communes sinistrées. Une incompréhension des enjeux? Les services de secours cherchent encore des personnes disparues, et le bilan des victimes — 158 jeudi soir — risque encore de s'aggraver. Plusieurs provinces du pays sont également menacées d'épisodes de pluies torrentielles. Dans ce contexte, les pistes pour éviter de nouvelles catastrophes n'ont pas encore été abordées. Le directeur de l'Institut de l'adaptation humaine, à Marseille, considère vendredi dans La Matinale que les pays européens n'ont pas \"compris l'enjeu\". Selon Christian Clot, \"il ne suffira pas de changer nos infrastructures et nos systèmes techniques\". Pour éviter les inondations, dont la fréquence va encore augmenter, il sera nécessaire \"d'occuper l'espace différemment, de revégétaliser et de débétonner nos systèmes\" pour permettre une meilleure absorption par les sols, explique le chercheur franco-suisse.

Esa fue la cruda advertencia del funcionario del gobierno local Yurii Tretiak, jefe de la administración militar de la ciudad de Myrnohrad, que ahora se encuentra a menos de 4,8 km de la línea del frente.\nLos menores con sus padres u otros representantes legales serán evacuados por la fuerza de ciertos distritos de la región ucraniana de Donetsk, incluido el distrito de Pokrovsk, según el ministerio ucraniano responsable de la reintegración de las regiones que anteriormente estaban bajo control ruso.\nPero Tretiak dijo que muchas personas siguen siendo reacias a marcharse, llegando incluso a esconder a sus hijos de las autoridades locales, lo que incita a la administración militar a realizar visitas domiciliarias.\n“Tenemos casos en los que los padres esconden a sus hijos. Hoy (20 de agosto) tendremos una reunión con la Policía para discutir cómo trabajaremos con esas personas, cómo buscaremos a esos padres que esconden a los niños y dan información falsa de que los niños se fueron hace tiempo”, dijo, señalando que los peligros están aumentando y que algunas zonas de la ciudad sufren ataques diarios.\n“Los que dudaban hace una semana se han decidido en su mayoría y se están marchando en masa”, dijo, señalando que para los residentes que aún no han evacuado, “el argumento más común es ‘no tengo adónde ir’ o ‘nadie me necesita'”.\nHay casi 59.000 residentes en toda la comunidad, que abarca la ciudad de Pokrovsk, el pueblo de Myrnohrad y 39 aldeas circundantes, según la administración militar de la ciudad de Pokrovsk. Alrededor de 600 a 700 personas han estado evacuando diariamente, dijo la administración.\n“El enemigo avanza más rápido de lo esperado”, dijo Tretiak en una entrevista radiofónica el martes. “Así que estamos intentando hacer todo lo posible para evacuar a la gente antes de que acabe la semana”.\nAunque Pokrovsk no es una de las ciudades más grandes de Ucrania, unas 60.000 personas vivían allí antes de la guerra y muchas se han marchado desde el inicio de la invasión a gran escala, sirve como centro clave para el ejército ucraniano gracias a su fácil acceso a Kostiantynivka, otro centro militar.\nLas fuerzas ucranianas utilizan la carretera que conecta ambos para reabastecer las líneas del frente y evacuar a las bajas hacia Dnipro.\nRestos de un edificio residencial destruido por los bombardeos rusos el 11 de agosto en Myrnohrad, Ucrania.

Las fuerzas ucranianas repelieron 11 ataques, los combates continúan en cuatro localidades”, dijeron las Fuerzas Armadas de Ucrania en la última actualización.\nMientras las comunidades de Pokrovsk y sus alrededores siguen bajo el fuego, el Ministerio de Defensa de Rusia afirmó el jueves que las fuerzas rusas han ocupado el pueblo ucraniano oriental de Mezhove como parte de su ofensiva en curso en la zona.\nRusia afirma que evitó un ataque de drones ucranianos en la región de Moscú\nEl ministerio afirmó que unidades del grupo Centro de las fuerzas armadas rusas tomaron el control de Mezhove, en la región de Donetsk anexada ilegalmente por Rusia. El ejército ucraniano no ha hecho comentarios sobre la situación en el pueblo.\nEl presidente de Ucrania, Volodymyr Zelensky, declaró el miércoles que se están reforzando las fuerzas ucranianas en la región oriental para repeler un posible avance ruso.\nEn su discurso nocturno, Zelensky dijo: “La línea del frente es nuestra posición, en primer lugar la dirección de Pokrovsk, nuestra región de Donetsk. Entendemos los movimientos del enemigo y nos estamos reforzando”.\nMédicos del ejército ucraniano atienden a soldados heridos en un punto de estabilización en la dirección de Pokrovsk.

    "text": "Forcing schools to enrol SEN pupils 'unacceptable'\nA bid to \"force\" schools to enrol pupils with special educational needs (SEN) would be \"wholly unacceptable,\" Northern Ireland's independent autism reviewer has said.\nEma Cubitt was speaking after the Education Authority (EA) said it was considering an unprecedented move to instruct some schools to admit SEN children.\nThe EA described the shortage of school places for SEN pupils as a \"crisis\" because an estimated 164 children are without a confirmed place for September 2025.\nBut Ms Cubitt said teachers were worried they may not be able to meet the needs of SEN pupils and she argued better leadership and support for schools is required.\n\"I haven't seen any evidence that any school is saying: 'I don't want these children,'\" Ms Cubitt told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"What we're hearing is: 'We're concerned that we won't be able to support these children,' and I think that's fair enough.\"\nTeaching unions have raised concerns that not all schools have the required training and facilities in place to cater for pupils with complex needs at short notice.\nMs Cubitt said highlighting those problems was \"entirely reasonable\".\n\"I think what we're seeing is not a reluctance, it's because they care.\"\nShe said the concerns of teachers, parents and everyone involved in the issue must be listened to.\nCharlie, eight, without schooling since October\nA mother whose eight-year-old son has not had a suitable school place since October told the BBC's Nolan Show the wait was stressful and \"very difficult\".\nFay Watson's son Charlie, who has special needs, previously attended a special unit within a mainstream school, but the placement was not sufficient to meet his requirements.\n\"He does want to go to a school, he does want to feel like he belongs somewhere, but he does have some trauma from the experience not working out for him,\" she said.\n\"He needs somewhere very nurturing for his needs and it is going to take a lot of time to reintegrate him, especially given how long we've waited this year.\n\"The longer he's out of school, the harder it's going to be to reintegrate him into a new placement.\"\nFaye tried to get emergency tuition for her son since he left school but said her request was rejected \"because he has nowhere to go, so that's kind of ironic\".\nShe said special units within mainstream schools are \"very good environments\" for many SEN children, but not all pupils can be accommodated.\n\"They definitely need a lot of resourcing to help them. They need OT (occupational therapy) equipment, they need access to OTs (occupational therapists), to speech therapists.\n\"There are quite complex children who are now going into these unit environments.\"\nCharlie is now waiting on a special school place for September.\nHowever, Ms Cubitt said: \"This hesitation from schools is not necessarily resistance, it is responsibility.\n\"And certainly the question I have is - if they're not responding, why?\"\nShe said she believed the EA would have known schools' feelings through previous engagement on the issue and she questioned the assistance they had been offered.\n\"The perspective of trying to force schools to do something without the message coming alongside that that 'we are strongly going to support you, these are the things we're going to do'; without a clear message to parents - it's just wholly unacceptable,\" she said.\n'Nothing has changed' says new watchdog\nMs Cubitt was appointed as Northern Ireland's first independent autism reviewer last August.\nHer role involves reviewing the adequacy of public services provided to autistic people, their families and carers.\n\"I'm almost a year into my post and see that essentially nothing has changed,\" she told Good Morning Ulster.\nIn relation to the SEN school place shortage, Ms Cubitt said the EA was also overwhelmed by the situation and \"good government leadership\" was needed.\nThe chair of Stormont's education committee said the crisis in SEN provision had been building over the past 15 years but \"we have now hit a very, very low point\".\nNick Mathison said \"we shouldn't be dealing with this four days out from the end of term - this is a system failure.\"",
