    "text": "A woman in her 90s was rescued from beneath the rubble of a collapsed house Saturday in western Japan, five days after a powerful earthquake struck the region and killed more than 126 people. The woman, who has not been identified, had been trapped beneath the first floor of the two-story structure in the town of Suzu after the 7.56 magnitude earthquake rocked the area, The New York Times reported. She was rescued at about 8:20 p.m. local time and was taken to an area hospital, according to the officer of Ishikawa Prefecture. The Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the woman was responsive but was believed to be suffering from hypothermia, the BBC reported. On Sunday, a doctor told reporters that the woman was well enough to speak, but her legs were injured, according to CNN . Kume Takanori, a member of the emergency rescue team, told NHK that the woman’s knees had been stuck under furniture between the first and second floor, CNN reported. It took hours to free her, Takanori said. The Times , citing experts, reported that the window for finding survivors after an earthquake is typically three days. It is possible to survive for longer periods, depending on access to water and food, temperatures in the area and the extent of the person’s injuries. The death toll from the earthquake continues to rise, with at least 222 people still reported as missing, according to the newspaper. Wajima city has had the highest number of fatalities, with 69, The Guardian reported. Suzu has 38 deaths. © 2024 Cox Media Group",

    "title": "Sierra’s Surprise Snowpack Surge: 26+ Inches of Snow in One Day",
    "text": "A May storm dumped over two feet of snow in one day on parts of the California mountain range. While spring was springing across much of the Northern Hemisphere, California’s Sierra Nevada still looked very much like winter in early May 2024. A weather station at Donner Pass measured 26.4 inches (67 centimeters) of snowfall on May 5, marking the snowiest day there in the 2023-2024 season. The system of wet weather had mostly cleared the area when the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on NASA’s Terra satellite acquired an image (right) of the snowy Sierras at 11 a.m. local time (18:00 Universal Time) on May 5. An image from May 3 (left) shows the region before the storm moved through. The images are false-color (bands 7-2-1) to distinguish the snow (blue) from the clouds (white). Impact of the Snowstorm The blast of snow created treacherous driving conditions and caused highway closures in the Lake Tahoe area, including Interstate 80 over Donner Summit, according to news reports . Elsewhere in the mountain range, Mammoth Mountain Ski Area reported receiving 10 inches (25 centimeters) of new snow in the storm, and Yosemite Valley dazzled in a fresh coat of white. Snowpack Conditions Sierra Nevada snowpack is known for its booms and busts. After more than a decade of either unusually wet or unusually dry years, snowpack in the Sierras has been uncharacteristically close to average in 2024. Prior to the early-May storm, accumulated snowfall for the current water year at Donner Pass was within one inch of the 1991-2020 average (360 inches), according to the Central Sierra Snow Laboratory . The snow on May 5 nudged the total to 108 percent of the average for that location. Late Season Snowfall Although the 2023-2024 winter season got off to a dry start, storms later in the season replenished the snowpack across much of the range. Between February 28 and March 3, an atmospheric river and a winter storm delivered widespread precipitation to the western U.S. and dropped an estimated 4 to 10 feet (1 to 3 meters) of snow in the Northern and Central Sierras. Following the May snowfall, the California Department of Water Resources reported that the snow water equivalent was above average in the Northern Sierra, close to average in the central part of the range, and below average in the southern portion.

    "text": "Retired police sergeant on vacation with family rescues couple from sinking car CINCINNATI ( [WXIX](https://www.fox19.com/2024/06/21/retired-cpd-sergeant-family-rescue-unknown-tri-state-couple-during-florida-vacation/)/Gray News) - A retired Cincinnati police sergeant and his family saved an Ohio couple who just happened to be vacationing in the same area in Florida. The Ramsey family is from Ohio, while the Bell family lives in northern Kentucky. Up until June 11, the two families had no idea they lived so close to one another. Some might call it a coincidence. Others will say it’s luck, but these two families call it a miracle. Dean and Shana Ramsey recall the moment they said they almost drowned while vacationing in Siesta Key, Florida. Several streets flooded that day after the area received more than 11 inches of rain, an abnormal amount, according to Sarasota County officials. “You couldn’t see anything but rain and water,” Dean Ramsey recalled. With several cars stalled on the road, the couple said they tried to pull off on what they thought was land. “The water sucked us right into that lagoon and that was it,” Dean Ramsey explained. Watching in horror from their condo was retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant Mike Bell, his wife Ginger Bell and their three young kids. The Bell family responded. “We were able to stop, slow things down, and assess and make some decisions on how we were going to move forward,” Mike Bell said. That plan started with Mackenzie Bell giving valuable information to 911. “I remembered they needed to know the address, so that’s the first thing I told her and then I told her a car is in the pond and there was two people in there,” Mike’s and Ginger Bell’s daughter, Mackenzie Bell, said. Meanwhile, the retired sergeant and his wife, who is an emergency medical doctor, took action. “I went over to the edge of the water and realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” Mike Bell recounted from that moment. “At that time, Ginger exited the front door next to the pond. I look at her and said, ‘We need flotation devices.’” That’s where little Hank Bell came in. “I didn’t want them to die, so I ran as fast as I could,” Hank Bell explained. “I went up the elevator, which is extremely slow, and I knew there were stairs that were faster. So, I ran down the stairs.” Flotation devices in hand, the Bell kids handed them to their parents who were already in the water. “He went into the lady’s side and I went into the man’s side,” Ginger Bell said. “She was able to climb out on her own, but I put the boogie board right in front of her. She got her body on the boogie board and that’s when I started paddling and we kicked over to the side.” Ginger Bell ran into some issues helping Dean Ramsey. “When he was trying to get out, his foot got stuck, so he was on his back with one foot out and one foot stuck in the steering wheel,” Ginger Bell remembered. “I looked at her and I said, ‘I’m stuck, I can’t,’” Dean Ramsey remembered. “At that time, I was like, ‘I’m going down with the car,’ but she’s like, ‘Get out of this car! You got to get out! Kick your leg!’ I started thrashing my leg and my foot popped out.” The rescue took about five minutes. Back on dry land, the Ramsey family saw their rescuers as “guardian angels.” The families say they have plans to reunite in the near future. The Bell family wants to remind residents to always be mindful of their surroundings and assess a situation before getting involved. They said if your car is going in a body of water, roll down the windows or punch them out by hitting the corners. Those tactics could save a life. Copyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "Tokio, 2 ago (EFE).- Japón registró el pasado julio las mayores temperaturas medias diarias que constan para ese mes desde que hay registros históricos, debido a una ola de calor procedente del Pacífico, según informó la Agencia Meteorológica de Japón (JMA).\nLa temperatura media diaria del pasado julio para todo el archipiélago nipón ascendió a 26,22 grados, lo que supone un incremento de 2,16 °C respecto a la media registrada para ese mes entre 1991 y 2020.\nSe trata de la mayor temperatura media observada en julio desde que la JMA comenzó a tomar estos datos en 1898, y de un récord para el mismo mes por segundo año consecutivo.\nEl termómetro superó los 40 grados en siete puntos del país varios días durante el mes pasado, según la JMA, que también señaló que en lo que va de año se han anotado 3.509 instancias de \"calor extremo\" o mediciones en las que se superaron los 35 °C en los cerca de 1.000 puntos de observación meteorológica del país.\nLa JMA señaló que este año el archipiélago nipón se ha visto afectado por un sistema de aire caliente en el Pacífico en el contexto de calentamiento global, lo que ha provocado temperaturas más altas de lo habitual durante julio.\n\"Al igual que el año pasado, se han combinado una serie de factores para producir temperaturas récord y prevemos que este calor continúe durante agosto y más adelante\", señaló Masayuki Hirai, responsable de previsiones climatológicas de la JMA, en una comparecencia ante los medios.\nEste mismo viernes, gran parte del oeste, el centro y el norte de Japón se encuentran bajo alerta por altas temperaturas, con el termómetro superando los 38 e incluso los 39 grados en puntos de prefecturas como Kyoto, Osaka o Yamaguchi.\nLas autoridades niponas recomiendan a los ciudadanos de las áreas afectadas mantenerse hidratados, usar aire acondicionado u otros sistemas de ventilación y evitar salir al exterior en las horas de mayores temperaturas del día.

    "title": "Everything we know about MapleLand – Release date and details",
    "text": "The highly anticipated Roblox -inspired MapleStory Worlds has finally been released outside of Asia, but one of its biggest features is noticeably absent from the release: MapleLand . For many, MapleLand is the best shot of Classic MapleStory , also known to many as OSMS or Old School MapleStory . We’ve put together everything we know about MapleLand including its release date and what players can expect on release.\nScreenshot by Destructoid Release Date – When does MapleLand release on MapleStory Worlds? Even though MapleLand was originally believed to have been a launch game on MapleStory Worlds , it appears that has changed.\nAccording to the developer, MapleLand is trying to come to the global release of MapleStory Worlds very soon after the global release , which was on October 16, 2024. The entire MapleLand game has to be translated from Korean to English in order to make the final transition to the global release of MapleStory Worlds , which shouldn’t take long.\nThe best way to keep track of the progress of MapleLand is to login to MapleStory Worlds and check the new releases section. Once MapleLand is translated and releases on MapleStory Worlds , it will surely be the most played game on the new platform.\nDetails – What is MapleLand? Now let’s talk about what MapleLand actually is. At its core, MapleLand is a creation of the classic original MapleStory that tries to replicate the experience of the original MapleStory MMORPG launch. Millions of people grew up playing MapleStory , a popular 2D sidescroller MMORPG that was released back in 2003. Since then, the game has undergone many changes in its over two-decade lifespan, leading many players to reminisce about the classic days of MapleStory , when the MMORPG was a bit more hardcore but also a bit more streamlined and rewarding.\nOn October 16, 2024, Nexon released its newest project, MapleStory Worlds , globally. Previously it was only available in South Korea, but players globally can now access MapleStory Worlds .\nIn summary, MapleStory Worlds is similar to Roblox in that it provides a tool for players to create their own worlds and even games inside of MapleStory Worlds using the popular MapleStory engine. Similar to how Roblox has a variety of many different games in various genres including RPGs, simulation games, adventure games, and more, MapleStory Worlds will let players create any sort of game they want using MapleStory systems and assets.\nThe most popular creation on the South Korea version of MapleStory Worlds is MapleLand . Created by the developer behind the most well-known MapleStory private server dev in South Korea, formerly known as Whitestar and their old school MapleStory server called OdinMS. At its core, MapleLand creates an authentic 1-to-1 classic MapleStory (OSMS) experience, allowing players to relive the original launch days of the popular MMORPG.\nAll of MapleLand is created and run through MapleStory Worlds , meaning there’s no fear of copyright infringement-style shutdowns for MapleLand , and the developer can continue to support it and build upon it, creating a World of Warcraft Classic like situation for MapleStory .\nWhether you’re looking to try the classic MapleStory experience for the first time, or looking to relive the old launch days, MapleLand via MapleStory Worlds will be the best way for you to do so.\nYou can download the MapleStory Worlds client directly from the Nexon website .",

    "text": "The federal government is facing a dwindling window to regulate the use of artificial intelligence on the campaign trail before the 2024 election. But a brewing turf war between federal agencies is threatening one of the most significant attempts to set new rules for the tools. The chair of the Federal Communications Commission announced a plan last month to require that politicians disclose AI use in TV and radio ads. But the proposal is facing unexpected opposition from a top official on the Federal Election Commission, which has been considering its own new rules on AI use by campaigns. The dispute – along with inaction at the FEC and Congress – could leave voters with limited federal protections against those who use AI to mislead the public or mask their political messages during the campaign’s final stretch. New generative AI technologies have already proved capable of creating uncannily realistic images. “AI has the potential to be very influential in our elections, and right now, there’s a total vacuum of regulation on this issue,” said Ellen Weintraub, the Democratic vice chair of the Federal Election Commission. Over a dozen states have adopted laws regulating AI use in campaigns, but Congress has yet to step in, despite broad concern over the tool’s impact on Capitol Hill. Adav Noti, executive director of the Campaign Legal Center and a former FEC associate general counsel, said that, given the bureaucratic quagmire, the likelihood of having federal restrictions on AI use in place for campaigning ahead of the November presidential election is “extremely low.” “The cavalry aren’t coming,” he said. AI deepfakes have targeted officials and politicians this year. Democratic operative Steve Kramer was indicted last month over an AI-generated robocall impersonating President Biden that instructed New Hampshire residents not to vote early. Soon after, the FCC banned AI-generated voice imitations in robocalls. Last week, a deepfake video emerged purporting to show State Department spokesman Matthew Miller calling the Russian city of Belgorod a potential target for Ukrainian strikes with American weapons. Any major AI problems in the campaign could cause headaches for the Biden administration, which has made moving rapidly on AI a policy centerpiece. Biden issued an executive order in October that required a range of federal agencies to swiftly formulate regulations on the use of AI technologies. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, announced plans last month to consider a rule requiring that political advertisers include on-air or written disclosures when they deploy “AI-generated content.” But this week, a top elections official and a member of the FCC, both Republicans, threw a wrench in those plans by accusing the agency’s Democratic leadership of overstepping its authority. FEC Chairman Sean Cooksey wrote in a letter to Rosenworcel that the proposal would trample on his agency’s role as the top enforcer of federal campaign law. The FCC’s maneuver could create “irreconcilable conflicts” with the FEC’s potential rules and prompt a legal challenge, Cooksey wrote. The FCC proposal has not yet been made public, but Rosenworcel said the move would not prohibit AI use but instead make “clear consumers have a right to know when AI tools are being used in the political ads they see.” In an interview, Cooksey argued that rolling out disclosure requirements so close to an election could do more harm than good by creating public confusion about the standards. “That will sow chaos with political campaigns and interfere with the upcoming election,” he said. Fellow Republicans in Congress and at the FCC balked at Rosenworcel’s plan. The chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., said in a statement that the agency “does not have the expertise or authority to regulate political campaigns or AI.” FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, a Republican, argued that because the rules would apply only to political ads on TV and radio and not online streaming platforms, such as YouTubeTV or Hulu, the sudden addition of AI disclosures in some places but not others would “ultimately be very confusing to the consumers.” He joined Cooksey in calling on the agency to table the matter until after the election, if not indefinitely. “The FCC needs to, first of all, not introduce a sea change in the regulation of political speech on the eve of a national election,” Carr said. Rosenworcel said in a statement that the FCC has required campaign ads to disclose sponsors for decades and that adapting these rules to the arrival of new technologies is nothing new. “The time to act on public disclosure of AI use is now,” she said. “There are benefits to this technology, but we also know that it has the potential to mislead the public and misinform voters with made-up voices and images that impersonate people without their permission.” With a 3-2 majority, Democrats at the FCC could bypass Carr’s objections and move ahead with the plans ahead of the election, but the specter of a legal challenge may bog down the effort. Without legislation outlining how AI should be regulated, any federal agency’s actions “will almost certainly be challenged one way or another in court,” Noti said. Multiple federal initiatives aimed at reining in AI’s impact on the 2024 race face an uncertain fate in Washington, even as officials in both parties warn about the technology’s potential to wreak havoc on the electoral process. The FEC is considering its own petition on the issue, which would explicitly ban candidates from using AI to deliberately misrepresent opponents in political ads. But Democratic and Republican FEC officials alike have expressed skepticism about the agency’s ability to step into the matter and called on Congress to set new rules in lieu of the proposal. Unlike the FCC, the FEC is evenly divided between the two major parties with a rotating chair – a setup that has often deadlocked the agency as election reform has become increasingly polarized. On Capitol Hill, senators have advanced a package of bills that would require political ads generated by AI to feature disclaimers, among other restrictions. Yet despite calls for action on the issue from top congressional leaders, Congress’s window to act before Election Day is rapidly closing. “While it’s a good thing that federal agencies are looking at the potential for AI to upend campaigns and elections, we cannot wait to put comprehensive guardrails in place to meet these threats head on,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who is leading the legislative effort. Success. Please wait for the page to reload. If the page does not reload within 5 seconds, please refresh the page.

HERMOSILLO, Sonora.- En un operativo conjunto entre autoridades de los tres niveles de gobierno que conforman la Mesa Estatal de Seguridad en Sonora, se logró la detención de un individuo y el decomiso de una importante cantidad de fentanilo en polvo y tabletas, así como de vehículos. Agentes de la Policía Federal Ministerial llevaron a cabo la detención de Héctor Ricardo “N”, en la carretera 36 norte, con destino a Puerto Libertad, específicamente en el kilómetro 49+800, cerca del puente Bacoachi. La acción se llevó a cabo tras una denuncia ciudadana. Durante la inspección de un tracto camión de la marca Peña Motors, se encontraron doce paquetes de polvo blanco con la inscripción “55″ en un compartimiento oculto en el camarote, debajo de la cama, y una bolsa conteniendo tabletas de color azul detrás del tablero de mando. Tanto la persona detenida como la droga asegurada fueron puestas a disposición del Ministerio Público Federal para llevar a cabo las investigaciones correspondientes. Fentanilo, una droga peligrosa El fentanilo es una droga sintética extremadamente potente, cuyo uso inadecuado puede tener consecuencias fatales. El decomiso de esta cantidad significativa de fentanilo representa un golpe importante al narcotráfico en la región, de acuerdo con la Mesa Estatal de Seguridad. Este operativo es parte de una serie de acciones continuas para combatir el narcotráfico y garantizar la seguridad de la población en el estado de Sonora. Las autoridades mantendrán su compromiso en esta lucha constante contra el crimen organizado. Se espera que las autoridades continúen brindando información sobre el desarrollo de las investigaciones y cualquier avance relevante relacionado con este caso en particular.
