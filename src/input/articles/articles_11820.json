    "text": "Durante a preparação para o Enem (Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio) e vestibulares, é comum que os estudantes se depararem com momentos de tensão e irritabilidade. No entanto, quando em excesso, algumas emoções podem ser prejudiciais para o desempenho acadêmico e para outros setores da vida. Pensando nisso, o Dr. Jô Furlan, médico, professor e pesquisador na área de Neurociência do Comportamento, ensina uma técnica que ajudará os vestibulandos a relaxarem na hora dos estudos. Confira! Passo 1 Sente-se confortavelmente em uma cadeira e mantenha as costas e os pés bem apoiados. Deixe suas mãos apoiadas sobre as pernas. Passo 2 Feche os olhos e respire profundamente 3 vezes. Passo 3 Conte mentalmente de 10 a 1, visualizando os números à medida que faz a contagem. Ao mesmo tempo, imagine os números sendo direcionados para o seu cérebro. Passo 4 Ao chegar no número 1, se imagine observando bilhões de neurônios capazes de armazenar uma quantidade incontável de informações. Passo 5 Imagine estes neurônios se transformando em arquivos que armazenam, de forma organizada, cada informação estudada para a sua prova. Passo 6 Use sua criatividade e visualize as informações adquiridas sendo armazenadas. Passo 7 Ainda visualizando, repita mentalmente a seguinte frase: “Eu posso, eu mereço, sou capaz e vale a pena”. Em seguida, visualize-se fazendo uma excelente prova. Passo 8 Contando de 1 a 10, retorne à atenção para o local no qual se encontra. Observação: o exercício deve durar entre 5 e 10 minutos.",

    "text": "Ziyad Almaayouf has been thrust into the limelight since Saudi Arabia entered the boxing sphere. The undefeated 6-0 pro is the Kingdom's first professional boxer and has been a part of some massive cards both at home and abroad. While most boxers start their pro careers in small hall shows and leisure centres, Almaayouf made his debut on the undercard of Oleksandr Usyk vs Anthony Joshua II. However, that wasn't his first taste of the sport. \"I started boxing when I was 10 years old,\" Almaayouf told talkSPORT's Hawksbee and Jacobs . READ MORE ON BOXING \"But I moved to the United States when I was 19 years old. The reason being that from 10 years old to 19 years old I didn't have a boxing ring, I didn't have bags. \"I didn't have a proper heavy bag that moved when you punched it, I had never seen a speed bag, I had never seen a double-end bag. \"There was never boxing on TV because the fights were mainly in the US and the time difference was so bad that boxing wasn't really of interest for them to have it on at 3am or 4am. \"So you would never accidentally fall in love with the sport. So people look at my career now, they see Saudi's involvement in my career now and they think this is how it has always been for me. Most read in Boxing \"A privileged one, a smooth ride. You don't understand that nine out of the 15 years I didn't even have a proper boxing gym. \"So when I moved it was like I started again completely. We had only three amateur tournaments [in Saudi Arabia] every year. \"In the UK and the US, you have amateur tournaments and fights every weekend. It was a very different world back then.\" During his three-year stint in the paid ranks, Almaayouf has gone from not knowing what a speed bag is to fighting on the undercard of Terence Crawford vs Israil Madrimov and Joshua vs Francis Ngannou. His ultimate goal in the sport is to inspire the next generation of Saudi boxers and give them what he didn't have growing up - a role model. \"Being in boxing at a young age I was looking for idols so I Googled 'Saudi boxer' and I found nobody,\" he added. \"I found Prince Naseem , he was amazing, I looked up to him but he is from the UK where he had all the equipment, the ring and all of that. \"I didn't have that so I couldn't relate. So then I thought 'I want to be that person. \"I want to be the person when you Google Saudi Arabian boxer, they find me' and then it is not only for me it's for the ones that come after me, and that's the real purpose.\" Boxing WhatsApp channel Get the latest fight news, reaction and the best opinion from talkSPORT pundits in our Boxing WhatsApp channel.

    "title": "If trans athletes can compete in women’s events, then women’s sport is over, writes Olympic gold medalist DALEY THOMPSON",
    "text": "Competing in the decathlon, in which I won gold at the 1980 and 1984 Olympics, I have seen performances from some inspiring women. But the truth is that no matter how hard they trained, they would never have been able to match my times (apart from the 1,500 meter race, where some women were able to beat me). My physique was too different, too masculine. It would have been tremendously unfair for me to compete against them. My victory would have been a farce. So when I see trans women like American swimmer Lia Thomas or Canadian cyclist Veronica Ivy (formerly known as Rachel McKinnon) on the podium, I know they are biologically male and the physical advantage has helped them win. All my sporting instincts rebel against that. For sport to mean anything, it must be fair. Women’s 100 meters final of the 19th Asian Games at Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Stadium on September 30, 2023 Lia Thomas during a swimming competition on the University of Pennsylvania campus in 2019 That’s why we need clarity, like that offered by Boris Johnson, who said: ‘I don’t think biological men should compete in women’s sporting events. Maybe it’s a bit controversial to say, but it makes sense to me. “I also think that women should have spaces – whether in hospitals, prisons or locker rooms – dedicated to them.” I, too, am strongly opposed to allowing trans women to participate in women’s sports. I don’t consider this controversial or political. It’s about justice. Trans athletes say they do everything they can to compete fairly, for example by taking testosterone blockers. Let’s put aside the fact that I have strong reservations about the use of any hormone-disrupting drug in sport. But it seems glaringly obvious that no pill can eliminate the benefits that come from growing biologically like men in terms of muscular and skeletal strength. These trans women have gone through male puberty. They have longer limbs, broader shoulders, thicker bones, better power-to-weight ratios, and larger heart and blood volumes. Nothing they can do will change that: they will always outperform biological women. Canadian cyclist Rachel McKinnon warms up before competing at the 2019 UCI Track Cycling Masters World Championships in Manchester This is an issue I’ve seen grow from a minor concern to a national controversy in sports – and beyond – although, in recent months, it seems as if something is changing. My opinion is that the sport should have a women’s section and a new, open class where transgender women would be welcome and could compete fairly. There should be space for trans women in sport, but not at the expense of all women. Like any decent human being, I fully support everyone’s right to present themselves however they want, use whatever name and pronouns they feel reflect their true self, and live their lives however they wish. It is sad that equal rights for transgender people have been suppressed for so long. Over the past 20 years, we have seen the rise of a more compassionate society, but the unintended consequence is injustice towards women. And getting rid of outdated gender stereotypes should not result in biologically male predators – who identify as women – having access to women’s prisons or domestic violence shelters. Women have fought hard to achieve their safe spaces. You have to respect them. I have spoken increasingly openly about this on social media and people who attend my gym in Putney, south-west London, have started to ask me about it. How can a young woman feel inspired to play sports if she knows she will compete (and lose) against biological men? And how can a father feel that his daughter is safe in a locker room where biologically intact male athletes dress and shower next to her? Sir Keir Starmer, leader of the Labor Party, found himself unable to say what a woman is. Is not difficult; When in doubt, ask any five-year-old. I’m not interested in partisan politics. I am not surprised, however, that Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens are questioned by voters when they lack the courage to state simple biological facts. Some of my good friends, including Czech-American tennis star Martina Navratilova and record-breaking British competitive swimmer Sharron Davies, have done so and, as a result, have received shocking abuse from trans extremists. I want everyone to know that I am by their side. I have also been horrified by the violent threats directed at the novelist JK Rowling, who has spoken of nothing but serene common sense. Does that make me a feminist? Well, no one has ever called me that, but there is a first time for everything. What I do know is that I am not transphobic or misogynist, two insults that have been thrown at me on Twitter. If we are afraid to tell the truth, we are really in trouble. And if trans women are allowed to compete in women’s categories, then women’s sport is not only in trouble: it is finished.",

    "text": "Dec. 28 (UPI) — The U.S. Treasury said it has identified numerous financial entities responsible for facilitating financial aid from Iran to Houthi rebels. The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control on Thursday designated one person and three entities responsible for facilitating financial aid from Iran to Houthi forces active in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The statement from OFAC named head of the Currency Exchangers Association in Sanaa, Yemen, and three exchange houses in Yemen and Turkey responsible for helping transfer millions of dollars to the Houthis at the direction of Sa’id al-Jamal, who is affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force. As a result of the Treasury’s sanctions, all property and interests in property of the designated entities that are in the U.S. are now blocked and must be reported to OFAC. The office also warned any persons or financial institutions that engage in certain transactions with the sanctioned entities may be subject to sanctions themselves. “Today’s action underscores our resolve to restrict the illicit flow of funds to the Houthis, who continue to conduct dangerous attacks on international shipping and risk further destabilizing the region,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson. Houthi forces have launched numerous missiles at commercial vessels near Yemen’s coastline,”sharply” disrupting the free flow of commerce throughout the region since October, the Treasury said. Thursday’s action came shortly after Iran’s supreme leader Ayatolla Ali Khameni denounced Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza as “bloodthirsty and cruel” and called on Islamic governments to take action to prevent vital shipments from reaching Israel. Houthis most recently launched a missile strike Tuesday against a container ship owned by Swiss shipping giant MSC in the Red Sea en route from Saudi Arabia to Pakistan. MSC said all crew were safe with no injuries, and no details of damage to the vessel was reported.",

    "text": "火箭正值一波7连胜，在七连胜期间火箭进攻效率122.1联盟第二，防守效率107.5联盟第四，净效率值14.6联盟第一。期间杰伦-格林与阿尔佩伦-申京双核驱动发挥的很出色。\n杰伦格林最近的13场比赛终于拿到一次30+，他本赛季拿到30+时火箭10胜0负，他已经拿到生涯47次30+是21届新秀中断档第一的存在，除此之外他还在对阵费城的比赛中拿到13次助攻刷新生涯新高，格林似乎正在朝着 乌度卡 的设想——得分控卫发展。\n北京时间3月20日，休媒BiasedHoston在社媒上与球迷们展开了激烈的讨论，讨论的话题就是火箭该用格林交易其他球星还是继续长期持有格林。\n他认为：格林目前还不算一位 全明星 ，但最近他的稳定性与组织进攻方面有了长足的提升。考虑到这些因素火箭用他换布克来提升阵容效果不会太大，继续持有格林是合乎逻辑的。\n不过我会考虑引入一些保障条款，比如休赛期追逐马利克-蒙克、 比斯利 这样的球员。这样如果下赛季球队阵容需要调整也不会选入困境。格林长期留队的话蒙克就可以成为球队的第六人。\n另外，也许像扎克-拉文这样的得分后卫在今夏的价码也会持续下滑，这样火箭就有希望将他引入。如果国王想要格林会交易筹码的话那么我认为不划算，我听说火箭内部对格林的期望很高。\n他还在评论区与火箭球迷们讨论未来，他认为本赛季不会是火箭最好的一个赛季，自己对火箭明年充满希望，因为火箭本赛季是走出泥沼的一个赛季，本赛季就要夺冠显然不太可能。休赛期火箭对阵容的调整会是一个关键因素，明年才是火箭冲冠年份。\n文/颜小白：火箭观察",
