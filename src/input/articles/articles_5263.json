    "text": "( MENAFN - IANS) Mumbai, Jan 31 (IANS) bollywood actress Parineeti Chopra recently found herself stuck in traffic on her way to a shoot.\nIn a video posted on her Instagram stories, the 'Kesari' actress captured the frustrating situation and humorously expressed her exhaustion before even reaching her destination.“Will the traffic ever end? Tired before you reach the shoot,” she wrote in the caption.\nIn the video, Parineeti can be seen sitting in her car, visibly stuck in the congested traffic. In her previous post, the 'Ishaqzaade' actress revealed the fatigue that comes with long hours of filming.\nOn the 37th day of shooting, Chopra shared a candid moment, revealing the toll her hectic schedule had taken on her. In a video posted from her car, she humorously labeled it as“Day 36.” However, in a follow-up post, the actress shared a photo of her script, admitting,“Actually Day 37. Blame the fatigue.” Through these posts, Parineeti offered fans a behind-the-scenes look at the demanding nature of her work.\nShe also dropped a video of the camera team and wrote,“Cameras also holding onto each other for support.”\nPrior to this, the 36-year-old actress expressed her pride in her husband, politician Raghav Chadha, commending his efforts to address the problem of overpriced food at airports. As the Delhi elections approach, she praised him for launching the #UdaanYatriCafe, an initiative designed to offer affordable food and drinks to travellers.\nIn a video shared by Chopra, Raghav, an AAP MP, discussed the issue of inflated food prices at airports in Parliament, urging for \"corrective measures\" to make air travel more affordable for passengers.\nSharing the video, Parineeti wrote,“So so proud of you, my @raghavchadha88, for being a true leader for the people, and fixing a real problem! Overpriced food at airports is an issue that resonates with so many Indians (including us), and your voice has brought a real change starting with the #UdaanYatriCafe. Yayy for cheaper food and drinks at airports! Proud of you, my Ragaii!.”\nWork-wise, Parineeti Chopra is currently filming the second schedule of an untitled drama. Additionally, the actress is gearing up for her role in Anurag Singh's highly anticipated thriller \"Sanki,\" where she will star alongside Varun Dhawan.\nMENAFN31012025000231011071ID1109151947",

    "text": "Nuevo presidente del TC, Napoleón Estévez, garantiza imparcialidad y la defensa derechos e institucionalidad. Con la promesa de imparcialidad y de seguir defendiendo y proteger la soberanía, la nacionalidad, la dignidad humana, los derechos fundamentales, el orden constitucional y la democracia, juraron ayer los cinco nuevos jueces del Tribunal Constitucional (TC), entre ellos el segundo presidente que asume esa alta corte en sus doce años de existencia. Con la posesión de esos cinco jueces, el TC completa su ciclo de renovación, porque con la salida de los últimos cinco magistrados elegidos para el primer pleno en el 2011, no queda ninguno de los escogidos en el origen del tribunal. Al pronunciar un discurso luego de su instalación como nuevo presidente del TC, Napoleón Estévez Lavandier, acompañado de los cuatro nuevos miembros Fidias Aristy Payano, Sonia Díaz Inoa, Army Ferreira Reyes y Amaury Amílcar Reyes, dio garantías de enfrentar dignamente todos los retos que los ciudadanos y las ciudadanas pongan ante esta jurisdicción, sometida únicamente a la Constitución de la República y cuyo único límite será el respeto de las competencias de los poderes del Estado. En una alocución en la que mostró en todo momento respeto al presidente emérito saliente y a los otros cuatro miembros que fueron reemplazados, Estévez Lavandier afirmó que aún son muchos los desafíos que se tienen por delante para lograr que el Tribunal Constitucional siga cumpliendo a cabalidad su tarea de apuntalar los derechos fundamentales. “Tenemos por delante la tarea de reforzar las capacidades y la independencia del Tribunal Constitucional, perfilando su carácter de órgano extrapoder sometido únicamente a la Constitución de la República. Sólo desde esta posición de completa autonomía podrá el tribunal garantizar efectivamente la defensa del orden constitucional, dirimir imparcialmente los asuntos de su competencia, así como proteger los derechos fundamentales que se cuentan entre los más preciados por cada hombre, por cada mujer y por la sociedad dominicana en general”, indicó. A título personal, como nuevo presidente del máximo órgano de la República Dominicana, Napoleón Estévez Lavandier, aseguró que el TC, compuesto siempre por 13 magistrados, está preparado para enfrentar exitosamente “con la bendición de Dios y el fervor de nuestros padres de la patria”, todos los desafíos que se presenten en lo adelante. “Esta competencia no la menciono por pura moda, retórica o elegante complacencia, sino porque es lo que vengo de jurar hace un momento y ha jurado cumplir cada uno de estos jueces, juezas, que componen el TC, todos dominicanos e independientes”, expresó. En ese sentido, prometió que durante los próximos nueve años que durará su presidencia en el TC, la República Dominicana continuará su “indetenible” avance social, económico y legal, tras indicar que su único aporte es acompañar esta transformación con la voluntad férrea de seguir fortaleciendo el estado social y democrático de derecho. “Nuestro objetivo es darle vida a nuestro texto constitucional, convertida en hechos tangibles. En definitiva, que los derechos consagrados en nuestra Ley Suprema no sean solo buenas intenciones, sino que se reflejen fielmente en el día a día de las personas, sin distinción alguna”, puntualizó. Órgano fuerte e independiente El nuevo presidente del Tribunal Constitucional indicó que en esta realidad convulsa y de rápidas transformaciones desde geopolíticas hasta tecnológicas, será más importante que nunca contar con un órgano constitucional fuerte e independiente que custodie los principios fundamentales y fundacionales de la nación, que garanticen la pluralidad y el equilibrio de poderes en todo momento. “Velaremos por el más estricto respeto de nuestra Carta Magna y su aplicación en todos los ámbitos y actuaciones, así como el respeto absoluto de los derechos fundamentales. Seguiremos comprometidos a lo interno de nuestra institución con prácticas éticas sólidas y buenas conductas intachables, al tiempo que mantendremos altos estándares de transparencia y rendición de cuentas”, manifestó. Por ello, adelantó que desde el TC se pondrán a disposición de la sociedad dominicana mecanismos de evaluación periódicos del desempeño de esa alta corte y que se seguirá desarrollando la labor pedagógica en torno a la Carta Magna y a las decisiones de esa corte. Concomitantemente con esto, dijo que desde la independencia que le confiere la Constitución al tribunal, se trabajará de cerca con el Poder Ejecutivo, el Legislativo y el Judicial para abordar problemas sistemáticos y así mejorar la coherencia y la funcionalidad del marco legal. Luego de ofrecer sus agradecimientos, Napoleón Estévez Lavandier resaltó que en la selección realizada por el Consejo Nacional de la Magistratura (CNM), se sientan precedentes plausibles. Mencionó que, primero, aumenta el número de juezas a la matrícula original con la designación de la magistrada Sonia Díaz Inoa y Army Ferreira Reyes. En segundo lugar, citó, se designa por primera vez a un exletrado del TC con el nombramiento del magistrado Amaury Reyes Torres, quien además llega como el más joven juez de la corta historia del tribunal, lo que constituye un reconocimiento y estímulo para todos los servidores constitucionales. Luego, en tercer lugar, indicó que con su designación se sienta el primer precedente de que un juez activo de la Suprema Corte de Justicia cruce al TC como ocurre frecuentemente en otros países. “Hoy colgamos la toga de juez supremo y nos ponemos la toga de juez constitucional, una transferencia bastante importante en el aspecto jurídico y de pensamiento”, pronunció. Milton Ray resalta la renovación En el último discurso como presidente del TC y ahora presidente emérito, Milton Ray Guevara, junto a los cuatro magistrados salientes Rafael Díaz Filpo, que era primer sustituto del presidente Ray Guevara; Lino Vásquez Sámuel, segundo sustituto del presidente Ray Guevara; Víctor Joaquín Castellanos Pizano y Justo Pedro Castellanos Khoury, resaltó la importancia de la renovación del TC en los doce años de funcionamiento. Con palabras cargadas de experiencia, Ray Guevara destacó: “Esta toma de posesión marca un instante fundamental en la historia del tribunal”, debido a que por primera vez los jueces que fueron escogidos en el pleno de origen pasan a la honrosa situación de retiro y, además, ha culminado así el proceso de renovación que ha permitido que esa alta corte se fuese instalando poco a poco a partir de la nada. “Porque lo único que nosotros recibimos cuando empezó el tribunal fue la Constitución de la República y la Ley Orgánica del tribunal y de los procedimientos constitucionales”, apuntó. Convencido de la importancia que tiene este proceso, Milton Ray Guevara explicó que en este momento, la “familia constitucional” se siente feliz de haber completado la renovación tal como el constituyente la pensó, tras señalar que hubiese sido muy difícil para un tribunal nuevo si a todos los jueces les hubiera tocado salir al mismo instante. “Habría produciéndose, entonces, una especie de ruptura en el trajinar del tribunal y en la elaboración de lo más importante que tiene, que es su jurisprudencia. Felizmente, la previsión del constituyente nos ha llevado a que este proceso se da cuando el tribunal tiene más de 7 mil sentencias”, comentó. El último discurso de don Milton Ray Guevara, como la mayoría le llama, estuvo acompañado de duras críticas al largo tiempo que tiene en proceso de construcción de la sede del TC que desde sus inicios ha sufrido de poco espacio. “Me han encomendado excusarlos de la estrechez del lugar. Ha habido cuentas de los deseos de festejar pero, desafortunadamente, los encargados de construir la sede central del Tribunal Constitucional tienen cinco años y medio entre las dos administraciones que hemos tenido y todavía no tenemos un local digno como lo merece el TC. Yo creo que al presidente Napoleón Ricardo Estévez Lavandier le va a tocar la dicha de que esto lo terminen. Yo no quisiera pensar que no lo terminen en su período”, se quejó. Vicepresidenta juramentó a jueces Antes de la toma de posesión de los jueces, la vicepresidenta Raquel Peña, en representación del presidente Luis Abinader, juramentó a los cinco nuevos jueces del TC, al igual que al primer y segundo sustituto del presidente, que son los magistrados Miguel Valera Montero y la magistrada Eunisis Vásquez Acosta, que ya formaban parte del pleno de esa alta corte. Durante el acto de juramentación, la vicemandataria felicitó a los miembros del Consejo Nacional de la Magistratura (CNM) por la labor realizada durante los últimos meses para convocar, preseleccionar, entrevistar, evaluar y finalmente escoger a los nuevos integrantes del TC. También, externó su felicitación a los jueces seleccionados por haber superado satisfactoriamente el proceso tras la presentación de sus credenciales y ser evaluados en las vistas públicas celebradas. Asimismo, Peña dirigió unas palabras de agradecimiento a los magistrados salientes del TC, representados por el presidente saliente, Milton Ray Guevara, por los últimos doce años de invaluable trabajo jurisprudencial. “Confiamos plenamente en que esta nueva composición del Tribunal continuará el camino pautado por las primeras cohortes, fortaleciendo la institucionalidad creciente de nuestra nación, manteniendo el equilibrio y fomentando la seguridad jurídica para todos”, expresó Peña. Peña estuvo acompañada de todos los miembros del CNM, excepto dos de ellos que presentaron excusas. Presidente TC dice: “No hay nada que temer” Los cinco nuevos jueces del TC completan una matrícula de 13 miembros que son los que componen esa alta corte. Los nuevos se unen a Domingo Antonio Gil, Alba Luisa Beard, María del Carmen Santana, José Alejandro Ayuso, Miguel Valera Montero, Manuel Ulises Bonelly, Eunisis Vásquez y José Alejandro Vargas. Luego de su juramentación, Estévez Lavandier fue preguntado sobre la advertencia hecha por el juez José Alejandro Vargas de que el TC nunca había estado tan en peligro como ahora. Sobre ello, el nuevo presidente del TC afirmó que aunque no ha conversado con el magistrado sobre ello, garantiza los estándares que tiene esa corte. Dijo que el juez Vargas es un patriota, que habla desde su sentimiento de nacionalidad y que no hay nada que temer.",

    "text": "The standoff between the state of Texas and the Biden administration over immigration enforcement at the U.S. southern border continues with no signs of easing any time soon.\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) declared his state has a constitutional right to defend itself despite federal statutes that stand in the way.\nIn a lengthy statement signed and dated Jan. 24, the Republican governor said: \"The federal government has broken the compact between the United States and the States. The Executive Branch of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting the States, including immigration laws on the books right now.\"\n\"President Biden has refused to enforce those laws and has even violated them. The result is that he has smashed records for illegal immigration,\" Abbott said.\nHe blamed the Biden administration for the roughly six million migrants who have illegally entered the U.S. over the past three years, alleging the administration has instructed its agencies to ignore the statutes that mandate the detention of illegal immigrants and to allow their en mass parole into the United States.\nThe Texas governor also noted the number of illegal immigrants released inside the country by the administration amounts to more than the total population of 33 states.\nHe pointed out that the framers included Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, promising the federal government \"shall protect each {state} against invasion\" and Article 1, Section 10, Clause 3, which acknowledges \"the States' sovereign interest in protecting their borders.\"\n\"The failure of the Biden Administration to fulfill the duties imposed by Article IV, Section 4 has triggered Article 1, Section 10, Clause 3, which reserves to this State the right of self-defense,\" Abbot continued. \"For these reasons, I have already declared an invasion under Article 1, Section 10, Clause 3 to invoke Texas's constitutional authority to defend and protect itself.\"\n\"That authority is the supreme law of the land and supersedes any federal statutes to the contrary. The Texas National Guard, the Texas Department of Public Safety, and other Texas personnel are acting on that authority, as well as state law, to secure the Texas border,\" the governor concluded.\nMy statement on Texas' constitutional right to self-defense.\n[pic.twitter.com/seNFZdmujP]\n— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX)\n[January 24, 2024]\n**Please sign up for\nCBN Newsletters to keep up to date with the news that matters most.*** Meanwhile, federal officials have renewed demands for The Lone Star state to give Border Patrol agents access to a riverfront park in the border city of Eagle Pass that is a popular corridor for migrants illegally entering the U.S.\nTexas has installed rows of razor wire in Shelby Park, which is located next to the Rio Grande. It is one of the most visible measures to deter migrants from crossing the river.\nAbbott also has authorized installing floating barriers in the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass and allowed troopers to arrest and jail thousands of migrants on trespassing charges. The Biden administration is challenging those actions in federal court.\nEarlier this week, the Republican governor said Texas will still use barbed wire to deter illegal immigration despite the Supreme Court ruling that federal agents can remove it.\nThe White House applauded the high court's order, which was handed down after a federal appeals court last month had forced federal agents to stop cutting the concertina wire.\n\"Texas' political stunts, like placing razor wire near the border, simply make it harder and more dangerous for frontline personnel to do their jobs,\" White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández said.\nSome Democratic lawmakers like Rep. Greg Casar (D-TX) and Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) have\ncalled on President Biden to launch a federal takeover of the Texas National Guard.\n\"If Abbott is defying yesterday's Supreme Court ruling, @POTUS needs to establish sole federal control of the Texas National Guard now,\" Casar posted on the social media platform X on Tuesday.\nOther Republican Governors Stand with Texas and Abbott\nMeanwhile, seven Republican governors, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, and Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte have voiced their support for Texas and Abbott's efforts to stop the flow of illegal immigrants.\nIn a\nvideo post to X on Thursday, DeSantis promised to continue to send help to Texas, \"because it's ultimately an American issue.\"\nThe governor explained Texas has every right to defend its border.\n\"If the Constitution was originally understood to mean that a state could not protect itself against an invasion, that the federal government could force the state to allow an invasion, the Constitution would have never been ratified in the first place. Texas would have never joined the Union when it did,\" DeSantis said.\n\"And if you look at Federalist {No.} 46, which Daniel Horowitz pointed out, James Madison talks about situations where federal encroachment can be mitigated by state action. So you have Texas here that's holding its ground; they have every right to fortify the border vis-à-vis an invasion. And that's article one section 10 of the Constitution. So they're in the right,\" he noted.\n\"They (Texas) have every right to hold their ground, to stay the course,\" DeSantis added. \"And Florida will be there, helping out every step of the way.\"\nDid you know?\nGod is everywhere—even in the news.

    "text": "Klimaanlage unsachgemäß montiert: 37-Jähriger stirbt – Wie geht es richtig?\nEin verhängnisvoller Vorfall in Iserlohn macht deutlich: Klimaanlagen können bei falscher Nutzung lebensgefährlich sein. So nutzt man das Gerät sicher.\nIserlohn – Die Hitze hat Deutschland auch in diesem Sommer fest im Griff. Klettern die Temperaturen, suchen viele Menschen nach Möglichkeiten zur Abkühlung – oft in den eigenen vier Wänden. Doch was Erleichterung bringen soll, kann bei unsachgemäßer Nutzung lebensbedrohlich werden. In der vergangenen Woche wurde ein 37-jähriger Mann tot in seiner Iserlohner Wohnung aufgefunden, wo ihm offenbar eine falsch betriebene Klimaanlage zum Verhängnis wurde.\nLaut Polizeibericht habe das Klimagerät Abgase aus einer Gastherme angesaugt und in der Wohnung verteilt. Die Staatsanwaltschaft Hagen ordnete eine Obduktion des Mannes an, die eine Kohlenmonoxidvergiftung bestätigte. Ein Mitbewohner des Mannes wurde schwer verletzt ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert, konnte dieses jedoch nach zwei Tagen wieder verlassen. Insgesamt versorgten die ambulanten Rettungsdienste Berichten des WDR zufolge acht Menschen.\nUnsachgemäße Nutzung von Klimageräten stellt eine Gefahr dar\nWerden mobile Klimaanlagen in schlecht belüfteten Räumen betrieben oder Abluftluftschläuche nicht richtig nach außen geführt, droht Lebensgefahr. Die Luftqualität verschlechtert sich und es sammelt sich Kohlenmonoxid in der Wohnung an. Die Initiative zur Prävention von Kohlenmonoxidvergiftungen wart vor der gleichzeitigen Nutzung mobiler Geräte und Gasthermen. Sie empfiehlt regelmäßige Wartungen sowie die Installation von Kohlenmonoxidmeldern, um Unfälle wie in Iserlohn zu vermeiden.\nEine hohe Konzentration von Kohlenmonoxid im Körper verringert die Fähigkeit des Blutes, Sauerstoff zu transportieren, so der Lungenfacharzt Dr. Harald Müller-Pawlowski im Interview mit dem rbb. Da Kohlenmonoxid weder Farbe, Geruch noch Geschmack hat, bemerken Betroffene oft nicht, wenn die Luft belastet ist.\nWie wird ein Klimagerät sicher installiert?\nUm mobile Klimageräte sicher zu nutzen, ist es wichtig, dass die warme Luft, die das Gerät aus dem Raum abführt, nicht wieder zurückströmt. Der Abluftschlauch darf nie im Raum liegen, sondern muss durch ein Fenster oder eine spezielle Öffnung ins Freie geleitet werden. So wird ein Unterdruck, der Schadstoffe aus anderen Quellen anziehen könnte, verhindert. Zudem muss der Schlauch fest an der Klimaanlage und am Fenster-Kit-Adapter befestigt werden.\nDas Gerät wird in einem Abstand von 30 bis 40 Zentimetern von der Wand platziert und nur über eine geeignete Steckdose (220-240V/50Hz) betrieben. Behalten Sie auch den Stromverbrauch im Blick. Die Ausblaseseite sollte in den Raum zeigen und nicht durch Möbel oder Vorhänge verdeckt werden. Ist die Klimaanlage in Betrieb, bleiben Fenster und Türen besser geschlossen.\nReinigung und Wartung verlängern die Lebensdauer\nEine regelmäßige Reinigung und Wartung ist entscheidend, um die Effizienz, Lebensdauer und Luftqualität von Klimageräten zu gewährleisten. Verschmutzte Filter und Bauteile führen nicht nur zu schlechterer Kühlleistung, sondern können auch gesundheitliche Risiken durch Schimmel, Bakterien und unangenehme Gerüche verursachen.\nDie Filter sollten vor Beginn der Kühl- oder Heizsaison gründlich gereinigt und während der Nutzung alle zwei Wochen kontrolliert und bei Bedarf gesäubert werden. Mindestens einmal jährlich steht eine Überprüfung durch einen Fachmann oder eine Fachfrau an. Dies umfasst die Reinigung schwer zugänglicher Teile wie Wärmetauscher und die Kontrolle der Kältemittelfüllung.\nPraktische Tipps zur Abkühlung mit mobilen Geräten\nNeben der richtigen Installation und Wartung der Klimaanlage gibt es weitere Tipps, die Sie sicher und kühl durch die nächste Hitzewelle bringen:\n- Stellen Sie das Gerät auf einen ebenen, stabilen Boden, damit es sicher steht und nicht kippen kann.\n- Ein Temperaturunterschied zwischen Außen- und Innentemperatur von maximal 6 Grad Celsius ist laut\nSWRideal. Heiß also: Bei 30 Grad Außentemperaturreicht eine Einstellung aus 24 Grad ausund schont Kreislauf sowie Gesundheit. - Eine Luftfeuchtigkeit zwischen 45 und 70 Prozent steigert zusätzlich das Wohlbefinden.\n- Lassen Sie das Gerät nicht dauerhaft laufen, sondern schalten Sie es gezielt ein, etwa morgens, wenn der Raum noch kühl ist, um die Temperatur zu halten. Viele Geräte sind hierfür mit einer Zeitschaltuhr ausgestattet.\nLangfristig kann der Kauf einer fest eingebauten Split-Klimaanlage eine effizientere Lösung sein, insbesondere in Verbindung mit einer Photovoltaikanlage. Für Bastler gibt es zudem die Möglichkeit, Monoblock-Klimageräte auf Zweischlauch-Betrieb umzurüsten, um die Effizienz zu steigern. Der tragische Vorfall in Iserlohn verdeutlicht jedenfalls die Notwendigkeit, die Risiken im Umgang mit Klimageräten und Gasthermen ernst zu nehmen (jaka)",

    "title": "Minimalists often share these 8 habits that promote happiness",
    "text": "There’s a clear distinction between living with less and simply having less.\nThe difference is all about intention. Having less might not be a choice, while living with less is a conscious decision to simplify and declutter.\nThis minimalist lifestyle, as it turns out, tends to promote happiness. And as someone who has tried and tested this lifestyle, I can tell you that there are certain habits that make the journey to happiness a lot easier.\nLet’s dive into the 8 habits that minimalists often share, habits that lead to a more contented, happier life.\n1) Embracing simplicity Life can be complicated, often more than we’d like.\nBut as a minimalist, I’ve found that embracing simplicity helps smooth out some of those complications.\nThink about it. The less clutter there is in your home, the less time you spend on cleaning and organizing. The fewer commitments you have, the less you feel overwhelmed.\nSimplicity isn’t about having less for the sake of it. It’s about making room for what truly matters.\nWhen we simplify our lives, we’re making a conscious decision to focus on the things that bring us joy and happiness, and discarding those that don’t.\nIt’s a liberating habit that promotes happiness and one that many minimalists share. But remember – it’s a journey, not a destination. So, take your time and enjoy the process.\n2) Intentional purchasing As a minimalist, one habit I’ve adopted is being more intentional with my purchases.\nI used to be an impulsive buyer – if I saw something I liked, I bought it, often without thinking about whether I really needed it or not. But, over time, this led to clutter and stress.\nWhen I started my minimalist journey, I made a decision to only buy what I truly needed or what would add significant value to my life.\nFor example, instead of buying a new book every time one caught my eye, I started using my local library. Not only did this save me money, but it also saved space in my home and reduced waste.\nBeing intentional with purchases is about mindful consumption. It’s about considering the impact of your buying habits on your life and the world around you. It’s a habit that takes time to cultivate, but once you do, it can lead to greater happiness and contentment.\n3) Digital decluttering We often associate minimalism with physical possessions, but it extends to our digital lives as well.\nOur screens are cluttered with apps, notifications, and endless feeds, causing stress and distraction.\nA study from the University of California, Irvine found that it takes an average of 23 minutes and 15 seconds to get back to a task after an interruption. Now think about how many times a day your work is interrupted by a notification on your phone or computer.\nDigital decluttering is about reducing these digital distractions to focus on what truly matters. It’s about creating a digital environment that supports your goals and contributes to your happiness.\nThis might mean unsubscribing from unnecessary emails, deleting unused apps, or setting boundaries for social media use. Whatever it looks like for you, digital decluttering can make a big difference in your overall wellbeing.\n4) Conscious relationships Minimalism isn’t just about things, it’s also about people. We’re often unaware of how much energy we spend on relationships that don’t add value to our lives.\nAs a minimalist, I’ve found happiness in focusing on relationships that are meaningful and positive. This might mean spending less time with people who drain my energy and more time with those who inspire, support, and uplift me.\nConscious relationships are not about cutting people out of your life ruthlessly. It’s about making sure the relationships you do invest in are beneficial to your wellbeing and happiness.\nRemember, it’s quality over quantity when it comes to relationships. And sometimes, less really is more.\n5) Valuing experiences over possessions One of the most profound shifts I’ve experienced on my minimalist journey is realizing the value of experiences over possessions.\nThere’s a certain euphoria that comes with buying new things. But it fades quickly. Before we know it, we’re onto the next thing, trying to recapture that fleeting feeling.\nBut the joy derived from experiences – a heartwarming conversation, a breathtaking sunset, a shared meal with loved ones – that joy is enduring. It doesn’t fade with time. Instead, it deepens, becoming a part of our story, our identity.\nThe habit of valuing experiences over possessions is a powerful promoter of happiness. It nurtures our connections with others and with the world around us, fostering a sense of belonging and contentment that material possessions simply can’t offer.\nSo next time you’re tempted to buy something new, ask yourself: Could this money be better spent on an experience? You might be surprised by the answer.\n6) Practicing gratitude In the rush of daily life, it’s easy to overlook the many blessings we have. I’ve been guilty of this myself. My minimalist journey, however, has taught me the importance of practicing gratitude.\nThere was a time when I was always striving for more – more possessions, more success, more validation. But no matter how much I acquired, it never seemed enough. It felt like happiness was always just out of reach.\nWhen I started practicing gratitude, my perspective shifted. Instead of focusing on what I didn’t have, I began appreciating what I did have. From the simple pleasure of a warm cup of coffee in the morning to the love and support of my family, my life was full of things to be grateful for.\nThis shift towards gratitude has brought a profound sense of contentment and happiness into my life. It’s a habit that’s not always easy to maintain, especially during challenging times, but it’s one that’s worth cultivating.\n7) Mindful living Minimalism isn’t just about decluttering your space, it’s also about decluttering your mind.\nFor me, this has meant adopting a more mindful approach to life. This involves being fully present in the moment, instead of being lost in thoughts about the past or worries about the future.\nWhether it’s savouring a meal, listening attentively to a friend, or simply enjoying the sensation of a cool breeze on my face, mindfulness allows me to appreciate life more fully.\nBy focusing on the present, I’ve found that I worry less, enjoy more, and feel a greater sense of peace and happiness. It’s a habit that takes practice, but the benefits are well worth the effort.\n8) Prioritizing self-care Above all, minimalism has taught me the importance of prioritizing self-care.\nIn a world that often demands we put others before ourselves, it’s easy to neglect our own needs. But self-care isn’t selfish – it’s essential.\nFrom taking time each day to do something I love, to ensuring I get enough sleep, I’ve found that caring for myself boosts my mood and energy levels.\nRemember, we can’t pour from an empty cup. Taking care of ourselves allows us to show up as our best selves in every area of our lives. It’s the foundation of a happy, fulfilling life.\nFinal reflection: It’s about the journey The beauty of minimalism lies in its flexibility. It’s not a rigid set of rules, but a lifestyle choice that adapts to individual needs and circumstances.\nEach of us can shape our minimalist journey in a way that brings us the most happiness. Whether that means decluttering your home, spending more time in nature, or simply being more mindful in your daily activities, the choice is yours.\nRemember, minimalism isn’t about deprivation. It’s about making space for what truly matters – experiences, relationships, and personal growth.\nAs Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus, famously known as The Minimalists, put it, “Minimalism is a tool to rid yourself of life’s excess in favor of focusing on what’s important—so you can find happiness, fulfillment, and freedom.”\nAdopting these habits won’t necessarily turn you into a minimalist overnight. But they can certainly nudge you towards a simpler, more mindful lifestyle that promotes happiness.\nAt the end of the day, it’s about the journey, not the destination. So take the first step, embrace the process, and see where the path of minimalism leads you.",
