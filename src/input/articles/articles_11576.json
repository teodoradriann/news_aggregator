    "title": "“Una hazaña nacional”: La historia del religioso peruano olvidado que consiguió entregar una carta al rey de España | Teatro | Obra | Alfonso Santistevan | LUCES | EL COMERCIO PERÚ",
    "text": "[Saber más](https://elcomercio.pe/buenas-practicas/) / NoticiasInformación basada en hechos y verificada de primera mano por el reportero, o reportada y verificada por fuentes expertas. | Informativo Se sabe muy poco sobre [Fray Calixto de San José Túpac Inca](https://elcomercio.pe/luces/teatro/), ni siquiera contamos con un retrato que muestre la fusión de su ascendencia, con un padre español y una madre descendiente del décimo Inca, Túpac Yupanqui. Los detalles de su gran travesía hacia España son desconocidos, al igual que las verdaderas intenciones que lo impulsaron a llevar personalmente una carta al rey Fernando VI. La única certeza sobre su viaje fue el propio mensaje, plasmado en la “Exclamación Reivindicacionista”, carta que motivaría su viaje y también dejaría constancia de su existencia. Para entender la obra es necesario conocer el contexto, un elemento que la puesta en escena brinda. El rey Fernando VI gobierna el Imperio español bajo el título de “El prudente”, o también llamado “El justo”. Durante este periodo, las rebeliones indígenas de Juan Santos Atahualpa (Gran Pajonal) y Francisco Inca (Huarochirí) dejaron al virrey José Antonio Manso de Velasco, “Conde de Superunda”, receloso de cualquier acto mínimamente sospechoso de conspiración. Es en este contexto que Fray Calixto inicia su aventura. “En el siglo XVIII, el mundo ‘peruano’ se dividía en una nación de indios y otra de españoles, con leyes distintas y regímenes diferentes. Había distancias muy marcadas, pero el problema en esos tiempos era que las autoridades no cumplían las leyes. Existía el ‘yo acato, pero no cumplo’; bajo esa frase se cometieron grandes injusticias”, menciona el director de la obra, Alfonso Santistevan, en entrevista con El Comercio. La obra narra la gran travesía del fraile franciscano, quien recorre diferentes ciudades y poblados, superando todas las dificultades —rellenando vacíos en la historia con escenas fantásticas— hasta llegar a España, donde, según narra el propio Calixto, consigue entregar la “Exclamación Reivindicacionista” en manos del rey. La historia no acaba ahí, sino que continúa hasta la muerte del propio Fray Calixto el 14 de septiembre de 1782 en el Convento de la Recolección de San Francisco del Monte del Desierto, España. Para completar las partes de las cuales no se tiene constancia histórica, se recurrió a la interpretación, mezclando cuentacuentos, comedia, farsa, drama y tragedia con la visión del director, quien incorporó el estilo de teatro callejero. La propia estructura del teatro Ricardo Blume apoya este concepto de teatro más dinámico, similar a los espacios en la Alameda Chabuca Granda. Aquí, los actores se cambian ante la mirada del público e interpretan diferentes personajes, sin buscar esconder nada. “Usamos más recursos del teatro para darle más vida a la obra, más color a un hecho histórico que figura en textos antiguos. Ese toque de teatro callejero también le brinda un matiz diferente; es preferible ese dinamismo en lugar de una puesta en escena completamente realista”, comenta Santistevan. La puesta en escena transmite el mensaje de “algún día”, representando el valor a futuro sobre la travesía de Fray Calixto para evidenciar los males que aquejaban a los mestizos e indígenas peruanos, sometidos por una sociedad que años más tarde rebelaría con Gabriel Condorcanqui, más conocido como Túpac Amaru II. “La hazaña, además de emprender este gran recorrido, es haber pensado que existe la posibilidad de una justicia. El documento se basa en que las autoridades españolas en el Virreinato no cumplen con las leyes que el propio rey impuso para sus dominios en América, por ende, un hombre cansado de tantos atropellos se decide a buscar esa justicia personalmente,” concluye.

    "text": "Jannik Sinner’s fate will be decided by CAS, which will issue the Clostebol doping issue ruling in a closed-door hearing, in mid-April.\nThe Italian is currently focusing on the 2025 Australian Open, where he has just reached the 3rd round, but it is inevitable for him and his team not to think about the CAS ruling, especially given WADA’s tough request for a 1-2 year suspension for the young Italian, in an interview with Daily Maverick.\nSome weeks ago, USADA Chief Executive Travis Tygart (who prosecuted cyclist Lance Armstrong) expressed on the case involving the ATP No.1, stressing that he does not believe Jannik is a doper.\n\"If Jannik is a doper, which I don't believe he is based on the facts that have been made public, then a not guilty verdict was a perfectly appropriate outcome based on the rules and the facts,\" he explained.\nAnd just a few hours ago, following Jannik's access to the 3rd round of the Australian Open 2025, his coach Darren Cahill, who will leave the Italian's team at the end of the season, reposted the USADA chief's interview on X to underline his belief that his player is totally innocent of the facts and that their split does not depend on the Clostebol doping issue.\nHead of US Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart.\n— Darren Cahill (@darren_cahill)\nA good read.[https://t.co/CMONPM8bVI][January 16, 2025]\nTygart, also with Daily Maverick, already before Iga Swiatek's issue, talked about a wide range of doping issues, including the Italian's case, dismissing the idea that Jannik had somehow received preferential treatment from the ITIA-appointed tribunal.\n\"Unlike TMZ 23 in China, the rules, and if you're specifically talking about the Jannik's case, the rules were followed. The transparency was upheld. Why wasn't Sinner provisionally suspended? Well, he was. But he appealed and they revoked it. That's within the regulations.\nCompare that to the Chinese cases. They've never even provisionally suspended athletes and the regulations are absolutely clear on that kind of positivity. You have to be suspended. You can challenge it and an independent hearing officer can revoke the order, which is what happened in the Sinner case. So the outcome of the case was no finding of fault,\" he said.\nWe recall Jannik was found positive for Clostebol at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, failing two doping tests. The Italian was later found innocent by an independent tribunal commissioned by ITIA. WADA subsequently announced an appeal to CAS against this ruling, asking for a 1-2 year suspension for the ATP No.1.\nJannik Sinner",

    "text": "[](https://bit.ly/2LwNMjt) Go Fund Me page established for Michael Smith, fondly known around Carson area as 'Bread Man' We have established a Go Fund Me page to help. [Go here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/known-fondly-as-the-bread-man) for the page. For those of you who live in Reno and Carson City; South Lake Tahoe and Sacramento, Calif., and cities in between, you have most likely seen my brother, Michael Smith. He is the one carrying an oxygen tank in one arm and his camera equipment in the other arm. He is the guy filming on the sidelines of a ball game, a parade, a museum, a live music concert; a restaurant opening; and more. He is always on-hand to film and promote the local happenings to the viewers on the local public broadcasting television stations and his local You tube channel called Nevada Trails TV. See [video by clicking here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwisNzqQlFI&t=4s) You can also view the video below. Michael Smith loves to get involved with the community. He has dressed up as “Casey the Crocodile” and “Lucky Duck” in Gardnerville, Nevada. The Kids and Horses Riding Center for the disabled is a program near and dear to his heart having had to face his own injuries and life of disability. The local firemen of the Gardnerville, Nevada, area fire department nicknamed Michael “The Bread Man,” because of his tireless efforts in gathering food for the poor. Here is a link of Michael on You tube sharing a bit about himself click here; Michael participating in tabs for kids. We are reaching out today to ask for your help and support. As some of you may know, my brother has been struggling with health issues ever since his closed-head injury when he was a young man. The brain injury caused water to gather on his brain. The water pressure on his brain caused him to begin to lose the use of his legs. The brain surgery took place on June 23, 2021, at Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto, California. They put a stint in Michael's brain to drain the water off. The surgery was a success. After the surgery, Michael was doing well, all except for his lungs. The doctors, at the time, had thought that the water pressure on Michael's brain might have also contributed to his poor lung functioning. It did not turn out to be the case. Michael's lung capacity has steadily decreased since the brain surgery. The doctors determined that he needed a lung transplant and immediately placed him on the lung transplant list. While waiting for his name to come to the top of the lung transplant list, Michael has experienced other set-backs which called for surgery/hospitalization and rehab which has included; a blocked intestine, hernia, pneumonia and most recent a brain bleed sending him to the hospital over Christmas 2023. Michael's need is great. Michael's medical bills and needed care has exceeded what his family can provide. Right now, he is struggling just to keep going until the scheduled surgery date. Michael has been on disability since the brain injury years ago. He gets limited income when he is able to video record for local community gatherings and meetings. When his health fails, like it did over Christmas keeping him in the hospital and then rehab for almost 6-weeks, it eliminates any chance for Michael to make any supplemental income. With his upcoming lung transplant surgery, tentatively set for May 2024, there is a great need for Michael to attend various doctor appointments to complete the required preliminary tests in San Francisco and Stanford facilities to prepare for the surgery. He needs help with the costs of transportation and gas getting him to and from the appointments as well as his hotel/motel and meal accommodations while there for Michael and a family member who escorts him there. This need will continue while he is in recovery at Stanford after the transplant with the need for transportation to and from hotel and the hospital as well as costs for transportation and gas (flights/car) accommodations for his family who will rotate as caregivers on-site while he is in recovery for 6-weeks at the Stanford Hospital. Donations for Michael would help cover not only the initial medical bills but also the additional cost of getting Michael's family members to California (via flight/car), hotel/food cost for caregivers, transportation costs for caregivers while there and living expenses for Michael and his caregivers following the surgery which initially is 6-8 weeks in the hospital/rehab facility; then another 2-3 months for his home care. His need is great. Our needs as caregivers to help Michael are great. Your donations no matter how big or small will make a big difference in my brother's life. Michael is one of the good guys. He does so much good for the community. Michael has a huge heart for the underdog. He goes out of his way to help others. Michael is a big advocate for those in need. He gathers food from local merchants and distributes it to the local food banks. In the summer months, Michael packs up lunch bags to distribute to homeless in need that he encounters throughout his day. Michael loves music and has offered to many new singing artists the opportunity of helping them with their first demo. His payment was two-fold being first to pay it forward to someone else when you are a success; and second to refer a friend after the session. Michael would contact the friend and continue with his own version of paying it forward. Michael shared a video of his initial brain injury that was filmed when he was a young man, but was uploaded to his YouTube site years later. See video below. Health talk featuring Michael Smith. He shares at that time the beginning stages of his life following his brain injury. Even with his new found situation in having a disability, Michael was trying to help others in the same situation. Despite Michael's hardships in struggling during his wait for his lung transplant surgery, Michael remains optimistic and positive. He has a great sense-of-humor which I believe has been pivotal in getting him through the lows, but most of all he has great faith. I am pleading to all of you angels out there, please help my brother. He needs some bread to make it until his lung transplant which is just around the corner. He has done so well. He has been so brave. Please have a heart for the underdog and give what you can today. I ask also that you “pay it forward” and share this message with your friends and family about Michael. Thank you for taking the time to read about Michael's story. Thank you for your donations.

    "title": "WordPress : Automattic réduit ses contributions en réponse aux attaques de WP Engine",
    "text": "Après des années où la société a injecté d’importantes ressources humaines et financières dans le projet open source, un remaniement stratégique s’impose. En cause : une série de conflits légaux lancés par WP Engine et financés par Silver Lake, un fonds d’investissement privé majeur. Ce contexte oblige Automattic à repenser ses priorités pour garantir un avenir pérenne à WordPress.\nNouveaux défis et réalignement des contributions\nWordPress doit beaucoup à Automattic pour son essor et sa stabilité. Cependant, des tensions au sein de l’écosystème menacent cette harmonie. Automattic a récemment annoncé une baisse significative de ses contributions directes au code source de WordPress. Ce retrait temporaire fait suite à des attaques juridiques initiées par [WP Engine](https://siecledigital.fr/2024/09/30/wordpress-vs-wp-engine-laffrontement-juridique-et-technologique-qui-secoue-lindustrie-de-lhebergement-web/), accusé d’abuser de la marque WordPress et de manquer d’une collaboration loyale.\nInscrivez-vous à la newsletter\nEn vous inscrivant vous acceptez notre [politique de protection des données personnelles](/politique-de-protection-des-donnees-personnelles/).\nD’après les récentes déclarations de Matt Mullenweg, fondateur d’Automattic et vétéran de WordPress, il est temps de restructurer les efforts bénéfiques à l’ensemble de la communauté. La redistribution des activités de contribution est vue comme nécessaire, malgré le désagrément causé par ces batailles juridiques. Automattic s’engage désormais à aligner ses heures de bénévolat sur celles de ses concurrents, soit environ 45 heures par semaine. Un rapprochement avec l’approche « Five For the Future », qui vise à renforcer l’implication des entreprises dans l’entretien du projet open source, semble ici pertinent.\nRéorientation vers des projets rentables\nAlors que le litige se poursuit, Automattic redirige ses équipes vers des initiatives commercialement viables telles que WordPress.com, Pressable, WPVIP, Jetpack, et WooCommerce. Le but est de stabiliser et sécuriser financièrement l’entreprise tout en maintenant un pied dans l’univers WordPress. Cette décision, bien qu’incontournable, est perçue avec prudence par les membres de la communauté open source qui craignent une perte d’élan dans les améliorations techniques futures du projet.\nLa pile technologique de premier plan qu’est WordPress repose majoritairement sur des contributions gratuites et concertées de multiples acteurs. Réduire les contributions d’un acteur aussi important pourrait perturber l’équilibre préexistant. Cependant, Automattic assure que ce n’est qu’une mesure temporaire dictée par les circonstances actuelles. Une fois les différends réglés et les craintes légales dissipées, la société ambitionne de revenir en force pour soutenir les nombreux sous-projets de WordPress tels que Gutenberg, Playground, Openverse, et WordPress.org.\nL’espoir d’un retour à la normale\nLes communications officielles de la part d’Automattic laissent entrevoir un futur lumineux post-litige. La société demeure optimiste quant à la possibilité de résoudre ces querelles de manière équitable et équilibrée pour tous les participants du marché. Matt Mullenweg exprime régulièrement son espoir de voir WP Engine reconsidérer ses actions pour permettre un retour à des contributions actives, non seulement pour le cœur de WordPress, mais aussi pour les autres projets connexes essentiels à l’épanouissement de la plate-forme.\nMullenweg et ses collaborateurs insistent sur l’importance d’une coopération renouvelée et harmonieuse pour préserver la résilience et la pertinence du logiciel. Célébrant constamment les principes de transparence et de collaboration, Automattic se présente comme un garant de la durabilité de WordPress, prêt à intensifier ses efforts dès que les circonstances le permettront.\nL’intégrité de la fondation WordPress en question\nDes voix éminentes dans la communauté WordPress soulèvent néanmoins des questions sur l’indépendance de la fondation WordPress elle-même. Plusieurs experts appellent à une autonomie totale de la structure pour qu’elle ne soit pas assujettie aux intérêts d’entreprises spécifiques, même si elles ont un rôle fondateur. Une indépendance plus marquée pourrait prévenir les situations où les directives stratégiques sont influencées par des intérêts commerciaux divergents.\nEn dépit des controverses et des différents jugements de la cour américaine défavorables à Automattic, le discours reste confiant et orienté vers la résolution constructive. Les prochaines étapes envisagées par Automattic incluent une reprise rapide et efficiente des travaux suspendus, avec une orientation accrue sur l’innovation et la qualité des solutions proposées aux utilisateurs finaux.",
