    "text": "In memoriam: Reasons to love Richard Lewis, and why he loved Chicago Richard Lewis performs at Zanies Comedy Club in Chicago on Jan. 17, 2018. (Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune) By Rick Kogan | | Chicago Tribune PUBLISHED: 4:07 p.m. | UPDATED: 4:08 p.m.\nYou have, no doubt, been made aware of the death of Richard Lewis.\nThe 76-year-old Brooklyn-born comic/actor/writer died Feb. 27 of a heart attack in his Los Angeles home. Almost immediately, remembrances from friends and fans created an internet avalanche and formal obituaries charted the course and provided the details of his distinctively prolific career.\nMany knew Lewis primarily from his work on the HBO series “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” which made him a hit with a new generation and is the creation of his lifelong friend Larry David. Lifelong? Well, they were born at the same hospital, days apart, and a few years later became buddies when attending the same summer camp.\nI am a fan of “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” as I was the sadly short-lived “Anything But Love,” an ABC sitcom of the late 1980s in the early 1990s in which Lewis co-starred with Jamie Lee Curtis — and Chicago stage actress Holly Fulger — as a pair of writers for a fictional Chicago magazine.\nBut I was also thrown back in memory to a March night in 1984 at Zanies, the Old Town comedy club, where he made his first Chicago appearance. Also in the audience was my former Tribune colleague and friend Howard Reich, who told me on Thursday, “I last communicated with Richard just a couple of days ago, so his death is as much a shock to me as to the millions who similarly revered him.”\nAnd there were millions too, fans of his stand-up career, a couple of books, innumerable appearances on late night talk shows, HBO specials, and his work in such movies as “Leaving Las Vegas.”\nAs Reich remembers, “The first time I reviewed him was that March 1984 night at Zanies. I was overwhelmed by his verbal brilliance and by his sheer profusion of comic scenarios. I’d never witnessed such an avalanche of humor so virtuosically delivered.” Comedian Richard on Dec. 13, 1985. (Sally Good/Chicago Tribune)\nReich has not forgotten that night and many others. There are few writers who kept in closer touch with Lewis than did Reich. Over the decades , in reviews and lengthy interviews, he was able to insightfully capture the comic.\nAs he once wrote, Lewis was “the most dexterous emerging wordsmith in American comedy. More confessional than Woody Allen, more world-weary than Rodney Dangerfield, more maniacal than Lenny Bruce, Lewis dared to tell his audience secrets that most folks wouldn’t share with their shrinks.”\nIn my own interviews with Lewis, he long ago told me, “Chicago has been historically the nicest, most receptive city in the country for me. Basically, it’s the nightmares of Steve (Dahl) and Garry (Meier). … Really, I love those guys, love their show. I love every facet of the town.”\nThough he would perform at such spacious local venues as the Vic and Park West — and he played a sold-out Carnegie Hall in New York in 1989 — he remained loyal to our city and especially to intimate, 100-seat Zanies.\nWhen the club’s owner, Rick Uchwat, died in 2011 , Lewis told me, “I’m heartbroken. My near 30-year run with Rick turned Chicago into my comedy town, and the shows there and the response is something that in many ways helped me achieve what I have. I can’t imagine being a comedian without Rick. I loved him like a brother.”\nThere remains on the wall of the Wells Street Zanies an 8×10 photo of the young Lewis, one of the hundreds who have played the club’s tiny stage. There is also a wonderfully evocative painting of him with the words “Jokes from HELL!”\n“The last time I reviewed Richard — at what turned out to be his final stand-up engagement, again at Zanies, in January 2018 — he proved every bit as quick and incisive as ever, if not more so,” says Reich. “But now he was a man who had been dealt many harsh blows in life yet still found humor and joy in being alive.” Bert Haas, retiring as manager of Zanies Comedy Club in early 2021, told the Tribune that all of the comedians pictured on the wall of the Wells Street club had performed there, including Richard Lewis (pictured at center). (Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune)\nThose blows came in the form of difficult childhood familial bonds; hard tussles with drugs and alcohol, which he won by the mid-1990s; romantic troubles that ended with his happy marriage to Joyce Lapinsky in 2005. He was often beset by anxiety and depression and was ever dealing with various health problems, which included back surgery and a recent diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. But he did take joy in being alive.\nOne of those who knew Lewis best is Bert Haas, who recently retired after more than four decades as a manager and executive with Zanies. He told me, “Richard drove me crazy for almost three decades and I loved every minute of it. He was one of the kindest men I met. The first time I met him was after I returned from my grandmother’s funeral and without a word he just gave me a big hug. “Once, playing the Zanies in Nashville, he had complained about his room and the hotel upgraded him to the best suite where Al Gore had stayed as vice president. Richard was so excited, he was like a kid. He insisted on taking Rick (Uchwat) and me on a tour of the suite and he almost missed his flight home.\n“He continued the stream-of-consciousness comedy pioneered by Lenny Bruce. Richard would take notes on stage with him because he was so prolific that it was impossible for him to remember all the material. One of the greatest comedy performances I ever witnessed was at Zanies in Vernon Hills when Richard did an hour-plus set and in the final five minutes pulled together three distinct themes he had been riffing on to reach a magnificent climax. It was absolutely awesome and transcended stand-up comedy.”\nSo, Richard Lewis is dead and memories flow and Reich says, “I believe Richard lifted the lives of anyone who saw him perform. … I hope he realized that.”\nrkogan@chicagotribune.com",

    "title": "The Words Husband and Wife Deemed Offensive by Methodist Church of UK",
    "text": "The Methodist Church of Great Britain recently revised its “Inclusive Language Guide,” encouraging ministers, deacons, and elders to use terms like “partner,” “child,” and “parent” instead of “husband” and “wife.” This move aims to reflect the diversity of relationships and avoid assumptions not applicable to many people. The church’s initiative is part of an ongoing effort to prevent the use of language that could be harmful to marginalized groups. The guide, updated every six months, now includes recommendations on gender identity, advocating the use of chosen pronouns to respect individual identities. Additionally, traditional terms like “brothers and sisters” are advised against, considering non-binary individuals. The guidance extends to congregants, encouraging the use of personal pronouns in daily conversations. For further guidance on language and pronouns, particularly concerning the LGBT community, the church suggests consulting organizations such as GLAAD and Stonewall. This latest update follows the church’s 2021 decision to support same-sex marriages, marking a significant shift in its approach to contemporary social issues.",

Falta a sesión de la Corte e impide trabajos\nLa autonombrada ‘ministra del pueblo’ no se presentó a la reunión de la Segunda Sala del Máximo Tribunal.\nPublicada: abr 09 a las 13:35, 2025\nEsta mañana la Segunda Sala de la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación (SCJN) fue suspendida, una vez más, por culpa de la ministra Lenia Batres Guadarrama.\nNo solo te informamos, te explicamos la política. Da clic aquí y recibe gratis nuestro boletín diario.\nLa sesión de la Segunda Sala, la cual está integrada por los ministros Javier Laynez Potisek, Yasmín Esquivel Mossa, Alberto Pérez Dayán y Lenia Batres, estaba programada para las 11 am de este miércoles; sin embargo, en la transmisión se puede apreciar que el lugar de Batres Guadarrama estaba vacío.\n“Le informo que existen únicamente dos ministros y una ministra integrantes de esta Segunda Sala, por lo que no existe quórum suficiente para llevar a cabo la sesión”, informó la secretaria.\nPor ello Laynez Potisek, quien se desempeña como presidente de la Sala, ordenó levantar la sesión reprogramándola para el miércoles 23 de abril acumulando los asuntos programados para ese día.\nLas ausencias de Lenia Batres\nEsta no es la primera vez que la ministra cercana a la 4T interrumpe los trabajos del Máximo Tribunal, ya que el pasado 12 de marzo, Batres hizo que se suspendiera otra sesión de la Segunda Sala tras determinarse que estaba impedida para participar en la resolución del amparo de Ricardo Salinas Pliego.\nDicha determinación fue tomada debido a la manifestación de posturas en contra del empresario días antes. Esto causó el enojo de la ministra, quien terminó abandonando la sesión.\nOtra fue la ocurrida el 27 de marzo, pero en esa ocasión se dio durante una sesión de la Sala Superior.\nAntes de salir, se le vio contestando una llamada telefónica con la que ignoró a la ministra presidenta Norma Piña y poco después salió del Pleno mientras se votaba una controversia constitucional promovida por la alcaldía Coyoacán.\nAl salir y por falta de quórum, Norma Piña ordenó la suspensión, aunque aclaró que la ministra avisó de forma anticipada que se iría.\n¿Enfocada en las campañas?\nEstas ausencias fueron atribuidas a una cosa: su interés por hacer campaña para ser electa ministra de la SCJN en la elección judicial, según acusó su compañera Loretta Ortiz Ahlf.\nOrtiz Ahlf aseguró que por la renovación de cargos que habrá con la elección, se debe priorizar una transición fluida para no dejar una inmensa carga de trabajo, por lo que resaltó que enfrentan una excesiva carga.\nPor ello se fijó un cronograma de trabajo en la Corte, pero dijo que la ministra Lenia Batres “ya se quería ir de campaña”.\nPor ello rechazó los señalamientos sobre llevar una vida de lujos: “Eso de que estemos viviendo una situación de privilegio y que nos llevemos... En cambio los otros, ya algunos ya están en campaña”, concluyó Ortiz Ahlf.",
