    "title": "Maine Resorts Forecasting Up to 12 Inches in Saturday Storm",
    "text": "By Mary Walsh ,\n10 hours ago\nA winter storm is moving into New England this weekend and Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine are all forecasting snow.\nSunday River just shared an image from local Maine CBS affiliate WGME that shows a fantastic forecast for Maine snowboarders\n\"If you haven't made plans for Saturday yet, you probably should.\" posted Sunday River on Instagram.\nThe inland Maine resort received a few inches earlier in the week when a smaller storm rolled through Wednesday and Thursday. Temperatures dropped, allowing Sunday River to turn on its snowmaking, a beautiful thing considering the roller coaster weather the Northeast has had this winter.\nWGME reported that the storm will begin between 2am and 5am Saturday morning and continue through 10pm-1am Sunday morning. The state's coastal region is only expecting 1-3 inches, potentially mixing into rain, but over a foot in the mountains has New Englanders waxing their snowboards and setting their stances back.\nFollow along at @sundayriver on Instagram.\nWe are always on the lookout for amusing, interesting, and engaging snow related videos to feature on our channels.

    "text": "Vladimir Putin Invites PM Modi To Visit Russia, Seeks ‘Peaceful’ Solution On Ukraine Issue\nPresident Vladimir Putin extended an invitation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit Russia next year. He indicated that discussions on relevant and current issues, as well as the prospects of Russian-Indian relations, would take place during the visit. Putin’s remarks came during a meeting with External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar at the Kremlin on Wednesday.\n“We will be glad to see our friend, Prime Minister Modi in Russia,” Vladimir Putin said during a meeting with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar at the Kremlin on Wednesday. During PM Modi’s visit, “We will be able to discuss all the relevant, current issues and talk to the prospects of the Russian and Indian relationship,” Putin added.\nDuring a joint media appearance, Jaishankar expressed confidence that Prime Minister Modi and President Putin would meet for their annual summit next year, highlighting the frequent contact between the two leaders. The EAM is on a Russia visit from December 25 to 29 as a part of the ongoing high-level exchanges between the two sides.\nImage\nMeanwhile, President Putin also sought a discussion with PM Modi on the ongoing Ukraine War adding, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is “willing to do his utmost” to address the Russia-Ukraine issue through “peaceful means”.\nPutin emphasised the positive stance of Prime Minister Modi on complex global developments, including the situation in Ukraine. “We know the stance of Prime Minister Modi and we mentioned that repeatedly on many occasions. Well, his attitude towards some complex developments, including the flashpoints like…in Ukraine,” he noted.\nThe Russian President mentioned that he has advised Modi on the developments in Ukraine multiple times and indicated that further discussions on the matter would take place.\n“Many times, I advised him of how things have been going there and I know that he (PM Modi) is willing to do his utmost so that the issue is resolved by peaceful means. So, we probably will delve into that deeper now, and we will give additional information to you on that time,” Putin added.\nThe Russian President also expressed gratitude for the progressing relationship between Russia and India amid global turmoil. “We are gratified to note that despite all the turmoil happening worldwide, the relationship with our true friend in Asia, India has been progressing incrementally,” Putin said.\n“We will be glad to see our dear friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, paying a visit to Russia, we will be able to discuss all the relevant, current issues and talk to the prospects of the Russian and Indian relationship,” he also said.\nHe conveyed warm wishes to Modi and acknowledged the busy political schedule in India, with general elections scheduled for the next year.\n“We have a lot an open field of work ahead of us. So, please convey my best, very best wishes to his excellency. And please, tell him that we want to see him, Russia expect him to come although, I know that India next year will have a busy political schedule. The general elections in parliament are scheduled for next year. We wish our friends every success in that and we hope that anyway, no matter what the alignment of political forces would be the traditional conventional friendly ties will persist between our nations,” the Russian President also said.\nAmid the raging military conflict, PM Modi has spoken to Putin as well as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “India and I will do whatever we can to resolve the conflict,” PM Modi had said. New Delhi has sought a diplomatic solution to the conflict, with PM Modi telling Russian President Vladimir Putin in September that “now is not an era of war”. The remark drew praise from world leaders as well as the global media.",

    "text": "Andrés Julián Rendón.\nAndrés Julián Rendón, gobernador electo del departamento de Antioquia, aseguró que continuará con su idea de promover un referendo que permita a las regiones del país tener una autonomía fiscal para no depender siempre del Gobierno nacional.\nAunque Rendón ya había hablado de este tema hace un mes y socializó la idea en la Federación de Departamentos, la decisión del Gobierno Petro de asumir, después de 22 años, las funciones de autoridad minera en Antioquia, volvió a revivir el asunto.\nComo la decisión cayó como un baldado de agua fría porque esas tareas estaban a cargo de la Gobernación de Antioquia, Rendón publicó un video en sus redes sociales donde anuncia que junto con la bancada del Congreso de su departamento liderarán el referendo.\n“La decisión del Gobierno Petro nos devuelve a las épocas fastidiosas del centralismo y desconoce las capacidades como región. Nos ponen un freno de mano en el desarrollo local. Con mayor razón seguiré promoviendo ese referendo constitucional que les devuelva a las regiones la autonomía, sobre todo fiscal”, dijo.\nPor esa razón desde enero de 2024 se trabajará en dicha iniciativa para impulsarla y buscar un apoyo mayoritario. Diferentes gobernadores electos están de acuerdo en que hay que acabar el centralismo, por lo que seguramente apoyarán la propuesta de Rendón.\nSobre la decisión del Gobierno Petro, la Agencia Nacional de Minería no prorrogó las actividades de control que asumió desde 2001 el departamento, relacionadas con la tramitación y celebración de contratos de concesión, también con las labores de fiscalización, seguimiento y control de esta actividad económica. Desde 2024, esta entidad será la titular del caso.",
