    "title": "Pastor Warns of Dangerous Error Many Christians Are Making on Satan, Demons, and Spiritual Realm | CBN News",
    "text": "Jonathan Pokluda is on a mission to help people “identify spiritual warfare” and “defeat the enemy.”\nPokluda, pastor of Harris Creek Baptist Church in Waco, Texas, is tackling the topic of spiritual warfare head-on, recently releasing, “ Your Story Has a Villain: Identify Spiritual Warfare and Learn How to Defeat the Enemy ,” a new book aimed at helping people see through chaos to discern truth.\nIn describing the roots of his interest in discussing the spiritual realm, the preacher appealed to his own story being raised Catholic and interacting with multiple denominations.\nAll of that faith exposure, though, didn’t prepare him spiritually for what was to come.\n“[I] lived the kind of crazy college life,” Pokluda said. “They say, ‘Drugs, sex, and rock and roll.’ In my case, ‘Drugs, sex, and hip hop.’ And, then … I graduated. I was in the world. I was at a club. Someone invited me to church. I went, hung over, sat in the back row, and surrendered my life to Jesus.”\nFrom there, Pokluda “went all in with Jesus,” but as he embarked on the journey, he realized something: many people were missing a key piece to the spiritual puzzle:\nIn fact, some Christians weren’t fully aware — or even seeking — answers about the overarching spiritual battle raging between good and evil that Paul describes in Ephesians 6.\n“Being raised Catholic, I would see statues of angels and demons, and I was taught in religion class about the spiritual war that was happening around me,” he said. “And I knew the story in Genesis 3, the fall, you know the tempting of Satan in the Garden of Eden.”\nPokluda continued, “But, if this war was happening around us, I knew very little about it. And I didn’t know what could happen.”\nThe preacher said he was shocked to realize many people in the Christian community seemed “comfortable not knowing” these answers. This led Pokluda to do an in-depth exploration of what the Bible actually teaches.\n“It really was a three-year journey,” he said, noting he eventually went on to do a teaching series about the topic at his church, helping others discover what he learned from Scripture.\nListen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”\nUltimately, Pokluda said it’s essential for Christians to understand Ephesians 6 and the battle between good and evil, warning that “spiritual warfare has implications for everything we do.”\n“It’s a foundational truth to the Christian faith,” he added.\nIt’s a subject he’s hoping to help believers explore in “ Your Story Has a Villain: Identify Spiritual Warfare and Learn How to Defeat the Enemy .” As for why so many Christians avoid such issues, Pokluda said it’s clear there is a “Pentecostal thread” that is very comfortable with the unseen realm.\nThese people are open to discussing demonic possession, oppression, and other related issues.\n“But then there’s a large majority of churches outside of that that they just live in the mystery,” he said. “And they would say, ‘Hey, that’s gray. There’s a lot we don’t know there.'”\nThese folks might wonder if cases presented as possession are simply mental illnesses, and because of the rampant uncertainty around such matters, they refuse to speak with clarity on the issues.\nPokluda said famed Christian author C.S. Lewis reminded believers of the two errors often made regarding “devils.”\n“One is to make too much of them, believing that they are involved in everything,” Pokluda said. “And the second, and which is equally as dangerous, is to not even acknowledge their existence.”\nBut Pokluda said there’s also a third error he sees today — one that has been very popular in the modern era.\n“The more popular error of this century would be believing that there is a demonic realm and that belief having zero implications of anything that we do,” he said. “And if there is a demonic spiritual realm — if there is indeed a battle around us, which I have a deep conviction that there is — then it has implications for everything we do.”\nSatan’s attempts to make himself seem like an “allegory or parody,” Pokluda said, are unsurprising. The goal is to convince people he’s simply not real or active.\nThe preacher is hoping “ Your Story Has a Villain ” helps people confront these realities so they can survive and thrive.\n“The demonic realm [is] seeking to keep you from the abundant life that Christ has to offer,” Pokluda said. “For the non-believer, he tries to keep us from salvation in Christ. And to the believer, he tries to keep us stuck in dead religion away from a thriving relationship with God through his Son.”\nHe continued, “And, so, he operates both. He’s read the back of the book in Revelation. He knows that his destiny is hell.”\nPokluda said people simply need to give God their hearts.\nShare This article",

    "text": "WASHINGTON COUNTY, Tenn. (WCYB) — A Jonesborough man nearly struck a woman with a vehicle before he crashed into a house on Wednesday, according to the Washington County, Tennessee Sheriff's Office. Richard Shane King-Jessee, 27, has been charged with driving under the influence, reckless endangerment and driving on a restricted license related to a prior DUI. According to Sheriff Keith Sexton, deputies responded to a crash in the 4000 block of Old Jonesborough Road shortly after 10 p.m. While on the way, dispatch informed deputies that the driver of the vehicle, later identified as King- Jessee, called 911 stating no accident had occurred. When deputies arrived, they saw that the vehicle was lodged between the front porch and the garage of the house. Authorities said King-Jessee told them that something had run across the road, and he had swerved to avoid it. There were no skid marks observed where the King-Jessee had left the roadway, authorities added. A woman walking her dog in the front yard of the house narrowly missed being struck by the vehicle as it veered off the road and into the house and was taken to an area hospital for treatment. King-Jessee was supposed to have a vehicle interlock ignition in place in his vehicle due to having a prior DUI from April 2023. However, no such device was in place in the vehicle he crashed into the house, authorities added. Deputies took King-Jessee to the Washington County Detention Center where he made the $10,000 bond and was released two hours after being booked. He is due to appear in court on Thursday.",

    "title": "Judge dismisses professor ‘intellectual diversity’ lawsuit, calls claims ‘premature’ | News | newsandtribune.com",
    "text": "A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed a professor-led lawsuit alleging the state’s new university “intellectual diversity” requirements are unconstitutionally vague, and declined to issue a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the new law. Judge Sarah Evans Barker, of the U.S. District Court in Indiana’s Southern District, ruled that the professors’ allegations are “premature” because their universities haven’t finalized policies implementing the new law. “The source of Plaintiffs’ alleged injury (or) injuries lies in university policies that do not yet exist, rendering their allegations unfit for judicial review,” Barker wrote in the 17-page order. Legislators approved the law, Senate Enrolled Act 202, in March. It deals with public institutions for higher education and their boards of trustees: altering diversity-oriented positions and policies for tenure, contract renewals, performance reviews and more. The law also establishes new reporting and survey requirements based on “free inquiry, free expression, and intellectual diversity.” The bill’s supporters said conservative faculty members and students are increasingly ostracized at progressively liberal college and university settings — or at least perceive such shunning. Faculty and students, who overwhelmingly opposed the law, said it would micromanage their institutions and have a “chilling effect” on free expression. CASE FILED The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana filed a lawsuit in May, initially on behalf of two Purdue University Fort Wayne professors. Professors Steven Alan Carr and David Schuster worried the law could require faculty to give “debunked” theories equal time in their classrooms alongside “rigorously studied academic analysis.” Carr, for example, teaches about the Holocaust and doesn’t want to indulge Holocaust denialism or revisionism, per the lawsuit. Two Indiana University professors — David McDonald of the Bloomington campus and James Scheurich of the Indianapolis campus — have since joined. The plaintiffs alleged that the law is so vague — “intellectual diversity” is defined but “free inquiry” and “free expression” are not — that they’re unsure how to “avoid running afoul” of its requirements. They said they’ve already engaged in self-censorship via changes to their courses, like scrapping previously included materials and adding materials they otherwise wouldn’t have used. They sought a preliminary injunction. But the defendant universities and the state — as an intervenor — moved to dismiss the complaint. They argued the professors lacked standing because the potential harm faced would come from university policies; neither institution has finished such rules. “Plaintiffs attempt to manufacture an injury by pointing to self-inflicted wounds,” they argued. The judge agreed. COURT WEIGHS IN Barker wrote that federal courts can only solve “concrete disputes” involving real harms faced independently of “contingent future events.” In First Amendment cases, plaintiffs can allege harm before facing enforcement and through self-censorship, but their fear of enforcement can’t be speculative. The judge observed that the law deals explicitly with institutions and their boards of trustees, not individual educators. Because the policies aren’t yet finalized, she wrote, “it is impossible to determine whether Plaintiffs do in fact have an ‘objectively good reason’” for self-censoring. When the universities implement and enforce their policies, “those steps will inform whether such policies conflict with Plaintiffs’ conceptions of intellectual diversity; compel changes in their curricula; or otherwise infringe on their asserted constitutional right to academic freedom.” She also noted the plaintiffs also didn’t take on the universities’ interim policies. Because the judge dismissed the case for jurisdictional reasons and without considering the merits of the case, the move was made “without prejudice.” That means the plaintiffs can re-file or alter their claims and their request for declaratory judgment.",

    "title": "Arsenal Women \"are [now] players who are confident and playing well\" under Renee, says Steve Kirby",
    "text": "The Arsenal Women’s team has blown us away with their quality performances over the last three months. After a rocky start to the season, under former head coach Eidevall, our Gunners turned things around and haven’t tasted defeat since mid-October under interim coach Renee Slegers. In 11 games across all competitions, Arsenal boasts 10 wins and a draw.\nOur Gunners currently find themselves third on the WSL table, just a point behind second-place Manchester City and seven points behind Chelsea. They’ve also sealed their spot in the Champions League quarter-finals, impressively doing so with two group games to spare. After winning their remaining Champions League group games, they topped their UEFA Women’s Champions League group C ahead of Bayern Munich, Juventus, and Valerenga.\nI think most of us attribute Arsenal Women’s resurgence to Renee Slegers’ methods and the players’ hard work, and it seems that Bristol City Women manager Steve Kirby agrees. He’s observed something special in Arsenal under Renee Slegers. He believes the Arsenal women’s stars are buzzing with confidence, which, coupled with their quality, has propelled them to success.\nKirby said , “I think the huge difference in the work that I’ve seen, especially since Renée has taken over, is the confidence in the team. They’ve got a selection of fantastic players, but they are [now] players who are confident and playing well.”\nPlayers like Emily Fox impressing and winning Player of the Month , Caitlin Foord banging in goals and reestablishing herself on the right wing, Alessia Russo going on a goal-scoring spree , and Steph Catley impressing at central defense —all of this is down to confidence.\nRusso scores worldie against Bayern Munich Tim Grover once said, “Confidence is the ultimate drug, and winning is the dealer. It’s the cure for doubt and insecurity and panic and low self-esteem.”\nArsenal Women’s FA Cup 4th Round clash with Bristol City was postponed and has been resheduled for January 29th , kick-off 19:45, at Meadow Park.\nIt seems our Gunner women stars are riding high on this confidence, and we hope they stay there.
