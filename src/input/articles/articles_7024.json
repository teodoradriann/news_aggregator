    "text": "Oakwood University holds prayer vigil to honor departed student’s memory Jeavonn Barracks passed away after a swimming incident at the university. HUNTSVILLE, Ala. ( [WAFF](http://www.waff.com/)) - Students at Oakwood University are in mourning after the loss of sophomore student Jeavonn Barracks. In a release, [Oakwood University says Barracks was hospitalized after a “swimming incident” at the school’s natatorium.](https://www.waff.com/2024/02/23/oakwood-university-student-dies-after-swimming-incident/) It was announced Friday that Barracks passed away. Students and school officials gathered Friday evening at the Eternal Flame located between the Blake Center and the Eva B. Dykes library for a prayer vigil in Barracks’ honor. Barracks’ fellow students and professors said a few words on what he meant to them. Multiple prayers were shared for the family and girlfriend of Barracks. He was a pre-med student with plans to attend medical school. His classmates, including junior Gevenson Yllste, described him as a musician and a gentleman. ”I really think that he was a inspiration to other young men like how to be a man, how to be a man of character, how to be a man of integrity. I think that’s something that we’re really going to be missing here at Oakwood,” said Yllste. The university says they will be providing counseling services for students and staff during this time of grief.

    "text": "NEWBURYPORT — A police inspector, the public schools' director of facilities and the owners of The Screening Room were among those handed Public and Community Service Awards by Mayor Sean Reardon following Wednesday's annual State of the City address. The Public and Community Service Awards are given each year to public servants and city residents who have given selflessly of themselves. Categories include business, public, individual community service and youth community service, and each winner must have been nominated by a community member or members. Just as he did the year before, Reardon followed up his second State of the City by naming this year's winners, but this time with a twist. Reardon told the finalists that the city received roughly 50 nominations this year, with multiple coming in for the same people, so they were all, in fact, winners. \"So many people put in multiple nominations for this crew, that's why I decided to make them all winners tonight,\" he said. PEG Center for Art & Activism founder Paula Estey received one of three individual service awards for transforming her art gallery into a space committed to community service, civic engagement and activism. \"This year marks the seventh anniversary of the Women in Action Huddle of Newburyport, where Paula is the founder,\" Reardon said. \"We owe Paula and the Huddle a great debt of gratitude for their investment in the Clipper City Rail Trail, including the edible gardens and the Uvalde Remembrance Garden.\" Estey accepted her award to boisterous applause and said Thursday she was completely humbled by the honor. \"I've never gotten an award like this before and I'll cherish it forever,\" she said. \"Frankly, I'm pretty emotional about it. But it really is a group effort between the PEG Center, the Huddle and all our volunteers. We're all feet to the ground over here.\" Plogging Newburyport founder Jim McCarthy received an individual service award for his continued efforts to beautify the city by assisting the Parks Commission and the Department of Public Services in digging holes, planting trees, and watering the trees in parks and on streets. The mayor said McCarthy also donates money annually to pay for trees across the city and spends hours picking up trash. \"Jim is also an active Rotarian and annually cleans the Route 1 rotary and plants flowers,\" Reardon said. \"He is a model citizen and Newburyport owes him great praise for the hundreds of hours he spends making Newburyport more beautiful.\" Rupert A. Nock Middle School field hockey coach Nicole DeRosa took home an individual service award for her success with her team, as well as coordinating offseason training, participation and tournaments and providing guidance to the athletes and their families. A trio of city employees, Recreation and Youth Services Enrichment Coordinator Tarah MacGregor, Public School Director of Facilities Steve Bergholm and Police Inspector Dani Sinclair, took home public service awards. MacGregor is president of the volunteer Newburyport Pride group and Reardon said she managed community support for local LGBTQ+ youth when an Over the Rainbow dance co-sponsored by the North Shore Alliance for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Youth and Newburyport Youth Services came under fire from a Facebook-born group called Massachusetts Informed Parents in the spring of 2022. \"(MacGregor) also thought proactively to collaborate with others to create an authentic LGBTQ+ community response, in the first Newburyport Pride celebration in 2023,\" Reardon said. \"With the support of the city and the Diversity Equity and Inclusion (Alliance), local businesses and nonprofits, and a team of board members and volunteers, the event was an overwhelming success.\" Bergholm's diligence maintaining and upgrading school facilities, Reardon said, has guaranteed the buildings remain in great shape. \"Steve has helped the city save thousands of kilowatts and gas therms in addition to hundreds of thousands in dollars throughout his many years in this role,\" the mayor said. \"He has also been integral in helping Newburyport maintain its Green Community status and being recognized as a leading by example community in the state. Steve is retiring this year and it will be a big loss for the city. Thank you, Steve, for your leadership.\" Sinclair is the program director for the collaborative effort between 34 police departments, the Essex County Sheriff's Department and social service agencies, known as Essex County Outreach, which assists individuals and families experiencing substance abuse disorder, mental health/behavioral health needs, and offers harm-reduction strategies as well. Under Sinclair's leadership, Reardon said, the program has connected people in need of services with various local service providers. Newburyport High School students Isla and Jackson DeVivo received the evening's only youth community service award for founding Mission Sox. Using social media and word of mouth, community members donated over 1,500 pairs of socks during last year's Boston Red Sox home opener. \"They recognized a critical need for socks in homeless communities in the region and wanted to do something that would truly make a difference,\" Reardon said. The Screening Room owners Ben and Becca Fundis took home the business service award for their collaboration with many local organizations such as the Jeanne Geiger Crisis Center, the PEG Center for Art & Activism, Storm Surge, the Merrimack Valley Feline Rescue Society, Rescue Inc., and the Newburyport Documentary Film Festival to expand public information and/or fundraising. \"They took ownership (of the theater) just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a tough time to buy a movie theater,\" Reardon said. \"From the beginning, they preserved the homey, local atmosphere of the theater, including Andrew Mungo's voice for preliminary on-screen announcements.\"",

    "title": "Fluidra impulsa un informe de l&#8217;aigua amb del repte d&#8217;una gestió sostenible",
    "text": "Fluidra va presentar l’informe ‘L’aigua i les piscines: cada gota compta’, en col·laboració amb l’Institut Espanyol d’Analistes i el suport d’experts externs, amb què recorre l’estat actual de l’aigua. La companyia recull les tendències que estan definint el futur d’aquest bé tan preuat i els usos diversos que se li donen en sectors com la indústria, l’agricultura o l’ús municipal. El document indica que, en un context en què la demanda d’aigua s’ha multiplicat quatre vegades en els darrers 60 anys, la gestió responsable és de vital importància. Davant d’aquest repte, Fluidra ressalta la necessitat d’una acció conjunta de tots els actors involucrats –indústria, governs i ciutadans– per millorar la gestió de l’aigua a través de pràctiques i tecnologies innovadores que garanteixin un ús responsable i sostenible. Tot i que les piscines només representen entre un 0,75% i l’1% del consum total de l’aigua municipal, Fluidra es presenta com un actor clau en el debat sobre la gestió de l’aigua a escala global. En aquest sentit, Fluidra va exposar que ja compta amb solucions que minimitzen l’impacte de les piscines a través de la implementació de tecnologies avançades i pràctiques sostenibles en el disseny i el manteniment de piscines com millorar l’eficiència en la recirculació de l’aigua i reduir les pèrdues per evaporació, esquitxades i neteja de filtres. L’informe presentat proposa solucions integrals per a la gestió i l’ús sostenible de l’aigua, dirigides a diversos sectors i nivells d’acció. Entre les principals mesures, s’inclouen tecnologies d’estalvi i eficiència com el reg de precisió a l’agricultura i la recirculació d’aigua a la indústria, a més d’infraestructures verdes. També es promou la reutilització i el tractament d’aigües residuals i l’ús de tecnologies de dessalinització per incrementar la disponibilitat d’aigua en zones amb escassetat, el monitoratge digital en temps real i polítiques com la tarifació progressiva i la protecció d’ecosistemes. L’estudi també descriu els beneficis socials de les piscines, facilitant la interacció entre diferents grups socioeconòmics i de diferents edats, fomentant la inclusió i la diversitat, així com l’impacte positiu en la salut de les persones. “La gestió de l’aigua constitueix un repte d‟enorme transcendència atès el canvi climàtic, les necessitats del teixit productiu i les llars, l‟èxit del sector turístic i els desequilibris territorials entre l‟oferta i la demanda. Agraïm a Fluidra la publicació d‟aquest estudi tan informatiu”, afirma Enric Fernández, vicepresident de l’Institut Espanyol d‟Analistes. “L’aigua és un recurs finit, i la nostra relació amb ella ha de ser de respecte i responsabilitat. Aquest informe ens recorda la importància de gestionar l’aigua de manera sostenible, de fer-la servir amb saviesa, i de trobar solucions innovadores per reduir l’impacte ambiental de les piscines, mentre maximitzem els seus beneficis socials”, afirma Eloi Planes, president executiu de Fluidra.",

    "text": "B lazing neon signs, Pokemon centers, and seemingly endless arcades and capsule toy machine stores. Japan is no doubt an incredibly exciting place to visit at any age–especially for kids. But while the lively, futuristic, manga comic vibe of decidedly overwhelming Tokyo certainly has its draw, it’s far from the only place in Japan that’s worth exploring.\nDespite its reputation for being an expensive destination, Japan has become way more affordable in recent years. This has, of course, attracted many more tourists than the country has ever experienced, and the result is tangible. Even ancient traditions like tea ceremonies and sacred temple pilgrimages seemed to have mutated into something akin to a Japanese theme park. Everywhere is crowded .\nBut, as our month-long family trip unfolded, we found out we could still introduce our son to “real” Japan. The one that glows like nowhere else in the world with thousands of years of magic, mindfulness, and ceremony. The one we and so many others have fallen in love with (our seven-year-old now included!). Just as we hoped, Japan is still an awesome and exceptionally family-friendly destination that’s perfect for all ages, as long as you know where to go, where to stay, and where to look–including getting out of the cities.\nThe most popular route from Tokyo to Kyoto remains a great choice for those new to Japan, as there are so many bucket list spots worth visiting in these areas. But some of our best days happened when we left these hotspots. Keep them as a base, but don’t stop there!\nTokyo With Kids Tokyo sings, literally. Everywhere you go, you’ll hear tinkling melodies telling you which station you’re at on the metro, when your coffee is ready, and what the time is while you’re wandering the streets, taking in the looming skyscrapers standing next to ancient temples. Every child is going to be awe-struck by this place, and despite the chaos, you shouldn’t really visit Japan without seeing it. Here’s how to do it right:\nVisit Yanaka While the mayhem of Akihabara and Harajuku can be fun, it’s well worth making excursions to some quieter areas. Yanaka is one of the few places around the city (just under an hour from the center of Tokyo by train) that survived the bombings of WWII. As a result, it still retains that old Japan charm. Little market streets where you can find cheap used kimono, ceramics and food, traditional wooden houses, tranquil ancient cemeteries, over 60 temples and shrines, and…cats (loads and loads of cats) make this a perfect Tokyo day trip.\nYanaka street markets Cowardlion/Shutterstock Every Day’s a School Day One good thing about the boom in tourism is that many cultural crafts and practices have become more accessible for us all to try. Many of the experiences available are on the synthetic side, devoid of all that’s really behind it, however, some options available are quite special.\nIn Asakusa (which in recent years has become extremely busy and feels more like a tourist trap than anything else), we were surprised and delighted to find a gem hiding inside the Ninja Samurai museum –an opportunity to train with a martial arts sensei of genuine samurai lineage. Anyone can book a lesson. We also discovered that expert-led experience provider Wabunka excelled in offerings for families, with classes in Kabuki calligraphy, tea ceremony, knife making, and washi painting available among many other unusual choices.\nWhere to Stay in Tokyo With Kids For those with a big budget who love luxury, make The Peninsula your home from home. Unlike most high-end hotels, this one pays homage throughout to Japanese heritage, and it’s really geared towards families too, with huge family-sized beds, in-room goodie bags, kid’s menus, and a pool (complete with armbands and floats). If you want your excursions and Japanese craft classes taken care of for you, they’ll do this too, with activities like adventurous food tours and box garden making available. For something fun and funky for older kids, try The Lively in Ajabuzuban –this zone is known for being Tokyo’s most family-friendly district, complete with playgrounds, pet shops, and Montessori schools to visit. For a full apartment setup (this one even comes with a washer and dryer to get your laundry done), Mimaru in Asakusa puts you right in the middle of it all, making it a great jumping-off point.\nCourtesy of The Peninsula Tokyo Osaka With Kids This popular stopping place between Tokyo and Kyoto offers so much more than its world-famous ‘Doton Bori’–a crowded shopping district with a Blade Runner-esque billboard backdrop set on a river. In fact, I’d vote for giving Doton Bori a miss altogether!\nInstead, hop on a tram to Sakai for an inner-city Ryokan experience, and settle yourself into the new Osaka Four Seasons hotel, which has built-in a whole Ryokan floor to offer guests an authentic Japanese experience. Or, for something really fun, book into the Risonare , which comes complete with a whole floor dedicated to children’s learning through nature and play, fun, educational sessions where parents can drop the kids off for a while, and climbing nets and drawing walls in the bedrooms!\nKyoto With Kids You’ll instantly feel more relaxed in Kyoto. It’s a lot busier than it used to be, but renting our own little apartment in a small neighborhood through the Japan Experience (a living arrangement that comes with a helpful “house angel” who can assist you with all the local insider knowledge you need) helped us to feel right at home. It’s cheaper than a hotel, too, and perfect if you’re traveling as a family, as you can all stick together.\nHike up Mount Kurama About a 40-minute train ride out of Kyoto, you’ll find a treasure trove of ancient tradition, folklore, and ceremony. Mount Kurama is famed for being both the birthplace of samurai and the birthplace of reiki, lined with 1,000-year-old cypress trees, shrines, temples, and “power spots” where you can charge up your energy! What jet-lagged parent doesn’t need that?! You can visit alone or enhance your experience as we did by opting for a Nara Spirit tour with a knowledgeable (and English-speaking) guide, Akiko, who took us to all the secret spots. These included a raked garden depicting the spaceship of the Venusian God that legend says landed on the mountain millions of years ago and an underground, hidden altar I don’t think my son will ever forget.\nKurama-dera, a temple situated at the base of Mount Kurama B-hide the scene/Shutterstock Don’t be put off by the idea of a “hike”–it’s fairly easygoing for all ages, even if it is all uphill, and it’s worth the effort. If you have little ones who really can’t manage, there’s a cable car that will zip you up to the top.\nTry an Onsen Bathing in a therapeutic hot spring is something so quintessentially Japanese, however, it’s worth noting that most Onsen do require you to go fully nude (even the kids) and the baths are separated by sex for all ages. If you and your children are happy to fully immerse yourselves in this culture, you can bathe in a hot spring at the top of Mount Kurama (kids are welcome). If you’d like to try the benefits of Onsen as a family and would rather wear bathing suits, book in to stay at Hotel The Mitsui , located opposite Nijo Castle. This hotel is fully dedicated to traditional Japanese décor and experience, including offering a welcome tea ceremony and the opportunity to wear kimono, however, they ask all guests to wear bathing suits in their private natural onsen.\nCountryside Excursions With Kids A lot of the unique charm of traditional Japan has drifted out of the main cities, but it remains as awe-inspiring as ever, in the small villages and prefectures in regions lesser discovered by tourists. Although Nara is wonderful, the deer park is now very crowded, so you may want to head to Asuka instead–a village that has been left completely untouched since the ’50s, home to the first Buddhist temple and the earliest foundations in Japan, ancient mysterious megaliths and the best strawberry cream cake you’ll ever taste (grab one from the farm shop in the Asuka village car park–it’s like eating a delicious cloud).\nAfter that, stop by the local soy sauce brewery and try your hand at making a bottle for yourself, guided by a 4th generation soy sauce artisan; stay in nearby Ryokan “Branchera” for an incredibly authentic family-friendly Japanese home experience, and treat yourself to a Michelin starred meal at Da Terra –probably the only Michelin restaurant in the world in someone’s house, where you can hear kids playing through the walls and the ingredient’s come from the self-taught chef’s back garden.\nCourtesy of HOTEL THE MITSUI KYOTO If you’re prepared to go further afield, The Kii Peninsula is a must for any adventurous family. Here, you can visit the legendary Ama pearl divers for lunch of freshly caught sea snails, barracuda, and squid, and hear tales from the 70-year-old female divers of their lives swimming for pearls and fish in the ocean, as has been the way for 5,000 years. And don’t miss Ise Jingu , “the soul of Japan,” a huge and extremely beautiful Shinto shrine built for the Sun Goddess, Amaterasu–we were amazed to find very few tourists here, and there are loads for kids to see and do directly outside the shrine too on the neighboring shopping street.\nDespite the reality of over-tourism in Japan, it remains my family’s favorite country in the world. When you visit with yours, be sure to dig a little deeper to get the most out of your stay.",

Samuele Privitera, 19 anni, originario della provincia di Imperia, è morto ieri sera (mercoledì 16 luglio) dopo essere stato ricoverato in condizioni molto gravi all'ospedale Umberto Parini di Aosta in seguito a una caduta di cui è stato vittima ieri nel corso della prima tappa del 61° giro ciclistico della Valle d'Aosta-Mont Blanc, una delle brevi corse a tappe più importanti per gli under 23. Privitera avrebbe compiuto 20 anni il prossimo ottobre.\nIl ciclista Samuele Privitera morto dopo una caduta in gara\nNon è ancora chiara la dinamica dell'incidente in cui è rimasto coinvolto Privitera, lungo un tratto di strada in discesa in località Pontey, a 32 chilometri dal termine della gara che si è conclusa nel centro di Aosta. Secondo una prima ricostruzione, probabilmente sbalzato da un dosso, Samuele Privitera ha perso il controllo della sua bicicletta ed è caduto in discesa. Avrebbe perso il caschetto di protezione, sbattendo violentemente la testa contro un cancello. Nell'impatto ha subìto un trauma cranico molto grave ed è andato in arresto cardiaco. Rianimato sul posto, è stato portato in ospedale, intubato e ricoverato in prognosi riservata. Dopo poche ore il tragico epilogo.",

    "text": "PALMA 1 Nov. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nLa Agencia Estatal de Meteorología ha extendido el aviso naranja por fuertes lluvias que pueden dejar acumulaciones de 50 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora y de 120 litros en pocas horas al conjunto del archipiélago.\nEn el caso de Ibiza y Formentera, se espera que la alerta se desactive a las 19.59 horas de este viernes, mientras que en Mallorca y Menorca estará vigente hasta primera hora de este sábado.\nEn Mallorca, la alerta se ha activado a las 10.00 horas mientras que en Menorca se activará más tarde, a las 16.00 horas. En ambos casos estará vigente hasta primera hora del sábado. En el caso de Ibiza y Formentera, la alerta era inicialmente amarilla pero se ha elevado a naranja.\nAnte este escenario, el Servicio de Emergencias 112 mantiene activado el Índice de Gravedad 1 (IG1) del Plan Meteobal por lluvias y tormentas en todo el archipiélago.\nEmergencias espera este viernes una \"jornada complicada\" por lo que ha pedido precaución a la población.\nEl IG1 se activa cuando la información meteorológica permite prever la inminencia de un fenómeno adverso con probabilidad elevada de riesgo para personas y bienes y se declara en aquella situación en la que se puede producir un fenómeno adverso en zonas localizadas, la atención de la cual puede quedar asegurada con los medios y recursos disponibles en las zonas afectadas pero con seguimiento supramunicipal. Este nivel de alerta contempla una prealerta de movilización de medios.\nEn un comunicado emitido posteriormente en el que recuerdan que en las Pitiusas está activo el IG0, la Dirección General de Emergencias recomienda planificar las visitas a los cementerios en función de las condiciones meteorológicas.\nPara coordinar posibles actuaciones conjuntas, la Dirección General de Emergencias ha reunido al Grupo de Soporte Técnico del Plan con representantes, entre otros, de los Bomberos del Consell de Mallorca, Bomberos de Palma, Cuerpo Nacional de Policía, Guardia Civil, AEMET, Carreteras del Consell de Mallorca, Ibanat, SAMU 061, Recursos Hídricos y RiscBal.\nAsí, ante la posibilidad de que se produzcan inundaciones como consecuencia de las intensas lluvias y dado que este viernes se celebra la festividad de Todos los Santos, se recomienda a la ciudadanía planificar las visitas a los cementerios en función de las condiciones meteorológicas y extremar las precauciones, prestando especial atención a las personas más vulnerables.\nAsimismo, recuerda las medidas a tener en cuenta en situaciones de este tipo como, en el hogar, asegurar puertas y ventanas y quedarse en las zonas altas de la casa. Aconsejan también retirar del exterior todo lo que pueda ser arrastrado por el agua y trasladar medicamentos, documentos y elementos de valor, así como comida y agua potable a los lugares altos de la casa.\nSe recomienda también evitar los sótanos o zonas bajas, como garajes, y desconectar el interruptor general de electricidad en el caso de que el agua ya haya entrado en la casa.\nEn el exterior, aconsejan alejarse de torrentes y zonas inundables y, en zona urbana, buscar refugio en un edificio. No se aconseja caminar por zonas con agua en movimiento ya que, cuanto más rápido corre el agua, más peligro hay.\nEn carretera, hay que evitar los desplazamientos en coche y, si es necesario circular, se debe moderar la velocidad y aumentar la distancia de seguridad. Se tiene que hacer por autopistas, autovías y carreteras principales. En caso de baja visibilidad, se debe detener el vehículo y señalizar su posición.\nNo se debe entrar en zonas inundables, aunque parezca que hay poca agua ya que, con poca altura de agua, los coches flotan y son arrastrados fácilmente. Si el coche comienza a flotar y es arrastrado, hay que salir del vehículo de forma inmediata y, si no se puede por la puerta, se debe hacer por la ventana.\nEn estos casos es recomendable abandonar el vehículo y dirigirse a zonas más altas en caso de que el coche quede inmovilizado por el agua o que el nivel de agua ya llegue al eje. Aconsejan también llevar el móvil cargado y suficiente combustible en el vehículo y no aparcar en puentes, aceras o desembocaduras. En caso de emergencia, hay que llamar al 112.",
