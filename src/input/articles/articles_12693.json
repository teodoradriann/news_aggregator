    "text": "Faithful flock to St. Patrick’s Cathedral to pray for Pope Francis in battle with double pneumonia\nHundreds gathered for Sunday mass at New York City’s St. Patrick’s Cathedral to pray for Pope Francis, who remains in critical condition after he was diagnosed with double pneumonia.\nCardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, relayed the pontiff and Vatican’s message that the pope was “resting comfortably” as he reminded the worried worshipers that Francis has a history with health issues that he has overcome to lead the Catholic Church.\n“He keeps the grit and determination, the resilience, and he’s really taught us… the transformative redemptive value of suffering,” Dolan said.\n“Today at least they say he’s resting comfortably, it’s kind of good to know that he’s not suffering,” he added.\nThe pope was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after experiencing difficulty breathing for several days, with doctors diagnosing him with pneumonia in both lungs.\nThe Vatican said his condition was critical for the first time on Saturday, with the pontiff needing supplemental oxygen and blood transfusions following a “prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis.”\nLifelong New Yorker and philanthropist Barbara Zucker, 87, said she came down to St. Patrick’s to pray for the pope, joined by her husband Donald, who is Jewish.\n“I just don’t want to lose him because he’s been very special,” Zucker told The Post.\n“I’m hoping that when they do have a conclave because he’s pretty sick, that they’ll have somebody as good as him, and maybe better. He cares about everyone,” she said of the ailing pontiff.\nDawn Cortese, 56, of Bergen County, New Jersey, said she made the trek to Manhattan with a friend to show solidarity with Francis, who she said serves as the best representative of the Catholic Church.\n“I just hope that he recovers and that he’s not in any pain, and I’m praying for him,” she said.\nFellow Garden State resident Louis Vacca, 78, said he was upset to hear the news of Francis’ health.\n“That’s the father of the church. So we believe in him and God,” Vacca said. “We’re praying, we’re praying for him.”\nDolan, who was part of the conclave that elected Francis to the role of pope in 2013, said he too was worried about pontiff’s health as he reminisced about their meeting in 2015.\n“He was kind of mesmerized by the size of [New York City], and he was very, very moved by the enthusiasm of the welcome we gave,” Dolan said of Francis’ visit to the Big Apple.\n“I’ve gotten to know him, so I worry about him as I would as I would my own father, because he is our holy father,” the archbishop added\nDouble pneumonia is a serious infection that can inflame and scar both lungs, making it difficult to breathe. Francis is particularly prone to lung infections after he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed.",

    "title": "Crafting Engaging Email Copy: Do’s and Don’ts - TechTarget",
    "text": "Welcome to the last installment of our three-part blog series, in which we explore how to strengthen your email marketing efforts. In parts one and two, we presented tips for creating subject lines and standout calls to action (CTAs). Now, we’re going to dive into strategies for developing email copy that will engage your readers: IT business professionals. As a marketing copywriter, I write emails for this audience every day. The following tips are informed by my experiences and those of my colleagues.\nBefore we delve into those tips, we must first consider the factors that make engaging IT professionals through email challenging. Along with being extremely busy, IT pros tend to be risk averse : they prioritize avoiding issues over seeking out unfamiliar opportunities. Given the many obstacles facing IT pros – straining budgets or proliferating threats, for example – their aversion to risk is perfectly understandable. But unfortunately, it does not work in your favor. So, how can you engage the seemingly un-engageable?\nTip #1: Provide insights about topics that matter to your audience (technical challenges, market changes, upcoming deadlines, etc.) in a direct, brief manner that avoids frills. IT workers, like all professionals, need relevant, timely and enlightening information about their field, but they don’t have the time or interest to read through dense emails or ones that read like creative writing assignments. As you write an email, get to your point quickly and save your fiction-like prose for other writing endeavors. What other strategies should you keep in mind as you write? Let’s take a look at the experience of a network engineer, Pamela, to find out.\nHaving five minutes before her next meeting begins, Pamela decides to check her inbox. When she clicks on the first of nine unread emails from various security vendors, she is confronted by a wall of text: a single paragraph that’s seven, eight or maybe nine lines long. She doesn’t pause to count; instead, she swiftly deletes the email.\nThis brings us to . . .\nTip #2: Space out your copy instead of using large chunks of text to convey your insights. Yes, your insights are meaningful – but so is the format in which you package them. If information is packaged in a daunting, overwhelming way, readers – especially readers as busy as IT pros like Pamela – will avoid investing their time to slog through. Luckily, there’s an easy, alternative approach to formatting copy: space it out. Simply break a seven-line paragraph into two or three shorter ones, creating a more digestible reading experience that also visually drives momentum to your call to action. Now, let’s turn our attention toward messaging.\nWhen you email IT pros, you have a goal, whether that is to educate them about a topic, promote a product or have them download a report. This goal should be at the forefront of your mind as you craft your copy – it isn’t something you should stray far from as you write.\nTip #3: Ensure that every sentence in your copy supports your goal. Because someone like Pamela receives so many emails, having a clear, focused purpose is not enough to set your email apart from the rest in her inbox. Along with supplying a focused message, it is also your job to convey the unique-ness of your insights, and how those insights can address her needs. But how can you do that?\nTip #4: Specificity is your friend – don’t rely on overly general statements. You can supply your messaging with specificity by dialing into the details of the topic that your email concerns. To understand the power of specificity, let’s first take a look at the weakness of generality. Here’s an example of copy that is too general and high-level for a targeted security audience:\n“Keeping data safe is an increasing priority for businesses of all sizes, as ransomware is on the rise and poses a significant threat to your organization.”\nOn a macro-level, readers are astutely aware of the increasing rise in ransomware attacks, making the statement obvious and unhelpful. To move from general to specific, we can home in on striking details regarding the upward trend. For example, we can answer key questions like: Which businesses are being affected – and how? What lessons do the ramifications reveal?\nA revision, which narrows its focus on the 2023 Telus Canadian Ransomware Study , reads:\n“According to the 2023 Telus Canadian Ransomware Study, 67% of Canadian organizations experienced a ransomware incident last year. This trend showcases that identifying and detecting network vulnerabilities that ransomware could exploit is of paramount importance – yet is difficult to achieve across hybrid cloud networks.”\nIn addition to highlighting the credibility and force that specificity lends, the above example showcases a maneuver that supports the mission of specificity. That maneuver is . . .\nTip #5: Leverage analysts’ relevant, eye-catching statistics. Here are a few other examples, based on real lead generation promotional copy, written by myself and my colleagues:\n17% of organizations report that their approach to security hygiene and posture management (SHPM) is completely decentralized, while 41% consider their approach to be only partially centralized, according to research by . analysts’ 2023 research data showcases that 75% of organizations experienced multiple account or credential compromises over the last 12 months. To understand the benefits that a strong identity-security strategy can deliver, surveyed 1,500 security, IT and DevSecOps decision-makers. So, we’ve covered the do’s and don’ts of crafting email copy that will engage IT pros, insights which can be boiled down to five key tips. Keep these recommendations in mind as you craft your next email. And for additional guidance for strengthening your email marketing strategy, explore the rest of our blog series and this post about why, and how to harness intent data to inform your outreach.",

    "title": "Presentadora sufre parálisis facial en vivo y dice entre lágrimas: \"No puedo hablar\"",
    "text": "El video en el que la reconocida presentadora Pamela Díaz sufrió una parálisis en pleno programa en vivo se volvió rápidamente viral.\nLa televisión chilena vivió un momento de gran tensión el miércoles 19 de febrero, cuando la reconocida presentadora Pamela Díaz, popularmente conocida como ‘La Fiera’, sufrió un delicado episodio de salud en plena transmisión en vivo del programa ‘Hay que decirlo’ en Canal 13.\nMientras se preparaba para realizar una mención comercial, Díaz comenzó a experimentar un síntoma inesperado: perdió el control de una parte de su labio y notó dificultades para hablar. La incomodidad se hizo evidente tanto para ella como para sus compañeros en el set, quienes de inmediato notaron algo extraño en su rostro.\n“Hace mucho tiempo que no me sentía tan consciente de lo que yo soy”, comentó Díaz en un video publicado en su cuenta de Instagram. Aunque intentó restarle importancia al percance, la preocupación creció cuando su compañero Nacho Gutiérrez le sugirió detenerse. “Le dije: ‘cabezón, mírame, ¿qué tengo?’. Me vio y me dijo: ‘Se te va el labio un poco. Ándate al tiro porque esto puede ser peligroso’”, relató la presentadora. Lea también: Shakira en Colombia: las exigencias de la artista que nadie esperaba\nA pesar de la advertencia, Pamela inicialmente se mostró reacia a abandonar la transmisión, insistiendo en terminar la mención antes de dirigirse a la clínica. Sin embargo, el malestar fue aumentando, y cuando la producción le pidió sonreír frente a cámara, la situación se hizo evidente: su rostro mostraba signos claros de una parálisis facial.\nEste fue el diagnóstico de la presentadora Pamela Díaz\nTras ser llevada de urgencia a un centro médico, a Díaz se le diagnosticó una parálisis facial leve, probablemente causada por estrés, según informaron los médicos. Este trastorno, conocido médicamente como parálisis de Bell, afecta los nervios faciales y suele manifestarse con debilidad muscular en un lado de la cara, dificultad para hablar o tragar, y en algunos casos, pérdida de la capacidad de cerrar un ojo.\nLa propia Díaz confirmó que, días antes del incidente, había sentido un hormigueo en los labios, aunque no le dio importancia en su momento. “Quedé rara. Dije: ‘Esto no es tan normal, no puedo hablar bien’”, comentó en sus redes sociales. Los síntomas, aunque leves, fueron lo suficientemente alarmantes para que los médicos recomendaran reposo y manejo del estrés como tratamiento inicial.\nYa fuera de peligro, ‘La Fiera’ reapareció en redes sociales para tranquilizar a sus seguidores y reflexionar sobre la importancia de escuchar las señales del cuerpo. “No se preocupen, estoy bien. Sé que es un tema que parece que ha pasado a mucha gente. No sé si esto es viral o si de verdad es estrés”, afirmó.

Aunque sus causas exactas no siempre son claras, puede estar relacionada con infecciones virales, estrés extremo o trastornos autoinmunes.\nDe acuerdo con la Clínica Mayo, los síntomas pueden incluir:\nPublicidad\n- Dificultad para sonreír o fruncir el ceño.\n- Caída de un lado de la cara.\n- Problemas para cerrar un ojo o comer.\nPublicidad\n- Sensibilidad al sonido en un oído o pérdida parcial del gusto.\nEn la mayoría de los casos, el pronóstico es positivo, y las personas afectadas suelen recuperarse completamente en cuestión de semanas o meses con el tratamiento adecuado, que puede incluir medicamentos antiinflamatorios, terapia física y manejo del estrés.\n[@el13cl]Un percance médico que ocurrió en vivo: Pamela Díaz sufrió una parálisis facial en plena emisión del programa Hay que decirlo.

Image: Dundonnell Mountain Rescue Team\nDundonnell Mountain Rescue Team battled through”atrocious” whiteout conditions to save a woman on An Cabar.\nThe fallen walker slid off the hillside near the summit of the hill, near Ben Wyvis. After failing to make her way back up the steep slope, she phoned the police who alerted Dundonnell MRT around midday on Saturday.\nRescuers were deployed, along with two dogs from Search & Rescue Dog Association Scotland.\nThe teams headed out as the weather started to worsen on Saturday . In all they spent nearly 16 hours on the hill.\nSpeaking with the Press & Journal, team leader Iain Nesbitt said: “She was extremely lucky. We were extremely lucky that we got a break in the weather.\n“I’ve been on the rescue team for 20-odd years now and that’s probably one of the very few times where I have been out where the weather conditions were absolutely atrocious.”\nThe rescue was complicated by challenging weather conditions over the weekend. Image: Dundonnell Mountain Rescue Team Challenging rescue with windy, wintry conditions on An Cabar Teams initially searched around the walker’s last known position, but that proved fruitless.\nAs whiteout conditions set in, the rescuers had to withdraw and regroup.\nOnce the weather cleared slightly, the rescuers headed to Beallach Mor to search again. After around an hour, they heard shouting and saw the light from a headtorch.\nFrom there rescuers were able to reach the woman, wrapping her in a blizzard survival jacket and giving her something warm to drink and some food.\nDundonnell MRT team leader Iain Nesbitt said: “Carrying a head torch has definitely saved her life.”\nRescue 151 arrived but then had to withdraw as the winds were too strong. Considering the conditions and where the walker was found, the rescuers determined they had to belay the person further up the mountain.\nThe rescued person was airlifted at around 2am on December 31. Image: Dundonnell Mountain Rescue Team After pulling her up three belays of 100-metres or so, the team reached the ridge. From there it was easier walking, according to Iain Nesbitt. The team led the woman down the path to a sheltered point. From there they stretchered her down to flatter ground.\nOnce there, the Rescue 151 team was able to airlift the walker to hospital at around 2am on December 31.\nMr Nesbitt added: “I have full respect for my teammates who did a fantastic job in very difficult circumstances.”\nWintry conditions mean busy weekend for MRTs The cold and harsh conditions that closed out 2023 for some areas meant it was a busy end to the year for other mountain rescue teams too. The Met Office had issued a yellow rain and snow warning for the area for most of Saturday.\nA stranded climber was stretchered a mile down a mountain by Cairngorm Mountain Rescue in -2C snow blizzards on December 30.\nSeveral mountain rescue teams had busy end to 2023. Image: Dundonnell Mountain Rescue Team The woman became separated from others in her party near Coire an t-Sneachda, with the full mountain rescue team dispatched at around 5.30pm.\nFurther south, Braemar Mountain Rescue was part of a search for two stranded people on Glen Tilt, late on December 28. Tayside Mountain Rescue Team was able to find them safely and lead them to safety.\nCairngorms climber lucky to be alive after being rescued during -2C snow blizzards and yellow weather warning",

    "text": "Look, maybe that much-touted door-knocking effort by Never Back Down will have some effect. But if it was building up support for DeSantis, don’t you think we would see at least some sign of growing DeSantis support in some recent poll? Actually, as bad as DeSantis’s numbers are, in most surveys he’s actually improving. In the Fox Business poll, DeSantis increased from 15 percent in September to 18 percent in December. In the Emerson poll, DeSantis increased from 14 percent in September to 15 percent in December. In CBS News’, DeSantis increased from 21 percent in September to 22 percent in December. In the Iowa State/Civiqs survey, DeSantis remained flat at 17 percent from October to December, and in the Des Moines Register poll, DeSantis increased from 16 percent to 19 percent. … I see a lot to like in DeSantis. But that doesn’t mean I’m blind to his flaws or in denial about how much of an underdog he is right now, or how high the climb ahead of him is. You folks do know that just because I’m telling you something doesn’t mean I like it, right? Have you run into so many people who only report the narrative that they prefer that you’ve forgotten that human beings are capable of reporting what’s actually happening, whether or not it’s what they want to report? [Jim’s right, and I’m the one who argued that early polls would miss the big organizing effort in Iowa. They still may be missing a turnout phenomenon, but one would expect to see some evidence of that in polling with less than three weeks to go to the caucuses. DeSantis could still pull off a surprise, but at the very least, we’re not seeing much direct evidence of it. And the indirect evidence, including the churn in DeSantis’ campaign and super-PAC leadership, suggests against the likelihood of success. — Ed]",
