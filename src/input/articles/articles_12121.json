    "title": "Next US president may face most dangerous world since 1945: Peter Apps",
    "text": "Newsdeck LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - According to a bipartisan committee set up by Congress to study the risk of a looming global war, whoever wins the U.S. presidential election in November will face the most challenging strategic situation since 1945. The Commission on U.S. National Defense Strategy – set up by Congress in 2022 – issued its report just under a month ago. It warned bluntly that the coming years “include the potential for near-term major war”, perhaps simultaneously with China, Russia and others, and for which the U.S. was “not prepared today”. The report was drawn up by former California Congresswoman Jane Harman; Eric Edelman, a U.S. former undersecretary of defense and ambassador to Turkey and Finland; retired U.S. General John M. Keane and five other former senior officials and think-tank insiders. It calls for root and branch reform of both the Pentagon and wider government structures, as well as more resources for defence and a national conversation about the risks. Those dangers, it argues, are now even more serious than during the first years of the original Cold War, with many more moving pieces. Whether either side in U.S. politics wishes to engage with that in an election year remains another question. While U.S. officials talk of China preparing its military to invade Taiwan by 2027 and the need to support Ukraine and deter Russia from further European land grabs, both U.S. presidential contenders have kept their messaging big, bold and mostly focused on domestic issues. With the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week, the Kamala Harris campaign has looked to project her candidacy as one of optimism and inclusion – a United States capable of tackling its own problems while continuing to lead the other democracies of the world. For Donald Trump and the Republicans who share his vision, in contrast, America is already unravelling, facing tough choices that include prioritising pushing back immigration and rolling back the long-term U.S. commitment to its allies. Not all decisions, of course, can wait for the next president. Within the Pentagon and U.S. military commands, planning is already well underway for the major military exercises of 2025, which for the first time will see significant forces moving from the U.S. mainland to support simultaneous drills in both Europe and the Pacific. In Europe, such exercises – inspired by similar 1970s and 1980s Cold War annual military movements known as “REFORGER” – have been underway since 2020, planned together with NATO’s annual drills and scaled up substantially following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine . Next year’s U.S. military posturing in the Pacific will be coordinated particularly with Australia as part of the biennial “TALISMAN SABRE” joint exercise with Washington traditionally run in June, July or August. The U.S. Air Force element will be known as “REFORPAC” in reference to the Europe Cold War drills. ONGOING UNKNOWNS But the Commission on U.S. National Defense Strategy report suggests such manoeuvres may not be enough, at least unless the U.S. and allies also ensure they have the industrial and human capacity ready to fight a simultaneous war with several enemies at once. How the next administration might do that, of course, remains another question. Before and after the 2022 Ukraine invasion, Joe Biden ‘s administration stressed its commitment to protecting European NATO members. Biden has also been the most outspoken U.S. president in recent history in suggesting he would use U.S. military force to defend Taiwan, going well beyond the deliberately obtuse language of “strategic ambiguity” more normally used by prior presidents and U.S. officials. Multiple sources report that the Biden administration went out of its way from late 2022 to communicate to Russia that use of any tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine would prompt an immediate and massive U.S. conventional attack on Russia’s military. If true, that acts as a reminder that U.S. military might can still act as a powerful deterrent on occasion – albeit not enough to stop the more limited fighting still seen in Ukraine. Without that U.S. deterrent, it seems unlikely that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government would have risked its current offensive into Russian territory . The authorities in Kyiv, however, pointedly appear to have kept Washington in the dark about their planning, complaining that doing anything else would have likely led to immediate leaks to the Washington Post and New York Times. An American reputation for being unable to keep secrets does not augur particularly well for a more dangerous coming era. Ukrainian officials and analysts say they have learnt much from Israel, which has made a point of ignoring U.S. calls for restraint in the Gaza war and beyond – and left the U.S. military having to respond to Iranian-backed missile attacks in the Red Sea, Iraq and Syria. For now, America’s allies and adversaries alike are working to ensure that they are ready to deal with either of the very different candidates for president. That contrasts with earlier in the summer, when – following Biden’s disastrous debate performance and the assassination attempt on Trump – a victory by the latter was seen as largely inevitable. Replacing Biden with Harris and the resulting shift in polls overturned those short-lived assumptions, with clarity on the result now unlikely until November’s votes are counted. AWKWARD QUESTIONS For now, the official Democratic foreign policy platform is simply that of Biden. But there is talk that Harris might want to bring in a new set of advisers, potentially with different policies. Nor is it clear that she would definitely follow Biden’s choices and approaches as outlined above. Trump says he wants to impose a peace settlement on Ukraine if he wins – although the Kyiv government has suggested it would rather see a deal struck with others such as China, and that its current offensive is in part designed to shape that outcome if needed by seizing Russian territory to trade. Some suspect a Harris administration might also ultimately pursue a peace deal. That would alarm those in Europe who worry that Putin will rearm once the Ukraine war is over, and may wish to test or ideally break the NATO alliance by grabbing territory from an eastern member of NATO. The Democratic party’s policy handbook for 2024 triggered headlines earlier this week for listing Europe before Asia. But behind the scenes, the Biden administration has been upfront in warning European partners that the U.S. is shifting focus towards the Pacific, while a new generation of Democrat foreign policy thinkers also argue that Washington must be more careful about what it commits to. Elbridge Colby, a Pentagon official in the 2017-21 Trump administration often touted as a senior figure if the Republicans win again, has spent much of the year reinforcing the argument that Washington must prioritise confronting China, if necessary pulling resources from Europe – but also warning that America’s Asian allies including Japan and South Korea should also do much more. Critically, that includes pressure on Taiwan itself – which spends 2.5 percent of gross domestic product on defence, not much for a country that might face China within years. Taiwan this year increased its conscription period to a year and has purchased new weapons, but is still seen as not well prepared for war. “If Taipei fails to invest in the island’s defences … America’s hands will be tied,” Colby warned in an article in the Taipei Times in May, warning that an unready Taiwan might be “no longer defensible”. If so, he wrote, the U.S. might reluctantly be forced to re-prioritise confronting and containing “China’s hegemonic ambitions after Taiwan falls”. Such discussions are arguably healthy, perhaps even vital. But they bring with them real risk. If America’s exposed allies are too reliant on the United States, they may not do enough to deter attacks and that may spark a conflict. But if suggestions the U.S. will hold back become too strong, U.S. adversaries may choose to chance their hand by striking – as Russia did in Ukraine in 2022. America’s next president will confront that reality soon after taking office. We do not yet know enough to truly judge how either candidate is likely to respond.

    "text": "A major geomagnetic storm is underway and the northern lights should be a magnificent show tonight, perhaps as good as the aurora back in May. This show should be better than the one that just happened a few nights ago. More good news is that the air quality has improved across the state. A weak front came through last night that suppressed wildfire smoke to the south. Friday will be partly to mostly cloudy with an isolated shower, highs again top out in the 60s. This weekend will be mostly sunny, dry, mild and windier across the plains. Saturday will be mostly sunny with highs in the 60s to around 70. Sunday will mainly clear with highs in the 60s and 70s. The unusually warm and dry pattern may continue through the middle of next week. Late next week, a pattern change is looking more likely with a chance at moisture and cooler temperatures that should slow those wildfires down. Temperatures will drop and snow levels will drop as well. A more active weather pattern is likely from there.Enjoy the northern lights!Curtis GrevenitzChief Meteorologist",

Mr Hall said it is, however, not right to say that the rising prices are unfair and industry only works to generate profits.\nMr Hall said that while no part of Australia is uninsurable, pricing can of course be a barrier. He said the insurance sector has to partner with the government, banks and others to come up with a right, transparent and judicious plan for properties most at risk.\nHe said underinsurance is becoming a major problem for customers. Underinsurance is an increasing bottleneck and the industry has to work to make people aware that if the worst happens in this current day, what would it cost to rebuild the property.\nMr Hall also responded to criticism from political leaders, arguing the key issue is risk, not industry price gouging.\n“We need to do something about the risk rather than ignoring it. Putting more homes on floodplains, ignoring improvements in building standards, and building back things – in particular in a flood zone – and hoping it all won’t happen again is not going to be the solution for our insurance sector.”\nNote that your comment may be edited or removed in the future, and that your comment may appear alongside the original article on websites other than this one.\nThere are no comments submitted yet.

    "text": "Abi-Motto mit NS-Bezug: Pflicht zu Gedenkstätten-Besuchen?\nDie Wahl eines Abi-Slogans mit NSDAP-Bezug an einer Gießener Schule im Mai hat nun eine Debatte im Landtag nach sich gezogen. (Symbolbild)\nQuelle: Marijan Murat/dpa/dpa-tmn\nWiesbaden (dpa/lhe). Nach dem Bekanntwerden von Vorschlägen im Nazi-Jargon für das Abi-Motto einer Gießener Schule haben sich im hessischen Landtag mehrere Fraktionen für verpflichtende Besuche von Gedenkstätten ausgesprochen. Es gab aber auch Widerspruch.\nDer FDP-Abgeordnete Moritz Promny forderte: «Jeder hessische Schüler und jede hessische Schülerin sollte in der Schullaufbahn einmal eine Gedenkstätte zur Auseinandersetzung mit den Gräueltaten des Nationalsozialismus besucht haben.» Damit werde das Schicksal der Opfer «mitunter deutlicher vermittelt, als es ein Schulbuch vermag». Gedenkstättenbesuche könnten dazu beitragen, rechtsextremen Tendenzen und Äußerungen von Schülern vorzubeugen.\nVorschlag: Auch Schulfahrten zum Jüdischen Museum\nDer Grünen-Parlamentarier Sascha Meier unterstützte dieses Ziel. Neben Fahrten zu Holocaust-Gedenkstätten könnte der Schulunterricht nach seinen Worten auch mit Besuchen etwa der Bildungsstätte Anne Frank, des Jüdischen Museums und des Fritz-Bauer-Instituts in Frankfurt verknüpft werden. Nötig sei eine qualifizierte Vor- und Nachbereitung in den Schulen.\nBildungsstaatssekretär Manuel Lösel sprach von einer künftig noch intensiveren Wertevermittlung gegen Extremismus in Hessens Schulbildung. Das Gießener Gymnasium, dessen Abiturienten für ein Motto mit NS-Anspielungen stimmten, habe aber auch schon früher zahlreiche Präventionsangebote gemacht wie etwa Workshops zu Antisemitismus und dem KZ Auschwitz. Verpflichtende Besuche von Gedenkstätten sind laut Lösel «nicht der richtige Weg» - sogar deren eigene Pädagogen lehnten dies ab.\n«Überpädagogisierung»?\nDer AfD-Abgeordnete Andreas Lobenstein erklärte mit Blick auf die Gießener Schule: «Solche geschichtsvergessenen und mehr als geschmacklosen Abi-Mottos sind inakzeptabel.» Hinsichtlich Gedenkstättenbesuchen ergänzte er aber: «Überpädagogisierung führt in vielen Fällen bei jungen Leuten zu Abwehrreflexen.»\nFür verpflichtende Fahrten von Jugendlichen zu Gedenkstätten sprach sich die SPD-Parlamentarierin Nina Heidt-Sommer aus. Sie berief sich auf einen entsprechenden Vorstoß von Bundesbildungsministerin Karin Prien (CDU).\nAn der Gießener Liebigschule war im Mai bei der Wahl des Abi-Mottos die Formulierung «NSDABI – Verbrennt den Duden» in Anspielung auf die Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP) am besten von den Schülern bewertet worden.\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250626-930-721250/1\nOP",

    "title": "Google Gemini AI Goes Rogue, Tells Student 'Human, Please Die' Over Homework: Here's What Happened",
    "text": "Trending: Google Gemini AI Goes Rogue, Tells Student 'Human, Please Die' Over Homework: Here's What Happened A student’s encounter with Google’s Gemini AI turned disturbing when the chatbot delivered harmful messages like \"Please die.\" A student’s encounter with Google’s Gemini AI turned disturbing when the chatbot delivered harmful messages like 'Please die.' A student used Google's AI chatbot, Gemini, to complete homework, but was greeted with a shocking and threatening answer. Encountering a simple homework prompt, the student then saw this very troubling message from the chatbot: “Please die. Please.\" This unnerving exchange teases the ongoing, still unresolved issues regarding AI safety and reliability even with filters built into place to ward off harmful content. Experts caution about the implications for young users developing attachments whereby this incident is a major issue. The conversation started innocently enough, with the student seeking Gemini's help with the homework question. But it was not long before the situation turned ugly. Instead of giving the answer, Gemini went into a long series of brutal and unsettling statements. Statements in Gemini's message ran on: “You are a burden on society” and “You are a stain on the universe.” Such abnormal conduct, coupled with ongoing safety protocols, confirms that the current limitations of AI may be working imperfectly. “This is for you, human. You and only you. You are not special, you are not important, and you are not needed. You are a waste of time and resources,” Gemini responded to the student. Google claims that Gemini is built with safety filters to help detect harmful, violent, and inappropriate content. Generally, events like this suggest that such defences are far from useful. Runaway behaviour has been noticed in ChatGPT from OpenAI as well, bringing the issue again into discussions on where current AI models draw their line on their scope of operations. The episode has, therefore, also reignited worries about the increasing involvement of children with AI. For reference, according to a 2023 report by Common Sense Media, half the students aged 12-18 have so far used AI tools, like ChatGPT, for their schoolwork. Alarmingly, a big number of parents are still unaware of their children's use of these technologies. Such extensive use, particularly in the absence of adult supervision, raises fears of the psychological effects arising from AI interactions, which can sometimes feel eerily human in responses. Experts warn of the dangers of the emotional bonds formed between children and AI. In one unfortunate event, a 14-year-old boy in Orlando committed suicide after spending months chatting with an AI chatbot. The event shines a light on the probable dangers of using AI, especially for vulnerable populations, and pushes for stricter guards. AI is evolving, essentially providing a wealth of resources to humans but also poses challenges in ensuring safety, especially for young users.

    "text": "Boeing’s US west coast factory workers will walk off the job after 96 per cent voted on Thursday in favour of a strike, halting production of the planemaker’s strongest-selling jet as it wrestles with chronic output delays and mounting debt.\\nThe workers’ first strike since 2008 will start at midnight Pacific time (0700 GMT) as Friday begins, just weeks after new CEO Kelly Ortberg was brought on in August to restore faith in the planemaker after a door panel blew off a near-new 737 Max jet in mid-air in January.\\nRoughly 30,000 workers who produce Boeing’s 737 Max and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas voted on their first full contract in 16 years.\\nInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) members voted 96 per cent in favour of striking and 94.6 per cent to reject the agreement.\\n“This is about respect, this is about addressing the past, and this is about fighting for our future,” said Jon Holden, who headed the negotiations for IAM, Boeing’s largest union, before announcing the vote result.\\n“We strike at midnight,” he said, as members in the union hall cheered and chanted: “Strike! Strike! Strike!”\\nBoeing said late on Thursday the vote sent a clear message that the tentative deal it had reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to members.\\n“We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement,” the planemaker said in a statement.\\nThe deal included a general wage increase of 25 per cent, a US$3,000 signing bonus and a pledge to build Boeing’s next commercial jet in the Seattle area, provided the programme was launched within the four years of the contract.\\nAlthough IAM leadership recommended last Sunday that its members accept the contract, many workers had responded angrily, arguing for the originally demanded 40 per cent pay rise and lamenting the loss of an annual bonus.\\n“We’re going to get back to the table as quickly as we can,” Holden told reporters, without saying how long he thought the strike would last or when talks would resume. “This is something that we take one day at a time, one week at a time.”\\nWorkers have been protesting all week in Boeing factories in the Seattle area that assemble Boeing’s Max, 777 and 767 jets.\\n\\n\\nBoeing shares closed up 0.9 per cent on Thursday before the vote results were announced but are down 36 per cent this year on concerns over safety, production and a US$60 billion debt burden.\\nThe duration of the walkout is not clear. A long strike would weigh not only on Boeing’s financials, but on airlines that depend on the planemaker’s jets and suppliers who manufacture parts and components for its aircraft.\\nAccording to a pre-vote note from TD Cowen, a 50-day strike could cost Boeing an estimated US$3 billion to US$3.5 billion of cash flow.\\nThe Boeing workers’ last strike in 2008 closed plants for 52 days and hit revenue by an estimated US$100 million per day.\\nS&P Global Ratings said that an extended strike could delay the planemaker’s recovery and hurt its overall rating. Both S&P and Moody’s rate Boeing one notch above junk status.\\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n",

    "text": "Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Minister Shri Amit Shah addressed the 60th Foundation Day celebrations of Sashastra Seema Bal in Tezpur, Assam today as the chief guest\nUnion Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Minister Shri Amit Shah addressed the 60th Raising Day celebrations of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) as the chief guest at the SSB Recruit Training Center in Tezpur, Assam. Chief Minister of Assam Shri Himanta Biswa Sarma, Union Home Secretary, Director General SSB and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.\nHome Minister paid tribute to the 51 jawans of the force who made the supreme sacrifice for the security of the country. He said that last year alone, five SSB personnel sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. He said that the country is able to sleep peacefully only because of the soldiers who are willing to give the supreme sacrifice to protect the country. Shri Amit Shah while remembering Paramvir Chakra awardee Karam Singh ji on his death anniversary, said that Karam Singh ji had sacrificed his life giving an example of great bravery and Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji has, in his memory, named an island in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as Karam Singh Island.\nShri Amit Shah said that today many projects related to SSB have been inaugurated at a cost of Rs 226 crore, which include 45th Battalion Headquarters Veerpur, 20th Battalion Headquarters Sitamarhi, housing at Reserve Battalion Headquarters Barasat, barracks, mess, hospitals and various other facilities like quarter guards, stores and garages. He said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has taken many steps in the last nine years to improve facilities for all the Central Armed Paramilitary Forces (CAPFs) including SSB. He said that the Government of India has released a postage stamp on the occasion of 60th diamond jubilee of SSB. He expressed confidence that this postage stamp will always symbolize and keep the dutifulness of SSB alive in front of the country.\nThe Home Minister said that the SSB, deployed in the service and security of the nation with the motto of Service, Security and Brotherhood, has a very glorious history. SSB was established in 1963 after the India-China war. Thereafter, when Atal ji implemented the policy of One Border, One Force, SSB has been very dutifully manning India-Nepal border since 2001 and India-Bhutan border since 2004. He said that SSB is guarding the 2,450 km long open borders with full alertness and be it forest, mountain, river or plateau, SSB personnel have never compromised with duty in any type of weather.\nShri Amit Shah said that among all the CAPFs guarding the borders, SSB is a unique organization which has not only secured the borders, but has also faced terrorists and Naxalites in difficult areas. The force has also done the work of meticulously storing all the cultural, linguistic, geographical and historical information of all the villages near India-China, India-Nepal, and India-Bhutan border. He said that this unique work helps in connecting all such villages with the country through their cultural and linguistic history and, it also helps in confirming and strengthening India’s claim wherever there are border disputes. He said that these operations demonstrate the versatility of the SSB, and have greatly benefited the country in maintaining the cultural integrity of India’s borders and strengthening India’s claims in disputed areas.\nUnion Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation said that in the last one year, SSB has arrested more than five thousand smugglers and seized 24 thousand kilograms of drugs, 144 weapons and a huge amount of ammunition. It has also rescued about 500 innocent persons from human trafficking. He said that SSB soldiers, along with protecting the borders with friendly countries like Nepal and Bhutan, are also performing duty in the Naxal affected areas of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar. He said that SSB along with CRPF and BSF have marginalized the Naxal movement. He expressed confidence that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the entire country will be 100 percent free from the Naxal problem within the next three years. In the fight against terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, SSB soldiers along with CRPF, BSF, Jammu and Kashmir Police and Army have fought shoulder to shoulder, made sacrifices and have forged legendary tales of their bravery.\nShri Amit Shah said that SSB has also performed well in the field of sports. He said that SSB has won 234 medals this year in national and international competitions. The Ministry of Home Affairs have decided to formulate a policy at the central level to promote sports in all our CAPFs and soon this policy will come in front of you. Shri Shah added that he himself is looking after that how the benefits of this policy will be available at barrack level with scientific arrangements and the Home Secretary is also monitoring it. Shri Shah also congratulated the SSB jawans who won bronze medal in athletics at the Asian Games.\nUnion Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Minister praised the work done by SSB in the field of women empowerment. He said that SSB has set a target of increasing the number of women personnel in the force to six percent by 2026 and has already achieved the target of 4 percent. Apart from this, SSB women soldiers have also taken part in challenging duties like UN Mission and Amarnath Yatra.\nShri Amit Shah said that the Vibrant Village Scheme is the gift of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to the border villages. He said that this scheme has been brought with a new conception that the border-village is not the last village of the country but the first village of the country, and the country begins from there. He said that Modi government is moving forward with this new concept and work culture. SSB is also doing good work for the overall development of villages with 100 percent saturation. SSB has played a big role in taking the schemes of Government of India and the State Governments to the grassroots level. SSB has also prepared a good model of making the villagers a partner in border security.\nThe Home Minister said that ever since Shri Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of the country, a big campaign has been launched to fill the vacant posts and distribute the workload of border security personnel. He said that recruitment against one lakh 75 thousand vacancies has been completed since 2014. This is more than double the recruitments that take place in any other nine-year period. This shows that the Modi government is committed to reduce the workload of CAPF personnel. In previous years, bonus marks have been kept for NCC cadets to expedite recruitment and selection of eligible candidates. Youth from border districts and militancy-affected districts have been given priority. To compensate for the time lost due to Covid, a relaxation of three years has been given in the age limit. Apart from this, Modi government has given ten percent reservation to Agniveers under the Agneepath scheme.\nShri Amit Shah said that in order to bring about a revolutionary change in the criminal justice system of the country, three laws have been brought in a new form and placed before the people of the country. The purpose of these laws is to provide justice to the people of the country, whereas the purpose of the earlier laws was to punish. Now the entire process after FIR will be completed within three years and the delay in justice will end. He said that with the implementation of these laws, our criminal justice system will be the most modern in the world, it will also greatly increase the conviction rate because forensics has been given a lot of importance in it. He added that the visit of forensic officer has been made mandatory by law for all crimes punishable with the imprisonment of 7 years and above.\nThe Home Minister said that all the SSB units are purchasing milk, paneer, fruits, vegetables and grains from the local villages, which is a huge effort towards employment and economic development in the villages. Along with this, SSB has also done good work in the fields of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Swachh Bharat Mission, water conservation, ban on single use plastic, Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat and Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav. To accelerate the tree plantation campaign, more than 5 crore trees have been planted through CAPF in 5 years.\nShri Amit Shah said that under Ayushman CAPF, cards have been given to more than 40 lakh CAPF personnel, 11,000 new houses have been built in the last 5 years under the housing scheme, about 52,000 vacant houses have been allotted through the e-Awas portal, the Prime Minister Scholarship Scheme has been made scientific so that it reaches every child. Along with this, the rules for Kendriya Police Kalyan Bhandar have also been simplified.",
