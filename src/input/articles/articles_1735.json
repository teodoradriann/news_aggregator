    "title": "‘Life is what you bake it’",
    "text": "USC Dornsife alumna Vallery Lomas says, ‘Life is what you bake it’\nWhen she was about 11, Vallery Lomas was sent to her grandmother’s house to learn a million-dollar family tradition.\nIt was a three-tiered, cream cheese-frosted, jelly-filled cake that was so rich, it’s been dubbed\n“Million Dollar Cake.” Her Grandma Willie Mae showed her how to neatly arrange the layers and smooth frosting over the sides.\nHer mother had selected Lomas out of all her siblings to learn this important family recipe. “My mom must have seen something in me before I did,” says Lomas.\nIt took a while for Lomas’ baking gene to fully emerge, however. After graduating from the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in 2007 with a degree in psychology, she completed a law degree from the USC Gould School of Law and practiced law for eight years.\nShe began baking as stress relief, then started a food blog before eventually winning the fourth season of the Great American Baking Show, part of the same franchise that produces the popular Great British Baking Show. She was the first Black winner in the franchise’s history.\nHer new cookbook,\nLife Is What You Bake It (Clarkson Potter, 2021), traces this path from lawyer to baker, and the ups and down along her career change — including the fact that her winning episode never aired.\n“There are stories in the book about my grandmother, the evolution of recipes, the\nHollywood handshake. Having that story-telling component was probably as important as the recipes for me,” says Lomas. “Pieces of me are in this book.”\nSouth to Southwest\nBoth Lomas and her sister Lucy (left) are double Trojans. (Photo: Courtesy of Vallery Lomas.)\nLomas grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Few people she knew left the South for college, but her sister Lucy did, enrolling as a biomedical engineering student at the\nUSC Viterbi School of Engineering.\nDuring her junior year in high school, Lomas flew out to Los Angeles to visit for a week. She stayed in Lucy’s dorm at\nSomerville Place, a residential floor at the University Park Campus where Black students are encouraged to find community. Opened in 1995, the housing is named after John and Vada Somerville, two of Los Angeles’ first Black dentists and graduates of the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC.\nBack home in Louisiana, Lomas didn’t have a particularly diverse friend group. Her weekend at USC, surrounded by a mix of Black and international students, was eye-opening. “I knew then and there that USC was where I wanted to go to school,” says Lomas. “I didn’t really apply to other colleges. I knew I was going to USC.”\nLomas enrolled first as a health and humanities major, thinking she might want to attend medical school. She also continued taking\nFrench, which she’d started studying in high school. A scholarship allowed her to spend a formative summer abroad in Dijon, France, where she realized her true passion did not lie in medical school but in exploring the world.\n“While I was still in Dijon, I went online and dropped all of my pre-med classes. I changed my major to psychology with a French minor,” says Lomas.\nSmile, you’re on camera\nAfter graduating from USC Dornsife, Lomas enrolled at the\nUSC Gould School of Law. Her sister, now a medical resident at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, shared an apartment with her.\nIt was a tough time for the Lomas sisters. Her sister had unexpectedly lost her fiancée. The 2008 recession had left the economy in a slump. Both were enrolled in intense career programs. Vallery wanted an outlet, so she turned to the rolling pin — a decision that benefited both women.\n“I could bake while my sister talked with me in the kitchen or, when she’d come home late from being on call, I’d leave something for her in the cake dome,” recalls Lomas.\nAfter finishing law school and moving to New York City in 2011, she took a job in privacy law. And she also spent nights and weekends photographing and writing about her bakes and recipes on a blog she dubbed “\nFoodie in New York.”.\nLomas also showcased her work on her @FoodieInNewYork\n“I had a lot of reservations about going on the show. I was working so hard to build up a reputation. I could do terribly and then there goes everything I’ve been building towards,” says Lomas. In the end, she decided it was a risk she was willing to take. “I was betting on myself,” she says.\nLomas excelled in the competition, acing the finale with a recipe for cream puffs that included lemon curd and ginger.\nIt was a triumph she never fully got to celebrate. One of the show’s judges was accused of sexual harassment, and ABC pulled the final episodes from broadcast.\nGlobal foodie\nBaking first helped Lomas relieve stress during law school, then turned into a successful career. (Photo: Linda Xiao.)\nIt was a major disappointment, but it sparked an important career change.\n“After the baking show got canceled, I was back at work and just burnt out. I knew I wanted to write a book, to talk about my experiences and how I felt. But I was going to work all day and I didn’t have the energy to write the proposal. So, I left my job,” says Lomas.\nShe asked a friend who’d recently published a book to put her in touch with some publishing contacts. Producing a book was no easy feat, even after many years of experience blogging and developing her recipes.\n“Cookbook publishing is historically not that friendly for Black people,” says Lomas. “I remember I looked at all the big cookbook publishers on my bookshelf and there were very few Black authors.”\nBut she persevered, eventually securing the book deal.\nFor Lomas, quitting her job to write a book was another risky bet on herself that came with rewards. Life is What You Bake It was named one of the best cookbooks of 2021 by the likes of The Washington Post and the Boston Globe.\nShe also was named an arts envoy for the United States Embassy in the West African nation of Benin, where she recently spent two weeks. Her French skills honed at USC Dornsife came in handy: “I’m pretty sure I was selected because I spoke French,” says Lomas.\nShe conducted cooking demonstrations on Benin public television shows, and she also found herself on the other side of the gavel, judging a baking competition. It’s the sort of work abroad that she’d envisioned back when she was an undergraduate studying in Dijon.\nDespite a somewhat circuitous path, it’s a fate that seems somewhat foretold. Before she left Dijon, her host family had gifted her a cookbook. “Another example of someone knowing something about me before I did,” she notes.",

The reason: the cathedral may be a target for Islamists.\nCologne - Shortly before the Christmas services, the police have increased security measures at Cologne Cathedral because of indications of a possible attack plan by an Islamist group. Police officers searched the cathedral with sniffer dogs on Saturday evening and announced that they would check all visitors on Christmas Eve. In Vienna, too, the police increased their protective measures. According to dpa information, security authorities had indications that a church in Vienna was also a possible target of the group. Previously, the \"Bild\" had reported.\nThe police in Cologne wanted to comment on the investigations in general on Sunday morning. At the same time, it was said that the authority would not comment on details because of the ongoing investigation.\nAccording to dpa information, the group could possibly have a connection to an offshoot of the terrorist network Islamic State (IS), which calls itself the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISPK) and has been fighting an armed conflict with the militant Islamist Taliban in Afghanistan for several years.\nAccording to \"Bild\", the first arrests by special forces in Vienna and also one in Germany were made on Saturday. The Directorate of State Security and Intelligence in the Austrian Ministry of the Interior did not want to comment on possible arrests. \"We ask for your understanding that we do not comment on current investigations,\" a spokesman in Vienna said late Saturday evening on request.\nThe Cologne police had justified the increase in their protective measures with a danger warning, without giving details. The State Security Service, which is active in politically motivated crimes, has begun investigations. Worshippers at Cologne Cathedral and tourists will have to adjust to increased security standards in the coming days.\n\"Even if the reference refers to New Year's Eve, we will already do everything this evening for the safety of the cathedral visitors on Christmas Eve. In coordination with the security officer of the cathedral chapter, the cathedral will be searched with sniffer dogs after the evening mass and then locked,\" said the head of the Cologne criminal police, Michael Esser, according to the statement. In the evening, police vehicles drove up in front of Cologne Cathedral, as dpa reporters observed. Police sniffer dogs were also deployed.\nA statement from the Vienna police said earlier that security authorities in Austria had increased their protective measures in the face of calls for terrorist attacks against Christian events across Europe, especially on Christmas Eve. Also due to a current risk assessment by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, there is generally an increased risk situation during the Christmas holidays, the police said. As a precautionary measure, there will be increased surveillance of endangered places in Vienna and in the provinces, including churches and Christmas markets.\nAccordingly, civilian and uniformed forces with special equipment and also rifles will be deployed. \"Police attention is mainly focused on churches and religious events, especially church services, and Christmas markets,\" the police said.\nMy news Warning for flooding in North Rhine-Westphalia – several cities affectedread more\nGovernment in North Rhine-Westphalia warns parents against reading Christmas presents\nSeveral railway lines in North Rhine-Westphalia will cease operation before Christmas.\nLuise (12) killed: Freudenberg shocked by wave of hatred – families of the perpetrators leave their place of residenceRead\nWhen bakeries are open on Christmas Eve in North Rhine-Westphaliaread\nShopping at Christmas in North Rhine-Westphalia: These opening hours apply to supermarkets read\nThe terror alert level in Austria is still elevated, the police said.

    "text": "IA vs. espacio y entretenimiento: la carrera de los unicornios\nLas startups de IA crecen a gran velocidad, atrayendo inversión y generando unicornios que redefinen la innovación tecnológica.\nEn el mundo de las startups, el término “unicornio” se refiere a aquellas empresas emergentes que, sin cotizar en bolsa, alcanzan una valoración de al menos mil millones de dólares. Este concepto fue acuñado en 2013 por la inversora Aileen Lee, fundadora de Cowboy Ventures, para destacar la rareza de tales empresas en el ecosistema empresarial.\nDesde entonces, la aparición de unicornios dejó de ser un fenómeno excepcional para convertirse en una tendencia en crecimiento. Estos abarcan una amplia gama de sectores, desde tecnología financiera (fintech) y comercio electrónico hasta inteligencia artificial (IA) y exploración espacial. Cada sector presenta características y desafíos únicos, pero en los últimos años, los unicornios de IA capturaron una atención especial debido a su rápido crecimiento y al impacto potencial de sus innovaciones.\nOpenAI, fundada en 2015, es un ejemplo emblemático de un unicornio de IA. Conocida por desarrollar modelos de lenguaje avanzados, como GPT-3, OpenAI revolucionó la forma en que interactuamos con la tecnología, permitiendo aplicaciones que van desde asistentes virtuales hasta herramientas de creación de contenido. Su enfoque en la investigación y desarrollo de IA atrajo inversiones significativas, elevando su valoración a niveles comparables con las principales empresas tecnológicas del mundo.\nOtro caso notable es Anthropic, una startup de IA que, a pesar de su juventud, se posicionó como líder en el desarrollo de sistemas de IA seguros y confiables. Su enfoque en la ética y la seguridad en la IA ha resonado en la comunidad inversora, reflejando preocupación por las implicaciones de estas tecnologías en la sociedad.\nSin embargo, los unicornios de IA no son los únicos que alcanzaron valoraciones impresionantes. Empresas como SpaceX, fundada por Elon Musk, revolucionaron la industria aeroespacial con sus cohetes reutilizables y sus ambiciosos planes de colonización de Marte. SpaceX logró contratos millonarios con agencias gubernamentales y atrajo inversiones privadas que la han llevado a ser una de las empresas más valiosas del mundo.\nEn el sector del entretenimiento, ByteDance, la compañía detrás de TikTok, experimentó un crecimiento meteórico. Fundada en 2012, ByteDance capitaliza la creciente demanda de contenido digital, convirtiéndose en una de las startups más valiosas a nivel global.\nEs importante destacar que, aunque los unicornios de IA describieron un notable crecimiento, aún existen diferencias en las valoraciones en comparación con unicornios de otros sectores. Por ejemplo, la diferencia entre las valoraciones de ByteDance y OpenAI es notable, lo que indica que, si bien la IA está en auge, otros sectores como el entretenimiento y la exploración espacial aún dominan en términos de valoración.\nEn cuanto a la distribución geográfica, la mayoría de los unicornios de IA más valiosos tienen su origen en Estados Unidos, lo que refleja el liderazgo del país en innovación tecnológica y desarrollo de IA. Sin embargo, también emergen startups de IA en otras regiones. Por ejemplo, DeepSeek, una empresa china fundada en 2023, irrumpió en el mercado con su modelo de IA eficiente y de bajo costo, el R1. Esta startup ganó popularidad, posicionándose como una de las aplicaciones más descargadas en plataformas móviles y desafiando a gigantes establecidos en el sector.\nEl auge de las startups de IA también influyó en las tendencias de inversión. En 2024, las startups de IA capturaron un récord del 46,4% del total de $209.000 millones de dólares recaudados en capital de riesgo en Estados Unidos. Este incremento refleja la creciente confianza de los inversores en el potencial transformador de la IA en diversas industrias.\nEn resumen, la IA dejó de ser una promesa futura para convertirse en una realidad presente que impulsa la creación de unicornios valorados. Aunque sectores como el aeroespacial y el entretenimiento lideran en valoraciónes, la rápida ascensión de las startups de IA indica una tendencia hacia la adopción masiva de tecnologías inteligentes. A medida que la IA se integra en múltiples aspectos de la vida cotidiana y empresarial, es probable que veamos un aumento en el número y la valoración de unicornios en este sector en los próximos años.\nLas cosas como son.\n*Mookie Tenembaum aborda temas de tecnología como este todas las semanas junto a Claudio Zuchovicki en su podcast La Inteligencia Artificial, Perspectivas Financieras, disponible en Spotify, Apple, YouTube y todas las plataformas.",
