    "title": "Arizona football notebook: Dino Babers reportedly hired as offensive coordinator, OL Robert Pulido withdraws from NCAA transfer portal - Top World News Today",
    "text": "When Dino Babers was part of Dick Tomey’s staffs at Arizona in the 1990s he was one of the hot young names in college football. Now, after three stints as a head coach, he’s coming back to Tucson to help an old colleague. Multiple reports, including GoAZCats.com , have Babers set to be hired as the Wildcats’ offensive coordinator, completing Brent Brennan’s first staff. He is expected to also coach Arizona’s quarterbacks. Babers, 61, spent the past eight seasons as head coach at Syracuse where had a 41-55 record with two bowl appearances including a 10-3 record in 2018. That teams averaged more than 40 points per game. He was also head coach at Bowling Green (2014-15) and Eastern Illinois (2012-13), compiling an overall 78-71 record. Babers was previously at Arizona from 1995-2000, coaching wide receivers the first two years and running backs the third before serving as offensive coordinator from 1998-2000. Brennan was a GA on that 2000 squad, while new UA wide receivers coach Bobby Wade was on his way to becoming the school’s career receiving leader. Once Babers is officially announced it will complete Brennan’s staff, as two other coaches were introduced Thursday: special teams coordinator/linebackers coach Danny Gonzales and cornerbacks coach Chip Viney. All others were announced Tuesday and Wednesday . Gonzales was head coach at New Mexico from 2020-23 and has also been a defensive coordinator at ASU and San Diego State, while Viney was Brennan’s defensive backs coach at San Jose the previous two seasons. One of the first Arizona players to enter the NCAA transfer portal after Jedd Fisch’s departure was offensive lineman Robert Pulido, and it seemed like just a matter of time before he’d head to Washington to re-unite with offensive line coach Brennan Carroll. Instead, he’s coming back to Tucson. Pulido has withdrawn from the portal , giving the Wildcats four returning starters on the line for new offensive line coach Josh Oglesby. The 6-foot-6, 335-pound Pulido started five games in 2023 as a true freshman, including the final four. He started four times at right guard and started the Alamo Bowl at left tackle, where he is expected to play in 2024. A bicycle accident shortly before the season opener last September kept Pulido from starting from the outset, and after coming back for one game he missed four more due to injury. Pulido is the fourth different UA player to enter the portal but ultimately return to the program. The others are quarterback Brayden Dorman and tight ends Dorian Thomas and Keyan Burnett. With his return Arizona’s line for 2024 could look like this: Pulido, left guard Wendell Moe, center Josh Baker, right guard Leif Magnuson and right tackle Jonah Savaiinaea. Joe Borjon also has starting experience at guard and tackle and JT Hand started a game in 2021. While Pulido came out, a few more Arizona players entered the portal on Wednesday. If neither return it means the Wildcats’ ultra deep defensive line will need some major reinforcements. Edge rushers Russell Davis II and Isaiah Ward are in the portal, doing so after combining for 46 tackles (10.5 for loss) and 7.5 sacks in 2023. Ward started 10 games last season while Davis was a key part of the defensive rotation up front. Arizona already lost edges Taylor Upshaw and Jeremy Mercier and defensive tackles Tyler Manoa and Sio Nofoagatoto’a to graduation, while defensive linemen Jacob Kongaika and Tia Savea entered the portal. As of now, the front four player on the roster with the most defensive snaps in 2023 is edge Ta’ita’i Uiagalelei, who saw about 40 percent of the action and has six career starts. At a special meeting Thursday in Tempe, the Arizona Board of Regents formally approved Brennan’s 5-year contract. He will earn an average of $3.62 million per season including $200,000 annually from Nike and Learfield, the UA’s broadcast partner. Brennan’s contract also calls for a $250,000 retention bonus if he’s still at Arizona at the end of January in 2026, and he can earn up to $1.2 million in performance and academic bonuses. The contract buyout is $10 million if Brennan leaves during his first year, $7 million during the second year and down to $500,000 during the fifth year. He gets 100 percent of what he’s owed if fired without cause during the first two seasons, down to 70 percent at any time over the final three years.

    "text": "As you approach retirement, a threat, known as the “sequence of returns” risk could jeopardize your portfolio. The issue stems from poor investment returns paired with withdrawals, particularly earlier in retirement, which can shrink your nest egg over time. However, you can minimize the risk via portfolio diversification, fixed-income allocations and flexible withdrawals. As their retirement nears , investors need to be aware of a threat known as the “ sequence of returns risk ” which could jeopardize their retirement nest egg.\nWhile this risk is often an overlooked and misunderstood problem for retirees, there are ways to minimize its negative impact, experts say.\nAlso called “sequence risk,” the issue stems from poor investment returns paired with withdrawals , particularly earlier in retirement. The combo can shrink your nest egg over time.\nThose early retirement years’ investment returns and withdrawal timing can “make or break the next 30 years,” warned certified financial planner Collin Lyon, wealth strategy advisor at Anderson Financial Strategies in Dayton, Ohio.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nA U.S. construction boom is sending rents lower and creating perks for renters\nSome experts have raised the odds of a recession. Here’s how much cash you need\nDesigner dupe demand soars, a sign of the economic times\nHow sequence risk hurts your portfolio Investors can typically start withdrawing funds from retirement accounts without penalty at age 59½.\nBut there’s a big risk for younger retirees or near-retirees who experience stock market downturns just before or as they start tapping accounts.\nWithdrawing from your portfolio when the stock market drops could mean selling more assets for the same amount of cash. As a result, you’re left with fewer investments to capture future growth when the market rebounds .\nIt’s the biggest issue for younger retirees with decades of living expenses to cover from their nest egg, experts say.\nHere are some ways to mitigate your sequence of returns risk, according to financial advisors.\nDiversify your portfolio As retirement approaches, it’s important to adjust portfolio allocations from heavy concentrations in higher-risk assets to less volatile investments like bonds, experts say. The right mix may depend on several factors, including your risk tolerance, goals and life expectancy.\n“Diversification among several different asset classes can help make volatility less pronounced,” Lyon said.\nBuild a ‘war chest’ to fund living expenses You can avoid selling assets in a down market by keeping a six-month emergency fund and a “war chest” to cover living expenses, according to CFP Jonathan Bednar II, a wealth advisor at Paradigm Wealth Partners in Knoxville, Tennessee.\nFor Bednar’s clients, the war chest includes five years of expenses in fixed-income assets — typically in a bond or certificate of deposit ladder — so retirees can “weather any market volatility,” when the sequence risk is highest, he said.\nOpt for a flexible withdrawal rate Flexible withdrawals are another way to safeguard your portfolio from sequence risk, experts say.\n“Instead of withdrawing a fixed percentage, the rate can be adjusted based on market performance,” explained Orlando-based CFP Brad Brescia with Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo.\nReducing withdrawals during years of negative returns “can help preserve the portfolio’s core,” he added. However, some retirement accounts eventually have required withdrawals .",

    "text": "TYLER, Texas — This blast of cold weather has all of us bundling up with our homeless neighbors turning to local shelters for a place to stay warm. Some shelters across East Texas are already reaching their capacity. Last year the [Salvation Army](https://www.facebook.com/SalvationArmyTyler/) in Tyler had about 40,000 people seek shelter and are expecting for that number to exceed this year. Case Management Supervisor, Indus Mcduff, said they’re currently seeing about 120 people per day. The facility currently has 200 beds. \"Once the temps are below 40 degrees, we allow people who may normally not be able to stay in a shelter, we do allow them to come in out of the cold and sleep,\" Mcduff said. It’s the same scenario in Longview at the Hiway 80 Rescue Mission Center. They’re reaching capacity every night with over a hundred people using their beds; while feeding close to 400 people a day. \"We have had to increase our capacity in inclement weather. And that kind of puts a strain on resources a little bit,\" case manager at Hiway 80, Juan Davis said. Davis said the biggest contributor to the influx of people is inflation. \"Price of housing has went up 26% In the last year, and there are over 2000 homes that are sitting empty because people can't afford to live in them,\" Davis said. Both shelters say donations from the public really go a long way, especially during the holidays. \"A lot of people are struggling themselves and for them to take from what little they have to give to us is very much appreciate it,\" Mcduff said. Donations for food and winter items are still greatly needed as they expect the demand to increase.",
