    "text": "By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Bassam Masoud\nCAIRO/GAZA (Reuters) – Israeli forces attacked areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip where residents have been expecting a renewed ground offensive in areas crammed with tens of thousands of Palestinians already displaced by the Israeli-Hamas war.\nWith nightfall on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the southern city of Khan Younis killed eight Palestinians, health officials said. Three Palestinians were killed and six injured in an Israeli missile strike on a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent said.\n“The task here is to dismantle Hamas – so that it no longer has military and governing capabilities,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said at a press briefing on operations in Khan Younis. “We will be required to show a lot of perseverance and determination.”\nA Palestinian journalist posted pictures of Israeli tanks near a mosque in a built-up area of Bureij in central Gaza.\nThe Islamist group Hamas released video it said showed its fighters targeting Israeli tanks and soldiers east of Bureij. Reuters was not able to verify the location or the date the video was filmed.\n“That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,” said Omar, 60, who said he had been forced to move with at least 35 family members. He declined to give his surname for fear of reprisals.\nYamen Hamad has been living in a school in Deir al-Balah, also in central Gaza, since fleeing from the north. He said people newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nIn one of Israel’s latest airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. Their bombed building was housing displaced civilians, according to local medics and residents.\nSEARCHING THROUGH RUBBLE\nReuters video showed rescuers scrabbling frantically through rubble to uncover and pull out victims including a baby and several children and rushing them through milling crowds of dazed and weeping people to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital.\nPalestinian health authorities said earlier that 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 – nearly 1% of Gaza’s population. Thousands more dead were feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nOver the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nHamas and its fighters are dug deep into the Gaza Strip’s dense cities and towns and their leaders are still at large.\nIsrael has reported 169 of its soldiers killed in its Gaza campaign after Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.\nSome 110 hostages were freed during a Nov. 24-Dec. 1 humanitarian pause and more than 20 others have been declared dead.\nU.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Hamas killed an American hostage, Judith Weinstein, 70, on Oct. 7. Last week he said her husband Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on the same day.\nThe Israeli military released findings of an investigation into the killings in error by its troops of three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Dec. 15. Soldiers mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding.\nEGYPT’S PLAN TO END CONFLICT\nEgypt confirmed on Thursday that it had put forward a framework proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip that includes three stages ending with a ceasefire and said it was awaiting responses on the plan.\nThe proposal is an attempt “to bring viewpoints between all concerned parties closer, in an effort to stop Palestinian bloodshed and the aggression against the Gaza Strip and restore peace and stability to the region,” Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt’s State Information Service, said in a statement.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will keep some form of security control of all Gaza indefinitely, though he insists that this would not amount to reoccupying the enclave.\n(Reporting by Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo, Bassam Masoud in Gaza and Emily Rose in Jerusalem; writing by Grant McCool; editing by Howard Goller)",

    "text": "A new state law will go into effect in February that will require anyone with a minor in their home to store their firearms safely. If a child gets a hold of a gun and kills themselves or others, the gun owner could be charged with a felony. With that in mind, a Detroit man is on a mission to provide families with the right tools to keep their guns secured and kids safe. William McMurray is the owner of The American RAC, a gun storage device he invented years ago. The RAC is secured to a wall and stores a gun under lock and key. “I am passionate about children not getting ahold of guns,” said McMurray. “Every time that it happens, I feel that I failed to reach that family.” On Wednesday, McMurray and his daughter installed the RAC tool inside the home of the Broadnax family. “We’re installing these because we just don’t want to hear about any more kids finding guns,” McMurray added. “We just don’t want to hear that the RAC could have been the guardian between the gun and a child.” Angel Broadnax has been a gun owner for a little over a year. She says she contacted McMurray about getting the RAC device because she wanted a more secure way to store her gun. “It piqued my interest because it was so different from a standard safety box which the safety box can be moved around,” said Broadnax. According to Everytown Research and Policy , 16 children in Michigan have been injured or killed due to accidental shootings. Most of the shootings have happened in the metro Detroit area. “It’s heartbreaking and it would eat me up if that were one of my kids so it just can’t ever be one of my kids,” Broadnax added. Meanwhile, McMurray says it doesn’t matter if gun owners have a RAC device, gun lock or safety boxes as long as they secure their guns. “Use something to keep the firearms from being able to be accessed by children,” said McMurry. “That’s really my passion, it came from my friend Adonis Tillman finding a shotgun… he died as a result of playing with a shotgun.” McMurray is offering free RAC installations.

    "text": "“Robinson Canó viene a ganar un campeonato”, Jorge Del Valle, vicepresidente de Diablos Tras la presentación de [Robinson Canó](https://www.record.com.mx/beisbol/diablos-rojos-presenta-a-robinson-cano-no-habia-visto-ese-interes-en-mi) con los [Diablos Rojos del México](https://www.record.com.mx/beisbol), Jorge Del Valle, vicepresidente deportivo del equipo escarlata, aseguró que el expelotero de [Yankees](https://www.record.com.mx/beisbol) llega para ganar un título de Liga Mexicana de Béisbol. En una plática con RÉCORD, el directivo de los Pingos señaló que la expectativa en torno al pelotero dominicano es una: ganar títulos. Y es que desde 2014, los Diablos no han logrado coronarse en el circuito veraniego, por lo que la llegada de Canó eleve aún más lo planteado. “El viene a ganar un campeonato, eso es lo que lo enamoró de este proyecto. Un equipo ganador, un equipo importante, al cual el quiere ayudar a ganar un campeonato”, expresó Jorge Del Valle. Con la firma de Robinson, el directivo escarlata señaló que el golpe mediático era lo más importante. Posteriormente, era ver el área de oportunidad dentro de los Rojos, por lo que Canó era el pelotero ideal para ayudar a los Diablos a llegar nuevamente a la cima. “Lo primero que queríamos era dar un bombazo en el mercado; ese era el principal objetivo. Queremos ser protagonistas en todos los sentidos y eso era lo principal. Lo segundo era encontrar que posición fortalecer. Yo creo que todas las posiciones siempre se pueden fortalecer. Más allá de eso, era encontrar un liderazgo positivo”, comentó. Con esta llegada y la serie de Yankees a la vista, Del Valle aseguró que se trata de disfrutar cada etapa de la temporada para poder llegar a lo más alto de la Liga Mexicana de Béisbol. Asimismo, comentó que abrir la campaña de LMB contra Pericos de Puebla es importante, pues es una manera de reponerse a lo sucedido el año pasado, donde fueron eliminados en Serie de Zona por dicha novena. “Principalmente, tenemos que disfrutar lo que viene ya en próximos días que son los juegos contra Yankees, algo histórico y nos vamos a ir etapa etapa. Después de eso hay que pensar el día 11 o 12 contra Pericos de Puebla. Para nosotros tiene un tinte especial porque queremos al final del día salir adelante después de lo vivido el año pasado, y después de eso juego a juego y día a día. Para poder ser campeones hay que llegar lo mejor posible a playoffs y de ahí vendrá el tema del campeonato”, sentenció.

Offbeat Edited by Bhavya Sukheja Updated: August 30, 2024 8:07 am IST Redditors weighed in on the passenger's situation with their own thoughts. (Representational)\nWhen travelling on a plane, passengers should follow some basic etiquette and do their best to accommodate and not disturb or trouble anyone seated around them. However, recently a plane passenger was left appalled after a couple changed their baby's dirty diaper at their seats on board a Delta flight. In a Reddit post shared to the popular \"r/delta\" subreddit, the passenger detailed the inflight incident. \"The people in the row in front of me are changing a poopy diaper in their seats,\" the plane passenger wrote.\n\"Anyone ever experienced this? The smell is horrendous. There's no reason not to do this in the bathroom,\" they added. In the comments section, the passenger also said that the stench was so offensive that they \"moved back a couple of rows to an empty seat\". Fortunately, a flight attendant came to the rescue shortly thereafter. \"The FA noticed I had moved and asked why so I explained. She was mortified and thanked me for telling her,\" the traveller recalled.\n\"She told the father it was unsanitary and he needed to do that in the bathroom and thankfully he just said ok and didn't throw a fit,\" the passenger further stated.\nChanging a kid's poop diaper in seat\nby u/Jolly-Armadillo-2572 in delta The post shared just a few days back quickly sparked a discussion in the comments section. Redditors weighed in on the passenger's situation with their own thoughts. Nearly 700 people reacted to the traveller's account, with some 400 people writing individual comments about it. Many pointed out that the parents' actions were unsanitary.\nAlso Read | \"Down To Last Few Thousands\": Ankur Warikoo Shares Poignant Story Of Father's Job Loss And Stolen Savings\n\"Thank you for the reminder to bring sanitizing wipes on all flights!\" wrote one user. \"Experienced this on a night flight. The smell literally woke everybody up. The FA came yelling at the mom telling her she needs to go to the bathroom. But the damage was already done and it took some time to get rid of the smell,\" shared another.\n\"I'm not even remotely surprised. I saw a mother change her baby on a food court table in a mall once.

Or other self-approved smelly-good stuff. Essential oils work great too, but can be messy,\" suggested a fourth Redditor.\n\"This is definitely a biohazard, especially if the child is having intentional issues. Glad you let the FA know so they can address it,\" commented another.\nClick for more trending news",

    "text": "Jonny Johnston, 45, went to bed before realising the next day he had won\nA supermarket delivery driver got an early Christmas present – after scooping £3.8million on the lottery.\nJonny Johnston, 45, had just finished his rounds for Tesco when he spotted an email announcing ‘good news about your ticket’.\nAssuming he had won a lucky dip, the father of three went to bed and it was only when he checked his phone the next day that he realised he had become a millionaire overnight.\nBut the down-to-earth supermarket worker kept his news a secret for a week, even completing a click and collect shift at his local store, handing out bags of turkey and trimmings to customers in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, on Saturday, before news of his win spread.\nMr Johnston, who has never been abroad in his life, now plans to take his partner of 25 years, Christina, and their three children, aged 19, 20 and 23, on holiday together for the first time.\nJonny Johnston and his partner Christina Williams celebrate at the Culloden Estate & Spa Hotel in Belfast after winning £3.8million on the Lotto draw\nThe father went to bed and it was only when he checked his phone the next day that he realised he had become a millionaire overnight\nThe supermarket worker then kept his amazing news a secret for a week\nHe said: ‘I’m still in disbelief. This is a dream come true for me and my family. I’ve always worked hard, and this win will allow us to do things we could only ever have dreamt of before. I would love for us all to go to the Caribbean, maybe on a cruise as it sounds and looks incredible. We have never had a family holiday together. I just need to apply for my passport first.’\nMr Johnson has played the lottery with the same numbers for more than 20 years. Three weeks ago, however, he matched two numbers and won an additional Lucky Dip for the Lotto draw on Saturday December 16. It was the free Lucky Dip line, with numbers 4, 12, 23, 30, 50 and 56, which proved to be the winner.\nReferring to the moment he realised he had won, Mr Johnston said: ‘I was sitting on the edge of the bed on Sunday morning trying to make sense of what I was seeing. I just kept staring at the numbers on my account. I thought maybe I had won £38,000 but then there were too many zeros. I passed the phone to Christina for her to check and she was in disbelief too. We both began to think that it was a trick, a scam even. We decided we had better call Camelot and double-check.’\nMr Johnson has played the lottery with the same numbers for more than 20 years\nReferring to the moment he realised he had won, Mr Johnston said: ‘I was sitting on the edge of the bed on Sunday morning trying to make sense of what I was seeing’\nMr Johnston said both him and Christina were in disbelief when they first found out the news\nOnly when the National Lottery confirmed the win did the couple break the news to their children.\n‘The kids were silent at first, looking at both of us in disbelief,’ Mr Johnston added. ‘Then the screaming and shouting started, everyone was jumping around the kitchen, cheering. Seeing as it was still early, we popped the kettle on and toasted the amazing news with a cup of coffee.’\nMr Johnston said he also had his eye on a vintage car and may also buy a new tractor for one of his sons, who works on a farm.\n‘I am incredibly grateful and still trying to wrap my head around it all,’ he said.",
