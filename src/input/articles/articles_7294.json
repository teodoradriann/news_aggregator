    "text": "Completing a well-rounded education is difficult enough as a young adult, let alone doing so later in life. Nonetheless, Glendive resident Robert Worthington, 57, is yet another step closer to fulfilling his lifelong dream of becoming an attorney.\nWorthington officially kicked off his journey to the legal sector in 2022 when he graduated with an associate's degree from Eastern Gateway Community College's Paralegal Program.\nAlthough getting started later than most legal pupils, the profession is not entirely absent from Worthington's life.\nHe explained his late uncle was a judge in Germany for more than 20 years and helped teach the eastern part of the European country western German law after the Berlin Wall came down. His German cousin, the son of his uncle who sat as a judge, also currently serves in the country as an attorney.\nVisiting them every two years growing up, it was Worthington's uncle who planted the idea that he may one day have what it takes to work as an attorney.\n\"My uncle is the one who saw the potential of me being in law when I was just 13,\" Worthington said, adding he recalls spouting legalese and pounding his uncle's gavel as if he were Perry Mason from the hit TV drama.\nAfter 15 years of military service and several more years living and working in Glendive, Worthington ultimately decided he would make good on the promise he made to his uncle; to look into and go through law school.\n\"I decided it was time I did something for myself,\" Worthington said. \"When I got through (the paralegal program), it ignited a fire of this is what I've got to do.\"\nSince graduating the paralegal program at EGCC in 2022, Worthington also obtained a second associate's degree in criminal justice before graduating with a bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice from Youngstown State University earlier this month. More than that, he was able to complete the four-year degree in just two semesters due to previously having more than 220 credit hours.\nWorthington is currently working with the Law School Admission Council in taking the LSA Test and applying to at least five different law schools. He will take the LSAT in April of 2025 and hopes to be enrolled and starting law school by the fall next year.\nAt this time, Worthington is most interesting in focusing his practice in family and Native American law, but realizes that could change in the future once he is in the middle of law school.\nHe added his sights are mainly on family law due to some personal experience as well as observing the effects different cases involving families can have on each individual person involved.\nNonetheless, he believes he could be an asset to Glendive by adding another attorney to the few practicing in eastern Montana.\n\"I think Glendive needs lawyers,\" Worthington said.\nUnderstanding his feat to become an attorney later in life is a bit abnormal in society, Worthington knows it is not impossible. He noted some people even start the long journey as late as 65 years old.\nNo matter when he gets it done, he is determined to see the process through and make a reality of what was once just a pipe dream.\n\"It's more about fulfilling a dream and then putting that dream into action,\" Worthington said.\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters Brendan Heidner can be reached at bheidner@rangerreview.com\n(0 Ratings)",

    "text": "Southern California, particularly the San Diego area, has already been beset with more than its fair share of problems. Illegal aliens are flooding the region, homelessness is out of control, and crime has been on the rise. The police in both San Diego and Los Angeles have had their hands full. But if one gun control group has its way, the cops' hands will be a bit more empty if they don't have any guns. CBS News just concluded a two-year study into how the police buy their firearms and how they dispose of them when they reach the end of their service life. They found that some of the old guns the police sold were later found at crime scenes. Further, they investigated the gun companies that sell firearms to the police and determined that some of them have been cited for violations when they improperly sold weapons or ammunition. Now, San Diego is considering a law that would ban the police from doing business with those companies.\nAdvertisement After a two-year KCAL News Investigation uncovered serious concerns about police selling their old weapons, a new case study has brought a new light to where agencies buy their new guns.\nTaxpayers are actually the biggest gun buyers in the country, purchasing $5 billion worth of guns a year for police agencies. Millions of taxpayer dollars are going to dealers who, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives claims have violated gun laws.\nThis issue has convinced one Southern Californian city to become the first in the country to try and stop it. Brady, the largest and oldest anti-gun violence group in the country, conducted a case study on LC Action.\nThese sound like some rather crazy complaints from people who were just looking for an excuse to cause trouble for the cops. As far as the police selling their old weapons goes, that's a common practice all over the country. The sales help replenish their budget so they can afford replacements. Everyone who seeks to purchase one is subjected to the same background check that shoppers go through at a gun store. Sometimes, after a weapon is sold, the new owner may decide to resell it. Or it could be stolen from their home or vehicle, eventually winding up at a crime scene. The police are not \"arming the criminals\" or selling firearms to felons. (If some of them are, they need to be arrested themselves.)\nThe companies selling firearms to these police departments are LC Action Police Supply and Adamson Police Products . Both are reputable companies that supply equipment to law enforcement, while also serving the general public. And they do a lot of business. LC Action has sold more than $18 million worth of goods to 67 law enforcement agencies just since 2015, not counting all of their sales to the public. Like all gun stores, they have to have their sales records reviewed on a regular basis. When an error in a sale is discovered, the incident is recorded and the company is charged with a fine. CBS found a grand total of 40 such incidents at LC Action since 1995. Forty incidents in nearly thirty years sounds like a pretty good record to me.\nAdvertisement Adamson Police Products is similarly situated in the market. They do a somewhat smaller volume of business with law enforcement, though it still adds up to millions of dollars. The investigation revealed that they had received roughly a dozen similar citations since 2011. That works out to fewer than one per year. CBS and San Diego are making it sound like the stores are running some sort of criminal racket, but their records are actually quite solid.\nThis entire scheme was cooked up between the San Diego City Council and the Brady : United Against Gun Violence gun control group. They haven't succeeded in repealing the Second Amendment or completely outlawing firearms yet (though they are trying), so they probably see this as the next best thing. By bringing public pressure on gun shops that supply police departments, they are most likely trying to make it more difficult or at least more expensive for the police to obtain firearms. Never mind the fact that the police, even in California, are the ones who are taking illegal firearms off the streets every single week at great risk to themselves. These people have never seen a firearm they didn't hate and they always prefer to blame the police rather than the criminals. You can probably expect to see even more police officers pulling the plug and making the move to red states where they will be more appreciated and better funded and equipped.",

    "text": "Ante el incremento de accidentes vehiculares entre motocicletas y automóviles, el Ayuntamiento de Tampico impondrá una mayor vigilancia por medio de una presencia estrecha de elementos de seguridad en cada crucero y avenida importante, así lo dio a conocer el regidor Edgar Treviño Martínez. El funcionario destacó que las colisiones suceden cuando los conductores no respetan los límites de velocidad, por lo que se buscará que los elementos de Vialidad estén en el lugar correcto para hacer cumplir el Reglamento de Tránsito. Advirtió que los choferes deben ser igualmente responsables al momento de manejar las unidades, para no ser parte de estas estadísticas fatales.

Piden la cooperación de los motociclistas para evitar daños El funcionario recordó que la institución realizó una campaña para exhortar a la gente a moderar su velocidad en los automotores, pero al final el asunto depende tanto de las autoridades como de los conductores. \"Hay que trabajarlo juntos sociedad y gobierno, respetando el índice de velocidad, el Reglamento de Tránsito y siendo responsables al momento de manejar\", completó. Finalmente, llamó a los todos los coferes a tomar su tiempo para no andar a las prisas o con retardos que vengan a provocar accidentes en la ciudad o cerca de donde se ubican los planteles educativos.",

    "text": "El Salvador's San Sebastian river has no fish. The runoff from a gold mine upstream, already shuttered two decades ago, has long killed them all.\nNow, residents fear the same fate for other rivers -- and the creatures and people depending on them -- after Congress, at President Nayib Bukele's request, reversed a ban on metal mining.\nBukele billed the move as a way of invigorating the Central American country's stagnant economy, but environmentalists and river-side communities fear the potential harms far outweigh any benefits.\nIn the community of Santa Rosa de Lima, a two-hour drive from the capital San Salvador, wastewater still flows directly into the San Sebastian river from a nearby hill where a gold mine operated for 100 years until 2006.\nThe site is still being illegally exploited by artisanal gold miners.\nOn a recent expedition to survey the river with a group of environmentalists, community leader Graciela Funes took a sample of the water and shook her head as she examined its unnatural copper color.\n\"We cannot allow this situation... We are human and we all need this vital liquid,\" the 67-year-old told AFP.",
