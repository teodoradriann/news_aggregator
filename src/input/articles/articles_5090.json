    "text": "Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk said, \"I just officially bought Amazon.\" Claim: Rating: About this rating False\nA rumor claiming tech entrepreneur Elon Musk said he bought Amazon — the retail, media and technology company founded by fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos — circulated online in late 2024. According to social media posts and YouTube videos, Musk supposedly said, \"I just officially bought Amazon.\"\nFor example, on Nov. 15, 2024, a manager of the Elon Musk Rewind YouTube channel — a long-running channel with over 366,000 subscribers frequently publishing content about Musk — uploaded a video displaying the title, \"Elon Musk Just BOUGHT Amazon & Ends All Competition!\" As of Nov. 18, the clip had received numerous shares on X and at least tens of thousands of views, according to information provided by the Nepal-based Gazette Direct website.\nAs of Nov. 21, the link for the video showed the message, \"This video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated.\" Google or YouTube suspended the Elon…\nJordan Liles",

If conditions do not improve, declaration of a Drought Warning or a Drought Emergency with mandatory water use restrictions may become necessary.",

    "text": "Light to the world: Church Moderator reflects on the season of Epiphany Published on 29 December 2023 2 minutes read In this article, which first appeared in the January 2024 edition of [Life and Work](https://www.lifeandwork.org/), Rt Rev Sally Foster-Fulton reflects on the powerful message of the season of Epiphany. Strange that when we are in the time of deepest darkness, we begin to celebrate the light. In Scotland, the shortest day was December 21, when the sunrise spilled out at 8.45am and sunset swept over us at 3.30pm. Since then, the light has been edging its way back - slowly and determinedly, it stretches out its shine. We are entering the season of Epiphany – the season of light. January 6 marks Epiphany, and the church celebrates the visit of the Wise Ones who followed the starshine. We hold wisdom and light together, a beautiful synthesis of imagery! I cannot think of a more powerful season to participate in today and I call us into it. Epiphany – the coming of the light into the darkness. Epiphany – the coming of wisdom into our most fear-filled, narrowminded and hard-hearted spaces. And poignant, that as we see around us so much pain, we hold to the promise. As I write this article, a truce has been agreed between Israel and Hamas that will see a four-day pause in violence and the release of hostages and prisoners on both sides of the conflict. I pray that this moment of wisdom and restraint will bring lasting light. As I write this article, the UK government is set to announce its autumn statement. I pray for decisions that bring light and relief to those struggling with a cost of living crisis that is crippling, and for policies that live out our call to care for the most vulnerable, and pay people fairly when they care for our neighbours and loved ones. As I write this article, climate chaos continues to cause misery across the world, with those who have least to do with it suffering most and first. COP28 offers another opportunity for the world to come together and see sense, but the window is closing. I pray for decisions that call those of us who have benefitted on the back of the rest of the world to account. We must turn in a different direction quickly if wisdom and light are to have a chance. As we walk together into the new year, let us bring the light. We celebrate the coming of wisdom. It sets you on a journey, compels you to offer gifts, takes you home a different way. We celebrate the coming of wisdom. It compels you to heed dreams, to see strength in vulnerability...what could be more vulnerable than a homeless baby? We are part of the body of Christ, the family of God, and we are called to be light to the world. Shine, then – shine where you are. We are part of the Word made flesh – live then – live seeking and sharing the daring wisdom of love, hope, justice and forgiveness. As we walk into 2024, let the Prince of Peace lead us.

Non solo il ministro dell?Agricoltura dimostra di non avere alcuna consapevolezza di cosa significhi essere un?isola e di quali sono le difficoltà quotidiane di chi abita la Regione. Ma rivela il totale disinteresse del governo Meloni per la nostra Sicilia, dove vivono circa 5 milioni di cittadine e cittadini. A loro dovrebbe rivolgere al più presto le proprie scuse.

Così Antonio Nicita, senatore Pd e candidato alle europee nella circoscrizione Isole.\n?Sottolineando che ?per fortuna? la siccità quest?anno colpirà più il Sud – e in particolare la Sicilia – rispetto al Nord, il ministro non ha commesso alcuna gaffe, ma espresso una vera e propria dichiarazione di intenti della maggioranza: spaccare a metà il Paese, penalizzare il Sud-Italia, fare la guerra ai più fragili. Niente di più di quanto già previsto nello squallido progetto di autonomia differenziata realizzato da Calderoli su mandato di Salvini. È vergognoso?.",

    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – Placed in almost any other time in baseball history, Ezequiel Tovar would be a unicorn.\nExisting right now, in an unprecedented wave of young shortstops, the Rockies’ 23-year-old standout is simply part of a herd of mythical creatures.\nLast year saw seven shortstops, age 24 or younger on Opening Day, accrue 3.5 or more Wins Above Replacement (as measured by Baseball-Reference).\nNo year in the game’s history can match that number.\n“The position’s very deep,” Tovar told The Gazette through interpreter Edwin Perez. “It’s a beautiful position to play.\n“There’s a lot of good shortstops out there. It’s like every position, we all have a good, healthy competition with the whole league. We just want to help our team, make an effort and contribute to success.”\nTovar won a Gold Glove last year, led the National League with 45 doubles and hit 26 home runs.\nHe also became the first Rockies hitter to strike out 200 times in a season, but that came in a league-high 655 at-bats.\nWith 2.7 offensive WAR and 2.0 defensive WAR, Tovar became the eighth shortstop 22 or younger to have 2.0 WAR or higher on both sides of the ball in the past 50 years. The others were longtime stars like Cal Ripken Jr., Troy Tulowitzki, Elvis Andrus and Francisco Lindor, or talents who saw off-the-field scandals take them out of the game (Addison Russell, Wander Franco).\nLooking even further back, the full list includes just 18 players dating back to 1890 and is highlighted by Hall of Famers Rogers Hornsby, Travis Jackson, Rabbit Maranville and Lou Boudreau and Black Sox scandal participant Buck Weaver.\nSimply put, it’s rare for shortstops that young to be so skilled. But it’s common for those who immediately show those abilities to stick around for the long term.\nBut even within this hyper-specific group, Tovar was joined by St. Louis shortstop Masyn Winn, who bested him on both sides with 3.5 oWAR and 2.4 dWAR.\nIt’s just not a good time to try to gain separation at the position.\n“There’s a lot of guys out there that are really great players,’ said Kansas City’s Bobby Witt Jr., perhaps the best of the group. “So it’s really great.”\nWitt offered a glowing assessment of Tovar.\n“All-around great player,” he said. “Plays great defense but also can hit. That’s what you want to be able to do on both sides and just use all the tools.”\nObserve the talent distribution at any Little League or high school game, and it becomes apparent how important it is to have a standout at shortstop. So while Tovar may not be standing out within this wave that includes players like Baltimore’s Gunnar Henderson and Cincinnati’s Elly De La Cruz, at least the Rockies aren’t falling behind at the spot.\n“I played with Tovar when he was 17 in Short-A (in Boise, Idaho),” Rockies first baseman Michael Toglia said. “I remember our farming director saying, ‘Take a look at this guy, he’s only 17 and with the actions of a big-league shortstop.’ I remember being impressed with him, and what was that, six, seven years ago? And to see him grow into the player he’s been the last couple of years is really awesome.”\nYOUNG WAVE\nSeven shortstops 24 or younger on Opening Day accrued 3.5 or more Wins Above Replacement (as measured by Baseball-Reference) in 2024, the most of any year in baseball history.\nWAR | Player | Team | Age |\n9.4 | Bobby Witt Jr. | Kansas City | 24 |\n9.1 | Gunnar Henderson | Baltimore | 23 |\n5.2 | Elly De La Cruz | Cincinnati | 23 |\n5.1 | Zach Neto | L.A. Angels | 23 |\n4.9 | Masyn Winn | St. Louis | 22 |\n3.8 | Ezequiel Tovar | Colorado | 22 |\n3.5 | Geraldo Perdoma | Arizona | 24 |\nOLD(ER) GUARD\nThe shortstop position may be led by younger players, but plenty of veterans also continue to stand out. Here were the best from 2024. (Note: Atlanta shortstop Ronald Acuna Jr. posted an 8.4 WAR in 2023 and won NL MVP but saw his 2024 season cut short after 49 games by an injury).\nWAR | Player | Team | Age |\n6.9 | Francisco Lindor | NY Mets | 30 |\n5.0 | Corey Seager | Texas | 30 |\n4.1 | Jeremy Pena | Houston | 25 |\n3.9 | Dansby Swanson | Chicago Cubs | 30 |\n3.7 | Carlos Correa | Minnesota | 29 |",
