    "text": "Us Weekly\nSurvivor’s Bret LaBelle, 51, and BF Chris Stanley, 25, Split After 4 Years\nSurvivor alum Bret LaBelle and Chris Stanley, paid no mind to the criticism surrounding their age-gap relationship.\nLaBelle started dating Stanley, who is 27 years his junior, in 2020. The twosome were candid about their age difference throughout their romance.\n\"Sometimes people think he's actually my dad. Other people think I'm just with him for money,\" Stanley told The Advocate in August 2023. \"They think he's my sugar daddy, which obviously isn't true.\"\nHe added: \"Sometimes people make the outrageous claim that I was ‘groomed' or something, which not only isn't the case. In reality, I am the one who pursued him. They think we're both weird.\"\nIn April 2025, LaBelle announced that he and Stanley called it quits after four years of dating.\nKeep scrolling for LaBelle and Stanley's complete relationship timeline:\n2016\nNearly four years before LaBelle started dating Stanley, he publicly came out as gay during a conversation with fellow competitor Zeke Smith on season 33 of Survivor. (Smith is also a member of the LGBTQIA+ community and married Superstore alum Nico Santos in 2023.)\n\"I didn't grow up in a time when it was normal to talk about being gay, and the millennials do not care,\" LaBelle shared in a Survivor:Millennials vs. Gen Xconfessional. \"Zeke finds comfort in being himself, and I think that's great. And I'm hoping that as my life goes on, from here on out, I can be that way.\"\n2020\nStanley sent LaBelle a message via Instagram amid the coronavirus pandemic, and they quickly hit it off.\nJanuary 2023\nThey became Instagram official three years later.\n\"Great seeing @realdavewright and sharing a few beers and laughs in San Diego,\" LaBelle, who also competed on season 31 of The Amazing Race in 2018, wrote via Instagram while sharing photos with Stanley and a pair of friends.\nApril 2023\n\"A very happy birthday to this amazing guy!!,\" LaBelle wrote via Instagram, penning a celebratory tribute to Stanley.\nOne month later, LaBelle and Stanley started the joint @ChrisAndBret Instagram page to chronicle their relationship milestones.\nDecember 2023\nWhen LaBelle and Stanley went to pick out their Christmas tree, a store employee mistakenly thought they were father and son.\n\"As I was checking out yesterday buying this beautiful tree - yes, it's real - my boyfriend is handing the cashier his credit card, but I'm like, ‘No, no, no. Let me pay for this.' So, I get out my credit card and I hand it to her,\" Stanley recalled in a TikTok video. \"She's like, ‘Oh yeah, nice.' And I'm like, ‘Why is she so excited that I'm paying?' And she's like, ‘I believe the more you give, the more you get this holiday season.'\"\nStanley ultimately decided against correcting the woman. \"I'm left wondering what the look would have been like on her face if I had told her [the truth],\" he added.\nApril 2025\nLaBelle took to Instagram to share the news that he and Stanley had split.\n\"Sometimes love means letting go. Chris and I have shared so many memories, laughter, and growth together, and I will always be grateful for that,\" the reality star captioned a photo of him and Stanley embracing. \"While our paths are now going in different directions, the care and respect remain. Wishing him nothing but happiness, love, and success on his journey. Thank you for the memories.\"\nCopyright 2025 Us Weekly.

    "text": "Tres personas sospechosas de preparar atentados contra iglesias y sinagogas en Turquía han sido detenidas dentro de una operación donde han sido arrestadas también otras 29 que se cree tienen contactos con círculos yihadistas y estaban implicados en esos planes. Una operación simultánea en nueve provincias turcas, coordinada por la policía junto a los servicios secretos (MIT), permitió detener a esas tres personas, supuestamente dirigentes de las redes del grupo yihadista Estado Islámico, o Daesh, en Turquía, informa este viernes la agencia oficialista Anadolu. La emisora pública turca TRT los identifica como Miybel el Shuweihi y Mohamed Hilaf Ibrahim, conocido como Abu Leis, sospechosos de preparar atentados contra sinagogas e iglesias en Turquía. El tercero sería Iheb Alani, que se cree estaba coordinando un ataque contra la embajada iraquí en Turquía, agrega la citada emisora. Además, las fuerzas de seguridad han detenido a otras 29 personas sospechosas de estar vinculadas a las redes yihadistas en Turquía. Hace una semana, la Policía detuvo a 304 personas bajo sospecha de mantener lazos con las células del Estado Islámico. Desde el atentado contra la discoteca Reina en Estambul en la Nochevieja de 2016, en la que un yihadista mató con un arma automática a 39 personas, las autoridades turca extreman la vigilancia en estas fechas. Aunque la Nochevieja se celebra popularmente en Turquía y no falta decoración navideña, algunos predicadores radicales se han pronunciado contra estas festividades por \"cristianas\" o \"paganas\". Desde el atentado contra el Reina, Turquía, que en 2016-2017 llevó a cabo una operación militar contra el Estado Islámico en el norte de Siria, no ha vuelto a sufrir atentados atribuidos al yihadismo.

    "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - Memphis Police Department has arrested and charged a woman accused of carjacking a rideshare driver. On June 12, 2024, at 4:25 a.m., officers responded to a carjacking call on Summer Avenue. Officers were informed that an Uber driver in a Ford Focus picked up a woman. The woman did not have a destination just wanted to ride and listen to music. When the driver returned the suspect on Summer Avenue, the woman forced the victim from the vehicle and drove away in the victim’s Ford Focus. A similar event occurred earlier this month in which a rideshare driver was shot after suspects attempted to steal his vehicle. MPD later identified the suspect as Faith-Ann Mittons. At 1:27 p.m., officers conducted a traffic stop on the Ford Focus at I40 near Sycamore View. Mittons was the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle. She was taken into custody. Faith-Ann Mittons, 27, was charged with carjacking. Her bond is set at $75,000.00.
