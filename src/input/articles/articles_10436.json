    "text": "Western states weigh up Lebanon evacuation options as ceasefire talks stall\n- Cypriot president says country ready if needed\n- Cyprus was key for evacuations during 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war\n- Talks also looking at Turkey exit as secondary plan\n- Thousands of foreign nationals could be stranded\nUNITED NATIONS/NICOSIA, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Western nations were weighing their options on Thursday on how to safely get nationals out of Lebanon if a full-scale war breaks out, diplomats said, with Cyprus and possibly Turkey seen as offering sanctuary to tens of thousands of people.\nCyprus is the closest European Union member state, some 264 km (164 miles) from Lebanon. It has been at the forefront of maritime aid efforts for Gaza and in the past was used to coordinate evacuations from Lebanon.\nCyprus processed around 60,000 people fleeing the Hezbollah-Israel war in 2006, and a potential Israel ground invasion into southern Lebanon with a response from Iran-backed Hezbollah of ballistic missiles and drones could mean mass evacuations from both Lebanon and Israel.\n\"We have requests from a number of countries, not only from the European Union but also from other third countries. We are ready to play this role in case of a need,\" Cyprus' President Nikos Christodoulides told Reuters on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.\n\"We did it back in 2006 and we are ready to do it again,\" Christodoulides said. \"It is difficult but also it is our moral responsibility.\"\nSeveral countries, including the United States, France, Britain and Germany, have thousands of nationals living or travelling through Lebanon. All have worked in recent months to prepare plans with Cyprus in case of a full-scale war.\nDiplomats said other nations without the needed military infrastructure in the region would also need help evacuating their citizens.\nIt takes about 10 hours from Beirut to Cyprus by sea and 40 minutes by plane. Until now, commercial airlines have been flying from Beirut, although some airlines like Air France have suspended operations, reducing options for people to leave.\nDiplomats say that not only are Lebanese defiant and unwilling to heed travel advice to leave, but many Lebanese and dual nationals abroad have also been filling planes to Beirut.\nNegotiations for a temporary ceasefire were under way\nat the United Nations in New York, but neither Israel nor Hezbollah indicated they were ready to cease hostilities and Israel stepped up its strikes on Beirut's southern suburbs on Thursday.Key to evacuations will be the use of Britain's two military bases on the island. Britain, which has about 10,000 citizens in Lebanon, said this week it was moving troops to Cyprus and had naval ships in place to help evacuations.\nWestern states were also working with\nTurkeyto make preparations for the possible evacuation, most likely by sea from the port of Tripoli in northern Lebanon to Mersin in southern Turkey, if Lebanon's airports cannot be used, Turkish and European sources said.No evacuation order has been given yet and it was unlikely unless Israel amassed troops on the Lebanese border, diplomats said.\nFrance has about 20,000 citizens in Lebanon and 1,000 troops as part of a U.N. peacekeeping mission. France's defence ministry declined to comment on specific planning, but said it has had robust plans in place since October 2023.\nEuropean diplomats said France has been liaising with the United States, which has about 50,000 citizens in Lebanon, and with Britain and Germany, to coordinate with Cyprus.\nWashingtonhas urged U.S. citizens to leave Lebanon, but the State Department has not ordered an evacuation of U.S. personnel nor requested assistance from the U.S. military to evacuate Americans, U.S. officials say.\nU.S. troops newly deployed to the region could help in the event of an evacuation, officials told Reuters.\nParis has a warship in the region that could evacuate about 150 people and a helicopter carrier on stand-by that could take 10 times that many, but it would take several days to reach the region from southern France, two French diplomats said.\nThe French, Cypriot, Greek and Italian navies carried out drills in the region from Sept. 14-18, including for evacuating citizens, according to the French defence ministry.\nOne challenge will be to secure a quick air bridge out of Cyprus given the large numbers of people arriving on the island in a short space of time, diplomats said.\n\"The real challenge in all this is that it is going to take a number of days, weeks even, to shift most foreign nationals out of Lebanon, excluding the possibility of Israel too, which means people in Lebanon may end up being told 'hang tight' while Israeli F-35s and Hezbollah missiles zoom above skies,\" said one European diplomat.\nSign up\nhere.Reporting by John Irish at the United Nations and Michele Kambas in Cyprus; Additional reporting by Jonathan Spicer and Simon Lewis; Editing by Howard Goller\nOur Standards:",

The investments we are announcing today will drive economic security and rural prosperity for generations to come.”\nThree organizations are receiving grants via the USDA broadband funding:\nStanding Rock Telecommunications Inc. (North Dakota): $22.23 million Copper Valley Telephone Cooperative Inc. (Alaska): $16.59 million 3 Rivers Telephone Cooperative Inc.

On behalf of NTCA and our members, I look forward to continued collaboration with USDA and others to connect the unconnected in rural America and to keep them connected.”\nThe funding for this fifth round of USDA ReConnect broadband funding was announced in March, with applications due in May.",

    "title": "Ideal Weather Conditions for Perfect Snowflake Photography",
    "text": "Embarking on the quest to photograph snowflakes is not just a photographic challenge but a journey into the heart of nature’s delicate artistry. Each snowflake is a unique masterpiece, a fleeting glimpse into the intricate wonders of the natural world. Understanding the conditions that lead to the perfect formation of these ice crystals is key to capturing their ethereal beauty. In this post, we’ll explore the ideal weather conditions for photographing well-defined snowflakes and delve into the fascinating process of how these winter wonders are formed.\nIdeal Weather Conditions for Photographing Snowflakes:\n- Temperature: Ideally, temperatures should be just below freezing, around -2°C to -5°C (28°F to 23°F). This range is perfect for preserving the snowflakes’ structure without causing them to become too brittle.\n- Humidity: Moderate to high humidity is crucial, as snowflakes form from water vapor. Too much humidity can cause them to clump together, while too little might not support their formation at all.\n- Snow Type: The best snowflakes for photography are found in light, fluffy snow, which is more likely to contain the classic, intricate shapes.\n- Wind Conditions: Calm conditions are preferable, as wind can damage the delicate structure of the snowflakes.\nHow Snowflakes Form:\nSnowflakes begin as tiny ice crystals in the clouds, forming when water vapor condenses directly onto a particle like dust or pollen. As they fall through the cloud, they encounter more water vapor, which freezes onto the crystal, causing it to grow. The shape and complexity of a snowflake are influenced by the temperature and humidity it encounters during its descent. Temperatures just below freezing typically produce flat, six-sided shapes, while colder conditions result in more columnar forms. The sixfold symmetry of snowflakes, a result of the molecular structure of water, creates the iconic hexagonal pattern we associate with snowflakes. The journey through different atmospheric layers imparts each snowflake with its unique pattern, ensuring no two are exactly alike.\nPhotographing snowflakes is a delicate balance of science and art. By understanding the conditions under which these natural wonders form and thrive, you can capture their fleeting beauty, immortalizing a moment that nature crafts with exquisite precision but rarely preserves. Each photograph of a snowflake is a testament to the unique and transient beauty of nature.\nFor Further Training:\nHave you ever wanted to photograph an amazing moment but missed the shot because you didn’t know the right camera settings to use?
