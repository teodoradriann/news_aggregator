This is also the site where the Jesuit Priest Edward Oldcorne suffered the same fate on April 7, 1606. The medieval moated manor of Harvington Hall, which has strong links to John Wall, contains more priest holes or hides than any other house in England.

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "$1M winning lottery ticket sold in Kendallville claimed 5 hours before deadline\nThe winner had until 4:30 p.m. ET Thursday to claim their prize\nKENDALLVILLE, Ind. (WPTA) - With five hours to spare, the couple who bought a $1 million winning lottery ticket in Kendallville claimed their prize.\nThe ticket, which matched all five white balls for the June 29 drawing, was bought at Kendallville Finish Line, at 620 Professional Way. The winning Powerball numbers for that drawing were: 26-51-54-61-69 with the Powerball of 25.\nUpon claiming the ticket, they said it was “an emotional day” for them both.\nThey told Hoosier lottery officials they had seen news coverage and signage about the unclaimed ticket beginning about a month ago and began searching. The couple said they do not visit the gas station frequently and were unsure if they had purchased a ticket for that specific Powerball drawing.\nThe first search was unsuccessful, but on Wednesday, they woke up at 4 a.m. to search again – including deep between their car seats. There, they found their winning ticket.\nAll prizes must be claimed within 180 days of the drawing. Hoosier Lottery encourages those with winning tickets to ensure their ticket is in a secure place, consider meeting with a financial advisor and contact Hoosier Lottery customer service at 1-800-955-6886 for specific claim instructions.\nThe Powerball jackpot is an estimated $145 million for Saturday, Dec. 28. Overall odds are 1 in 25, per Hoosier Lottery.\nWatch our [previous report](https://www.21alivenews.com/2024/12/07/1-million-winning-powerball-ticket-sold-kendallville-expire-soon/) below.\nTo be the first to get the latest breaking news alerts, download the 21Alive News App.\nDownload for both iPhone and Android devices can be found [here](https://www.21alivenews.com/page/get-the-new-abc-21-news-app-today/).\nCopyright 2024 WPTA.
