    "text": "Leah Remini announces divorce from husband after 21 years of marriage Leah Remini is to divorce her husband of 21 years (Ian West/PA)\nFri, 30 Aug, 2024 - 09:29 Naomi Clarke, PA Senior Entertainment Reporter  \n    American actress Leah Remini has announced her and husband Angelo Pagan are divorcing after 21 years of marriage.\nIn a joint Instagram post, the King of Queens star said the decision came after “a lot of thought and care” but they decided to part ways as they have “both changed” as people.\nThe couple, who share a daughter Sofia and have documented their lives in a number of TV documentaries and reality shows, said they hope to “inspire others to see that relationships — whether they change or end — aren’t failures”.\nAlongside a photo of the pair in their early days and more recently, Remini wrote: “Well, here we are. After 28 years together and 21 years of marriage, we have decided to file for divorce.\n“This decision came after a lot of thought and care, and as hard as divorce is, we are approaching this with a positive outlook because we know it’s what’s best for us.\n“We are proud of how we have worked through this together. Yes, we’re sad, and we’ve got some figuring out to do as we continue to move forward into our new normal—together still in many ways, and apart in some new ones.\n“But here’s the thing: we’ve been best friends for so many years. We are still celebrating holidays together, watching our favourite TV shows together, and gathering as a family.\n“So, the big question— why? To put it simply, we both changed, as people do, and we got used to playing roles that didn’t fit us any more.\n“After a lot of effort and consideration, we’ve decided to take this step, which reflects who we are today.”\nThe actress said they feel their marriage is one to celebrate after creating “many beautiful memories” and producing their “incredible daughter”.\nShe explained they wanted to be transparent about the change in their relationship after being open about it over the years.\nTheir wedding in 2003 was captured in the documentary VH1 Inside Out: Leah Remini’s Wedding Special, with a following one released the year after to document the birth of their daughter.\nLeah Remini and Angelo Pagan (Alamy/PA)\n“We are sharing this unknown territory with you all as we take our first steps into this next stage of our lives publicly,” she said.\n“We would love for everyone to have more access to different kinds of relationship stories and not feel so isolated in navigating the changes that millions of couples make every year.\n“We hope our journey can inspire others to see that relationships — whether they change or end — aren’t failures. We’ll keep sharing snippets of our lives as we navigate this new chapter.”\nThey signed off the statement by writing: “Love, Leah & Angelo.”\nRemini is best known for starring as Carrie Heffernan in US sitcom The King Of Queens and as Vanessa Cellucci in Kevin Can Wait.\nThe actress has also been outspoken about her experience with The Church of Scientology and she won two Emmy Awards for her series, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, which explored her time with the organisation.\nShe filed a lawsuit against the organisation and its leader David Miscavige last year, saying in a statement that she had endured 17 years of “psychological torture, defamation, surveillance, harassment, and intimidation” which had “significantly” impacted her life and career.\nThe Church of Scientology described the lawsuit as “ludicrous” and her allegations as “pure lunacy”.",

In their post, the Deans are sitting in front of some of their paintings and other images of them, as well as the artists whose art they have in their collection. Swizz held a seat on the museum's board from 2015 until last October. News of the exhibition's existence was shared back in November 2023.\n\"Been holding this incredible news close to the chest,\" the couple wrote in their caption. \"Now, it's our pleasure to officially announce GIANTS: Art from the Dean Collection of Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys opening on February 10 @brooklynmuseum !

    "title": "7 things to do in NYC this weekend with non-exhausting levels of crowds and tourists",
    "text": "This week is utter and total pandemonium in many pockets of the city.\nAustinites like to leave town during SXSW. New Orleanians near the parade grounds rent out their houses during Jazz Fest.\nBut what do New Yorkers do if they’re in town the week between Christmas and New Year’s? No matter how you try to warn them, visitors always want to see the tree or Central Park, or walk the Brooklyn Bridge … along with the millions of other holiday visitors.\nWhile we can’t predict the future, here are some ideas for enjoying this week without the worst of the crowds.\nGet tonkatsu and go to Tomi Jazz\nOkay, this is definitely still Midtown. But if you’ve been dragged out to brave the tree at Rockefeller Center or have a stop at Grand Central, head east for some of the best Japanese food in the city.\nKatsu-Hama’s panko-crusted Berkshire pork loin is incredibly light and tender, and their katsu curry and katsudon are also standout options. Nearby Totto Ramen and Okatte Tanto are among the neighborhood’s many offerings. Afterward, a stop at Tokyo-style speakeasy Bar Orai (21+) or Tomi Jazz (kids welcome) should help you settle down from the day.\nEat in Sunset Park Chinatown before braving the Dyker Heights lights\nOkay, holiday crowds aren’t limited to Midtown. But if you want to avoid a hurried, hangry walk – or worse yet, a standstill drive – through the\nlight display in Dyker Heights, stop off in Sunset Park along the way for regional Chinese options, including standout Cantonese dim sum houses like East Harbor Seafood or Golden Imperial. Or you can find Hunan, Sichuan, Taiwanese food and more around the neighborhood or at famed food courts like the one inside Fei Long Market. For more inspiration, here’s a guide of where to eat in Sunset Park’s Chinatown, from chef Calvin Eng.\nCruise around the island with the Circle Line\nIt can be easy to forget we’re in an archipelago. For 75 years, Circle Line’s flagship cruise (tickets start at around $46) has taken sightseers around the entire island, offering lesser-seen views by going up the Harlem River and through Spuyten Duyvil Creek. There’s no better way to see the skyline up close and unobstructed. For more info on Circle Line’s schedule and pricing, visit their\nwebsite. And if you want a cheaper, albeit less comprehensive option, there’s always the ferries: NYC ferries, Staten Island Ferry, Hudson River Ferries and even the free IKEA ferry for scenic views of Red Hook.\nCurate your own film festival\nThere’s no shortage of rare or unusual screenings this weekend, alongside the regular megaplex fare.\nFilm Forum is showing new restorations of “The Third Man” (on 35mm) and “Days of Heaven” (in 4K). Metrograph adds “Magnolia” to its traditional New Year screenings of “Phantom Thread” and “Eyes Wide Shut” on celluloid, along with other offerings. And the IFC Center is showing morning matinee classics like “The Muppets Take Manhattan” to midnight movie crowdpleasers like Indiana Jones.\nEat in Astoria before settling in at MoMI\nIf you’d prefer to avoid Manhattan, the\nMuseum of the Moving Image is hosting a retrospective of director Todd Haynes’ work. It's showing films up through his latest, “May December,” which has already bagged several laurels before awards season even gets into full gear. While you’re there, you can also check out the museum's long-standing Jim Henson exhibit. To make a day of it, stop through one of Astoria’s many eating enclaves, from the Levantine establishments lining Steinway Street – you can’t go wrong with Zyara or Duzan, and Al-Sham Sweets – to Pye Boat Noodles or the classic Greek restaurants closer to 35th Avenue.\nSee the Big Apple Circus before it leaves the big top\nYou won’t find lions, tigers or elephants at this year’s Big Apple Circus. But you will find charming clowns, creative costumes, expressive dancers and a live band. Plus there are several stunning trapeze artists and aerialists who manage to evoke emotion and awe in every act. The show is a little over two hours, with a 20-minute intermission, and there’s an act to dazzle guests of all ages. It’s on now through Jan. 15 under the tent at Lincoln Center. And it’s cheaper than most Broadway shows, with\ntickets starting at $25. Admission is free for kids 3 and under who sit on their parent’s lap.\nStroll between art galleries and installations\nMany New York favorites close down during this strange twilight week of the year. But plenty of year-round gems remain open, from La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela’s\nDream House, to the 24/7 viewing window at Mmuseumm. Highlights from the current gallery shows include Delcy Morelos’ stunning warehouse-sized installation at Dia:Chelsea or the massive group show by exclusively women artists at the Shah Garg Foundation, with works from Cecily Brown, Jenny Holzer, Laura Owens and dozens more. Download See Saw to stay informed of exciting art shows in town. The galleries and installations listed here are all open this weekend, but it’s always a good idea to double check holiday hours before heading out.",
