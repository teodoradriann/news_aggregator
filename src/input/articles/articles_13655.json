    "text": "The Ellwood City Lincoln High boys basketball team got the job done Wednesday night.\nJoseph Roth scored 21 points to propel the Wolverines to a 40-37 WPIAL Class 3A consolation-round win over host Yough.\nEllwood City’s win locked up the seventh and final playoff berth out of the district for the upcoming PIAA playoffs. A loss would have ended the season for the Wolverines.\nEllwood City will play the District 6 champion on March 9 in the opening round of the PIAA playoffs.\nRoth now has 2,049 career points. He is one of seven county standouts to record over 2,000 points. Wilmington product Warren Sallade sits sixth on the all-time list at 2,075.\nEllwood City (17-9) was moments away from locking up a state playoff bid last week against top-seeded Deer Lakes and a spot in the WPIAL semifinals. However, the Wolverines let it get away in regulation and again in overtime, finally falling 39-38.\nEllwood City could have locked up a state playoff spot Saturday at home against Derry. However, the Trojans rolled to a 59-40 decision.\nYough’s season ends at 19-7.\nThe Wolverines led 12-6 after the first quarter and the teams were tied at 17 at the break. Ellwood City carried a 28-23 margin into the fourth quarter.\nAaron Lake contributed nine points for the Wolverines.\nTerek Crosby collected 21 points for the Cougars.",

    "text": "El presidente palestino, Mahmud Abás, pidió hoy el fin del \"rio de sangre\" y de los \"inmensos sacrificios\" del pueblo palestino en un mensaje de felicitación de Navidad, celebración que cobra especial relevancia en Belén, donde la tradición cristiana ubica el nacimiento de Jesús. \"El río de sangre, los inmensos sacrificios, las penurias y la heroica resiliencia de nuestro pueblo en su tierra son el camino hacia la libertad y la dignidad\", afirmó el presidente de la Autoridad Palestina, que gobierna zonas reducidas de Cisjordania ocupada. Cada 24 de diciembre, Belén -centro de la comunidad cristiana palestina- celebra un tradicional desfile con bandas de música, previo a la llegada del Patriarca Latino de Jerusalén a pie para oficiar una misa en la Iglesia de Santa Catalina, la parte católica basílica de la Natividad. Pero este año, el patriarca Pierbattista Pizzaballa -el enviado religioso del Vaticano a Tierra Santa- llegará a Belén en una procesión solemne, sin música ni actos festivos, de luto por el alto número de muertos palestinos en la guerra en la Franja de Gaza, que superan los 20.200 mientras prosigue la ofensiva israelí. Cisjordania ocupada también ha vivido su año más mortífero desde 2002, el pico de violencia de la Segunda Intifada, con unos 510 muertos, más de la mitad desde el 7 de octubre, cuando comenzó la guerra en el enclave. Abás expresó hoy, día de Nohebuena, su esperanza de que esta Navidad marque el cese de la guerra israelí contra el pueblo palestino en Gaza y el resto de territorios palestinos ocupados, deseando \"prosperidad y estabilidad para el pueblo palestino y todas las naciones\". \"El sol de la libertad y [nuestro] Estado independiente con Jerusalén como capital está inevitablemente surgiendo, casi a nuestro alcance\", afirmó el presidente en su discurso de Navidad. \"El pueblo palestino está decidido a continuar su lucha para lograr sus derechos legítimos, el principal de los cuales es el derecho a un Estado independiente y plenamente soberano, donde puedan vivir con dignidad en su patria\", agregó. El presidente palestino también rindió homenaje a los miles de \"mártires de Palestina\", deseó una pronta recuperación para los heridos, libertad para los prisioneros y oró por la preservación del pueblo palestino en Gaza, Cisjordania, Jerusalén y la diáspora.

    "text": "[Cronaca](/publisher/Cronaca/section/)\n/\n[Como città](/publisher/como-citta/section/)\nVenerdì 29 Novembre 2024\nOggi lo sciopero generale. Fermi scuola, sanità, servizi e bus, ma non i treni\nLa protesta I lavoratori di tutti i settori incrociano le braccia. Corteo in centro dalle 9.30. Niente mezzi di Asf e battelli per quattro ore (9-13). Ferrovienord e Rfi: corse regolari\nOggi sciopero generale: quattro ore per il trasporto (ma non per i treni del pendolari) e otto per la scuola, la sanità e i servizi pubblici e privati. Ecco cosa aspettarci per la giornata di protesta indetta da Cgil e Uil contro la manovra finanziaria.\nPersonale di Asf in sciopero tra le 9 e le 13\nSul fronte degli spostamenti, il ministero dei Trasporti ha precettato i lavoratori del settore di sua competenza riducendo la fascia orario dello sciopero. In aziende come Asf l’astensione possibile del personale viaggiante e impiegatizio va comunque dalle 9 alle 13. Prima e dopo le corse sono garantite, i bus in partenza alle 8.59 devono arrivare fino al capolinea. Regolari, invece, i treni: nel tardo pomeriggio di ieri la Regione ha infatti comunicato che il personale di Ferrovienord ha revocato lo sciopero. Anche il personale di Rfi non partecipa all’astensione, di conseguenza i treni dei pendolari dovrebbero viaggiare regolarmente anche oltre la fascia di garanzia.\nInvece i voli potrebbero subire cancellazioni e ritardi tra le 10 e le 14, Ita Airways ha annunciato che 41 aerei nazionali non decolleranno. Non è esente il servizio taxi. E la Navigazione avverte che «le corse di linea tra le 9 e le 13 potranno essere sospese, si precisa altresì che al di fuori dell’orario dell’agitazione sindacale potranno subire modifiche o ritardi». Sui battelli della Navigazione occorre pensare che più di otto dipendenti su dieci sono iscritti ai sindacati. Possibili stop anche alle funicolare sempre tra le 9 e le 13.\nRifiuti, scuole e sanità\nPossibili disservizi nel ritiro porta a porta dei rifiuti\nAttenzione alla raccolta dei rifiuti. Aprica informa che a Como oggi «è verosimile che si verifichino dei disservizi». Per il ritiro porta a porta, per i servizi di spazzamento delle strade e per l’apertura dei centri di raccolta e gli sportelli dell’azienda. La società precisa che i sacchi non ritirati verranno recuperati nei turni successivi nelle modalità previste. Sono garantiti i servizi indispensabili che riguardano i rifiuti pericolosi o delle particolari utenze, dagli ospedali alle scuole.\nA tal proposito anche il mondo della scuola e della sanità sono coinvolti nello sciopero. Nella scuola il sindacato è radicato e non è impossibile che saltino delle lezioni, anche l’università dell’Insubria ha pubblicato un avviso urgente nel quale avverte gli studenti frequentanti.\nNella sanità invece tutte le urgenze devono comunque essere garantite, le operazioni importanti e le cure intensive non possono essere rimandate, non sono permesse ripercussioni in Pronto soccorso. Certo è vero che la scorsa settimana durante lo sciopero indetto da alcune sigle sindacale che rappresentano i medici e gli infermieri nel blocco operatorio del Sant’Anna a Como e in quello del Sant’Antonio Abate a Cantù sono saltate alcune operazioni, una trentina, non urgenti e programmabili nelle successive settimane.\nCorteo in città\nPossono partecipare allo sciopero anche i funzionari degli enti pubblici, dei Comuni e per esempio dell’Inps.\nLa Cgil a Como ha organizzato alle 9.30 un corteo con partenza da Porta Torre con arrivo a San Fedele dove sono previsti gli interventi dei rappresentanti sindacali. La Uil del Lario a seguire ha organizzato un presidio in piazza Tricolore ad Albate dalle 15.\n© RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",

    "text": "Trauernder Witwer von Anita Kupsch offenbart: „Hat mich nicht einmal mehr erkannt“\nNach jahrelanger Krankheit verstarb Schauspielerin Anita Kupsch mit 85 Jahren. Ihr Mann erzählt nun von den letzten Tagen, die sie miteinander teilten.\nBerlin – Als Arzthelferin Gabi Köhler in der ARD-Vorabendserie „Praxis Bülowbogen“ zauberte sich Anita Kupsch (†85) in die Herzen der Zuschauer. In ihren letzten Lebensjahren kämpfte die Schauspielerin unter anderem gegen Demenz und wurde liebevoll von ihrem Mann Klaus-Detlef Krahn (79) gepflegt. Der trauernde Witwer spricht nun über die letzten Tage, die er mit seiner Frau verbrachte.\nMann von Anita Kupsch war ihr wichtigster Halt\nAm 3. Juli starb Anita Kupsch in einer Berliner Pflegeeinrichtung. „Sie hat sich ja nur noch gequält und war ganz abgemagert“, offenbarte ihr Mann am Tag ihres Todes im Gespräch mit Bild. Beide waren ab 1987 verheiratet, für den TV-Star war es die zweite Ehe. Das plötzliche Ableben von Anita Kupsch kam für den Innenausstatter jedoch nicht unerwartet: „Es war absehbar, aber wenn es dann soweit ist, tut es unfassbar weh.“\nJahrelang pflegte Klaus-Detlef seine Anita, war ihre größte Stütze. Auch während ihrer Zeit in der Pflegeeinrichtung stand er ihr immer zur Seite. Er besuchte sie jeden Tag, so der Witwer gegenüber Die Aktuelle. Die letzten Tage mit seiner Liebsten waren aber auch für ihn nicht einfach – wegen der Demenz „hat sie mich nicht einmal mehr erkannt“, verrät er mit Tränen in den Augen.\nNicht nur Anita Kupsch: Witwer trauert um weiteres Familienmitglied\nAufgrund der Krankheit hatte Anita Kupsch lange zu leiden. „Die Demenz ist eine ganz schreckliche Krankheit“, klagt Klaus-Detlef. Seine Frau „war organisch in Ordnung, nur diese Demenz hat sie kaputtgemacht“. Für den Witwer ist der Tod seiner geliebten Frau aber nicht der einzige Verlust. „Erst am 7. Mai musste ich von meinem Bruder Abschied nehmen und jetzt von meiner Frau“, offenbarte er Bild.\nIn diesem Jahr mussten sich TV-Zuschauer bereits von einigen Promis verabschieden, darunter von NDR-Legende Carlo von Tiedemann (†81). Kürzlich fand seine Trauerfreier in Hamburg statt. Verwendete Quellen: bild.de, Die Aktuelle (29/2025)",

    "title": "British-Indian MPs swear oath on ‘Bhagavad Gita’, ‘Gutka’, ‘Bible’ - Hindustan Times",
    "text": "British-Indian MPs swear oath on ‘Bhagavad Gita’, ‘Gutka’, ‘Bible’ Newly elected Indian-origin MPs to the House of Commons have been pledging their allegiance to the British Crown as a symbol of loyalty to the country, choosing to swear on holy texts or to affirm their oath during the first week of a new Parliament London : Newly elected Indian-origin MPs to the House of Commons have been pledging their allegiance to the British Crown as a symbol of loyalty to the country, choosing to swear on holy texts or to affirm their oath during the first week of a new Parliament. A total of 11 members of the Sikh community – six men and five women — were elected to the House of Commons. All the 11 newly elected Sikh MPs belong to the Labour Party, which has come to power after more than a decade. With a total of 29 Indian-origin members, apart from Black, Asian and other ethnic minority lawmakers, this is Britain’s most ethnically diverse Parliament so far, according to an analysis by British Future, a think-tank. A new copy of the ‘Bhagavad Gita’ presented to speaker Lindsay Hoyle by Shailesh Vara, former Conservative Party member of Parliament who lost his Cambridgeshire seat in last week’s general election, featured early on as Rishi Sunak was among the first British Indian MPs to take his oath as Leader of the Opposition on Tuesday. Holding the text in his right hand, the former prime minister read out the customary text: “I swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles, his heirs and successors, according to law. So help me God.” First-time MP Kanishka Narayan, who is the first Indian-origin member of Parliament to represent Wales in the Westminster Parliament after winning the Vale of Glamorgan seat for Labour, also chose the ‘Gita’ for his oath, as did new Tory MP from Leicester Shivani Raja. Bob Blackman, a Tory veteran, who represents Harrow East in London and has chaired the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for British Hindus, chose to hold both the ‘Gita’ and the ‘King James Bible’ for his oath-taking ceremony. “This ‘Bhagavad Gita’ has been specially blessed in a temple in India and will be used by Hindu MPs entering Parliament following this general election and those who will enter in the generations to come,” said Shailesh Vara, when he recently presented the holy text blessed at the Mayapur temple headquarters of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). Some of the British Sikh MPs such as Tan Dhesi and first-timers Gurinder Singh Josan, Harpreet Uppal, Satvir Kaur and Warinder Singh Juss chose to swear their oath to the Sikh scriptures but without holding any text in their hands. Preet Kaur Gill, with her head covered with a red scarf, chose to hold the cloth-wrapped ‘Sundar Gutka’ prayer book during her swearing-in. Sojan Joseph, the mental health nurse from Kerala who has been elected Labour MP from Ashford in Kent, chose the ‘New Testament’ biblical text to swear his oath. Meanwhile, the ‘King James Bible’ was chosen by re-elected Conservatives Priti Patel and Claire Coutinho, as well as Liberal Democrat Munira Wilson. MPs can opt for a non-religious affirmation, as did the two new Independent MPs with their roots in India, Shockat Adam and Iqbal Mahmood, along with many others, including Tory MP Gagan Mohindra and Labour’s Lisa Nandy and Seema Malhotra. First-timers like Tory MP Dr Neil Shastri-Hunt and Labour’s Jeevun Sandher and Sonia Kumar also chose to affirm their pledge of allegiance. The affirmation reads: “I do solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and affirm, that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles, his heirs and successors, according to law.” All elected MPs, including 29 of Indian heritage, have been queuing up in the Commons chamber since Tuesday to complete this protocol before they can officially take their seats in Parliament. The process completed on Thursday and Parliament was adjourned until next week, when the State Opening and King’s Speech laying out the new government’s plans for the parliamentary calendar is scheduled for July 17.

    "title": "El consumo de alcohol en menores de 13 y 13 años: más del 35% lo ha probado alguna vez",
    "text": "Uno de cada tres menores de entre 12 y 13 años ha probado el alcohol alguna vez - Sanidad pública un estudio piloto sobre el consumo y posibles adicciones en menores - Cuanto mayor es el consumo de los padres, mayor es el del niño Las niñas consumen más alcohol y tabaco que los niños, pero ellos, empiezan antes. Son los datos que el Ministerio de Sanidad ha hecho público a través de un [estudio piloto sobre el consumo y posibles adicciones en menores de 12 y 13 años](https://pnsd.sanidad.gob.es/profesionales/publicaciones/catalogo/catalogoPNSD/publicaciones/pdf/2023_OEDA_InformePilotoESTUDES_1y2_ESO.pdf) (correspondientes a 1º y 2º de ESO) dentro del Plan Nacional sobre drogas. Los datos más relevantes apuntan a que el 35% de los adolescentes de 12 y 13 años ha consumido alcohol, el 25% cigarrillos electrónicos y el 8,5% tabaco. Estas cifras aumentan considerablemente en el siguiente grupo de edad (de 14 a 18 años), ya que el 76% ha consumido alcohol al menos una vez en su vida. [Los datos aumentan con respecto al 2022](https://pnsd.sanidad.gob.es/profesionales/sistemasInformacion/informesEstadisticas/pdf/2022OEDA-INFORME.pdf), cuando el segundo grupo se situaba en un 73,9%. Sanidad pone de manifiesto que “cuanto mayor es el consumo de los padres, mayor es el consumo del niño”. En todos los tramos temporales y tipos de consumo analizados se observa que el 49,7 % de los adolescentes cuyos padres [abusan del alcohol](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20230417/alcohol-dana-cerebro-incluso-despues-dejar-beber/2439071.shtml) todos o casi todos los días, lo han probado. Esta cifra se eleva hasta el 62,2 % en los casos en los que la madre presenta un problema de abuso de estas sustancias. ¿Cómo y dónde? Aunque en España la venta de tabaco y alcohol esté prohibida a menores de edad, los estudiantes de 14 a 18 años consideran que es “muy fácil” conseguir sustancias psicoactivas si quisiesen. Estas declaraciones se reducen considerablemente en el grupo de edad correspondiente a los primeros cursos de ESO. El Ministerio apunta que, en la mayoría de los casos, adquieren estas substancias en las tiendas de barrio o quioscos, pero también en las casas de otras personas. Lugares de venta ambulante o internet son sitios menos habituales. Su consumo se realiza al aire libre, en calles, plazas, parques, playas o espacios públicos. Le siguen las casas de otras personas y en las que ellos mismos viven. Además, el 7,2 % de los estudiantes de 12 a 13 años afirma haber tenido alguna vez una intoxicación etílica o borrachera. Otras adicciones La latente popularidad de los cigarrillos electrónicos ha supuesto un aumento muy claro: uno de cada cuatro adolescentes lo ha probado. Entre los alumnos de 1º y 2º de ESO también se detecta un consumo acentuado de [bebidas energéticas](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20230915/bebidas-energeticas-alcohol-jovenes-riesgos-enganos/2456000.shtml), situándolas en un 37,7 % y en un 10,2% [mezcladas con alcohol](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20230208/bebidas-energeticas-peligrosas-exceso/2422554.shtml). De la misma forma, Sanidad también ha analizado el uso de otras sustancias o actividades adictivas como los videojuegos, las pipas de agua, el juego con dinero y el uso de internet.",
