    "title": "Sciopero, Salvini attacca Landini: \"Prepara suo arrivo in Parlamento\"",
    "text": "(Adnkronos) - \"Mi viene il dubbio che Maurizio Landini non tuteli l'interesse di lavoratrici e lavoratori, ma prepari il suo arrivo in Parlamento\". Così il ministro dei Trasporti e leader della Lega, Matteo Salvini, torna a parlare del segretario della Cgil a due giorni dallo sciopero generale del 29 novembre e dopo l'annuncio di una nuova mobilitazione per il 13 dicembre.\n\"Leggevo su qualche giornale che Salvini ce l'ha con Landini. No, la vita è un dono troppo grande per passare il tempo odiando qualcuno. Però quando fai lo sciopero generale perché 'il governo taglia i fondi alla sanità' menti sapendo di mentire... Landini - ha detto il leader della Lega - ha proclamato lo sciopero ancora prima di conoscere la legge di bilancio, lamentando i tagli sulla sanità che non ci sono, perché in sanità ci sono 136 miliardi di euro che è il record storico per il servizio sanitario nazionale, quindi mi sembra che faccia politica\". \"E' suo diritto di farlo - osserva - come hanno fatto tutti i segretari della Cgil prima di lui che poi sono entrati in politica, lasciando il diritto di garantire agli italiani che vogliono lavorare tranquilli il diritto di farlo\".\nSalvini ricorda che \"negli ultimi 20 anni solo due governi hanno ridotto gli stanziamenti sanitari rispetto all'anno precedente: si parla di due governi a guida Partito democratico e non ci furono scioperi generali. Allora mi viene il dubbio che il signor Landini non tuteli l'interesse di lavoratrici e lavoratori, ma prepari il suo arrivo in Parlamento come parlamentare della sinistra, come hanno fatto tutti i predecessori alla guida della Cgil. E quindi io ritengo mio diritto e mio dovere intervenire per garantire il diritto allo sciopero, che è sacrosanto, ma anche il diritto al lavoro\".\nCollegandosi con l'assemblea nazionale di Noi Moderati a Roma, sottolinea che \"ci sono altri 15 scioperi solo nel mese di dicembre: se non si conterranno riducendo i disagi per i cittadini, a pochi giorni dal Natale, farò quello che ritengo sia mio diritto e dovere fare da ministro dei Trasporti\". E riferendosi al nuovo sciopero annunciato per venerdì 13 dicembre ha assicurato che \"se non utilizzeranno il buon senso\" ricorrerò \"al criterio di garantire per il penultimo venerdì prima di Natale una giornata serena\"generale .\n“Il governo, invece di porsi il problema di come rispondere a 500.000 persone che sono andata in piazza e a milioni di persone che hanno scioperato, continua a dire che il problema è quello che è successo a Torino fatto da 100 persone. Si capisce che siamo di fronte a qualcosa che non torna. Perché siamo di fronte a una esplicita volontà di non misurarsi con quella che è la richiesta che è stata avanzata\", afferma dal canto suo Landini, a margine dell’assemblea di Europa verde in corso Chianciano terme.\n\"Io non sto dicendo che noi rappresentavamo tutti, ma da quello che si è visto venerdì 29 noi rappresentiamo una parte importante di questo Paese, quelli che pagano le tasse, quelli che tengono in piedi questo Paese e una delle rivendicazioni che stiamo facendo ad esempio è di andare a prendere i soldi dove sono, perché in questi due anni i profitti sono aumentati in una maniera esagerata e sono calati i salari e la tassazione sta aumentando sul lavoro dipendente e sui pensionati. Quindi io penso che ci sia un tentativo esplicito, lo ripeto, di svolta autoritaria perché quando alle persone che ti chiedono democraticamente di essere ascoltate non rispondi e pensi addirittura di fare un decreto che li arresti se manifestano, ecco io penso che questa è una svolta autoritaria contraria ai principi della nostra costituzione\", aggiunge Landini.",

    "title": "49ers QB Purdy admits he was in ‘sucky state of mind' vs. Ravens",
    "text": "SANTA CLARA — [Brock Purdy is learning](https://www.nbcsportsbayarea.com/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/brock-purdy-four-interceptions-kyle-shanahan/1685389/), one play at a time, and the [49ers' Christmas night loss](https://www.nbcsportsbayarea.com/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/49ers-observations-brock-purdy-ravens/1684685/) to the Baltimore Ravens at Levi's Stadium was an important lesson. With the worst game of the quarterback’s two-year NFL career in the rearview mirror, Purdy now can see how his emotional state affected his play in the 33-19 loss. “It’s just not being in the right state of mind as a quarterback,” Purdy said Thursday. “Having the aggressive trigger to make the throw, the big play, but also shoot, dude, you don’t want to turn the ball over again. Stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! [Sign up here for our All Access Daily newsletter.] “It’s just a sucky state of mind to be in.” Purdy hadn’t struggled in the NFL like he did in the 49ers' loss to the Ravens, but now he has the proper perspective to see [his four-interception game](https://www.nbcsportsbayarea.com/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/brock-purdy-interceptions-kyle-shanahan/1684878/) as a learning experience that he can use. “Every play has a life of its own,” Purdy said. “You have to take it one play at a time and not try to win the game by a couple big plays. When I’m thinking like that, I just wasn’t in the right state of mind toward the end when we’re trying to get back into it. That’s the learning experience.” Purdy explained that the pressure he put on himself to “make up” for the mistakes he made earlier in the game affected how he played, especially in the second half. While he doesn’t want to lose his aggressive nature of “letting it rip” downfield, he does want to make the correct decisions, not trying to force a throw that could end up as a turnover. San Francisco 49ers The experience also put the game into perspective for Purdy, not buying into the hype of making any contest bigger than what it is. Prime time, “Monday Night Football,” with the whole world watching shouldn’t make him feel any additional pressure to push the ball downfield. “It was a big game,” Purdy said. “So for me, it’s a great learning experience just in terms of not buying into what’s going on around and what’s being said. Instead, executing in the moment, making the right reads, being consistent, protecting the ball, all those things.” The loss was a humbling experience for the young play-caller. While Purdy is pretty good at blocking out most of the outside noise, there admittedly have been some accolades that have grabbed his attention. “I think it was huge just in terms of being a quarterback in this league,” Purdy said. “When things are going well, people can say some great things, and it’s easy to buy into it a little bit. But you’ve got to put your head down, go to work, have that chip on your shoulder still and still prove to yourself that you’ve got to continue to show your teammates that you’re the guy week in and week out. “It’s not to say I’m going to be perfect moving forward. It’s football. You’re not perfect.” Purdy and the 49ers' offense will need to stay focused on a short week before heading to the East Coast to face the Washington Commanders on Sunday at FedExField.",

    "title": "Congress committing dacoity on rights of OBCs, SCs, STs: PM",
    "text": "Addressing a BJP election rally in Agra, he said the Constituent Assembly drafting the Constitution had rejected reservation on the basis of religion, but the Congress has a record of insulting the document and its chief architect Babasaheb Ambedkar.\nThe party has tried to push reservations on religious basis in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and its manifestoes mention the proposal, he said. In Uttar Pradesh too, the Samajwadi Party-Congress INDI alliance, pursuing the politics of appeasement, wants to bring reservation on religion basis.\n\"Wherever it can do it, it will try to loot the claims of the SCs, STs and OBCs and give them to others,\" he said.\nMr Modi said since the courts rejected the Congress moves to introduce reservations on religious basis, it is now trying to do so \"by the back door.\" The party wants to \"steal\" from the OBCs&apos; 27 per cent quota quietly to pursue its objective. The Prime Minister asked the crowds \"will you accept this, will you tolerate this?\"\nThe Karnataka Congress government, in one night, included all castes of Muslims within the OBC coverage and allowed them to benefit from the quota. \"Is this not dacoity on OBCs&apos; claims,\" he said. Charmed by the policy of appeasement, the Samajwadi Party and the Congress think alike.\n\"The two boys (Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi) in Uttar Pradesh talk of OBCs, but really want to transfer their share to their favourite vote bank. Will you allow them to do this dishonesty,\" he said.\nThe Congress government at the Centre, before the 2012 UP Assembly elections, too decided to give a part of the OBC share to minorities. But they could not succeed in their objective. The OBCs in UP must understand this game of the SP-Congress, he said.\nThe prime minister said a new plan of the Congress-INDI alliance has come to light. This plan says \"Congress ki loot, zindagi ke saath bhi, zindagi ke baad bhi.(Congress loot, during life and after).\" The Congress leaders are quite excited about this plan, he said. Mr Modi said he was not saying this on his own; the party&apos;s top leaders, including the Congress Prince (Rahul Gandhi) are talking about this.\n\"The party wants your property investigated. The X-ray machine of the Congress Prince will reach your kitchens, your mangal-sutras, whatever gold jewellery you have, the SP-Congress alliance will take that away,\" he said.\nThe Congress-INDI scheme does not stop here, but wants to take your inheritance also. Referring to the inheritance tax proposal attributed to the Congress Party, he said \"Your parents have saved something for you. The alliance has proposed the government will take away 55 per cent of your inheritance,\" he said.\n\"Will you allow them to loot your inheritance? More than half as tax will be taken. Out of a four room flat, you will get only two rooms. Out of 10 bighas of land, only five will go to your children. Will you allow your property to go in the hands of the corrupt Hand (election symbol) of the Congress. Are you not angry yet,\" he said.\n\"Before setting their eyes on the SCs&apos;, STs&apos;, OBCs&apos; claims and mangal-sutras of sisters, they should read the writing on the wall, and hear it carefully, as long as Modi is around, you will have to face Modi before attempting this,\" he said.\nThe Prime Minister declared: \"We are determined the corrupt will be investigated, those who looted the poor, that loot money will be returned to the poor. This looted wealth is slowly coming out, in the shape of bungalows and cars, which have been seized.\"\nHe said \"The issue now is how to return this looted wealth back to the people. Modi is working hard on this. Their eyes are on the savings of mothers and sisters but I am determined to save them.\"\nThe prime minister said, \"I want your support for Viksit Bharat. Many forces don&apos;t like India&apos;s growing capacity. For example, a defence corridor is coming up here, it will help self-reliance of Indian armed forces and manufacture deadly weapons for domestic needs and exports. But defence brokers around the world who benefited by giving bribes to earlier governments are unhappy today, along with those in power who enjoyed their cuts in the defence deals.\"",

    "title": "PPD Students Hit the Road for Career Insights",
    "text": "Students enrolled in the Personal and Professional Development (PPD) program this semester got down to business by getting out of the classroom.\nThe four-credit PPD series, required for all undergraduate majors in the Sidhu School of Business and Leadership, gives students opportunities to take part in career planning, explore professional leadership and network across industries.\nAs part of the PPD program, Bridget Turel, director of professional development and external engagement, schedules a full slate of activities each year, including site visits to businesses in northeastern Pennsylvania. This semester, PPD students toured Mondelez International, AxelRad and CornellCookson. Students got a taste of the inner workings of a snack food giant, donned the gear of a local screen printer and opened the doors to an international manufacturing facility.\nThrough the visits to these three very different businesses, PPD students got a chance to see leadership in action and learn about a variety of career opportunities. “It’s a complementary part of their undergraduate education to see leaders in their field outside of the classroom, learn what they do, what their path was and how they solve problems,” said Turel.\nSatisfying Snack Attacks Around the World\nJoe Farrell ’10, who sits on the Dean’s Executive Advisory Board for the Sidhu School, serves as the director of North American customer engagement operations at Mondelez International. Farrell, along with Todd Wagaman, senior director of North American shared services, and Heidi Stecik, people lead, welcomed students and talked about their career development at the worldwide company with a goal “to empower people to snack right.”\nThe company meets its delicious mission with brands including Oreo, Cadbury, Swedish Fish, Sour Patch Kids, BelVita, Clif Bar and Ritz. From the Wilkes-Barre location, Mondelez manages the customer supply chain, keeping retailers like Target, WalMart, Amazon, Costco and Dollar General stocked. The team works to make snackers happy while also ensuring on-time deliveries, increased productivity and fewer trucks on the road.\nThe Mondelez staff in Wilkes-Barre needs talented logistics and supply chain experts to deliver delicious success, but the team also employs customer service representatives, human resources professionals and graphic designers. “There are so many opportunities locally, in the United States and globally,” said Farrell.\nWearing Their Hearts on Their Sleeves\nThe crowd was standing room only in the small conference room at AxelRad. Owner Dave Maloney welcomed PPD students to the screen-printing shop. Joining Maloney were Dennis Condusta, general production manager, and Tyler Rice, who started as a graphic design intern, but forged his own career path and now wears many hats including marketer, contract printer and IT guru.\nMaloney started his career as a therapeutic staff support (TSS) worker before cashing out his 401K to buy two pieces of equipment and start his screen-printing business in his mother’s basement. “Either you’re working for somebody or for yourself,” said Maloney.\nMaloney turned his hobby into a business, growing AxelRad from a one-person show to a shop of more than 40 employees. Condusta jokes that he plays Tetris with t-shirts, making decisions to keep materials moving in and customer orders moving out — sometimes up to 300 packages a day. But it’s his potential to impact the small business that keeps him showing up at AxelRad as opposed to a large corporation. “There’s always a next step,” said Condusta. “I could come into work today and make a change for a small business TODAY.”\nBobby Cox, a senior business management major with a minor in sports management, attended all three site visits. He was caught up in the AxelRad story, from the early days through the addition of staff and the move to the current location. “I thought it was pretty cool how the owner started the shop in his mother’s basement with just him and another employee taking risk after risk,” said Cox. He was also inspired by Maloney and the positive attitude he shares with the AxelRad team. “I thought his story was really motivating, showing that you can do anything you want as long as you work hard and keep moving forward.”\nOpening Doors to an International Business\nFocus and safety were the themes for the start of the visit to CornellCookson. The facility in Mountain Top, Pennsylvania, manufactures industrial rolling doors and grilles for companies across the United States and around the world. Mike Bogdon MBA ’08, director of manufacturing operations, gave students a glimpse at the company’s nearly 200-year history before having them put on vests, hard hats, goggles and sleeve protectors. Though the manufacturing floor requires certain precautions, Bogdon noted, “It’s poetry in motion out there.”\nOnce in safety gear, PPD students had a chance to experience the poetry of the process firsthand. Bogdon offered a step-by-step explanation of the CornellCookson’s procedures, from receiving necessary parts to putting pieces in place to adding a custom paint job and shipping the products to their final destinations including malls, theatres, parking garages and sports arenas.\nThe CornellCookson location employs approximately 300 hourly production associates and 200 support staff who work to get doors in the hands of 700 dealer partners worldwide. “Thousands of doors go out per month,” said Bogdon. And though the company has been around for nearly two centuries, there’s always something new in the works. Bogdon talked about fiber optic and CO2 lasers that will change the business, as well as an order for more than 100 doors for a Florida school district to protect against storm damage — an order that represents a year’s worth of work that will be turned around in three months. The one thing that hasn’t changed? The manufacturer’s commitment to its customers. “At the end of the day, we take pride in our quality and deliver on our promise,” said Bogdon.\nThough tours have wrapped for the fall, during the spring semester, students will have a chance to Guard Berkshire Hathaway and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders.\nGianna Manzi ’23 serves as the PPD program graduate assistant and accompanied Turel and the students on the fall site visits. Looking back on her own time as an undergrad, she sees the value in the off-campus tours for students at different stages of their academic careers. “It’s a great experience for the students and for myself,” she said. “For sophomores, they get a head-start on thinking about what they might want to do. For seniors, it helps them get more of a grasp on what they’re looking for.”\nAll business programs in the Sidhu School of Business and Leadership are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Less than 6% of the 16,000+ business programs worldwide have received [AACSB accreditation](https://www.wilkes.edu/academics/sidhu-school-of-business-leadership/accreditation/index.aspx).",

    "text": "You Can Rent Bob Dylan’s World Famous ‘Big Pink’ House In New York\nWith all the buzz surrounding the Christmas Day release of the movie 'A Complete Unknown', starring Timothy Chalamet as Bob Dylan, I was reminded that you can rent Bob Dylan's legendary Hudson Valley house. This is where Levon Helm, Robbie Robertson and the rest of Dylan's band 'The Band' band spent time, lived and created music in West Saugerties, New York in a house they nicknamed 'Big Pink'.\nGeorge Harrison, Eric Clapton and more of the world's greatest artists made their way to 56 Parnassus Lane in the late 60's to be part of the magic that was happening in and around Woodstock at that time. Specifically the magic within the walls of Big Pink.\nAccording to cbc.ca, Eric Clapton visited Big Pink with the intent to join The Band.\nThey were magnificent heroes for me, and so I went up to jam with them. I show up with all this paraphernalia on, the guys are all in work clothes, and I thought, well, are we going to jam? They said, 'We don't jam, we write songs and play the songs.' ... I thought, my God, these guys are real serious. - Clapton\nThe Band's album 'Music From Big Pink' , including the song 'The Weight', was written in this modest house wrapped in pink siding. Bob Dylan and The Band literally recorded the songs for the 1975 release 'The Basement Tapes' in the basement of Big Pink.\nToday you can actually rent Big Pink and stay in the home where these legendary artists created this timeless music. I spoke with current owner of Big Pink, Don LaSala, and he said there is still a spiritual energy that exists there to this day.

    "text": "‘Es un desastre humanitario’: el flujo migratorio desborda la frontera de EU En un lugar remoto del desierto de Arizona, cerca de una brecha que se abría en el muro fronterizo, decenas de migrantes se acurrucaban junto a unas hogueras de leña Por Natalie Kitroeff Los encuentros con migrantes vuelven a alcanzar niveles históricos y ponen a prueba la capacidad de las fuerzas de seguridad estadounidenses para contener el aumento de cruces ilegales. En un lugar remoto del desierto de [Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona), cerca de una brecha que se abría en el muro fronterizo, decenas de migrantes se acurrucaban junto a unas hogueras de leña. TE PUEDE INTERESAR: [‘Enferman’ ciberataques al sector salud en 2023](https://vanguardia.com.mx/noticias/enferman-ciberataques-al-sector-salud-en-2023-LM10580964) Tras huir de la guerra en Sudán, de bandas violentas en Centroamérica o de los cárteles mexicanos, todos habían cruzado de manera ilegal hacia Estados Unidos, caminaron a pie por terrenos accidentados durante horas y habían llegado a este punto exhaustos, hambrientos y con frío. Querían entregarse a las autoridades para pedir asilo, pero se quedaron varados aquí, a kilómetros de la ciudad más cercana, Sásabe. El martes por la noche, cuando descendieron las temperaturas, llegó un grupo de agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza, metió a los hombres en una camioneta para procesarlos y se marchó a toda velocidad, en busca de más personas que necesitaban ser rescatadas. “No estamos equipados para hacer frente a esto”, dijo Scott Carmon, comandante de guardia de la Patrulla Fronteriza, mientras revisaba el campamento. “Es un desastre humanitario”. Esta es la crisis que se está experimentando en la frontera sur, cuando los encuentros con migrantes vuelven a alcanzar niveles históricos y ponen a prueba la capacidad de las fuerzas de seguridad estadounidenses para contener un aumento de cruces ilegales con repercusiones de gran envergadura para el gobierno de Biden. Todos los días llegan a la frontera miles de migrantes procedentes de los confines del planeta, desde África a Asia y Sudamérica, impulsados por la violencia implacable, la desesperación y la pobreza. En mayo, el gobierno de Biden celebró el descenso fugaz de los cruces, incluso después de que se eliminaran las restricciones fronterizas pandémicas y mientras muchos temían que la frontera se desbordara. Pero las cifras han aumentado en los últimos meses, lo que ha generado críticas duras de los dos partidos políticos estadounidenses y temores al interior del gobierno por la posibilidad de que este tema afecte el futuro electoral de los demócratas. La semana pasada, el número de detenciones llegó a más de 10.000, una cifra que puso a prueba los recursos de la Patrulla Fronteriza y desbordó a las pequeñas ciudades de ambos lados de la frontera, por donde los traficantes han canalizado a la gente para establecer nuevas rutas para eludir la captura por parte de las autoridades de EE. UU. “En términos de flujo de migrantes por día, diciembre de 2023 es mayor que cualquier media que hayamos visto nunca”, dijo Adam Isacson, experto en migración de la Oficina en Washington para Asuntos Latinoamericanos. “Todos los funcionarios que lo comentan, a todos los niveles, dicen que están cerca o más allá del límite”. Mientras las autoridades estadounidenses seguían el trayecto de una caravana de más de 2000 migrantes que avanzaba hacia Estados Unidos a través del territorio mexicano, el secretario de Estado de EE. UU., Antony Blinken, y otros altos funcionarios viajaron a México el miércoles para hablar sobre el repunte de la migración con el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Según los expertos, es poco probable que la caravana llegue a Estados Unidos, pero ha generado atención mediática sobre los migrantes que ya han cruzado la frontera de manera masiva. México ha cumplido de manera fiel las restricciones fronterizas de EE.UU., y ha detenido a un número récord de migrantes este año, como muestran las cifras del gobierno. Pero en diciembre, el Instituto Nacional de Migración, un organismo gubernamental, suspendió las deportaciones de migrantes del país por falta de recursos, según un funcionario del instituto que no estaba autorizado a hablar públicamente. Los expertos y las autoridades aún están tratando de entender a qué se debe exactamente el reciente flujo migratorio. Entre las principales teorías están: un mayor número de mexicanos que parecen estar huyendo de las luchas territoriales de los cárteles por todo el país; rumores sobre el fin de una vía legal clave que puede haber provocado la premura por cruzar, y traficantes que han hecho que personas desesperadas de todas las nacionalidades traten de cruzar por zonas cada vez más remotas de la frontera. “Si te trasladas a un lugar remoto, no habrá muchos agentes trabajando y eso aumenta tus posibilidades de ser liberado en EE. UU.”, dijo Isacson. “No hay espacio para poner a la gente. No pueden retenerte”. El martes, Izzeddin, un migrante sudanés de 32 años, se encontraba entre una decena de hombres de su país en aquel campamento de Arizona. Sorbía café azucarado que les dio una organización humanitaria, No Más Muertes, que ha ayudado a los migrantes con mantas, alimentos y llamadas al 911 para tratar lesiones potencialmente mortales. “Venimos aquí porque necesitamos protección”, dijo Izzeddin, quien pidió que se le identificara solo por su nombre de pila, por temor a represalias contra su familia. Una cruenta guerra civil en Sudán ha expulsado a millones de personas de sus hogares, entre ellas, estos hombres, quienes dijeron que perdieron a miembros de su familia y dejaron a sus seres queridos en campos de refugiados para ir a Estados Unidos. Izzeddin dijo que, en Sudán, vio “cómo mataban y violaban a la gente”. Él y sus acompañantes, dijo, esperaban una cosa: “Que la patrulla fronteriza venga a recogernos y nos otorgue protección”. A menudo, los migrantes que llegan a Estados Unidos y solicitan asilo —protección frente a la persecución política o de otro tipo en su país de origen— no logran que sus solicitudes sean examinadas a su llegada. Debido a la capacidad limitada para detener a personas en la frontera, muchos son puestos en libertad con una cita para que un juez evalúe sus casos. El proceso puede durar años. A principios de diciembre, las autoridades fronterizas cerraron un puerto de entrada clave para los cruces legales en Arizona y así centrarse en los cruces ilegales. Carmon, comandante de guardia de la Patrulla Fronteriza, pidió más recursos. “Denos más ayuda, denos recursos de Agencia Federal para el Manejo de Emergencias”, dijo. La semana pasada, trabajadores de No Más Muertes evacuaron a migrantes atrapados en un aguacero a unas instalaciones de la Patrulla Fronteriza cercanas, dijo una portavoz del grupo. “Si tuviéramos una ciudad inundada y se tuviera que evacuar a la gente, enviarían camiones de la [Guardia Nacional](https://vanguardia.com.mx/noticias/a-dos-dias-de-inauguracion-aceleran-trabajos-para-terminar-megafarmacia-KC10568424), esos grandes camiones de ganado, y meterían en ellos a nuestros ciudadanos”, dijo Carmon. “Por qué no están aquí ayudándonos a transportar a estas personas a un lugar seguro y cálido, no lo sé”. Para Izzeddin, estar expuesto a los elementos en el desierto le parecía mucho más seguro que permanecer en Sudán. “No importa si hace frío”, dijo. “Aquí hay paz”. c. 2023 The New York Times Company",

We are also going to have partly to mostly cloudy skies on Wednesday. Partly cloudy skies and mainly dry conditions are then expected on Thursday as high pressure is going to be in control of our weather. Warmer air is also going to return to our area for these two days as highs are going to be in the 30s and low 40s. There is also going to be a breeze around on Wednesday as sustained wind speeds are going to be between 10 and 20 mph.",
