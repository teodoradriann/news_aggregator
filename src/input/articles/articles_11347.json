    "text": "ETF大爆走1／台股股災「這類型」成投資人新歡 它異軍突起挺進北美房市\n美國總統川普4月2日在白宮前展示簽署的「對等關稅」行政令，引爆全球股市股災。（圖／新華社）\n川普四月發動世界級「關稅大戰」，中國全力反制，而CTWANT整理近二周「國外成分股ETF的成交量」排行榜發現，台股投資人新歡意外「換人」，多檔陸股港股為成分股ETF交易量超越美股ETF、台股ETF，不過本周大家回神後速速挺進高股息ETF；「在美國總統川普關稅政策變數中，不確定太高。」國泰投信董事長張錫接受CTWANT採訪時說。\nCTWANT整理4月7日起至16日共八天「國外成分股」（跨國型、海外型）ETF成交量（不計入債券型、期貨型）前十名，由超過88.5萬張的00637L元大滬深300正2拔頭籌，其次依序為00665L富邦恒生國企正2、00753L中信中國50正2、00712復華富時不動產、00671R富邦NASDAQ反1、00882中信中國高股息、00650L復華香港正2、00830國泰費城半導體、00887永豐中國科技50大、00885富邦越南。\n單看陸股、港股成分股的ETF來看，前十名中即占榜六名，美股成分股ETF則有三檔，越南股市一檔；而投資北美房市為主的00712復華富時不動產異軍突起拿下第四名。\nCTWANT採訪國泰投信董事長張錫，他觀察這波股災中ETF成交爆大量，又以「高息型」台股ETF為大宗；此外，陸股、港股型又多於美股科技成分股的ETF，「對等關稅戰開打後，中國政府過去應對經驗多，且內需市場大，股市未如其他國家股市巨幅震盪，應是投資人青睞主要原因。」\n中國信託投信基金經理人陳雯卿進一步解釋，今年以來驅動陸港股漲勢的力量主要有兩個，一是Deepseek問世引發陸港科技股的資產重估，去年下半年以來陸港科技股獲利好轉，且相較歐美科技股估值仍低，因此遇到不理性的回檔，反而是投資人中長線布局的機會。\n另一個則是政策面驅動，中國政府積極透過「貨幣適度寬鬆」與財政政策發力，目的是穩定房市、股市與內需消費，而金融與內需消費正好是較不受關稅影響的產業，因此陸港股中包含科技、內需，金融與高股息等族群，仍是值得投資人關注的方向。\nCTWANT整理中國今年初的「要實施好適度寬鬆的貨幣政策」，首要保持融資和貨幣總量合理增長，運用利率、存款準備金率等多種貨幣政策工具，保持流動性充裕等，這是自2011年後事隔14年再度施行；財政擴張政策上實施提振消費行動，加大消費品以舊換新，適當提高退休人員基本養老金、城鄉居民基礎養老金和基本醫療保險財政補助標準，推動全國性生育補貼，以及高科技製造業、新基礎建設和城市更新相關投資。市場預估，此一雙寬鬆救經濟政策，新增舉債上看70兆元新台幣。\n中國信託越南機會基金經理人張晨瑋表示，美國現正與各國展開個別談判，若與越南關稅談判朝正向進展，勢必利於越股後市表現；越南基本面持續表現強勁，今年第一季經濟成長率6.93％，為2020年來最高增幅，受春節假期消費需求和國際遊客數量增加，服務業對GDP增長的貢獻率為53.7％；若美越雙方談判做出利於雙方的結論，越南關稅衝擊可望降低，或有機會重拾投資人青睞。\n川普宣布對等關稅暫緩90天後，投資國外成分股ETF短中長期該如何布局？富邦投信投資策略師徐翊達表示，川普的對等關稅掀起全球股市大地震，股價上衝下洗，近期籌碼集中的AI 供應鏈呈現多殺多現象，波動異常大且超過雙位數，可觀察到美國S&P VIX恐慌指數4月8日最高來到52.33（正常約在10～20間，指數愈高或飆破40以上，即代表美股市場愈恐慌），近期雖有回落，但仍須關注流動性問題。\n富邦投信投資策略師徐翊達表示，今年第一季因關稅政策的變數，引發投資人對美國經濟及聯準會貨幣政策的擔憂，市場避險情緒高漲，美股面臨強勁的賣壓而回落；時序第二季，在關稅政策逐漸明朗、美國企業獲利維持成長以及AI題材的發酵下，加上美股預估本益比隨著指數回落低於5年均值，美股投資機會浮現。\n展望第二季，美股的首要關注焦點為企業在面臨關稅政策下的獲利表現和財測，後續持續留意川普放鬆監管和推動製造業回流對美國經濟的影響，長期而言美股相比其他非美市場的經濟和企業獲利動能前景更佳，美股作為長期的核心資產配置，當遇短期股市逆風而回檔時，建議可適度逢回加碼或定期定額。",

    "text": "December 2023 ended up being the second-warmest ever in Cleveland. The average high temperature was 47.4 degrees, and the average low temperature was 36.6 degrees. That means the average monthly temperature for December is 42.0 degrees. That is 7.7 degrees warmer than normal, making it the second warmest December in Cleveland, tied with 1889. If you look at the calendar graphic below, you will see A LOT more red than blue boxes. Each one of those boxes shows whether that day's average temperature was above or below normal. So, there were only four days all month long that were below average in Cleveland. December also ended up with 3.33 inches of precipitation, which is pretty close to average. Typically, Cleveland sees 2.99 inches of precipitation, so that was 0.34 inches above normal. The greatest amount fell at the end of the month on Dec. 27, with 0.72 inches. As for snowfall, we were lacking quite a bit, with only 2.2 inches for the entire month. That is 10 inches below what is typical. As for the season, Cleveland has received 6.8 inches of snow. As for 2023 as a whole, we had several weather events that really stood out. From several severe weather days, tornado outbreaks, and the Canadian wildfires - the list was impressive and memorable.

Combining hand-drawn art, advanced AI, and strategic tokenomics, it is a leader in the booming AI cryptocurrency sector.\nThis unique combination takes FloppyPepe (FPPE) beyond being a meme coin to the future of digital engagement. Adding to its credibility, the meme coin has successfully passed a SolidProof audit , certifying the security and reliability of its smart contract. This seal of trust gives investors the confidence to participate in a project that prioritizes transparency and security.\nSecure A Stake In FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Future Of Meme Coins FloppyPepe (FPPE) is redefining what it means to be a meme coin by blending the artistic legacy of Matt Furie with groundbreaking AI technology. This strategic collaboration with a leading artist sets a new standard for digital collectibles, making each token a valuable piece of art. This powerful combination of hand-drawn art and advanced AI drives unprecedented interest and demand. Even renowned crypto influencer NASS CRYPTO has already spotlighted it.
