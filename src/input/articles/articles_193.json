    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "text": "Helena Oliviero | The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (TNS)\nA new report released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows gaps remain in Vaccines for Children, a federally funded program to provide free vaccines to low-income families, with lower vaccination coverage among children living in poverty remaining a persistent problem.\nThis study comes on the heels of another study by the CDC which found that over the past 30 years, routine childhood vaccinations have prevented approximately 508 million cases of illness, 32 million hospitalizations and 1.1 million deaths. But despite these substantial health benefits, attitudes toward childhood vaccinations have shifted, and they are increasingly tough sell.\nA Gallup poll published recently found that just 40% of Americans think it’s “extremely important” for children to get vaccinated, down from about 64% in 2001.\nReaching families at or below the poverty line can be even more difficult. CDC officials pointed to a lack of confidence and a lack of access to vaccines as key reasons for the lower rates among VFC eligible children. They noted vaccine uptake in the first year of life is generally higher and then falls especially among vaccinations requiring multiple doses over several years.\n“We need to do more,” said CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Debra Houry at a press briefing Tuesday. “Health care providers are our crucial partners to increase the number of children who complete their vaccine series and reach those children living below the poverty level without health insurance.”\nThe study does not include state specific information but major findings of vaccination coverage from 2012 to 2022 in the U.S. include:\n— Only 61% of children born in 2020 who were VFC-eligible received the seven vaccines known as the “combined 7-vaccine series” by their second birthday. This series includes all recommended doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) (DTaP) vaccine, polio vaccine, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the Hib vaccine protecting against Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria , the hepatitis B vaccine, chicken pox vaccine, and the a vaccine (PCV) that helps protect against bacteria that cause pneumococcal disease. Among children not VFC eligible also born in 2020, the vaccination rate for this combined 7-vaccine series was 75%.\n— About 90% of VFC-eligible children born in 2020 received at least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) vaccine. Among those not VFC eligible, coverage rate with at least one dose of MMR vaccine is about 93%.\n— Vaccination coverage was also lower among uninsured children than among Medicaid-insured children. Uninsured children are more likely to have not seen a health care provider in the past year. They are less likely to complete vaccine series that require multiple doses. The vaccination rate was about 62% for the combined 7 vaccines for those with Medicaid coverage and about 39% for those without insurance.\nHoury pointed to important steps by health care providers to help reassure families vaccines about the importance of getting the vaccine, including the following: Offering accurate information on vaccination benefits; giving catch-up vaccines and review for needed vaccines; strengthening relationships with families and setting reminders for families whose children are behind on vaccines.\nThe Vaccines for Children program supplies vaccines for free to participating providers. Children across the country can be eligible in this program aimed at helping those who would not otherwise be able to afford vaccinations. In Georgia, the vaccines are available to children up to 19 years of age who are:\n— Medicaid Enrolled\n— Uninsured (child has no health insurance coverage) or underinsured\n— is American Indian or Alaska Native\nThe Vaccines for Children program is administered nationally by CDC. The federal government purchases pediatric vaccines at a discount and ships them directly to enrolled VFC vaccine providers in Georgia and across the country. Administrative fees for administering vaccines in this program are generally covered by Medicaid.\nRelated Articles Health | US drug price measure to cut costs by $7.5 billion in 2026 Health | U.S. has lowest life expectancy among rich, English-speaking countries: study Health | Late paychecks, no raises: Union leaders say payroll problems persist for CT home care workers Health | Surgeon general hones dual focus on mental health, gun violence Health | After a stroke, this musician found his singing voice again with help from a special choir There are about 37,000 VFC providers across the country, according to CDC. In Georgia, there are 1,138 VFC providers which includes public health clinics and private practices. The number has remained steady over the past decade, according to DPH. About half the children in the U.S. receive their vaccinations through the VFC program, according to the CDC.\nOverall, vaccination rates routine childhood shots have still not returned to pre-pandemic levels, according to the CDC.\nVaccination rates in Georgia have also hovered below the national average and well below a critical threshold for keeping once-common, serious illnesses at bay, according to the most recent data available.\nIn Georgia for the 2023-2024 school year, 88% of kindergartners received routine vaccinations, which include the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine; the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine; the poliovirus (polio) vaccine; and the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine.\nFor the U.S. overall, 93% of children in kindergarten met the vaccination requirements.\nThe coverage rate for incoming kindergartners likely won’t be available for several months.\n©2024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Updated: 6:10 AM MDT Oct 11, 2024 FIESTA PARK WITH 530 JUST AROUND THE CORNER. WE ARE STARTING TO GET INTO THAT TIME OF MORNING WHERE THE CROWD JUST REALLY SWELLS HERE. YOU GOT THAT BUZZ OF EXCITEMENT AND YOU KNOW, THE DRONE SHOWS JUST ABOUT 20 MINUTES AWAY. THE PILOT BRIEFING SHORTLY AFTER THAT. THEN DAWN PATROL GOES UP. IT’S ABOUT TO GO DOWN HERE. AND I THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER REAL GOOD MORNING SO FAR. WE ARE SIX FOR SIX HERE AT FIESTA AND TODAY IS LIKELY GOING TO MAKE IT SEVEN FOR SEVEN. THE FORECAST HERE AT BALLOON FIESTA PARK GOT THAT EARLY MORNING NUMBER RIGHT AROUND 50 DEGREES FOR A FEW HOURS. I DO NEED TO DRESS FOR THE CHILL TO KIND OF SETTLE INTO YOUR BODY A LITTLE BIT. IF YOU’RE GOING TO COME ON DOWN, BUT I THINK THE WINDS WILL BE FRIENDLY FOR FLYING LESS THAN THAT 7 OR 8 MILE PER HOUR THRESHOLD. NOW THIS EVENING, SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY, IT JUST LOOKS QUIET AND QUITE DELIGHTFUL, TEMPERATURES GRADUALLY DROPPING DOWN THROUGH THE 70S. PROBABLY FINE TO BE IN SHORT SLEEVES HERE AT BALLOON FIESTA PARK. IT’S NOT OFTEN WE SAY THAT IN OCTOBER, RIGHT? HERE’S A LOOK AT FORECAST CONDITIONS AROUND THE REST OF THE STATE FOR THE AFTERNOON. WE EXPECT 70, 80 AND 90 DEGREE HIGHS. OBVIOUSLY WARMER THE FURTHER YOU HEAD SOUTH THESE NUMBERS CLOSE TO RECORD VALUES JUST A LITTLE PATCHY. CLOUD COVER DRIFTS IN FROM THE NORTH AND WEST. LOWS TONIGHT 40S AND 50S WITH A CLEAR OR MOSTLY CLEAR SKY. SATURDAY AFTER ANOTHER PROBABLY FRIENDLY MORNING FOR FLYING THE AFTERNOON HAS A CHALLENGING RECORD HIGHS AGAIN WITH DRY AND MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. LITTLE CHANGE SUNDAY SUNDAY MORNING OF COURSE, WE WRAP UP FIESTA AND I THINK WE’LL GET THE BALLOONS IN THE AIR. ONE FINAL TIME. THERE’S A HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT WE GO NINE FOR NINE IN THIS YEAR’S FIESTA, AND SUNDAY WE’RE BACK UP NEAR RECORD HIGHS AGAIN ACROSS THE STATE. HERE IS YOUR FORECAST ACROSS NORTHWEST NEW MEXICO FOR THE FOUR CORNERS AREA. WE EVENTUALLY ARE IN FOR A TEMPERATURE DROP, BUT TODAY IT’S LOWER 80S AND WE KEEP IT IN THE LOWER 80S INTO THE WEEKEND. AS WE HEAD INTO NEXT WEEKEND, DROP THE NUMBERS SLIGHTLY. THERE ARE DAYS LIKE MONDAY, MAYBE WEDNESDAY WHERE WE COULD HAVE A COUPLE OF ISOLATED SHOWERS IN THE AREA. HERE’S A LOOK RIGHT NOW AT SOUTHWEST NEW MEXICO. NO LONGER TALKING ABOUT A SLIGHT CHANCE AT RAIN. WE’RE BRIGHT. WE ARE WARM. WE’VE GOT 80S AND 90S OFF THE MOUNTAINS AND WE KEEP IT WAY WARM INTO AND THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND ONLY SLIGHTLY DROP THE NUMBERS NEXT WEEK. NOW THE COOLDOWN IS GOING TO BE MORE DRAMATIC IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE STATE. THIS IS SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO, AND WE ARE WELL INTO THE 90S TODAY, TOMORROW, AND SATURDAY WE ARE CHALLENGING RECORD HIGHS. BEFORE WE DO DROP THE NUMBERS INTO NEXT WEEK. BUT EVEN AT THAT DROP IN THE NUMBERS NEXT WEEK, WE CONTINUE TO STAY ABOVE AVERAGE IN NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO. WHAT A WEATHER FRIENDLY DAY WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES REAL CLOSE TO 80 DEGREES IN LAS VEGAS. AND YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE A COOLDOWN COMING NEXT WEEK. NOTHING TOO STRONG OR SEVERE. AND YOU KNOW, RAIN CHANCES REALLY DON’T LOOK THAT GREAT WITH THE COOLDOWN. UNFORTUNATELY, UP AROUND NORTH CENTRAL NEW MEXICO, IT’S HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE 70S OR EVEN 80S IN THE ESPANOLA VALLEY, RUNNING WAY WARM FOR THE TIME OF YEAR AND WE’LL KEEP THOSE HIGHS IN SANTA FE UP AROUND 80 UNTIL MAYBE SUNDAY OR MONDAY, WHEN WE DROP OFF A LITTLE BIT NEXT WEEK. NOT EYEING UP MUCH OF A RAIN CHANCE. SO WITH THAT COOL DOWN AND YOU KNOW, FOR THE ALBUQUERQUE METRO, THIS WILL BE THE SECOND DAY IN A ROW WITH A FORECAST HIGH TEMPERATURE AT 86 AT THE SUNPORT UPPER 80S TO THE RIVER VALLEY. RECORD HIGHS 88. AND THAT’S JUST OUT OF REACH FROM BEING TIED. YESTERDAY. WE DID TIE THE RECORD AT 86. NOW ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WE ARE WITHIN LIKE 1 OR 2 OF THOSE RECORD HIGHS. SO IT CONTINUES TO STAY VERY WARM. NOW THE COOLDOWN COMING NEXT WEEK. NOT AS POWERFUL AS WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT. WE DO EVENTUALLY TRIM THOSE HIGHS INTO THE VERY UPPER 70S, BUT THAT’S STILL ALMOST TEN DEGREES ABOVE AVERAGE AND SO NO END IN SIGHT TO THIS WARM RUN OF TEMPERATURES AND ALSO, SADLY, NO END IN SIGHT TO THIS DRY RUN OF DAYS.

    "text": "MONTREAL – A 19-year-old man has been charged in the firebombing of a Montreal-area synagogue in December.\nMohamed Ilyess Akodad faces two arson-related charges, two counts of attempted arson, one count of destruction of property and one count of possession of incendiary material.\nThe charges relate to a Dec. 18 fire at the Congregation Beth Tikvah in a suburb of Montreal, which caused minor damage to the synagogue.\nPolice at the time reported broken glass and damage to the door of the synagogue, as well as smoke damage, and a smashed glass door at the nearby offices of Federation CJA, a Jewish community group.\nThe incident in Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Que., was widely condemned, including by then prime minister Justin Trudeau, who called it “a vile antisemitic attack against Montreal’s Jewish community.”\nAkodad pleaded not guilty during a virtual appearance at the Montreal courthouse on Wednesday, and is scheduled to appear again on Thursday to discuss next steps.\nThe Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs welcomed news of the arrest.\n“Now, it is up to prosecutors to responsibly proceed with this case focused on maximizing its deterrent effect,” said Eta Yudin, the organization’s vice-president for Quebec “It must be made clear that the hateful targeting of the Jewish community has serious consequences.”\nMontreal police say the suspect was arrested in the Montreal borough of Anjou, and investigators seized evidence during a search of a home.\nThey say the investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is invited to contact police.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 9, 2025.",

    "text": "E n un partido de puro Playoffs, el Mónaco ganó en Estambul, 62-65 , y mandó la serie al quinto partido. Por segundo año consecutivo los Playoffs de la Euroliga vivirán tres eliminatorias hasta el límite del último choque. Mónaco recibirá al Fenerbahce en su casa el próximo miércoles a partir de las 19.00 horas.\nFue un partido de poder a poder. No atractivo en cuanto a rapidez y juego en ataque como había pasado en los anteriores , pero muy intenso y muy trabado. tanto que el marcador es más propios del baloncesto europeo de los años 90 de equipos como el Limoges, que jugaba a no pasar de los 60 puntos.\nLa igualda en el partido fue tal que las máximas fueron para el Fenerbahce de 8 puntos , y muy pronto con un 12-4, y para el Mónaco de 4, al inicio con el 0-4. Luego, todo el partido se mantuvo el marcador comprimido hasta los minutos finales con los monegascos controlando más las emociones.\nNinguno de los dos equipos alcanzó los 20 puntos en un cuarto: 15-11 en el primero, 18-19 en el segundo, con 33-30 al descanso, 14-18 en el tercero y 15-17 en el cuarto. En el tramo final pudo ganar cualquiera. Con 57-58 a 1:27 para el final Okobo perdió un balón que Guduric se disponía a convertir en canasta para los turcos hasta que apareció Hall para negarlo con un tapón.\nLuego llegó el triple de Mike James (57-61 a 58 segundos para el final) . El máximo anotador en la historia de la Euroliga había metido siete puntos muy pronto para luego desaparecer... hasta canasta tan decisiva. Wilbekin descontó con dos tiros libres, 59-61 , pero luego Hall dio más ventaja al Mónaco tras una mala defensa del Fenerbahce.\nAsí fue la trifulca final en Estambul en el Fenerbahce - Mónaco A 21 segundos para el final, Guduric anotó un tremendo triple que encendió el pabellón y a los ruidosos aficionados turcos. Aún tendría tiempo el Mónaco de cometer un grave error en un saque de banda, violación de cinco segundos, que puso en bandeja el triunfo del Fenerbahce. Pero Wilbekin falló a seis segundos para el final y Hall, con un mate en pleno caos en la pista, selló el triunfo del Mónaco.\nAl final del partido hubo incluso conato de invasión, l anzamiento de objetos y problemas para el Mónaco de ganar el túnel de vestuarios. Habrá quinto y será otra épica batalla.",
