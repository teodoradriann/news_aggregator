Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed.\n– Bedfordshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3\n– British Transport Police\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22\n– Cambridgeshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5\nThe force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime.\n– Dorset\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1\n– Durham\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1\nThe force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam.\n– Gloucestershire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nThe force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”.\n– Greater Manchester\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34\nThe force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish.

Four crimes within the data had both Jewish and Muslim recorded as the perceived targeted religion.\n– Gwent\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3\nThe force said that to obtain the data a filter was applied to identify racial and religious strands and a manual trawl was conducted on the crime summaries.\n– Hampshire & Isle of Wight\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 5, 2023 – 6\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 4\n– Hertfordshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 17\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nThe force said the figures are for crimes that have a “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” (or both) flag attributed to the investigation record.\n– Humberside\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 2\n– Kent\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 6\nThe force said the figures are for crime reports with either the “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” prejudice marker attached.

The search only returned exact matches and does not account for differences in terminology and/or spelling used. The force added that keyword searches are problematic and in no way provide accurate results or figures.\n– Northumbria\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 10, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 9\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 7, 2023 – 5\nThe force said the figures were for offences flagged as “Judaism” and “Islam” and that hate crimes are based on the perception of the victim.\n– Nottinghamshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – under 5, 2023 – 19\nThe force said all crimes have a religious and/or belief marker.\n– South Wales\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 8\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 7, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 9\nThe force said the figures are for occurrences with the qualifier of “Hate/prejudice – anti-Jewish” and “Hate/prejudice anti-Muslim”.\n– Suffolk\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 0\n– Surrey\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 10\nThe force noted that offences are flagged as hate crimes at the discretion of the police officer or staff member.\n– Thames Valley\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 21\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 12, 2022 – 14, 2023 – 20\n– Warwickshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nIslamophobic: No information held\nThe force said the figures were obtained by searching for all crimes with a marker of “Hate Motivated – Religion – Jewish” and “Hate Motivated – Religion – Muslim” during the stated periods.\n– West Mercia\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 4\n– West Midlands\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 22\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 23, 2022 – 33, 2023 – 25\nThe force said the figures were obtained by searching for the hate strands “Religion – Judaism” and “Religion – Islam”.\n– West Yorkshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 10, 2023 – 53\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 38, 2022 – 29, 2023 – 49\nThe force said the figures represent the number of faith hate crimes recorded where Islam or Judaism was identified as the religion targeted.

The rankings are based on several factors including access to education, continuation, and the outcomes of undergraduate students from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\"Higher education is a great driver in improving social mobility and we pride ourselves on helping people to flourish in education no matter what their age or background.\"\n— Vice-Chancellor Professor Graham Baldwin\nUniversity of Central Lancashire Vice-Chancellor Professor Graham Baldwin said: “Higher education is a great driver in improving social mobility and we pride ourselves on helping people to flourish in education no matter what their age or background.\"\nAs an open and accessible institution, the University works with a variety of schools, colleges and community groups every year on exciting and interactive widening participation initiatives to inspire people who may never otherwise consider applying to university.\nIt also offers a number of medical scholarships to students from backgrounds that are under-represented in higher education and financial assistance to care experienced and estranged students and young carers.\n\"The 2024 English Higher Education Social Mobility Index highlights once again that universities up and down the country are breaking down barriers to opportunity. \"\n— Professor David Phoenix, Vice-Chancellor of LSBU, who compiles the Index for HEPI\nProfessor David Phoenix, Vice-Chancellor of LSBU, who compiles the Index for HEPI, said: “The 2024 English Higher Education Social Mobility Index highlights once again that universities up and down the country are breaking down barriers to opportunity.\n“The new Secretary of State for Education, Bridget Phillipson MP, has been clear that she expects higher education providers to play a stronger role in expanding and improving outcomes for disadvantaged students. I hope, therefore, that the Index provides a useful for tool for universities across the sector.\n“Institutions making a strong impact on social mobility can use it to evidence their contribution while those universities that wish to increase their support for disadvantaged students can use it help identify good practice and to work out the most appropriate way of doing so in accordance with their institutional mission.”\n\"Breaking the link between where a young person goes up, and the opportunities they have, is central to our mission.\"\n— The Secretary of State for Education, Bridget Phillipson\nThe Secretary of State for Education, Bridget Phillipson, added: “Despite growing up in a deeply disadvantaged area I had the opportunity to go to university – but I was one of the lucky ones. Breaking the link between where a young person goes up, and the opportunities they have, is central to our mission.\n“Following the recent measures taken to stabilise universities, we will now demand more from the sector through far-reaching reform – including opening up access to working-class young people.\n“We are committed to restoring universities as engines of opportunity, growth and aspiration. We will fix the foundations of higher education to deliver change for students.”\nMore information about the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) 2024 English Social Mobility Index is [available online.](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/2024/12/03/social-mobility-index-2024/)",
