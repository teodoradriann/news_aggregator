    "text": "- India\nInternational\n2017 Lucknow case: Gangster, 7 aides get life term for oil trader murder\nThe trader allegedly faced threats from gangster Akeel Ansari who warned him not to pursue his son’s murder case\nA CBI court in Lucknow on Thursday sentenced gangster Akeel Ansari and seven of his associates to life imprisonment for their alleged involvement in the murder of a Lucknow-based oil trader in February 2017.\nIt was alleged that Shrawan Sahu (55), the trader, faced threats from gangster Akeel Ansari, who had warned him not to pursue the murder case of his son Ayush Sahu (26) who was shot dead outside a beer shop in 2013.\nAnsari was the prime accused in Ayush’s murder.\nIn 2020, a court in\nLucknow had sentenced Ansari and his associate Azeem Khan, alias Babu to life imprisonment for Ayush’s murder.\nAfter Shrawan refused to comply with the gangster’s instructions, he was shot dead by two assailants at his residence in the Saadatganj area of Lucknow, it was alleged. He had sustained five bullets.\nEight persons, including Ansari, were booked in connection with the murder. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) took over the investigation on the recommendation of the state government.\nOn Thursday, the court found Ansari, Satyam Patel, Azeem Khan, Aman Singh, Vivek Verma, Ajay Patel, Rohit Mishra, and Faisal guilty under Sections 302 (murder) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. Aman, Vivek, Ajay, Rohit, Azeem and Faisal, who were out on bail, were taken into custody. Ansari and Satyam Patel were already in jail.\nAshish Kumar Saxena, senior public prosecutor for the CBI, said the court examined 51 prosecution witnesses and reviewed 101 documentary exhibits, 51 material exhibits during the trial. Seven defence witnesses were also examined by the court, he added.\nAccording to the prosecution, it was found during the investigation that Ansari initially threatened Shrawan to dissuade him from pursuing his son’s murder case.\nAnsari then tried to frame Sahu in a false criminal case to exert pressure on him. When even this didn’t work, Ansari then orchestrated Sahu’s murder with the help of his associates, it was alleged.\nFive days before eliminating Sahu, Ansari surrendered before a court in another case to evade police suspicion and that his associates executed the murder when he himself was behind bars, it was claimed.\nThe CCTV cameras installed at Sahu’s shop played a crucial role in identifying the assailants, the investigators said. It was found that Sahu’s murder was premeditated with a thorough reconnaissance conducted by the accused.\nIn the Ayush murder case, the police had filed charges against Akeel and his associate Azeem alias Baba. In January 2017, a case was filed against Shrawan, accusing him of hiring shooters to kill Akeel. But during the investigation, these allegations were found to be baseless and a closure report was filed, according to the prosecuting officer.\nAfter filing chargesheet, the CBI had recommended a departmental inquiry against the then Lucknow Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Manzil Saini, alleging negligence in the Shrawan murder case. But an inquiry panel formed by the state government this year to probe the allegations against Saini gave him a clean chit, sources said.\nClick here to join The Indian Express on WhatsApp and get latest news and updates\n5% of the total seats will remain vacant St Stephen's College has exceeded its sanctioned number of seats by 5%, with the addition of a 'single girl child' quota.

    "title": "BJP says ‘Congress hates Muslims’ after MLA claimed harassment over religion",
    "text": "Baba Siddique is a former minister. His son Zeeshan Siddique won his first election in 2019\nMumbai: Congress MLA Zeeshan Siddique, who was sacked as the president of the Mumbai Youth Congress earlier this week, has claimed he was being harassed within the party because he is a Muslim. The MLA from Vandre East is the son of Baba Siddique, who recently quit the Congress joined Ajit Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party. Reacting to the remarks, the BJP said ‘Congress hates Muslims.\nAt a press conference on Thursday, he said the Congress had the worst form of communalism among all his parties. “I won’t say I will remain in the Congress, but I will discuss my political options with my supporters (first),” he said.\nZeeshan Siddique said he communicated to the party that his father’s exit shouldn’t have a bearing on his association with the Congress.\n“I have been repeatedly saying that even though my father Baba Siddique joined the NCP, I will remain with the Congress, but still action was taken against me,” he said.\nHe claimed he bagged 90 percent votes in the election for the Mumbai Youth Congress president’s post but the party took nine months to appoint him to the post.\n“I was harassed a lot because I am a Muslim,” he said.\nHe said Muslims have no place in the Congress.\n“In Mumbai and Karnataka, two Muslim candidates won Youth wing elections but it took nearly a year for them to get the post in both cases,” he said. Zeeshan also said he felt bad about the Congress being in alliance with the Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray (as part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi), when Thackeray, at a solidarity rally of the alliance in Mumbai, praised the demolition of Babri mosque. Rahul Gandhi was doing good work but his team was ‘extremely corrupt,” he alleged.\nHe also claimed that Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge is not allowed to work freely in the copy.\n“Mallikarjun Kharge is such a senior leader but even his hands are tied. Rahul Gandhi is doing his job but it looks as if people around him have taken a ‘supari’ (contract) from other parties to finish off the Congress,” he alleged.\nBJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla said Zeeshan Siddique’s allegation has proved that the Congress uses the minorities for vote bank politics.\n“Today Zeeshan Siddiqui has spilled out the beans which was told by me six-seven years ago that Congress is the most anti-Muslim party. It may project for the vote bank and for appeasement’s sake that it is with the minorities. But actually, it has done the most damage to minorities. Today Zeeshan Siddiqui is facing it himself. We have seen that Congress allowed riot after riot to be orchestrated.
