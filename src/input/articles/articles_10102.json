    "text": "Gaza City: Hamas has officially announced its intention to dispatch a delegation to Cairo in a bid to advance mediated negotiations. Leading the delegation will be Khalil al-Hayya, a prominent figure within the group, Al Jazeera reported.\nThe statement released by Hamas reiterated the organisation's positive stance towards the proposed negotiations.\n\"We are going to Cairo in the same spirit to reach an agreement. We in Hamas and the Palestinian resistance forces are determined to achieve an agreement that fulfils our people's demands for a complete cessation of the aggression, the withdrawal of the occupation forces, the return of the displaced, relief and reconstruction, and a serious exchange deal,\" a statement said, according to Al Jazeera.\nMeanwhile, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre conveyed Washington's apprehensions to Israel regarding potential major military operations in the southern city of Rafah. Jean-Pierre emphasised the importance of safeguarding the lives of civilians, particularly the 1.5 million individuals residing in Rafah.\n\"We want to make sure their lives are protected,\" Jean-Pierre stated during a press briefing. \"We believe the Israeli government is going to take our concerns into account.\"\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged both Israel and Hamas to prioritise reaching an agreement, citing the high stakes involved. In a post on X, Guterres emphasised the necessity of a negotiated settlement to prevent further escalation of the conflict.\n\"For the sake of the people of Gaza, the hostages and their families, and the region and the wider world - I strongly encourage the government of Israel and Hamas leadership to reach an agreement in their negotiations,\" Guterres posted on X.\nAccording to reports, at least 34,622 Palestinians have been killed and 77,867 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7. The death toll in Israel resulting from Hamas's October 7 attacks stands at 1,139, with numerous individuals still held captive, Al Jazeera reported.",

Because who wouldn’t want to dodge yet another bullet when the weather gets colder and the sniffles start proliferating like it’s the latest TikTok trend?\nAiming for the Stars—Or At Least for a Safer Winter! With these doses flying out faster than hotcakes on a Sunday morning, Ocotlán is on track to hit its ambitious target of immunizing a significant portion of the population.

It’s fantastic to ​have you here today. Let’s dive right in. Can you tell us how the vaccination ⁤campaign in Ocotlán ​has been going so far?\n**Mariana Chávez:** Thank you for having me! It’s been an incredible journey. Since⁤ we kicked off ‍the campaign, we’ve administered ‍over 2,800 ⁤doses of the influenza vaccine, prioritizing our⁤ most vulnerable‌ populations—older⁤ adults, ​young children under five, and individuals with chronic illnesses. It’s truly heartwarming to see so many people stepping⁣ up for their health!\n**Interviewer:** That’s impressive! I understand that you’ve been quite proactive with your vaccination brigades.⁤ Could you explain what that entails?\n**Mariana Chávez:** Absolutely! Our ‍vaccination brigades are like health ninjas! They go out to workplaces and communities, making it easy for people to receive the flu shot without having to visit the health center. This approach helps us meet the demand swiftly and effectively, ensuring that workers ⁢can get vaccinated even during their lunch‌ breaks.\n**Interviewer:** It sounds like you’re creating a⁢ really accessible environment for ‌vaccinations. Are‍ these services only available ‌to certain groups, or can anyone ⁤get vaccinated?\n**Mariana Chávez:** While our main focus is on priority groups, the campaign is open to everyone! Anyone interested in receiving the‌ flu vaccine can simply walk in and⁤ request it. We believe that protecting​ our community against influenza ​is a collective ⁣effort, and‍ everyone is welcome!\n**Interviewer:** That’s reassuring to know! With flu‍ season upon us, how important do you think this campaign ‌is?\n**Mariana Chávez:** It’s absolutely crucial! ⁤The cold season increases the risk ⁤of influenza infections, ‍especially for those with weakened immune systems. By vaccinating a significant portion of the population, we⁢ can reduce the chances of‍ serious complications that could lead to hospitalizations. It’s all about protecting public health and keeping our community safe.\n**Interviewer:** Alongside the ‌flu vaccine, you mentioned there’s also⁤ the Pneumococcus 13 vaccine available. How does that ‍fit ⁢into the picture?\n**Mariana Chávez:** Yes! We have the Pneumococcus​ 13 vaccine⁢ available for individuals over 18. This vaccine protects ​against various serotypes of pneumonia that⁤ can⁢ severely affect the ⁢respiratory system. Getting vaccinated against both influenza and pneumonia is an excellent way to bolster one’s health during this vulnerable⁤ season.\n**Interviewer:** It sounds like your campaign is well-rounded and comprehensive. What’s‌ the ultimate goal for your vaccination efforts?\n**Mariana Chávez:** Our goal is to immunize as many people as possible before respiratory disease season peaks. Last year, we administered over 6,000 vaccines between October and February, and we hope to exceed that⁢ this time around. The more people vaccinated, ‍the better the community’s defense against the‌ flu!\n**Interviewer:** Thank you, Mariana,⁣ for shedding light on this vital campaign! It’s inspiring to ‌hear how dedicated you and your team are to ensuring the ⁤health of​ Ocotlán.\n**Mariana Chávez:** Thank‌ you for ⁤helping us⁢ spread the word!

    "text": "Chinese agricultural scientists are developing new strains of protein-rich corn that can serve as a substitute for soybeans in animal feed, a potential game-changer for China’s drive to reduce its reliance on overseas grain.\\nChina has been forced to import soybeans in huge quantities in recent years to fuel its expanding livestock industry, as Chinese consumers adopt an increasingly meat and dairy-heavy diet.\\nBeijing sees the growing dependence on foreign agricultural products as a threat to the nation’s food security, as well as a potential issue of contention amid an intensifying trade war with the United States.\\nDeveloping higher-protein corn to replace soybeans in animal feed is seen as a potential solution, and researchers at China’s Huazhong Agricultural University have already developed several promising varieties, according to the university’s president.\\nGiven China’s vast corn production, an improvement of just one percentage point in the protein content of the grain could reduce China’s demand for foreign soybeans by up to 8 million tonnes, Yan Jianbing, Huazhong’s president, told reporters during last week’s “two sessions” – the annual meeting of China’s top legislative and consultative bodies.\\nChina has been placing increasing emphasis on food security amid a rise in geopolitical tensions and uncertainties in the international market.\\nChina’s soybean imports account for about 60 per cent of the world’s total trade volume for the grain, and the US has long been one of the country’s largest suppliers alongside Brazil.\\nThis dependence on American soybeans has been a double-edged sword for Beijing. In the past, it has weaponised the trade by threatening to reduce purchases of US grain, hurting the incomes of farmers in the Midwest.\\nJust this month, China slapped tariffs on US agricultural products – including soybeans – in retaliation for Washington’s hike in duties on Chinese goods.\\nBut its reliance on US grain is also a potential strategic weakness, and China has been steadily moving to diversify its soybean supply in recent years. The US now accounts for more than one-fifth of Chinese imports, down from nearly 40 per cent a decade ago.\\n\\n\\n<img src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Tiltz/full.png\" alt=\"\" />\\n\\n“Last year, China’s total corn production reached 290 million tonnes. If the protein content of corn increases by one percentage point, it could add 2.9 million tonnes of protein annually,” Yan said.\\nYan’s team has developed multiple high-protein corn varieties that have achieved an average protein content of 10 per cent, which is two percentage points higher than that of regular corn, he said.\\nMore than 10 million mu (667,000 hectares) of the new corn has already been planted, Yan added.\\nTraditionally, corn has served as the primary energy source in animal feed, while soybean meal has been the main source of protein.\\nChina’s soybean imports reached 105 million tonnes last year, with the majority being used as protein feed for livestock and poultry, according to Chinese customs data.\\nTo replace these imports with domestically grown soybeans, China would need to add 70 to 80 million mu of farmland, an impractical proposition in a nation of 1.4 billion people where land is a precious resource, Yan said.\\nChina has prioritised maintaining self-sufficiency in staple grains like rice and wheat, where it boasts world-leading production technology. But the per unit yields of its corn and soybeans are only 60 per cent of those in the US, according to figures frequently cited by Chinese officials.\\nDespite this, China’s minister of agriculture, Han Jun, stated during the two sessions that China “has entered the top tier of global agricultural innovation”, with agricultural technology contributing over 63 per cent of China’s overall productivity growth last year.\\n“The fundamental solution to the issue of food is technology,” he said in a group interview over the weekend.\\nIn his government work report last week, Premier Li Qiang set a target for China to produce 700 million tonnes of grain this year and to continue focusing on improving yields and quality.\\nChina managed to reach this milestone last year, reporting a record high grain output of 706.5 million tonnes.\\n",

    "text": "Bitcoin whales have been aggressively accumulating the flagship cryptocurrency, to the point that new whale wallets now hold 9.3% of the cryptocurrency total supply valued ar around $132 billion. That’s according to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, firstshared by its CEO Ki Young Ju, who noted that these new whale wallets now hold 1.97 million BTC after their BTC balanced surged a whopping 813% year-to-date. Each of these wallets, Ki Young Ju detailed, has over 1,000 BTC and an average coin age below 155 days. These wallets include custodial wallets and those of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were launched in January, but exclude exchanges and miners. CryptoQuant’s CEO added that the numbers “seemed unrealistically high” and that the figures are “like institutional investors acquiring an additional 8.2% stake in a company named Bitcoin within a year.” S CryptoGlobe reported, a cryptocurrency analyst has recently predicted that Bitcoin’s price could surge to a staggering $233,000 by the first quarter of 2025, based on a key technical indicator that BTC’s current consolidation phase could lead to a massive price increase. The analyst suggested that there’s a historical correlation between Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) peaks and the cryptocurrency’s price rises. Comparing current RSI levels to those of previous bull markets, he concluded [BTC could top $233,000 in Q1 2025.](https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/10/key-technical-indicator-suggests-bitcoin-price-could-skyrocket-to-233000-by-early-2025/) Bitcoin is at the time of writing trading at $67,000 after moving up significantly over the past week. Data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, as reported, shows that Bitcoin [reserves on exchanges recently hit an all-time low](https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/10/holders-hodling-bitcoin-exchange-reserves-hit-new-low-as-long-term-btc-accumulation-grows/) of 2.6 million BTC, down from over 3.3 million seen nearly three years ago. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin network has remained active, with high levels of transaction volume and address usage as long-term holders keep on accumulating, while short-term holders “show sign of selling.” Lower Bitcoin reserves on exchanges suggest that available supply on the market is dropping, which means that the price of the cryptocurrency could rise if demand remains steady, or if it increases.

    "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Marc Chaikin Bullish On AI-Enhanced Software Companies, Forecasts S&P 500 Rally To Continue Into 2024 - Top World News Today",
    "text": "Legendary investor & founder of Chaikin Analytics, Marc Chaikin remains bullish on a specific investment theme: companies utilizing AI to enhance productivity in their software. Chaikin sees these AI-driven companies as the ones to watch, especially as earnings season unfolds . These and other valuable insights from Chaikin and his outlook for 2024 were shared in an exclusive interview with the Benzinga PreMarket Prep team. January has particularly sparked Chaikin’s optimism, owing to forthcoming earnings reports. He observes an intriguing pattern: when the initial five days of the year exhibit a rising trend, it often indicates that around 25% of the year could see positive results. This ‘seasonality trade,’ initiated towards the end of November, has already proven beneficial for investors who have adopted a bullish approach. Chaikin foresees the market’s current strength carrying through to 2024, and anticipates any pullback in the S&P 500 to be modest, in the range of 1.5% to 3% during the rally. While the end of the year witnessed some profit-taking in the “Magnificent 7,” the overall market rally is broadening. Also Read: ‘Magnificent 7’ Widens Gap With Rest Of S&P 500, But That May Change In 2024 In terms of sectors, Chaikin highlights the importance of tech, emphasizing that companies leveraging AI for software productivity will likely fare well. Specific stocks such as ServiceNow Inc NOW , Synopsys Inc SNPS , Pure Storage Inc PSTG and Procore Technologies Inc PCOR stand out. Pure Storage has a partnership with NVIDIA Corp NVDA for Flash storage. Procore Technologies is a competitor to Autodesk Inc ADSK and is integrating AI into their software. Chaikin also points to what he called “secondary tech stocks” like Arista Networks Inc ANET and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc CRWD as potential winners in the coming months. A key insight from Chaikin is the ongoing productivity cycle driven by AI. He projects the S&P 500 possibly reaching 5800 to 6000 in the next year, contingent on a change in interest rates, which he identifies as the real driver in the stock market. Areas to watch include financials, consumer discretionary, and industrials, while caution is advised for energy and mega-cap tech, with a preference for specialty tech. In the semiconductor realm, Chaikin singles out Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD as his pick, expressing confidence in its prospects. As the bond market takes the lead, Chaikin warns of a potential sell-off if the Federal Reserve doesn’t cut rates in March.

    "text": "New Haven resident Tyjon Preston pleaded guilty to a racketeering offense related to his role in the violent Exit 8 street gang within the city, the US Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut announced on Thursday, April 25.\nAccording to federal officials, Preston's guilty plea followed an effort to address violence in New Haven that involved an investigation into an ongoing gang war between members and associates of the Exit 8 street gang and rival gangs in the city's Hill section.\nThe investigation determined that members of the Exit 8 gang, named after the geographic area by Exit 8 of Interstate 91 in New Haven, engaged in drug trafficking, used and shared guns, and committed at least three murders and 16 attempted murders since June 2018. Gang members would also steal vehicles, sometimes from outside of Connecticut, and use them when committing acts of violence, officials said.\nOne of these alleged incidents happened in August 2020, when Preston helped steal a Cadillac Escalade from a Westport driveway on Richmondville Avenue. He was later arrested following a police pursuit, according to Westport Police.\nOn Wednesday, April 24, Preston pleaded guilty to conspiracy to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity and admitted to his role in:\n- Attempting to kill a rival gang member and shooting him in the leg with other Exit 8 members on April 27, 2021;\n- Conspiring to kill rival gang members with other Exit 8 members, including one who was shot and killed on May 19, 2021, by another member;\n- Shooting and attempting to kill rival gang members with other Exit 8 members on May 20, 2021;\n- Shooting and killing a 22-year-old woman on July 5, 2021, after she made a rap song with derogatory comments about Exit 8.\nWhen he is sentenced, Preston faces a maximum term of life in prison. Under the terms of a binding plea deal though, all parties have agreed that a sentence of between 22 and 30 years is appropriate if accepted by the court.\nPreston has been in prison since May 22, 2021.\n[Click here]\nto follow Daily Voice\nNew Haven\nand receive free news updates.",
