    "text": "Argentine Rugbymen inculpés de viol : leur avocat confiant en une libération « rapide » Les deux rugbymen français accusés de viols et violences sur une femme en Argentine lors d'une tournée du XVde France ont été auditionnés jeudi. Leur avocat a déposé une demande de libération. L'avocat argentin des rugbymen français inculpés de viol en Argentine s'est dit jeudi « confiant », après leurs auditions, qu'ils vont « rapidement retrouver la liberté », et a déposé une demande en ce sens. « Nous sentons la liberté, nous sommes convaincus qu’ils vont retrouver rapidement la liberté » a déclaré à la presse Me Rafael Cuneo Libarona, à l'issue de plus de cinq heures de dépositions d'Hugo Auradou, puis d'Oscar Jegou, au pole judiciaire de Mendoza (ouest). Les dépositions, recueillies par le procureur de l'Unité des délits sexuels, Dario Nora, en présence des avocats des deux parties, étaient leur première sur le fond, depuis leur arrestation le 8 juillet puis leur inculpation. La plaignante déjà entendue Auradou et Jegou, 21 ans tous les deux, [sont inculpés de viol aggravé car en réunion dans la nuit du 6 au 7 juillet sur une Argentine de 39 ans](/sport/2024/07/11/affaire-jegou-auradou-les-deux-joueurs-accuses-de-viol-transferes-a-mendoza), dans un hôtel de Mendoza, à mille kilomètres de Buenos Aires, où le XV de France venait de disputer un test-match contre l'Argentine. La plaignante, qui a déjà été entendue, dit s'être rendue avec l'un des joueurs, rencontré en boîte de nuit, dans sa chambre d'hôtel, puis y avoir subi viols et violences par l'un et l'autre joueur, revenu plus tard. Son avocate évoque des preuves « fortes », [en particulier des lésions constatées](/sport/2024/07/11/affaire-jegou-auradou-l-avocate-detaille-la-violence-terrible-du-viol-presume). Pour sa part, l'avocat de la défense se dit depuis le début [« confiant » de l'innocence des joueurs](/faits-divers-justice/2024/07/16/rugbymen-francais-inculpes-de-viol-leur-avocat-a-des-preuves-de-leur-innocence), qui reconnaissent une relation sexuelle avec la plaignante, mais affirment qu'elle était consentie, et nient toute violence. Décision d'ici lundi Me Cuneo Libarona a dit avoir déposé jeudi une demande de mise en liberté pour les deux Français, en détention préventive en résidence surveillée depuis le 17 juillet, après avoir passé une dizaine de jours en centre de détention. Le juge a jusqu'à lundi pour se prononcer, a-t-il précisé. Il s'est dit jeudi « très content » de la journée d'audience. « Hugo a répondu à plus de 150 questions du parquet, de la défense et de(s avocats de) la plaignante, et Oscar a dû répondre à 50, 60 questions de tout le monde ». Pour l'avocat, la mise en liberté signifie « le retour en France » des joueurs, a-t-il précisé. La liberté « c'est un concept global, pas une restriction », même si cela « n'empêche pas l'inculpation. Le processus (l'intruction) continue », mais « pourrait être terminé en deux mois », a-t-il avancé. Pour l'avocate de la plaignante, Natacha Romano, le schéma « logique et cohérent » serait que les joueurs demeurent inculpés, et en Argentine.",

    "text": "Blue Lagoon reopens Dome Mountain gold mine\nBlue Lagoon Resources (CSE: BLLG; OTCQB: BLAGF) reopened the Dome Mountain mine in British Columbia on Wednesday, more than 30 years after the last major exploration activity at the gold-silver property.\nLocated just 50 minutes from Smithers in northwestern BC, the project marks a significant shift for the company from exploration to production.\nIn February 2025, Blue Lagoon received its mining and effluent/discharge permits from the BC government, making it one of only nine companies to receive such approvals in the province since 2015.\nFollowing the opening ceremony on Wednesday, shares of Blue Lagoon Resources rose 3.13% to C$0.66 apiece, giving the company a market capitalization of C$92.91 million ($67.87 million).\nOnce the water treatment plant is fully operational, Blue Lagoon is targeting production of approximately 150 tonnes per day, totaling 55,000 tonnes annually, with an expected recovery of around 15,000 ounces of gold in the first year.\nFirst blasting is expected in August, with initial gold production anticipated in September. The company expects to reach full capacity before the end of the year.\nMining will begin at the Boulder Vein above the 1290m level using a mechanized cut-and-fill method.\n“Over the past few years, we have strategically invested more than $30 million into Dome Mountain, ensuring that when we reached this milestone, we would be ready to move forward with minimal additional capital requirements,” President and CEO Rana Vig said in a February 12 shareholder letter.\n“Now, with just approximately $3 million in additional CapEx, we will be in a position to begin mining operations – a remarkably low cost compared to industry norms.”\nOre will be brought to the surface and stored before being trucked to Nicola Mining’s toll-milling facility in Merritt under an active agreement. Waste rock will remain underground.\nThe project benefits from year-round road access and a newly commissioned water treatment plant.\nBlue Lagoon remains debt-free, with the upcoming ramp-up funded in part through a recently closed financing of nearly $5 million. The company also has $3.6 million in the money warrants and access to an unsecured credit line from its toll mill partner, Nicola Mining.\nCommunity engagement and upside\nLocal support has been central to Dome Mountain’s revival.\nFour of the ten current site workers are members of the Lake Babine First Nation, on whose traditional territory the project is located.\nAs part of its agreement with the Indigenous community, the company will provide scholarships to train Indigenous youth for underground mining roles.\n“It’s a great opportunity to learn underground for the First Nations… There’s a great opportunity to teach our young people what underground is so we can all work together as one,” said Brenda Patrick, a Lake Babine Nation employee at the site, in an interview with MINING.com.\nPathway to expansion\nThe current mine plan spans five years, focused solely on the permitted Boulder Vein area.\nHowever, Blue Lagoon plans to pursue additional permits to mine deeper zones below the 1290m level and expand into the nearby Argillite Vein. This next phase could significantly increase production if exploration results prove favorable. The mine’s existing infrastructure and regulatory progress position it well for phased growth.\nAccording to chief geologist Bill Cronk, the property has substantial “blue sky” potential, with 15 high-grade quartz carbonate veins identified and 90% of the 21,000-hectare site still unexplored.\nLegacy project revived\nGold mineralization on the property dates back to the late 1800s, and considerable surface and underground work had already been completed by 1923–1924.\nRenewed exploration in the 1980s led to the discovery of the Boulder Vein system in 1985 by Noranda.\nUnderground mining occurred briefly in the early 1990s under a joint venture between Timmins Nickel and Habsburg Resources.\nWhen operations ceased in May 1993, the mine had produced approximately 43,900 tonnes of ore at an average grade of 0.35 oz/ton gold.\nThe most recent project owner, Gavin Mines, held the property for 12 years, completing much of the infrastructure and underground development.\nIn total, more than $80 million has been spent on the project by previous owners, including Gavin Mines, Timmins Nickel, and Noranda.\nBlue Lagoon acquired the project in 2020 and has since focused on drilling and developing the Boulder Vein system.\nComments\n{{ commodity.name }}\n[{{ post.title }}]\n{{ post.date }}",

    "title": "New blast reported off Yemen after US strikes",
    "text": "DUBAI — A new explosion was reported off Yemen on Thursday after overnight US strikes targeted 10 attack drones and a ground control station belonging to the Iran-backed Houthi rebels. The explosion, reported by the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations agency, happened near a vessel west of the port city of Hodeida.\nNo damage to the ship or injuries to the crew was reported.\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, which followed a flurry of missile strikes by the Houthis who have harassed Red Sea shipping for months, triggering reprisal attacks by the United States and Britain.\nEarly Thursday in Yemen, US forces targeted a \"Houthi UAV ground control station and 10 Houthi one-way UAVs\" that \"presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the US Navy ships in the region\", a CENTCOM statement said, using an abbreviation for unmanned aerial vehicles or drones.\nCENTCOM earlier announced that the USS Carney had shot down an anti-ship ballistic missile fired by the Huthis towards the Gulf of Aden, and that three Iranian drones were downed less than an hour later.\nIt did not specify if the drones shot down by the destroyer were designed for attack or surveillance.\nMaritime security firm Ambrey said a commercial vessel was reportedly targeted by a missile southwest of Aden after the Houthis claimed a missile attack on an American ship in the area that they say was heading towards Israel.\nAmbrey did not name the ship or mention its ownership, but Huthi spokesman Yahya Saree identified the ship as \"KOI\".\nUS forces also destroyed a Houthi surface-to-air missile on Wednesday that CENTCOM said posed an imminent threat to \"US aircraft\", a deviation from past raids that focused on reducing the rebels' ability to threaten international shipping.\nIt did not identify the type of aircraft that had been threatened or the location of the strike, saying only that it took place in \"Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen\".\nWhile the United States has recently launched strikes on the Houthis and other Iran-supported groups in the region, both Washington and Tehran have sought to avoid a direct confrontation, and the downing of three Iranian drones could heighten tensions.\nThe Houthis began targeting Red Sea shipping in November, saying they were hitting Israel-linked vessels as a way to support Palestinians in Gaza, which has been ravaged by the Israeli offensive war.\nUS and British forces have responded with strikes against the Houthis, who have since declared American and British interests to be legitimate targets as well.\nSome of the US strikes have focused on missiles that CENTCOM said posed an imminent threat to ships, indicating robust surveillance of Houthi-controlled territory likely to include military aircraft.\nThe United States also set up a multinational naval task force to help protect Red Sea shipping from repeated Houthi attacks in the transit route, which carries up to 12 per cent of global trade.\nIn addition to military action, Washington has sought to put diplomatic and financial pressure on the Houthis, redesignating them as a “terrorist” organisation in January after previously having dropped that label soon after President Joe Biden took office.\nOn Wednesday, the Houthis said they fired missiles at destroyer the USS Gravely, a claim that came after CENTCOM said the warship downed an anti-ship cruise missile launched “from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen toward the Red Sea”",
