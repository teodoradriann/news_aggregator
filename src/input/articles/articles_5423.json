    "title": "Disney World Guest Has A Message For Park Goers: \"Parent Your Kids!\" - Scary Mommy",
    "text": "This Disney World Guest Has A Message For Park Goers: \"Parent Your Kids!\"\nShe posted on TikTok after a super tense moment with a fellow mom.\nIf Disney is supposed to be the “\nhappiest place on earth,” why are children always melting down in a way that is so over the top from a tantrum that would happen at home? There is something about the Disney experience that is so pressure-filled, right? Parents are shelling out a hefty sum, so they want to make the experience as magical and wonderful as possible. This can lead to exhaustion, for parents and kids both.\nBeyond the princess meet-and-greets and spontaneous dance numbers, there is tension in the air at\nDisney parks, especially while waiting in those tedious queues that can last for literally hours. For one mom, she hit a boiling point with another mom, leading to a bigger question: how far is too far when interfering with another parent’s kid’s behavior?\nTikTok mom,\nRachel The Dreamer, posted a video on her account, asking her followers what they would have done in her situation involving another person’s child who was allegedly acting up at Hollywood Studios in Disney World.\n“The week after Christmas, I took my kids to Disney World. Saved up a long time for this trip. My kids are getting old. I wanted to have this memory while I still could,” she began.\n“Well, we go to the Star Wars ride, which everybody has to wait a million hours to go, and there's this little demon child there. And yes, I mean that with sincerity, he was a menace.”\nAs Rachel waited in the long line amongst said “demon child,” she noticed that his parents had given him a toy lightsaber.\n“Which I get, when my kids were young, they loved that crap. But [his parents] were not paying any attention, and this kid's probably like seven, eight years old, and he kept hitting people. He was swinging it wide. Little man did not give a flip,” she recalled.\nShe wasn’t super bothered by the kid’s out-of-pocket behavior until he began to swing and hit her kids and herself. That’s when she stepped in and spoke to the child.\nShe continued, “And I was like, ‘All right, time to put it away, kiddo.’ Yeah, I got on this other person's kid, and the mom freaked out.”\n“And the mom goes, ‘He is fine. We are good. He can do what he wants. He's not bothering anyone.’ I'm like, ‘Lady, please. Your kid hit me and my kid. Get him under control.’ And she's like, ‘We're fine.’”\nThings escalated from there with the mother of the lightsaber kid raising her voice and yelling at Rachel who started to dismiss the situation with a handwave. Soon enough, Disney security arrived on the scene to separate the two families.\n“Just parent your kids, y'all. Just parent them,” Rachel begged.\nSeveral TikTok users sided with Rachel, noting that she did the right thing by addressing the seemingly out-of-control boy.\n“If someone told my kid to stop I would be mortified because I wasn’t paying attention and I would be apologizing like forever,” one user wrote.\n“Took my kids to Disneyland. My 8yo saved up his money for a lightsaber and it stayed in the bag ALL DAY!,” another said.\n“If you don’t want to parent your kid, don’t get mad when someone else does!🤷🏼♀️I’d probably do the same,” another said.\n“Yep if my kid was acting unacceptable I would want someone to help correct it,” the OP replied.\nAnother pointed out that this whole “parents not looking after their kids” thing is all too common at Disney parks.\n“This is so many kids at Disney. And the parents don’t care and are rarely paying attention. That’s why Disney has to run a constant recording of ‘Parents please watch your children,’ they wrote.\nThe response to Rachel’s video made one thing clear: if mom or dad aren’t going to take the time to parent their child, mind their manners, and make sure they’re not disturbing those around them, someone else is going to do it for them.",

    "text": "UGT carga contra “la nueva vuelta de tuerca” a la carrera profesional de los profesionales del Sescam\nEl sindicato UGT ha cargado en un comunicado contra “la nueva vuelta de tuerca” a la carrera profesional de los profesionales del Servicio de Salud de Castilla-La Mancha (Sescam).\nDe este modo, el sindicato ha informado de que este viernes se publica en el Diario Oficial de Castilla-La Mancha una Resolución que “supone la paralización del efecto económico de aquellas solicitudes de Homologación de Carrera Profesional cuyo reconocimiento sea posterior a la entrada en vigor de la Ley 1/2012”.\nPara UGT esto supone una “vuelta de tuerca” a los profesionales del Sescam, “no solo a los que ya estaban, que no pueden pedir nuevos grados de Carrera Profesional al estar este sistema paralizado por Ley”, sino que “ahora se añade a los nuevos profesionales que se incorporaran al Servicio de Salud a partir del martes 17 de septiembre en el Concurso de Traslados, y que traen nuevos grados de Carrera Profesional reconocidos por sus Servicios de Salud de origen”.\n“Estos no tendrán efecto económico si fueron reconocidos con posterioridad a 1 de marzo de 2012. De esta forma ni los que están, ni los que ahora vienen tendrán derecho a nuevos grados de Carrera Profesional. Cuestión que será abordada, sin duda, judicialmente”.\nLa propia Resolución hoy publicada, según explica UGT, establece que “la carrera profesional supone el derecho de los profesionales a progresar, de forma individualizada, como reconocimiento a su desarrollo profesional en cuanto a conocimientos, experiencia y cumplimiento de los objetivos de la organización a la cual prestan sus servicios”. “En Castilla la Mancha los profesionales carecen de ese Derecho desde 2012. Se predica la igualdad entre las comunidades autónomas en materia de financiación, pero Castilla-La Mancha es la única en no reanudar los reconocimientos de Carrera Profesional dentro de sus fronteras”.\nPara UGT, “no solo hay que predicar, también hay que dar trigo”.\n“Los profesionales del Sescam merecen la inmediata puesta en marcha de su sistema de Carrera Profesional y esto conseguiría con la Derogación de la Ley 1/2012, por lo que insta a que no se dilaten más en el tiempo el reconocimiento de nuevos grados para todos los profesionales del Servicio de Salud, es por tanto una cuestión de voluntad política”.\nEn materia de contratación, UGT asegura que no está de acuerdo con las actuales limitaciones, que hace que todo contrato deba ser autorizado por la Consejería de Hacienda de Castilla-La Mancha, “no siendo así en muchos casos”. “Se están denegando contratos, sustituciones y permisos por conciliación de la vida laboral y familiar”.",

I want y’all to know that you can carry on a continuous, open-ended conversation with God throughout the day. Talking with him about whatever is going on in your life.” “Hear Him out and talk to Him and find instruction,” he [continued](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXq7YiH-bP0). “You need to do that every day because although life be lifing—y’all know what that means, life be lifing—you got to also understand that God be guiding too. Life be lifing, but God be guiding, meaning what God promised you will happen, but are you bold enough to step into the light?” Mitchell found fame through ’90s Nickelodeon shows like ALL THAT and KENAN & KEL. While he still acts—most recently appearing in 2023’s GOOD BURGER 2—he became a licensed pastor in 2019. “I’ve always known God,” he [told](https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/nickelodeon-star-kel-mitchell-explains-why-became-youth-pastor-ive-always-known-god) Fox News Digital. “Grew up in a church, but there’s a difference between knowing God and having a relationship with God. And I just got to a point in my life where I wanted to make sure that He was in everything that I do.” Mitchell often shares his faith and encourages followers through his [social media platform](https://www.instagram.com/p/C42A3sGu1m6/). Several weeks ago, he posted a prayer urging his fans to invite Christ into every area of their lives. It [read](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2XqErCJhh5/): “I realize the supernatural realm is where victories are won. So I declare the victory in Jesus’s name. I declare victory over every Goliath in my life-in my family, my finances, my workplace, my church/ministry, and my body. I decree and declare that today is the dawning of a new season of success and fruitfulness. Old things have passed away; behold, all things are becoming new. In Jesus’s name, amen.” “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced,” he [quoted](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2XqErCJhh5/?img_index=3), adding, “Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind. Always.” Movieguide® previously [reported](https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/kel-mitchell-its-a-beautiful-feeling-to-be-in-harmony-with-god.html): Actor and pastor Kel Mitchell emphasizes the importance of accepting God’s messages and staying “in harmony” with one’s faith. “When you receive a heartfelt letter, there is excitement. We want to have that same excitement to know that God loves us, so when He sends a message to us, we have to be willing to receive it,” Mitchell [said]in a recent sermon. “The words of the Bible are like personal texts into your spiritual inbox.” He explained that not only do you need to be excited to receive these messages, you need to be ready and willing for whatever God is calling you to do. “Challenging us to be different — that is what God is saying. Challenging us to be different, encouraging us to transform our thinking and live according to a higher purpose. His purpose,” Mitchell said.
