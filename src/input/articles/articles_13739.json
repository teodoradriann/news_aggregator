    "text": "CHEYENNE — Wyoming, and the United States as a whole, outperformed economic projections in 2023, one of the state’s top economists said Wednesday. Despite a slight increase in the state’s unemployment rate, Wenlin Liu said that the economy could be headed for a “soft landing” in the new year. Liu, chief economist with the Wyoming Department of Administration and Information’s Economic Analysis Division, said that the state’s economy seemed to fare better than the rest of the country. “Wyoming’s economy continues to perform well, actually,” Liu told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle. “As far as the labor market ... it’s really ‘tight,’ which means that unemployment rate is low. It’s the lowest since summer 2008.” According to a report published by the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services on Tuesday, unemployment in the state rose slightly in the past few months, from 2.9% in October to 3% in November. The report did note that it was much lower than in November of 2022, when unemployment was at 3.9%. Wyoming’s unemployment rate currently sits well below the current national average of 3.7%, the report noted. Liu continued by saying that Wyoming’s economy showed broad growth overall, with growth in a number of different areas, including tourism. He did note a slowing of growth in retail and financial activities. He said the slower-than-average growth in the sector of financial activities, which includes loans and property sales, could be due to rising interest rates applied by the Federal Reserve throughout 2023. “The higher interest rate is trying to drive down inflation,” Liu said. “You have to pay higher (interest on) loans if you’re trying to buy a big item like an automobile, or even purchasing a house. Particularly, the housing market is slow, and business is facing a higher interest rate, and you’re trying not to expand your business much because, with high interest rates, you have to borrow more money. “I think in 2024 that high interest rate will negatively impact the economy, will slow down econom(ic) performance,” Liu continued. “That’s why we expect 2024 will be slow. Unless we have another surprise, 2023 was somewhat of a surprise.” Liu also pushed back on assertions made in previous years that the pandemic would lead to a major recession. He said that the stronger-than-expected growth in 2023 showed signs that a drastic recession was avoided. He added that, going forward, the higher interest rate could slow down economic growth across the U.S. next year, but might allow for a “soft landing,” where issues like inflation and unemployment improve without drastic interruptions to the economy. Overall, he said that employment, in many sectors, has rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic, with growth surpassing pre-pandemic levels. One major exception is the mining industry, he said. “Leisure, hospitality, and even retail, many other services, actually their employment is higher than pre-COVID levels,” he said. “So, overall, Wyoming’s total employment is already 2% higher than pre-COVID levels. ... So that means our economy has been more diverse than pre-COVID.” The main factor where things are decreasing, Liu pointed out, was in taxable sales, which he attributed to federal interest rates and the decline of mining in Wyoming.

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#5](c5#c-5) Es cloaquero porque miente más que habla, y lo hace para enfangar.\nY me disgusta el nombre, porque la gente que trabaja en las cloacas hace un trabajo muy digno y necesario.\n#_2 Si el encargado de prensa de un político alardea de licenciatura y resulta que es mentira es un escándalo y debería dimitir de cualquier relación politica que pueda tener.\nPara otro día dejamos que un señor que quiere vivir de paguitas públicas le vacile al empresario que ha montado un medio de comunicación, porque tiene cachindeíto.\nAnda que no hay gente que NO termina la carrera y luego se cuelgan medallas como si la hubieran terminado.\nEn mi opinión, cuando es alguien muy conocido debería ser algo que se pueda consultar públicamente. Veo bien que tener un título pueda ser algo privado, que no se pueda saber si tienes X o Y titulación si no lo dices tú, pero una vez lo dices, no veo mal que se pueda consultar, sobre todo en casos como este donde la persona es muy conocida.\nEs tan mentiroso que si le das un reloj y le quita las pilas, este no llegaría dar la hora correcta dos veces al día.\nEn realidad aunque tuviera el título (la facultad dice que no), tampoco sería periodista.\n[#17](c17#c-17) A ver, que ya sabíamos que le comías los huevos a pagascal con absoluta efusividad, no hacía falta que te retratases aún más.\nQué grande el excoletas por haber retratado a toda la escoria fascista, aplastapobres y vendepatrias de este país. Todavía se sabe que escuece viendo que tienen a bastardos malpagados defendiendo lo indefendible por doquier. Son tan tiernos.\nPues hay que ser muy lerdo, negado, para no acabar la carrera de periodismo, esas carreras de pintar y colorear; Si me dijeras una carrera de ciencias, quizás.\nMira que no valer ni pa eso.\nAlvise es un tentetieso para salir de Ayuso. Me dan ganas de votar cada noticia de Alvise SPAM a partir de ahora.\nAdemás de mentiroso es que es subnormal: la figura del licenciado hace años que no existe. En todo caso sería graduado. Es más, lo pone en la banda.\nEstá claro que se hizo la foto de graduación con créditos pendientes y ahora va de que ha terminado la carrera.\nBueno, quizás haya acabado las asignaturas que le acababan en Mayo o Junio...\nLa prueba que dice la chavala resentida esta de que está matriculada con ella no me parece que signifique mucho a estas alturas del año.\nQue el colegio le pida cuentas a él por decir que es Periodista sin serlo, si es que es así.\nPero no sé porque tanto revuelo, la verdad, es periodismo, ni que fuese una carrera de ciencias.\n[#4](c4#c-4) bueno, pero eso también aplica a muchos de los que a día de hoy ya tienen el titulo. Incluso a muchos que llevan décadas con el titulo\n[#10](c10#c-10) además, esa afirmación la dijo Pablo Iglesias sí, pero estando soltero, sin hijos, sin mercenarios de la derecha amenazando a su familia.\nComo mínimo, una persona de \"bien\" con un mínimo de razonamiento, se daría cuenta que una afirmación así estando soltero, no se puede mantener cuando estas en pareja, o formando una familia, porque esa decisión ya no es sólo tuya.\nPor lo tanto, solo un necio puede llamar hipócrita a Pablo Iglesias por no seguir viviendo en Vallecas.",

    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.
