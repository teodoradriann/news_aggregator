    "text": "Popular free-to-play shooter PUBG is officially closing down the servers for the last-gen consoles later this year.\nPreviously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, before being rebranded as PUBG: Battlegrounds, this popular shooter was one of the titles that helped establish the battle royale genre as we know it today.\nPerhaps without PUBG, the likes of Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone wouldn't have become as popular or successful as they are today.\nOriginally released in 2017, PUBG is still going strong, according to SteamDB. At the time of writing, the shooter hit an all-time concurrent player peak of more than 3.2 million over seven years ago.\nAdvert\nAs of today, it has a 24-hour concurrent player peak of 725,587, which is mighty impressive for a game that’s approaching being a decade old.\nWhile the exact numbers aren't publicly obtainable on consoles, I’d imagine PUBG is performing reasonably well on PlayStation and Xbox, too. However, at least on consoles, PUBG is going to take a massive hit by killing off support this year.\nAs spotted by TweakTown, PUBG publisher Krafton has announced that support will come to an end for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 13 November 2025, in the hope of making the current-gen console performances more stable as well as improving visuals and framerates.\n“It weighs heavily on us to deliver this news to our console players who have enjoyed PUBG on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for so many years,” reads a statement by Krafton.\nAdvert\n“We still vividly remember the epic battles, the heart-stopping moments, and the camaraderie that brought us together. We are deeply grateful for every moment you've spent with us over the past eight years.\n“This was not a decision made lightly. It comes after long and careful consideration, in pursuit of the continued growth and long-term future of PUBG Console. We kindly ask for your understanding and invite players using PlayStation 4 or Xbox One to review the details below.”\nBefore January 2022, PUBG was not free-to-play, and for those who initially paid to play the battle royale shooter, refunds will be issued, including those who purchased Battlegrounds Plus.\nPUBG: Battlegrounds is out now on PC, PlayStation, Xbox and compatible mobile devices.",

Maura Healey of Massachusetts is reportedly sending officials to the southern border in Texas to steer migrants away from coming to her state. The staffers have reportedly appeared in Brownsville, Hidalgo, McAllen, and San Antonio, to tell migrants in shelters that Massachusetts is full and has no room for more illegal border crossers. The sudden move comes after months of Healey’s advocacy and budget allowances for migrants. {snip} Massachusetts is not officially a “sanctuary state,” as it has [laws](https://www.wcvb.com/article/is-massachusetts-a-sanctuary-state/41845050) to prevent law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials.

The Bay State also has a host of cities that have declared themselves sanctuary cities. The state’s emergency shelter system has a capacity limit of 7,500 families, and it reached that limit in November. Currently the state reports 7,379 families in the system. Massachusetts also passed a [law](https://www.mass.gov/news/healey-driscoll-administration-details-9-month-length-of-stay-policy-at-emergency-assistance-sites#:~:text=Boston%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Healey%2DDriscoll%20administration,at%20the%20end%20of%20April.) in April that limits migrant families to nine months in the shelter system. {snip}",

    "text": "Falcons Receive Passing Grade Despite 2024 'Disappointment'\nThe Atlanta Falcons failed to secure a winning record or a playoff berth for the seventh consecutive season in 2024. The Falcons extended those streaks despite high preseason expectations.\nOn Jan. 30, Bleacher Report's Maurice Moton awarded every NFL team a grade for the 2024 campaign. Failing to live up to their expectations, Moton gave the Falcons a \"C.\"\n\"The Atlanta Falcons opened the season with a lot of hope that turned into disappointment partially because of a slow decision to bench their high-paid quarterback and the inability to address their defensive holes in the offseason,\" wrote Moton.\n\"In retrospect, the Falcons made the right move by taking Michael Penix Jr. in the first round of the 2024 draft. However, they stuck with Cousins a little too long, and their 23rd-ranked defense wasn't stout enough to help an offense that sputtered for extended stretches.\"\nIt's probably important to note that Moton was awarding \"realistic grades\" in his Jan. 30 column.\nAlthough there was plenty of hype around the Falcons last summer, there were enough doubters that the team missing the postseason wasn't a huge shock. As it turned out, the team's top offseason moves last year were flashy but offered little improvement.\nThe Kirk Cousins deal proved to be that. So did the acquisitions for defenders Matthew Judon and Justin Simmons.\nSo, based on realistic expectations, it's probably fair to give the Falcons a \"C\" for their 2024 campaign. They competed for a playoff spot until the season finale, and the team's anemic pass rush showed signs of life late in the year.\nStill, context is everything. The Falcons were 6-3 and had already swept the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. With that in mind, they had no business missing the playoffs.\nIt's also one thing to waste $90 million on Cousins. But to fail once again to find long-term solutions on defense is a blunder on a whole other level -- one that maybe could have been avoided had the Falcons not signed Cousins and drafted Penix.\nYes, drafting Penix proved to be the right move. But they didn't have to add both signal callers.\nFailing to fix the defense could hurt the Falcons' chances of becoming a real Super Bowl contender while Michael Penix Jr. is on his rookie deal.\nFrom a national perspective, a \"C\" grade seems appropriate for an 8-9 team. But the 2024 Falcons had the potential for a lot more, especially after a 6-3 start.\nPlus, anyone who lived every down of that mid-season four-game losing is unlikely to give Atlanta an overall passing grade.",
