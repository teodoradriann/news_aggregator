Cuando la religión no respeta otras formas de ver el mundo es cuando empiezan los fanatismos y las hostias. Si no se acepta la diversidad de credos, apaga y vámonos porque lo que viene luego no es agradable para nadie.\nLuego empezarán con sus Frentes Populares de Judea y acabarán a hostia limpia entre ellos, porque alguien que necesita y busca enemigos para elevar su moral y sus creencias son un saco de hostias en potencia. Alguien que piense así, tiene todas las papeletas para recibir hostias a cascoporro y es lo que van buscando. Quien anda con fuego acaba quemándose.\n[#5](c5#c-5) En realidad este discurso en concreto se parece más al del ISIS que al de Hitler.\nAunque el resultado de ambos sea el mismo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Creo que el problema es que eso lo dice la religión de los judíos, que son descendientes de no sé qué tribu elegida por un dios.\nY habrá judíos que se tomen el judaismo como pertenencia a un grupo y lo reinterpretan y lo ponen al servicio de su vida (igual que hay cristianos que no apedrean a su hija si se casa sin el permiso de su padre). Pero el judaismo tiene una base de supremacismo muy mala de esquivar.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Un mes.. da un mes, al resto del planeta - sin eeuu... iban a ver los \"elegidos\" que opinan de aquello del \"pueblo elegido\"...\nPues para ser el pueblo elegido:\n- menuda mierda territorio les ha dado, a mí que me den algo que no sea un puto desierto: Francia, El norte de España, Italia, las Seychelles, las mismas orillas del Nilo, Mesopotamia. Zonas fértiles.\n- Salvo los últimos 70 años les han dado más que a una estera.\nAsí que menudo dios cutre.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Eso es: si su dios los hubiera elegido y les tuviera cariño bien pudo haberles dao cuerpo de senegalés...\n[#11](c11#c-11) Un amigo ingeniero agrónomo me contó que aquella zona en tiempos bíblicos fue un vergel, pero empezaron a regar los cultivos con agua de mar y se lo cargaron. No son muy listos los “elegidos”.\nSi Dios existiera haría un fisting con su culo y les enviaría al puto infierno por toda la eternidad.\n[#23](c23#c-23) No sé salvaron los que no quisieron realizar la Aliá (que empezó en 1840 https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali%C3%A1 ) y a esos que no se salvaron los llamaron los sacrificados o holocausto https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocausto_(sacrificio)\nEs supremacista (pueblo elegido, el resto está para servir) y elitista (no buscan crear nuevos adeptos como en el cristianismo o islamismo o naces judío o no eres judío)\nEsto lo dicen los lideres religiosos judios y la mayoria de ellos lo aceptan como algo natural y te lo repiten con otras palabras menos extremas pero que vienen a ser lo mismo\nPues al final hablando así hasta hacen buenos a los nazis, igual estaban engañados con esta gente...",

    "text": "Florida\nAfter students were given religious-themed beads by a teacher in the Pinellas County Schools system in Largo, Fla., FFRF made sure that the teacher understood her obligation to remain secular in her teaching.\nA district parent reported to FFRF that a second-grade teacher at Azalea Elementary School distributed beads to her students as part of a class assignment to craft necklaces and bracelets for students to wear. The parent reported that one of the bead designs their child brought home included a Latin cross.\n“The district has a duty to ensure that its teachers are not using their positions to promote their personal religious beliefs to students,” FFRF Staff Attorney Chris Line wrote to the district.\nAfter FFRF’s letter to the district, the School Board Attorney David Koperski worked with the teacher in question to ensure that the Constitution would be respected going forward. “There was certainly no intent to promote religion of any kind or use her classroom assignments to advance her religious beliefs,” Koperski wrote. “I spoke with her about the concern, and she understood the rules regarding the promotion of religion in her capacity as a public school teacher.”",

    "text": "Eric Stone/Houston Public Media The 2019 Houston Marathon finish line The Arctic front coming to Houston will create optimal running weather for the Chevron Houston Marathon on Sunday.\nThe marathon usually sees around 300,000 participants, volunteers, and spectators on race day. Runners say Houston's marathon is one of the best because of its ideal conditions.\n\"It's flat, it's hard, the weather's right,\" Marathon runner Patrick Tiernan said. \"I've heard great things.\nTiernan has represented Australia in several international competitions, including the 2020 and 2016 Olympics. He and others come from around the world to participate in Houston's marathon.\nLars Thestrup is the Medical Director for the Houston Marathon. He said temperatures are expected to be around the mid-40s throughout the race.\n“The optimal weather for a marathon is between 40 and 65 degrees. So as of right now, we have a green flag race and I'm really excited about it,\" Thestrup said.\nHe said runners should keep their layers on and take them off as they warm up throughout the marathon, but keep them on hand in case the wind cools them off again.\nFor spectators, it's a different story.\n\"As spectators, it's gonna be cold,\" Houston Fire Department Chief Samuel Peña said. \"… and even though it's cold, we recommend that you hydrate appropriately. It's gonna be a long day and we wanna ensure that you're properly hydrated.\"\nPeña also recommended that attendees arrive early and consider using public transportation because some roads will be closed for the marathon.\nThe race will start Sunday at 7:01 a.m., and festivities will continue until the early afternoon.",

    "title": "It's time for DEI 2.0 when all forms of hate and violence are rejected. This is the business of business",
    "text": "The war in the Middle East challenges us to take the next step in diversity, equity and inclusion by moving against all forms of hate and violence. This is the business of business. MIAMI, Dec. 29, 2023 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Businesses, like non-profits and educational institutions, have developed Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies to create better places to work, serve communities, and hire smart. Thinking has been moving in that direction for years, but it was propelled forward after George Floyd's death in 2020. Now, the war in the Middle East challenges us to take the next step—DEI 2.0—moving against all forms of hate and violence. The goal is to reject concepts, acts and, yes, speech that demeans, incites and ignores what should be called out and rejected. This isn't a feel-good effort. DEI 2.0 makes a better workplace, more loyal clients and customers, and betters any community. There is a business case for considering what is right and doing it. By default, as we look at what and who must be included, we necessarily need to consider what must be excluded. There is a place for moral clarity in business and many businesses are seeking it for valid business reasons. Each business, service or retail operation needs a written program with clear, stated values that are not simply words but values incorporated into processes that include everything from hiring to customer relations. These are scary times. Uncertainty reigns. I'm a businessman. My business interests are varied but my values are consistent across the various sectors. Since the current Middle East war, people have been afraid to speak out. Hate crimes, random attacks, and violence have escalated toward specific groups. Many institutional DEI policies spell out which minorities must be included. And it's time to take the next step and spell out who should be excluded. One thoughtful organization has as a focus on the front page of its website: \"The organization's future depends on its open embrace of people of all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.\" It's an excellent goal but excluding hateful behavior and hateful speech is just as important. It's DEI 2.0. Evolved diversity statements affirm a desire to seek diversity as a critical part of organizational culture. Some institutions have even put diversity in their mission statements! That's why DEI 2.0 is crucial. Compare the last statement to this one: \"We wholeheartedly condemn all forms of violence, hate, and prejudice against any individual or community.\" Doesn't that sound right? These are not just words; they are actionable. These words mean business. When DEI is not actionable, not in the operation manual, then it is too passive. A manual is not just a document; it spells out institutional values and contains institutional culture. I have made serious efforts to make my businesses and my personal life more diverse, more equitable, and more inclusive. I now realize that I must make an equally serious effort to root out all forms of hate at work as well as at home. When one group experiences hate, it is only a matter of time before it transfers to the next group and the next. Hate prevents equity. DEI 2.0 brings us closer to a more inclusive and equitable society where hate and violence are simply not tolerated. It's not just the right thing to do; it's good for business.

    "title": "Ketamine: Would making the drug class A stop Gen Z using it?",
    "text": "Would making ketamine Class A stop Gen Z using it?\n\"Upgrading ketamine to Class A just means that young people will take dirtier, unsafe drugs, the money will go to the dealers and no one wins.\"\nVicky Unwin's words come from experience - the drug policy reform campaigner lost her daughter in 2011 to a ketamine overdose.\nShe is part of Anyone's Child, a decade-long campaign that lobbies for change in the government's current drug policies, calling for illegal drugs to be legally regulated.\nBut their mission is not favoured by everyone. David Sidwick, Dorset's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) believes strongly in the criminalisation of drugs and said \"making ketamine Class A sends a strong message on its dangers\".\nIt comes at a time when the use of ketamine has soared among young people.\nThe Home Office has described the drug as \"extremely dangerous\" and said it has requested advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs about reclassifying it.\nMs Unwin, who lives in London, was among a group of parents who took part in an annual lobby at parliament last month.\nShe is the chair of Transform Drug Policy Foundation, a charity that aims to reform the UK's current drug laws and believes criminalising the dissociative drug does not have a positive impact.\nAfter her 21-year-old daughter, Louise Cattell, died 14 years ago, she began campaigning for more effective harm reduction around the drug.\nShe explained how she had decided to \"take a bump of the drug instead of buying a very expensive alcohol\", then went on to run a bath and watch some TV.\nShe fell asleep and drowned in the bath.\nDespite her daughter's fatal experience, Ms Unwin does not believe harsher laws surrounding ketamine would have saved her life.\nShe said: \"I believe very strongly that legal regulation and decriminalisation are the only ways to really deliver harm reduction.\n\"If you classify drugs and make them illegal, all that happens is they go underground.\n\"People want to have fun and they want to experiment and if you say 'no' to someone that's the surest way they are going do something that they're not allowed to do.\"\nWhat is ketamine?\n- Ketamine is a powerful horse tranquilliser and anaesthetic. It is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically\n- However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder\n- It is currently a Class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971\n- This means the penalty for possession is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both\nIf it was upgraded to Class A, the penalty for possession would increase to seven years, falling in line with drugs like cocaine, heroin and ecstasy (MDMA)\nMs Unwin's perspective is not the only view on the topic.\nDavid Sidwick, Dorset's PCC, is among politicians lobbying for ketamine to be upgraded to Class A.\nHe is the addiction and substance misuse co-chair within the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners.\nMr Sidwick said: \"If it is Class A, firstly it sends a strong message about the dangers with it, but secondly it will lead to more investment in treatment, prevention and awareness, and that's what we badly need.\"\nIn recent years, ketamine usage has made more headlines due to growing concerns around the damage it can cause to a user's bladder.\nChronic ketamine usage affects the lining of the bladder and can shrink it.\nEarlier this year the BBC spoke to a recovering addict from Portsmouth who faced bladder problems after taking the drug in her teens and 20s.\nThe latest government figures show the drug's usage among 16 to 24-year-olds in England has tripled since 2016.\nMr Sidwick was particularly concerned by this: \"There has been years of counter propaganda from organised crime groups who will talk to our young people and they will say 'this drug will make you feel better'.\n\"Well, I'm sorry, but it doesn't make you feel better when you are in a genital urinary ward waiting for someone to do something to your bladder.\"\nHe added: \"I don't want young people wearing nappies for the rest of their lives because of that drug.\"\nMs Unwin also feels Gen Z has a bad relationship with ketamine, but urged the issue to be treated as a health problem rather than a criminal offence.\nShe emphasised: \"Please don't take ketamine, it really is dangerous and because there's so little drug education in schools, they only talk about coke and heroin, they don't talk about ketamine and the party drugs.\"\nAnne-Marie Cockburn, a fellow Anyone's Child campaigner and mother from Oxford, agrees with Ms Unwin's perspective.\nShe lost her 15-year-old daughter, Martha Fernback, to an overdose in 2013 and believes that her death could have been avoided if she had access to information on harm reduction when taking drugs.\nMs Cockburn said: \"I'm not promoting drug taking for under 18s, my daughter was only 15.\n\"But what I do say is had she gotten her hands on something that was labelled with a list of ingredients and recommended dosage, she would not have taken enough for five-to-10 people in one go and died of an accidental ecstasy overdose three hours later.\"\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning.\n\"The Minister for Policing and Crime Prevention has requested advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs about reclassifying it as a Class A drug and will consider that advice carefully and quickly once received.\"\nBut Ms Cockburn does not think the government is doing enough.\nShe added: \"It just makes me feel like they're almost playing a game with families like ours.\n\"If it was a member of their family, they would be taking this seriously.\n\"We need to look at human behaviour and the reality of what's going on in our society.\"\nIf you've been affected by any of the issues in this story you can access help and advice on the BBC Action Line website here.\nYou can follow BBC Dorset on Facebook, X, or Instagram.",
