    "text": "Cerrar ventana emergente Dos años y medio después que Vladímir Putin ordenase a sus tropas invadir la vecina Ucrania , la guerra sigue anclada en el este de Europa.\nEL PERIÓDICO sigue en directo las últimas noticias del avance militar de Rusia y de la respuesta ucraniana.\nActualizar 23 AGO 2024 - 21:20\nBiden habla con Zelenski y anuncia nueva ayuda militar para Ucrania Estados Unidos va a entregar a Ucrania un nuevo paquete de ayuda militar, que incluye misiles antiaéreos, anunció el presidente Joe Biden este viernes tras llamar por teléfono a su homólogo Volodimir Zelenski. Pese a la invasión rusa \"Ucrania sigue siendo un país libre. Y la guerra terminará con una Ucrania libre, soberana e independiente\", afirmó Biden en un comunicado.\nRRSS WhatsApp RRSS Facebook RRSS Twitter RRSS email 23 AGO 2024 - 19:17\nEEUU sanciona a varios buques de la 'flota fantasma' con la que Rusia burla las restricciones La Oficina de Control de Activos Extranjeros (OFAC) del Departamento del Tesoro de Estados Unidos ha añadido a su 'lista negra' a siete buques gaseros vinculados a la 'flota fantasma' con la que Rusia busca evadir las sanciones impuestas a sus exportaciones de hidrocarburos. Entre los buques añadidos a la lista figuran tres embarcaciones de transporte de GNL con bandera de Palaos (Asya Energy, Everest Energy y Pioneer) así como cuatro barcos gaseros con bandera de Panamá (North Air, North Mountain, North Sky y North Way). Según señala Bloomberg, los buques Pioneer y Asya Energy habrían cargado los dos primeros envíos del proyecto Arctic LNG 2, previamente sancionado por Estados Unidos, cuyas operaciones fueron registradas mediante imágenes satelitales. Las sanciones suponen un nuevo golpe para Rusia, que lleva meses desarrollando lo que se cree que es una 'flota fantasma' de barcos gaseros, similar a como lo hacía para transportar petróleo crudo y productos derivados.\nRRSS WhatsApp RRSS Facebook RRSS Twitter RRSS email 23 AGO 2024 - 18:29\nEEUU anuncia sanciones contra 400 personas y entidades vinculadas con Rusia El departamento del Tesoro estadounidense anunció este viernes sanciones contra 400 personas y entidades rusas y extranjeras involucradas en la cadena que sostiene la guerra de Moscú contra Ucrania o por ser responsables de evadir las sanciones. A través de un comunicado, el departamento liderado por Janet Yellen explicó que las sanciones, anunciadas un día antes del Día de la Independencia de Ucrania, apuntan a entidades localizadas en Rusia, Asia, Europa y Oriente Próximo cuyos productos y servicios permiten a Rusia sostener su esfuerzo bélico y evadir los castigos de Washington. El Tesoro tiene \"en la mira\" a numerosas redes transnacionales que se dedican a tareas como la adquisición de municiones y material militar para Rusia, facilitan la evasión de sanciones a los oligarcas rusos mediante servicios de constitución de sociedades y fideicomisos en el extranjero. También a otras que blanquean oro para una empresa aurífera rusa sancionada o adquieren de Rusia \"artículos sensibles y críticos\" como máquinas-herramientas avanzadas y componentes electrónicos.\nRRSS WhatsApp RRSS Facebook RRSS Twitter RRSS email 23 AGO 2024 - 17:54\nLa visita de primer ministro indio a Ucrania puede ser útil, según la Casa Blanca La Casa Blanca afirmó este viernes que la visita del primer ministro indio, Narendra Modi, a Ucrania podría resultar útil, tras haberlo criticado por abrazar al presidente ruso Vladimir Putin durante un viaje a Moscú. Si el viaje del primer ministro puede contribuir \"a poner fin al conflicto según la visión de (Volodímir) Zelenski de una paz justa, pensamos que podría resultar útil\", afirmó el portavoz del Consejo de Seguridad de la presidencia de Estados Unidos, John Kirby.\nRRSS WhatsApp RRSS Facebook RRSS Twitter RRSS email 23 AGO 2024 - 17:26\nEl primer ministro indio defiende la paz en una visita oficial a Ucrania El primer ministro indio, Narendra Modi, reiteró el viernes su llamamiento a una solución pacífica del conflicto en Ucrania durante su visita a Kiev, calificada de \"muy simbólica e histórica\" por su anfitrión, el presidente ucraniano Volodimir Zelenski. La visita de Modi, cuyo país mantiene excelentes relaciones con Moscú, se produce en un momento en que parece difícil que Rusia y Ucrania alcancen un acuerdo diplomático para poner fin a la invasión rusa, iniciada hace dos años y medio. Sentado junto a Zelenski, el primer ministro indio, de 73 años, explicó que su país apoya \"firmemente la paz\" entre las partes beligerantes.\nRRSS WhatsApp RRSS Facebook RRSS Twitter RRSS email 23 AGO 2024 - 16:09\nLa base aérea de la OTAN en Alemania restablece el nivel de alerta habitual tras una \"amenaza potencial\" La base aérea de la OTAN en la ciudad alemana de Geilenkirchen, ubicada en el estado federal de Renania del Norte-Westfalia, en el oeste de Alemania, ha anunciado el restablecimiento de su nivel de alerta habitual tras la alarma por \"amenaza potencial\" emitida el jueves. La base había declarado la \"alerta Charlie\", un evento de seguridad en caso de incidente o informaciones que sugieren \"una elevada probabilidad de acción terrorista contra la alianza\". \"Todo el personal no esencial para la misión ha sido enviado a casa como medida de precaución. La seguridad de nuestro personal es nuestra máxima prioridad. Las operaciones continúan según lo previsto\", indicó la base a través de un comunicado publicado en su perfil de la red social X. La base ha recuperado su nivel de alerta habitual \"Bravo\", el que lleva en vigor desde el estallido de la invasión rusa de Ucrania, y ha regresado a su desempeño habitual.\nRRSS WhatsApp RRSS Facebook RRSS Twitter RRSS email 23 AGO 2024 - 15:23\nOcho civiles muertos por bombardeos rusos en cuatro regiones ucranianas Al menos ocho civiles murieron por bombardeos rusos en cuatro regiones del este y el sur de Ucrania, anunciaron el viernes las autoridades ucranianas. Según las autoridades locales, dos personas murieron en la región de Sumy, situada en el noreste de Ucrania y fronteriza con la región rusa de Kursk, donde las fuerzas de Kiev llevan a cabo una ofensiva desde hace más de dos semanas. Cuatro civiles resultaron heridos en la misma región, indicó la policía ucraniana en su página web. Y un poco más al sureste, dos civiles murieron en una localidad de la región de Járkov, anunció su gobernador, Oleg Sinegubov, en Telegram. Otro cuerpo fue \"retirado de los escombros\", añadió el viernes, aludiendo a un ataque que se produjo a principios de semana en otra localidad.\nRRSS WhatsApp RRSS Facebook RRSS Twitter RRSS email 23 AGO 2024 - 15:14\nZelenski reconoce que terminar la guerra con una paz justa es una prioridad para Ucrania El presidente ucraniano, Volodímir Zelenski, afirmó este viernes en Kiev ante el primer ministro de India, Narendra Modi, que poner fin a la guerra en términos aceptables para Kiev es una cuestión prioritaria para Ucrania. \"La cuestión de terminar la guerra y lograr una paz justa es una prioridad para Ucrania\", dijo Zelenski durante su encuentro con Modi, que fue filmado parcialmente en un vídeo publicado en redes sociales por el jefe del Estado ucraniano.\nRRSS WhatsApp RRSS Facebook RRSS Twitter RRSS email 23 AGO 2024 - 13:40\nLa central nuclear de Zaporiyia corre el riesgo de sufrir otro apagón, según Energoatom La central nuclear ucraniana de Zaporiyia se enfrenta a un mayor riesgo de sufrir otro apagón después de que los bombardeos rusos dañaran una línea eléctrica que le suministraba electricidad del sistema energético ucraniano, informó este viernes su operador Energoatom .\n\"La degradación de la central nuclear de Zaporiyia, que se encuentra bajo ocupación 'rusista' desde el 4 de marzo de 2022, es cada vez más profunda. La mayor central nuclear de Europa está de nuevo al borde de un apagón \", subrayó la empresa en su canal de Telegram. Según la empresa, los bombardeos rusos dañaron el jueves la línea eléctrica PL-330kW, que le suministraba la electricidad necesaria para su funcionamiento seguro.\nRRSS WhatsApp RRSS Facebook RRSS Twitter RRSS email 23 AGO 2024 - 12:33\nUcrania afirma haber avanzado 2 kilómetros en Lugansk, tras un contraataque sorpresa Un contraataque ucraniano que infligió grandes pérdidas a las tropas rusas permitió al Ejército de Ucrania adentrarse 2 kilómetros en el territorio controlado por Rusia en la región de Lugansk (este), informó este viernes el servicio de prensa de la 3ª Brigada de Asalto, responsable de esta acción militar.\nEn un sorpresivo contraataque, la 3ª Brigada de Asalto ucraniana reivindicó la destrucción de decenas de piezas de equipo militar y la neutralización de más de 300 soldados rusos -muertos o heridos- en el ataque, que se produjo cerca de Novovodiane , en la frontera entre las regiones de Járkov y Luhansk, dijo el portavoz militar Olekandr Borodin a la emisora pública 'Suspline'.\nRRSS WhatsApp RRSS Facebook RRSS Twitter RRSS email",

Every year, the YWCA of Greater Atlanta inducts a new class into its Academy of Women of Achievement — plus an overall Woman of Achievement.\nBut this year, it did not disclose the woman who would receive the top recognition before the event because it wanted it to be a surprise.\nThe YWCA-Atlanta on April 18 held its annual luncheon at the Marriott Marquis. The surprise honoree was Phillis Wheatley, who was born in around 1753 in Gambia, Africa. She was captured and enslaved in 1761, then she was sold to the Wheatley family in Boston. The Wheatley family educated her, and soon she could read the Bible, Greek, Latin and British literature. She also studied astronomy, geography and began writing poems.

(Photo by Maria Saporta.) It was a bit like coming home when Truist CEO Bill Rogers came to speak to the Rotary Club of Atlanta on April 15.\nRogers used to live and work in Atlanta when he was CEO of SunTrust. But when SunTrust merged with BB&T of North Carolina, Rogers moved to the combined bank’s new corporate headquarters in Charlotte.\nBut it was clear many people still view Rogers as a fellow Atlantan given his reception at Rotary, where he was questioned by Katie Saez, Truist’s regional president for Truist.\nThe two discussed purpose, with Rogers saying his personal purpose “is taking care of my corner” and making sure his “corner is better because I was there.”\nRogers also said that “the real magic happens” when personal purpose intersects with business purpose.\nSaez asked Rogers about how he views downtown Atlanta, which will be hosting the College Football Playoff National Championship in 2025 and the FIFA World Cup in 2026, both at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.\n“Atlanta has all the physical assets that every city would want — hotel rooms, Mercedes-Benz Stadium…,” Rogers said. “The challenge will be how do we bring all that together, how do we have Atlanta be the live, work and play” community that is inclusive with a high quality of life.\nFor starters, Rogers said it’s important for people to get back to work in their offices.\n“You have to work downtown and get back to work in the office. We are committed to doing that. We want our people to be physically present,” Rogers said, adding that Georgia is still the largest business base for the bank — with 8,000 employees — despite being headquartered in Charlotte.\nWhen it comes to philanthropic contributions, Saez said that at the time of the merger in 2019, the new bank pledged to double its respective investments in both individual institutions over the next three years.\n“Not only did we meet that, but we exceeded that,” Saez said.\n— Maria Saporta\nISB Atlanta and Mayor Dickens mark Eid\nDignitaries gather at the Mayor’s Eid event on April 16 with Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens standing next to Soumaya Khalifa, founder of the Islamic Speakers Bureau of Atlanta.

    "title": "MTA bus driver and union rep skipped out on scheduled overtime, investigators say",
    "text": "An MTA bus driver and union official retired this spring amid an investigation by the Office of the Inspector General into allegations of overtime abuse, the Daily News has learned.\nRichard Thorne, a bus driver serving as the Transport Workers Union chairman for the Flatbush Bus Depot, was observed showing up late or not at all for pre-scheduled overtime shifts seven out of the 10 times he was surveilled between 2022 and 2023.\nThorne, a bus driver for NYC Transit since 1999, had been on release as the union’s top official at the depot for roughly 14 years. Like other union chairman in the bus division, Thorne was entitled by contract to three hours of overtime work before the start of his daily shift — primarily to move buses around the depot, sources told The News.\nThe union chair’s typical shift, during which he was supposed to attend to union business, ran from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. His “extra” — overtime — shift was scheduled from 5 a.m. to 8 a.m. each day, for which he was paid time-and-a-half.\nAccording to an investigation report produced by the MTA’s Office of the Inspector General — a copy of which was reviewed by The News — investigators surveilled Thorne on ten separate occasions over the course of a year.\nTwice while under surveillance, Thorne missed his overtime entirely, investigators said. On another occasion, he missed his overtime shift and showed up nearly a half hour late to his regular shift.\nTwice he was more than two hours late for his three-hour overtime shift, and once he was 30 minutes late for his “extra.”\nThree out of the 10 times investigators were watching, he showed up on time to move buses. On each of those 10 instances, investigators said, his timecard looked the same: three hours of overtime and an eight-hour day.\nMTA brass was alerted in March, sources said, and the agency brought Thorne up on disciplinary charges.\nSources familiar with work at the depot said the union rep put in for retirement after catching wind of the charges.\nAsked about that, Transit president Richard Davey said he was “pretty damn outraged.”\n“When I found out about [Thorne retiring], we put a hold on all his outstanding time and pay,” Davey said.\n“We had a union rep who was getting paid and wasn’t on the job,” he said. “I’ve got tens of thousands of rank-and-file bus operators [who were].”\n“On behalf of them, I was pretty outraged,” he added.\nAttempts by The News to reach Thorne for comment were unsuccessful, and a spokesperson for TWU Local 100 did not reply to a request for comment.\nThorne was the top union official at the depot last year, when a wildcat sick-out hampered bus service in Brooklyn during contract negotiations .\nMTA brass said the investigation into Thorne’s overtime was unrelated, and that they did not file any tips or complaints with the inspector general’s office.\nUnion reps are not typically required to use the MTA’s digital timecard system , given the likelihood they may have to work out of different facilities.\nNYC Transit leadership has agreed to move union officials to the digital timecards going forward, according to the OIG report.",
