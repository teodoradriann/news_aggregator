    "text": "BlockDAG Rewards Previous Buyers with 150% Bonus, While XRP and SOL Gear Up for Growth After facing dips, both XRP and Solana (SOL) are now showing signs of recovery. Solana (SOL) posted a 14% gain over the past week, moving past important price points that could signal more gains. XRP also shows promise. The latest XRP price prediction indicates that after a period of price swings, the coin may be set for an upward move, with resistance ahead at $2.50.\nMeanwhile, presale favorite BlockDAG (BDAG) is turning heads with a special offer. It’s giving every past buyer a 150% retroactive bonus . Anyone who purchased BDAG without receiving a bonus will now get 150% extra. This unexpected boost has thrilled buyers and drawn in new supporters, pushing total presale funds past $210 million.\nXRP Price Prediction: Could It Reach $3 or Fall Below $2? XRP has shown major price movement in recent weeks. Over the last month and a half, it has fluctuated between $2.03 and $2.76. After peaking at $2.76 in mid-February, it slid down to $2.03 in early March, then began recovering again. As of March 24, 2025, XRP is priced at $2.43.\nKey levels to watch in the XRP price prediction are $2.03 for support and $2.50 for resistance. If the price can push above $2.50, analysts believe it could aim for $2.76 again or even rise to $3.00. But if it dips below $2.30, there’s a chance it could head back to $2.10 or $2.00, which would be a warning sign of more downside.\nSolana (SOL) Price Surge: 14% Weekly Jump Breaks Resistance Solana has had a strong week. Its price climbed 14%, hitting $142.53. Trading volumes also jumped by nearly 95%, reaching over $2.67 billion. Open interest in SOL futures increased by 8.6%, hitting $5 billion. This strong Solana (SOL) price surge pushed the coin past the $137 resistance level, a key barrier many were watching.\nCrypto analyst Crypto Curb mentioned that this move could mark the start of a new uptrend, especially since it ends a long period of falling prices. If this trend continues, SOL could be heading for a new target of $420. Still, it may take some time before we know if this rally has real staying power.\nBlockDAG Brings a 150% Bonus for All Previous Purchases, AMA Update Confirms BlockDAG recently held an AMA session that gave the community a chance to ask questions and get updates on the project’s future. The most exciting news? A new reward system offering a 150% bonus on all past BDAG purchases. The bonus applies to those who didn’t receive any earlier rewards or got less than 150%.\nFor example, if someone previously received only 50% or 100%, their bonus will be adjusted to a total of 150%. However, anyone who has already received more than 150% won’t be included in this round. The team also plans to fix any past errors related to bonus distributions.\nThis bonus plan has created a positive buzz across the community. It shows that BlockDAG values those who supported the project early on. Now, anyone who missed earlier offers can still claim 150% more BDAG —at no additional cost.\nBlockDAG’s community-first approach is clearly working. Its presale has now raised over $210 million and is heading toward a $600 million target. With BDAG priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, market experts suggest it could hit $1 in 2025. That’s a possible 3932% return for those getting in now, making BDAG a serious player among the top decentralized crypto projects.\nWhat’s the Top Decentralized Crypto to Watch in 2025? XRP has potential, but its future remains tied to whether it can break past $2.50 or hold above $2.30. The XRP price prediction hints at either a move to $3 or a drop below $2.00 if support fails. Solana, on the other hand, has already shown signs of strength with its 14% weekly rise. The Solana (SOL) price surge also broke major resistance, and analysts see a chance for further growth.\nStill, when it comes to high returns, BlockDAG leads the pack. Touted as the next $1 token of 2025, BDAG offers early buyers a rare opportunity. With the 150% bonus now extended to past buyers, the chance to earn even more is now on the table. This offer not only boosts profits but also confirms BlockDAG’s focus on fairness and long-term value, placing it among the top decentralized crypto projects to watch right now.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: The text above is an advertorial article that is not part of Coincu.com editorial content.

    "title": "One Million Moms Goes Ballistic Over Gay TurboTax Ad",
    "text": "\nOne Million Moms, a right-wing, anti-LGBTQ organization, is livid over a humorous 30-second commercial for TurboTax featuring a same-sex couple. They are claiming that the company behind the ad is trying to “push the gay lifestyle and redefine ‘family.'”\nThe organization previously blasted TurboTax in 2023 for including a fleeting glimpse of two men marrying in a\ncommercial that also featured people doing various leisure-time activities such as hiking, chess, and yoga, as well as a heterosexual couple kissing.\nThe\nnewest ad from TurboTax features Doug and André, a mixed-race couple who say they “navigated a turbulent housing market” by buying a houseboat, which they call a “boater home.”\nAndré has his arm around Doug’s shoulder throughout the commercial, including a scene where the couple sits on a couch inside their houseboat. “We didn’t know the first thing about filing taxes as first-time homebuyers,” says André.\nMonica, a tax expert, appears on the couple’s tablet screen and informs them of the benefits of TurboTax, adding that new homeowners can file taxes with complete accuracy “on land and sea.”\nMerely showing Andre and Doug is an unforgivable offense to One Million Moms, which has chastised TurboTax for approving a commercial with a same-sex couple.\n“TurboTax should be ashamed of attempting to normalize sin in their 2024 commercial ‘Boater Home,’ which features a gay couple buying a houseboat. It appears that TurboTax is promoting same-sex marriage to please a small portion of the population while pushing away the much larger percentage of potential conservative customers,” One Million Moms wrote as part of a\npetition demanding the ad be pulled from the airwaves.\n“In an attempt to redefine ‘family,’ TurboTax is using public airwaves to subject families to the decay of morals and values while belittling the sanctity of marriage,” One Million Moms continues. “Even though homosexuality is unnatural, this advertisement is pushing the LGBTQ agenda. An even greater concern is that the controversial commercial is airing during prime time, when children are likely watching television.”\nOne Million Moms adds that even if it did not disagree morally with the ad’s message, the company’s decision to delve into contentious social issues rather than remain “neutral in the culture war” is bad business.\nCiting the Bible, One Million Moms says, “One day we will answer for our actions — or lack of them. We must remain diligent and stand up for Biblical values and truth. Scripture says multiple times that homosexuality is wrong, and God will not tolerate it (Romans 1:26-27).”\nThe petition currently has accumulated 14,204 signatures. It asks people offended by the commercial to threaten TurboTax’s financial bottom line by refusing to take advantage of the company’s services.\n“If TurboTax continues to air this inappropriate commercial, then I will avoid your services in the coming tax season,” reads the petition.\nOne Million Moms, an offshoot of the anti-LGBTQ American Family Association, frequently caterwauls against so-called “indecency,” often claiming that TV, music, movies, and other forms of entertainment media are saturated with depictions of “immorality, violence, vulgarity, and profanity.”\nSome of the organization’s past petitions and campaigns have targeted various major corporations that don’t show “family-friendly” commercials. They slammed the dating site eHarmony for\ncommercials depicting same-sex couples, called for a boycott of Oreo for selling rainbow-colored cookies during Pride season, condemned Whole Foods for sponsoring a Drag Queen Story Hour event, and demanded that the Hallmark Channel pull an ad depicting a lesbian wedding.\n ",

    "text": "La Terra si prepara all'arrivo di una forte tempesta solare: i primi effetti dovrebbero manifestarsi già stasera, mentre quelli più intensi sono previsti nella giornata di sabato 11 maggio. Il Centro di previsione meteorologica spaziale dell'agenzia statunitense Noaa ha aumentato il livello previsto per la tempesta a quello G4, il secondo più alto sulla scala, che prevede impatti sulla rete elettrica, sui sistemi di navigazione satellitare come il Gps e problemi a satelliti e veicoli spaziali, oltre alla maggiore probabilità di poter ammirare le aurore boreali anche a basse latitudini.\n\"La tempesta potrà iniziare già oggi e proseguirà poi nella giornata di domani. Ma l'attività solare si manterrà intensa anche nel prossimo periodo, ci stiamo avvicinando al picco\", dice all'ANSA Mauro Messerotti, docente di Meteorologia spaziale all'Università di Trieste.\nLa tempesta è dovuta all'intensa attività di un gigantesco gruppo di macchie solari, chiamato AR3664, che si estende per circa 200.000 chilometri, dunque 16 volte circa le dimensioni della Terra. Si tratta di una delle regioni più grandi e attive osservate in questo ciclo solare, che è iniziato a dicembre 2019. La sua estensione lo mette in grado di rivaleggiare con un altro enorme gruppo di macchie solari, quello di Carington, che fece sentire i suoi effetti tra agosto e settembre 1859, provocando incendi negli uffici del telegrafo e innescando aurore vicino all'equatore. \"La regione AR3664 è caratterizzata da una grande complessità, con campi magnetici molto intensi che causano una situazione particolarmente instabile - osserva Messerotti - ed è così grande che è visibile anche ad occhio nudo, ovviamente sempre con un'adeguata protezione\".\n© RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",

    "text": "As CNN explains above, Justin Mohn has been charged for allegedly beheading his father, then posting the severed head on YouTube while ranting about the Biden administration, immigration and calling his father a traitor for having worked for the federal government. The video remained on YouTube for more than five hours before the site removed it. Not surprisingly, Mohn has long showed signs of dangerous paranoia. In December, his former employers found what they called a violent manifesto that Mohn had apparently left behind. He also made what was deemed threatening statements about a judge who had dismissed his multiple lawsuits, including one suing the federal government for giving him a student loan for college that did not make him as successful as he had hoped. But that doesn’t mean Mohn’s connection to right-wing extremism should be dismissed or downplayed. CNN’s John Miller, the network’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, made the point that Mohn is part of a now-too-familiar pattern. “Every few weeks we see one of these what the behavioral science experts call an injustice collector, “ Miller said. “Everything's going wrong in their life. None of it is their fault. It's the deep state. It's the migrants. It's that they're a white male or some some other thing that in these echo chambers, in these chat rooms on the internet, people kind of egg each other on about somebody's got to step up and do something.” Former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now a CNN analyst, was [more explicit](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/31/us/justin-mohn-father-beheaded-biden-video/index.html) about the connection to right-wing extremism: “The bigger picture here is that this is another example of the fact that the kind of overheated, deeply politicized, extreme rhetoric that you hear sometimes in this country from politically elected officials and leaders actually has an impact on these marginalized people with extremist views who might be … driven to embark in acts of violence,\" he said. CNN’s Oliver Darcy was even more explicit in his [Reliable Sources](https://view.newsletters.cnn.com/messages/1706758887420631184aedad5/raw?utm_term=1706758887420631184aedad5&utm_source=cnn_Reliable+Sources+-+Jan.+31%2C+2024&utm_medium=email&bt_ee=ypBxhmPj1lkbHNKrRagdWH2DIKrOK%2FmEk2w9FSTIegqWyIQtH87VXh983ugeP0cj&bt_ts=1706758887422) newsletter. He called the beheading “part of a larger trend of right-wing violence afflicting the country” and linked it to “the Charlottesville car attack, the Charleston church shooting, the Buffalo supermarket shooting, the El Paso Walmart shooting, and, of course, the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, among others.” Darcy also connected the dots to Trump and right-wing media. “Prior to Trump's ascension, conspiracy-laden messages were largely confined to the seedy cesspools of the web like 4chan and Infowars, where fringe hosts such as Alex Jones ranted to marginalized audiences,” he wrote. “Now, extremist commentary airs regularly on Fox News. It is dispersed on A.M. radios from coast to coast. It is commonplace on conservative news and commentary websites. And it proliferates on social media platforms, where right-wing extremists maintain a loud presence and boast millions of followers.” Is there any doubt that Mohn’s media diet consisted of the same outlets spewing the same rhetoric as he did?",
