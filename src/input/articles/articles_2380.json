    "title": "Canadian actress Evelyne Brochu stars with Zach Braff, Vanessa Hudgens in new rom-com",
    "text": "In “French Girl,” a new romantic comedy from Canadian writer-directors James A. Woods and Nicolas Wright, Quebec City is as much of a character as the film’s lead roles.\nIt was the “perfect setting,” said star Evelyne Brochu, a French Canadian actress known for her work on the sci-fi TV series “Orphan Black.”\n“It's romantic. It has a bit of a taste of Europe,” she said in a virtual interview. “I feel like in rom-coms, cities are often a character, if you think about Seattle, if you could think of it like New York, Paris … It's the city where you want to walk hand-in-hand with someone.”\nThe movie follows Gordon, played by Zach Braff, a hopeless New York City romantic whose plan to propose to his girlfriend Sophie, portrayed by Brochu, is thrown into chaos. A job offer at the Fairmont Le Château Frontenac from sophisticated celebrity chef Ruby – played by Vanessa Hudgens – who also happens to be Sophie’s ex, lures her back to her hometown of Quebec City.\nDetermined to keep their love alive, Gordon follows his girlfriend, only to find himself hilariously out of his depth in attempting to charm her hard-to-impress, French-speaking family.\nBrochu, who is from Quebec City, said she signed on to do the film because it’s a “love letter to French Canadian women, French Canadian families,” and the city itself.\nShe felt a real connection to her character, especially since she’s a francophone who is dating an anglophone from Montreal. She said the filmmakers captured a world she knew well.\nFor Braff, it was the elements of comedy that drew him in, but also his love of Quebec cities.\n“My reps had said that it's kind of in the tone of ‘Meet the Parents,’ which is a movie I love, but with a twist and also it’s taking place in French Canada, which was interesting to me because I love Montreal,” he said. “And I just laughed through the whole thing. I was like, ‘Sign me up. I'm in.’”\nBraff, who starred in the TV comedy “Scrubs,” said this latest project was in his wheelhouse.\n“I just love comedies like this. They don't make a lot of movies like this anymore.”\nThe movie was mostly filmed in Montreal and Quebec City, and the cast said the atmosphere added to the filming experience.\nBraff noted that the cast stayed in the Château Frontenac in Quebec City while filming their scenes there. He also billed Montreal’s Old Town as “one of the prettiest places in North America.”\n\"High School Musical\" franchise star Vanessa Hudgens, who had previously filmed in Montreal about 12 years ago, was equally charmed.\n“It really is such a magical place, truly unlike anywhere else,” she said. “There's just like an old world air about it that just feels really magical.”\nHudgens, who has starred in several rom-coms, including “The Princess Switch,” said she loved returning to the genre, but added that it afforded her a chance to put on a different hat – and play the villain.\n“This is one where the women are really empowered, which is always just lovely to be able to see and to tell that story.”\n“French Girl” hits theatres on Friday.\n– Marriska Fernandes is a Toronto-based entertainment journalist, host and film critic.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published March 14, 2024.\nMarriska Fernandes, The Canadian Press",

    "title": "The Business of Rugby: How South African Teams Have Boosted URC Profits to an All-Time High ·",
    "text": "When it was announced in 2021 that the Pro14 would be rebranded as the United Rugby Championship (URC), with South Africa’s top franchises joining the European-based competition, the decision was met with a wave of scepticism.\nSome of the loudest criticism came from Ulster, where club officials were wary of disrupting the traditional structure of European rugby by including teams from the Southern Hemisphere in what was seen as a sacred competition.\nSouth African Franchises Improve URC Standard\nThe South African perspective implied that the reservations were driven more by a fear of competition than by a genuine desire to preserve the integrity of European rugby.\nTo some extent, it might have been a justified retort as every final since has been contested by a South African side. Tellingly, this doesn’t look like changing in 2025 as the Pretoria-based Bulls are one of the favourites to win the URC at 5/1 with Paddy Power betting odds.\nAs for what these odds mean, you can use an online returns tool provided by the Irish bookmaker to calculate bets so that you better understand probability, whether they’re singles, doubles, or even accumulators using an acca calculator. On this occasion, a £5 single bet on the Bulls to win the 2025 URC at 5/1 would show a return of £30 in total, including a £25 profit.\nIn other words, the expectation around South African teams winning the URC is so high that you’re unlikely to win a fortune should they do so. The Stormers did, after all, win the very first edition of the URC in 2022 when they beat the Bulls in Cape Town.\nThe reality is that the inclusion of teams from the Rainbow Nation has undoubtedly raised the standard of the URC on the pitch which is no surprise when you consider that South Africa are back-to-back world champions. As a result, the URC now stands among the highest-quality rugby leagues globally.\nHowever, when considering the scenario purely from a business perspective, has it made economic sense?\nRecord Revenue\nThe answer is an unequivocal “yes,” according to Martin Anayi, CEO of the URC. Speaking in December, Anayi revealed that more than half of the league’s revenue now comes from South Africa.\nThis surge is largely attributed to the URC’s lucrative television deal with South African broadcaster Supersport. Additionally, the inclusion of South African teams in the URC has seen the arrival of new sponsors from the Rainbow Nation, namely Vodacom, which is a South African-based telecommunications company with a monopoly on the industry.\nCrucially, this influx of new sponsors extends beyond the URC given that South African teams have also been granted permission to compete in the European Rugby Champions Cup (EPCR).\nAs a result of these teams being given the green light to compete on the continent, Johannesburg-based international bank and wealth management company Investec stepped in as the league’s title sponsor.\nThe Bottom Line\nUndoubtedly, the financial knock-on effect from the decision—an admittedly unorthodox one to allow Southern Hemisphere teams to compete in a European tournament—has been far-reaching.\nEven those in Ulster, who had initially expressed justified concerns about the amalgamation, will now see the benefits of having teams from the most successful rugby nation on earth playing in their league.\nIndeed, wherever the best players on the planet go, the money is never too far behind, and right now, the URC has become a product that is watched in every corner of the globe.\nThe question now might be why this decision wasn’t made sooner as the URC revenue is now the highest of all time.",

    "title": "Delhi Minister unveils renovated water regulator to control floods in Monsoon - India Today",
    "text": "Delhi Minister unveils renovated water regulator to control floods in Monsoon Delhi's Irrigation and Flood Control Minister, Saurabh Bharadwaj, announced the renovation of 14 regulators on drains to prevent flooding. Listen to Story Delhi Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj on Thursday gave a detailed presentation on flood preparedness and said his department has renovated the regulators on 14 drains to avoid flooding in the national capital. He said the department has made pilot cuts wherever there were islands to facilitate the movement of water. \"Some of the locations include the ITO bridge, Old Railway bridge, near Vasudev Ghat. Making pilot cuts is a temporary measure to create an additional passage for the extra discharge during flood,\" he said. The department has also restored the regulator of drain number 12 near the WHO Building, which had broken during the flood last year causing areas like ITO to submerge, he said. The Indraprastha water regulator was breached July 17 last year due to a strong current in the Yamuna when the water level of the river reached its highest in 70 years, peaking at 208.66 metres, much above the danger mark of 205.33 metres. The previous high of 207.49 metres was recorded in 1978. \"There are 14 drains that have regulators and they have all been restored. At the Tanga Stand regulator, the height of the gate has been increased from 3.45 metre to 4.45 metre. Similarly, the gate height at the Metcalf House regulator has also been increased from 3.25 metres to 4.25 metre,\" Bharadwaj added. The department also has plans to construct a stepped ramp at the Monastery market where there was heavy flooding last year. However, construction on the structure will be done after consultation with the market association, he said, adding that the issue is being coordinated by the district magistrates of east and central districts. Bharadwaj said the primary cause of flooding in Delhi was water being discharged into the Yamuna at Hathnikund barrage of Haryana, which is exacerbated by heavy rain. To protect the city, direct drainage discharge is halted through regulators when the river's level increases, warnings are issued at 204.5 metres, and evacuations begin at 205.33 metres, he said. The minister said the first level of warning is triggered when the discharge from Hathnikund Barrage for Yamuna river exceeds 1 lakh cusecs. At that time, public announcements are made to warn people. If the discharge exceeds 3 lakh cusecs, the people living on the river embankments will be warned and arrangement will be made to shift them to a safer location by the Revenue department, he said. The third warning is triggered when the discharge exceeds 5 lakh cusecs and in that scenario, people living in flood prone areas will be shifted to higher altitude place, he added. In cities like Mumbai drainage water is discharged into the sea, but in Delhi, we have to discharge it into the Yamuna River. When the Yamuna's level increases then we stop the direct drainage discharge into the Yamuna, to prevent Yamuna's water from entering into the city. And when this happens then we're forced to use pumps to discharge the water. This year we're all geared up and pumps are ready,\" he said. He also said the water discharge from other states is minimal. \"Once water is discharged from the mountains and Haryana, the first level of warning is issued in Delhi. It takes 36 to 72 hours for the water released from the Hathnikund Barrage to reach Delhi,\" Bharadwaj added. The Central Water Commission informs us about the probability, timing, and potential breach, he said, adding, last year, these arrangements were manual, but this year, everything is online. The Flood Control Department will receive real-time data on water levels, he said. \"It should be noted that large towers are being built in the areas around Haryana's Najafgarh Lake, which might potentially cause floods in both Delhi and Haryana. On the Haryana side of Najafgarh Lake, these constructions are causing water to accumulate, posing a risk to both states. We have written to Haryana's Chief Secretary and the Chief Minister, requesting them to stop these constructions,\" the minister said. He said they are also working on desilting of drainage and have been successful in desilting 12,97,000 lakh metric tons. \"We have also set up a flood control room in Shastri Nagar wherein we get real-time online updates,\" he added.",

    "text": "\"Le morti sul lavoro, gli infortuni, la precarietà, la dignità sottratta perché i salari non sono da tempo adeguati al costo della vita e vengono addirittura aggrediti dalle vergognose leggi di bilancio della peggiore destra della storia italiana. E poi ancora: la disoccupazione che svilisce i giovani e il diritto alla salute calpestato. I liguri si sono espressi chiaramente in piazza, ribadendo a chiare lettere cosa pensano della manovra, del ministro Salvini e della presidente del Consiglio Meloni: la loro inadeguatezza fa sempre più il paio con la loro miopia di fronte alle istanze dei cittadini\". Lo dichiara il consigliere regionale del M5S Stefano Giordano oggi in piazza per sostenere lo sciopero generale indetto da Cigl e Uil.\n \"Ma il Governo è in buona compagnia: il neo presidente Bucci non si è visto in piazza e dunque ha scelto da che parte stare: da quella di chi sta mandando in rovina il nostro Paese con decisioni degne dei peggiori Governi tecnici del passato (che la destra aveva peraltro promesso di contrastare!) e mortifica i cittadini con manovre lacrime e sangue alla Monti & C. Come M5S, siamo al fianco di tutti i lavoratori che oggi hanno scioperato non solo per sé stessi, rinunciando a una giornata intera di stipendio, ma per tutti gli italiani che chiedono più equità salariale, più sanità, più sicurezza sul posto di lavoro, più trasporti efficienti. Più diritti. Mai meno. E Salvini se ne faccia una ragione\".",

    "text": "Una iglesia y una sede social quedaron totalmente destruidas este sábado tras registrarse un ataque incendiario en la comuna de Contulmo, al sur de Chile, en la región del Biobío, zona donde se desarrolla un antiguo conflicto territorial entre el Estado, empresas de extracción maderera y comunidades indígenas. Según medios locales, el ataque tuvo lugar durante la madrugada en el sector de Huillinco Alto, cuando un grupo de desconocidos percutió disparos en el lugar para luego quemar los inmuebles. No se registraron heridos. Se trata del segundo ataque incendiario registrado en Contulmo esta semana, luego de que el pasado jueves cinco casas resultaran destruidas por la acción de terceros, además de cortes de ruta y enfrentamientos con fuerzas de seguridad. El delegado presidencial provincial de Arauco, Humberto Toro, calificó los hechos de “inaceptables” y afirmó que los ataques son perpetrados por “grupitos que están tratando de generar actos de violencia en función de proteger a un delincuente”, haciendo referencia a Camilo Astete Catrileo, detenido por homicidio. Desde mediados de 2022, en la zona rige un estado de excepción constitucional ratificado por el Congreso, herramienta constitucional que permite el despliegue militar en la zona para que ayude a Carabineros (Policía militarizada) a controlar el orden público, incluyendo vigilancia en las principales carreteras y caminos aledaños. En La Araucanía y otras zonas del sur de Chile, como Biobío, existe desde hace décadas una disputa territorial entre el Estado, algunas comunidades mapuche y empresas forestales que explotan tierras consideradas ancestrales por los indígenas. El pueblo mapuche, la etnia indígena más numerosa de Chile, reclama los territorios que habitaron durante siglos, antes de que fueran ocupadas a la fuerza por el Estado chileno a fines del siglo XIX en un proceso conocido oficialmente como la “Pacificación de La Araucanía” y que ahora pertenecen en su mayoría a empresas forestales. En este contexto son frecuentes los ataques incendiarios a maquinaria y predios, un conflicto que le ha costado la vida a un gran número de comuneros mapuche a manos de agentes del Estado, registrándose además la muerte de policías y huelgas de hambre de presos indígenas.
