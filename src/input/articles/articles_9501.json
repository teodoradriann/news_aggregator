Request for free Sample Pages: https://www.insightaceanalytic.com/request-sample/1693 Castor oil and its derivatives are multifunctional compounds widely utilized in producing paints, lubricants, coatings, cosmetics, medicines, and other goods. These derivatives are gaining prominence due to their superior chemical characteristics. Major ingredient manufacturers are introducing castor oil-based compounds to capitalize on green chemical market prospects. Furthermore, increased research and development activities and increased investment are predicted to improve castor oil-based biopolymer market development. Because of outstanding properties such as being a very breathable, ultra-light, and super stretch product, the use of bio-polyamides in various apparel companies is gaining traction. Additionally, the global castor oil-based biopolymer market growth is likely to profit from the expanding home appliances industry in developing nations due to rising disposable income and an increase in nuclear families, among other factors. List of Prominent Players in the Castor Oil-Based Biopolymer Market: • EOS GmbH • AWAKE CONCEPT • NEUBAU EYEWEAR gmbh • Lanxess AG • BIO-FED • Asahi Kasei Corporation • Arkema • Evonik Industries AG • BASF SE • EMS-Chemie Holding AG • Solvay S.A. • Toray Industries, Inc. • UNITIKA LTD. • RadiciGroup • Fulgar SpA • DSM • DuPont de Nemours, Inc. • Mitsui Chemicals Inc. • Nexis Fibers • VAUDE Sport GmbH & Co. KG Market Dynamics: Drivers- Castor oil and its derivatives have significant advantages over other vegetable oils due to their unique fatty acid composition. Cotton, coconut, soy, corn, and rapeseed oil applications are primarily limited to food reasons. Regarding physicochemical qualities, castor oil derivatives are renewable, natural, and adaptable. As a result, these products are selected as a key raw material in a variety of applications, including lubricants, oleo-chemicals, medical, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and bio-energy. Because of the growing relevance of green chemicals worldwide, the market is likely to rise steadily in the future. Challenges: Castor oil is a feedstock for the manufacture of various derivatives. Temperature, light, rainfall, soil properties, latitude, and altitude are all factors that influence castor oil yield. The yield determines the price of castor oil. The volatile pricing has an impact on downstream production and demand for castor oil derivatives, lowering profit margins. Yet, the fast adoption of modern agricultural practices supported by government legislation will boost the oil business in the near future. Regional Trends: The Asia Pacific castor oil-based biopolymer market is expected to account for a major market share in terms of revenue. It is projected to grow at a high CAGR in the near future. India has become a manufacturer and exporter of castor oil and its derivatives, such as 12-hydroxy stearic acid, dehydrated castor oil, castor wax, and undecylenic acid, as a result of the number of castor seeds. India's top export destinations are China, the United States, and the European Union. According to The Solvent Extractors Association of India, China accounts for over 40% of Indian castor oil exports, followed by Europe (30-35%). Europe was the second-largest user of castor oil derivatives. In the near future, the market is likely to rise due to increased adoption and favorable government policies surrounding the usage of bio-based chemicals.

    "title": "Equiocio acogerá gracias a Gadis talleres para aprender a crear un huerto casero - Ferrol Ocio y Cultura - COPE",
    "text": "De la mano de Gadis, niños y mayores podrán iniciarse en el mundo de la agricultura creando su propio huerto en Equiocio Ferrol. La firma patrocinará este año una amplia programación de talleres medio ambientales en los que los jovenes y no tan jóvenes aprenderán técnicas de cultivo y se familiarizarán con conceptos como sostenibilidad y alimentación saludable. Así lo avanzaron este jueves la directora de Márketing y RSC de Gadis, Melisa Pagliaro, y la directora de Equiocio Ferrol, Ana Pérez Lago, que, acompañadas del alcalde de la ciudad, José Manuel Rey Varela; del delegado de área de Ferrol y consejero de la firma, José Carlos Díaz Arnau, y del concejal de Deportes, Ricardo Aldrey, presentaban la iniciativa.Un acto que concluía con la rúbrica del acuerdo entre Equiocio Ferrol y Gadis. Los talleres buscan recuperar la conexión con el rural, especialmente de las nuevas generaciones, a través del aprendizaje y la transmisión de conocimientos, despertando el interés de niños y niñas por crear sus propios huertos en sus viviendas -jardines, balcones o terrazas-, propiciando al mismo tiempo una relación más sostenible con el entorno y poniendo en valor el trabajo de los productores locales. ¿CÓMO SERÁN LOS TALLERES? La programación se desarrollará entre el viernes 2 y el domingo 4 de agosto, de 11 a 14 horas y de 16 a 20 horas, con grupos de un máximo de 15 participantes. Habrá 3 categorías de participación: familiar (niños/as y personas adultas), infantil y mixtos (con personas de diferentes edades), y los talleres tendrán una duración de 30 minutos -con la previsión de realizar cerca de 40 durante las 3 jornadas-. Así, los monitores ayudarán a los participantes a reconocer las plantas en función de su aprovechamiento para el consumo humano, enseñándoles a trasplantar sin riesgos -aire en las raíces, exceso de humedad o sequedad o falta de nutrientes, entre otros- o mostrándoles los cuidados específicos que precisan. En función del grupo, y centrándose en sus preferencias, se seleccionarán los cultivos más adecuados para sus futuros huertos, ampliando información e indicaciones y solventando sus dudas. Como colofón a la actividad, los participantes podrán llevarse su propia planta para, así, iniciar su plantación en casa. REPARTO DE UN MILLAR DE PLANTASMelisa Pagliaro detallaba que Gadis prevé el reparto de un millar de plantas, pertenecientes a 52 variedades diferentes. Un auténtico aliciente para participar en la actividad que Gadis presenta como un juego con el que aprender, y mucho, sobre cultivos. En representación del evento, Ana Pérez Lago agradecía el apoyo fundamental que desde hace 25 años brinda Gadis, y reiteraba que Equiocio Ferrol no sería lo que es sin la empresa, todo un referente en Galicia, además de agradecer el respaldo de instituciones como el Ayuntamiento, presente hoy en la firma. Por su parte, el alcalde, José Manuel Rey, reivindicó Equiocio Ferrol como uno de los eventos señalados del calendario de la ciudad, construído en base a la unión de esfuerzos. Y así, uniendo voluntades, es como se hace ciudad y como crece Equiocio Ferrol. Además, el regidor agradeció el compromiso de una empresa gallega como Gadis que, a través de su responsabilidad social corporativa, colabora desde hace tantos años con esta cita. Equiocio Ferrol es un evento deportivo de primer nivel, y organizarlo exige tesón porque, sin constancia, las cosas no crecen, concluyó. El acto contó, además, con la asistencia de una amplia representación de las entidades del ámbito sociosanitario de Equiocio Social, así como de Fernando Mosquera, adjunto al delegado de área de Ferrol de Gadis, y de Lucía Santos, coordinadora de Responsabilidad Social Corporativa de la firma.",

    "text": "转自：内蒙古日报\n□本报记者 帅政\n　　眼下，在包头市明拓集团铬业科技有限公司，两台球团带式焙烧机烟气超低排放技改工程正加快实施。\n　　明拓集团铬业科技有限公司副总经理张国强告诉记者，通过此次超低排放技术改造，预计可实现颗粒物减排6.63吨/年、二氧化硫减排15.62吨/年、氮氧化物减排312.3吨/年。\n　　近年来，包头市统筹绿色低碳产业发展、能源绿色低碳转型和污染治理、生态保护，协同推进降碳减污扩绿增长，不断提升经济发展“含绿量”。\n　　日前，包头市固阳县与内蒙古欣美环保科技有限公司签署《内蒙古欣美环保科技有限公司资源综合利用项目投资协议》，这标志着又一资源综合利用项目落户包头金山经济开发区。\n　　据悉，欣美环保12万吨电解铝废渣综合利用项目，设计产能为年处理12万吨电解铝废渣，通过对铝产业废渣的高效分离、提纯和再利用，实现废渣资源化、无害化处理，助力开发区在电解铝废渣方面的“吃干榨净”。\n　　向新“碳”路，向绿而行。不久前，自治区发改委刚刚公布了自治区碳达峰试点名单，包头市达茂旗、白云鄂博矿区、稀土高新技术产业开发区和金山经济开发区榜上有名。\n　　近年来，包头市通过加强顶层设计，完善政策体系，明确了碳达峰碳中和的时间表和路线图。同时，优化产业结构，大力发展新能源等战略性新兴产业，加快传统产业绿色化改造。在能源方面，推进能源革命，加快发展风电、光伏等可再生能源，构建清洁低碳能源体系。此外，还加强生态建设，持续开展国土绿化，保护和修复生态系统，提升碳汇能力，并创建碳计量中心和碳汇监测系统，基本形成全市碳汇“一张图”。\n　　“以此次试点为契机，坚定不移走生态优先、绿色发展之路，为自治区实现碳达峰碳中和目标作出积极贡献。”包头市发改委环资科负责人郑义表示。",
