    "text": "My father, Bob Quick, who has died aged 68, was a senior trade union official and passionate defender of the NHS .\nWhile training as a nurse as a teenager, he made an early mark by leading a Confederation of Health Service Employees union campaign in support of a pay rise for nurses in 1974, after which he left nursing to become Cohse’s youngest full-time regional official at the age of 19.\nHe spent 24 years as a paid officer with Cohse, involved in all aspects of industrial relations – from representing members in grievance procedures, misconduct hearings, pay negotiations and industrial disputes to building campaigns and organising and training shop stewards.\nContinuing with Cohse after its merger with two other public sector unions to form Unison , he was an internationalist to the core, and later led trade union education projects in Bulgaria, Romania and South Africa. Also involved in solidarity work in Cuba, he was awarded a national medal in that country for helping to deliver medical aid during the US blockade.\nBob Quick led trade union education projects in Bulgaria, Romania and South Africa Bob was born in Lichfield, Staffordshire, to a Liverpudlian father, Jim, and an Irish mother, Teresa (nee Geary), both of whom were nurses. Raised in Chester , where he went to Grange secondary modern school in Ellesmere Port and then Upton-by-Chester high school, he followed in his parents’ footsteps, training as a nurse at 16.\nHis father had been a leading activist in Cohse since its inception in 1946, so it was natural that Bob soon became involved with the union too. In the early 80s he also served as a Labour councillor in Liverpool , spending time as chair of its library and arts committee.\nHe left Unison in 1999 to become a UK project manager for the Community Mental Health Managers Association and then, in 2000, a workplace learning consultant at Derby College. In 2002 he joined West Yorkshire health authority as a learning development manager before moving in 2003 to be deputy head for Yorkshire and Humber at the NHS University, which trained NHS staff.\nWhen the NHS University was closed in 2005, he crossed the shop floor to take on managerial roles with NHS trusts in Barnsley (as deputy director of HR, 2005-09) and Rotherham (associate director of HR, 2009-13), and then became an HR consultant with the Bart’s trust in London.\nEventually, however, his love of the trade union movement drew him back in 2014 to be national officer for the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association , and in 2021 to be London regional officer for the Society of Radiographers .\nWorking mainly from home in those two jobs, he was able in 2016 to move to the village of Cromford in the Peak District of Derbyshire, saying: “If I can’t live near to the Med or by the sea, I shall have views of hills and castles.” He retired in 2022.\nBob’s first two marriages, to Pauline and Gayle, both ended in divorce. He is survived by his third wife, Helen, whom he married in 2010, as well as two daughters, Alice and me, from his first marriage, two children, Joe and Abigayle, from his second, and two stepchildren, Emma and Paul, from Helen’s previous marriage, and eight grandchildren.\nExplore more on these topics Trade unions Other lives Unison Liverpool Chester Cuba Nursing NHS obituaries\nReuse this content",

    "text": "FILE PHOTO: Canada&#039;s Minister of Foreign Affairs Melanie Joly speaks during a reception honouring the visit of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada October 26, 2022. REUTERS/Blair Gable/File Photo OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada on Thursday imposed sanctions on seven Israeli settlers it said had taken part in extremist violence in the West Bank, the second time in just over a month Ottawa has taken such a step. The foreign ministry said it had also imposed punitive measures on five entities, including settler organizations. &quot;We remain deeply concerned by extremist settler violence in the West Bank and condemn such acts, not only for the significant impact they have on Palestinian lives, but also for the corrosive impact they have on prospects for lasting peace,&quot; Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in a statement. Violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank was already at a more than 15-year high in 2023 and surged further after Israel&#039;s war in the separate enclave of Gaza in response to the Palestinian militant group Hamas&#039; attack on Oct. 7. Those Canada targeted include Ben-Zion Gopstein, founder and leader of the right-wing group Lehava, which opposes Jewish assimilation with non-Jews. Also listed are Elisha Yered, who has justified killing Palestinians on religious grounds, and Shalom Zicherman, who the U.S. State Department this year said had assaulted Israeli activists and their vehicles in the West Bank. Canada&#039;s sanctions follow similar measures by allies including the United States and Britain. The measures prohibit dealings related to the individuals and render them inadmissible to Canada, the foreign ministry said. Ottawa imposed sanctions on four settlers last month.

    "title": "US presidential candidate slammed for failing to say slavery caused Civil War",
    "text": "A 2024 US presidential candidate was roasted when she was asked what the cause of the American Civil War was and failed to mention slavery.\nNikki Haley, a former US ambassador to the\nUnited Nations, was asked by an attendee at her town hall debate on Wednesday night in Berlin, New Hampshire, what triggered the war between states in the North and South in the 1860s.\nThe Republican candidate and former South Carolina governor turned around, paused momentarily and then joked, ‘Well, don’t come with an easy question.’\nHaley, 51, then replied: ‘I mean I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how\ngovernment was going to run, the freedoms and what people could and couldn’t do.’\nShe then asked the attendee what he thought was the cause of the Civil War. The man said he was not the one running for the White House.\nHaley continued that she believes ‘it always comes down to the role of government’ and that she will always believe that it is meant to secure people’s rights and freedoms but not get in the way of their liberties.\nThe voter then told Haley: ‘In 2023, it’s astonishing to me that you would answer that question without mentioning the word slavery.’\nHaley shot back, ‘What do you want me to say about slavery?’ then smiled and said, ‘Next question.’\nPresident Joe Biden late Wednesday\nshared the clip of Haley on X (formerly Twitter) and remarked: ‘It was about slavery.’\nMeanwhile, Democratic National Committee Jaime Harrison told\nCBS: ‘This isn’t hard, condemning slavery is the baseline for anyone who wants to be president of the United States, but Nikki Haley and the rest of the MAGA (Make America Great Again) GOP are choking on their words trying to rewrite history.’\nHaley has been gaining support in state and national polls. An American Research Group Inc survey released last week showed that Haley was within four percentage points of ex-President\nDonald Trump in New Hampshire. Haley served as UN ambassador under Trump, who remains the frontrunner for the GOP nomination.\nOn Thursday morning amid backlash, Haley sought to clarify her comment.\n‘I mean, of course the Civil War was about slavery,’ Haley said on the Good Morning New Hampshire radio show.\n‘But what’s the lesson in all of that? That we need to make sure that every person has freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to do and be anything they want to be without anyone or government getting in the way.\n‘That was the goal of what that was at. Yes, I know it was about slavery. I’m from the South, of course I know it’s about slavery.’\nShe also appeared to accuse the voter who asked her the question of being a ‘Democrat Plant’ possibly sent by Biden or his party.\n‘Why is Biden doing that?’ Haley said. ‘Why isn’t he doing that to any other candidate?’\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at .\nFor more stories like this,\ncheck our news page.\nSign Up for News Updates\nGet your need-to-know latest news, feel-good stories, analysis and more\nPrivacy Policyand Terms of Serviceapply.",
