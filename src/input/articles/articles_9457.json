    "text": "Decoding Beard Algae: A Comprehensive Guide for Aquarists Beard algae, also known as black beard algae (BBA) or brush algae , is a common and often frustrating nuisance in aquariums. Belonging to the red algae family (Rhodophyta), specifically the genera Audouinella and Rhodochorton , it manifests as dark green to blackish-grey tufts or dense patches of fine filaments. These resilient algae attach firmly to plant leaves , decorations , and even glass surfaces , resembling a dirty, unkempt beard. While not directly harmful to fish, beard algae can outcompete plants for resources, detract from the aesthetic appeal of your tank, and indicate underlying imbalances in your aquarium’s ecosystem. Mastering beard algae management requires understanding its causes, implementing effective removal strategies, and establishing preventative measures.\nUnderstanding the Enemy: Beard Algae Characteristics Visual Identification Beard algae presents itself as short, bristly tufts or dense mats. Its color ranges from dark green to greyish-black , although it can appear reddish when exposed to alcohol due to its red algae classification. It clings tenaciously to surfaces, making it difficult to remove by hand alone.\nCauses and Contributing Factors Several factors contribute to beard algae outbreaks:\nPoor Water Quality: Elevated levels of organic waste , ammonia , nitrites , or nitrates provide fuel for algae growth. Insufficient or Fluctuating CO2 Levels: In planted tanks, unstable or inadequate carbon dioxide (CO2) levels disrupt plant health, weakening their ability to compete with algae. Inadequate Circulation: Poor water movement allows nutrients to stagnate, creating favorable conditions for algae development in localized areas. Excessive Light: Overly intense or prolonged lighting periods promote algae growth. Imbalanced Nutrient Levels: An excess of certain nutrients, such as phosphates , can contribute to algae proliferation. Overfeeding: Uneaten food decomposes, releasing nutrients that feed algae blooms. Lack of Competition from Healthy Plants: Weak or unhealthy plants struggle to utilize nutrients effectively, leaving them available for algae. Why is Beard Algae So Troublesome? Beard algae is notorious for its resilience. Its strong grip makes manual removal challenging, and its ability to thrive in a wide range of conditions makes it difficult to eradicate completely. It can quickly spread, covering plants and decor, hindering plant growth by blocking light and consuming vital nutrients.\nCombating the Beard: Removal and Control Strategies Manual Removal Physical Extraction: Use a stiff toothbrush or algae scraper to scrub beard algae off hard surfaces. For heavily infested plant leaves, it’s often best to prune them. Siphoning: After scrubbing, use a gravel vacuum or siphon to remove dislodged algae and debris from the substrate. Chemical Treatments (Use with Caution) Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2): A 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide can be applied directly to affected areas outside of the tank. Let it sit for 5 minutes, then rinse thoroughly before returning the item to the aquarium. Note: Use this treatment sparingly and monitor your tank inhabitants closely, as high concentrations can be harmful. Liquid Carbon (Glutaraldehyde): Products containing glutaraldehyde (e.g., Seachem Excel) can be effective against beard algae when used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. However, overdosage can harm sensitive plants and invertebrates. Algicides: As a last resort, consider using commercially available algicides specifically designed for aquarium use. Always follow the product instructions carefully and monitor your tank for any adverse effects. Biological Control Algae-Eating Fish: Certain fish species, such as Siamese Algae Eaters (SAE) and Florida Flagfish , are known to consume beard algae. However, their effectiveness varies, and some may become less interested in algae as they mature. Snails: Nerite snails are effective algae grazers, consuming various types of algae, including softer patches of BBA. Shrimp: While Amano shrimp are renowned algae eaters, they typically prefer other algae types over BBA. Improving Water Quality Regular Water Changes: Perform regular water changes (25-50% weekly) to remove excess nutrients and maintain water quality. Proper Filtration: Ensure your filter is adequately sized for your tank and is properly maintained. Reduce Overfeeding: Feed your fish only the amount of food they can consume within a few minutes. Vacuum the Substrate: Regularly vacuum the substrate to remove accumulated debris and organic waste. Optimizing CO2 Levels (for Planted Tanks) Consistent CO2 Injection: Maintain stable and adequate CO2 levels using a reliable CO2 injection system. Monitor CO2 Levels: Use a drop checker to monitor CO2 levels and adjust accordingly. Adjusting Lighting Reduce Light Intensity: Lower the intensity of your aquarium lights. Shorten Lighting Period: Reduce the duration of your lighting period to 8-10 hours per day. Use a Timer: Use a timer to ensure consistent and controlled lighting. Prevention: The Key to Long-Term Success Maintain Excellent Water Quality: This is the cornerstone of algae prevention. Promote Healthy Plant Growth: Healthy plants outcompete algae for nutrients and resources. Avoid Overfeeding: Prevent the accumulation of excess nutrients. Maintain Proper Circulation: Ensure adequate water flow throughout the tank. Quarantine New Plants: Before introducing new plants to your aquarium, quarantine them to prevent the introduction of algae spores. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Is beard algae harmful to fish? No, beard algae is not directly harmful to fish. However, excessive growth can deplete oxygen levels and hinder plant growth, indirectly affecting fish health.\n2. What are the best fish for eating beard algae? Siamese Algae Eaters (SAE) and Florida Flagfish are among the most effective fish for consuming beard algae. However, results may vary.\n3. Do snails eat beard algae? Nerite snails will graze on softer patches of beard algae, but they are not as effective as some fish species.\n4. Will Amano shrimp eat beard algae? Amano shrimp typically prefer other algae types and are not highly effective at controlling BBA.\n5. How often should I change the water in my aquarium to prevent beard algae? Perform regular water changes of 25-50% weekly to maintain water quality and prevent algae growth.\n6. Can too much light cause beard algae? Yes, excessive light intensity and duration can promote beard algae growth.\n7. What CO2 level is ideal for planted tanks to prevent beard algae? Maintain a CO2 level of around 30 ppm for optimal plant growth and algae control.\n8. Is hydrogen peroxide safe for use in aquariums? Hydrogen peroxide can be used sparingly as a spot treatment, but high concentrations can harm fish and invertebrates.\n9. Can I use bleach to kill beard algae? Bleach can be used to disinfect aquarium decorations outside of the tank, but it should never be used directly in the aquarium as it is highly toxic to aquatic life.\n10. How long does it take to get rid of beard algae? Eradicating beard algae can take several weeks or even months, depending on the severity of the infestation and the effectiveness of the treatment methods. Consistency is key.\n11. Are there any plants that are particularly susceptible to beard algae? Slow-growing plants with broad leaves are more prone to beard algae infestations.\n12. How can I improve water circulation in my aquarium? Use a powerhead or wave maker to increase water flow and prevent nutrient stagnation.\n13. What should I do if I have a severe beard algae outbreak? In severe cases, consider removing all affected plants and decorations, sterilizing the tank, and starting over with new plants.\n14. Can fertilizers cause beard algae? Overdosing fertilizers, especially those high in phosphates, can contribute to algae growth. Use fertilizers sparingly and monitor nutrient levels.\n15. Where can I learn more about aquarium ecology and algae control? You can find valuable information on environmental issues, including water quality and ecosystems, at websites such as The Environmental Literacy Council at enviroliteracy.org .",

    "text": "Rachana Pradhan, Hannah Recht | KFF Health News (TNS)\nNurse midwife Beverly Maldonado recalls a pregnant woman arriving at Ascension Saint Agnes Hospital in Maryland after her water broke. It was weeks before the baby would have any chance of survival, and the patient’s wishes were clear, she recalled: “Why am I staying pregnant then? What’s the point?” the patient pleaded.\nBut the doctors couldn’t intervene, she said. The fetus still had a heartbeat and it was a Catholic hospital, subject to the “ Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services” that prohibit or limit procedures like abortion that the church deems “immoral” or “intrinsically evil,” according to its interpretation of the Bible.\n“I remember asking the doctors. And they were like, ‘Well, the baby still has a heartbeat. We can’t do anything,’” said Maldonado, now working as a nurse midwife in California, who asked them: “What do you mean we can’t do anything? This baby’s not going to survive.”\nThe woman was hospitalized for days before going into labor, Maldonado said, and the baby died.\nAscension declined to comment for this article.\nThe Catholic Church’s directives are often at odds with accepted medical standards, especially in areas of reproductive health, according to physicians and other medical practitioners.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ clinical guidelines for managing pre-labor rupture of membranes, in which a patient’s water breaks before labor begins, state that women should be offered options, including ending the pregnancy.\nMaldonado felt her patient made her wishes clear.\n“Under the ideal medical practice, that patient should be helped to obtain an appropriate method of terminating the pregnancy,” said Christian Pettker, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the Yale School of Medicine, who helped author the guidelines.\nHe said, “It would be perfectly medically appropriate to do a termination of pregnancy before the cessation of cardiac activity, to avoid the health risks to the pregnant person.”\n“Patients are being turned away from necessary care,” said Jennifer Chin, an OB-GYN at UW Medicine in Seattle, because of the “emphasis on these ethical and religious directives.”\nJennifer Chin, an OB-GYN at UW Medicine, says it’s not realistic that the onus be put on patients to avoid Catholic hospitals’ care restrictions. Their health insurance may not include other hospitals, “or that’s where the ambulance is taking them and they don’t really have a say.” (Dan DeLong/KFF Health News/TNS) They can be a powerful constraint on the care that patients receive at Catholic hospitals, whether emergency treatment when a woman’s health is at risk, or access to birth control and abortions.\nMore and more women are running into barriers to obtaining care as Catholic health systems have aggressively acquired secular hospitals in much of the country. Four of the 10 largest U.S. hospital chains by number of beds are Catholic, according to federal data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. There are just over 600 Catholic general hospitals nationally and roughly 100 more managed by Catholic chains that place some religious limits on care, a KFF Health News investigation reveals.\nMaldonado’s experience in Maryland came just months before the Supreme Court’s ruling in 2022 to overturn Roe v. Wade , a decision that compounded the impact of Catholic health care restrictions. In its wake, roughly a third of states have banned or severely limited access to abortion, creating a one-two punch for women seeking to prevent pregnancy or to end one. Ironically, some states where Catholic hospitals dominate — such as Washington, Oregon, and Colorado — are now considered medical havens for women in nearby states that have banned abortion.\nKFF Health News analyzed state-level birth data to discover that more than half a million babies are born each year in the U.S. in Catholic-run hospitals, including those owned by CommonSpirit Health, Ascension, Trinity Health, and Providence St. Joseph Health. That’s 16% of all hospital births each year, with rates in 10 states exceeding 30%. In Washington, half of all babies are born at such hospitals, the highest share in the country.\n“We had many instances where people would have to get in their car to drive to us while they were bleeding, or patients who had had their water bags broken for up to five days or even up to a week,” said Chin, who has treated patients turned away by Catholic hospitals.\nPhysicians who turned away patients like that “were going against evidence-based care and going against what they had been taught in medical school and residency,” she said, “but felt that they had to provide a certain type of care — or lack of care — just because of the strength of the ethical and religious directives.”\nFollowing religious mandates can be dangerous, Chin and other clinicians said.\nWhen a patient has chosen to end a pregnancy after the amniotic sac — or water — has broken, Pettker said, “any delay that might be added to a procedure that is inevitably going to happen places that person at risk of serious, life-threatening complications,” including sepsis and organ infection.\nRelated Articles Health care workers push for their own confidential mental health treatment Post-pandemic vaccine hesitancy fueling latest measles outbreak Measles Q&A: Do I need a booster? And other answers Horse sedative use among humans spreads in deadly mixture of ‘tranq’ and fentanyl Study: About a third of children hospitalized with COVID-19 experience persistent symptoms Reporters analyzed American Hospital Association data as of August and used Catholic Health Association directories, news reports, government documents, and hospital websites and other materials to determine which hospitals are Catholic or part of Catholic systems, and gathered birth data from state health departments and hospital associations. They interviewed patients, medical providers, academic experts, advocacy organizations, and attorneys, and reviewed hundreds of pages of court and government records and guidance from Catholic health institutions and authorities to understand how the directives affect patient care.\nNationally, nearly 800,000 people have only Catholic or Catholic-affiliated birth hospitals within an hour’s drive, according to KFF Health News’ analysis. For example, that’s true of 1 in 10 North Dakotans. In South Dakota, it’s 1 in 20. When care is more than an hour away, academic researchers often define the area as a hospital desert . Pregnant women who must drive farther to a delivery facility are at higher risk of harm to themselves or their fetus, research shows .\nMany Americans don’t have a choice — non-Catholic hospitals are too far to reach in an emergency or aren’t in their insurance networks. Ambulances may take patients to a Catholic facility without giving them a say. Women often don’t know that hospitals are affiliated with the Catholic Church or that they restrict reproductive care, academic research suggests .\nAnd, in most of the country, state laws shield at least some hospitals from lawsuits for not performing procedures they object to on religious grounds, leaving little recourse for patients who were harmed because care was withheld. Thirty-five states prevent patients from suing hospitals for not providing abortions, including 25 states where abortion remains broadly legal. About half of those laws don’t include exceptions for emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, or miscarriages. Sixteen states prohibit lawsuits against hospitals for refusing to perform sterilization procedures.\n“It’s hard for the ordinary citizen to understand, ‘Well, what difference does it make if my hospital is bought by this other big health system, as long as it stays open? That’s all I care about,’” said Erin Fuse Brown, who is the director of the Center for Law, Health & Society at Georgia State University and an expert in health care consolidation. Catholic directives also ban medical aid in dying for terminally ill patients.\nPeople “may not realize that they’re losing access to important services, like reproductive health [and] end-of-life care,” she said.\n‘Our Faith-Based Health Care Ministry’ After the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to abortion in June 2022, Michigan resident Kalaina Sullivan wanted surgery to permanently prevent pregnancy.\nMichigan voters in November that year enshrined the right to abortion under the state constitution, but the state’s concentration of Catholic hospitals means people like Sullivan sometimes still struggle to obtain reproductive health care.\nBecause her doctor worked for the Catholic chain Trinity Health, the nation’s fourth-largest hospital system, she had the surgery with a different doctor at North Ottawa Community Health System, an independent hospital near the shores of Lake Michigan.\nLess than two months later, that, too, became a Catholic hospital, newly acquired by Trinity.\nTo mark the transition, Cory Mitchell, who at the time was the mission leader of Trinity Health Muskegon, stood before his new colleagues and offered a blessing.\n“The work of your hands is what makes our faith-based health care ministry possible,” he said, according to a video of the ceremony Trinity Health provided to KFF Health News. “May these hands continue to bring compassion, compassion and healing, to all those they touch.”\nTrinity Health declined to answer detailed questions about its merger with North Ottawa Community Health System and the ethical and religious directives. “Our commitment to high-quality, compassionate care means informing our patients of all appropriate care options, and trusting and supporting our physicians to make difficult and medically necessary decisions in the best interest of their patients’ health and safety,” spokesperson Jennifer Amundson said in an emailed statement. “High-quality, safe care is critical for the women in our communities and in cases where a non-critical service is not available at our facility, the physician will transfer care as appropriate.”\nLeaders in Catholic-based health systems have hammered home the importance of the church’s directives, which are issued by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, all men, and were first drafted in 1948. The essential view on abortion is as it was in 1948. The last revision, in 2018, added several directives addressing Catholic health institution acquisitions or mergers with non-Catholic ones, including that “whatever comes under control of the Catholic institution — whether by acquisition, governance, or management — must be operated in full accord with the moral teaching of the Catholic Church.”\n“While many of the faithful in the local church may not be aware of these requirements for Catholic health care, the local bishop certainly is,” wrote Sister Doris Gottemoeller, a former board member of the Bon Secours Mercy Health system, in a 2023 Catholic Health Association journal article . “In fact, the bishop should be briefed on a regular basis about the hospital’s activities and strategies.”\nNow, for care at a non-Catholic hospital, Sullivan would need to travel nearly 30 miles.\n“I don’t see why there’s any reason for me to have to follow the rules of their religion and have that be a part of what’s going on with my body,” she said.\nRisks Come With Religion Nathaniel Hibner, senior director of ethics at the Catholic Health Association, said the ethical and religious directives allow clinicians to provide medically necessary treatments in emergencies. In a pregnancy crisis when a person’s life is at risk, “I do not believe that the ERDs should restrict the physician in acting in the way that they see medically indicated.”\n“Catholic health care is committed to the health of all women and mothers who enter into our facilities,” Hibner said.\nThe directives permit care to cure “a proportionately serious pathological condition of a pregnant woman” even if it would “result in the death of the unborn child.” Hibner demurred when asked who defines what that means and when such care is provided, saying, “for the most part, the physician and the patients are the ones that are having a conversation and dialogue with what is supposed to be medically appropriate.”\nIt is common for practitioners at any hospital to consult an ethics board about difficult cases — such as whether a teenager with cancer can decline treatment. At Catholic hospitals, providers must ask a board for permission to perform procedures restricted by the religious directives, clinicians and researchers say. For example, could an abortion be performed if a pregnancy threatened the mother’s life?\nHow and when an ethics consultation occurs depends on the hospital, Hibner said. “That ethics consultation can be initiated by anyone involved in the direct care of that situation — the patient, the surrogate of that patient, the physician, the nurse, the social worker all have the ability to request a consultation,” he said. When asked whether a consultation with an ethics board can occur without a request, he said “sometimes it could.”\nHow strictly directives are followed can depend on the hospital and the views of the local bishop.\n“If the hospital has made a difficult decision about a critical pregnancy or an end-of-life care situation, the bishop should be the first to know about it,” Gottemoeller wrote.\nIn an interview, Gottemoeller said that even when pregnancy termination decisions are made on sound ethical grounds, not informing the bishop puts him in a bad position and hurts the church. “If there’s a possibility of it being misunderstood, or misinterpreted, or criticized,” Gottemoeller said, the bishop should understand what happened and why “before the newspapers call him and ask him for an opinion.”\n“And if he has to say, ‘Well, I think you made a mistake,’ well, all right,” she said. “But don’t let him be blindsided. I mean, we’re one church and the bishop has pastoral concern over everything in his diocese.”\nKatherine Parker Bryden, a nurse midwife in Iowa who works for MercyOne, said she regularly tells pregnant patients that the hospital cannot perform tubal sterilization surgery, to prevent future pregnancies, or refer patients to other hospitals that do. MercyOne is one of the largest health systems in Iowa. Nearly half of general hospitals in the state are Catholic or Catholic-affiliated — the highest share among all states.\nThe National Catholic Bioethics Center, an ethics authority for Catholic health institutions, has said that referrals for care that go against church teaching would be “immoral.”\n“As providers, you’re put in this kind of moral dilemma,” Parker Bryden said. “Am I serving my patients or am I serving the archbishop and the pope?”\nIn response to questions, MercyOne spokesperson Eve Lederhouse said in an email that its providers “offer care and services that are consistent with the guidelines of a Catholic health system.”\nMaria Rodriguez, an OB-GYN professor at Oregon Health & Science University, said that as a resident in the early 2000s at a Catholic hospital she was able to secure permission — what she calls a “pope note” — to sterilize some patients with conditions such as gestational diabetes.\nAnnie Iriye, a retired OB-GYN in Washington state, said that more than a decade ago she sought permission to administer medication to hasten labor for a patient experiencing a second-trimester miscarriage at a Catholic hospital. She said she was told no because the fetus had a heartbeat. The patient took 10 hours to deliver — time that would have been cut by half, Iriye said, had she been able to follow her own medical training and expertise. During that time, she said, the patient developed an infection.\nIriye and Chin were part of an effort by reproductive rights groups and medical organizations that pushed for a state law to protect physicians if they act against Catholic hospital restrictions. The bill, which Washington enacted in 2021 , was opposed by the Washington State Hospital Association, whose membership includes multiple large Catholic health systems.\nState lawmakers in Oregon in 2021 enacted legislation that beefed up powers to reject health care mergers if they would reduce access to the types of care constrained by Catholic directives. The hospital lobby has sued to block the statute . Washington state lawmakers introduced similar legislation last year, which the hospital association opposes.\nHibner said Catholic hospitals are committed to instituting systemic changes that improve maternal and child health, including access to primary, prenatal, and postpartum care. “Those are the things that I think rural communities really need support and advocacy for,” he said.\nMaldonado, the nurse midwife, still thinks of her patient who was forced to stay pregnant with a baby who could not survive. “To feel like she was going to have to fight to have an abortion of a baby that she wanted?” Maldonado said. “It was just horrible.”\nKFF Health News data editor Holly K.

    "text": "Стоимость десятка куриных яиц в мае опустилась ниже 100 рублей. Такая низкая цена на этот товар наблюдается в РФ впервые с октября 2023 года, следует из данных Росстата, пишет РИА Новости.\nСогласно информации ведомства, в апреле десяток яиц в РФ стоил 102,8 рублей. При этом в мае их цена упала до 96,5 рубля. Аналитики отметили, что такой маленькой цены на яйца не было с октября 2023 года, когда они в среднем стоили по стране 97,1 рубля.\nСамые дешевые яйца можно найти в Мордовии — по 69 рублей за десяток. В Крыму яйца продают по 70 рублей, а в Пензенской области — по 72 рубля.\nЯйца являются одним из ключевых продуктов в потребительской корзине россиян. По данным Росстата, в среднем жители РФ съедают 237 штук в год.\nДо этого заведующий лабораторией анализа институтов и финансовых рынков ИПЭИ Президентской академии Александр Абрамов сообщил, что в России в начале июня подешевело сливочное масло. Его стоимость в магазинах упала на 16,7%.\nКроме того, Абрамов отметил, что на 6,7% подешевели бананы, а также на 3,3% снизилась цена на апельсиновый сок.\nРанее сообщалось, что в России подорожало молоко.",

    "text": "Serviranno le misure di contenimento messo in atto dai dai sindaci di Roccaraso e di altri Comuni limitrofi, a fermare l'enorme flusso turistico da Napoli e dalla Campania? La risposta è probabilmente no perché i tik-toker che lo hanno causato continuano a pubblicare video invitando i propri followers ad aderire al pacchetto-vacanza di un giorno sulle piste di sci abruzzesi.\nLa \"vacanza\" mordi e fuggi low cost\nIl pacchetto per visitare Roccaraso e zone limitrofe, davvero a buon prezzo, costa in media 30 euro a persona. SI parte da Napoli intorno alle 6,30 e si ritorna nel pomeriggio. (non è però inclusa la pulizia dopo il disastro lasciato sulle piste dall'orda di visitatori). La seconda ondata sarebbe già pronta e a dare notizia di questo nuovo assalto è stato il deputato Francesco Emilio Borrelli di Alleanza Verdi Sinistra, che sarà presente domenica prossima a Roccaraso e ha fatto sapere che nonostante le riserve, sono in tanti i tik-toker napoletani che pubblicano inviti a recarsi sul posto al \"grido\" di: \"Tutti a Roccaraso, dobbiamo invaderla\".\nGià 20mila prenotazioni\nAl momento sarebbero già 20mila le prenotazioni e continuano ad aumentare: \"Le polemiche dei giorni scorsi e i provvedimenti che saranno adottati dai sindaci di Roccaraso, Castel di Sangro, Pescocostanzo, Rivisondoli e Rocca Pia, con l'avallo dell'Anas, per fissare il tetto dei cento bus, e della Prefettura dell'Aquila sembrano non avere alcun effetto sulla febbre delle gite sulla neve che, anzi, rischia di diventare una vera epidemia portando scompiglio, caos, congestione e degrado nelle località sciistiche abruzzesi\", spiega Borrelli aggiungendo:\n\"È chiaro che questi soggetti che pubblicizzano questi viaggi - afferma il parlamentare - stanno sfidando le Istituzioni annunciando un'invasione selvaggia senza regole. Una sfida a cui bisogna farsi trovare preparati e respingerla. Trattandosi per lo più di organizzatori improvvisati è chiaro, come accaduto lo scorso fine settimana, che sarà il caos totale e un secondo atto non lo si può permettere.\nDomenica sarò personalmente presente a Roccaraso per verificare che ci siano i dovuti controlli contro l'annunciata nuova invasione e fermare qualsiasi devastazione e verificare che siano state adottate tutte le misure per garantire sicurezza e legalità\".- dal lunedì al venerdì dalle ore 10:00 alle ore 20:00\n- sabato, domenica e festivi dalle ore 10:00 alle ore 18:00.",

A red alert has been issued for dense fog in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the fog conditions at the Indira Gandhi International Airport registered an improvement on Friday, compared to the last two days. The lowest visibility on Friday morning is at 150m and the Runway Visual Range (RVR) is in at range of 400m to 800m, reported ANI.\nOver the last three days, nearly 60 flights were diverted and scores were delayed due to the fog. Airport sources said a total of 58 flights, the majority of them operated by domestic carriers, were diverted due to bad weather between 0000 hours of December 25 to 0600 hours of December 28.\nThe situation was no different at the New Delhi Railway Station where 22 trains were delayed on Friday. \"The trains are later than usual this time. The Nandankanan Express coming to Delhi from Bhubaneswar was supposed to reach at 3.30 pm but it reached Delhi at 12.30 am,\" a passenger Prashant Kumar told ANI.\nThe situation is likely to continue over the next few days, the IMD said. \"Very dense fog in isolated pockets of Jammu-Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana-Chandigarh, U.P, west Rajasthan; moderate to dense fog in isolated pockets of Delhi, East Raj; Shallow to moderate fog in isolated pockets of West M.P, Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar,\" a post by the IMD read.\nThe minimum temperature is expected to hover around seven to eight degrees Celsius, the weather department said on Thursday.\n\"Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 8.4 degrees Celsius, one notch above the season's average, while the maximum temperature settled at 21.4 degrees Celsius, one notch above normal,\" according to the IMD.\nIn an advisory for dense fog, the department has asked drivers to use fog lights and travellers to stay updated on the schedules of airlines, railways and state transport. \"Exercise caution while driving or using any mode of transportation,\" the IMD said.\nThe Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data stated that Delhi's 24-hour average AQI on Thursday settled at 358.",

    "text": "article The Brief NOAA detected two solar flares this week, including an X9.0 flare, the strongest flare in seven years. The flares are expected to cause geomagnetic storms, potentially making the Northern Lights visible as far south as Iowa. The second flare may lead to even stronger storms early next week, increasing aurora visibility. (FOX 9) - Two major solar flares in recent days are setting the stage for visible Northern Lights into next week.\nWhat we know This week, NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center detected two solar flares that sparked two Earth-directed coronal mass ejections. The second of the two, detected on Thursday, is rated as an X9.0 flare – the strongest detected solar flare in about seven years.\nBoth events are expected to spark geomagnetic storms in Earth&apos;s atmosphere which fuel the aurora.\nWhat to expect The NOAA is forecasting G3 (or strong) geomagnetic storms on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. That means the Northern Lights could be visible as far south as central Iowa over the weekend.\nThis storm is the result of the first solar flare. It&apos;s unclear exactly how the second flare will impact Earth.\nIt will take a few days for the second coronal mass ejection to reach Earth. If things go as expected, the second flare could create an even stronger storm early next week – which in turn could mean even more vibrant Northern Lights.\nHelping out aurora seekers, the skies are clear on Thursday night, and we are just past the new moon phase – meaning viewing conditions will be favorable.\nTips for viewing the Northern Lights The NOAA recommends the following tips for the best chance to see the Northern Lights.\nGo north. Go to areas with less light pollution. You can use this map to find the best spots near you. Often, the best times to see the aurora are closer to midnight. The spring and fall are often the best times to see the aurora, because \"the subtleties in the way the solar wind interacts with Earth’s magnetosphere\" can create larger geomagnetic storms.

    "text": "Christians arrested in Mauritania for holding baptism ceremony that outraged Muslims released Officials in Mauritania have released all Christians arrested after a video of a baptism ceremony in November prompted Muslims to call for their punishment, Christian leaders in the region said. The Christians do not appear to have been charged with any crime, the Christian leaders indicated. “They have been asked to go home and believe what they want, but in private and discreetly,” a Christian leader in the region told Christian Daily International. “It seems that our brothers have more to fear from the Islamists than from their government. Thank God for this happy ending.” At least 15 and possibly as many as 18 [Christians were arrested](https://www.christiandaily.com/africa/mauritania-arrests-christians-in-response-to-muslims-outrage.html) along with their families, and the regional leader said that by Dec. 18 they had all been released. There is no law against evangelism in the northwest African country, though officials ban any public expression of faith except Islam. At least three of the Christians were initially arrested on or shortly before Nov. 30 in Selibaby, more than 600 kilometers (373 miles) south of the capital city of Nouakchott, according to Spanish news service [EFE](https://www.swissinfo.ch/spa/mauritania-religi%C3%B3n_arrestan-a-tres-personas-en-mauritania-por-convertirse-al-cristianismo/49021508). The arrests stemmed from protests calling for Christians to be killed after a video of a baptism ceremony appeared in social media, according to Christian leaders in the region. Only foreigners are allowed to hold non-Muslim religious services in Mauritania, and it is illegal for citizens to attend, according to the U.S. State Department’s latest International Religious Freedom Report (2022). While Mauritanians are thus prohibited from holding church services, the government does not usually prevent non-Islamic groups from holding religious gatherings in private spaces, according to the report. Though there is no law against evangelism in Mauritania, officials nevertheless forbid non-Muslims from “proselytizing,” according to the State Department report. Apostasy, or leaving Islam, is punishable by death in Mauritania, where the population is 98% Sunni Muslim, 1% Shiite Muslim and the constitution designates Islam as the sole religion of the citizenry and state. The estimated 11,000 Christians in the country of 4.9 million people make up 0.2% of the population, according to Open Doors. Mauritania’s laws and legal procedures derive from a mix of French civil law and sharia (Islamic law), but there have been calls from the public for increased application of the country’s sharia-based criminal code, according to the State Department’s 2022 religious freedom report. “The law prohibits apostasy and blasphemy,” the report states. “The criminal code mandates a death sentence for any Muslim convicted of apostasy or blasphemy, but the government has never applied capital punishment for apostasy or blasphemy.” Faith-based Non-Governmental Organizations must refrain from proselytizing or otherwise promoting any religion other than Islam. While the government typically allows private non-Islamic worship, technically the government must pre-approve all group meetings, “including non-Islamic religious gatherings and those held in private homes,” according to the report. Possession of non-Islamic religious materials remained legal, although the government continued to prohibit their printing and distribution, it adds. Although Mauritania is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which provides everyone the “freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief” of their choice, the government continued to ban any public expression of religion except that of Islam, according to the religious freedom report. “Authorized churches were able to conduct services within their premises but could not proselytize,” the report states. “An unofficial government requirement restricted non-Islamic worship to the few recognized Christian churches.” Mauritania ranked 20th on Open Doors 2023 World Watch List of the countries where it is most difficult to be a Christian.

    "text": "The signs of life shown by the initial public offering (IPO) market in the U.S., especially in the second half of the year, are giving analysts hope that more companies will be enticed to go public in 2024. Overall, 108 initial public offerings raised proceeds of about $19.4 billion in 2023, according to Renaissance Capital. That’s up from a dismal 71 IPOs for proceeds of $7.7 billion in 2022, when high inflation and rising interest rates discouraged companies from hitting the market. This year’s big IPOs included health-care products company Kenvue in May, U.K. chip designer Arm Holdings in September and footwear company Birkenstock in October. They accounted for over half of the total IPO proceeds, according to Renaissance Capital. Instacart also had a splashy IPO in late summer. A post-pandemic surge for IPOs was stifled by the highest inflation in four decades in 2022, raising concerns about the economy buckling under the pressure. The Federal Reserve then embarked on a historic round of rate hikes to tame inflation, which made borrowing more expensive and increased caution in the IPO market. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the monthly personal consumption and expenditures report, has cooled to a pace of 2.6% from a high of 7.1% in the middle of 2022. Other measures of inflation, such as the consumer price index, reached a peak of 9.1% in 2022. The central bank fought inflation by raising its benchmark rate from near zero to a range of 5.25% to 5.50%. The Fed has held that range steady for several months and has signaled that it could start cutting rates in 2024. Wall Street is betting that could happen early in the year. Cooling inflation and falling interest rates could push the IPO market back toward a more normal level of activity, which averaged about 170 IPOs with average proceeds of about $43 billion from 2017 to 2019. “While the IPO market’s recovery is still somewhat tenuous, all signs point to a solid pickup in 2024,” said Renaissance Capital in its recent IPO review for 2023. The IPO market is expected to grow along with an economy. Corporate profits are expected to rise after shaking off an earnings recession. Earnings gains of just under 2% during the fourth quarter of 2023 could be followed by a gain of more than 8% in the first quarter of 2024 and 10% during the second quarter of 2024 for companies in the S&P 500, analysts forecast. The S&P 500 index is on track to close the year with a gain of more than 20%. Wall Street is increasingly expecting the Fed to achieve its so-called soft landing goal by trimming inflation to the central bank’s 2% target without an ensuing recession. IPO activity could speed up as CEOs gain more confidence that the “soft landing” will happen, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis.",
