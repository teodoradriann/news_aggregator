    "text": "For the first time since 2022, the Summit High School boys lacrosse team has won a game.\nIn the Tigers’ first game under head coach Drew Goldsmith, Summit took on Glenwood Springs High School in Breckenridge on Tuesday, March 18.\nDespite snow blanketing the field periodically, the Tigers played spectacularly and matched up well against their 4A Western league opponent.\nSenior captain Zander Reid led the team with three goals and an assist, while senior Graham Schuman recorded two goals off of three shots on net. Summit’s final goal of the game was awarded to sophomore Dublin Nelson.\nSummit defeated Glenwood Springs, 6-3, for the Tigers’ first win in three years.\n“If you put your mind to it, you can do it,” Goldsmith said. “Having the mental confidence and trying to snuff the mental doubts we all have in our minds is an incredibly powerful force. Those guys worked hard.”\nThe win would not have been possible without the effort from senior Sean Mullaly in net for the Tigers. Mullaly saved 21 shots en route to his first win of the season.\nSummit will now prepare to take on Vail Mountain School on the road on Saturday, March 22. The Tigers will then face Steamboat Springs in Steamboat on Thursday, March 27, before returning to Breckenridge to take on Battle Mountain High School on Thursday, April 3.\n“I am not certain what is in store for us, but we are ready to face the challenge,” Goldsmith said.",

    "text": "Según dio a conocer Vanguardia, María Belén Suárez Meza, una residente del barrio El Llano en Sardinata, Norte de Santander, fue trágicamente asesinada por su expareja, Jhon Mauricio Maldonado Serrano, el martes 6 de agosto en un acto de violencia que ha conmocionado a la comunidad. Este feminicidio, el primero registrado en el departamento este año, ocurrió alrededor de las 10:00 de la mañana y ha dejado una profunda huella en quienes conocían a la víctima.(Vea también: “Para el estrén” Tiendas D1 lanzará línea de ropa: anuncio emocionó a los usuarios)Las autoridades están investigando dos posibles escenarios que llevaron al crimen. Una versión sugiere que la tragedia se desencadenó tras una discusión en la vivienda donde ambos se encontraban. Según esta teoría, Maldonado habría reaccionado violentamente después de que Suárez Meza rechazara una propuesta de matrimonio. Otra versión apunta a que el ataque ocurrió en el lugar de trabajo de la víctima, donde Maldonado la habría confrontado antes de dispararle.Después de cometer el asesinato, Maldonado intentó escapar en un vehículo, pero su fuga fue frustrada cuando chocó contra un camión. Tras conocerse lo sucedido, la familia de la víctima se desplazó hasta el hospital donde fue trasladado con el fin de alzar la voz y exigirle a las autoridades justicia.",

    "text": "Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP\nInside an unassuming hall in Jimboomba, north-west of Queensland’s Gold Coast, Sarah Weir is offering a reprieve from the heat, cool drinks and food, wifi, and even her shoulder to cry on.\n“There’s been some tears,” she says.\n“But at the same time, I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else during a disaster.”\nThe town is one of several in south-east Queensland that was battered by storms and flash flooding over Christmas and Boxing Day. Seven people died, hundreds of homes were damaged and power outages affected thousands more. Now, residents are sweltering through a heatwave, many without the comfort of fans or air conditioning due to the lack of electricity.\nAccording to the Bureau of Meteorology, more storms are forecast to hit the region on Saturday, with the possibility of destructive winds, large hail and heavy rain which may lead to flash flooding from the late morning.\nAs of Friday afternoon, 27,400 properties across the south-east were yet to have their power restored, including almost 2,000 in Jimboomba, where temperatures soared to 38C.\nWhen Weir learned the Jimboomba Community and District Hall had power, she asked the local Rotary club if she could transform it into a makeshift shelter for those without. Since then, hundreds have been through its doors.\n“Some people are just popping into grab some food and water and a bit of reprieve from the heat, others are staying most of the day,” she says.\nWeir says the majority of people who have visited the hall have been older residents escaping the heat as well as some families with small children, whose homes have been significantly damaged by the storm.\nOthers have taken advantage of the hall’s wifi to make contact with friends and family abroad during the festive season.\n“People have got family interstate or overseas they haven’t been able to contact to let them know they’re OK,” Weir says.\nQueensland’s minister for disaster recovery, Nikki Boyd, visited Jimboomba on Friday and said it was one of the “hardest hit” by the “ferocious” storms.\n“We’ve got field crews who are working right now across the clock to restore power as soon as possible,” she said.\nBoyd said she was confident 90% of properties in the area would have electricity restored by New Year’s Eve but the remaining 10% of properties – predominantly in Jimboomba and Tamborine Mountain – could have a longer wait.\n“Network restoration there will take some time. Energex aims to have power restored to all customers in these communities … by tomorrow [Saturday] night,” she said.\n‘Shocked at the extent of the damage’ Joshua Kerswill from Energex described the storm as unprecedented for the region.\n“The scale that we’re dealing with here in the south-east to me is probably equivalent to twice what Cyclone Yasi put out,” he said of the 2011 disaster that left 150,000 homes without electricity.\n“It’s widespread, it’s covered a large populated area. Everyone working here is quite shocked at the extent of the damage.”\nLogan city councillor Scott Bannan said he expected the clean-up would take months and urged residents not to overexert themselves in the heat.\n“The clean-up can wait,” he said.\n“Especially the older guys, I’m really worried about them overdoing it with the clean-up when it’s so hot outside and there’s no reprieve inside.”\nHe said the community had worked together to clear fallen trees and other debris from driveways to ensure people were able to leave their properties, and were now working to clear the main roads.\n“The community is terrific. For some people who have just moved into the area, it has come as a bit of a shock but for those of us who have been here for a while – it’s just a matter of getting shit done,” he said.\n“Whether its fires or floods – neighbours here roll up their sleeves, they help each other, share machines. You really do see the best in people.”\nBannon said he had organised a barbecue for Friday afternoon as a thank you to the community. With some help from Weir, temporary washing machines and showers were set up and 500 sausages, 200 steaks and “a little bit of salad” were distributed.\n“I’ve been feeling a bit useless because I broke my leg, I’ve been hopping around on crutches trying to help but not really [been able to] so I organised a barbecue. It’ll be a big feed and an hour off for a bit of a breather,” he said.\nWoodhill rural fire station was also allowing members of the public to use their bathrooms, while Bannan said people with power had opened up their homes for people to shower, store medication and charge phones.\nBoyd urged locals to pay attention to warnings as more wild weather approaches.\n“We’re not too sure exactly what the storms will bring at us,” she said.\n“But one thing I know for sure is we’ve got the best response.”",

    "text": "Chopper pilots have shared the terrifying view from a police helicopter whilst being thrown around the sky by Storm Gerrit.\nThis was the moment a National Police Air Service helicopter was transformed into a \"flying washing machine\" as it hit the tempest over London on Thursday. Airborne officers commanding the aircraft shared the clip with green-faced emojis as the storm swept in, wreaking havoc across the UK.\nWriting on X, formerly known as Twitter , NPAS London pilots said: \"If you think it’s windy down there, spare a thought for us up here in our flying washing machine!\" They added: \"Thankfully, we have recent taken delivery of some extra sick bags. None have been required…… yet!\"\nThe pilots weren't the only ones in the sky to struggle in the strong gusts this week, however. One American Airlines flight faced a very bumpy landing at Heathrow on Wednesday amidst the severe windy conditions from the named storm.\nBigJetTV captured the nailbiting moment the flight from Los Angeles touched down as it was thrown side to side by strong gusts. The airline enthusiast filming the landing can be heard shouting \"oh\" over and over as the aircraft makes its shaky landing, before yelling, \"stop it!\"\nMeanwhile, British Airways planes were captured making similarly treacherous landings at Bristol Airport on Wednesday. The vehement gusts meant one aircraft had to make three attempts to land, while others were filmed being thrown about by the storm above the runway.\nThe Met Office issued several weather warnings earlier this week for strong wind and heavy rain, as well as snow in parts of Scotland and the Shetland Islands. Forecasters named the storm Gerrit as a warning to Brits hitting the road or heading outdoors during the post-Christmas week, with concerns the severe weather would unleash travel chaos and power cuts.",
