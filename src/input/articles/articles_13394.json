    "text": "SINGAPORE – As the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was lashed by a storm that clogged its highways and brought one of the world’s busiest airports to a standstill, some Singaporeans in Dubai found themselves in the thick of the chaos that engulfed the Middle Eastern financial centre.\n“We were just really lucky that we managed to get out of it safely. At one point, the water level was almost up to our windows,” said Singaporean YouTuber Jianhao Tan, who was stuck in a car for eight hours on April 16.\nFootage posted on TikTok by Mr Tan showed luggage trolleys being blown across a hotel lobby, with people frantically running through the entrance to seek shelter. Vehicles can also be seen attempting to navigate the roads, as well as people walking on road dividers to avoid the water.\nThe 31-year-old was in Dubai for what was supposed to be a five-day holiday with his wife Debbie Soon, socialite-entrepreneur Kim Lim and social media influencer Wendy Cheng, also known as Xiaxue.\nMr Tan and the rest of the group had been scheduled to return to Singapore on April 16, while Ms Cheng left on April 15, just managing to avoid the rainfall that began that evening.\n@thejianhaotan We got caught in the worst Dubai storm for the first time in 73 YEARS 😨\n♬ Monkeys Spinning Monkeys - Kevin MacLeod & Kevin The Monkey The record rainfall meant Dubai’s major airport was thrown into chaos, and the city’s giant, six-lane highways clogged by flooding that led to snaking tailbacks.\nMr Tan and his group wanted to leave their hotel at about 3pm to catch their 9pm flight back to Singapore, and after much difficulty, managed to find one vehicle for the entire group.\n“We tried to fit our luggage in the car and ended up squeezing together – we did not expect to squeeze for eight hours,” he said, with a laugh.\nAn hour into the journey, the gravity of the situation began to dawn on the group. Their vehicle was barely moving through the flooded streets, and on social media, Mr Tan said he saw videos of a flooded airport.\nEmbed Instagram Instagram URL\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by KIM LIM (@kimlimhl)\nMs Lim took the decision to instruct their driver to take the group to another hotel.\n“I was worried for everyone, even the people on the road. I felt so helpless because we couldn’t do anything to help,” said Ms Lim, 32.\n“We realised we were not going to make it and judging from the weather, I guessed the flights would be cancelled or delayed.”\nThe call of nature also proved to be an issue for others stranded on the roads – the group’s car eventually passed some bushes at a roadside area that was relatively dry, where people were seen using as a makeshift latrine point.\nEmbed Instagram Instagram URL\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by JIANHAO TAN (@thejianhaotan)\nEventually, after about eight hours in the vehicle, the group arrived at the hotel, where they were greeted by a lobby full of people forced to squat and seek shelter, with all the rooms taken up.\nHowever, the Singaporeans had already secured accommodation for the night, thanks to Ms Lim’s quick thinking, and were able to rest before their flight, which she had postponed to the next day.\nDespite the experience, Mr Tan counted his blessings. “It could have been a lot worse. Looking at what others went through, we were really lucky to be able to sit in the car comfortably.”\nHe added: “People bond through adversity; we made a lot of memories together through this experience, and our friendship is stronger. It’s definitely something we will always remember in years to come.”\nMs Cheng, who kept in touch with the group in Dubai, said she was very worried about them.\n“I will never complain about Singapore’s weather again,” she said. “It’s hot and humid, but it’s stable and safe – not something we should take for granted.”\nMore On This Topic Singapore visitors in Dubai for crypto events face wash-out as floods hit Explainer: What caused the storm that brought Dubai, Oman to a standstill? Elsewhere in Dubai, retiree Ahmad Fuad Abu Bakar, who has lived in the UAE for 39 years, had just been discharged from hospital on the night of April 15.\nMr Fuad, 70, had been warned that the country would be expecting the worst rain in years. He was not afraid that anything serious would happen to his family from the safety of his fourth-floor apartment home.\nShortly after he reached home, rain started to fall – and as it got heavier through the next day, the living room and bedrooms began flooding as water seeped through the door frames.\n“We used lots of towels and even blankets to soak up the water. The heaviest rain came before lunchtime, and we could not control the flood in our living room,” he said.\nDuring the ordeal, Mr Fuad and his family reached out to fellow Singaporeans living in Dubai to check on them, with many responding with videos and photos of their waterlogged homes.\nMr Muhammad, a 42-year-old Singaporean who has lived in the UAE for two decades, said he received a notice and announcements from the local government about the bad weather a day before the rain began falling.\nHowever, Mr Muhammad did not expect the storms to be as ferocious as they were. He stayed at home with his father-in-law, wife and six-year-old son, passing the time by keeping updated on others in the city.\nHis Facebook news feed was full of posts from his colleagues struggling to get to work.\n“They had been stranded in their place of accommodation, where roads and areas were inaccessible due to high levels of flooding. No transportation was coming in and out; the metro train was closed at some stations due to the weather,” he said.\n“Some of them living in high-rise towers had no electricity or power. To top it off, they had to evacuate from more than 30 floors up because of a fire alarm, with smoke coming out from one of the apartments, then had to make their way up again once it cleared. This was the worst weather I have seen having lived in the UAE for 20 years.”\nActs of kindness by Singaporeans also shone through the storm. The Singaporeans In Dubai Facebook group, which Mr Muhammad is an admin of, was buzzing with Singaporeans checking on one another’s well-being and offering help.\n“If any of you are in the area and are still affected by the flood, we will be happy to offer you a shower, dry towels, somewhere to rest, charge up your devices and even throw in a comforting plate of chicken rice,” said group member Evangeline Harvey.\n“A few of my colleagues offered lifts to or from work because there were no taxis, and there were even a few who brought food and water to my offices as the crew had waited for hours as they were stuck there,” said Mr Muhammad.\n“You see the best of people during these trying times.”\nMore On This Topic UAE reels for a third day after record-breaking storm Dubai roads, airport reel from floods after record rains Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.",

    "text": "Ana Cabanillas\nMadrid 08 AGO 2024 22:48 Actualizada 08 AGO 2024 23:17 El presidente de Castilla-La Mancha, Emiliano García-Page , se ha convertido en el primer dirigente del PSOE en pronunciarse sobre Carles Puigdemont, que este jueves ha vuelto a burlar a la Justicia tras darse un baño de masas en Barcelona. El barón socialista ha asegurado sentir \"profunda vergüenza y profundo sonrojo\" por el hecho de que el Gobierno de España \"dependa de alguien como Puigdemont\".\nEl PSOE y el Gobierno se han sumido este jueves en el más escrupuloso silencio tras el regreso del líder de Junts, limitando las consideraciones a la investidura de Illa y obviando la polémica con el líder independentista, que ha vuelto a huir para evitar ser detenido.\nEn su cuenta de la red social X, García-Page ha comenzado felicitando en primer lugar a Salvador Illa por su investidura , y ha celebrado que Cataluña pase a tener a \"alguien que se ocupe de los problemas de los catalanes\", a lo que ha añadido que su responsabilidad es \"defender los intereses de Castilla-La Mancha como región de España\".\n\" Espero que podamos llegar a entendernos \", ha añadido el dirigente castellanomanchego, que en los últimos días se ha mostrado muy crítico con el acuerdo alcanzado por PSC y ERC por el que Cataluña tendrá soberanía fiscal y una agenda tributaria propia. Media docena de barones socialistas han clamado contra la cesión a los independentistas por romper la solidaridad interterritorial, pero hasta el momento sólo García Page se ha referido a Puigdemont después del episodio de este jueves.\nEn un segundo mensaje, el presidente castellanomanchego se ha referido también al ex president, que lleva siete años huido , y después de repudiar que el Gobierno dependa de los siete votos de Junts y calificarlo como \"una profunda vergüenza\", ha enviado un mensaje indirecto al Ejecutivo, que desde el comienzo de la legislatura viene destacando que está apoyado en una \"mayoría progresista\", en la que también incluya al partido posconvegente. \"Espero que ya nadie le incluya cuando se hable de mayoría progresista\", ha reclamado el socialista.\nTEMAS",

    "title": "Marcus Shoberg Told Ex He Loved Her and Implied He Wanted to Reconcile Before Filming ‘Bachelorette’",
    "text": "Marcus Shoberg was in contact with several of his exes right before leaving to film The Bachelorette , a source exclusively tells Life & Style .\n“One of his most recent exes he called a lot of times over the years,” the insider dished. “Right before going on the show, he called her to say, ‘I miss you, I love you, but I don’t know what to do because right now I am applying for The Bachelorette. But I am not sure anymore now that I’m talking to you.’ He implied that they should get back together.”\nThe source said it was “very confusing” for Marcus’ ex because he still applied for the show while seemingly pursuing her. “All of his recent exes also recently got in touch and he was calling them at the exact same time,” the insider added. “All while he was applying for the show.”\nThe Bachelorette's Marcus' Parents: Their Complicated Relationship Marcus, 32, is one of the final two men on season 21 of The Bachelorette . During the September 3 finale, Jenn Tran will choose between him and Devin Strader at the final rose ceremony. While Devin, 28, has already told Jenn, 26, that he loves her, Marcus has been slower to get there. During their fantasy suite date, Jenn told Marcus she was “in love” with him, but he has not said it back yet.\nThe Army veteran’s hesitations came as no surprise to those who know him. “Before he left, he proclaimed, “I don’t date. I’m not the man I want to be,’ and said he is not ready for anything serious ,” one of Marcus’ exes previously exclusively told Life & Style . “He made excuses as to why, such as working on his career, saving money, etc. And then he went right on the show! There’s no way he is there to get married. If he wasn’t ready a week before filming, what would make him ready now?”\nWho Do You Want to See as the Next Golden Bachelor? Another source exclusively revealed that Marcus “is not [on the show] for the right reasons ,” adding, “He is not a good guy and it’s a shame that Jenn had to unknowingly be subjected to him.”\nDeal of the Day These ‘Cloud-Soft’ Sandals Are 53% Off Today View Deal During the finale, Marcus and Devin will meet Jenn’s family, and a preview for the last episode reveals that her loved ones are having reservations about how fast things are moving. In the sneak peek, Marcus tells Jenn, “I’m struggling,” to which she replies, frustrated, “We’re running out of time.”\nWho Wins The Bachelorette 2024? Jenn Tran's Final Pick and More Spoilers Meanwhile, Jenn says she has to “follow [her] heart,” and we see host Jesse Palmer ask her, “Are you sure you want to do this?” While heading to the rose ceremony, she admits, “What I’m about to do today is something that I never thought that I would ever do, but I have to do what’s right for me.”\nThen, the footage cuts to Jenn at the podium, speaking to one of the men whose face we cannot see. “I can’t let you propose to me,” she tells him. She’s then seen placing the rose down as the preview ends.\nJenn previously teased that the ending to her season is something that’s never happened before. Many fans have theorized that she will be the one to propose, rather than letting her final pick be the one to get down on one knee.",

    "text": "Forgot Username or Password Date Full Year Highlights: While we had flat production volumes in 2023 as compared to 2022, our sales of RINs from RNG increased approximately 2.5% to 44.9 million RINs sold in 2023. However, lower prices of both the average realized price of RINs sold and natural gas resulted in lower revenues in 2023. These 2023 price driven reductions to revenues of approximately $30.7 million were offset through our tiered royalty structure reducing royalty expense in 2023 by approximately $9.3 million, which led to our $20.9 million reduction in 2023 operating income. Our average pricing realized on RIN sales during 2023 of $2.71 exceeded the average D3 RIN index price of $2.63 during 2023. Our Montauk Ag Renewables development in Turkey, NC was notified by the NC Utilities Commission that it received approval for our New Renewable Energy Facility designation and Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. In March 2024, we submitted an amendment to our New Renewable Energy Facility application. At our Pico site, we began using our new reception pit and additional digester capacity in 2023 and expect the digestion capacity project to be fully commissioned during the second quarter of 2024. Our dairy host informed us that the third and final feedstock volumes are to be expected in 2025. We now expect our second facility at our Apex site to be commissioned during the fourth quarter of 2024 at which time we will have the capacity to process available feedstock as the landfill host increases its waste intake. Finally, distribution upgrades required by our interconnection partner for our Blue Granite project have delayed our expected commissioning of that facility until 2026. We are excited by our recent announcement with a North American subsidiary of European Energy to capture, clean and liquify biogenic carbon dioxide from our four Texas facilities. We expect to begin capital expenditures later in the second half of 2024 with the goal of delivering 140 thousand tons per year in 2027. We also recently reached two separate five year extensions at two of our facilities located on Waste Management landfills. These extensions were reached in connection with our sale of the gas rights agreement at our Security Renewable Electricity facility for $1.0 million effective October 2024. These proceeds are in excess of the sites carrying value and the sale comes as the power purchase agreement at the Security site was set to expire in late 2024. Full Year Financial Results Total revenues in 2023 were $174.9 million, a decrease of $30.7 million (14.9%) compared to $205.6 million in 2022. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in realized RIN prices of 16.6% to $2.71 in 2023 compared to $3.25 in 2022. Additionally, natural gas index pricing decreased 58.7% during 2023 compared to 2022. Operating and maintenance expenses for our RNG facilities were $47.9 million, an increase of $4.2 million (9.5%) compared to $43.7 million in 2022. Our total RNG facilities reported reduced utility expenses of approximately $2.1 million in 2023 as compared to 2022. Other RNG operating and maintenance expenses increased approximately $6.3 million in 2023 compared to 2022 as a result of facility preventative maintenance, repairs, wellfield operational enhancements, and non capitalizable costs. Our Renewable Electricity Generation operating and maintenance expenses in 2023 were $11.7 million, a decrease of $1.3 million (10.2%) compared to $13.1 million in 2022, primarily due to timing of scheduled preventative maintenance intervals at our Bowerman facility. Total general and administrative expenses were $34.4 million in 2023, an increase of $0.3 million (0.8%) compared to $34.1 million in 2022. The increase was primarily related to employee related costs, including stock based compensation. Operating income in 2023 was $23.6 million, a decrease of $20.9 million (47.0%) compared to $44.5 million in 2022. Net income in 2023 was $14.9 million, a decrease of $20.3 million (57.5%) compared to $35.2 million in 2022. Full Year Operational Results We produced approximately 5.5 million Metric Million British Thermal Units (“MMBtu”) of RNG in 2023, flat compared to 5.5 million MMBtu produced in 2022. We produced approximately 194 thousand megawatt hours (“MWh”) in Renewable Electricity in 2023, an increase of 4 thousand MWh compared to 190 thousand MWh produced in 2022. Our Security facility produced approximately 5 thousand MWh more in 2023 compared to 2022 as a result of prior period engine maintenance. 2024 Full Year Outlook Conference Call Information The Company will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss results.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release and the accompanying tables include references to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are Non-GAAP financial measures. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe the measures assist investors in analyzing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measurements of performance that management and the board of directors use in their financial and operational decision-making and in the determination of certain compensation programs. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental performance measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net (loss) income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity or profitability.
