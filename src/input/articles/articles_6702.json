    "text": "Danielle Vasinova \"died for three minutes\" when she had COVID-19.\nThe 42-year-old actress - who has just been cast in the 'Yellowstone' spin-off 'The Madison' - revealed that she thought she was just coming \"down with the flu\" when she contracted the viral infection more than two months before the pandemic was declared and upon going to seek medical advice, her heart stopped for a matter of minutes.\nShe told People: \"On Dec. 12, 2019, I died for three minutes.\n\"I thought I was coming down with the flu. But in the early days of the virus, it was often misdiagnosed.\n\"I went to urgent care in downtown L.A., and they decided it was strep and sent me home with some antibiotics. But by the next day, I could barely walk. My legs wouldn't move. It was bizarre.\n\"I felt like I was going to die.\"\nThe '1923' star suffered \"complete organ failure\" amid the ordeal and noted that while she is normally healthy, the infection just took hold of her body out of nowhere.\nShe said: \"I had complete organ failure. I went from young and healthy to this infection that completely took over my body all of a sudden. It just came on, and it just rocked my world.\"\nDanielle noted that while she didn't see any \"light or the tunnel\" when she died, she saw an array of angel numbers and now considers the whole thing to be a \"rebirth\" of sorts.\nShe said: \"I didn't see the light or a tunnel but they say it can come back to you in flashbacks.\n\"I did, however, start to see a lot of angel numbers everywhere. I would see sequences like 5555, 7777. It was bizarre, but something was telling me, 'There's something more for you. You weren't meant to go just yet. You're meant to do something else.\n\"It's hard to even describe how I feel, but I'm so much more connected. This felt like the turning point in my life. The death, and the rebirth. I know to take nothing for granted. Life is so precious and it is such a gift. We're here to do some good in the world, to be of service, and to be forever grateful.\"",

    "text": "En el marco del 77° aniversario la Universidad del Bío-Bío, a través de la Dirección de Desarrollo Estudiantil (DDE), reconoció a 28 estudiantes de diferentes carreras de la sede Chillán quienes, mediante su dedicación, esfuerzo, compromiso social y personal, destacan como ejemplos inspiradores en la comunidad universitaria, aspirando a un desarrollo y crecimiento integral. Un claro ejemplo de esa integralidad es la estudiante de Diseño Gráfico Rocío Placencia Agurto, connotada surfista UBB. “Me encantó la actividad, la verdad no sabía de este reconocimiento y lo encuentro muy significativo y muy relevante porque el universitario, el estudiante, no solamente se tiene que destacar por su carrera sino por lo que se entrega socialmente, también deportivamente, artísticamente y eso es muy, muy importante para la Universidad y la sociedad en general”, reflexionó. Entre sus pares Rocío es reconocida como una surfista integral que domina las olas con gracia y destreza. Demuestra un compromiso excepcional con su deporte en competencias y eventos nacionales e internacionales. De liderazgo inspirador y un rendimiento académico sobresaliente, destaca como un modelo a seguir por los amantes del surf dentro y fuera del agua, reflejando su compromiso con la excelencia en todos los aspectos de su vida. En representación de las y los estudiantes compartió un mensaje la presidenta del Centro de Estudiantes de la carrera de Fonoaudiología, Anaís Sandoval Sáez. Personas integrales El rector Dr. Benito Umaña Hermosilla comentó que la Universidad no solo forma a las personas en las áreas disciplinares, sino que pretende impactar de manera integral aportando los espacios y recursos para el desarrollo de talentos y capacidades latentes. “Nuestro aniversario es el momento para reconocer a las y los estudiantes que, durante su proceso de formación, se han destacado en distintas actividades. Queremos agradecer y valorar el trabajo de nuestros estudiantes a lo largo de su desarrollo y formación en la Universidad del Bío-Bío”, señaló. El rector Dr. Umaña también valoró el trabajo desplegado por la DDE que cultiva una interacción fluida con las y los estudiantes, logrando interpretar y dar respuesta a diversas necesidades e inquietudes. “Es importante señalar que las y los estudiantes, con la implementación de los nuevos estatutos universitarios, poseen una condición distinta en el modelo de gobernanza, de manera que también colaboran para convertirnos en una mejor Universidad”, ilustró. Más allá de lo académico En tanto, el vicerrector académico Dr. Sergio Vargas Tejeda, enfatizó que las y los homenajeados dedican su tiempo y talento al desarrollo de competencias como el trabajo en equipo, la responsabilidad social, el liderazgo o en actividades de tipo artística, culturales y deportivas. “Para nosotros es muy relevante reconocer el trabajo que hacen los estudiantes más allá de lo académico, y que también forma parte de nuestro modelo educativo, como aquellas competencias genéricas que tienen que ver con las habilidades blandas que ellos van desarrollando”, describió. Los reconocimientos fueron entregados por el rector Dr. Benito Umaña, la prorrectora Mg. Julia Fawaz y el vicerrector académico Dr. Sergio Vargas Tejeda. El acto consideró la participación del profesor del “Taller de magia aplicada a la pedagogía” Leonardo Zavala Silva, diseñador gráfico UBB e ilusionista. Asimismo, la pareja de estudiantes compuesta por Carolina Muñoz y Matías Barrientos brindaron un baile de cueca, en tanto que el dúo QMA integrado por los estudiantes de Pedagogía en Castellano y Comunicación Juan Figueroa y Mauricio Flores interpretaron una composición original en beatbox, trompe y guitarra. El cierre del acto estuvo a cargo del grupo de danzas tradicionales Trabún integrado por alumnas y alumnos UBB y dirigido por el profesor Camilo Bravo.",

    "text": "Walmart recalls magnetic balls after CPSC warns of choking and injury hazards By Ramishah Maruf, CNN New York (CNN) — Regulators have issued a recall for high-powered magnetic balls after the US Consumer Product Safety Commission [ issued several warnings](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/business/magnetic-ball-recall-warning/index.html) for the toy kits, citing the risk of injury or even death. Walmart recalled the “Relax 5mm Science Kit, Large Hematite Magnets Magnetic Stones Building Blocks,” sold exclusively on the site through Joybuy. Earlier in December, CPSC said these magnets, often marketed for children, are small enough to fit into the CPSC’s [small parts cylinder](https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/Business-Guidance/Small-Parts-for-Toys-and-Childrens-Products) (which simulates the width of a child’s throat), and are also magnetically stronger than permitted. If swallowed, the high-powered magnets can attract to each other or to other metals inside the digestive system, leading to “perforations, twisting and/or blockage of the intestines, infection, blood poisoning and death.” The agency broadly estimated 2,500 emergency room visits over magnet ingestions from 2017-2021 and seven deaths, two of which were outside of the United States. The recall affects about 4,240 units. [The CPSC said](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2024/High-Powered-Magnetic-Balls-Recalled-Due-to-Ingestion-Hazard-Sold-Exclusively-on-Walmart-com-through-Joybuy) customers should take away the balls from children immediately and contact Joybuy for a pre-paid label to return the recalled products for a full refund. The toy kit was sold from February 2022 through April 2023 for between $14 and $15 and is made of small magnetic balls in purple, black, green, blue, orange and red.

    "title": "Report: Shin Bet Warned of Possible Hamas Assault Hours Before October 7 Attack",
    "text": "Approximately three hours prior to the Hamas’ attack in southern Israel on October 7, Shin Bet warned other elements of the police and security establishment that a potential assault emanating from the besieged Gaza Strip could be imminent.\nThe Kan public broadcaster and Channel 12 news reported the internal security service sent a “top secret” notification to the National Security Council, Mossad, and police that Israeli SIM cards Shin Bet had previously circulated within the group’s ranks as part of an operation had been activated “in a number of Hamas battalions.” There was no solid quantification of how many SIM cards were activated in the warning, but as the Times of Israel notes each battalion presumably contains hundreds of fighters.\nThe Shin Bet operation involving the cards was launched to provide an early warning for future Hamas attacks against Israel. The automatically generated alert was sent to situation rooms staffed 24 hours a day, contradicting past police claims about never receiving any warning, per Israeli media.\nThe Nova music festival held just outside the Gaza concentration camp went on as scheduled despite the alert, where concertgoers were subsequently slaughtered by Hamas as well as the IDF, which reportedly implemented a mass Hannibal Directive .\nThe Hannibal Directive is a policy of the Israeli military to kill their own soldiers when taken hostage, so as to prevent them from being used as bargaining chips by various resistance groups. However, on October 7, this order was extended to include Israeli civilians potentially kidnapped by Hamas. The group managed to abduct roughly 250 hostages and bring them back to the Strip.\nIsraeli police and Shin Bet are at odds over who is to blame, some sources told Kan that the internal security service should have raised a stronger alarm while other officials argue police did not pay the warning sufficient attention. Shin Bet’s warning said the activity demonstrated “unusual accumulation and, given additional suspicious signs, could be an indication of Hamas attack activities.”\nThe Times notes, “despite the warning, the security establishment maintained an outlook that Hamas was not capable or interested in carrying out a massive attack on the country.” Adding, “no action was taken” based on the Shin Bet alert. As the Jerusalem Post reported last year, this cavalier attitude was shared by commanders within Israel’s apartheid army who were admonished by their lookouts that suspicious activity was ongoing near the border before the attack.\n“For a serious warning like that, phone calls should have been made instead of relying on a [written] report. For more minor things than that they called us and we deployed forces,” an anonymous senior police official on duty the night the Shin Bet warning arrived told Kan. Another security official balked at that argument, insisting “It is exactly for such situations that this warning system was set up so that there is no need to rely on someone making a call or not, that it should be immediate.”\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office had originally denied that the Israeli leader was aware of the SIM cards’ activation prior to a Channel 14 report. Although Netanyahu’s office has now changed its story, claiming he did not know multiple battalions had engaged these cards, only that he was aware “at the start of the war, … that the terrorists used dozens of Israeli SIMs.” The prime minister, as well as his Likud party, spent decades funding Hamas directly and indirectly , as part of a larger strategy to avoid ever negotiating a two-state solution with the Palestinian Authority.\nNetanyahu may have an international arrest warrant issued against him for war crimes committed in the Gaza genocide. In the meantime, he has opposed the formation of a state inquiry commission – which is apparently the “most independent form of panel capable of probing government conduct” – until the war ends. The ongoing state comptroller probe holds significantly less authority and Netanyahu is constantly expanding the scope of his war from the ethnic cleansing and mass starvation campaign in Gaza, to war against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank , Lebanon and Iran .",

Il Comune mette il Museo in rete Articolo: Arte e bellezze naturali. I portici premio Unesco, la grotta di Premilcuore e le altre meraviglie Articolo: L’Italia candida il paesaggio del Chianti al patrimonio Unesco Padova, 5 luglio 2024 – I Colli Euganei entrano nel patrimonio dell’Unesco tra le riserve mondiali della biodiversità: l’annuncio è stato dato dal presidente della Regione Veneto Luca Zaia, impegnato in Marocco per il Consiglio intergovernativo dell’istituzione che tutela 748 siti in tutto il mondo. “È una grande giornata per i nostri Colli Euganei: oggi hanno conquistato il riconoscimento Unesco – ha esultato il governatore – Sono stati iscritti nella lista dei luoghi esemplari in cui lo sviluppo economico, sociale e culturale è sostenibile e trae giovamento dal rispetto dell'ecosistema e della biodiversità”.\nUna decisione unanime presa dai delegati dei 35 paesi membri del Consiglio intergovernativo dell’Unesco. Il Veneto vanta ora 18 riconoscimenti , un record nazionale: 9 siti di patrimonio materiale (come Venezia, Verona e le Dolomiti), 5 di patrimonio immateriale (tra cui l’arte delle perle di vetro e l’opera lirica), e 4 riserve di biodiversità (Po Grande, Delta del Po, Monte Grappa e ora i Colli Euganei).\nZaia ha illustrato gli attributi unici che hanno permesso alle colline nel Padovano di ricevere l’importante riconoscimento. “Nel documento di candidatura si evidenziavano le caratteristiche dei Colli Euganei che vantano un paesaggio spettacolare caratterizzato da un gruppo di 81 pittoresche colline vulcaniche – ha spiegato – Oltre a centri termali e a una rigogliosa pianura agricola con numerosi uliveti e vigneti”. Il governatore ha sottolineato che la giunta ha seguito passo per passo il dossier – presentato dal Parco regionale dei Colli Euganei su input del presidente del Comitato nazionale Mab Unesco, Pier Luigi Petrillo – credendo fino in fondo al progetto.\nUn esempio, quello dei Colli Euganei, che dimostra come uomo e natura possano convivere armonicamente. “Ora tutto il mondo conosce il tesoro inestimabile delle nostre terre che si intreccia inscindibilmente con la nostra storia e cultura , con la nostra tradizione – hanno commentato i consiglieri regionali Elisa Cavinato, Giuseppe Pan e Luciano Sandonà – L'uomo è stato capace di costruire un rapporto armonioso con l'ambiente ”.\nWhatsApp\nFacebook\nX\nPrint\n© Riproduzione riservata",

Además, se espera cobertura nubosa y con neblina hacia el atardecer y en las primeras horas de la mañana. Senamhi precisa que las velocidades de los vientos para este viernes 22 de marzo superarán los 33 km/h, por lo que se recomienda tomar las precauciones debidas.
