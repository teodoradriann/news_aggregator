    "text": "1999 wird ein Gastwirt in Würzburg erschossen. Mehr als 26 Jahre später steht das Urteil an. So viele Jahre nach der Tat ist nur ein Delikt noch nicht verjährt.\nMehr als 26 Jahre nach dem gewaltsamen Tod eines Gastwirts in Unterfranken will das Landgericht Würzburg am Donnerstag (13.00 Uhr) ein Urteil in dem Fall verkünden. Angeklagt sind ein 67 Jahre alter Mann und sein 50-jähriger Sohn. Beide äußerten sich in dem seit Januar laufenden Verfahren nicht persönlich zu den Vorwürfen. Für die Verteidiger ist die Täterschaft der Angeklagten nicht erwiesen.\nLaut Anklage soll der 50-Jährige am 5. Januar 1999 als damals 23-Jähriger den Gastwirt im Auftrag seines Vaters erschossen haben, um einer Geldforderung Nachdruck zu verleihen. Der 55 Jahre alte Türke wurde durch mehrere Schüsse in seiner Gaststätte in Würzburg getötet. Die Tatwaffe ist bislang nicht gefunden. Im Frühjahr 2024 gingen nach Justizangaben Hinweise zu dem Fall ein, die den Anstoß zu dem Verfahren so lange nach der Tat gaben.\nStaatsanwaltschaft und Nebenkläger verlangten in ihren Plädoyers lebenslange Freiheitsstrafen für die Angeklagten wegen Mordes. Zudem wurde beantragt, die Schwere der Schuld festzustellen. Damit wäre eine Entlassung der Verurteilten nach 15 Jahren Haft nahezu ausgeschlossen.\nAlles außer Mord ist verjährt\nIst aus Sicht der Kammer den Männern das Tötungsdelikt nicht nachweisbar oder haben sie sich nach dem festgestellten Sachverhalt nicht strafbar gemacht, erfolgt ein Freispruch.\nWenn die Kammer davon ausgeht, dass die Angeklagten das Tötungsdelikt begangen haben, es aber kein Mord war, so kann ebenfalls ein Freispruch ergehen. Geht die Kammer von einem anderen Delikt wie beispielsweise Totschlag aus, könnte eine Einstellung des Verfahrens wegen Verjährung geboten sein.\nReichen aus Sicht des Gerichts allerdings die Beweise, die beiden einen Mord beispielsweise aus Heimtücke oder niedrigen Beweggründen nachweisen, wird es ein Urteil mit Strafzumessung geben.\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250717-930-806832/1",

    "title": "Year-End Review: Union Workers Slam Thombert, Inc. Led a successful strike. - Business News",
    "text": "December 30 – Thombert, Inc. Employees and members of United Auto Workers Local 997 reached an agreement with top officials on October 21 after nearly three months of protesting. According to the union's Facebook page, which has been posting frequent updates since August, the new contract has been signed. Representatives for UAW Local 997 did not immediately return phone calls from The Newton News by press time, so the contents of the contract remain unknown. When the strike first began, workers were frustrated, Thombert, Inc. had raised “leaps and bounds”, but it was not reflected in his pay cheque. Others argued that management's initial offer was an “insult” and “ridiculous”. Later that month, union groups from across the state joined Thombert workers on strike outside the company's Newton factory. Charlie Wishman, president of the AFL-CIO, the Iowa Federation of Labor, advocated for fair contracts. “We are here to show support and solidarity to let them know they are not alone,” he said. “Right now you have people from all walks of life, business, private sector, public sector. They're all here and in support of this because they want to make sure these people know we have their backs.” Iowa State Auditor Rob Sands showed his support for the union's efforts by meeting with individuals on the picket line earlier this month, as did state senators Nate Bolton and Sarah Garriott in September. US Senator Bernie Sanders also warned the local union on October 19, saying: “I stand in solidarity with the workers of UAW Local 997 in Newton, Iowa who have been on strike for more than (two) months. They are fighting for fair wages and health care costs and a better work-life balance. I “Call upon your employer, Thombert, Inc., to bargain in good faith.” Thombert is one of the world's largest manufacturers of polyurethane wheels and tires for narrow-aisle lift trucks. The manufacturer has been in business for several decades and operates out of Newton and Brooklyn.",

    "title": "Now that's what you call a love bite! Grisly footage reveals how male sharks grasp females with their TEETH during sex",
    "text": "They are some of the ocean’s most fearsome predators.\nNow, a study has revealed that sharks can be just as dangerous to their mates as they are to their prey.\nGruesome footage reveals the horrendous injuries inflicted by male sharks as they grasp females with their teeth while they mate.\nThese bloody love bites are now helping scientists piece together the hidden secrets of sharks’ sex lives.\nTo mate, sharks have to press their bellies together while the male penetrates the female.\nThat’s a fairly straightforward process for smaller, more nimble species.\nHowever, larger sharks often struggle to line themselves up for long enough.\nThis means that male sharks often violently bite down on the fins or gills of their mate to hold them in place, inflicting deep cuts in the process.\nWhile mating, male sharks will bite onto the pectoral fins or gills of females to hold them in place long enough to press their bellies together\nThe researchers looked at ‘mating wounds’ sustained by sand tiger sharks, a species which can grow up to three metres (10ft) in length.\nBecause these sharks spend most of their time as solitary hunters who mate out at sea, scientists don’t know many of the intimate details of their sex lives.\nAlthough cases of mating in the wild have only rarely been observed, the researchers realised that they could look at mating wounds instead.\nLead author Dr Jennifer Wyffels, a research scientists at Ripley’s Aquariums and the University of Delaware, told LiveScience : ‘Sharks and rays use their mouths to hold and position females and therefore, mating wounds are common during the reproductive season.\n‘Observations of mating for any shark or ray species are very rare so we used mating wounds as indirect evidence for reproductive behavior.’\nFirst, Dr Wyffels and her team observed a group of sand tiger sharks housed at Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada Marine Science Center.\nDuring this time the researchers recorded the sharks mating and saw how the male left severe wounds on the female.\nThe deepest injuries cut through the female’s skin down to the muscle but were surprisingly quick to heal – closing completely in just 22 days.\nThese violent rituals leave the females, and sometimes even the males, with deep ‘mating wounds’ which cut through the skin down to the muscle\nResearchers examined the mating wounds sustained by sand tiger sharks held in an aquarium as they healed. This allowed them to create a scale for rating the severity and freshness of mating wounds\nSand tiger sharks: Key facts Scientific name : Carcharias taurus\nSize : 2-3 metres (6.5-10ft)\nWeight : 90-160 kg (200 to 350 lbs)\nHabitat : Shallow, temperate regions near the coast in all oceans apart from the Eastern Pacific\nDiet : Small fish and crustaceans\nConservations status : Vulnerable\nDespite their fierce appearance, sand tiger sharks are actually docile and are only known to attack humans when threatened first. They are the only sharks known to come to the surface to gulp air which they store in their stomachs to float motionless while hunting. They have one of the lowest reproduction rates of any shark.\nBy recording those injuries and the healing process, the researchers developed a scale for describing the severity and healing stages of mating wounds.\nThe scale ranges from fresh, open stage one wounds to stage four wounds which have started to scar over.\nDr Wyffels and her co-authors then applied this scale to photos in the Spot A Shark USA database which collects citizens’ shark sighting images.\nThey analysed 2,876 pictures of 686 individual sand tiger sharks taken between 2015 and 2020.\nThese images revealed that the number of stage one wounds rose sharply in late May, suggesting that this is the peak of the breeding season.\nBy July, the number of fresh wounds had levelled off which indicates that the sharks were either mating less frequently or were doing so less violently.\nIn their paper, published in Environmental Biology of Fishes, the researchers write: ‘By mid to late summer, mating has ceased based on the lack of stages 1 and 2 mating wounds on females.’\nThe fact that the number of fresh wounds was highest off the coast of North Carolina also suggests that this is a popular breeding ground for sand tiger sharks.\nThe researchers analysed photos of sand tiger sharks in the Spot A Shark USA database to see how many mating wounds they had. Injuries sustained in the zones labelled 3, 4, and 5 were classified as mating wounds\nThis revealed that sharks had the most fresh wounds during late May, suggesting that the mating season is in mid to late summer. The data also shows that sharks with mating wounds were concentrated around North Carolina. This shows that the area is a mating and gestation hot-spot for sand tiger sharks\nLikewise, the researchers noticed that this region had a high number of female sharks bearing wounds which had been healing for much longer.\nThey write: ‘The presence of stages 1 and 2 mating wounds on sand tiger sharks in North Carolina suggests the area is used for mating while females with stages 3 and 4 mating wounds provide evidence that the area also serves as gestation habitat for this species.’\nIn addition to providing new insights into the lives of these elusive creatures, it also confirms their incredible powers of healing.\nIn the wild, sharks have been observed to live for long periods of time after suffering seemingly deadly wounds.\nDuring the study, the researchers even found sand tiger sharks which were living with their jaw almost torn off and parts of their skull exposed by wounds.\nHowever, they also found that wounds suffered by the aquarium sharks closed after 22 days and finished scarring over 85 days after being injured.\nThis rapid healing factor might explain how sharks survive for so long after injuries and why their mating wounds very rarely lead to long-term damage.\nWHAT GIVES RISE TO SHARKS’ ‘SIXTH SENSE’? Shark have electrosensory organs that act like a ‘sixth sense’\nThe ampullae of Lorenzini are visible as small pores in the skin around the head and on the underside of sharks, skates, and rays.\nEach pore is open and connected to a set of electrosensory cells by a long canal filled with a clear, viscous jelly.\nThe AoL jelly likely contributes to this electrosensing function, yet the exact details of this contribution remain unclear.\n‘Skates and sharks have some of the most sensitive electroreceptors in the animal world,’ said Dr David Julius, professor and chair of physiology at UCSF and senior author of a recent study on the mechanism.\n‘Understanding how this works is like understanding how proteins in the eye sense light – it gives us insight into a whole new sensory world,’ he said.\nREAD SOURCE",

Fantastic to keep a clean sheet.\"\nIt was the first ever clash between the sides with Atalanta having qualified for the competition by finishing fourth in Serie A last season, while they also won the Europa League.\nWhile Atalanta will be frustrated at not beginning with a notable victory, Gian Piero Gasperini's side showed that they will be a tough nut to crack in the group phase.\nSource: Reuters Sign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nSubscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nDownload here Get WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nJoin here Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...

    "text": "Finalement, la finale de la Ligue des Champions ne se déroulera pas à Milan en 2027. En conséquence, la mairie de Marseille a pris position pour accueillera l’événement au Vélodrome. Si tel était le cas, cela pose alors de grandes question si le PSG venait à jouer et gagner dans le stade de l’OM. Cela pourrait virer au désastre… Depuis 2011 et le rachat du [PSG](https://le10sport.com/football/ligue1/psg/psg-nouvelle-tension-avec-un-journaliste-714704), le Qatar n’a qu’un rêve : remporter la Ligue des Champions. Un rêve qui pourrait être exaucé en 2027… à Marseille. En effet, la cité phocéenne est candidate pour accueillir la finale suite au désistement de Milan. Mais compte tenu des rivalités avec l’OM, le fait que le PSG joue cette finale au Vélodrome pourrait virer au fiasco total. Mercato : Le PSG déjà plombé pour deux gros transferts ? — le10sport (@le10sport)[https://t.co/ylpomKixgS][pic.twitter.com/ge6guho0Zh][September 26, 2024] « Une mauvaise idée » « Si tout à fait par hasard il y avait 20 000 ou 25 000 Parisiens qui débarquaient ai Stade Vélodrome, ça serait ingérable. Je ne vois pas comment dans l’état actuel de la France, on peut espérer que ça se passe comme il faut. Aujourd’hui, ne serait-ce qu’avoir l’idée, je pense que c’est problème. Je pense que c’est une mauvaise idée », a ainsi confié Jean-Michel Larqué sur RMC. « La risée de tout le monde » Jean-Michel Larqué s’est par ailleurs rappelé la dernière finale de Ligue des Champions en France, qui était Real Madrid-Liverpool au Stade de France, et qui a été une catastrophe : « Il y a eu une finale de Ligue des Champions à Paris, qui n’impliquait ni le PSG ni l’OM qui a été une catastrophe nationale. Ce n’est pas vieux. On a été incapable de gérer cette finale. On a été la honte de la France et la risée de tout le monde ».",

Un video postato anonimamente su Telegram mostra del denso fumo nero alzarsi dalla base aerea, confermando l'entità dell'attacco. L'attacco ha provocato un incendio significativo nella base aerea, con le forze della difesa aerea russa che hanno tentato di respingere l'assalto. L'incendio ha causato danni considerevoli, con serbatoi di carburante in fiamme e una vasta area colpita. Questo attacco si inserisce in un contesto di crescenti tensioni e scontri nella regione occidentale russa di Kursk, dove le forze ucraine continuano a spingersi. A Proletarsk, nella regione di Rostov, un deposito petrolifero Rosrezerv è in fiamme da cinque giorni a causa di un attacco di droni avvenuto il 18 agosto. L'incendio a Proletarsk ha coinvolto 22 serbatoi di carburante e ha causato ferite a 47 vigili del fuoco, di cui 15 in condizioni gravi. Inoltre, 49 lavoratori sono rimasti feriti. Al 20 agosto, l'area dell'incendio copriva diecimila metri quadrati. Nel frattempo, la Russia ha messo sotto inchiesta un reporter della CNN e due giornalisti della TV ucraina, accusandoli di coinvolgimento negli attacchi. Kiev ha smentito le accuse di Putin riguardo a presunti attacchi alla centrale nucleare di Kursk, alimentando ulteriormente le tensioni tra i due paesi.",

( [WHNS](https://www.foxcarolina.com/2024/02/29/junkyard-employee-saves-cat-car-crusher-after-finding-her-under-hood/)/Gray News) – A junkyard employee in North Carolina saved a cat from a car about to be crushed. According to Brother Wolf Animal Rescue, an employee at the junkyard was removing the car’s battery “just moments” before it was sent to be crushed. “As he popped open the hood, a bundle of fur jumped out and took a blind leap of faith into his arms,” Brother Wolf Animal Rescue wrote in [a Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/BrotherWolfAnimalRescue/posts/pfbid02UTAG5neApB6ibhsRFA9UcR1VYHV6aGi3qWvSMNNoFXuZzzi8KYCdcPF1sBRkxsBSl). “She looked at him with soft eyes, thanking him with slow blinks and soft purrs. It was almost like she knew that her life had been saved.” The employee kept the cat bundled in his jacket for the rest of his shift before turning it over to Brother Wolf Animal Rescue, where his girlfriend works. A man called the junkyard very soon after, searching frantically for his cat. He described his cat, Lilly, as very adventurous, who loves riding in the car or on his motorcycle with him. She even has her own helmet. Brother Wolf Animal Rescue confirmed Lilly was the cat that the junkyard employee had rescued. The shelter offered to return Lilly to her owner vaccinated, microchipped, and spayed at no cost. He gladly accepted the offer. Lilly and her owner were reunited and very happy to see each other. “She melted into his arms as his eyes filled with tears of joy,” the shelter wrote in a Facebook post.
