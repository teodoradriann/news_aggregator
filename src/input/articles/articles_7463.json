    "text": "PARIS (AFP): French President Emmanuel Macron expressed “great concern” about a Catholic parish in war-torn Gaza with the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, his office said on Sunday.\nMacron spoke with Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa by telephone on Saturday to discuss the “tragic situation” there since the outbreak of war between Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants on October 7.\n“Hundreds of civilians of all confessions… have been living under bombs and bullets for more than two months while worshippers and nuns take care of the sick, elderly or disabled,” Macron was quoted as saying.\nThe Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said on December 16 that an Israeli soldier shot dead “in cold blood” a Christian mother and daughter on the grounds of the Gaza Strip’s only Catholic church.\nMacron offered his condolences for the parishioners who he said were killed “shamefully,” a week after Pope Francis deplored their deaths.\nThe Israeli army told AFP that a review supported findings that no church was hit and that civilians were not injured or killed.\nIt said it “does not target civilians, no matter their religion.”\nAs Christmas approaches, Macron asked Pizzaballa to “send a message of peace and solidarity to all Christians in the Holy Land and assure them France is by their side.”\nThe deadliest Gaza war was triggered by an unprecedented Hamas attack on Israel on October 7.\nHamas militants crossed the militarized border between Gaza and Israel and killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\nThe gunmen also seized around 250 hostages, 129 of whom are believed to remain in Gaza, Israeli officials say.\nAiming to eliminate Hamas, Israel’s retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 20,000 people, mostly women and children, according to the territory’s Hamas government.",

    "title": "OPINION: Alaska’s electric grid transformation is great for jobs",
    "text": "Our federal congressional delegation recently worked with the Biden administration to secure $206 million in electric grid investments for Alaska. This investment, along with additional energy investments, protects consumers from cost increases that would result from imported natural gas. Grid modernization and more energy generation also creates opportunities to drive down energy costs, making all businesses more competitive while creating major opportunities to strengthen our mining industry and other energy-intensive industries. Federal investment in our grid is just the latest good news for Alaska’s construction, oil and gas industries. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and the late Congressman Don Young were instrumental in working with President Joe Biden to pass the Bipartisan Energy Law, which is driving construction investment and has created the best job market in Alaska in a decade. Rep. Mary Peltola has continued Congressman Young’s long tradition of fighting to bring home these investments, including strong advocacy to bring home grid modernization funds. Why does this grid investment matter? Right now, the Golden Valley Electric Association (GVEA) is working to deploy a 130MW wind farm that will protect Interior customers from higher energy prices. It is difficult or impossible to build out this generation without modernizing our transmission to the Mat-Su, Anchorage and Kenai. By modernizing the Railbelt grid, we can deploy lower-cost clean energy in the Interior and help drive down energy prices. Utilities from Anchorage and the Mat-Su also are working on major new energy generation projects to drive down costs. Improved transmission is part of a broader effort to secure Alaska’s energy future. The Biden administration, following strong advocacy from our congressional delegation, has awarded a major grant to build out a huge energy storage facility near Healy. This innovative energy storage facility will help integrate low-cost clean energy and protect Interior consumers. Since it will be built by a union contractor, construction will mean great jobs with good benefits for Interior residents. Looking beyond electric generation, we have an incredibly bright future with energy production from Alaska. The Willow and Pikka projects on the North Slope are creating hundreds of good union jobs in construction. Many of our Alaska Native corporations and union contractors are working on additional energy generation, storage and carbon sequestration projects from the North Slope to the Railbelt. Taken together, these investments mean we will be generating more energy and creating more construction jobs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It all starts with a modern electric grid. Alaska-based energy production isn’t just important for jobs and opportunities in our state. We need to be an energy powerhouse to defend our democracy and support our allies who face threats from China and Russia. Fortunately, we’re moving in the right direction with more investment, more jobs, and more energy production. Thanks to the broad range of companies, electric cooperatives, and our Congressional delegation for working together on Alaska energy production.

    "title": "ISSUES WITH THE CNG POWERED CARS",
    "text": "Though a better alternative to petrol, TAYO OGUNBIYI argues the need to establish more CNG stations across the country\nOne of the major policy pronouncements of President Bola Tinubu upon his inauguration was the termination of the controversial fuel subsidy regime.\nI can still vividly recollect how Mr. President looked into the excited crowd at the Eagle Square and screamed, “Fuel subsidy is gone!”\nIf the crowd did not fully understand the import of the rather weighty pronouncement, they surely did by the following morning, as the fuel pump price astronomically moved from around N180 to over N1200.\nThus began a hyperinflation regime that suddenly shot up the prices of many items. Most affected, however, was the price of food items, as pepper, tomato, yam, rice, garri, and beans, among others, became prized items.\nThis, coupled with the high cost of transportation, made life quite unbearable for the average compatriot. Suddenly, the street became cold and quiet. This is no joke, the street simply stopped smiling. Perhaps, the most badly hit were the operatives of the informal sector who rely heavily on spending from middle-level income earners to survive. Sadly, the middle-level income earners were not finding things easy either.\nTo say that yours sincerely also felt the heat would be an understatement. For me, most hit was the cost of fueling my car. Before the cancellation of the fuel subsidy regime, I was hardly spending close to N40,000 on fuel for my car every month. However, with the “fuel subsidy is gone” assertion, it shot up by more than 300%. I was spending close to N300,000 per month on fuel.\nIt got so bad that I became nervous each time I gazed at the fuel gauge and discovered I needed to urgently refuel. By now, a few guys have abandoned their cars, opting for commercial vehicles. The road had become lighter with limited vehicles moving around.\nIt was a time that truly tested the much-talked-about resilient spirit of Nigerians. Considering the impolite, lousy, and uncouth nature of the typical Lagos driver and bus conductor, for me, going through commercial buses was never an alluring option.\nSo, I opted to carry my cross and sulk in silence. Meanwhile, the high cost of fuel was driving me crazy. Still, I chose to go by the hard way, which, as James Hardly Chase says, is the only way.\nBut then, I was soon to discover that the hard way, in this regard, was not the only way!\nOn a fateful day, I received a call from a good friend of mine, Ayoade, who lives in the highbrow part of the metropolis. After exchanging pleasantries, I teased him about the fuel situation, “I am sure you guys with fat pay care less about the high cost of fuel. As they say, man pass man”.\n“Who says?” he asked.\n“For your information, I have not taken my SUV out for about one year now. Fuelling it costs a fortune. So, what I do is to make use of my corolla car. Comparatively, it’s cheaper to fuel that”, he said.\nThen, all of a sudden, he changed the gear of the conversation.\n“Well, I have since moved on”, he said.\n“How do you mean?”, I asked rather curiously.\n“I have converted my SUV to CNG. I cannot come and die?”, he replied.\nTo douse my inquisitiveness, Ayoade went on to lecture me on CNG and the process involved en route conversion. By the average guy’s standard, he spent quite a fortune to make his SUV CNG compliant.\nThat, in his words, was a saving grace. Ever since, he said he has stopped wasting so much on fuelling.\nHe said, “That’s the way to go now, my brother. Do not listen to the lies on social media. It’s safe, convenient, and cost-effective to use CNG. I have been using it for about a year now, and I can tell you that I have no regrets”.\nEncouraged by Ayoade’s sincere analysis and advice, I also decided to have a go at the CNG experience. With his guidance, I was able to convert my car at a lesser cost because of it’s limited engine capacity. That was in November 2024.\nMaking that decision is a lifesaver. Indeed, that was probably the wisest financial decision that I made in 2014. Swiftly, my finances improved, and my blood pressure stabilized! From spending close to N300,000 a month on fuel, my expenses dropped dramatically to a little below N30,000 monthly. Yes, you heard me right!\nIt was like magic! It was too good to be true. The first time I visited the gas station to fill my tank, and I saw the cost on the meter, I couldn’t believe my eyes.\n“What did you say, sir?” I asked the attendant.\n“Your money is N2,800, sir”, he repeated.\nI cleared my eyes, looked at the meter, made the payment, and quickly zoomed off before he changed his mind.\nThat was how I was liberated from the shackles of the high cost of fuel.\nI have been driving my CNG-powered car since November 2024, and I can confidently attest to the fact that it is a better option, especially for middle-income earners.\nI had traveled from Lagos to Osogbo, in Osun State, spending less than N5000 on gas. I had traveled from Lagos to Ibadan in Oyo State, spending a mere N3800 on gas. I had traveled from Lagos to Abeokuta, spending less than N3000 on gas. For the average car user, the CNG is nothing but an economic liberator.\nHowever, in the typical Naija fashion, these days, it is increasingly becoming tough and arduous to get one’s car filled up. Many Nigerians, especially operatives of Danfo, Marwa, and Korope, have also jasi (become compliant).\nOnly God knows how!\nBut the truth is that a lot of the commercial bus operators now use CNG. As a result of this, getting one’s car filled up with gas is now like the proverbial eye of the needle.\nIt is becoming increasingly strenuous, stressful, and irritating. These days, one spends close to two hours waiting to get a refill. It’s as bad as that. If not for its immense economic benefits, it’s almost becoming a frustrating experience.\nOne finds it rather incredible that in the whole of Lagos, there are not up to eight functional CNG stations. I stand to be corrected, anyway! In the whole of Oyo and Osun States, as I write this piece, the functional CNG stations are not up to three. With the high rate at which many are converting to CNG, it is quite clear that the number of CNG stations across the country needs to be increased urgently and rapidly.\nThe promoters of CNG did a lot to convince the people to make the shift, so they need to do more to retain them. The government and all stakeholders need to do more to fully entrench the CNG culture into our transport system. It is good to have options, and it is a better option!\nConsidering the relief that it brings to the people, especially car users, the only way the government could show that it cares about the welfare of the people is to encourage more investment in the whole CNG system.\nOgunbiyi is Director, Features, Ministry of Information & Strategy, Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos",

    "text": "Home where cold case victim was last seen alive set to be demolished\nBy Alyssa Erwin\nClick here for updates on this story\nFLINT, Michigan (\nWJRT) — July 1 will mark 27 years of the Jessica Phelps cold case. As of now, the home where the 4-year-old went missing in 1997 is on the Genesee County demolition list. One of the only physical reminders of the crime is the East Side home, set to be torn down.\nThe blonde-haired, blue-eyed four-year-old went missing from the front yard of her home at 1621 Maryland Avenue in the City of Flint over two decades ago.\n“I just wish she would have been here for all of it,” says Angie Kranzo. “I just wish I could know who she would be today.”\nJessica’s cousin Angie Kranzo, who also babysat the young girl, has made it her mission to keep the memory alive. She looks through keepsakes and dozens of missing posters, with still no real closure.\n“She just lit up the room. There is no other way to explain her personality. It was big, and it was huge. It was way, way beyond her 4-year-old self,” said Kranzo. “I could see her being the babysitter for my kids now. They see her picture, and they know who she was, and my daughter is now named after her.”\nLike many people around the Flint area, they know the back story of Jessica Phelps and the location.\n“Every July 1, we wake up, and it’s on everyone’s mind. It makes my stomach turn,” says the cousin. “I remember it like it was yesterday, seeing everyone out searching for her and calling her name.”\nSearch parties took over, as many East Side residents and law enforcement came together in the summer of 1997. The little girl’s remains were found 15 miles away in a drainage ditch in Atlas Township, nine months after she went missing.\nAccording to the Genesee County Landbank, in an updated schedule, the demolition timeframe for 1621 Maryland is shifting to be between October and March. The last known location of Jessica being alive will no longer be standing.\n“It’s sad. This is the last place she was known to be. At least that we know of,” said Kranzo. “I hope they’ve processed the house, just in case.”\nABC 12 has previously reported police believe they know who killed her. However, the primary suspect in the case died in 2007, so the case technically remains open.\nWith changing detectives over the years, Kranzo says she will continue to be the voice for her young cousin.\n“I’m just going to keep being her voice, and that’s all I can do for her,” she says. “I’ve promised her that.”\nWith over two decades of an open cold case, there have been candlelight vigils and balloon releases to honor Jessica, but still, Kranzo adds still no justice and many unanswered questions.\nABC 12 contacted the Flint Police about any updates in this case, but they have not responded.\nThere is also a Facebook page, ‘Justice for Jessica,’ to keep the memory alive as the family approaches year 27 without the case being solved.\nAnyone with information on Phelps’ case should contact Flint police at\n[810-237-6800](tel:8102376800).\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

LOUIS (KMOX) - A group that started as a downtown community garden and evolved into a local food system has won a federal prize for its work.\nUrban Harvest has been named a phase two winner in the Environmental Justice Community Innovator Challenge from the Department of Health and Human Services.\nUrban Harvest Executive Director Katie Houck says over the past decade they've grown more than 45,000 pounds of fresh produce, delivered free to low-income, low-access communities.\n\"Our farms and gardens offer more than just healthy foods,\" said Houck on 'Total Information A.M'. \"They're transforming former industrial sites to protective growing spaces and offering a solution to climate change.\"\n\"They're a community space that brings neighbors together and forges those bonds of community.\"\nUrban Harvest, which was established as a non-profit in 2011, has six farms in the City of St. Louis. The group's goals have been to grow foods for communities that lack access to fresh produce.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Forget Microsoft, Here's a Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy",
    "text": "Investors piled into both Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Adobe ( ADBE -0.43% ) in 2023. The software giants outperformed a rallying Nasdaq Composite index last year, mainly thanks to soaring optimism about artificial intelligence (AI) and its ability to boost the value of creative and productive software platforms in the years ahead.\nWhile Microsoft has its advantages in this arena, it's far from an ideal growth stock. Let's look at a few reasons why an investor might prefer Adobe shares to gain exposure to the AI boom right now.\n1. Generating more sales growth Adobe has some workflow software products that help enterprises in the same way that Microsoft does, but its creative focus exposes the business to more gains in the generative AI niche as opposed to Microsoft's core productivity solutions.\nThese products mostly fall under Adobe's Firefly platform, which is attracting fantastic engagement right now. In mid-December, management said that users have generated nearly 5 billion creations since its launch in March, in fact.\nAdding generative fill and generative expand capabilities to Photoshop has significantly boosted that software's value. These two offerings are seeing record adoption right now, executives said, and are \"already among the most used features\" in Photoshop. That's a road map for potentially faster sales growth over time, although right now Adobe and Microsoft are expanding at about the same 13% rate.\n2. Software over hardware You might also like Adobe for its centralized exposure to the software industry, a more stable and profitable arena than Microsoft's consumer hardware niches have been. Microsoft endured weak demand for its tablets and laptops last year, for example, while Adobe's growth was spread more evenly across its creative cloud and document cloud segments.\nThat's one big benefit of Adobe's software-as-a-service approach, which generates tons of recurring revenue, with little in the way of infrastructure costs to hold back profit margins. Its $7 billion of cash flow in fiscal 2023 was a testament to that financial success.\nSure, Microsoft is a much more profitable business today thanks to its huge global sales footprint and its established foothold in areas like enterprise services. But owning Adobe stock will allow you to benefit as the creative software giant ideally closes that performance gap over the coming years.\n3. Price and value Adobe is the more expensive stock by most conventional metrics. You'll have to pay 14 times annual sales for this business and 49 times yearly profit compared to Microsoft's ratios of 13 and 36, respectively. And that valuation looks more elevated considering the failed acquisition of the Figma business .\nAdobe has a great chance at earning that premium valuation thanks to all the reasons discussed above. It is also free from the huge market capitalization level that could be holding Microsoft back in the coming years. Adobe's business is valued at $263 billion today, making it one of the biggest software companies on the market.\nThat's still a far cry from Microsoft's nearly $3 trillion position. Investors can't count on Adobe climbing past the $1 trillion mark anytime soon. But there's still room for it to significantly boost its market value over the coming years as it adds more customers and fills out its growing portfolio of software services.",
