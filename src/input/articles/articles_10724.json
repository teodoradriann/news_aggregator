    "title": "Spencer Carbery was gifted a signed Wayne Gretzky stick as a kid: 'That was my prized possession growing up'",
    "text": "Alex Ovechkin isn’t the only member of the Washington Capitals’ organization who owns a piece of hockey history that once belonged to Wayne Gretzky .\nCapitals head coach Spencer Carbery was recently asked by 106.7 The Fan’s Sports Junkies about Ovechkin’s opportunity to wear Gretzky’s game-used equipment after a practice in Edmonton . During the conversation, he revealed that he, like Ovechkin, owns one of Gretzky’s old wooden sticks.\n“Oh, geez, this is gonna be – you ready for this one?” Carbery said. “So, actually in 198-, I think it was ’88 or ’87, I got a signed Wayne Gretzky stick. Yeah, so one of the original Titan wood. That’s what Wayne used back in his Edmonton Oiler days: a wooden Titan stick, red. I got that as a young seven, eight-year-old kid, personalized, and he signed it for me. So that was my prized possession growing up.”\nCarbery revealed that the stick had been on display in his home in British Columbia, but he brought it to DC after the Capitals visited Vancouver last year. Now, he keeps it within reach at the Caps’ practice facility.\n“I’ve always been nervous to transport it and mail it, [so] I got my dad to bring it over when we played the Canucks,” Carbery said. “I brought it back on the plane, so it’s currently in DC. I don’t know if it’s superstitious, but I had it in the office at MedStar, and I sort of have just let it sit there. And I feel like it’s been good karma for O as he’s chased this record over the last maybe 12 calendar months. It’s been sitting there just as a reminder, and it’s kind of pushing O in a weird way, I feel like.”\nSince that March 16 game against the Canucks, Ovechkin has scored 34 goals in his last 48 games. The .71 goal-per-game rate would see Ovechkin score 58 goals over a full 82-game schedule.\nAfter his most recent goal, an overtime winner against the Ottawa Senators , Ovechkin moved just 20 goals shy of sharing the all-time goals record with Gretzky. The 39-year-old winger is on pace to tie and break the 894 mark this season.\n“Wayne and Ovi, as they go through this – they just appreciate the history of the game and are such great ambassadors because they’re always about growing the game and what’s best for the game,” Carbery said. “Wayne has never been protective of the record and has always embraced Ovi chasing it because he knows the positive attention it’ll bring the game of hockey and the NHL. And Ovi, I feel like, appreciates, on his side of it, the history and what’s been done before him.\n“You see that with he’s a big-time collector of current players. Some of the young guys he tries to get a stick signed by, even some of the new guys that are just breaking into the league. So they are both just such great ambassadors for our game and appreciate the history of the sport.”\nOvechkin’s collection of game-used sticks from both modern peers and legends of the game is massive. He received his stick from Gretzky when the Capitals won the Stanley Cup in 2018 and told reporters in Edmonton on Tuesday that it’s one of his favorites among the hundreds he has collected.\n“Well, obviously Gretzky, Mario Lemieux stick, yeah,” Ovechkin said. “I have lots of sticks, so, yeah, it’s pretty cool.”",

    "title": "Derrick Henry stats today: Titans' RB puts up big numbers in likely last game with Tennessee",
    "text": "The Titans didn't have a shot at the postseason heading into their Week 18 matchup against the Jaguars, but they were able to end things on a high note with a 28-20 victory at home, spoiling Jacksonville's playoff chances and finishing the season 6-11. Among the players who stood out the most was veteran running back Derrick Henry, who might have just played his final snap in Tennessee and will go down as one of the best rushers in NFL history. Here's a look into Henry's swan-song performance as many wonder where he'll play next year and if rookie Tyjae Spears can lead the TItans' backfield in 2024. Henry finished out Sunday's win over the Jaguars with 153 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries. It was just the fourth time this season he's eclipsed the century mark. This performance comes on the heels of a dismal 26-3 loss to the Texans in which Henry logged 12 carries for 42 yards as the team's leading rusher. Just two games before that, the 6-foot-3, 247-pounder had one of the worst performances of his career, also against the Texans, recording 16 carries for just nine yards. Sunday marked the best statistical performance of the season for Henry, and all signs point to it being his last in Nashville. Based on what he said on the field after the game on Sunday, it's hard to envision a scenario in which he returns for another year with the Titans. \"Thank you for the greatest eight years of my life,\" Henry said following the game. \"I hope I was an inspiration to all of the young kids.\" Selected 45th overall by the Titans in the 2016 draft, Henry has carried Tennessee to plenty of big wins while redefining \"workhorse\" for the modern era. Here's a look at how Henry has performed on the stat sheet over the years. Henry just finished out the last year of a four-year contract extension worth $50 million that he signed in 2020. He carries a roughly $16.4 million cap hit this season and will count against the Titans' salary cap for the next two years because of the void years that exist on his contract. Here's a look at the complete structure of Henry's contract, which is set to expire after the 2023 NFL season. * Henry is not under contract in 2024 or 2025. The Titans simply attached two void years to Henry's deal to differ some of the accounting for guaranteed money paid to him in future seasons. With this, Henry will count against the cap even while not with the Titans in 2024 and 2025.",

    "text": "Gov. Ron DeSantis says this week’s major hurricane didn’t wreck buildings as much as he feared, even as he surveyed the arguable epicenter of the storm’s destructive path.\nDeSantis appeared in Sarasota near where Hurricane Milton made landfall Wednesday evening. He extolled the performance of mobile homes and newer construction in general as better than expected given the hurricane’s impacts.\n“I mean, there’s damage behind me with some of these. Honestly, for the mobile home stuff, I thought there would be more roofs (destroyed). So some of these mobile homes, I mean, they’ve done a lot better in Florida over the years. We flew in over a number of the communities as well. There were definitely some roofs that were really bad, but then there were others that did really well,” DeSantis said.\nRegarding “buildings that were built in the last 20 to 30 years,” DeSantis said “they did very well” and “look good.”\nDeSantis said he is still assessing damage from the storm, and is “confident” the state will “bounce back.”\nStructural critique is a feature of the Governor’s post-storm commentary, as those who were in Florida back in 2022 remember in the wake of Hurricane Ian, when he repeatedly condemned buildings constructed during the 1970s and ’80s as “not being built for the long haul.”\n“Whatever happened in the ’70s and ’80s, I don’t know. Not the best building material. I don’t know what it was, but you definitely see that,” DeSantis said.\nHe contemporaneously commented that “sometimes the stuff built in like the ’40s and ’50s did better than the stuff built in the ’70s and ’80s” during Ian.\nDeSantis’ reassurances about property holding up during the hurricane come after Insurance Commissioner Michael Yaworsky announced that USAA was going to continue operating in the state.",

Source: Zelenskyy’s [evening address](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/bilshe-sistem-ppo-ta-zasobiv-urazhennya-rosijskoyi-aviaciyi-89621) Quote: \"Russian murderers and torturers are not moving further into Europe solely because they are being held back by Ukrainians with weapons in their hands under the blue and yellow flag. In Ukraine, there were many once-white walls of houses and churches that are now scorched and ruined after being hit by Russian shells. And this speaks very eloquently as to who needs to stop in order for the war to end. Everybody who is protecting life and people is fulfilling the most honourable mission there can be amid this inhumane invasion… When the Russian evil unleashed this war on 24 February [2022], all Ukrainians rose up to defend their land. Christians, Muslims, Jews – everyone. And I am grateful to every Ukrainian chaplain who is in the army, in the Defence Forces. They are on the front line, protecting life and humanity, supporting [the troops] with prayer, conversation, and action. This is what the church is about – being with people. Not 2,500 kilometres away, engaging in virtual mediation between those who want to live and those who want to kill them.\" Details: Zelenskyy did not mention Pope Francis in his address, but he was clearly referring to the Pope’s remark that [ Ukraine should have what he called the \"courage of the white flag\"](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/03/9/7445738/) and negotiate an end to the war with Russia.

Existe a suspeita de atuação de milícias armadas. Os fatos foram relatados em documentos enviados à Fundação Nacional dos Povos Indígenas (Funai) e ao Ministério dos Povos Indígenas. Os ataques ocorreram nos dias 23 e 24 de dezembro, na região do território Tekoha Guasu Guavirá, não demarcado e reivindicado há anos pelos guaranis que vivem no oeste do Paraná, perto da fronteira com o Paraguai. Os índios pediram que o Ministério da Justiça envie a Força Nacional para reforço na segurança. A Polícia Federal (PF) informou que não iria se pronunciar \"sob pena de prejuízo de investigações em andamento\".

    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — A strong geomagnetic storm is impacting earth Thursday night, and this is producing beautiful views of the northern lights across northern portions of the United States. Due to the strength of this geomagnetic storm, faint views of the northern lights are even visible right here in Central Texas through long exposure photos! Below is the view from Coupland, Texas in Williamson County from Thursday evening. The northern lights were also visible through long exposure photos just north of the KVUE area in Temple, Texas! Here in Central Texas, the northern lights are very unlikely to be visible to the naked eye. However, if you look to the north low on the horizon and take a long exposure photo on your phone or camera, there is a chance you might be able to see them northern lights faintly. Again, it is not a slam dunk that you will be able to see the northern lights, even through photographs here in Central Texas. The best chances will be north of Austin and away from any bright city lights. Best of luck!",
