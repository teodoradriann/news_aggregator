    "text": "MADRID, 13 Jun. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nEl Consejo de Seguridad de Naciones Unidas ha aprobado este jueves una resolución que pide a las paramilitares Fuerzas de Apoyo Rápido (RSF) que detengan de inmediato el asedio contra la ciudad sudanesa de El Fasher, capital de Darfur Norte (oeste), en el marco de la guerra desatada desde abril de 2023 en el país africano.\nLa resolución, impulsada por Reino Unido, ha sido aprobada con 14 votos a favor, si bien Rusia se ha abstenido. El texto expresa profunda preocupación por los continuados ataques a la ciudad y alerta del riesgo de una mayor escalada en la región.\n\"La adopción de esta resolución manda un mensaje claro. El Consejo exige que las RSF pongan fin inmediato al asedio de El Fasher y que todas las partes se alejen del abismo. Un ataque a la ciudad sería catastrófico, con 1,5 millones de personas refugiadas en la ciudad\", ha indicado la representante de Reino Unido ante la ONU, Barbara Woodward.\nEl texto exige que las partes garanticen la protección de los civiles, lo que incluye la entrada y salida de civiles de El Fasher, así como que faciliten \"el paso rápido, seguro, sin obstáculos y sostenido de ayuda humanitaria\", con la apertura del paso de Adre.\nLa guerra estalló el 15 de abril de 2023 a causa de las fuertes discrepancias en torno al proceso de integración del grupo paramilitar --ahora declarado como una organización terrorista-- en el seno de las Fuerzas Armadas, situación que provocó el descarrilamiento definitivo de la transición abierta en 2019 tras el derrocamiento del régimen de Omar Hasán al Bashir.\nSegún datos de la Organización Internacional para las Migraciones (OIM), los combates han dejado ya más de diez millones de desplazados internos. El conflicto en el país, en el que viven cerca de 50 millones de personas, tiene su epicentro durante las últimas semanas en la ciudad de El Fasher, capital de Darfur Norte, donde cerca de 800.000 civiles permanecen atrapados en medio de los intensos enfrentamientos entre el Ejército y las RSF, que impusieron un cerco a la ciudad.\nLeer más acerca de: Onu Sudán",

They said these fences have been causing immense suffering and harm to animals, often resulting in fatal injuries.\nThe\nCJ Memorial Trust has launched a petition, addressed to BBMP Chief Engineer, on February 28 emphasising on the urgent need to replace spiked fences in public construction. The petition stated that the Bangalore SPCA has already raised concerns about this issue, citing instances where dogs have gotten stuck and impaled on these fences, leading to painful deaths. It stated that the medical cost of recovery for one such cruelly caught dog was over Rs 1.3 lakh apart from three months in a hospital.\nThe petition proposed immediate actions including ensuring that all fences around the city, especially in public parks and buildings, have smooth edges and no spikes.\n“If spikes are already present, weld and file them away immediately for safety. The authorities have to incorporate designs that prioritise animal and human safety in BBMP and PWD engineering manuals.\nWe are happy to provide examples of humane fence designs,’’ the petition read.\nThey emphasised that it is crucial that BBMP takes a strong stance on this issue.\nAbout the spiked fences in and around Cubbon Park,\nTanya Bhat, an animal lover from Cooke Town, said the design of the existing fence is wrong. “The fence at Cubbon Park must be redesigned as it is dangerous to stray dogs,’’ said Bhat.\nThe SPCA, based on a complaint dated January 11, 2024, from CJ Memorial Trust, wrote a letter to the Deputy Director (Cubbon Park),\nHorticulture Department on January 12, to take measures to replace spiked fences in Cubbon Park.\nPriya Chetty-Rajagopal, Managing Trustee of CJ Memorial Trust, said that it is important to not only resolve this present issue now (by welding out the sharp spikes)on a war footing but also to ensure that any future construction precludes and bars cruel spikes.\n“All agencies like BBMP, PWD, SPCA, KAWB, and contractors associations should come together to incorporate this design and understand that we are breaching\nanimal cruelty laws.\nNo excuses about lack of responsibility or funds. It just has to be done and as early as possible as lives are at stake,’’ she said.\nShe said that there have been many in the city including cats and dogs that have jumped and fallen on spikes. “It is horrific to see such suffering, but I can share the ones at Cubbon Park . The Cubbon team rescued four, who survived being ripped by the spikes and one ran away despite a 10-day hunt,’’ she said.\nKusuma G, Deputy Director (Cubbon Park), Horticulture Department, told BM the filing down of spikes on fences will be done in phases.\nAnimal lovers have launched a campaign demanding that the government put a stop to using spiked fences in public construction and also remove the existing ones as such fences pose danger to\nThe\nThe petition proposed immediate actions including ensuring that all fences around the city, especially in public parks and buildings, have smooth edges and no spikes.\n“If spikes are already present, weld and file them away immediately for safety.

    "title": "Hamas’ philosophy: All civilians, all children are tools of war",
    "text": "Much of the world continues to condemn Israel for waging its war against Hamas . As the casualty figures on both sides grow, Israel is facing the usual calls for a ceasefire. A call which this country has rightly not joined in. But as well as the Hamas supporters and antisemites who hurl accusations against Israel whatever it does, there are also well-meaning people who genuinely do not seem to understand the war that Israel is fighting. Every time a home is destroyed in Gaza, or a civilian building is targeted much of the world seems bewildered and outraged. In the process the worst libels against the Jewish state get repeated. Claims that the Israelis deliberately target civilians. Claims that Israel is committing war crimes, and more. Take the case the other week when photos emerged of Hamas terrorists in Gaza stripped to their underwear by the IDF . People who had no desire to speak up when Israeli women were raped suddenly seemed furious that suspected terrorists might have been stripped down to their underwear. Of course these online, armchair warriors seem to presume that they themselves are experts in counter-terror techniques. They seem to assume that there either are no Hamas militants in the Gaza, or that no member of Hamas would ever wear a suicide bomb under their clothes. Which is the sort of thing that means that IDF soldiers have to get them to strip down. But worse is when people make claims that the IDF somehow deliberately target civilians. Even children. Earlier this week The Post published a story about Hamas hiding explosives in toy boxes. That is absolutely true and the tip of the iceberg. To get a better sense of what the IDF is actually facing on the ground in Gaza I spoke this week with a man I can only identify as “Major Y.” He is an American who went to Israel to fight in the immediate aftermath of October 7th. He has been fighting in Gaza constantly since then in a special forces unit. These are some of the things he told me about his experiences there. The first thing that the outside world does not seem to know is that Hamas routinely uses civilian houses as weapon stores. This is a complete flouting of the laws of war, including the Geneva conventions which mandate that armies must not use civilian sites for military use. Major Y and other people on the ground I have spoken with say that they estimate about one in every two or three homes in Gaza they go into has military weaponry, including AK47s, grenades and rocket launchers. And they routinely find entrances to Hamas’s terror tunnels inside civilian houses. And not just anywhere, but most often in the children’s bedrooms and even under cots. Indeed one member of the IDF I spoke with this week says that this is such a pattern that when they search a house they now go straight to the children’s bedrooms to uncover weapons caches and entrances to the tunnels. They recently found an RPG underneath a baby’s crib. Furthermore, Major Y says that every single mosque they go into has a Hamas weapons store. As has every UN school that they go into. Again this violates every rule of war. Hamas use places of worship — while pretending to be such “devout” Muslims — because they know the Israelis will not target their places of worship. They use schools as arms dumps because they know that if Israel targets an empty school the world will go berserk. It is a cynical tactic, that of course puts at risk the very Palestinians who Hamas pretend to be representing. According to the Major, “every school and kindergarten we go into we find guns in the basement. In each one we found more than ten AK47s, machine guns and grenades.” And that’s when Hamas terrorists are not there. On the ground, amid the intense fighting in the south of Gaza, the major tells me the sort of things he has encountered. On one occasion recently his unit spotted an old lady in a wheelchair alone on a street corner in the south of Gaza. They approached the elderly lady “who looked like my grandmother” according to the major. And as they approached her they were suddenly fired on by a Hamas terrorist. He had placed himself under her wheelchair in order to fire on the Israeli soldiers. This is the Hamas that pretends to care for Palestinians but would even use an elderly disabled Palestinian woman as a human shield. On another occasion recently the major says that his unit was beside an UNWRA school. The soldiers saw a 13-year old boy running with a bag near one of the schools. He put it down and ran away. A few minutes later it detonated, badly wounding one of the Israeli soldiers nearby. When people ask how Israel could treat even some children as potential terrorists, this is why. As the major said, Hamas didn’t think for a moment “about the Palestinian civilians” who were nearby when the bomb went off. I ask about the claims that Israeli troops have to treat even people coming towards them with white flags with suspicion. I have seen this myself in the Gaza — where the IDF ask people to step forward very slowly even when are waving white flags. The major says that on many occasions in recent weeks he has seen Hamas use precisely these people to carry out attacks. Recently he says “a group of old women and old men” came out of a building waving a white flag. Then someone came out from within their ranks and started shooting at the soldiers. Because of the civilians the Israelis did not shoot back at the terrorist. In other words, the Israelis expressed more care for the Palestinian civilians than this Palestinian terrorist. Situations like this happen “every day” says the major. Add to this the rockets and grenades they routinely uncover in UNWRA and other UN bags. And the tunnel entrances and weapons stores are everywhere. One tunnel entrance was just found in a school’s playing fields. This, then, is the Hamas way of war. And the Israeli way of war. One side uses civilians as human shields. The other tries to locate terrorists. So how strange it is that so many Americans — especially young Americans — condemn the Israelis. It is Hamas that started this. And Hamas that is the real enemy not just of Israel but of the Palestinian people.",
