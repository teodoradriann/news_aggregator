    "text": "30 Jul, 2025 Influencer sentiment soars as Tesla partners with Samsung for next-gen AI chip, reveals GlobalData\nPosted inBusiness Fundamentals\nTesla has emerged as a trending company among influencers on X, primarily due to its significant $16.5 billion contract with Samsung Electronics for the manufacturing of advanced semiconductors. This partnership marks a pivotal moment for both companies. For Tesla, it solidifies its position in the competitive electric vehicle (EV) and AI landscape, while for Samsung, it represents a crucial step in diversifying its semiconductor business beyond traditional markets like smartphones, reveals the Social Media Analytics Platform of GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.\nShreyasee Majumder, Social Media Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The sentiment reflects a belief that Samsung’s advanced 2-nanometer technology will enhance Tesla’s capabilities in artificial intelligence (AI) and EVs. Many express confidence in the potential advantages of the partnership, highlighting that Tesla’s decision to collaborate with Samsung may help ease the reliance on TSMC, which currently holds a dominant position in the semiconductor market.”\nBelow are a few popular influencer opinions captured by GlobalData’s Social Media Analytics Platform:\n“Tesla is a physical AI company + software AI company. It is the only company, today, that is tying both branches of AI together at scale. It will not be the only one in the end, but it is the only one now…”\n“$TSLA choosing Samsung for its AI6 chip is not a negative for $TSM. Based on what was reported and my thoughts, I believe Elon has negotiated very favorable terms with Samsung for $TSLA’s chips, as Samsung wants to land a big customer on the leading-edge node. (Reports are that Samsung will make a loss from this project.)\n“More broadly, I think it also shows that $TSM is fully booked and busy with its biggest clients, such as $NVDA, $AAPL, and others. According to recent reports, many of the big clients have shifted almost entirely to $TSM due to better yields. For Elon it is a smart move to take the chance on Samsung as $TSLA was not the priority customer for $TSM. With xAI he is still on of the biggest buyers of $NVDA chips which are made by $TSM, so he can get supplied by both….”\n“Samsung wins $16.5B Tesla deal to make AI6 chips in Texas thru 2033. Major breakthrough for Samsung’s foundry business (8% share) vs TSMC’s 68% market share. Diversifies Samsung beyond smartphones into AI/robotics, providing US domestic alternative to Taiwan production.”\n“Samsung will manufacture Tesla’s chips using 2-nanometer (nm) process technology – this is basically the very latest manufacturing tech. It’s a big deal for Samsung to prove it can handle such a contract with the hope other big names will follow”",

    "title": "McConnell: SCOTUS Should Punish 2 Dems Over Recusal Demands | Newsmax.com",
    "text": "By Mark Swanson | Thursday, 06 June 2024 04:34 PM EDT Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asserted that the Supreme Court should \"discipline\" a pair of Democrats who are lawyers for their pressure campaign to force the recusal of Justice Samuel Alito over the flag flap. In remarks made on the Senate floor Wednesday, McConnell suggested Democrat Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut should face reprimand for privately urging Chief Justice John Roberts to remove Alito from Jan. 6 cases. As members of the Supreme Court bar and bound by rules of the American Bar Association (ABA), McConnell said Blumenthal and Whitehouse are held to a higher standard than other Democrats angling for Alito's recusal. \"These senators are telling the chief justice, privately, to change the course of pending litigation. This is known as ex parte communication and it is frowned upon by the ABA's [Rules of Professional Conduct],\" McConnell said on the chamber floor. Having \"engaged in unethical professional conduct before the court,\" McConnell said, they are \"bound by a different set of rules than a mere senator. These rules provide for discipline against those who engage in 'conduct unbecoming' an officer of the court.\" Whitehouse pushed back on McConnell's definition of \"private.\" \"This was a public letter to the Court on an administrative matter pointing out the lack of any meaningful ethics process to enforce our recusal law, and asking the Chief Justice to act in his administrative role as chief,\" Whitehouse told CNBC in a statement. \"This was not some secret request for a justice to rule one way or the other on the merits of a case.\" Further, Whitehouse said, Roberts and Alito also viewed the communication as public. Whitehouse and Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sent a letter to Roberts in late May urging Alito's recusal on Jan. 6 cases because Alito's wife flew a flag upside down, an alleged dog whistle to Jan. 6 protesters. Blumenthal followed with a letter asking the same, also adding that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas should recused. McConnell dismissed the Democrats as \"profoundly unserious\" but said their efforts went \"beyond the standard disgraceful bullying my Democratic colleagues have perfected.\" \"The legal profession is in distress. Unethical behavior by attorneys serving political causes unfortunately knows no party or faction,\" McConnell added. \"It is up to the legal profession to police itself. And in the end, this means that courts — including the Supreme Court — must police their officers.\" Mark Swanson, a Newsmax writer and editor, has nearly three decades of experience covering news, culture and politics. © 2024 Newsmax.
