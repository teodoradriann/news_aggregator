    "text": "In a statement, the NBA said Portis tested positive for tramadol, a prescription pain medication that his representative told ESPN the player took by mistake.\n\"I am devastated for Bobby right now because he made an honest mistake and the ramifications of it are incredibly significant,\" Mark Bartelstein of Priority Sports told ESPN.\n\"Bobby unintentionally took a pain medication called tramadol, thinking he was taking a pain medication called Toradol. Toradol is an approved pain medication that he has used previously and that teams and players use for pain and inflammation at times,\" Bartelstein said.\nToradol is a brand name for the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ketorolac.\nThe suspension means Portis, who helped the Bucks win the 2021 NBA championship, will miss most of the Bucks' remaining 29 regular-season games.\nHe will be eligible to return on April 8 against the Minnesota Timberwolves, with four games left in the regular season.\nThe loss of Portis, a key reserve, is a blow to a Bucks team in fifth place in the East.\nPortis, who has finished in the top three in voting for the Sixth Man of the Year award the past two seasons, is averaging 13.7 points and 8.3 rebounds in 46 games this season.",

    "title": "Ed Swain’s island farm may be the last one in western Maine",
    "text": "BETHEL — Alongside the meandering Androscoggin River under a blue sky dotted with puffy white clouds, tall grass waves in the gentle breeze.\nBethel Farmer Ed Swain calls this painterly island, “a unique spot.”\nGone now are the many other island farms that once dotted the Androscoggin River in Western Maine; Swain stands as the last island farmer in this part of the state. He says access was most likely why others no longer island farm.\nHis own access, sometimes very difficult, is mostly doable. While Swain’s land flooded in 2023, he dismisses it as, “an odd year … a 100-year flood.”\nOver the years, Swain’s father acquired many of the smaller adjoining plots that now constitute his son’s expansive 100-acre farm. While he actively farms 60 of those acres, he also tends to additional parcels owned by others who rely on him for haying services.\nIsland tour\nThe Androscoggin River splits and rejoins itself in several places in Bethel and Gilead. Swain’s island stretches more than a mile in distance.\nSwain who has been driving a tractor since he was seven or eight, powers through a 125-foot span of the river in his large pick-up truck with “good tires,” to reach his island. Long tufts of grass get stuck in the grill so the front of the truck ends up looking like a mustached face.\nWhen the river has been very high, “We’ve hauled corn across in an old motor boat,” he says, pointing to a former ice house where he stores a tractor or two in case of high water in the winter.\nSwain grows vegetables, too. “My rows are pretty straight, almost as good as Sunday River [potato] Farms,” he brags.\nHe plants his island corn every week to 10 days, offering customers fresh batches at the farmstand through the fall. Off-island he grows and sells tomatoes, potatoes, zucchini, summer squash, peppers, eggplant, cabbage, broccoli, pumpkins and decorative corn.\nHaying\nSwain watches the weather carefully since the hay needs to bake in the hot sun for three consecutive days. Some years they have the first haying done by the Fourth of July, he didn’t think that would happen this year, but in the end the weather cooperated. On July 2 and 3 Swain’s four friends show up to work, plus a few high school helpers.\nTelstar senior Kyle Kimball, 17, of Gilead, points to where he saw a bald eagle fly over his head, “When I’m here, it’s like I’m in a Hardy Boys novel,” he says.\nOn his father’s urging, he answered the ad to help with haying, as his father, Josh, had done when he was a teenager.\nOn his first day Kyle was late. When he called, Swain told him he’d have to cross the river on foot since they were already on the island.\nSwain starts the arduous project with a haying mower that has an eight-foot span.\nA tedder spreads the hay out across the field to help dry it. Next, they rake it into circular windrows. Finally, Swain rides his tractor in circles with the baler attached. Magically squared bales pop out the back of the baler where the other workers load it on trailers.\nOn hot days, he appreciates the shade the round baler tractor offers. Those bales are larger and clearing a field is faster, but most of his customers can’t handle the larger sized bales.\nGeorge Clement and Cheryl Emerson of Shelbourne, NH come to the haying, too, loading their own trailer with 30 square bales of hay that they will use to feed their two horses. Their trailer is new and untested and George worries that they won’t make it through the river on the way out, but all goes well. On the next run, he says he’ll load the hay even higher, taking home 90 bales in all.\nSwain sells much of his hay to nearby Sunday River Ski Resort where they use it for construction projects. DiAnne Ward at Albany’s Deepwood Farm and others who own horses and cattle buy the rest of the hay.\nHe likes to have a barn full of hay for winter, too.\nCostly\nThe produce they sell from their gardens at Swain’s is more lucrative than the money made from haying.\n“To hay you have to keep so much equipment,” like their five transport trailers.\nRepairs are costly, too. “Twenty bucks a piece for those [tedder] teeth … My other rake broke apart, so that one’s new –$10,300 for a new rake.”\nSummer helper Kimball and his father expected to see a high tech operation since it had been several years since Josh worked at Swain Family Farm, but still in use are Swain’s father’s six 1950’s-era tractors.\nSwain had to lay off his mechanic last winter, so is the sole repairman now.\nBut for Swain, island farming overall is worthwhile because while floods and ice jams can be disruptive, he views the rich soil left behind as a boon, “They say it’s some of the most fertile land in the world.”\nJoin the Conversation\nPlease\n[sign into](#) your Press Herald account to participate in conversations below.

    "text": "EAGAN, Minn. — The Vikings on Wednesday announced they've agreed to terms with receiver Rondale Moore.\nThe 24-year-old is joining Minnesota after missing all of 2024 — his lone season with Atlanta — because of a knee injury suffered during a joint practice with Miami last August.\nThe Falcons acquired Moore by trading QB Desmond Ridder to the Arizona Cardinals in March 2024.\nMoore joined Arizona in 2021 as a second-round pick (49th overall) out of Purdue and quickly made an impact. He recorded four catches for 68 yards on five targets at Tennessee in Week 1 then exploded with seven catches for 114 yards, including a 77-yard touchdown from Kyler Murray in Week 2, when the Cardinals topped the Vikings 34-33.\nHe has totaled 135 receptions for 1,201 yards and three touchdowns on 182 targets. Fifty-one of Moore's receptions have resulted in first downs/touchdowns.\nListed at 5-foot-7, Moore's speed also has been implemented in the run game. He has rushed 52 times for 249 yards and one score.\nView photos of WR Rondale Moore who joined the Vikings during free agency.\nMoore was utilized as a rookie on special teams, as well. He returned 21 punts for 171 yards (8.1 avg.) and 13 kickoffs for 291 yards (22.4 avg.).\nA native of New Albany, Indiana, Moore finished his high school football career across the Ohio River at Trinity in Louisville, Kentucky. He earned 2017 Kentucky Gatorade Player of the Year honors and helped Trinity win a state title before attending Purdue.\nMoore won the Paul Hornung Award, which is presented to the nation's most versatile player, as a true freshman, when he racked up an FBS-best 114 receptions and led the Big Ten with 1,258 receiving yards and 12 receiving touchdowns in 2018. Moore added 213 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 21 rushes and returned 33 kickoffs and 12 punts that season on the way to consensus All-America, Big Ten Receiver of the Year and Freshman of the Year honors.\nA hamstring injury sidelined him for all but four games in 2019, and he only played three games in 2020.",

    "title": "'Unbelievable': Fury over Prebble's Waitangi Tribunal role | Otago Daily Times Online News",
    "text": "Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka said since leaving Parliament, Prebble has provided pro bono advice to various Māori trusts, hapū and iwi on a variety of issues. Prebble refused an invitation to be interviewed for RNZ's Morning Report programme today. However, Labour's Māori Development spokesperson Willie Jackson was scathing on the appointment. Jackson described it as \"unbelievable\" and \"a kick in the guts\" for Māori. \"I think we were all in shock [on Thursday] ... but what next - are we going to make Don Brash the new chair of the tribunal?,\" Jackson said. While Prebble had skills and experience as a lawyer working in the Māori sector, the most important factor was his alignment with the ACT Party and its policies, in particular the Treaty Principles Bill, Jackson said. Board members Derek Fox and Hana O'Regan who had a lot of experience in te ao Māori had been stood down with Prebble named as one replacement. He believed former prominent National politicians like Dame Jenny Shipley, Chris Finlayson or Sir Doug Graham would have been better choices from the right of the political spectrum. \"It's incredibly disappointing - it's not personal with 'Prebs', we all know him. I've worked with him on the Māori Affairs select committee but he represents a party and David Seymour.\" Jackson was adamant Prebble supported ACT's principles. \"I think that it's a real shock for Māori but it's virtue signalling from this government to ACT supporters. There's question marks now again over the prime minister.\" He said he was also disappointed Potaka had allowed Seymour and other coalition members \"to come over the top of him\". Comment has been requested from ACT leader David Seymour after Jackson's comments. Seymour on Thursday said Prebble was exactly the sort of person who should be on the tribunal. \"Richard is also an experienced lawyer, MP and company director, with an extensive knowledge of te ao Māori. \"ACT looks forward to his contributions in ensuring that the Treaty of Waitangi is interpreted and applied in a manner that reflects what it actually says, including the promise of the same rights and duties for all New Zealanders,\" Seymour said. Prebble would be joined on the tribunal by Ken Williamson; Kevin Prime was reappointed for a second term. Minister of Māori Development Tama Potaka on Thursday said the new appointments, including Prebble, would uphold the work done between the Crown and Māori. \"Waitangi Tribunal members bring with them a range of knowledge and skills and are appointed for their broad expertise in the matters that are likely to come before the Tribunal,\" Potaka said. \"Ensuring we have a range of talented appointees on tribunals and boards is absolutely key to the delivery of better public services.\"",

    "title": "UC San Diego Unveils New Funding Initiatives to Enhance Research Themes and Innovations",
    "text": "After nearly a year of intensive consultations, listening sessions and university-wide collaboration, UC San Diego has entered the final phase of its Strategic Plan Refresh process by announcing refreshed strategies and priorities that will guide UC San Diego’s long-term future. These strategies are grounded in our mission to transform California and a diverse society through education, generating and disseminating knowledge and creative works, providing high-quality health care and engaging in public service.\nFaculty, students and staff collaborated to identify 14 core strategies and refine six key research themes to further build out the refreshed plan framework and advance progress toward our seven distinct, yet interrelated, long-term plan goals.\nThe strategies, many of which were contributed by you, were designed to focus energy around how the university will commit and invest in achieving our goals.\nA series of workgroups were convened to evolve this work by identifying specific programs and initiatives that complement these strategies. Underpinned by our deeply held Principles of Community , commitment to our shared values, inclusivity and vision to be a destination public university that is student centered, research driven, patient dedicated and service oriented, these programs and initiatives will be shared and reviewed over the coming months as we finalize the plan. They are:\nStudent-facing support Educational innovation Integrated education Sense of belonging Research infrastructure Faculty and staff development Graduate education Administrative renewal Operational alignment Community-engaged problem solving Health and well-being Arts Green campus Campus activation These clear goals and strategies will enable us to collaborate more effectively across disciplines and areas of expertise; increase success in expanding access to education and professional development; and provide a road map for how we continue to evolve as a globally recognized public university developing a future workforce equipped to thrive and change the world.\nRefreshed Research Themes In addition to the new strategies, UC San Diego’s Office of Research and Innovation has unveiled six refreshed research themes that will guide and grow campus-wide research for the next decade. This element of the university’s ongoing strategic plan refresh will enhance the university’s research and discovery impact and foster ever-greater interdisciplinary innovation.\nEvolved and expanded from our first-ever strategic plan implemented in 2014 by Chancellor Khosla with input from more than 10,000 members of our campus community, the six refreshed and refocused research themes articulate the lenses through which we seek to advance knowledge and translate discovery to practice.\nThrough these themes, we individually and collaboratively strive to ask and address the key questions facing our world today and tomorrow.\n“These refreshed research themes represent a collective vision for the future of our university. They reflect the diverse expertise of our faculty and the unique challenges we aim to address,” said Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla. “I am confident that these themes will drive meaningful advancements and foster a collaborative spirit across our campus.”\nThe themes:\nAdvancing fundamental knowledge. Lead the conceptual, theoretical and experimental research that provides the foundation for furthering scientific, societal and creative discovery.\nUnderstanding cultures and addressing disparities in society. Improve our understanding of diverse cultures, perspectives and belief systems; examine how organizing structures, policies and practices contribute to historical and current inequalities; facilitate collaborative approaches and respectful engagement to tackle societal problems; and amplify the voices of marginalized populations.\nShaping and engaging with technology. Build the future of digital work, life and education; advance technological systems and materials to secure the power of computational solutions like artificial intelligence; translate computing progress to provide solutions to pressing social problems; and prevent negative consequences of new technologies while ensuring equitable access.\nConserving the planet and exploring the universe. Understand the evolving causes and impacts of climate change; develop solutions that improve environmental conditions to sustain our world and enhance environmental justice; and better understand the larger universe.\nStudying human knowledge, learning and creativity. I nvestigate the human brain; study the impact of history, arts, culture, and technology on how we think and act; and advance new models of education, knowledge and creativity.\nProducing breakthroughs in human health. I mprove human health; reduce health disparities; and advance affordable health systems that promote physical and mental health at the individual, interpersonal and community levels.\n“The themes are designed to be broad and inclusive, and we hope all of our areas of expertise see their role in engaging around these topics,” said Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation Corinne Peek-Asa. “With the help of the campus community we’ve identified areas in which UC San Diego is uniquely positioned to make a difference. The themes are meant to inspire and connect researchers across the university, creating a framework for support and funding that will catalyze and sustain academic and creative endeavors.”\nTo that end, the new research themes will be supported by several key initiatives, including a series of engagement and funding opportunities, that in coming years will provide more than $5 million in funding to support campus research efforts.\nNew Initiatives and Planned Activations “Our refreshed research themes are not just strategic priorities—they are a call to action for our entire academic community. We are launching several initiatives, including faculty ambassadors, various awards, and an innovation challenge to help catalyze and invigorate interdisciplinary collaboration and discussions, as well as support innovative solutions to pressing global issues,” said Chancellor Khosla.\nThe initiatives and estimated timelines for applications, requests for proposals and information are as follows:\n Faculty Ambassadors: Four faculty members will be selected to serve as ambassadors, connecting campus stakeholders with the new themesand promoting active discussion and engagement. Applications are open and will be accepted through October 22. The anticipated start date is December 1, 2024. The Call for Applications is available at https://ucsd.infoready4.com/#freeformCompetitionDetail/1952517 Faculty Ambassadors will be appointed for a 1-year term, renewable for up to 3 years, and will receive an annual discretionary funding supplement. Convene and Influence Awards: Small grants (typically up to $25,000) will be awarded to support grassroots convenings aimed at advancing thought leadership on the themes. Planned and led by interdisciplinary teams, these events must produce a dissemination product, such as a white paper or policy brief. Applications for the first round and open and will be accepted through November 8 for activity to begin early in 2025. The Request for Applications is available at: https://ucsd.infoready4.com/#freeformCompetitionDetail/1951851 Interdisciplinary Team Catalyst Awards: A new cycle of awards will focus on fostering interdisciplinary teams working on the refreshed themes. Projects will not focus on research or developing pilot data, but on building the expert teams needed to address the most pressing questions within the themes. Applications will open early in 2025 to enable awardees to start their team-building work in summer 2025. Innovation Challenge: This initiative will allow campus innovation accelerators to host events centered on the research themes. More to come The university will also launch a program to encourage ambitious projects similar to a Grand Challenge-style initiative. These large projects will be supported to seed complex, interdisciplinary proposals aimed at addressing major research questions and challenges.\nAdditionally, the university plans to issue a Request for Information (RFI) focused on “Core Facilities of the Future,” inviting researchers to contribute ideas on optimizing research infrastructure to best support the new themes.\nThe upcoming fall quarter will see the official rollout of these opportunities, and the university encourages feedback from the campus community as it continues to advance discussions on its strategic plan.",
