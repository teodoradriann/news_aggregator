    "title": "Este es el concentrador solar más grande jamás creado: 500 m² capaces de «desviar el Sol»",
    "text": "En plena transición energética, aparece el concentrador solar más grande jamás creado. Supone 500 m2 capaces de “desviar el Sol”. La energía fotovoltaica se ha convertido en una de las energías renovables más importantes del mundo, especialmente ahora que nos encontramos en un proceso crucial para dejar de lado los combustibles fósiles. El Sol puede contribuir en la generación de electricidad, pero no solo con paneles solares, sino también con la tecnología del concentrado solar .\nEste dispositivo aprovecha la intensidad de la luz emitida por el Sol a través de su concentración en un pequeño punto. Un proceso basado en el reflejo parecido al que sucede cuando se utiliza una lupa, pero llevado al extremo. El uso de esta tecnología consiente la obtención de calor, utilizado para levantar la temperatura en depósitos en los que queda almacenada el agua.\nEl empleo de esta tecnología logra que el líquido entre en ebullición, logrando vapor que mueve varias turbinas. Mediante un conjunto de procesos se logra electricidad sin emitir una sola partícula contaminante. Se distingue de un panel solar en que refleja haces de luz en la punta de una torre.\nEl concentrador solar más grande del mundo sorprende: 500 m2 dedicados al desvío del Sol El concentrador solar más grande del mundo tiene una medida de 500 metros cuadrados (superficie reflectante) y abastece de electricidad a un hospital. Está compuesto de aluminio pulido y posee 380 espejos hexagonales. La clave de su eficiencia radica en sus motores, que lo orientan hacia el sol con una precisión de 0,01º. Se denomina SG4 Big Dish y es un disco parabólico.\nSu disco mide 25 metros de diámetros y ha sido confeccionado con 380 espejos hexagonales orientados hacia una turbina de vapor.\nFue desarrollado por unos investigadores australianos y ofrece una reflectividad del 94% con la que consigue 150 kW de potencia, suficiente para suministrar electricidad a un hospital rural. Concentra la radiación en el punto focal frente al espejo y persigue la luz del Sol con un sistema avanzado de motores que lo orienta con la precisión mencionada de 0,01º.\nAdemás de los prototipos que existen en Australia , el año pasado se instaló un modelo SG4 al oeste de la India. Se hizo para abastecer de energía a un pequeño hospital y un centro de investigación. En instancias carentes de nubes, puede generar 400 kg de vapor por hora.\nEl concentrador solar más grande sorprende en Ashram Muni Seva en Gujarat Situado en Gujarat, India , el concentrador solar más grande jamás creado supone un avance revolucionario. La previsión es que pueda ofrecer vapor suficiente para cubrir el suministro eléctrico de varias locales del territorio. Se trata de un programa de investigación que dispone de cientos de paneles solares apuntando a una ubicación precisa.\nLa estructura actuará como sistema de esterilización y medio de almacenamiento de calor en forma de agua presurizada. Así podrá disfrutarse vapor de agua incluso pasadas varias horas sin reflejos solares.\nConcentrador solar: una manera diferente de aprovechar la energía del Sol El concentrador solar usa espejos o lentes para enfocar una importante cantidad de luz solar en un receptor pequeño que aprovecha el calor para la producción de vapor. Asimismo, da impulso a una turbina, que genera electricidad. Además de las torres solares y los discos parabólicos, son frecuentes los colectores cilindroparábolicos y los colectores de Fresnel , cuya luz se concentra en un tubo que pasa frente a los espejos.\nEsta tecnología ( concentrador solar ) no ha contado con el mismo respaldo que otras fuentes de energía renovables, pero este proyecto para aprovechar el Sol podría marcar la diferencia. Siguiendo esta misma línea, no puedes perderte lo que tenemos para contarte sobre el concentrador solar para uso residencial .",

    "text": "Massive California waves injure some onlookers and bring flooding, treacherous beach conditions up the West coast A powerful offshore storm is driving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and warnings of dangerous and damaging swells after several people were injured by a wave along Ventura beach on Thursday. Video above: Large Santa Cruz waves toss kids The wave crashed over a barrier along the southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away. Nearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said. High water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the U.S.-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said. Waves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected along the central coast. The dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said. The spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby. “Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned. At least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said. The conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast. Crews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about seven feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities. Hoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution. In central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office [issued ](https://www.facebook.com/SantaCruzSheriffsOffice/)an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, sister station [KSBW](https://www.ksbw.com/article/santa-cruz-flooding-and-evacuations/46243230) reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day. The most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday. Tempestuous waters are also battering Northern California, where the Bay Area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet, the weather service advised. A high wind alert is also in effect for the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected. Rainfall is likely to stretch northward from the Bay Area throughout the day Friday before shifting south into the weekend. Massive waves attract surfers to Mavericks Despite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco. Pro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having [some of the biggest waves](https://www.visithalfmoonbay.org/articles/mavericks-biggest-surf-west-coast) in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Local resident Ion Banner [told the affiliate](https://abc7news.com/mavericks-surf-ca-storm-waves-at-today-weather-half-moon-bay/14235785/) that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said. “The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.” Mavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells. The legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen. On Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco. “If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.” CNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Danish archaeologists find 4,000-year-old wooden circle like Stonehenge - The Jerusalem Post",
    "text": "Archaeologists in Denmark discovered a prehistoric circular structure resembling Stonehenge, estimated to date from the Late Neolithic period around 2000 BCE, during construction work for a housing estate in the town of Aars. On Monday, they began further excavations to determine the structure's lifespan and function. The site comprises a circle with a diameter of about 30 meters, formed by approximately 45 Neolithic-era wooden posts placed about two meters apart.\nThe discovery began with the finding of a rich settlement from the Early Bronze Age, dating between 1700 to 1500 BCE, including a remarkable grave containing a bronze sword, at the building site in Aars during construction work for a residential development.\n\"It is a once in a lifetime find,\" said Sidsel Wahlin, a conservationist at the Vesthimmerland Museum in Aars, according to The Straits Times. She described the circular structure as strongly resembling Stonehenge in England and added, \"The circle in Aars is the first one of this larger type that we can properly investigate.\"\n\"When my colleague and I opened a new part of the excavation, it turned out that the house and fence we wanted to uncover are the entrance to a very well-laid-out, slightly oval building,\" Wahlin explained, according to Dennik N .\nThe posts at the Danish site are arranged at intervals of about two meters, forming a circle that the archaeologists believe may have had a function. According to RTÉ, the archaeologists will also focus on the inner side of the circle to identify a possible smaller circle, following the British model.\n\"The circle points to a strong connection with the British henge world,\" Wahlin added. She said the next searches would seek to find if there were links between the region and other peoples, such as those who built Stonehenge.\n\"We are looking for ritual tools, such as flint arrowheads and daggers,\" she said, according to Dennik N.\n\"On the island of Bornholm, several small wooden circles have been discovered, which were considered sun temples due to the many stone sun discs found there,\" Wahlin stated.\nStonehenge in southern England comprises two circles of stones, believed to have been erected between 3100 BCE and 1600 BCE. The stones are aligned so that the rising sun shines exactly into the center of the circle at the summer and winter solstices.\nThe Danish site is dated to the end of the Neolithic period, about 4000 years ago, with the wooden circle estimated to date from about 2000 BCE. Archaeologists hope that further excavations will provide more insights into the structure's purpose and its possible connections to Stonehenge and other prehistoric sites.",

    "title": "Canada soccer coach suspended amid Olympic drone scandal: What we know",
    "text": "The Canadian Olympic Committee removed women's national team coach Bev Priestman at the 2024 Paris Olympics on Thursday amid stunning allegations of using drone surveillance to spy on the opposition. Two staff members — assistant Jasmine Mander and analyst Joseph Lombardi — were also sent home before Priestman was suspended by Canada Soccer for the tournament. It all marked a steep fallout after the Canadian website TSN reported Canada's men's and women's teams had used drones to spy on opponents for years. Canada, the reigning gold medalist, beat New Zealand 2-1 on Thursday in its Olympic opener. Priestman, Mander and Lombardi did not coach in the game. \"The Canadian Olympic Committee has removed the Canadian Women's National Soccer Team Head Coach Bev Priestman from the Canadian Olympic Team due to her suspension by Canada Soccer,\" the COC statement said. \"Assistant coach Andy Spence will lead the Women's National Soccer Team for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\" Here's what to know about the drone allegations: USWNT: 2024 Paris Olympics - Women's soccer group stage action USWNT: Team comes out swinging at Paris Olympics but leaves 'a lot of room for improvement' Canada drone surveillance surfaces at the Olympics According to TSN , Lombardi was caught by French police retrieving a drone that had been flying over the training facility for the New Zealand national team. French police investigated and found additional video of New Zealand's practices, as well as text messages between Lombardi and Mander indicating that Mander was aware of Lombardi's actions. Canada Olympic drone timeline, investigations It's unclear when the surveillance started. TSN reported it could trace back prior to a match against the United States on Nov. 15, 2019. The U.S. won the game, 4-1. The spying has been consistent ever since, according to the report published Thursday, with instances in 2021, '22 and '23. That includes the buildup to the 2021 CONCACAF match between the men's team and Honduras, which stopped practice in Toronto after noticing a drone flying overhead, the report said. \"I’d imagine there’s probably a lot of people in Canada that fly drones,\" John Herdman, then the coach of Canada's men's national team, said at the time. \"When a big team like Honduras turn up, I’m sure people are probably interested in what they’re doing when they come into our country,\" Herdman continued. \"So I know for sure we won’t be heading into people’s countries too early because with drones these days, people can obviously capture footage. You’ve got to be really careful.\" Jesse Marsch, current coach for the men's national team, was not implicated in the reporting. What Bev Priestman said about Canada drone scandal It wasn't immediately clear how much Priestman knew about the scandal. FIFA and Canada Soccer launched investigations into the spying allegations Wednesday. Canada Soccer intends to make its findings public. \"I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program,\" Priestman said Thursday in a statement, announcing the decision to voluntarily withdraw from coaching against New Zealand, prior to the COC decision. \"In the spirit of accountability, I do this with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld.\" When does Canada play next? Canada's next game is scheduled for Sunday, July 28 against France. Canada and France are both 1-0 in Group A play.",
