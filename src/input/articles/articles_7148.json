    "title": "\"The fire in him is good for Kumasi\" - John Darko backs Mayor's zeal",
    "text": "Suame Member of Parliament, John Darko, has weighed in on the recent controversies surrounding the new Mayor of Kumasi, expressing support for his ambition to clean up the city, but urging moderation in his approach.\nSpeaking on Channel One Newsroom on Wednesday, April 16, 2025, the MP commended the Mayor’s determination to restore order and cleanliness to the Ashanti regional capital.\n“Our city is in need of help – he mentioned that he wants to clean the city of Otumfuo. And I agree with him that our city needs to be cleaned up,” Darko said, adding “I think that it was out of overzealousness. I think that he will be spoken to. I don’t know him personally and I haven’t seen him, but I think that the fire in him is good for Kumasi.”\nThe Mayor, whose aggressive campaign to clear unauthorized structures and street hawkers has sparked both praise and criticism, came under fire after reports emerged of his alleged threats of using excessive force including flogging to clear the pavements and roadside of recalcitrant hawkers.\nWhile condemning any form of brutality, the Suame legislator stressed the importance of firm law enforcement guided by the Assembly’s regulations.\n“Yes, maybe we should advise him—flogging people is not the way to go—but we should enforce the Local Government Act and the bye-laws of the Assembly and make sure that he is able to deliver on his mandate,” Darko stated.\nHe also called for a non-partisan approach to urban management, urging Ghanaians to support mayors in carrying out their duties without political interference.\n“Let’s depoliticize these things and allow the mayors to work, and bring some sanity into our cities,” he added.\nThe comments come amid heightened public debate over the new Mayor’s leadership style, with some residents praising his decisiveness, while others raise concerns over human rights abuses.",

    "title": "Conservative think tank accuses Alabama programs and policies of religious discrimination",
    "text": "A new [report](https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/unconstitutional-religious-discrimination-state-programs.pdf) from the Manhattan Institute details state-level programs that it suggests violate the freedom of religion guaranteed under the First Amendment and named a handful of programs in Alabama. The report, titled “Unconstitutional Religious Discrimination Runs Rampant in State Programs,” was authored by Manhattan Institute fellows Nicole Stelle Garnett and Tim Rosenberger and released earlier this month. According to the report’s executive summary, recent U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) decisions “make clear that when the government adopts a program that extends public benefits to private organizations, the Free Exercise Clause prohibits it from excluding religious organizations from participating and from requiring them to secularize to participate.” Nevertheless, Garnett and Rosenberger insist that this rule has yet to be applied to many state policies nationwide. “Although the Court has made clear that the government cannot refuse to extend otherwise available public benefits to organizations because they are religious—or because they do religious things—many dozens, likely even hundreds, of public programs at all levels of government continue to do exactly that,” the authors explain. “This report collects and examines state-level programs that run afoul of the First Amendment’s nondiscrimination mandate.” Being among the [most religious states](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/02/29/how-religious-is-your-state/?state=alabama) in the country, it might be surprising to find Alabama listed in the report. However, the authors mentioned seven different policies in Alabama, which they argued were violations of religious freedom. First among these was the state’s pre-K program guidelines, which state that “Pre-K day may not be religious in nature” and forbid religious activities within the school day. According to the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education, qualified pre-K classrooms are funded through state grants. The report also cited Alabam’s Student Grant Program (ASGP), which can fund students at “sectarian” schools but only if the schools “perform essentially secular education functions.” According to the Alabama Commission on Higher Education (ACHE), ASGP participant schools include religious schools like Amridge University (Churches of Christ), Faulkner University (Churches of Christ), Birmingham Southern College (Methodist), Huntington College (Methodist), Miles College (Methodist), Samford (Baptist), the University of Mobile (Baptist), Oakwood University (Seventh-Day Adventist), Spring Hill College (Catholic) and Stillman College (Presbyterian). Nevertheless, the report claims public funds from the ASGP can’t be used for religious purposes and that participating universities are required “to carefully segregate funds to ensure that this rule is enforced.” Moreover, the report accuses Alabama’s Private College and Universities Facilities Authorities Act of restricting revenue bonds from financing facilities primarily used for religious worship and instruction, such as in connection with a school or department of divinity. Outside of education, the report pointed to regulations on family resource centers that require them to provide only services that are “community-based, nonsectarian and nondiscriminatory.” It said Alabama bars municipal special health care facility authorities from supporting facilities used for religious purposes. It also called into question Alabama’s Administrative Code for excluding religious activities from health and human care services under state employee combined charitable campaign programs. Finally, the report cited an Alabama law that excludes religious organizations from receiving funds from greyhound racing days. “The U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that the Free Exercise Clause protects the right of faith-based organizations to cooperate with governments to advance the common good in public programs—that the government is precluded from excluding them from participating, or requiring them to secularize in order to participate,” the report’s authors wrote. “Despite the Supreme Court’s admonitions, many state and local government programs continue to put unconstitutional restrictions and prohibitions on faith-based organizations.” “The programs highlighted in this report are likely only the tip of an unconstitutional iceberg,” they concluded. “We hope that our effort to shed light on the persistence of programmatic restrictions that run afoul of the principle established last year in Carson v. Makin will encourage policymakers to correct these constitutional errors expeditiously. Policymakers can start by correcting the programs discussed here, but that will be only the beginning.” To connect with the author of this story or to comment, email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#25524c49490b4749444e40495c65141d141c4b4052560b464a48) or find him on Don’t miss out!

    "text": "Protect Your Clothes From Monsoon Breeze Monsoon brings a refreshing change with its cool breezes and showers , but it also poses challenges for our wardrobe. Clothes can easily get damp, stained, and even develop unpleasant odours due to the increased humidity. To help you navigate this season without compromising your style, we've compiled a list of essential tips to protect your clothes from rain and humidity. Stay stylish and dry with these practical and effective solutions. Remember, Lifestyle Stores has you covered with the best monsoon fashion essentials . Opt for clothes made from quick-drying fabrics like polyester, nylon, or synthetic blends. These materials repel water better than natural fibres and dry faster, preventing mildew and damp odours. Avoid heavy fabrics like denim or wool, as they take longer to dry and can become heavy when wet. Quick-drying clothes are not only practical but also help you stay comfortable and stylish during unexpected showers. Polyester and nylon are excellent choices for monsoon fashion as they wick moisture away from the body, keeping you dry and comfortable. Synthetic blends often incorporate the best properties of multiple fabrics, providing both comfort and functionality. Another advantage of quick-drying fabrics is their lightweight nature, which adds to your comfort during humid days. Consider adding these fabrics to your wardrobe staples and enjoy the monsoon without worrying about your clothes. Invest in a high-quality waterproof jacket or raincoat . These outerwear pieces act as your first line of defence against the rain, keeping your inner layers dry. Look for features like adjustable hoods, sealed seams, and breathable materials to ensure maximum protection and comfort. A stylish raincoat from Lifestyle Stores can add a fashionable touch to your monsoon attire while keeping you dry and comfortable. Waterproof outerwear has evolved significantly in terms of design and technology. Modern raincoats and jackets are available in various styles, colours, and lengths, ensuring you find the perfect match for your style. Additionally, many waterproof outerwear pieces are designed with ventilation features, allowing air circulation and preventing overheating. Pair your raincoat with waterproof boots for a complete monsoon-ready look that combines practicality with style. Protect Your Clothes From Monsoon Breeze; Photo Credit: Pexels Always have a compact umbrella in your bag. It's a simple yet effective way to shield your clothes from sudden downpours. Choose an umbrella that is lightweight, easy to carry, and sturdy enough to withstand strong winds. With a reliable umbrella, you can venture out confidently without worrying about your clothes getting soaked. Compact umbrellas are a must-have accessory during the monsoon. Look for features like automatic open and close mechanisms, wind-resistant frames, and UV protection for added versatility. Many compact umbrellas come in stylish designs, allowing you to make a fashion statement even on rainy days. Keep an umbrella in your car, office, and handbag to ensure you're always prepared for unexpected showers. Treat your clothes and accessories with water-repellent sprays . These sprays create a protective layer that prevents water from soaking into the fabric. Apply the spray on your shoes, bags, and even your favourite jackets. This extra layer of protection can significantly extend the lifespan of your clothes and keep them looking fresh throughout the monsoon season. Water-repellent sprays are easy to use and can be applied to various materials, including leather, suede, and fabric. When using the spray, follow the manufacturer's instructions for optimal results. Regular application of water-repellent sprays ensures continuous protection, especially for items frequently exposed to rain. Incorporate this step into your monsoon care routine to maintain the quality and appearance of your wardrobe essentials. Protect Your Clothes From Monsoon Breeze; Photo Credit: Pexels Humidity can cause clothes to develop mould and unpleasant odours. Ensure your wardrobe is well-ventilated and use moisture-absorbing products like silica gel packets or activated charcoal to keep humidity levels in check. Additionally, store your clothes in breathable garment bags to allow air circulation and prevent musty smells. Proper storage is crucial for maintaining the freshness of your clothes during the monsoon. Invest in quality hangers, wardrobe dehumidifiers, and airtight containers for items prone to moisture damage. Keep your wardrobe doors slightly open to promote air circulation, and avoid overcrowding your closet. Regularly inspect and clean your wardrobe to prevent the buildup of dust and moisture, ensuring your clothes remain in pristine condition. White and light-coloured clothes are more prone to visible stains and watermarks . Opt for darker shades that can hide minor stains and dirt more effectively. Dark colours also tend to dry faster under the sun, reducing the risk of damp odours. Embrace rich, vibrant colours to brighten up the rainy days while keeping your clothes looking fresh. Monsoon fashion doesn't have to be dull. Experiment with deep hues like navy, burgundy, and forest green to add a pop of colour to your wardrobe. These colours not only hide stains but also exude a sophisticated and trendy vibe. Additionally, consider patterns and prints that can camouflage minor watermarks and stains, allowing you to stay stylish and confident during the rainy season. Protect Your Clothes From Monsoon Breeze; Photo Credit: Pexels Always dry your clothes thoroughly before storing them. Use a drying rack or hang clothes in a well-ventilated area to ensure complete drying. Avoid leaving damp clothes in a pile, as this can lead to mildew growth. Iron your clothes after drying to eliminate any remaining moisture and keep them crisp and fresh. Drying clothes can be challenging during the monsoon due to the high humidity levels. Consider using a dehumidifier or a fan to speed up the drying process. For delicate fabrics, use a cloth dryer with a gentle setting to avoid damage. Ensure that all clothes are completely dry before folding and storing them to prevent the growth of mould and mildew. Regularly check your stored clothes for any signs of dampness and take immediate action to dry them thoroughly. During the monsoon, it's essential to adopt specific laundry techniques . Use warm water for washing to help eliminate bacteria and fungi that thrive in humid conditions. Add a few drops of essential oils like lavender or tea tree oil to your rinse cycle to keep your clothes smelling fresh. Ensure you wash clothes more frequently to avoid the accumulation of sweat and moisture. Proper laundry care is crucial for maintaining the hygiene and freshness of your clothes during the monsoon. Use mild detergents and fabric conditioners that are gentle on fabrics and effective in removing odours. Avoid overloading your washing machine to ensure thorough cleaning and rinsing. After washing, give your clothes an extra rinse to remove any detergent residue, which can attract moisture and cause odours. Regularly clean your washing machine to prevent the buildup of mould and mildew, ensuring your clothes come out fresh and clean every time. Protect Your Clothes From Monsoon Breeze; Photo Credit: Pexels Leather and suede items require special care during the monsoon. Use a water-repellent spray specifically designed for these materials to protect them from water damage. Store leather and suede items in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and humidity. Regularly clean and condition these items to maintain their quality and longevity. Leather and suede accessories can elevate your monsoon style, but they require diligent care to withstand the elements. After applying the water-repellent spray, allow the items to dry completely before use. Use a soft cloth to wipe off any water droplets that may land on these items during rain. Regularly clean and condition leather and suede to keep them supple and prevent cracking. When not in use, store these items in dust bags or covers to protect them from moisture and dust. Heavy accessories can become cumbersome in the rain and may tarnish due to humidity. Choose minimalistic accessories that are easy to maintain and won't get damaged by water. Lightweight jewellery, waterproof watches, and simple bags are ideal choices. These accessories not only complement your monsoon outfits but also ensure you stay comfortable and hassle-free. Minimalistic accessories can enhance your monsoon look without adding bulk or discomfort. Choose jewellery made from materials like stainless steel, silicone, or resin, which are resistant to tarnishing and easy to clean. Waterproof watches are practical and stylish, offering both functionality and durability. Select bags made from water-resistant materials like nylon or synthetic leather , which can withstand the rain and protect your belongings. Keep your accessories simple and functional to enjoy the monsoon season with ease and style. Navigating the monsoon season doesn't mean compromising on style. With these essential tips, you can protect your clothes from rain and humidity, ensuring they remain fresh and fashionable. Embrace quick-drying fabrics, invest in waterproof outerwear, and use practical solutions like water-repellent sprays and proper storage techniques.

    "title": "Be afraid: someone's given the Ford Mustang Dark Horse a whopping 788bhp | Top Gear",
    "text": "Somebody out there has decided that the Ford Mustang Dark Horse – an already very powerful V8 performance car – is woefully underpowered. Weedy. Scrawny. Less pony car, more puny car.\nThat somebody has therefore given it a large injection of ‘watch this!’ to create what thine eyes have glazed over. It’s officially called the CS800DH, and it is the work of London-based car specialist Clive Sutton.\nYou know the name. That’s the chap responsible for any number of wildly overpowered Mustangs, and this one’s no different. Chiefly because Mr Sutton has fitted a giant 3.0-litre Whipple supercharger to the Dark Horse’s 5.0-litre V8 and turned everything up to 11.\\u0026nbsp;\nPower leaps tall buildings in a single bound, up from 447bhp to 788bhp – a 76 per cent increase for goodness sake! – while torque jumps up 61 per cent to 642lb ft. Naturally there’s a custom Borla cat-back exhaust to unleash Full Supercharged V8 Noise, along with a short-shifter for the manual gearbox, and lower, stiffer MagneRide suspension.\nIt’s also been driven through an ocean of carbon fibre and emerged with a new front splitter, side skirts, rear diffuser, new rear wing, bonnet and headlight surrounds all made out of the stuff. Slick wheels, too: a set of 20in bronzed Vossens wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport 4S rubber.\nInside, you’ll find special Recaros able to both heat and cool your terrified soul, some Alcantara, and a full retrim. You can of course choose whatever colour you desire for the leather and Alcantara.\nHence the price. Each CS800DH will cost from between £135,000-£165,000, though this price also adds a full Ford Performance and Clive Sutton three-year warranty. “Our customers love the Mustang and consistently turn to us to unleash its full performance capability,” said Sutton.\n“With 788bhp, the full Ford Performance warranty, a glorious supercharger whine and our bespoke exhaust, there’s nothing like the CS800DH Mustang.”",

    "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Billboard Chris locked out of X account after post calling out gay couple who ‘bought a baby’ via surrogacy | The Post Millennial | thepostmillennial.com",
    "text": "Billboard Chris sparked controversy this week when he posted an image of a gay couple cradling the newborn they allegedly obtained via [surrogacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNtJza7xDwY). \"They bought a baby who will never have her mom,\" he posted with the photo. \"You've lost a part of your soul if you think this is okay.\" After more than 10 million views, the post was reported for violating rules against private media and Chris was instructed to \"remove\" the tweet. Instead he appealed—and lost. The post had over 15,000 comments, and the image had been posted from an Instagram account. Chris said he would not delete the tweet. \"A lot of people tweeted it but they're not locked out,\" Chris told The Post Millennial. \"I upset a lot of gay people with my comment,\" he said. \"It's not anti-gay. It's pro-child, and many don't want to try to understand that.\" There has been a push among some LGBTQ+ groups to make the costs associated with surrogacy covered by health insurance. The argument is that since IVF is covered, surrogacy, which requires IVF treatments for the women undertaking the pregnancy of a child they will not mother, should also be covered as part of fertility treatment. [California](https://thepostmillennial.com/california-moves-to-provide-surrogates-to-gay-male-couples-in-the-name-of-fertility-equality)has already moved in that direction. The appeal was rejected, with X saying, \"Violating our rules against posing private media of an individual from a country with a recognized right to privacy law.\" The post is still up on other accounts. The photo was originally posted by an account called @narstar3, but was no longer available on that account after it was found to violate rules. There are countless Instagram accounts featuring gay dads and their surrogacy-obtained children. Accounts @MichaelAndMatt, @TwoMenAndASurrogacy, @2Dads2Twins_, are just a few. Articles have been written about how to \"find your Instagram Tribe\" with links to accounts for \"two dad families\", or \"Insta-dads: The Complete Guide to Gay Dads on Instagram.\" There are also accounts for men who have obtained children through surrogacy and are \"single dads by choice.\" Some of the dads have styled themselves as gay \"dad influencers\" who post pics of their kids and families from that special moment in the hospital when they take the baby from the birth mother, posing with the child on their chests, up through childhood. @2_Dallas_Dads, @Fontes_Four_Pack, @2Daddies2Babies, and @MyDosDads are a few of these. The practice of renting women and selling the children they carry has become controversial in recent years as the surrogacy industry, just a small part of the reproductive services industry, has blossomed and there are few legal constraints in the US to protect either mother or child during the 9+ months long transaction. In many European countries, like France, surrogacy is illegal, leading French gay dads to travel to the US to rent gestational bodies for the purpose of purchasing the offspring.

    "text": "A tree fell on a house on Route 1 in Scarborough on Thursday. Derek Davis/Portland Press Herald\nStrong winds battered much of Maine on Thursday, breaking tree branches, knocking down power lines and forcing at least one family out of their home.\nScarborough firefighters responded to a report of a large tree branch crashing through the roof of 689 Route 1 late Thursday morning. Three people were in the home at the time, but no injuries were reported, Deputy Chief John Brennan said.\nThe house has been posted against occupancy “out of an interest of safety,” Brennan said. He added that Central Maine Power disconnected the building’s electricity, as some outlets were ripped out of the wall.\n“There were spots you could see up through to the sky,” Brennan said. “It did actually take the majority of the chimney as well.”\nBrian Dobson, Scarborough’s code enforcement officer, places a condemned sign on the front door. Derek Davis/Portland Press Herald\nBrennan said the residents, who rent the home, are working with their landlord to find temporary accommodations while repairs are made. A licensed electrician will need to inspect and and fix the building’s wiring before electricity can be returned.\nThat was the only significant property damage in town, though there were about a half-dozen other reports of fallen branches and downed lines, Brennan said.\nCMP reported roughly 5,400 outages statewide around 4:45 p.m. — with most located in Cumberland, Oxford and York counties. Versant Power, which operates mainly in the northern part of the state, did not report any outages.\nWind speeds hovered between 25 and 30 miles per hour with occasional gusts of up to 50 miles per hour anticipated.\nSugarloaf Mountain closed several lifts due to wind conditions, and additional wind holds are possible Friday morning, staff announced in the mountain’s daily report.\nDeputy Chief John Brennan said that three people were in the house at 689 Route 1 in Scarborough when a tree fell on it, but no injuries were reported. Derek Davis/Portland Press Herald\nMichael Ekster, senior meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s office in Gray, said the strongest winds appeared to be in the southern Maine. The Portland Jetport reported peak gusts of 49 miles per hour; but Augusta saw top speeds of just 35 miles per hour, he said.\n“Right now, Portland looks like the highest,” Ekster said around 4 p.m., noting that a final tally would be available later in the week.\nMaine usually sees windy bursts like Thursday around three to four times a winter, Ekster said. Typically, winds between 40 and 50 miles per hour do relatively little damage to the landscape, though they can create more problems in the summer and fall, when the trees still have leaves on them, he said.\n“It’s worse when there’s leaves on the trees because they act like sails,” Ekster said. “ A lot of times, the wind just kind of sails through the branches.”\nThe wind is expected to die down overnight, coinciding with a drop in temperatures across the state. Ekster warned that windchills may dip into the negatives over the next few days, especially in inland and mountainous regions.\n“The winds are going to be a lot less (Friday), but it’s still going to be breezy,” Ekster said. “And that’s going to coincide with the coldest air of the season.”",
