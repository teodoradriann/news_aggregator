    "text": "Marshalls Is Selling a “Vintage-Inspired” $60 Comforter Set That Looks 3x the Price (It’ll Definitely Sell Out!)\nindependentlyselect these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.\nBedding is one of the most effortless ways to give your space a refresh. You don’t have to hang something on the wall or build a piece of furniture; you can simply drape a new quilt or comforter on top of your mattress and call it a day. I find that changing my bedding with the seasons — which is also necessary because my apartment’s temperature fluctuates with the weather — scratches that makeover itch. In fact, I just swapped my festive dark green quilt for a cottagecore-esque pink one, and it’s done wonders in brightening up my small studio.\nStill, I’m always on the lookout for new pieces, particularly budget-friendly ones since I like to switch it up so often. Marshalls is usually one of my first stops, and it just released a Valentine’s Day collection with so many adorable bedding pieces. The heart-printed quilt I found earlier this month already sold out, but there’s another gem that I can’t stop thinking about: this vintage-inspired comforter set. It incorporates an 18th-century trend that’ll give your space a romantic feel all year long — and for just $60, it includes everything you need to make up your bed!\nWhat Is the Rachel Zoe Valentine Toile Comforter Set?\nThis bedding set has it all: a printed comforter, standard-size shams, a decorative pillow, and a four-piece sheet set. That alone makes it worth the price, but its gorgeous look is what really takes it to the next level. In addition to the ruffle lace trim, its vintage appearance is rooted in the showstopping print. It might look familiar if you’re a fan of “Toile de Jouy” patterns like I am. It’s made a comeback in recent years in everything from wallpaper to dishware. Bedding, too, of course.\nUsually shortened as “toile,” this distinct pattern became popular in 18th-century France. One of its first major producers opened a toile factory in Jouy-en-Josas in the Île-de-France, which is where its longer name comes from. Usually, toile depicts a single-color pastoral scene on top of a plain white background, with complex details that draw the eye. The illustration themes can vary, though, like in the case of this Marshalls find. A pink floral graphic spreads across the included comforter, shams, and heart-shaped pillow.\nWhy You’ll Love the Rachel Zoe Valentine Toile Comforter Set\nAs soon as I saw this bedding set, my mind immediately went to LoveShackFancy, which frequently incorporates toile prints into its clothing and homeware. Thankfully, though it shares an ornate, vintage-inspired appearance, Marshalls’ version doesn’t include the hefty price. I would pay $60 for the comforter alone, so when you consider that it includes shams, a pillow, and sheets, it’s even more of a steal. With this single purchase, it’s a one-and-done, and your bed will look more put-together than ever.\nThough the print is bold, the soft and simple color scheme keeps it grounded. Plus, whereas many toile prints show more dense, complicated scenes, this one’s floral take is more versatile and light. Maximalism and vintage lovers, listen up: You’ll want to click the buy button before this set sells out like the heart quilt did! It was gone in days after I spotted it, so I’m calling it now that this set will likely share the same fate.\nBuy: Rachel Zoe Valentine Toile Comforter Set, Full/Queen, $59.99\nApartment Therapy's Home Runs\nGet full reviews of editor-favorite finds sent twice a week to your inbox.",

    "title": "Fact Check. Monumento em Guimarães foi destruído por “imigrantes muçulmanos”? – Observador",
    "text": "Também conhecido como Padrão D. João I, o Padrão de São Lázaro, em Guimarães, apareceu destruído no dia 30 de julho, pelas 22h, tendo havido logo quem começasse a publicar teorias sobre os responsáveis. Diversos utilizadores do Facebook partilharam que os moradores de freguesia de Creixomil teriam “fortes indícios” de que teriam sido “imigrantes muçulmanos” a cometer tal ato, abrindo a possibilidade de se tratar de um crime com motivação religiosa e “racista”.\n“Cruz de Cristo do Padrão de São Lázaro foi vandalizado e totalmente destruído. A população local, tem fortes indícios que o ato criminoso, de ódio e racismo, foi realizado por imigrantes muçulmanos”, refere uma das publicações, acompanhada por imagens verídicas dos fragmentos do monumento.\nÉ preciso começar por explicar que antes de esta tese começar a circular já tinham sido partilhadas informações a dar conta de que os responsáveis seriam um “grupo de indivíduos indostânicos” — ou seja, provenientes de países como Índia e Paquistão —, o que já tinha sido verificado pelo Observador.\nPUB • CONTINUE A LER A SEGUIR\nFact Check. Padrão de S. Lázaro, em Guimarães, foi destruído por um grupo de indostânicos?\nNeste caso, faz-se apenas uma referência à religião dos alegados responsáveis e ao detalhe de serem imigrantes em Portugal. Será esta mais recente alegação verdadeira?\nAo Observador, a PSP garantiu que quando chegou ao local encontrou o Padrão de São Lázaro destruído e que não tem qualquer indício ou suspeita de que se tratou de um ataque levado a cabo por um determinado grupo de pessoas. Os agentes também não recolheram qualquer testemunho de moradores que aponte para a presença de imigrantes no local. O presidente da Junta de Freguesia de Creixomil, António Gonçalves (PSD), explicou igualmente ao Observador que não fazem sentido as teorias que estão a circular nas redes sociais: “Isso não tem qualquer fundamento, nem muito nem pouco. Tudo o que se possa dizer é especulativo. Estive lá no local ouvi os testemunhos reais. Aquando da queda, quem ouviu o som veio cá fora e não viu coisa nenhuma.”\n“Deduz-se que eventualmente possa haver, não um vandalismo premeditado, mas que estivessem lá miúdos. E, como há lá um bar à beira, poderiam eventualmente ter bebido uns copos e ter-se encostado. Mas agora as peritagens estão a ser feitas pelos técnicos competentes e depois vai obter-se alguma informação. Não faz qualquer sentido o que se anda para aí dizer”, acrescentou o presidente da junta de Creixomil.\nDepois de ter partilhado na sua página de Facebook que o “património cultural de Guimarães na freguesia de Creixomil ficou mais pobre”, a Junta de Freguesia de Creixomil reagiu a alguns comentários com alegações falsas, alertando a população para que não se precipitasse nos julgamentos: “Caros cidadãos, vamos ter calma e deixar as autoridades fazer o seu trabalho. Depois disso tiramos a devidas conclusões. Não devemos fazer justiça sem conhecer os verdadeiros factos.”\nA investigação passou agora para a alçada da Polícia Judiciária. Da parte do Governo, o Ministério da Cultura já lamentou o que aconteceu em Guimarães, dizendo em comunicado que, “face à gravidade da situação, o Património Cultural/Instituto Público operacionalizou a deslocação de uma equipa técnica a Guimarães, no sentido de avaliar, não apenas os danos materiais causados ao cruzeiro derrubado e fragmentado, mas também para diligenciar sobre as condições da sua recuperação e ponderar estratégias futuras de salvaguarda”.\nConclusão\nNo final do último mês o Padrão D. João I, também conhecido como Padrão de São Lázaro, foi encontrado destruído. Várias publicações têm sugerido ter sido um grupo de “imigrantes muçulmanos” a levar a cabo um ataque contra aquele património. Mas, até ao momento, as autoridades não têm qualquer evidência que aponte nesse sentido, nem sequer recolheram testemunhos de moradores a dar conta da presença de estrangeiros no local no momento em que tudo aconteceu. Além disso, a Junta de Freguesia não descarta a hipótese de um acidente. “Deduz-se que eventualmente possa haver, não um vandalismo premeditado, mas que estivessem lá miúdos. E, como há lá um bar à beira, poderiam eventualmente ter bebido uns copos e ter-se encostado”, explica o presidente da junta ao Observador, sublinhando que, neste momento, “tudo o que se possa dizer é especulativo”. Esta não é a primeira alegação falsa a circular nas redes sociais sobre este caso. Anteriormente, outros utilizadores tinham partilhado que os responsáveis seriam indostânicos.\nAssim, de acordo com o sistema de classificação do Observador, este conteúdo é:\nERRADO\nNo sistema de classificação do Facebook este conteúdo é:\nFALSO : as principais alegações do conteúdo são factualmente imprecisas. Geralmente, esta opção corresponde às classificações “falso” ou “maioritariamente falso” nos sites de verificadores de factos.\nNOTA: este conteúdo foi selecionado pelo Observador no âmbito de uma parceria de fact checking com o Facebook.\n Campanha de verão Assine por 0,70€ /semana Ver ofertas Oferta limitada Para continuar a ler assine o Observador Assine o Observador a partir de 0,18€/ dia Ver planos Oferta limitada\nJá é assinante?
