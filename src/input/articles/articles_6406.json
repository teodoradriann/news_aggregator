    "text": "Temperatures to plummet over New Year’s weekend\nNew Year’s weekend revellers will need to wrap up as strong winds, heavy rain and even ice and frost are set to make travel conditions potentially challenging.\nMet Éireann said the first week of 2024 also looks likely to prove quite unsettled as a low-pressure weather front will bring blustery conditions with rainfall expected to be well above early January norms.\nDespite the unsettled weather expected for the weekend, there will be patches of bright sunshine at times, but those attending outdoor New Year’s Eve celebrations are urged to dress warmly.\nTemperatures will drop by six degrees overnight, with frost, ice and possibly snow on higher ground over the weekend.\nThe good news is that calmer weather is expected from January 8 thanks to a high-pressure front arriving in the Atlantic, although there will still be some showers around.\nA status orange alert was lifted from four southern and western counties, providing some relief for local authorities that gust-related damage was not as severe as initially feared.\nBoth Cork County Council and Kerry County Council said there was no serious property or infrastructure damage in the wake of Storm Gerrit.\nMet Éireann said there was the potential for very challenging driving conditions over the next 24 hours.\n“Friday will be rather windy for a time, with some sunshine and scattered showers,” a spokesperson said.\n“The showers won’t be as widespread as Wednesday, Thursday. However, rain will continue in parts of the north and the north-west, some of it heavy, with a chance of localised flooding.\n“Showers will persist through Friday night and rain will spread from the north-east overnight with the potential for some areas of higher ground to get sleet or even snow.\n“Temperatures will sink to as low as minus 2C or even minus 3C in some areas. Saturday will be windy or very windy with rain clearing to sunny spells and scattered showers.”\nMet Éireann said winds would ease over tomorrow night, although showers would persist in many areas.\nSome areas – particularly those on higher ground – could see frost and ice.\n“Sunday will probably be a breezy and chilly day with scattered showers and moderate to fresh north-west winds and highest temperatures of 5C to 8C,” the spokesperson added.",

    "text": "ACH Warriors celebrate accomplishments at commencement\nCOULEE CITY – Last Saturday marked the end of an era at Almira/Coulee-Hartline High School for the Class of 2025 as they graduated from high school and head into their futures.\n“We gather not just to celebrate accomplishments, but to recognize the journey, the growth and the spirit of perseverance that brought each one of the graduates here today,” said senior class Vice President William Allsbrook.\nACH High School principal Kelley Boyd said this year’s theme for her words of wisdom speech to the Class of 2025 came from a conversation with the class valedictorian on self-motivation that spread around the class as a running joke.\n“Safe to say motivation was really never in question, but the more I thought about it the more I realized, this whole class has shown us what true self-motivation looks like,” she said. “Every single one of you sitting here today has faced your own set of barriers, any yet you showed up, you put in the work, and you got here.”\nThe class valedictorian, Grayson Beal, thanked all the staff, parents and anyone else involved in their support in getting the Class of 2025 where they needed to be, giving a special thanks to Boyd and Jennifer Goetz for their efforts in getting each of them onto the graduation stage.\nBeal said his love for playing sports in high school was his greatest motivation for showing up and aiming to excel in the classroom.\n“As most people here in attendance know, we came up just short multiple times,” said Beal. “In the past, I thought that would be devastating, but over the course of these not-so-storybook endings, I realized that is not the case. While sports were amazing and a great time of my life, they were only a small portion. I have so much left in store, so much more to achieve when sports are over for me.”\nBeal moved to the area in eighth grade from Everett and said it was a big change moving into a smaller community.\n“It was a new sense of community and really shaped me into who I am and I’m so grateful for it,” he said.\nAssociated Student Body President Emma Whitaker and ASB Treasurer Carter Pitts shared the honor of giving the Salutatorian speech as they both earned the title this year.\n“I couldn’t be more grateful to share this with one of my closest friends,” said Whitaker.\nThe two said that one of the greatest parts of their high school experience was the time they got to spend with their classmates. Everyone in the Class of 2025 pushed each other toward success and supported one another through everything.\n“Our class dynamic is one of the most diverse, but also one of the most united,” said Pitts.\nDuring the ceremony, the class took a moment to honor the memory of their classmate, Blake Wallace-Alberto Escalera, who passed away last fall. Boyd said that Escalera had a major impact on the lives of all the students who attended the school throughout his time there and participated in school activities in any way that he could.\n“He just was a fun kid to have around,” said Boyd. “He always had some health things, and we were really hoping that he would be here today.”\nACH senior class president Jeremy Pinar gave the farewell speech for the ceremony, where he reminisced on the journey that brought them all to this point.\n“I’ve gone through my entire K-12 education in the same ACH school system, I’ve lived in the same house outside of Almira my whole life, I know nothing but the feeling of growing up in a small, close-knit community,” said Pinar. “Yet I can wholeheartedly say that I would never trade it for anything else.”",

We are immensely encouraged by the new demand surfacing from tier 4 and beyond and will continue to serve these markets in the best possible manner,” said Raju Pullan, Senior Vice President and Head at Samsung India.\nPrimarily, the design aesthetics of the new Galaxy Z Fold7 – in a sleek, lightweight form factor – have drawn significant interest. The new colours, flagship processing power, along with Galaxy AI have further sweetened the experience for consumers, he added.\nThe company said it is witnessing unprecedented demand for the Galaxy Z Fold7, with the smartphone being ‘out-of-stock’ in select markets across the country.\nThe company is taking necessary steps at its manufacturing factory in Noida to meet the unprecedented demand.\nSamsung India had earlier announced that it has received a record 210,000 pre-orders for its seventh generation foldables - Galaxy Z Fold7, Galaxy ZFlip7 and Galaxy Z Flip7 FE – in just 48 hours in India - signalling rapid mainstreaming of the foldable form factor in India.\n“We are working overtime to ensure adequate supplies of our most advanced smartphone, to enable customers to enjoy the Galaxy Z Fold7 at the earliest. The strong demand is coming from both retail markets and online platforms,” said Pullan.\nGalaxy Z Fold7, in its thinnest and lightest design to date, weighs just 215 grams - even lighter than Galaxy S25 Ultra. It is just 8.9 mm thick when folded and 4.2 mm thick when unfolded, according to the company.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",

    "text": "Buzz around sustainability has been growing on the University of Iowa’s campus. From new initiatives to lively discussions, it seems like sustainability is everywhere — and for good reason.\nAt its core, sustainability is about meeting today’s needs without compromising the environment for future generations. It used to be a niche concern, but now it’s a central focus in education and university policies.\nAs the UI embraces sustainable practices, we have the opportunity not just to learn about sustainability, but to actively participate in it.\nLet’s face it: Climate change is impacting us all, even here in Iowa. We’re experiencing rising temperatures and more intense storms, which threaten our agriculture, infrastructure, and public health.\nAccording to the Iowa Climate Assessment , “In the last three decades, Iowa weather has become more extreme in many ways,” going on to list the various manifestations of climate change in the state.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made it clear we’re running out of time to address these issues. Its AR6 Synthesis Report: Climate Change 2023 emphasizes the urgent need for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to ensure a livable future.\nThis is not just about saving polar bears or melting ice caps — it’s about our well-being and the health of our planet.\nHere’s the good news: Each of us has the power to create change through our daily choices. Just saving 1 ton of cardboard boxes from entering the landfill prevents almost 4 tons of CO2 emissions. While this sounds like a lot, students would only need to recycle 100 to 150 standard-sized cardboard boxes to reach 1 ton.\nImagine if every student committed to practices like these. We could collectively reduce our carbon footprint and create a healthier campus environment.\nThe UI is already making strides toward sustainability. The Sustainable Campus Action Plan aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions and enhance campus biodiversity, showcasing our commitment to reducing environmental impact.\nCampus-wide landscaping efforts also contribute to sustainability, while initiatives like the UI Student Garden and student-led programs such as Net Impact foster student collaboration and innovative solutions.\nAdditionally, the UI is incorporating sustainable practices across the campus. The Cambus fleet, for example, has adopted biodiesel and electric buses from a $16 million grant, reducing its carbon footprint.\nWhat’s in it for you? Well, sustainable practices can improve our well-being.\nAs energy costs rise, adopting sustainable practices can lead to significant savings for the university, potentially freeing up resources for academic programs and student services.\nYou might be thinking, “Do we really need to focus on sustainability? Isn’t it just another trend?” This skepticism is understandable but ignoring sustainability can lead to more significant costs down the road.\nIn Iowa, climate-related disasters , such as increased flooding and intense storms, have already disrupted communities and impacted public health. These events, much like Hurricane Helene, demonstrate how such events lead to widespread damage and stress, displacing communities and causing long-term psychological effects.\nThe cost of climate-related disasters in the U.S. is sitting at $92.9 billion and steadily rising with billions spent annually on recovery efforts. Investing in sustainable practices today not only helps mitigate these disasters but also ensures a more stable and healthy future for our campus community, reducing long-term costs and environmental harm.\nAwareness is crucial, and events like Sustainability Week aim to engage students and promote participation. However, we need more active involvement from the student body.\nOur sustainability efforts must be inclusive, ensuring that varied voices — especially from marginalized communities — are heard in decision-making processes. Marginalized groups are often disproportionately affected by environmental issues but have less access to sustainability resources and initiatives.\nResearch from The Race Report found that 4.8 percent of environmental professionals identify as Black, Asian, or minority ethnic, compared with a 12.6 percent average across all professions. The university has a responsibility to create an environment where all students can contribute to these initiatives, fostering equitable access to resources and opportunities, and encouraging more diverse students to pursue careers in environmental professions.\nImagine walking through the UI campus filled with clean air, lush green spaces, and thriving ecosystems. This vision is within reach, but it requires all of us to step up today.\nAs we navigate our educational journeys, let’s not allow fear or despair to hold us back. Every action counts. Every voice matters.\nThe time to act is now. For ourselves. For our university. For our planet.",
