    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Planet Labs PBC (NYSE:PL), a leading provider of daily Earth data and insights, announced today that its first hyperspectral satellite, Tanager-1”made possible by the Carbon Mapper Coalition and its philanthropic partners”is ready for launch. The spacecraft arrived at Vandenberg Space Force Base on June 3rd in preparation for liftoff as early as July on board the Transporter-11 Rideshare mission with SpaceX. Tanager-1 will be the first of a next-generation hyperspectral fleet which will expand Planet's imaging capabilities in the spectral domain to complement the existing imaging capabilities in the temporal and spatial domains offered by the PlanetScope, SkySat, and Pelican missions.\nThis press release features multimedia.

(Photo: Business Wire)\nFollowing on-orbit commissioning, Tanager-1 is planned to provide hyperspectral data both in support of the continued partnership with nonprofit organization Carbon Mapper and Planet's broader commercial mission. Tanager-1 was enabled by the Carbon Mapper satellite program, which allowed Planet to combine its cutting-edge agile aerospace and smallsat bus technology with the state-of-the-art imaging spectrometer design developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This collaboration plans to provide scientific-grade data to enable action on sustainability use cases such as greenhouse gas point-source emissions.\nThis important collaboration with Planet and Carbon Mapper is an innovative way to confront Earth's most urgent climate challenges head-on, said Laurie Leshin, Director of NASA JPL. Our imaging spectrometer technology and expertise, leveraged and deployed on Tanager-1, will enable a broad range of stakeholders to pinpoint methane super-emitters and take action to mitigate them. The work of the Carbon Mapper Coalition will truly have a global impact, and we are proud to take part in ensuring mission success.\nFuture Tanager imagery will be analyzed by expert scientists at Carbon Mapper to identify methane and carbon dioxide (CO2) \"super-emitters\" around the world. Planet expects to provide commercial hyperspectral data for a variety of use cases including emissions monitoring, biodiversity assessments, vegetation analysis, minerals mapping, and water contaminant assessments.\nI'm thrilled that Tanager has arrived at the launch site. This will provide hyperspectral data that will enable myriad applications from sustainability to security, and complement the data from existing Planet satellite fleets, said Will Marshall, Co-Founder and CEO of Planet. I am very proud to be a part of this unique public-private partnership with NASA JPL and Carbon Mapper.\nPlanet's hyperspectral constellation is designed to provide imagery with continuous spectral information across the visible and shortwave infrared (VSWIR) regions. Tanager's imaging spectrometer leverages JPL's heritage in imaging spectrometer design and development through decades of similar airborne and spaceborne sensors like the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT). The Tanager-1 imaging spectrometer will be the most complex optical system ever launched by Planet, and its delivery to the launch site demonstrates a host of new capabilities, expertise, facilities, and testing acumen at Planet.\nIn recent months, the integrated Tanager-1 spacecraft successfully completed a rigorous series of on-the-ground tests designed to ensure that the integrated satellite can withstand the harsh environments that it will endure at launch and in orbit. Pelican-1, a technology demonstration that successfully launched late last year, shares the same smallsat bus platform with Tanager-1. Together, the successful on-the-ground and in-orbit tests have proven Planet's agile aerospace approach as applied to the larger and more complicated spacecraft that utilize this next-generation smallsat bus.\nShipping the first Tanager satellite is an enormous step in realizing the vision of our unique public-private partnership with Carbon Mapper and NASA JPL, said Mark Keremedjiev, Tanager Mission Director at Planet. This milestone in our program is a shared achievement across a wide range of contributors and I am exceptionally proud of the team that has brought us to this point. I am excited to see the data our system will produce on-orbit and look forward to tackling the host of challenges spaceborne hyperspectral remote sensing is suited to address.\nIn addition to Tanager-1, Planet will be launching 35 SuperDoves that will contribute to Planet's flagship daily, global monitoring mission. PlanetScope data is used by hundreds of customers in defense and intelligence, civil government, and commercial markets to take informed action, and better contextualize events they're seeing on the ground today.

    "text": "SCARBOROUGH, Maine — A longtime packaging plant in Scarborough will shut its doors in the coming months, affecting 67 workers who currently report there each day.\nThe facility, known as RTS Packaging, is owned by Sonoco Products Company, which announced the closure amid economic challenges. The plant has been part of the Scarborough community since the 1980s and became part of Sonoco’s portfolio in 1997.\nThe company says the decision stems from economic pressures, including inflation and sluggish sales in the folding carton market.\n\"We understand the impact this closure may have, and are committed to ensuring a smooth transition for the plant, our employees, and other affected parties,\" Interim Head of Investor Relations Roger Schrum said in an email.\nSchrum added that Sonoco plans to provide support and more detailed guidance to employees in the coming weeks. Workers will also have the option to apply for positions at other Sonoco locations across the East Coast, where openings are available.\nOne employee who spoke to NEWS CENTER Maine expressed uncertainty about his future. He said he had hoped to retire from the plant, but now faces a difficult and unexpected transition. He asked to remain anonymous, fearing his severance package could be impacted.\nRELATED: Health and Human Services will lay off 10,000 workers and close agencies in a major restructuring",

    "title": "State Department sees success with Narcan, Fentanyl test strip vending machines",
    "text": "TULSA, Okla. — In just two years, the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services has put more than 420,000 doses of Naloxone in the hands of Oklahomans. That was just through a free online order service. Since beginning their rollout of live-saving vending machines in July, they have dispersed an additional 14,000 boxes of the medication that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. Out of 40 in total, 22 of these life-saving vending machines have been strategically placed throughout the state at places like libraries, college campuses, travel stops and the Tulsa Day Center. Bonnie Campo, Senior Director of PR at ODMHSAS, said while it's a huge milestone, it's hard to celebrate something like this. \"In the state of Oklahoma we see about a thousand opioid-related overdose deaths each year, and that number have to come down,\" said Campo. \"Were seeing Fentanyl laced in everything and because it’s so potent, and people don’t have a tolerance, it’s causing some of those accidental overdoses that were seeing.\" Fentanyl test strips are also available free of charge in these machines. Naloxone, also known as Narcan, retails at about $45 at a general drug store. To be able to supply the community with the medication for free is a game changer, Campo said, especially for those who may not otherwise be able to afford it. \"[For] direct consumers out in the streets of Oklahoma, the vending machines were huge because people that weren’t ordering online were seeing these in their communities and it was becoming very normalized,\" said Campo. \"That was very important to help get rid of the stigma associated with asking for help and helping people enter treatment.\" The first of the 22 was placed at the Tulsa Day Center. Narcan was something they knew was needed, said COO Noe Rodriguez, but the accessibility of the resource has been a huge benefit to the 250-300 clients they see daily. \"They don’t have to ask staff, they don’t have to go to our clinic, they can just go to the vending machine, get what they need and leave,\" said Rodriguez. \"The vending machine has been a huge resource to us, to our clients.\" Rodriguez said with the stigma surrounding things like homelessness, addiction and treatment, to have something so accessible for the Day Center's clients to utilize without fear of judgment is important. Each box of Naloxone has two doses in it and there are 100 boxes in each machine. Campo said they have to restock the vending machines almost every day. \"It has been wonderfully challenging to see that Oklahomans are participating in this,\" said Campo. \"Maybe it’s not today that they need the Naloxone, but it’s good for three years, and so we just want this to be a part of everyone’s first aid kit.\" The remainder of the machines will be placed in other high-volume areas in the new year.

    "text": "Qatar’s Nasser Saleh al-Attiyah and his French co-driver Edouard Boulanger are the new leaders of the Rally-Raid Portugal. The Prodrive Hunter crew fended off a fierce challenge from Overdrive Racing’s Yazeed al-Rajhi to carve out a narrow advantage of 20 seconds after the second day of frantic competition across muddy, slippery and extremely demanding tracks in rural Portugal.\nThe stage win gave al-Attiyah valuable five points for the FIA World Rally-Raid Championship (W2RC) and enabled him to close to within seven of Carlos Sainz in the virtual overall rankings.\nThe Qatari ace said: “It’s good to win the stage. I’m happy. We were a little cautious because it’s a new race for everyone and it’s easy to make mistakes. We have to go stage-by-stage and accumulate points every day for the championship.”\nAl-Rajhi and Timo Gottschalk were the first crew to finish the day’s stage and the third quickest time sees the Saudi maintain second place. Al-Rajhi said: “We opened the road after the (Guerlain) Chicherit crash, around km30. We did our best and Timo (Gottschalk) did a great job. I think it went well.”\nPersistent fog forced race officials to delay the start of the second selective section (SS3) by 45 minutes for car competitors. Crews then tackled a stage of 166.29km.\nSaood Variawa and his French co-driver François Cazalet started strongly and were the quickest to the 98km checkpoint. The South African lost a little time in the latter kilometres but held on to snatch the outright lead for the first time on a W2RC event. His delight was short-lived, however: he was awarded a 30-minute time penalty soon after the stage finished and plummeted out of contention.\nCarlos Sainz and his co-driver Alex Haro remain firmly in the hunt for victory in the first of the X-Raid Mini JCW Rally Plus machines. The four-time Dakar winner was fifth quickest on the day and occupies third overall. Sainz said: “Everything went smoothly. The car is impeccable and the stage was quite technical, with muddy and narrow parts – typical of Portugal.”\nOvernight leader Guerlain Chicherit stopped on two occasions early in the stage with technical issues after an accident and was passed by his main rivals. But the second stoppage after 79km was terminal for his stage ambitions and the Frenchman was forced to abandon the track and head back to the bivouac with a fistful of time penalties to follow.\nHis Overdrive Racing teammate Guillaume De Mevius had suffered mechanical woes on Wednesday but the Belgian’s misery was compounded when he damaged his Toyota Hilux in an accident after 48km. Any ambitions of remaining in contention for top W2RC points were ruined.\nJoao Ferreira and Filipe Palmeiro delivered a potent stage performance in their X-Raid JCW Rally Plus and moved up to fourth in the Ultimate category rankings with the fourth quickest time.\nThe Portuguese said: “Difficult. The first part of the special was very slippery with a lot of mud. After neutralisation, in the second part, the surface was drier and we were able to have more fun. Fourth place overall, for now. It doesn’t look bad to me.”\nSebastien Loeb belied his lack of experience in the Challenger category and delivered a menacing performance in his Taurus T3M with co-driver Fabian Lurquin. The two-time winner of the WRC Rally of Portugal started the stage 27th on the road and overhauled all his Challenger rivals with the second quickest time behind al-Attiyah. He moved up to fifth overall and first in class – 3min 54sec ahead of the seventh-placed Portuguese duo of Joao Dias and João Miranda in their Santag Racing Can-Am Maverick X3.\nLoeb said: “We were always on the attack. We did our best with the car we have. It really went all out. It wasn’t possible to do much more.”\nToyota Gazoo Racing’s Lucas Moraes and Spanish co-driver Armand Monleón hold sixth overall and Lithuania’s Vaidotas Zala and his local navigator Paulo Fiúza are eighth in the third of the Mini JCW Rally Plus machines built by X-Raid.\nAlexandre Pinto is third in Challenger and ninth overall in his Can-Am and Marcus Baumgart rounds off the top 10 in the second of the Prodrive-built Hunters after setting the sixth quickest time on the day’s stage.\nHis brother Cristian holds 11th in the third Hunter, the Challenger duo of Nicolas Cavigliasso and Armindo Araújo are 12th and 13th and local championship contender Joao Ramos and Overdrive Racing’s Juan Cruz Yacopini complete the top 15. Cavigliasso is the highest-placed of the W2RC registered drivers in the Challenger section.\n[Sports](/sports)\nAl-Attiyah wins second stage to seize lead in Portugal\n‘It’s good to win the stage. I’m happy. We were a little cautious because it’s a new race for everyone’\nNasser Saleh al-Attiyah and his co-driver Edouard Boulanger (left) pose with their medals after winning the second stage at the Rally-Raid Portugal on Thursday.\nNasser Saleh al-Attiyah in action on Thursday.",

    "text": "As Donald Trump faces a quartet of indictments on top of a civil fraud trial that could strip him of his businesses, the embattled former president is back on the ballot in Colorado .\nThe Colorado Republican Party on Wednesday appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court in a bid to overturn the Colorado Supreme Court’s Dec. 19 ruling that “found by clear and convincing evidence that President Trump engaged in insurrection” on Jan. 6, 2021, thus declaring him ineligible to hold office under the U.S. Constitution’s insurrection clause . Trump would be stricken from the state’s 2024 presidential primary ballot, the court ruled, simultaneously staying the decision until Jan. 4 in the event of a GOP appeal.\nIn their appeal, Republican Party lawyers argued that the Colorado Supreme Court showed “unprecedented disregard” for the First Amendment rights of political parties and voters to pick a candidate of their choosing.\nOn Thursday, Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold’s office issued a statement, saying, “With the appeal filed, Donald Trump will be included as a candidate on Colorado’s 2024 Presidential Primary Ballot when certification occurs on January 5, 2024, unless the U.S. Supreme Court declines to take the case or otherwise affirms the Colorado Supreme Court ruling.”\nIn a comment provided by her spokesman, Griswold emphasized her support for the original ban, a 4-3 ruling, to stand.\n“Donald Trump engaged in insurrection and was disqualified under the Constitution from the Colorado Ballot,” Griswold said. “The Colorado Supreme Court got it right. This decision is now being appealed. I urge the U.S. Supreme Court to act quickly given the upcoming presidential primary election.”\nSection 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment was added following the Civil War, and was intended to block members of the Confederacy from returning to power. Legal theorists have been split on whether or not Trump should be disqualified, hinging primarily on whether or not he was “an officer of the United States” while serving as president. The U.S. Supreme Court has never before ruled on the issue.\nMultiple efforts to disqualify Trump from the ballot in numerous states have been playing out in recent months. On Wednesday, the Michigan Supreme Court decided to allow Trump’s name to appear on the state’s primary ballot. Trump has decried the attempts to block him from running as a “pathetic gambit” to rig the election.\nThe post Trump Is Back on Colorado’s Primary Ballot—for Now appeared first on The Daily Beast .",

Desde entonces, ha evolucionado y se ha adaptado a las condiciones ambientales. El programa determina qué vehículos pueden circular en días específicos, generalmente basado en el último dígito de la placa del vehículo. Durante las alertas ambientales, las restricciones pueden ser más estrictas. En estos casos, se puede prohibir la circulación de todos los vehículos, independientemente de su número de placa.\nMala calidad del aire\nMala calidad del aire en la mayor parte de la CDMX y el Edomex se reportó este miércoles 5 de marzo del 2025, pese a ello, no se activó Contingencia Ambiental y tampoco Doble Hoy No Circula para este jueves.\n*mvg*",
