    "text": "Salud y Vida: Consejos para una vida longeva y saludable ¿Quiere vivir 100 años y vivir bien? ¡Los expertos dicen que empiece a prepararse ya! \"Para muchos de mis pacientes, de lo que se trata es de: \"¿Cómo puedo mantener mi independencia, cómo puedo mantener mi calidad de vida?\", agrega Jose Santana, MD, MPH Medicina Interna Su principal objetivo debe ser: evitar los obstáculos autoimpuestos a su salud. Más del 80% de las enfermedades crónicas pueden prevenirse con comportamientos saludables. \"Podemos cambiar la calidad de vida de una persona, la capacidad de permanecer en casa, la capacidad de seguir siendo independiente\", agrega Jose Santana, MD, MPH. Primero: mantente activo Las personas que realizan actividad física durante unas siete horas a la semana tienen un 40 por ciento menos de riesgo de morir prematuramente que las que realizan actividad física durante menos de 30 minutos a la semana. Los expertos en salud dicen que hay que incorporar actividades aeróbicas, entrenamiento de fuerza y ejercicios de equilibrio. \"Una persona mayor que participa en actividades de equilibrio, como el tai chi, tiene menos probabilidades de sufrir caídas\", agrega Jose Santana, MD, MPH. Además: sigue una dieta sana y no comas en exceso. Las investigaciones sobre centenarios han descubierto que tradicionalmente siguen una dieta baja en calorías y rica en verduras. También dejan de comer cuando están llenos en un 80 por ciento. Además: mantente socialmente comprometido. Según un estudio, las personas con muchos contactos sociales tienen un 50% más de probabilidades de vivir más que las que tienen pocos o ningún contacto social. Y finalmente: duerma lo suficiente. Los estudios demuestran que dormir menos de siete horas por noche de forma regular está relacionado con la diabetes, las enfermedades cardiacas, la hipertensión, los accidentes cerebrovasculares, la depresión y un mayor riesgo de muerte. Otro estudio que examinó las características de la personalidad de los judíos ashkenazi de entre 95 y 107 años de edad encontró que la mayoría de ellos tenía una actitud positiva y sentido del humor, lo que sugiere que estas características tienen un papel importante cuando se trata de la longevidad.

    "text": "SEOUL - North Korea's foreign ministry denounced a US planned sale of Apache helicopters to South Korea, state media KCNA said on Aug 23, vowing to take additional steps to bolster its self-defence.\nThe Pentagon said on Aug 19 that the US State Department has approved the potential sale of Apache helicopters and related logistics and support to South Korea for an estimated US$3.5 billion (S$4.7 billion).\nAn unnamed senior official in charge of foreign news at North Korea's foreign ministry issued a press statement on Aug 22 criticising the sale plan as a move to aggravate tension, alongside ongoing annual military drills by the allies.\n\"This is a reckless provocative act of deliberately increasing the security instability in the region,\" the official said, according to KCNA.\nThe official accused Washington of escalating military confrontation, \"disturbing the military balance and thus increasing the danger of a new conflict\" in the region by supplying lethal weapons to its allies and friends.\nPyongyang's \"strategic deterrence will be further strengthened to protect the national security and interests and the regional peace,\" the statement said, pledging to steadily conduct military activities to boost self-defence.

    "text": "Las fuerzas de seguridad de Turquía han detenido este viernes a más de 30 personas supuestamente vinculadas con el grupo yihadista Estado Islámico que planeaban atentados contra sinagogas e iglesias en el país, así como contra la Embajada de Irak en la capital, Ankara. Fuentes de seguridad citadas por la agencia estatal turca de noticias, Anatolia, han indicado que entre los detenidos figura Mikbel al Shuaili, alias 'Abú Yakin al Iraqi', considerado como un miembro de la rama de Inteligencia del grupo yihadista en Turquía. Asimismo, entre los detenidos figuran Muhamed Hilaf Ibrahim Ibrahim, alias 'Abú Leis', sospechoso de planear los ataques contra sinagogas e iglesias, e Iheb Elani, alias 'Abdulá al Jumeili', quien presuntamente preparaba un atentado contra la Embajada iraquí. Estas fuentes han destacado que otras 29 personas que mantendrían contactos con los tres principales sospechosos también han sido detenidas en la operación, llevada a cabo por los servicios de Inteligencia y la Dirección General de Seguridad. Por su parte, el ministro del Interior turco, Ali Yerlikaya, ha destacado en un mensaje en su cuenta en la red social X que \"la lucha contra las organizaciones terroristas y sus colaboradores continuará con determinación\". Yerlikaya ha destacado que la operación ha tenido como objetivo el 'Batallón Selman-i Farisi', parte de la estructura de Estado Islámico en Turquía, y ha confirmado que estas personas \"habían identificado y llevado a cabo trabajos de reconocimiento sobre lugares de culto judíos y cristianos en Estambul\". \"Felicito a los miembros de los servicios de Inteligencia y la Policía que han llevado a cabo las operaciones\", ha dicho. \"Por la paz, unidad y solidaridad de nuestra nación, no toleraremos a los terroristas. Continuaremos nuestra lucha sin interrupción con los grandes esfuerzos de nuestras fuerzas de seguridad\", ha apostillado. La operación ha tenido lugar una semana después de que el propio Yerlikaya anunciada la detención de más de 300 personas por sus presuntos lazos con el grupo yihadista Estado Islámico en una serie de operaciones llevadas a cabo en más de 30 provincias del país, en el marco de los esfuerzos contra las actividades de la organización terrorista. Las autoridades turcas han llevado a cabo decenas de operaciones contra el grupo durante los últimos años. Estado islámico ha perpetrado varios atentados en suelo turco en los últimos años en los que han muerto al menos 300 personas y cientos más han resultado heridas.\nDetenidas más de 30 personas por un supuesto plan de Estado Islámico para atentar contra iglesias y sinagogas\nDEPORTES\nDe la Rosa elige el podio de Alonso en Brasil como el mejor momento de 2023\n“Fingía estar enfermo”: La revelación de Lewis Hamilton que generó impacto en la Fórmula 1\nEl debut de Nadal en Brisbane será antes de lo esperado y en dobles\nFue uno de los tenistas juveniles más destacados de Argentina y hoy es una de las máximas promesas de River Plate: “Era de lo mejor del país”\nENTRETENIMIENTO\nKendall Jenner posó con otro abrigo tras recibir ataques por llevar uno de piel de 27.000 dólares\nAriana Grande ya convive junto a Ethan Slater, tres meses después de su divorcio de Dalton Gomez\nLos protagonistas de “Los delincuentes” hablan de una de las películas del año\nLa extraordinaria cantidad de dinero que el novio de Halle Bailey gastó en regalos de navidad para ella\nTENDENCIAS\nEl envejecimiento bajo la lupa: qué rol cumplen los relojes internos de cada órgano del cuerpo\nGuía para un brindis memorable: los mejores espumantes argentinos para despedir el año\nConsejos de la neurociencia para planificar nuevos desafíos y objetivos en 2024",

(WBAY) - A special ceremony was held Wednesday to honor distinguished alumni of the Oshkosh Area School District.\nJanette Fennell graduated from Oshkosh West in 1972 and is the founder and president of Kids and Car Safety.\nHer advocacy has led to numerous advancements in safety features, including trunk release mechanisms, which she developed after a traumatic experience in 1995 when she and her family were kidnapped and locked in the trunk of their car.\nNot one person has died since the implementation of the trunk release mechanism in 2002.\n“We work to save kids’ lives, you don’t think about awards for doing that type of work, you just think about saving lives, so this is a nice little whipped cream on top of the sundae,” said Fennell.\nTo learn more about her organization you can go to https://www.kidsandcars.org/.\nCopyright 2025 WBAY.
