    "text": "LAFAYETTE, La. (NEWS 15) — The Louisiana Department of Health reported on Thursday, December 19, that avian flu has been detected in a second backyard flock in the state, this one in southwest Louisiana. It follows the CDC reporting that a Louisiana patient hospitalized in Lake Charles is the first severe human case of bird flu in the country.\nThe patient is from southwest Louisiana, over 65, and hospitalized in critical condition. The source is likely exposure to a backyard flock of birds.\nBird flu is a Type A H5N1 influenza virus or Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. And while this is the first severe case in the United States, there are 61 known cases in people for the year.\nThe virus lives and multiplies in wild birds, called a sanctuary site. From there, it spreads to other birds like chickens where it's often fatal. The virus has acquired the ability to spread to mammals like cattle and other mammals, including humans.\nRELATED STORIES:\nSo far, there has not been any direct person-to-person transmission. But should it occur, exposure to the new aggressive strain, without pre-existing immunity, could be the next pandemic.\nFor now, the best advice is to avoid exposure to H5N1. Do not handle sick or dead animals without proper protection. Avoid undercooked eggs, dairy, and unpasteurized milk. And report any sick or dead animals.\nThe threat to the general public remains low.",

    "title": "Mets great Darryl Strawberry delivers his message of hope through his Strawberry Ministries",
    "text": "NEW YORK — Before Darryl Strawberry became the toast of New York City and won a World Series, before the substance abuse and well before the Mets announced that they would retire his number 18 on Saturday at Citi Field, he was a kid in South Central Los Angeles.\nStrawberry grew up in a neighborhood in decline. The freeway system divided along traditional segregation lines, and the area felt the effects of eliminating manufacturing jobs in the 1970s, when Strawberry was playing baseball and basketball on the city’s courts and diamonds.\nSports were a chance for kids in the inner cities to get out of town and break the cycle of poverty and gangs.\n“Coming from the inner city, you played with all Black players,” Strawberry said recently on a Zoom call. “You never played with people of any other color. And that was a big thing. We played against other players — white players — but we’ve never had white teammates.”\nThe 1979 Crenshaw High School baseball team was the stuff of lore. They reached the City Championship at Dodger Stadium, where they lost to a Granada Hills team with a third baseman you might have heard of — John Elway. For years, it was considered one of the best teams the state had ever seen. Nine players were drafted by major league teams, including Strawberry, who was drafted first overall in 1980.\nHe was compared to Ted Williams in a “Sports Illustrated” article shortly before he was drafted.\n“I was like, ‘Who the heck is Ted Williams?' ” Strawberry said. “The only baseball that I followed growing up was the Dodgers because I grew up in L.A. It was the Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds.”\nStrawberry, the prolific former Mets outfielder with the distinctive leg kick at the plate, got his ticket out of town and a one-way ticket to success. He became an eight-time All-Star, part of three World Series-winning teams and a two-time Silver Slugger who led the NL in home runs in 1988.\nBut along with former pitcher Dwight “Doc” Gooden, Strawberry also became a cautionary tale. Drugs, alcohol and domestic violence took hold of him, rewriting the narrative of his career. He wasn’t the only member of that 1979 team to have served time as catcher Carl Jones ended up in Folsom Prison.\nSports might be a ticket out of the hood, but at what cost does it come?\nStrawberry paid the cost with his freedom and his health. Through hard work and spiritual guidance, he turned it all around. He didn’t rewrite the narrative; he wrote newer, healthier, sober chapters.\nStrawberry’s current chapter is as a speaker with the ministry founded by him and his wife, Tracy. It’s a legacy he’s leaving behind that’s bigger than baseball and bigger than him.\n“He speaks at churches, he speeds out rehabilitation centers, he speaks at schools,” his niece, Michelle Strawberry, told the New York Daily News. “Everything is different, and everything is kind of tailored towards what he’s booked for.”\nThe common theme in all of his speeches is hope.\n“Darryl’s message resonates with everyone — regardless of their faith background — because so many are utterly defeated and bereft of hope,” said his friend Mark Vernarelli. “He reminds them that there is hope.”\nVernarelli is the media relations manager for the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, a former news reporter and play-by-play announcer. He followed Strawberry’s rise through the minor leagues and the major leagues and followed his fall. He thought he would be a perfect person to speak to prison inmates.\n“We always try to bring in programs, services and people who can help the incarcerated turn their lives around,” Vernarelli said. “Knowing Darryl’s transformation and the troubles he has overcome, I thought he’d be a great person to visit the incarcerated and offer hope.”\nStrawberry visited four Western Maryland prisons in 2015 with Vernarelli saying the men were “mesmerized” by Strawberry’s message. Michelle, who schedules his travel and speaking engagements, has seen the same reactions at other events.\n“The response is unbelievable,” Michelle said. “When I’m not there, they always say he’s the best speaker. He’s the most humble, the most gracious, the most giving with his time.”\nTo Mets fans, Strawberry is a hero. To convicts, he’s a positive influence. To addicts, he’s an inspiration. But to Michelle, the daughter of his brother Michael, a former minor leaguer, he’s just “Uncle Darryl,” a down-to-earth family man who treats everyone the same, whether it’s a billionaire like Mets owner Steve Cohen or an addict in need of encouragement. This is part of his charm and charisma.\n“I think it’s just his upbringing,” Michelle said. “It was the way he grew up. And I feel like he’s just always been a people person. People always obviously looked up to him, but he was always just a people person. I think he’s humble because of everything that he’s been through and where he’s at now.”\nWhere he’s at now is on the road. Michelle estimates that Strawberry is on the road about 150 days a year. Recently, she has taken her four kids, ages 9, 7, 4 and 2, on the road for speaking engagements. A joint calendar helps the family keep up, but don’t ask her how she manages her uncle’s schedule with four kids because even she doesn’t know.\nAll she knows is that it’s enjoyable and worthwhile.\n“To be honest, I have no idea,” she said. “I just get it done. He’s so busy, it’s like, insane how much he travels, And I don’t know how to keep up with it all. But I do.”\nStrawberry and Tracy asked her to come aboard when they created Strawberry Ministries. It was a no-brainer. Michelle, based in Orange County, Calif., remembers watching Strawberry play baseball as a kid, handing him balls so he could autograph them and toss them to kids over the fence. Even at the height of his fame, he was still her humble uncle.\nRecently, they traveled to Kingsport, Tenn., where Strawberry played his first season in the minor leagues. At the time, the kid from Crenshaw wasn’t ready for what he experienced there — being without his family, white teammates, racism and … wood bats.\n“Can you imagine what the culture shock of it was coming from South Central L.A. to Kingsport, Tennessee? I was like, ‘Where the heck am I? I’m in the middle of nowhere and I’ve got to play baseball — now I got to use a wood bat too?'”\nStrawberry’s inner-city childhood may not have prepared him for fame and fortune in New York, but it made him who is today. Through all of the trophies, trials and dark moments, Strawberry became more than a cautionary tale, he became a success story.\nThe Mets are an important part of that story for him, just as he’s an important part of the club’s success.\n“I played in other places, but no place like Shea Stadium,” he said. “Nothing on the planet like Shea Stadium, nothing like that curtain call, nothing like who we were as a team.”\nAn honor like this for a player like Strawberry is a lifetime achievement award of sorts. No longer burdened by his past, No. 18 will represent what can be achieved in the future — hope.\n“I firmly believe that God uses someone’s fame and great victories to help others, but only after those same victorious people fall victim to terrible trials,” Vernarelli said. “Only then can they truly offer the hope that so many people have lost.”\n©2024 New York Daily News.

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "- انخفض زوج الدولار الأسترالي/الين الياباني إلى قرب 94.00 خلال الجلسة الآسيوية يوم الخميس.\n- استقر معدل البطالة الأسترالي عند 4.1٪ في مايو، كما هو متوقع.\n- تعزز معنويات الابتعاد عن المخاطرة وسط تصاعد التوترات في الشرق الأوسط الين الياباني.\nيجذب زوج الدولار الأسترالي/الين الياباني بعض البائعين إلى حوالي 94.00 خلال ساعات التداول الآسيوية يوم الجمعة. يقوى الين الياباني (JPY) مقابل الدولار الأسترالي (AUD) وسط تصاعد التوترات الجيوسياسية في الشرق الأوسط. سيبقي المتداولون أعينهم على بيانات مؤشر أسعار المستهلك الوطني الياباني لشهر مايو و محضر اجتماع السياسة النقدية لبنك اليابان (BoJ)، المقرر صدورهما في وقت لاحق يوم الجمعة.\nأظهرت البيانات الصادرة عن مكتب الإحصاءات الأسترالي (ABS) يوم الخميس أن معدل البطالة في البلاد استقر عند 4.1٪ في مايو، تماشياً مع توقعات السوق. في الوقت نفسه، جاءت بيانات التغير في التوظيف عند -2.5 ألف في مايو مقابل 87.6 ألف في السابق (تم تعديلها من 89 ألف)، مقارنة بتوقعات السوق البالغة 25 ألف.\nتفشل بيانات التوظيف الأسترالية في تعزيز الدولار الأسترالي حيث يراقب المتداولون عن كثب التطورات المحيطة بتوترات إسرائيل وإيران. الخوف من أن التدخل المباشر للولايات المتحدة قد يوسع النزاع يعزز تدفقات الملاذ الآمن، مما يدعم الين الياباني.\nذكرت بلومبرغ في وقت مبكر من يوم الخميس، نقلاً عن مصادر غير مسماة، أن \"المسؤولين الأمريكيين يستعدون لعمل محتمل ضد إيران في الأيام القادمة.\" في وقت متأخر من يوم الثلاثاء، قال الرئيس الأمريكي ترامب إنه وافق على خطط الهجوم ضد إيران لكنه أوقفها لرؤية ما إذا كانت طهران ستتخلى عن برنامجها النووي. وأكد ترامب إصراره على الاستسلام غير المشروط لإيران، لكن المرشد الأعلى الإيراني آية الله علي خامنئي رفض الطلب الأمريكي.\nمن ناحية أخرى، قد تؤثر الرهانات المخفضة لبنك اليابان (BoJ) هذا العام على الين الياباني وتخلق رياحًا مواتية لزوج الدولار الأسترالي/الين الياباني. لقد دفع النهج الحذر لبنك اليابان في إنهاء تحفيزه النقدي الذي استمر لعقد من الزمن المتداولين إلى تأجيل توقعاتهم بشأن التوقيت المحتمل لرفع أسعار الفائدة التالية إلى الربع الأول من عام 2026.\nمشاعر المخاطرة FAQs\nفي عالم المصطلحات المالية، تشير المصطلحات المستخدمة على نطاق واسع \"الرغبة في المخاطرة\" و\"النفور من المخاطرة\" إلى مستوى المخاطرة التي يرغب المستثمرون في تحملها خلال الفترة المشار إليها. في سوق يتميز بالرغبة في \"المخاطرة\"، يكون المستثمرون متفائلين بشأن المستقبل وأكثر استعدادا لشراء الأصول الخطرة. في سوق يتميز \"بالنفور من المخاطرة\"، يبدأ المستثمرون في \"التصرف بطريقة آمنة\" لأنهم قلقون بشأن المستقبل، وبالتالي يشترون أصولًا أقل خطورة وأكثر ضمانًا بتحقيق عائد، حتى لو كان متواضعًا نسبيًا.\nعادة، خلال فترات \"الرغبة في المخاطرة\"، ترتفع أسواق الأسهم، وتبدأ أيضاً قيمة معظم السلع - باستثناء الذهب - في الارتفاع، حيث أنهم يستفيدون من توقعات النمو الإيجابية. يتم تعزيز عملات الدول المصدرة للسلع الثقيلة بسبب زيادة الطلب، وترتفع العملات المشفرة. في سوق يتميز \"بالنفور من المخاطرة\"، ترتفع السندات - وخاصة السندات الحكومية الرئيسية - يتألق الذهب وتستفيد جميع عملات الملاذ الآمن مثل الين الياباني والفرنك السويسري والدولار الأمريكي.\nالدولار الأسترالي AUD، الدولار الكندي CAD، الدولار النيوزيلندي NZD والعملات الأجنبية الثانوية مثل الروبل RUB والراند الجنوب أفريقي ZAR، تميل جميعها إلى الارتفاع في الأسواق التي تشهد \"رغبة في المخاطرة\". ذلك لأن اقتصادات هذه العملات تعتمد بشكل كبير على صادرات السلع الأساسية من أجل تحقيق النمو، وتميل أسعار السلع الأساسية إلى الارتفاع خلال فترات الرغبة في المخاطرة. ذلك لأن المستثمرين يتوقعون طلب أقوى على المواد الخام في المستقبل بسبب النشاط الاقتصادي المتزايد.\nالعملات الرئيسية التي تميل إلى الارتفاع خلال فترات \"النفور من المخاطرة\" هي الدولار الأمريكي USD، الين الياباني JPY، الفرنك السويسري CHF. الدولار الأمريكي، لأنه العملة الاحتياطية في العالم، ولأن المستثمرين يشترون في أوقات الأزمات ديون الحكومة الأمريكية، والتي تعتبر آمنة لأنه من غير المرجح أن يتخلف أكبر اقتصاد في العالم عن السداد. يعود سبب الين إلى زيادة الطلب على سندات الحكومة اليابانية، وذلك لأن نسبة عالية منها يحتفظ بها مستثمرون محليون من غير المرجح أن يتخلصوا منها - حتى في الأزمات. الفرنك السويسري، لأن القوانين المصرفية السويسرية الصارمة توفر للمستثمرين حماية معززة لرأس المال.\nإخلاء المسؤولية: تحتوي المعلومات الواردة في هذه الصفحات على بيانات تطلعية تنطوي على مخاطر وشكوك. إن الأسواق والأدوات المذكورة في هذه الصفحة هي لأغراض إعلامية فقط ولا يجب أن تظهر بأي شكل من الأشكال كتوصية لشراء أو بيع هذه الأوراق المالية. يجب عليك القيام بأبحاثك الخاصة قبل اتخاذ أي قرارات الاستثمار. لا تضمن FXStreet بأي حال من الأحوال أن تكون هذه المعلومات خالية من الأخطاء أو والمغالطات أو الأخطاء المادية. كما لا يضمن أن هذه المعلومات ذات طبيعة مناسبة. الاستثمار في الفوركس ينطوي على قدر كبير من المخاطر ، بما في ذلك فقدان كل أو جزء من الاستثمار الخاص بك ، فضلا عن التوترات. تقع على عاتقك جميع المخاطر والخسائر والتكاليف المرتبطة بالاستثمار، بما في ذلك الخسارة الإجمالية لرأس المال.\nآخر الأخبار\nاختيارات المحررين\nتوقعات سعر الذهب: زوج الذهب/الدولار XAU/USD ثابت فيما دون مستوى 3400 دولار مباشرة\nتستمر التوترات التجارية العالمية وأزمة الشرق الأوسط في دعم المعدن اللامع. من المحتمل أن يهز الإعلان المرتقب من الاحتياطي الفيدرالي الدولار الأمريكي. يواصل زوج الذهب/الدولار XAU/USD مرحلة التماسك قبيل 3400 دولار مع ميل المخاطر نحو الاتجاه الصعودي.\nتوقعات سعر البيتكوين: يستقر قرب 105000 دولار قبل قرار الفيدرالي واحتمال تدخل أمريكي في الصراع بين إسرائيل وإيران\nيتأرجح سعر البيتكوين قرب 105000 دولار يوم الأربعاء، بعد انخفاض بنسبة 2% في اليوم السابق. تركيز المتداولين يتحول إلى قرار سعر الفائدة من الاحتياطي الفيدرالي الأمريكي، والذي قد يجلب تقلبات للأصول عالية المخاطر، مثل البيتكوين.\nالفوركس اليوم: من المتوقع أن يبقى بنك إنجلترا على الحياد\nبعد قرار بنك الاحتياطي الفيدرالي المتوقع على نطاق واسع بالإبقاء على أسعار الفائدة دون تغيير، استعاد الدولار الأمريكي الزخم الصعودي. ومع ذلك، فإن الموقف المتشدد من رئيس الاحتياطي الفيدرالي باول خلال مؤتمره الصحفي والتصريحات المتفائلة بعض الشيء من الرئيس ترامب حول صفقة محتملة مع إيران قدمت في النهاية دعمًا إضافيًا للدولار الأمريكي.",

    "text": "RELIGIÓ\nPedralbes es queda buit\nEl monestir, consagrat el 1327, viu avui un dia històric amb la marxa de les tres últimes monges de la congregació de les clarisses\nLa història s’escriu amb dates. Dates d’inici i dates de final. Avui en toca una de tancament de cicle. El 15 de febrer de 2026 quedarà com el dia en que el monestir de Pedralbes va quedar deshabitat. Per aquest matí s’espera que les tres germanes que fins avui han mantingut activa la congregació de les clarisses marxin al nou destí de Vilobí d’Onyar. Es posarà fi així a 700 anys de presència de les monges des que el monestir, impulsat per la reina Elisenda de Montcada, va ser consagrat el 3 de maig de 1327.\nEl trasllat de sor Isaura, Immaculada i Pilar es vol que es faci sense l’estridència que aquests darrers dies s’ha generat veïns i feligresos s’han mobilitzat per aconseguir que les religioses es quedessin a Pedralbes. Des que el Punt Avui va explicar que Pedralbes deixava de tenir una comunitat de religioses, i quan es va saber que les monges marxaven obligades, un grup de persones es van organitzar per intentar frenar la marxa.\nAquest suport a les tres clarisses s’ha concretat en dues mobilitzacions, la darrera dimecres passat coincidint amb la celebració del dia de Santa Eulàlia i la presència de l’alcalde, Jaume Collboni, i la corporació municipal al monestir. Per avui, però, i després d’acceptar que el trasllat és irreversible, no hi ha cap acte convocat amb la idea que la marxa es pugui fer en la intimitat.\nLes monges marxen, però ho fan a desgrat. El dia de Santa Eulàlia, i en paraules a la premsa, sor Isaura, que sempre ha confiat en que hi hagués “un miracle” que evités la seva marxa, ja va explicar que se’n van dolgudes, i ella especialment “esquinçada per dins”.\nEn el parlament que Collboni va fer a la comunitat, l’alcalde va manifestar la voluntat de l’Ajuntament de mantenir viu el monestir i es va mostrar convençut que hi tornarà a haver vida monàstica al recinte, recordant que les monges han marxat en altres ocasions i sempre hi han tornat.\nEl monestir perdrà la vida de la comunitat religiosa però mantindrà el culte, per decisió del bisbat de Barcelona que en un principi havia decidit cessar aquesta activitat. També es mantindrà obert l’edifici per les visites culturals al recinte medieval i com espai d’exposicions temporals. El monestir, a través de la gestió municipal, també manté actiu l’hort on s’hi duen a terme pràctiques experimentals de recuperació de cultius antics, quasi extingits.\nIdentificar-me.
