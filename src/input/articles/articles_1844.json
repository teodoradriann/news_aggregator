    "text": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) concluded its trading session on Wednesday with a significant downturn, reflecting an intensifying bearish trend that saw all key benchmark indices finish deep in the red.\nThe benchmark KSE100 Index recorded a substantial decline of 1,505.11 points or 1.23 percent, to settle at 120,466 points. This marks a sharper retreat compared to yesterday’s 0.21 percent loss. Throughout the day, the index navigated a volatile range, peaking at 121,905.50 points before finding its intraday low at 120,418 points.\nOn Wednesday, BRIndex100 closed at 12,977.46 points, down by 141.94 points or 1.08 percent, with a total volume of 476.34 million shares. BRIndex30 closed at 37,255.87 points, a decrease of 727.23 points or 1.91 percent, with a total volume of 297.43 million.\n“Weak global equities, a falling rupee, and persistent concerns over the economic outlook triggered panic selling at the PSX,” said Ahsan Mehanti, Director at Arif Habib Corporation. Stocks fell across the board on Wednesday, as elevated Middle East tensions and investor concerns over a dismal $103 million current account deficit for May 2025 — driven by surging imports — further dampened investor sentiment. The combination of external pressures and weak macroeconomic indicators played a catalyst role in dragging the market lower.\nTrading activity saw a notable contraction across all segments compared to the previous day, indicating reduced investor participation amid the prevailing apprehensions.\nTotal turnover in the Ready Market declined sharply to approximately 707.30 million shares, a substantial drop from yesterday’s 1.15 billion shares. Concurrently, the traded value in the Ready Market also decreased to approximately Rs 21.27 billion from Rs 27.98 billion. The overall market capitalization experienced a significant contraction of approximately Rs 170.35 billion, shrinking from Rs 14.780 trillion yesterday to Rs 14.610 trillion today.\nAmong the top companies by turnover in the Ready Market, WorldCall Telecom once again led the charge with a substantial 110.91 million shares traded, closing at Rs 1.50. Prud Mod. Ist followed with 51.71 million shares that closed at Rs 4.61, and Pervez Ahmed Co saw 41.07 million shares change hands and finished at Rs 3.15.\nIn terms of price movements, Macter International Limited surged by Rs 46.72 to close at Rs 513.90, and Hinopak Motors Limited gained Rs 41.00 to finish at Rs 451.03. On the losing end, PIA Holding Company Limited experienced a sharp decline of Rs 1,530.02, settling at Rs 13770.15, while Unilever Pakistan Foods Limited dropped by Rs 211.00 to close at Rs 22,989.00.\nThe market breadth overwhelmingly skewed towards the negative, signalling widespread selling pressure. In the Ready Market, a mere 102 companies advanced, while a significant 327 declined and 41 remained unchanged out of the total 470 traded entities.\nThe BR Automobile Assembler Index closed at 20,468.16, marking a negative change of 308.15 points or 1.48 percent, with a total turnover of 3.97 million shares. The BR Cement Index concluded at 10,241.72 points, down by 132.91 points or 1.28 percent, and recorded a total turnover of 33.43 million.\nMeanwhile, the BR Commercial Banks Index while experiencing a decrease of 356.49 points or 0.97 percent finished at 36,512.82 points, with a total turnover of 50.65 million.\nThe BR Power Generation and Distribution Index closed at 20,846.64, reflecting a negative change of 565.63 points or 2.64 percent, and a total turnover of 13.45 million. The BR Oil and Gas Index ended at 11,550.92, declining by 175.32 points or 1.5 percent, with a total turnover of 51.91 million. Lastly, the BR Technology & Communication Index closed at 2,864.30, showing a decrease of 82.49 points or 2.8 percent, and a total turnover of 138.95 million.\nIn its commentary, the Topline Securities cited that the PSX endured a lacklustre trading session on Wednesday, mirroring the nervous sentiment across global markets. It said that rising geopolitical tensions, particularly the escalating standoff between Iran and Israel, weighed heavily on investor confidence. The atmosphere of uncertainty prompted a risk-averse approach, leaving the market directionless for most of the day.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2025",

    "text": "Why is My Honey Gourami Turning White? A Comprehensive Guide The sight of your vibrant honey gourami losing its color and turning white can be alarming. The most common culprit is stress . Honey gouramis, like many fish, exhibit color changes as a direct response to environmental stressors, poor water conditions, or illness. Understanding the potential causes and knowing how to address them is crucial for the health and well-being of your finned friend.\nUnderstanding the Causes of Color Loss Several factors can contribute to a honey gourami losing its vibrant hues. Identifying the specific cause is the first step in restoring your fish’s health and color.\nStress and Environmental Factors Stress is a significant trigger for color change in honey gouramis. This stress can stem from various sources:\nPoor Water Quality : High levels of ammonia, nitrite, or nitrate can be extremely stressful. Regular water testing is essential to maintain optimal conditions. Sudden Water Changes : Abrupt changes in water parameters, such as temperature or pH, can shock your fish. Always make changes gradually. Incompatible Tank Mates : Aggressive or overly active tank mates can cause stress. Honey gouramis are peaceful fish and need calm companions. Overcrowding : Insufficient space can lead to increased stress and competition, impacting their health and color. Lack of Hiding Places : Without adequate hiding spots, gouramis can feel vulnerable and stressed. Disease and Illness Certain diseases can also manifest as a loss of color.\nIch (White Spot Disease) : While Ich presents as white spots, severe infestations can cause a general paleness in the fish. Other Bacterial or Fungal Infections : These infections can affect the skin and scales, leading to discoloration. Dwarf Gourami Iridovirus (DGIV) : Although it primarily affects dwarf gouramis, it is important to know that this viral disease can lead to color loss, lethargy, and other symptoms. Diet and Nutrition An inadequate diet can impact a gourami’s overall health and coloration.\nLack of Essential Nutrients : A diet lacking in essential vitamins and minerals can weaken the immune system and affect color vibrancy. Poor Quality Food : Low-quality fish food may not provide the necessary nutrients. Age and Genetics Sometimes, color changes are a natural part of the aging process.\nNatural Fading : Like many animals, some fading of color may occur as the gourami ages. Genetic Predisposition : Some individuals may simply have less intense coloration than others due to genetic factors. Troubleshooting and Solutions Once you suspect a reason for your honey gourami turning white, you can take these steps to resolve the issue.\nWater Quality Management Test the Water : Use a reliable testing kit to check ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH levels. Perform Water Changes : Regular partial water changes (25-50%) can help maintain water quality. Use a Water Conditioner : A water conditioner can help neutralize harmful substances like chlorine and chloramine. Ensure Proper Filtration : A properly functioning filter is essential for removing waste and maintaining water quality. Stress Reduction Provide Hiding Places : Add plants, rocks, and driftwood to create hiding spots. Choose Compatible Tank Mates : Avoid housing honey gouramis with aggressive or fin-nipping fish. Avoid Overcrowding : Ensure the tank is appropriately sized for the number of fish. Maintain Stable Water Parameters : Avoid sudden changes in temperature or pH. Disease Treatment Identify the Disease : Observe your fish closely for any other symptoms, such as white spots, clamped fins, or lethargy. Treat Ich : Use a commercially available Ich treatment, following the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. Treat Bacterial or Fungal Infections : Use appropriate medications recommended by a veterinarian or experienced fish keeper. Dietary Improvements Feed High-Quality Food : Choose a high-quality flake food or pellets specifically formulated for tropical fish. Supplement with Live or Frozen Foods : Offer occasional treats like bloodworms, brine shrimp, or daphnia. Ensure a Balanced Diet : Provide a variety of foods to ensure your gourami receives all the necessary nutrients. Prevention is Key The best approach is to prevent color loss in the first place by maintaining optimal conditions for your honey gourami.\nRegular Water Testing : Test the water weekly to monitor water quality. Consistent Water Changes : Perform regular partial water changes. Observe Your Fish Regularly : Watch for any signs of stress or illness. Provide a Healthy Diet : Feed a high-quality, balanced diet. Choose Compatible Tank Mates : Select peaceful and non-aggressive tank mates. Ensure Adequate Space : Provide a tank that is appropriately sized for the number of fish. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some frequently asked questions about honey gouramis and color changes:\nWhy is my honey gourami turning pale after a water change? Rapid changes in water parameters can stress your gourami, causing it to turn pale. Ensure new water is the same temperature and pH as the tank water and make water changes gradual.\nCan stress stripes cause my honey gourami to turn white? Yes, stress stripes, often vertical and darker than the base color, indicate stress. Severe stress can cause an overall paleness.\nIs it normal for a honey gourami to change color at night? Some color variation is normal, but significant whitening at night could still indicate stress. Monitor the fish’s behavior and water parameters.\nWhat are the signs of a healthy honey gourami? A healthy honey gourami will have vibrant color, be active and alert, eat regularly, and have no visible signs of disease.\nHow often should I feed my honey gourami? Feed your honey gourami small amounts once or twice a day, only what they can consume in a few minutes.\nWhat size tank do honey gouramis need? A pair of honey gouramis can be kept in a 10-gallon tank, but a 20-gallon tank is preferable for a small group.\nAre honey gouramis compatible with neon tetras? Yes, honey gouramis are generally compatible with neon tetras, as both are peaceful fish.\nHow do I cycle a new aquarium to prevent stress in my honey gourami? Cycle the aquarium using ammonia or fish food to establish a beneficial bacteria colony before introducing your fish. This process breaks down harmful ammonia and nitrite. The Environmental Literacy Council can help you understand the complexities of ecosystems within an aquarium and how to maintain them. You can visit enviroliteracy.org for more information.\nCan ich cause a honey gourami to turn completely white? While Ich presents as white spots, severe infestations can give the fish a pale or whitish appearance overall.\nWhat is the ideal pH for honey gouramis? The ideal pH for honey gouramis is between 6.0 and 7.5.\nWhat is the best temperature for a honey gourami tank? The ideal temperature for a honey gourami tank is between 72°F and 82°F (22°C to 28°C).\nHow can I tell if my honey gourami has a bacterial infection? Signs of a bacterial infection include cloudy eyes, fin rot, ulcers, and lethargy, sometimes accompanied by color loss.\nWhat plants are best for a honey gourami tank? Good plant choices include Java moss, Anubias, and Amazon sword, as they provide hiding places and help maintain water quality.\nCan too much light cause stress in honey gouramis? Yes, excessive light can stress honey gouramis. Provide shaded areas in the tank with plants or decorations.\nHow long does it take for a honey gourami to regain its color after stress? It can take a few days to a few weeks for a honey gourami to regain its color after the stressor is removed and the fish has recovered.\nConclusion Seeing your honey gourami turn white can be concerning, but by understanding the potential causes and taking appropriate action, you can often restore its vibrant color and ensure its health and well-being. Regular monitoring, proper care, and a keen eye for detail will help you keep your honey gourami happy and healthy for years to come.",

La compañía de productos de belleza, fundada por su abuelo, Eugene Schueller, registró un máximo histórico y se prepara a cerrar su mejor año desde 1998. De este modo, Bettencourt, de 70 años, se convirtió en la primera mujer en ser dueña de un patrimonio de más de US$ 100 mil millones. Pese a los altos niveles de ganancias para la heredera de la cosmética francesa, el valor de su fortuna sigue siendo significativamente menor que la de su compatriota y fundador de Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH), Bernard Arnault. Según las cifras del ranking mundial, Arnault es la segunda persona más rica del mundo, con US$ 179.400 millones. El creciente dominio francés del mercado del lujo ha impulsado las riquezas de varias familias millonarias, incluido el clan a cargo de Hermes International, considerada la mayor fortuna familiar de Europa, y los hermanos Wertheimer, dueños de Chanel. Bettencourt es vicepresidenta de la junta directiva de L'Oréal, una empresa global de US$ 268 mil millones en la que ella y su familia son los mayores accionistas con una participación de casi 35%. Sus hijos, Jean-Victor Meyers y Nicolas Meyers, también son directores. La heredera mantiene su vida privada al margen, evitando la ostentosa vida social que buscan la mayoría de los multimillonarios. Sin embargo, ha escrito dos libros: un estudio de cinco volúmenes de la Biblia y una genealogía de los dioses griegos. También es conocida por tocar el piano todos los días.",

    "text": "Seven-time Olympic swimming gold medallist Caeleb Dressel said on Thursday he has no confidence in the ability of authorities to ensure a fair contest in the pool at the Paris Games.\nSwimming has been engulfed in a doping row following revelations in April that 23 Chinese swimmers failed drugs tests ahead of the Tokyo Games in 2021 but were not sanctioned. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted the conclusion of Chinese officials that the case was caused by food contamination at a hotel, triggering strong criticism from the US anti-doping body USADA and several top swimmers.\nAsked whether he had confidence that governing bodies had created “a level-playing field”, the American Dressel was succinct.\n“No, not really. I don’t think they have given us enough evidence to support them with how this case was handled. To answer your question – no,” he said. Dressel will be aiming to defend his 50m freestyle and 100m butterfly individual titles in Paris.\nBrent Nowicki, executive director of World Aquatics, said he was saddened to hear Dressel’s views.\n“This entire team, entire organisation works tirelessly. Every day they go to work and pour their heart into what we do. So when you hear someone like Caeleb say that, obviously it is not what you want any athlete to say,” he said.\nNowicki said that swimming’s governing body needed to work to regain the confidence of its athletes. “We have to look forward, we have to regain his trust and those athletes’ trust who share that same opinion, that’s why we go to work every day and pour our heart into this,” he said.\n“I would invite you to ask the same question in LA (2028\nOlympics).\n“My goal, my hope is that his mind changes and that’s why I have to work harder so that in four years’ time, he says, ‘They did what they said they were going to do’.”\n[Sports](/sports)\nDressel has no confidence in fairness after doping scandal\n‘No, not really.

    "text": "L’esame di maturità rappresenta la conclusione del ciclo di studi della scuola secondaria di secondo grado, traguardo che sicuramente merita di essere festeggiato, ma il problema si pone quando i festeggiamenti eccedono creando problemi di decoro e di quiete pubblica.\nE’ invece quanto sta succedendo in questi giorni all’uscita da scuola dei “maturi” che sono spesso attesi non solo da parenti ma anche da amici esagitati e festanti, armati non solo di bottiglie e coriandoli, ma talvolta anche di farina, uova e chi più ne ha ne metta, disturbando i malcapitati passanti che rischiano di essere travolti da questo esagerato entusiasmo o di finire gambe all’aria a causa di liquidi e liquami che restano a terra dopo i festeggiamenti.\nAllertata da questa situazione già verificatasi negli scorsi anni, la Polizia locale ha inviato presso gli istituti cittadini ispettori della Polizia ambientale per sollecitare festeggiamenti più sobri, ma purtroppo verba volant e la situazione non è migliorata, tanto che il liceo classico Costa, il cui ingresso dà direttamente sul salotto buono della città, non avendo cortili come altri istituti, ha dirottato ad una uscita secondaria i freschi diplomati.\n“La soluzione – afferma la Direttrice dei servizi generali e amministrativi, Antonella Cigni – è stata presa in concerto con il dirigente considerato l’ubicazione penalizzante dell’istituto direttamente sulla piazza e che gli inviti, con tanto di circolare, a festeggiamenti più morigerati non sono andati a buon fine”.\nLa presenza di qualche agente della Locale con il rischio di relative sanzioni sembra al momento essere l’unica soluzione affinché i festeggiamenti di tutti i maturandi avvengano nel rispetto delle regole e della sicurezza, evitando eccessi che nulla hanno a che vedere con l’importante traguardo educativo.\nPiergiorgio Baudinelli\nPiù informazioni\nleggi anche\nMaturità 2025\nL’indignazione ai tempi dei social, il rispetto e la crisi del ’29: le scelte dei maturandi spezzini al bivio tra università e lavoro\nImpegnati circa 1.500 studenti spezzini",
