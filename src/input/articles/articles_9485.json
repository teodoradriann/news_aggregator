    "text": "Nacen 60 crías del casi extinto cocodrilo siamés en una zona selvática de Camboya Fauna & Flora precisó que nacieron en un lugar donde no se han introducido ejemplares del cocodrilo siamés, lo que sugiere que la población autóctona se está regenerando conservación El cocodrilo siamés estuvo a punto de extinguirse en el Sudeste Asiático, pero su situación ha mejorado ligeramente en los últimos años y ahora sesenta crías nacieron en una zona selvática de Camboya, informó este jueves la ONG Fauna & Flora. En un comunicado, la ONG afirmó que 60 huevos de esta especie eclosionaron con éxito a finales de junio, un mes después de ser descubiertos en cinco lugares diferentes en los montes Cardamomo, en el suroeste camboyano. Miembros de la ONG y voluntarios estuvieron protegiendo los nidos durante semanas para evitar riesgos. Fauna & Flora precisó que nacieron en un lugar donde no se han introducido ejemplares del cocodrilo siamés, lo que sugiere que la población autóctona se está regenerando. \"El reciente descubrimiento de nidos salvajes subraya la importancia vital de proteger esta zona. Con sólo unos cientos de individuos que se calcula que viven en libertad, la eclosión de 60 nuevos cocodrilos supone un tremendo impulso\", dijo el director de la ONG en Camboya, Pablo Sinovas. El activista destacó la necesidad de la colaboración con las instituciones locales para proteger el entorno natural en un momento de \"gran declive\" de la biodiversidad en la región. Fauna & Flora, que colabora con las autoridades camboyanas en su trabajo para proteger a estos reptiles, afirmó que el cocodrilo siamés desapareció del 99 por ciento de su hábitat natural en el Sudeste Asiático. El cocodrilo siamés (\"Crocodylus siamensis\") llega a medir hasta unos 4 metros de largo y en ocasiones es cazado ilegalmente para arrancarle la piel o para llevarlo a granjas donde son criados por su carne y la fabricación de artículos como bolsos y zapatos. La especie se encuentra en peligro crítico de extinción, según la lista roja de la Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza (IUCN, en sus siglas en inglés). Sin embargo, existen cientos de miles de estos reptiles en granjas comerciales en Tailandia, donde a menudo son cruzados con otras especies de cocodrilos como el de agua salada (\"C. porosus\").",

    "title": "Escaping the 'Demoralizing' New York Dating Scene",
    "text": "“Dating in New York can be so jading and demoralizing,” said Allegra Teresa Hanlon.\nIf films and television shows are any indication, it seems to have been that way for some time. It was the subject of Carrie Bradshaw’s musings in HBO’s “Sex and the City.” It was also reinforced in the 1989 romantic comedy “When Harry Met Sally,” when Marie (Carrie Fisher) proclaims to Jess (Bruno Kirby), while snuggled in bed, “Tell me I’ll never have to be out there again” — “out there” referring to the fraught world of New York dating.\nFor Ms. Hanlon and Thomas James Fitzpatrick, the complexities of the New York dating scene became a point of connection during their first date at Jackson’s Eatery in Long Island City, Queens, in June 2019.\n“I’m so tired of dating in New York,” he told her while shaking his head.\nMr. Fitzpatrick had been living in Queens for three years. Ms. Hanlon was in New York for just a year, but that was enough for her to feel exhausted by the cycle of meeting new people, conversations fizzling out or ghosting. And, as Mr. Fitzpatrick put it, the air of, “You’re pretty good, but you’re not perfect, so I’m going to find someone else.”\nHe added: “It just felt so fast and transactional, and, I don’t know — it just felt not that romantic.”\nFour years after their first date, Ms. Hanlon was able to place her arm around Mr. Fitzpatrick and recite the same phrase from “When Harry Met Sally,” her favorite movie, re-enacting the scene on the night of their engagement.\nThe couple first met on Hinge when Ms. Hanlon, 29, liked a picture of Mr. Fitzpatrick, 32, playing soccer. They were both college athletes: She played tennis at Cornell, where she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English, and he played soccer at Bentley University, where he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in economics.\nMr. Fitzpatrick asked her out to Sunday brunch. After they finished their meal, they still had so much to talk about, so they popped into Woodbines, a bar nearby. After a few drinks, he walked her to the Vernon Boulevard-Jackson Avenue subway station, and he kissed her goodbye. “I was nervous, but I just went in for the kiss,” he said, “and it was great.”\nHe then went to Maine for two weeks for Fourth of July celebrations with his family, and Mr. Fitzpatrick, who typically disconnects from his phone during vacations, was not texting her much.\n“I was super scared that he was going to forget about me,” Ms. Hanlon said, “and that I was never going to go on another date with this guy.” That’s typical of the dating scene in New York, after all.\nShe texted him: “I know you’re with your family, but I would love to see you when you get back from the Fourth of July vacation.” It was unlike her to propose a second date to a man, but she was certain about her feelings for him.\n“I would love that, too,” he replied.\nTheir second date was at Manducatis Rustica, an Italian restaurant in Long Island City. After dinner, they stopped by his nearby apartment, where she noticed a massive Frank Sinatra poster in his room and a keyboard crammed against the wall.\nMs. Hanlon grew up in a music-focused family. Her father, Arthur Hanlon, is a pianist and a Sony Music Latin recording artist and her mother, Leila Cobo, is a music journalist in charge of Latin music coverage at Billboard. Ms. Hanlon, who grew up playing piano, loved that Mr. Fitzpatrick was also passionate about music.\nThey started seeing each other a few times a week. She took him to Jackson Heights, Queens, to try Colombian food at Arepa Lady and hole-in-the-wall restaurants like La Esquina del Camaron Mexicano.\nThree months in, Mr. Fitzpatrick felt it was time to make it official. “I was starting to, as they say, catch some feelings,” he said. He didn’t want their relationship to “fall apart into nothing.”\nThey met at Court Square Diner in Long Island City in late August, and he was so nervous that he went to the bar next door and took a shot to loosen up. He sparked a conversation with the bartender, who told him, “You look nervous. What, are you going to ask a girl to be your girlfriend?”\nThat, he did, and Ms. Hanlon wanted the same thing. Over Labor Day weekend, she went to Coventry, Conn., where he grew up, to meet his parents for the first time. Later that month, he visited her hometown, Key Biscayne, Fla., to meet hers.\nTogether, they often enjoyed breakfast on weekends, strolled around Central Park and frequented new bookstores and farmers markets. Though things were going great, in August 2021, Mr. Fitzpatrick made the decision to put their relationship on pause.\n“The pandemic in general made me think, ‘What are you doing with your life?,’” he said. He was second-guessing his career in finance and wanted to pursue his passion for winemaking. He quit his corporate job in finance and went to Sonoma County, Calif., for three months, where he was a harvest worker for DuMOL Winery in Windsor, Calif.\n“I was like, ‘What do you mean?,’” Ms. Hanlon recalled thinking when he first broke the news to her. “‘You still want to be with me? But you also expect me to hang on and wait around?’”\nUltimately, their time apart “saved” their relationship, she said. During the pandemic, the two had become codependent on each other since they weren’t able to see other friends or partake in the hobbies that they usually do. During the break, she followed some advice to “take this time and rediscover who Allegra is, what Allegra wants and what Allegra likes to do,” Ms. Hanlon said.\nHe returned to New York confident about his career, living situation and relationship. And she learned that she values her independence — she likes to be social and go out to salsa clubs with friends. (Mr. Fitzpatrick is more of an introvert.)\nThe night that he landed in New York, in November 2021, they met for dinner, shared their reflections and got back together.\nA year after the break, in late 2022, the two visited Cali, Colombia, where Ms. Hanlon’s 95-year-old grandmother resides. “I really badly wanted him to see that side of my heritage and understand my culture,” said Ms. Hanlon, whose mother is Colombian and father is Irish. Mr. Fitzpatrick, whose parents are both Irish, played cards with her grandmother, practiced his Spanish and took salsa lessons with Ms. Hanlon.\nOn Nov. 11, 2023, Mr. Fitzpatrick proposed at Grand Central Terminal, after he tricked her into thinking they would be headed to a hike in the Hudson Valley. They met at the terminal’s clock tower, and in the middle of the chaos, Frankie Valli’s “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” started playing from a speaker. Ms. Hanlon looked up to see their parents and her friends holding letters on the balcony that read, “Will you marry me?” Strangers gathered around them and applauded.\nIn March 2024, the couple moved into an apartment in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. Mr. Fitzpatrick is now a finance manager at Warner Music. Ms. Hanlon is a marketing manager at Victoria’s Secret Pink.\nOn Jan. 18, the couple were married at St. Agnes Catholic Church in Key Biscayne in front of 175 guests. The Rev. Juan Carlos Paguaga, a Catholic priest, officiated. Peter Nieto, a singer from Miami, performed “Ave Maria.”\nThe musical performances continued at the reception that followed at the nearby Ocean Club.\nA bagpipe player played at the entrance of the club. Ms. Hanlon’s father performed a Latin rendition of “Danny Boy,” an Irish song, on piano.\nA local band played an assortment of classic American wedding songs and classic salsa tunes, including “Cali Pachanguero,” an ode to Ms. Hanlon’s maternal hometown.\nThe Colombian singer Fonseca made an impromptu performance, and a D.J. from Fiesta Bresh, an international party collective that originated in Buenos Aires, also took the stage.\nThe couple read their vows to each other the morning after at a bed-and-breakfast in Islamorada, Fla., where they had a “mini-moon.”\n“There’s so much peace in knowing that you have your person that’s going to be there for you no matter what,” Ms. Hanlon said.\n“That’s how I feel,” she continued. “I have a peaceful heart.”\nOn This Day\nWhen Jan. 18, 2025\nWhere St. Agnes Catholic Church, Key Biscayne, Fla.\nHandwritten Letters Ms. Hanlon wrote a personalized letter by hand to every wedding guest that tied elements of their history together.\nA Colombian Sensation In a letter to Fonseca, a friend of her parents, Ms. Hanlon mentioned that his ballad “Te Mando Flores” was her anthem in high school when she fantasized about having a boyfriend. The song is about sending a woman flowers and waking her up with kisses every morning. She hoped that she would one day meet the person who feels the same way about her. “I wrote in the letter that it meant everything to me that I did end up meeting this guy,” Ms. Hanlon said. The message touched Fonseca, and he felt compelled to sing the song that night, though he had not planned on performing.\n‘La Hora Loca’ The final hour of a Colombian party is known as “the crazy hour.” At the reception, Fiesta Bresh played music from J Balvin and Abba and brought out a person dressed as a gigantic red bear. Guests danced the conga and struck mini tambourines that read “Allegra and Tommy,” which were designed by the wedding planner, Natasha Benitez. During the last song the D.J. played, “Mr. Brightside” by the Killers, he descended from the booth and danced with guests as they shouted the lyrics.\nThe post Escaping the ‘Demoralizing’ New York Dating Scene appeared first on New York Times.",

    "text": "转自：嘉兴日报\n　　■记者 蔡舒安\n　　通讯员 张 静 邱金梅\n　　春风起，万物生。神州大地处处生机盎然，正是植树的好时节。\n　　昨天，迎来全国第47个植树节。植树节不仅是一个节日，也是传承绿色文化、弘扬生态文明的重要载体。就在前一天上午，嘉兴植物园北门香樟广场上集聚了不少市民，一场“依法治绿 你我同行”绿化宣传活动在此举行。现场既有免费领取花苗、抽盲盒的环节，也有《古树名木保护条例》、居住区修剪等绿化普法宣传，互动性强，市民参与度高。\n　　在嘉兴，“植绿、爱绿、护绿”新风尚渐入人心。\n　　从添绿到爱绿、护绿\n　　当天一早，64岁的张老伯特意赶到植物园领取花苗，平日里他就热衷种花养花，这次，他领走了一株安酷杜鹃。和他一样赶早的市民不在少数，短短两个小时，800多株杜鹃花苗和近300个盲盒便被领取一空。\n　　增绿就是增优势，植树就是植未来。南湖区开展绿化法律法规宣贯和免费送花活动，激发市民爱绿护绿热情；秀洲区以活动为载体，让家长和孩子们利用落叶、落花描绘心中的绿色家园；嘉兴经开区集合社区工作人员、志愿者等，在三环南路、永政公园等地开展义务植树和相关志愿服务活动……又是一年植树节，嘉兴各地纷纷启动了相关主题活动。\n　　眼下，嘉兴的绿化建设进入存量时代，“公园中的城市”格局已经初现，大规模的绿化建设和树木种植将有所减少，正从单纯种树转变为绿化养护，从植绿转变为爱绿、护绿。\n　　近年来，义务植树的广度和范围在不断扩大，施肥、浇水、修剪枝叶等成为市民参与义务植树志愿服务和抚育管护的重要方式。今年，市建设局园林市政管理服务中心还开展了小微盆景制作、古树名木认养、绿化管护等一系列爱绿护绿主题活动，极大地提高了全民义务植树的参与度。\n　　对自家小区（单位）绿地进行修剪、施肥；为绿植挂上防虫粘板及蚊虫诱捕器；为树木修剪枝叶、松土、浇水……我们欣喜地看到，市民爱绿、护绿的自觉性和热情度愈发高涨。从扛起铁锹栽下一棵树苗，到主动登记认养一棵古树，从劳动尽责到捐资尽责，爱绿、护绿已经融入每一个人的日常。\n　　构建全链条保护体系\n　　植树节只有一天，但扮靓城市环境却非一日之功。今年，嘉兴植树节系列活动的主题是“依法治绿 你我同行”。2020年7月1日起，新修订的《中华人民共和国森林法》正式施行，植树节正式被写入法律。\n　　我们身边的一草一木，其实都受到法律保护。居住区绿化作为城市绿化建设的重要内容，与老百姓的生活息息相关。去年，市建设局接连发布了《嘉兴市居住区树木修剪技术导则》《嘉兴市建设局关于规范居住区树木修剪的通知》，对小区树木修剪的基本要求、作业规范、具体流程等作出明确规定，填补了嘉兴在该领域的空白。\n　　古树名木是十分重要的自然遗产和生态资源，是有生命的城市基础设施，离不开精心的日常养护和专业保护。今年3月15日，《古树名木保护条例》将正式施行，这是我国首次以行政法规的形式明确古树名木保护管理工作应遵守的行为规范，填补了古树名木保护领域国家层面的法规空白。\n　　目前，嘉兴全市拥有建档古树名木700余株。《嘉兴市城市古树名木保护管理办法》也将在今年3月发布，重点聚焦城市、城镇开发边界城市绿化范围内古树名木和古树后备资源的保护和管理，从资源普查认定、分级分类保护、日常养护管理、濒危抢救复壮、施工避让保护等方面构建古树名木全链条保护体系，为城市古树名木保护管理工作取得实效提供坚实保障。\n　　《嘉兴市城市绿化条例》《嘉兴市城市绿化养护技术规范》《嘉兴市城市绿线管理办法》……从公共的城市绿化到专业的绿化养护，再到居住区树木的修剪，嘉兴出台了一系列科学又全面的园林绿化制度规范，以“法”之名“植”此青绿，城市园林绿化景观规划建设管理工作有章可循、有法可依，不断增厚城市的“绿色家底”。\n　　绿化建设水平不断提升\n　　绿色是生态的本色，也是发展的底色。在嘉兴，“推窗见绿，出门见景，人在绿中，城在园中”早已成为现实。2024年，全市完成新增绿地200.78公顷，新建公园面积20.74公顷，新建绿道27.6公里。\n　　近年来，嘉兴陆续开展了“绿城花海”三年行动、“绿荫生态、道路出彩”专项行动；启动街角花境提升、样板绿道建设、公园配套用房整治等精细化管理示范项目；打造了市民广场、凌公塘公园、运河公园、子城遗址公园、范蠡湖公园等一批精品公园，以及菱湖湾口袋公园、农翔路—南溪路口袋公园、栅堰口袋公园等口袋公园；开展公园开放共享试点，不断完善公园绿地和绿道综合配套服务设施，创新“公园+驿站”“绿道+驿站”管理模式……嘉兴将本地人文特色融入城市绿化建设，营造特色园林精品和景观空间，推进绿化向美化、文化、人性化转变。\n　　嘉兴植物园焕新开放，迅速成为市民“新宠”，天气晴好时，一批又一批市民来到这里享受惬意时光。市民沈薇是植物园的忠实粉丝，“我最喜欢带孩子来这里了，可以亲近大自然，也可以了解植物知识，共享绿地和香樟树下的咖啡馆是必打卡的点位。”\n　　另外，绿道也是市民茶余饭后、闲暇散步的首选。市民王海峰发现，有了绿道，随意踩踏草坪的现象也减少了，大家在绿道上散步、骑行，真正实现人与自然的和谐共处。\n　　在嘉兴，“人民城市人民建，人民城市为人民”已经有了生动写照：市民的绿化保护意识不断提高，城市绿化建设水平不断提升，公共绿地向市民敞开怀抱，带来开放共享、合力向好的正向循环。\n　　又到“植”此青绿时。我们相信，今天种下无垠绿色，就是为未来孕育无限发展生机。",

No injuries were reported.\n“The arrestee committed a violent felony in a road rage incident against a stranger who was driving during their daily commute. The impulsive and violent actions of the suspect demonstrate Kenneth is a substantial danger to any individual and the community,” police wrote in their affidavit.\nUnified Police Sgt. Aymee Race says before the shooting, the victim told police that he noticed Richardson driving aggressively behind him. As Richardson continued to follow the victim, at one point he allegedly drove into the bike lane and tried cutting off the victim by swerving into him before firing a round, Race said. The victim continued driving after the shot and was pulled over a short time later by a Unified officer while trying to get away. When the victim told the officer what had happened, the road rage investigation began.\nOfficers returned to the area where the shot was allegedly fired and found a shell casing, the affidavit states.\nDetectives learned that Richardson goes to a smoke shop in the area on almost a daily basis and was seen there before the shooting, the affidavit states. They were able to collect enough information to identify Richardson as a possible suspect and found the vehicle allegedly involved in the road rage parked at his home in Holladay, according to the affidavit.\nOn Wednesday, Richardson was stopped by Salt Lake City police and found to have marijuana in his vehicle in addition to “an empty firearm case for a 9 mm handgun, and a partially filled box of 9 mm ammunition,” the affidavit states.\nA red hoodie that matched what the alleged gunman wore in the Sept. 21 shooting was also found, police stated. What prompted Richardson to allegedly go after the other driver remained under investigation Thursday.\nAccording to court records, Richardson was convicted of aggravated assault in 2018. In that case, Richardson had been working at Dunford Bakery for three days but became upset and aggressive when being told how to perform his duties, according to charging documents. After he was asked to leave, Richardson threatened to shoot one employee and slashed another with a knife, the charges state.",
