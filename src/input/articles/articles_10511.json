Be careful.” Afterwards, the teen was able to swim to the boat as two officers reached out and pulled him to safety.\nChronister recalled that the boy — who had been trying to walk back home, but misjudged how deep the water was — was “out of breath, gasping for air as we pulled him up.” Chronister went on to say that the area was not in an evacuation zone.\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nThere were 350 calls for help between 9:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 9 and 3:30 a.m. Thursday, Oct. 10, the Hillsborough County Fire Rescue told WFLA-TV.\nAnderson Cooper Struck by Flying Debris from Hurricane Milton During Live News Report: 'That Wasn't Good' Hurricane Milton made landfall around Siesta Key, Fla., around 8:30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, Oct. 9, according to the National Hurricane Center .

    "title": "August 2023: Over 1 million youth gather with Pope Francis for World Youth Day - Rome Reports",
    "text": "Pope Francis kicked off the month of August with a trip that he had been looking forward to for years: World Youth Day in Lisbon, Portugal. It had been postponed from the summer of 2022 due to the coronavirus pandemic. While in Lisbon, Pope Francis met with politicians and interreligious leaders and even traveled to Fatima to pray with the sick. But the majority of his time was spent directly with the youth. He heard confessions, held personal meetings and luncheons and delivered messages to the over 1 million youth gathered there. He encouraged each and every one of them to live boldly. POPE FRANCIS Have, therefore, the courage to replace fears with dreams; replace fears with dreams. Do not be administrators of fears but entrepreneurs of dreams! Pope Francis' four busy days in Lisbon was his first trip since his surgery in June. And on the flight back to Rome, he said he felt perfectly fine. That week, the Pope resumed his Wednesday General Audiences and his official agenda after the summer break. On the Solemnity of the Assumption on August 15, the Pope entrusted his concern for the war-torn regions of the world to Mary. He prayed for peace with 10,000 pilgrims in St. Peter's Square. And at the end of the month, one of his meetings was to receive a prestigous award. Pope Francis was awarded a journalism prize, called “E' Giornalismo,” which is known as the Italian Pulitzer. POPE FRANCIS You should know that even before I became Bishop of Rome, I used to decline the offer of awards. I never received any, I did not want to. And I continued to do so even as Pope. There is, however, one reason that prompted me to accept yours, and that is the urgency of constructive communication, which fosters a culture of encounter and not confrontation. The representatives of the award said having a pope as the recipient was an “unprecedented choice” in its history, but that Pope Francis' mission for peace and truth fits perfectly into it's purpose.

    "title": "Hamas victims file class action against Binance over allegedly facilitating terrorism financing",
    "text": "Bitcoin Families of Hamas victims launch lawsuit against Binance for alleged facilitation of terror financing, seeking damages and accountability. Families of Hamas victims have filed a lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange Binance in a federal court in Manhattan, alleging that the platform indirectly facilitated financial transactions for Hamas, Bloomberg News reported Feb. 1. The lawsuit accuses Binance of enabling the terrorist organization to bypass sanctions and anti-money laundering laws, thus providing material support to terrorism. The plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages in an effort to hold the exchange accountable. The lawsuit The lawsuit filed against Binance by families of Hamas victims alleges that from 2017 to 2023, Binance processed transactions that effectively allowed Hamas to evade international sanctions and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, thereby supporting the organization’s terrorist activities. Details from the lawsuit reveal that the plaintiffs include both individuals who have suffered directly from Hamas’ actions, such as hostages and relatives of deceased victims, and those who argue that Binance’s failure to prevent its platform from being used for terror financing has had devastating effects. The lawsuit specifically targets Binance’s operations that purportedly allowed Hamas to conduct transactions via its platform, bypassing traditional banking systems and sanctions. It also names the former CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao , along with the governments of Iran and Syria, as defendants. It is filed under the United States Anti-Terrorism Act, alleging that the defendants provided “substantial assistance” to terrorists. Stricter oversight needed This legal action is part of a broader scrutiny of cryptocurrency exchanges and their obligations under international financial regulations. The case has attracted attention from various sectors, including U.S. lawmakers who have expressed concerns over the misuse of cryptocurrencies in terror financing. Senator Cynthia Lummis and Representative French Hill have both been vocal about the need for stringent oversight of cryptocurrency transactions to prevent their exploitation by terrorist networks. Moreover, the lawsuit against Binance follows previous regulatory and legal challenges faced by the exchange, including fines for AML violations and the conviction of its former CEO. These incidents have exposed vulnerabilities within the crypto exchange’s operational frameworks, prompting calls for enhanced compliance protocols to prevent sanctioned entities and individuals from using these platforms for financial transactions. This legal action against Binance marks a critical juncture in the ongoing debate over the accountability of cryptocurrency exchanges in preventing their services from being used for unlawful activities. The outcome of this lawsuit could lead to significant changes in the regulatory landscape for digital currencies, potentially establishing new precedents for the enforcement of AML and CTF regulations within the crypto sector.

Los detenidos son miembros de la banda criminal El Mesa, que delinque en esa misma localidad del oriente antioqueño. La masacre ocurrió el 25 de junio de 2024, cuando varios hombres armados irrumpieron en una finca durante la noche y abrieron fuego contra un grupo de nueve personas. Dos de ellas lograron sobrevivir al ataque, pero el impacto de la violencia ha dejado una profunda huella en la comunidad. Las autoridades continúan investigando el caso para esclarecer los motivos detrás de esta masacre y para asegurar que los responsables enfrenten la justicia. La captura de estos individuos representa un paso significativo en la lucha contra la criminalidad en la región. ¿Qué dijo el gobernador de Antioquia sobre la captura de los presuntos responsables de la masacre en Rionegro? El gobernador de Antioquia, Andrés Julián Rendón, informó a través de su cuenta en X sobre la captura de los señalados responsables de la masacre en Rionegro.

You know some golfers play their whole life and don't get one.\"\nTheron gained his private pilot's licence in 1990 and has flown three modified types of aircraft with one arm.\nThis story was first published by the Otago Daily Times.",

    "text": "[‘Love is Blind’ season 6 has had viewers glued to their screens and pouring out all sorts of emotion.](https://thatgrapejuice.net/entertainment/2024/03/love-is-blind-star-clay-gravesande-addresses-dramatic-aftermath-of-season-6-with-amber-desiree-ad-smith/clay-ad-love-is-blind-tamron-tgj/) The relationship arc between castmates Clay Gravesande and Amber Desirée “AD” Smith, for many, has proven to be the nucleus of the season. Especially in the wake of the dramatic finale. As watched by millions, Gravesande opted not to say “I Do” to Smith in what presented as a super last-minute decision. A social media backlash erupted and, after initially addressing the matter in the hotly anticipated season 6 [reunion](https://thatgrapejuice.net/entertainment/2024/03/first-look-love-is-blind-the-reunion-season-6-trailer-unleashed/), the 32-year-old stopped by the Tamron Hall Show to discuss the experience. Full story below… Accompanied by his mother, Gravesande declared that Smith is the “love of my life,” but ultimately pointed to the familial traumas around infidelity as making him doubt his readiness to be a husband. During the candid chat, he revealed that he is now in therapy and offered an update on the status of his relationship with Smith in the here and now. Watch the full segment:",
