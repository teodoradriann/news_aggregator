    "text": "Brigitte Anzola, una colombiana que se encontraba de vacaciones en el Líbano visitando a su hija, vive momentos de incertidumbre y miedo debido al cruce de fuego entre Israel y Hezbolá. Su vuelo de regreso a Colombia fue cancelado. “Es algo que está como latente, como el miedo que puede pasar. Tratamos de llevar una vida normal”, afirmó.Brigitte describió una noche aterradora: “Estábamos en el patio de la casa, a las 12 de la noche, y pasaron los misiles, literal, por encima de nuestra cabeza. El impacto es impresionante, estamos en riesgo”.Durante su entrevista con Noticias Caracol en vivo, la tensión se hizo palpable cuando recibió un mensaje de evacuación: “Acaba de llegar un mensaje que debemos salir de la ciudad”.(Vea también: ‘Walkie-talkies’ de Hezbolá explotaron en Líbano, un día después del ataque a ‘beepers’)Su vuelo del Líbano a Colombia fue canceladoLa angustia era papable y Brigitte expresó su temor al bombardero inminente: “Van a bombardear”. Junto a su familia, comenzó a empacar algunas pertenencias en busca de refugio mientras la situación se tornaba más grave.Israel ha mantenido la orden de atacar Líbano, lo que ha llevado a un aumento de los arremetidas en diversas zonas. El primer ministro israelí, Benjamín Netanyahu, afirmó: “Seguiremos atacando a Hezbolá con toda la fuerza. No nos detendremos hasta lograr todos nuestros objetivos. El más importante de ellos, el regreso seguro de los residentes del norte a sus hogares”, cerrando así cualquier posibilidad de un alto al fuego.

Una familia pacífica fue víctima de este bombardeo; 16 personas murieron en una noche. Esto indica que los civiles están siendo atacados. Este lugar no es un centro militar”.Mientras tanto, Israel continúa preparándose para una posible incursión terrestre en Líbano, dejando a los residentes y visitantes en un estado de creciente incertidumbre y peligro.",

    "text": "Simply Wall St. Investing in IDP Education (ASX:IEL) five years ago would have delivered you a 114% gain Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) December 29, 2023 at 2:09 a.m. · 3 min read When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 104% in five years. Then again, the 8.3% share price decline hasn't been so fun for shareholders.\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\nCheck out our latest analysis for IDP Education\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nOver half a decade, IDP Education managed to grow its earnings per share at 21% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 15% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\nASX:IEL Earnings Per Share Growth December 29th 2023 We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on IDP Education's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\nWhat About Dividends? It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for IDP Education the TSR over the last 5 years was 114%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\nStory continues A Different Perspective IDP Education shareholders are down 25% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 12%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 16%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

    "text": "[Community Corner](/california/sanramon/around-town) San Ramon Students Place First At Destination Imagination Tournament A group of students are headed to the global tournaments after placing first in regional and states for the project-based competition. SAN RAMON, CA — A group of seven San Ramon students are advancing to the global competition for Destination Imagination, a project-based program teaching kids to be innovative problem solvers. The group placed first in both regional and state-level competitions, and will attend the global competition in Kansas City in May. The team needed to solve a series of seven challenges leading up to science-themed final competition. They needed to create and present the details of an archaeological investigation that leads to the discovery of an artifact, and design and build a puppet. The team’s winning creation was a life-size puppet of Leonardo da Vinci that moved its arms with hydraulics. [Last May](https://patch.com/california/sanramon/san-ramon-students-headed-destination-imagination-global-tournament), a team of 8th graders from Gale Ranch and Windemere Ranch middle schools also headed to the global competition in Kansas City after placing first in a regional competition and second in a state competition. The team, deemed “Dill Pickles,” explored issues of inflation and climate change through a rearranged fairy tale. Find out what's happening in San Ramonwith free, real-time updates from Patch.

    "title": "Solo Leveling is an invitingly dark must watch",
    "text": "The popular South Korean webcomic Solo Leveling has finally made the transition to screen and – after a lengthy wait – fans won't be disappointed. Solo Leveling was first introduced to fans back in 2015 as a Korean web novel written by Chugong. It was later adapted into a webtoon and Manhwa in 2018 amassing a massive following worldwide. Now, after nearly a decade the creators' attempts to bring the world of super-powered hunters versus hordes of monsters to anime form has resulted in something invitingly dark and exciting. So what are you in for if you’re unfamiliar with the source material?The anime's main protagonist Sung Jin-woo serves as the underdog with heart. Weaker than the other hunters, Jin-woo finds himself desperate to embark on these life-threatening missions not to prove himself for glory but so that he can support his family with money he receives from them.His try-hard attitude and sacrificial character traits are a delicate balance to get right and could easily come off as cheesy, and yet there is something endearing about the way in which they show up that cause you to root for him instead of roll your eyes.And Jin-woo will need all the rooting-for you can muster, as his journey opens up Solo Leveling's thickly gory, dramatic world laced with mystery. The show's focus for the first couple of episodes is, in part, on world building which here means quite a lot of info dumping interspersed between the action. It's a clunky storytelling approach but not unusual for the genre and Solo Leveling more than makes up for any slower moments with graphic action sequences that are guaranteed to keep you on edge. While its gruesome visuals deliver a thrilling shock factor thanks to the stunning art direction, they are anything but baseless carnage. Solo Leveling backs up dismemberment of limbs and slicing bodies in half by quickly building emotional connections to the characters and exploring their relationships with one another and their motivation for taking the risks they do. The pacing feels spot on when the danger becomes more pronounced, thanks to the way the show makes a habit of cutting to scenes showing characters’ personal lives outside of their mission. So far it is a compelling start with plenty of intrigue to build upon – and perfect to fill that monster-fighting hole in your heart while we wait for the next instalments of Jujutsu Kaisen and Demon Slayer.Solo Leveling will be available to watch weekly on Crunchyroll from the 6th January.",

    "text": "Ambulance Officers Vote To Strike Again After Rejecting Ratification Of St John Offer Around 1,100 FIRST Union ambulance officers have voted for a second withdrawal of labour at Hato Hone St John, which will take place on the 27th and 30th of September for the first six hours of rostered shifts across the country. The strike action commences at 4am on both dates and continues for 24 hours each time. Ambulance officers have this week voted to reject ratification of a pay offer from St John for 17 months, which included minimal pay increases below the rate of inflation (3.25% for 12 months and 3% for 7 months) and failed to address any other concerns around conditional parity with other health workers. Faye McCann, FIRST Union national ambulance organiser, said that the message from politicians and St John appeared to be that ambulance officers should take an effective pay cut while waiting until the expiry of the current 4-year funding agreement in 2026 before the Government would reassess funding needs. \"There is no way in hell that ambulance officers can wait til 2026 for a fair pay offer - a massive exodus to other health roles will continue and the service will be fundamentally crippled by then,\" said Ms McCann. \"FIRST Union rejected the offer by a large margin and have voted for a longer second unpaid withdrawal of labour that aims to communicate the urgent need for funding fair pay increases.\" Ms McCann said ambulance officers were confused and disappointed by the political situation surrounding funding, with health Ministers Reti and Costello still absent from view and providing no leadership. She said that [St John CEO Peter Bradley recently circulated an internal blog to all staff](http://firstunion.org.nz/hawkfile/1318/original/SJBradleyBlog.pdf) confirming that \"This message has taken some getting through to politicians, despite sending at least four letters and having five face-to-face meetings with Cabinet Ministers and the Prime Minister in recent months. As I said to a senior Health New Zealand official this week, hearing in the media that we do not want to be 100% funded for all our ambulance service operating costs is simply not correct!\" Ms McCann said the blog had frustrated ambulance officers. \"It’s nice to say for St John but hard to hear for ambulance officers - Peter Bradley knows there’s a major funding gap and critical need, but St John have been ineffective in persuading politicians of the urgency for fully funding ambulance service operational costs now,\" said Ms McCann. \"Prime Minister Chris Luxon is also clearly aware and comfortable with the fact that ambulance officers are at breaking point but will pursue an austerity strategy for health funding that will decimate our emergency response capacity.\" On Wednesday and Thursday this week, FIRST Union delegates at St John hosted a conference with Australian ambulance officers from the Australasian Council of Ambulance Unions to share knowledge and information about similar issues across the Tasman. \"Australian ambulance officers were appalled to hear that St John relies on charity funding in Aotearoa and noted that the worst management of the ambulance service in Australia tends to occur in the states where St John is the provider, like Western Australia and the Northern Territory,\" said Ms McCann. \"We cannot push the boat out to 2026 on funding for a failing health service that we all depend on during the most serious and severe events of our lives.\" \"There will be no experienced ambulance officers left to negotiate with by 2026.\" Ms McCann confirmed that FIRST Union would again enter negotiations over a Life Preserving Services Agreement (LPS) with St John for the upcoming withdrawal of labour to ensure minimum emergency response capacity for serious incidents. \"To get a picture of how bad things are right now, the last LPS we negotiated with St John actually led to higher staffing levels on strike days than on many ordinary shifts,\" said Ms McCann. \"That implies that St John’s regular staffing levels on ordinary workdays are not high enough to ensure a minimum life-saving capacity - until they vote to go on strike.\"",

    "text": "(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)\nAnnalisa Bracco , Georgia Institute of Technology\n(THE CONVERSATION) The oceans are heating up as the planet warms.\nThis past year, 2024, was the warmest ever measured for the global ocean, following a record-breaking 2023. In fact, every decade since 1984, when satellite recordkeeping of ocean temperatures started, has been warmer than the previous one .\nA warmer ocean means increased evaporation, which in turn results in heavier rains in some areas and droughts in others. It can power hurricanes and downpours. It can also harm the health of coastal marine areas and sea life – coral reefs suffered their most extensive bleaching event on record in 2024 , with damage in many parts of the world.\nWarming ocean water also affects temperatures on land by changing weather patterns. The EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service announced on Jan. 10 that data showed 2024 was also the warmest year globally , with global temperatures about 2.9 degrees Fahrenheit (1.6 Celsius) above pre-industrial times, marking the first full calender year with warming above 1.5 C.\nClimate change, by and large, takes the blame. Greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere trap heat, and about 90% of the excess heat caused by emissions from burning fossil fuels and other human activities is absorbed by the ocean.\nBut while it’s clear that the ocean has been warming for quite some time, its temperatures over the past two years have been far above the previous decades. That leaves two mysteries for scientists.\nIt’s not just El Niño\nThe cyclic climate pattern of the El Niño Southern Oscillation can explain part of the warmth over the past two years.\nDuring El Niño periods , warm waters that usually accumulate in the western equatorial Pacific Ocean move eastward toward the coastlines of Peru and Chile, leaving the Earth slightly warmer overall. The latest El Niño began in 2023 and caused global average temperatures to rise well into early 2024 .\nBut the oceans have been even warmer than scientists expected. For example, global temperatures in 2023-2024 followed a similar growth and decline pattern across the seasons as the previous El Niño event, in 2015-2016, but they were about 0.36 degrees Fahrenheit (0.2 Celsius) higher at all times in 2023-2024.\nScientists are puzzled and left with two problems to solve. They must figure out whether something else contributed to the unexpected warming and whether the past two years have been a sign of a sudden acceleration in global warming.\nThe role of aerosols\nAn intriguing idea, tested using climate models, is that a swift reduction in aerosols over the past decade may be one of the culprits.\nAerosols are solid and liquid particles emitted by human and natural sources into the atmosphere. Some of them have been shown to partially counteract the impact of greenhouse gases by reflecting solar radiation back into space. However, they also are responsible for poor air quality and air pollution.\nMany of these particles with cooling properties are generated in the process of burning fossil fuels. For example, sulfur aerosols are emitted by ship engines and power plants. In 2020, the shipping industry implemented a nearly 80% cut in sulfur emissions , and many companies shifted to low-sulfur fuels. But the larger impact has come from power plants reducing their emissions, including a big shift in this direction in China. So, while technologies have cut these harmful emissions, that means a brake slowing the pace of warming is weakened.\nIs this a warming surge?\nThe second puzzle is whether the planet is seeing a warming surge or not.\nTemperatures are clearly rising, but the past two years have not been warm enough to support the notion that we may be seeing an acceleration in the rate of global warming.\nAnalysis of four temperature datasets covering the 1850-2023 period has shown that the rate of warming has not shown a significant change since around the 1970s. The same authors, however, noted that only a rate increase of at least 55% – about half a degree Celsius and nearly a full degree Fahrenheit over one year – would make the warming acceleration detectable in a statistical sense.\nFrom a statistical standpoint, then, scientists cannot exclude the possibility that the 2023-2024 record ocean warming resulted simply from the “usual” warming trend that humans have set the planet on for the past 50 years. A very strong El Niño contributed some natural variability.\nFrom a practical standpoint, however, the extraordinary impacts the planet has witnessed – including extreme weather, heat waves, wildfires, coral bleaching and ecosystem destruction – point to a need to swiftly reduce carbon dioxide emissions to limit ocean warming, regardless of whether this is a continuation of an ongoing trend or an acceleration.\nThis article has been updated with Copernicus Climate Change Service’s global 2024 temperature data.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

    "text": "Salud\nUn cuento infantil desvela la epilepsia a través de las estrellas\nLa neuropediatra Patricia Smeyers, del Hospital La Fe de València, ha creado un universo infantil donde los diferentes personajes encarnan las epilepsias más atípicas, para divulgar sobre esta dolencia y eliminar los estigmas\nMiriam Bouiali\nCon el objetivo de desestigmatizar una [enfermedad ](/es/temas/enfermedades-5160)como la epilepsia y hacerla comprensible tanto a mayores como pequeños, sale a la luz \"El universo de las estrellas mágicas\", un cuento creado por la doctora Patricia Smeyers, responsable del área de Epilepsia de la sección de Neuropediatría del Hospital Universitario y Politécnico La Fe de València, e ilustrado por la joven artista Noa Smeyers.\nEl cuento sigue la aventura de Frintina, una robot que viaja por el oscuro espacio y lo ilumina con su linterna mágica. En el viaje, encuentra estrellas como Dravetina o Lenoxina, que representan, respectivamente, las formas epilépticas infantiles poco frecuentes de Dravet y Lennox-Gastaut. Junto a ellas, el cuento también comparte conocimientos sobre otras convertidas en más estrellas: Westina, por el síndrome de West; Esclerosina, por la Esclerosis Tuberosa, o Sturgewerina, por el síndrome de Sturge Weber.\nTodas ellas, encefalopatías epilépticas del desarrollo (EED): formas poco frecuentes de epilepsia que se inician en los primeros años o meses de vida de los pacientes. A través de una historia entretenida y tiernas ilustraciones, el cuento refleha cómo son las distintas encefalopatías, las crisis epilépticas que provocan, por qué suceden y cómo se pueden controlar. Entre otras cosas, detalla el papel del ADN, el uso de los electroencefalogramas para detectar la actividad eléctrica neuronal o las características de las diferentes crisis epilépticas que provocan.\nEl universo de las estrellas mágicas no es la primera historia de la doctora Smeyers. Empezó a escribir relatos sobre la epilepsia hace 15 años, como \"La pócima de las ausencias\", \"El baile de gigante\", \"El bosque de las tormentas\" o \"El laberinto circular\", aunque en esta ocasión centra la narración en los tipos menos conocidos. Como detalla, el objetivo es «contar con material para explicar las epilepsias a los niños, porque no hay nada dirigido a ellos» pero también «que pueda servir para los mayores, para los padres, madres, profesores y demás cuidadores». Se inspira, como reconoce, en historias como \"El Principito\" de Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, que hace reflexionar a todas las edades.\n\"Con este cuento quería explicar el origen de este tipo de epilepsias muy raras, poco frecuentes pero graves, difíciles de controlar, que se sufren desde muy pequeños y se arrastran durante toda la vida. Son muy desconocidas y poco estudiadas pero, poco a poco y con los avances de la genética, hay terapias cada vez más avanzadas\", indica Smeyers.\nEl \"lenguaje del cuento\" para concienciar\nPara ello utiliza la magia, personajes llamativos y, como ella lo llama, \"el lenguaje del cuento\" para \"intentar explicar lo complicado de una forma simple y, siempre, con una moraleja final positiva». Aunque indica que \"poco a poco va cambiando\", la doctora de La Fe es consciente de que la epilepsia «es una enfermedad muy estigmatizada», hecho que lamenta y que también le anima a escribir los cuentos. \"Quiero dar un poco de luz con un lenguaje positivo, para que la epilepsia no sea vista de manera negativa, que no genere rechazo en la población, porque donde hay conocimiento hay menos miedo y estigma\", asegura.\nCon esta visión menos negativa y más integradora, Smeyers asegura que el feedback que recibe siempre es positivo. \"Va más allá de ser un folleto informativo adaptado a los niños… a la gente le encanta la historia, gustan mucho los dibujos, los mayores también lo leen, los piden en las escuelas para trabajarlo en clase y que la enfermedad sea más conocida… Se acoge de una manera muy positiva porque el cuento resulta útil\", explica.\nTambién da importancia al hecho de que los más pequeños que conviven con esta enfermedad \"se sienten protagonistas\" y, entre otras cosas, «entienden que deben tomarse la medicación».\nEl cuento se presentó recientemente en el Colegio de Médicos de València y ha sido impulsado por la biofarmacéutica UCB, con el aval de la Sociedad Española de Neurología Pediátrica (Senep) y la Federación Española de Epilepsia (Fede), como el resto de historias publicadas anteriormente. Se puede descargar a través de la web https://vivirconepilepsia.es, gratuitamente.\n\"Mi objetivo era crear una herramienta que no solo informara de manera entretenida, sino que también transmitiera empatía y mostrara que detrás de cada diagnóstico hay historias llenas de luz, valentía y resiliencia\", concluye la doctora. En España, la epilepsia afecta a unas 400.000 personas, y de los nuevos casos que se detectan, el 40 % son en menores de 15 años.\n[RRSS WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Un%20cuento%20infantil%20desvela%20la%20epilepsia%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20las%20estrellas%20https://www.epe.es/es/sociedad/20241226/cuento-infantil-desvela-epilepsia-traves-112931023%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.epe.es/es/sociedad/20241226/cuento-infantil-desvela-epilepsia-traves-112931023%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https://www.epe.es/es/sociedad/20241226/cuento-infantil-desvela-epilepsia-traves-112931023&text=Un%20cuento%20infantil%20desvela%20la%20epilepsia%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20las%20estrellas%20%20https://www.epe.es/es/sociedad/20241226/cuento-infantil-desvela-epilepsia-traves-112931023%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20%40elperiodico_Esp)\n[RRSS email](mailto:?subject=Un%20cuento%20infantil%20desvela%20la%20epilepsia%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20las%20estrellas%20&body=https://www.epe.es/es/sociedad/20241226/cuento-infantil-desvela-epilepsia-traves-112931023%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[Copiar URL](javascript: void(0))\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil",

    "text": "Schools\nNew Pediatric Nursing Scholarship at Quinnipiac University\nOn the 18th Anniversary of the Cheshire Home Invasion Murders: New Pediatric Nursing Scholarship at Quinnipiac University Honors Legacy\nPress release\nNew Pediatric Nursing Scholarship at Quinnipiac University Honors Legacy of Jennifer Hawke-Petit\nHAMDEN - A new endowed scholarship at Quinnipiac University’s School of Nursing will honor the life and legacy of Jennifer Lynn Hawke-Petit, a dedicated pediatric nurse who with her daughters, Hayley and Michaela, were the victims of a brutal triple-murder in their Cheshire home on July 23, 2007.\nThe Petit Family Foundation has established the Jennifer L. Hawke-Petit Pediatric Nursing Scholarship with a $100,000 gift, announced by Foundation President Dr. William A. Petit, Jr. Quinnipiac University will match the gift by 50%, creating a lasting source of support for nursing students with financial need who share Hawke-Petit’s commitment to pediatric care.\nNamed in honor of his late wife, Petit said Quinnipiac was a natural choice for the scholarship.\n“I felt it was a chance to align with a high-quality nursing program, and that this was a good opportunity and time to do that,” Petit said. “Jennifer loved pediatric nursing with a passion, and I thought it would be nice to help out others interested in that area who are studying at Quinnipiac.”\nA member of the Quinnipiac School of Nursing Advisory Council, Petit praised the leadership of School of Nursing Dean Larry Z. Slater and said the program’s quality made it the right home for the scholarship.\nSlater noted that the scholarship addresses an urgent need in health care.\n“The current nursing workforce shortage has also significantly impacted pediatric care, as demonstrated by expanding pediatric vacancies that lead to longer wait times, be it in pediatric hospital settings or in primary care,” said Slater. “The Jennifer L. Hawke-Petit Pediatric Nursing Scholarship will assist the Quinnipiac University School of Nursing in addressing the shortage. The financial assistance, along with the school's commitment to building nurse leaders of the future, will allow us to significantly impact children across the care continuum.”\nThroughout her career, Hawke-Petit was known for her warmth, collaborative spirit, and deep commitment to patient care. Lisa M. Rebeschi, senior associate dean of the School of Nursing at Quinnipiac, said the scholarship carries deep personal meaning.\n“As a student, I had a clinical placement on a pediatric unit Jennifer managed,” Rebeschi said. “I clearly remember the feeling of wanting to be a pediatric nurse just like her.”\nRebeschi later worked alongside Hawke-Petit at Yale New Haven Hospital and said she inspired countless nursing staff with her professionalism and grace.\n“Jennifer loved taking care of kids, but she also loved teaching,” said Petit. “She was a team player who made everyone feel part of the team.”\nThe Petit Family Foundation, established in 2007, supports causes that reflect the interests and values of Hawke-Petit and the couple’s late daughters, Hayley and Michaela.\n“If you could train even one person a year, and they have a 25-year career, they can impact a lot of people. You get a big multiplier effect,” Petit said. “We hope to continue this scholarship with support from the Petit Family Foundation, from Quinnipiac University, and from others interested in supporting pediatric nursing.”\nSlater said the university is honored to help preserve Hawke-Petit’s legacy.\n“We are grateful to the Petit Family Foundation for supporting the future of pediatric nursing in honor of Jennifer,” Slater said. “Her legacy will continue to inspire our students as they pursue their passion to serve our communities' children.”",
