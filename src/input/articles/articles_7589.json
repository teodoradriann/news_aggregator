    "title": "ICC Helps 3 Siblings Persecuted by Cult Members in Uganda",
    "text": "5/31/2024 Uganda (International Christian Concern) — Three siblings caught up in the Faith of Unity cult in Uganda were beaten after putting their faith in Jesus Christ.\nTereza, Usama, and Dembe grew up in the cultic church known as Itambiriro. The cult was founded by Desteo Bisaka, also known as “Owobushobozi,” which means “the Almighty One.” He believed that he was God. He died in 2021 at the age of 90 from the coronavirus.\nAccording to Bisaka’s teachings, Jesus was “a liar” who “didn’t exist.” Bisaka often criticized Christianity and at least once called on his followers to burn Bibles. Followers of the cult are only allowed to attend their church service twice a year and are encouraged to cast spells and use magic charms, Tereza said. At least 5 million people reportedly belong to the cult, which boasts more than 1,000 places of worship in Uganda, Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Tanzania.\nOn December 10, 2023, area Christians visited Tereza, Usama, and Dembe and taught them about Jesus Christ. The siblings decided to accept Christ as their savior. Once word spread about their conversion to Christianity, elders from the Itambiriro church went to the siblings’ home and beat them with canes.\n“The canes were given to us as a sign of judgment,” Usama said. The children were then later forced to leave their community without any money, housing, or education.\n“We have seen the light of Jesus, and nothing shall separate us from the love of Jesus,” Tereza added. “We pray that God should change (the followers of Bisaka) so that they can know Christ.”\nInternational Christian Concern (ICC) found the girls when they were living with a Christian family in a town called Kasese. ICC helped cover their school fees, meal plans, books and school uniforms, bedding, clothing, and toiletries. They are now enrolled in school and are thriving.\n“I am happy to express my deepest gratitude for your incredible generosity and support towards my education,” Tereza said. “Your kindness in paying for my school fees and providing me with educational materials and clothing has had a significant impact on my life. I am truly blessed to have people like you who believe in the power of education and are willing to invest in my future.”\nUsama is now staying with a Christian teacher at a local preparatory school where he is studying. Dembe is living with another believer while he attends primary school. Tereza is living on campus at a secondary school.\nNow that these siblings can attend Christian schools, they can have a future and grow in their relationships with Christ without fear of persecution.\nIf you would like to support other students like Tereza, Usama, and Dembe, learn more about ICC’s Generation Transformation fund.\nTo read more news stories, visit the ICC Newsroom .

    "text": "Security authorities are reinforcing road surveillance after up to six traffic accidents were recorded in one week in December, involving cars and motorcycles in Tucupita. According to the statements of the governor of Delta Amacuro, Lizeta Hernández, this Thursday, the Secretariat of Citizen Security has deployed new mobile control points to influence the use of helmets in the case of motorized vehicles, the seat belt and the permitted speeds, as well as the retention of vehicles with drivers under the influence of alcohol. Hernández reported that these road safety points are in strategic places in Tucupita, where more accidents usually occur, such as on the national highway of the capital of the Delta. In one week, six traffic accidents were recorded in Tucupita, with no fatalities so far, but with material losses to third parties. Motorcycles until 10 p.m. The Secretary of Security and Public Order of the Delta Amacuro state, Noel Valderrama, reiterated that motorized vehicles can circulate until 10 p.m., if they do not have any permit or endorsement indicating that they can do so. Any required authorization must be managed by the offices of this entity. The measure seeks to reduce the so-called motorcycle crashes, irresponsible alcohol consumption and speeds not permitted by motorized vehicles. Mobilization by land terminal Arnold Suárez, sole tourism authority for the Delta Amacuro state, reported this Thursday that the Tucupita and Casacoima land terminals continue to operate “receiving families who return to the Delta for vacation” during the Christmas and New Year festivities. Thus, it maintains a data of about three thousand users who have traveled between December 24 and December 28 only through this land terminal. The enabled routes are to and from Caracas, Ciudad Guayana, Valencia, Maturín, Casacoima and Uracoa, with prices that have not changed despite the season.",

    "text": "México|\n¿Cuándo comienzan las olas de calor en México este 2025?\nEste año será uno de los más calurosos en la historia de México\nEl Instituto de Ciencias de la Atmósfera y Cambio Climático de la UNAM ha alertado que este año será uno de los más calurosos en la historia de México. El pronóstico indica que las temperaturas podrían mantenerse elevadas durante varios meses, afectando a diversas regiones del país. Ante esto, el instituto recomienda a la población estar preparada para soportar el calor extremo.\nEl incremento en las temperaturas puede generar consecuencias graves para la salud, desde deshidratación hasta golpes de calor severos. Las autoridades instan a la ciudadanía a tomar precauciones para evitar estos riesgos. Entre las recomendaciones destacan el mantenerse hidratado y evitar la exposición directa al sol durante las horas más intensas del día.\nPara hacer frente al calor en el hogar, los expertos sugieren varias estrategias. Aunque el uso de ventiladores y aire acondicionado ayuda a bajar la temperatura, también incrementa el consumo energético. Por ello, se aconseja aprovechar la ventilación cruzada, mantener cerradas las habitaciones que reciben sol directo y colocar plantas que ayuden a mitigar el calor, como el helecho o la 'lengua de tigre'.\nLa UNAM anticipa la llegada de cuatro olas de calor consecutivas, que comenzarán en la tercera semana de marzo y podrían extenderse hasta octubre. Los estados del norte, como Sonora, Sinaloa y Baja California, serán los más afectados. Estas olas de calor son consecuencia del cambio climático, impulsado por el aumento de las emisiones de dióxido de carbono y la mala planificación urbana.\nSV\nRecibe las últimas noticias en tu e-mail\nTodo lo que necesitas saber para comenzar tu día\nRegistrarse implica aceptar los Términos y Condiciones",
