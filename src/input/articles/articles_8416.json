Before this, he spent four seasons with the Montreal Canadiens .\nAd The Maple Leafs are the second “Original Six” team Pezzetta will represent in his relatively young career. He acknowledges the responsibility and high expectations that come with playing for such storied franchises and recognizes the challenge of meeting them.\nPezzetta expressed that he’s focused on putting in the work to earn his spot:\n\"Now, it’s about putting in the work and earning my spot. I am excited for that. It’s easier to push harder on the bike and in the gym that’s my happy place, anyway and it lights a fire under you. It’s still surreal,\" Pezzetta said via NHLPA. Ad Trending He noted that the atmosphere in Toronto mirrors that of Montreal, both being large markets with intense pressure and lofty expectations, which he attributes to Canada's 32-year Stanley Cup drought.\n\"It’s the same as Montreal, it is a big market, there is pressure and expectations are high. But that makes sense and that’s what makes it so great to play in these types of cities. I’m embracing every bit of it,\" he added. Ad Michael Pezzetta was drafted 160th overall by the Montreal Canadiens in the 2016 NHL draft. He appeared in 200 games for the clubs, racking up 38 points through 15 goals and 23 assists. Last season, the 27-year-old appeared in 25 regular-season games but did not register a point.\nMichael Pezzetta reveals his favorite player growing up Michael Pezzetta revealed in the interview that his favorite player growing up was Toronto Maple Leafs legend Mats Sundin, whom he considered his boyhood idol.\nAd The Leafs forward shared that he had pictures of Sundin in his room and owned his jerseys.\n\"Mats Sundin was always my favourite player growing up,” said Pezzetta. “I had his pictures in my room, jerseys things like that. I remember his 500th goal, coming across the blue line and blasting a slap shot home, far side, for the overtime winner, and a hat trick. It was a great memory.” Ad NHLPA @NHLPA Growing up idolizing former @MapleLeafs captain Mats Sundin and chasing down NHL stars, Toronto-born Michael Pezzetta is eager to hit the ice with his childhood team this October ⤵️ Ad Sundin served as Maple Leafs captain from 1997 to 2008, making him the longest-serving captain in franchise history. He finished his career as the club's all-time leader in goals (420) and points (987).\nAlso Read: NHL analyst snubs Mats Sundin for ex-Raptor Kyle Lowry as most valuable Toronto athlete in last quarter century\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?

    "title": "Czech court rules Nikhil Gupta can be extradited to US",
    "text": "Prague: A Czech high court has ruled that Indian national Nikhil Gupta, detained in a prison here on murder-for-hire charges in an alleged assassination attempt on a Khalistani extremist on American soil, can be extradited to the US, according to local media reports. Gupta, 52, was charged by US federal prosecutors in an indictment unsealed in November last year with working with an Indian government employee in an alleged plot to kill Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who holds dual US and Canadian citizenships, on American soil. Gupta, arrested in the Czech Republic on June 30 last year, is currently held in Prague’s Pankrak prison. The Prague High Court confirmed in a closed session that Gupta can be extradited to the US, the Seznam.cz web portal reported on Friday. The Prague High Court’s order came as it rejected Gupta’s appeal against a December decision by a lower court that ruled that extradition was allowed. A spokesman for the Prague High Court declined to immediately comment. “We have not yet confirmed that the resolution has been delivered to all procedural parties, for that reason we cannot comment on the decision in more detail,” Katerina Kolarova, the spokeswoman of the Prague High Court, said. Minister of Justice Pavel Blazek now has the final say on whether Gupta will be extradited to the US. He has yet to give his consent to the extradition, the portal reported. “Justice Minister Pavel Blazek will decide later whether or not to allow Gupta’s extradition to the US,” Czech Justice Ministry spokesman Vladimir Repka was quoted as saying by news.eseuro.com. Repka added that the timeframe of the minister’s decision cannot be predicted. “If the Minister of Justice has doubts about the correctness of the court’s decision in a given matter, he can submit a motion to the Supreme Court to review their decision within three months from the day the matter was submitted to the Ministry,” added Repka. Gupta’s lawyer Petr Slepicka at the Prague High Court said they will still file a complaint with the Constitutional Court. “We will file a constitutional complaint and at the same time we will ask the Minister of Justice not to extradite my client to the US,” said Slepicka. Gupta claimed that his case had a political or military background. In the indictment, US investigators claimed that Gupta was hired by an Indian government agent. According to Slepicka, it was supposed to be a “task” most likely financed by the Indian government. But the High Court rejected this claim. According to Judge Vladimir Kral, this case cannot be viewed as a political case. “It is absurd to think that a state that presents itself as democratic and governed by the legal order and international treaties would choose such means as the murder of a citizen of another state on its territory to solve its problems and in time of peace,” the portal quoted the judge as saying. A US judge this month denied a request for defence materials by Gupta, saying he has not yet been arraigned (in America) in this case, and the government is currently seeking his extradition from the Czech Republic to the United States. India has already constituted a probe committee to investigate the allegations.",

    "text": "Skyhawks Lose Close Match vs Southeast Missouri Despite Grullon’s 31 Points\nThe University of Tennessee at Martin men's basketball team lost to Southeast Missouri, 90-79, despite Josué Grullon's standout performance of 31 points. Grullon, a junior guard, also contributed 8 rebounds and maintained a perfect free-throw record, going 12-for-12. The Skyhawks were unable to overcome a significant second-half deficit, despite trimming it down to seven points late in the game. Southeast Missouri had a strong team showing with five players scoring in double figures, including Braxton Stacker's 19 points. Skyhawks' head coach Jeremy Shulman emphasized the need to compete and the challenges of the competitive Ohio Valley Conference.\n- Josué Grullon scored a career-high 31 points.\n- UT Martin shot 53.3% (32-for-60) from the field overall.\n- Southeast Missouri shot 63.5% (33-for-52) from the field.\n- Grullon achieved 12-for-12 from the free-throw line, just two makes shy of the school record.\nWhile Grullon's performance was remarkable, the Skyhawks struggled overall, particularly in defending against Southeast Missouri's high shooting percentage. Coach Shulman's acknowledgment of the team's readiness highlights a broader issue of consistency in performance against top-tier opponents.\nState of Play- The loss puts UT Martin at 9-13 overall and 5-6 in the Ohio Valley Conference.\n- Southeast Missouri improves to 12-10 overall and 7-4 in the OVC.\n- UT Martin fought back from a 19-point deficit but could not close the gap in the final moments.\nThe Skyhawks are set to face Little Rock on February 1, with the game nationally televised on ESPNU. This matchup provides an opportunity for UT Martin to rebound and showcase their skills against a different opponent.\nBottom LineDespite Grullon's impressive scoring, the Skyhawks must enhance their overall team performance to compete more effectively within the Ohio Valley Conference. Consistency and defensive strategies will be critical in their upcoming games.\nRead more at UTM Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
