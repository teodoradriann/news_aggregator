    "text": "Campaign to increase Arizona minimum wage plans to withdraw ballot measure The group backing a ballot measure seeking to raise the state’s minimum wage intends to pull the proposal from consideration to focus its resources on pushing a similar measure through the Arizona Legislature next year. One Fair Wage and Raise the Wage AZ turned in about 354,000 signatures to the Secretary of State’s Office in July — just under 100,000 more than the 256,000 it needed to qualify for the ballot. That’s a relatively small cushion for the campaign, because those signatures still need to undergo a verification process by election officials who will ensure those who signed petitions for the proposal were legally eligible to do so. One Fair Wage is also facing a lawsuit filed by the Arizona Restaurant Association that is seeking to invalidate a bulk of the signatures it gathered. Jim Barton, an attorney for the campaign, said One Fair Wage has decided to withdraw its signatures due to the likelihood it wouldn’t qualify for the ballot. “You get to the point where you say, ‘We see where this is going,’ and you don’t want counties to expend resources on this,” Barton said, referring to the county election officials who must verify the campaign’s petition signatures. Rather than spend resources on costly litigation defending the ballot measure, Barton said the campaign would rather use its resources “in other ways to improve lives for working people.” That includes backing state and federal legislation to raise the state’s minimum wage, according to a press release. According to the release, the group plans to back a bill next year sponsored by Rep. Marianna Sandoval, a Goodyear Democrat running for re-election to the Arizona House of Representatives. “I will never stop trying to lift hard-working Arizonans out of poverty, and this legislation will be a game-changer to raise the minimum wage for all workers and also end the subminimum wage for tipped workers,” Sandoval said in a statement. In a statement, Saru Jayaraman, president of One Fair Wage, said the group will now shift its focus to supporting candidates who pledge to back the measure. The shift comes as Democrats seek to take control of one or both chambers in the Arizona Legislature, which would likely be necessary if Sandoval’s forthcoming legislation has any chance to pass. This year, Republicans lawmakers unanimously voted for a competing ballot measure backed by the Arizona Restaurant Association that would let businesses pay tipped workers 25% less than the minimum wage if they can prove the worker would be making the minimum wage plus $2 including tips. Barton, One Fair Wage’s attorney, says the group will also continue its efforts to challenge that measure. A trial court judge recently [allowed the Republican measure to remain on the ballot](https://www.kjzz.org/kjzz-news/2024-08-07/competing-measures-on-tipped-workers-will-remain-on-arizona-ballot), a ruling Barton says they will appeal. Though One Fair Wage announced plans to withdraw its ballot proposal, the signature verification process will continue for the time being. The Secretary of State’s office said it needs a court order to officially withdraw the campaign’s signatures from the verification process, which is expected to wrap up on Aug. 22. Barton said he is still working on the next steps the campaign must take to officially withdraw the ballot measure.",

    "title": "'An Urgent Public Health Necessity' - National Institute for Play Releases New Report Underlining Science and Power of Play",
    "text": "CARMEL VALLEY, Calif. , Feb. 29, 2024 /CNW/ -- Amid complex global events and an ongoing mental health crisis, experts at the California -based National Institute for Play (NIFP) released today a comprehensive new report on the biology, benefits, and modern interpretations of play.\nThe free report, entitled The Power of Play: Losing and Finding Ourselves through Everyday Play, advances the understanding that play is proven to lead to healthier, happier lives. Its authors, Scott G. Eberle , Ph.D., and Stuart Brown , M.D., have spent decades studying the impact of play on the human condition. Joining their expertise, the 50-page academic summary brings together findings and observations of more than 100 scholars from a wide array of fields. It collectively asserts that the diminishing presence of play in our daily lives is an urgent public health matter.\n\"The pandemic and its aftermath, our nation's extreme political polarization, global geopolitical conflicts and the climate crisis contribute to unprecedented, widespread levels of anxiety, depression, addiction, and hopelessness. Play is part of the solution,\" Dr. Brown writes in the Foreword.\nHighlights include:\nAncient in its origins, play is core to the human experience and is engrained in all of us. People already know how to play; the important thing is how to activate it. \"And when we do, our lives change for the better in surprising and far-reaching ways,\" the report outlines. Scientists maintain that similar to sleep, play is a critical component for a healthy, complex life – acting as a key variable in our evolutionary adaptability. Regardless of one's age, play is important to our well-being – physical, social and emotional. Scientifically, when someone plays, their brain \"lights up\" – establishing neural pathways that create opportunities for pleasure and joy. Over time, this leads to the development of self awareness, vocabulary, belonging, and socialization, while also reducing stress, increasing physical activity, and delivering several other benefits. Dr. Brown likens a lifetime of play with keeping one's immunizations up to date. According to the report, play has a protective effect against emotional rigidity, isolation, loneliness, and depression. The time we spend playing should be seen as an investment not an expenditure. Based on thousands of interviews, the authors have identified eight styles of play. Most people embody a mix of these types, with one dominant style coming to the forefront from infancy: Collector, Competitor, Creator, Director, Explorer, Joker, Kinesthete/Mover, and Storyteller. In the paper's Afterword, Dr. Eberle outlines the power of travel as an activator for play. It \"deepens the emotions, fuels the imagination, sharpens the perspective, enlarges the social understanding, and inspires the heart.\" In essence, travel gives people freedom and license to play their own way. The report was produced by NIFP with support by Visit California and contributors Anthony Christopher , Lauren Sundstrom, Bowen F. White , and Tom Norquist .

    "text": "A rally was taken out by contract Staff Nurses, demanding regularisation of their services and withdrawal of the G.O. 115, from the King George Hospital (KGH) to the Clock Tower at Jagadmaba junction and back, here on Friday.\nThe participants said that they had completed Nursing degree/ PG and were working for years as contract staff nurses. They had even rendered services during the COVID-19 pandemic. They alleged that an attempt was being made to promote Auxilliary Nurse Midwifes (ANMs) as ‘Staff Nurses’ ignoring the services of the contract staff nurses.\nStruggle Committee leader B. Santhi Kumari alleged that during the previous government, ANMs, who were posted at the grama sachivalayams, were given some basic training as multi purpose health workers. Now, it was proposed to post these ANMs in the regular vacancies as ‘staff nurses’, ignoring the contract staff nurses.\nThe protesting contract staff nurses demanded that the State government scrap G.O. 115 and ensure that justice was done to them. They reportedly met Speaker Ch. Ayyanna Patrudu and apprised him of the issue and he had advised them to meet Special Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare) M.T. Krishna Babu.\nContract Staff Nurses State Committee coordinator G. Koteswara Rao, who led the protest, demanded that G.O. 115, issued by the Health and Family Welfare department, be withdrawn. He said that there were 11,500 staff nurses, working on contract basis in the State. They included those who completed their degree/ PG in Nursing, and some of them had even completed their Ph.D.\nPublished - September 13, 2024 05:00 pm IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

La primera fue Jutta Kleinschmidt en 2001, en motos.\nMIRA:\n[¿Lo borró? Jorge Fossati habla sobre el futuro de Oliver Sonne en la Selección Peruana]\nGutiérrez salía segunda a la última etapa del Dakar 2024 con unos 25 minutos de desventaja respecto a Mitchell Guthrie (Taurus), quien era líder virtual de la carrera.\nSin embargo, una avería en el turbo que le llevó a estar parado durante más de 23 minutos primero y otra parada después por otro problema mecánico acabaron dando la victoria a la piloto española.\nEn la línea de meta, mientras esperaba a conocer si había superado en la clasificación al norteamericano, Gutiérrez resaltó a los medios españoles que había salido “a fondo”, porque sabía que, aunque era difícil, “todo podía pasar”, como así sucedió, máxime en su última etapa en la categoría.\nDe hecho, el estadounidense terminó perdiendo casi una hora en la etapa de este viernes, puesto que finalmente quedó en segunda posición en la general a 35 minutos y 46 segundos de la burgalesa, que el año pasado finalizó la general en tercera posición.\nEsta era la última participación de Gutiérrez en Challenger, puesto que el año que viene participará en Ultimate en Dacia, en el que compartirá equipo con el francés Sébastien Loeb y el catarí Nasser Al-Attiyah.\nCon información de EFE.\nPerú21 ePaper,\ningresa aquí y pruébalo gratis.",

The products are not designed for hospital beds.\nHealth Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada.\nIt says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund.\nThe recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ.\nNo information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S.\nDrive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued.\nMore than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nCanadian Press health coverage receives support through a partnership with the Canadian Medical Association.
