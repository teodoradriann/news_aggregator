    "text": "Christians gather to observe Good Friday together\nKUALA LUMPUR: On Good Friday, church pews were packed with Christians observing the holy day.\nDean of the St Mary’s Anglican Cathedral here, the Very Reverend Dr Andrew Cheah, said that Good Friday was an important day for Christians nationwide.\n“Good Friday is really important for us, Christians, to remember that Jesus died for us.\nHe said services at the church had started on Maundy Thursday (March 28), followed by Good Friday, Easter Eve and Easter Sunday services.\n“We are having extra services this year because we have to renovate the front part of the church,” he said.\nHe noted that on Maundy Thursday, there were more members attending this year compared to last year due to the public holiday.\nIt is a busy Easter week for church staff and Cheah will only celebrate with his family after Easter.\nReverend Andy Ng said that the turnout for the Good Friday service was around 600 to 700, which was very encouraging.\n“I know many people took half-day leave to attend,” he said.\nDuring the 11am service, the congregation sang hymns as the pipe organ played in the background.\nAttendees read the Scripture together, knelt to confess their sins and listened to reflections shared by the pastors.\n“The season of Lent invites us to contemplate and respond to this great act of salvation through prayer, reading of the Bible, fasting and acts of charity,” said the Right Rev Dr Steven Abarrow in the first reflection session.\nAfter the Good Friday service, the quiet church burst to life as members chatted with one another.\nHot cross buns were distributed and shared as a reminder of the faith.",

    "text": "Photo from Alex Mertz via Unsplash Notre Dame Cornerback Aims to ‘Give God All the Glory’ at CFP Championship By Movieguide® Contributor The Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Ohio State Buckeyes will face off in the College Football National Championship game Monday, Jan. 20, at 7:30 p.m. ET.\nNotre Dame cornerback Christian Gray can’t wait for the big game.\n“A true sophomore from St. Louis, Gray is tied for second on the Fighting Irish with three interceptions (one of which he returned 99 yards for a touchdown against USC),” Sports Spectrum reported . “He’s also now accumulated 32 combined tackles and a forced fumble on the season. Thanks in part to his production, Notre Dame’s defense ranks No. 9 in the country in total yards allowed per game (298.3), No. 2 in passing yards allowed (165.3), and No. 2 in points allowed (14.3). The team that’s No. 1 in all of those categories? The Buckeyes, Notre Dame’s opponent in the national title tilt.”\nFor more inspiring sports stories, check out Sports Spectrum .\nBut Gray isn’t focused on his stats. Instead, he is set on glorifying God.\n“I believe in the path that God gave us and I believe in the path that we’re on,” Gray said in an interview with Access the Walk about God’s purpose for his team this season.\nREAD MORE: NOTRE DAME QB PRAISES GOD FOR ‘DREAM COME TRUE’ SUGAR BOWL WIN\n“We’re human, and sometimes we sin. And just confess to Him…You gotta study [the Bible], you gotta read, you gotta do everything right in the name of the Lord so you could live by Him and be a bridge for others so they can come close to Him,” he added.\nGray also reflected on the moment he gave his life to Jesus.\n“I just hear in my heart and in my mind, like, ‘This is you. Give glory to God. Give glory to God.’ All I hear is that,” he explained . “I felt it in my spirit. I felt whole. I felt warm. I felt like somebody was holding me. And I just keep hearing it. I start crying out of nowhere, and I’m just looking up to God, saying, ‘Thank You, God. I surrender, I surrender, I surrender.’”\nREAD MORE: NOTRE DAME QB KEEPS ‘RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS’ AT THE CENTER",

    "text": "After Super Typhoon Kong-rey forced thousands to flee their homes in the Philippines, a video of high winds lashing trees circulated online in posts falsely claiming it showed the storm. The clip – viewed millions of times on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram – dates back to another typhoon that hit the archipelago nation in September 2024.\n\"PRAY FOR BATANES. Super Typhoon Leon Signal 4,\" read part of the caption alongside the video on Facebook on October 30, 2024, which used the local name for Kong-rey.\nThe 23-second clip -- viewed more than 200,000 times -- shows fierce winds battering trees and houses.\n© AFP\nThe post surfaced as the Philippine state weather bureau warned of \"violent conditions\" in the Batanes islands north of the main island Luzon as Kong-rey passed close by on its way to Taiwan ( archived link ).\nMore than 174,000 people fled their homes in the Philippines due to the typhoon, which came just days after another storm killed at least 145 people, AFP reported ( archived link ).\nKong-rey was packing wind gusts of nearly 260 kilometres per hour (161 miles per hour), according to the US Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( archived link ).\nOther social media users shared the clip alongside similar false claims on Facebook , YouTube and Instagram , garnering more than five million views.\nHowever, the clip emerged online more than four weeks before Kong-rey.\nTyphoon Krathon A reverse image search on Google using a keyframe from the clip, followed by keyword searches, found a high-quality version of the video was posted on Facebook on September 30, 2024 ( archived link ).\n\"Very strong! Typhoon Julian in Batanes,\" read the video's caption, using the Philippine name for Typhoon Krathon.\nThe storm slammed into the remote group of Philippine islands in late September, leaving eight injured and one missing ( archived link ).\nIt also cut power and communications and damaged many houses, AFP reported ( archived link ).\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the circulating footage (left) and the earlier Facebook video of Krathon (right):\n© AFP\nThe Facebook user, who identified herself as Jona Libaton, told AFP the circulating video \"was from Typhoon Julian (Krathon)\".\nShe also shared pictures on Facebook showing the aftermath of Krathon on October 1 ( archived link ).\nA review of her Facebook page found she frequently posted about Batanes and indicated she worked for a homestay there.\nPhilippine broadcaster GMA Public Affairs reshared the footage on its verified TikTok and Facebook pages (archived links here and here ).\nAbout 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Philippines or its surrounding waters each year, damaging homes and infrastructure and killing dozens of people.\nA recent study showed that they are increasingly forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change.\nMisinformation often circulates after natural disasters, as AFP has debunked here , here and here .\n<div",
