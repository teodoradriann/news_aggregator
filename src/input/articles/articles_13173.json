    "text": "By Abraham Achirga\nABUJA (Reuters) – Nigerian Catholic couple Jane and Lucy have little hope their local parish church will bless their same-sex union anytime soon, as conservative priests across Africa choose to ignore a landmark Vatican ruling allowing such blessings.\nConservative Catholics have condemned the Vatican’s declaration two weeks ago, which was approved by Pope Francis, that will allow blessings for same-sex couples, as long as they are not part of the regular Church rituals or liturgies.\nThe pope has hit back against the criticism and what he called inflexible ideological positions that hinder the Church from moving forward.\nBut in many African countries, such as the continent’s most populous one, Nigeria, even having a same-sex relationship is outlawed and often punishable by long jail terms.\nLittle wonder that 39-year-old Jane, who has been living with her partner for six years, does not feel the Vatican’s declaration will change much.\n“Maybe in the next 20 years (or) next 30 years but right now it will be difficult for them (Bishops) to just accept this,” Jane told Reuters inside her room in north central Benue state.\nIn the Anglican church, the issue has caused deep divisions for more than two decades, most recently following Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby’s proposal earlier this year to allow priests to bless same-sex unions, bringing the faith close to splitting point.\nThe Catholic Church has so far sought to avoid the impression of conflict.\nCatholic bishops from Angola, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi to Sao Tome and Principe, Uganda and Zimbabwe are among clerics who have said they will not bless same-sex couples, but have argued that the Pope’s decree can be interpreted as optional.\nFather Patrick Alumunku of St Louis Catholic Church Mbora parish in the capital Abuja said the Vatican declaration was unsettling for many followers but should be viewed as a move towards inclusiveness for all God’s children.\nHe denied that this was an incremental step to eventually accept same-sex unions in the church.\n“There are laws that have been made by God and by the church in 2000 years which cannot change,” said Alumunku.\nFor activist and poultry farmer Jane, the fact that the issue is being discussed openly is reason enough to consider eventually approaching her priest for a blessing, if her partner agrees.\n“I think he (Pope Francis) tried to understand the feelings of people who tend to be born different or people who basically are now becoming like the outcasts of this society,” she said.\n“We are getting there, a moment of self expression and acceptance is coming.”\n(Reporting by Abraham Achirga; Writing by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Tim Cocks and Sharon Singleton)",

    "title": "The role of ABIM-IKRAM-Umno-Amanah for the battle of the Malay mind and soul - Opinion",
    "text": "In Malaysia, the mind and soul of the Malays now solely belong to PAS and Bersatu. Anwar’s battle for the Malay mind and soul through his Madani Malaysia construct has a long way to go, if it is going anywhere at all. With due respect to a hard-working prime minister who has the mind and vision for a new or a renewed Malaysia, I suspect that the man is still in the mindset of the 1980s and 90s when the Islamic Reformist ruled the narratives for the Malays. I propose that 2024 will be the watermark for any shift in the Malay mind and soul. If nothing is done, and we hope only for a Madani Malaysia, I am afraid that we Malaysians will be in for an extremely long haul of conservatism and extremism. In this article, I wish to propose that the four Malay groups now weak in controlling the Malay and Islamic narrative, join forces to become an extremely potent force of reforming the national narrative. Umno is severely weakened after GE15. With the party joining the Unity Government, Umno is on its last leg of “make it or break it” in the politics of Malaysia. Forced to be a centrist party and no longer shouting right wing rhetoric, Umno does not know how to reinvent itself. Umno is in a survival mode, and only a new vision working with others can perhaps put the spring back in its steps. Since its birth and growth, Amanah was as irrelevant before as it is now. Without PH or DAP, this party will just tutup kedai. But this party has the largest number of seasoned politicians well versed in an Islam closest to the civilising or Madani construct that Anwar is proposing. This is because Amanah was once an Islamic Reformist entity under PAS, which is also supposed to be a centrist Islamist group but for the religious zealots that now control the helm. Unlike Umno, Amanah has no record of strength, and the party is best described as a parti tumpang sekaki. I hate myself for being crude and kurang ajar for my statement, but I am truly disappointed with Amanah, its members and leadership for not championing the narrative of a progressive Islam. ABIM and IKRAM, historically are the two entities that have ushered in a modern Islamic Reformist movement to change the Malays and to reinvent the race into a more matured and civilised race open to universal values of righteousness and a dynamic perspective of modern-day political issues of nation-building and global co-existence. However, after successfully building many schools for the new generation of Malay Muslims, these two entities slumped into complacency and irrelevance to the Malay minds. As an analogy, I view that all four groups are in an ICU of complete irrelevance with regards to winning the battle of the Malay mind and soul. What is the end game or winning scenario of a new Malay mind and a new Malay soul? The new Malay mind that I meant is one that is truly educated, well read, critical in thought, open in ideas of other systems, organisation and heritage, and able to visualise a better quality and dignity of life for human existence. What then is the Malay soul? The Malay soul is the one inspired by an Islam that encourages compassion, inclusiveness, tolerance, patience, decorum in criticising, and real respect for other faiths and cultures. In other words, everything that is in the Madani concept proposed by Anwar. Now, how should we get the Malays to change from an attitude of arrogance, exclusive supremacist, fear and incompetence into a Malay that is confident, educated, open-minded and scientifically well versed? Firstly, I thought the best way to change the Malays mindset and attitude would be the intelligentsia among the Malay academics. After 23 years of asking, begging and prodding the Malay intelligentsia, I have given up. The Malay professors and academics at all universities semua tak boleh pakai when it comes to public discourse on nation-building. They are experts in a tiny portion of knowledge, and they remain in their own cocoons of their small world of elitist ignorance. Secondly, I thought muftis should be at the forefront of creating a new and exciting Malay-Muslim narrative of nation-building and global coexistence. But again, I was disappointed when muftis are concerned only on petty issue and not about big ideas of nation-building, regenerating trust among the people, and championing the needy of all races, religions and sexual orientation. The muftis won’t help in reforming the Malay mind and they keep well within their boundaries of rituals, modesty for women, alcohol consumption and pilgrimages. They are incapable of taking the Malays and the Muslims into the future because most of the religious officials never left the past within their minds and spirit. I now call upon Umno, ABIM, IKRAM and Amanah to pool their strengths and resources. None can play the hero because all are now “extras”! The first act is to put up a working committee comprising of all members and have workshops on agreeing what kind of Melayu does Malaysia need going into the future — our future and the global one, too. There needs to be a new interpretation of how recent and past history shapes the new narrative and how this narrative now proposes policies to the benefit of all Malaysians. A series of Kongres Melayu Baru can be held to replace the Kongres Maruah Melayu that was too narrow-minded and self-serving only to one group and one ex-PM. The committee must also suggest plans for social media content to bombard the Malays with these new values and inclusive narrative. The Madani model can be part of the new Malay narrative, but it must not be seen solely coming from Anwar. The idea of the new Malay must have ownership by the four groups that would form the major push against the dangerous politics of PAS and Bersatu. Let PAS and Bersatu shout pendatang, this haram and that haram, or who is kafir and who is munafik. Let their shouts and ranting be drowned by the new narrative of a dynamic, confident and worldly Melayu rooted in the progressive idealism of Islam as taught by the Prophet Muhammad, not by Hadi Awang. I do not see this country moving anywhere positive and with any concrete narrative until these four Malay entities decide to change it. Even though this country belongs to all Malaysians, ultimately it is still the values, perspectives and narrative of the Malay that will carry the bigger weight.

O país “fez uma escolha livre, democrática, soberana e unida para aderir à NATO”, declarou Ulf Kristersson, ao lado do secretário de Estado norte-americano, Antony Blinken, a quem entregou o instrumento de acesso à NATO, formalizando a entrada do seu país como 32.º membro da organização.\n“ Este é um momento histórico para a Suécia . É histórico para a aliança. É histórico para a relação transatlântica”, afirmou Antony Blinken. “A nossa aliança da NATO é agora mais forte e maior do que alguma vez foi”, acrescentou o governante norte-americana.\nAinda nos EUA, Joe Biden afirmou que Vladimir Putin “quis dividir” a aliança atlântica mas que esta está “mais unida e determinada” do que nunca: “Quando Putin lançou a sua guerra brutal de agressão contra o povo da Ucrânia, ele pensou que poderia enfraquecer a Europa e dividir a NATO”, começou por dizer o líder norte-americano, acrescentando: “Em vez disso, em maio de 2022, a Suécia e a Finlândia — dois dos nossos parceiros próximos, com duas forças armadas altamente capazes — tomaram a decisão histórica de solicitar a adesão plena à NATO.”\nA organização “está mais unida, determinada e dinâmica do que nunca — agora com 32 nações fortes”, concluiu.\nEm Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa felicitou o Rei Carlos XVI Gustavo e considerou que “o alargamento da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte à Suécia, que se concretizou hoje, 7 de março, representa um sólido reforço de uma estrutura que tem sido fundamental em matéria de segurança e defesa coletiva e de manutenção da Paz”.\n“Portugal, que apoiou sem reservas, de forma convicta e decidida a adesão da Suécia à NATO, congratula-se por este histórico alargamento, na firme certeza de que a integração do seu mais recente membro contribuirá para reforçar o pilar europeu de defesa no seio da Aliança Atlântica”.\nJá o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros português, João Gomes Cravinho, sublinhou que começa uma “nova era de colaboração e segurança” entre os Estados-membros. “Inicia-se agora uma nova era de colaboração e segurança para a Suécia e para os seus Aliados”, acrescentou João Gomes Cravinho, que deixou saudações em sueco, português e inglês.\nTambém o Ministério da Defesa português publicou uma mensagem no X: “Mais um passo importante no reforço da segurança e defesa da Aliança. Bem-vinda Suécia”, pode ler-se na nota do ministério liderado por Helena Carreiras.\nNa Ucrânia, Volodymyr Zelensky afirmou que a Suécia fica agora “mais protegida contra o mal russo”, e mostrou-se confiante de que “chegará o dia em que a Suécia poderá felicitar a Ucrânia pela adesão à Aliança.”\n“Todos beneficiam quando a segurança de um país melhora e esse país pode realmente reforçar a segurança partilhada”, disse Volodymyr Zelensky num vídeo partilhado no X.\n“Neste momento, no meio da agressão russa contra tudo o que manteve a Europa pacífica e unida, todos compreendem quão crítico é manter alianças e parcerias, reforçar a própria segurança e cuidar da segurança dos vizinhos”, acrescentou.\nTermina assim o que deveria ser um processo “expresso”, mas que acabou por demorar 22 meses devido às reticências da Turquia e da Hungria sobre a adesão da Suécia.\n ",
