    "text": "Cardinal Pizzaballa: Peace in Holy Land Built on Dialogue, Action The cardinal stressed that the Israel-Hamas conflict is not just an issue for the local Church but also an issue for the universal Church. The Latin patriarch of Jerusalem delivered an impassioned lecture on Thursday at the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome detailing the process of peace in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, noting that it is an integral part of the Church’s universal mission and one that must not be conflated with overtly temporal or political aims. “Peace needs the testimony of clear and strong gestures on the part of all believers, but it also needs to be announced and defended by equally clear words. We cannot remain silent in the face of injustices or invite people to live peacefully and disengage,” Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa remarked during his “lectio magistralis” on Thursday at the pontifical university. “The preferential option for the poor and the weak, however, does not make us a political party,” he added. The hourlong lecture, titled “Characteristics and Criteria for a Pastoral Care of Peace,” was the latest installment in the university’s ongoing series of studies in peace sciences and international cooperation launched by the school’s Pontifical Pastoral Institute Redemptor Hominis. The cardinal stressed that the Israel-Hamas conflict is not just an issue for the local Church but also an issue for the universal Church. “What I tend to say is that conflict is not a temporary and secondary issue in the life of our Church,” the cardinal continued; rather, he said, it “is now an integral and constitutive part of our identity as a Church.” Cardinal Pizzaballa underlined that “talking about peace, therefore, is not talking about an abstract topic but of a deep wound in the life of the Christian that causes suffering and tiredness, a lot of tiredness, and deeply touches the human and spiritual life of all of us.” Stressing the universality of the conflict, he added it “involves the life of everyone in our diocese and is therefore an integral part of the life of the Church, of its pastoral care.” The day before the lecture, Cardinal Pizzaballa [took possession of his titular church in Rome](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/257561/latin-patriarch-of-jerusalem-takes-possession-of-rome-titular-church-after-delays-due-to-war), St. Onuphrius, where he spoke on the historic, symbolic, and theological links between the Church in the Holy Land and Rome, again expressing the importance of the Holy Land for the universal Church. “The Church of Jerusalem is the mother Church of the Church, where the roots of the entire universal Church lie, and it is a place that still retains a local and universal character today,” he said during his May 1 homily. In his lecture on Thursday, Cardinal Pizzaballa made overtures to the historical roots of the conflict in order to stress the “plurirelgious” and “pluricultural” nature of the Holy Land and to open a reflection on the importance of narrative in the process of peace. “These problems of memory cannot be solved by reading one’s own history,” he said. “Intercultural conflicts will not be overcome if we do not reread different readings of the strong religious and cultural histories.” While arguing that “peace is not the exclusive responsibility of the pastor,” he noted that religious leaders must work to “create contexts in which communities can express themselves.” “Today, especially in the Holy Land, everyone has their own little story to tell,” he added. Cardinal Pizzaballa stressed the importance of dialogue as a critical underpinning of the peace process, noting that through the promotion of “continuous dialogue” and “mutual listening” that “a serious pastoral care in peace is born and developed.” The cardinal also noted religious leaders must work to promote both “a new culture of legality” as well as to “become a living and prophetic voice of justice, human rights, and peace.” While acknowledging that there has always been “a close relationship” between ecclesial and civic leaders, playing a delicate role in the “function[ing] in the life of national communities,” Cardinal Pizzaballa warned that the Church’s call for peace must exist “without entering into logics of competition and division” in order to offer “credible witnesses.” - Keywords: [patriarch pizzabella](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/patriarch-pizzabella)",

    "text": "It turns out, the stereotype of a grandmother spoiling her grandkids might be more than just a stereotype.\nIf you’ve spent time with your grandmother when you were little, you probably remember just how elated she was to see you. It seemed like you could ask for anything under the sun and it would magically appear in front of you.\nThere might be scientific evidence to back up the claim that there’s no love like a grandmother’s love, a phenomenon known as “grandma brain.”\nThe study\nDr. James Rilling, a professor of anthropology at Emory University, recently conducted a study using MRIs that might explain a grandmother’s intense devotion to her grandkids.\nThe study was conducted on 50 grandmothers in 2021. They were shown pictures of their grandchildren, their children and random people.\nUpon seeing pictures of their grandchildren, the women’s brains exhibited different behaviours than when they saw pictures of their own kids. Specifically, the part of the brain associated with emotional empathy was activated when a woman saw a picture of her grandchild. “That suggests that grandmothers are geared towards feeling what their grandchildren are feeling when they interact with them. If their grandchild is smiling, they’re feeling the child’s joy. And if their grandchild is crying, they’re feeling the child’s pain and distress,” says Rilling.\nWhen a grandmother was shown pictures of her own kids, a different part of the brain was activated, the one associated with cognitive empathy. With cognitive empathy, a person understands what the other person is feeling and why, while emotional empathy allows one to experience the other person’s emotions.\n“Love on steroids”\nPhotography, Christian Bowen, Unsplash.com\nGrandmother of three and retired teacher Janet Meisel wrote an essay for Medium entitled, “Are Grandparents Supposed To Feel This Much Love?” in which she called her own feelings “love on steroids.” The intensity of the love she feels for her grandkids makes her feel like her heart “will burst with joy.”\nOther factors could explain this feeling. Grandparents usually have fewer responsibilities than parents, especially when it comes to newborns and toddlers. While parents have to juggle work, financial stress, childcare and everything in between, grandparents get to enjoy their grandchildren’s company and hand them back to their parents at the end of the day.\nFurther research\nDr. Rilling is currently studying saliva samples from grandmothers to find out if they contain more oxytocin (the love hormone) than samples of women the same age who are not grandmothers, and the data gathered from the study is still being analyzed. Dr. Rilling also plans to conduct a study on the brains of grandfathers, who were not included in the initial research, and hopes to conduct long-term research on women’s hormone levels before and after they become grandmothers.\nRecommended\nWhat Milk Should You Be Drinking?

    "text": "According to a report from ESPN's Adam Schefter, the Kansas City Chiefs and tight end Noah Gray agreed on a three-year, $18 million contract extension ahead of the team's season opener on Thursday night. The Chiefs selected Gray in the fifth round of the 2021 NFL draft out of Duke University, where he earned second-team All-ACC and second-team All-American honors. Now in his third year with Kansas City, the two-time Super Bowl champion is set to serve as a backup to All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce. With this extension, the Chiefs are committing to Gray for the long term, and will continue to lean on him when Kelce is on the sideline. Though Gray's new deal didn't break the bank for Kansas City's front office, Brett Veach's decision to lock him up for the next three years could prove to be important if injuries play a factor for the Chiefs at the tight end position. Expect Andy Reid to utilize Gray against the Baltimore Ravens on Thursday night as Kansas City looks to defend its newly won AFC Championship.",

I was raped, killed, tortured, hit by wooden block',\" she told ABC .\nVina's father, family lawyer, and sister, Marliana via Warta Kota Live\nRecording of possession taken to police\nMarliana recorded the possession as a voice note.\nIn the recording, \"Pegi Setiawan\", the nickname of a member of a local motorbike gang, was mentioned.\nPegi Setiawan in real life via @creepyology/X\nMarliana subsequently took the recording to the police.\nGoing off on what was apparently a voice recording of a possession, the police acted on it and 11 gang members were identified as suspects.\nThey were part of the same motorcycle group as Pegi.\nEight were quickly found and arrested.\nPolice seemingly had retrieved or gathered more evidence by this time, including some of the suspects' motorbikes, phones and clothes, as well as some rocks and bits of bamboo, according to court documents seen by the ABC .\nEight convicted\nIn May 2017, they were found guilty of gang raping Vina and the premeditated murders of her and Eky.\nSeven of the guilty suspects were sentenced to life imprisonment, while one of them, who was underage, was sentenced to jail for eight years.\nBut the alleged ring-leader and main suspect, Pegi, who was identified by Vina's \"spirit\", remained at large for the next few years.\nFilm piques audience's curiosity\nThe film starts with the teenagers' bodies being found and depicts the aftermath, including the possession.\nWhat was portrayed on screen makes for graphic viewing for audiences, especially for those who know the background of the movie, which was already widely known for being based on a true story.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by anggy_umbara (@anggy_umbara)\nAs a result, many who have watched it have called the film out as \"exploitative\" in nature, as it was profiteering off a very real and recent tragedy, that has not fully concluded, given the film's depiction of events.\nHowever, the Jakarta Globe reported that Marliana recently said in the film's defence that it has played an important role in the case:\nShould the story have been portrayed differently?\nSome have suggested that a documentary would have been a more ethical portrayal of the murders as opposed to a fictional re-enactment, as this would have eliminated or made redundant elements that relied on the creative licence to craft a 100-minute narrative, which appeared as entertainment on screen.\nAnd such a retelling has had an effect in real life.\nWith the resurgence of interest in the case, videos on TikTok about the film have garnered more than 60 million views , and the case was transferred from the local police to West Java.\nIt was also reported in Indonesia that several motorcycle groups in Cirebon, West Java, even had to address the media in late May 2024 following the movie's release, to confirm that their members were not involved in Vina's murder.\nArrest made\nTwo weeks after the film's release, Pegi, now 27 and a construction worker , was found and arrested.\nIn 2016, he would have been about 19 when he allegedly committed the crimes.\nThe other two suspects, assumed to be part of the gang, supposedly remain at large.\nHowever, police have since suggested that any other suspects could have been made scapegoats, and that any additional persons of interest may not even actually exist.\nThe latest arrest was not without controversy.\nAt a police press conference in June 2024, Setiwan defended himself: \"I never committed the murder, this is slander... I am willing to die to prove that I am innocent.\"\nSince Pegi's arrest, the other eight perpetrators have retracted their admission statements, citing torture and abuse by investigators and lawyers are now calling for a re-trial.\nABC also reported that a movie exerting a real-world impact, via expediting investigations and forcing authorities to act, could make any arrest in the wake of public pressure problematic.\nThis was so as the authorities could be assumed to be reacting to public scrutiny and pressure to provide answers.\nInstead of solving a mystery or getting to the bottom of things, hasty action based on a presumption of guilt, could even lead to a miscarriage of justice as a consequence.\nInvestigations are ongoing.\nTop images from @anggy_umbara/Instagram and @creepyology/X",

    "text": "Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists come together in Natore for Christmas, the feast of harmony\nCelebrations transcended boundaries of faiths in an atmosphere of forgiveness, peace, and reconciliation. A Muslim shared songs and food, as his Christian friend did earlier for the Islamic holiday of Eid. Official mentions the role played in local development by PIME missionaries, still remembered with affection by the community.\nNatore (AsiaNews) – Christmas was marked by interfaith harmony and sharing with members of different religions united to celebrate the joy of the birth of Jesus in Natore, a district in Rajshahi Division, experiencing moments of intense participation in the name of rebirth, new beginnings, forgiveness, and peace in a country that once experienced sectarian tensions.\nTrees adorned with lights and decorations illuminated the surroundings, accompanied by special prayers in churches and Christmas carols and hymns of joy in Christian homes.\nThe celebration crossed religious boundaries with members of the Christian, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist communities united in stressing that \"Christmas is a universal celebration.\"\nRobiul Islam, a young Muslim from Natore, spoke to AsiaNews about his experience. \"I joined the Christmas party with my friend Jonathan Gomes. We sang Christmas carols, enjoyed delicious food, including the Christmas cake,” he said. Stressing the strong bond between faiths, he said that Jonathan had previously participated in Eid (Islamic) celebrations with his family.\nOn Christmas Day, the parish of Bonpara, Natore, organised a convivial moment after the Mass with local Christians sharing Christmas cake and songs with people of different faiths.\nSiddiqur Rahman Patwari, a Muslim leader and member of Parliament, as well as other political leaders, attended the event, bringing greetings to the Catholic community.\nPatwari expressed gratitude to the missionaries from the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME) for their major role in local development. He also highlighted local religious harmony, expressing hope that it would continue in the future.\nIt should be noted that PIME priests and nuns from Italy served in the parish of Bonpara for many years. And their contribution, a local resident pointed out, is still remembered with affection by the Christians and non-Christians alike.\nOn Christmas, Bangladeshi President Mohammed Sahabuddin and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina also extended their greetings to the Christian community.\nThe president hosted a reception at the Bangabhaban, his official residence, in the presence of Archbishop Bejoy N D' Cruze of Dhaka and Christian Association of Bangladesh President Nirmol Rozario, as well as other community representatives, diplomats and religious leaders from various countries.\nThe head of state urged everyone to work for the well-being of the country and its people, stressing that religion is a personal matter and that, at the national level, it is necessary to support harmony and the free practice of worship.\nLastly, he praised Christ's example for all faiths in leading people to truth, justice, and peace, working to make the world a peaceful place.\nFor his part, Card Patrick D'Rozario, Archbishop Emeritus of Dhaka, released a message for Christmas.\n\"Celebrating Christmas during the upcoming election is a grace from God and a call to embrace the challenge,” the message reads.\nIn it, the cardinal also offered prayers to encourage people to bring the message of Christmas to the electoral process, and to choose leaders committed to justice, peace, and harmony, wishing everyone \"a fruitful Christmas and a new year full of grace.\"\nAs Indonesia stops for Eid al-Fitr, Catholics extend best wishes and show friendship\n05/06/2019 18:08",

    "text": "Posted 1 мая, 04:00\nPublished 1 мая, 04:00\nModified 1 мая, 04:00\nUpdated 1 мая, 04:00\nЧто именно подорожает в России с 1 мая и насколько, интернет-изданию «Подмосковье сегодня» рассказала доктор экономических наук, профессор РЭУ им. Г. В. Плеханова Наталья Проданова.\nПо словам эксперта, по многим видам продукции причиной подорожания станет сезонность, есть и виды продукции (работ или услуг), стоимость которых возрастет в связи с наступлением долгожданных и относительно долгих в этом году так называемых «майских» праздников.\n«Начинается дачный „шашлычный“ сезон. Увеличивается спрос на мясо, свежие овощи и фрукты. На рынках появляется редис, молодой картофель, брокколи, шпинат, зеленый лук и тому подобное. Цены на отечественную сельскохозяйственную продукцию на привозах еще „кусачие“. А поскольку запасы прошлогоднего урожая уже заканчиваются, то и в магазинах, куда поступает в основном более дорогая тепличная или импортная продукция, цены растут», — заявила эксперт интернет-изданию «Подмосковье сегодня».\nВ преддверии майских стоимость картофеля, помидоров, свежих огурцов и других овощей будет расти в диапазоне 5–15% в зависимости от региона. По мясу прогноз более пессимистичный — плюс 10–15%. Примерно на столько же подорожает рыба и морские деликатесы.\n«Дорогим окажется и сам отдых. Позволить себе провести майские праздники „не дома и не на даче“ тоже сможет не каждый. Стоимость готовых пакетных туров за рубеж еще в апреле выросла в 1,5–2 раза. А отдых по России на майские выходные дни на 3–4 дня обойдется по цене отдыха на 7–8 ночей по системе „все включено“ на берегу моря в обычный сезон», — добавила Проданова.\nДля сравнения, продолжила эксперт, цена на теплоходные туры, приходящиеся на «непраздничные» дни, начинается с 13–16 тыс. рублей.\n«Аналогичные туры с 1 по 4 мая, 8–11 мая начинаются от 48 тыс. руб. с человека. Да и стоимость авиабилетов, по самым скромным расчетам, в праздники выросла на 11–15%», — подчеркнула экономист.\nКонечно, причиной роста цен станет не только сезонность спроса, добавила она. Нельзя сбрасывать со счетов и уровень инфляции, дорогой заемный капитал, высокие логистические издержки товаропроизводителей, которые «зашиты» в конечной стоимости готовой продукции (работ и услуг).\n«Впрочем, и тех, кто захочет провести майские праздники с пользой — привести в порядок дачный участок, сделать ремонт, — тоже порадовать нечем. Рынок строительных и ремонтных материалов уже начал свой рост, и прогнозы по ценам здесь довольно неутешительны — прирост их стоимости может составить до 25% в зависимости от вида материалов. Наибольший скачок цен ожидается на цемент, металлические конструкции, изоляционные материалы, пиломатериалы и другое», — отметила Проданова.\nКроме того, в мае ожидается и рост цен на авто. По самым скромным расчетам, цена на автомобили вырастет на 20–25%. В основном подорожание затронет премиум-сегмент, заключила экономист.",
