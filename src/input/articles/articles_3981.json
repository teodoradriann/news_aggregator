    "text": "（杭州3日综合电）中国江苏省杭州市一名50岁的李姓妇女，2个月前双腿开始莫名其妙地发痒，起先以为是皮肤过敏，就近在药局买了点抗过敏药吃，然而症状不见好转，后来连上半身也开始痒，而且越来越痒，最后实在受不了才就医。医生听完症状描述，立刻警惕起来，安排了腹部超音波检查，果然在患者肝脏上发现肿瘤。\n《钱江晚报》报导，李女2个月前双腿开始发痒，后来症状逐渐恶化，全身都痒得不行，这才到卫生服务中心就诊。全科副主任医生李晓强听完症状描述，立刻警惕起来，并安排了腹部彩音波检查。这一查，可把医生和李妇都惊呆了，因为患者肝脏顶部长了异物。医生凭藉丰富的临床经验，高度怀疑是肿瘤。\n随后，患者被紧急转到了浙大二院做进一步检查，结果确实是肿瘤，原发性肝癌。万幸的是，因为发现得还算及时，浙大二院专家团队当天就为李阿姨办理了住院，并很快安排了手术，成功切除了肿瘤，目前患者正在康复中。\n医生表示，当肝脏出现损伤，可能会激活皮肤中的神经纤维，通过信号传导至神经中枢直达脑皮层，继而产生顽固性搔痒。\n李晓强提醒，如果皮肤出现以下4种异常，需警惕肝脏病变。\n1、皮肤搔痒：肝脏出现损伤，有可能会激活皮肤中的神经纤维，通过信号传导至神经中枢直达脑感觉皮层，继而产生顽固性搔痒。\n2、皮肤发黄：肝功能受损时，体内胆红素积聚，可致皮肤发黄，尤其是眼白和皮肤表面可能呈现出蜡黄色。\n3、蜘蛛痣：蜘蛛痣表现为皮肤表面出现红色、紫色的小血管瘤，按压时蜘蛛痣消失，松手后再次出现。若肝脏对雌激素的代谢能力受到影响，可使雌激素在血液中浓度升高，进而刺激皮肤毛细血管扩张形成蜘蛛痣。\n4、出血：肝脏是人体合成凝血因子的场所，直接关乎凝血功能。若突然有牙龈出血、皮肤出血点、消化道出血，可能是肝功能受损的表现，一定不要忽视。\n文：台湾东森新闻\n图：文汇 示意图\n中国报官方WhatsApp平台！\nhttps://t.me/chinapressonline",

    "text": "The America250 Commission is planting its roots quite literally on Monday, Oct. 7 at Moraine State Park. The commission, an initiative to celebrate the upcoming 250th anniversary of the nation’s founding, will plant a “Liberty Tree” at 4 p.m. Monday at the state park as part of an effort to plant a tree in each of the state’s 67 counties. The tree planting will take place just west of the Moraine State Park office on Pleasant Valley Road, in the park’s South Shore area.\nThe original Boston “Liberty Tree” served as a popular gathering place during the Revolutionary era. It became a symbol of the resistance that would eventually grow into the American Revolution, starting in 1765, when an effigy was hung from the tree to protest the Stamp Act.\nThe original tree would continue to serve as a staging ground for protests until 1775, when British soldiers occupied Boston and destroyed the tree.\nOther Liberty Trees sprouted throughout the original 13 colonies. The last surviving one, a tulip poplar located on the campus of Saint John's University in Maryland, was badly damaged by Hurricane Floyd in 1999. According to America250, this last Liberty tree is the source of the trees being planted across Pennsylvania.\n“Thanks to landscaper Mark Mehnert, this historical Liberty Tree has been rescued and propagated,” said America250 communications and marketing director Bri Farrand. “Now seedlings from the graft of this original Liberty Tree are being planted across the Commonwealth as part of the Liberty Tree Project.”\nA tradition of planting trees across the state has been happening since October 2021. So far, 18 Liberty Trees have been planted in as many counties, including Westmoreland County (at Historic Hanna’s Town), Venango County (at the county courthouse) and Mercer County (at the county conservation district).\nThe tree-planting events throughout Pennsylvania are being sponsored by the Pennsylvania Freemasons.\nContinue Reading with One of the Options Below Already a subscriber?

    "title": "Legal action coming to recover COVID benefit overpayments: CRA - Vancouver Is Awesome",
    "text": "The Canada Revenue Agency is ramping up efforts to recover overpayments of pandemic-related benefits to individuals as more than $9 billion remains owed. The agency said Thursday that starting in July, it will begin using legal warnings and means to recover overpayments, actions that could include taking payments out of wages or bank accounts. The agency said it will only be taking legal action against those who have not responded or co-operated and who have been determined to have the financial capacity to pay. \"Our primary goal is to encourage individuals to contact us so we can work together to find the best way to resolve their debt, ensuring a fair and manageable process for everyone,\" spokeswoman Sylvie Branch said in an email. The agency said it remains committed to supporting Canadians who are not able to repay their debt and encouraged those individuals to contact them to figure out a plan. The rollout of pandemic relief payments saw more than $200 billion doled out to individuals and businesses on a pay-now-ask-questions-later basis. The CRA said it's still trying to get about $9.53 billion paid back from individuals who were ineligible including $5.41 billion from the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, $2.67 billion from the Canada Recovery Benefit and $1.25 billion from the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit. The agency began efforts in May 2022 to recover payments deemed ineligible by sending out letters encouraging voluntary payments. Last year, it sent out collection letters and made efforts to reach people by phone. It also started using a process it calls \"offsetting,\" which means that it automatically uses money from tax refunds and some benefits to settle a person's debt with the government. Those who are told they owe can ask for two reviews of the conclusion, where they're given the opportunity to try and prove they qualified, said Dale Barrett, founder and managing lawyer of Barrett Tax Law. But he said given the information the CRA has, there's usually not much room for debate on whether someone qualified for the benefits. \"Most of the issues are pretty clear cut.\" Those who still want to challenge the decision after two reviews can take their case to Federal Court, but it generally requires a lawyer and is an expensive prospect for the amount of benefits involved. \"They still have the opportunity to go to court, which unfortunately is one of those things that's very expensive to do,\" Barrett said. There have been more than 1,000 people who have challenged the findings in Federal Court and some people have been successful, against the odds, in securing another review after self-representation. Those included an Ontario hospitality worker who demonstrated his joblessness was related to the pandemic by showing he went through three interviews for an airport position just before COVID-19's onset. A Quebec retiree, meanwhile, convinced a judge he had been doing odd jobs as a landscaper to make extra cash after the level of his pre-pandemic income was challenged by the CRA. But far more have been forced to pay back the funds owed. \"Just in the majority of the cases, the CRA knows, they know whether you've qualified or not. They've got your tax return,\" said Barrett. He said that while as a tax lawyer he's always happy to prove the agency incorrect, he thinks they've done a reasonable job navigating the return of benefits. \"It's always lousy getting a collection call from the CRA. But at the end of the day, it's also lousy having taxpayer dollars go to places where they shouldn't be going.\" There is the small consolation for those who owe — there are no penalties or interest on the emergency benefits overpayment debts. — With files from Darryl Greer in Vancouver This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 27, 2024.
