    "text": "TULSA, Okla. — In just a few weeks, pallets of playground equipment will be transformed into a safe space for kids to play outdoors at the Common Good’s community center in northwest Tulsa. Stephen Pyle, Executive Director of the Common Good, shared his vision for the space for the kids who participate in their afterschool programming with us on Thursday. He said the outdoor component is key. “We operate in an old warehouse market grocery store so there’s no windows within our facilities, and so it’s great for our kids to be able to come outside, see the fresh sunshine have the wind in their face and play together,\" Pyle said. The addition of community gardens will allow residents to grow fresh produce, something that appeals to neighbor and mother Krystal Kite. “With the food garden I’m really excited about that,” she said. “We are a food desert.” She said having an enclosed playground with good lighting is important as there are a number of stray dogs in the neighborhood. “I feel like having it enclosed it makes it a little safer,” she added. Kite said the parks in her neighborhood also have drug use, so moms often find needles and left-over trash. The new playground at the Hub at the Common Good is expected to be open by March 15. While most of the $180,000 project is being paid for by a matching grant, the nonprofit is still looking to raise an additional $15,000.

    "text": "Despite being years old, War Thunder’s thrilling MMO military experience is still a favorite among thousands of players across the world. But if you are trying to get a read on its popularity, you might want to take a look at the number of players enjoying it right now.\nBeing a free-to-play game has its benefits, but it isn’t the only reason War Thunder has a huge player base. Factors like good marketing from the devs’ side, regular intriguing updates, and the unique style it delivers with thrilling vehicle-based combat combined with the MMO experience contribute toward the hype as well. Since you’re here, chances are you’re looking for War Thunder’s player count at this time, so I’m going to answer that for you.\nWar Thunder player count: How many people play War Thunder going into 2024? As of Dec. 28, 2023, War Thunder boasts an average of 63,039 daily players, according to Steam Charts . At time of writing, Steam Charts shows the game’s 24-hour peak to be 104,298 players. Its all-time peak player count was recorded in November 2023, when 114,806 players were playing the game at the same time.\nHere’s how War Thunder is doing. Image via Steam Charts Interestingly, War Thunder was a popular game throughout 2023, recording an average of around 57,504 daily players over the past year.\nThe numbers are definitely impressive, although it’s worth noting that the statistics might be slightly inflated by bot accounts—a common problem in free-to-play games. Nevertheless, recording such high numbers is still an impressive feat.\nRelated It’s that time of the year again: War Thunder players leaked sensitive files online To top it off, War Thunder’s Pages of History monthly event also causes a hike in active players, thanks to its riveting themes that honor historical events from the past. Players get to bring iconic vehicles to battle and complete tasks, earning special rewards for the same. For example, January 2024’s Pages of History will honor many important battles ranging from the end of World War II, as well as major battles in the Middle East, featuring eight tasks that players can complete to earn a player icon of William Arthur Shomo, a well-known fighter pilot from that era. Players will also earn trophy rewards for completing each task, allowing them to level up their experience.\nWar Thunder had a successful 2023, but many fans will be curious to see how well it preserves its popularity going into 2024.\nAuthor Sharmila Ganguly Staff Writer at Dot Esports.

    "text": "In a poignant blog post, presidential candidate Pekka Haavisto addresses the escalating crisis in the Middle East, highlighting the urgent need for a ceasefire as the first step towards a two-state solution. Haavisto, drawing on his extensive experience in peace mediation, outlines a comprehensive seven-step plan aimed at resolving the long-standing conflict in the region. The dire situation in Gaza has reached a critical point, with the United Nations Security Council demanding unimpeded access for humanitarian aid as of December 22, 2023. Haavisto emphasizes that silencing weapons is imperative to facilitate this aid. His depiction of the current state in Gaza is grim, painting a picture of devastation and despair, particularly in the wake of Hamas' brutal attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in 1,200 deaths and 240 hostages. The toll on Gaza's population has been catastrophic. Over 20,000 Gazans, predominantly women and children, have lost their lives in Israeli military operations. The displacement crisis is staggering, with 85% of Gaza's two million inhabitants forced to abandon their homes, many repeatedly due to ongoing conflicts. Despite the desperate need, humanitarian aid is not reaching those in need effectively, leaving a quarter of the Gazan population on the brink of starvation. Haavisto's blog post goes beyond the immediate ceasefire and release of hostages. He insists on the cessation of violence in the West Bank as a crucial component of the Middle East solution. He warns of the potential for regional escalation, citing the activities of Iran-backed groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthi rebels in North Yemen, who have targeted maritime traffic in the Red Sea area. The proposed solution calls for international cooperation, with countries like Egypt and Qatar already offering diplomatic assistance to broker a ceasefire and resolve the hostage crisis. Haavisto's seven elements for advancing towards a two-state model emphasize the need for committed and credible negotiating parties, confidence-building measures, a structured peace process, peacekeeping forces in Gaza, widespread recognition of a Palestinian state, and a thorough investigation into war crimes committed by all involved parties. In his concluding remarks, Haavisto reaffirms that peace is a matter of will, not just in the Middle East but globally. He urges the international community, including Finland, to pave the way for a sustainable peace solution in the region. HT",

    "title": "Pope Rebuked For Claiming The Heart Is Inherently Good: ‘Jesus Taught To The Contrary’",
    "text": "Pope Francis is under fire after claiming that human beings are “fundamentally good” in a recent interview with 60 Minutes host Norah O’ Donnell. “We are all fundamentally good,” he said. “Yes, there are some rogues and sinners, but the heart itself is good.”\nEvangelical leaders have pointed out that the pontiff’s statements are contrary to the teaching of original sin, one of Christianity’s basic doctrines. “If this is true, we don’t need a Savior to die on the Cross,” wrote Eric Metaxas, best-selling author and national radio host.\nAlluding to the pope’s statements in light of the 24/7 news cycle, Southern Baptist Convention President Bart Barber posted on X: “The remainder of the content of this news program and all the other programming on your TV suggests otherwise. And certainly Jesus taught to the contrary.”\nAllie Beth Stuckey, conservative Christian author and podcast host, pointed out that the Bible refutes Pope Francis’ claims that humanity is inherently good. She quoted Mark 10:18—“No one is good except God alone”—and Jeremiah 17:9—“The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately sick”—among other verses. “This is core to Christianity,” Stuckey wrote. “Because if everyone is basically good, the Gospel is not good news. If the Gospel is not good news, what’s the point?”\nSome X users also noted that Pope Francis’ statement echoed Pelagianism, a heresy spread by 5th century monk Pelagius and his followers. They denied original sin and taught that human beings are completely free to choose between good and evil.\nFranklin Graham speaks out regularly on sin—and how it is the root cause of every problem in our world. “There is no place in the human heart or on the Earth where sin hasn’t wrought its deadly work,” he writes. “Sin brought death, both physical and spiritual, to the entire human race. When you took your first breath, outside your mother’s womb, you were already a sinner, alienated and separated from a holy God.”\nBut the Good News of the Gospel is that sin does not need to have the last word. As Franklin pointed out last week at the U.S. Capitol, during the unveiling of his father’s statue: “God so loved this world that He sent His Son on a rescue mission to save sinners. He didn’t come to condemn; He came to save. And if we would confess our sins and repent and believe on the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we can be saved.”",
