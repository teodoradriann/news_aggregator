    "text": "Business\nTrader Joe’s organic acai bowl recalled over contamination fears\nTrader Joe's has recalled a popular frozen dish over possible plastic contamination, the grocery chain said.\nThe organic acai bowl, which sells for $3.99, may contain plastic material, the retailer announced last week. The company encouraged customers who had purchased the bowls, which include berries, bananas, granola and dried coconut, to throw them out or return them. The company did not specify how the possible contamination occurred.\n\"At Trader Joe's, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our customers and Crew Members. With this in mind, we do the daily work to make certain our products meet our stringent food safety expectations,\" the grocer said in a statement. \"We don't take any chances when it comes to product safety and quality.\"\nIn December, a Trader Joe's fan page on Instagram announced the product had returned to shelves after a hiatus.\nThe recall follows other recalls that affected Trader Joe's products: A widespread listeria recall affected some of the brand's cooked chicken products last year, and last week, an issue with easy-open pull tabs on tuna cans prompted recalls over fears of botulism.\nBetween September and November last year, 26 food recalls hit California, including Fresno-based raw milk infected with the bird flu virus, city of Commerce organic carrots contaminated with E. coli, and cucumbers from Arizona contaminated with salmonella. Experts said testing systems for food have significantly changed over time, making it hard to say if the high number of recalls marks an unusual level of foodborne illnesses.\nCopyright (C) 2024, Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

The Team USA swimmer joined his former coaches at the McAllen Public Library. Casas had a strong showing at the Olympics in Paris and though he didn't win a medal, he received a special one from city leaders. \"After I made the team, you know I had... the Valley kind of pushing me forward and rooting for me, and it's nice to know that. I didn't really know that before, but now that I do it's extra motivation as I'm reevaluating for these next four years,\" Casas said. Casas donated an autographed Team USA flag to the library.

    "text": "Jason Kelce says he’s lost his Super Bowl LII ring… in a pool filled with chili CNN By Ben Church, CNN (CNN) — [Jason Kelce](https://cnn.com/2024/03/04/sport/jason-kelce-retires-nfl-eagles-spt-intl/index.html) is continuing to do Jason Kelce things even after retiring from the NFL. In the latest episode of the ‘ [New Heights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiA5nvzWB6E&t=1579s)’ podcast, which he does with his brother Kansas City Chiefs tight end [Travis Kelce](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/entertainment/travis-kelce-host-smarter-than-celebrity/index.html), the legendary center revealed that he recently lost his [Super Bowl LII ring](https://cnn.com/style/article/super-bowl-rings-history/index.html) in the most unlikely way possible: in a pool of chili. It occurred at the recent Great “Lombaby Games,” a live show hosted by the brothers which sees teams compete in ridiculous games. One challenge saw participants wade through pools of Skyline chili, searching for replica Super Bowl rings tied to socks. Crucially, though, one of those ‘replicas’ was actually Kelce’s genuine ring, which he won with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018. “I legitimately lost my Super Bowl ring in this event, they could not find it,” Jason said, with his brother Travis less than impressed. “We have still yet to find it. All of this stuff has been thrown away, so I think we can safely assume that my Super Bowl ring is now in a landfill someplace in the Cincinnati tri-state area. I didn’t think that would happen.” Jason said people had searched through the pools after the event, but that no one could salvage it from the three-way mess of chili, spaghetti and cheese. A metal detector was also used, but to no avail. “The only thing I can think of is, at some point, the sock got kicked out of the three-way and it made its way out of the pool and it was thrown away in some shape or form,” he continued. “The Super Bowl ring is officially gone. We’ve already put the insurance claim in, which I think the insurance company might have some things to say about whether they’re going to cover that.” Travis had little sympathy for his older brother, calling him an “imbecile” for willingly putting such a precious item into a large tub of chili. The exact cost of each a ring is generally kept secret and can [vary wildly depending on specifications and size](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/super-bowl-rings-history/index.html). New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft’s Super Bowl LI championship ring was auctioned off for [just over $1 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN22Y2KS/#:~:text=(Reuters)%20%2D%20New%20England%20Patriots,during%20the%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic.) in 2020, while the [auction record](https://cnn.com/style/article/super-bowl-rings-history/index.html) for a ring once owned by a player is $230,401. A New England Patriots Super Bowl LI ring which had the name “Brady” on it – because it was made for a family member of quarterback Tom Brady – also fetched $344,927. “So ridiculous. Kids, if you’re watching at home, don’t do what Jason is doing,” Travis said, laughing as he listened to his brother try defend himself. Earlier this year, Jason announced he was retiring from the NFL in an emotional press conference. He had spent his entire 13-season NFL career with the Eagles, including the team’s 2018 Super Bowl win. With such memories locked away in his head forever, the seven-time Pro Bowler didn’t seem too bothered by losing the ring. “It’s just a hunk of metal. I’ll just have another one made, I think,” he added. “They can do that, right? Guess we’re gonna find out.” The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.
