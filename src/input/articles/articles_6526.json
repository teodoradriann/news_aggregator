    "text": "Shocking footage has captured the [terrifying moment](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/weather) a tornado hit a Manchester street, causing damage to dozens of homes and cars. There was a major incident put in place in the area after the windstorm with speeds of up to 160mph hit the residential street. One couple who were on holiday when it hit came home to find a \"fist-sized\" hole in their BMW caused by the strong winds and chaos, reports [the Manchester Evening News.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/stalybridge-tornado-greater-manchester-cctv-28360256) Craig, whose car and home were damaged, said: \"We were away in Whitby for a couple of nights and one of our neighbours called us just after it happened at midnight to let us know what the damage was. \"They told us our roof was a mess and we had a big hole in the front of our car from one of the tiles that came down. We packed up early doors and made our way home. \"We have severe roof damage - we have lost 50 to 60 tiles at the front and back of the house. The car is damaged, the bonnet, all down the side, the windscreen. The hole in the bonnet you can put your fist through it.\" He continued: \"It is a bit freaky. Our home is in the epicentre of where all the damage was caused. I have been filling out my insurance form writing 'tornado', I never thought I would write that word in my life. \"The footage from the CCTV showed garden furniture spinning around and when we looked closely you could see our shed being shaken.\" The Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) visited the site and confirmed the area was hit by a tornado with a provisional maximum damage rating of T5, which sees winds of 137 to 160 mph. The category would result in cars levitating, entire roofs being removed, items sucked from inside houses - like furniture - utility poles snapping, and older weaker buildings collapsing completely. Cllr Ged Cooney also said: “We are now in the recovery phase following the step down of a major incident declared last night when a ‘mini tornado’ hit Stalybridge. \"Thankfully there are no casualties from the incident but there are of course local residents who are devastated by the damage caused to their homes. \"With around 100 homes affected, the council is working to support residents, making sure they have a safe place to stay while they cannot re-enter their homes.\" He added: \"I’d like to thank our emergency services and council officers for all their continued work. The local community have also been so generous in offering their support and we never fail to see a true sense of community spirit and support in situations like these. I am proud of the combined efforts and the ongoing support.\" Join the Daily Record WhatsApp community! Get the latest news sent straight to your messages by joining our WhatsApp community today.

    "title": "B.C. weather: Warm conditions wreak havoc on some ski hills | CTV News",
    "text": "British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.

    "text": "24/05/2024 - 15:34 Um casal de missionários americanos foi assassinado no Haiti, juntamente com outro religioso, em um ataque de gangues criminosas, anunciaram nesta sexta-feira (24) seus familiares e a organização à qual pertenciam. A Missions in Haiti, uma organização sem fins lucrativos com sede em Oklahoma, fundada em 2000, informou que Davy e Natalie Lloyd e um terceiro missionário foram mortos a tiros por membros de gangues na noite de quinta-feira. A terceira vítima foi identificada por vários meios de comunicação americanos como Jude Montis, o diretor haitiano do grupo religioso. “Davy, Natalie e Jude foram mortos a tiros por uma gangue por volta das 21h”, informou a organização em sua página no Facebook. “Estamos devastados”, acrescentou. Ben Baker, membro da Câmara dos Representantes do Missouri, confirmou que sua filha Natalie e seu genro haviam morrido. “Eles foram atacados por gangues esta noite e ambos foram mortos”, escreveu ele no Facebook. Em reação ao ataque, a Casa Branca pediu o rápido envio ao Haiti de uma missão internacional liderada pelo Quênia. “A situação de segurança no Haiti não pode esperar”, disse um porta-voz do Conselho de Segurança Nacional, observando que o presidente Joe Biden se comprometeu a apoiar o “envio urgente” da força, durante conversas com o mandatário queniano na quinta-feira. “Nossos corações estão com as famílias dos assassinados que sofrem uma dor inimaginável”, acrescentou o porta-voz. Um porta-voz do secretário-geral da ONU, António Guterres, também expressou as suas condolências e disse que este crime é “apenas mais um exemplo da violência que não poupa ninguém no Haiti”. O presidente do Quênia, William Ruto, prometeu, durante sua visita de Estado a Washington, que a missão terá o objetivo de acabar com as gangues do Haiti, o país mais pobre das Américas. bgs/bjt/mvv/yr/jb",

    "text": "Zippy, zingy garlic – it’s a beloved aromatic staple in so many kitchens!\nFresh garlic is commonly sold as whole bulbs, which you can buy individually or in multipacks. Each bulb consists of singular cloves enclosed in a white, paper-like skin that must be removed before consumption.\nWhen raw, the taste of garlic is robust, the texture is crunchy, and the antioxidant health benefits are aplenty!\nAfter it is cooked, even for a few seconds sauteed in a skillet, the harsher flavors mellow, inviting its signature taste and scent to subtly mingle with any ingredients cooked with it.\nWe link to vendors to help you find relevant products. If you buy from one of our links,\nwe may earn a commission.\nAnd when cooked for longer periods of time, the cloves can be creamy enough to be spread on top of a piece of crusty bread, like butter!\nTo infuse the strongest, most pronounced taste and aroma into your dishes, you need to finely mince the cloves or crush them in order to release as many volatile compounds as possible.\nWithout a mechanical tool, the most efficient option to prep this perfectly pungent ingredient is with a knife. Even though that method works well, there’s are a few annoyances:\nFirst, your prep time slows down with the motion of crushing, dicing, mincing, or chopping individual cloves entirely by hand.\nAnd, perhaps even worse than increased time spent in the kitchen, your fingers are coated in the garlic’s released excretions, covering you with its strong scent that can’t easily be removed!\nAnd pre-minced garlic, like what you find in jars, often includes additives and stabilizers to maintain a longer shelf life – ingredients that lower the taste and aroma qualities of the fresh product.\nA garlic press has the ability to crush whole, fresh cloves through small perforations into a soft paste quickly, cleanly, and efficiently. This definitely speeds up your prep time without settling for a pre-minced food product.\nIn this guide, we’ll review all of our favorite models, and break down the differences of materials this tool is commonly made out of, so you can get make the most informed purchasing decision.\nGrab the mints, and let’s go shopping!\nThe Best Garlic Presses\n[Alpha Grillers](#Alpha-Grillers) [Joseph Joseph CleanForce 20179](#Joseph-Joseph-CleanForce-20179) [Mannkitchen](#Mannkitchen) [Orblue Premium AK005](#Orblue-Premium-AK005) [OXO Good Grips 11327300](#OXO-Good-Grips-11327300) [Rösle 12895](#Rosle-12895) [Zyliss Susi 3](#Zyliss-Susi-3)\nFoodal’s Top 7 Choices\n1.

The coating on these models may peel or darken with extended use.\nPlastic\nPlastic models are made to be durable, but they will not have as long of a lifespan as their metal counterparts.\nThese less expensive devices feature colorful and innovative designs with modern touches, an aesthetic update from the more classic, utilitarian appearances of metal models.\nOften combined with other materials, plastic is typically used for the handles and the body’s shell. Usually, the mechanics and perforated basket will be made out of a metal material, like stainless steel.\nFor the price difference, plastic presses work quickly and efficiently. They are best suited for occasional use, or for use as a secondary press.\nStainless Steel\nIf this will be a tool you are going to utilize on a daily basis, you should seriously consider purchasing a stainless steel model, one that is durable and resistant to corrosion and rust with repeat use and cleanings.\nThese models are on the higher-quality end of the materials spectrum, often coming with a pricier cost.\nSince quality stainless steel is rust resistant, you can be assured that these gadgets will stand the test of time.\nAfter washing, either by hand or in the dishwasher, develop the good practice of drying by hand to ensure all residue is removed.\nSwift Prep with a Cool Tool\nThe ultimate goal of a press is to\n[prep fresh cloves](/tag/Garlic/) in order to extract perfectly pungent compounds, and to create a fine paste that can easily be mixed into whatever you’re cooking…\nWithout leaving a strongly aromatic residue on your fingers!\nThe device’s ability to cleanly mince more than one whole clove with the skin still on is an impressive kitchen task, as this helps speed along the process of food preparation.\nTake your cooking style and needs into consideration when selecting the press that is best suited for your needs! A stainless steel model is more appropriate for frequent use, whereas a less expensive plastic version will achieve similar results when utilized only occasionally.\nDo you have a model in mind for your household?
