    "text": "Thailand is on a mission to address illegal mining operations causing massive power disruptions in its capital city, Bangkok, and neighboring areas.\nIn its latest drive against these unregistered operations, the kingdom’s Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) announced that it has shut down an illegal Bitcoin mining farm in the Phanat Nikhom, District of Chonburi.\nRelated Reading: UAE Bitcoin Mining Giant Makes Bold Move Into The US Market This time, the energy company worked with the Crime Suppression Division to raid the mining facility, which was suspected of tampering with the electricity meter for crypto-mining purposes.\nAccording to local reports, the PEA and CSD officers confiscated 996 Bitcoin mining machines and similar equipment. A representative of the raiding team said that crypto mining operations work with stolen power worth hundreds of millions of baht.\nThe persons responsible for the questionable crypto-mining operations are unknown, but the CSD is preparing the necessary arrest warrants from the local court.\nImage: The Nation\nIllegal Crypto Mining Remains A Problem For Thai Authorities Crypto mining is a complex technical process that requires high-end computers and related equipment. Because it requires massive power and investment in advanced equipment, it isn’t surprising that many groups run illegal crypto-mining operations.\nIn Thailand, several crypto-mining operations have been set up, and many of these have been illegally tampering with the country’s electrical supply.\nBTC is now trading at $91,987. Chart: TradingView Last November 2024, Thai authorities raided and closed at least nine illegal crypto-mining operations and charged two persons with stealing over $280k worth of electricity.\nIn 2022, Bangkok’s Department of Special Investigation also carried out raids targeting over 50 illegal crypto-mining operations.\nImage: The Nation\nChonburi Mining Operator Illegally Tapped Into Local Electricity Supply According to local reports, an unidentified employee of the mining firm tipped the authorities about the possible electricity theft in the facility. Authorities said the facility used the electricity meter correctly daily to avoid suspicions and switch to illegal tapping by night.\nPolice Maj. Gen. Montree Theskhan of the Crime Suppression Division said the company was registered for digital asset trading. However, it also operated crypto mining rigs that illegally used the state’s power supply at night.\nRelated Reading: El Salvador Pushes Crypto Forward, Grants Bitfinex Derivatives License The investigations also revealed that solar panels were added to the compound but were not used to power the mining rigs.\nIllegal Crypto Mining Operations Also Reported In Other Countries Unregistered Bitcoin mining facilities are also operating in various parts of the world. For example, in its October 2024 report, the Malaysian primary power provider reported over $100 million in losses due to theft.\nThese illegal crypto-mining activities have pushed national governments to tighten regulations and launch campaigns against violators. Some governments have banned mining and technology outright to control its negative effects.\nFeatured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView\nShare Tweet Share Share Sign Up for Our Newsletter!

    "text": "Table of Contents\nToggle\nBoeing Workers Vote Against Pay Rise Deal Implications for Boeing Union Response and Management’s Pleas Overview of the Proposed Agreement Historical Context of Labor Relations Boeing Workers Vote Against Pay Rise Deal\nThe workforce at Boeing is on the brink of a strike as the employees have turned down a provisional agreement that proposed a 25% increase in pay over four years. This decision impacts over 30,000 employees involved in manufacturing aircraft such as the 737 Max and 777 from facilities located in Seattle and Portland.\nImplications for Boeing This strike represents another challenge for Boeing, which is already grappling with significant financial losses amid efforts to rebuild its reputation after several safety incidents, including two deadly accidents. The situation also poses a considerable challenge to the company’s new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, who assumed the role recently with a mandate to revitalize the firm’s operations.\nUnion Response and Management’s Pleas This week, union leaders recommended that their members ratify the tentative agreement. In a last-minute appeal, Ortberg cautioned that moving forward with a strike could jeopardize Boeing’s recovery trajectory, stressing the potential negative impacts on the company’s future.\nOverview of the Proposed Agreement The rejected agreement not only included the substantial pay raise but also contained a provision for Boeing to commit to manufacturing its next commercial aircraft in the Seattle area if the initiative commenced during the contract term. Initially, the union sought greater concessions, including a 40% pay increase.\nHistorical Context of Labor Relations Boeing’s current contract with its employees was established in 2008 following an eight-week strike. In 2014, the parties agreed to extend this contract, which is set to expire at midnight on Thursday.",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "Heman Bekele, the 15-year-old from Annandale who invented a bar of soap that fights cancer, added another award to his list of achievements. The\nGloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes named Beleke a winner, earning him an award of $10,000 to support his research.\nThe Barron Prize, established by author T.A. Barron, honors 25 impactful young leaders ages 8 to 18 per year. Bekele was one of 15 top winners this year.\nBekele developed a bar of soap that helps treat skin cancer, delivering a cancer-fighting drug to the skin to repair damaged cells. The soap costs less than $9 per bar, and it “uses lipid-based nanoparticles to keep the cancer-fighting solution on skin even after the soap is washed off,” according to a news release from the Barron Prize.\nBekele started the research process at age 11, inspired by the lack of affordable health care and high levels of sun exposure that happens to workers in Ethiopia, where he was born and raised.\n“This experience has taught me that the possibilities for change are limitless,” Heman said in a news release. “I am just a 14-year-old boy, and yet I now know that my voice can be heard and that with hard work, passion, and perseverance, I can make a difference in the world.”\nThis isn’t the first time the teen earned national recognition for his invention. In 2023, he became\nAmerica’s Top Young Scientist by 3M and Discovery Education — a distinction that came with a $25,000 research grant. He is also Time’s 2024 Kid of the Year.\nBekele is now pursuing Food and Drug Administration certification for his soap and conducting clinical trials on mice. He hopes to continue his research through college and start a nonprofit to distribute the soap around the world by 2028.\n“Nothing is more inspiring than stories about heroic people who have truly made a difference to the world,” says T. A. Barron. “And we need our heroes today more than ever. Not celebrities, but heroes – people whose character can inspire us all. That is the purpose of the Barron Prize: to shine the spotlight on these amazing young people so that their stories will inspire others.”\nFeature image of Heman Bekele courtesy Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes\nFor more stories like this,\nsubscribe to Northern Virginia Magazine’s News newsletter.",

    "text": "Dice que no se alegra del final \"siniestro\" de quien fuera su \"amigo\"\nMADRID, 24 Oct. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nEl exvicepresidente del Gobierno y exlíder de Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, ha reprochado al jefe del Ejecutivo, Pedro Sánchez, que se \"acuerde más\" en redes sociales de su socio Sumar que de las \"víctimas\" del exdiputado Íñigo Errejón, a la vez que ha señalado que en Madrid ya se hablaba de otra denuncia por una agresión sexista propiciada por el exportavoz parlamentario.\nEn concreto, Iglesias ha afeado el mensaje de Sánchez donde ha trasladado su \"confianza\" a la vicepresidenta segunda y ministra de Trabajo, Yolanda Díaz, y a Sumar tras las acusaciones en redes por comportamientos machistas del ya exdiputado del Congreso. En la publicación en X, el presidente del Gobierno ha mostrado su condena \"a quienes atentan contra este proyecto de igualdad\" y ha mandado su apoyo a las mujeres que sufren acoso y abusos.\nEl exlíder de Podemos ha destacado la valentía de la periodista Cristina Fallarás por atreverse a abrir \"un espacio de seguridad para que las mujeres puedan denunciar cosas que eran muy difíciles de denunciar en este país\". Así, ha recordado que ya hubo un mensaje que circuló hace un año entre los periodistas de Madrid donde \"una joven denunciaba una agresión en una fiesta en Castellón\" por parte de Errejón.\n\"De esto se hablaba, pero había muchas víctimas que no encontraban un espacio seguro para denunciar\", ha reiterado Iglesias en declaraciones en el programa '59 segundos' de TVE, recogidas por Europa Press, donde ha apuntado que no está contento por lo sucedido. \"No tenía ni buena opinión personal ni política de Errejón y hace más de cinco años que no hablamos ni compartimos entornos, pero fue mi amigo y no me alegro de que tenga un final tan siniestro\", ha confesado.\nEn este contexto, ha criticado el mensaje de Sánchez hacia su socio de gobierno, recalcando que \"lo primero son las víctimas\". \"Creo que debería escuchar un poco menos a sus amigos cuarentones y cincuentones que no entendían al Ministerio de Igualdad y recordar que gracias a la ley 'sólo si es sí', del anterior Ministerio de Igualdad, hoy cualquier mujer, sin necesidad de una sentencia judicial, tiene la consideración de víctima\", ha rememorado.\nPor último, y preguntado por si había detectado este tipo de comportamiento machista en Errejón, el exlíder de Podemos lo ha descartado. \"Es verdad que yo llevo más de cinco años sin tratar con él, había escuchado cosas sobre todo después del último año, pero cuando yo le conocí no era así\", ha zanjado.\nLeer más acerca de: Pedro Sánchez Pablo Iglesias Íñigo Errejón Podemos Sumar",
