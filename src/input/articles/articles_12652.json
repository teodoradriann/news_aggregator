    "title": "Dos detenidos en Rosario por las amenazas a Di María",
    "text": "Hace pocos días, Ángel Di María confirmó que continuará en Benfica de Portugal. Gonzalo Belloso, presidente de Rosario Central , señaló que las amenazas que recibió “Fideo” es una de las principales razones. Y con respecto a esas amenazas, hubo avances en la causa, ya que en las últimas horas fueron detenidos dos sospechosos. Alejandro 'Rengo' Ficadenti y Sergio 'Bebe' Di Vanni, ambos vinculados a la barrabrava de Newell's, fueron detenidos por la Policía, acusados de ser los responsables de las amenazas que Di María recibió en su casa del barrio privado Miraflores, de la ciudad de Funes, a fines de marzo. Luego de los operativos realizados por la Policía de Investigaciones en la zona oeste de la ciudad santafesina, también se allanó también la casa de Marcelo 'Colo' Rubattino, otro apuntado como integrante de la facción. Se incautaron dos millones y medio de pesos y tres teléfonos. En otros siete allanamientos, se encontraron más de 17 millones de pesos, y más celulares. El presidente de Rosario Central explicó por qué Di María no volverá al club: “No sentía las garantías” El sábado se confirmó la continuidad de Ángel Di María en Benfica al menos por un año más, cortando, por ahora, la ilusión de su regreso a Rosario Central. Gonzalo Belloso, presidente del “canalla”, explicó los motivos. “La vuelta de Angelito era un sueño para todos. A lo largo del último año, creció mucho la idea de que él venía. Fuimos haciendo muchas cosas en conjunto. Creíamos y creemos que estábamos en un gran momento para recibirlo, con un plantel afianzado, con muchos refuerzos, un técnico de la casa y una estructura sólida del club. Era el mejor momento para que pudiese venir\", aseguró Belloso en una entrevista radial. “Él nos informó luego de las amenazas que empezó a poner en duda la posibilidad de venir, que no se sentía seguro y que iba a tomar una decisión finalizando la Copa América. El sábado a la tarde nos comunicamos con él, me dijo la decisión, que no sentía las garantías de seguridad para él y su familia. Ante eso, no puedo abrir un juicio de valor, son cuestiones personales”, completó el dirigente “canalla”.",

    "title": "What's next for Baltimore pizzeria after getting favorable review and $60K donation? - pennlive.com",
    "text": "By Dan Belson, Baltimore Sun\n(TNS)\nThere was no sitting room, and barely any standing room, at TinyBrickOven on Thursday, a day after the South Baltimore pizza shop had originally been slated to close.\nThe post-Christmas full house was anticipated after the small Light Street pizza shop got a publicity boost and a $60,000 commitment on Monday from Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy. Jeff Taylor, owner of Westminster-based catering business Staglio Pizza, was in to assist TinyBrickOven owner William Fagg as the team made pies for customers.\n“His pies are amazing, his attitude’s amazing,” Fagg said of his pizza-tossing friend.\nFagg received the five-figure influx of cash after telling Portnoy that he would need roughly $60,000 to stay in business for the next year. Portnoy, a part-time pizza influencer reviewing the Federal Hill shop, replied that it was “done” before offering Fagg a handshake during his “one-bite” critique posted Monday.\nWhat’s next for TinyBrickOven? Fagg has been seeking a liquor license for years after opening up the small New York-style pizza shop in 2019. While cooking pizzas during Thursday’s lunch rush, he said getting a license to serve beer and wine would mean “that we’d be on an even playing field” with competitors in South Baltimore.\nChief among the competition is Cross Street Market, which is located next door, and includes a pizza shop that can serve beer with its slices. Fagg said that he has nothing against the market or Pizza di Joey, but thinks that there should be room for his small business to compete.\nFagg, a Navy veteran, said that his pizzeria obtaining such a liquor permit hinges on not just the Baltimore City Board of Liquor License Commissioners, but also the state legislature. The Maryland General Assembly would need to pass legislation adjusting certain alcohol control rules before he can be granted an application, he said.\nAs he cooked pizzas on Thursday, Fagg noted that couldn’t completely wrap his head around the specifics of what the state legislation would entail. Federal Hill, already densely packed with noisy bars as well as residential buildings, is a notoriously difficult place to secure a license, and TinyBrickOven is located in a central area close to the main drag.\nThe pizzeria’s website urges supporters to contact Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson and Baltimore Del. Luke Clippinger, who did not return requests for comment on Thursday, about passing legislation needed to grant Fagg a beer and wine license. Fagg said he’s also pitched legislation that would create a “locals-only” liquor permit for small businesses to serve locally made beer and wine.\nThe $60,000 cash infusion from Portnoy should help the shop stay open for at least a year and get its license, Fagg said. His restaurant, previously on the brink of closing, is now eyeing its own commercial space .\nFagg’s restaurant is known for its involvement in the surrounding community, often running fundraisers for people in need. During the holiday season, the restaurant runs a “Pay-It-Forward Program” where donations help provide hot pizzas to struggling families and people experiencing homelessness.\nWho is Dave Portnoy? The local pizza shop’s booster, Dave Portnoy, is most widely known for the sports and pop culture media brand he founded, Barstool Sports. Starting as a weekly print publication in 2003, Barstool has grown into a national digital media empire churning out sports and pop culture content.\nPortnoy, who serves as Barstool’s president, has branded himself through a blunt, pizza- and sports-loving persona as “El Presidente.” He has a history of pushing back against critics who have accused him of making racist and misogynistic comments . Portnoy recently lost a defamation lawsuit against Insider.com after the outlet published two reports citing women who accused Portnoy of sexual misconduct.\nOn top of being a major promoter of online sports betting, Portnoy, 47, is considered to be one of the pizza world’s biggest influencers . His “one bite” pizza reviews, uploaded nearly every weekday , have enough reach to either rescue a struggling pizza shops or kill business for good when he renders his score on a 0 to 10 scale, including decimals.\nHis verdict after taking multiple bites of a TinyBrickOven pie outside the Baltimore shop this week was a 7.9, praising the pizza’s “nice undercarriage” and Fagg’s “upbeat” spirit.\n“There’s no way this place should be going out of business,” Portnoy said.\n“Cost me 60 dimes right there, but whatever,” Portnoy said as he left the shop, using an expletive while commenting that he’s a “nice” person.\nHave a news tip?

    "title": "Democrat congressman calls for decriminalizing sex work after bombshell House report on Matt Gaetz | The Independent",
    "text": "A Democratic congressman is calling for the U.S. to decriminalize sex work nationwide in response to damning findings released by the House Ethics Committee about Matt Gaetz .Shri Thanedar of Michigan wrote in a Twitter post on Thursday that sex workers should be able to come to law enforcement when they are victims of abuse, adding that decriminalizing sex work would aid in efforts to prevent children from being trafficked and otherwise exploited.“We should decriminalize sex work to maximize sex workers' legal protection and their ability to exercise other rights, including unionization, justice, and health care. Decriminalization and regulation would prevent trafficking and exploitation of minors,” wrote Thanedar.The congressman added in a second post: “It also helps them report crimes against them.”Sex work is legal in just one state in the U.S.: Nevada. It is heavily regulated, and a 2023 count reported that less than two dozen businesses were operating statewide.Thanedar’s comments came in response to an allegation from the House Ethics Committee that Gaetz likely violated Florida’s statutory rape law during his time as a congressman and “regularly paid women for engaging in sexual activity with him” from 2017 to 2020. The committee spoke to one woman who said she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17 and was paid $400, “which she understood to be payment for sex.”Gaetz strongly denied the accusations and pointed to the Department of Justice’s decision not to bring charges against him as evidence of his innocence. The House voted to release the report on Gaetz in early December, after the ex-congressman resigned from Congress and then withdrew his bid for attorney general amid sexual misconduct allegations.That bid to lead the agency which once investigated him failed as it became clear that several Republican senators, in addition to the chamber’s Democrats , were unmovable in their opposition to his nomination.Gaetz is now headed to Trump-friendly cable network One America News and openly hinting about running for governor in 2026. But the rabble-rousing Trump loyalist has few close allies beyond the former president himself, and is expected to face strong opposition for the role if he runs.Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy predicted to The Independent at the 2024 Republican convention in Milwaukee (where he and Gaetz had a confrontation on the event floor) that the allegations being investigated by the Ethics committee would specifically sink Gaetz’s bid for governor. The two men loathe each other, in particular after the Florida congressman led a successful bid to oust McCarthy from the speakership in 2023. This article was amended on January 2, 2025. It originally stated that Shri Thanedar is a U.S. representative from Illinois, but that was incorrect. He is a Michigan representative.",
