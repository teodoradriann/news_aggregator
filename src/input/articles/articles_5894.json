    "title": "Howard the Duck Gets Married to an MCU Favorite (and They Had a Kid)",
    "text": "[What If…](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/what-if-season-3-complete-trilogy/) continues its series of zany speculative adventures involving fan-favorite characters from across the Marvel Cinematic Universe as [Howard the Duck](https://comicbook.com/comics/news/howard-the-duck-marvel-50th-anniversary-special/) ties the knot with none other than Darcy Lewis, the former intern for Jane Foster first introduced in 2011’s Thor. Not only does the anthropomorphic waterfowl get married, but he and the Mrs. also have a child which, because this takes place in the MCU, has considerable cosmic consequences. All this and more occurred in the appropriately titled episode, “What If… Howard the Duck Got Hitched?”\nVideos by ComicBook.com\nWhile initially hesitant about going on a date with Howard, it doesn’t take long before Darcy falls in love with the talking duck, eventually getting married and having a child. But because theirs is an interspecies relationship, the child is birthed in the form of an egg born during an intergalactic event, unbeknownst to the couple. The egg becomes the target of numerous major players across the cosmos, such as Yondu Udanta, the Grandmaster, and Kaecilius (who wants the unborn child to serve as an earthly vessel for Dormammu).\nLuckily, Howard and Darcy are aided by some unexpected allies, including Nick Fury and Phil Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. (who then tries to confiscate the egg), and even Loki. However, that’s still not enough to protect their child, who is now sought after by Malekith, Zeus, and [Thanos](https://comicbook.com/comics/news/thanos-mcu-inspired-redesign-marvel-comics-avengers-annual-infinity-watch/) and his Black Order. Seemingly cornered, Howard and Darcy serenade the egg with KISS’ classic hit, “I Was Made for Lovin’ You,” which unintentionally sets off its cosmic power that easily destroys most of its enemies. A human/duck hybrid baby girl emerges from the egg and is quickly welcomed by its new parents, naming their child Byrdie. A reluctant Fury ultimately lets the couple and their newborn go on to become a family.\n[RELATED: [Marvel’s What If…? Season 3 Episodes Revealed With Surprising MCU Connections](https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/marvel-what-if-season-3-eternals-howard-the-duck/)]\nSo much of the fun behind What If… comes from its ability to take secondary characters from the MCU and give them the spotlight in ways that sometimes make the main continuity established in previous films and TV shows seem bland by comparison. “What If… Howard the Duck Got Hitched?” is no exception to this series’ stellar run. Seeing Howard the Duck get elevated to his current status in pop culture has been a fascinating experience, especially considering he made his big screen debut in 1986’s cinematic embarrassment, Howard the Duck, which has the unique distinction of being the first big-budget movie based on a Marvel character.\nStill, James Gunn revived the character from relative obscurity by reintroducing him in the post-credits scene for 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy, played by Robot Chicken co-creator Seth Green. While not originating in the comics (though she would later make her [comic debut in the 2023 series Scarlet Witch](https://comicbook.com/comics/news/marvel-comics-darcy-lewis-first-appearance-scarlet-witch-2/)), Darcy has become beloved by fans for her droll sarcasm which perfectly contrasts the otherworldly events portrayed in the Thor films and WandaVision Disney+ series. Howard and Darcy’s snarky personalities are oddly perfect for one another, despite their, um, biological differences, so here’s hoping we get to see more of their relationship in future MCU projects.",

A desoneração teve a promulgação oficializada nesta quarta-feira (27). O ministro da Fazenda, Fernando Haddad, afirmou a jornalistas nesta quinta (28) que o governo vai editar uma Medida Provisória este ano revogando a lei e criando outra forma de vantagem tributária a empresas. \"Eu não vejo essa medida provisória como um bom caminho. O mais certo era deixar andar a lei como já foi promulgada e, no decorrer do exercício futuro, discutir outra maneira de ajustar via projeto de lei. E não por medida provisória, cujos efeitos são imediatos\", disse Coronel, de acordo com relatos publicados no [ jornal O Estado de S.Paulo](https://www.estadao.com.br/economia/relator-desoneracao-haddad-relacao-congresso/). \"Isso dá uma fragilizada na relação do Poder Executivo com o Congresso já que foi um projeto aprovado com ampla maioria na Câmara e no Senado, o governo vetou e o veto foi derrubado também com maioria esmagadora. Aí vem uma medida provisória em cima desse texto? Eu acho isso muito perigoso e tende a ferir, a fragilizar a relação do Congresso com o governo\".

    "text": "Five Rhode Island schools receive national recognition for civic engagement efforts Alexander Castro Thu, December 5, 2024 at 10:20 PM UTC 3 min read\nA student is seen on the Community College of Rhode Island’s Knight Campus in Warwick on the first day of spring semester classes in January 2024. (Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)\nFor the second consecutive election season, Brown University and the Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI) won national recognition for their efforts supporting civic engagement among students.\nThe ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge, part of the nonprofit ecosystem Civic Nation, named 471 institutions of higher education this year as “Most Engaged Campuses for College Student Voting.” Brown was awarded a “silver” distinction for its voter turnout in 2022. CCRI was the only public higher ed institution in Rhode Island to earn the award, and scored a “bronze” distinction for 2022 turnout among its students.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Johnson & Wales University ( JWU ), Rhode Island School of Design ( RISD ) and Salve Regina University also won recognition for being “Highly Engaged” campuses.\n“CCRI is deeply committed to fostering a strong democratic society by empowering our students and community members with the knowledge and tools they need to engage in civic life so they are well-informed and empowered to make their voices heard at the ballot box,” said Rosemary A. Costigan, the school’s interim president, in a statement released Tuesday.\nTo qualify for recognition, institutions must actively participate in the ALL IN program. That includes sharing National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement (NSLVE) reports with ALL IN as well as developing voting engagement action plans and pledging to foster voting efforts.\nCCRI’s initiatives to boost student voter participation in the 2024 election included events like a campus-wide celebration of National Voter Registration Day. The school also made voting resources readily available during orientation week. The school’s collaboration with ALL IN dates to 2020, when members of the Phi Theta Kappa Pi Omicron fraternity launched efforts to get students to the polls.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Performance in previous elections also informs ALL IN’s awards. Jennifer M. Domagal-Goldman, the executive director of ALL IN, said in an email that the highly-engaged schools “are on-average outperforming their peer institutions in terms of voter participation rates by nearly 4 percentage points,” a trend that has held true across the 2018, 2020 and 2022 elections.\nDomagal-Goldman said data for the 2024 election, which is taken from NSLVE reports, will likely arrive next fall.\nCCRI has three awards from ALL IN, the second highest amount statewide after Brown, which first took the challenge in 2016. Other institutions — including RISD and JWU took the challenge for the first time this year.\nThe NLSVE reports suggest CCRI’s efforts may be working. In the 2022 midterm election, the school had a 22.5% voting rate — lower than Brown’s above-average voting rate of 32.1% that year, but also higher than the 16.1% observed at RISD , Brown’s neighbor in Providence’s College Hill neighborhood.\nAdvertisement Advertisement More in U.S. Passenger stinks up entire plane with ‘diabolical’ in-flight meal choice: ‘Scented food is a crime’ NY Post Cops Close in on Grinning Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s Murder as They Probe Gun Purchase The Daily Beast Massive lottery jackpot is set to expire. Mystery player was part of an incredibly rare draw LA Times 'Today' anchor Hoda Kotb says a former boss told her she might want to 'get on the treadmill' Business Insider They are deeply aware, in intimate ways, of the issues that local and state government grapple with each day.\n– Matthew Ulricksen, associate professor of political science at Community College of Rhode Island\nMatthew Ulricksen, who teaches courses on American government and state politics, wasn’t surprised CCRI students tend to be politically engaged in midterm elections, which historically see lower turnout. They largely live and work in Rhode Island, Ulricksen said, and, “They have skin in the game.”\n“They are deeply aware, in intimate ways, of the issues that local and state government grapple with each day,” Ulricksen said. “They might not be directly cognizant of it, but they live with the challenges of food insecurity, housing insecurity, public transportation, discrimination, what have you.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement The school’s diversity spans racial and ethnic categories — a little under half of the student body is white — and also age and previous educational attainment. Most students attend part-time and may work jobs or raise families alongside their education, and about a third of students are over the age of 25 .\n“Community colleges are probably the singular democratizing force in American society today,” Ulricksen argued. “They are vehicles for any person from any segment of society to empower themselves.”\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 14,762 people played the daily Crossword recently.
