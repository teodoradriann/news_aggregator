    "text": "Tech Job Market Cools as Demand for Developers Plummets The meteoric rise of developer jobs appears to be cooling significantly, with thousands of positions disappearing and once-eager job seekers facing intense competition.\nA recent survey by Job Korea revealed a staggering 46.5% drop in developer job postings in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period last year. This marks a stark contrast to the booming market of 2021, when nearly 300,000 developer positions were advertised.\n\"There are too many developers around me who have been recommended to retire, whether they are freelancers or full-time employees. I’m also scared when I’m going to be shot,\" shared Kim, a 31-year-old developer with six years of experience in Seoul.\nThe online gaming giants Naver and Kakao, once considered the Holy Grail for aspiring developers, also saw their new hires plummet from 599 to 231 and 870 to 452 respectively between 2022 and 2023. This trend is projected to continue, with 34% of corporate executives surveyed in September expecting to reduce developer hiring this year.\nThis chill in the market is manifesting in the struggle faced by recent graduates and career changers.\n\"It was really hard to get a job this year, but the economy is bad and there are too many developers,” confided Cho, a 28-year-old job seeker who has spent the last 11 months searching for his first developer role.\nEven those with specialized skills find themselves at a disadvantage. \"It seems that the demand for Python developers has increased by three times compared to three months ago. Although I work for a small company with about 20 people, over 300 people applied.\" Jeong, a 30-year-old developer observed.\nAdding to the anxieties, established tech companies are also resorting to restructuring and proposing early retirement packages to developers, exacerbating the already competitive environment.\nBootcamps, once a popular pathway for rapid entry into the tech field, are facing declining enrollment as the wave of hiring slows down.\n\"The number of students attending our academy has decreased significantly these days. We have to register at least seven people per class, but even this is not easy,” noted an official at a bootcamp academy in Seoul.\nFaced with this reality, bootcamps are adjusting their curricula to incorporate in-demand skills like artificial intelligence, reflecting the changing landscape of the tech industry.\nThis cooling trend raises concerns not only for individuals navigating the job market but also for the broader tech landscape. The reduced influx of new talent could potentially hinder innovation and slow down the pace of technological advancement.\n2024-11-29 22:18:00\n#scared #dont #cut #time #job #seeker #유지희의 #ITMI\n## Tech Job Market Chilled: What’s⁢ Behind‍ the Developer Glut?\nThe seemingly unstoppable growth of ​the tech industry has hit a sudden snag. In a surprising twist, demand for developers is ⁣plummeting, ‍leaving thousands of skilled professionals jobless adn recent⁤ graduates facing a brutal job market.⁢ A⁤ recent survey by⁤ Job Korea‍ revealed a staggering ⁣46.5% ‌drop in developer job postings in the first half ⁢of 2024, a stark contrast to ⁢the booming 2021 market.\nTo untangle this‌ unexpected shift, we spoke with two ⁤leading experts‍ in the field. **Dr. Sarah Lee**, Professor of Computer Science at ⁢Seoul National University‌ and ​author of‍ “Decoding the ⁣Digital Economy,” brings ⁤her in-depth understanding of the tech landscape to the conversation. ⁣joining her​ is **mr. ⁤James ⁢Kim**, CEO ​of CodeCamp​ Korea, a leading coding bootcamp in Seoul, offering valuable insight into the immediate impact on aspiring developers.\n### The Data Tells ​a Story: Why the Sudden Decline?\n**World​ Today ⁤News:** Dr. ⁢Lee,the​ numbers paint a grim picture⁢ for developers. What⁢ factors are driving ​this sudden ⁢decline in demand?\n**Dr. Sarah⁤ Lee:** Several factors are contributing to this ‍cooling trend. The global economic slowdown is playing​ a significant‍ role. Companies are‍ tightening their budgets‍ and prioritizing profitability over⁣ rapid expansion, leading‌ to reduced hiring across the board.\nMoreover,⁢ the initial surge in tech hiring during the pandemic might have created an oversupply of developers.\n**World Today News:** mr. Kim, from⁣ your perspective, how are coding ​bootcamps responding‍ to this changing landscape?\n**Mr. James Kim:** ​We’re definitely seeing a decrease in ⁣enrollment. Students are hesitant to invest in intensive training when job prospects seem uncertain. To adapt, we’re revamping our curriculum, focusing on in-demand skills like AI‌ and machine learning.\n**”The ‍tech industry ​is evolving rapidly, ⁤and we need to ensure our graduates are equipped with the skills employers are‌ looking for.” **\n### A Tech Talent Crunch?\n**World Today News:** Dr. Lee, do​ you see this as a temporary blip, or could this ⁢be the start of ‍a ⁢longer-term trend?\n**dr. Sarah Lee:** Its likely a combination of ‌both. The economic recovery will undoubtedly revive some‌ hiring, but the tech industry ‌is also undergoing a fundamental​ shift. ⁣**Automation and AI are reshaping job roles, requiring developers ‍to possess a broader skillset.**\n**World Today News:** Mr. Kim, what advice woudl you⁢ give to aspiring developers ‍entering this uncertain market?\n**Mr. James⁤ Kim**: Don’t​ be discouraged! While the job market is competitive, specialized ‌skills are still highly valued.\n**focus on building a strong portfolio, networking effectively, and continuously learning ​new technologies to stay ahead of the curve.**\n### Navigating the⁢ New Reality:\n**World ‍Today News:** ⁣dr. Lee, ⁢what are the⁣ implications of this‌ cooling trend for innovation within the tech sector?\n**Dr. Sarah Lee:** Reduced hiring could ⁤potentially stifle innovation in⁤ the short ⁣term. Startups may find‍ it ​harder to attract talent, and established companies might ‍scale back on R&D.‍ **However, challenging ‍times often foster creativity.** We may see ‍a rise in independent developers and smaller teams pushing the boundaries of technology.\n**World Today News:**⁤ Mr. Kim, where do you see the tech job market headed in the next year?\n**Mr. James Kim:**​ I expect a gradual recovery,⁢ but the focus will shift towards **quality⁣ over quantity.** Employers will⁤ prioritize experienced developers with specialized skills and a proven track record.\n**Key Takeaways**:\n– The ⁤tech job market is experiencing a significant cooling down, ‍with a sharp decrease in developer positions.\n-‍ Economic‌ slowdown and ​an oversupply of developers are ⁢key factors driving this shift.\n– Aspiring developers should focus on ‌specialized skills, portfolio ⁤building, and continuous​ learning.\n– Long-term impacts on‌ innovation remain to ‍be seen, but⁤ adaptation and resilience will be crucial.\n**What are your thoughts on the⁣ future of the tech job market?

By: Lifestyle Desk New Delhi | September 13, 2024 13:27 IST 5 min read This incident raises important questions about the implications of social media engagement on job security and the evolving dynamics of workplace surveillance. (Source: Freepik) A mental health startup company recently fired an employee for liking a LinkedIn post that criticised toxic workplaces .\nThe ex-employee took to Reddit to share their ordeal, describing her workplace as an extremely toxic environment, with having to deal with a toxic manager, CEO and being made to follow strange rules.\nThe user, who goes by the Reddit name ‘Ashiean’, mentioned how she had the “displeasure of joining a mental health startup company,” where “the manager honestly made my life a living hell at work.”\nAdvertisement She added, “She was an extremely hostile person and always used to play dumb when the CEO was talking (sic).”\nShe went on to describe the impact such an aggressive environment had on her. “The toxicity started affecting me so badly that people around me got to know about it. There were times when I used to cry in the office toilet. It was that bad.”\nShe explained that the LinkedIn post she liked was about a topic she felt deeply passionate about — employee mental health — so she didn’t see any harm in liking it. She also mentioned that the post felt highly relatable to her.\n“The next thing I know is my CEO calls me over and fired me saying she can’t work with me because apparently I am spreading wrong things about the company,” she revealed.\nFired for liking a post on LinkedIn\nbyu/ashiean inIndianWorkplace\nAdvertisement This incident raises important questions about the implications of social media engagement on job security and the evolving dynamics of workplace surveillance. As companies become increasingly aware of their digital footprint, employees’ online activities are often scrutinised, leading to potential conflicts between freedom of expression and corporate reputation management.\nKnowing their online activity is being watched can make employees anxious. (Source: Freepik) But, what effect does it have? Gurleen Baruah, occupational psychologist and executive coach at That Culture Thing, tells indianexpress.com , “When employees feel their social media activity is being monitored by their employer , it can lead to several psychological effects that impact their well-being and performance.”\nHere’s a breakdown of how this can affect them:\nAnxiety and stress can skyrocket: Knowing their online activity is being watched can make employees anxious. They may worry about being judged or punished for what they post, even if it’s unrelated to work. This constant pressure can make them feel like they’re walking on eggshells, which leads to stress.\nAdvertisement Trust starts to crumble: When employers monitor social media, employees may feel like their personal space is being invaded, eroding the trust between them and their bosses. If they believe their employer doesn’t trust them, they’re likely to disengage.\nPrivacy concerns take over: One of the biggest worries employees have is that their personal boundaries are being crossed. Monitoring social media, especially personal accounts, can make them feel uncomfortable or even violated.\nFear of punishment looms: Employees may become paranoid that anything they post could lead to trouble at work. Whether it’s sharing opinions or simply interacting online, the fear of punishment can cause them to censor themselves unnecessarily.\nRebellion or retaliation: Interestingly, feeling monitored can sometimes backfire. Some employees might respond by becoming defiant or disengaged, doing the bare minimum or finding ways to resist the monitoring. This behaviour, known as counterproductive work behaviour, can harm both the employee and the company.\nAdvertisement How should companies balance protecting their reputation and maintaining a healthy work culture? According to Baruah, “Balancing the protection of a company’s reputation with maintaining a healthy work culture, while avoiding invasive surveillance, is a delicate but crucial task. Companies must focus on fostering trust and transparency while safeguarding their interests.”\nHere are some steps to take:\nBe Transparent: Clearly communicate the purpose and scope of monitoring to reduce anxiety and build trust. Involve employees in decision-making about surveillance practices.\nLimit to Work-Related Metrics: Monitor only work-related activities, avoiding personal behaviour unless legally justified. Restrict monitoring to work hours and devices.\nBuild Trust and Autonomy: Foster a culture of trust and accountability rather than relying on surveillance. Empowered employees are more aligned with company values.\nAdvertisement Use Monitoring for Positive Reinforcement: Use data to support and reward employees, not to punish them, to maintain morale and engagement.\nReview Practices Regularly: Regularly assess and adjust monitoring practices to ensure they are necessary and respectful of privacy, involving employee feedback.",

    "text": "As we are about to enter 2024, it is a good time to make some plans for the New Year. There are individuals, home and family members, community, church and national issues that need much prayer. We as Christians are called to ‘stand in the gap’, ‘make up the hedge’ and to intercede for these things. Jeremiah declared “Call upon me and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things which you know not.” We have a God who calls us to ask, seek and knock and that He will answer our prayers. The Bible has shown us that much is accomplished in prayer. Jesus was a man with a great prayer life and so were the men and women of the Bible. Their prayers made a profound difference in the things they prayed for in the forming of the New Testament Church.\nSo, how do we pray effectively? Here are some excellent suggestions from the Bible. We pray to the Father in Jesus name, in the power of the Spirit, in faith believing and in harmony with principles from the Bible. What do we pray for? We pray for our family with all their needs especially to come to salvation. We pray for our church, the pastor and leaders and the needs of the people that we know there. We pray for the community and the culture around us including the community leaders, our schools, our medical and emergency personnel and others that we know need our prayers. We pray for our nation that righteousness would prevail and corruption exposed and dealt with. There are things that concern us and those should be turned into prayers and then released to God. There are unsaved loved ones that weigh us down because of the things they are doing that are hurting them. God loves them very much. There are decisions being made by leaders that we realize will destroy us and we need to stand for right decisions. When we pray these things that are on our hearts, God hears and answers them. Watch for the answer. Look for little signs along the way!\nMany times we give up give up on our prayers because they are not answered quickly or like we thought. Scripture encourages us to keep praying and there will be break throughs. Remember that when we are praying for others God does not force people to change but He works things in a way that those who are getting His attention are led to make right decisions. He helps to make them open to Him. For instance, He draws them, gives them insights, brings others into their life to share with them, brings them to a place where they cry out for help and many other things He may do to get them to receive His love and receive Him as Lord and Savior. Remember too that the draw of fleshly appetites, the beckoning of worldly pleasure, money and power have a strong hold that needs to be broken. It may take some time. So, you pray, He softens their hearts, their hearts open to God and circumstances change. Change is a process! The beauty of it all is that prayer changes people, situations and outcomes. Fervent prayers produce phenomenal results. Prayer is the mightiest agent to advance the work of God. God does nothing but by prayer and everything with it. You can make a difference in 2024 in your family, church, community, nation and even the world. God is looking for people to “stand in the gap”.\nLet’s close with some quotes from God’s Word. “He shall call upon Me and I will answer him, and be with him in trouble. I will deliver him and honor him. If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, you shall ask what you will and it shall be done!",
