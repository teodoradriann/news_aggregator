    "text": "Más allá de las ventajas que ofrece en términos de rotación y diversificación de los cultivos, la canola se presenta como una alternativa sumamente rentable, con una demanda creciente a nivel local e internacional. En Paraguay, aún falta mayor impulso para que cada vez más productores apuesten por esta especie de oleaginosa, que se estima este año alcanzará una siembra de 60.000 hectáreas. El ingeniero agrónomo Nilson Osterlein, investigador del cultivo de canola en Paraguay, destacó a La Nación/ Nación Media que esta variedad de oleaginosa comenzó a tomar fuerza como una opción o especie diferente para rotación de los cultivos de invierno, ya sea trigo o maíz zafriña, que no solo es muy ventajosa en términos agronómicos (de diversificación o rotación), sino también en materia económica, ante buenos precios y una demanda creciente. Así, de la mano de una genética mejorada y apropiada para la región y los conocimientos técnicos adecuados para su desarrollo, según Osterlein, el área de cultivo de canola ha ido expandiéndose paulatinamente en Paraguay. De hecho, según datos del Instituto de Biotecnología Agrícola (Inbio), de 2022 a 2023 creció en 13.805 hectáreas, pasando de 78.189 a 91.993 hectáreas. Para este 2024, las proyecciones apuntan a alcanzar una siembra de 60.000 hectáreas. RADIOGRAFÍA DEL CULTIVO DE CANOLA EN PARAGUAY Actualmente, de acuerdo con el ingeniero agrónomo, el cultivo de canola se concentra en Alto Paraná, Caaguazú, Caazapá e Itapúa, con una expansión hacia Misiones, Canindeyú e incluso, San Pedro. “También se tuvo experiencias en el Chaco, lo que demuestra que el cultivo se puede adaptar a cualquier región, con investigación y consejos técnicos adecuados”, agregó. En general, casi la totalidad del cultivo de canola se procesa en Paraguay, por medio del trabajo de tres únicas industrias, según el experto, quien además es responsable de investigación y asesoramiento técnico a productores de la firma CW Trading. “Si bien la mayor parte del cultivo se procesa en Paraguay, hay una demanda internacional creciente. Mercados internacionales buscan canola, sobre todo en Europa, Asia y otros países árabes, pero por el área que tiene Paraguay aún no llegó a sobrar producción para realizar exportaciones de gran volumen”, detalló el experto a LN/NM. En este sentido, el ingeniero agrónomo hizo énfasis en que la canola tiene aún un futuro prometedor en Paraguay, con gran potencial para seguir creciendo gracias a la genética ya adecuada a nuestra región y los conocimientos técnicos aprendidos a lo largo de los años. “Lo que falta es que el productor vaya adoptando el cultivo e incorporando dentro de su sistema de rotación. En el fondo tenemos las herramientas necesarias”, reflexionó. UTILIDADES Osterlein dijo cuáles son las principales bondades y utilidades de la canola en el mercado, más allá de las ventajas que ofrece para diversificar los cultivos. Entre sus principales usos y demanda detrás de su procesamiento, se destaca el aceite de esta oleaginosa, que es uno de los más saludables para la salud, debido a su bajísima composición en ácidos grasos saturados (apenas 5 %), frente a su riqueza en omega-3. Al igual que el aceite, también se produce harina a base de canola debido a su alta concentración de proteínas, casi 36 %, que la hace atractiva para la ración de animales, precisó el experto. Otra de las principales demandas de la canola es el biocombustible, siendo el más interesado la Unión Europea. “Ante el objetivo de reducir el uso de combustible fósil y atendiendo que los vegetales son menos poluyentes que los fósiles, ahí entra la canola como un factor importante por su calidad, octanaje y su punto de congelamiento muy bajo. Hay una demanda creciente también en este sector”, agregó.",

Picture: REUTERS/DOAA AL BAZ\nWashington — The US is studying Hamas’ response to a ceasefire proposal and will discuss it with allies in the Middle East in the coming hours, the state department said on Monday.\nThe Palestinian militant group Hamas said earlier it had accepted a ceasefire and hostages-for-prisoners swap proposal from Egyptian and Qatari mediators after weeks of stop-start talks on a deal for a temporary pause in fighting.\nAn Israeli official said no ceasefire agreement had been reached. “This would appear to be a ruse intended to make Israel look like the side refusing a deal,” the Israeli official said.\n“I can confirm that Hamas has issued a response. We are reviewing that response now and discussing it with our partners in the region,” state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday afternoon, confirming that a response was received in the past hour or 90 minutes and that discussions would take place in the coming hours.\nCIA director Bill Burns was in the region “working on this in real time”, Miller said.\nThe Hamas announcement came hours after Israel ordered the evacuation of parts of Rafah, the city on Gaza’s southern edge that has served as the last sanctuary for about half of Gaza’s 2.3-million residents.\nThat appeared to signal that an operation on Rafah will go ahead, despite Washington’s repeated warnings, including by US secretary of state Antony Blinken on a visit to Israel last week, where he also focused on increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza.\nMiller reiterated that the US could not support an operation in Rafah “as it is currently envisioned” by Israel.\n“A Rafah operation would make it incredibly difficult to sustain the increases in humanitarian assistance that we have been able to deliver over the past few weeks,” Miller said.\nWhite House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters late on Monday: “We want to get these hostages out, we want to get a ceasefire in place for six weeks, we want to increase humanitarian assistance.” Reaching an agreement would be the “absolute best outcome”.\nKirby said US President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for about 30 minutes about Rafah and the hostage and ceasefire proposal, before the Hamas response was received. He described it as a constructive discussion.\nHowever, Netanyahu’s office said late on Monday that his war cabinet approved continuing an operation in Rafah to pressure Hamas to release Israeli hostages and achieve the country’s other war goals.\n“In parallel, even though the Hamas proposal is far from Israel’s necessary demands, Israel will send a working delegation to the mediators to exhaust the possibility of reaching an agreement under conditions acceptable to Israel,\" Netanyahu’s office said.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he welcomed the decision by Hamas, adding that it was in line with Ankara’s suggestion, and he hoped Israel would do the same.\nUpdate: May 6 2024\nThis story has been updated with more information.\nReuters",

    "text": "111th graduating class strolls out in style in Ephrata\nEPHRATA — About 200 students strolled, cavorted, lightsaber-battled and marched their way onto the Ephrata High School football field last Friday evening. Some wore honor cords showing accomplishments, some had decorated mortar boards and others a look of relief that their day had finally come.\nStudent speaker, Charles Flynn, a graduating senior and outgoing Associated Student Body president, thanked the teachers, staff, parents and others who’d helped him and his classmates reach their educational and other goals.\n“I would also like to thank the class behind me,” Flynn said while at the podium, facing the gathered audience. “Many of us have grown up with each other since grade school, making mistakes and maturing from them along the way, staying up late to complete work, then waking up early to turn it in, going to football games and bonfires. All of these moments have given me the utmost confidence in the class sitting behind me. Today is not merely a heartfelt goodbye, but it is also a new beginning.”\nFlynn said he and many of his classmates are now facing the future in a new way for the first time. They’ll be able to take on the challenges they choose and pursue those choices. He encouraged his classmates to be brave as they move forward into the future, quoting a writer, director, philosopher and poet he admires.\n“As Suzy Kassem once said, ‘Fear kills more dreams than failure ever will.’ This quote can apply in two ways, fear of others and fear of yourself. The first is self-explanatory: fear of others’ judgment. Don’t let people’s opinions dictate what you do. After all, it’s your life, not theirs. The second one is a bit more complex. What do I mean by fear of yourself? I mean fear of being bad, fear of being vulnerable to yourself when trying something new. It’s okay to suck. Pushing through failure and overcoming it is the key to growing as a person in this time of finding ourselves and our passions. I believe that is integral to keep this moment in mind.”\nThe class also chose Erika Morford to speak for them. In introducing Morford, classmate Brydon Stacy said Morford was someone who shows up with a commitment to both the school and the community as a whole.\n“I’m honored to stand here tonight on behalf of the Class of 2025,” Morford began. It feels surreal to be in this moment, and I am delighted to share it with each and every one of you.”\nMorford reflected on the dreams the class had worked on achieving together, especially graduation, and she said she was proud of the class and grateful to the families and other supporters the class had during their time at EHS.\nMorford noted that her class is unique.\n“We are the final class to carry the memory of COVID-19 through our years of high school. We began this journey masked up, spread out and walking into classrooms that didn’t look or feel like what we expected,” she said. “The world felt uncertain. The rules kept changing, and we weren’t sure what high school was supposed to be like.”\nThat gave the students a unique strength, though, Morford said. They were adaptable and resilient and able to face things that require a little something extra.\n“We became students who weren’t afraid to do hard things. We became leaders who understood that flexibility and grit often matter more than having all the answers,” she said.\nStudent speaker Llandon Ahmann subsequently wished a fellow graduate, Payton Riggs, a happy birthday and reflected on how he appreciated his community and classmates.\nClosing out the speakers was Marla Alsopp, an English instructor, among other titles. Alsopp gave the students one last homework assignment, a series of several books focused on compassion, kindness and determination.\nEHS Principal Ashlie Miller closed out the ceremony by announcing each of the grads by name, instructing them to turn their tassels and watching each pass by. This was Miller’s first graduation as principal at EHS.",

    "text": "The Golden Gals Connecticut Golden Gals Connecticut, a respected family-run golden retriever breeding program, has been featured in a new spotlight article that explores their thoughtful, ethical approach to raising well-tempered dogs. Bethany, CT - Golden Gals Connecticut, a respected family-run golden retriever breeding program, has been featured in a new spotlight article that explores their thoughtful, ethical approach to raising well-tempered dogs. The article highlights co-founders Ashley and Steve Kubik’s dedication to early socialization, home-based care, and lifelong support for families adopting their puppies.\nThe piece, written in the style of a tech blogger’s semi-biographical deep dive, gives readers an inside look at how Golden Gals Connecticut sets itself apart from conventional breeders.\n“We’re not here to compete or outshine anyone,” said Ashley Kubik in the article. “We’re just trying to raise the kind of dogs we’d want in our own home. And that starts with love, patience, and doing things the right way.”\nA Spotlight on Responsible Breeding\nThe article sheds light on several key elements of the Kubiks' approach:\nHome-Based Rearing: Puppies are raised in a family environment—not kennels—surrounded by real-life sights and sounds to build confidence and adaptability.\nEarly Socialization: A structured routine of handling, exposure to new environments, and gentle stressors prepares puppies for life as family pets, service dogs, or emotional support animals.\nEthical Standards: With a strong focus on temperament, health-tested bloodlines, and responsible practices, the Kubiks emphasize quality over quantity.\nOngoing Support: Golden Gals Connecticut provides lifetime guidance to their puppy families, ensuring continued success and well-being long after adoption.\nThe feature also mentions the recent launch of the Golden Gals’ blog, which aims to educate new and aspiring pet owners on training, nutrition, socialization, and responsible care.\n“There’s so much misinformation out there,” Ashley noted in the article. “People think love is enough, but dogs need structure, early training, and consistent care. We want to give people the tools to do it right.”\nRecognition for a Mission-Driven Breeder\nThis feature article recognizes Golden Gals Connecticut as a standout example of how breeders can positively influence a dog’s life from the very beginning. With over 13 years of experience, the Kubiks continue to lead with compassion, integrity, and deep respect for the animals they raise.\nFor more information on Golden Gals Connecticut and to read the full spotlight article, please visit the website here .\nAbout Golden Gals Connecticut\nGolden Gals Connecticut is a small, family-based golden retriever breeding program in Bethany, CT.

    "text": "‘Someone actually cares’: Man gives firsthand account of living unhoused in blistering cold\nBy Grant Stephens\nClick here for updates on this story\nKANSAS CITY, Missouri (\nKSHB) — It’s still awfully cold, and that means the need to help people living outside or on the streets is still just as great.\nA group of KC-metro area volunteers hit the cold streets to help Monday night.\nSteven, a man who has spent the last few years homeless, said this cold spell has been the worst he’s felt in years.\n“Oh it’s terrible,” Steve said. “It hurts. You try to go to sleep and you wake up with your feet hurting and your hands hurting and your knees and everything’s so cold and nobody cares. The other night I was in the middle of 12th street just screaming, ‘Somebody help me! I’m freezing!’ I need a ride you know? And nobody stopped. Nobody stopped.”\nThere are hundreds of unhoused people like Steven in dozens of camps across KCMO.\n“Everybody has a story,” said Shelle West, the founder of Show Me You Care KC. “And everybody’s not homeless or houseless by choice. Sometimes, it’s the last option. Sometimes, this is all they have.”\nFor whatever reason, they’re outside in the cold, a place many believe is their only option.\n“You can’t even hardly imagine,” Nikki Klein, one of the volunteers said. “I’m constantly in my mind thinking, ‘How do people live like this? How do you literally live outside when it’s below zero.”\nKlein and other volunteers brought blankets, food, and hand warmers.\nThey do their best to convince people to get treatment for some of their cold-related injuries.\nFrostbite is common.\n“The pain in your feet mostly and your hands. Yeah, it’s bad,” Steven said.\nCoats, socks, fuel – physical things go a long way – but a warm heart takes it further.\n“We want to show them that we care,” West said. “And that there are people out here that truly care, that won’t ride past them.”\nIt makes all the difference to Steven.\n“It’s just the love that they show you more than anything, that someone actually cares,” Steven said.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.
