    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main)\nA new monument to the fallen takes shape in London\nLondon City Council will be asked to approve the creation of a new memorial for Canada’s fallen next week.\nThe Byron Legion Monument will be built in the heart of Springbank Park.\nFormer London Mayor Ed Holder is among those backing the project.\n“What better place than Springbank Park?” he told CTV News London during an interview at the proposed site.\nThe monument will be placed in a roundabout next to a prominent walking trail\nJoining Holder Thursday was Reverend Frank Mantz. Since 2007, he’s been trying to create a new location for Byron’s annual Remembrance Day service.\nAt present, it takes place in front of the Bryon Royal Canadian Legion Branch on Commissioners Road.\nMantz says moving to a new location in Springbank Park will offer improved safety and new ways to remember.\n“That is our hope, that people get more into Remembrance Day. The more they put into the day, the more they’re going to get out of it.”\nThe completed monument will feature military members and peacekeepers in a circular design.\nAn artist rendering of the proposed monument for Springbank Park.\n“So that when you walk around and see all these figures, it will actually look like they’re moving,” Mantz explained.\nHolder said placards with QR codes will be set up around the monument to enhance visitor understanding.\n“And to learn a story about the wars and the peacekeeping roles. We think that is important.”\nHolder, who lost an uncle to combat in World War II, said the project is personal for him.\nConstruction costs for the monument are anticipated to reach $400,000 with $150,000 already raised, the rest coming from the community.\nFundraising efforts include online donations and potentially, boxes inside local businesses.\n“So that people can drop a loonie or toonie in and help us remember,” explained Holder.\nAnd remembering is what it is all about for Mantz.\n“We need the whole community to be part of this and to feel part of this. Feel part of what the veterans have done and give thanks for their service.”\nThe monument is to be complete for Remembrance Day services in 2025.\nLondon Top Stories\nCTVNews.ca Top Stories\n'How can we make Nunavut better?'

    "text": "Joy Ogbeide es otra de tantas mujeres nigerianas que viajaron a Europa para ayudar a que su familia saliera de la precariedad. Estaba a punto de entrar en la universidad cuando su madre le pidió que viajara a España para ayudar a sus hermanos. Su padre había muerto y apenas tenían recursos. “Pensé que Europa iba a ser un lugar excepcional y resultó ser todo lo contrario. Las leyes no me permitían obtener un permiso de residencia y no conocía el idioma. Y no tenía tiempo para estudiar porque mi madre quería que trabajara”, asegura. Muchas personas le presionaron para que entrara en el negocio de la prostitución. Joy se negó rotundamente: “Me supliqué y me dije a mí misma ‘no lo hagas’, pero, cuando me mudé a Barcelona con un familiar, me echaron de casa por no acostarme con un amigo suyo a cambio de dinero. Me ofrecían la prostitución como única salida”, confiesa. El tiempo hizo que Joy se sintiera como el resto de las víctimas (de trata aunque no ejerciera la prostitución) pero llegó un momento en el que tuvo el arrojo suficiente para decidir escapar. Comenzó un negocio de trenzas y, de hecho, según cuenta, “muchas de mis clientas eran otras mujeres que estaban siendo prostituidas y me contaron la crudeza de sus historias”. En ese momento, comprendió que “nunca me dejaría prostituir”. Desde hace un tiempo es una de las agentes de cambio de Acción Contra la Trata: “Queremos reflejar la discriminación que sufrimos las mujeres y nuestra lucha. Damos voz y valentía a muchas de las víctimas que están padeciendo este proceso”, asevera. A pesar de la seguridad que Joy manifiesta, en ocasiones contar su experiencia se convierte en una tarea ardua a la que se debe enfrentar por sororidad hacia sus compañeras: “Cuando hablo se me remueve todo. Estoy abriendo una herida de un momento en el que el pánico protagonizaba mi vida. De vez en cuando vuelve, aunque pensaba que ya lo había superado”. Sin embargo, ella considera que contar su historia “merece la pena porque es una forma de sensibilización para que se entienda que la violencia hacia la mujer con fines de explotación sexual es algo tan real que nos afecta directamente a todas las mujeres. No solo porque nos puede pasar a cualquiera, que también, sino porque además el cómo tratan a otras mujeres es algo que nos afecta a todas las mujeres. Todas somos vistas como objeto de consumo”, expone. Además de ser agente de cambio. Joy es también mediadora de la asociación, trabajo que, por un lado, le ha facilitado el acceso a la comunicación con otras mujeres y, por otro lado, le ha ofrecido un espacio seguro donde poder dedicarse a una de sus pasiones: cantar: “Mi sueño es inspirar a todas las mujeres a través de mis canciones”. El Foro Navarro Contra la Trata atendió en 2022 el año pasado a 118 mujeres como víctimas de trata con fines de explotación sexual, según los indicadores de los diferentes colectivos e instituciones. Acción contra la Trata ha registrado solo este año 20 nuevas atenciones. “Tengo en mi mano la posibilidad de contar a todas estas mujeres mi vida, ahora, como superviviente. Todo el proceso de transformación que he hecho y todo el que me queda hasta sanar del todo. Estoy feliz por poder ser esa voz”, concluye. La voz de Joy Ogbeide clama de forma clara y fuerte para demostrar que después de la trata hay otra vida. Y una mano tendida.",

    "text": "WOODSTOCK, CT ( WFSB /Gray News) - Fourteen puppies were rescued from a rollover crash that closed a road in Woodstock, Connecticut Thursday morning. Several fire agencies responded to Senexet Road between Laurel and Bull Hill roads for a single-vehicle rollover accident involving wires down. Firefighters found a pole that had snapped, with wires down, and called Eversource CT to disable the power. Power was out in the area while the electricians worked. Officials say minor injuries were originally reported, but no one ended up being hurt. First responders also rescued and provided care for 14 puppies at the scene. the Muddy Brook Fire Department shared photos on Facebook of firefighters interacting with the puppies. The Necogg Humane Society and a doctor from Peake Brook Veterinary Center responded to the scene to provide veterinary care and shelter to the animals, firefighters said. Some puppies will be taken to a veterinary office for further care. Drivers were warned to expect a “long duration road closure.” Copyright 2024 WFSB via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Veronica Ferres in der Kritik: Jetzt reagiert die Schauspielerin\nIhre Botschaften zu Wertschätzung und Feminismus gingen nach hinten los – jetzt steht Veronica Ferres massiv in der Kritik. Ihre Reaktion spaltet die Meinungen.\nMünchen – Die Schauspielerin Veronica Ferres (60) sieht sich mit ungewöhnlichen Vorwürfen konfrontiert. Eine bekannte Autorin beschuldigt sie im Netz, Content-Klau begangen zu haben. Jetzt meldet sich die „Das Superweib“-Darstellerin zu Wort und zeigt Reue.\nAutorin Tara-Louise Wittwer erhebt schwere Vorwürfe gegen Veronica Ferres\nAm 12. Juli veröffentlichte Veronica Ferres ein Instagram-Video, das ein wichtiges gesellschaftliches Thema behandelt. Darin sprach sie über ungleiche Anforderungen an Männer und Frauen mit dem prägnanten Satz: „Ein guter Mann ist immer noch eine durchschnittliche Frau.“ Was als feministisches Statement gedacht war, wurde ihr jedoch schnell zum Verhängnis. Tara-Louise Wittwer (34), bekannt als „Spiegel“-Kolumnistin und spezialisiert auf feministische Themen, erkannte in Ferres‘ Video Ähnlichkeiten zu ihrem eigenen Content.\nBereits Ende Juni hatte Wittwer ein nahezu identisches Video veröffentlicht. Ihre Reaktion ließ nicht lange auf sich warten: „Äh? Könntest du bitte nicht mein Video klauen?“, kommentierte sie direkt unter Ferres‘ Post. „Das macht man einfach nicht, dass man performativ Videos klaut“, so die Kolumnistin in einem weiteren Beitrag auf ihrem Profil. Die Kritik blieb nicht unbemerkt. „Das Video wäre cool, wenn Tara-Louise tatsächlich auch ihre Credits bekommt“, schrieb auch eine Nutzerin stellvertretend für viele enttäuschte Follower.\nVeronica Ferres räumt Fehler ein\nKurz darauf reagierte Veronica Ferres schließlich auf die Vorwürfe. In ihrer Instagram-Story verwies sie plötzlich auf Tara-Louise Wittwer: „Auch gesehen bei der großartigen Tara-Louise.” Wenige Stunden später folgte eine weitere ausführliche Entschuldigung der Schauspielerin. „Hier ist ein Fehler passiert, für den ich die Verantwortung trage. Deinen Ärger, liebe Tara-Louise Wittwer, verstehe ich und du hast recht, das zu benennen“, erklärte die 60-Jährige in einem Statement. Sie gab zu, lediglich das ursprüngliche TikTok-Video der Influencerin Jessie Song als Quelle genannt und dabei Wittwers „klare Worte“ übernommen zu haben.\nKonsequenterweise löschte Veronica Ferres ihr umstrittenes Video. „Den Credit an dich habe ich nun nachgeholt, aber natürlich viel zu spät. Deswegen habe ich entschieden, das Video zu löschen“, betonte sie. Abschließend würdigte sie die Arbeit der Autorin: „Liebe Tara, bitte entschuldige! Dein Content ist stark, wichtig und inspiriert Frauen, laut zu werden. Bitte mach weiter so.“\nApropos: Veronica Ferres spricht über mögliche Filmprojekte mit ihrer Tochter.

    "text": "Stock Analysis | Crown Castle Outlook - A Challenging Path Ahead\n- Crown Castle (CCI) falls 3.11% with bearish technical indicators and weak chart trends.\n- Mixed analyst ratings (3.82 avg) and divergent institutional/retail flows highlight market uncertainty.\n- Bearish signals include WR Oversold, Bearish Engulfing, and negative institutional money flows.\n- REIT sector lawsuits and S-REIT cash-backed yield shifts could impact CCI's fundamentals and investor sentiment.\nMarket Snapshot\nCrown Castle (CCI) is currently in a downward price trend (-3.11%), with technical indicators strongly bearish. Investors should approach with caution as the chart signals a weak trend and the overall market sentiment is mixed with a simple average rating of 3.82 and a performance-weighted rating of 2.52.\nNews Highlights\nRecent news includes a lawsuit against Broadmark Realty Capital for misleading merger proxy materials, which highlights potential risks for investors in real estate investment trusts (REITs). Additionally, S-REITs are transitioning to more cash-backed yields, aiming for 5.5% in FY 2025. This shift might affect REIT investments, including those in Crown Castle, as managers focus on sustainable distribution models.\nAnalyst Views & Fundamentals\nThe average rating score from analysts stands at 3.82, while the weighted rating score is 2.52. Analyst views are dispersed, with a mix of \"Neutral,\" \"Strong Buy,\" and \"Buy\" ratings. These scores are largely aligned with the current price trend, which is negative.\n- PE ratio is 119.65 with an internal diagnostic score of 3.00 (on a 0-10 scale).\n- GMAR is 0.74 with a score of 3.00.\n- Shareholders’ equity attributable to parent company / Total liabilities is -4.19% with a score of 1.00.\n- Gross profit margin is 74.26% with a score of 1.00.\nMoney-Flow Trends\nBig-money flows are predominantly negative, with large and extra-large institutional flows showing negative trends. However, retail and small investor flows are positive, with the small inflow ratio at 51.50% and the medium inflow ratio at 50.43%. This suggests a divide in market sentiment between institutional and retail investors.\nKey Technical Signals\nThe technical analysis for Crown Castle is weak, with an internal diagnostic score of 1.31 and 3 bearish indicators outweighing 0 bullish ones. Key signals include:\n- WR Oversold with a score of 1.92 and a win rate of 44.07%.\n- Dividend Announcement Date with a score of 1.00 and a win rate of 25.0%.\n- Bearish Engulfing with a score of 1.00 and a win rate of 0.0%.\nRecent chart patterns from August 5-12 highlight repeated WR Oversold signals and one Bearish Engulfing pattern, indicating negative momentum. The overall trend is clearly bearish, suggesting an avoidance strategy for short-term traders.\nConclusion\nWith a weak technical outlook, mixed analyst ratings, and divergent money flows, the actionable takeaway is to consider waiting for a potential pull-back before entering a position in Crown Castle. Investors should monitor the impact of recent lawsuits in the REIT sector and track the transition of S-REITs to cash-backed yields, which could affect the company's fundamentals and investor sentiment.\nComments\nNo comments yet",
