    "text": "A solar-powered water pumping machine to pump about 800 litres of water for the Amrahia Community School in the La Nkwantanang Madina Municipality of the Greater Accra Region was inaugurated on Tuesday.\nThis followed the breakdown of the water system of the school which has a student population of over 300.\nThe facility, funded by the 2024 Cohorts of the Global Executive Master Business Administration (GEMBE) School, was constructed in four months by Advance Solar Solutions Company to help address the acute water problem facing the School.\nFitted with Chlorine reservoirs, the facility comes with an Osmosis treatment plant, an Anesta pumping marching of 900 watts and overhead tanks that can serve the entire school.\nThe President of the 2024 Cohorts, Zak Boughalem, who are products of the China Europe International Business School (CHIBS), in handing over the facility said it was the desire of the group to leave a lasting legacy for the community.\nHe said the gesture was in reciprocal of what the CHIBS had given them, stating that, “We are grateful for the hospitality from Ghanaians and ever ready to provide more when duty calls,” adding “the African brotherly love must be extended to every country.”\nProfessor Gordon Adomdza, Director CEIBS Africa, said access to clean water formed part of Sustainable development goals and commended the Cohorts for the initiative and charged the School to take good care of it.\nThe Director of the School, Mustapha Forson, commended the Cohorts for the gesture, and urged other philanthropists to emulate their example\n FROM LAWRENCE VOMAFA-AKPALU, AMRAHIA",

    "title": "Solar Rooftop: Australia's push to put more solar panels on rental homes, ET EnergyWorld",
    "text": "ADELAIDE: As a university student in Canberra, Eilis Fitt and her two housemates set rules to keep their electricity bill down - no heater in the living room unless everyone was home, and no turning on the washing machine or dishwasher during peak hours. So she was delighted - and surprised - when their landlord installed solar panels about a year after she moved in. After some initial hiccups, the effect was startling: their electricity bills \\\"went down significantly,\\\" she said. \\\"It made us feel so much more comfortable about turning on the heater when it got cold,\\\" said Fitt, 25. \\\"We got lucky - it's very rare for renters to have solar. Landlords generally don't care about how much tenants have to fork out for their electricity use,\\\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Australia has the highest solar capacity installed per capita in the world, with photovoltaic panels in about one-third of households, or 3.6 million homes. That helps many cope with some of the highest electricity prices in the Asia Pacific. But the benefits have largely eluded renters and those living in social housing, with analysts estimating that only 4% of rental homes have solar power. \\\"There are no incentives for renters to pay for solar systems themselves, since they have limited security of tenure, let alone rights to do much to the property itself,\\\" said Dylan McConnell, a renewable energy researcher at the University of New South Wales. \\\"Similarly, landlords have limited incentive to install solar, since only the renter has the relationship with the energy retailer and can therefore benefit,\\\" said McConnell. But there is a growing realisation that installing solar on social housing and rentals - which make up more than 30% of properties - is essential to meeting clean energy targets, McConnell said. So there are efforts to encourage landlords to make that investment, he said, with incentives such as grants, rebates and low-interest loans. ENERGY HARDSHIP Australia, with a population of some 25 million, is seeing more frequent extreme weather events such as forest fires, floods, and especially heat waves which are forecast to increase in frequency, intensity and duration due to climate change. Generous subsidies, alongside \\\"dramatically escalating\\\" electricity prices, kickstarted the household PV boom from around 2010, according to McConnell, helping more than double Australia's renewable electricity generation in the last decade. However, renters and those living in social housing are experiencing \\\"energy hardship\\\", the energy regulator said in a November report that recommended rebates and other assistance. A more desirable solution is solar, but it can be hard for renters and those living in low socio-economic areas to get finance, said Jenny Paradiso, co-founder and managing director of solar firm Suntrix. \\\"The people who want solar have already got it by now. So we have to go after the renters, the low-income households, those who live far from the grid, and make it easier for them,\\\" she said in her office as Adelaide experienced its warmest day of the summer, with a high of more than 41 degrees Celsius (105.8F). Suntrix was among the first solar firms to install SolShare, a technology that allows apartments to share solar energy from a single rooftop system that is connected to the units via the building's main switchboard, and delivers energy equitably. \\\"Tech plays a big part - it's not just about the panels,\\\" said Paradiso. \\\"Technologies like SolShare make solar more accessible to everyone.\\\" The SolShare, developed by Australian startup Allume, has been embraced by apartment blocks and affordable housing providers such as Housing Choices Australia, a non-profit that owns and manages about 7,400 properties across the country. Housing Choices has installed solar panels in more than a dozen properties each in South Australia and Western Australia, and in some 500 properties in Victoria, including three apartment blocks with SolShare, said spokesperson Emma Duncan. \\\"Whilst a majority of the solar installations are initiated by Housing Choices, there has been a demand from residents for solar, especially in the past two years, with the rising cost of electricity bills,\\\" she said. MOST COST-EFFECTIVE Australia plans to increase the share of clean energy to as much as 82% of overall electricity supply by 2030 from about a third. Solar currently accounts for the biggest share of clean energy production, at nearly 14%. Solar is the \\\"most cost-effective means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to household electricity use\\\" because producing electricity at the point of consumption reduces transmission and distribution energy losses, according to the energy regulator. But with fewer subsidies and the declining value of energy exported back into the grid during daylight hours, there is less incentive for landlords to install solar, said McConnell. A survey last year by advocacy group Better Renting showed that about one-in-three renters were keen to get solar because of non-financial reasons, such as contributing to a cleaner, more sustainable future. Yet most renters surveyed also worried that landlords would use solar to justify rent increases. At a social housing complex in Adelaide, where Suntrix is installing solar panels and SolShare as part of a government-funded renovation, residents in the 96 units are mostly concerned about lowering their electricity bills, said Paradiso. \\\"There is greater awareness of the benefits of solar - though it's mostly the economic benefits they're looking at,\\\" she said. \\\"But more and more, they are also worried about their carbon footprint.\\\"",

    "text": "Amazon is partnering with a hydrogen company to produce hydrogen fuel.Plug Power Inc. has completed the installation and commissioning of an electrolyzer system at an Amazon fulfillment center in Aurora, Col. The one-megawatt (MW) proton exchange membrane electrolyzer — the first installed and in use at an Amazon site — is producing low-carbon hydrogen to fuel more than 225 hydrogen fuel cell-powered forklift trucks at the site.The Plug 1MW electrolyzer, which uses electricity and water to produce hydrogen, is able to support up to 400 hydrogen fuel cell-powered forklift trucks. The hydrogen produced by the electrolyzer will be compressed on site and stored in a gaseous hydrogen storage tank for use by the forklift trucks.To date, Plug has collaborated with Amazon to deploy more than 17,000 fuel cells to replace batteries in forklifts in more than 80 fulfillment centers in North America. For most of these locations, the hydrogen to power the forklifts is produced elsewhere, liquified, and then delivered by trucks to an on-site storage and dispensing system.“Hydrogen is an important tool in our efforts to decarbonize our operations by 2040 in support of The Climate Pledge, and we’re excited about our ability to produce hydrogen at Amazon facilities through this partnership with Plug,” said Asad Jafry, the director of global hydrogen economy at Amazon. “On-site production will make the use of hydrogen even more energy efficient for certain locations and types of facilities.”For the project, Plug provided design, installation, commissioning, and maintenance services for the 1MW PEM electrolyzer and hydrogen storage—compatible with the existing refueling infrastructure and fuel cells already in use at the site.“In Amazon, we have a true partner that recognizes the essential role hydrogen plays in our collective energy future,” said Plug CEO Andy Marsh.",

    "text": "An artificial-intelligence tool honoured by one of this year’s Nobel prizes has revealed intimate details of the molecular meet-cute between sperm and eggs . The AlphaFold program, which predicts protein structures , identified a trio of proteins that team up to work as matchmakers between the gametes. Without them, sexual reproduction might hit a dead end in a wide range of animals, from fish to mammals. The finding, published on 17 October in Cell[1](#ref-CR1), contradicts a previous notion that just two proteins — one on the egg and one on the sperm — are sufficient to ensure fertilization, says Enrica Bianchi, a reproductive biologist at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, who was not involved in the study. “It’s not the old concept of having a key and a lock to open the door any more,” she says. “It’s more complicated.” A mysterious union Despite its crucial role in reproduction, the process by which the fusion of egg and sperm occurs in vertebrates is a molecular mystery that has proved difficult to crack. The union of the two cells involves proteins that reside in greasy membranes, making them hard to study using standard biochemical methods. The interactions between these proteins are often weak and fleeting, and it is difficult to harvest enough viable eggs and sperm from some of researchers’ favoured laboratory animals, including mice, for extensive experiments. As a result, early studies of reproductive biology often focused on marine invertebrates that release copious quantities of eggs and sperm into water. “If you take a textbook off the shelf and look up fertilization, you’ll read all about sea urchins ,” says Gavin Wright, a biochemist at the University of York, UK, who was not involved in the study. “It’s a tricky thing to research.” To overcome the supply problem, Andrea Pauli, a molecular biologist at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna, and her colleagues began their work in zebrafish , a vertebrate that also releases its eggs and sperm into the water. To bypass the difficulties of working with membrane proteins in the laboratory, the team used AlphaFold to predict interactions between proteins. Two of AlphaFold’s developers were awarded a share of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry on 9 October. Not two but three AlphaFold predicted that three sperm proteins come together to form a complex. Two of these proteins were already known to be important for fertility. Working in the laboratory, Pauli and her colleagues confirmed that the third is also crucial for fertility in both zebrafish and mice, and that the three proteins interact with one another in zebrafish and human sperm. The team also found that, in zebrafish, the trio creates a binding site for an egg protein called Bouncer, providing a mechanism by which the two cells can recognize one another. “It’s a way to say, ‘Sperm, you found an egg’ and ‘Egg, you found a sperm’,” says Andreas Blaha, a biochemist at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology and a co-author of the paper. The findings might one day yield a way to screen people struggling with infertility, to find out whether problems with this complex could be the cause, says Wright. And the results highlight a role for AlphaFold in studying fertilization, he adds. “We’re limited in terms of experiments,” he says. “It might be that these modelling studies have an important role to play in the future.”",
