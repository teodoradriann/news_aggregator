    "text": "Sep. 4—Brandon Lyons, a handcyclist from Mechanicsburg, made his Paralympic debut Wednesday, finishing 10th in the men's H3 individual time trials in the Paris suburbs. Lyons covered the two laps of the 14.1-kilometer course in 49 minutes, 34.02 seconds, a little more than six minutes off the pace set by France's Mathieu Bosredon, who won gold at 43:33.22. France's Johan Quaile took second place (45:33.41) while Martino Pini of Italy claimed bronze (46:13.69). Lyons, who graduated from Cumberland Valley High School and Penn State University, suffered a spinal injury in May 2014 and took up handcycling to remain active after his injury. In 2017, he participated in a full-time residency program at the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and developed sepsis just before the Team USA qualifying event for the Tokyo Games in 2021. Lyons' maiden voyage through the Paralympics is set to continue with the men's H3 road race scheduled for Thursday morning. Tim Gross is the sports editor at The Sentinel and cumberlink.com .

    "title": "Biden Admin Temporarily Suspends UNRWA Funding Over Allegations of Staffers Involved in Oct. 7 Massacre",
    "text": "The Biden administration is temporarily suspending funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) after the U.N. agency announced that they were terminating multiple staffers over their alleged involvement in the Oct. 7 massacre.\nJewish Insider reported that State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement, “The United States is extremely troubled by the allegations that twelve UNRWA employees may have been involved in the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel. The Department of State has temporarily paused additional funding for UNRWA while we review these allegations and the steps the United Nations is taking to address them.”\nUNRWA itself issued a press release on Friday stating that they are investigating the allegations and that “any UNRWA employee who was involved in acts of terror will be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution. UNRWA reiterates its condemnation in the strongest possible terms of the abhorrent attacks of 7 Oct. and calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all Israeli hostages and their safe return to their families.”\nThe U.S. is one of 19 countries (and the European Union) that have suspended funding to UNRWA over the allegations, including the United Kingdom, European Union and Australia. Eylon Levy, spokesperson for the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, argued in a Tuesday press briefing that UNRWA needs to be scrapped altogether, claiming that Israeli intelligence has found that “about 10% [of UNRWA employees] are Hamas or Islamic Jihad operatives, and another 50% are first-degree relatives of a Hamas operative.”\nHowever, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby contended to reporters on Monday, “Let’s not impugn the good work of a whole agency because of the potential bad actions here by a small number.” He pointed out that UNRWA has 13,000 employees in Gaza that only 13 so far were allegedly involved in Oct. 7.\nUN Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer posted on X to U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, “Today you said you were ‘horrified’ at the news UNRWA staff were implicated in Hamas terrorism. But every time we sounded the alarm about UNRWA employees and terrorism, your office disparaged us. You can’t say you didn’t know. You knew.” He also posted on X that UN Watch obtained a copy of a Telegram chat consisting of 3,000 UNRWA staffers that is “replete with celebrations of Hamas terrorism.” “There is not one case where an UNRWA teacher objected,” he added.\nMr. Secretary General @antonioguterres : Today you said you were “horrified” at the news UNRWA staff were implicated in Hamas terrorism. But every time we sounded the alarm about UNRWA employees and terrorism, your office disparaged us. You can't say you didn't know. You knew. 🧵 https://t.co/KecOpm8MLp\n— Hillel Neuer (@HillelNeuer) January 26, 2024\nJust a few bad apples?\nHere is our saved copy of the UNRWA Telegram group of 3,000 UNRWA teachers: https://t.co/1FgUu9Lxvo\nThere are 249,000 messages, replete with celebrations of Hamas terrorism: https://t.co/1avingQHvp\nThere is not one case where an UNRWA teacher objected.\n— Hillel Neuer (@HillelNeuer) January 28, 2024\nFoundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) Senior Advisor Richard Goldberg declared in congressional testimony on Tuesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee that “UNRWA has a terrorism problem, and the U.S. taxpayer has been underwriting it for decades.” “We’ve seen the reports of Hamas terror tunnels discovered next to or under UNRWA schools,” said Goldberg. “And not just since Oct. 7. I’m including here footnotes for stories about these tunnels in 2017, 2021 and 2022. We’ve seen the social media accounts of UNRWA employees supporting terrorism and antisemitism… And we’ve even .seen the report of a released hostage who was held in the attic of an UNRWA teacher’s home. These aren’t new phenomena. We’ve seen UNRWA schools used as rocket-launching platforms — and rockets even stored inside UNRWA schools. We’ve seen an UNRWA school headmaster moonlighting as an Islamic Jihad terrorist.”\nFurther, Goldberg pointed out that there’s a “hotbed of terrorism that grows inside UNRWA’s communities — not just in Gaza but in the West Bank and Lebanon. Look at the Jenin Refugee Camp in the West Bank where Israel continues to operate to defend Israelis against Hamas and other terror cells. Look at Lebanon’s Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp, where terrorist groups continue to battle each other — with no Israeli presence or military activity whatsoever. At least 28 people dead in two rounds of fighting with so many families, including children, displaced … an underreported story. Do we see the pattern here?”\nHe argued that UNRWA’s “terror problem” is structural, as the U.N. “does not recognize Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, or the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) as terrorist groups.”\nUNRWA told CNN on Monday regarding claims from Israel that UNRWA facilities were used for terror, “We don’t have more information on this at this stage. The Office of Internal Oversight Services (the internal oversight body of the U.N.) will look into all these allegations as part of the investigation the Commissioner General of UNRWA has requested them to undertake.”\nJewish groups praised the Biden administration’s decision to pause UNRWA funding.\n“Time and again, we’ve seen how this UN agency is often more involved with Hamas terrorists than with supporting the Palestinian people,” the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) posted to X.\nWe welcome the US's decision to suspend funding to #UNRWA after learning of 12 employees involved in the Oct 7 massacre. Time and again, we've seen how this UN agency is often more involved with Hamas terrorists than with supporting the Palestinian people. https://t.co/HbEqAokr5I\n— ADL (@ADL) January 26, 2024\nThe American Jewish Committee also posted to X, “AJC is livid to learn of the allegations that twelve UNRWA employees may have been involved in the Oct. 7 massacre. We welcome the announcement by the @StateDept that it has paused all additional funding for UNRWA and will launch a full investigation into the allegations. There must be accountability.”\nAJC is livid to learn of the allegations that twelve UNRWA employees may have been involved in the October 7 massacre.\nWe welcome the announcement by the @StateDept that it has paused all additional funding for UNRWA and will launch a full investigation into the allegations.… pic.twitter.com/M9Qo4XBvZS\n— American Jewish Committee (@AJCGlobal) January 26, 2024\nSimon Wiesenthal Center Associate Dean and Director of Global Social Action Agenda Rabbi Abraham Cooper also said in a statement, ““As I told U.S. Secretary of State Blinken recently—UNRWA cannot be relied upon to be part of the solution in Gaza the day after this war ends, it is a core problem of what’s wrong with Gaza. UNRWA should be scrapped and replaced with a new Palestinian entity that would be established and funded based on a commitment to peace and with full vetting of possible terrorist affiliation of any staff and teachers, an actual peace curriculum taught in Palestinian schools, and with total financial transparency monitored directly by donor nations.”\nDemocratic Majority for Israel President and CEO Mark Mellman said in a statement, “UN employees are required to be neutral in politics and to avoid criminal activity. UNRWA and its employees have long violated those principles. That UNRWA employees actively participated in savage terrorism is a deplorable and permanent stain on the U.N. and on UNRWA. Providing humanitarian aid to Palestinians is a vital objective, but it must be done in a way that doesn’t support terrorism.\n“ We welcome the announcement by the @StateDept that it has paused all additional funding for UNRWA and will launch a full investigation into the allegations. There must be accountability.” – American Jewish Committee\n“DMFI has regularly called for reforming UNRWA, which in addition to providing humanitarian aid has long incited hatred and violence,” continued Mellman. “Through its statements and actions, UNRWA has become a serious obstacle to peace. We now find that its employees also participate in mass murder, torture, and kidnapping. Donors must insist on a complete overhaul and reform of UNRWA. We urge the Administration to make the current pause the beginning of that root-and-branch remaking of this agency which is badly off track.”\nLawfare Project Founder and Executive Director Brooke Goldstein said in a statement, “We have long been warning about the complicity of UNRWA in terrorist activity, starting with the schools they run, which are used by Hamas to indoctrinate and recruit children, to the active involvement of their staff in violent and murderous terrorist activities. The Trump administration had, appropriately, ceased funding to this entity, but the Biden administration restored it, despite well-known concerns about its activities. Now, we are pleased to see that many governments are waking up once again to the fact that their financial aid is being used to fund terrorism, not to help people.”\nShe continued: “By granting Palestinians hereditary refugee status and making them dependent upon the United Nations, the Western world has effectively colonized them, depriving them of the opportunity — and ability — to integrate into the societies in which they live, or to develop the infrastructure and economy of areas that they control. And with terror organizations like Hamas running Gaza, there is no chance that the civilian population will ever be able to benefit from the tremendous economic partnerships available with Israel, the Middle East, and the rest of the world. UNRWA is a highly flawed organization that is incapable of being reformed; it needs to be dismantled and Hamas eliminated in order for the people of Gaza to be able to not just live freely, but to develop a healthy, free economy and evolve into a true partner on the global stage.”\nCombat Antisemitism Movement Chief of Staff Arthur Maserjian said in a statement regarding Tuesday’s congressional hearing, “Today’s hearing only confirmed what we have known for a long time, that UNRWA will never be a partner who can be trusted to live up to its purpose of serving the welfare of the Palestinian people. It is now abundantly clear to all that funding UNWRA means funding terrorism, and this runs counter to America’s national principles and interests. This is why we have seen bipartisan outcry in the wake of evidence showing 12 UNRWA employees were directly involved in the barbaric Hamas attacks on October 7th, as well as the revelation that 1,200 UNRWA employees, 10% of its total workforce, are linked to terrorism. The United States and its allies must cut funding for UNRWA completely and permanently and find alternative mechanisms to meet the humanitarian needs of Palestinian civilians without undermining the security of Israelis.”",

    "title": "Our carbon potential: Challenges and solutions | Kuensel Online",
    "text": "Bhutan is known for pristine forests, clean rivers, and our carbon-negative status, and so, our carbon potential could unlock significant opportunities. Yet, challenges abound. The complexities of international carbon markets, governance limitations, and our unique development context all pose significant hurdles. To turn potential into profit, we must navigate these challenges strategically while maintaining its deep-rooted commitment to sustainability.\nOur most immediate obstacle perhaps is access to international carbon markets. International carbon markets are governed by intricate regulations, requiring countries to meet strict compliance standards. For us, with limited experience in carbon trading, navigating these regulations demands expertise and robust infrastructure. Establishing monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems will be crucial. These systems can allow us to quantify its carbon emissions reductions or sequestrations and certify carbon credits for sale. However, MRV systems are both costly and complex, requiring not only financial investment but also skilled human resources.\nInstitutional capacity so is another challenge facing us . Effective governance frameworks and policies must be established to ensure transparency, accountability, and equity in carbon trading. We must build our capacity to manage carbon projects to ensure that government agencies, private sector players, and communities are all aligned. In the end, clear and efficient governance structures will be key to preventing inefficiencies, corruption, or unequal distribution of benefits from carbon trading.\nThe volatility of global carbon prices also poses a significant challenge. Carbon markets are subject to global economic conditions and shifts in international climate policies. For Bhutan, this unpredictability could mean unstable revenues from carbon credit sales. We must, therefore, diversify our carbon-related revenue streams, such as exploring nature-based solutions like afforestation, soil carbon sequestration, or even carbon capture technologies.\nOur geographic and demographic constraints limit the scale of carbon projects. With 70 percent of our land under forest cover, we have limited scope for further afforestation projects. Expanding carbon projects without undermining the country’s existing environmental protections will require innovation. That would mean focussing on sustainable land management practices, community-based reforestation projects, and harnessing indigenous knowledge for ecosystem preservation.\nOne of the most significant challenges perhaps is the high cost of verification and monitoring. Ensuring that carbon emissions reductions are legitimate requires robust MRV systems. Bhutan will need to invest heavily in advanced technologies like satellite monitoring, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain for transparent and efficient verification.\nWhile the challenges are many, solutions exist, and we must act swiftly to capitalise on our carbon potential. One practical solution is forging strategic partnerships. We can collaborate with international agencies, NGOs, and private companies with expertise in carbon trading, MRV systems, and climate financing for technical assistance, capacity-building, and financial support.\nAnother critical solution may lie in fostering community engagement. Carbon projects, particularly those related to forest conservation, must involve local communities to ensure long-term sustainability.\nWhat is critically necessary is developing a national carbon market strategy that includes clear guidelines on how carbon credits will be generated, verified, and sold. It should also outline how revenues will be invested back into the country.",

Le parquet avait annoncé sa mise en examen. « Un individu planifiant une action violente lors du passage du relais de la flamme olympique à Bordeaux a été interpellé », avait précédemment affirmé le ministre de l’Intérieur sur X.\n« En garde à vue, l’intéressé a admis avoir envisagé un passage à l’acte, sans lieu déterminé, suite à une agression subie. Aucune référence à la flamme olympique n’a été évoquée », a cependant souligné la procureure de la République à Bordeaux, Frédérique Porterie, dans une communication à la presse.\nSelon Beauvau, 77 « Micas » sont en cours, un chiffre qui a fortement augmenté depuis le début du relais de la flamme. Le ministère assure par ailleurs que les mesures d’entraves « continueront d’être renforcées à l’approche des Jeux ».",

    "text": "Biden anunció 225 millones para Ucrania en reunión con Zelenski durante cumbre de la OTAN Tras el anuncio, el mandatario ucraniano, Volodímir Zelenski, expresó su gratitud a Biden por la ayuda, calificándola como “una noticia muy fuerte”. El presidente de Estados Unidos, [Joe Biden,](https://www.wradio.com.co/tag/joseph_biden/a/) anunció este jueves 11 de julio un nuevo paquete de asistencia militar de 225 millones de dólares para [Ucrania](https://www.wradio.com.co/tag/ucrania/a/) durante un encuentro con su homólogo ucraniano, [Volodímir Zelenski](https://www.wradio.com.co/tag/volodymyr_oleksandrovych_zelenskiy/a/), en el marco de la cumbre de la OTAN en Washington. Lea también: “Hoy me enorgullece anunciar un nuevo conjunto de sistemas de seguridad para Ucrania”, declaró Biden junto a Zelenski ante los medios de comunicación antes de la reunión. Según explicó el mandatario estadounidense, este es el octavo paquete que ha autorizado desde que el Congreso aprobara en abril una ayuda de 61.000 millones de dólares, la cual llegó tras meses de debate por el bloqueo de los republicanos, lo que provocó una escasez de armamento en Ucrania. Tras el anuncio, Zelenski expresó su gratitud a Biden por la ayuda, calificándola como “una noticia muy fuerte”. “Estoy agradecido a usted, su equipo, su administración, por supuesto, al Congreso, ambos partidos, ambas cámaras y a todos los estadounidenses por su apoyo vital y firme a Ucrania y al pueblo ucraniano. Juntos, estamos salvando vidas”, afirmó Zelenski, ataviado con su característica indumentaria verde oliva militar. El presidente ucraniano aprovechó para mencionar ante las cámaras el ataque del lunes perpetrado por Rusia contra el principal hospital infantil de [Kiev](https://www.wradio.com.co/tag/kiev/a/) y otras ciudades ucranianas, que causó al menos 41 víctimas civiles en la ofensiva aérea más letal de los últimos meses. En relación con este ataque, agradeció el envío por parte de Estados Unidos, Alemania, Países Bajos, Rumanía e Italia de sistemas de defensa aérea, incluyendo cuatro Patriot, en los próximos meses, cumpliendo así una de las principales peticiones de Zelenski. Además de los sistemas antiaéreos, la transferencia prevista de cazas F-16 para Ucrania está en marcha y concluirá este verano, anunció ayer el secretario de Estado estadounidense, [Antony Blinken](https://www.wradio.com.co/tag/antony_blinken/a/). En esta cumbre de la [ OTAN](https://www.wradio.com.co/2024/07/11/las-conclusiones-que-deja-la-cumbre-de-la-otan-en-washington/) en Washington, que conmemora el 75 aniversario de la alianza, los líderes han mostrado su unidad en la defensa de Ucrania a largo plazo. Ayer, en la primera jornada, ya se comprometieron a enviar al menos otros 40.000 millones de euros (unos 36.922 millones de dólares) de apoyo militar a Kiev el próximo año y declararon “irreversible” su integración en la organización, aunque evitaron fijar una fecha concreta y aseguraron que ocurrirá cuando se den las condiciones adecuadas.",
