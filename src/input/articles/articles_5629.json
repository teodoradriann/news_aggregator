    "text": "Canada joins drone coalition for Ukraine Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair has pledged Ottawa's participation in the work of the defense contact group of the coalition to strengthen Ukraine's capabilities in the field of drones, led by Latvia and the United Kingdom, according to the Canadian government. As a member of this coalition, Canada will continue to explore ways to expand Ukraine's capabilities in the field of drones. To date, Canada has made a significant contribution to strengthening Ukraine's UAV potential by providing over 100 specialized cameras for UAVs manufactured in Canada by L3 Wescam. In addition to these donations, Blair announced last month the transfer of over 800 UAVs from Teledyne FLIR, based in Waterloo, Ontario. Canada's assistance to Ukraine Canada has provided military and financial assistance to Ukraine since the onset of full-scale aggression. On January 23, the Canadian Defense Minister announced a new aid package to Ukraine, including 10 multi-role boats from Zodiac Hurricane Technologies. Canada also announced the start of training for Ukrainians on F-16 fighter jets. Furthermore, on February 3, it was revealed that [Canada is considering transferring CRV7 \"air-to-ground\" missiles to Ukraine](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/canada-considers-transferring-crv7-missiles-1706944624.html), which the Canadian government had planned to dispose of. Additionally, the Canadian Ministry of Defense has said that Ottawa is participating in two coalitions subordinate to the Defense Contact Group for Ukraine, namely, the armored coalition and the coalition of air forces.",

    "text": "2025 has got off to a chilly start, with temperatures plunging during the first week of January.\nIn response to the freezing temperatures, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued an amber cold-health alert (CHA) for all areas of England, indicating that the health service is expected to be under increased pressure due to adverse weather conditions. In addition to the cold-health alerts, weather warnings for snow and ice are in place for large areas of the UK.\nCommenting on the alert, Dr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at UKHSA, said: “The forecasted temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, including those aged 65 and over and those with pre-existing health conditions, and it is therefore vital to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.\n“These people could be more at risk of heart attacks, stroke and chest infections as a result of cold temperatures.”\nDan Holley, Deputy Chief Forecaster for the Met Office said: “We’ve currently issued a Yellow warning for snow and ice covering a large part of England and all of Wales to cater for possible disruption over the weekend. A separate yellow warning for snow has been issued for most of Scotland.”\nThe amber cold-health alert is currently in place up until midday on Wednesday 8th of January 2025.",

    "text": "Parfois aidés de bénévoles pour craquer leurs coquilles, les bébés tortues attaquent la vie avec un premier défi: atteindre l'eau baignée par la lune sur une plage turque de la Méditerranée.\nLa marche s'annonce incertaine et seul un petit sur mille survivra jusqu'à l'âge adulte puis retournera sur le sable qui l'a vu naître pour y pondre, 25 ans plus tard.\nLe nombre de nids a doublé cette année sur les côtes turques pour atteindre 700 dans la seule localité de Manavgat (sud), à l'est d'Antalya: une preuve que malgré les menaces, les mesures de protection portent leurs fruits.\nUn groupe de bénévoles veille sur cette portion de littoral, un site touristique de 10 km niché au pied des montagnes, prisé pour son sable doré et ses eaux claires, qui est aussi une zone de reproduction des Caretta caretta, communément appelées tortues Caouanne.\nCes reptiles marins sont inscrits sur la liste rouge des espèces menacées de l'Union internationale pour la conservation de la nature (UICN).\n\"Notre estimation moyenne pour cette année est d'environ 60.000 œufs dont 30.000 vont libérer des bébés reptiles. Seuls 30 d'entre eux reviendront ici dans des années\", explique à l'AFP Seher Akyol, présidente-fondatrice du centre de conservation marine Dekafok.\n- Lumière rouge et panneaux -\nLa côte sud de la Turquie abrite 21 zones de nidification officielles, où la plupart des plages sont interdites de 20H00 à 08H00 pour laisser le champ libre aux tortues, mais Manavgat n'en fait pas partie.\nD'où la présence de bénévoles étudiants turcs et étrangers qui marquent les nids, les entourent de bâtons et ramassent les déchets sur la plage, afin d'abriter les œufs des baigneurs. La nuit, ils patrouillent et creusent les nids pour aider certains bébés tortues à briser leur coquille et rejoindre la mer.\nLes autorités locales soutiennent ces initiatives: le maire de Manavgat a placé des lampadaires à lumière rouge le long des routes côtières.\nDes panneaux sont également plantés sur la plage, rappelant en quatre langues que la loi sanctionne de près de 390.000 livres turques (10.700 euros environ) tout dommage causé aux nids.\n\"Nous demandons l'avis des scientifiques et des écologistes sur ce que nous devons faire pour protéger les tortues et nous appliquons leurs conseils\", assure le maire, Niyazi Nefi Kara. \"C'est à nous d'apprendre à vivre en harmonie avec la nature.\"\nSeher Akyol salue ce changement de mentalité. \"Certains habitants craignaient que la plage ne soit fermée. Mais les gens et les Caretta caretta peuvent cohabiter\", soutient-elle.\n\"Puisque nous savons où elles se trouvent grâce aux panneaux, nous faisons notre possible pour ne pas empiéter sur leur espace vital\", assure Songul Sert, 33 ans, en plein pique-nique avec sa famille.\n- Changement climatique -\nLes Caretta caretta, qui pèsent de 90 à 180 kilos, vivent jusqu'à 80 ans.\n\"Le nombre d'œufs et d'éclosions peut sembler élevé, mais le nombre de tortues à même de revenir pondre à terre après 25 ans est extrêmement limité. C'est pourquoi elles sont en danger\", insiste le Pr Mehmet Cengiz Deval, de l'université Akdeniz à Antalya.\nCette tortue marine se trouve principalement dans les régions subtropicales et tempérées des océans Atlantique, Pacifique et Indien, ainsi qu'en Méditerranée.\nL'UICN considère la Caretta caretta de Méditerranée comme la \"moins préoccupante\", mais l'espèce reste vulnérable à l'échelle mondiale.\nLe changement climatique est également une menace, le sexe des nouveaux-nés étant déterminé par la température du sable: la fraîcheur favorise les mâles et la chaleur, les femelles.\n\"La température moyenne des nids est de 32-33 degrés Celsius à partir de juillet, ce qui signifie que la plupart des bébés sont des femelles\", explique le Pr Deval.\n\"Si cette tendance se poursuit, d'ici 30 à 40 ans, les femelles seront majoritaires mais n'auront plus de partenaires mâles pour se reproduire. C'est là le plus grand danger\", prévient-il.\nSeher Akyol, qui a consacré sa vie à la préservation des tortues et rêve d'un centre pour soigner les spécimens blessées, évoque \"leur regard quand elles atteignent l'eau\". \"Vous allez me prendre pour une folle, mais je vous jure qu'elles ont l'air d'exprimer leur gratitude.\"",
