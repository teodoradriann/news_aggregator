    "text": "This past year, there’s been a lot written about the American labor movement’s comeback, particularly after the [United Auto Workers’ strike](https://www.salon.com/2023/09/21/uaws-high-stakes-gambit-this-strike-is-a-potential-paradigm-shift_partner/) which resulted in a 25 percent wage hike and the end of an exploitative tiered workforce which depressed younger workers' earnings for a generation. Yet, what isn’t fully appreciated is just how corrupt the UAW had become before Shawn Fain’s election in 2023 that started the turnaround. Hopeful minds might ask if the UAW can make a comeback with a bigger, bolder vision perhaps we can do the same as a country after the nadir of Donald Trump and a long-simmering insurrection that still grips our nation as we head into the New Year. Just a little over a month after the UAW won it’s unprecedented six-week strike against all three big automakers, the union’s executive board voted to demand an [immediate cease fire](https://uaw.org/uaw-statement-israel-palestine/) in Gaza. It had been a lot of years since the union had taken such a stand at a time when the nation’s most prestigious institutions like Harvard found themselves floundering for lack of moral clarity. In taking a stand, the union, which between retirees and active workers has a million members, signed on to a petition that had been drafted by the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America Union (UE) and UFCW Local 3000. “We members of the American labor movement, mourn the loss of life in Israel and Palestine,” states the petition. “We express our solidarity with all and our common desire for peace in Palestine and Israel, and we call on President Joe Biden and Congress to push for an immediate cease fire and end to the siege of Gaza. We cannot bomb our way to peace. We also condemn any hate crimes against Muslims, Jews, or anyone else.” We need your help to stay independent “It’s important for labor to get out in front of this,” said [Daniel Vicente](https://www.work-bites.com/view-all/m880up9ftkpcgzkmmnrybe7brs9f3y), director of UAW’s Region 9 and member of the union’s executive board, in an interview. “The UAW has a long history of supporting civil and human rights issues around the world and it’s been a long time since the UAW has taken strong stances. Now, under the new leadership of Shawn Fain and the new executive board we are trying to get back to the basics of what the union was founded on —a stable life for the middle class, not just in the United States but the whole world and peace, because we can only have a peaceful world if people have work.” The same day that the UAW weighed in, [1199SEIU](https://www.1199seiu.org/), the nation’s largest healthcare union with close to a half million members, issued a similar call for “the immediate cessation of hostilities in the Gaza Strip, to allow for urgent humanitarian relief amid the collapse of the territory’s health and other infrastructure.” “We reiterate our unequivocal condemnation of Hamas’ attack on October 7, the killings, use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, and kidnappings of Israelis and foreign nationals, 1199SEIU affirmed. “We demand the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages taken by Hamas and the end to indiscriminate rocket attacks against Israel. 1199SEIU continued. “As healthcare workers, we are deeply troubled by the worsening health and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Food, water, and medicine are urgently needed to save the lives of Palestinian civilians caught up in this conflict. We reject the notion that Israel’s attacks on hospitals filled with patients, apartment blocks filled with families, and the deaths of 11,000+ Palestinian women and children are acceptable collateral damage. We urge an immediate ceasefire.” While the corporate news media has zeroed in on newly elected President Fain, there’s been less attention to the deep bench of regional leadership who were part of the grassroots revival. Take for instance new [executive board](https://uaw.org/executive-board/) members like Vicente, 34, whose wife Iman is Palestinian. The couple have four children and live in western New York. “I am also a Marine Corps veteran of the war in Iraq and global war on terrorism so I bought into the narrative that we are a just nation that always does the right thing,” Vicente said. “We could be but right now that is not true. It’s not based on the facts. We invest endless amounts of money on the defense budget and we don’t take care of poor communities where you see drug addiction—where the roads are terrible and the schools are underfunded but we have all the money in the world to put into new guidance systems so that we can decimate entire populations. It has to end sometime.” Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? [Subscribe to our morning newsletter](https://www.salon.com/newsletter), Crash Course. For the UAW, the call for a cease fire in Gaza was just the latest sign of a dynamic revival of one of the nation’s legacy unions that for several years found itself mired in a sprawling corruption probe and criminal prosecution that took down two former UAW presidents and a dozen other union officials as well as auto executives. Department of Justice prosecutors [successfully charged](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edmi/pr/fca-us-llc-pleads-guilty-making-illegal-payments-uaw-officials) that Fiat Chrysler [FCA US LLC], spread $3.5 million around to get the UAW leadership to sell out the membership from 2009 through 2016. “FCA US LLC conspired to make improper labor payments to high-ranking UAW officials, which were used for personal mortgage expenses, lavish parties, and entertainment expenses,” said Irene Lindow, Special Agent-in-Charge with the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, back in March 2021, when the company was hit with a $30 million fine. The announcement from the DOJ continued, “Instead of negotiating in good faith, FCA corrupted the collective bargaining process and the UAW members’ rights to fair representation.” As a consequence of the multiple convictions, the once mighty UAW was put under an independent monitor, under the supervision of a federal judge. For all the UAW’s storied history as a legacy union that helped build the middle class and support social justice causes like the civil rights movement, it was not governed by anything like a direct democracy but by a delegate system. In 2021, the monitor put the question to all of the active and retired union members. 140,586 members voted for the right to have the rank and file pick the union’s leadership while 89,615 opted for the status quo. “I am running because I am sick of the complacency of our top leaders,” Fain said during a virtual candidates forum during the pandemic. Fain, 55, blasted the UAW leadership for viewing “the [auto] companies as our partners rather than our adversaries” and for feathering their own nests with “wage increases, early retirement bonuses, and pensions,” even as the rank-and-file failed to be made whole after major concessions made during the Great Recession of the late 2000s. Fain’s slate, which saw that their own union leadership had been coopted by a rigged economy that works only for multinationals and the very wealthy, prevailed across the country. “I am 34 years old and the director of Region 9 A that represents New York City. Brandon Mancilla is 29 years old,” Vicente said. “So, we were not even alive for the civil rights movement but if you look at their writings and listen to their speeches, they are speaking of the same issues we are dealing with today. We have not gotten better.” Vicente continued. “I have been told my entire 34 years of life from the time I was a little kid in public school that I live in the best country in the world where if you work hard and buckle down you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps—but as it turns out all the machines that made bootstraps were sold overseas during the Clinton administration and those pathways no longer exist.” The militant labor torch has been passed.",

    "text": "Since Steve Strathmann was hired as Bishop Fenwick High School’s president six months ago, he has added a chief operations officer and now a principal.\nThe Catholic school, located on Ohio 122 in Warren County, recently announced the hiring of Steven Herbert as principal. He replaces Blane Collison, who served as principal for eight years, ending 41 years in education.\nHerbert’s hiring follows the school adding Vince Woodall to the newly established role as its chief operations officer. He will oversee the school’s non-academic operations, including financial resources, human resources, facilities, technology, and legal affairs.\nStrathmann called the leadership team a “three-prone approach” where they will handle academics, curriculum, fundraising, student recruitment and operations.\nForming a “dynamic team” committed to guiding Fenwick into a new era of innovation, academic excellence, community service and mission-driven growth was Strathmann’s top priority when he was hired, he said.\n“Now we’re off to the races,” said Strathmann, who hopes to operate the high school more like a university and refer to teachers as instructors.\nHerbert, who was awarded his doctorate from Ohio State University, most recently served as professor of physics at John Carroll University where he was also provost and academic vice president for four years.\nPrior to that, he held a series of academic leadership roles at Xavier University, including associate provost for academic affairs and dean of the graduate school, chair of the Department of Physics and a professor of physics.\n“I am passionate about Catholic education and have been privileged to shape young minds while witnessing the personal and professional growth of generations of budding business and community leaders,” Herbert said in a statement. “Having the opportunity to now work with students during the crucial, formative years of high school is exciting. This is where real impact happens, where habits are formed and students’ characteristics and spiritual formation mature.”\nStrathmann called Herbert “the perfect hire for the perfect time.”\nHe said once Fenwick leads with academics “all great things will follow.”\nWith an official start date of June 25, Herbert will spend his first weeks on the job working with school administrators, faculty and staff, Strathmann said.\nAbout the Author",

    "title": "Good Friday 2024: Famous quotes by poets and authors on Good Friday - Times of India",
    "text": "Good Friday, which is being celebrated on March 29, 2024, is an important observance for Christians across the world. This day marks the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and which lead to his death at Calvary. Good Friday holds profound religious and cultural importance as it symbolises sacrifice, redemption, and divine love.As per the Gospels, Jesus Christ, who was considered as the Son of God and a Messiah by people who followed him, arrived to Jerusalem in a week which led up to Passover. Christ's teachings had stirred both controversy and admiration among people at that time. Good Friday commemorates the end of Jesus' earthly life, as he knowingly endured betrayal, arrest, trial, and crucification. On this day, Christians offer their prayers and services, and reflect upon Christ's self-less sacrifice for the salvation of humanity.At the heart of the Christian faith is the belief that Christ, atoned for the sins of humanity through his death on the cross. This bridged the gap between God and humanity, and it offered a promise of eternal life to those people who believe in him. And so, Good Friday represents God's redemptive plan, thus demonstrating God's mercy and grace.On the occassion of Good Friday today, here we list down some famous quotes by poets and authors on Good Friday. Read on to know more.1. \\\"The cross is not the terrible end to an otherwise godfearing and happy life, but it meets us at the beginning of our communion with Christ.\\\" - Dietrich Bonhoeffer2. \\\"We may say that on the first Good Friday afternoon was completed that great act by which light conquered darkness and goodness conquered sin. That is the wonder of our Saviour's crucifixion.\\\" - Phillips Brooks3. “I believe in person to person. Every person is Christ to me, and since there is only one Jesus, that person is the one person in the world at that moment. ~ Mother Teresa4. “A man who was completely innocent, offered himself as a sacrifice for the good of others, including his enemies, and became the ransom of the world. It was a perfect act.” ~ Mahatma Gandhi5. “The way of the cross is the way of suffering. Christians are called to die, not kill, in order to show the world how they are loved by Christ.” ~ John Piper6. \\\"The cross is the victory, the resurrection is the triumph…The resurrection is the public display of the victory, the triumph of the crucified one.\\\" - Leon Morris7. “If Christ is God, He cannot sin, and if suffering was a sin in and by itself, He could not have suffered and died for us. However, since He took the most horrific death to redeem us, He showed us in fact that suffering and pain have great power.”― E.A. Bucchianeri, Brushstrokes of a Gadfly 1088293068. \\\"The highest act of love is the giving of the best gift, and, if necessary, at the greatest cost, to the least deserving. That's what God did. At the loss of His Son's life to the totally undeserving, God gave the best gift - the display of the glory of Christ who is the image of God.\\\" - John Piper“The dripping blood our only drink,The bloody flesh our only food:In spite of which we like to thinkThat we are sound, substantial flesh and blood--Again, in spite of that, we call this Friday good.”― T.S. Eliot9. “We focus on Good Friday and Resurrection Sunday, but we forget to pause in the stillness of the days between. Find time today to be present in that place of waiting. There is treasure to be found in the sacred peace that comes as you breathe in that place of quiet surrender. Don’t rush through the space called “Between.” ― Katherine J Walden10. \\\"Maybe the Good Friday story is about how God would rather die than be in our sin-accounting business anymore.”― Nadia Bolz-Weber, Pastrix: The Cranky, Beautiful Faith of a Sinner & Saint11. \\\"No matter what the storm clouds bring, you can face your pain with courage and hope. For two thousand years ago-six hours, one Friday-Christ firmly planted in bedrock three solid anchor points that we can all cling to. For the heart scarred with futility, that Friday holds purpose. For the life blackened with failure, that Friday holds forgiveness. And for the soul looking into the tunnel of death, that Friday holds deliverance.\\\" - Max Lucado12. “The Cross! There, and there only though the deist rave, and the atheist, if Earth bears so base a slave; There and there only, is the power to save.” ― William Cowper13. \\\"The Cross was the manifestation of Divine love without reserve or limit; but it was also the expression of man’s unutterable malignity.”― Sir Robert Anderson14. “Good Friday is not about us trying to “get right with God.” It is about us entering the difference between God and humanity and just touching it for a moment. Touching the shimmering sadness of humanity’s insistence that we can be our own gods, that we can be pure and all-powerful.”― Nadia Bolz-Weber15. \\\"Unless there is a Good Friday in your life, there can be no Easter Sunday.” ― Fulton J.

    "title": "Nacimientos en Colombia cayeron entre enero y octubre un 14,4% respecto a 2023",
    "text": "El número de nacimientos en el país continúa bajando. De acuerdo con cifras del Dane, en 2023, se\nalcanzó su nivel más bajo de la última década, con 515.549 nacimientos, es decir,153.588 menos que en 2014; además, se presentó una reducción del -10,1% respecto al año anterior.\nSegún el Dane, en lo corrido de 2024 esta tendencia se acentuó, haciendo que el país alcance la cifra más baja de nacimientos ocurridos entre el 1 de enero y el 31 de octubre de cada año, durante la última década, con un total de 371.777 nacidos vivos. Ello representa una reducción del -14,4% respecto al mismo período del año anterior (434.253), es decir, 62.476 nacimientos menos.\nAl respecto, Javier Sebastián Ruiz, director de Censos y Demografías del Dane, manifestó que: “El descenso de los nacimientos, que ocurre desde hace años, se acelera desde 2022. Y esta caída del 10,1 entre 2022 y 2023 es una cifra histórica, la más alta desde que se puso en marcha el sistema de medición de estadísticas vitales en 1998”.\n“El Dane ha registrado disminuciones en la fecundidad desde 2005. Pero empieza a verse una disminución sostenida desde 2017, con un gran impacto que se acentuó con la pandemia de la covid-19”, agregó Ruiz.\nLos departamentos que registraron las mayores caídas en los nacimientos, el año pasado, fueron: Guainía (-40,7%), Vaupés (-20,0%), Amazonas (-17,8%) Vichada (-16,5%) y Cesar (-15,6%). Mientras que La Guajira y Guaviare, han mostrado aumentos respecto a 2014, lo cual, puede estar asociada a mejoras en el registro de hechos vitales en estos territorios.\nSumado a ello, marzo se consolidó por segundo año consecutivo como el mes con mayor número de nacimientos, alcanzando en 2023 un total de 45.529 nacidos vivos. Por su parte, septiembre ocupa el segundo lugar como uno de los meses con más nacimientos, tanto en 2023 como en lo corrido de 2024, precedido por agosto en este último periodo. Sin embargo, en 2024 ningún mes ha superado los 40.000 nacimientos, siendo junio el mes con la cifra más baja de la serie 2019-2024, con 34.705 nacidos vivos\nBajo peso al nacer\nE bajo peso al nacer, según la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) se define como un peso\npor debajo de los 2.500 gramos al nacer. En Colombia, durante 2024 se alcanzó el máximo histórico del 11,3%, reflejando un incremento sostenido durante la última década.\nEl bajo peso al nacer afecta especialmente a los hijos de madres sin educación o con bajo nivel educativo, alcanzando un 19,7% en Bogotá en 2023.\nSegún el Dane, en 2023 se registraron un total de 268.411 defunciones no fetales, lo que representó una tasa de mortalidad de 5,1 por cada 1.000 habitantes, continuando con una tendencia levemente creciente que se presentó entre el año 2014 y el año 2019. Mientras que en el periodo de enero a octubre de 2024, se han reportado 227.641 defunciones, lo que representa un incremento del 1,6% en\ncomparación con el mismo periodo del año anterior.\nVALENTINA DELGADILLO ABELLO\nPeriodista Portafolio",
