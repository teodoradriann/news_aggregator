    "title": "An appeal from Brazilian women on a peace mission in the Middle East",
    "text": "This appeal was sent to Workers World by Marcia De Campos Pereira in Brazil, former president of the International Federation of Democratic Women (FDIM). The women in Brazil who issued it are asking progressive organizations in the U.S. to add their signatures.\nApril 30, 2024. In memory of Mayada Abassi, Former Ambassador of Palestine to Brazil and Secretary of International Relations of the General Union of Palestinian Women (UGMP).\nLetter to the Brazilian Government, entities and leaders of communities in Central America, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP):\nProtest in São Paulo, Brazil, Nov. 4, 2023. ‘No to the occupation of Gaza. Down with Israel’s genocide of Palestinians.’\nThe Brazilian Union of Women (UBM), the Brazilian Center for Solidarity with the People and Fight for Peace (CEBRAPAZ) and the International Democratic Federation of Women (FDIM), actively listening to “Palestinian Women, the Pillar of Resistance,” engaged in the fight for Peace and in Defense of Palestine, sought to give visibility to Palestinian women because they, together with children, have been more than 70 percent of the people murdered by Israel.\nPalestinian women have always been an integral part of the struggle for freedom and emancipation of their people. The history of Palestinian resistance is full of names of heroines, activists who refused to remain silent and without action while Palestine was colonized.\nIn addition to the many names recorded in Palestinian history, there are thousands of combative and heroic women who have always been “and will still be” part of this history of resistance: they are grandmothers, mothers, sisters, friends, comrades. They are in a permanent struggle and resistance for the right to exist and for their children and grandchildren to live with dignity.\nStop genocide in Palestine! Lula, break relations with Israel! São Paulo, Nov. 4, 2023.\nHowever, Israel refuses to give up the territory it illegally occupies, to dismantle its apartheid system, to respect international law and the rights of the Palestinian people. To this end, it maintains a ruse into which it intends to drag the United States and other allies. Israel’s strategy is to break isolation by attacking disaffected governments, such as Iran, in order to drag the entire region into an unprecedented conflict.\nStop genocide in Palestine! Lula, break relations with Israel! São Paulo, Nov. 4, 2023.\nThe key to avoiding a regional war is a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, allowing humanitarian aid delivery and assistance, recognition of the “Palestinian State” with an end to the Israeli occupation, and a fair peace agreement.\nResponding to the calls for active listening by “Palestinian Women, the Pillar of Resistance” and the outcry of statements from Palestinian institutions and intellectuals, we are making some necessary propositions for immediate and forceful action with the Brazilian government, as well as urging entities and leaders of communities in Central America, Latin America and the Caribbean and the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP), with the leading role in the “Lula tem Razão!” [Lula is Correct] movement, from the Global South.\nIn this way, we position ourselves against the lies disseminated by “Zionist propaganda” in the mainstream press, which has been distorting the facts and reality of the legitimate and just cause for emancipation and the right to self-determination of the Palestinian People.\nThat said, we echo the calls for “active listening” with this hearing:\n1st Appeal: For harassed and imprisoned women\nThe Israeli army, steadily and daily, is implementing policies of retaliation and revenge against Palestinian women and girls, carrying out beatings, domestic vandalism and humiliation, without taking into account their privacy, by invading homes, especially those of Palestinian women who were detained and recently released. We express our aim to promote a feminist mobilization to support Palestinian women, expose the crimes committed against them by the occupation and exert pressure on governments and parliaments to take responsibility to stop the denial of women’s rights in Palestine, considering that recently there was an escalation in the detentions of Palestinian women and girls, based on reprisals against political-ideological tendencies and the use of the detained as hostages. It is necessary to mention that there are currently 81 women detained in Israeli prisons in precarious health conditions, the majority of them in Damoun prison, without medical assistance and at risk to their lives. 2nd Appeal: To end the supply of weapons to Israel\nThe continuous supply of arms and ammunition from the United States and allied countries to Israel, encouraging it to wage war and aggressive actions, and pledging to protect it militarily and politically, will always encourage Israel to go further in its crimes, which gradually increased to the level of genocide. We call on human rights, humanitarian and civil rights organizations and militants active in countries of the Global North to follow the example of their French counterparts in bringing legal action against European governments that support Israel with weapons, holding them accountable for supporting Israel in its crimes and obliging them to stop exporting weapons and ammunition to Israel and to refrain from providing political cover for their crimes. We demand that governments break contracts for weapons and ammunition, consultancy and provision of services in public security and environmental management with the State of Israel, such as the partnership contracts between Brazil and Argentina with Mekorot (Israel’s main national water agency) in the region of Patagonia for the administration in water management and basic sanitation. 3rd Appeal: To freeze diplomatic relations\nWe appeal to international public opinion to pressure the occupying authority to avoid a catastrophe in Rafah, at a time when the Israeli occupation army continues its bloody attack on all areas of the destroyed Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem. As we address this appeal to the Brazilian government and the leaders of Central America, Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP), among others that maintain diplomatic relations with Israel, we urge them to freeze their relations with Israel in order to avoid the invasion of Rafah and a military confrontation that could escalate into a war against Iran. Any country that maintains diplomatic relations with this [Israeli] entity, which, under current circumstances, threatens Palestinian existence and all Arab national security, will tarnish its own image. It is an ethical and moral duty of states to suspend relations with a country that violates the norms of international law. 4th Appeal: To the resistance of the working class\nWe call on activists and organizations from around the world to establish May 1, 2024, International Workers Day, as “Palestinian Resistance Workers Day,” aiming to highlight the need to defend the Palestinian resistance in its right to fight for its liberation, strengthening it at a higher level against the oppression of workers around the world. We make this call at this decisive moment in the developing world’s revolt against U.S. imperialism and the countries of the North to affirm that the path for the labor movement to re-establish itself on a global scale as an agent of revolutionary transformation is to courageously ally with the liberation struggles of the Global South and mobilize workers towards this objective. 5th Appeal: For freedom of the press and communication\nThe Freedoms Committee of the Palestinian Journalists Union denounced Israel for continuing to target and close media institutions in occupied Jerusalem, while insisting on the decision preventing satellite TV channels from operating in Jerusalem, in addition to banning journalists from working on press coverage in Jerusalem, around the Al-Aqsa Mosque, in the Occupied West Bank and mainly in Gaza, where journalists have been deliberately targeted in murderous and systemic attacks, including against their families, with the destruction of equipment, work and their homes. It is essential to support and subsidize legally and diplomatically the Palestinian Journalists Union in its tireless efforts and demands to prosecute Israel for its crimes, including murder, aggression and impeding the exercise of journalistic activity in Palestine at all levels, regional and international, while reporting Israel’s crimes that meet the legal requirements of war crimes tribunals and international tribunals, as freedom of the press and expression is a cornerstone of human rights. These are principles that must be respected. 6th Appeal: For academic and scientific freedom\nProfessor Shalhoub-Kevorkian was arrested by Israeli police on April 18, 2024, on suspicion of inciting terrorism and violence because of her unwavering stance against the genocide in Gaza and her insightful analysis of Israeli settler colonialism and its racialized violence. Her arrest, during which she suffered psychological torture and ill-treatment, follows an ongoing campaign of harassment, including a letter demanding that she resign from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem for signing a ceasefire declaration. The treatment of intellectuals and academics in Israeli prisons exemplifies a systematic pattern of “educacide” against Palestinian academics and educational institutions. Furthermore, the fact that an internationally renowned academic is being detained and persecuted in this way will have a chilling effect on academic freedom and solidarity with Palestine. We call on you to sever all ties and cease all collaboration and joint projects of any kind with universities and research institutes that maintain this persecutory pattern against academics, intellectuals and students/researchers until they put an end to their decades-long collaboration with the Israeli occupation and the apartheid system, in defense of academic and scientific freedom. The organizations that produced this letter invite other interested organizations, institutions and groups to sign the letter, in a joint effort to support Palestinian women and promote peace in the region. Interested parties can contact us via email at [email protected] and [email protected] to join the initiative.\nAccess the letter in full with the updated list HERE: https://abrir.link/ LGwPc\nThis letter represents a collective effort for justice, solidarity and peace in Palestine, demonstrating the importance of international unity and mobilization in times of conflict and injustice.",

    "title": "Brady’s Garden and Spa Center celebrating 30th anniversary with special event Friday – Canon City Daily Record",
    "text": "Spring is just around the corner and, already, daffodils, crocus, and tulips are beginning to emerge from the winter soils. Along with them is the familiar and exciting buzz of activity at Brady’s Garden and Spa Center, which is preparing not only for the busy spring season but also for its 30th-anniversary party. “We throw a good party so it’s just good to celebrate,” said co-owner Dean Brady. Brady’s will celebrate their 30th anniversary from 5 to 8 p.m. Friday at 1121 S. 9th St. Mystic 7 will be on hand to provide live music and, according to Dean, there will be libations, gambling for prizes, appetizers (provided by Chicago Bob’s), and other entertainment to fill out the evening. One of the evening’s grand prizes up for grabs will be a Ukiah Bluetooth fire pit, which regularly sells for about $1,000. Other prizes include commemorative 30th-anniversary shopping bags, hats, and tools. The party is open to all age groups and, according to Dean, “the more the merrier.” Though Brady’s has sat at 1121 S. 9th St. since it opened March 1, 1994, the family’s history of gardening stretches back to the 1960s. It was Dick Brady, Dean’s father, who opened Brady’s Evergreen Nursery in Westcliffe in 1961. In 1970, the nursery moved to its current location in Cañon City and has remained for 53 solid years. Dean and his three brothers Darren, Derald, and Delwin are all equal partners in the business and, between them, have mountains of gardening and landscaping expertise. “We were born and raised in the nursery,” Dean said. Thirty years have flown by for Dean, his wife, Angela, and their staff and he fondly remembers their first day in business. “The first lady that came in didn’t have any cash, and I really wanted the first sale to be in cash so she was really nice and went to the bank and got cash and came back,” he said with a smile. The first dollar is still framed at the store and, through the years, Brady’s has continued to grow. Since opening their doors, Brady’s has added the greenhouse on the south wall of the main building and they even purchased the property to the north to start the spa center and make room for dirt, mulches, and trees from the nursery. “We carry trees, shrubs, annuals, perennials, insecticides, herbicides but with a knowledgable staff and with the knowledge to use things correctly,” Dean said. In 2008, the brothers opened Brady’s West Garden Center in Salida and have experienced success in that area, as well. “We have a whole, whole lot of experience and history and years in this business,” Dean said about the successful storefronts. Twelve members of the Brady family currently work at the two storefronts in Cañon City and Salida and, although Dean and his brothers have yet to name a successor(s), the family name courses strong through the successful businesses. In addition to being a spring and summer staple for Fremont County, Brady’s has also given back to the community in numerous ways during its three decades, including donations to the Canon Literacy Center, the Fireman’s Ball, the Cañon City Pregnancy Center, and dozens of other worthy causes. In fact, Brady’s donated the blue spruce trees that were planted at the candlelight vigil that was held Oct. 15 to grieve the victims of the Return to Nature Funeral Home. “This is my home and always will be. We’re part of the community and always will be,” Dean said. “Cañon’s given us a lot so we like to give back.”",

    "title": "¿Adiós sequía en México? Estas presas se llenaron tras paso de la tormenta Alberto",
    "text": "Presa de Nuevo León ¿AdiÃ&sup3;s a la sequÃ­a en MÃ©xico? Varias presas del paÃ­s, que habÃ­an registrado niveles crÃ­ticamente bajos, aumentaron su capacidad de almacenamiento tras el paso de la tormenta tropical Alberto. AquÃ­ te decimos quÃ© presas se llenaron. ¿Qué presas de México se llenaron tras la tormenta tropical Alberto? Después de enfrentar meses de sequías severas en los estados del norte de México, las presas en Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, Coahuila y Veracruz han visto un significativo aumento en sus niveles de almacenamiento. El aumento en la capacidad de las presas de Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, Coahuila y Veracruz se debe al paso de la tormenta tropical Alberto, que tocó tierra la madrugada del jueves 20 de junio, trayendo consigo intensas lluvias. Anteriormente, estas presas estaban casi vacías debido a las prolongadas condiciones de sequía, pero las recientes lluvias han comenzado a estabilizar sus niveles de agua. Presa de Nuevo León Foto: Cuartoscuro Según el Monitor de Sequía de México, el 70.76% del país aún sufre de sequía en rangos de moderada a excepcional. Información actualizada al 15 de mayo por la Comisión Nacional del Agua (Conagua) y el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) indica que esta cifra ha aumentado un 2.79% desde finales de abril de este año, destacando la persistente urgencia de la situación hídrica nacional. ¿Cuánto mejoró el nivel de las presas tras la tormenta Alberto? Conagua reportó que la presa La Boca, ubicada en Nuevo León, alcanzó niveles críticos de agua, lo que llevó a la decisión de abrir sus compuertas para distribuir el recurso hídrico hacia las presas El Cuchillo y Cerro Prieto. El gobernador de Nuevo León, Samuel García, anunció que entre las 10:00 y las 12:00 horas del jueves se abrieron las compuertas de La Boca, en respuesta al inminente llenado de la presa. Samuel García también emitió una alerta máxima para la población del río San Juan, advirtiendo del flujo de agua que se dirigiría hacia la presa El Cuchillo. A las 12:40 horas, La Boca registraba un 81% de su capacidad.

Las presas Cerro Prieto y El Cuchillo mostraban niveles de 5.18% y 31.6% respectivamente. En San Luis Potosí, la dirección local de la Conagua suspendió el trasvase de agua hacia Tamaulipas debido a las lluvias. Joel Félix Díaz, director local, indicó que los bombeos en las plantas El Porvenir y Tulillo-Chapacao se detuvieron el 19 de junio a las 18:00 horas. Aclaró que la reanudación de estos bombeos dependerá del agua acumulada en el sistema lagunar de Tamaulipas, que abastece a cerca de un millón de habitantes en Tampico, Ciudad Madero y Altamira. Con la llegada de la tormenta Alberto, el panorama hídrico ha mejorado en los estados del norte, marcando un contraste con las condiciones previamente secas y calurosas reportadas hasta la segunda quincena de mayo. Presas como La Amistad y Venustiano Carranza en Coahuila; La Boca, El Cuchillo, Cerro Prieto y La Libertad en Nuevo León; y Falcón y Vicente Guerrero en Tamaulipas, están bajo especial vigilancia. Adicionalmente, en Tamaulipas, el gobernador Américo Villarreal destacó que las fuertes lluvias han elevado los niveles de los ríos Corona y Purificación, beneficiando potencialmente a 350 mil habitantes con el aumento de agua en la presa Vicente Guerrero.",

    "text": "Danish Ali objects to Sunehri Bagh Masjid’s proposed removal in letter to conservation panel\nNew Delhi, Dec 28 (PTI) Lok Sabha MP from Amroha Danish Ali has raised objections on the proposed removal of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid in the national capital, saying the mosque has historical and archaeological importance.\nThe New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has sought public opinion on the mosque’s proposed removal.\nIn a notice issued on Sunday, NDMC invited citizens’ objections and suggestions on the matter by January 1. The mosque, which stands on a roundabout in central Delhi, has been proposed to be removed on grounds of traffic snarls in the area.\nIn a letter to the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC), Ali said that such a “drastic step is unwarranted”, given the “historical and archaeological importance” of the mosque.\nAli said the proposed removal could raise questions about the fairness of targeting a specific religious structure and undermine public confidence.\n“The proposed removal raises concerns about the fairness of the process, especially considering the contribution of the Muslim community to nation-building and the ethos of India,” Ali said in his letter.\nThe Delhi Waqf Board had previously approached the Delhi High Court expressing concerns about the potential demolition of the mosque during a joint survey, Ali said.\nThe court proceedings related to the Delhi Waqf Board were closed on December 18, with “the Additional Solicitor General stating that the apprehension for demolition had no basis”, the MP said.\n“The issuance of the notice right after the High Court closed for vacation raises doubts about the fairness of the process,” he added.\nThe Sunehri Bagh Masjid is among 123 properties in Delhi claimed by the waqf board that are part of a pending Delhi High Court case, according to the MP.\nHe stressed that assurances were given in court that no proposals for steps beyond the inspection of such properties were given.\nAli also said that the HCC, established for the conservation and protection of heritage sites, should not be involved in facilitating their removal.\n“The proposed removal of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid goes against the very purpose of the committee,” he said.\nThe Amroha MP also questioned the necessity of removing the mosque saying there were no significant traffic congestion issues around the Sunehri Masjid roundabout.\nAli requested the HCC to reconsider its notice and refrain from granting approval for the removal of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid.\n“In today’s technologically advanced era, alternative methods for traffic management that do not involve the removal of a historical and religious structure can and should be explored by the Delhi Traffic Police,” he said.",
