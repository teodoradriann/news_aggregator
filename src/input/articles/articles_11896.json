    "title": "Prop. 36 asks California voters to OK stricter punishments for repeat drug, theft offenders | | hastingstribune.com",
    "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. — This November, Proposition 36 will ask California voters whether to undo a handful of criminal justice reforms they approved a decade ago. In 2014, voters passed another ballot measure called Proposition 47, which reduced punishments for a handful of non-violent drug and theft crimes. Prop. 47 made most drug possession crimes a misdemeanor and raised the threshold for felony theft and forgery from $400 to $950. This year’s Proposition 36 is pushed by a coalition of district attorneys from across the state, along with major retailers like Target and Walmart. It’s aimed at cracking down on retail theft and fentanyl, and supporters argue it would close gaps in the state’s sentencing rules to bring more accountability. Videos of retail thefts – from coordinated smash-and-grabs at designer stores to individuals stuffing items in backpacks at drugstores – during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic threw a spotlight on the issue. And the emergence of the potent opioid fentanyl, which led to the deaths of around 6,000 Californians in 2021, has added new urgency to the drug crisis. State lawmakers in California’s Democratic supermajority have wrestled with how to address the two issues without undoing the main tenets of Prop. 47, which was passed in part to reduce the population in the state’s overcrowded prisons. Progressive Democrats in control of the Legislature’s public safety committees have, for the most part, refused to pass laws that would increase criminal penalties, citing a historically biased criminal justice system that has put disproportionately more Black and brown people behind bars. Because of that, Prop. 36 has fractured the ranks of elected Democrats. Gov. Gavin Newsom, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, Senate President pro Tem Mike McGuire and other Democratic lawmakers oppose the ballot measure. But some moderate Democratic lawmakers and influential big-city mayors support it. Newsom and legislative leaders were even planning a countermeasure earlier this summer, but they abandoned it at the eleventh-hour last month, just before lawmakers recessed for their summer recess. What a ‘yes’ vote on Prop. 36 means Prop. 36 contains several components related to criminal punishments. A yes vote would: •Increase punishment for certain drug and theft crimes. Currently, theft of property worth $950 or less is usually a misdemeanor. Prop. 36 would make it a felony for people who have two or more previous theft-related convictions on their record. •Create a new “treatment-mandated felony” classification for drug crimes. If a person with two or more previous drug convictions is charged with possession of a substance — specifically, fentanyl, heroin, cocaine or methamphetamine — they could be ordered to get treatment. Those who finish treatment could have their charges dismissed; however, failure to complete treatment could result in a sentence of up to three years in prison. •Require courts to warn people convicted of selling or giving drugs to others that they could be charged with murder if they sell drugs that kill someone. What a ‘no’ vote means A no vote on Proposition 36 would keep criminal sentencing laws as they are: theft valued under $950 and drug possession crimes would continue to generally be prosecuted as misdemeanors, with a punishment of up to one year in jail. Who supports Prop. 36? Prop. 36 is supported by a broad swath of business and law enforcement groups, the California Republican Party and a smattering of Democratic elected officials. The California Business Roundtable, California Sheriffs Association, California District Attorneys Association and the California Retailers Association are supporting the measure. Mayors supporting Prop. 36 include Democrats London Breed of San Francisco, Todd Gloria of San Diego, Matt Mahan of San Jose and Bobbie Singh-Allen of Elk Grove. “California is suffering from an explosion in crime and the trafficking of deadly hard drugs like fentanyl,” proponents wrote in official ballot arguments for the measure. “Prop. 36 will fix the mess our politicians have ignored for far too long. It is a balanced approach that corrects loopholes in state law that criminals exploit to avoid accountability for fentanyl trafficking and repeat retail theft.” As of mid-August, the Yes campaign had raised more than $7.9 million. Top donors include major retailers like Walmart ($2.5 million), Target ($1 million) and Home Depot ($1 million). Opponents of Prop. 36 While some Democrats are supporting Prop. 36, many others oppose it, including Newsom, lawmakers and some progressive DAs, including Diana Becton of Contra Costa County. The initiative also faces opposition from criminal justice reform groups like the Anti-Recidivism Coalition and the Vera Institute of Justice. “We must address persistent problems like theft and fentanyl, but we must use solutions that work and are targeted at the actual issue, instead of the scattershot failed solutions of the past,” opponents wrote in the official ballot arguments “By making simple drug possession a felony, this measure will send thousands into state prison, drive up prison costs, and slash money for local safety programs. That will make crime worse, not better.” As of mid-August a ballot committee opposing Prop. 36 had raised $195,000, with sizeable donations from the ACLU of Northern California along with philanthropists Quinn Delaney and Stacy H. Schusterman. Fiscal impacts of Prop. 36 If approved, Prop. 36 would likely increase state criminal justice costs by tens or hundreds of millions of dollars; counties could also pay tens of millions more, according to an analysis by the Legislative Analyst’s Office. That’s because harsher criminal punishments means people convicted of these crimes would spend more time in prison. The LAO analysis predicts the state prison population, which is currently around 90,000, could grow by “a few thousand people” under Prop. 36. Statewide, county jails could see a similar increase. State court workloads would also increase since felonies take more time to resolve than misdemeanors. Finally, by undoing parts of Prop. 47, the measure could mean less funding for mental health, drug treatment, and other prevention programs. ©2024 The Sacramento Bee. Visit at sacbee.com.

    "text": "Sunday marked the birth anniversary of late and legendary actor Irrfan Khan. He was born on January 7, 1967 in India. He was one of the finest actors in Hindi cinema and unfortunately passed away in April 2020. If he were alive, he would have turned 57 today. Irrfan had an illustrious career that lasted for over 30 years. He not only acted in Bollywood films but also worked on various international projects like The Darjeeling Limited, Slumdog Millionaire, The Amazing Spider-Man, Life Of Pi, Jurassic World, Inferno and many others. Interestingly, Irrfan was even approached for a role in Christopher Nolan’s 2014 film Interstellar. However, he turned down the offer and once shared the reason behind his decision. He had to turn down the opportunity due to scheduling issues. Taking up the role would have meant staying back in the US for a stretch of four months. Irrfan revealed that it wouldn’t have been possible for him to stay there for so long, as he wanted to be in India for The Lunchbox and D-Day. In a throwback interview with Times of India, Irrfan Khan had said, “They expected a huge commitment from my end. I had to stay in the US for four months at a stretch. I tried to work out my schedule and suggested if I could shuttle between India and the US as it wouldn’t have been possible for me to be there for that long. I wanted to be here for The Lunchbox and D-Day. They couldn’t allow that.” He mentioned that he didn’t have a tendency to regret decisions, but knowing that it was a Christopher Nolan film, this was one of the most difficult decisions he had to make. Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi action film Interstellar is one of his biggest blockbuster releases. The movie starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Matt Damon was loved by audience and critics alike.",

    "text": "[Meteo](/meteo/)\nLa prima perturbazione del 2025 si abbatte sulla Campania: cosa accadrà\nSvolta poi nel weekend\nLa prima perturbazione del 2025 sta per raggiungere le regioni meridionali, scalzando l’alta pressione presente da giorni. Già nel corso del pomeriggio piogge e rovesci si faranno via via più diffusi, a partire dai settori settentrionali della regione. La perturbazione, nella giornata di sabato, si muoverà rapidamente verso Levante e, dopo aver portato gli ultimi fenomeni, lascerà spazio a un graduale miglioramento dal Nord già dal mattino. Tuttavia, questo miglioramento non durerà a lungo: una seconda perturbazione è attesa entro l’Epifania e raggiungerà la nostra penisola, portando un nuovo rinforzo dei venti dai quadranti sud-occidentali. Domenica si assisterà a un deciso aumento della nuvolosità sulla Campania, ma ancora senza precipitazioni significative. Le piogge arriveranno solo nelle prime ore dell’Epifania, più probabili sui settori centro-settentrionali. Altri disturbi potrebbero interessare, infine, la regione almeno fino alla metà della prossima settimana, come spiega Manuel Mazzoleni, metereologo di 3BMeteo.com.\nIl forte vento atteso nel pomeriggio/sera di oggi tenderà a diminuire nel weekend, per poi rinforzarsi sensibilmente tra l’Epifania e i giorni successivi, con il rischio di mareggiate. Le temperature sono attese in lieve rialzo nel corso del weekend.\nPrevisioni\n-\nNapoli\nTempo in peggioramento nel corso delle prossime ore per l’arrivo di una perturbazione responsabile di piogge fino alla serata. Miglioramento sabato, quando il sole tornerà protagonista. Nuvolosità in nuovo aumento domenica, in attesa di un parziale peggioramento del tempo tra l’Epifania e martedì. Clima mite con massime nei prossimi giorni tra 16 e 18°C. -\nAvellino\nTempo in peggioramento nel corso delle prossime ore per l’arrivo di una perturbazione responsabile di piogge fino alla serata. Miglioramento sabato mattina, con il sole che tornerà protagonista.

Furthermore, greater attention has been paid to cybersecurity and information safety. He also pointed out outstanding problems and weak points in the field and requested greater efforts in 2024. The PM asked the committee along with steering committees for the digital transformation of ministries, agencies, and localities to urgently issue digital transformation plans for 2024, which should focus on developing the digital economy across four pillars, namely the information technology industry, digitalization of economic sectors, digital management and digital data. He emphasized improving the effectiveness of online public services, particularly the 53 essential services, developing the national digital infrastructure, including the building of the National Data Center; upgrading the national axis to early commercialize 5G services in 2024, eliminating mobile signal dead zones nationwide, and striving for all villages and hamlets to be provided with fiber-optic cable connectivity. He requested the effective development of digital platforms, applications, and services, particularly artificial intelligence platforms, virtual assistants, the VNeID digital citizen application, digital payment applications, electronic invoices and contracts, and personal digital signatures. The Government leader also assigned tasks to ministries, sectors, and localities in digital transformation next year. Reports delivered at the meeting highlighted that the World Intellectual Property Organisation ranked Vietnam 46th in the 2023 Global Innovation Index, up two places compared to 2022. The national digital transformation index rose by 48 percent after three years from a value of 0.48 in 2020 to 0.71 in 2022, and is forecast to reach 0.75 in 2023. The digital economy is growing at an average of 20 percent a year, three times the GDP growth rate, and its share in the national economy is estimated at 16.5 percent this year. Vietnam was among the top 10 countries in terms of the number of new mobile application downloads for two consecutive years 2022 and 2023. The user base on digital platforms in the country experienced a 46 percent growth compared to 2022. By the end of this year, ministries and agencies reduced and simplified nearly 2,500 business regulations, streamlining 528 out of 1,086 administrative procedures related to citizens. The Ministry of Information and Communications proposed that digital transformation in 2024 should go in the direction of universalizing digital infrastructure, and creating digital applications to serve the development of the digital economy as a new driver for economic growth and productivity enhancement.",

    "text": "[In The News](https://www.conservativedailynews.com/category/trending-topics/breaking-news/) DOJ Sends Musk’s PAC Warning Over $1 Million Voter Lottery These payments might breach laws against compensating people to register or vote in elections involving federal candidates, [according](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/justice-department-cautions-musk-pac-on-1-million-voter-lottery-06bd9eb2?mod=hp_lead_pos2) to the DOJ’s letter, WSJ reported. Musk’s political action committee has been actively promoting the chance to win $1 million for registered voters in Pennsylvania and six other pivotal states who pledge their support for free speech and gun rights by signing a petition. The America Pac declined to comment but a spokesperson earlier claimed their cash awards were entirely legal, suggesting that the outcry from media only aids their cause. “The PAC is confident in the legality of this initiative and the predictable media meltdown is only helping America PAC’s efforts to support President Trump,” a representative said earlier this week, WSJ stated. Three voters from Pennsylvania and one in North Carolina have secured million-dollar rewards, with daily drawings set to continue through Election Day, targeting both new and existing registrants, WSJ reported. [Musk](https://dailycaller.com/2024/10/16/elon-musk-censorship-x-unilever-lawsuit-advertising/) stated that the million-dollar rewards from his PAC come without conditions, except for the expectation that winners advocate for his petition. The sweepstakes aims to boost voter registrations in battleground areas as he fervently supports former President Donald Trump’s re-election bid. Musk [announced](https://dailycaller.com/2024/10/20/elon-musk-million-election-day-america-pac-trump/) at a Pennsylvania rally for Trump’s campaign Saturday evening that he will give $1 million daily to one individual. UCLA law professor Rick Hasen previously [raised](https://dailycaller.com/2024/10/21/law-prof-constitution-should-be-amended-silence-wealthy-elon-musk/) a question about whether a constitutional amendment is necessary to curb the campaign influence of ultra-wealthy individuals like Musk. Hasen pointed out on MSNBC that under current law, efforts to curb election spending by the ultra-rich have been deemed unconstitutional, affirming the legality of Musk’s activities with his super PAC and other ventures.

    "text": "Red-Hot Knights Cruise Past Tides 5-3 on Thursday\nSeptember 5, 2024 -\nInternational League (IL) Charlotte Knights News Release\n(NORFOLK, VA) -- RHP Sean Burke cruised through one of his best starts of the season to help the Charlotte Knights beat the Norfolk Tides by a score of 5-3 in game three of the six-game series from Harbor Park in Norfolk, VA on Thursday afternoon. With the win, the Knights have now won three consecutive games and five of the last six games.\nMaking his 16th start of the season, Burke (2-6, 4.62) allowed just two runs on five hits over five innings to earn his second win of the season. Even more special, he set a new career high in strikeouts in a Triple-A game by accumulating nine on the afternoon. His previous high was eight. He also walked just one batter and threw 82 pitches, 56 for strikes. Reliever Adisyn Coffey pitched a perfect ninth inning to record his team-high ninth save of the season.\nAt the plate, the Knights used the long ball on the afternoon, getting home runs from shortstop Colson Montgomery and right fielder Oscar Colás. Montgomery hit the first Charlotte home run of the game, a two-run blast in the top of the fourth inning. The home run was his 15th of the season. Two innings later, Colás added his ninth home run of the season. The two-run home run, which scored Montgomery, gave the Knights a 5-2 lead at that point.\nThe Tides, who scored on a two-run home run by Anthony Servideo in the bottom of the third inning, added a final run in the bottom of the eighth inning on an RBI single from J.D. Davis. Four Charlotte pitchers combined to hold the Tides to just three runs on seven hits. The Knights tallied 13 hits on the day.\nThe Knights will continue the six-game road series against the Norfolk Tides (Triple-A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles) on Friday night with a 6:35 p.m. game. The \"Voice of the Knights\" Matt Swierad will have the call beginning at 6:30 p.m. online at www.CharlotteKnights.com.\nCharlotte Knights Statistics\n• Discuss this story on the\nInternational League message board...\nInternational League Stories from September 5, 2024\nRed-Hot Knights Cruise Past Tides 5-3 on Thursday- Charlotte Knights Norfolk Drops Thursday Day Game To Charlotte- Norfolk Tides Rutland Little League: Girls with Game- Worcester Red Sox Noah Cameron Named International League Pitcher of the Month for August- Omaha Storm Chasers Minor League Baseball Announces August Players and Pitchers of the Month- IL Bisons OF Alan Roden Named International League Player of the Month- Buffalo Bisons Rochester Red Wings Game Notes - September 5 vs. Worcester- Rochester Red Wings Suites-N-Treats Returns to First Horizon Park on October 23- Nashville Sounds\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.",

    "text": "Le squelette presque entier d’un titanosaure découvert à Béziers par un passionné qui promenait son chien C’est arrivé lors d’une randonnée avec son chien, dans la forêt de Montouliers dans l’Hérault, il y a deux ans. Passionné par les fossiles, Damien Boschetto promenait son chien quand il est tombé sur un os. Mais pas n’importe lequel : un os de dinosaure qu’un récent éboulement avait fait sortir de la terre rouge. Au départ cependant, il ne s’affole pas sachant sa découverte un tantinet classique dans la région puisqu’on sait ici le sol riche de traces paléontologiques. Des milliers de fossiles en ont déjà été extraits. Puis c’est en creusant la terre à proximité de l’éboulement que des bénévoles passionnés par ce genre de recherches et faisant partie de [l’Association culturelle, archéologique et paléontologique (Acap)](https://musee-cruzy-acap.fr/musee-acap/a-c-a-p), ont cru halluciner : là sous leurs pieds, se trouvait en réalité le squelette presque entier d’un dinosaure. « Ce jour-là, j’ai tout de suite reconnu certains ossements, et j’ai prévenu mes collègues de l’Acap », témoigne Damien Boschetto à [20 Minutes](https://www.20minutes.fr/arts-stars/insolite/4076051-20240213-herault-baladant-chien-decouvre-os-dinosaure-vieux-70-millions-annees). « Ce n’est qu’après quelques jours de recherches, que nous nous sommes rendu compte que nous avions devant nous un squelette en connexion. Nous avons d’abord prélevé des os du bassin, puis la colonne vertébrale, puis la queue… Là, les fouilles ont pris une tout autre dimension. » Ils étaient en train de mettre à jour un titanosaure gigantesque, long de 10 mètres et haut de 4 mètres. De quoi taire la découverte dans un premier temps, pour éviter les pillages… « C’est notre bébé », a confié un bénévole, Didier Clavel à [France 3](https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/occitanie/herault/beziers/photos-10-metres-de-long-4-metres-de-haut-un-squelette-entier-de-dinosaure-sorti-de-terre-dans-l-herault-2924967.html) : « un animal complet, ça ne se trouve pas tous les jours ». Depuis deux ans donc, patiemment et assez discrètement, les bénévoles l’ont déterré, nettoyé et emmené morceau après morceau au laboratoire du musée de Cruzy. Aujourd’hui, il leur reste encore une partie de la queue à sortir de terre, et ils cherchent son crâne. C’est comme s’il était mort là et qu’il n’avait pas bougé Le titanosaure, un herbivore du Crétacé supérieur, vivait là il y a 70 millions d’années. « Le caractère exceptionnel de ce fossile, c’est qu’il est complet à 70 %, et que les os sont encore en grande partie articulés », a expliqué aux médias locaux Francis Fage, fondateur du musée de Cruzy. « C’est comme si ce dinosaure était mort là, et qu’il n’avait pas bougé. », ce qui est incroyable tant le nombre d’années, les crues et les animaux à qui il a sans doute servi de repas, estime Damien Boschetto. Désormais, le dinosaure va être étudié de près par des scientifiques et sans doute celui qui l’a découvert, Damien Boschetto. Le jeune homme, qui travaillait, jusqu’alors, dans le domaine de l’énergie, s’apprête à se lancer dans un master de paléontologie, indique 20 Minutes.",
