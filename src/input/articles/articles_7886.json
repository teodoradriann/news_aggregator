    "text": "Ukraine remains attractive for business despite war, German minister says Ivanna Kostina — Saturday, 4 May 2024, 14:17 28\nSvenja Schulze. Stock photo: Getty Images Ukraine has remained attractive as a business destination even in times of war.\nSource : Svenja Schulze, Germany's Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, in an interview with Ukrinform news agency, as reported by European Pravda\nDetails : \"Despite the current challenging situation, Ukraine remains an appealing market for many companies,\" Schulze said.\nAdvertisement: The official explained that it is still possible to run a production process in a large part of the country and that Ukraine's status as a candidate for EU membership is a \"long-term\" advantage for companies.\nThe minister cited data from the German-Ukrainian Chamber of Industry and Commerce, which indicates that about 2,000 companies with German capital were operating in Ukraine before the full-scale Russian invasion.\n\"Even after the Russian invasion, almost no companies have completely ceased operations in Ukraine. They keep their foot in the door because they know it's worth it,\" Schulze emphasised.\nHowever, Schulze noted that the private sector needs a positive investment climate and legal certainty. Therefore, Germany supports Ukraine on its reform path, especially in view of the EU accession process. The official stressed that the anti-corruption efforts are critical. She mentioned a report by Transparency International that indicated progress in this area, even though Russian aggression still rages on. This is a very positive signal for the economy, the minister stressed.\nHer ministry has been hosting the Platform for the Reconstruction of Ukraine for a year now, which seeks to engage civil society, the private sector, academia and municipalities in Germany that would like to contribute to Ukraine's recovery or are already doing so. So far, over 600 organisations have registered on the platform and are exchanging ideas.\nBackground:\nThe German Federal Government earlier approved a 15-point plan for Ukraine's economic recovery. In April, German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck pledged that German companies were ready to immediately join the rebuilding of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which was severely damaged by Russian attacks.

    "text": "An 80-year-old woman is recovering after she was run over twice by the car being driven by her husband in a Montreal hospital parking lot. Around 11:45 a.m. on Thursday, the woman and her 83-year-old husband had just come out of the CHUM (Centre hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal) hospital downtown and they were heading to their car in the hospital parking lot, Montreal police (SPVM) spokesperson Constable Sabrina Gauthier told CTV News. The woman fell before she got into the vehicle, Gauthier explained. For some reason, the driver did not wait for the woman to get inside before starting the car. \"He ran over something and realized it as he backed out of the parking spot,\" Gauthier said, \"then drove forward over the object again, not realizing until he got out of the car that it was his wife and that he had run her over twice.\" Police say the man was not intoxicated at the time and there is no criminal element being investigated. The woman was sent to the hospital in critical condition. Police confirmed later in the evening that her life is out of danger.

    "text": "Two New York City police officers helped save a man who had fallen onto the subway tracks this week -- marking their second dramatic rescue in recent months. The NYPD officers were conducting an inspection at the Carroll Street F/G subway station early Tuesday when they saw a man lose his footing and fall onto the subway tracks, police said. The officers ran toward the 55-year-old man, who was standing up but unable to get back onto the platform and was complaining of pain, body camera footage of the incident released on Wednesday shows. One officer jumped down onto the tracks to help support him while the second officer pulled the man back onto the platform, the footage shows. The second officer then helped pull his colleague back onto the platform. The entire incident took place in just under a minute, based on the body camera. \"I fell, I must have slipped off,\" the man can be heard telling the officers in the footage. EMS crews transported the man to a local hospital with reports of hip and body pain, police said. The officers were not injured in the incident. The same officers were involved in a rescue at a Brooklyn pier in October, the NYPD said. They responded to a 911 call of a person possibly in the water in Erie Basin on the evening of Oct. 3. Along with the Harbor Unit, the officers rescued a 20-year-old woman who was trapped in the water clinging onto a pier, police said. She was transported to a local hospital in stable condition.",

    "title": "Google Has Pulled The Plug On uBlock Origin",
    "text": "Google has escalated its efforts against ad blockers across its services, implementing changes to its browser extension framework.\nGoogle Chrome has recently shifted its extension support from the Manifest V2 framework to the new Manifest V3 framework. This shift represents a major change for extensions, particularly those like uBlock Origin, which have been widely used for ad-blocking purposes.\nThe move to Manifest V3 introduces stricter guidelines for extensions, specifically prohibiting the use of remotely hosted code. Google justifies this change by stating that such code “presents security risks by allowing unreviewed code to be executed in extensions.” Under the new framework, extensions are only permitted to execute JavaScript which is part of the extension package itself, a policy aimed at reducing potential vulnerabilities.\nFor the more than 30 million users of uBlock Origin on Google Chrome, this update will result in significant disruption. Soon, an automatic update will disable the tool, and while users will have the option to re-enable it through Chrome’s settings temporarily, this option will eventually be removed entirely. Users will then face a choice: either switch to a different browser or find an alternative ad blocker that complies with the new Manifest V3 framework.\nIn response to these changes, the developers of uBlock Origin have introduced a new version of their app, aptly named uBlock Origin Lite. This version is fully compliant with Manifest V3, retaining many of the core ad-blocking features of the original.\nHowever, it comes with some limitations—most notably, it lacks support for dynamic filters used for blocking scriptlet injection, a key feature in the original version. This makes uBlock Origin Lite a more constrained tool, though still effective within the confines of the new framework.",

    "text": "Dreams of the Ravaged is a short documentary film about three young survivors of super-typhoon Odette (also known as Rai), a tropical cyclone that hit the Philippines in 2021 and killed over 400 people. The film, directed by [Breech Asher Harani](https://filmfreeway.com/BreechAsherHarani88), recently won the New Scientist Editors Award at the Earth Photo 2024 competition, alongside Taylor Roades’s images of a [river in north-west Alaska that had turned orange because of global warming](/article/mg26234960-400-photos-of-a-rusting-alaskan-river-win-new-scientist-editors-award/). Harani’s film imaginatively captures the lived experience of a natural disaster through interviews, news reports and animation, exploring life on a frontline of climate change, how this affects the psyche of those living there and how that might shape people’s views of the future. “The concept of this film was inspired by my own personal experience as a survivor of super-typhoon Bopha,” says Harani of the 2012 event, also known as Pablo, that levelled his hometown in Davao De Oro. Working with the Californian government’s [mental health services oversight and accountability commission](https://mhsoac.ca.gov/) (MHSOAC), the goal of the film was to educate the public about the impacts of climate change on the mental health of those affected and tackle social, cultural and environmental issues in the southern Philippines. “I love highlighting people and communities who were never given a seat on the table when leaders and policy-makers create decisions regarding our local environment and ecosystem,” says Harani. Advertisement The winners and runners up of [Earth Photo 2024](https://www.earthphoto.world/) are on show at the Royal Geographical Society in London until 21 August. Topics:",
