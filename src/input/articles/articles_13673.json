    "text": "[Internacional](/internacional) Taça Asiática: Irão vence e garante apuramento com Taremi a titular Triunfo por 1-0 ante Hong Kong na segunda jornada Triunfo por 1-0 ante Hong Kong na segunda jornada O Irão venceu Hong Kong por 1-0 esta sexta-feira e garantiu, com uma de três jornadas por disputar, o apuramento para os oitavos de final da Taça Asiática. Com o avançado do FC Porto, Mehdi Taremi, a titular, o Irão fez o único golo do jogo aos 24 minutos. Milad Mohammadi, na esquerda do ataque, fez um passe para Mehdi Ghaedi, que recebeu, entrou na área e rematou rasteiro para fazer a bola entrar junto ao segundo poste, batendo o guarda-redes Yapp Hung Fai. Taremi saiu aos 77 minutos de um jogo que não foi fácil para o Irão garantir a vitória, com a equipa de Hong Kong, treinada pelo norueguês Jorn Andersen, a insistir pelo empate até ao fim dos sete minutos de compensação dados. Com este resultado, o Irão, treinado por Amir Ghalenoei, soma seis pontos no grupo C, para quatro dos Emirados Árabes Unidos, um da Palestina e zero de Hong Kong. Os oitavos de final jogam-se entre 28 e 31 de janeiro e apuram-se para esta fase os dois primeiros classificados de cada um dos seis grupos e os quatro melhores terceiros classificados. Com o apuramento do Irão, o FC Porto já sabe que não vai poder contar com o avançado com quase toda a certeza, no mínimo até final do mês.",

    "text": "Tech. Sgt. Dylan Jarvis, 365th Training Squadron instructor supervisor, received the Air and Space Commendation Medal for heroism on Jan. 9, 2023, here after preventing a suicide last March.\nJarvis became a hero after he noticed a woman clinging to the edge of a bridge, ran across a four-lane highway and saved her life.\n“There’s not really a thought process. I immediately started sprinting across the four-lane freeway to get to her,” said Jarvis. “She was already over the railing trying to jump into the main highway.”\n“When I got her back over the ledge, we sat down and talked about her life, kids and what was ahead for her future,” said Jarvis. Once I built that rapport, we carefully walked back across the freeway where my wife was speaking with emergency services.”\nJarvis’ selfless actions reflect who he is as a person, but also who he is as an Airman as he supervises and instructs junior enlisted Airmen.\n“I told them I want to be the change in the Air Force,” said Jarvis. “I want to make things better in the Air Force rather than just complain because I care about the people.”\nMaj. John De Laura, 365th TRS Commander, presented the medal for Jarvis' actions.\n|Date Taken:||02.21.2023|\n 14:50|\n|Story ID:||461056|\n|Location:||US|\n|Web Views:||6|\n Sheppard instructor receives Commendation Medal for heroism, by\n[A1C Katie Caroline McKee](/portfolio/1739189/katie-caroline-mckee),\nNo keywords found.",

    "text": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan, on Thursday, condemned the decision of Indian occupation authorities to declare Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarrat Alam faction) [MLJK-MA], as an “unlawful association”, for a period of five years and termed this as a blatant violation of foundational principles of the United Nations Charter.\nIn a statement, Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said that banning of the political parties and persecution of their leadership manifests a desire to stifle dissent in sheer disregard of democratic norms and international human rights and humanitarian law.\n“The people of Jammu and Kashmir have consistently rejected India’s harsh tactics aimed at consolidating its occupation. These actions blatantly violate foundational principles of the United Nations Charter, which affirm fundamental rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir including the right to self-determination,” she said.\nShe said that MLJK-MA was led by a prominent Kashmiri leader, Masarrat Alam Bhatt, who remained imprisoned for a period exceeding 20 years. The MLJK-MA is the fifth Kashmiri party banned under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).\nShe said the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, Jamaat-e-Islami Jammu and Kashmir, Dukhtaraan-e-Millat, and Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Freedom Party had already been outlawed. Their leadership is being relentlessly persecuted through prolonged detention and confiscation of properties. The office of All Parties Hurriyat Conference in Srinagar was also sealed, early this year. “India should immediately lift the curbs on the banned political parties in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK); release all the political prisoners and dissenters; and implement the UN Security Councils’ resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir,” she added.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2023\nComments\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281070/first-half-of-jan24-pol-products-prices-may-be-sustained\">First half of Jan’24: POL products’ prices may be sustained\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281041/pakistan-slams-india-for-banning-another-kahmiri-political-party\">Pakistan slams India for banning another Kahmiri political party\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281055/solar-panel-imports-pca-south-uncovers-another-money-laundering-offence\">Solar panel imports: PCA South uncovers another money laundering offence\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281058/sindh-bilawal-says-nomination-papers-not-being-snatched\">Sindh: Bilawal says nomination papers not being snatched\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281068/dozens-arrested-in-pro-palestinian-protests-at-two-major-us-airports\">Dozens arrested in pro-Palestinian protests at two major US airports\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281066/ecp-directs-punjab-govt-to-ensure-a-level-playing-field\">ECP directs Punjab govt to ensure a level playing field\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281065/ecp-accepts-nawazs-nomination-papers\">ECP accepts Nawaz’s nomination papers\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281064/army-commits-to-offering-support-for-elections\">Army commits to offering support for elections\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281063/imported-coal-based-projects-ecc-okays-settlement-of-issues-with-pqepcl\">Imported coal-based projects: ECC okays settlement of issues with PQEPCL\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281062/anti-polio-drive-pm-seeks-ulemas-help\">Anti-polio drive: PM seeks Ulema’s help\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281059/fd-outlook-misreports-fbr-collection-data\">FD Outlook misreports FBR collection data\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281057/wapda-employees-phc-suspends-notification-to-end-free-electricity\">WAPDA employees: PHC suspends notification to end free electricity\n</a>\nRead more stories Next Story",

On April 18, 1919, a special woman was born. Teresa Gagne is celebrating a huge milestone, her 105th birthday. Some lunch plans were in store with her family and then they had a party at her Waterville home. The Brunswick native grew up with nine sisters and three brothers. She walked from home to school every single day, two miles there and two miles back. Her hard work and curiosity led her to different adventures and in 1942 she sealed the deal with someone special. “I married a guy from Waterville, and we stayed in Brunswick for two years and then he couldn’t find any work over there so we moved over here,” said Gagne. They made Waterville their home and raised their three kids. Her husband was in the service, and she had a very demanding job herself, she was a weaver and started that career when she was 18 years old. She retired when she was 60. During her upbringing, finding work as a woman was difficult. “There wasn’t much work for women you know, to pick out if you weren’t educated,” said Gagne. “Yeah, I only went to grammar school.” That didn’t stop her from working hard and making a great career out of it which helped provide for her family. So, what is her secret? She said it’s staying active and staying in good health and of course having some fun here and there. “I love to gamble,” said Gagne laughingly. With all that she’s seen in this world, and all that she’s done, keeping her family and friends close are the key to her smile. Happy Birthday Teresa from WABI TV! Copyright 2024 WABI.

A solicitação feita à Procuradoria-Geral da República (PGR) é de autoria do Conselho Nacional de Direitos Humanos (CNDH) e do Conselho Nacional de Saúde (CNS).

Durante a pandemia, Bolsonaro foi na contramão da maioria dos países e de autoridades locais, apontando que medidas como o isolamento social prejudicariam a economia do país. O então presidente também fez campanha contra a vacinação. “O número exorbitante de casos e óbitos por Covid-19 notificados, sem contar aqueles que não o foram, é notoriamente o resultado da política sanitária adotada pelo governo do ex-Presidente da República Jair Messias Bolsonaro que se posicionou na contramão das orientações da comunidade científica, da OMS, e mesmo da mais singela razoabilidade, participando de forma decisiva, por atos e omissões, da propagação do vírus no território nacional, que resultou na morte de centenas de milhares de brasileiros e brasileiras”, diz trecho do documento.
