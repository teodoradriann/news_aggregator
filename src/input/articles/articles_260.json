    "title": "Cargo ferry sinks in Russian port after Ukrainian attack - Newspaper - DAWN.COM",
    "text": "MOSCOW: Ukraine sank a Russian ferry carrying fuel tanks in an aerial attack on a southern Russian port on Thursday, Russian officials said. “As a result of the damage, the ferry sank in the waters of the Kavkaz port,” in Russia’s southern Krasnodar region, just across from the annexed Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, the region’s operational headquarters said in a statement on Telegram. It had earlier reported that “a railroad ferry with fuel tanks in the Kavkaz port was attacked” and that emergency services had been dispatched. Images on social media had earlier shown a fire and plume of smoke after Russian officials reported a Ukrainian attack on the port. The Kavkaz port sits in the Kerch Strait that separates Russia from Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula it annexed in 2014. Ukrainian aerial attacks have targeted Crimea and the road and rail bridge connecting it to the Russian mainland throughout the conflict. Officials in Kyiv posted cryptic comments after the attack. “Beautiful,” Daria Zarivna, a communications adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said in a post on Telegram, attaching a photo of a large fire at the port. Speaking at an event for army veterans, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to call for his troops to step up attacks on Russian territory. Published in Dawn, August 23rd, 2024",

    "text": "Al hablar hoy en un mitin a nivel estatal para conmemorar el aniversario 75 de la fundación del Ejército Popular de Laos, que tuvo lugar en esta capital, el dirigente reiteró que el PPRL, Gobierno, Ejército y pueblo de Laos siempre recuerdan la tradición de la alianza de lucha, así como el valioso apoyo y la asistencia de las fraternales fuerzas armadas y combatientes voluntarios vietnamitas, en la lucha contra el enemigo común. La consolidación del Ejército Popular de Laos está estrechamente vinculada al desarrollo de la revolución democrática nacional de Laos, así como al movimiento revolucionario y la alianza de combate de los tres países Laos-Vietnam-Camboya, sobre el principio de equidad, apoyo mutuo y respeto de la soberanía de cada país. A partir de esta base, las fuerzas armadas de Laos coordinaron con los combatientes voluntarios de Vietnam el lanzamiento de distintas campañas y consiguieron liberar muchas regiones en todo el país. Sobresalió entre ellas la de Dien Bien Phu, resonante victoria que obligó a los colonialistas franceses a firmar el Acuerdo de Ginebra, en 1954, sobre el restablecimiento de la paz en los países de Indochina y el reconocimiento de la independencia, soberanía e integridad territorial de Laos, Vietnam y Camboya.",

    "text": "Codemasters pauses iconic rally game development after over 25 years\nCodemaster’s WRC partnership has ended\nEA’s Codemasters studio has said it will stop development on future rally games, ending a decades-long run which started with the first Colin McRae game in 1998.\nOn Wednesday, Codemasters announced that its partnership with the World Rally Championship (WRC) had ended, and that it would thus be “pausing” development plans for future rally titles.\nEA acquired Codemasters, the esteemed British studio behind the Colin McRae and Dirt rally games, in 2021.\n“Every great journey eventually finds its finish line, and today, we announce that we’ve reached the end of the road working on WRC,” Codemasters said on Wednesday.\n“After releasing EA SPORTS WRC in 2023, the 2024 season, including the recently released Hard Chargers Content pack, will be our last expansion.\n“For now, we are pausing development plans on future rally titles. Rest assured, EA SPORTS WRC will continue to be available for existing and new players. We hope it remains a source of joy, excitement, and the thrill of rally racing. We’ve poured our hearts into making it for fans, and we know you’ll keep the passion alive.\n“Our WRC partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like Colin McRae Rally, and DiRT. We’ve provided a home for every rally enthusiast, striving tirelessly to push the boundaries and deliver the exhilarating thrill of driving on the ragged edge.\n“We’ve brought together incredibly talented racing developers, worked with some of the sport’s icons, and had the opportunity to share our love of rallying.\n“Thank you to all the fans who have and continue to be part of our rally journey.”\nEarlier this week, EA reportedly announced layoffs of up to 400 workers, though it’s not clear if Codemasters was affected by these cuts.",
