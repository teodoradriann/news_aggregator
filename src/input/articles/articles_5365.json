    "text": "regne unit Un ministre ha de disculpar-se per dir que l’esposa ideal és la sedada El ministre d’Interior britànic, James Cleverly, ha hagut de demanar públicament disculpes per fer el que ell qualifica de “broma”. Va ser durant un esmorzar off the record amb periodistes quan va dir que “l’esposa ideal és aquella que està lleument sedada i no pot adonar-se que a fora hi ha millors homes”. Tot i que en principi s’havia pactat no publicar res del que es digués en l’esmorzar, el Sunday Mirror ho va fer per la gravetat de la frase. Segons hi afegeix, es va referir a l’ús del flunitrazepam o Rohypnol, que s’usen com a sedació.

    "text": "CROSS RIVER, N.Y. - On Jan. 4, the bowling teams went to Cortland Lanes for matches against Hen Hud and Briarcliff. Unfortunately, the girls hit choppy seas versus the first place Sailors and were shutout 7-0. But the boys had better luck versus the Bears. Winning four games to three, the series high scorer was glad to take the victory. “It feels really good,” said John Curtin. “We were very consistent.” His 406 series score said as much, and differentiates from last year. “I’m definitely way better,” he said. The bowler mostly credits his positioning. “I line myself up by the arrows and not in the middle,” said Curtin. That more often leaves him hitting to the left or right of the front pin, but in terms of the high game he was just behind. Connor Harty had a 167 and wasn’t worried about his low game of 97. “Bowling, it’s fun stuff,” he said. A series score of 377, Harty was just ahead of Nick Maiorana’s 370. A 157 among his game, being ahead of the curve in relation to the bowler’s hook has been a bit more random. “I’m just kind of tossing it,” said Maiorana. Good enough for the win, the good day for the boys didn’t mean a total loss for the girls. “I’d rather try my hardest versus a good team than not try so hard against a bad team,” said Kayleigh Plutzke. Unfortunately, the anticipation was good for only a third best 317 series score among her teammates. “I could do better,” she said. A new ball on the way, the Wolf sees a better fit making a difference. “My fingers keep getting stuck. That makes my arm tired and wastes a lot of energy,” Plutzke lamented. She also intends to take the new sphere round the bend. “A hooking ball,” she said, “It can hook all the way to the middle, and I think that will improve my game.” That said, the five newcomers to the girls’ team are on the upswing, according to Coach Paul Plutzke. “A lot of them were averaging in their 60s, and now they are consistently getting over 100,” he said. One of those is Lillian Silverman and she credits being in full swing. “I’m just following through,” she assured. The high series score did go to Sky Corradino (327), but in the end, no one is really counting when it comes to the camaraderie. “Everybody is fun and chill,” concluded Silverman.

    "text": "( MENAFN - AsiaNet News) The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has vehemently criticised Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's statement regarding withdrawing the hijab ban decision made during the BJP government's tenure. On Saturday, several leaders, including former chief ministers B.S. Yeddyurappa and Basavaraj Bommai, alongside BJP state president BY Vijayendra, expressed strong dissent and launched verbal attacks against Siddaramaiah.\nFormer Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa emphasized the implementation of uniforms in schools to prevent discrimination among students, countering Siddaramaiah's move to revoke the hijab ban, which he alleged was merely to appease minorities. Yeddyurappa demanded an immediate retraction of this decision.\n'Haven't done it yet': Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah clarifies on revocation of Hijab ban in state\nBasavaraj Bommai accused CM Siddaramaiah of politicizing the hijab issue to divert attention from administrative failures and for political advantage. He clarified that the hijab was not banned across the state but only in schools adhering to a specific dress code, stressing that women were free to wear the hijab where there was no such prohibition.\n'Siddaramaiah polluting education sector...' BJP slams Karnataka CM over decision to withdraw Hijab ban\nThe BJP's state president, BY Vijayendra, condemned Siddaramaiah's statement, branding it as irresponsible. He voiced disapproval of using minorities as a mere vote bank and accused the Congress party of contributing to educational disparities among minorities.\nExpressing dismay, Vijayendra highlighted the ongoing educational disparities faced by nearly 50% of minorities and attributed the responsibility for this situation to the Congress party. He criticized the alleged exploitation of children for political gains and emphasized the need to safeguard students from being embroiled in political agendas.\nMENAFN23122023007385015968ID1107652125\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

The company is back in the news, this time with an intriguing piece of design: Tiles of the Sun.\nTwo hand-painted ceramic tiles depict a solar installer standing on a roof with a photovoltaic panel hoisted on one shoulder. Tiles of the Sun, developed with creative agency 72 and Sunny, builds on a rich tradition of tiles portraying Dutch tradespeople like blacksmiths, shipwrights and carpenters, whose handiwork helped shape the nation.\nCrafted by artisans at the Harlinger Aardewerk en Tegelfabriek in the iconic blue-and-white Delft style, Tiles of the Sun pays homage to the skilled labor required for today's energy transition. By purchasing a tile for EUR 75 or more, buyers directly fund The Switch's training and certification programs for refugees looking to embark on green energy careers.\nTrend Bite\nIn November 2023, far-right populist Geert Wilders won the Netherlands' national elections after running a blatantly anti-asylum and anti-Islam campaign. The Switch, meanwhile, highlights the value refugees bring by upskilling them for a sector facing a severe labor shortage — the Netherlands is looking to fill around 50,000 job openings related to the energy transition.\nRaising funds for the endeavor with a quintessentially Dutch piece of heritage symbolizes a merging of old and new residents, of historic craft and today's technology.

    "text": "VATICAN CITY, Holy See - Pope Francis, who often pleads for compassion to prisoners, washed the feet of 12 incarcerated women in Rome on Thursday in a rite marking Holy Thursday before Easter.\nThe Argentinian Jesuit visited the Rebibbia women's prison in the northeastern outskirts of the Italian capital, where he performed the same rite in 2015.\nThursday, however, was the first time the 87-year-old pontiff had dedicated his annual ritual during Holy Week solely to women.\nSeated in a wheelchair, the pope washed the feet of each of the prisoners, some of them in tears, before drying them off with a towel and kissing them.\n\"We all have small failures, big failures,\" said the pope in an impromptu homily during a mass held in the courtyard of the prison that holds some 370 women.\n\"But the Lord is always waiting for us, with open arms, and he never tires of forgiving,\" he added.\nThe washing of feet is \"a gesture that draws our attention to the vocation of service,\" said Francis, who as a priest in Buenos Aires had already begun visiting prisoners.\nA few minutes earlier, the pontiff was all smiles as he shook hands with the inmates.\nLast month, the pope caught a flu which caused him to cancel some public meetings. During his subsequent recovery, he has on several occasions asked others to read his speeches.\nIn the Christian tradition, Holy Thursday commemorates the day when Christ washed the feet of the apostles at the Last Supper.\nIt is a highlight of Holy Week, which commemorates Christ's final days before his resurrection on Easter.\nSince becoming pope in 2013, the head of the Catholic Church has often visited prisons and refugee centers, including last year on Holy Thursday when he visited a juvenile detention center and washed the feet of 12 young men.\nOn Good Friday, he is due to preside over the \"Way of the Cross\" prayer service at Rome's Coliseum, which he was unable to attend last year as he recovered from a bronchial infection. — Agence France-Presse",
