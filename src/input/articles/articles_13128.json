    "text": "Former Major League Baseball pitcher Scott Sauerbeck has died at the age of 53 after suffering a heart attack in Bradenton, Florida, Pittsburgh Baseball Now reports.\nSauerbeck, a left-handed reliever, was drafted by the New York Mets in the 23rd round of the 1994 MLB Amateur Draft and selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1998 Rule 5 Draft after four seasons in the minors. The Cincinnati native spent five seasons with the Pirates before being traded to the Boston Red Sox midway through the 2003 season and had later stints with the Cleveland Indians and Oakland Athletics.\n“The Pirates family mourns the passing of Scott Sauerbeck,” the team wrote in a post shared on its social media accounts. “Scott played for the Bucs from 1999-2003 and shares the club record for most games pitched by a LHP in one season.\n“Our thoughts are with his family and friends during this time.\nSauerbeck finished his MLB career with a 20-17 record and a 3.82 ERA, as well as five saves and 389 strikeouts in 386.1 innings pitched and 471 games. The left-hander attempted to make a comeback with the Cincinnati Reds in 2008, signing a minor league deal but never playing for his hometown team.",

    "text": "Is a 2-Foot Tank Enough for an Arowana? A Comprehensive Guide Absolutely not. A 2-foot tank is woefully inadequate for an arowana , a majestic fish known for its impressive size and active swimming habits. Attempting to house an arowana in such a small space would be detrimental to its health, well-being, and natural behavior. Let’s dive into the reasons why and explore the appropriate tank sizes for these magnificent creatures.\nUnderstanding the Arowana’s Needs Arowanas are not your typical small aquarium fish. They are large, active predators that require ample space to thrive. Here’s a breakdown of their essential needs:\nSize Matters: Arowana Growth and Space Requirements Arowanas can grow up to 3 feet (or even larger) in captivity, and their size directly impacts their space requirements. A general rule of thumb is that the tank length should be at least three times the fish’s length , and the tank width should be no less than 1.2 times the fish’s size . This formula ensures they have enough room to swim freely and turn around comfortably.\nA 2-foot tank (24 inches) simply doesn’t provide enough length for an arowana to even reach a moderate size without being severely cramped. Confining them to such a small space will stunt their growth, stress them, and potentially lead to deformities.\nSwimming Space: The Need for Room to Roam Arowanas are active swimmers. They need plenty of open water to move around and exercise. A cramped tank restricts their natural swimming behavior, leading to lethargy, muscle atrophy, and increased aggression. Think of it like confining a dog to a small crate for its entire life; it’s simply not a suitable environment.\nWater Quality: Maintaining a Healthy Environment Larger tanks are inherently more stable in terms of water parameters. Changes in temperature, pH, and ammonia levels occur more gradually in larger volumes of water, giving you more time to react and correct any imbalances. A small tank, like a 2-foot aquarium, is much more susceptible to rapid fluctuations, which can stress the arowana and compromise its immune system.\nNatural Behavior: Providing an Enriched Environment Arowanas exhibit a range of natural behaviors, including hunting, exploring, and establishing territory. A larger tank allows you to create a more enriched environment with decorations, plants, and hiding places, which can help to stimulate their natural instincts and reduce stress. A 2-foot tank offers very limited opportunities for environmental enrichment.\nMinimum Tank Size for Arowanas: The Golden Rule The absolute minimum tank size for an adult arowana is 8 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 4 feet deep . This allows the fish to reach its full potential without being confined. Remember, bigger is always better when it comes to arowanas.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Can I start with a smaller tank and upgrade later? While you can temporarily house a juvenile arowana in a slightly smaller tank (e.g., a 4-foot tank), it’s crucial to have a plan for upgrading to a larger tank as the fish grows. Procrastinating on the upgrade can lead to serious health problems for the fish.\n2. What happens if I keep an arowana in a tank that’s too small? Keeping an arowana in a tank that’s too small can result in:\nStunted growth: The fish will not reach its full potential size. Deformities: Spinal deformities and other physical abnormalities can develop due to cramped conditions. Stress: Chronic stress can weaken the immune system and make the fish more susceptible to disease. Aggression: Arowanas may become more aggressive towards tank mates or even themselves due to frustration and lack of space. Reduced lifespan: Stress and poor health can significantly shorten the fish’s lifespan. 3. What are the ideal water parameters for arowanas? Arowanas thrive in warm, slightly acidic water. Aim for a temperature of 75-86°F (24-30°C) , a pH between 6.0 and 7.0 , and minimal levels of ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate. Regular water changes are essential to maintain optimal water quality.\n4. What do arowanas eat? Arowanas are carnivorous and require a protein-rich diet. In the wild, they feed on insects, crustaceans, and small fish. In captivity, you can feed them a variety of foods, including:\nPellets: High-quality arowana pellets should form the basis of their diet. Live foods: Offer live foods like crickets, mealworms, and feeder fish occasionally as a treat. Frozen foods: Frozen shrimp, bloodworms, and other frozen foods can provide a good source of protein. 5. How often should I feed my arowana? Feed juvenile arowanas once or twice a day, and adult arowanas once a day. Adjust the amount of food based on their appetite and growth rate.\n6. What kind of filtration system do I need for an arowana tank? Arowanas produce a lot of waste, so you’ll need a powerful filtration system to maintain water quality. A combination of mechanical, chemical, and biological filtration is ideal. Consider using a large sump filter or multiple canister filters.\n7. Do arowanas need a heater? Yes, arowanas require a heater to maintain a stable water temperature. Choose a reliable heater that is appropriately sized for your tank.\n8. Do arowanas need a lid? Yes, arowanas are known to jump, so a secure lid is essential to prevent them from escaping the tank.\n9. What are some suitable tank mates for arowanas? Choosing suitable tank mates for arowanas can be tricky due to their aggressive nature. Some potential tank mates include:\nLarge catfish: Catfish like plecos and silver dollars can coexist peacefully with arowanas. Large cichlids: Some larger cichlids, such as oscars, may be compatible, but monitor them closely for aggression. Giant gouramis: These peaceful giants can often coexist with arowanas in a large enough tank. Avoid keeping arowanas with small, slow-moving fish that they might view as prey.\n10. How long do arowanas live? With proper care, arowanas can live for 10-15 years or even longer in captivity.\n11. Are arowanas difficult to care for? Arowanas are considered to be relatively challenging fish to keep due to their size, specific needs, and potential for aggression. They are not recommended for beginner aquarists.\n12. How much does an arowana cost? The price of an arowana can vary depending on the species, size, and color. Some rare varieties can cost thousands of dollars.\n13. What is the difference between Asian arowanas and South American arowanas? Asian arowanas (Scleropages formosus) are native to Southeast Asia and are known for their vibrant colors and unique scale patterns. They are highly prized in Asian cultures and are often considered to be symbols of good luck and prosperity. South American arowanas (Osteoglossum bicirrhosum) are native to the Amazon River basin and are typically silver or gray in color. They are generally less expensive and more readily available than Asian arowanas.\n14. Can I keep an arowana in a pond? In suitable climates (tropical or subtropical), arowanas can be kept in large outdoor ponds. The pond must be deep enough to provide adequate swimming space and protected from predators. However, indoor aquariums are generally preferred for better control over water parameters and temperature.\n15. Where can I learn more about responsible aquarium keeping and fish care? There are numerous online resources and books available on responsible aquarium keeping. The Environmental Literacy Council at enviroliteracy.org is a valuable resource for understanding the environmental aspects of keeping aquatic pets, as well as the broader implications of responsible pet ownership. Always research the specific needs of any fish before bringing it home.\nConclusion: Prioritizing the Arowana’s Well-being In conclusion, a 2-foot tank is completely unsuitable for an arowana . These magnificent fish require a large, spacious environment to thrive. Providing them with the appropriate tank size, water parameters, and diet is essential for their long-term health, happiness, and well-being. Always prioritize the needs of the fish when considering keeping an arowana, and be prepared to invest the necessary time, resources, and commitment to provide them with the best possible care.",

    "title": "Democrats dominated 2023 with wins on abortion rights, labor",
    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box. Virginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office. That's a victory for Democrats. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate. That's another victory for the left. Two ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state. People are also reading… Then on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin. These electoral victories make a difference. Just look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize. Labor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts. Workers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers. Sometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans. It was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business. Leadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people. The one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job. Did the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker. The sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats. So a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories. Yes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats. Kusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action: [adaction.org](https://adaction.org/).

    "title": "Tesserent warns AI will fuel cyber threats by 2025",
    "text": "Tesserent, a cyber security firm in Australia and New Zealand, has revealed its predictions for 2025, highlighting a rise in social engineering attacks powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and an increase in attacks on critical infrastructure. Jason Plumridge, Chief Information Security Officer at Tesserent, warned, \"we will see escalating social engineering attacks, but this time powered by AI. AI will also be leveraged to step up attacks on critical infrastructure.\" This insight forms a significant part of the firm's overall forecast on how cybersecurity threats are expected to evolve.\nAI is anticipated to provide cybercriminals with enhanced tools to craft phishing emails rapidly and convincingly. Social engineering is expected to be a primary vector for attacks, with an emphasis on people-based methods rather than technology-driven approaches. Tesserent has observed this trend amongst its cybersecurity practitioners, indicating a shift in attack methodologies.\nThe deployment of AI in cyber-attacks is set to continue at a rapid pace. According to Tesserent, cybercriminals are increasing the speed and precision of their attacks, with AI-based tools becoming more accessible and affordable on the dark web. This technological advancement effectively lowers the barriers for attackers who may lack advanced technical skills.\nTesserent further predicts that AI will become increasingly integrated into data analysis, threat monitoring, and automated response strategies within organisational security programmes. This development will empower those defending against cyber threats to enhance their protective measures and retaliatory capabilities in an intensifying threat landscape.\nAustralian critical infrastructure is also expected to face a growing number of cyber-attacks, with AI playing a crucial role in these threats. AI is likely to aid cybercriminals in scripting and coding to exploit known vulnerabilities in infrastructure, making attacks easier to execute. While defending technologies such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are already utilising AI to detect threats, successful breaches often result from poor security practices and inadequate vulnerability management.\nRetaining cyber security talent remains a challenge for both the public and private sectors in Australia. Tesserent forecasts a continued struggle to hold onto skilled cybersecurity professionals amid a competitive job market. The consequence is an expected increase in outsourcing by government departments and businesses as they seek to address these talent shortages.",

    "text": "A lamp in the garage sparked a Wednesday afternoon fire that left more than $400,000 in damages to an Ashburn townhouse. Crews were called to the fire in the 43000 block of Baltusrol Terrace about 2:10 p.m., with units from Lansdowne, Ashburn, Moorefield, Kincora, and Leesburg, as well as numerous command staff responding, Loudoun County fire and rescue said in a news release. The first firefighters to arrive reported a two-story townhouse with smoke and fire showing. A \"Rapid Intervention Taskforce\" was subsequently requested to bring additional firefighters to the scene. Within 11 minutes of the initial dispatch, crews had multiple hand lines in place to control the fire and searched the entire inside of the structure to ensure no occupants were inside, the release said. No one was home, but a dog was rescued by firefighters. Crews determined there was no extension of the fire into the adjacent home. The Loudoun County Fire Marshal's Office determined the fire was accidental, caused by an unspecified electrical or mechanical event from a lamp on the workbench in the garage. Damages are estimated at $417,253. No resident or firefighter injuries were reported. The fire marshal's office reminds community members to always use caution when using extension cords. Always inspect cords for damage before use and replace if you observe any frayed or worn areas. Avoid overloading cords by plugging in only as many devices are recommended. Never run cords under carpets or rugs where damage can occur unnoticed. For additional electrical safety tips and information, visit the Electrical Safety Foundation’s website.",

    "title": "La toxicidad de los paneles solares es menos alarmante de lo que se cree: el carbón genera 850 veces más residuos",
    "text": "La creciente adopción de energía solar como fuente limpia y sostenible no está exenta de desafíos, y uno de los aspectos más debatidos es el manejo de los residuos generados por los paneles solares al final de su vida útil. Aunque estas tecnologías han demostrado ser fundamentales en la lucha contra el cambio climático, la pregunta persistente sobre el destino de los paneles retirados plantea cuestiones importantes. La vida útil típica de un panel solar oscila entre 25 y 35 años, después de los cuales los dispositivos pueden degradarse o volverse ineficientes. En la actualidad, la mayoría de los paneles solares retirados terminan en vertederos, principalmente debido al elevado costo del reciclaje y a la falta de un mercado robusto para paneles usados. Según un informe de la Agencia Internacional de Energías Renovables (IRENA) en 2016, se proyectó que los residuos fotovoltaicos acumulados en todo el mundo alcanzarían aproximadamente 60 millones de toneladas métricas para el año 2050. Esta cifra impresionante equivale al peso de 180 edificios Empire State o a la eliminación de 350.000 millones de iPhone 14. Sin embargo, un análisis más reciente realizado por investigadores del National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) ofrece una visión más optimista y contextualizada. Aunque proyectan que los residuos fotovoltaicos podrían variar entre 54 y 160 millones de toneladas métricas para 2050, destacan que esta cantidad es ínfima en comparación con otros flujos de residuos mundiales. Gestión El informe del NREL coloca los residuos de paneles solares en un contexto más amplio, señalando que durante el mismo período, el mundo tendrá que gestionar alrededor de 70.000 millones de toneladas métricas de residuos municipales, 46.000 millones de toneladas métricas de cenizas de carbón, 12.000 millones de toneladas métricas de residuos plásticos, 2.000 millones de toneladas métricas de residuos electrónicos y 249 millones de toneladas métricas de lodos aceitosos. Los residuos de paneles solares, incluso en el escenario menos favorable, son considerablemente menores en comparación con los desechos generados por otras fuentes de energía, como el carbón. El carbón podría generar hasta 850 veces más residuos que la energía solar durante el mismo período. Un aspecto crucial en el debate es la preocupación por la toxicidad de los residuos. Informes anteriores identificaron elementos peligrosos en los paneles solares, pero el NREL descubrió que el problema es mucho menor de lo que se pensaba. Prácticamente todos los paneles solares utilizan solo dos tipos de módulos fotovoltaicos, sin contener elementos como arsénico, galio, germanio, cromo hexavalente ni sustancias perfluoroalquiladas. Los riesgos para la salud y el medio ambiente asociados con los paneles solares comerciales son mínimos, limitándose a trazas de plomo en algunos paneles y un compuesto de cadmio relativamente estable en otros, representando solo el 3% del mercado global fotovoltaico. De esta manera, los investigadores del NREL hacen un llamado a la industria solar para invertir en paneles más duraderos y programas de reciclaje más eficientes. El reciclaje, argumentan, será clave para descarbonizar la cadena de suministro fotovoltaica y reducir los residuos.",
