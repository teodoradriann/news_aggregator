    "text": "$2.7 million grant to help AAA Ambulance upgrade fleet\nFrom Forrest Health System\nPINE BELT, Miss. (WDAM) - A federal grant will help AAA Ambulance Service upgrade its fleet of vehicles as well as purchase more than two dozen, mechanical, chest-compression devices.\nAAA Chief Executive Officer Chuck Carter said a $2.7 million Community Project Funding/Congressional Directed Spending grant, was sponsored by United States Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.),\nThe CDS program allows members of Congress to request federal funds be set aside for specific projects in their states.\n“We appreciate Sen. Hyde-Smith’s commitment to the people of South Mississippi in helping provide funding for this new equipment through a CDS grant,” Carter said. “This will help ensure that the patients we serve throughout our coverage area are receiving the best possible care.”\nThe grant will fund 27 “Lucas” devices, mechanical chest compression devices, which will be spread across the ambulance service’s coverage area.\nThe grant also will allow the purchase of 11, new ambulances, each with a “Power-LOAD” stretcher system.\nSeven of the ambulances have arrived, and four more are in the final stages of completion at the vendor where lettering is being added and the Power-LOAD systems are being installed.\n“Paired with the new ambulances, the LUCAS device and Power-LOAD system will help improve operational efficiency and safety,” Carter said.\nThe Power-LOAD stretcher system removes the problem of paramedics and emergency medical technicians having to lift patients multiple times when they go on a call, Carter said.\n“The only lifting they will have to do is when they move the patient to or from the stretcher,” he said. “This protects both the patient and our personnel.”\nThe Lucas device is an automated, chest-compression system that is referred to as “your partner in life support,” Carter said.\nThe device, which is positioned both under and over a patient who is in cardiac arrest, performs chest compressions in place of an actual person, delivering guideline-consistent chest compressions to sudden cardiac arrest patients. The device can be used in the field, on the move and in the hospital.\nThe Lucas device is for use as a supplement to manual Cardiopulmonary resuscitation when effective manual CPR is not possible, like during transport, extended CPR, fatigue or when there is limited personnel.\nEvery online AAA Ambulance is equipped with the device.\nHyde-Smith said the AAA project is exactly what Congress had in mind when CDS was created.\n“My goal as a senator is to work to responsibly (and) use the federal appropriations process to help Mississippi communities and organizations access resources that will help them best serve their residents,” Hyde-Smith said. “The funding for these new ambulances and equipment reflect that process, which will mean better emergency care for people in Hattiesburg and the Pine Belt.”\nFounded in 1965, AAA Ambulance is Mississippi’s first and longest-standing emergency medical services provider. AAA was the first to be licensed, provide air response, train and test paramedics and to offer SMART 911.\nAAA Ambulance Service has a staff of more than 300 people and covers Forrest, Perry, Pearl River, Marion, Jefferson Davis, Walthall and Pike counties, as well Hattiesburg city limits encased in Lamar County.\nAAA’s communications center dispatches an average of 180 ground ambulance calls on a daily basis, as well as calls for three helicopters through Southeast Mississippi Air Ambulance District.\nWant more WDAM 7 news in your inbox?

    "text": "BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - A local organization that helps people get out of jail to build a life for themselves is celebrating the retirement of their longtime director. After nearly 40 years, Dismas of Vermont is saying farewell to Richard Gagne, one of its founding leaders. “The thing that really attracted me to Dismas was that what it was trying to accomplish here was a healing of that brokenness,” Gagne said. Gagne says he came to Burlington in search of a new purpose after working at a homeless shelter in Manchester, New Hampshire. He had been in the military, taught math to high school students, and been a part of a monastery. He wanted to make a difference in peoples’ lives and in 1986 thought Dismas House was a good start. “It makes me feel lucky. That’s the bottom line for me. I feel like it’s been a privilege. I feel like I got to do something that was meaningful to me and brought me happiness,” he said. Gagne has been there ever since, providing transitional housing for formerly incarcerated people. He invites volunteers to cook family meals with people living in the house, one of five in Vermont. He estimates that about 2,000 people have been integrated back into society during that time. And he’s helped many through the transition, including Justin Adair, who now works for the organization. “I don’t know what I would have done. Would I have stayed home? Would I have been surrounded by the same people I was surrounded by beforehand? Would I have fallen as a result of that? Would I have gotten myself into more trouble? I have no idea. I can tell you I’m glad that I did come and developed relationships with Kim and Richard,” Adair said. Gagne is now focused on finding a suitable replacement to fill his shoes. He says he’s going to spend his retirement building furniture and sculpting. He says he’s grateful for the journey he’s had. “I am lucky because I know that not everybody is not that lucky. But I was,” he said. Gagne will be honored as part of a Vermont Dismas Community Celebration on Saturday, May 4 at the Elley Long Center in Colchester at 6:30 p.m. Copyright 2024 WCAX.

Creada y protagonizada por Roberto Gómez Bolaños, esta comedia mexicana ha trascendido generaciones y fronteras, conquistando el corazón de millones de espectadores.\nAlgunas personas aseguran que el éxito del Chavo del 8 radica en su humor blanco y su capacidad para tocar temas universales como la amistad, la solidaridad, la pobreza y la inocencia.

    "title": "Blood Cancer Trial Resumes Enrollment, Shows Improved Ewing Sarcoma Results",
    "text": "A phase 1/2 trial evaluating seclidemstat plus Vidaza resumed patient enrollment for those with certain blood cancers and another phase 1/2 trial demonstrated improved results in patients with Ewing sarcomas. A phase 1/2 trial evaluating the treatment combination of seclidemstat and Vidaza (azacytidine) has resumed patient enrollment for those with some blood cancers, according to biopharmaceutical company Salarius Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of seclidemstat. Seclidemstat is a novel oral drug that helps prevent the growth of cancer cells by blocking certain enzymes that are essential for cell growth. Vidaza is a drug that may help prevent some growth that may become cancer. The combination of these two drugs may increase the likelihood of destroying more cancer cells, according to the National Cancer Institute. In particular, a news release from Salarius Pharmaceuticals reported that the treatment combination of seclidemstat and Vidaza would be evaluated to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MSD) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a rare form of blood cancer. The respective phase 1/2 trial’s primary objectives include determining the safety and tolerability of the drug combination, as well as establishing the maximum dose that can be tolerated by patients. The researchers also aim to evaluate the overall response rate (ORR; percentage of patients who have a partial or complete response to treatment) after receiving the drug combination, ClinicalTrial.gov stated on the trial’s listing. Secondary objectives for the trial also include analyzing the overall survival (OS; length of time from diagnosis or the start of treatment when a patient is still alive) and duration of response (DOR; length of time when a tumor continues responding to treatment without growth). Other secondary objectives in the trial are relapse-free survival (RFS; length of time after primary treatment when a patient lives without signs of cancer), leukemia-free survival and safety. According to the same listing from ClinicalTrials.gov, the estimated enrollment is expected to be 44 patients with either MDS or CMML. The estimated date of completion for the study is September 2025. The trial, being conducted at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, was put on a partial pause by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2022 after there was a suspected unexpected serious side effect, according to the news release. More specifically, the news release stated that the serious side effect was observed only in patients with FET-rearranged sarcoma who were receiving seclidemstat. “We are pleased that the FDA has removed the partial clinical hold on the MD Anderson trial with seclidemstat in blood cancers, and we are excited about the prospect of MD Anderson enrolling additional patients and building a broader database of patient data,” David Arthur, president and chief executive officer of Salarius Pharmaceuticals, said in the news release. “(MD Anderson Cancer Center) researchers previously reported what we believe are encouraging interim results, and we look forward to learning what potential benefits patients will experience at higher doses of seclidemstat.” Another phase 1/2 trial from Salarius analyzing seclidemstat in approximately 50 patients with Ewing sarcomas, a type of cancer occurring in the bones and soft tissue, reported that a patient demonstrated a partial response after receiving a treatment combination of Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide) and Hycamtin (topotecan) according to the ClinicalTrials.gov listing. The news release noted that the partial response to treatment has led to a 60% objective response rate (percentage of patients who have a partial or complete response to treatment) and a 60% disease control rate (percentage of patients with a partial or complete response, or stable disease after treatment). “We are also pleased to see that patients continuing treatment with seclidemstat and (Cytoxan and Hycamtin) continue to improve. With our Food and Drug Administration Type B meeting process completed, we plan to file an amended Ewing protocol focusing on first relapse patients, who we believe will benefit from Seclidemstat and (Cytoxan and Hycamtin) combination therapy,“ Arthur added.
