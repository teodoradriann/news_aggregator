And with the birth of my child, the rebirth of my career is going to happen too.”\nAshley revealed she was engaged to Brandon in July 2023 when she showed off her massive diamond ring, which was estimated to have cost $800,000, on her Instagram Stories.\nShe said in the post Brandon was her “best friend”, adding: “I love you.”\nThe couple secretly married last autumn, with Ashley’s mum revealing they had got hitched by sharing photos online of the couple’s wedding bands.\nIt’s unclear when Ashley and Brandon started dating, but People reported in February 2023 they had “a lot of mutual friends” and got along because they are “both super fun and very social people”.\nThe couple’s romance made headlines after the end of Ashley’s long-term relationships with rapper G-Eazy, 34, and 31-year-old model Cara Delevingne.\nShe initially kept the relationship with Brandon secret and insisted she prefers a “private” love life.\nAshley told Cosmopolitan in 2021: “It’s more sacred that way.

    "text": "本报讯（记者 韩沛 通讯员 黄诗谊）昨日，记者从自治区住房和城乡建设厅获悉，广西工程建设项目审批管理系统（以下简称“工改系统3.0”）已上线运行满3个月，全区通过该系统累计审批工程建设项目3251个，涉及单体总数6682个，审批事项精简超40%、审批时间压缩超70%，企业满意度达100%，助力广西工程建设项目审批制度改革工作在数字化建设方面迈出了重要一步。\n　　据悉，工改系统3.0的推出，扭转了此前全区14个设区市系统分散建设、标准不一的局面。新系统整合立项用地规划、工程建设许可、施工许可、竣工验收4个阶段76项主要审批事项，实现“统一受理、并联审批、实时流转、跟踪督办、信息共享”，彻底解决“多头跑、重复交”的难题。\n　　该系统上线后，一般社会投资类项目报建审批时间由最初的120多个工作日压缩至35个工作日以内，政府投资类项目报建审批时间由最初的200多个工作日压缩至40个工作日以内。下一步，广西将以工改系统3.0为依托，大力推进审批标准化规范化，持续提升审批便利度，进一步优化网上审批服务能力，不断提升企业获得感，为打造全国营商环境标杆注入新动能。",

    "text": "4Nce8g3jSlB finance.huanqiu.com article 上半年香港新股融资141亿美元，全球第一 /e3pmh1hmp/e3pmh1iab 【环球网财经综合报道】香港交易所7月23日发布的报告显示，香港在2025年上半年以141亿美元的新股融资金额，雄踞全球首位，同比猛增695%，远超全球8%的平均增幅，展现出强劲的市场活力和吸引力。\n报告指出，投资者情绪的显著回暖，叠加大量优质公司选择通过香港市场筹集资金，是推动香港股权融资市场大幅增长的关键。国际投资者及中国内地投资者对港股的热情高涨，不仅带动恒生指数上半年上涨超20%，也使港股平均每日成交金额同比增长82%至2400亿港元。\n2025年上半年，香港新股发行规模实现了爆发式增长。据Dealogic统计，141亿美元的新融资额已超过2022年、2023年及2024年全年的水平。工业、消费、医疗保健、TMT（科技、媒体及电讯）、金融等各行业公司纷纷来港上市，其中大型新股的上市更是起到了强大的带动作用。\n2025年5月20日，宁德时代以53亿美元的集资额登陆港股，成为2023年以来全球最大规模的新股。随后，恒瑞医药、海天味业和三花智控等三只融资额均超10亿美元的大型新股也相继亮相。这四家公司中，有三家还行使了超额配售权扩大发行规模，上市后股价表现稳健，平均上涨约14%。在上半年全球十大新股发行中，香港市场独占四席。\n“A+H”上市机制持续活跃，今年上半年共有8家A股公司赴港上市，总集资额达101亿美元，多出于拓展国际布局的考虑。值得注意的是，这些公司上市后，其H股相对于A股的折价幅度普遍收窄，宁德时代H股甚至出现溢价，反映出国际投资者需求的强劲。同时，国际发行人如IFBH、觅瑞集团等也积极选择香港作为上市地，进一步巩固了香港作为国际融资中心的地位。\n市场参与度方面，无论是基石投资、机构配售，还是散户认购，均表现踊跃，部分新股录得超额认购。医疗健康、TMT、消费及新能源行业表现尤为突出。医疗健康板块股权融资总额达58亿美元，创2021年以来上半年新高；TMT行业在人工智能热潮带动下融资总额达137亿美元；消费行业新股上市后股价平均上涨70%，表现亮眼。\n香港交易所也持续优化市场环境，推出“科企专线”便利特专科技及生物科技公司上市。报告显示，7月以来香港新股市场延续强劲势头，前两周已有8家公司成功上市，等候上市的公司依然众多。\n香港交易所表示，这些积极因素共同作用，进一步巩固了香港作为全球领先新股融资中心的地位，未来市场前景可期。（文馨）",
