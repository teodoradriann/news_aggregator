    "title": "Here’s how to see Leanne Morgan live on tour in 2024",
    "text": "One of comedy’s biggest up-and-coming stars is 58-years-old. Leanne Morgan , a mother of three and grandmother to two, released her first Netflix special last year and is now embarking on the second leg of her nationwide ‘Just Getting Started Tour.’ Along the way, she’ll perform back-to-back headlining spots at Buffalo, NY’s UB Center For The Arts on Saturday, March 16 and then a week later, she’ll drop into Red Bank, NJ’s Hackensack Meridian Health Theatre for a pair of shows on Saturday, March 23. “I’ll be sharing more stories of my real life, my family and my experiences and I hope people will still come away from this new hour saying, ‘this is my life- is Leanne spying on me?,’” said Morgan in a statement. If that sounds like the show for you, it isn’t too late to grab tickets to see Morgan at one of her 48 gigs from January through June. You won’t have to spend that much either. At the time of publication, the lowest price we found on tickets was $40 before fees on Vivid Seats. Most other shows had seats starting anywhere from $45 to $70 before fees although there were a few outliers where tickets prices began over $100. Looking for a few more details before smashing that buy button ? We’re here to help, Leanne fans. Our team has everything you need to know and more about the ‘Just Getting Started Tour’ below. All prices listed above are subject to fluctuation. As noted above, Morgan has a whopping 48 shows lined up this year. That includes stops in major markets like Las Vegas (Feb. 2), Cleveland (March 15), Greensboro (April 4-5), Baltimore (May 18) and Detroit (June 22). Also, she’s slated to headline at the second-ever Netflix is a Joke Festival in Los Angeles on May 4. Wondering if she’s headed to a city near you? You can find a complete calendar including all ‘Just Getting Started Tour’ dates, venues and links to the cheapest tickets available here . From May 1-12, 2024, the Netflix is a Joke Festival is returning to Los Angeles for over 300 (!) shows spread out across 35 venues.

    "text": "Receta de panettone casero: uno de los postres estrella de la Navidad y la mejor manera de terminar 2023\nSi estás buscando una manera especial de terminar el año, ¿por qué no probar a cocinar tu propio panettone? Este delicioso pan dulce italiano es perfecto para celebrar las fiestas, y es una actividad divertida y gratificante que puedes compartir con amigos y familiares.\n¿Cómo preparar un panettone?\nPreparar un panettone no es tan difícil como parece. Con un poco de planificación y práctica, puedes crear un panettone delicioso y esponjoso que todos adorarán.\nCon o sin chocolate, con fruta escarchada o sin ella, acompañado de un humeante chocolate o un café, o para 'pecar' entre horas aprovechando que estamos en Navidad, el panettone -uno de los dulces más populares de Italia- ya forma parte de nuestra gastronomía y, es innegabe, ¡es un capricho para el paladar!\nY aunque es perfecto para sorprender a nuestros invitados en Nochevieja, Año Nuevo o Reyes como alternativa al roscón, no es un bizcocho sencillo de preparar. Por ello, de la mano de Pazo de Vilane, te contamos una sencilla versión para principantes de este delicioso postre, así la como algunos trucos para hornear el mejor panettone y que quede tierno y delicioso.\nTips para conseguir el panettone perfecto\n- Escoge una buena harina de fuerza. Y es que, en el caso del panettone, una de las claves del éxito es escoger una buena harina de fuerza. Si dudas, nuestra recomendación es preguntar en una panadería de confianza para que te aconsejen la mejor.\n- El reposo de la masa, siempre en el horno. El sitio perfecto para dejar reposando la masa del panettone es el horno. Y recuerda, tapado, pero no encendido ni caliente. Allí la masa estará a salvo de corrientes o de la excesiva humedad o sequedad del ambiente.\n- Horneado de 45 minutos a 180º. El tiempo aproximado de horneado de este panettone son 45 minutos a 180º. Aunque, dependiendo del horno, puede que a partir de la media hora ya empiece a estar dorado en la superficie. Si es así, abre la puerta del horno, coloca rápidamente una hoja de papel de aluminio encima y continúa a la misma temperatura el cuarto de hora restante.\n- Boca abajo y con palillos. El truco definitivo para que el panettone quede perfecto es pinchar en su base unos palillos largos, como los de brocheta, y colgarlo boca abajo hasta que se enfríe por completo. Para ello, se pueden usar dos botes de alimentos.\nReceta del panettone para principiantes\nIngredientes\nPara el fermento:\n- 125 g de harina de fuerza\n- 4 g de levadura fresca\n- 125 g de leche\nPara la masa:\n- 260 g de harina de fuerza\n- 4 g de levadura fresca\n- una cucharilla de café de sal\n- 80 g de azúcar blanca\n- 1 cucharada de miel\n- 110 g de mantequilla a punto pomada\n- 1 cucharada de esencia de vainilla\n- 1 huevo campero\n- 1 yema\n- 50 g de leche templada\n- 2 cucharadas de ron\n- La ralladura de una naranja (sin la parte blanca)\n- La ralladura de un limón (sin la parte blanca)\n- Media taza de chispas de chocolate\n- Media taza de uvas pasas hidratadas en ron\nPara el ganache de chocolate:\n- 1 tableta de chocolate negro (70% cacao)\n- 80 g mantequilla\n- Tres cuartos de un vaso de leche evaporada\nPreparación\n- En un robot de cocina coloca todos los ingredientes del fermento y mezcla a velocidad baja durante 20 segundos.\n- Saca la masa, que habrá quedado bastante pegajosa, y llévala a un cuenco de cristal. A continuación, cúbrela con un paño limpio de algodón y deja que repose durante 3 horas en el horno, que no estará encendido.\n- Transcurrido este tiempo, el fermento habrá triplicado su tamaño. Llévalo de nuevo al robot de cocina (limpio y bien seco) y añade los ingredientes de la masa: la harina, la levadura, el azúcar, las ralladuras de limón y naranja, la leche, el ron, la esencia de vainilla, el huevo y la yema.\n- Mezcla a velocidad baja durante 25 segundos hasta formar la masa. Luego, selecciona un programa de amasado y deja que trabaje durante 15 minutos.\n- Una vez transcurran los primeros 8 minutos de amasado (pero sin parar la máquina) añade muy poco a poco la mantequilla a punto de pomada y la pizca de sal. Cuando sólo quede un minuto, incorpora las uvas pasas y las chispas de chocolate.\n- A continuación, coloca la masa en un molde apto para panettone y déjalo levar en el horno durante 6 horas, como mínimo. Irá subiendo poco a poco, e incluso llegará a sobresalir del molde. Recuerda que en ese proceso el horno estará apagado.\n- Precalienta el horno a 180º y hornea durante 45 minutos. Vigila si se tuesta demasiado. Cuando esté listo, apaga el horno y deja que se enfríe un poco con la puerta entreabierta. Luego, sácalo, pincha la base con palitos largos de brocheta y cuélgalo boca abajo como indicábamos más arriba.\n- Si te gusta con una cobertura de ganache, pon a calentar el chocolate al baño María. Una vez esté derretido incorpora la mantequilla y remueve, hasta que se integre.\n- Finalmente, añade la leche evaporada y continúa removiendo hasta que esté brillante. Vierte sobre el panettone y sírvelo en una bonita fuente.",

A third man came around from the passenger side to try to finish him off after the first two men fired through the window. As the driver hit the gas to get away, the three men ran away from the car. The man drove 2.5 miles away to a police station, the 103rd Precinct station house.\n🔴BREAKING NEWS LAST Night\nShocking video shows the moment three gunmen ambushed a vehicle in Queens Tuesday night, killing a woman in the front passenger seat and wounding the driver.\nClarisa Burgos 28 was shot once in the head and died on the spot, police said.\nNyc is going…\n[pic.twitter.com/upGyElPa8P]\n— Wilsonxdi (@wilsonxdi)\n[December 28, 2023]\nThe driver caught six bullets in the torso and was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center by paramedics, where he was listed in stable condition.
