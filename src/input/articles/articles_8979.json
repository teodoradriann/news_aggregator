    "text": "Extended footage filmed by an MTV crew in Londonderry on the day journalist Lyra McKee was shot has been played at her murder trial.Ms McKee, 29, died after being hit by a bullet as she stood close to police vehicles while observing rioting in the Creggan area of Derry on April 18 2019.The New IRA claimed responsibility for the author’s death.Peter Cavanagh, 35, of Mary Street, Derry; Jordan Gareth Devine, 23, of Bishop Street, Derry; and Paul McIntyre, 56, of Kells Walk, Derry, are on trial at Belfast Crown Court charged with her murder.After a week-long break in proceedings, the non-jury trial resumed on Thursday.Most of the day was taken up playing lengthy segments of unedited footage filmed by the MTV crew on the day of the shooting.Presenter Reggie Yates and the camera crew were making a film about republicans opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process in the period leading up to traditional republican commemorations in the city to mark the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule in Dublin.Seven other men are on trial on a number of charges, including rioting and throwing petrol bombs.They are: Joseph Patrick Barr, 36, of Sandringham Drive, Derry; Jude Forest Coffey, 26, of Gartan Square, Derry; William Patrick Elliott, 57, of Ballymagowan Gardens, Derry; Joseph Anthony Campbell, 23, of Gosheden Cottages, Derry; Patrick Anthony Gallagher, 32, of John Field Place, Derry; Christopher Joseph Gillen, 43, of Balbane Pass, Derry; and Kieran George McCool, 55, of Ballymagowan Gardens, Derry.Several of the defendants in the case were filmed by the MTV crew in the hours prior to the shooting, some of them engaging in lengthy interviews with Yates.A prosecution barrister has already claimed the rioting that erupted in the Creggan area prior to the murder was orchestrated to “put on a show” for the camera crew.The trial, which is being heard by Judge Patricia Smyth, continues.Want a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories?

    "text": "Why New Zealand is Embracing AI Mattresses for Better Sleep Health The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into everyday items has grown rapidly, and one area where it’s making a significant impact is in sleep technology. In New Zealand, people are increasingly turning to advanced AI mattresses that help optimize their sleep. The rising popularity of AI-powered mattresses stems from their ability to track, analyze, and improve sleep quality, offering numerous health benefits to users. Brands like [heka sleep](https://hekasleep.co.nz/) have quickly gained traction by providing mattresses that use AI to monitor sleep patterns and adjust settings in real-time, enhancing comfort and promoting better rest. To learn more about these innovative solutions, you can explore options from hekasleep and experience the future of sleep. Understanding the Technology Behind AI Mattresses AI mattresses use a combination of sensors and algorithms to gather and process data about the user’s sleep patterns. These mattresses are designed to monitor factors such as body temperature, pressure points, and even breathing and heart rate. By analyzing this data, the AI adjusts the mattress’s firmness, temperature, and other settings to ensure a comfortable and supportive sleep environment. For instance, if someone is experiencing disrupted sleep due to overheating, the AI can automatically cool the mattress. Likewise, if pressure points develop, the mattress can adjust its firmness to relieve discomfort. This technology allows the mattress to cater to individual sleep needs and adapt to changes in real-time, making it a highly personalized sleeping experience. In New Zealand, where sleep quality is a growing concern, AI mattresses provide a much-needed solution for those looking to improve their rest and overall health. Benefits of AI Mattresses for Sleep Health AI mattresses offer several benefits that contribute to better sleep health. One of the key advantages is the ability to achieve consistent, high-quality sleep. Studies have shown that regular, restful sleep is essential for physical and mental well-being. By using an AI mattress, users can enjoy a more stable sleep pattern, free from interruptions that are often caused by uncomfortable sleeping conditions. In addition, AI mattresses can help reduce chronic pain associated with improper sleep postures. By analyzing the user’s sleep positions and making adjustments as needed, these mattresses prevent strain on pressure points, reducing the risk of discomfort upon waking. As a result, individuals who use AI mattresses often report fewer aches and pains, making them an ideal choice for those with specific sleep-related issues. Why New Zealanders Are Turning to AI Mattresses New Zealand has seen a growing awareness of the importance of sleep health, particularly in light of recent studies linking poor sleep quality to various health conditions. New Zealanders are increasingly seeking solutions that go beyond conventional mattresses, opting for high-tech options that can improve their sleep in measurable ways. AI mattresses provide this advantage, offering real-time data and adjustments that help users achieve deeper, more restorative sleep. With the added benefit of health-tracking capabilities, these mattresses allow users to monitor their sleep quality and make informed decisions about their sleep hygiene. For New Zealanders with busy lifestyles or those dealing with sleep disorders, AI mattresses represent a proactive approach to health and wellness, helping them take control of their sleep health in a way that traditional mattresses cannot. A Step Toward the Future of Sleep As New Zealand embraces this shift toward AI-enhanced sleep, the future of sleep health looks promising. The data-driven insights provided by these mattresses have the potential to transform how individuals approach their nightly rest, making sleep health a priority. Companies like heka sleep are at the forefront of this change, providing accessible and innovative AI mattresses tailored to meet the unique needs of each sleeper. New Zealand’s adoption of AI mattresses reflects a broader trend in prioritizing health and wellness through technology. With the advantages of improved sleep quality, personalized comfort, and real-time health tracking, it’s no surprise that AI mattresses are becoming a popular choice. To explore the benefits of AI mattresses and take a step towards better sleep health, consider the advanced options offered by hekasleep, where technology meets comfort for an optimal night’s rest.",
