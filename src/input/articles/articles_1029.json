    "text": "Mauritius lifts maximum cyclone alert\nMauritius lifted its maximum cyclone alert on Tuesday after assessing the impact of tropical storm Belal on the Indian Ocean island.\nThe storm claimed one life, left thousands without power, and caused widespread traffic disruption.\nThe Mauritius Meteorological Services (MMS) replaced the alert with a “safety bulletin” following the earlier elevation to the maximum level four alert.\nPreviously, the government had imposed an indoor stay order on Monday, which was later eased by the MMS, advising people to exercise caution and seek safe places.\nThe National Emergency Operations Command warned of winds up to 80 km/h and waves of seven meters, heightening flood risks in low-altitude regions.\nPrime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth criticized the meteorological agency for inadequate predictions, expressing surprise at the lack of anticipation for heavy rains.\nThe MMS director resigned following the incident.\nCyclone Belal had previously impacted the French overseas territory of Reunion, causing one fatality.",

    "text": "During the 1920’s and 1930’s, Political Anti-Semitism became widespread from Eastern Europe to Great Britain and the USA. While some Jews reacted to this by joining far left wing political organizations, more Jews reacted by joining Jewish organizations and synagogues.\nAlso the first two decades of the 21st century saw a major rise in the number of people in the USA who describe their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular,” which now stands at 26% of the total American population, up an amazing nine points from 17% in 2009.\nHowever, something similar seems to be happening now, especially among the tens of thousands of young Jewish parents who are married to non-Jews. About 42% of married Jews have a spouse who is not Jewish. Among American Jews who have gotten married since 2010, that percentage rises to 61%.\nYet Introduction to Judaism classes have reported major increases in students. In the UK the Liberal Jewish movement is experiencing a surge in conversions to Judaism. Liberal Judaism reports that 139 people registered to go through its conversion process in 2021. The number is double the 2019 total of 70 and a significant rise on the 93 registering in 2020. About half had some Jewish ancestry, half none at all.\nThe same doubling is found in Los Angeles where Benjamin Wright, the Associate Director of the Conservative Movement Introduction to Judaism Program told me that the annual number of conversions in the 10-years pre-pandemic averaged 300; and rose to 650 for the year (July 2022-June 2023).\nDebra Nussbaum Cohen writes in the Forward newspaper (8/3/24) about interviewing Rev. Ana Levy-Lyons, a Unitarian Universalist minister in Brooklyn, about how the Hamas attack on Israel changed her life.\nIt led Levy-Lyons to quit her role as spiritual leader of the First Unitarian Congregational Society after a dozen successful years there, and to quit the ministry and her association with Unitarianism altogether. She’s now focusing on studying to become a rabbi.\nLevy-Lyons is Jewish, something she discovered only in her 20s, when a cousin let the family secret slip. It was something her parents had worked hard to deny. Her father had changed the family’s last name. Her family lived as many do, as American atheists.\nLeaving Unitarianism is a big step; her adult life has been bound to Unitarianism since she was ordained a minister in 2007. Levy-Lyons met her husband, Jeff Lyons, when she was interning in her first pulpit, and he was on that congregation’s board. They bonded over their shared Jewish heritage, which neither, at the time, was involved with. It was when they married, also in 2007, that she reclaimed her family’s original and unmistakably Jewish last name: Levy.\nLevy-Lyons is soft-spoken in person. But on the pulpit at the Brooklyn Heights congregation, when she gave well-written sermons that doubled as social commentary (I attended a few), she was a powerful figure.\nMany rabbis have struggled with how to navigate the strong — at times conflicting — views of their congregants about the war in Gaza. But for Levy-Lyons, it has been a life-changing crisis.\nAfter the war began, members of her left-leaning Unitarian congregation pressed her to issue a statement condemning Israel without qualification for the deaths in Gaza caused by its war against Hamas.\nShe just couldn’t do it, she said in an interview. As a Jew, she sees the war in a more nuanced way than many of her congregants, she said. She also found herself suddenly feeling isolated from the progressive left, of which she has long counted herself a part.\nThe terrorist attack and ensuing war forced a reckoning with her long-muted Jewish identity. To her surprise, she found herself dealing with internalized Jewish trauma.\n“It’s ironic,” she said, “given that my entire life I didn’t think antisemitism was a thing in this country anymore. I never really got it. Then Oct. 7 happened. It was the reaction from the progressive left in this country that has been startling and terrifying,” she said. “Suddenly, I just started to only feel safe around Jews. I sense that people have some suspicion of me because I’m Jewish, and people wonder if I’m the ‘right’ kind of Jew or the ‘wrong’ kind of Jew,” she said.\nThings took a turn on March 22, when Levy-Lyons sent her congregation of 1,200 adults a letter about the war. “That was Purim weekend, and it was my Esther moment, coming out as Jewish in a way I hadn’t before,” she said, referencing the Biblical Queen Esther who, at first, hid her Jewish identity. About 10 percent of members of her congregation have Jewish background and are married to non-Jews, she said.\nIn her letter she wrote: “When I found out that I was Jewish in my 20s, it felt like an unalloyed gift. I was heir to this gorgeous tradition of spiritual practices, rituals, music, and texts, dazzling in their breadth and depth. I believed that antisemitism was mostly a thing of the past, oddly unaware of how it had quite literally shaped my entire life.\nBut on October 7, 2023 my people were slaughtered again — some of them peace activists and environmentalists, parents and children, Jews very much like me and my family except that the vagaries of history and fate had landed them there instead of here. I am two degrees of separation from people who were murdered or taken hostage on that day. Over the months since, I have discovered that I am Jewish for the second time. I have realized that I am heir, not only to the beauty of the lineage, but also to the trauma.”\nThe letter took congregants by surprise, said Robin Bossert, an immediate past co-president of First U. Bossert, whose mother was Jewish, had followed Levy-Lyons from her first New York City Unitarian Universalist pulpit, at All Souls NYC on the Upper East Side, where she was assistant minister.\nTwo weeks after sending her letter, Levy-Lyons sent another to her congregants on April 12. In it, she resigned.\n“She was beloved by most of the congregation, and people are shocked,” Bossert said. “We are in mourning.”\nWhile some of her congregants were aware that she was Jewish, none realized that it was her central identity, or that she was in rabbinical school, Bossert said.\nShe had written into her contract with the congregation (which, like many Unitarian Universalist congregations, does not like to be called a church) that she would get Saturdays off, except in the case of a death or wedding at First U.\nShe and her family are Sabbath observant, she said, and active members of Romemu, the Jewish Renewal congregation on Manhattan’s Upper West Side.\nUnitarian Universalism is numerically shrinking, according to data compiled by the Unitarian Universalist Association. The denomination is about half the size it was in 1990, when it had nearly 114,000 members. In 2008 it was 54,000. According to the Pew Research Center, UUs comprise just one percent of Americans. Jews account for 1.9 percent. Christians are nearly 71 percent.\nThe views of progressives, including at First U, is that “if you are not calling for a ceasefire you are complicit with genocide,” she said. “Either you are for Palestinian liberation and condemning Israel, or on the side of white supremacy and imperialism, colonialism and genocide.”\n“I don’t believe these are the only two options,” Levy-Lyons said. “But I felt my congregants viewing me that way. The progressive left is speaking with intense moral authority, and I feel the collective pressure of it. I was suddenly being seen as part of the problem.”\nUnitarian Universalist ministers with Jewish backgrounds are not unheard of. But Levy-Lyons appears to be the only one (so far) who decided to leave because of the war in Gaza.\nNow that she has left First U, Levy-Lyons is focusing on two projects — in addition to, with her husband, raising their 13-year-old twins.\nAnd she has been in rabbinical school, albeit until now on a very part-time basis. Levy-Lyons enrolled in the Aleph ordination program of the Jewish Renewal movement a few years ago, but had time while working as a full-time minister to take only one course each semester.\nNow that she is free of those responsibilities — her last day at First U was June 31 — she is taking four classes a semester. It’s an effort “to hopefully make faster progress,” she said with a laugh.\nAccording to a 2008 Pew survey, one in five Christians in America believe that non-Christian faiths cannot lead one to salvation. That number soared to 60 percent for white evangelical Protestants who attend church once a week.\nBut a survey of over 35,000 Americans in 2008 found that most Americans agree with the statement: many religions – not just their own – can lead to eternal life. Among those affiliated with some religious tradition, seven-in-ten say many religions can lead to eternal life.\nThis view is shared by a majority of adherents in nearly all religious traditions, including 82% of Jews, 79% of Catholics, 57% of evangelical Protestants and 56% of Muslims. (U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, 2008, Pew Research Center.)\nThus, in 21st century USA most Christians, Jews, and Muslims have rejected the ‘only one truth’ religious mind set and believe in the Qur’an’s pluralism teachings: “For every one of you did We appoint a law and a way. If Allah had wanted, He could have made you one people-nation, but (He didn’t) that He might test you in what He gave you. Therefore compete with one another to hasten to do virtuous deeds; for all return to Allah (for judgement), so He will let you know [about] that in which you differed.” [5:48]\nNon-Orthodox Judaism welcomes all non-Jews who desire to become Jewish; even From Reverend To Rabbi.",

    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif. (KGO) -- A Santa Clara County Superior Court judge on Wednesday ruled with the VTA and issued an injunction to end the union workers strike and bring back bus and light rail services.\nVTA argued the work stoppage violated a \"no strike\" clause in its last contract.\nThe ATU Local 265 said the contract expired.\nVTA says employees need to return to work \"immediately,\" but they are not sure how soon service will resume.\nThe president of ATU Local 265 says he's not sure if the injunction will get union members to return to work.\nThis is a breaking news update. Previous story follows.\nThe weeks-long VTA strike is heading to court Wednesday where a judge will decide the fate of the transit agency and its striking workers.\nWe spoke with principal attorney Adam Juratovac on what the judge will decide.\n\"Is whether the judge is going to allow the ATU to continue their strike, or if the judge is going to rule in favor the VTA and the collective bargaining agreement and stop the strike where it is,\" Juratovac said.\nVTA says their contract with the union is very clear. \"ATU agreed to a 'no strike' clause.\"\nRELATED: VTA strike continues for 3rd week after union votes down latest proposal\nIn their complaint, their no-strike language stated:\n\"The term of this Agreement shall begin on March 7, 2022, and continues through March 3, 2025, and from year to year thereafter.\"\nBut the union argues that's contradictory.\nThey say a memo and statements were made in the media by the VTA that their contract had expired.\nPolitical science professor Robert Ovetz teaches labor relations at San Jose State University.\nMORE: VTA workers injured in traffic incident on 1st day of strike that shut down bus, light rail service\n\"We don't really have a lot of recent history where courts have stepped in and stopped a strike. In my perspective on this, is that it would be best for both parties to get back to the bargaining table and come to an agreement,\" Ovetz said.\nSo how did we get here?\nOn March 10, the union representing bus drivers, and other workers went on strike halting bus and light rail services across Silicon Valley.\nOn March 11, the VTA filed a legal complaint to Santa Clara County Superior Court.\nMORE: Unhoused South Bay commuters impacted tremendously from ongoing VTA strike\n\"They filed an emergency motion saying you guys - the court - please stop this strike right now or else we'll be irreparably harmed and the court refused to do that,\" Juratovac said.\nJuratovac said even though these parties will meet in court on Wednesday, we shouldn't expect to see a decision.\n\"I guarantee there is going to be some good points made during tomorrow's hearing. The judge and his clerks are going to be looking into those issues, looking into this case and make the best decision they possible can,\" Juratovac said.\nThe two sides go to court in a Santa Clara County Superior Courtroom Wednesday at 1:30 p.m.\nRELATED: VTA, union hope Gov.

    "text": "CHILPANCINGO.- Por violaciones a los derechos de niños a una vida sin violencia, el gobierno de Guerrero anunció que presentará una denuncia penal en contra de los integrantes de la Coordinadora Regional de Autoridades Comunitarias Pueblos Fundadores (CRAC-PF) tras haber armado a un grupo de niños en la comunidad de Ayahualtempa, municipio de José Joaquín Herrera. Este miércoles, La Silla Rota informó que en la comunidad del municipio de José Joaquín de Herrera, pobladores decidieron armar a niños y niñas de entre 11 a 15 años de edad, con el objetivo de cuidar a su comunidad ante la inseguridad que vive Guerrero actualmente. En tanto un grupo de adultos se encuentra buscando a una familia desaparecida desde el pasado 19 de enero. \"Nosotros vamos a presentar las denuncias correspondientes porque nadie puede atentar contra los derechos de los niños, armar a los niños no es una estrategia adecuada\", declaró el secretario General de Gobierno de Guerrero, Ludwing Marcial Reynoso Núñez. Te podría interesar \"A mí me parece que estas personas (los de la CRAC-PF) se han equivocado, haremos las denuncias y se tendrán que tomar las medidas necesarias\". Para el gobierno de Guerrero, la presentación de los niños armados fue un tema mediático. \"Pero nosotros, como autoridad, no podemos permitir que eso siga sucediendo\". Aunque Reynoso Núñez reconoció que el tema de seguridad es obligación que debe de garantizar el gobierno, no se puede poner en riesgo la vida de un menor. \"Es un tema del gobierno, pero usted no puede arriesgar a su hijo y armarlo\", dijo. Relevos en seguridad La mañana de este jueves, el general Rolando Solano Rivera rindió protesta como nuevo titular de Seguridad Pública de Guerrero (SSP). Suplió al capitán de la Marina, Evelio Méndez Gómez. El cambio de secretario de Seguridad Pública ocurre en medio de una ola de violencia en Guerrero, donde en las primeras semanas de 2023 ocurrieron en distintos puntos de la entidad asesinatos, desapariciones y suspensiones del transporte público en las ciudades más importantes, como Taxco y Zihuatanejo. De acuerdo con el perfil de Solano Rivera, es originario de Tlapa de Comonfort, en la Montaña de Guerrero, es general brigadier del Ejército con capacitaciones en Colombia sobre combate a grupos criminales traficantes de drogas. En México estuvo a cargo de cuarteles en Guerrero, San Luis Potosí y Tlaxcala. Sigue la violencia En la región Montaña, la mañana de este lunes se confirmó el asesinato del ex alcalde de Atlixtac, Marcelino Ruiz Esteban, y su esposa Guadalupe Guzmán Cano. En Taxco no hay transporte público desde hace cinco días, después del asesinato de un conductor del servicio público y una turista herida. Además, hay 10 personas desaparecidas que fueron privadas de su libertad en el relleno sanitario entre el 24 y 28 de diciembre.",

    "text": "Spain, one of the world’s top tourist destinations, has just detonated a bureaucratic bombshell that will send shockwaves through the travel industry! Tourists hoping to bask in the sun-drenched beaches of Costa del Sol or party in Ibiza will now face an unprecedented crackdown as the Spanish government enforces iron-fisted control over travel logistics.\nBig Brother is Watching: New Travel Crackdown Hits Visitors Hard! In a move that reeks of overreach, Spain is now demanding tourists cough up personal data before even setting foot in a rental car or hotel. Forget about breezing through hotel check-ins or casually picking up a rental car for a scenic drive along Spain’s legendary coastline. Travelers must now jump through a maze of red tape, submitting passport details and other sensitive information—information that hotels and rental agencies must then hand over to the government.\nYour Every Move Under Surveillance? The Spanish authorities claim this Orwellian policy is meant to “enhance security” and track visitors more efficiently. But critics are sounding the alarm, calling it a direct attack on privacy and personal freedom. Is Spain secretly turning into a police state under the guise of “security measures”?\nThe Death of Hassle-Free Travel? For decades, Spain has been a carefree haven where millions of travelers escape for sun, sangria, and adventure. But the golden age of effortless Spanish travel is now under siege. Gone are the days of arriving, grabbing your car keys, and setting off on an impromptu road trip along the picturesque Pyrenees. Now, visitors must navigate a labyrinth of documentation, endure delays, and worry about their personal data falling into the hands of bureaucrats.\nCar Rentals: A New Nightmare? Picture this: You land in Madrid, eager to pick up your rental car and explore the rolling vineyards of La Rioja. But instead of a quick check-in, you’re met with a barrage of paperwork, a demand for extensive identification details, and a government system that tracks your every move. Want to drive down the stunning Costa Brava? Get ready for a deep dive into Spanish bureaucracy before you even hit the road!\nHotels Under Government Control? Dreaming of a romantic getaway in a charming Barcelona boutique hotel? Think again. Spain’s hospitality industry is now on lockdown, forced to report every single guest’s personal data to the authorities. This means longer check-ins, increased costs, and an uneasy sense that Big Brother is watching. Some industry insiders warn this could lead to skyrocketing prices as hotels struggle to comply with new requirements.\nA Devastating Blow to Spain’s Tourism Industry? Spain has long been a top contender for global tourism supremacy, welcoming over 80 million visitors annually. But with these draconian measures, will travelers start looking elsewhere? Industry leaders fear a massive backlash, with tourists opting for hassle-free destinations like Greece, Portugal, or Croatia instead. Could Spain’s once-thriving tourism economy be staring into the abyss?\nWhat’s Next for Travelers? For now, all signs point to stricter enforcement of these policies. Tourists must be prepared to comply with additional paperwork, extended processing times, and a new era of surveillance-driven travel. But will these measures actually keep Spain safer, or are they just a smokescreen for bureaucratic control?\nFinal Warning for Travelers: If Spain is on your travel list, brace yourself for increased scrutiny, potential delays, and the feeling that your every move is being tracked. Will Spain’s sun-kissed beaches and cultural wonders be enough to outweigh the hassle? Or will tourists decide it’s simply not worth the trouble?\nIn case you missed it: Get our daily dose of news, by subscribing to our newsletters.
