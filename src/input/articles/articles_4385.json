    "text": "We suffered our first home defeat of the season after conceding in each half against West Ham.\nThe visitors took the lead with a disputed opener from Tomas Soucek after a defensive mix up, and though we toiled for the leveller – and hit the post through Bukayo Saka – we fell further behind in the second-half.\nDefender Dinos Mavropanos, who played eight times for us in the late 2010s, headed home from a corner to condemn us to a painful defeat.\nDavid Raya saved a stoppage time penalty but the night ended in disappointment.\nWe saw plenty of the ball early on. Bukayo Saka had our first shot on target after just three minutes, set up inside the area by a wonderfully deft flick from Martin Odegaard, but his shot was straight at Alphonse Areola.\nIt was a positive start. Leandro Trossard fired over from the edge of the area after we dominated possession in the opening ten minutes.\nBut then the visitors capitalised on a defensive mix up to take the lead. Gabriel and Alex Zinchenko failed to clear the danger from a left wing cross, Jarrod Bowen hooked the ball back into the area and Soucek converted. Replays suggested that the ball may have been out of play before Bowen sent the cross in, but after a long VAR review, the goal was awarded.\nWe were slow to get going again after the concession. West Ham were getting back in numbers and packing the penalty area. Saka had our next attempt at goal on the half hour, heading goalwards from Gabriel Jesus’s clipped cross, but Areola tipped over acrobatically.\nGabriel Martinelli shot wide after Saka had got in behind the Hammers defence to set up the chance, and frustrations continued to grow as we counted down to half-time.\nSaka came the closest to bulging the net for us in the opening half. Martin Odegaard slipped a pass through to him in the box, and although the angle was tight, Saka squeezed his shot past the keeper and against the post. The rebound bounced off Trossard and wide.\nOdegaard looked to get us going with a driving run in first-half stoppage time, but he was crowded out inside the area after exchanging passes with Gabriel Jesus.\nWe began the second half seeing lots of the ball too. Declan Rice fizzed a shot just over from 20 yards but West Ham doubled their lead from a corner.\nJames Ward-Prowse bent in an inswinger, onto the head of former Gunner Mavroponas, who beat David Raya via a deflection off the cross bar.\nMikel Arteta responded by sending on Reiss Nelson and Eddie Nketiah to inject some energy. Within minutes Jesus had a header saved low down, then headed wide when well placed following excellent work from Odegaard.\nWe were frantically looking for a route back into the game. Trossard drew a smart low save from Areola after a good turn in the box and Odegaard sent a speculative effort wide as desperation grew.\nBut the goal just would not come, despite us having more than 30 shots on goal over the 90 minutes.\nRaya saved a last-minute penalty from Said Benrahma after Rice fouled Emerson in the box, but there was little to cheer at full-time.\nAnd so we reached the halfway point of the league campaign with our third defeat of the season, in second place, two points behind leaders Liverpool.\nWe conclude 2023 with a trip across town to take on Fulham at Craven Cottage on New Year’s Eve.\nOur next game at Emirate Stadium is against Liverpool on Sunday, January 7 in the FA Cup third round.\nCopyright 2023 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.

    "title": "AI-driven fraud a critical threat to business",
    "text": "[ By Staff Writer, ITWebJohannesburg, 22 Nov 2024](/contributors/YXGxwQDq1w7lPVoZ) Businesses in South Africa have identified AI-driven fraud as a major emerging threat, according to a recent research report. Digital identity solutions provider iiDENTIFii commissioned World Wide Worx to conduct research and produce the iiDENTIFii Identity Index 2024 report. It is based on responses from 200 large and medium enterprises across industry sectors and provides an in-depth analysis of the current identity fraud concerns, practices, and preparedness among businesses. Those surveyed in the study expressed concerns about growing identity verification fraud and its impact on their business. These concerns centred around the potential for financial loss (35.3%) and reputational damage (34.8%), illustrating that financial and brand implications are almost equally weighted when considering the future outcomes of a business. The concern for AI-driven fraud was particularly pronounced, with up to 63.2% of smaller businesses and 60.9% of larger businesses identifying it as a critical threat. Businesses in South Africa are adopting identity verification (IDV) solutions with the aims of enhancing security and reducing fraud. The report shows that adoption rates of AI-based fraud detection are at 50.5% and biometric methods are at 39.5%. This demonstrates a strategic shift towards leveraging cutting-edge technologies to mitigate identity fraud risks. However, the implementation of IDV solutions doesn’t come without its challenges. Arthur Goldstuck, author, thought leader and founder of World Wide Worx says, “Despite the trend towards investing in IDV solutions, there are still some significant barriers to implementation, with 31% citing regulatory compliance and 23% citing user acceptance as the most substantial barriers.” This is further reflected in the investment patterns in fraud prevention technologies. Many businesses, particularly those with 201-1,000 employees, allocate between 10-20% (46.4%) of their budgets to these technologies, underscoring the prioritisation of fraud prevention in their corporate strategies. Gur Geva, founder and CEO of iiDENTIFii, adds, “This points towards an opportunity for more coordinated industry-wide approaches to digital identity, from stronger collaboration to a sustained commitment to investing in advanced technologies. This could enhance the effectiveness of fraud prevention at an industry level and build a more resilient ecosystem against identity fraud.” Larger companies also display significant investment, with 42.2% dedicating 10-20% and 26.6% allocating more than 20% of their budgets to fraud prevention technologies. However, a lack of collaboration among industry stakeholders is evident, with 45.6% of small businesses and 31.3% of large businesses never engaging in cooperative efforts to share intelligence and combat fraud. “As companies respond to emerging threats and adopt new technologies, tracking progress through this index will be essential to ensuring that identity verification systems are not only robust but also responsive to the evolving landscape of identity fraud. This dynamic approach, supported by the Identity Index, will ultimately drive stronger and more cohesive efforts in safeguarding against fraud and enhancing trust in digital interactions,” says Goldstuck.

    "title": "Andy Cohen Reacts to Anderson Cooper Getting Hit in Head Covering Hurricane Milton",
    "text": "Hurricane Milton’s surprise cameo in Anderson Cooper ‘s newscast has Andy Cohen calling for a New Year’s Eve encore. On Oct. 9, while braving the fierce winds of Hurricane Milton in Bradenton, Florida, Cooper was struck by flying debris during a live broadcast. The incident quickly prompted fans to demand his return to CNN ‘s annual New Year’s Eve spectacular, a show that has become synonymous with Cooper’s endearingly tipsy antics. Videos by PopCulture.com Andy Cohen, Cooper’s longtime friend and co-host of the beloved year-end bash, was quick to take up the public’s cause. Reposting a fan’s Instagram story, Cohen added his emphatic “Agree” to the plea, shared via E! Online : “We need @AndersonCooper and @BravoAndy to host NYE. Please get this national treasure under cover.” The Bravo maestro didn’t stop there. He also shared a post from X (formerly Twitter) that humorously suggested, “CNN had better let Anderson Cooper black out on New Year’s Eve for this.” This cheeky demand refers to the duo’s infamous on-air shenanigans, which have become a staple of holiday entertainment for many viewers. The demand for Cooper’s return to the New Year’s Eve spotlight comes on the heels of CNN’s brief flirtation with sobriety on the show. However, the network’s attempt to impose a “dry” policy was short-lived, with Cooper and Cohen returning to their glasses-raised glory to usher in 2024. It was during this alcohol-fueled festivity that Cooper captured hearts nationwide with his infectious, tipsy giggles during an on-air drinking game alongside Cohen and Neil Patrick Harris . While the hurricane incident has thrust Cooper back into the New Year’s Eve conversation, it’s worth noting that his friendship with Cohen extends far beyond their annual televisual festivities. In a 2022 interview on the Table for Two podcast, Cohen reflected on their relationship, saying, “We’ve been able to develop our friendship as a public duo, which has been fun for me and for him.” The bond between these “geriatric parents,” as Cohen jokingly refers to them, also extends to their children. Cohen expressed his joy about their kids’ friendship, saying, “I’m so glad that Ben will grow up with Wyatt, and will grow up to see Anderson raising Wyatt and Sebastian.” Despite the lighthearted nature of their New Year’s Eve antics, both Cooper and Cohen have faced their share of professional challenges. Cooper has stood by Cohen through recent controversies, including allegations from former Real Housewives stars. Cooper praised Cohen’s resilience in an interview with Vulture , stating, “Every day when I turn on my phone, I see content that Andy Cohen is responsible for. Much more so than any late-night host.” He added that while Cohen “makes it look easy,” he is “paddling really, really fast under the water.” As the dust settles from Hurricane Milton and the anticipation builds for CNN’s New Year’s Eve plans, fans continue to rally behind the dynamic duo. One fan encapsulated the sentiment perfectly, posting , “The world is slowly healing through Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen taking shots on #cnnNYE and hearing Anderson’s giggle.”",

    "title": "Escuelas cerradas y destruidas: así compromete la guerra la educación y el futuro de los niños de Gaza",
    "text": "Cuando Mohammad Mosa se vio obligado a huir de su casa en octubre para ponerse a salvo, se llevó su portátil con la esperanza de reanudar las clases por Zoom entre un bombardeo y otro. Mosa, de 14 años, aspira a conseguir una beca y confiaba en que, como pasó en las otras guerras que ha vivido, podría seguir con sus estudios. Pero dos meses después, lo único que ha aprendido es a hacer pan en una hoguera. Los intensos bombardeos y un férreo bloqueo han convertido la vida de la población civil en Gaza en una lucha diaria por sobrevivir , y la educación es una de las muchas víctimas. Olivos y basura: los palestinos queman lo que encuentran en Gaza para cocinar y calentarse\n“En estos momentos no hay ningún tipo de educación o escolarización en la Franja de Gaza”, explica Jonathan Crick, portavoz de UNICEF en Jerusalén. “Antes de que escalaran las hostilidades había aproximadamente 625.000 estudiantes [en edad escolar] en la Franja, pero ahora ninguno de ellos va a la escuela. El nivel de violencia y las hostilidades en curso, los intensos bombardeos que se están produciendo, impiden que puedan recibir una educación”.\nFuera de Gaza, esta tragedia ha pasado relativamente desapercibida en un contexto de necesidades humanitarias más urgentes. Más de 8.000 niños han muerto , miles han resultado heridos y no se vislumbra el fin de los bombardeos. Otros se mueren de hambre , están gravemente enfermos o corren el riesgo de contraer enfermedades porque no tienen acceso a agua potable ni a saneamiento.\nPasarán muchas semanas, y probablemente muchos meses, antes de que los niños de Gaza vuelvan a las aulas. Para los supervivientes, esta interrupción de su educación, que se suma al tiempo perdido por la pandemia de COVID-19 y conflictos anteriores, proyectará una larga sombra sobre su futuro, sobre el que ya pesará el legado de traumas y pérdidas de esta guerra.\nNo hay perspectivas de reapertura de las escuelas mientras los ataques aéreos y los bombardeos se sucedan con una intensidad que no ha perdonado ni a las aulas, ni a los profesores, ni a los alumnos de Gaza. “Quiero mucho a mis alumnos y pienso en ellos todo el tiempo. Antes, su mayor deseo era obtener una puntuación perfecta en sus exámenes. Ahora, piensan en cómo sobrevivir a la muerte y al desplazamiento”, dice Suha Musa, que antes de la guerra era profesora de matemáticas en la escuela solo para chicos de Al-Zaytoun, en el oeste de Gaza.\nA mediados de diciembre, 352 edificios escolares habían resultado dañados, más del 70% de la infraestructura educativa de Gaza, según cálculos de la ONU. Muchos de los centros educativos que siguen en pie se han convertido en refugios, incluidas las más de 150 escuelas de la Agencia de la ONU para los Refugiados de Palestina en Oriente Próximo (UNWRA) y unas 130 gestionadas por las autoridades locales. “Por supuesto, no pueden impartir ningún tipo de clase cuando los refugios ya están abarrotados”, indica Crick.\nMás de 200 profesores muertos Hay cientos de miembros del personal que, al igual que sus alumnos, nunca volverán a las aulas. Al menos 200 profesores han muerto y más de 500 han resultado heridos. Los supervivientes están desplazados –el 80% de los habitantes de la Franja se han visto obligados a dejar su hogar– y no están en condiciones de trabajar o aprender. Tienen hambre, sed y frío, y apenas acceso a electricidad o Internet.\n“Mis compañeros de clase, de mi club de boxeo y de mi club de inglés han huido de la ciudad de Gaza, y la comunicación es difícil porque hay muy poca conexión a Internet”, explica Mosa, cuya casa está en una zona donde los soldados israelíes libran combates terrestres con militantes de Hamás.\nA los problemas logísticos se suman los traumas crecientes, las noticias de familiares y amigos muertos, heridos o desaparecidos. Incluso antes de que comenzara el conflicto, cuatro de cada cinco niños de Gaza vivían con depresión, miedo y dolor. “Me enteré de que mi amigo Ahmed Yaghi está en Jan Younis, y las noticias de hoy mencionaban bombardeos en esa zona”, cuenta Mosa. “No pude comunicarme para saber cómo estaba, y luego recibí la devastadora noticia de que habían matado a mi amigo Ibrahim y a toda su familia”. Lloró cuando se enteró de las muertes. Como muchos otros niños de Gaza, sus sueños se han reducido a esperar que cesen las bombas. “Cuando empezaron de nuevo los bombardeos [tras el alto el fuego temporal], me pareció insoportable. Sólo espero que termine la guerra para poder volver a una vida normal”, explica.\nLos educadores y los grupos de ayuda advierten de que, aunque se acuerde un alto el fuego a largo plazo, la vuelta a algo parecido a la normalidad en Gaza llevará mucho tiempo porque los daños han sido enormes. “Cuando hablamos de educación, hablamos de un sistema, como ocurre con la sanidad”, afirma Crick. “Es absolutamente imposible que estos sistemas vuelvan a funcionar sin un alto el fuego humanitario duradero. Es esencial para poder ayudar a los niños adecuadamente y a gran escala”.\nNiños refugiados en una tienda de campaña en Rafah, el pasado 18 de diciembre. Mahmud Hams/AFP/Getty Images Las aulas serán el primer gran problema, porque ya había escasez antes de este conflicto. Muchas escuelas funcionaban en dos turnos, en los que un conjunto de edificios alberga una “escuela” por las mañanas y otra cohorte de alumnos por las tardes, por lo que los daños en un solo edificio pueden suponer que dos escuelas dejen de funcionar. “Se pueden imaginar el reto que supondrá relanzar un sistema educativo en condiciones, cuando ya estaba en una situación tan catastrófica”, lamenta Crick.\nAdemás, hay que tener en cuenta el equipamiento y el material didáctico. En las escuelas que siguen en pie, los refugiados desesperados han estado utilizando sillas y bancos de madera como leña para cocinar porque no hay gas.\nLas organizaciones de ayuda humanitaria pueden distribuir tiendas y material, pero el personal docente será mucho más difícil de reemplazar. Los estudiantes y colegas universitarios que lloran la muerte de Refaat Alareer , poeta asesinado por un ataque aéreo israelí, dicen que echarán de menos sus clases tanto como sus escritos.\n“Enseñar para él era una vocación, no una profesión”, afirma Akram Habeeb, colega del departamento de inglés de la Universidad Islámica de Gaza, donde Alareer impartía clases sobre Shakespeare. “No creo que ningún profesor pueda sustituirle en este momento. Siempre animaba a sus alumnos a ser creativos, a pensar de forma creativa. No quería que se limitaran a seguir lo que él decía”.\nAlareer no murió en la universidad, pero el campus también ha sido bombardeado, y entre otras víctimas del profesorado se encuentra el presidente de la universidad, Sufyan Tayeh, que murió junto con su familia en otro ataque aéreo israelí. Aunque se reconstruyan las aulas, se traigan libros de texto y se forme a nuevos profesores, a Musa le preocupa que los niños vean sus escuelas de otra manera, después de que tantos hayan pasado tiempo hacinados en ellas, soportando frío, hambre, suciedad y terror. “La imagen que los alumnos tienen de sus escuelas, cómo las valoran, cambió después de que se convirtieran en refugios”, afirma. “Su salud mental se verá sin duda afectada por las difíciles condiciones que están soportando. Necesitarán mucho tiempo para prepararse para volver a estudiar”.\nTraducción de Emma Reverter",

    "text": "Uno de los utensilios de cocina fundamentales para las preparaciones tiene un componente [cancerígeno ](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/cancer)y es por eso que es necesario eliminarlo de la práctica diaria y reemplazarlo por una opción que no sea perjudicial para la [salud](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/salud?utm_medium=paid&utm_source=Google&utm_campaign=DSA_Dinamico7&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwuMC2BhA7EiwAmJKRrM834YSRE4xcpSQRPwsPPpaxM7zXsQOYmRjNpOBwW8pB0dmsnpmraxoCPYsQAvD_BwE). La información que hay que saber a la hora de hacer las compras de elementos para cocinar. Según la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) hay un compuesto altamente nocivo que debemos evitar en nuestros utensilios de cocina. Se trata del perfluorooctanoico (PFOA), presente en las sartenes antiadherentes y otros utensilios, y que fue clasificado como carcinógeno por la OMS. El PFOA es un disruptor endocrino, es decir, puede causar desequilibrios hormonales y tener serias consecuencias para la salud. Está asociado con un mayor riesgo de cáncer, afectó el desarrollo celular y generó problemas en el sistema reproductivo, inmunológico y órganos como el hígado y los riñones. Además, se encontró en estudios que aumenta los niveles de colesterol. La Autoridad Europea de Seguridad Alimentaria (EFSA) también advirtió que el PFOA interfiere en el metabolismo de los ácidos grasos, desequilibrando el metabolismo de los lípidos y las lipoproteínas. La Agencia de Protección Ambiental de Estados Unidos (EPA) agrega que la exposición a este compuesto puede tener consecuencias negativas para la salud, incluso durante el embarazo. Es importante destacar que, si bien la Unión Europea prohibió el uso de PFOA desde julio de 2020, los fabricantes ya eliminaron gradualmente este compuesto de los utensilios de cocina de teflón, indicándolo con la etiqueta \"sin PFOA\". Sin embargo, es fundamental estar atentos y revisar nuestros utensilios para asegurarnos de que no tienen este compuesto dañino. En caso de poseer una sartén de teflón sin la etiqueta que especifique que no posee PFOA, debés cambiarla de inmediato por sartenes de acero inoxidable, hierro fundido o cerámica. MÁS INFO ALERTA: la OMS advirtió que el talco puede ser cancerígeno El talco fue clasificado como \"probablemente cancerígeno\" por la agencia para el [cáncer](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/cancer) de la [Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS)](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/oms), que también clasificó como cancerígeno el acrilonitrilo, un compuesto utilizado en la producción de polímeros. Los expertos del Centro Internacional de Investigaciones sobre el Cáncer (CIRC/IARC), reunidos en Lyon (Francia), publicaron sus resultados el viernes en la revista The Lancet Oncology. El talco, un mineral natural extraído en muchas regiones del mundo, es \"probablemente cancerígeno\" para los seres humanos, a partir de una combinación de estudios parciales en seres humanos (cáncer de ovario) y pruebas suficientes obtenidas a partir de animales de laboratorio. Según esos expertos, la exposición ocurre principalmente en el entorno laboral durante la extracción, molienda o procesamiento del talco, o durante la fabricación de productos que lo contienen. Para la población en general, la exposición ocurre principalmente a través del uso de cosméticos y polvos corporales que contienen talco. No obstante, los expertos no descartan ciertos sesgos en los estudios que mostraron un aumento en la incidencia de cáncer. Aunque la evaluación se centró en el talco que no contiene amianto, no se podría excluir que el talco estuviera contaminado con amianto en la mayoría de los estudios con humanos. En junio, el gigante farmacéutico estadounidense Johnson & Johnson (J&J) cerró un acuerdo definitivo con la justicia de 42 estados en Estados Unidos en un caso de talco acusado de haber causado cánceres.",

    "text": "Caitlin Clark has biggest flaw in her game pointed out after mixed start to WNBA season\nCaitlin Clark is in the midst of a shooting slump, and it's become apparent that she has a major gap in her game that has been exposed.\nWNBA star Caitlin Clark is currently experiencing a challenging shooting slump, particularly from the right side of the basket.\nDespite some remarkable moments in her sophomore season, including leading the Indiana Fever to an impressive victory over the previously undefeated New York Liberty with a barrage of 3-pointers, Clark's shooting has been off in recent games. She's made just 1 of 23 attempts from beyond the arc in matches against the Golden State Valkyries, the Las Vegas Aces, and the Seattle Storm.\nYet, she still managed to rack up 19 points and 10 rebounds against the Aces. Clark went 0-for-7 from deep against Golden State, followed by 1-for-10 against the Aces, and then 0-for-6 in the win over the Sounders. Her 3-point shooting has cooled since the intense matchup with the Connecticut Sun.\nEx-LIV Golf star playing PGA Tour event had farewell message to Phil Mickelson after exitREAD MORE:\nViktor Hovland makes PGA Tour admission over 'competing against Saudis' at LIV Golf\nAn interesting observation about Clark's shooting struggles is that she's deadly accurate when shooting from her left side. However, when she shoots from the right side of the basket, her field goal percentage dramatically drops by more than half, as noted on the WNBA subreddit.\nThis can be attributed to Clark's tendency to lean into her shot. When she prepares to shoot, both her feet point to the left, which allows her to swiftly change direction on a defender and drive the ball to her left side.\nBut when she takes shots from her right side, Clark has to switch up her technique, messing with her shot power and precision. Due to the need for repositioning for right-sided shots, Clark's jump loses force and her altered stance impacts her accuracy toward the hoop.\nClark's stats show a stark contrast, with roughly 20 percent success on attempts from the right of the hoop compared to nearly 50 percent from downtown on her stronger left flank.\nClark seems aware that her opponents might be exploiting this weakness but remains convinced it's just a temporary dip in performance.\nAddressing the press, she insisted: \"There are going to be stretches that are really good, and there's going to be stretches that aren't as good, and obviously it's frustrating as you want them to go in... I don't feel like it's anything that's off, necessarily.\"\n\"I got to find a way to continue to shoot and remain confident in myself because I know I've put the time in. I don't feel like it's anything that's off necessarily, but yeah, it would've been nice if they went down.\"\nDuring their west coast swing, the Fever recorded a 1-2 tally which coincided with Clark's trio of games showcasing her long-range efforts. In a tough battle against the Storm, she could only contribute six points despite dishing out nine dimes in a 94-86 victory.\nAliyah Boston had a standout performance, leading the Fever to triumph. The former No. 1 overall pick scored 31 points and grabbed eight rebounds, pushing the Fever's record to 7-7.\nThe Fever will next face off against the 4-11 Los Angeles Sparks on Thursday, June 26.",
