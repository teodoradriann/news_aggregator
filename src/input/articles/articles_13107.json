    "text": "(CNN) — A series of powerful storms in the Pacific Ocean are [driving towering waves](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/28/weather/high-surf-ventura-san-diego/index.html) into the California coastline, triggering flooding and posing a significant risk to people and structures along the coast. Monstrous, 20-foot-plus waves on Thursday crashed over seawalls and swept away and injured several people, forced rescues and sent a damaging surge of water through coastal California streets. A brief dip in wave heights may occur in some locations along the California coast during the daytime Friday as one storm pushes ashore, but the danger will quickly ramp back up later Friday and Saturday as another system develops behind it. “Overall, this is expected to be an exceptional high-surf and coastal flooding event that has not occurred in many years,” the weather service in Los Angeles warned.

Higher sea levels are making [coastal flooding events worse](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/02/us/sea-level-rise-impact-california-climate/index.html) and will continue to do so in the future. Waves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen- to 20-foot waves are expected along the central and Southern California coasts through Saturday evening. The first round of dangerous waves hit alongside high tide Thursday morning. Several people were injured by a huge wave that slammed into Ventura Beach. The wave crashed over a barrier along the Southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away. Nearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said. High water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the US-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said. The dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said. The dangerous wave risk will lessen on Saturday for Northern California, but continue in southern Oregon and rival Thursday’s impact in Southern California. The Ventura County coast, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches face the most extreme surf and are at risk for significant coastal flooding. One of the storms helping to drive the waves will also bring rain and wind to California through Saturday. High wind alerts are in effect for California’s central coast and the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected. These strong wind gusts will churn up waters even further. The spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby. “Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned. At least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard Thursday and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said. The conditions caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities Thursday and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast. Crews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about 7 feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities. Hoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution. In central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office [issued](https://www.facebook.com/SantaCruzSheriffsOffice/) an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, which included areas of Rio Del Mar, where seawater filled beachside roadways and pushed against some homes, CNN affiliate KION reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day. Massive waves attract surfers to Mavericks Despite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco. Pro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having [some of the biggest waves](https://www.visithalfmoonbay.org/articles/mavericks-biggest-surf-west-coast) in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Local resident Ion Banner [told the affiliate](https://abc7news.com/mavericks-surf-ca-storm-waves-at-today-weather-half-moon-bay/14235785/) that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said. “The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.” Mavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells. The legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen. On Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco. “If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.” CNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.

    "title": "New MLSE CEO Keith Pelley brings passion, energy and desire to win to the job",
    "text": "TORONTO – Keith Pelley brought a photo of his late father Walter with him when he checked out Scotiabank Arena in his new role as president and chief executive officer of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment.\nHis dad used to take him to the odd Leafs game back in the day at Maple Leaf Gardens. And that connection continues.\n“I took (the photo) out the first game that I went to when I had this complete access (to the arena),” Pelley said. “And I’m down at the glass (by the ice) and I just placed it on the glass and said ‘We’re here, Dad.’\nMaple Leafs Sports and Entertainment (MLSE) president and CEO Keith Pelley, who grew up supporting the teams he now runs, is all-in already. Pelley poses for a portrait in Toronto, Thursday, April 4, 2024. Pelley has attended Toronto FC's home opener, taken in a Habs-Leafs game in Montreal, engaged all his club presidents and addressed the entire staff, and Thursday was only his second day on the job. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young “It was a really cool moment.”\nNow Pelley is in charge, overseeing the Leafs, Raptors, Argos, Toronto FC and Marlies.\nIt’s his dream job. And he says his last.\n“As I told the staff today, coming back to run your childhood teams is pretty exciting,” Pelley said.\nThursday was officially his second day on the job. But Pelley has already attended Toronto FC’s home opener, taken in a Habs-Leafs game in Montreal — sitting with Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe on the trip home — and engaged his club presidents.\nHe’s all-in already.\n“I’m having a really really good time … I’m wickedly energized and looking forward to the ride,” he said in an interview.\nSpend any time with Pelley and you quickly learn he comes with a testing handshake and boundless energy.\nHe is exactly who you hope to be seated next to at your next dinner party. One story follows another, without a hint of name or event dropping.\nPelley just likes a good yarn. And he has plenty of them, having travelled to some 42 countries during his almost nine-year tenure as chief executive of golf’s European Tour Group.\nMarried with two kids, Pelley proudly says his family is now global — as well as dual Canadian-British citizens. He explains they mostly got their British passports to give the kids more options.\nBut it clear the family’s time in Britain was well-spent.\nPelley lived in Virginia Water, southwest of London, during his time with the European Tour Group, the job he left to come back to Toronto.\nPelley’s wife Joan and 17-year-old daughter Hope are still in London, because of school commitments. Their 21-year-old son Jason is on the golf team at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut.\nPelley, whose golf handicap is five, says the family will always keep a pied-à-terre in London. It will come in handy given Pelley now owns a piece of English second-tier soccer side Birmingham City as part of American financier Tom Wagner’s consortium.\nPelley says Wagner’s “whole aspiration is to win on the field, off the field and in the community.”\n“In every conversation that I’ve had with the (MLSE) owners here, during this interview process, everything kept coming back to winning, but multiple definitions of winning,” he said.\n“They definitely want to win on ice, on court on field. They definitely want to win off (it) as well.”\nFor Pelley, that includes giving back to the community. But also to showcase MLSE.\n“I want to make it so everyone worldwide knows of MLSE, knows it’s a world-class organization in everything we do.”\nPelley sees the 2026 FIFA World Cup as a door to opportunity.\n“We’re not going to do the World Cup on the side of our desk,” he said. “We will have a full dedicated team for World Cup 2026.”\nThere were lessons learned from the 2018 and 2023 Ryder Cups in France and Italy, respectively, from the event’s economic impact to the sport’s legacy.\nHe says the opportunity arising from the World Cup is “as wild as your imagination can be.”\nPelley dismisses talk of MLSE’s owners not being aligned, saying winning is their common goal.\nThe Raptors are rebuilding and TFC needs more goal-scoring, he says. As for the Leafs, Pelley is optimistic and excited about the playoffs.\nHe says his message to his team presidents — Masai Ujiri of the Raptors, Brendan Shanahan of the Leafs and Bill Manning of TFC and the Argos — is “How can I help?”\n“Leadership’s about empowerment,” he added. “It’s about getting the right people and empowering them. And there are so many great people here.”\nWhile MLSE is a sports/entertainment juggernaut, Pelley says it can’t stop moving. Innovation is essential. So is harnessing the creativity of social media.\nWitness the so-called 2018 Ryder Cup “Moliwood” video showing England’s Tommy Fleetwood and Italy’s Francesco Molinari in bed with the trophy.\n“How good was that for you,” asks Fleetwood.\nPelley points to Justin Bieber at the NHL all-star game and how he — and his outsized red-and-pink polka-dot coat — brought more star quality and eyes to the event,\nPelley says the product on the field has to be top-notch. And if it isn’t, “people need to understand why it is not.”\nPelley is already a fan of the vibe at BMO Field, promising to watch a game with the supporters groups in the south stand.\n“The crazy guys,” he said with a smile. “I’m going to be there, for sure. Guaranteed.”\nPelley’s office in the MLSE offices adjacent to Scotiabank Arena is largely empty, a work in progress.\nA few books — “The World Needs More Canada,” “Great Moments in Canadian Sports,” “It’s Our Game” and a few architectural tomes, among them — join a stylish statue of a hockey goaltender.\nPelley is a local boy. He grew up in the Toronto suburb of Etobicoke and graduated from Ryerson University, now called Toronto Metropolitan University.\nThe former TSN and Rogers Media boss succeeds Michael Friisdahl, who left MLSE in February 2022 to take over a British-based multinational aviation services company.\nFriisdahl, who had been in charge since December 2015, preferred to do his work from behind the scenes. Expect Pelley to be more visible, while cognizant of the fact that you let the experts do their job.\nA music buff — he came up with his own top 50 list topped by Dire Straits’ “Sultans of Swing” — the 60-year-old Pelley was planning to take in the Bad Bunny show at Scotiabank Arena on Thursday.\nCoffee with Cher is on his bucket list. Pelley admires her flair, personality and longevity — and believes she likely has plenty to share.\n“I bet you she is a really astute business person.”\n—\nFollow @NeilMDavidson on X platform, formerly known as Twitter\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 4, 2024.",

    "text": "Ex meio-campista do Fluminense rendeu uma quantia milionária para o Fluzão\nFluminense ativo no mercado O Fluminense conseguiu fazer uma boa temporada, apesar de não ter erguido a taça do mundial de clubes, a equipe comandada por Fernando Diniz alcançou feitos históricos em 2023. O Tricolor das Laranjeiras foi campeão da Libertadores da América e chegou a final do Mundial de Clubes.\nAgora a diretoria do clube trabalha para que a próxima temporada seja ainda mais bem sucedida e busca garantir reforços de peso para 2024. Um detalhe é que alguns nomes importantes podem deixar a equipe neste final de ano, um deles é o volante André, que pode estar há um passo de ser vendido para o futebol europeu.\nAlém da venda desses jogadores, o Flu pode pegar a grana de um outro atleta que já passou pelo Fluminense no passado para trazer mais reforços a Fernando Diniz. Trata-se de Gustavo Scarpa. Como o Nottingham Forest vendeu o meia para o Atlético por R$27 milhões, o Flu terá uma taxa por vitrine.\nDe acordo com apuração do portal NetFlu, em virtude do Mecanismo de Solidariedade da Fifa, o Fluminense, como clube formador, tem direito a uma porcentagem em todas as vendas do atleta. Scarpa esteve no Tricolor entre os 17 e 22 anos. Assim, o Flu fica com 3% do total.\nFluminense ganha quantia milionária com Scarpa Ou seja, o Fluminense receberá cerca de R$ 810 mil do Nottingham Forest nas próximas semanas. Esse dinheiro pode ajudar o Clube a pagar um salário de um grande jogador que a equipe queira contratar.\nBittencourt ganhou uma quantia milionária com Gustavo Scarpa. Foto: Flick Fluminense\nAlém de Antônio Carlos, que já foi anunciado e Renato Augusto que está encaminhado, o Flu ainda quer pelo menos mais um atacante que atue pelo lado de campo para fazer sombra a Keno.\nO Fluminense se reapresentará nas Laranjeiras em meados de janeiro para começar a preparação para os desafios da temporada 2024 que terá Recopa Sul-Americana, Copa do Brasil, Brasileirão, Campeonato Carioca e Copa Libertadores da América\nTorcida do Fluminense fala sobre Scarpa Leitura recomendada:",
