    "text": "Deltona is known locally for its stunning trails, beautiful parks and its nearby winery. Did you know it's also known for having the worst Taco Bell in the country? That is according to a recent survey released by Fast Company , a business magazine that looked through Google Maps reviews of every Taco Bell eatery in the United States to determine the most liked — and disliked —locations. The magazine \"ranked the locations based on a weighted scoring system that we devised, which factors in both the average customer review score and the number of reviews that customers have left,\" according to the survey's results, published on Fast Company's website. The company did not return an email request for comment as of Friday afternoon. Deltona Taco Bell location named worst in the country The chain's Deltona restaurant, located at 1519 Saxon Blvd., topped the list of \"worst\" Taco Bell locations, according to the survey, based on 95 reviews (the total number as of July 31). One of these reviews, which Fast Company chose to illustrate the customers' sentiment toward the restaurant, calling it the \"representative review,\" said, \"Not a good first impression considering this place has just opened up.\" \"The food wasn’t great at all to be honest. The burritos looked a mess, had missing ingredients I’m sure, and my supreme chalupa was actually missing tomato and cheese so you know 2/4 ingredients missing. Not bad eh. Even paid a dollar extra for the steak so that’s laughable,\" it continued. \"So yeah. Take a gamble if you wish. I did and it was pants (sic) but eh. You might get good food who knows. Maybe it will improve in time. Fingers crossed as I do like Taco Bell.” Chicken tender wars: How are Zaxby's, Huey Magoo's and Raising Canes different? According to Google Maps, the location has an average score of 1.8 out of five stars based on 105 reviews. A one-star review from a week ago said, \"Been multiple times thinking it’s a new location give them a chance, but this is probably my seventh time being at this location now, and not once have they got my order right.\" Another reviewer grabbed Mexican pizzas at the drive-thru \"for a quick snack,\" but \"we paid dearly for the rest of the evening. Never again.\" But the restaurant still has its fans, with one reviewer writing three weeks ago, \"Never really have a bad experience here. Today, today they killed it. Food was phenomenal. First taco ever that actually looked like the picture. Great job.\" What are the other low-ranking Taco Bells in the U.S.? And the best? As far as the other locations that came close to the chain's overall poor customer reviews, the next four on the list are way up north: - 1810 E. Seymour Ave., Cincinnati, Ohio. - 355 Dix Ave., Queensbury, New York. - 1893 Elmwood Ave., Buffalo, New York. - 7660 Barrington Road, Hanover Park, Illinois. But the survey also identified which Taco Bell stores were the best reviewed in the country, located at: - 5200 CA-1, Pacifica, California. - 925 FM802, Brownsville, Texas. - 402 Dixieland Road, Harlingen, Texas. - 3509 John F. Kennedy Blvd., Union City, New Jersey. - 420 S. 10th St., McAllen, Texas.",

    "text": "SA crush listless India to win opening Test\nCenturion, Dec 28 (PTI) Intimidated by pace and scarred by extra bounce, an under-prepared India suffered an embarrassing innings and 32 run loss to a far superior South Africa in the opening Test which ended inside three days here.\nHaving scored 245 in the first innings, the Indian batters managed only 131 in 34.1 overs in the second innings after South Africa managed a handsome 408 in its first essay.\nSouth Africa thus took an unassailable 1-0 lead in the two-match series and India’s dreams of winning a Test series in Rainbow Nation for the first time in 31 years lay in tatters.\nOnly redemption now could be 1-1 draw if they managed to square the series during the New Year’s Test in Cape Town.\nIndian team put up a shoddy batting show, which signified its cluelessness and singular lack of preparedness for a tough assignment like this.\nIt has been a horrible last six to seven weeks for skipper Rohit Sharma, who lost World Cup final, was removed from Mumbai Indians captaincy two weeks back and now didn’t look like a leader that made him an instant favourite during the World Cup.\nThe team also looked a bit like its skipper, dishevelled and without any plan B for course correction.\nAs Bob Marley’s iconic “Don’t worry, Everything Gonna be Alright” blared from loudspeakers, the Indian team must be wondering how nothing went alright through entire course of the match.\nThe incomparable Kagiso Rabada (2/32 in 12 overs) along with left-arm seamers Nandre Burger (4/33 in 10) and Marco Jansen (3/36 in 7.1 overs) made the Indian batters hop, skip and jump as the capacity crowd enjoying their Christmas and New Year’s vacation lapped up every moment of action with great enthusiasm.\nThe result isn’t one bit surprising but the manner of abject surrender will certainly haunt Rohit Sharma for the longest time.\nSince the Adelaide Test match in 2020-21 when India were all-out for 36, never has an Indian team looked so ill-equipped to handle conditions that was diabolically opposite of what they get in sub-continent.\nWith India’s third and fourth pacers leaking runs galore, South Africa managed 408 in the first innings as Indians gave a lovely “farewell present” to Dean Elgar, who played an uncharacteristically attacking innings of 185 in his penultimate Test.\nEven Marco Jansen (84 not out off 147 balls) made merry on a track where fast bowlers would have been licking their lips.\nWith 163 runs in arrears, there was little chance of survival on a track where the ball was flying around and also jagging a fair bit.\nOnce Elgar and Jansen batted India out of the match, least one expected was a decent fightback but save Virat Kohli (76), who showed why he is cut above the rest in terms of technique and temperament, others were found wanting.\nHe was the only one, who could partially conquer the bounce and got his body behind the line to cover the seam movement and also rode the bounce to get his 12 boundaries and a six.\nThe extra bounce found each and everyone wanting while skipper Rohit was done in by another picture perfect seam-up delivery by Rabada, which compelled the Indian skipper to close his bat face and see the delivery deviate just enough to peg back his off-stump.\nBurger, who bowled a bit wide off the crease, consistently bowled back of length, either aiming the rib-cage or keeping at shoulder height outside the off-stump.\nYashasvi Jaiswal couldn’t sway out of the line, first innings centurion KL Rahul and Ravichandran Ashwin fished at deliveries that bounced extra, while Mohammed Siraj got a bumper that could have knocked his head off.\nDitto for Shardul Thakur, who looked terrified and scared trying to fend a Rabada bouncer, while Shreyas Iyer is certainly not a man for pacey and bouncy conditions.\nEarlier veteran Elgar missed out on a well-deserved maiden double hundred but inflicted enough damage on India in company of young Jansen to bat the visitors out of the opening Test.\nElgar, whose previous highest Test score is 199, was inching towards his maiden double hundred before a faint tickle to a leg-side bouncer from Shardul Thakur brought an end to his innings.\nBut that didn’t deter the lanky Jansen, not exactly known for his batting prowess, from negotiating a deflated Indian attack that looked out of sorts and bereft of ideas.\nThe Elgar-Jansen pair added 111 runs for the sixth wicket.\nThe Indian bowlers were even more disappointing on the third morning with Shardul (1/101 in 19 overs) and Prasidh Krishna (1/93 in 20 overs) spraying all over the place, only to be mercilessly punished by the former Proteas skipper Elgar and Jansen.\nThe pair drove, pulled, cut at will and neither the old ball nor the semi-new ball could bring about any change in fortune for the visiting team bowlers.\nJasprit Bumrah (4/69 in 26.4 overs) and Mohammed Siraj (2/91 in 24 overs) once again were unlucky as they repeatedly beat the bat of Elgar and Jansen but didn’t have the rub of the green going their way.\nPrasidh and Thakur were not only below-par but also missed both line and length.\nPrasidh was inducted into the squad to hit the deck and generate extra pace off the surface, but he missed the trick by consistently bowling length balls. Even someone like Gerald Coetzee dispatched him into the stands.\nPrasidh isn’t ready for Test cricket just like India didn’t look ready for the series.",

    "title": "How sustainability, AI can drive a greener future for data centres",
    "text": "In recent years, AI technologies have made significant progress, with steady adoption by large organisations. As AI adoption accelerates, so does energy consumption. It prompts a critical question: how can data centres adapt to AI’s rising energy demands? Hence, a strategic shift towards powerful and sustainable data centres becomes imperative for fostering business growth and environmental responsibility.\nBefore delving into the role of data centres in enhancing energy efficiency, it is important to decode why AI demands such significant energy consumption. AI’s significant energy consumption stems from two main phases — the training phase, where the model learns behaviour autonomously, and the inference phase, where the model operates live, generating responses based on prompts. While both phases are highly energy-intensive, the model training phase is generally more demanding than the inference phase.\nEvery online interaction relies on information stored in distant servers, housed in energy-demanding data centres worldwide. The complexity and duration of server operations to fulfil requests directly correlate with increased power consumption. Within the data centre, energy usage extends beyond servers to include cooling systems, storage systems, networking equipment, and power infrastructure. Notably, servers, the central component, account for a significant 43% of energy consumption, mirroring the contribution of cooling systems. Hence, recognising the environmental impact of AI’s energy consumption becomes paramount. Data centres, the backbone of AI operations, contribute around 1% to global electricity consumption, a seemingly modest figure with significant implications given the carbon footprint associated with electricity generation. Before the AI explosion can take place in full bloom, it will need to find a new approach to energy in the form of Sustainable Solutions for a Greener Tomorrow.\nTransparency and monitoring\nPushing for a clear, transparent, and comparable monitoring and reporting of AI sustainability metrics is the first step toward making AI more environmentally sustainable.\nDeveloping energy-efficient AI algorithms and hardware\nIn the pursuit of sustainability, the tech industry is focusing on developing energy-efficient AI algorithms and hardware. Researchers are exploring techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and efficient neural network architectures to reduce computational complexity without compromising performance.\nEvaluate the energy sources of your cloud provider or data centre\nMinimizing the carbon footprint of AI can be achieved by deploying models in regions equipped with environmentally friendly power resources and a carbon-friendly infrastructure.",

    "text": "DELAND, Fla. — The Volusia County Sheriff’s Office is offering a $50,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest in a 30-year-old cold case.\nLaralee Spear was 15-years-old when she was abducted, shot and killed after getting off her school bus in DeLand on April 25, 1994. According to information from the Sheriff's Office, it is believed that Spear was taken by her killer shortly after getting off the bus at around 3:15 p.m.\nAccording to information from VCSO, Spear was reported missing at about 4:05 p.m. when she didn't return home from DeLand High School.\nAuthorities say deputies responded within minutes, and a Sheriff's Office Air One pilot ultimately located her body at around 5:35 p.m.\nInvestigators say she was found behind a home on Deerfoot Road that had burned down the previous year.\nOfficials said she routinely walked home from the bus stop at the intersection of South Spring Garden Road and Deerfoot Road, which authorities said was not far from where her body was found. The location was about a quarter mile from her family's home on Deerfoot Road.\n30 years ago today, Laralee Spear was abducted and murdered after she got off her school bus outside DeLand. She was 15 years old.\nFor 30 years, detectives have been trying to solve her case. pic.twitter.com/isVTUAkM7y\n— Volusia Sheriff (@VolusiaSheriff) April 25, 2024 Volusia County detectives said they have information that shows prior to Spear’s death, people were hanging out and shooting guns at the abandoned property.\nVolusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood said Thursday that investigators believe someone in the area at the time has information about Spear’s murder that could help in the investigation.\nAnyone with information about Spears' death is asked to contact the Major Case Unit at 386-254-1537 or email ColdCaseUnitTips@ volusiasheriff.gov .\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;",

    "text": "by Reemus Fernando\nKalutara Education Zone is home to over 150 public schools and dozens of International Schools. When the Athletics Championship of this zone commences hundreds of athletes converge on the event venue hoping to test their abilities and book their berths in the Western Province Championships. Vernon Fernando Stadium, Kalutara where this event has been held since 2019 becomes overcrowded with the massive influx of student athletes. The number of athletes arriving at this stadium for the Zonal championships has increased drastically since the year 2020 as the cash-strapped Western Province Education Ministry put an end to the Divisional Championships that year.\nThe massive participation has wrecked havoc at the Kalutara Zonal Athletics Championship 2024 which commenced early this week. The 100 metres sprints of some age categories had more than 100 participants lining up for heats. Such heats which commenced in the morning were still going on in the afternoon session yesterday.\nThe organisers were still struggling to complete the third day’s events schedule when this copy was filed around 6.30 pm yesterday.\nThe large participation of school athletes also attract large number of parents to the competition venue increasing the work load of officials.\nThe root cause of the problem lies in the absence of Divisional Championships which would have promoted only the best from the respective divisions to the zonal championships.\nIt was at Divisional Championships that many a national athletes tested their skills first. Kalutara Zone has four Divisions namely, Kalutara, Panadura, Beruwala and Dodangoda. But since 2021 none of these Divisions have conducted their Divisional athletics championships due to lack of funds. Beruwala Division which is home to more than 50 schools is one of the badly affected areas due to the absence of the Divisional Championship.\nAthletes who are unable to win at Zonal level have a greater chance to win a podium position at Divisional level. Such victories provide motivation for them to continue the sport.\nHowever in team sports authorities had taken steps to conduct Divisional Championships before promoting the best two teams to the zonal level. With track and field sports attracting the highest number of participants from schools it is incumbent upon authorities to recommence Divisional Athletic Championships.",
