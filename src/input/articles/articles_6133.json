    "title": "10 Best Movies Like Prime Video's Unstoppable",
    "text": "WARNING: SPOILERS ahead for Unstoppable.\nThere are several other inspirational and wrestling-focused movies to watch after Amazon Prime Video's Unstoppable. Directed by William Goldenberg in his directorial debut, Unstoppable chronicles the remarkable true story of Anthony Robles, a 2011 NCAA wrestling champion from Arizona State University who was born with one leg. Jharrel Jerome leads the cast of Unstoppable as Anthony Robles, which also includes stellar performances by Jennifer Lopez, Michael Peña. Don Cheadle, and Bobby Cannavale. Unstoppable was released on Prime Video on January 16, 2025 and received a Fresh Rotten Tomatoes score of 75%.\nAs depicted in Unstoppable, Anthony Robles was overlooked by elite college wrestling programs such as the University of Iowa before he became a walk-on redshirt freshman at ASU. Robles went an incredible 96-0 during his junior and senior years at Mesa High School in Arizona. Unstoppable shows Robles went on to wrestle at Arizona State University and net another undefeated season during his 2011 championship run in the 125-pound division. Those who watched Unstoppable's ending were likely inspired not only by Robles' incredible determination on the wrestling mat but also by his ability to overcome the abusive and financial hardships that he faced at home alongside his supportive mother, Judy, played by Jennifer Lopez in Unstoppable.\nAt its core, Unstoppable is a powerful portrait of an unlikely champion whose story is even more inspiring due to his disability and the unfair judgment that came with it. Simply put, Unstoppable is an underdog story with an interesting twist because Robles' track record proves he should not have been considered an underdog in the first place. This key element elevates Unstoppable from being a paint-by-numbers sports biopic and opens up larger discussions outside the arena. Several other films have taken similar approaches to peek into some of the emotional and societal elements that disadvantaged athletes face whose disposition causes an unjust uphill battle.\n10 First Match\n2018\nYour comment has not been saved\nFirst Match\n- Release Date\n- March 12, 2018\n- Runtime\n- 94 minutes\n- Director\n- Olivia Newman\n- Producers\n- Matt Levin , Veronica Nickel , Bryan Unkeless , Ian Bricke , Chanelle Elaine , SueEllen Newman\nCast\n-\nDarrel\n-\nElvire EmanuelleMonique\n-\nCoach Castile\nFirst Match follows a determined teenage girl from Brooklyn's Brownsville neighborhood who turns to wrestling boys as a way to reconnect with her estranged father, amidst the challenges of her life in foster care.

Ryan Destiny (Star, Grown-ish) stars as Shields alongside Brian Tyree Henry (Atlanta) and De'Adre Aziza (She's Gotta Have It).\nThe Fire Inside is directed by Rachel Morrison (Mudbound, Dope) and written by Academy Award winner Barry Jenkins (Moonlight, Mufasa: The Lion King).

Dutton\nRudy is a film about Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger, a young man determined to overcome significant obstacles in order to play football at the University of Notre Dame.

Fried, Cary Woods\n- Production Company\n- TriStar Pictures\n- Sfx Supervisor\n- Joe Digaetano\n- Budget\n- $12 million\nRudy is often considered one of the greatest underdog sports movies ever made. Starring Sean Astin of The Lord of the Rings fame, Rudy follows the titular football-loving protagonist who has always been told he's too small to play the game at the college level. This is the exact same premise as Anthony Robles in Unstoppable, who was overlooked because of his so-called physical disadvantages. Both Unstoppable and Rudy carry a similar message about the sheer determination and grit that defines unlikely sports heroes.\nRelated\nWhat Happened to Rudy After He Graduated From Notre Dame\nThe real-life Rudy Ruettiger made his Hollywood dreams come true with the 1993 film. He went on to become a motivational speaker, author, and pastor.\nRudy was released in 1993 and has stood the test of time as one of the most beloved and legendary sports movies ever made. Featuring supporting performances from Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty, and Lili Taylor, Rudy is the definition of the \"defying-all-odds\" sports film in the same category as another great sports classic, Miracle (2004). Rudy is not currently available to stream but can be rented on most major digital platforms.\n7 Warrior\n2011\nYour comment has not been saved\nWarrior\n- Release Date\n- September 9, 2011\n- Runtime\n- 140 Minutes\n- Director\n- Gavin O'Connor\n- Writers\n- Cliff Dorfman , Anthony Tambakis\n- Producers\nCast\n-\nJoel EdgertonBrendan Conlon\n-\nTommy Conlon\n-\nPaddy Conlon\nWarrior is a 2011 sports drama directed by Gavin O'Connor. The film stars Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton as estranged brothers who enter an MMA tournament, each driven by personal motives, which culminates in an emotional confrontation. Nick Nolte plays their father, a recovering alcoholic whose past actions have fragmented the family. The storyline weaves themes of redemption, forgiveness, and the enduring power of family bonds.\n- Main Genre\n-\nDrama - Character(s)\n- Brendan Conlon , Tommy Conlon , Paddy Conlon , Tess Conlon , Frank Campana , Principal Zito , Colt Boyd , Bryan Callen\nSeveral college wrestlers, including some of Anthony Robles' ASU teammates, have gone on to fight professionally in the hard-hitting world of MMA and the UFC. Warrior (2011) is one of the greatest and most realistic films about mixed martial arts fighters both in and out of the octagon. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton give exceptional performances as two brothers, Tommy and Brendan Conlon, who fight head-to-head for individual championship glory.\nWarrior is one of the greatest and most realistic films about mixed martial arts fighters both in and out of the octagon.\nWarrior is co-written and directed by Gavin O'Connor (The Way Back, The Accountant, Miracle). Although Warrior is not a true story like Unstoppable is, many consider it to be on the same elite level as other great fighting movies such as The Fighter (2012) and Rocky (1976). Warrior earned an 84% on Rotten Tomatoes and is currently streaming on Peacock.\n6 The Wrestler\n2008\nYour comment has not been saved\nThe Wrestler\n- Release Date\n- December 17, 2008\n- Runtime\n- 109 minutes\n- Director\n- Darren Aronofsky\n- Writers\n- Robert Siegel\n- Producers\nCast\n-\nMarisa Tomei\nDarren Aronofsky's The Wrestler is a 2008 drama that centers around Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a pro wrestler who tries to get his life together while reliving his glory days on the ring. Marisa Tomei co-stars as stripper Cassidy with Evan Rachel Wood as Randy's estranged daughter Stephanie.\n- Budget\n- $6 million\n- Studio(s)\n- Searchlight Pictures\n- Distributor(s)\n- Searchlight Pictures\nAnother wrestling classic is the aptly named 2008 film The Wrestler. Starring Mickey Rourke in an Oscar-nominated performance, The Wrestler follows Rourke's aging professional wrestler protagonist Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson who faces health problems and other hardships outside the ring. While Robles was a traditional wrestler, not a professional \"fake\" wrestler as his character described in Unstoppable, The Wrestler cuts just as deep, if not deeper, about life's adversity and hardships.\nEven though The Wrestler is not an inspirational story like Unstoppable, it offers an alternative and nearly opposite perspective from Robles, which makes it an interesting companion piece. Robles is a victorious underdog who competes for sport, while Randy is a tragic figure who wrestles for entertainment. The Wrestler was directed by Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream) and earned a near-perfect 99% Rotten Tomatoes score.\n5 The Peanut Butter Falcon\n2019\nYour comment has not been saved\nThe Peanut Butter Falcon\n- Release Date\n- August 9, 2019\n- Runtime\n- 98 minutes\n- Director\n- Tyler Nilson , Michael Schwartz\n- Writers\n- Michael Schwartz , Tyler Nilson\nCast\n-\nBruce Dern\n-\nYelawolf\nThe Peanut Butter Falcon is a heartfelt adventure film directed by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz.

Actor and director Stephen Merchant wrote and directed Fighting with My Family, which earned a 93% Rotten Tomatoes score.\n3 Stronger\n2017\nYour comment has not been saved\n[\nStronger\n](/db/movie/stronger/)\n- Release Date\n- September 22, 2017\n- Director\n- David Gordon Green\n- Writers\n- John Pollono\nBased on the novel of the same name, Stronger is the inspiring true story of Jeff Bauman, an ordinary man who captured the hearts of his city and the world to become the symbol of hope following the infamous 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.\n- Main Genre\n-\n[Drama](/tag/drama/)\nOne of the most inspiring true stories ever put to film can be found in the 2017 docudrama Stronger. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Boston Marathon Bombing survivor Jeff Bauman, who became a symbol of hope for the grieving city of Boston, MA in 2013 and beyond. Directed by David Gordon Green (Halloween), Stronger alludes to the catchphrase \"Boston Strong,\" which was popularized after the horrific incident that took place on April 15, 2013.\nStronger alludes to the catchphrase \"Boston Strong,\" which was popularized after the horrific incident that took place on April 15, 2013.\nWhile similar to 2016's Patriots Day, Stronger highlights the heroic recovery process Bauman underwent after losing both legs in the explosion and his significant role in capturing those responsible. Stronger is not a sports movie but it is an incredibly moving true story centered on the power of human resiliency, much like Unstoppable.\n2 The Iron Claw\n2023\nYour comment has not been saved\n[\nThe Iron Claw\n](/db/movie/the-iron-claw-2023/)\n- Release Date\n- December 22, 2023\n- Runtime\n- 132 minutes\n- Director\n- Sean Durkin\n- Writers\n- Sean Durkin\n- Producers\nCast\n-\nHarris Dickinson\nThe Iron Claw portrays the rise and fall of the Von Erich family, a dynasty in professional wrestling. Directed by Sean Durkin, the film explores the family members' personal struggles and tragic fates and the lasting impact they left on the sport.\n- Main Genre\n-\n[Drama](/tag/drama/) - Studio(s)\n- A24 , House Productions\n- Distributor(s)\n- A24\nWhat has been called by some as [the greatest wrestling movie ever made, The Iron Claw](http://screenrant.com/the-iron-claw-best-wrestling-movie-ever/) tells the tragic true story of the Von Erich wrestling family.

Avildsen\n- Writers\n-\n[Sylvester Stallone](/tag/sylvester-stallone/) - Producers\nCast\n-\nTalia Shire\n-\nBurt Young\nRocky tells the story of Rocky Balboa, an underdog boxer from Philadelphia who gets an unexpected shot at the world heavyweight title. The film explores Rocky's personal and professional struggles, his romance with Adrian Pennino, and his journey toward self-respect and determination.\n- Main Genre\n-\n[Drama](/tag/drama/)\nIt's impossible not to think of the ultimate boxing movie Rocky when watching Unstoppable, especially considering that Jerome's Robles climbs the Rocky Steps with his crutches twice in the film. The original 1976 Rocky and its many sequels, including the massively [successful Creed franchise](https://screenrant.com/rocky-creed-movies-in-order/), are staples of the sports genre in film.\nMovies like Unstoppable and several of the aforementioned films inevitably live in Rocky's historic and Oscar-winning shadow. There's a fair chance that many of Unstoppable's viewers have already seen Rocky and may have even watched the entire franchise. Just like Rudy, and now Unstoppable, Rocky is a cut above the rest as an all-time great inspirational sports movie.",

Le 20 janvier, les Saint-Laurentais affronteront l'équipe de Cergy-Pontoise en région parisienne, en 16ème de finale de la Coupe de France. Cette étape marque un tournant significatif pour le COSMA, qui doit non seulement se préparer physiquement à affronter un adversaire de niveau supérieur, mais aussi relever un défi logistique et financier.\nLa Fédération prend en charge les billets d'avion pour l'équipe et son staff, mais le club est confronté à d'autres coûts significatifs. En effet, il leur est accordé seulement une nuit d'hébergement avant le match, ce qui pose un problème majeur en termes de préparation et d'adaptation. La préparation optimale exigerait une arrivée dans la région au moins deux jours avant le match. Le club fait savoir qu'avec une somme de 5000 euros accumulée dans la cagnotte ou grâce à l'aide de partenaires, ils pourraient partir dans des conditions répondant à leurs espérances.\nLe 20 janvier, les Saint-Laurentais affronteront l'équipe de Cergy-Pontoise en région parisienne • ©Cosma Basket Face à cette situation, et compte tenu de sa situation financière précaire, le COSMA a décidé de lancer un appel aux dons en ligne, afin de rassembler les fonds nécessaires pour un déplacement et une préparation adéquats. Cette initiative a reçu un soutien notable d'un élu de Guyane, qui a non seulement contribué, mais a également invité ses collègues élus à faire de même, en suggérant une donation symbolique de 100€ chacun.\nFAITES VOS DONS EN CLIQUANT SUR CE LIEN\nLa délégation du COSMA Basket prévoit de s'envoler pour Paris le mardi 16 janvier et de revenir le lundi 22 janvier 2024. Cet appel aux dons est donc une étape cruciale pour assurer que l'équipe puisse concourir dans les meilleures conditions possibles et, espère-t-on, réaliser un nouvel exploit sportif. La solidarité de la communauté et des supporters est donc sollicitée pour aider le club dans cette aventure ambitieuse et prometteuse.",
