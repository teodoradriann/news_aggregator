The team was offering $20 an hour, along with complimentary food and breaks \"in a comfortable warm area,\" to prospective snow shovelers. That was before the postseason contest, originally scheduled for Sunday afternoon, got postponed on Saturday due to public safety concerns amid an ongoing winter weather emergency in western New York.

While the snow was still coming down early Sunday, clean-up efforts were underway at the Orchard Park, New York, [NFL](/tag/nfl) stadium. And a member of Bills Mafia was [helping out in a very Bills Mafia fashion](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2F_yNoPs74/?igsh=MWxmaTVvNGN5NGU4Yw%3D%3D).

The [weather forecast](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/weather/) in Orchard Park on Monday calls for a high of 16 degrees and a low of 13, with winds from 10 to 20 mph. Snow showers are expected in the morning but there's only around a 9% chance of precipitation at kickoff time. \"I'm not saying it's going to be pleasant, but conditions won't be life threatening either,\" Hochul said, via [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39308373/gov-kathy-hochul-steelers-bills-pushed-back-again).",

    "title": "Historic Armenian Quarter in Jerusalem Facing Demolition in Luxury Hotel Dispute | CBN News",
    "text": "JERUSALEM - Here in Jerusalem's Armenian Quarter, an ancient Christian community is fighting to protect its historic land. They're resisting an attempt to put a hotel on property they've owned for centuries, and they believe the issue raises broader concerns for the Christian presence in the city.\nThe Armenian Quarter, with its ancient heritage, is facing a land dispute that has implications beyond these ancient walls. A land deal with a Jewish businessman leased a large portion of the Armenian quarter of the old city, and the investor plans a luxury hotel that would demolish homes where Armenians have lived for centuries.\nArmenian Resident Garo Nalbandian told CBN News, \"My family comes in 1920s after the Turkish massacres. My father come along with the sister without their families.\"\n\"I was living, 1948, inside the convent. Afterwards, when we start to work, we make the money... But when we get married... I took from the Patriarchate, this house. (Since) 1969, when I married, until now, I am living there,\" he said.\nAnother Armenian resident, Hagop Djernazian, told us, \"Two years ago, an illegal deal was signed to lease this land for a hotel. We were shocked to learn that the deal included not only the community parking lot but also houses, the patriarch's garden, and the seminary school.\"\nThe Armenian community in Jerusalem is deeply rooted in the city's history, and now finds itself at the forefront of a struggle for preserving its identity and heritage.\nDjernazian explained, \"Since the fourth century, the Armenians, continue to live here in the Old City on the highest point in the Old City, which is Mt. Zion. And, we have our own quarter. It is important to mention that the Armenian presence in Jerusalem is an uninterrupted presence.\"\nWhile the deal is tied up in court battles, the developer is attempting to begin demolition. Armenians took a stand to keep that from happening, facing violence from representatives of the corporation. Now, they're camping out here to avert any further demolition.\n\"We stopped the bulldozers, we stood in front of them, and we are staying here, we are guarding all day...\" Djernazian said. \"They will take the land in order to prevent from armed settlers and security guards from the company to attack or take over the land.\"\nArmenians have been the caretakers of this piece of Jerusalem in the old city since the fourth century, and it might not seem like such a big deal that somebody wants to lease this property and build a hotel on it. But if you come from a people group that has faced genocide and ethnic cleansing as recently as just a couple of months ago in Armenia, when Azerbaijan pushed out 120,000 Armenians off their ancestral lands and made them refugees in their own country, you can start to understand why this is a much bigger deal.\nNalbandian said if Armenians are ousted from their quarter in Jerusalem, he says it will result in \"the end of the Christians in Jerusalem.\"\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\"Not going to leave...whatever is happening, I going to stay. If they shut my house, I going to put (up a) tent. I'm not looking for the money. I love this place. This is kind of Armenian home and this land. It doesn't belong to the Armenian Jerusalem. Its belong to all Armenians around the world,\" Nalbandian said.\nThe land dispute in the Armenian Quarter might be lost in the news coming out of Gaza, but for these people, it's a life-or-death issue. And it's not just Armenians who are concerned; the wider Christian community in Jerusalem also sees this as a pivotal moment for religious and cultural preservation.\nShare This article",

    "title": "COVID-19 Infection Raises Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation Risk, Study Finds",
    "text": "News\nArticle\nAuthor(s):\nA new study shows that COVID-19 infection significantly increases the risk of exacerbation in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG).\nA recent study at the Medical Center of Southwest China suggests that COVID-19 Omicron infection increases the risk of an exacerbation in patients with [myasthenia gravis (MG)](https://www.ajmc.com/compendium/myasthenia-gravis). Published in [Brain and Behavior](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/brb3.70074), the study adds to the growing body of evidence that infections can significantly impact the risk of exacerbations in patients with autoimmune disorders like MG.1\nThe observational study collected information on COVID-19 infections and exacerbations of 289 patients with MG during China’s widespread Omicron wave between December 2022 and early 2023. Patients in this cohort were predominantly female (60%), with an average age of 46. According to the study, 234 (80.9%) participants contracted COVID-19. The course of infection was generally mild, with 88% of COVID-19 cases classified as low severity (stages 1-3). Common symptoms included respiratory issues in 50% of infected patients and systemic symptoms like fatigue and headache in 74.4%.\n“MG patients with COVID-19 infection exhibited a higher likelihood of exacerbation, compared to those without COVID-19 infection,” the study finds, with exacerbation rates recorded at 18.8% among infected patients versus 7.3% in the non-infected group (P = .039). After adjusting for confounding factors, the hazard ratio for exacerbation in patients with MG post-infection was found to be 3.38 (95% CI, 1.20–9.53; P = .021).\nIn infected patients, MG exacerbations developed quickly after contracting COVID-19, with a median onset time of just 14 days post-infection (interquartile range, 3-24 days). Exacerbations were evaluated based on changes in the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scale, with a worsening of at least 2 points considered an exacerbation. Exacerbations were found to be more severe among patients with MG who had comorbidities and those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, such as corticosteroids.\nMost COVID-19 infections were primarily managed at home, but a few cases required hospitalization. Eight patients with COVID-19 infection (3.4%) developed respiratory failure that required mechanical ventilation, and 3 patients were admitted to the ICU. No deaths were reported within this cohort. However, 14.9% of patients experienced prolonged symptoms of fatigue, tiredness, and shortness of breath.\nTo further investigate the impact of COVID-19 on patients with MG, the researchers conducted a survival analysis comparing MG exacerbations in 2 time periods: December 1, 2022 to March 10, 2023 (DTM23), covering the Omicron wave, and January 2021 to April 2021 (JTA21), an earlier period without COVID-19 exposure. The comparison indicated an increase in exacerbations during the Omicron outbreak, with a recorded exacerbation rate of 17.2% in DTM23 compared to 4.4% in JTA21 (P < .001).\nNo statistically significant differences in COVID-19 vaccination rates were observed between infected and non-infected patients. Although COVID-19 vaccines effectively reduce severe illness, they may offer limited protection against infection with COVID-19 due to the development of unique variants.\nInfection, particularly respiratory infections, has long been known as a trigger for MG exacerbation. This is supported by previous studies showing that viral infections like influenza can similarly increase exacerbation risk.2,3 The results of this study align with recent data from the COVID-19 Associated Risks and Effects in Myasthenia Gravis (CARE-MG) registry that suggests patients with MG infected with COVID-19 are more frequently hospitalized, experience increased disease exacerbations, and have higher mortality rates compared to the general COVID-19 population.4\nIt should be noted that in this study, COVID-19 diagnosis was not based strictly on laboratory tests but rather on typical COVID-19 symptoms. However, the study still adds insight into the increased risk of exacerbations after COVID-19 infection. The researchers suggest, “Developing new and precise protective vaccines would be particularly beneficial for MG patients, especially those on immunosuppressive therapy.”\nReferences:",
