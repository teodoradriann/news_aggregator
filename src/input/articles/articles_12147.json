    "text": "A 43-year-old father almost lost his life during a Wisconsin hunting trip gone wrong. Thankfully, his 12-year-old son was there to save the day. The two were hunting near Siren, Wisconsin when the son, Owen, spotted a bear from a tree stand. The young hunter fired a shot at the bear, hitting it but not killing it. The animal ran off. After about 20 minutes, according to [People](https://people.com/boy-12-saves-dad-from-black-bear-attack-in-wisconsin-8714958), the pair climbed down from the stand to hunt for the wounded bear. According to the [People report](https://people.com/boy-12-saves-dad-from-black-bear-attack-in-wisconsin-8714958) on the situation, there wasn't a blood trail, which resulted in the two utilizing a neighbor's hunting dog to track down their target. The dog found the bear, with the two hunters then spotting it about six feet away while moving through a thicket. According to a Today [report](https://www.yahoo.com/news/wisconsin-12-old-saves-dads-090625940.html), that's when the bear charged. [People](https://people.com/boy-12-saves-dad-from-black-bear-attack-in-wisconsin-8714958) notes that the father, Ryan, fired eight shots at the animal from a sidearm, but missed. The 200-pound bear ultimately landed on top of Ryan, who found himself in a desperate fight for his life. He was being slashed and bitten by the animal, later expressing that he didn't think he would survive. At that point, the son, Owen, fired a shot from his rifle at the bear that was mauling his father, killing the animal. The [Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources](https://www.today.com/parents/wisconsin-bear-attack-son-saves-dad-rcna171761) later confirmed the story and noted that the hunt was legal. It's clear that this scary situation could have resulted in two human deaths had the young hunter not been quick to react and accurate with his shot. It serves as a reminder for hunters to never underestimate the power and aggression of a wounded animal. \"I told my wife I was done bear hunting,\" said the father after the incident, according to the [Today report](https://www.today.com/parents/wisconsin-bear-attack-son-saves-dad-rcna171761).",

    "text": "A significant event at the expo is the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between SolarfiX India and Kanemasa Japan.Informa Markets in India has launched the 17th Renewable Energy India (REI) Expo at the India Expo Centre, Greater Noida, alongside the 2nd edition of The Battery Show India. The event, taking place from October 3 to 5, 2024, aims to enhance collaboration and innovation across the renewable energy, battery storage, and electric vehicle industries.The co-located REI Expo and The Battery Show India also feature several key highlights and sessions. These include the CEO and CTO Conclaves, the Bio Energy Pavilion supported by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India, and an Investor Zone in partnership with T-Hub (Government of Telangana), where sector entrepreneurs will pitch their business ideas to investors.A significant event at the expo is the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between SolarfiX India and Kanemasa Japan. This collaboration aims to introduce an innovative SRA tracker technology for Agri-PV applications in India, which is projected to boost PV plant generation by 125 per cent to 150%, thereby reducing the cost per unit of power. The Indian Biogas Association also expects to announce investments worth Rs 1600 crores in the biogas sector during the show.Who all attended it?Key dignitaries at the inauguration included Heera Lal Nagar, Minister of State, Energy Department, Government of Rajasthan; Manu Srivastava, Additional Chief Secretary, Power and Renewable Energy Department, Government of Madhya Pradesh; Shantanu Jaiswal, Head of India Research, Bloomberg NEF; Alex Whitworth, Vice President & Head of Asia Pacific Power & Renewables Research, Wood Mackenzie; Peter Hall, President, IMETA Region, Informa Markets; Yogesh Mudras, Managing Director, Informa Markets in India; and Rajneesh Khattar, Sr. Group Director, Energy portfolio, Informa Markets in India.The \\\"Advantage Rajasthan\\\" session, led by Heera Lal Nagar, engaged attendees by showcasing Rajasthan's initiatives and plans in the renewable energy sector.Heera Lal Nagar spoke about Rajasthan's significant contribution to India's renewable energy targets set by the Prime Minister. \\\"Rajasthan plays a pivotal role in driving India’s renewable energy ambitions, contributing significantly towards the nation's 500 GW target, set by our Prime Minister. With its expansive desert areas now harnessed for solar and wind power, Rajasthan has transformed its geographic challenges into an energy boon. Currently, the state produces 20,000 MW of solar energy, using only 5,000 MW locally, while the rest is supplied across the country. Additionally, we have taken steps to further scale this, with planned investments of ₹5 lakh crores in the energy sector over the next 4-5 years.\\\"He elaborated on Rajasthan’s innovative energy projects which integrate solar, battery storage, and grid operations, positioning the state as a leader in energy production and distribution. \\\"We are working on tenders for 1,000 MW of rooftop solar and strengthening our grid and transmission systems, ensuring sustainable growth for both Rajasthan and the nation.\\\"Manu Srivastava, Additional Chief Secretary, Power and Renewable Energy Department, Government of Madhya Pradesh, highlighted India’s progress in the renewable energy sector and the importance of cost competitiveness. \\\"India’s renewable energy sector has made tremendous strides, with the Rewa, Madhya Pradesh project marking a key moment by reducing solar energy costs below coal without subsidies. Now, the focus is on proving that solar plus storage can outperform thermal power in cost-effectiveness.Solar projects Current tenders for both thermal and solar plus storage projects are testing this, with a large-scale 600 MW solar and 880 MWh battery project designed to provide a steady tariff across 24 hours. This model, supported by insights from Berkeley University, optimizes battery performance through two daily charge-discharge cycles—using solar energy for evening peaks and grid power to charge overnight for morning peaks.Globally, electricity’s share in final energy demand is projected to rise from 20 per cent to 31 per cent by 2050, and in a net-zero scenario, it must exceed 50%. For India, developing both its fossil fuel and electric economies is critical to meet rising demand. Shifting agricultural power to daytime and offering discounts for daytime energy usage further optimize solar power deployment. With solar now a core part of India’s energy mix, integrating storage is essential for driving economic growth and ensuring energy sustainability.\\\"Alex Whitworth, Vice President & Head of Asia Pacific Power & Renewables Research, Wood Mackenzie, emphasized India's growing importance in the global energy transition. \\\"India's role in the global energy transition is becoming increasingly prominent as its economy has overtaken the UK, surpassed France, and is on track to overtake major markets like Germany and Japan within the next five to ten years. With a GDP growth of 7 per cent and power demand rising by over 8 per cent this year, India is now the third-largest power market globally, and its energy demand is set to triple by 2050, making it a critical investment destination.Renewable energy Renewables are expanding rapidly, with over 200 GW of solar and wind capacity expected by 2030. India's emergence as the second-largest solar module manufacturer, exporting to key global markets, highlights its potential. However, 70 per cent of India's power still comes from coal, with 50 GW of coal and 10 GW of nuclear expected by 2030. In a net-zero scenario, electrification would need to exceed 50%, a crucial focus for India as it balances its development of fossil fuel and electric economies in parallel to meet its growing energy demands. The country must address challenges in energy storage, grid infrastructure, and renewable deployment, while leveraging its domestic market and global partnerships to drive a low-carbon future.\\\"Shantanu Jaiswal, Head of India Research, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (NEF), underscored the urgency of the global energy transition due to rising global temperatures. \\\"The year 2023 marked an unprecedented climate milestone, for the first time, global surface temperatures exceeded 2°C above pre-industrial levels for several days. What’s more concerning is that greenhouse gas emissions have not yet peaked, indicating that global temperatures will continue to rise for decades. In response to these challenges, there is a growing global focus on energy transition. India is at the forefront of this transition, with estimates from Bloomberg India suggesting that by 2030, the country will have more solar and wind projects than coal power plants.Battery energy storage systemsThe intermittency of renewable energy presents a significant challenge, making battery energy storage systems (BESS) essential for ensuring grid stability and enhancing renewable integration. Global energy demand is projected to triple, increasing from 1.8 terawatt hours to over 5 terawatt hours by 2050, primarily due to advancements in storage technology. Batteries play a crucial role not only in the power sector but also in transportation. India’s electric mobility sector is growing rapidly, with major automakers establishing battery assembly plants and leveraging the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to create 50 gigawatt hours of battery manufacturing capacity.Demand for lithium-ion batteries is anticipated to rise from 10 gigawatt hours today to 200 gigawatt hours by 2035, fueled by the electric vehicle market and grid-scale storage needs. The synergy between Renewable Energy India and The Battery Show India serve as a catalyst for achieving interim energy transition goals and will accelerate the momentum towards a greener future.\\\"Yogesh Mudras, Managing Director, Informa Markets in India, highlighted India's commitment to its COP26 goals and the importance of renewable energy in the country's future. \\\"The Renewable Energy India Expo 2024, alongside The Battery Show India, highlights the nation’s progressive alignment with its COP26 commitments, reflecting India's dedication to reducing carbon emissions and increasing renewable energy. With a goal to reduce carbon intensity by 45 per cent by 2030, the expo highlighted the critical role of renewables. Key advancements include the approval of 50 solar parks with a total capacity of 37.49 GW, alongside ambitious targets of producing 5 million tons of green hydrogen and achieving a 30 GW offshore wind energy capacity by 2030.Battery Show IndiaThe Battery Show India spotlighted the country’s growing battery storage market, which is set to expand by 47 GW by 2031-32. India’s strides in domestic lithium-ion battery production were particularly noteworthy, with production capacity expected to reach 150 gigawatt hours by 2030, covering 13 per cent of total cell demand. These developments, showcased at the events, demonstrate the shows’ influence and India’s commitment to a sustainable and resilient energy ecosystem.\\\"Venugopal Shanbhag, Executive Director – Grindwell Norton Ltd, discussed technological advancements in battery solutions. \\\"With our advanced battery pack solutions, we are geared towards addressing the fundamental challenges of cell swelling, thermal management, IP67 sealing, and thermal runaway for longevity, safety, and efficiency. Our vision-driven approach fuels our R&D investments, focused on sustainable manufacturing and extended battery life for a resilient future.\\\"",

    "title": "What the White House Did to Navigate Joe Biden’s Health Issues",
    "text": "Inside Joe Biden’s Health: How the White House Managed His Decline\nThe Wall Street Journal has revealed troubling details about Joe Biden’s health and how the White House has adapted to manage his presidency. According to the report titled “How the White House Functioned With a Diminished Biden in Charge,” aides have employed various measures to compensate for the president’s mental and physical limitations. These findings have ignited debates about transparency and governance at the highest level.\nStrategies to Manage Joe Biden’s Health The report highlights several strategies used by aides to navigate Joe Biden’s health concerns and ensure the continuity of his presidency:\nControlled Access: The president’s engagements were strictly limited to prevent overburdening him, with only essential staff or officials allowed access. Scripting Public Interactions: Public events were heavily scripted, with pre-approved questions provided to donors and participants to minimize risks of mistakes. Shortened Schedules: Meetings and public appearances were deliberately kept brief. If the president was having an off day, meetings were rescheduled entirely. Stage Guidance: Aides provided repeated instructions on basic actions, such as where to enter and exit stages during events. Voice Coaching: A Hollywood executive hired a voice coach to help improve Biden’s vocal clarity as his voice weakened over time. Early Signs of Decline Concerns about Joe Biden’s health reportedly surfaced early in his presidency. By spring 2021, aides noticed that extended meetings often resulted in fatigue and mistakes. On one occasion, a national security meeting was canceled due to the president being unable to perform effectively.\nOne former aide recalled an instance where a senior official explained, “He has good days and bad days, and today was a bad day so we’re going to address this tomorrow.”\nThe Impact on Transparency The revelations have sparked significant debates about the transparency of Joe Biden’s health. Critics argue that the administration’s handling of these issues undermines public trust. Conversely, supporters highlight his experience and focus on his policy accomplishments, asserting that his team has effectively mitigated any challenges.\nThe disconnect between public-facing narratives and insider reports has led to increased skepticism about the White House’s honesty regarding Biden’s condition.\nChallenges in Governance The presidency demands sharp decision-making and endurance. While the measures implemented by aides have minimized risks, some moments of governance have drawn scrutiny. For instance, the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan has been cited as a situation where Biden’s limitations may have played a role.\nJoe Biden’s Health and Leadership Debate At 81, Joe Biden is the oldest sitting U.S. president in history. His tenure has reignited discussions about the role of age in leadership. Proposals for mandatory health and fitness tests have gained momentum, although critics argue that such measures could lead to age discrimination. The debate highlights the tension between valuing experience and ensuring capability.\nWhat This Means for 2024 The Wall Street Journal report reveals that Biden intended to seek re-election and serve until 2029. This ambition raises serious concerns about his ability to endure another term. As the 2024 election approaches, voters will inevitably consider his health and capability alongside his policy record and vision for the country.\nThe revelations about Joe Biden’s health have brought renewed attention to the challenges of leadership at an advanced age. While his aides have worked diligently to manage his presidency, the details from the Wall Street Journal underscore the importance of transparency and accountability in governance. As the nation prepares for the next presidential election, these issues will remain central to discussions about leadership, capability, and the expectations placed on the highest office in the land.\nFor more updates, refer to the original Wall Street Journal report.",

    "text": "Terence Crawford y Canelo Álvarez se preparan para una gran pelea en las 168 libras. El mundo del boxeo no puede esperar para ver a estos dos campeones frente a frente.\nMuchos aficionados y expertos creen que el tamaño y la potencia de Canelo serán demasiado para Crawford. Después de todo, Crawford acaba de subir de categoría de peso. Pero otros creen que las habilidades y la inteligencia de Crawford en el ring le ayudarán a ganar.\nEl entrenador del Salón de la Fama, Ronnie Shields, cree que Crawford tiene lo que hace falta para vencer a Canelo. Dice que Crawford debería seguir el plan de juego de Floyd Mayweather de 2013 cuando venció a Canelo.\n\"Floyd siguió pisando a su alrededor. Cada vez que Canelo trataba de presionar, Floyd lo rodeaba, y Canelo tenía que reiniciarse. Crawford puede hacer lo mismo. Perfeccionará ese movimiento y mantendrá a Canelo a la defensiva\".\nShields señala que el peso natural de Crawford ronda las 180 libras, por lo que no tendrá problemas para llegar a las 168. Pero Canelo suele pesar 190 o más. Pero Canelo suele pesar 190 o más, por lo que tendrá que trabajar duro para bajar al peso de la pelea.\n\"Crawford tiene las habilidades para pelear con cualquiera en el mundo. No se trata de potencia. Si tienes las habilidades, es difícil para cualquiera\".\nShields cree que el juego de piernas de Crawford y sus constantes movimientos serán la clave. Tendrá que ser más astuto que Canelo y mantenerlo a la expectativa.\nPor supuesto, Canelo no es el mismo boxeador que era cuando Mayweather le venció. Shields lo reconoce:\n\"Ahora es un guerrero experimentado. No es el mismo que era cuando Floyd peleó contra él\".\nTerence Crawford suelta una bomba sobre el papel de Floyd Mayweather en el combate Davis-Roach: \"No es inocente\"\nLa pelea aún no está fijada, pero los aficionados al boxeo ya hablan de ella. ¿Serán suficientes las habilidades de Crawford para superar el tamaño y la potencia de Canelo? Tendremos que esperar para verlo.",

    "text": "La Junta de los prestigiosos\n Premios Pulitzer otorgó en su 108.ª edición una mención especial a “la valiente labor” de los periodistas palestinos que cubren la guerra en Gaza desde el pasado 7 de octubre, así como hacia sus compañeros fallecidos mientras informaban de dicho conflicto.\n“Este año, se reconoce la valiente labor de los\nperiodistas y trabajadores de los medios de comunicación que cubren la guerra en Gaza. En condiciones espantosas, un número extraordinario de periodistas han muerto en el esfuerzo por contar la historia de los palestinos y los trabajadores humanitarios en Gaza”, detalló la organización este lunes durante la retransmisión virtual de estos galardones.\nLos Premios Pulitzer, entregados por la Universidad de Columbia\n (Nueva York) a lo más selecto del periodismo, los libros, el teatro y la música, expresaron este lunes que anteriormente ya habían reconocido el trabajo de periodistas en guerras como la de Ucrania o Afganistán y que esta mención especial va más allá por su eco en otros campos.\nLEA TAMBIÉN:\n[La FIP condena la muerte de 109 periodistas en Gaza desde octubre]\nLEA TAMBIÉN:\n[Dos premios Pulitzer para la fotografía]\n“Esta guerra (Gaza) también se ha cobrado la vida de poetas y escritores (...) Con la entrega de los Premios Pulitzer a las categorías de Periodismo, Artes y Letras conmemoramos la pérdida de valiosísimos testimonios en primera línea que ilustran el sufrimiento humano”, concluyó el comunicado de la Junta.\nEntre todos los premios en categorías periodísticas de los Pulitzer, la guerra en Gaza también estuvo presente en otros apartados como el que condecora a lo mejor del periodismo internacional.\nEn esta categoría, el premio recayó sobre la redacción de The New York Times por su “amplia y reveladora” cobertura del “ataque letal” de una facción del grupo islamista Hamás en el sur de Israel el 7 de octubre, así como por sus informaciones sobre “los fallos de los servicios de inteligencia israelíes y la mortífera respuesta del Ejército israelí en Gaza”.\nPor otra parte, la mención especial a los periodistas palestinos estuvo acompañada por otro reconocimiento de este mismo tipo al escritor y periodista estadounidense Greg Tate (1957-2021), todo un icono desde el entorno de los medios de comunicación de la cultura afroamericana.\n“Su lenguaje, procedente de la literatura, el mundo académico, la cultura popular y el hip hop, fue tan influyente como el contenido de sus ideas. Sus innovaciones estéticas y su originalidad intelectual, especialmente en su crítica pionera del hip hop, siguieron influyendo en las generaciones posteriores, sobre todo en los escritores y críticos de color”, explicó la organización.\nTe puede interesar\nHamás acepta propuesta de tregua en Gaza mientras Israel se alista a invadir Rafah La Unesco alerta de que los ataques contra periodistas crecen durante las elecciones Reconocer Estado palestino, posible solución a guerra en Gaza\nComienza a destacar en el mundo empresarial recibiendo las noticias más exclusivas del día en tu bandeja\n[Aquí].

    "text": "It may seem like it’s always been a part of America, but July 30 was Medicare’s 59th birthday. We should pause, celebrate its success and commit to stopping the corporations who are pilfering it for their own profits. Health care in the United States remains unaffordable and inaccessible despite costing Americans $4.7 trillion a year. Medical costs are the leading cause of personal bankruptcy for Americans, and the problem is even more dire among seniors. Those older than age 55 represent 31% of our country but account for 55% of health care spending. When Medicare was signed into law 59 years ago in Independence, it offered the hope that our population’s elderly and disabled could access health care and age with dignity. It’s lived up to that promise for generations now. The attack on Medicare began in the 1970s with a proposal to turn the nation’s best public health program over to profit-centric corporations and privatize Medicare. The false premise was that the free market would create competition that could drive down health care costs and turn a profit for the investment community. That strategy works in many parts of the economy, but not in health care. Health care by nature cannot be a free market good. It isn’t like purchasing a cell phone where you can identify prices, compare specs of different models, read reviews and ultimately choose to walk away if you don’t like the options. Patients don’t wake up in the morning and choose to take medications because they want to, but because they need to. Health care emergencies like heart attacks and strokes don’t afford patients or their families the luxury to price shop, compare facilities or reviews. Health care can only turn a profit at the expense of quality care. This is exactly what so-called Medicare Advantage (“MA”) plans have demonstrated every year since their creation in 2003. MA corporations restrict access to care through small networks, ghost networks, limited out of network coverage, and referral requirements for specialty care — none of which exist in Traditional Medicare. MA plans typically refuse access to more than half of the physicians in a community, sometimes excluding up to 70% of providers, and cover only half of hospitals in a county. Because these plans force patients with many types of cancer to delay their care and block them from going to “Centers of Excellence”, these critically ill patients are more likely to die after their cancer surgery than similar patients in traditional Medicare. No one warns patients about these barriers to care, and in fact MA plans grossly mislead people about what they cover. MA network directories frequently include providers who are retired, deceased or simply don’t exist. These limitations are even worse for those living in rural areas where access is already limited. Even when patients go to in-network providers, they are then faced with prior authorizations and claims denials that further delay access to care. In 2018 the Office of Inspector General (OIG) published a report showing 75% of appealed claims denied by MA plans were overturned on first repeal. Analysis by KFF found that in 2021, 82% of appealed denials were approved. These high successful repeal rates suggest that many of the denials should have never happened in the first place. Unfortunately, the appeals system for claims denials is so convoluted that only 1-6% of claims are ever attempted to be appealed, allowing companies to reap massive profits just by denying care. These coverage restrictions have also extended to physician administered medications; in reviewing the 20 most commonly prescribed medications between 12-17 of 20 had access restricted with prior authorizations in 2018. By 2020, CVS/Aetna and Humana only retained four of the 20 most commonly used physician administered medications on their formularies, Kaiser covered 6 and United Healthcare covered only 2. One of the shiny selling points for an MA plan over traditional Medicare plans is the inclusion of vision, hearing and dental benefits that aren’t part of traditional Medicare, but on closer look most of these plans have dollar limits that result in thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs, making it hard to see much true benefit. With all the harms noted for MA plans over traditional Medicare plans, one might expect that if the plan were truly bad in a free market, patients would switch away from MA plans. Unfortunately, consumers don’t get a choice, since health care is not a true free-market commodity. Those with higher health care needs do in fact switch out of MA plans at significant rates, but this option isn’t accessible to everyone. Protections against pre-existing conditions in pricing of Medigap policies only exist for the first 6-12 months in most states, including Missouri. Switching out of MA plans after the first year can be cost prohibitive, trapping patients in a vicious cycle of care delays and denials. The experiment of privatization of Medicare is a failed one. In addition to the actual patient harms that have come from privatized Medicare, MA plans are inefficient, have high administrative burden and more costly to taxpayers. The government pays more per person in MA plans than in TM plans, at a conservative estimate of 140 billion dollars a year in excess payments. If that money instead went towards improving traditional Medicare, we could eliminate the need for people in traditional Medicare to purchase Medigap (a $5,000 out-of-pocket maximum would cost $39 billion); we could include hearing, dental, vision for everyone in Medicare and Medicaid ($84 billion), or free people from having to pay a premium for Medicare Part B ($131 billion). For its 59th birthday this year, let’s protect Medicare from the corporate raiders, call for an end to the subsidies and make the best thing (Medicare) even better.",
