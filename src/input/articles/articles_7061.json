    "text": "NEWS RELEASE CONNOR MAHON Connor Mahon and Friends: Concert in support of the Children’s Foundation of Guelph & Wellington will be held on March 10, 2024, 3 p.m., at St. George’s Anglican Church in Guelph. Connor Mahon is passionate about two things: playing music, and sharing music with others. The young Guelph pianist has become a feature in the Guelph musical community, regularly contributing to fundraising performances. Now, in his first solo recital since before the pandemic, Connor is once again partnering with the Children’s Foundation of Guelph and Wellington to raise funds for their Free to Grow Program, which provides funding for kids’ extracurricular activities. “It’s something that’s really important to me,” says Connor. “Every kid should get to have music lessons, or play sports. Whatever they are interested in.” “Understandably it’s a cause very close to our hearts,” adds Connor’s mom, Alexis Hoy. “Kids are capable of amazing things, given the opportunity to explore their talents. The Free to Grow Program helps more kids do just that.” The concert program will include works by Chopin, Prokofiev, and Gershwin among others. A composer in his own right, Connor will also perform some of his own award-winning compositions. For part of the program, Connor will be joined on stage by 13-year-old violinist Salma Khakimov, and 12-year-old cellist Ryan Yin, the members of the top-ranked Sacora Trio, for which Connor is the pianist. “We love seeing children and youth in our community come together like this,” says Megan Harron, Free to Grow Program Director at the Children’s Foundation of Guelph and Wellington. “Our Free to Grow Program helps nurture the physical, social, emotional, and mental well-being of children and youth by providing them funding to participate in activities, like music and the arts, recreation, and life skills activities. Seeing young folks like Connor using their skills and passion to raise awareness and funds to help other children and youth inspires us to do what we do. Together, alongside kids like Connor, we are empowering young people to thrive!” Tickets for the concert are $15 - 25, and available through [eventbrite.ca](http://eventbrite.ca/) or [connormahon.com](http://connormahon.com/).",

    "text": "WASHINGTON — Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that the Supreme Court's decision on a case centered around Idaho's total near abortion ban could further endanger abortion access. It’s a crime in Idaho to terminate a pregnancy unless the mother’s life is at risk or in cases of rape or incest, if the assaults had been reported to law enforcement and copies of the reports are provided to the abortion providers. The Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments that Idaho’s ban violates the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The law prevents hospitals from turning patients away if they couldn’t pay. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe, the Biden administration said it would be using the law to make sure pregnant women in emergency situations get the care they need, even if that includes abortion. “The MAGA Supreme Court majority appears ready to rule that the right to ‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness’ doesn’t extend to women with pregnancy complications or who otherwise need abortions,” Clinton wrote on X , formerly Twitter. “This is horrifying, and it is because of Donald Trump.” Clinton shared a map that shows time zones of different states in a follow up tweet, with Arizona being “1864,” which is when the state implemented the near-total abortion ban. The House narrowly voted to repeal the ban Wednesday. “We won’t allow our daughters and granddaughters to grow up with fewer rights than we had,” Clinton wrote on X. Contributing: Mary Jo Pitzl",

While Tesla stocks have soared high, adding a couple of billion dollars to his net worth, his pet project ‘X’ is paying the price.\nAccording to news reports, over 115,000 US users have deactivated their X accounts.\nIt is important to note that this figure only covers deactivations done through the website, leaving the mobile app suggesting an even higher count.\nThis exodus is a reaction to Musk's significant involvement in the election. Musk spent months using X to openly support Trump's campaign, leading to backlash from users.\nAs per the news reports, many have moved to Bluesky, an alternative social media platform, which has doubled its user base to 15 million within 90 days. According to Similarweb, Bluesky gained a million new sign-ups in just one week after the elections, the report added.\nThe Guardian, with over 80 accounts and around 27 million followers on X, is one of the biggest organisations to exit the platform. This move is part of a larger trend where users and organisations are rethinking their presence on X due to Musk's political influence.",

We have stood by them since the beginning of the matter and we will continue to extend all consular and legal assistance. We will also continue to take up the matter with the Qatari authorities,” said MEA in an official statement.\nALSO READ India Demands Extradition Of 26/11 Terror Attack Mastermind Hafiz Saeed From Pakistan\nImage\nThe eight former Indian Navy personnel were employees of Dahra Global, a Doha-based private defence services provider. They were arrested in August 2022 for espionage. India called the ruling deeply shocking and deployed all diplomatic channels to engage with Qatar on this case.\nCommander Purnendu Tiwari, Commander Sugunakar Pakala, Commander Amit Nagpal, Commander Sanjeev Gupta, Captain Navtej Singh Gill, Captain Birendra Kumar Verma, Captain Saurabh Vasisht and Sailor Ragesh Gopakumar were arrested in August 22.\nEarlier this month, MEA informed that two hearings have taken place in the case. “There have been two hearings. We filed an appeal, with the families, and the detainees had a final appeal. Two hearings have since been held. One was on November 30th and the other was on November 23rd. I think the next hearing is coming up soon,” Bagchi said.",

Coined as “Gameified Green Staking,” the project articulates a holistic design philosophy that accentuates exponential rewards and the potential for token bonuses reaching up to 100%. This innovative approach, described by the team as a fusion of Bitcoin’s legacy and Ethereum’s environmentally conscious blockchain, has garnered significant interest. The design philosophy is transparent and intuitive, presenting a unique staking model intricately linked to Bitcoin’s price movements while prioritizing minimal environmental impact. The process involves staking GBTC, connected to Bitcoin’s price predictions, with subsequent claims following the conclusion of the staking period. As a Proof-of-Stake network with a mere 35 Wh of energy usage, Green Bitcoin distinguishes itself with significantly lower energy consumption compared to other networks, including BTC, BTC Cash, and BTC SV. Furthermore, the platform incorporates engaging features such as weekly prediction challenges, ensuring sustained audience participation. Integral to the success of any staking platform is the Annual Percentage Yield (APY), and Green Bitcoin excels in this regard. Currently boasting an APY of 521%, it presents a highly promising outlook for the future. Shifting to presale details, it’s essential to highlight an affiliate signup bonus of 15%.
