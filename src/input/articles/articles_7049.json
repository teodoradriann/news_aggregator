    "text": "In occasione della Giornata Internazionale contro il lavoro minorile, la Centrale Sindacale Unitaria di San Marino rilancia il comunicato dell’Organizzazione Internazionale del Lavoro (OIL) e dell’UNICEF, che denuncia come siano ancora 138 milioni i bambini coinvolti nel lavoro minorile, di cui 54 milioni in condizioni pericolose.\nL’Africa resta l’area più colpita con 87 milioni di minori sfruttati, mentre l’Asia e il Pacifico registrano un significativo calo. La CSU, presente alla 113ª sessione dell’OIL a Ginevra con Simona Zonzini, sottolinea l’urgenza di protezione sociale, istruzione gratuita e lavoro dignitoso per gli adulti. “I bambini devono poter studiare, giocare ed essere protetti. Nessuna giustificazione può legittimare lo sfruttamento dell’infanzia”.",

    "title": "Bangkok Post - Sri Lanka debt overhaul harms older women",
    "text": "After defaulting on its foreign loans in early 2022, the Sri Lankan government agreed to restructure both its external and domestic debt, as required by its bailout agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The adjustment has had dire consequences for the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), the country's largest superannuation fund, which covers nearly 60% of the private-sector and semi-government workforce.In September, the Central Bank of Sri Lank (CBSL) announced that the EPF had two options for its portfolio of treasury bonds under the domestic debt restructuring plan. The first was to increase the tax rate applied to the EPF's investment income to 30% -- more than double the current rate of 14%. The second was to exchange the treasury bonds for new ones with lower interest rates of 12% per year until 2026 and 9% after that, a sharp drop from the current average rate of more than 20%. The CBSL's Monetary Board opted for the latter, although both scenarios would have shrunk retirement savings significantly.While this is bad news for all elderly Sri Lankans, who are already the country's poorest group, it will disproportionately hurt older women. To be sure, they receive fewer benefits, given that the EPF caters to workers in formal employment, and women's participation in the labour market has consistently remained low, at 30-35%, over the last few decades. But even women without direct access to these savings often rely on them indirectly because they are financially dependent on men or collect their deceased spouse's benefits. More importantly, the feminisation of ageing has lengthened the retirement period for Sri Lanka's women, who not only live six years longer than the country's men but are also eligible to claim their benefits under the EPF at age 50, whereas men must wait until age 55.This matters because, as a defined contribution plan, the EPF provides the mandatory contributions paid by employers and employees, together with accumulated interest, as a lump sum at retirement. In 2021, the EPF paid an average benefit of around US$2,000 (71,430 baht) -- equivalent to only four years of average consumption per person. Women must, therefore, stretch this already inadequate amount over more years than men. And with lower bond yields, workers will receive an even smaller lump sum.This shows the threat domestic debt restructuring poses to women's income security and economic dependence in old age. It also highlights the importance of safeguarding pension funds to ensure the welfare of elderly people more generally. Instead of treating all treasury bonds equally, Sri Lanka's restructuring plan targeted those held by retirement funds (as opposed to financial institutions or private stakeholders). Moreover, EPF beneficiaries could not push back against this policy as neither employees nor employers have a say in the fund's management.To improve transparency, the EPF board must be restructured to ensure that member interests are represented in the decision-making process. After all, beneficiaries bear the risk of mismanagement. Employers and employees of both genders could hold the board accountable for its investment portfolio, 93.4% of which was in rupee loans, treasury bonds, and treasury bills in 2020, and resist changes that reduce their retirement savings.The law that established the EPF should be changed to make the retirement age the same for men and women and to establish crediting mechanisms for periods of childcare. Sri Lanka should also spur more competition in the retirement fund market, which would give beneficiaries more choices and, in turn, encourage more service-oriented fund management. Finally, individuals should be given a greater say in managing their pensions. In the long term, ensuring the economic welfare of older women in Sri Lanka requires thoughtful and adequately financed measures to improve their access to formal-sector employment. ©2024 Project SyndicateNisha Arunatilake, Director of Research at the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka, is a research fellow at the Partnership for Economic Policy.",

    "text": "Introducing 3CHI’s Platinum Delta 8 Disposable Vapes: Unmatched Purity and Potency in the World of Delta 8 THC\nAs the industry leader in hemp-derived cannabinoid products, 3CHI has once again set the bar high with the launch of its Platinum Delta 8 disposable vapes. These revolutionary vapes offer the ultimate combination of purity, potency, and premium hardware, setting a new standard for Delta 8 THC vaping experiences.\nState-of-the-Art Isolation Techniques\nAt the heart of 3CHI’s Platinum Delta 8 disposable vapes is the most refined Delta 8 THC oil ever produced. By utilizing state-of-the-art isolation techniques, our team of experienced scientists has achieved a remarkable 99%+ delta 8 THC purity level. This breakthrough in Delta 8 THC production allows for the cleanest and most effective vaping experience possible.\nIn addition to the ultra-pure delta 8 THC oil, 3CHI’s Platinum Delta 8 disposable vapes are the first to have all cannabinoids identified, further showcasing our commitment to quality, transparency, and consumer trust.\nAdvanced Hardware for Customized Vaping Experiences\n3CHI’s Platinum Delta 8 disposable vapes feature advanced hardware designed to deliver the perfect vaping experience for each user. The 2ml disposable vape pens come equipped with a preheat setting and three variable voltage heat settings, allowing you to tailor your vaping session to your individual preferences. The adjustable heat settings ensure that you can achieve the optimal balance of flavor, vapor production, and desired effects.\nAvailable in Three Unique Strain Options\nTo cater to a diverse range of tastes and preferences, 3CHI’s Platinum Delta 8 disposable vapes are available in three carefully selected strain options:\n- Skywalker (Indica): Ideal for those seeking relaxation and stress relief, Skywalker is an Indica-dominant strain known for its soothing effects. As you vape, you’ll experience a sense of calm and tranquility that helps to melt away tension and promote a state of deep relaxation.\n- White Runtz (Hybrid): For those who want the best of both worlds, White Runtz is a balanced hybrid strain that offers a harmonious blend of calming and uplifting properties. This versatile strain provides the perfect mix of relaxation and invigoration, making it an excellent choice for any time of day.\n- Strawberry Cough (Sativa): If you’re looking for a burst of energy and creativity, Strawberry Cough is a Sativa-dominant strain that stimulates and uplifts. With its vibrant, fruity flavor profile and mood-enhancing effects, this strain is perfect for promoting a sense of euphoria and stimulating creative thought.\nConsistency and Quality: The Hallmarks of 3CHI’s Platinum Delta 8 Vapes\nOne of the key benefits of\n3CHI‘s Platinum vapes is the exceptional consistency and quality of the products. By utilizing the groundbreaking D-SPEC testing method, we can accurately measure and control the concentrations of delta 8 THC, delta 4(8)-iso-THC, and delta 9 THC in our products. This precise measurement and control ensure that each batch of Platinum Delta 8 vapes delivers consistent effects and performance.\nFor consumers who rely on hemp-derived products for relief, consistency is crucial. With D-SPEC’s advanced testing capabilities, 3CHI’s Platinum Delta 8 disposable vapes represent a monumental leap forward in the formulation of effective and reliable cannabis products.\nSuperior to GC/MS and Traditional HPLC Methods\nIn addition to\nthird-party testing, 3CHI’s Platinum Delta 8 disposable vapes are tested internally using the D-SPEC method, which is more reliable than the traditional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and older high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods. GC/MS, though a better option than older HPLC methods, has the potential to convert THC isomers at high temperatures required for testing. The D-SPEC method resolves ∆4(8)-iso-THC from ∆8-THC and ∆9-THC peaks on the chromatogram using HPLC, making it an incredibly accurate way to determine delta 8 THC concentrations, delta 4(8)-iso-THC concentrations, delta 9 THC concentrations, and legal compliance of a product.\nThis advanced testing method ensures that 3CHI’s Platinum Delta 8 disposable vapes meet the highest standards of quality, safety, and legal compliance. D-SPEC testing also addresses the issue of inaccurate testing reports in the hemp industry, particularly for vape products. By accurately separating the peaks of ∆4(8)-iso-THC, ∆8-THC, and ∆9-THC, D-SPEC eliminates both overestimations and underestimations of ∆9-THC content in hemp products, ensuring that truly compliant products are correctly identified and that non-compliant products are not misrepresented as compliant.\nThe Future of Delta 8 THC Vaping\n3CHI’s Platinum Delta 8 disposable vapes represent the future of Delta 8 THC vaping, offering unmatched purity, potency, and advanced hardware for a truly exceptional vaping experience. With three unique strain options, customizable heat settings, and a commitment to quality and consistency backed by the revolutionary D-SPEC testing method, 3CHI’s Platinum Delta 8 disposable vapes are the ultimate choice for discerning consumers seeking the best in delta 8 THC products.\nExperience the purest and most potent Delta 8 vapes ever made with 3CHI’s Platinum Delta 8 disposable vapes.

    "text": "Ruptura de los gobiernos autonómicos de Vox y el PP\nPedro Sánchez celebra la ruptura de los gobiernos de Vox y el PP y avanza una oposición constructiva: \"Es un gran día para España\"\nVox ha decidido romper los gobiernos autonómicos que tenía con el PP y Sánchez ha celebrado la noticia a la par que ha subrayado que \"la estrategia de Feijóo de gobernar con la ultraderecha ha fracasado\".\nPublicidad\n\"Hoy es un gran día para España\", así de optimista ha celebrado Pedro Sánchez la ruptura de los gobiernos autonómicos de Vox y el PP. Desde Washington, y en una rueda de prensa al finalizar la cumbre de la OTAN el presidente ha avanzado que pedirá a Alberto Núñez Feijóo, que derogue las \"contrarreformas\" aprobadas durante este año y además que rompa los pactos con la formación de Santiago Abascal en los ayuntamientos.\nSánchez se ha comprometido a hacer una oposición \"constructiva\". \"Allí donde está el PSOE de oposición ha hecho oposición constructiva siempre. Dependerá de las políticas autonómicas del Gobierno de turno el que cuente con el apoyo, o no, del PSOE\".\nEl líder del Ejecutivo ha subrayado que \"la estrategia de Feijóo de gobernar con la ultraderecha ha fracasado\" y enfatiza: \"Es una gran noticia\". Sánchez ha reconocido que no puede \"ocultar mi alegría, mi felicidad. Los beneficiarios de la salida de la ultraderecha de los gobiernos autonómicos somos todos y sobre todo todas.\"\nAvisa de que en los próximos días habrá mucha \"politiquería\" para interpretar a quién beneficia o perjudica esta nueva situación pero, según ha señalado \"los beneficiarios netos de la salida de la ultraderecha de los gobiernos autonómicos es la mayoría social de españoles y españolas\".\nEso sí, entre esta alegría Sánchez ha querido destacar que esta ha sido\nuna decisión de Vox y no del PP por lo que pide a los de Feijóo que rompa con las políticas que ha aprobado con los de Abascal hasta el día de hoy.\nEn primer lugar le exige que acepte la reforma de la Ley de Extranjería para que el reparto de menores migrantes entre las comunidades autónomas sea obligatorio. Dice que esa sería \"la prueba del algodón\" de que el PP \"ha roto con las políticas de Vox\".\nSánchez ha reiterado que es una gran noticia para los españoles, porque estos gobiernos han aprobado políticas \"ultraderechistas\" en materias como violencia de género, memoria democrática, servicios sociales y calidad de servicios públicos, transición ecológica y también sobre cambio climático, según ha enumerado.\nVox acordó salir de todos los gobiernos autonómicos de coalición con el PP por lo que Abascal ha considerado una \"agresión\" de Alberto Núñez Feijóo al \"obligar\" a las comunidades a aceptar\nel reparto menores migrantes no acompañados.\nSe retira así el partido de Abascal de los ejecutivos de Castilla y León, Aragón, Comunidad Valenciana, Extremadura y Murcia para pasar a ser en estas comunidades una oposición \"leal y contundente\", y rompe el pacto de investidura en Baleares. Abascal ha argumentado que \"es imposible pactar con el que no quiere hacerlo\" y ha acusado a Feijóo de \"imponer políticas de fronteras abiertas\" al tiempo que ha advertido de que \"nadie ha votado\" a Vox ni al PP para que se mantenga la \"invasión\" de emigración ilegal y de menores no acompañados en España.\nSíguenos en nuestro\ncanal de WhatsApp y no te pierdas la última hora y toda la actualidad de antena3noticias.com.\nPublicidad",
