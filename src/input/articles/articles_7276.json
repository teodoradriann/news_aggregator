    "title": "Novartis' Leqvio tackles adherence challenges with simpler treatment for heart patients",
    "text": "Recent guidelines in Korea for high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) patients have shifted, recommending a substantial reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels from 70 mg/dL to below 55 mg/dL—an ambitious target that reflects the growing consensus that \"the lower, the better\" for heart disease prevention. But even with the most advanced statin therapies, many patients are still falling short. “Despite high doses of oral treatments, one-third of patients can’t reach the LDL-C target of 70 ( mg/dL),” said Professor Kim Byeong-keuk of cardiology at Severance Hospital. “With the new target of 55 ( mg/dL), more than 40 percent could still miss the mark.” Professor Kim spoke at an open campus program hosted by Novartis Korea on Thursday, where he offered an overview of Leqvio (ingredient: inclisiran), a first-in-class small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment that gained regulatory approval in Korea this past June. However, Kim stated that the issue of achieving LDL-C targets isn't just about the drugs; it's about patient adherence. “When patients stick to their treatment plans, their outcomes improve dramatically,” Kim explained. “But as regimens become more complicated, adherence falls off. Multiple medications, large pills, and frequent doses all contribute to patients abandoning their treatments.” Adherence isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s a necessity—especially for older patients battling atherosclerosis. Polypharmacy is a growing issue, and as treatment intensifies, so does the challenge of getting patients to stick with it, particularly the elderly, who face additional hurdles in remembering their medications. In Korea, the problem is compounded by a rising number of single-person households, where older adult patients are often left to manage their treatment alone. \"Even with reminders and nurse consultations, compliance remains stubbornly low,\" Kim noted. For chronic conditions that involve multiple risk factors, achieving full control is even harder. According to Kim, that’s why improving adherence is just as critical as developing new medications. “The fewer times patients have to take their medication, the better,” he said. Unlike oral medications, which require frequent doses, Leqvio offers a far simpler regimen—just two injections in the first year, then one every six months after that. For patients, this means near-perfect compliance. \"It’s essentially a guaranteed compliance rate,\" Kim said. \"We’re not just prescribing a drug; we’re delivering a treatment that healthcare providers can ensure was given as intended.\" In a world where even a two-week regimen is prone to missed doses, Kim said Leqvio's biannual injections could be a potential game-changer. When compared to the more frequent dosing required by anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), siRNAs like Leqvio offer a much more favorable adherence profile. \"An injection every six months offers almost perfect adherence,\" Kim said. In Korea, where these treatments are administered directly in healthcare settings, Kim believes adherence could \"realistically reach 100 percent.\" This, he argued, isn't just a minor improvement—it's a significant shift in how we approach cardiovascular care. \"It's essentially a new treatment strategy,\" he said. The phase 3 ORION clinical trials—ORION-9, ORION-10, and ORION-11—showed that Leqvio significantly reduced LDL-C levels in patients with ASCVD or equivalent risk, and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). By Day 510, Leqvio reduced LDL-C by 47.9 percent, 52.3 percent, and 49.9 percent in treatment groups compared to placebo (P<0.001). The more recent ORION-18 trial, conducted with Asian collaborators including Korea, showed similar results. Participants received an injection every three months initially, followed by one every six months. 57.2 percent of participants experienced steady LDL-C reduction, with some exceeding 60 mg/dL. Follow-up results showed that the 50 percent reduction in LDL-C persisted for up to six years, even in those who resumed treatment after a placebo period. For countries like Korea, where insurance typically covers biannual treatments, Kim emphasized that Leqvio represents an ideal solution. \"Over 80 percent of patients who come for outpatient visits only need to come twice a year,\" Kim noted. However, despite the promising results, Korea’s insurance coverage for Leqvio is lagging behind. \"We haven’t even started discussions on insurance coverage,\" Kim said. \"It’s disappointing, especially since this isn’t just about the drug itself. This treatment could define the future of cardiovascular care.\" Related articles [jkim404@docdocdoc.co.kr](mailto:jkim404@docdocdoc.co.kr)",

    "text": "Rovesci molto frequenti e anche forti stanno colpendo buona parte del Paese da domenica scorsa; almeno fino al 20 maggio la situazione non cambierà in modo sostanziale.\nLorenzo Tedici, meteorologo del sito www.iLMeteo.it, conferma altri 10 giorni di instabilità diffusa, ma ci lascia una timida speranza per il weekend della Festa della Mamma. Sia sabato sia domenica il tempo sarà più soleggiato con massime fino a 7°C più alte rispetto ai valori simili-autunnali degli ultimi giorni piovosi.\nAncora piogge Prima del weekend avremo, invece, ancora maltempo: nelle prossime ore sono previsti acquazzoni soprattutto tra Alpi e Prealpi, al Nord-Est e tra Toscana, Umbria e Marche; andrà meglio a sud di una linea immaginaria Viterbo-Teramo: il meridione godrà, infatti, ancora di una giornata in prevalenza stabile.\nVenerdì, invece, cambierà tutto anche al Sud con l’arrivo di una perturbazione che porterà piogge sparse e locali temporali. Le temperature massime saranno perlopiù stazionarie su valori compresi in pianura tra i 19°C di buona parte del Nord, i 22-23°C della Liguria e del Centro-Sud, mentre in Sicilia, nonostante alcuni acquazzoni, continueremo a toccare punte di 26-27°C.\nWeekend\nCome detto, il weekend sarà più soleggiato e più caldo ed avremo un aumento termico anche di 7°C rispetto ai giorni precedenti. Il sole però non dominerà incontrastato: domenica 11 maggio ci saranno frequenti temporali specie nel pomeriggio su tutta la fascia appenninica, sulle Alpi e sulle Prealpi, ma qualche scroscio d’acqua potrebbe invadere anche le pianure adiacenti. Si starà meglio al mare.\nNuova settimana instabile Anche la nuova settimana sarà instabile quasi ovunque: anzi, da lunedì è previsto un graduale peggioramento ad iniziare dal Sud con una perturbazione magrebina: occhi puntati, poi, ancora verso il nord africa tra mercoledì e giovedì, quando è prevista la formazione di un altro ciclone molto potente in Algeria che potrebbe portare nubifragi sulle regioni meridionali, con caratteristiche tropicali, diluvi e colpi di vento.\nAl momento, questo ciclone simil-tropicale è previsto tra una settimana esatta, per il 15 maggio: almeno fino alla fine della seconda decade il tempo non si stabilizzerà.\nNEL DETTAGLIO Giovedì 8. Al Nord: instabile con rovesci e schiarite. Al Centro: alternanza di piogge e schiarite. Al Sud: variabile.\nVenerdì 9. Al Nord: rovesci e schiarite anche ampie. Al Centro: soleggiato. Al Sud: peggioramento con piogge e rovesci.\nSabato 10. Al Nord: soleggiato e più caldo. Al Centro: soleggiato e più caldo. Al Sud: soleggiato e più caldo.\nTendenza: domenica con sole e rovesci, peggiora da lunedì.\nLeggi i commenti I commenti dei lettori",

    "text": "- Plus La Chine soutient les personnes déplacées au Soudan du Sud Le Soudan du Sud a indiqué jeudi que les camions transportant l'aide humanitaire donnée par la Chine pour soutenir les réfugiés et les rapatriés déplacés du Soudan ont commencé à arriver à Juba, capitale du Soudan du Sud. Le ministre des Affaires humanitaires et de la Gestion des catastrophes, Albino Akol Atak, a déclaré que six camions transportant un total de 26.145 feuilles de plastique étaient arrivés à Juba pour aider les rapatriés et les réfugiés. \"Il s'agit d'un don généreux du gouvernement chinois au peuple du Soudan du Sud et d'un résultat de notre engagement avec la communauté internationale et les donateurs pour qu'ils aident le gouvernement et soutiennent les efforts du gouvernement dans ses réponses à l'afflux de réfugiés et de rapatriés qui sont venus à la suite du conflit au Soudan\", a déclaré M. Akol à la presse à Juba. Plus de 460.000 personnes ont déjà été déplacées vers le Soudan du Sud à la suite du conflit soudanais et ont un besoin urgent d'abris, de nourriture et de médicaments dans les centres de transit et dans leur destination finale, a-t-il déclaré. M. Akol a déclaré que le don de la Chine serait utilisé pour abriter les rapatriés et les réfugiés dans les sites de transit et les destinations finales. Il y aura un autre soutien du gouvernement chinois pour les personnes déplacées totalisant 1,4 million de dollars américains, qui sera livré avant la fin du mois de janvier 2024, a-t-il noté.",
