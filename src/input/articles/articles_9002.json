    "text": "Boston Red Sox Achieve Unthinkable Comeback Against Philadelphia Phillies\nThe Boston Red Sox delivered a jaw-dropping performance in their series finale against the Philadelphia Phillies, clawing back from a daunting 6-0 deficit to secure a remarkable 9-8 victory in 11 innings. This stunning comeback not only showcased the resilience of the Red Sox but also etched their name in the annals of Major League Baseball history.\nEarly Struggles\nThe night began ominously for Boston as Lucas Giolito struggled on the mound. Right from the first inning, the Phillies capitalized on his missteps, with Kyle Schwarber and Bryce Harper launching back-to-back home runs. The Phillies continued to exert their dominance, with Nick Castellanos and Bryson Stott adding to the onslaught in the third and fourth innings, respectively. By the end of the fourth, the Red Sox found themselves in a deep hole, trailing 6-0.\nTurning the Tide\nHowever, the spirit of the Red Sox would not be quelled so easily. In the fifth inning, the tide began to turn as Rob Refsynder and Jarren Duran capitalized on the Phillies’ pitching, drawing bases-loaded walks that finally put Boston on the scoreboard. The momentum shifted dramatically when Romy Gonzalez stepped up and delivered a grand slam, propelling the Red Sox into the lead and igniting hopes of a miraculous comeback.\nLate Drama\nAs the game progressed, Aroldis Chapman, tasked with holding the lead, faced a setback in the eighth inning when J.T. Realmuto sent a powerful shot over the fence, tying the game once again and sending the matchup into extra innings. Both teams exchanged blows in the 10th inning, with each scoring a run, intensifying the drama.\nThe climax arrived in the 11th inning when rookie catcher Carlos Narváez stepped to the plate. With precision and power, he launched a two-run homer, providing the Red Sox with crucial insurance runs. Although Johan Rojas managed to knock in an RBI single for the Phillies in the bottom half of the inning, it was too little, too late, as Boston ultimately sealed the thrilling victory.\nA Historic Achievement\nIn the aftermath of this electrifying game, the Red Sox achieved a remarkable feat. According to OptaSTATS, they became the first team in MLB history to strike out at least 15 times, allow five or more home runs, and overcome a deficit of at least five runs to emerge victorious. This unprecedented combination of adversity and triumph has left fans buzzing and added another chapter to the storied legacy of the Boston Red Sox.",

    "text": "Caravana de miles de migrantes denuncia más restricciones tras reunión de AMLO con funcionarios de EU La caravana de migrantes, considerada la más numerosa del año, denunció mayores obstáculos migratorios tras la reunión TAPACHULA.- Este jueves, la caravana de miles de migrantes, que partió de la frontera sur de México y representa la más grande del año, denunció durante su avance restricciones migratorias más estrictas después de la [reunión](https://www.elimparcial.com/mexico/AMLO-destaca-acuerdos-bilaterales-con-EU-sobre-migracion-y-economia-Fue-muy-buena-la-reunion-con-el-secretario-Blinken-20231228-0012.html) entre el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador y autoridades estadounidenses. Los migrantes, provenientes de una veintena de nacionalidades, avanzaron agotados, a paso lento y con heridas en sus pies tras recorrer aproximadamente 35 kilómetros desde Escuintla hasta Mapastepec, donde expresaron su inconformidad por el encuentro de López Obrador con los secretarios estadounidenses de Estado, Antony Blinken, y de Seguridad Nacional, Alejandro Mayorkas. La migración no es ilegal, sino que últimamente los Gobiernos han estado creando demasiados obstáculos, en el caso de los venezolanos, no les dan pasaporte o la visa para viajar a México en avión\", declaró Carlos Ruiz Pineda, un venezolano de 38 años que participa en la caravana.

Por todos los países que vamos cruzando hay mafias, pagos de extorsiones, entonces pareciera que todos fueran mancomunados (fueran cómplices) en los Gobiernos”, lamentó. Mayor control migratorio El Gobierno mexicano aseveró este jueves que ha \"intensificado acciones de control migratorio\" al asegurar que en los últimos días ha superado a Estados Unidos en encuentros de migrantes en la frontera común, según un documento exhibido por López Obrador en su conferencia matutina. Se llegó a un número de migrantes que no se había visto (en diciembre), creo que 10 mil o 12 mil diarios en la frontera norte, y esto llevó a que se cerraran aduanas y los pasos fronterizos del ferrocarril”, reconoció el mandatario. Luis Rey García Villagrán, el coordinador del Centro de Dignificación Humana (CDH), quien acompaña la caravana, denunció que ambos países han planteado endurecer la política migratoria. La caravana se cansa Por otro lado, el presidente acusó a los traficantes de personas de estar detrás de la caravana, además de afirmar que los migrantes de este grupo, que partió en Nochebuena con unas 10 mil personas, ya se han reducido a mil 500. La migrante cubana Yurislady, quien llevaba cinco meses esperando papeles en la frontera sur, señaló que a pesar de que hay cansancio y heridas en los pies seguirán caminando en su travesía en busca de documentos para regular su estancia. Solo queremos libertad, en nuestros países no somos libres, por ahora, el objetivo de muchos de la caravana no es llegar a los Estados Unidos, sino quedarse en México para poder trabajar y tener un mejor futuro porque en Chiapas nos tienen presos\", indicó a EFE. Mientras que García Villagrán aseguró que \"el presidente de la República que está mal informado\". Los que caminamos y vamos a seguir caminando somos 7 mil 500 y vamos a seguir siendo más, porque hay gente en Arriaga, Tonalá, Pijijiapan y personas que vienen de Tapachula y para el lunes próximo serán aproximadamente unas 12 mil migrantes que vamos a ir a la Ciudad de México”, refutó.",

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main)\nFirst tulips of the season bloom amidst winter on P.E.I.\nCold, snowy, and icy. That’s what it looked like in Mount Albion, Prince Edward Island, on Friday.\nBut it was a balmy spring day inside\nVanco Tulips, where as many as 2.5 million flowers grow. It’s the biggest tulip farm in the Atlantic region.\nIf someone from the area has a flower, farmer Bas Arendse said there’s a 95 per cent chance it came from the greenhouse.\n“It’s kind of small miracle that we can do this, and bring spring, the feeling of spring,” said Arendse. “A little bit of hope to the people.”\nThe tulip bulbs start in cold storage, where they’re tricked into thinking it’s winter. There are 20 freezers on site, each holding about 800,000 bulbs.\nRows of tulips are pictured. (Source: Jack Morse/CTV News Atlantic)When it’s time, they’re pulled out and moved into the greenhouse, which is springtime as far as the bulbs know.\nThey grow quickly; it takes only three-to-four weeks for them to be ready to bloom. Workers pull them just before that to give them the longest possible shelf life.\n“As soon as people then take the flowers into a warm area, they’ll start to open up of course,” said Arendse. “Ideally they end up fairly quickly on someone’s kitchen table.”\nIt’s easy to feel like spring working in a bright, warm, 18 degree environment, surrounded by flowers.\nThe tulips head down a conveyer belt where they’re sorted, their bulbs are trimmed, and they’re packaged into bundles of 10. They’re then put back into cold storage until they can be shipped out to retailers.\nThey produce 15 million cut tulips in this greenhouse between the beginning of the season and the end, which is around Mother’s Day.\nThe very first tulip buckets of the season went out to P.E.I. florists on Friday.\n“That feels pretty good, pretty good,” said Vicki Sweeney, florist at\nFlower Buds, one of the first to receive the flowers. “I mean you can get tulips from Ontario or grown from Dutch tulips, but there’s just no comparison, no comparison.”\nThe rest of the Maritimes will see them early next week, then on to stores across eastern Canada and the United States.\nFor more Prince Edward Island news visit our\ndedicated provincial page.\nShopping Trends\nThe Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

    "title": "Bitcoin: VanEck Records Fund Growth, Foresees Strong 2024",
    "text": "Asset manager VanEck has a bullish outlook for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market in 2024. The investment firm described Bitcoin as the “screaming buy” for the upcoming year as its fund recorded growth. The comments come as the firm’s VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) surpassed $100 million in assets under management (AUM), with VanEck’s global crypto-linked assets nearing $1 billion. 2024: A Promising Year Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, noted DAPP’s impressive 2023 performance with over 300% gains. Sigel said that it was driven by key players like Coinbase and Bitcoin miners. Sigel anticipates 2024 to be another robust year, especially if Bitcoin reaches new highs, aided by the Bitcoin halving event, a more relaxed stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve, and continued adoption of crypto in emerging markets. The fund manager highlights that [Coinbase](https://coingape.com/coinbase-and-top-crypto-companies-increase-us-political-donations/), a significant component of DAPP, has shown sustainable market share growth.
