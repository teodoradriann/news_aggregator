    "text": "NASA has dismissed recent media claims about the health of astronauts Sunita \"Suni\" Williams and Butch Wilmore aboard the International Space Station (ISS).\nContrary to reports suggesting significant weight loss and health concerns, the space agency has assured the public that both astronauts are in excellent condition.\nNASA Confirms ISS Astronauts in Good Health Amid Rumors\nDr. J.D. Polk, NASA's chief health and medical officer, emphasized that Williams and Wilmore are maintaining their pre-flight weight and continue to thrive in the microgravity environment, [Space](https://www.space.com/space-exploration/missions/all-astronauts-still-in-good-health-on-iss-nasa-flight-surgeon-says-amid-new-tabloid-rumors) said.\n\"Both astronauts weigh the same as when they launched,\" he said, explaining that changes in appearance, such as facial puffiness or muscle shifts, are common in space due to fluid redistribution and rigorous exercise routines.\nThe rumors originated from photos of Williams that some outlets described as showing her looking \"gaunt.\" These speculations were fueled by comments from outside medical experts who suggested her appearance might indicate stress from the extended time in space.\nWilliams addressed the claims directly during a live interview from the ISS, stating, \"I'm the same weight that I was when I got up here.\" She explained that her exercise regimen, which includes weightlifting and cycling, has slightly altered her physique, giving her a stronger build.\nPolk further explained NASA's comprehensive approach to astronaut health. Crewmembers undergo daily exercise, weekly private medical checkups, and constant monitoring of their diet and overall well-being.\nThe astronauts also have access to an Internet Protocol (IP) phone to contact medical staff whenever needed. Polk reiterated that NASA has never had to return an astronaut early for medical reasons in the history of human spaceflight.\nREAD MORE :\n[Congress to Hear Testimony on UFOs as Controversial Claims of DoD Disinformation Surface](/articles/51597/20241114/congress-hear-testimony-ufos-controversial-claims-dod-disinformation-surface.htm)\nStarliner Delays Extend ISS Stay, But NASA Assures Astronauts Are Thriving\nWilmore, who launched to the ISS with Williams in June aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, has also been the subject of similar rumors.\nAccording to [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/nasa-astronaut-suni-williams-shouldnt-have-to-discuss-her-weight-to-dismiss-tabloid-rumors-2000524132), media outlets suggested he might have experienced weight loss during the extended mission. However, NASA clarified that Wilmore, like Williams, is in excellent health.\nThe astronauts' mission was initially scheduled to last only 10 days, but technical issues with Starliner extended their stay to eight months. Despite the unexpected change, NASA confirmed that the ISS has ample supplies to support the crew until their scheduled return in February 2025 aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon.\nThis situation highlights the challenges astronauts face not only in space but also in dealing with public scrutiny. Williams' and Wilmore's professionalism and fitness demonstrate their preparedness to handle the demands of prolonged missions. NASA remains committed to ensuring their health and safety throughout their time aboard the ISS.\n[science times](https://www.sciencetimes.com/).",

    "text": "Outubro é o famoso “mês das bruxas” e, para quem curte jogos de esportes da EA, vai ser um período realmente assustador. A produtora vai “matar” um total de quatro games ao longo do mês, desligando seus servidores e removendo os títulos de suas plataformas online.\nNo mês passado já tivemos notícia de Need for Speed: Rivals acelerando para fora do catálogo da EA no mês de outubro. Não só isso, mas há rumores de que a série pode ter sido encerrada de vez.\nFoto: Divulgação/EA Mas o título não vai embora sozinho. No mesmo mês teremos também o encerramento de FIFA 23, do título de hockey NHL 21 e do jogo de futebol americano Madden NFL 22. A lista completa, com suas datas de desligamento, é a seguinte:\nNHL 21 encerra no dia 6 de outubro Need for Speed: Rivals encerra no 7 de outubro Madden NFL 22 encerra no dia 20 de outubro FIFA 23 encerra no dia 30 de outubro Divulgação/Electronic Arts Os três primeiros jogos já aparecem na página oficial de encerramento de suporte da EA. Já FIFA 23 deveria durar ainda até dezembro, mas o site GameBlog afirma que a produtora antecipou seu funeral para a véspera do Halloween.\nEA não pretende parar de “matar” jogos É normal o encerramento de suporte a jogos por parte de grandes produtoras como a EA, prática que acontece continuamente ao longo de todo ano.\nNo entanto, “matar” quatro jogos de uma vez num único mês certamente deve chamar a atenção do movimento Stop Killing Games , que tem conquistado tração na Europa.\nLeia mais:\nTendo a polêmica de The Crew como seu principal ponto de partida, a petição visa pressionar autoridades no velho continente a criar garantias de que grandes produtoras tenham algum compromisso em manter seus títulos jogáveis depois que já não querem mais trabalhar com eles.\nNo entanto, até que o movimento tenha algum resultado concreto (se tiver), ainda veremos muitos outros games sendo enterrados.\nVia: NotebookCheck",
