    "text": "ONTARIO, Calif. , April 25, The 2 nd Annual 5K at the Runway at Ontario International Airport (ONT) raised more than $32,000 for the USO to help further the organization's support of military servicemembers traveling through the popular aviation gateway.\nOn Thursday, the Ontario International Airport Authority presented a check for $32,079.11 to the USO at ONT, the latest in the airport's longstanding commitment to our nation's troops.\nContinue Reading\nThe Ontario International Airport Authority Board of Commissioners presents a check for $32,079.11 to the USO. The money represents net proceeds from ONT's 2nd Annual 5k at the Runway.\n\"We are proud to support the USO, its many volunteers and, above all, the brave men and women whose dedicated service to our nation provides us with the freedom we cherish,\" said Alan D. Wapner , President of the OIAA Board of Commissioners and a member of the USO California Advisory Board. \"The USO plays such an important role in providing comfort and support to military members and their families while they travel, and here at Ontario International Airport, we have one of the best facilities of its kind anywhere.\"\nThursday's check represented the net proceeds from the annual race and community event, which took place on National USO Day – February 4 . Nearly 1,000 runners and community members participated in the event, at the National Guard hangar. That location, adjacent to the airport's runways, provided a unique experience for all involved.\n\"We want to thank all of the participants, and our sponsors, for making this year's 5K at the Runway such a runaway success, while raising money for our great partners at the USO,\" said Atif Elkadi , OIAA Chief Executive Officer.\nThe USO at ONT opened in 2006 and is open 365 days a year on the southern edge of the former Terminal One. Thousands of servicemembers use the facility each year, many of them from nearby bases such as Fort Irwin , MCLB Barstow and March Air Reserve Base.\nAbout Ontario International Airport Ontario International Airport (ONT) is the fastest growing airport in the United States , according to Global Traveler, a leading publication for frequent fliers. Located in the Inland Empire, ONT is approximately 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles in the center of Southern California . It is a full-service airport which offers nonstop commercial jet service to two dozen major airports in the U.S., Mexico , Central America and Taiwan .

    "text": "Credit: Foundry Australia’s top cybersecurity leaders and their teams have been recognised at this year’s CSO30 Awards.\nHeld in conjunction with the CIO50 , the CSO30 Australia Awards is aligned to Foundry’s global awards program and celebrates the leading individuals and organisations delivering cybersecurity initiatives that have changed the way the business is protected.\nAlong with their cybersecurity initiatives, nominees were also evaluated based on how they collaborated with and influenced their stakeholders to improve cybersecurity and resilience within the enterprise. Judges also assessed their contribution to the wider cybersecurity community beyond their organisations.\nAt the gala CSO30 celebration event held in Sydney, two individuals were recognised with Business Value and Leadership awards for demonstrating outstanding leadership and business value in cybersecurity.\nIn the Business Value category, Vishwanath Nair from BaptistCare took out the top award. Nair was recognised for his outstanding contributions as a CISO at his previous organisation, NSW Electoral Commission. Electoral systems and processes are highly attractive targets for malicious actors and Nair was recognised for his forward-looking, proactive cyber strategy and initiatives.\nLeron Zinatullin , CISO at Linkly, was highly commended by the judges in this category. Zinatullin’s work has helped the business to launch new resilient and secure products and expand to new markets supported by robust security compliance regime and accreditation.\nIn the Leadership category, Vannessa Van Beek , Senior Director of Security at Avanade, took out top place. Van Beek was recognised for her people-first philosophy in fostering a security-conscious culture and her mentoring of emerging leaders.\nShireen Syd, CISO at University of Newcastle, was also highly commended in this category. Syd also serves as the Chief Security Officer under the Defence Industry Security Program and is actively involved in multiple industry and sector groups.\nMeanwhile, an emerging cybersecurity leader was recognised with the Next CISO Award. Hien Tran , Cyber Security Manager, at ABN Group, was the winner of this award. Tran was nominated for this award by his mentor, Richard Heron, a previous CSO30 winner.
