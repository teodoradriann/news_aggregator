    "title": "From fashion to royalty: Prince Mateen of Brunei’s fiancée steps into limelight - VnExpress International",
    "text": "| | Anisha Rosnah Isa-Kalebic, the fiancée of Prince Mateen of Brunei. Photo from Isa-Kalebic's fanpage's Instagram As reported by Esquire Magazine, Isa-Kalebic is the proprietor of the fashion brand Silk Collective and the co-founder of Authentirary, a tourism company that offers cultural experiences in various cities. She graduated from the University of Bath in the U.K. The prince’s fiancée comes from a noble family background, as her grandfather Pehin Dato Isa is Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah’s special advisor. He also held roles such as deputy attorney general and deputy chief minister in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Isa-Kalebic’s brother Danial Deen Isa-Kalebic is reportedly a close friend of Prince Mateen as well. Though little details about Isa-Kalebic and the prince’s romantic relationship have been disclosed, the couple is believed to have been dating for several years, according to People Magazine. They have been spotted together at several public events, including the wedding of Princess Azemah, the prince’s sister, in January last year. However, it was only earlier this month that the prince publicly shared their [first photo](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/trend/prince-mateen-of-brunei-reveals-first-photo-with-fiancee-4696888.html) together. With their engagement being announced in October last year, the couple is set to have a grand 10-day wedding, spanning from Sunday to Jan. 16 and honoring Brunei Royal Family traditions. The nuptials will reportedly feature an Islamic ceremony on Jan. 11, followed by a reception and a parade in Brunei’s capital Bandar Seri Begawan on Jan. 14. Prince Mateen, 32, is Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah’s 10th child and is sixth in line to the throne. A helicopter pilot and a major in the Royal Brunei Air Force, he has also played polo for his country in the 2017 and 2019 SEA Games. Hong Kong’s Tatler Magazine listed him among Asia’s top 50 most eligible bachelors in 2016.",

    "text": "萬人「優離優退」後 衛生部再縮編裁萬人 年省18億\n聯邦衛生與公共服務部(HHS)27日宣布機構重組，裁減約1萬名全職員工。加上之前1萬人參加「優離優退」方案，整個部全職員工數量將從8萬2000人大降至6萬2000人，相當於總體裁員高達25%。\n今此次部門大重組還包括將現有28個部門減到15個，地區辦事處從十個減至五個。被裁撤的崗位主要來自食品藥物管理局(\nFDA)、疾病防治中心 ( CDC)、國家衛生研究院 (NIH) 等。\n衛生部在聲明中指出，這個龐大官僚機構已變得浪費及低效，而通過減少1萬個全職員工，每年將為納稅人節省18億元。\n衛生部長小甘迺迪(Robert F. Kennedy Jr.)也在社交媒體發布視頻，除嚴厲批評這個「低效且龐大的官僚機構」外，直指衛生部未能提高美國人的壽命，也沒有採取足夠措施降低慢性病及癌症發生率，說部每年雖花費高達1兆7000億元，卻未能改善美國人的健康狀況。\n小甘迺迪承認這次大改組，衛生部將面臨一段痛苦時期，但保證會用更少的資源做更多的事。\n這次重組也凸顯小甘迺迪要加強對FDA、CDC、NIH等公共衛生機構的控制，傳統上，這些機構運作時會有一定程度的自主權，根據新計畫，採購及人力資源等集中由衛生部負責。\n在衛生部公布的計畫裡，FDA會裁減3500人、CDC炒掉2400人、NIH減少1200人、「\n聯邦醫療保險與醫療補助服務中心」(Medicare and Medicaid Services)，也有300人失業。\n大裁員及改組計畫公布後，不少公衛專家、醫護、現任及前任衛生部員工，乃至國會民主黨人，馬上警告會給數以百萬計民眾帶來難以估量的後果。\n全國各地的聯邦衛生工作人員瀰漫著震驚、恐懼及焦慮情緒。不少人表示事先並未收到裁員通知，許多人不知道自己是否在裁撤之列。\n南達科他州共和黨籍聯邦參議員朗茲(Mike Rounds)指出，尚不清楚小甘迺迪的改組計畫，會對衛生部有何影響。而華盛頓州民主黨籍聯邦參議員莫瑞(Patty Murray)則稱，此舉帶來的惡劣後果將顯而易見。",

    "text": "‘The digitalisation of humanity is destroying what it means to be human’: Sophie Winkleman on the dangers of smartphones\nThe actress talks championing community, societal responsibility, and creating a screen-free future with Seyan Dattani\nInterviewing a royal at Chelsea’s upmarket Bluebird Cafe is an intimidating prospect. But Sophie Winkleman has a knack for putting people at ease: refreshingly charming and down-to-earth, she orders a “boiling cappuccino, please!” (“I was up late fundraising for a paediatric hospital in Zimbabwe … so I need coffee!”) and is worried about being inarticulate (spoiler alert – she isn’t!).\nSophie is, by her own admission, “not posh”. She grew up in “vegetarian, hippy” Primrose Hill, in the days when it was still “a bit shabby and cosy – there was a shop called Sesame which I think only sold lentils.” Her neighbours included “lots of beautiful men” including Martin Amis and Jude Law. Although she hails from a “mega-intellectual” family (her father created The Times Atlas of World History and translates French poetry for fun, while her mother was a successful advertising copywriter and “the cleverest person I know”), her home life was gentle and academically unpressurised.\n“Nothing can replace teacher-pupil interaction”\nSadly, school at City Girls’ was less idyllic and a nasty case of bullying left Sophie with a long-lasting fear of groups of women. Her teachers, however, were “inspirational” – particularly in her favourite subjects, English and Latin. Under their guidance, she applied to read English at Trinity Hall – though she retains a love for classics and is fascinated when I tell her The Times publishes Latin crosswords. Sophie still sees her old teachers and feels gratitude for their passion and charisma in the classroom. This makes her sceptical of ‘isolating’ classroom iPads: “it’s novelty for novelty’s sake – EdTech is just Big Tech in a school uniform. Nothing can replace teacher-pupil interaction.” She praises Sweden for being “brave enough to admit failure and chuck tech out of the classroom,” and wonders why Britain lacks the courage to do the same. “We used to be a brave, pioneering country,” she says “but now we’re following quite shabby trends.”\nSophie’s time at Cambridge holds fonder memories: “I loved Trinity Hall and I loved the university’s thriving acting and comedy scene”. Her Footlights revue was nominated for the prestigious Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Fringe. “If you act and you’re at Cambridge, it’s like Christmas every day,” she says, remembering her time as Les Liaisons Dangereuses’ Madame de Merteuil at the ADC and touring Greek amphitheatres to perform Lorca’s Blood Wedding and Sophocles’ Elektra.\nHer own taste in film spans many of the classics, particularly Merchant Ivory masterpieces like Howard’s End and The Remains of the Day. “I also know every word of The Commitments and have an enduring love for Peter’s Friends … it’s the quintessence of the Footlights!”\n“I loved Trinity Hall and I loved the university’s thriving acting and comedy scene”\nDespite having a serious track record in theatre and TV, radio is Sophie’s favourite medium and she particularly enjoyed working on Martin Jarvis’ P.G. Wodehouse productions (“Wodehouse is music!”). More recently, she’s been involved in an ITV production of Jane Austen’s Sanditon and an upcoming BBC1 series she describes as “a dark drama about mad mothers and daughters – I’m not having to method act much!” She’d still love to play a comedic Shakespearean role – preferably Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing or Katherina in The Taming of the Shrew – but laughs that she’s “too ancient now!”\nIn her twenties, Sophie was cast as “posh dimwits” – most famously as Big Suze in Peep Show – but more recent roles, including a tough single mother in This is Going to Hurt, have showcased her versatility as an actress. Her co-star, Ben Whishaw is singled out for being “the kind of actor so brilliant that he just dissolves into someone else’s skin.”\nSophie has long warned about the impact of technology on children and is campaigning to “make smartphones and social media unavailable to under 16s”. She praises MPs such as Rosie Duffield and Miriam Cates for having the courage to push for stricter regulation, but laments successive governments’ inaction (“I’m sure they’re scared of alienating Big Tech”). For Sophie, the Online Safety Bill is not strong enough,” because it only deals with harmful material. She is equally alarmed by short-form apps like TikTok and Snapchat which have destroyed children’s abilities to focus. “I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say these platforms are causing brain damage,” she concludes, “I’m deeply concerned about the digitalisation of children both in and out of school.”\nShe praises schools taking a stand – from Cambridge’s screen-free Heritage School (“it’s a magically perfect school”) to the inner-city comprehensive Michaela Community School, with its emphasis on fact-based knowledge, handwriting, spelling and grammar – “traditions [that] have worked for centuries.”\n“I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say these platforms are causing brain damage”\nActing is an industry (in)famous for its addiction to social-media and Sophie’s career has occasionally suffered when producers have tired of her refusal to promote shows on social media. Unusually for an actress, Sophie regards Instagram as “the lowest of the low – it makes teen girls, in particular, feel very underconfident.” Showing off is “so pathetic,” she says. “People plonk themselves on yachts and post pictures for the entire world to see … I mean, really?!” Sophie would hail a return to modesty, adding that “being understated is underrated – the late Queen was a perfect example of discretion.”\nSophie, of course, knew Queen Elizabeth personally – her husband, Lord Frederick Windsor, is the King’s second cousin – and remembers her extremely fondly. King Charles is also a close friend of Sophie’s and she’s awed by his dedication: “His environmental work has been completely pioneering, as has the work of the Prince’s Trust. He writes letters for innumerable causes all through the night, every night”. She also believes that royal visits touch people and communities in ways that politicians and celebs never can. Was adjusting to royal life difficult? “Not remotely. Everyone was delightful – welcoming, fun and kind. They’re lovely people.”\nThe couple have two daughters at school in London. Freddie, who read Classics at Oxford, enjoys teaching the girls “basic geography” (“countries and rivers and mountain ranges”) and “proper, linear world history” – the sort of general knowledge that she says is “denigrated in the current curriculum.”\nSophie sees children as “sacred beings” and is passionate about small charities like School Home Support (which helps troubled children back into school), CURE.org (which funds operations for disabled children in Africa) and the Children’s Surgery Foundation. She’s also an ambassador for the Big Issue and sells the magazine with homeless people whenever she’s not working. She’s “baffled by” organisations like the NSPCC and Childline, who advocate leaving Big Tech to implement their own safety measures – “as if they’re ever going to do that!”\nAlso a patron of Age UK, Sophie deplores today’s “broken society” where the elderly are farmed out to care homes or left to wither away in isolation. Instead, she believes closer intergenerational bonds between teens and older people might mitigate loneliness and depression in both groups. “My friend Kate has set up a charity called TimeGivers, where teens go to visit lonely elderly people in their community,” she says, wishing this could become a “societal habit we all nurture.”\n“You’ve got no friends because you’re scrolling in your room by yourself!”\nSophie is aware about the dangers of parents sounding too evangelical: “the [anti-smartphone] revolution has to be led by very young people … not a group of mums.” She cites her friend, actress Sophie Thompson, whose son at Central St Martin’s doesn’t have a smartphone. “It sounds like he’s the coolest boy in the entire year because he’s not available, there’s a mystique about him. He’s clearly refused to be captured and destroyed by social media and it’s doing wonders for his social capital – I love that irony.’’\nChildren don’t want to be addicted to screens, Sophie explains. She cites an interview in The Times where students yearned for the freedom that comes from not being on social media. “It’s peddled as this great connecting force but it’s in the main a huge isolator. You don’t have 900 friends,” she says, “you’ve got no friends because you’re scrolling in your room by yourself!”\n[Fashion](/fashion)/[Why did we stop wearing heels?](/fashion/28437)7 November 2024[Music](/music)/[Cambridge libraries as hit songs](/music/28493)13 November 2024[Features](/features)/[Challenging tradition and dressing down in Cambridge](/features/28463)5 November 2024[Film & TV](/film-and-tv)/[Compulsive heterosexuality: Heartstopper Season 3](/film-and-tv/28544)13 November 2024[News](/news)/[News in brief: royal visits and rabid waters](/news/28536)12 November 2024\n[Fashion](/fashion)/[An earring for every occasion](/fashion/28262)15 November 2024[Arts](/arts)/[Tate head on a ‘great British brand that resonates throughout the world’](/arts/28468)15 November 2024[Interviews](/interviews)/[“There’s something about Austen”: Cariad Lloyd on her hit improv show Austentatious](/interviews/28471)15 November 2024[Features](/features)/[Could your college be costing you?](/features/28475)15 November 2024[Arts](/arts)/[Anything goes at the Kettle’s Yard picture scheme](/arts/28482)15 November 2024",

    "text": "La actriz Emma Watson, famosa por su papel de Hermione Granger en la saga de Harry Potter , ha sido condenada a una prohibición de conducir durante seis meses tras ser sorprendida excediendo el límite de velocidad en Oxford, Inglaterra. Según han informado medios británicos, Watson fue captada por un radar conduciendo a 38 mph (aproximadamente 61 km/h) en una zona limitada a 30 mph (48 km/h) el pasado 31 de julio.\nLa actriz, de 35 años, recibió la notificación del cargo por correo y se declaró culpable el 3 de marzo. La sentencia fue dictada el miércoles en un tribunal de Wycombe, aunque Watson no asistió a la breve audiencia, que duró apenas cinco minutos.\nAdemás de la suspensión de su licencia, Watson deberá hacer frente a una multa de 1,044 libras esterlinas (alrededor de 1,400 dólares estadounidenses), que deberá abonar en un plazo de 28 días. Este incidente marca la cuarta infracción de tráfico de la actriz en menos de dos años. Según el Daily Mail , Watson ya había acumulado nueve puntos en su licencia por otras infracciones cometidas en enero y en octubre y noviembre de 2023.\nEn el momento de la infracción, Watson estaba al volante de su Audi S3, el cual fue retirado por la policía el año pasado debido a una infracción de estacionamiento mientras la actriz se reunía con su madre en un pub cercano.\nA pesar de estos problemas legales, Watson continúa su trayectoria académica, ya que está cursando un doctorado en la Universidad de Oxford. La actriz alcanzó la fama mundial a través de los ocho filmes de Harry Potter , que se estrenaron entre 2001 y 2011. Actualmente, las obras de J.K. Rowling están siendo adaptadas a una serie de televisión de HBO, la cual se prevé que se estrene en 2027, con la joven Arabella Stanton interpretando el papel de Hermione Granger.\nEn un caso coincidente, el mismo tribunal dictó una sentencia similar para otra estrella de Harry Potter . Zoë Wanamaker, quien interpretó a Madam Hooch en Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal , también recibió una prohibición de conducir de seis meses y una multa de 1,044 libras esterlinas por exceder el límite de velocidad. Wanamaker fue sorprendida conduciendo a 46 mph (74 km/h) en una zona limitada a 40 mph (64 km/h) en agosto de 2024, y al igual que Watson, ya tenía nueve puntos en su licencia antes de esta infracción.",

    "title": "Se calienta la interna radical: acusan a Lousteau de \\\"rupturista\\\" y los díscolos lanzaron dardos a De Loredo",
    "text": "La ruptura del bloque de diputados de la UCR hizo detonar la interna radical con acusaciones cruzadas que tuvieron como principales destinatarios al senador Martín Lousteau y al diputado Rodrigo De Loredo. Al primero lo acusaron de \\\"rupturista\\\" y al cordobés le cuestionaron la conducción de la bancada y de haber \\\"roto todo\\\" con la foto que lo mostró encabezando una comitiva de correligionarios que fue a la reunión de la mesa legislativa con el Gobierno.Tras formalizarse este jueves la conformación del bloque Democracia para Siempre un espacio que contará con 12 diputados que responden a Lousteau y Facundo Manes las distintas terminales del radicalismo coincidieron que la división no afectará la conducción del partido. El economista seguirá al frente del Comité Nacional y Gastón Manes hermano del neurocientífico continuará con el control de la Convención más allá de las críticas que puedan bajar del lado de los gobernadores que están dentro del grupo Malbec que incluye a Alfredo Cornejo (Mendoza) Gustavo Valdés (Corrientes) y Leandro Zdero (Chaco).En principio el nuevo bloque descartó la posibilidad de que vaya a reclamar el sello de la UCR y rechazan que pueda haber pelea por los lugares en las comisiones pero dejaron en claro que la ruptura es por los temas. \\\"No se puede defender a los jubilados por la mañana y a la tarde tirarlos por la ventana\\\" reprochó uno de los diputados de la línea Manes que venía reclamando la salida de Mariano Campero Luis Picat Martín Arjol Federico Tournier y Pablo Cervi quienes colaboraron con el oficialismo para ratificar el veto a la movilidad jubilatoria y la ley de financiamiento universitario lo que fue el origen de la crisis.En este escenario Lousteau se mantiene en silencio gesto que fue calificado como \\\"polémico\\\" por los radicales dialoguistas que lo señalan de ser \\\"cómplice\\\" de la fractura. Pero en el campamento de Evolución hacen otra lectura porque aseguran que el economista \\\"defiende la identidad partidaria como presidente que es lo que reclaman los radicales\\\".\\\"El problema es de De Loredo que fue el que provocó la división rompiendo un acuerdo que él hizo 12 horas antes cuando se fue a reunir a la Casa Rosada\\\" advirtieron en referencia a la decisión del cordobés de armar una comitiva para reunirse con el Gobierno evitando ir a la mesa de diálogo que se había agendado en el bloque la noche anterior en un intento de los dirigentes históricos por evitar la fractura.Los díscolos insisten en recordar que la crisis se inició por la decisión de De Loredo de \\\"cobijar\\\" a los radicales libertarios \\\"sin respetar la postura del partido la convención y de 12 diputados\\\" que reclamaban la expulsión de los 5 legisladores. Y en este sentido advirtieron que la crisis deja \\\"un bloque radical mileista y otro radical\\\" como consecuencia de \\\"la mezquindad y cinismo\\\" del cordobés.Pero del lado de los radicales dialoguistas descargan su bronca contra el senador radical porque a Lousteau le reprochan que como jefe del radicalismo \\\"rompe el bloque del partido. \\\"El colmo es que ni siquiera logró la presidencia de ese minibloque\\\" deslizó con ironía uno de los correligionarios más cercano a los gobernadores. En este sector no sólo están observando la coyuntura sino que tienen la mirada puesta en las elecciones del próximo año cuando el senador tendrá que renovar su banca y contará con la lapicera para definir las listas sobre todo en CABA y en la Provincia dos distritos clave en la discusión electoral.Los gobernadores tienen su análisis de las figuras de Lousteau y Manes y resaltan que más allá de que estén juntos tienen visiones distintas. \\\"A Martín se lo ve más rupturista y Manes busca más allá de querer ser la oposición al Gobierno diferenciarse del bloque pero primero debería ir al Congreso\\\" chicaneó uno de los provinciales.En Democracia para Siempre coinciden en que con la ruptura de la UCR no ganó Milei mientras que en las provincias gobernadas por Juntos por el Cambio entienden que la división no será funcional para negociar leyes con el Gobierno porque \\\"va a haber un sector que va a dialogar para buscar consenso mientras que otro se va a oponer como hace el kirchnerismo\\\".En su debut como presidente de Democracia para Siempre Pablo Juliano rechazó la versión de los dialoguistas. \\\"No queremos caer en el populismo de derecha de Milei ni en el populismo de izquierda del kirchnerismo\\\" declaró el diputado y lugarteniente de Facundo Manes en el espacio quien también devolvió al apuntar que en la UCR \\\"hay un oficialismo clandestino\\\". La interna radical sigue caliente y el interrogante es si la crisis se replicará en otros espacios del partido.",

    "text": "MPs seek to make unauthorised entry into football grounds a criminal offence The Euro 2020 final between England and Italy at Wembley saw crowd trouble. MPs have recommended the creation of a new criminal offence of unauthorised entry to a football match to counter the sort of disorder seen at the Euro 2020 final at Wembley.\nThe Culture Media and Sport Committee has completed an inquiry into spectator safety issues following the trouble seen both at Wembley, and the problems encountered by Liverpool fans at last year’s Champions League final in Paris.\nThe Euro 2020 final between England and Italy saw a number of fans without tickets attempting to gain entry to Wembley either with fake tickets, through tailgating or by force.\nThere is currently no distinct criminal offence regarding unauthorised entry to a stadium, and the Committee has called on the Government to back a bill introduced by committee member Kevin Brennan MP which would create an offence and allow a football banning order to be imposed on conviction.\nChair of the Committee Dame Caroline Dinenage MP said: “Tailgating and other forms of unauthorised entry into grounds are an increasing problem at high-profile matches putting safety at risk from overcrowding.\n“Those involved should know that they will face consequences and the Government should back legislation to ensure they can be banned.”\nThe issues seen in Paris last summer were very different, with the authorities found to be at fault for major problems around the Stade de France despite their attempts to pin the blame on Liverpool supporters.\nSeveral fans were denied entry despite having legitimate tickets for Liverpool’s match against Real Madrid, while police also used pepper spray and tear gas.\nThe Committee called the treatment Liverpool fans received “disgraceful” and said the attitude of foreign police forces towards British fans was a significant factor.\nDame Dinenage added: “At big games in Europe, too often the attitude of foreign police to British fans leads to unacceptable treatment of innocent supporters.\n“The Government needs to work with overseas counterparts to bolster the role of British police travelling with teams and collaboration with local forces.”",

O grupo ainda teve um encontro com o superintendente do Ministério da Agricultura e Pecuária (Mapa) no RS, José Cleber Dias de Souza, para entregar as demandas do agronegócio gaúcho. Segundo a carta divulgada pelo grupo, o setor vive um cenário desolador, resultado de fatores climáticos adversos, como aos seguidos de estiagem seguidos por enchentes e excesso de chuvas. Além disso, o texto cita que a medida provisória apresentada pelo Governo Federal é insuficiente para atender às necessidades dos produtores rurais e pede que a população atue junto ao agronegócio para pressionar por soluções que beneficiem toda a sociedade. “Estamos falando de um impacto sem precedentes para a economia do país e para a vida dos produtores. A população urbana também sentirá esses impactos muito em breve. A crise no setor agropecuário afeta diretamente o abastecimento de alimentos e o preço dos produtos chegam às nossas mesas. O agro alimenta cada um de nós e a saúde desse setor é essencial a todos”, citou a carta. Na próxima semana, o grupo SOS Agro RS pretende organizar uma viagem para Brasília para acompanhar parlamentares gaúchos em audiências sobre o tema.",

    "title": "Boeing IAM District 751 Machinists Union strike | What to know | king5.com",
    "text": "EVERETT, Wash. — Boeing's largest union of more than 30,000 machinists has voted to go on strike, rejecting the latest contract offer with the company . The contract between members of the IAM District 751 Machinists Union and Boeing has lapsed, and union members say they and the company are far apart when it comes to reaching an agreement. What is at the heart of this contract dispute? How will the strike impact the local economy? Will employees still receive pay or benefits? Here's what we know from the company, and the union, about the strike. Why are Boeing machinists striking? Boeing machinists and the company were unable to come to an agreement on a new contract, with union members walking away over proposed pay increases and other aspects of the new proposed contract that they say are insufficient. The union is seeking a 40% pay increase over the next four years - however, Boeing's counteroffer is 25%. Among the sticking points is Boeing's refusal to restore a pension plan that was eliminated in 2014. In a message to union members, Boeing COO and Executive Vice President Stephanie Pope called the proposed new agreement \"the best contract we've ever presented,\" citing increased 401k contributions, and a commitment to manufacture the company's next airplane in Washington state. In a statement from earlier this summer, the union said it was seeking \"Wage increases after ten years of stagnant wages, health care plans that allow us to take care of our families, a dignified retirement plan, more say in overtime hours to achieve a better work/life balance,\" from the new contract. Machinists voted overwhelmingly (94%) to reject the tentative agreement with the company. Following the strike vote, Boeing released a statement saying: \"The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members. We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.\" How will the strike impact Washington state's economy? Machinists and Boeing are in agreement that a stall in the company's work will affect the entire region, where there are facilities in Everett, Renton, Auburn, Frederickson and elsewhere. According to Boeing, there are more employees in Washington state than anywhere else in the world. Machinists said that they will be putting less money into the local economy while they continue to strike. \"We won't be going to the store much, out to eat as much. It's going to impact all the local businesses because we have to save our money to pay our bills and feed our families,\" one union member told KING 5. Depending on how the jet production delays impact plane deliveries down the road, there could also be broader economic impacts, members say. Boeing agrees that Washington state's economy can expect to see localized impacts while contract negotiations have stalled. \"A strike would hurt local businesses of all sizes - from aerospace suppliers to restaurants to retailers,\" the company wrote in an FAQ on its website. \"These businesses rely on Boeing's operations and Boeing employee spending.\" When did the strike start? How long will it last? The strike began at midnight on Sept. 13, when the contract between the union and Boeing officially expired. There is no set timeline for how long the strike will last. The company said on its website, \"Strikes do not usually have a predetermined end date and we cannot predict the duration of a strike if one occurs.\" Are Boeing employees still getting paid? What about benefits? Striking machinists are not getting paid while on strike. Other Boeing employees who are not part of the IAM 751 Union will be paid as normal. Without a new contract, machinists in the union will also not accrue vacation time, be eligible for unemployment or be able to use sick leave or cash in time off while the strike continues. If a new contract is not in place by the end of the month, company-paid healthcare benefits will end for employees and their covered family members on Sept. 30. How are local lawmakers reacting? Lawmakers at the city, state and federal level have chimed in on the strike, making it clear they would like to see a swift resolution in the dispute between Boeing and its machinists. In a collective release from the mayors of Kent, Renton, Auburn and Everett - where thousands of Boeing employees live - they said, \"We are hopeful they will soon reach an agreement that respects the workers and the value they contribute to Boeing and our communities.\" The mayors said they were \"reassured\" by Boeing's commitment to build its next airplane in Washington state. \"This pledge represents decades of continued work for Boeing employees and a sustained investment in manufacturing sector jobs for our local economies,\" the statement continued. Rep. Adam Smith (D-Renton) released a statement on X (formerly Twitter) saying, \"I strongly urge the parties to return to the negotiating table and participate in good faith discussions that result in a strong agreement.\" Smith acknowledged that large corporations have \"increasingly prioritized shareholder value at the expense of workers,\" and urged Boeing to behave as a \"responsible steward for its employees.\" \"I sincerely hope that the parties reach an agreement that respects all employees as well as the company as a whole,\" he concluded. Governor Jay Inslee also weighed in on social media, saying, \"Washington's machinists are among the most skilled in the world, and their knowledge and expertise is why Boeing is globally recognized as a world-class company. We all hope that the machinists and Boeing come to an agreement as soon as possible.\" KING 5's Eric Wilkinson and Bridget Chavez contributed to this report.",
