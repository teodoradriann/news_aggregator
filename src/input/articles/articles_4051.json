    "text": "MANILA, Philippines — A number of Filipino celebrities called for the protection of the Masungi Geopark Project after Oscar winner Leonardo DiCaprio expressed support and asked for presidential intervention.\nDiCaprio posted on his official Instagram account images of forest rangers in Masungi who protect the critical areas plagued by illegal activities.\n\"Conservation successes like Masungi serve as a reminder that the Philippines can become a leader in sustainability, eco-tourism, biodiversity protection, and climate action,\" the actor said.\nHe noted that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) threatens to cancel the agreement that protects Masungi from prolific land grabbing activities, which would \"set back the success of an internationally acclaimed conservation effort and leave the area vulnerable again\" to illegal land works.\nThe actor even tagged President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos to intervene and continue to protect Masungi.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Leonardo DiCaprio (@leonardodicaprio)\nSeveral local celebrities like fellow award-winning actor John Arcilla and journalist Karen Davila thanked DiCaprio for joining the Masungi protection calls.\n\"Thank you so much for this awareness and call Leonardo; such a noble endeavor, it's a pity that most Filipinos ourselves are not even aware of this,\" commented Arcilla.\nDavila went on to praise the Masungi Georeserve Foundation Inc. (MGFI), \"Amazing to see the world stand with the brave work you do!\"\nOther notable individuals that chipped in gratitude and support were Marc Nelson, Kiana Valenciano, Arci Muñoz and Eric \"Eruption\" Tai.\nThe DENR released a statement following DiCaprio's post that it would stand by its plan to cancel the 2017 memorandum of agreement by the government and the MGFI.\n“We appreciate the statements of concern for the Philippine environment from international celebrities who are distinguished in their respective fields. However, no one is exempt from the law,” the DENR said in a statement, adding it will continues to take steps toward strengthening its compliance and enforcement capacities.\n\"The Filipino people own the area occupied by MGFI and the operation of resort venues that charge the public for day tours, meetings and weddings remains non-compliant with Philippine laws,\" the agency added. — with reports from Bella Cariaso\nRELATED: DiCaprio joins call for Masungi protection",

    "text": "2025年第二波水逆將至，從7月18日開始水星將於獅子座逆行，持續至8月10日，塔羅牌老師艾菲爾提醒5星座，在這波水逆中特別有感，容易出現「說了又錯、做了又翻」，不只溝通卡關，還可能影響金錢、感情與家庭氣氛，特別是在自我表達與人際互動上，容易出現誤會與摩擦，也會讓過去的一些議題重新浮現。\n金牛座：財運反复，小心舊帳重提\n金牛座過去沒有處理好的帳目、合作糾紛，或是遺漏的金錢細節，可能在水逆這段期間翻出來重談。原本以為已經結束的金錢糾紛、過期票據或信用紀錄，也可能突然冒出來。購物時容易出現退換貨情形，投資上也容易出現「買了就跌」的情況。建議金牛座這段期間避免重大財務決定，重新整理帳目與合約內容是最佳選擇。\n 獅子座：事業焦躁，溝通問題連環爆\n作為水逆影響的主場星座，獅子座感受特別強烈。這段時間事業節奏容易混亂，原訂計畫一再延遲，加上表達容易被誤解，導致工作上感到壓力山大。越想主導局面，越可能遇到溝通失準、指示混亂的情況，還可能因此與同事或上司產生誤會。建議獅子座先放下「一定要完美」的心態，穩住節奏、降低期待，把水逆期當作調整戰術的機會，反而能為下半年的爆發鋪路。\n 天秤座：貴人轉弱，自立自強最穩\n天秤座一向擅長依靠人脈與貴人力量開創機會，但這段期間可能感覺「貴人突然消失了」，合作關係出現摩擦或是仰賴的人無法及時幫忙，讓你感到獨自奮戰。尤其是團隊互動與朋友往來，容易出現價值觀不合、話不投機的狀況。別急著指責他人失職，這波水逆其實是訓練自己獨立的好時機，放慢社交節奏，反而能沉澱出真正的盟友。\n 射手座：桃花誤會，曖昧失衡\n水逆讓射手座的戀愛運出現干擾，原本充滿火花的曖昧關係，可能因為一句話、一個錯誤的訊息而急轉直下，容易產生誤會、不確定感，讓原本甜蜜的氣氛突然變得尷尬。對於單身的射手而言，這段時間不是發展新戀情的最佳時機；對於有對象的射手，則要多注意彼此的情緒敏感區域。建議把浪漫放慢速度，多用行動而非話語來表達感情，避免「口快心直」傷害人心。\n 巨蟹座：家庭摩擦，過往情緒回流\n這波水逆對巨蟹座來說是「家庭情緒的翻攪期」，與家人的溝通容易有情緒性誤解，舊有的不滿、壓抑的情緒會不自覺湧現，特別是與長輩或親密家人相處時最為明顯。可能出現因小事爭執，或是過去沒解決的問題被重新提起，讓氣氛緊繃。這波水逆其實是療癒與溝通的好時機，建議巨蟹用更柔軟的方式面對衝突，表達自己真實的情感，讓家庭關係更進一步。\n＊民俗說法僅供參考，不代表本新聞網立場＊",

The floods that began last week, caused by unusually heavy rains, have destroyed highways and bridges in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, which borders Uruguay and Argentina. “We’ve lost everything,” said Adriana Freitas in state capital Porto Alegre, where the Guaiba River burst its banks and inundated city streets. “It’s sad when we see the city, our house, in the middle of the water. It seems like it’s over, that the world has ended.” “China is one of the pillars of the new world order,” Orban said “We are putting maximum pressure on our partners to increase weapon deliveries,” Zelensky said Putin accused “arrogant” Western elites of forgetting decisive role played by Soviet Union in defeating Nazi Germany “Another massive attack on our energy industry!” Energy Minister German Galushchenko wrote on Telegram app",

    "text": "‘That was gross’: Former New Jersey AG says Menendez tried to meddle in ally’s case By Gregory Krieg, Sabrina Souza and Lauren del Valle, CNN New York (CNN) — New Jersey’s top prosecutor and a high-ranking deputy had just finished a 2019 meeting with US Sen. [Bob Menendez](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/bob-menendez-new-jersey-senate-independent/index.html) in the Democrat’s Newark office. After a quiet elevator ride down to their car, Andrew Bruck turned to his boss, state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, and broke the silence. “Whoa,” Bruck said, “that was gross.” The unnerving exchange with Menendez, Grewal testified in federal court Thursday, was his second such conversation with the senator, who i [s being tried on charges](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/bob-menendez-what-to-know-trial/index.html) that he engaged in a bribery scheme and acted as a foreign agent for the Egyptian government. Like in a previous exchange, months earlier, Menendez told Grewal he was concerned over the treatment of Hispanic defendants – a worry, the senator said on both occasions, tied to a specific, ongoing case being handled by the attorney general’s office of insurance. Grewal, who left office in 2021, told the court that the initial call had caught him off-guard. He had no personal relationship with the senator, who called him on his private line after obtaining the number through Grewal’s cousin. After some small talk, Grewal said, Menendez pivoted to the matter he would bring up again in his office – with no one present but him and the two visitors – on September 6, 2019. On both occasions, Grewal testified, he told Menendez that the defense lawyer in the case, Michael Critchley, should be the one to raise any issues – and that if he did, they should be directed not to him but to the prosecution team or judge. Menendez, in Grewal’s opinion, seemed surprised that Bruck had come along for the in-person meeting. Once inside, seated at a small circular conference table at the front of Menendez’s sprawling, high-windowed office, the senator again pressed Grewal on the treatment of Hispanic defendants. Grewal said Menendez then, once again, brought up the case of Elvis Parra, who had been indicted on insurance fraud charges. Parra was an associate of [businessman Jose Uribe](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/01/politics/bob-menendez-jose-uribe-corruption-case/index.html), who was indicted as part of the bribery scheme before striking a plea deal with federal prosecutors earlier this year. Grewal testified that Menendez never explicitly identified the case or defendants by name in either interaction, only telling Grewal it involved Hispanic truckers prosecuted by the insurance fraud division in the attorney general’s office. “I didn’t know the case. I didn’t want to know the case,” Grewal said, telling the court he still does not know the details of the case Menendez was discussing. The meeting ended shortly thereafter, lasting about 15 minutes. Menendez had retreated to small talk, Grewal said, after the attorney general again refused to engage on the specifics. “There wasn’t an explicit ask,” Grewal told the court, but he had become concerned that Menendez was trying to meddle with the case. He did not tell any of his rank-and-file attorneys about their exchanges. “Insulating the team from any type of pressure or interference from the outside” was an important part of his job, Grewal said, telling the court he believed spreading word of Menendez’s interest risked creating “a chilling effect” around the case. Menendez’s lawyers disputed that notion, repeatedly asking Grewal if their client had in any way threatened or sought to intimidate him. His answer, over and over again, was no. The pressure, Grewal said, was baked into their conversations from the start. Menendez “was a close political ally of the governor’s, so that was my concern, sort of being on his bad side,” Grewal testified. Grewal is the government’s 14th witness in a trial that is already in its fourth week, as prosecutors try to prove Menendez, two co-defendants and the senator’s wife, Nadine, engaged in a global bribery scheme [that delivered the Menendezes gold bars](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/12/politics/menendez-gold-cash-what-matters/index.html), blocks of cash and a new Mercedes in exchange for the senator using his post and power to influence public officials to benefit his associates. “Robert Menendez was a United States senator on the take,” Lara Pomerantz, an assistant US attorney, [told the jury in her opening remarks](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/bob-menendez-trial-takeaways/index.html). “Motivated by greed, focused on how much money he could put in his own pocket and his wife’s pocket.” The senator’s team has insisted that he committed no crimes and, to the extent that there had been any unsavory business dealings, Nadine Menendez was the driving force. Nadine’s trial was separated and pushed back to this summer. The senator disclosed last month that she [has breast cancer](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/nadine-menendez-breast-cancer/index.html). In testimony a day earlier, an FBI agent [combed through a massive trove of communications](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/bob-nadine-menendez-mercedes/index.html) among the alleged conspirators, including text message exchanges focused on the Parra case. In January 2019, Nadine, who was Menendez’s girlfriend at the time, asked Wael Hana, an Egyptian American businessman and one of the co-defendants, to tell her “what the charges are.” (Lawyers for Hana and developer Fred Daibes, the third alleged co-conspirator, declined to cross-examine Grewal.) “The matter only involves four counts,” Hana replied, and is “a relatively small indictment.” A few minutes later, Nadine called the senator.

    "title": "#71 Un atentado islamista durante la misa de Navidad deja más de 160 cristianos asesinados en Nigeria",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#0](c0#c-0) Ese titular es tendencioso y confuso, y probablemente seas consciente. El ataque no fue durante una misa, como quiere dar a entender, si no que se atacó una serie de aldeas de manera coordinada. Y además, el factor religioso no es el único relevante, y tampoco está plenamente confirmado.\nHay fuentes mucho más serias, informadas y rigurosas que la que has mandado...\n[#10](c10#c-10) Resulta difícil creer que puedan existir fuentes más serias leyendo maravillas cosas como:\nLa reciente matanza sucedida en Navidad confirma lo que anuncian las estadísticas: el cristianismo es la religión más perseguida en el mundo. Y no se limita solamente a esta región de África, sino que ocurre en Asia y Medio Oriente. Hace poco a cristianos perseguidos por el régimen comunista chino se les negó asilo en la España de Pedro Sánchez y el PSOE. Solo una lo pudo obtener porque su salud le impedía subir al avión donde la deportaban.\nTodo ello, mientras las pateras siguen llegando a España, posiblemente con insurgentes tan radicales como los que masacran a los cristianos en Nigeria y sin el amparo para los cristianos que huyen de estos.\n[#65](c65#c-65) Las muertes no son sensacionalistas, la noticia es sensacionalista, y su falta de rigor, una falta de respeto a los que han sido asesinados. Además de aprovechar que el Pisuerga pasa por Valladolid para seguir esparciendo odio y desinformación...\nNo sé tú, pero yo este tipo de cosas ni las tolero ni me quedo callada, prefiero no ser cómplice de estas miserias.\nMira, igual en que en Gaza, pero estos no lo llaman masacre.\nhttps://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20231217/9456963/iglesia-denuncia-israel-mato-sangre-fria-dos-feligresas-gaza.html\nhttps://es.zenit.org/2023/12/12/22-cristianos-muertos-en-gaza-cohete-sin-detonar-hallado-en-parroquia/\n[#53](c53#c-53) ridiculizarlo si quieres.... Pero con Israel tenemos todo tipo de relaciones y bien estrechas, vamos de aliados, van de ser occidente, medio entran en europa, sobre todo socialmente, democracia plena etc etc ... No tiene absolutamente nada que ver.\nEsto es una masacre genocida por supuesto, ejem\n[#2](c2#c-2) .... Pro no es comparable. Si acaso, comparable a la masacre de Hamas.\n[#61](c61#c-61) Con Israel si, con Gaza no, mediáticamente deberíamos estar recibiendo un bombardeo de lavado de cara de Israel, pero es al contrario. Lo que esté bien o mal no me meto, no soy experto, pero la actitud de los medios ha cambiado y eso me inquieta.\nEs como si dentro de un mes encontramos todos los medios diciendo que Aznar ha sido el peor presidente, que hipotecó a España para décadas. Sería inquietante, llevan décadas lavándole la cara a Aznar y que cambien de rumbo significaría que algo ha pasado o que está habiendo algún cambio de poderes de influencia.\n[#9](c9#c-9) bueno. Entérate quién financio al valeroso pueblo de Afganistán y sus valerosos guerreros los muyahidines( les dedicaron Rambo iii y todo), o quien armó y financio a Irak, a estos que ves ahora este terrible atentado de la noticia, quien los organizo y financió, ... Después nos vuelves a contar estás cosas. Y si sigues pensando que está irán detrás de todo pq es omnipresente vale. Si ves q algún otro estado puede estar implicado, fijate quién lo arma y financia. Un saludo.\n[#13](c13#c-13) lo se y lo he criticado 100 millones de veces, dinero de EEUU y Arabia Saudita y Pakistán.\nPero eso no les importa para llamarlos partisanos, \"que en Europa les habría llamado partisanos y que habrían luchado contra los nazis\"\nEso es mierda, el fanatismo religioso no atiende a razones.\nAl menos tu comentario muestra algo de vergüenza de esa gente... Algo es algo.\n[#20](c20#c-20) pues mira otra vez la captura que mandas, pq es exactamente lo que estoy diciendo. Afganistán era un país más adelantado que España y las mujeres iban sin velo. El tío Sam puso a la derecha religiosa conservadora, o lo que viene a ser los fascistas de toda la vida, pero en musulmán, a levantarse en armas... Cómo en Irak, libia, Egipto, Ucrania... Mismo proceder en todos lados, mismo resultado en todos lados. Países de mierda con gobiernos autoritarios y la población paupérrima y reprimida. Eso es el tío Sam.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Claro, Afganistan era un paraiso...\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerra_de_Afganist%C3%A1n_(1978-1992)\nTienes una vision de la historia bastante distorsionada. China tambien dio armas a los talibanes para luchar contra la URSS, entre otros tantos paises....\nClaaaaaaro, todo culpa del tio sam...\n[#31](c31#c-31) entérate lo que era Afganistán antes del 92.\nEra un estado laico. En el año 90 la mayoría del profesorado eran mujeres, por ejemplo, que estaba integrada en el mundo laboral.\nY la revolución hostigada por el tío Sam puso a los integristas islámicos. Los valerosos muyahidines, como dijeron en Rambo 3, que les dedicaron.\nInfórmate tú un poquito, antes de hablar sin saber.\n[#32](c32#c-32) tengo entendido dos cosas : Rambo III estaba dedicada a “the galant people of Afghanistan” , lo otro es un bulo . Pero la info en internet se contradice en todas partes acerca de esto , asi que no sé.\nSegundo:\nLo de que Afghanistan era laico , mujeres sin velo etc . se ha mostrado erróneo, solo era en Khabul . En las zonas agrarias (el resto del país) era anticuado respecto a esto .\nPero es un lío y al final no sabes lo que es verdad o no , internet está lleno de información contradictoria .\n[#13](c13#c-13) Se financian infinitud de proyectos e ideologías en los 5 continentes, para bien y para mal, y solo los “amigos de las cabras” son los que a posteriori se dedican al terrorismo.\n[#56](c56#c-56) con lo de los amigos de las cabras supongo q te refieres a los valerosos guerreros muyahidines, que junto a los USA liberaron del yugo comunista a Afganistán y lo convirtieron en la tierra de libertades que es hoy. No? O te refieres a las primaveras árabes? O a liberar libia? Iraq? El maidan de Ucrania?\n[#57](c57#c-57) La noticia habla de un atentado islamista. ¿ Tu de que crees que hablo ? P.S. No tengo nada contra las cabras.\n[#13](c13#c-13) \"les dedicaron Rambo iii y todo\"\nLeyenda urbana:\nhttps://www.indy100.com/showbiz/rambo-iii-afghanistan-mujahideen-taliban-b1904082\n[#69](c69#c-69) Esos ojitos no han podido ver algo que jamás ha ocurrido:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo_III#Dedication (apartado \"Dedication\")\nThe film ends with the on-screen caption, \"This film is dedicated to the gallant people of Afghanistan.\" At some point after the September 11 attacks, an urban legend began that the dedication had actually read \"... to the brave Mujahideen fighters\" when the film was released in theaters, but then changed to \"the gallant people of Afghanistan\" after the 2001 attacks, since the Mujahideen were now associated to some extent with the Taliban. This urban legend has been repeated by some scholars. However, this is untrue, and some reviews of the film upon its release even mentioned the \"gallant people of Afghanistan\" dedication.\nEs decir, o bien crees haberlo visto (podría ser efecto Mandela) o bien simplemente estás mintiendo.\n[#71](c71#c-71) Pues entonces estás mintiendo. No hay ninguna versión de la película en la que aparezca dicho texto, y si te fijas la captura que se comparte online en la que sale el texto de los muyhidines siempre es la misma en el mismo frame exacto. Eso es debido a que la gente siempre comparte la misma captura editada.\nEstos son los que en Francia, España e Italia eran llamados partisanos por que no se que mierdas de las circunstancias? O estos los podemos llamar terroristas?\nLa yihad se lleva a cabo con muerte de infieles y el miedo a serlo.\nNo se trata de liberar nada, cada ataque sirve para atraer radicales y causar estragos en los no creyetes.\nQuien apoya a yihadistas es tan asesino como ellos.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Estos son los que llevan EEUU y UK financiando más de un siglo\nA lo más fundamentalista y extremista\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivo:Reagan_sitting_with_people_from_the_Afghanistan-Pakistan_region_in_February_1983.jpg\n[#8](c8#c-8) bajo ninguna circunstancia son culpables de sus actos, siempre es otro, la culpa siempre será de EEUU, de UK, de la sociedad, de la Bernarda, pero nunca ellos y su fanatismo religioso serán los culpables para vosotros.\nVuestra fijación por defender o tapar cada asesino terrorista con escusas es repugnante y os rebaja como... Voy a decir seres humanos.\nEs decir para vosotros el fanatismo islámico viene de un supuesto apoyo de EEUU a hamas y no de irán...\nBoko haram es un paso de baile radicalizado por EEUU.\nLos talibanes son partisanos radicalizados por EEUU.\nLos hermanos musulmanes se radicalizado jugando call of duty.\nPero jamás lobbys, poderes y dinero de países radicales apoyan a estos grupos de mierda.\nAsí es vuestro mundo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) ¿En qué parte de su comentario dice eso? \"no son culpables de sus actos\" y toda la mierda que sigue. O qué parte de su comentario te ha llevado a esa conclusión, si es que necesitas algo más de margen.\nAunque es posible que esa respuesta no tenga nada que ver con su comentario y simplemente sea una patética y lamentable pataleta porque no te ha gustado su respuesta.\n[#17](c17#c-17) \"por no sé que historia\".\n¿O por \"no quiero saber\"? Te dan la oportunidad de aprender, no la desperdicies.\n[#19](c19#c-19) tienes algún comentario de crítica o de repudio a esta atrocidad? O vienes aquí a adoctrinar me sobre lo malo que es eeuu?\nEs una noticia de 160 muertos a manos de yihadistas por ser infieles.\nEntre tu y yo? Es duro entrar aquí a un noticia tan trágica y ponerte a discutir sobre si la culpa es o no es de occidente o ya estás curado de eso?\nEntras aquí a recalcar que \"no quiero saber\" tu verdad... Que ascazo.\n[#21](c21#c-21) Eres tú quien ha introducido este tema. Igual esperabas otro tipo de respuestas y ahora te arrepientes de haberte puesto a chapotear con intención de salpicar a los demás.\n[#23](c23#c-23) en todo momento denunció:\n1* las atrocidades de grupos islamistas radicales, no como tantos aquí que aprendieron que eran los talibanes hace 2 meses y ahora los llaman partisanos. Asesinos es su nombre, como es el del gobierno de irán o Arabia Saudita ente otros.\n2* crítico a los que claramente ocultan y defienden a estos asesinos bajo un pretexto de victimismo en Palestina.\nUn terrorista es un terrorista y lo es con 0 muertos en Palestina y con un millón de muertos.\n[#27](c27#c-27) 1a parte todo bien. Segunda, ya no tanto ¿Cómo que terrorista se es y punto?\n¿Crees de verdad que si a esta gente nadie estuviera tocándole los huevos en su casa harían lo mismo?\nIr a la raíz del problema, a las causas, e intentar desenredar un tema complejo no es defender a nadie.\n[#12](c12#c-12) pero si tu pecas de lo mismo.\nA quien coño quieres dar lecciones?\nEEUU: apoyo yihadistas para quitarse de en medio a un enemigo común.\nTu: apoyas yihadistas para quitarte de en medio un enemigo común.\nEso que tienes ahí llamando nazis es la bandera de Israel no? Imagino que no eres simpatizante, pues eso.\nLa única deferencia entre EEUU y vosotros es que a EEUU sólo le movía la política, a vosotros os pierde el fanatismo.\nSabes lo que más me revienta de vosotros? Que no vais a ser vosotros quien caiga en esa oscuridad por vuestra culpa.\nHabrá niños de 15 que se sentirán libertadores, partisanos, defensores poniendo bombas para un estado islámico por vuestra culpa y vuestros comentarios.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Yo no apoyo yihadistas, eso es Israel que apoya a DAESH\nYo soy de izquierdas, no apoyo a la extrema derecha\nNo es muy dificil de entender, ánimo\n[#18](c18#c-18) otro comentario más de \"la culpa es de todos menos de la yihad y los países de mierda donde reina la sharia\"\nHoy te estás coronado máquina.\nQue lastima que estes aquí criticando a occidente para tapar mierdas de asesinos fanatizados y no allí al revés como los verdaderos mártires que si luchan por denunciar atrocidades de países islámicos, ahí veríamos lo valiente que eres con tu reinvidicacion de sofa y tu bandera nazi con la israelí en la foto de perfil.\n[#25](c25#c-25) Financiasteis a los talibanes para combatir a los rusos y ahora estamos pagando los platos\nFinanciar ISIS para destruir oriente medio\nFinanciar siempre lo peor para seguir con los genocidios, apartheid, limpieza étnica...\n[#26](c26#c-26) \"Financiasteis a los talibanes\"\nyo no financie a nadie, manipulador de pacotilla. Típico de esos de la bandera de tu perfil.\nMuestras muchos decíamos que la primavera árabe está plagado de fanáticos religiosos que apoyaban las reveliones, tantos otros decían que \"callate, hacen lo que deberíamos estar haciendo en Europa, es una revolución\". Ahora a gente como tú, si tu, que estás criticando a los críticos con el yihadismo de hamas se le avisa que apoyar grupos terroristas que hacen matanzas públicas es una barbaridad y que esto les embalentona y atrae a más fanáticos y que será la perdición de Palestina no escucháis. Dentro de 10 años saldrán muchos de Europa que han visto gritos de Allahu adbak y tontos en Internet diciendo que el único error de hamas es no haber actuado antes... Luego habrán chavales que pensarán que están siendo héroes en un Isis o unos talibanes dando su vida por puercos que vienen a cuerpo de rey con 4 mujeres y esclavas sexuales.\n[#18](c18#c-18) para tí seguro que extrema derecha es alguien de izquierdas que no compre el pack correntista de turno.\n[#8](c8#c-8) Reagan murió hace 20 años y dejó la presidencia hace 35... De verdad tu argumento más solido es usar una foto de hace 40 años? Alguna prueba que adjuntar a la afirmación de la financiación de EEUU y UK a los culpables de este atentado?\nAcaso guarda alguna relación Reagan reuniéndose con los muyahidines hace 40 años con este atentado en Nigeria y yo no me he enterado?\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nEstos terroristas de Nigeria? Un pelín racista por tu parte hacer un batiburrillo basándote únicamente en que son integristas musulmanes.",
