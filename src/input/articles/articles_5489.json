    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "Wolf connected to livestock killings could be breeding, wildlife officials say Published in [News & Features](/currentnews/newsheadlines/) Wildlife officials said they will not remove a gray wolf potentially connected to recent livestock killings, despite requests from stockgrowers. Two of the gray wolves reintroduced to Colorado’s Grand County in December — including one suspected in recent depredations — are likely “denning” and in the breeding process, Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials said in a letter to the Middle Park Stockgrowers Board Tuesday. The letter came in response to a request from the board to lethally remove two wolves suspected in the livestock attacks. Removing the male wolf “would be irresponsible management and potentially cause the den to fail, possibly resulting in the death of the presumed pups,” CPW Director Jeff Davis wrote in Tuesday’s letter. In early April, the female wolf’s GPS stopped uploading location points to the server and only started uploading again recently, according to Davis. Officials believe she was in the den, which interrupted the tracking collar’s signal and aligns with the expected timing of wolf reproduction. CPW officers are working to confirm the den’s location. Colorado’s first confirmed wolf depredation incident happened on April 2 in Grand County. The second attack came just five days later, 60 miles north in Jackson County. On April 18, the total number of livestock killed by wolves reached six as wildlife officials confirmed two more calf attacks. Amid reports of livestock attacks and depredations, one of the 10 gray wolves reintroduced to Colorado was found dead in Larimer County, federal officials confirmed Tuesday. Initial evidence shows the wolf likely died of natural causes, but an official autopsy has not yet been completed. “The wolf population in Colorado is far below any restoration goal,” Davis wrote in Tuesday’s letter. “We have the legal duty to establish a self-sustaining population of wolves while minimizing conflict risk.” As the wolf population in Colorado grows, the approach to lethal removals will likely become more liberal, Davis wrote.",

    "title": "One-quarter of employers planning pay rises of at least 5% in 2024 - HR News",
    "text": "Nearly a quarter (24%) of employers predict that the main pay rise for staff in 2024 is likely to be at least 5%, according to an IDR poll of 158 mostly large private sector organisations. The research also revealed that nearly half of employers – some 46% – said they intend to award increases of between 4% and 4.99%. While increases worth at least 4% are set to continue, the poll also found that two-thirds of employers anticipate that their 2024 pay award will be a lower increase when compared to this year. A further 27% said that the level of pay rise in 2024 is likely to be the same as the level of increase awarded in 2023 and just 7% of employers in the sample expect that pay awards in 2024 will be higher when compared to this year’s outcomes. These findings hint at an easing of pay pressures and that pay awards will most likely trend downwards from the median pay award of 5.6% that we have observed in 2023. “Although the coming trend in pay awards is likely to be down on the past year, on the whole they are likely to remain higher than they were prior to 2023”, commented Zoe Woolacott from IDR. Median for January at 4.4% IDR’s regular monitoring of pay outcomes bears out the findings from the poll. Our monitoring of pay awards shows that the median pay increase across the economy in 2023 was 5.6% but an early look at outcomes already decided for 2024 shows that the median pay award across the economy has fallen and currently stands at 4.4%. These latest figures are based on a sample of 42 awards effective between 1 January and 31 October 2024, mostly at large organisations and together covering over 140,000 employees. The results predominantly reflect the picture in the private sector. Higher-end awards worth 4% or more represent over three-fifths (62%) of deals effective in 2024 so far – down from 86% of awards in 2023. Affordability and competitiveness are key influences on pay Survey participants were asked to indicate the main influences on their organisations’ pay decisions for 2024. Affordability and pressure to remain competitive proved to be the top two factors with around four-fifths of respondents citing these as one of the main influences – 85% and 80% respectively. The third most influential factor in pay decisions this year is inflation, as indicated by 69% of participants. This proportion, while it has fallen from 85% in a similar poll we conducted regarding pay intentions for 2023, shows that inflation and the cost of living continues to figure highly in employers’ concerns regarding pay. The next most influential factor was employee morale and motivation. This was followed by the National Living Wage (cited by 34% of employers in the sample), while a smaller proportion (29%) indicated that the ‘real living wage’ (a voluntary rate based on estimations of the wage needed to provide a socially acceptable standard of living and which takes the cost of living into greater account that the statutory floor) will be an influence on their pay decisions for 2024.",

    "text": "The Economic Policy Institute estimates that 91,000 Nebraska workers — 9.5% of Nebraska’s workforce — saw a wage increase when the state’s minimum wage went up on Jan. 1, 2024.​\nThe bump is the second in a series of annual increases voters approved in 2022.\nBallot Initiative 433 was an effort of Raise the Wage Nebraska, largely supported financially by labor unions and various progressive organizations.\nOn Jan. 1, 2023, the minimum wage went from $9 an hour to $10.50 an hour. It will increase to $13.50 on Jan. 1, 2025, and to $15 on Jan. 1, 2026.\nPeople are also reading… Man found dead in NW Lincoln lake after report of submerged car Fourth generation set to lead Lincoln's largest bank Lincoln man lied on food stamp application, defrauded government of more than $25K, officials say Grain elevator in the heart of Lincoln up for sale Minnesota All-American outside hitter Taylor Landfair transfers to Nebraska Lancaster County Sheriff to put six automatic license plate readers along I-80 Amie Just: Predicting 2024 for Nebraska Athletics — and beyond Driver violated red light in 70th Street and Nebraska Parkway crash, LPD says Ruling allows Nebraska employees to continue working remotely — for now These 4 moms, home in Waterloo for the holidays, always can ask a sister for baby advice Shooting suspect arrested in I-80 traffic stop, Nebraska State Patrol says LFR responds to fire at Lazlo's in south Lincoln Nebraska football reserve linebacker enters transfer portal Double blessings: Twin brothers welcome babies on same day in Lincoln Alvo couple welcomes first baby of 2024 in Lincoln Rebecca Firestone, executive director of Nebraska's Open Sky Policy Institute, said the gradual increases will help Nebraskans.\n\"Hardworking Nebraskans deserve an economy that respects their work and enables them to support their families and contribute to their communities,\" Firestone said.\nThe increase will help to reduce racial income disparity and provide low- and middle-income Nebraskans with much needed protection against inflation, she said.\nMark Whitehead, chair of the Lincoln Independent Business Association, said the change in the minimum wage is less important than market forces. A strong economy, he said, means a lower unemployment rate and produces higher pay.\n\"The Lincoln labor market has been well below effectively zero unemployment, as defined as 4% by most economists, for a significant number of years,\" he said. \"As such, for almost all service-level businesses, the minimum wage is irrelevant. The market dictates a much higher rate.\"\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\nMost businesses in the service sector are paying far more than $12 an hour, he said.\nThere may be some association members that are currently at $10.50 per hour, but he said they have developed strategies that drive value to their associates beyond the pay offered.\n\"Moving that rate to $12 per hour would have to get them to rethink their strategies on how they will continue to survive and hopefully thrive in this new environment,\" he said. ​\n​Nebraska is among 22 states that raised the minimum wage Jan. 1, according to Forbes Advisor.\nFor workers who are mainly compensated by tips, such as waitresses, waiters and bus persons, the Nebraska minimum hourly pay rate is $2.13 per hour. The sum of the $2.13 per hour plus all tips given to the individual must equal or exceed the required minimum wage for all hours worked.​​\nNeighboring states also set new minimums: Colorado, $14.42; Missouri, $12.30; South Dakota, $11.20.\nThe minimum wage in Iowa and Kansas is $7.25 an hour, same as the federal minimum, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The federal minimum wage has not increased since July 2009.\nAcross the country, an estimated 9.9 million workers will receive an increase, the Economic Policy Institute reported.\nIn total, workers will receive $6.95 billion in additional wages from state minimum wage increases, it said. In addition, 38 cities and counties will increase their minimum wages on Jan. 1 above their state’s wage floors, adding to the number of workers likely to see increased earnings, it said.\nAt the start of the new year, 22 states and 43 cities and counties are increasing the hourly minimum wage, benefiting nearly 10 million people. And that doesn't only affect workers at major fast food chains or retail outlets; it also includes people who work at small, locally-owned businesses.\nScripps News The Journal Star's most memorable photos of 2023",
