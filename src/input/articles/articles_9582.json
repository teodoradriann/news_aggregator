    "text": "Hot Deal: Get A Pair Of EcoFlow 100W Solar Panels For $150\ndaily news updates from CleanTechnicaon email. Or follow us on Google News!\nOne of the biggest talking points for going solar has been the promise of “free electricity,” which was a bit of a stretch, considering that the initial outlay for solar panels used to be quite hefty. However, given the long effective life that solar panels generally have (20+ years), it was certainly possible for them to produce enough electricity over the years to cover the relatively high cost then, and to continue providing clean and “free” electricity for a long time. And now, with the dropping cost of solar panels of all shapes and sizes, from the small and lightweight or thin film folding panels to the larger ‘standard’ rooftop panels, it’s possible to get in on the renewable energy revolution with an even lower buy-in.\nIf you’ve been sitting on the proverbial fence about acquiring the equipment to grab some solar electrons of your own, whether you want to offset some of your electricity costs or you want ensure that the power is still flowing at your home in the event of a blackout or emergency, it might behoove you to take a close look at this hot deal on solar panels from\nEcoFlow.\nA pair of 100W solar panels from EcoFlow, which normally sells for about $250,\nis currently on sale for $149 on Amazon, and with the promise of producing up to 500 Wh / 45 Ah of electricity per day, they could be the right choice for building a decent solar array for a variety of applications. They are dirt-, dust-, and waterproof (IP68), have pre-drilled mounting holes, and weigh about 13.6 pounds per pair, so installing them on a rack for the rooftop of an RV, boat, tiny house, shed, cabin, or as a ground-mounted system for remote or home backup power won’t require a structural engineer, and at their current sale price are affordable enough to buy in multiples for a good-sized array. And they pair well with EcoFlow portable power stations, so storing your harvested electrons will be easy-peasy.\nHave a tip for CleanTechnica? Want to advertise?

    "text": "Adult film actress Jesse Jane has passed away at the age of 44, according to a recent report from Deadline . Jane was reportedly found dead by police on Thursday morning alongside her boyfriend at their residence in Oklahoma. Oklahoma City’s KOCO 5 TV channel also reported that police officers found the couple while conducting a welfare check around 11 a.m., and that both people were found unresponsive due to what is suspected to be drug overdoses. Police officers on the scene identified the couple as Jane — real name Cindy Taylor — and her boyfriend Brett Hasenmueller. KOCO TV notes that substances from the scene have been sent in for lab testing. Jane’s career in the adult film industry began in 2002 and lasted for 15 years before she officially retired in 2017. Outside of the adult film world, Jane also appeared in a variety of uncredited TV and film appearances, including having appeared in Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding, Starsky and Hutch, and Entourage. ComingSoon sends its condolences to the families of all involved. Anthony Nash Anthony Nash has been writing about games and the gaming industry for nearly a decade.

    "text": "Scottie Scheffler appreciates his\nTexas roots, if this year's Champions Dinner menu is any indication. And he definitely knows what he likes.\nScheffler is repeating his menu from the Champions Dinner\nat the Masters two years ago. The menu starts with cheeseburger sliders \"served Scottie-style\" and firecracker shrimp with sweet Thai chili sauce and sriracha mayo.\nChampions will also get to savor the flavor of\nTexas-style chili topped with Cheddar cheese and jalapeños, which is a slight change from Scheffler's 2023 soup course, chicken tortilla soup.\nThen guests will have two choices for the main course: a wood-fired\ncowboy ribeye or blackened redfish. Sides lean toward hearty and include mac and cheese and jalapeño creamed corn. The champions will polish off the meal with a warm chocolate-chip skillet cookie and vanilla-bean ice cream.\nThere's one surprise addition this year that doesn't quite fit the Tex-Mex theme: Papa Scheff's Meatball & Ravioli Bites. Scheffler apparently felt obliged to include the recipe after famously cutting open his hand with a wine glass while making homemade ravioli earlier this year, according to\nCBS Sports. Scheffler ending up missing tournaments because of the injury.\nThe\ndefending Masters champion selects the menu for the exclusive, invitation-only dinner each year. We're hoping to see some photos of Scheffler's dishes in April—and that his dinner is an injury-free event.",

    "text": "News Direct Grayscale CEO Foresees Bitcoin Price Surging to $55k, Ethereum and Everlodge Poised for Substantial Growth Read full article 9 News Direct December 28, 2023 at 8:00 PM · 4 min read\nNews Direct NYC --News Direct-- Everlodge\nThe future for crypto still looks bright. Allied Market Research released a report that the cryptocurrency market value is about to triple by 2030, hitting a whopping $4.94 billion. What's fueling this crypto rocket? According to Allied, it's the focus of cryptocurrency on remittances and global payments taking the lead – put in one word, utility .\nFrom all indications, cryptocurrency is gearing up to be a big player in the future of global finance; but that's 7 years away from now according to the AMR. However, in the near term, investors are eager to know what lies ahead in 2024.\nNotably, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the recently emerged presale utility-focused gem, Everlodge, have all demonstrated the potential for substantial returns. While the reasons behind their promising prospects are quite evident, let’s take a quick dive to see why these projects rank among the best crypto investments to consider ahead of 2024.\nGrayscale CEO Optimistic on Bitcoin While Crypto Wizard Target Remains $55,000 for Bitcoin in Q1 2024 Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein is seeing big potential for Bitcoin (BTC) once the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gives the thumbs up to a spot market BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nIn a recent CNBC interview, Sonnenshein, though not one to throw around price predictions, emphasizes the prevailing optimism in the market. According to him, a substantial number of investors are jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon and integrating it into their portfolios. As we anticipate the potential approval of the ETF, he believes it will be a game-changer, unlocking opportunities for a significant portion of the investment community.\nAs per price predictions, analyst Crypto Wizard posted on X, talking about a potential dip in Bitcoin price below the $40k threshold in the weeks ahead. They note that in the event of any deviation from this prediction, a decisive break above $46k for Bitcoin would be the game-changer. Despite these short-term fluctuations, their overall target stands firm at $55k for Bitcoin price by the first quarter of 2024.\nStory continues Ethereum Looks Bullish for 2024 The immense popularity of the Ethereum (ETH) network has positioned it among the leading altcoins in today's market. Its widespread appeal is not the only factor contributing to its positive sentiment; Ethereum also benefits from a history of resilience and market dominance.\nWith a current price of $2,230, Ethereum has experienced significant growth in the past month, reaching a peak of around $2,367 to mark the highest point of the year. While the overall bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market may be waning, Ethereum price has managed to remain relatively stable, with a nearly 2% increase over the past week.\nHowever, considering the recent drop of over $100 from its peak, investors should be prepared for a potential further correction. Yet, given Ethereum's historical price resilience and strong market presence, it is reasonable to expect a more stable price trajectory leading up to the new year.\nEverlodge Has Lofty Plans To Take Charge in Q1 2024 Everlodge (ELDG) emerged as a revolutionary force in the real estate realm, positioned to revolutionize the $280 trillion industry by tackling long-standing challenges. Traditionally, the prohibitively high entry costs, often reaching millions of dollars, combined with a lack of transparency and liquidity, have created barriers for numerous potential investors.\nEverlodge's DeFi property marketplace directly confronts these challenges within the travel property sector. Through the innovative approach of listing properties as NFTs on its platform, Everlodge introduces fractionalized ownership, allowing investors to purchase NFT fractions representing a percentage of a property. Imagine owning 25% of a property generating $6,000 monthly, resulting in a $1,500 passive income.\nIn essence, Everlodge not only breaks down barriers but also provides investors with the opportunity to access equity in some of the world's most luxurious travel properties and you can join in for only $0.027.\nFurthermore, industry experts predict a potential 10X surge in Everlodge's project valuation if the company successfully achieves crucial milestones. This projection highlights the anticipation surrounding Everlodge's transformative initiatives and underscores the potential for significant growth, positioning it as one of the best crypto investments leading up to 2024.\nLooking ahead, the probability of a positive upturn in cryptocurrency in 2024 is very much palpable and projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Everlodge have everything to fight for to become the best coins to invest in 2024.\nFor more information about the ongoing Everlodge (ELDG) Presale, please visit their website .\nEverlodge provides you with a seamless approach to fractional investing in vacation rentals, eliminating the complexities associated with traditional real estate investment.
