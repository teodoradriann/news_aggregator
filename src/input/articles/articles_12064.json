    "text": "YULEE, Fla. — Viewer photos flooded in Thursday night after two days of weather effects from Hurricane Milton. As skies cleared, locals from Southeast Georgia to Jacksonville's Northside got a glimpse of a rare sight: the Northern Lights. This May, the Northern Lights were visible Jacksonville for the first time since 1989. Prior to that, it was in [September of 1941 during the Aurora blitz.](/article/weather/aurora-seen-in-jacksonville/77-7da68e33-1760-4cbe-9d42-74eb906b4112) YOUR PHOTOS: Northern Lights illuminate Florida & Georgia skies The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a severe geomagnetic storm watch for Thursday into Friday after an outburst from the sun was detected earlier this week. Such a storm could temporarily disrupt power and radio signals. NOAA has notified operators of power plants and orbiting spacecraft to take precautions. It also alerted the Federal Emergency Management Agency about possible power disruptions, as the organization copes with the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Helene and gears up for Hurricane Milton barreling across the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida. Forecasters do not expect the latest solar storm to surpass the one that slammed Earth in May, the strongest in more than two decades. But they won't know for sure until it's just 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away, where spacecraft can measure it. Florida is far enough south to avoid any power disruptions from the solar surge unless it gets a lot bigger, said scientist Rob Steenburgh of NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center.",

    "text": "Hackers Don’t Take PTO: Why Travel Season Is Prime Time for Cyberattacks\nWhen vacationers unwind and employees unplug, cybercriminals clock in for their busiest time of year.\nThe travel and hospitality industries are a top target for cyberattacks. Booking portals, mobile apps and reservation systems create a sprawling network of public-facing entry points that are difficult to secure.\nIn April 2025, cybersecurity researchers identified more than 95,000 vulnerabilities across hospitality platforms, including 14,000 classified as critical. Add that baseline risk with a summer surge in traveler data and fewer staff on duty, and it creates the perfect storm for cyberattacks.\nDon’t let your busiest season become your most vulnerable. Strengthen your security to keep transactions secure, maintain customer trust and safeguard sensitive data.\nHackers Capitalize on Hospitality’s Peak Season\nDuring peak travel season, travelers rush to finalize plans — booking flights, reserving hotel rooms and checking in on the go.\nAs a result, more personally identifiable information (PII) — from email addresses to credit card and passport numbers — flows through hospitality platforms during this season than any other point in the year. Much of it is entered quickly, often over unsecured networks and public-facing systems.\nAt the same time, internal teams are stretched thin by seasonal PTO, leaving fewer people to catch unusual activity or respond to alerts. It’s an ideal scenario for hackers: sensitive data moving through exposed systems, with limited oversight to spot suspicious activity.\nCybercriminals understand these vulnerabilities, and their tactics are rapidly evolving. Many now use generative AI to create convincing phishing emails, fake booking confirmations and even deepfake voicemails impersonating guest services or IT support.\nFor example, an attacker might spoof a hotel’s booking confirmation email with a fraudulent link. A guest, eager to confirm details, clicks through and enters their credentials — unknowingly sharing credit card details, upcoming trip data and enough PII to launch follow-up attacks or fraudulent bookings.\nEven the most secure platforms aren’t immune to data breaches. In June 2025, a breach exposed more than 16 billion login credentials from tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook. The scope was historic, and the message clear: If industry leaders with massive security budgets can be compromised, hospitality brands must be even more proactive about securing their sites.\nAs warmer weather peaks, so does the risk of cyberattacks. Hackers’ tactics are smarter, and the window for detection is smaller. Now is the time to secure your systems before a busy season turns into a security crisis.\n4 Ways to Fortify Your Site From Hackers\nWith more travelers submitting sensitive data to hospitality sites and fewer staff available to oversee systems, cybercriminals are well positioned to exploit the opportunity.\nTo stay secure, your site needs layered, preemptive defenses. The following four strategies can help you safeguard customer data, stay PCI compliant and maintain trust from the moment a guest visits your site to the second they check out.\n1. Audit Your Infrastructure and Close Gaps\nStart with a comprehensive vulnerability assessment across your public-facing systems, from login portals to reservation platforms. Penetration testing by a trusted third party can simulate real-world breach attempts, helping you identify weak spots before attackers do.\nWhile compliance with PCI DSS 4.0 is critical and represents an important improvement, it should be viewed as a solid foundation rather than a complete solution. True protection requires layered security beyond compliance checkboxes.\nAt the transaction level, 3D Secure (3DS) adds another layer of defense by authenticating the cardholder in real time through the issuing ban. While PCI 3DS is mandatory in Europe and widely used to verify high-value online transactions, it remains optional in the U.S. Even so, U.S. hospitality brands can benefit from adopting it proactively to prevent unauthorized purchases.\nFor card-present transactions, adopting PCI-validated Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE) is the gold standard, immediately encrypting cardholder data upon dip, tap, swipe or key entry, ensuring that no payment data is exposed upon entry or in transit.\n2. Implement End-To-End Encryption and Tokenization\nIf attackers manage to breach your systems, encryption ensures they can’t decipher what they steal. By partnering with a trusted payment security provider, you can encrypt data as it moves through your network, making it unreadable without a decryption key.\nTokenization provides an added layer of protection in case that key is compromised. It replaces actual card or personal information with randomized, unrecognizable tokens that hold no exploitable value.\nFor example, if a hotel’s payment database is breached, tokenization prevents exposure of real credit card numbers or guest details — attackers would only find format-preserving tokens that have no mathematical or cryptographic relationship to the original data, rendering them useless without authorized access to the tokenization system.\n3. Train Employees to Recognize Social Engineering Attacks\nReduced staffing and PTO coverage during the summer may increase the chances of warning signs of a phishing attack going unnoticed. Just one click on a fraudulent login page can grant attackers network access or launch malware.\nRegular training is essential to help employees recognize threats like fake invoices, credential-stealing links or AI-generated voicemails impersonating executives. Simulated phishing exercises — like fake guest complaint emails — reinforce this training in a safe, realistic context.\nEqually important are clear reporting protocols. Employees should know exactly how to report suspicious messages and whom to contact, even when key leaders are out of the office.\n4. Prepare for High-Traffic, Low Coverage Periods\nWithout a clear coverage plan, employee vacations leave gaps in oversight, slowing threat detection and increasing the risk of delayed responses.\nTo maintain readiness, security operations need to run at full strength — even when staffing is limited. Fortunately, automated monitoring and alerting systems don’t take time off. These solutions should be put in place to encrypt and tokenize data from point-to-point, with designated personnel on-call to respond to incidents. Essential updates — like software patches and security maintenance — should never be delayed due to limited staff availability.\nNow is also the time to test the effectiveness of your response procedures. If a breach happens over a holiday weekend, your team should be ready to act immediately and confidently.\nTravel Security Starts Now\nCybercriminals don’t take vacations, and your defenses can’t afford to either. With more guest data flowing through your systems and fewer eyes on alerts, this is the most vulnerable time for your site’s cybersecurity.\nThat’s why layered defenses like encryption and tokenization — which operate continuously — are essential. Combined with well-trained staff and proactive planning, they allow your guests to focus on the trip ahead while your team delivers a seamless user experience.\nFrom the moment a guest lands on your website until they tap “Book Now,” every interaction should be protected. Secure your systems now so that a data breach doesn’t disrupt your busiest quarter.\nLooking for a reprint of this article?\nFrom high-res PDFs to custom plaques, order your copy today!",

    "text": "Aumenta presión internacional en la ONU al gobierno de Maduro en Venezuela\nNaciones Unidas (Estados Unidos) (AFP) – La voces de la comunidad internacional se alzaron contra el gobierno de Nicolás Maduro durante la mayor cita diplomática anual de la ONU en Nueva York para que ponga fin a la crisis poselectoral y entable un diálogo con la oposición para iniciar una transición pacífica.\nPrimera modificación: Última modificación:\nUna treintena de países liderados por Estados Unidos y Argentina instaron este jueves a los líderes políticos venezolanos a que inicien negociaciones \"constructivas e inclusivas\" con vistas a una \"transición con garantías\" para resolver la crisis política y \"restaurar las instituciones democráticas pacíficamente\".\nAsimismo pidieron el fin de la \"represión generalizada\" contra la oposición y de \"los abusos y violaciones de los derechos humanos\" tras la victoria de Nicolás Maduro, que la oposición considera fraudulenta, en las elecciones del 28 de julio.\nMaduro fue declarado ganador con el 52% de los votos para un tercer periodo consecutivo, sin haber presentado hasta ahora los resultados detallados del escrutinio, como obliga la ley.\nLiderada por María Corina Machado, la oposición publicó en un sitio web copias de cerca de 80% de las actas electorales, que demostrarían la victoria de su candidato, Edmundo González Urrutia. El opositor se exilió en España a inicios de septiembre luego de permanecer más de un mes en la clandestinidad.\nLa proclamación del mandatario izquierdista desató protestas que dejaron 27 muertos -dos de ellos militares-, casi 200 heridos y más de 2.000 detenidos, según cifras oficiales.\nSegún un panel de expertos de la ONU, el proceso electoral de Venezuela \"no cumplió con las medidas básicas de transparencia e integridad\".\nUna misión de observadores del Centro Carter consideró que la elección \"no se adecuó a parámetros y estándares internacionales de integridad electoral y no puede ser considerada como democrática\".\n\"Escuchar sus voces\"\n\"Si tenemos un objetivo único, éste es garantizar que la voluntad y los votos del pueblo venezolano sean realmente respetados, que puedan determinar su propio futuro\" y sus voces sean \"escuchadas\", dijo el jefe de la diplomacia estadounidense, Antony Blinken, en la apertura de la reunión realizada con países mayoritariamente europeos y algunos latinoamericanos. Entre éstos no aparecían Brasil, Colombia o México, según la lista del departamento de Estado.\nDesde la tribuna de la Asamblea General muchos mandatarios latinoamericanos han pedido a Venezuela que muestre y reconozca los resultados de las urnas, lo que es considerado en Caracas como \"ataques terroristas\" contra el presidente Maduro.\nEste jueves, el uruguayo Luis Lacalle Pou pidió a la ONU \"actuar por Venezuela\".\n\"Todos sabemos lo que viene pasando ya hace mucho tiempo en este país. Y muchos gobiernos y muchos líderes mundiales han mirado para el costado, por falta de interés de algunos de ellos, o lamentablemente algunos por interés\", enfatizó.\nEl presidente del gobierno español, el socialista Pedro Sánchez, también había considerado \"imperativo el respeto de la voluntad del pueblo venezolano\" y condenó las \"detenciones o amenazas contra los líderes políticos\".\n7,8 millones de migrantes\nEn los últimos 25 años, desde la llegada de Hugo Chávez, reemplazado a su muerte en 2013 por Maduro, unos 7,8 millones de venezolanos han salido del país. La mayoría a los países vecinos, como Colombia, Perú, Chile, Argentina o Ecuador.\nAunque en los dos últimos años muchos se han dirigido a Estados Unidos. Solo en el último año, unos 477.000 cruzaron a pie el Darién, dijo recientemente la organización HRW.\nChile ya \"no está en condiciones de recibir más migración\" de Venezuela, advirtió el martes el presidente Gabriel Boric en la ONU.\nBoric, que ha denunciado \"el fraude electoral\" de Maduro, culpó de la crisis migratoria también a las sanciones económicas por Estados Unidos.\n\"Las sanciones económicas golpean más al pueblo venezolano que a sus actuales gobernantes. Golpean a los humildes, a los trabajadores\", dijo el mandatario.\nAl régimen de Maduro \"no le importa su gente\", sostuvo por su parte la canciller argentina Diana Mondino, que reconoció \"que no siempre es fácil absorber ese increíble\" número de migrantes.\nLa justicia argentina, recordó, ha emitido órdenes de detención por crímenes contra la humanidad dirigidas a Maduro y una treintena de responsables de su gobierno.\n© 2024 AFP",

    "title": "Google Scraps Pixel Tablet 2 Plans, but Future Tablet Development Still Possible",
    "text": "Google has reportedly canceled the development of its second-generation Pixel Tablet, according to recent reports (Via 9to5Google ) from Android Authority. The decision comes amid concerns about potential financial losses from the project, marking a significant shift in Google’s tablet strategy.\nInitial rumors suggested that Google had ambitious plans for its tablet line, with the Pixel Tablet 2 planned for 2025 and a third-generation device, codenamed “Kiyomi,” slated for 2027. The canceled device was expected to maintain a similar design to its predecessor while featuring thinner bezels and introducing a new first-party keyboard cover accessory with a touchpad.\nThe development team had reportedly been working on enhanced features, including a 5G variant, though the project was still in its early development and prototyping stages. While Android Headlines initially reported the cancellation of a “Pixel Tablet 3,” Android Authority clarified that the terminated project was actually the Pixel Tablet 2.\nDespite this setback, sources indicate that Google hasn’t completely abandoned its tablet ambitions. The company may still proceed with its rumored Tensor G6-powered model planned for 2027, suggesting a potential return to the tablet market in the future.\nCurrent Pixel Tablet owners need not worry about support, as the cancellation won’t affect future software updates. Google maintains its commitment to large-screen Android development, particularly given the continued popularity of foldable devices. The platform will continue to receive updates, including desktop windowing features expected in Android 15 QPR1 this December, and the company’s reported ChromeOS-to-Android migration efforts will maintain focus on desktop-level optimizations.",

    "title": "Scientific Societies Err on 'Climate Change' - American Thinker",
    "text": "Major scientific organizations’ statements on “climate change” and the conclusions therein form the basis of much of the scientific foundation for governmental, scientific, media, and public concerns on the use of fossil fuels. Trillions of public and private dollars are currently being spent on alternative fuels to “save the planet” from the alleged harm of increasing CO2, a gas which is vital for life on earth. If the evaluations of these societies are erroneous, these measures could impoverish much of the world, to say nothing of wasting trillions. Economic damage and social unrest are already evident in some countries, including the United States. It is therefore imperative for all that their views be based on sound science, and if not, these societies should change their statements.\nA recent publication and podcast have examined the scientific organization’s climate statements, and have found numerous errors, errors which are easy to find by simply comparing the societies’ statements with data from such reliable sources as NOAA, NASA, and others. These societies are the American Physical Society (APS), American Meteorological Society (AMS), National Academy of Science (NAS), American Chemical Society (ACS), and American Geophysical Union (AGU).\nHere is one example. The AGU states “Greater CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are also affecting the growth and nutritional value of land plants…” Numerous studies, including measurements of terrestrial plant life from space, and measurements of crop production , have shown that if anything, increasing CO2 has increased both plant life and crop production. After all, CO2 is a vital nutrient for plants, and the slight warming we have experienced, possibly in part due to the increased CO2, has increased the growing seasons in the temperate latitudes.\nAs another example, the ACS statement asserts: “Extreme weather and related events, such as floods, droughts… are increasing in frequency and intensity, threatening Americans’ physical, social, and economic well-being.”. The frequency and intensity of floods and droughts is measured by what is called NOAA’s Palmer drought index and this index is displayed as a graph vs of index versus year. It shows clearly, that in the United States the worst sustained droughts in the U.S. were in the 1930s and 1950s, and the worst sustained floods were in the 1970s through the 1990s.\nTens of thousands of scientists, including over 10,000 with Ph.Ds., have critically examined the evidence, and have concluded that a CO2-induced climate crisis is extremely unlikely. They have willingly and publicly asserted this, by adding their names to document such as, the Oregon petition , Clintel Climate Petition , and the CO2 Coalition . Among other things, the societies should not ignore these, professional conclusions of many of their members.\nAccordingly, and with humility, I suggest that these societies do the following:\nReplace their climate statements with ones that say there is most likely an effect humans have on the changing climate, but its importance for humanity is uncertain and it is still being debated. Eliminate statements that are demonstrably incorrect, as shown by comparison with easily available and reliable data. Acknowledge in their statements that fossil fuels cannot be replaced in the next several decades without greatly endangering our civilization. Acknowledge in their statements that CO2 has obvious obvious benefit for human existence, as well as potential risks. By changing their statements to ones that are more moderate and scientifically correct, these societies will not only be helping the professions they serve, but more important, will ultimately be aiding humanity. On the other hand, if they keep their statements as they are, they will remain on the wrong side of history, and posterity will not look kindly on them. And posterity may be arriving sooner than they think. With a Republican Congress and President Trump referring to the “green new scam,” these society presidents may find themselves hauled before Congress to receive the university president treatment.\nAfter all, the APS statement says, “Multiple lines of evidence strongly support the finding that anthropogenic greenhouse gases have become the dominant driver of global climate warming observed since the mid-twentieth century.” What will its president say when the congressman puts up a graph showing that for 30 years in the early decades of the 20th century, the warming rate was the same or greater? Or when he puts up a map proving that the northern forests, 4000 years ago extended about 200 miles further north worldwide than they do today. Or shows that 2000 years ago, the Romans had vineyards in England extending all the way to Hadrian’s wall, millennia before cold weather grapes had been developed. Or when he shows evidence that 1000 years ago the Vikings grew barley in Greenland, something not possible today. Surely this proves that the world had many warmer periods without the help of extra CO2 in the atmosphere.\nThere are many such statements that Congress can quote, to very publicly humiliate these society presidents. As a committed life fellow of the APS, I hope these societies will change their statements now, before the roof collapses on them.\nImage: U.S. Dept. of State",
