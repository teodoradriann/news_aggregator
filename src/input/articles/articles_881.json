The man was living with the children and their mother in Danielskuil near Postmasburg.\nThe case emanates from an incident in 2018 when the mother of the two girls left the man with her children as she went looking for their elder brother who had allegedly been stabbed, National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Mojalefa Senokoatsane said.\nThe man went to their mother's bedroom where they were sleeping and raped them.\nThey reported the incident to their aunt, who immediately informed their mother. The man was arrested and charged.\n“During the trial, the two children were able to point out the accused in court. They demonstrated the way the accused had covered their mouth with his hand when they cried and detailed the pain they felt when he was raping them.”\nAfter the state closed its case, the defence also closed its case without calling the man to testify.\nIn sentencing, the court was satisfied with the evidence by the state witnesses including the medical evidence.\nTimesLIVE",

    "text": "The son of the owner and deputy managing director of Mahmud Jeans Ltd, Rafee Mahmud, was beaten yesterday (28 November) by the factory's workers, who have been demanding their outstanding salaries. Rafee, who is also the vice-president of Bangladesh Apparel Youth Leaders Association (Bayla), in a statement to members of Bayla today (29 November) said, \"They [workers] tried to murder me yesterday. I couldn't even speak for two minutes before the mob started attacking from all around.\" \"Later I was dragged and slammed under the flyover and was assaulted by big bricks, metal rod and tree branches. As soon as I got hit on the back of my head I fainted for a while. \"Later when I became conscious, I felt them grabbing my neck suffocating me and dragging me into my factory and later they locked me inside,\" added his statement. Yesterday, workers of Mahmud Jeans Limited in Gazipur's Kaliakoir staged a demonstration blocking the Dhaka-Tangail highway all day, demanding their due wages. The blockade began at 9am today (28 November) causing traffic congestion stretching several kilometres on both sides. However, at around 8pm, the blockade was lifted on one side of the highway easing the congestion. Police and workers said the protest erupted over unpaid dues, including one month's outstanding wages for workers, service benefits, and delayed salaries of six to nine months for some factory officials. The workers further said in August, they had to stage a prolonged demonstration for unpaid wages, which had accumulated to five months at that time. Although the owners settled some payments then, dues for some workers remained. According to sources, Rafee Mahmud has been trying to sell property to pay the dues. He went to the factory yesterday evening to discuss the workers' dues that is when he was attacked. In the message to Bayla members Rafee Mahmud also said his mobile phone and all his belongings were stolen. \"Dear brothers and sisters we need to make a strong statement, if we don't stand up immediately we will lose our control over our employees and workers,\" he added. \"It was pre planned and thankfully I got proof of conversation they made in their group. I pray for all of us and the industry, we are all unsafe,\" he said.",

    "text": "PHOENIX ( KPHO /Gray News) - A Phoenix woman says someone has stolen her identity and has charged thousands of dollars’ worth of medical care in her name.\n“The bills are outrageous. I get a new bill every day, and I just want to cry,” Jennifer O’Connor said. “For just the surgery, it was $217,000.”\nO’Connor thumbed through a stack of papers, including other bills for $32,000 and $9,300.\nShe says she has lost track of the total.\n“I’m getting bills from CT scans, bills from anesthesiologists, different doctors that she saw at the hospital. It’s just overwhelming,” O’Connor said. “She used my insurance at Banner because I have Banner insurance. At HonorHealth, she did not use insurance, so she just gave them my information and said, ‘I don’t have insurance.’”\nO’Connor said the first sign of a problem was when she received a bill from an anesthesiologist.\n“Twenty-four hundred dollars for anesthesia, and I’m like, anesthesia? When did I go under anesthesia?” she said. “I looked more into it, and all I had to do to get into it was put in my date of birth, and bam. There’s the bill.”\nThe real O’Connor is a respiratory therapist at a Banner facility. Her supervisor submitted a letter to their employer to prove the real Jennifer O’Connor was on the clock when the imposter O’Connor was getting medical care.\n“I just know I was working my butt off and I wasn’t getting screws in my legs and on fentanyl, that’s for sure,” she said. “It wasn’t me. None of this was me.”\nStill, the paper trail and the police reports that O’Connor filed with area authorities have not been enough to unravel the mess.\n“I get two emails from Banner saying they’re going to garnish my wages for a visit at Banner Boswell ER for $150, and a $36 bill from Banner Desert,” O’Connor said. “They just sent it to collections.”\nIf it sounds like a nightmare, it is. But O’Connor is not alone.\n“It is getting easier and easier to obtain the data of a legitimate person and then create the fake identity,” Eva Velasquez, the president and CEO of the non-profit Identity Theft Resource Center, said. “When it comes to medical identity theft, it does get tricky because we don’t have a central repository for all of our medical records, so I encourage people to focus their energy on just protecting their identity, on the whole.”\nAccording to the FBI’s Internet Crimes Complaint Center, reports for identity theft are declining, year-over-year, in both the number of complaints and the amount of money lost.\nStill, it remains critical to take preventative steps to protect your identity.\nAgents suggest unique passwords for all accounts, as well as multi-factor authentication.\nThe FBI says it is also important to protect physical documents with personal information. That includes securing your mailbox.\nIf you become a victim of medical identity theft, keep meticulous records.\n“The unfortunate reality is that you must resolve this directly with the entity where the fraud occurred,” Velasquez said. “Call back as often as you feel comfortable doing, asking, ‘What is the status of this? What do you need from me to prove that I am me and did not receive this care, these goods, or this prescription?’ And then, unfortunately, the onus is often on you, the victim, to supply that information, to do your own investigation and build that case.”\nWhile medical identity theft can be costly, it has serious health concerns.\n“You potentially now have mixed medical records with the thief, and you could get improper care and an improper diagnosis,” Velasquez said. “You could also not have the ability to get necessary prescriptions filled or to get access to necessary medical equipment because the thief has already gotten those things in your name.”\nThat’s what the real Jennifer O’Connor fears the most.\n“All her medical stuff is on file. Not mine,” she said. “If I was in a car accident on the way home, God forbid, and I was out of it and needed blood products, I could die because she probably doesn’t have the same blood type as me, and that terrifies me.”\nRepresentatives with HonorHealth and Banner have not immediately responded to questions regarding O’Connor’s case or the companies’ medical identity theft policies.\nThe Mesa Police Department said it has not identified any suspects, and the case is currently inactive.\nPhoenix police and the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office say investigations remain open regarding O’Connor’s situation with evidence still being collected.\nCopyright 2024 KPHO via Gray Media Group, Inc.
