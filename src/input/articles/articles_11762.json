    "title": "EINSA da un salto tecnológico con Inteligencia Artificial y robótica para transformar sus procesos industriales",
    "text": "La española EINSA ha dado un importante salto tecnológico en el uso de la Inteligencia Artificial y la Robótica para transformar sus procesos industriales, tras más de cuarenta años de experiencia en el ámbito de la industria Aeronáutica y de Defensa.\nEn la última década, en el sector del handling civil y militar se han producido cambios importantes, que han modificado las condiciones competitivas sectoriales. La entrada de nuevos competidores de países con poca presencia anterior de fabricantes, la concentración de la producción en unos pocos fabricantes, los problemas recurrentes de aprovisionamiento en la cadena de suministro y el nuevo papel de la tecnología como un factor clave de competitividad, han llevado a numerosos fabricantes a modificar sus modelos de operaciones, para desplegar procesos sistemáticos de desarrollo de nuevos productos y escalar su producción en algunas familias de productos, incluyendo la gestión de almacenes mucho mayores.\nEn este esfuerzo de adaptación a la nueva dinámica sectorial, EINSA ha automatizado sus procesos de desarrollo, producción y mantenimiento, ha incrementado el espacio de almacenamiento y ha incorporado tecnologías digitales en sus operaciones. Sin embargo, un aspecto que no estaba cubierto era el de disponer de procesos industriales inteligentes, que permitieran mejoras en eficiencia, estandarización y calidad, así como ahorros en energía, materias primas y tiempos.\nImagen del chatbox mediante lenguaje natural desarrollado con tecnología LLM para mejora de los procesos de ingeniería y diseño (EINSA)\nEn este contexto se ha planteado la incorporación de IA (Inteligencia Artificial) en algunos de sus procesos de desarrollo y producción. En concreto, entre los meses de noviembre de 2024 y junio de 2025, EINSA ha llevado a cabo el proyecto IAGEN, destinado a incluir algoritmos de IA en dos de los procesos de ingeniería y diseño y en un proceso de producción, mediante la realización de tres subproyectos relacionados entre sí, que desarrollan tecnología LLM (Large Language Model o Modelo de Lenguaje Grande), reconocimiento de imágenes y visión artificial con algoritmos de Deep-Learning.\nA partir de los resultados alcanzados, a un nivel de prototipo TRL-6, será posible mejorar la eficiencia de los procesos afectados de desarrollo y diseño de nuevos equipos, así como mejorar la eficiencia y productividad de fabricación de los mismos. Para poder asumir este reto tecnológico se ha contado con la colaboración del centro tecnológico ITCL (Instituto Tecnológico de Castilla y León), con una gran experiencia en este ámbito.",

    "text": "Carson Beck injury: Major update emerges on elbow, status for College Football Playoff\nCarson Beck is set to miss the College Football Playoff quarterfinals, as On3’s Pete Nakos first reported. The question for the Georgia quarterback is whether he’ll be able to suit up at all in the postseason after suffering an elbow injury, and it sounds like surgery could be on the table.\nESPN’s Pete Thamel, Mark Schlabach and Chris Low reported Beck is “exploring surgery options” after suffering the injury in the SEC Championship. He went to throw up one final prayer before halftime against Texas, but got hit as he threw. Gunner Stockton took over the rest of the way and is expected to get the start in the CFP quarterfinals.\nCLICK HERE to go to PrizePicks and use code ON3 to receive a guaranteed $50 once you play $5 in lineups!\nNakos reported a timetable for Beck’s return is still unclear as he works through his next steps. Despite coming in to deliver the game-sealing handoff to Trevor Etienne, Beck reportedly had trouble gripping the football.\nThis story will be updated.",

    "title": "Ethical AI: Singapore’s Balanced Approach to Adoption",
    "text": "At the recent AI Summit in London, Singapore’s Minister for Digital Development and Information, Josephine Teo, discussed Singapore’s approach to artificial intelligence (AI), offering a roadmap for responsible and balanced AI adoption.\nAs AI technology rapidly advances, Singapore has set a measured course, integrating innovation with essential safeguards to ensure trust and ethical integrity. This cautious, yet forward-looking approach underlines Singapore’s commitment to leveraging AI’s potential while considering its societal and economic impacts.\nMinister Teo emphasised that Singapore prioritises AI as a strategic asset to enhance productivity, precision, and personalisation across multiple sectors. While many countries focus on developing cutting-edge AI models, Singapore’s approach centres on enterprise applications with real-world impact. This distinction aligns with the nation’s National AI Strategy, which recently saw updates to address generative AI.\nThe refreshed strategy includes objectives such as active AI adoption, talent development, and robust safety measures to manage societal risks associated with AI. For Singapore, AI is not simply a technological ambition but a tool to drive economic value and foster resilience across industries.\nAI adoption is central to Singapore’s digital economy, particularly in finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. Banks are integrating AI to enhance digital services, while companies like Singapore Airlines and DBS lead in sector-specific AI applications, using algorithms to optimise operations and improve customer experience. This sector-focused approach supports Singapore’s digital transformation and sets a model for AI in traditional industries.\nSingapore acknowledges the high cost of AI and the need for clear economic returns. The country balances AI research with practical use cases to ensure sustainability. Both public and private sectors focus on projects that deliver tangible benefits, with the government using generative AI to streamline workflows and automate tasks, maximising AI’s value while ensuring resource efficiency.\nHowever, with the increasing integration of AI, Singapore remains aware of the technology’s potential impact on the workforce, particularly in white-collar roles. To address these challenges, Singapore has been proactive in bolstering skills development initiatives that prepare workers for an AI-augmented future.\nLocal and global tech giants contribute to these efforts by offering workforce training and supporting AI literacy programmes. The goal is to create a skilled workforce that is empowered to leverage AI, allowing for career growth and minimising risks of job displacement. Through these initiatives, Singapore aims to build a workforce that is adaptive, resilient, and ready for the demands of an AI-driven economy.\nOn the regulatory front, Singapore’s adaptive framework incorporates tech-agnostic laws that address critical risks, including discrimination and misinformation. Recent legislative updates specifically target election-related deepfakes, illustrating Singapore’s proactive stance on mitigating AI’s risks while supporting its responsible use. This flexible regulatory approach underscores Singapore’s emphasis on fostering a safe and trustworthy AI ecosystem, where innovation can flourish without compromising public interest.\nSingapore collaborates globally on AI safety and ethics, engaging with the U.S. and China in tech dialogues to set shared norms. It also co-leads regional initiatives like the ASEAN AI standards agreement, reinforcing its commitment to AI as a force for the public good.\nThese partnerships reinforce Singapore’s position as a collaborative AI hub, striving to establish ethical standards in AI governance and aligning with broader global efforts to shape a safe AI future.\nSingapore’s strong data centre capacity, combined with sustainable practices and energy-efficient solutions, highlights its responsible infrastructure approach. By collaborating regionally, Singapore aims to build a scalable, green data ecosystem that supports its digital economy while prioritising environmental sustainability.\nMinister Teo’s address highlights Singapore’s balanced AI approach, focusing on enterprise applications, workforce development, and flexible regulations. This strategy enhances economic productivity while safeguarding societal interests, reinforcing Singapore’s global position and setting a model for ethical AI adoption.",

    "text": "The Northern Lights could be visible in Missouri for the second time this week. NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center noted that a CME or Coronal Mass Ejection erupted from the Sun the night of October 8th. Forecasters expected the CME to arrive on Thursday, October 10th, and cause a strong to potentially severe geomagnetic storm . The exact strength of the CME won't be known until it is roughly 1 million miles from Earth when it's measured by the DSCOVR and ACE satellites. What we do know is that a strong geomagnetic storm noted as G3, is capable of producing the Northern Lights as far south as Illinois and Oregon. A severe geomagnetic storm or G4 would allow the aurora to be seen as far south as Alabama and Northern California. Viewing as far south as Alabama would be most likely low on the horizon but further north into Missouri the chances of the aurora being visible overhead is higher. If the forecasted strength of a strong to severe storm continues your best chance of seeing the aurora will be by getting away from city lights as much as possible. Photos of the aurora will be best taken using long exposure mode. To do this on an iPhone you first open the camera app and turn on Live Photo mode. That is done by clicking the icon in the top right corner (vertical photos) or the top left corner (horizontal photos). Next, you want to then take a photo of the night sky. After taking a photo open the photo app and click on your recently taken photo. Once that is open, tap the \"live\" label in the top left corner and select \"long exposure\" from the options. After turning on \"long exposure\" mode your camera will display a yellow timer in the top left corner of your camera screen. On an Android phone, you will want to open the camera app and click the more option in the top right corner or bottom of the screen. Once that menu is open select the \"pro\" option and then where it says \"speed\" you want to select that. After opening the \"speed\" menu you want to then scroll the yellow bar to a number longer than 1/30th, look for whole numbers and not fractions. When taking a long exposure photo it is best to use a tripod as you want to limit the movement of your phone as much as possible.",

    "title": "Lightmatter Announces Passage L200, Co-Packaged Optics for AI - High-Performance Computing News Analysis | insideHPC",
    "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.– Photonic supercomputing company Lightmatter announced Passage L200, which the company said is the ﬁrst 3D co-packaged optics (CPO) product.\nDesigned to integrate with the latest XPU and switch silicon designs, Passage L200 supports unprecedented AI performance scaling by eliminating interconnect bandwidth bottlenecks, the company said. The L200 3D CPO family includes both 32 Tbps and 64 Tbps versions, representing a 5 to 10x improvement over existing solutions. This enables over 200 Tbps of total I/O bandwidth per chip package, resulting in up to 8X faster training time for advanced AI models.\nBandwidth scaling has signiﬁcantly trailed gains in compute performance. Continued advances in AI compute require fundamental changes in interconnect technology. Current connectivity solutions, including electrical, optical and conventional CPO, are bandwidth limited because their I/O interfaces are restricted to the “shoreline,” or edge of the chip. Passage L200 overcomes these constraints with the world’s ﬁrst edgeless I/O, scaling bandwidth across the entire die area. This modular 3D CPO solution leverages a standard interoperable UCIe die-to-die (D2D) interface, and facilitates scalable chiplet-based architectures to seamlessly integrate with next generation XPUs and switches.\nThe Passage L200 3D CPO integrates the latest of Alphawave Semi’s chiplet technology portfolio, combining silicon-proven low power and low latency UCIe and optics-ready SerDes with Lightmatter’s category-deﬁning photonic integrated circuit (PIC). Alphawave Semi’s advanced-node electrical integrated circuit (EIC) is 3D integrated on the Passage PIC using standard chip-on-wafer (CoW) techniques. Passage 3D integration enables SerDes I/O to be positioned anywhere on the die, rather than being conﬁned to its shoreline, delivering the equivalent bandwidth of 40 pluggable optical transceivers per L200. Additionally, multiple L200s can be integrated in a package to serve a broad range of XPU and switch applications.\n“Bandwidth scaling has become the critical impediment to AI advancement,” said Nick Harris, founder and CEO of Lightmatter. “The engineering breakthroughs represented by our L200 family of 3D CPO solutions provide the fundamental building blocks that will pave the way for next-gen AI processors and switches.”\n“We are thrilled to collaborate with Lightmatter on the delivery of the L200,” said Tony Pialis, president and Chief Executive Oﬃcer of Alphawave Semi. “Our extensive portfolio, featuring proven chiplets, optical DSPs, and connectivity silicon subsystems, synergizes with Lightmatter’s 3D photonics to create a dynamic solution that propels the next generation of AI infrastructure forward.”\n“AI data center interconnects face growing bandwidth and power challenges,” said Andrew Schmitt, founder and directing analyst at Cignal AI. “Co-Packaged Optics (CPO) – integrating optics directly onto XPUs and switches – is the inevitable solution. Lightmatter’s bold approach delivers the essential elements of CPO and gives hyperscalers and chip manufacturers a path to deliver high-performance systems.”\nThe L200 is engineered for high-volume manufacturing with industry leading silicon photonics fab and OSAT partners including Global Foundries, ASE, and Amkor as well as advanced node CMOS foundries. Built with advanced redundancy and resiliency, the L200 is powered by Lightmatter’s Guide light engine, delivering exceptional laser integration and total optical power per module to support the full bandwidth of L200.\nLightmatter oﬀers two product SKUs: the L200 (32Tbps) and L200X (64Tbps) 3D CPO engines. These solutions build upon the company’s proven Passage technology platform, oﬀering 16 WDM wavelengths per waveguide/ﬁber with the most advanced and fully integrated photonics control capabilities.\nFeatures of the L200 and L200X include:\nAdvanced node CMOS EIC 32Gbps UCIe D2D interface (IP oﬀered royalty-free by Alphawave Semi for accompanying XPU/Switch die) 320 Optically-optimized multi-rate/multi-protocol SerDes Passage PIC L200: 56 Gbps NRZ, 32 Tbps total (Tx+Rx) L200X: 106/112 Gbps PAM4, 64 Tbps total (Tx+Rx) 16 wavelength WDM per waveguide/ﬁber for 800Gbps/1.6Tbps per ﬁber Pluggable ﬁber connectors for lasers and data Available in 2026, Lightmatter ’s L200 and L200X 3D CPO chips are designed to accelerate time to market and performance of next generation XPUs and switches for the next wave of foundation AI models.",

To make sure it lands straight in your inbox and to be among the first to receive it, subscribe now by clicking [here](https://foodtank.com/sign-up/?swcfpc=1). It is obvious to most of us that food is a human right. But our discussions of food justice need to be grounded—literally—in what experts are calling a right to healthy soils. Without well-nourished soil, “the global issues of climate change and food security cannot be addressed,” says soil scientist Dr. Rattan Lal. He’s the recipient of the World Food Prize and a Distinguished University Professor of Soil Science at The Ohio State University. I had the opportunity to chat with Dr. Lal recently at a U.N. human rights conference on food justice in Doha, Qatar. World leaders had some crucial discussions at that summit—and, as always, I personally learned so much from Dr. Lal. “The right to food and right to soil are inextricably linked,” Dr. Lal says. If we want good food, we need good soil. Ninety-five percent of food nutrients come from soils, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization calculates—which makes the problem of soil erosion so much more concerning. As Adrian Lipscombe, a chef and the Founder of the 40 Acres Project, put it: “If we don’t have soil health, we’re not going to have food.” Soil erosion specifically refers to the removal of topsoil from the land’s surface, which can be caused by factors like water, wind, and tillage. Of course, some of these processes are natural—but healthy soils have the resiliency to resist excess erosion, whereas degraded soils are more vulnerable to even natural climatic cycles. About a third of the world’s soils are currently degraded, the [FAO says](https://foodtank710.lt.emlnk3.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuZmFvLm9yZyUyRjMlMkZjYjc2NTRlbiUyRmNiNzY1NGVuLnBkZg==&sig=CTfjpYZ9tYvgAVoPrprEjDQ7KSENS7D8aWSKTBZ6acPN&iat=1708028538&a=%7C%7C475195397%7C%7C&account=foodtank710%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&email=ew8uSUGznKsj4M4G8IYkuodDxgjkmbLKNcltmmibdA%2B5cQ%3D%3D%3A4Wi4xavHIAJd2tOh5Z4qkocGx2pjlnVL&s=61ce9a9c055e2b7f4bec52ccfbeda392&i=751A3232A1A62387), and poor land management practices and hyper-industrialized agriculture is pushing that number higher. And that has direct impacts on our food supply and climate. Poor soils can cut crop yields by up to 50 percent—which, if we’re not careful, could result in more soil being tilled to grow more crops, which degrades more soil, which pushes us closer to climate catastrophe. And while poor soils hurt the environment, good soils can help repair the earth. Healthy soils, [boosted by regenerative farming practices](https://foodtank710.lt.emlnk3.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cubnJjcy51c2RhLmdvdiUyRmNvbnNlcnZhdGlvbi1iYXNpY3MlMkZuYXR1cmFsLXJlc291cmNlLWNvbmNlcm5zJTJGc29pbHMlMkZzb2lsLWhlYWx0aCUyMyUzQSU3RSUzQXRleHQlM0RCeSUyNTIwZmFybWluZyUyNTIwdXNpbmclMjUyMHNvaWwlMjUyMGhlYWx0aCUyQ21hdHRlciUyNTIwYW5kJTI1MjBpbXByb3ZpbmclMjUyMG1pY3JvYmlhbCUyNTIwYWN0aXZpdHku&sig=543F8MSYFnvKK6ueytbXJi9RgCN4dvjmWGB6zJkacAfi&iat=1708028538&a=%7C%7C475195397%7C%7C&account=foodtank710%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&email=ew8uSUGznKsj4M4G8IYkuodDxgjkmbLKNcltmmibdA%2B5cQ%3D%3D%3A4Wi4xavHIAJd2tOh5Z4qkocGx2pjlnVL&s=61ce9a9c055e2b7f4bec52ccfbeda392&i=751A3232A1A62388), can sequester more carbon from the atmosphere and more effectively store and drain water. Farmers can use techniques like no-till growing, cover cropping, rotational grazing and planting, and implementing other buffers against erosion. “We need the soil for our physical sustenance,” says the amazing Leah Penniman of Soul Fire Farm, “but I also very much believe we need the soil for our psycho-spiritual wellness.” Luckily, plenty of powerful, inspiring organizations around the world are pushing us in the right direction. Food and Land Use Coalition is building an evidence base to help producers and investors scale up solutions. 1000 Landscapes for 1 Billion People is bringing together individual advocates into a powerful voice for regenerative landscapes, broader than farms alone. Better Soils, Better Lives is helping heal soils among smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa with green manure and cover cropping, and the [Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils](https://foodtank710.lt.emlnk3.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZmb29kdGFuay5jb20lMkZuZXdzJTJGMjAyNCUyRjAxJTJGdmFjcy1pcy1nb2luZy1iYWNrLXRvLWJhc2ljcy1mb3ItYS1jbGltYXRlLXJlc2lsaWVudC1mdXR1cmUlMkY=&sig=BWUbnVmCgmZsoU7Pch1DCYjTnfcwGxTLCjmANxfwSGoG&iat=1708028538&a=%7C%7C475195397%7C%7C&account=foodtank710%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&email=ew8uSUGznKsj4M4G8IYkuodDxgjkmbLKNcltmmibdA%2B5cQ%3D%3D%3A4Wi4xavHIAJd2tOh5Z4qkocGx2pjlnVL&s=61ce9a9c055e2b7f4bec52ccfbeda392&i=751A3232A1A62373) is working across the African continent to build nutritious food production through soil health. We’re seeing the power of storytelling, too. The film “ [Common Ground](https://foodtank710.lt.emlnk3.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZmb29kdGFuay5jb20lMkZuZXdzJTJGMjAyNCUyRjAxJTJGc29sdXRpb25zLW9uLXNjcmVlbiUyRg==&sig=7DcdH9uw5rGjEn2jVZQ4RpCTC725GvgdDEbqgJdkKuWa&iat=1708028538&a=%7C%7C475195397%7C%7C&account=foodtank710%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&email=ew8uSUGznKsj4M4G8IYkuodDxgjkmbLKNcltmmibdA%2B5cQ%3D%3D%3A4Wi4xavHIAJd2tOh5Z4qkocGx2pjlnVL&s=61ce9a9c055e2b7f4bec52ccfbeda392&i=751A3232A1A62396)” does a great job documenting farmers who are using regenerative agriculture to heal the planet and protect our health—in economically beneficial ways. The organization behind the film, Kiss the Ground, has launched a campaign to help 100,000 more farmers transition 100 million more acres of U.S. farmland toward regenerative practices by the end of the decade. And they’re pushing innovation. Because most grains need to be replanted every season, it’s hard for even regenerative farmers to minimize the disturbance to their land and build biodiversity, says Tim Crews, Chief Scientist & Director of the International Initiative at The Land Institute. So they’re working to highlight how perennial grains can help rebuild soils. “Developing new perennial grains that persist year over year opens up unprecedented opportunities for farmers to greatly improve soil health as a natural outcome of agriculture,” he tells Food Tank. But they can’t do it alone. We need policymakers, investors, business leaders, chefs, and researchers to take serious steps toward making soil health a fundamental part of our institutional approach to food and agriculture. Take the Soil Health Act, for example: It’s a proposed piece of legislation Dr. Rattan Lal is advocating, to complement the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. Let’s put this in the next Farm Bill! Just last month, several members of the U.S. House of Representatives introduced the Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act, which would boost the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s ability to support farmers and land caretakers in adopting more regenerative methods. And I’m pleased that the Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022, committed a historic US$20 million toward rebuilding healthy soils, improving water quality, and conserving the land. “You don’t have to own a farm or a ranch to make meaningful change,” says rancher Gabe Brown, of Brown’s Ranch in North Dakota. “It starts with each and every one of us. It can start in your local community with community gardens using regenerative practices. You can insist that your schools source and serve regeneratively grown food.” He’s absolutely right. I’m going to be blunt: If we’re not prioritizing soil health in our conversations about food justice and the human right to nutritious food, we’re falling short. There’s so much that each of us can do to build a stronger foundation underneath our feet. Articles like the one you just read are made possible through the generosity of Food Tank members.

    "title": "All-Love Racquet Club Hosts 'The Cookout' in LA, Celebrating Black Tennis Community",
    "text": "For their first Los Angeles event, the All-Love Racquet Club celebrated the African American tennis community on Sunday, February 25, at the Michelle and Barack Obama Sports Complex in celebration of Black History Month. Founder Erika Bond coordinated \"The Cookout\" as an ode to Black resilience and determination in the world of tennis. Sponsored by Black-owned tennis company FURI Sport, the event is inspired by the rich legacy of the Rancho Cienega tennis community, aims to foster inclusivity, and diversity in racquet sports.\nThe Importance of Representation in Tennis\nAll-Love Racquet Club is a collective community and lifestyle brand dedicated to embracing equitable access to sports like tennis, padel, and pickleball. The club is committed to championing more comprehensive representation and ensuring that every player or fan, regardless of background, finds a welcoming and authentic space to build community and culture. Through events like \"The Cookout,\" All-Love Racquet Club hopes to spark conversations and inspire change within the tennis community, advocating for a future where access to the sport is not a luxury but available for all.\nCommunity Engagement and Activities\nUnder the visionary leadership of Bond, \"The Cookout\" is the third event produced by All-Love and marks a significant milestone in L.A. The tournament and clinical style celebration featured over eight teams, over twenty-five players, and a court-full of beginners, competing and learning the highly athletic sport. All-Love partnered with Fortune Tennis, a tennis program ran by Emmanuel Fortune, to a host a day filled with comradery and Black joy with food, prizes, games, and good tennis. Prizes and giveaways were provided by FURI Sport and local tennis fashion brand Ace the Moon. Food from Chef Stephen Metoyear and dessert from Westchester Bakery stayed true to the cookout theme with their offerings. More sweets and mocktails were provided by The Dessert Bar, along with other local Black-owned vendors like, the Protagonist Black mobile bookstore, Brownhaze Jewelry, art from BreAnn Renae, on the spot massages from The Experience Pop-up Spa, and the American Tennis Association (ATA).\nA Bright Future for Inclusivity in Sports\nAs an Atlanta native traveling and eventually settling in the West, Bond has taken it upon herself to challenge the status quo and create a space where everyone can participate and excel in racquet sports. The Prairie View A&M University Alumni and D1 athlete's dedication to diversity and inclusivity is commendable, has reshaped the tennis landscape, and developed a strong, supportive community. \"I am determined to change the narrative and perception of tennis to make the sport more inclusive,\" said Bond. \"The vision behind All-Love was born from my personal journey as a person of color in the world of tennis, both as a player and coach. In many cases, sports and community naturally intertwine, but when you engage in a sport that wasn't originally designed with you in mind, it can be an isolating experience. Through All-Love, my aim is to transform that narrative and create a welcoming space for anyone interested in racquet sports.\"\nBond is taking the club East to New York for their next event. Her goal is to continue to host every three months to garnish consistency in the community. For more information about All-Love Racquet Club and how to become a member, visit www.all-loveclub.com.",
