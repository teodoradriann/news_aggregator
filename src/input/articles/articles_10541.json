    "text": "On Thursday’s “CNN News Central,” Chicago Alderman Brian Hopkins said that the city simply can’t handle any more migrants, and as a result of the migrant influx in the city, “We’re seeing crime go up, property values go down” and “We’re seeing communities destabilized.” Hopkins further stated, “I’m a Democrat, but I’ll say the Biden administration has absolutely dropped the ball,” and “every day that goes by while we let the border remain open and while we let cities try to address this humanitarian crisis, it gets worse by the day.”\nHopkins said, “We’re seeing communities destabilized. We’re seeing an influx of new residents who simply don’t have a place to reside. The impact of the local shelters is having a detrimental effect on the quality of life for local residents. We’re seeing crime go up, property values go down. It’s creating a political crisis, as well as stress between communities. … We desperately need decompression in Chicago. We’ve got 30,000 migrants. We simply can’t handle any more. We’re not equipped for it.”\nHe added that a decompression strategy would include some migrants getting work permits and help providing permanent housing for migrants.\nHopkins concluded, “I’m a Democrat, but I’ll say the Biden administration has absolutely dropped the ball, I’m not going to let them off the hook. They have left us in the ditch with this, and that’s unacceptable. What I’m hearing now is encouraging, we needed to hear this a year ago when this crisis first started in Chicago, we had a trickle that led to a torrent, and now we’re spending 300 million of our own funds, that’s about 5% of our federal municipal budget to address a problem that didn’t even exist a year a half ago, where’s the federal government been? Where has the Biden administration been? It’s not too late to do the right thing, but every day that goes by while we let the border remain open and while we let cities try to address this humanitarian crisis, it gets worse by the day. And I’ve lost patience, as you can probably tell.”\nHopkins’s remarks come after New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D), Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) and Denver Mayor Mike Johnston (D) held a virtual press conference in which they urged the Biden administration to increase federal support to handle the migrant influx.\nJohnson has said the influx into Chicago is “not sustainable” without “significant federal support.”\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\nClips Immigration Politics border Chicago Crime Joe Biden Migrants",

O regime de Maduro obviamente acolhe com entusiasmo sua sentença, que estará marcada pela infâmia\", assegurou Boric em postagem na rede X, na qual acrescentou que o \"Chile não reconhece este falso triunfo autoproclamado de Maduro e companhia\".\nO Tribunal Supremo de Justiça (TSJ) certificou o resultado das eleições de 28 de julho, nas quais o Conselho Nacional Eleitoral (CNE) proclamou Nicolás Maduro vencedor com 52% dos votos, uma decisão que não cabe recurso.\nA oposição, que tachou de \"nula\" essa decisão, garante ter vencido o pleito e acusa tanto o TSJ como o CNE de servirem aos interesses do chavismo.\nO presidente chileno foi um dos primeiros governantes a colocar em dúvida a transparência das eleições presidenciais na Venezuela.\n\"Não há dúvida de que estamos diante de uma ditadura que falsifica eleições, reprime quem pensa diferente e é indiferente ao maior êxodo do mundo, comparável apenas ao da Síria, resultado de uma guerra\", acrescentou Boric, um dos presidentes de esquerda mais críticos de Maduro.\nApenas no Chile há cerca de 530 mil venezuelanos, parte dos quase 8 milhões que fugiram da crise em seu país.\nPor sua vez, o chanceler venezuelano Yván Gil reagiu com ataques a Boric. \"Uma peça comprada pelos Estados Unidos, covarde e arrastada\". \"Boric passa de motivo de chacota de um continente a peão mais submisso do imperialismo norte-americano\", escreveu o ministro em seu canal no aplicativo Telegram. \"Quanta falta faz no Chile um Salvador Allende!\", acrescentou.\n\"O adjetivo quando não dá vida, mata\", escreveu Boric em sua publicação, citando o poeta chileno Vicente Huidobro, \"e eles assassinaram a palavra democracia\".\n\"A ditadura da Venezuela não representa a esquerda\", acrescentou. \"É possível e necessária uma esquerda continental profundamente democrática e que respeite os direitos humanos\".\nApós o anúncio dos resultados em 29 de julho, protestos eclodiram na Venezuela com saldo de 27 mortos, quase 200 feridos e mais de 2.400 detidos, que são tachados de \"terroristas\" por Maduro.\naxl-jt/pa/mvv/am/rpr\n© Agence France-Presse",

    "title": "Applied Materials Forecast Spurs Concern About Chip Spending",
    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Applied Materials Inc., the largest US maker of chip-manufacturing equipment, gave a disappointing revenue forecast, signaling that some semiconductor customers may be holding off on orders. Fiscal first-quarter sales will be about $7.15 billion, the company said in a statement Thursday. That compares with a $7.25 billion average of analysts’ estimates. Massive spending on artificial intelligence computing has fueled demand for the most advanced chips — and, in turn, the machines needed to produce them. But other sectors of the industry are slowing down. Some makers of chips for industrial equipment and vehicles, for instance, have reported sluggish demand. Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company fell about 3% in extended trading following the announcement. They earlier closed at $186 in New York, leaving them up 15% in 2024. Applied Materials’ main customers are some of the biggest companies in the chip industry, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics Co. and Intel Corp. Those manufacturers order gear well ahead of starting production, making Applied Materials’ forecasts a barometer for future demand. The company’s profit outlook was stronger. Excluding some items, earnings will be roughly $2.29 a share in first quarter, which runs through January. The average projection was $2.28 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Fourth-quarter results also exceeded estimates. Profit was $2.32 a share, excluding some items, with revenue rising 4.8% to $7.05 billion. Analysts estimated $2.19 a share in earnings and $6.97 billion in sales. Despite tightening trade restrictions, Applied Materials saw its sales surge in China during recent quarters. Chipmakers in that country use its machines to produce less sophisticated chips — ones that aren’t subject to the trade curbs. That business has been booming as China tries to build up its semiconductor economy, but spending has begun to slow. China sales accounted for 30% of Applied Materials’ revenue last quarter, down from 44% a year earlier. Applied Materials also has seen tepid demand for its ICAPS business — chip equipment for components going into internet-connected appliances, communications, autos, power control and sensors. Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said he remains confident that AI and new types of chips will keep the industry growing. “Applied has leadership in all the advanced segments,” he said in an interview. “AI is the big driver for the entire industry.” (Updates with more from results starting in seventh paragraph.) ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "title": "Mourinho’s Roma have Juventus in their sights - Gulf Times",
    "text": "Jose Mourinho will hope his “bunch of smashing lads” from AS Roma build on their impressive 2-0 win over defending Serie A champions Napoli last weekend and dent Juventus’s title-chasing ambitions today. Juventus could be seven points adrift of leaders Inter Milan today if Simone Inzaghi’s side beat Genoa for their sixth successive victory. A win for Roma would keep them firmly in the hunt for a Champions League place next season, they are presently sixth just three points off fourth-placed Bologna. Bologna, though, will be favoured to beat relegation-threatened Udinese earlier today. Mourinho refuses to make any comment on whether he has been set a target for this campaign – any ambitions he believes have to be taken into the context that the club is under Financial Fair Play restrictions. “I prefer to take things one at a time for one very simple reason and this is not to blame anyone; it’s not a criticism but we have a group of players with complicated injury histories,” said Mourinho. “If we had everyone available for every game I’d have no problems coming out and saying that we can fight with everyone – not for the title but for the top four. Unfortunately we do have these difficulties and on top of that we have Financial Fair Play restrictions, which isn’t an easy situation to manage. That’s why I prefer not to set any specific targets.” Mourinho said, though, that despite all the problems the team’s great strength was the bond between the players. “We’re united,” said the 60-year-old Portuguese coach. “We have a bunch of smashing lads who always try to turn weaknesses into strengths and to help each other. We’ll see. We can’t do what we wanted to do in the January transfer window. What we want to do is one thing and what we can do is another. But we’ll push on.” Juventus received a boost this week when Brazilian defender Gleison Bremer extended his contract to 2028. The 26-year-old said he had grown as a player this term and was much more at ease in Italy. “This year things are going much better,” he told the club’s website. “I have found greater serenity and I have learned from the mistakes made in my early days, which were normal. Now I feel really comfortable and I have much more awareness of my strength and qualities.” His new found confidence will undergo a stern test against a Roma front line including Belgium star Romelu Lukaku. “It will be a complicated match against Roma and I know well that it won’t be easy to compete against Romelu Lukaku,” he said. “It will be a difficult challenge and I will have to show continuation on my growth path. An attacker like this is faced in various ways, based on the position on the pitch in which you find yourself facing him.” Bremer said though he and his teammates are “a confident group” Inter will prove a formidable obstacle to dislodge at the top of the table. “We know well that we haven’t won anything yet: we are aware of Inter’s strength and our task is to stay up there.” Today’s Fixtures (kick-off times GMT)Atalanta v Lecce (1130), Udinese v Bologna, Cagliari v Empoli (1400), AC Milan v Sassuolo, Verona v Salernitana (both 1700), Juventus v AS Roma (1945) [Sports](/sports) Mourinho’s Roma have Juventus in their sights ‘We have smashing lads who turn weaknesses into strengths’ Roma’s players train on Friday, on the eve of their Serie A clash against Juventus.",

Noticia Relacionada estandar No El meteorólogo de la Aemet que avisó de la Dana, rotundo tras la tragedia que ha provocado: «Hay algo detrás...» María Carbajo JJ González Alemán es Doctor en Física y experto de la Agencia Estatal en ciclones, tormentas y cambio climático, entre otros. Fue el primero en alertar de que las precipitaciones iban a estar por encima de la mediaEl célebre meteorológico Mario Picazo advierte a la población sobre los efectos persistentes de la DANA a lo largo del fin de semana. La previsión de Mario PicazoAunque se prevé que esta fenómeno meteorológico empiece a «perder fuelle», Picazo recalca que « aún vamos a registrar precipitaciones durante el fin de semana que localmente pueden llegar a ser intensas».En este puente de Todos los Santos, se espera que algunas áreas de España experimenten lluvias intensas. «La última hora de la evolución de la DANA indica que el tiempo este fin de semana… estará marcado aún por lluvia que todavía podrían ser intensas», advierte Picazo. Según el meteorólogo, las zonas más afectadas serán «Castellón y el sur de Cataluña, así como el oeste de Andalucía y lo que llega de hoy al domingo a Mallorca y Menorca».La intensidad de las precipitaciones será notable especialmente en la costa sur de Cataluña y en las islas Baleares, donde Mallorca y Menorca recibirán «las precipitaciones más intensas en estas próximas 24 horas» , con avisos rojos y naranjas activados en las zonas más vulnerables. Varias zonas inestables a lo largo del fin de semanaEste riesgo ha sido especialmente palpable en el norte de la Comunidad Valenciana, donde ya se han registrado fuertes lluvias, y se espera que en las Baleares «las más intensas se quedan entre Mallorca y Menorca aunque parece que podrían ser más intensas y de carácter tormentoso en el norte de Mallorca».Hacia el final del fin de semana, las condiciones meteorológicas tienden a estabilizarse, pero se mantendrán áreas de inestabilidad «en zonas del Mediterráneo entre Baleares, Cataluña y el norte de la Comunidad Valenciana» . Picazo subraya que «no hay que bajar la guardia» ya que la combinación de fuertes lluvias y orografía complicada podría llevar a acumulaciones de agua en poco tiempo.En cuanto a las temperaturas, serán suaves en gran parte del país, alcanzando «valores que rondarán los 20 grados» en varias capitales, con máximas de hasta 25 grados en Baleares y Canarias durante el día. En contraste, se espera que «las temperaturas más frescas las vamos a ver en la meseta norte y en algunas zonas del oeste peninsular».La advertencia de Mario Picazo resalta la importancia de estar atentos a las alertas meteorológicas locales, especialmente para aquellos que planeen desplazarse durante este puente y tras la catástrofe que ha azotado al levante español y mantiene en vilo a toda España.",

    "text": "News | Local | Health Health PeaceHealth emergency room overwhelmed this week Respiratory illnesses straining services, some elective procedures canceled Feb. 20, 2025 3:54 p.m. PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center in Bellingham, shown in December 2024. ( Finn Wendt /Cascadia Daily News) By Isaac Stone Simonelli Enterprise/Investigations Reporter\nPeaceHealth’s emergency department in Bellingham was overwhelmed by patients this week, forcing hours-long waits and the hospital to cancel some elective procedures.\nClose to 50 patients were waiting in the emergency room lobby on Tuesday, Feb. 18, with some patients waiting up to eight hours in the lobby before being seen and treated in the emergency department, according to a PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center employee.\nIt “was a record for total number of patients in the department and total in the lobby waiting,” stated an internal hospital message sent on Wednesday.\nAt one point, there were more than 100 patients either in the emergency department lobby or being treated, according to the source, an emergency department employee who was granted confidentiality by Cascadia Daily News due to fear of retaliation.\n“We had a patient in their 90s wait seven hours,” the employee said. “We had patients with chest pain waiting for hours to be seen, and patients in a crowded environment positive with the flu. It wasn’t a good situation at all.”\nPeaceHealth was not immediately able to verify numbers provided to CDN, but did confirm that the hospital was “routinely seeing much higher daily” emergency department numbers than usual in February.\nThe facility reported “unprecedented patient volumes” in the department due to rising cases of RSV, flu and other emergent health needs, according to a Feb. 19 news release.\nThe hospital urged those with non-emergency health issues to seek medical care elsewhere. These options include primary care providers, urgent care clinics and PeaceHealth’s priority care clinics, which offer same-day, drop-in care.\n“Please know that we treat everyone who visits our Emergency Department, but those with non-emergency needs will most likely have a longer wait time before we are able to care for them,” said Dr. James Scribner, medical director at PeaceHealth St. Joseph’s Emergency Department.\nSome elective procedures at the hospital were canceled Wednesday morning. A voicemail left with a patient and shared with CDN stated that “the hospital is full to capacity.”\nThe patient, Rebecca Youlin, was told to contact her surgeon’s office to reschedule a biopsy procedure she started planning in November.\nYoulin was able to reschedule for early March. But, she noted that if the biopsy eventually revealed any concerns, such as cancerous cells, she would be two weeks farther behind fighting it.\nWhile scheduled to be a patient on Wednesday, Youlin is also an ICU nurse at PeaceHealth.\n“This whole week has been insane,” she said, noting that she was concerned that the hospital was at capacity.\n“[Being at capacity] basically means that if you are sick enough to need a bed in the hospital, you may end up being boarded in the ER until a bed becomes available,” said Youlin, who has been a registered nurse for 15 years. “Believe me, when you are sick enough to be admitted, the ER is the least conducive environment to healing!”\nThe confidential source at PeaceHealth told CDN that it has become common for part of the hospital’s emergency department to be partially filled with these “boarders” — patients who have been admitted but are awaiting a bed on a different floor.\nWhile Youlin recognized that the nation is facing a particularly bad flu season , she said the community has outgrown the medical facility. This is, in some ways, illustrated by how often a “code white” is declared at the hospital.\nA code white from the emergency room is essentially letting staff know they need to get all the patients that have admission orders to their rooms to make space for new patients, Youlin explained.\nThese code whites are being called on a daily basis, she added.\nEveryone is “inundated and slammed,” Youlin said.\nPeaceHealth did not respond to a question about the number of code whites called at the facility so far this year.\n “We are asking the community to consider other care options for non-emergency healthcare needs so our team can care for the most ill and vulnerable,” Dr. Scribner stated.\nDr. Scribner encouraged anyone with difficulty breathing to come to the ER for an evaluation. He added that for other flu or respiratory virus symptoms, like body aches and coughing, self-care or a visit to a primary care physician or same-day clinic may be a more suitable option.\nIsaac Stone Simonelli is CDN’s enterprise/investigations reporter; reach him at isaacsimonelli@cascadiadaily.com ; 360-922-3090 ext. 127.",
