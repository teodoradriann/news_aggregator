    "text": "CENTURION: India’s dream of winning a Test series in South Africa for the first time was ended inside three days as they crashed to an innings and 32 runs defeat at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Thursday.\nWith the series consisting of only two matches they can at best earn a share of the honors if they win the second Test starting in Cape Town on Wednesday.\nIndia crashed to 131 all out in their second innings after conceding a 163-run first innings lead.\nA day which started with the match evenly poised turned into a rout for the tourists.\nDean Elgar (185) and Marco Jansen (84 not out) transformed a slender 11-run lead for South Africa at the start of play into a strong position.\nThey shared a 111-run sixth wicket partnership as South Africa took an overnight 256 for five to 408 all out despite the absent of injured captain Temba Bavuma.\nVirat Kohli hit an aggressive 76 for India before he was last man out but the rest of the batting collapsed against South Africa’s fast bowlers on a lively pitch.\nThe second innings lasted just 34.1 overs. Kohli hit 12 fours and a six in an 82-ball innings. Shubman Gill made 26 but no other batsman scored more than six.\nKagiso Rabada set the tone for South Africa, bowling Sharma for a duck with a superb delivery which deviated off the pitch to hit the off stump.\nRabada, who took five for 59 in the first innings, took two for 32 and finished the match with an outstanding diving catch at long-on to dismiss Kohli off Jansen, who took three for 36.\nLeft-arm fast bowler Nandre Burger completed an impressive debut Test by taking four for 33, giving hm match figures of seven for 83.\nThree catches went down in the slip cordon but none proved expensive.\nElgar was named man of the match in his final Test on his home ground. He has announced he will retire from international cricket after the second Test.\n“It was pretty special for me,” he said.\n“It (the pitch) was pretty juicy. You’ve got to keep it nice and simple batting in Tests. Focus on the ball, play straight and play late.”\nIt was a policy which India were unable to follow, although Sharma paid tribute to KL Rahul for his “brilliant” century in the first innings.\nBavuma took no further part in the match after injuring his left hamstring on the first morning. A statement from Cricket South Africa said it had been decided he would not bat because of concern about him aggravating the injury.\nThere was no indication whether Bavuma would be fit for the second Test.\nElgar captained the team on the field after Bavuma’s injury and, having captained South Africa in 17 Tests, he would be favorite to take over the leadership in his final Test if Bavuma is not fit.\nIndia’s series dream ends in three-day defeat by South Africa\nhttps://arab.news/j2e2w\nIndia’s series dream ends in three-day defeat by South Africa\n- South Africa thrash India by an innings and 32 runs in first Test on Thursday\n- India crashed to 131 all out in second innings after conceding a 163-run lead\nCENTURION: India’s dream of winning a Test series in South Africa for the first time was ended inside three days as they crashed to an innings and 32 runs defeat at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Thursday.",

    "text": "ROSIE ON THE HOUSE\nHow Arizonan homeowners can harness the sun’s power Jul 18, 2024, 3:00 PM\nWhy not take advantage of Arizona's famously strong sunshine? (Pexels file photo)\n(Pexels file photo)\nShare\nBY ROSIE ROMERO, HOST AND OWNER OF ROSIEONTHEHOUSE.COM\nKTAR.com\nWhen we mention solar, most people immediately think of “energy source.” While true, we use the sun’s power in many different ways.\nBefore we get started, it might be a good idea to refresh our knowledge about how the seasons affect how we use the sun.\nSince Galileo, we know that earth orbits the sun. We also know the earth’s rotational axis is on an angle of 23.5 degrees. That angle means that as the earth orbits the sun, the northern and southern hemispheres are either tilting toward the sun or away from it. This tilt, as it moves between its extreme points in the orbit, determines the seasons, and the angle that sunlight comes through our windows. When winter in Arizona arrives, the sun is lower in the sky and falls more deeply inside our home. In the summertime, the sun is higher as the earth’s northern hemisphere leans into the sun, cutting off the light entering our homes.\nThis is why many of our homes have eaves or overhangs. The deeper the overhang, the more sunlight stays out of our window in the summer months. There are many ways we can control the sun’s ability to assist us. From overhangs, to landscaping there are tools to help us best use the sun.\nMuch of the sun’s power comes from its light Since the first buildings, we have had these devices we call windows . The primary function of these inventions is to let in light from the sun and air. Windows have improved exponentially over the past five thousand or so years, but they help us light our homes, at least during the daytime. We can choose the locations of our windows based on how we want a room to be lit at different times of the year. By planting deciduous trees, the right distance from our home, we can get the best of both worlds. Leaves for shade in summer, no leaves for sunlight to reach us in the winter.\nHow to take advantage of shade We can passively control how we use the sun. Shade structures allow us to block out the direct rays of the sun.\nLet’s look at some uses of shade.\nShaded areas still benefit from indirect light of the sun without the direct glare of sunlight. The eaves on our homes help us benefit from appropriate seasonal use of sunlight. We all know the sun is higher in the sky during the summer months and lower in the winter. The depth of the eave will dictate when the direct sunlight hits our outside walls and enters through our windows and doors. Shade structures over our outdoor areas are very popular in Arizona and afford us the ability to be outside without the often harsh Arizona sun. Window shades are another simple tool we use to control the direct rays of the in our homes. The “Rosie Right” way to do this is to cover the entire window frame as well as the glass area. Window frames can be as heat conductive, or even more so, than the glass surface. The screen should be installed with an air gap between it and the window. You never want any part of the screen fabric or its frame to be in contact with the window glass surface or its frame. See our take on trees above. Those are some of the low-tech or passive ways we use the sun.\nOur pets are skilled at taking advantage of the sun. A cat lying on a window ledge drinking up the sunlight or a dog finding a special patch on the floor will change positions as the sun moves and the patch relocates.\nWho among us recall the solar clothes dryers our Mom’s used to use? That actually is a question we would love to get your answer to. Email us at info@rosieonthehouse.com !\nTechnology to the rescue Technology allows us to utilize the sun in many new ways. The early years of solar collection just allowed us to get hot water for indoor use and transfer heat for warming our homes. The roof-mounted collectors were a bit clunky and prone to leaks. The piping has been greatly improved and thus, a better heat transfer.\nBy and large, heating a liquid with sunlight and transferring that heat has given way to photovoltaics. That is harnessing the sun’s light to produce electricity. Perhaps today this is the most common application of solar technology .\nWe have come a long way from ancient methods of manipulating direct sunlight to using rooftop photovoltaic panels and a sophisticated battery storage system in our garage to harness the power of the sun. However, we shouldn’t forget about simpler solar technologies that led us to where we are today.\nShare Comments",

    "text": "Una tragedia familiar golpea La Aldea y Juncalillo\nCuatro hermanos, con edades comprendidas entre los 22 y los 16 años, naturales de Jucalillo, murieron abrasados en el incendio de un almacén de La Aldea en 1951\nEl 25 de abril de 1951, una tragedia familiar conmocionó a los habitantes de La Aldea de San Nicolás. Cuatro hermanos, naturales de Jucalillo, que dormían en un almacén de la zona de Los Manantiales murieron abrasados en un incendio que se originó durante la madrugada. El mayor tenía 22 años; el más pequeño, solo 16. No pudieron abandonar el viejo cuarto a tiempo. Sus cadáveres quedaron apiñados junto a la puerta de entrada.\nAquel suceso creó en el ánimo del pueblo aldeano un hueco no sólo para la tristeza y el desasosiego, sino también para las interrogaciones. Todavía hoy nadie se explica lo ocurrido a los cuatro hijos de la familia de Nicolasa Carrillo Martín y Manuel García Saavedra, el segundo motorista de la presa Los Pérez, en aquella noche del 25 de abril de 1951. Conformaban una familia verdaderamente numerosa. Doña Nicolasa había dado a luz a una docena de hijos.\nEn aquella primavera, cuatro de sus hijos —los hermanos Manuel, Matilde, Cristóbal y Francisco García Carrillo, de veintidós, veinte, dieciocho y dieciséis años respectivamente— abandonaron su casa de Juncalillo, en Gáldar, para trabajar en la zafra tomatera, concretamente en la propiedad que don Rafael Rodríguez, conocido por el Pistolera, poseía en La Aldea. El resto de la familia se quedó en la cumbre. Una vez allí, se alojaron en un cuarto-almacén de la finca, situada en Los Manantiales, en condiciones precarias, como la mayoría de los temporeros de entonces.\nAquella noche murieron abrasados. Según la historia, una vela con la que se alumbraban encendió la tragedia. Fue una muerte agónica. A pesar de sus esfuerzos, no pudieron salir de aquel viejo cuarto. A la mañana siguiente, los cuatro hermanos fueron hallados carbonizados junto a la puerta. Sus cadáveres quedaron tan destrozados que solo un ataúd bastó para acogerlos.\nFamilia abatida\nLa noticia abatió al matrimonio García Carrillo, que acudió de urgencia hasta el pueblo aldeano para hacerse cargo del entierro en el viejo cementerio. Manuel y Nicolasa nunca superaron la tragedia. No podía ser de otro modo. Aquel trágico suceso quedaría marcado a fuego y llanto en su memoria hasta que la muerte borró también su existencia.\nCuriosamente, el hecho no fue investigado con profundidad a pesar de la intervención judicial; y aún no se sabe la verdad pues, en su momento, todo fueron conjeturas sin comprobar. Para colmo, la población campesina, que constituía, y con mucho, la mayoría del municipio, se hallaba totalmente desprotegida, sin derechos, y sometida a un régimen dictatorial.\nLa Justicia cerró el caso sin encontrar indicios de criminalidad. Y, por si fuera poco, la familia no recibió ningún tipo de indemnización porque, según relatan sus descendientes, en las diligencias instruidas por el juzgado de Guía, alguien se hizo pasar por el padre de familia, analfabeto, y firmó un documento en el que renunciaba a cualquier compensación.\nSegún Francisco Suárez Moreno, cronista oficial de La Aldea de San Nicolás, quien ha realizado un estudio sobre la siniestralidad en la sociedad tradicional (1801–1969) de su municipio, los hermanos se despertaron alrededor de las tres de la madrugada y, ante el incendio, gritaron e intentaron salir por la puerta sin conseguirlo. Los lamentos fueron oídos por algún vecino que creyó que se trataba de discusiones entre hermanos. “Lo cierto es que, desesperados, no pudieron abrir la puerta y perecieron carbonizados junto a ella”, asegura.\nNo obstante, las incógnitas de este suceso aún se mantienen: ¿dejaron al dormir alguna lumbre encendida y ésta fue en verdad la que provocó el incendio? ¿El cuarto estaba trancado? ¿El fuego se avivó por efectos de un bidón de combustible? ¿Por qué no pudieron forzar la puerta? Son preguntas a las que el avezado cronista aldeano no ha encontrado, desde aquel tiempo, las oportunas respuestas; o, al menos, las más razonables.\nEl Pistolera, un rico e influyente propietario agrícola natural de Gáldar, los tenía allí de trabajadores y los cuidaba como a su familia. No en vano era el padrino de Matilde, una de las víctimas. La gente cree que se durmieron con la vela encendida. En el cuarto había un bidón de gasoil o gasolina para el motor, lo que provocó que el incendio alcanzara cotas de desgracia. El humo los asfixió y encendió el misterio.\nAbandonaron Juncalillo con el sueño de poder trabajar.\nLa prensa censurada de la época no ofreció a sus lectores ni un solo detalle de este luctuoso suceso. Quince días más tarde, sin embargo, Falange abría su portada con la noticia de que el gobernador civil y jefe provincial del Movimiento, don José García Hernández, visitaba oficialmente La Aldea. El gobernador, acompañado de su séquito, se mostró entusiasta al ver un arco de flores frente al ayuntamiento con una gran pancarta que decía: “La Aldea de San Nicolás expresa su gratitud a don José García Hernández, gobernador civil de Las Palmas. La presa nos convertirá en una gran ciudad. Por siempre Franco. ¡Arriba España!”\nLa presa El Caidero de la Niña, que se terminó de construir en 1958, según el proyecto de Luis de Casa Calzada, era una justa ilusión de la comunidad de regantes a fin de lograr mayores beneficios para su agricultura. Y es que La Aldea vivía entonces un despegue económico en el sector primario, con la reanudación de los cultivos de tomate.\nHasta allí llegaban familias de vida humilde y andariega, desde otros pueblos de la isla o de Fuerteventura, siempre a la búsqueda de nuevos horizontes donde poder mejorar y salir de su mísera existencia. Para entonces, el Pistolera era un propietario de aquella fase expansiva del capitalismo agrario local. Son años en los que La Aldea crece en población y se abre al exterior gracias a notables mejoras en las comunicaciones, con la carretera de Mogán y sus tramos hacia las playas de Tasarte y Tasartico.\nLa familia García Carrillo fue una de los tantos temporeros que acudieron hasta La Aldea. Y es que cuando la miseria acosa puede obligar al estilo de vida itinerante; una realidad que mantiene su vigencia en la actualidad.\nManuel, Matilde, Cristóbal y Francisco García Carrillo estaban en la edad en la que los sueños son posibles, pero el incendio segó sus vidas.\n“Mi madre lloraba al verme”\nSalvador García Carrillo, un histórico del PSOE en Canarias que falleció en octubre de 2024, era el hermano menor de las víctimas. Conoció la cara del infortunio: la desesperación del padre, los gritos de su madre, los llantos de su hermano Daniel, que andaba por los ocho años. Él era todavía un chiquillo, de siete años, pero ya con la edad suficiente para atisbar que algo estaba ocurriendo en su entorno familiar. “Cuando aquella desgracia de mi familia yo estaba internado en el seminario viejo, en Las Palmas. Y recuerdo que mi madre se echaba a llorar cada vez que venía a verme, sin saber bien por qué. Dos años después, tras mucho preguntar por mis hermanos, mi madre me lo contó todo”, rememoraba Salvador García Carrillo en diciembre de 2009. Su madre, Nicolasa Carrillo, quedó afectada para siempre por la tremenda experiencia sufrida. “Mi madre nunca se recuperó de las depresiones”, lamentaba el político.\nRRSS WhatsApp\nRRSS Facebook\nRRSS Twitter\nRRSS email\nCopiar URL)\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil",

    "text": "Namwater suspended the process of drawing water for irrigation from the Hardap Dam on Thursday.\nThis is due to low levels of water in the dam attributed to drought, said NamWater spokesperson Lot Ndamanomhata in a media statement on Thursday.\n“This decision, however, does not affect the drinking water supply to the Mariental municipality or surrounding communities,” he said.\nAccording to Ndamanomhata, the measure aligns with NamWater’s commitment to secure water reserves for essential use, including potable and livestock needs.\nIt ensures adequate supply until the projected dry run date of February 2026, he added.\n“Recent consultations and analysis were undertaken with stakeholders to assess the availability of ‘dead storage’ water, allowing irrigation water supply through October 2024. Beyond this point, remaining reserves will be prioritised for human consumption and livestock needs.”\nNamWater recognises the critical need for water conservation during these times and encourages all Namibians to save water, especially as the\nHardap Dam levels remain under pressure, noted Ndamanomhata.\n“We reassure residents that this move is a proactive approach to managing the region’s water resources responsibly.”\nHe said NamWater will continue to monitor the situation closely.\n“We remain committed to balancing the needs of agricultural producers, residents and the local economy,” he added.",
