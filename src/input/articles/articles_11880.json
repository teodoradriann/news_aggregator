    "text": "THE deadly DANA continues to wreak havoc in Spain after claiming more than 200 lives across Valencia, Castilla-La Mancha and Andalucia. It has now turned its sight on the Balearic Islands, which are all under an orange-level alert for heavy rain and storms. Videos shared online on Friday afternoon showed how roads and streets had already become inundated with muddy flood water. The 112 emergency centre has issued an alert warning of the risk of three streams overflowing. They consist of the mouth of the Sa Riera in Palma, the Es Saluet in Port d’Andratx and the Es Galatzo in Santa Ponsa. Mallorca and Menorca are on an orange level alert from state weather agency Aemet. Meteorologists have warned of up to 150mm of rain per square metre within just a few hours across the entire two islands. The warning, which means there is a ‘significant risk’ to life and wellbeing, is in force until 8am tomorrow. Meanwhile, Ibiza is also on an orange alert for rainfall, with up to 50mm per square metre to fall within one hour – however the warning only lasts until 8pm.",

    "text": "This investment will support Uncaged’s commercial launch and allow the company to continue to increase production and expand its team, including growing the manufacturing team. The funding follows a strong year for Uncaged with a $2M pre-seed round announced last year, which included investment from VegInvest and InMotion Ventures, among others. The round was co-led by Green Circle FoodTech Ventures and Fall Line Capital, with participation from Ponderosa Ventures, Golden Seeds and existing investor InMotion Ventures, the investment arm of JLR (Jaguar Land Rover). Uncaged, founded in 2020, is redefining the use of leather in consumer and automotive goods. The company is working towards improving an industry by creating a platform of biomimetic substitutes for animal hide. Uncaged CEO and co-founder Stephanie Downs said: “Green Circle and Fall Line not only share our mission but also bring tremendous operational expertise. The tide has turned aggressively toward materials that are sustainable, and we plan to capture that momentum. This funding round brings UNCAGED another step closer to achieving our ultimate goal of disrupting every industry that relies on leather.” While Stu Strumwasser, founder and managing director of Green Circle Capital, says: “What Uncaged Innovations has achieved with its grain-based technology is a significant breakthrough in an industry that has long awaited a breakout innovation. The opportunity is enormous, and we believe that their ability to provide a high-quality material that is scaled and price competitive is a game changer.” How well do you really know your competitors?

    "text": "Astronomers have long grappled with the question, “How do planets form?” A new collaboration among Arizona State University, Michigan State University and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory will seek to answer this question with the help of a powerful telescope and high-performance computers.\nThe team of researchers will use 154 hours on the James Webb Space Telescope to probe the atmospheres of seven planets beyond our solar system — all of which were formed less than 300 million years ago, around the time dinosaurs roamed the Earth. In conjunction with JWST, this collaboration, called the KRONOS program, will use computers from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to create atmospheric models that could lead to understanding how planets form, evolve and possibly even harbor conditions favorable for life.\n“We are taking some of the first steps to probe young exoplanet atmospheres — a largely unknown population. Through our strategic partnership, we will push the limits of our models and data, looking for new insights into both planetary atmospheres and their host stars,” said KRONOS co-principal investigator Luis Welbanks, a 51 Pegasi b Fellow and incoming assistant professor at ASU's School of Earth and Space Exploration. “Our results will reveal the physical and chemical processes shaping these distant worlds, guiding the future of both theoretical and observational research”\nThree years into its operations, the JWST — a joint mission of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency — is already revolutionizing our understanding of planets beyond our solar system. Given the number of planets in our galaxy — 6,000 and counting — it’s clear that planet formation is pervasive. The details of how that happened, however, are still elusive. One way to find out is to observe planets of different ages, particularly young exoplanets less than 300 million years old, as they transit their host stars.\nDuring this transit, some of the starlight passes through the planet’s atmosphere, and molecules such as water or carbon dioxide absorb some of the light. Scientists observe exoplanet transits at different wavelengths to probe how the light is absorbed to uncover the composition of an exoplanet atmosphere.\nBy using physics-driven models of atmospheres, astronomers can explore an exoplanet’s composition, linking it to planetary formation and evolution theories.\n“The outstanding data quality of JWST’s observations can only be explained using models that capture the complex interactions between light and matter,” said Michael Line, associate professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at ASU, who is part of the team. “We must describe how molecules form, interact and get destroyed.”\nThe problem is these models come at a huge computational cost. To combat this, the KRONOS team won 22 million hours of computing time through the LLNL Computing Grand Challenge Program. This program provides significant quantities of institutional computing resources to LLNL scientists to perform cutting-edge research.\nThe models KRONOS creates will be used to understand the compositions of a wide variety of exoplanet atmospheres. This in turn can be used to understand how planets are formed.\n“Understanding the compositions of planetary atmospheres at different ages is still a big unknown because these planets are hard to find and even harder to characterize,” said KRONOS program co-principal investigator Adina Feinstein, a NASA Sagan Fellow and incoming assistant professor at MSU. “With the precision and instruments aboard JWST, we’re excited to have the ability to begin to directly address questions of what natal planets look like.”\nIn addition to the seven planets being studied by KRONOS, the team will generate models for all 70 exoplanets that have been observed by JWST.\n“An endeavor to uniformly model such a large sample of planets — from scorching worlds more massive than Jupiter to temperate and small Earth-mass planets — has yet to be undertaken,” said LLNL principal investigator Peter McGill. “This task can really only be accomplished using LLNL’s world-class, high-performance computing platforms.”\nOnce completed, the atmospheric models developed by the team will be made publicly available to the astronomy community. The goal is to encourage open collaborative science and make a lasting impact on the field.\nPress release written by Bethany Mauger, Michigan State University with contributions from Kim Baptista at ASU’s School of Earth and Space Exploration.\nMore Science and technology\nAI for AZ: ABOR funds new tools for state emergency response\nA huge wildfire rages in the wilderness of Arizona’s White Mountains.

    "text": "(Adnkronos) - Maltempo oggi sull'Italia con piogge e temporali a causa dell'arrivo di un’intensa perturbazione in questo venerdì 13 dicembre e aumenta la parascevedecatriafobia: la paura del venerdì 13. Il nome deriva da parasceve (dal greco paraskeuḗ ‘preparazione’, negli usi preparazione al sabato, quindi venerdì) + decatriafobia paura del numero 13.\nAntonio Sanò, fondatore del sito www.iLMeteo.it, conferma che questa fobia è talmente comune da influenzare la vita di tutti i giorni di milioni di persone: sembra infatti che si esca meno di casa, con conseguenze sulla vendita di servizi e sulle abitudini quotidiane. La parascevedecatriafobia condizionerà dunque questo venerdì 13 perturbato, specie al Centro-Sud.\nNelle prossime ore le precipitazioni interesseranno soprattutto il Mar Tirreno, anche con locali temporali di calore fuori stagione, ma poi bagneranno già in mattinata il lungo settore che corre dalla Liguria alla Campania; nel corso del pomeriggio i fenomeni scavalcheranno l'Appennino raggiungendo anche Marche, Abruzzo, Molise e nord Puglia. La giornata sarà nuvolosa e grigia quasi ovunque salvo al Nord e in particolare sulle Alpi.\nIl 13 dicembre si festeggia anche Santa Lucia, con l’errato proverbio ‘Santa Lucia il giorno più corto che ci sia’: la realtà astronomica ci conferma infatti ogni anno che il giorno più corto (con meno ore di luce) è il Solstizio d’Inverno, sabato 21 dicembre nel 2024; ciò nonostante, avremo un po’ più di luce da domani nei nostri pomeriggi. Il tramonto più precoce cadrà infatti oggi, da domani il sole calerà sempre un po’ più tardi.\nIl weekend sarà poi all’insegna di una medaglia a due facce: il sabato sarà ancora un po’ perturbato, la domenica risulterà in prevalenza soleggiata. E’ confermato, infatti, che la ‘perturbazione della parascevedecatriafobia’ sarà rapida e porterà fenomeni diffusi solo fino al pomeriggio di sabato 14; in seguito troveremo residui addensamenti sul versante tirrenico in spostamento la domenica verso il Sud dove si fermeranno un po’ più a lungo.\nLa prossima settimana, infine, vedrà l’espansione dell’Anticiclone delle Azzorre verso l’Italia con condizioni stabili, asciutte e più soleggiate ovunque. Le temperature saliranno in modo deciso in montagna, vedremo anche il cielo azzurro e un sole presente più al lungo nel pomeriggio (il sole tramonterà più tardi): tutte buone notizie per scacciare i fantasmi della giornata di oggi, della parascevedecatriafobia di questo venerdì 13 grigio e perturbato.\nVenerdì 13. Al Nord: nubi, piovaschi e nebbie. Al Centro: peggiora diffusamente sulle regioni peninsulari. Al Sud: piogge forti in arrivo specie sulla Campania.\nSabato 14. Al Nord: molte nubi. Al Centro: piogge sparse sulle Tirreniche. Al Sud: piogge e rovesci.\nDomenica 15. Al Nord: soleggiato. Al Centro: piovaschi in Molise. Al Sud: instabile su Gargano e basso Tirreno.\nTendenza: prossima settimana con l’Anticiclone delle Azzorre.",

    "text": "‘2000 chilometri per la Ricerca’, da Venezia a Bilbao in bicicletta. Pavanetto (FdI): “La Politica è chiamata a sensibilizzare l’opinione pubblica verso malattie che interessano la nostra comunità”\n(Arv) Venezia 18 lug. 2024 - Il consigliere regionale Lucas Pavanetto (FdI) ha presentato oggi a palazzo Ferro Fini il progetto '2000 Km for Prion Research', nato dalla necessità di creare una rete sinergica tra le varie associazioni nazionali e internazionali che si occupano di ricerca sulle malattie da Prioni. Fabio Mariuzzo pedalerà per oltre 2000 Km da Venezia a Bilbao in Spagna, sede della Fundación Española de Enfermedades Priónicas, con la quale AFIFF (Associazione Familiari Insonnia Familiare Fatale) ha stretto rapporti oltre un anno fa. Si tratta di un viaggio dalla forte componente simbolica perché la storia genealogica della malattia sembra suggerire che il primo paziente europeo fosse proprio un italiano emigrato in Spagna. L’Associazione AFIFF coinvolge familiari e amici dei soggetti affetti dalla mutazione, che vivono in diverse aree del nostro Paese.\n“Vogliamo portare a conoscenza dei cittadini e sensibilizzare l’opinione pubblica verso l’Insonnia Familiare Fatale – ha esordito Pavanetto - una malattia rara, che aggredisce pochissime persone al mondo, ma che nel nostro territorio ha colpito una famiglia, peraltro oggetto di studio”.\n“Credo, infatti, che la funzione più alta che la Politica è chiamata ad assolvere sia quella di fungere da cassa di risonanza e farsi carico della salute della propria comunità – ha spiegato il consigliere regionale - Ringrazio il presidente AFIFF Giovanni Mariuzzo per essere presente qui oggi e ricordo che l’associazione, nata nel 2003, persegue un triplice obiettivo: divulgare la conoscenza intorno alle malattie da Prioni; sostenere le persone che sono state colpite; contribuire in modo efficace alla ricerca. Proprio la ricerca ricopre un ruolo fondamentale: siamo chiamati a dare un nuovo impulso al lavoro dei ricercatori”.\n“Oggi, da Venezia, lanciamo un messaggio importante di sensibilizzazione, che arriverà in Spagna, grazie alla bella iniziativa di Fabio Mariuzzo, figlio del presidente AFIFF, il quale ha avviato una importante campagna per la raccolta di fondi. Ma è un messaggio da diffondere anche a livello nazionale per il riconoscimento dell’Insonnia Familiare Fatale, anche se già Telethon e altri importanti Istituti da tempo stanno approfondendo gli studi e la conoscenza su questa malattia rarissima”.\nIl Presidente AFIFF, Giovanni Mariuzzo, ha ricordato che “la nostra associazione è stata costituita nel 2003 su idea e sollecitazione del dott. Ignazio Roiter, che stava studiando l’ipotetica patologia dell’Insonnia Familiare Fatale”.\n“Abbiamo da poco concluso un importante progetto di ricerca decennale, finanziato da Telethon, per individuare una cura farmacologica per questa rarissima malattia neuro generativa. La sperimentazione di un farmaco sembra dare risultati incoraggianti. Siamo quindi orgogliosi che l’esperienza che abbiamo maturato possa risultare utile per combattere altre malattie neuro generative molto più impattanti a livello di persone colpite, penso in particolare ad Alzheimer e Parkinson”.\n“Come associazione siamo impegnati a far conoscere le malattie da Prioni e a sostenere chi ne è colpito e i suoi familiari”.\nIl dott. Vladimiro Artuso, nel suo intervento, ha ripercorso le principali tappe dell’iter storico e scientifico che ha portato all’approfondimento dell’Insonnia Familiare Fatale.\nFabio Mariuzzo, nella sua pedalata di 2000 chilometri da Venezia a Bilbao, toccherà varie città, tra le quali Verona, Milano e Monpellier, sede di alcuni dei centri di ricerca che si occupano della malattia.\nFabio fa parte di una delle famiglie venete affette dalla mutazione genetica che causa l’Insonnia Familiare Fatale, ed ha visto negli anni morire di questa malattia nonni, zii e cugini.\nLa responsabilità editoriale e i contenuti di cui al presente comunicato stampa sono a cura di CONSIGLIO REGIONALE VENETO\n© RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",

    "title": "FDA advisors' scrutiny of MDMA therapy is 'temporary setback,' says Harvard researcher | WBUR News",
    "text": "Advertisement FDA advisors' scrutiny of MDMA therapy is 'temporary setback,' says Harvard researcher [Resume] Some Boston-area researchers said they were surprised by federal advisors' rejection this week of MDMA-assisted therapy as a treatment for post traumatic stress disorder. The researchers said the decision by advisors to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reflected challenges facing regulators as psychedelic and psychoactive treatments such as MDMA enter mainstream psychiatry. On Tuesday, the [advisory panel found by a vote of 9-2](https://www.wbur.org/npr/nx-s1-4991112/mdma-therapy-ptsd-fda-advisors) that recent clinical trials sponsored by Lykos Therapeutics did not produce enough evidence to show the benefits of MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, in combination with talk therapy, outweighed the risks when treating post-traumatic stress disorder. Dr. Stephen Haggarty, with Mass General Hospital's Center for the Neuroscience of Psychedelics, called the vote a \"temporary setback.\" \"What's maybe unique about psychedelic drug development is there is a lot of scrutiny — and appropriately so — for how to do this correctly,\" Haggarty said. \"I'm personally grateful for those that are at the forefront, really laying the groundwork for what I anticipate will be other medications that will come. \"To use an appropriate Boston metaphor, I think we're in the first inning,\" he added. The FDA advisory panel cited a range of reasons for its concerns, including problems with the data from the clinical trials, as well as the novelty of a request to approve not only a drug treatment but also its use in combination with therapy. Dr. Mason Marks, a law professor and senior fellow with the Project on Psychedelics Law and Regulation at Harvard Law School's Petrie-Flom Center, joined All Things Considered host Deborah Becker to discuss the panel's decision. Below are highlights from their broadcast conversation, along with additional comments from the full interview. Interview Highlights On whether the FDA advisory committee during its consideration of MDMA was 'perhaps more rigorous or stringent' than is typical for the panel: Marks: \"The meeting really was extremely thorough and sweeping in its scope. ... I think the level of scrutiny was appropriate. The FDA panel cited problems with data from the clinical trials in its decision, among other issues. On why what's called 'unblinding' among participants may have prompted concerns: Marks: \"An 'unblinding' is when participants in a randomized controlled trial can identify which arm of the trial they've been assigned to. And that is a particular concern with psychedelic drugs and other psychoactive substances like MDMA. \"And the reason is that they produce profound changes of thought, perception and emotion. And so it's very obvious not only to the participant, but also to the researchers. So you have unblinding on both sides.\" On how much of an issue it was that the FDA was reviewing a combination drug and talk therapy — not just a medication: Marks: \"Regulating a drug-therapy combination is not something that the agency is accustomed to. It's not necessarily ... a role it wants to be thrust into. And you could almost feel that sense of uneasiness at points in the meeting. \"But another issue is that the committee clearly felt that that therapeutic component of the treatment was not well-defined and perhaps not well standardized.\" On whether it was \"late in the game\" for the FDA to raise questions on the parameters of the clinical trial: Marks: \"The FDA is expected to deliver its decision on this new drug application on Aug. 11 of this year. So you're right that this really is sort of the last step, and we should have a decision very soon. \"... There were recommendations from the FDA that could have changed the direction of those trials. And one thing that seems to have concerned the committee is that the drug sponsor — the manufacturer — may not have been quite as responsive to those suggestions. \"... All parties involved were very sympathetic to the significant unmet need for treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder. ... They just ultimately decided that the data was not sufficient.\" On whether the stigma around psychedelics or recreational drugs may have been at play for the FDA advisory committee: Marks: \"Surprisingly, I think stigma played little or no role. The committee and the FDA have expressed great openness to psychedelic treatments — and even enthusiasm for them, [or] cautious optimism. And I feel the same way; I remain very optimistic about psychedelic treatments.\" On how much of a setback Dr. Marks thinks the FDA advisors' votes may be: Marks: \"I agree that this is a temporary setback. I'm moved by the reports of people who benefit from MDMA, and there is a risk that if the application is denied, it could delay the availability of MDMA to people who could stand to benefit. And it's unclear what the FDA will do when it renders this decision in August. \"There certainly have been cases where the agency has gone against the advice of its advisory committees, but that doesn't usually happen. \"There is such enthusiasm, and there is that unmet need for psychedelics — and there are many other companies in this space with treatments in the pipeline — that I don't think it will significantly negatively impact the sector on the whole if the application is rejected.\" This segment aired on June 6, 2024.",

    "text": "Air Canada offers 32.5% increase for flight attendants in contract talks\nSource says airline also agreed to pay workers for some of the time they spend on the ground\nAir Canada offered its flight attendants an overall increase of more than 30 per cent over four years ahead of a potential strike, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.\nThe union representing the airline’s more than 10,000 flight attendants announced Tuesday that its members voted 99.7 per cent to strike, putting them in a legal position to walk off the job as soon as Aug. 16. Airlines usually begin winding down operations and canceling flights days before a potential labour disruption.\nAir Canada proposed to increase total compensation, including benefits and bonuses, by about 20 per cent in the first year of a contract and a total of 32.5 per cent over four years, said the person, speaking on condition they not be identified in order to speak about private talks.\nThe airline also agreed to pay workers for some of the time they spend on the ground — a request made by the union. Currently, Air Canada flight attendants are only paid when the aircraft is in motion, a common practice in the industry, but one which is increasingly being challenged.\n“The company has never presented this offer to the union,” Nathalie Garceau, a spokesperson for the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said by email. “If this indeed what the company plans to present when we resume negotiations on Friday, we look forward to discussing it then.”\nLast month, United Airlines Holdings Inc.’s flight attendants rejected a contract providing cumulative pay increases of as much as 45.6 per cent over five years — the agents would have been paid while passengers were boarding. Delta Air Lines Inc. became the first U.S. airline to pay them during this period.\nAir Canada and the union failed to reach an agreement during a two-month conciliation process that ended in July. The latest 10-year contract expired at the end of March.\n- Air Canada flight attendants vote in favour of strike mandate\n- Air Canada shares plunge as decline in travel to U.S. hits bottom line\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nIn a document posted on its website, Air Canada says that half of its mainline flight attendants earned more than $54,000 in 2024, excluding incentive rewards, pensions, and health benefits. Workers at Air Canada Rouge, the company’s budget brand, earn less.\nThe union’s president, Wesley Lesosky, said in a statement Tuesday that Air Canada is “exploiting their own employees by severely underpaying flight attendants or refusing to pay them at all for safety-critical aspects of our jobs.”\nA spokesperson for the airline said: “Out of respect for the negotiation process, we do not comment on what each party may or may not have offered at the negotiation table.”\nLast year, Air Canada’s pilots got a compensation increase of 42 per cent over four years in a last-minute deal, averting a strike that would have grounded more than 1,000 daily flights worldwide. That agreement was reached after a wave of substantial pay increases for pilots across North America.\nThe airline paid $4.9 billion in wages, salaries and benefits last year, representing about 23 per cent of operating costs. It posted an operating income of $1.26 billion, or about 5.7 per cent of revenue.\n— With assistance from Mary Schlangenstein.",
