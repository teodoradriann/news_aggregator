    "text": "Challenges Of Being In Love With An Emotionally Broken Man Are you in love with an emotionally broken man? Well, then you will resonate with certain challenges associated with it. Read on to know more about them. (Picture Credit: Freepik) If you're in love with an emotionally broken man, then you will realise that there are some common challenges associated with it. An emotionally broken man may learn to love again, trust again, but may find it difficult to express himself. Since we all know how major role communication plays in an intimate relationship, when a man finds it hard to express himself and contribute his 100% to the relationship, it invariably takes a toll on the health of the relationship. Listed below are some of the common challenges associated with being in love with an emotionally broken man. He doesn’t confide in you When an emotionally broken man falls in love with a girl they may have trouble confiding in her. From not sharing their day-to-day happenings with their partner to not being able to talk about their heartfelt feelings and vulnerabilities, emotionally broken men have been hurt before and they fear getting hurt again. To evade that, they may act in a distant and aloof manner with their partner.

However, they may be incapable of expressing it. So, if you are in love with an emotionally broken man, then you may resonate with this that he can be extremely cold and ruthless at times. Even when they realise that you want them to communicate or you want them to be more involved in the relationship, they may not be able to give in even their 20%. They may dismiss your feelings and may not pay any attention to your needs at times. He may act as if he doesn't care It is often noticed that emotionally broken men develop a strong defence mechanism over a period of time. So, in situations when you have a fight or when you are not in talking terms with each other, it is possible that he will make you feel that he is completely capable of detaching himself from you. This can make it particularly difficult for their partners to deal with them and understand them.

It only happens when two people develop a strong emotional intimacy with each other. However, with emotionally broken men, it can be sometimes difficult to establish strong emotional intimacy, because the may never let their guard down and talk about their vulnerabilities, their innermost feelings, what their past experiences have been and how they feel about things. He may act in a very rigid manner Emotionally broken men can be very rigid at times. Especially, when their partner tries to reason with them to change their ways, they may become very defensive. It happens because in their head they are doing the right thing and thinking in the right direction.

    "text": "Did you see it? Northern Lights visible in Oklahoma: Will we see them again tonight? Aaron Valdez , Chad Murphy , Cheyenne Derksen The Oklahoman Show Caption\nHide Caption\nWatch: Timelapse video captures northern lights across the country A timelapse video captured a mesmerizing aurora as it danced across the night skies. The northern lights were visible in Oklahoma on Thursday night thanks to a severe geomagnetic storm.\nOklahoma sat pretty far outside the forecasted view line of Thursday's aurora forecast by the Space Weather Prediction Center. The geomagnetic storm watch issued by the center Thursday was the second this year, when the aurora borealis was seen as far south as Alabama.\nAurora borealis forecast tonight through Friday. Will the northern lights be visible from Oklahoma? An incoming geomagnetic storm hit the Earth on Thursday morning, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center .\nThe storm was expected to push the northern lights as far south as Alabama.\nAurora borealis map Here's a map of the Aurora Borealis forecast created by the Space Weather Prediction Center, showing how far south the aurora might come tonight.\nWhat time will the Northern Lights be visible? During times of high geomagnetic activity, which pushes the northern lights further south, the aurora will be visible directly overhead in the northern United States, according to the prediction center .\nFor the best viewing, the center recommends that it be very dark. Get away from city lights and avoid trying to see them on the night of a full moon. The best time to view the aurora is within an hour or two of midnight, or 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.\nHow to take pictures of the aurora borealis with an iPhone If you're looking to get a photo of the northern lights, your cellphone camera should do the job. But you might need to make a couple of adjustments to the settings.\nAccording to Travelfoss , to get the best image, you should adjust your iPhone to capture more light. Night mode will automatically turn on, which allows the camera sensor to stay open for 1 to 3 seconds, depending on the light. For the best image of the aurora, you should adjust that setting to its maximum of 10 seconds (or 30 seconds if you're using a tripod).\nIf there's too much ambient light, night mode might let in too much and overexpose your photos. To combat that, you might need to modify the exposure adjustment setting, per Travelfoss.\nWhat's causing so many solar storms? The sun is nearing its solar cycle peak The sun is becoming more active as it nears the peak of its current 11-year solar cycle, which began in 2019, according to NASA ,\nAs the peak (which is projected to happen in July 2025) nears, geomagnetic storms are more likely to occur. That, in turn, increases the chances that the aurora will be visible from the United States, Erica Grow Cei, meteorologist and spokesperson for the SWPC, previously told the Beacon Journal .\nFollowing the peak, solar activity slows down, according to NASA, growing less and less until the solar minimum. At that point, a new solar cycle begins as solar activity rebounds.\nWhat are the northern lights? How does the aurora borealis work? Auroras are ribbons of light weaving across Earth's northern or southern polar regions, according to NASA . Magnetic storms that have been triggered by solar activity, such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections, cause them. The solar wind carries energetic charged particles from these events away from the sun.\nThese energized particles hit the atmosphere at 45 million mph and are redirected to the poles by the earth's magnetic field, according to Space.com , creating the light show.\nDuring major geomagnetic storms, the auroras expand away from the poles and can be seen over some parts of the United States, according to the NOAA .\nNOAA offers aurora dashboard If you're curious about the latest forecast for the aurora, the NOAA has a tool for that. The Aurora Dashboard offers a visual, animated prediction of where the aurora might be seen in the next few minutes as well as the following day.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

    "title": "Saudi club now open to offers for West Ham target that flopped in Saudi Pro League",
    "text": "Al-Ittihad are reportedly open to accepting a loan bid for Jota, who has been sidelined from the league squad since September 2023. West Ham and Wolves have shown interest in the outcast player, according to [The Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/transfer-news-live-manutd-liverpool-31925794). It’s understood that the 24-year-old Jota turned down a loan move to Steven Gerrard’s Al Ettifaq despite both clubs reaching an agreement. A loan deal could be beneficial for West Ham, especially given their considerations regarding Said Benrahma and Pablo Fornals. Indeed, with the potential departure of Said Benrahma and Pablo Fornals, Jota could be an ideal addition to David Moyes’ squad, particularly considering the team’s performance when key players like Jarrod Bowen, Lucas Paqueta, and Mohammed Kudus have been unavailable. Certainly, Jota possesses the quality to thrive in the Premier League, potentially serving as a backup to David Moyes’ preferred attacking trio. His track record, including scoring 28 goals in 85 appearances across two spells with Celtic in Scotland, demonstrates his capability. Although he has “flopped” in the Saudi Pro League, people should take that with a pinch of salt before writing off his Premier League chances. Given Tottenham Hotspur manager, Ange Postecoglou, is a big fan of him, that surely says something about his ability and work ethic.",
