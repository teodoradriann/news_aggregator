    "text": "Read full article NY Daily News Ex-Def Jam honcho Kevin Liles files to dismiss sexual assault suit Jami Ganz, New York Daily News April 10, 2025 at 12:17 a.m. · 2 min read\nLink Copied\nNEW YORK — Former Def Jam honcho Kevin Liles is filing to dismiss the sexual assault lawsuit brought against him earlier this year for alleged decades-old sexual harassment, assault and rape allegations.\nA woman identified only as Jane Doe sued the 57-year-old music exec in February for allegedly sexually harassing her during her employment at Def Jam, from 2000 to 2002 , culminating in an eventual alleged sexual assault and rape, TMZ previously reported. Liles denied the “outrageous” allegations as “shameful … lies” in a statement issued to the outlet at the time.\nLawyers for Liles on Tuesday requested Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald dismiss the case with prejudice, citing the “entirely false” allegations and an expired statute of limitations, according to legal documents filed in New York and obtained by the Daily News.\nPrior to Doe’s “patently false and untimely lawsuit,” Liles’ legal team says he never faced allegations of “sexual impropriety.”\nADVERTISEMENT Given that Doe says she was raped in 2002, Liles’ lawyers also maintain the alleged assault occurred outside of New York’s statute of limitations, over a year past its “‘look-back’ window for reviving such time-barred claims.”\nIn its own filing to Judge Buchwald, also viewed by The News, UMG Recordings argues it can’t be held liable for the claims against Liles. If he did what he’s accused of, the company says, “the alleged conduct was indisputably not in furtherance of any business of UMGR.”\nLiles’ camp also maintains that Doe “offers zero factual bases for her salacious allegations” and that her claims are too broad and vague.\nThey point to the “unspecified ‘derogatory and degrading comments based on her gender regarding her body and appearance'” he’d allegedly mak. Such vagueness, they say, also applies to Doe’s “threadbare” description of the alleged sexual assault and rape “spanning only three paragraphs.”\nDoe filed her lawsuit in late February — which said UMG and Def Jam “not only knew or should have known” of the alleged conduct and Liles’ alleged “propensity” to commit it — shortly after Liles’ September departure from Warner Music’s 300 Elektra Entertainment, which he co-founded.\nADVERTISEMENT Liles said he’d stay on board through year’s end to assist with the transition, per memos obtained by Variety at the time.\nThe client roster at 300, of which Liles was also CEO, includes the likes of Mary J. Blige and Megan Thee Stallion. Liles’ departure was announced following that of other Warner execs.",

    "title": "The Brown v. Board of Education case didn't start how you think it did",
    "text": "(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.) Charise Cheney, University of Oregon (THE CONVERSATION) As the nation celebrates the 65th anniversary of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case, the case is often recalled as one that “forever changed the course of American history.” But the story behind the historic Supreme Court case, as I plan to show in my forthcoming book, “Blacks Against Brown: The Black Anti-Integration Movement in Topeka, Kansas, 1941-1954,” is much more complex than the highly inaccurate but often-repeated tale about how the lawsuit began. The story that often gets told is that – as recounted in this news story – the case began with Oliver Brown, who tried to enroll his daughter, Linda, at the Sumner School, an all-white elementary school in Topeka near the Browns’ home. Or that Oliver Brown was a “determined father who took Linda Brown by the hand and made history.” As my research shows, that tale is at odds with two great historical ironies of Brown v. Board. The first irony is that Oliver Brown was actually a reluctant participant in the Supreme Court case that would come to be named after him. In fact, Oliver Brown, a reserved man, had to be convinced to sign on to the lawsuit because he was a new pastor at church that did not want to get involved in Topeka NAACP’s desegregation lawsuit, according to various Topekans whose recollections are recorded in the Brown Oral History Collection at the Kansas State Historical Society. The second irony is that, of the five local desegregation cases brought before the Supreme Court by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in 1953, Brown’s case – formally known as Oliver Brown et al., v. Board of Education of Topeka, et al. – ended up bringing widespread attention to a city where many blacks actually resisted school integration. That not-so-small detail has been overshadowed by the way the case is presented in history. Black resistance to integration While school desegregation may have symbolized racial progress for many blacks throughout the country, that simply was not the case in Topeka. In fact, most of the resistance to the NAACP’s school desegregation efforts in Topeka came from Topeka’s black citizens, not whites. “I didn’t get anything from white folks,” Leola Brown Montgomery, wife of Oliver and mother of Linda, recalled. “I tell you here in Topeka, unlike the other places where they brought these cases we didn’t have any threats” from whites. Prior to the Brown case, black Topekans had been embroiled in a decade-long conflict over segregated schools that began with a lawsuit involving Topeka’s junior high schools. When the Topeka School Board commissioned a poll to determine black support for integrated junior high schools in 1941, 65 percent of black parents with junior high school students indicated that they preferred all-black schools, according to school board minutes. Separate but equal Another wrinkle to the story is that the city’s four all-black elementary schools – Buchanan, McKinley, Monroe and Washington – had resources, facilities and curricula that were comparable to that of Topeka’s white schools. The Topeka school board actually adhered to the “separate-but-equal” standard established by the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case. Even Linda Brown recalled the all-black Monroe Elementary School that she attended as a “very nice facility, being very well-kept.” “I remember the materials that we used being of good quality,” Linda Brown stated in a 1985 interview. That made the Topeka lawsuit unique among the cases the NAACP Legal Defense Fund combined and argued before the Supreme Court in 1953. Black schoolchildren in Topeka did not experience overcrowded classrooms like those in Washington, D.C., nor were they subjected to dilapidated school buildings like those in Delaware or Virginia. While black parents in Delaware and South Carolina petitioned their local school boards for bus service, the Topeka School Board voluntarily provided buses for black children. Topeka’s school buses became central to the local NAACP’s equal access complaint due to weather and travel conditions. Quality education was “not the issue at that time,” Linda Brown recalled, “but it was the distance that I had to go to acquire that education.” Another unique characteristic of Topeka public schools was that black students went to both all-black elementary and predominantly white junior high and high schools. This fact presented another challenge for the Topeka NAACP’s desegregation crusade. The transition from segregated elementary schools to integrated junior and senior high schools was a harsh and alienating one. Many black Topekans recalled the overt and covert racism of white teachers and administrators. “It wasn’t the grade schools that sunk me,” Richard Ridley, a black resident and Topeka High School alumnus who graduated in 1947, told interviewers for the Brown Oral History Collection at the Kansas State Historical Society. “It was the high school.” Black teachers cherished A primary reason that black Topekans fought the local NAACP’s desegregation efforts is because they appreciated black educators’ dedication to their students. Black residents who opposed school integration often spoke of the familial environment in all-black schools. Linda Brown herself praised the teachers at her alma mater, Monroe Elementary, for having high expectations and setting “very good examples for their students. Black teachers proved to be a formidable force against the local NAACP. \"We have a situation here in Topeka in which the Negro Teachers are violently opposed to our efforts to integrate the public schools,” NAACP branch Secretary Lucinda Todd wrote in a letter to the national NAACP in 1953. Black supporters of all-black schools used a number of overt and covert tactics to undermine NAACP members’ efforts. Those tactics included lobbying, networking, social ostracism, verbal threats, vandalism, sending harassing mail, making intimidating phone calls, the Brown Oral History Collection reveals. But the national office of the NAACP never appreciated the unique challenges that its local chapter faced. The Topeka NAACP struggled to recruit plaintiffs, despite their door-to-door canvassing. Fundraising was also a major problem. The group could not afford the legal services of their attorneys and raised only $100 of the $5,000 needed to bring the case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Unheralded legacy History ultimately would not be on the side of the majority of Topeka’s black community. A small cohort of local NAACP members kept pushing for desegregation, even as they stood at odds with most black Topekans. Linda Brown and her father may be remembered as the faces of Brown v. Board of Education. But without the resilience and resourcefulness of three local NAACP members – namely, Daniel Sawyer, McKinley Burnett and Lucinda Todd – there would have been no Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. The real story of Brown v. Board may not capture the public imagination like that of a 9-year-old girl who “brought a case that ended segregation in public schools in America.” Nevertheless, it is the truth behind the myth. And it deserves to be told. Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this story appeared in The Conversation on March 30, 2018.

    "title": "Mark Carney would be 'outstanding' addition to federal politics, Trudeau says",
    "text": "OTTAWA — Mark Carney would be an \"outstanding addition\" to federal politics, the prime minister said Thursday, in response to speculation that he is trying to recruit the former Bank of Canada governor to join his cabinet. Trudeau was asked about the possibility of replacing Chrystia Freeland by making Carney his new finance minister during a press conference at the NATO summit in Washington, D.C. Rather than deny the possibility, Trudeau praised Carney and said he's been talking to him about joining federal politics for years. \"I think he would be an outstanding addition at a time when Canadians need good people to step up in politics,\" Trudeau said. But he also emphasized that he has full confidence in Freeland. \"In regards to Chrystia, she has been a close friend and ally and partner in doing really big things for Canada and will continue to be,\" he said. In French, Trudeau said he was \"always open\" to having other people join the party. A source in the Prime Minister's Office, who spoke under condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the suggestion that Trudeau is thinking about replacing Freeland with Carney is \"totally false.\" The idea of Carney running for the Liberals has been a constant discussion in Canadian political circles for years, and he himself has not ruled out the possibility of one day seeking the Liberal leadership. Speculation about a role for Carney, either in the Liberal cabinet or at the helm of it, has run rampant since the Liberals lost a long-held seat in a Toronto byelection last month. Most thought the seat would be a safe one for the Liberals, and the loss sparked calls for Trudeau's resignation from within and outside the party. Despite the criticism, Trudeau has pledged to lead the Liberals into the next election. Carney's supporters see him as a strong economic candidate, as the Liberals struggle to address the growing expense of basic needs in Canada and defend against criticism about government spending. Conservatives have already taken aim at Carney, and even called for him to appear at a parliamentary committee in April so they could grill him about his plans for government economic and fiscal policy.

    "text": "El huracán Milton, una poderosa tormenta de la temporada de huracanes del Atlántico 2024, alcanzó categoría 5 en el Golfo de México antes de impactar la costa oeste de Florida. Al tocar tierra, lo hizo como un huracán de categoría 3, con vientos de hasta 190 kilómetros por hora, generando inundaciones severas, cortes de energía y tornados. A pesar de debilitarse a medida que atravesaba el estado, dejó algunos daños significativos en ciudades como Tampa y Orlando e imágenes espectaculares de la devastación. Tras el paso del huracán, las autoridades trabajan actualmente en evaluar los daños y brindar ayuda a los cientos de miles de afectados en Florida. La tormenta ha causado un reguero de destrucción que se estima que tiene un valor de más de 55.000 millones de dólares, dejando a más de 3 millones de personas sin electricidad, inundando las islas barrera y causando daños graves en infraestructuras como el estadio de béisbol de los Tampa Bay Rays. Este desastre llega solo dos semanas después del paso del huracán Helene, que ya dejó mermada la región. Entre los rescates que más han destacado está el de un niño de 14 años en Hillsborough. Un vídeo muestra al sheriff del condado, Chad Chronister, y la Unidad Marina rescatando al menor, que se mantenía a flote en una zona inundada, agarrado a los restos de una valla. Aún no se sabe cuánto tiempo estuvo atrapado ni por qué estaba solo, pero afortunadamente fue encontrado con vida. El impacto de Milton es devastador, y los esfuerzos de rescate son vitales para salvar vidas. Las autoridades se centran en restaurar los servicios básicos y ayudar a los desplazados, pero la magnitud de los daños hace evidente que la recuperación será larga y requerirá una fuerte colaboración entre gobiernos y agencias de ayuda para ayudar a las comunidades afectadas a reconstruir sus vidas tras la tormenta.",
