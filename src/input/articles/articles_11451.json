    "text": "Ciència Antoni Güell, el vilafranquí expert en medicina aeroespacial El govern francès li va concedir la màxima distinció de l’Estat El neuròleg i expert en medicina aeroespacial Antoni Güell Sabaté va morir dimarts a Tolosa, a l’edat de 72 anys, segons ha confirmat el mitjà local del Penedès El 3 de Vuit. Va néixer el maig del 1951 a Vilafranca del Penedès. Se’n va anar a la Universitat de Tolosa a estudiar les carreres de matemàtica i física i la de medicina. Es va especialitzar en neurologia i de tesi de final de carrera va estudiar l’ecografia Doppler, una prova no invasiva que calcula el flux de sang dels vasos sanguinis fent rebotar ones sonores d’alta freqüència. Acabada la tesi, es va quedar a treballar a l’hospital i a la Universitat de Tolosa. Va ser cap del laboratori d’exploració del sistema nerviós i posteriorment va entrar a treballar al Centre Nacional d’Estudis Especials de París (CNES) per estudiar la circulació cerebral i les funcions cognitives de la gent que resta tancada durant dies, setmanes o mesos a l’espai. Va ser cap de programes de ciències de la vida, cap de valoritzacions i cap del departament d’aplicacions ciutadanes dels satèl·lits d’observació de la Terra. També va crear i dirigir l’Institut Francès de Medicina Espacial. Una de les anècdotes que Güell explica en una entrevista l’any 2015 al diari Ara és que el 1995, quan una de les seves col·legues del CNES va decidir anar a l’espai, Güell li va demanar que s’endugués un caganer. Durant 16 dies aquella figureta del pessebre català va estar fent voltes a la Terra a bord de l’estació especial MIR. Als anys vuitanta el govern francès li va demanar iniciar una col·laboració amb la Unió Soviètica en el terreny dels astronautes i de l’home a l’espai. Va conèixer els diferents cosmonautes soviètics i uns anys després, gràcies a la influència de David Cardús i Joan Oró, també va fer d’assessor a la NASA. En plena guerra freda va treballar a un costat i a l’altre del bàndol, i a partir de 1998 també ho va fer, vinculat al govern francès, per la Xina. Va ser autor i coautor de més de 300 publicacions, feia conferències sobre Gaudí, les bases psicoanalítiques del surrealisme i Dalí, i aquests darrers anys s’havia muntat una consulta mèdica a Tolosa per gent que viu en la precarietat.

    "text": "Open: | - |\nChange: | - |\nVolume: | - |\nLow: | - |\nHigh: | - |\nHigh / Low range: | - |\nType: | Stocks |\nTicker: | HAG |\nISIN: | DE000HAG0005 |\nEQS-News: HENSOLDT with growing revenue and strong order intake in the first half of 2025\n- 44\nEQS-News: HENSOLDT AG\n/ Key word(s): Half Year Results/Half Year Report\nHENSOLDT with growing revenue and strong order intake in the first half of 2025\nTaufkirchen, 31 July 2025 – The HENSOLDT Group (“HENSOLDT”) continued its successful development in the first half of 2025 and reaffirmed its strong positioning in the field of defence and security electronics. The security policy environment, which was marked by numerous crises and conflicts, and the resulting increase in defence spending once again led to a high level of order intake. This rose to a total of EUR 1,405 million in the first six months of the current financial year (previous year: EUR 1,359 million). Revenue increased to EUR 944 million (previous year: EUR 849 million). The strong performance of the optronics business offset the expected slower start in the sensors segment. In addition, there was less pass-through business (revenue with low value added) compared to the previous year. The book-to-bill ratio remained at a high level of 1.5x (previous year: 1.6x). Adjusted EBITDA developed positively and amounted to EUR 107 million in the first half of the year (previous year: EUR 103 million), while the adjusted EBITDA margin declined slightly to 11.3% (previous year: 12.2%). This development reflects the temporary lower productivity in the Sensors segment due to the ramp-up phase of the new logistics centre. Oliver Dörre, CEO of HENSOLDT, says: \"The current security situation makes it clear every day how important it is for Germany and Europe to invest more in their own security. We now expect this political will to increasingly translate into concrete orders – and to arrive in our production halls in very real terms. Our renewed increase in order intake underscores this development and shows that we have the right solutions to enable our customers to meet the security requirements of the future. But it also contains a clear mandate: we will do everything in our power to deliver quickly, reliably and with the highest quality. Because true defence capability comes from the consistent expansion of industrial capacity and innovative strength.” Christian Ladurner, CFO of HENSOLDT, says: “Our solid financial performance confirms our strategic course and enables us to continue investing decisively in our future. With targeted measures such as capacity expansion through automation and outsourcing, the new logistics centre as the key to further production increases, and the new building in Oberkochen, which will enable more efficient and profitable processes, we are laying the foundation for tomorrow's growth today. We are well on track with all key transformation initiatives, creating capacity that will be sustainable until at least 2028. In addition, we are anticipating further developments and, once we have binding planning reliability, we are ready to take further steps.\" Seven billion mark exceeded in order backlog With a volume of EUR 1,405 million, order intake in the first half of the current financial year exceeded the already high level of the same period last year by another 3%, thus showing strong development despite the federal elections and change of government. This increase led to a new record order backlog of EUR 7,070 million (previous year: EUR 6,553 million), which ensures a very high level of visibility. In the Sensors segment, order intake remained at a high level and was particularly influenced by contract extensions for Eurofighter Mk1 radars, the Eurofighter Halcon programme and further orders for TRML-4D radars. In the Optronics segment, order intake was significantly higher than in the same period of the previous year. Orders for the Ground Based Systems product line accounted for the largest share. Completed refinancing increases financial flexibility In July 2025, HENSOLDT successfully placed a promissory note loan on the capital market, thereby taking advantage of the new financing opportunities resulting from the refinancing completed in April. Strong investor demand for the promissory note loan led to oversubscription, with the total volume reaching €300 million. With this important building block in its long-term financial strategy, the company was able to secure attractive terms and further diversify its investor base. Outlook for the 2025 financial year confirmed HENSOLDT expects business to continue developing positively in the 2025 financial year and confirms its guidance for all relevant key figures. Specifically, the company expects revenues of between EUR 2,500 and 2,600 million and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2. An adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 18% is also forecast. Key figures\nThe half-year statement for the financial year 2025 is available on the Investor Relations website of HENSOLDT AG. The results for the first nine months of 2025 are expected to be published on 7 November 2025.\nHENSOLDT is a leading company in the European defence industry with a global reach. Based in Taufkirchen near Munich, the company develops sensor solutions for defence and security applications. As a system integrator, HENSOLDT offers platform-independent, networked sensors. At the same time, the company is driving forward the development of defence electronics and optronics as a technology leader and investing in new solutions based on software-defined defence. In addition, the company is expanding its range of offers to include new service models and is extending its portfolio of system solutions. In 2024, HENSOLDT achieved a turnover of 2.24 billion euros. Following the acquisition of the ESG Group, the company employs around 9,000 people. HENSOLDT is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in the MDAX.

    "text": "A major winter storm is set to sweep through the Mid-Atlantic starting Sunday night, bringing snow, freezing rain, and icy conditions that are likely to disrupt travel and daily activities. Areas from central Pennsylvania to northern Virginia are expected to feel the brunt of the storm, with forecasters urging residents to prepare for hazardous conditions.\nCredit: US National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington What to Expect\nWestern suburbs of Baltimore and Washington, D.C., could see up to six inches of snow, while parts of West Virginia and western Maryland may be buried under as much as 15 inches. In contrast, areas farther south, including parts of Virginia and the Carolinas, are more likely to see sleet and freezing rain.\n“This storm will make roads slick and dangerous, especially late Sunday into Monday morning,” said Brandon Buckingham, a meteorologist with AccuWeather. “Freezing rain could turn even short trips into hazardous journeys.”\nTravel Concerns\nThe storm is expected to peak overnight Sunday and into Monday morning, making it difficult for commuters heading into work or school. Snow and ice will likely create treacherous conditions on roads, particularly on bridges and overpasses.\nLocal officials are advising residents to avoid unnecessary travel during the storm. Even small amounts of ice can cause significant hazards, and road crews may struggle to keep up with the rapidly changing conditions.\nLingering Cold Air\nAfter the storm passes, cold temperatures will linger for several days, keeping snow and ice from melting quickly. This extended chill could also set the stage for more winter weather later in January.\nPower outages are another concern, especially in areas where ice builds up on trees and power lines. Residents are encouraged to stock up on essentials, including food, water, and batteries, in case of extended outages.\nHow to Prepare\nAvoid travel unless absolutely necessary, especially late Sunday and early Monday. Stock up on essentials such as groceries, water, and medications. Prepare for possible power outages with flashlights, blankets, and emergency supplies. Monitor local weather alerts for the latest updates.",

    "title": "A story of mercy and grace",
    "text": "A story of mercy and grace\nPublished 3:45 pm Thursday, January 23, 2025\nI love the Gospel of John. The account of Jesus’ ministry on this earth is good in any gospel but John gives us the stories of individual encounters of people with Jesus. Today we will be looking at John 5 and the story of the man at the Pool of Bethesda.\nThe name of the pool, Bethesda, is Aramaic and it means, “House of Mercy.” It sits north of the temple in Jerusalem near the “Sheep Gate.” The pool was surrounded by five colonnades, porches where disabled people, the blind, and the paralyzed gathered for shade and the hope of healing.\nLegend had it that an angel would come down and stir up the water. The first person in the water after the “angelic stirring” would be made well of every disease or affliction suffered. There is no Biblical account of this ever happening, but the legend was strong and a great number of afflicted but hopeful people would lie there expecting a miracle.\nAccording to John 5:5-7, on this day, Jesus was visiting the Pool of Bethesda and walked by a man who had been disabled for thirty-eight years. Jesus stopped and asked the man, “ Do you want to be healed?” The man began to explain “While I am trying to get in, someone else goes ahead of me. I have no one to help me.”\nJesus responded to the man’s desperate account and said, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.” The man was instantly cured, and John 5:9 tells us he picked up his mat and walked. It was a complete restoration of muscles, joints, ligaments, tendons, and bones. A man who had been paralyzed for thirty-eight years walked away from his pain, humiliation, and aloneness. In the presence of Jesus, he was completely, instantly healed!\nThere were many others there that day, but we only have the account of this man. I believe he was “the one healed” for two reasons. He finally knew he could not do it by himself, and he knew that in the natural world, there was no one to help. He was desperate and had no hope in the legend or his ability. When we surrender our ability and our expectation of others to meet our needs, then we open the door for supernatural intervention.\nI’ve often thought it funny that Jesus asked him if he wanted to be healed. It seemed obvious; he was there hoping the legend of the angel would come true. Could Jesus not figure out the man’s desire? Of course, he could but he wanted the man to declare his faith! “I want to be healed!”\nI believe every detail and every word in scripture is present for a reason. The name of the pool, “Bethesda, House of Mercy” and the location nestled within five porches give us added insight into this miracle. In the scripture five is the number representing “grace.” So, this man was sitting by mercy and surrounded by grace for many years before he received his miracle. How often do we wait before God’s mercy and grace before we accept our supernatural provision? How long do we labor on our own or in the hopes of another human being who will meet our needs when only Jesus can heal us? How often do believe legends or do what everyone else is doing instead of having an encounter with Jesus?\nThere will be those who will correct you for not getting your miracle the right way. As the man was leaving Bethesda, the Jewish leaders stopped him. They said, “It is the Sabbath, and the law forbids you to carry your mat.” The man replied, “The man who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’ The Jews wanted to know the name of the person who was breaking their laws. The healed man did not know it was Jesus for according to John 5:11, Jesus had quietly slipped into the crowd after the miracle.\nThere is so much insight into God’s mercy and grace as opposed to the bondage of the law in this passage. I encourage you to take a few moments and meditate on John 5:1-15. Pray and surrender anything you have been trying to “make happen” on your own. Repent of expecting others to meet your needs and come face to face with the miracle worker. He’s ready to heal you!",

    "text": "Ormai è sulla bocca di tutti. La cometa ha superato brillantemente la vicinanza al sole il 27 settembre scorso, ovvero non si è disintegrata e sabato 12 ottobre ha raggiunto il punto più vicino alla Terra e brilla ormai come il pianeta Giove, quindi è visibile ad occhio nudo. La si può osservare subito dopo il tramonto, esattamente poco sopra a sinistra del punto esatto nel quale calerà il sole. La cometa mostrerà inoltre una bellissima e lunghissima coda (lunga quasi 30 milioni di chilometri), grossomodo perpendicolare all'orizzonte. Non resta che trovare un posto dove non ci saranno ostacoli per vedere l'orizzonte, aspettare il tramonto del sole, magari munirsi anche di un binocolo per vedere i dettagli di questo spettacolare e affascinate oggetto celeste. Ma non è finita qui. Se la cometa Atlas potrà essere osservata fino al 24 ottobre (con una luminosità via via minore), a fine mese potrebbe arrivare un'altra cometa, ancora più luminosa (forse anche di giorno!), scoperta poco tempo fa. Vi terremo aggiornati. Ma non ci sarà solo la cometa da vedere in questo stellare mese di Ottobre, infatti ci sarà la superluna più grande dell'anno e alcune congiunzioni degne di essere viste. LA SUPERLUNA PIU' GRANDE DELL'ANNO La luna piena di Ottobre (Giovedì 17) sarà la superluna più grande dell'anno perché si verificherà esattamente lo stesso giorno in cui si troverà nel punto più vicino alla Terra (il perigeo). In questa occasione il nostro satellite naturale (l'unico) lo si potrà vedere più grande di circa il 15-16% e più luminoso di circa il 7-8%. LE CONGIUNZIONI Si parla di congiunzione quando due oggetti celesti, apparentemente, si trovano vicini tra loro. In Ottobre ci saranno alcune congiunzioni che vale la pena vedere. La prima è avvenuta Sabato 5 Ottobre verso le 19.30 quando Luna e Venere si sono trovati vicini tra loro sul cielo occidentale. Lunedì 14 Ottobre sarà la volta di Luna e Saturno a trovarsi vicinissimi, sempre sul cielo occidentale dalle 19.30. Infine, Domenica 20 e Giovedì 24 Ottobre avremo la Luna che \"incontrerà\" dapprima Giove e poi Marte.",

    "text": "Reuters\nFILE PHOTO: A general view of the Sakai Seisakusyo factory in Kakamigahara, central Japan, July 8, 2024. REUTERS/Anton Bridge/File Photo\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory activity contracted for the fifth straight month in November due to sluggish demand caused by worries over China's economic slowdown and persistent cost pressures, a private-sector survey showed on Friday.\nThe au Jibun Bank flash Japan manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) slipped slightly to 49.0 in November from 49.2 in October.\nThe index stayed below the 50.0 threshold separating growth from contraction for a fifth straight month.\n\"Demand conditions at private sector companies were stagnant during November,\" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, which compiled the survey.\nThe subindex for output contracted for the third straight month in November and that of new orders also shrank for the month, staying below the 50.0 threshold since June last year. Manufacturers also reduced employment for the first time since February, the survey found.\nInput inflation remained high in November though price growth slowed to a seven-month low, while the rate of output prices grew to the strongest since July.\n\"Price pressures remained elevated across the Japanese sector, with a large number of respondents mentioning higher raw material prices and the weakness of the yen,\" said Bhatti.\nThe au Jibun Bank flash services PMI grew to 50.2 in November, reversing its slight contraction of 49.7 in October.\nOutstanding business grew at the fastest pace in eight months, signalling pressure on capacity.\nThe au Jibun Bank flash Japan composite PMI, which combines both manufacturing and service sector activity, was 49.8 in November, the second straight month of contraction but modestly up from 49.6 in October.\nA Reuters' survey earlier this month found Japanese manufacturers were less confident about business conditions in November than in October, as China's economic slowdown and higher costs dented sentiment.\nJapan's economic growth slowed in July-September from the previous quarter due to tepid capital spending though a pickup in consumption added a bright spot.\n(Reporting by Kaori Kaneko; Editing by Sam Holmes)\nSponsored Bank Accounts\nCopyright 2024 Thomson Reuters .\nTags: Asia , Japan",

    "title": "Colorado Red Lobster restaurant finds rare orange lobster in shipment, takes it to Denver aquarium",
    "text": "The Downtown Aquarium in Denver has a new resident — a rare orange lobster that was rescued from a shipment of crustaceans delivered to a Red Lobster restaurant in Pueblo, Colorado. A long-term employee who is a dishwasher and head biscuit maker spotted the bright orange lobster while unpacking a shipment last Friday and alerted restaurant managers, aquarium officials said. The staff named it Crush after the Denver Broncos' legendary Orange Crush defense from 1976 to 1986. Recommended Videos “Myself and many of my team are born and raised Denver Broncos fans, so as soon as we saw that orange color, we knew that Crush would be an excellent representation,” said Kendra Kastendieck, the restaurant's general manager. “And we all want our defensive line to be that good again.\" When the Pueblo Zoo couldn't take Crush, Kastendieck called the Downtown Aquarium, which she said was interested right away. Kastendieck packed Crush with ice packs in a plastic foam container and delivered it to the aquarium on Wednesday. “As soon as they acclimated him to his quarantine tank at the Denver aquarium, he was very active right off the bat and was really exploring his little area,” Kastendieck said Thursday. Staff had set up a tank with a new generation Denver Broncos helmet on top and an older generation one sitting in the tank “so he can actually climb into it and play around it,” she said. Crush will be examined by a veterinarian and after 30 days in quarantine will be placed in the “Lurks” exhibit that houses other cold water North Atlantic Ocean species, aquarium staff said. “We are thrilled to be able to share this very rare and extraordinary animal with the community and visitors to Colorado,” Ryan Herman, general curator at Denver Downtown Aquarium, said in a statement. Crush was shipped to the Pueblo restaurant from a supplier in Tennessee. It was caught off a coast of Canada, said Kastendieck, but she was unable to confirm which coast. Genetic mutations can lead to lobsters that are orange, blue and yellow. Downtown Aquarium has had one orange lobster previously. The Downtown Aquarium has more than 700 species of fish along with a stingray reef and three Sumatran tigers. ___ Hanson reported from Helena, Montana.",
