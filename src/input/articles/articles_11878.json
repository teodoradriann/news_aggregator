The coastlines were inundated with water earlier in the day as huge waves pushed debris onto the land, but more widespread flooding was so far avoided.\nSanta Cruz’s East Cliff Drive, which was blocked earlier in the day by a log, is now “open and passable,” aaccording to a county\npost.\nDec. 28, 11:40 a.m. Waves flooded the Santa Cruz County coastline Thursday morning, closing sections of East Cliff Drive and blocking off the Rio Del Mar esplanade. Residents along the coast from Las Olas Drive to just past Hidden Beach County Park were being told to prepare for\npossible evacuations.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n“The area of Rio Del Mar typically sees flooding whenever we get some sort of substantial rainfall,” said Ashley Keehn, the public information officer for the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office. “That’s what we started seeing this morning around 7 o’clock, with that high tide and rain coming in.”\nEvacuation warnings were also in effect for Capitola’s beachfront area and for Pajaro Dunes, near Watsonville. In the city of Santa Cruz, officials closed the Santa Cruz Wharf, Main Beach, Cowell Beach and a half-mile stretch of West Cliff Drive.\nVideos and images shared by the sheriff’s office and the California Highway Patrol showed mounds of driftwood pushed onto the Rio Del Mar esplanade and waves hammering the old\ncement ship by Seacliff State Beach’s Aptos Pier.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nThe water, logs and debris on the roadway prompted the road closures, CHP spokesperson Israel Murillo told SFGATE. In a\nhttps://x.com/CHPscrz/status/1740429676911489042?s=20 on X, CHP said residents should, “exercise extreme caution near the ocean.”\nMultiple rounds of rainfall, powerful winds and the full moon’s gravitational pull are contributing to the surges of seawater,\nSFGATE reported Tuesday. The National Weather Service’s Bay Area office warned of deadly conditions, and wrote in a high surf warning for Thursday, “Never turn your back to the ocean!” Further up the coast from Santa Cruz, evacuations were in effect around Stinson Beach.

    "title": "張姮燕觀點：台灣飯店業的「缺」世代，誰來救場？-風傳媒",
    "text": "因為少子化及人口老化造成勞動力減少等原因，已造成台灣各行各業大缺工，飯店業更因薪資成長緩慢、工時長，正面臨嚴重的人力短缺問題，這不僅影響了服務品質，也限制了行業的發展。隨著教育水平的提高，年輕人普遍追求高薪、高技術的工作，對勞力密集且收入相對較低的服務業缺乏興趣，也使得飯店業的基層職位難以招到足夠的人才。近年來，為解決飯店人力荒，政府和業者嘗試吸引「壯世代」重返職場，並聘用東南亞實習生及取得學位之僑外生作為解決方案，但這些措施或許能暫時緩解「沒有人」的問題，但反而引發「服務品質」的挑戰。\n短期的人力救急，長期的品質隱憂\n飯店業是服務業的核心，顧客體驗至關重要，語言不通或文化差異導致的誤解，容易引發客訴，進而影響飯店的聲譽和營運。壯世代和僑外生並不足以解決飯店業的人力短缺問題，因為國際觀光飯店人力短缺的挑戰，不只是缺人，更是缺「質」。這幾年來越來越晚的入住（check－in）時間、越來越早的退房（check－out）、常常無人應答的總機或櫃檯（front desk），以及因語言隔閡無法準確理解顧客需求的外場服務人員，都是短期人力補充無法彌補的長期損失。在我國星級旅館評鑑基準表中，飯店總機服務是否在鈴響三聲內接聽電話是評分標準之一，但在目前飯店業的缺世代中，常見顧客笑稱國際觀光飯店總機或櫃檯響到電話線燒掉仍無人接聽都已司空見慣。這不僅凸顯人力短缺的嚴重性，更反映出服務基礎設施的脆弱。當國際觀光飯店連基本的電話服務都無法保障時，顧客的信任與滿意度必然下滑，這對仰賴口碑的觀光業來說，無疑是一大傷害。\n壯世代與僑外生的限制\n政府鼓勵中老年人回歸職場，特別是飯店業的房務和餐飲外場服務，試圖以「壯世代」來填補人力缺口。然而，飯店業的工作性質往往需要長時間站立、搬運重物等體力勞動，對於年紀較大的工作者來說，體力和耐力都是一大挑戰。許多中老年人雖然有豐富的經驗，但遇上高勞動力的工作環境，也會導致這項政策的效果有限。同時，業者也嘗試以外籍專班、東南亞實習生、僑外生作為勞動力，近來也已引起「以教育為名將學生置於剝削性的勞動條件中」的憂慮。暫且不論犧牲台灣教育名聲並變成「學工之島」的嚴重後果，因僑外生在語言能力和文化適應上存在明顯障礙，一旦難以提供符合國際標準的服務品質，犧牲的更是台灣觀光飯店業者好不容易建立的服務品質。僑外生不諳中文，若英文流利還可在外籍旅客較多的旅館及餐廳提供服務應急，但要期待本國籍顧客連到餐廳用餐、到飯店住宿，都要練習英文，恐怕也非國人短期能接受的服務樣貌。",

    "text": "The Tanaiste said the targeting of Palestinians in the West Bank was ‘shocking’ and has to stop now. Sanctions against extremist Israeli settlers guilty of targeting Palestinians in the West Bank should go further than travel bans if the violence persists, the Tanaiste has said. The US and UK have already announced that they will ban such extremist settlers from entering their countries while EU leaders are set to consider similar proposals. It comes after an upsurge in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Palestinians living in the area have accused Jewish settlers of using the Israel/Hamas conflict in Gaza as a pretence to seize more land and engage in violence in the West Bank. At his end of year media briefing, Micheal Martin was asked whether sanctions should go further than visa bans and whether Israel should be forced to pay for the damage committed by settlers. “We are part of the West Bank consortium (group of EU states and the UK) which is endeavouring to put pressure on Israel to pay for damage to any EU funded infrastructure and most recently there was a school that was funded by Irish Aid that was very badly damaged by Israeli forces,” he said. “We believe what’s happening in the West Bank is shocking, it’s in violation of UN resolutions and in violation of international humanitarian law and we’ve made it clear consistently at UN and other levels that this has to stop now. “Yes, I think sanctions should go beyond travel bans if this persists. Israel is saying it’s a small minority but the evidence is that the action of settlers has been backed up by the IDF on the ground with Palestinians being attacked and various communities being displaced. “The issue fundamentally is if we are to have any chance of a contiguous Palestinian state the action of the settlers has to stop, particularly with the far right, very religious fundamentalist settlers who almost believe that the biblical reality is this is all of their land and they can displace anybody in their way, that has to stop and the Israeli government has a responsibility to stop that.”",
