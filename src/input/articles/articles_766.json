    "text": "Wisconsin's job market finishes the year on a strong note with record high number of people working [Ricardo Torres](https://www.jsonline.com/staff/4488660002/ricardo-torres/) Wisconsin’s economy ended 2023 in good shape with businesses hiring workers and the state’s unemployment rate at 3.3%, lower than the national average of 3.7%. Jobs and employment data is still being gathered for December. However officials with the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development said that in November the state had more than 3 million people working, which is a new high for the state, and in the month 1,700 employees were added to the workforce. In 2023, roughly 32,300 workers entered the workforce in Wisconsin. The biggest problem with the economy has been there aren’t enough bodies to fill the openings. “As the Baby Boomers age out, we find that we need more and more workers just in general,” said Scott Hodek, Section Chief for DWD's Office of Economic Advisors, “This is the big piece that we’re seeing influence the workforce and the economy into the next decades.” More: [These 6 companies laid people off in November in Wisconsin](/story/money/business/2023/12/01/these-6-companies-laid-people-off-in-november-2023-in-wisconsin/71679124007/) Hodek made his comments during the department’s virtual economic briefing in December. “Students, right now graduating, have a great job market,” Hodek said. “We saw we’re getting more people into the labor force, and that’s good, but we need more.” And while the job market is in workers favor, there might be some signs of hiring slowing down. According to the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association and Commerce's most recent data from October, Milwaukee metro area employment averaged 862,000, a 0.3% increase from one year ago. “A weakened overall employment trend, as well as negative manufacturing and unemployment indicators, suggest a sluggish metro area economy,” Bret Mayborne, MMAC vice president of economic research, said in the monthly report. “On the positive side, local housing and real estate indicators may be on the mend after registering declines for the better part of two years.” There are still some workers who received bad news this year. In December only one employer filed a WARN notice with the state: Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc., based in Brookfield, informed 17 remote workers that they would be laid off beginning Feb. 16. In 2023, 6,727 workers learned they would need to find a new job, which is up from 5,563 a year ago, and up from 2,888 in 2021. But that annual number is a fraction of the 39,756 workers that were laid off in 2020.",

    "text": "Today, Canadians and sailors from coast to coast to coast commemorated the 79th anniversary of the end of action in the Battle of the Atlantic and the sacrifices of the thousands of Canadians who fought valiantly from 1939 to 1945 during the longest campaign of the Second World War. Each year on the first Sunday in May, sailors from Canadian Forces Bases Halifax in Nova Scotia and Esquimalt in British Columbia, and the 24 Naval Reserve Divisions across Canada commemorate the sailors, merchant sailors, and aviators who perished at sea during the Battle of the Atlantic. Fought largely by reservists in small ships built in Canada and operating from Canadian bases, the task of defending North Atlantic trade routes against indiscriminate submarine attacks, defined a naval role for Canada within a much larger alliance. After 1945, the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) became one of the best anti-submarine warfare navies in the world due, in part, to maritime aviation capabilities.

    "title": "Explainer-Why was Harvey Weinstein’s rape conviction overturned, and what’s next?",
    "text": "By Brendan Pierson\n(Reuters) – Thursday’s ruling overturning Harvey Weinstein’s New York rape conviction gives the one-time film mogul a chance at a new trial and calls into question what evidence prosecutors can use in future sex crime cases.\nHere is a look at what happened to the case, which helped define the #MeToo movement, and what might happen next.\nWHY WAS WEINSTEIN’S CONVICTION OVERTURNED?\nWeinstein, 72, was found guilty of raping one woman and sexually assaulting another after both testified in court.\nBut a 4-3 majority of the New York Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, found that the trial judge should not have permitted three other women to testify that Weinstein had assaulted them as well because their allegations were not part of the criminal charges against him.\nSuch testimony about “prior bad acts” is usually barred by New York’s so-called Molineux rule, named for a landmark 1901 court case. The majority of the court found that the testimony by the three women ran afoul of the rule and made the trial unfair.\nWHY WERE THE OTHER WOMEN ALLOWED TO TESTIFY IN THE FIRST PLACE?\nThe Molineux rule is not absolute. It holds that prosecutors cannot use such testimony to prove that the defendant has a “propensity” to commit crime, but they may use it as evidence of motive or intent.\nIn Weinstein’s case, prosecutors persuaded the trial judge that the producer’s alleged prior sexual assaults showed that he knew his accusers did not consent to his advances, but that he intended to force them into sex anyway.\nProsecutors believed the evidence would help disprove Weinstein’s assertion that the encounters were consensual.\nThe Court of Appeals, however, found that the testimony was simply evidence that he had a propensity to commit rape and sexual assault, not of his motive or intent.\nWHAT DOES THE RULING MEAN FOR WEINSTEIN’S CALIFORNIA CASE?\nWeinstein was sentenced to 16 years in prison following a separate 2022 rape conviction in California, which he is expected to appeal, and the New York ruling has no direct effect on that case.\nIn fact, California law specifically allows testimony about prior bad acts in sex crime cases as evidence that a defendant has a propensity to commit sex crimes. Such evidence was used in Weinstein’s California trial, and the state’s law will make it harder for his lawyers to challenge on appeal than in New York.\nWHAT DOES THE RULING MEAN FOR FUTURE CASES IN NEW YORK?\nAccording to the majority of the court, very little. Judge Jenny Rivera wrote in the majority opinion that the decision was based on well-established New York law, and said it was similar to another 1996 Court of Appeals decision, People v. Vargas, vacating a rape conviction because witnesses were allowed to testify about earlier alleged rapes by the defendant.\nDissenting judges in Thursday’s decision said the ruling would make it more difficult to prosecute sex crimes committed by people who know their victims and may have ongoing relationships with them, as in Weinstein’s case.\nJudge Anthony Cannataro, who was among the dissenters, called it “an unfortunate step backwards from recent advances in our understanding of how sex crimes are perpetrated.”\nAnother dissenting judge, Madeline Singas, said the decision would effectively end the use of prior bad acts witnesses in such cases and make it difficult to prove intent.\n(Reporting By Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Howard Goller)",
