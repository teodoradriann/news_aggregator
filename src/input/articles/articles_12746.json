    "text": "Government cuts to public services are forcing Stats NZ to reduce staff numbers further - putting at risk the agency's ability to deliver vital data businesses and communities need. Stats NZ today told staff that is proposing to disestablish 45 roles and create 31.5 new roles for a net reduction of 13.5 roles, said Kerry Davies Public Service Association Te Pūkenga Here Tikanga Mahi National Secretary. Today's proposal follows a restructure in December which saw 29 jobs go, and in May Stats NZ called for voluntary redundancies, which will see more than 80 people leave the organisation, Davies said. \"This means Stats NZ is at risk of losing more than 110 staff in the six months since December. This is a significant cut for the agency that provides the essential information the country needs to plan for its future requirements in areas like health care and education, and to support businesses. \"Today's announcement on top of the job losses already in train reinforces our concerns that the constant rounds of cuts required by the Government will impact the ability of Stats NZ to deliver the quality collection and analysis of data that businesses and communities depend on,\" Davies said. Roles affected by the change proposal announced include design and collection analysts, data technicians and quality assurance specialists. \"Stats NZ data is vital to supporting businesses. With its narrow focus on cost cutting, the Government is putting at risk New Zealand's ability to build and grow a modern economy by reducing Stats NZ's ability to gather and analyse the data businesses need to make smarter decisions. \"We are also worried the proposed changes will pile greater workloads on fewer staff,\" Davies says.

    "text": "Shannen Doherty is selling some of her possessions as she continues her cancer battle (Gray News) - [Shannen Doherty](https://www.instagram.com/theshando/?hl=en) says she’s letting some things go as she continues to battle breast cancer. The 52-year-old actress shared in a recent episode of her podcast [“Let’s Be Clear with Shannen Doherty,”](https://www.youtube.com/@LetsBeClearSD) that her priorities have changed because of her illness. “The cancer, for me, has really made me take stock of my life and shift my priorities, and my priority at the moment is my mom,” [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/02/entertainment/shannen-doherty-decluttering-cancer/index.html) quoted Doherty. “I don’t want her to have a bunch of stuff to deal with. I don’t want her to have four storage units filled with furniture.” Doherty continued by saying her “furniture obsession” is just one of her passions but that everyone, including her, can do a little bit of downsizing. “Do I need to have three dining room tables? The answer is no, none of us really need all the stuff that we have, and we could all do with a little bit of downsizing and not be a hoarder, which I was becoming with all my furniture,” Doherty is quoted in the [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2024/04/02/entertainment/cancer-stricken-shannen-doherty-prepares-for-death-by-selling-items/). The [“Beverly Hills 90210″](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098749/) star also shared that letting things go hasn’t been easy, but she has been using the money she’s getting from selling items to do things like take trips with her mother and making memories. Doherty was initially diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015 before going into remission two years later. In 2020, Doherty announced that the cancer had returned and in late 2023 said that [the illness had spread](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/07/entertainment/shannen-doherty-cancer/index.html) to her bones.

    "text": "Govt to hold recruitment for group C vacancies in state\nBhubaneswar: The state govt will soon initiate the recruitment process for 22,896 Group-C posts lying vacant across 10 key departments, according to official sources.\nAs per govt rules, any recruitment for Group-C posts requires approval from an empowered committee before requisitions can be sent to recruiting agencies. In a letter to the principal secretary of the finance department, chief secretary Manoj Ahuja urged the department to convene a meeting of the empowered committee and clear the 22,896 vacancies for direct recruitment by August 31.\nWhile the govt has not yet fixed an exact recruitment timeline, sources indicated that appointments are likely to be made by the end of this year.\nMeanwhile, opposition parties have raised concerns. BJD MLA Dhruba Charan Sahoo said, \"Govt cannot recruit staff on time, which affects its functioning. The state secretariat is also facing the same issue.\" Congress MLA Ashok Kumar Das said there is no systematic effort by the govt to recruit people. \"What's the problem in filling up vacant posts?\" he added.\nResponding to the criticism, Law Minister Prithiviraj Harichandan said, \"Recruitment begins once departments report vacancies to the concerned agencies. This process takes time\"\nEarlier, chief minister Mohan Charan Majhi had underlined the need for a flawless, impartial, and speedy recruitment process, especially in departments providing essential services such as health, home, school and mass education, higher education, and agriculture.",
