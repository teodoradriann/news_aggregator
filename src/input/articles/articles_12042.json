    "text": "NY weather: Winter weather advisory issued for Orleans and Monroe counties until Sunday evening Published: Jan. 03, 2025, 3:39 a.m. By Advance Local Weather Alerts On Friday at 3:33 a.m. the National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory valid from 2 p.m. until Sunday 6 p.m. for Orleans and Monroe counties.\nThe weather service comments, \"Total snow accumulations 6 to 12 inches in the most persistent lake snows, spread out in several batches over the next few days. Winds gusting as high as 30 mph today through tonight, and 40 mph Saturday through Saturday night, will produce areas of blowing and drifting snow.\"\n\"Travel will be difficult at times with snow covered roads. Areas of blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions will impact the Friday evening commute,\" describes the weather service. \"Lake effect snow will fall in relatively narrow bands. If traveling, be prepared for rapidly changing road conditions and visibilities. During lake effect snow, the weather can vary from bands of locally heavy snow with greatly reduced visibilities to dry conditions just a few miles away. Be prepared for rapid changes in weather, visibility, and road conditions.\"\nWinter driving guide: Tips from the weather service for safe and sound travels Winter weather can make driving treacherous, leading to over 6,000 weather-related vehicle fatalities and over 480,000 injuries each year. When traveling during snow or freezing rain, prioritize safety by slowing down. In near-freezing temperatures, it's safest to assume that icy conditions exist on roadways and adjust your driving accordingly. Be cautious of ice accumulating on power lines or tree branches, which can lead to snapping and falling hazards. If possible, avoid driving in such conditions. If you must venture out, opt for routes with fewer trees and power lines. Never touch a downed power line, and immediately dial 911 if you come across one. Here are additional winter driving tips from the weather service:\nShare your travel plans:\nWhen traveling out of town in hazardous winter weather, inform your family or friends of your destination, planned route, and estimated time of arrival.\nPrepare your vehicle:\nEnsure your gas tank is full and equip your vehicle with essential winter supplies such as a windshield scraper, jumper cables, a small shovel, flashlight, cell phone, blanket, extra warm clothing, drinking water, and high-calorie non-perishable food.\nStay calm when stranded:\nIf you become stranded, remain composed. Inform someone about your situation and location. Avoid attempting to walk to safety. Indicate that you need assistance by attaching a cloth to your car's antenna or mirror, and make your vehicle more visible by using the dome light and flashers\nBe aware of snow plows:\nKeep an eye out for snow plows and provide them with ample room to pass. Only overtake a plow when you have a clear view of the road ahead.\nCheck road conditions:\nBefore embarking on your journey, check the latest road conditions to make informed travel decisions.\nThese winter driving tips from the weather service are your key to a safer journey on snow-covered roads. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and ensure your well-being during challenging winter weather.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

    "text": "Agencies\nNew Delhi\nFund manager Abhay Agarwal was surprised by the number of calls he took this month from international investors showing more than a passing curiosity about India.\n“These are from family offices in Europe or some large investors in US who have ...never bothered about investing in India,” said Agarwal, founder of Mumbai-based Piper Serica Advisors.\n“For the first time, I find them to be very serious and they’re calling and asking questions such as, ‘Look, will my money be safe? And is there a rule of law here?’” he added.\nThe interest comes at a time when the country’s stock market is hitting record highs — the market value of companies listed on India’s exchanges crossed $4 trillion in late November, according to Refinitiv.\nIndia has two major exchanges: the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and the BSE, Asia’s oldest bourse formerly known as the Bombay Stock Exchange.\nThe sizzling rally means that the NSE, which is larger than the BSE by daily transaction value, has now taken Hong Kong’s place as the seventh-largest bourse, data from the World Federation of Exchanges showed.\nThe ascent of India’s stock market value means it ranks behind only those in the United States, China and Japan, according to Refinitiv.\n“People are getting excited about India,” said Agarwal, adding that the investors calling him up want to know if it can deliver “the same kind of returns that China delivered in the first decade of 2000.”\nIn his three-decade-long investing career, Agarwal says he has seen high levels of bullishness over India from the global community in the past, but that was mainly from short-term investors.\n“For the first time, I’m seeing interest from very long-term investors, both strategic and financial, who are coming in taking a 10-year view rather than just a one-year view,” he said.\nIndia’s benchmark Sensex index, which tracks 30 large companies, has climbed over 16% this year, while the broader Nifty 50 index has jumped over 17 percent in that time.\nIndia’s exchanges are also witnessing a boom in Initial public offerings (IPOs). The country saw 150 listings in the first nine months of 2023, according to a report by Ernst & Young. Hong Kong had 42.\nThe surge in India’s stocks is a reflection of the strength and potential of the world’s fastest growing major economy, analysts said.\nThe International Monetary Fund expects India to grow by 6.3 percent this year, but some economists say the expansion could be closer to 7 percent.\nThe world’s fifth largest economy grew by 7.6 percent in the quarter to Sept. 30, a much faster pace than estimated by the country’s central bank. That surprise prompted both Citigroup and Barclays to raise their annual GDP projections for India to 6.7 percent.\nThe positive sentiment towards India contrasts sharply with the mood hanging over its larger neighbor, China. Investor worries over weak consumer demand and the protracted real estate crisis in the world second largest economy have taken a heavy toll on its markets.\nChina’s Shanghai Composite is down 7 percent this year while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index has plunged nearly 19 percent.\n“The performance of Chinese equities in the past 10 months has seen a stark contrast between an optimistic start to the year and a disappointing second half,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, referring to the bump up markets enjoyed when China had abandoned its strict pandemic-related restrictions.\n“The divergent growth between India and China is the key in the battle for emerging market (money) flow,” he said.\nWhile China’s economic problems could put downward pressure on the growth outlook for many countries in Asia, analysts say India will remain resilient.\n“The Indian economy has the least economic linkage to China’s end demand ...Moreover, Indian equities exhibit the lowest price sensitivity to slowing China growth in the region,” Goldman Sachs said in a November report.\nThe world’s most populous country is also less sensitive to other global economic risks, partly because domestic institutional and retail investors are becoming increasingly influential in India.\n“We think domestic flows will continue to support the market and limit any large downside risk in case of global risks,” Goldman Sachsadded.\nIn a December note, Nomura also said India is “less exposed to (a) global trade slowdown,” and could be a “counter-weight to North Asia if (a) slowdown in the West occurs and China continues to disappoint onrecovery.”\nThe country is “home to a number of high quality ... stocks albeit expensive,” Nomura said, adding that India is also likely to benefit from companies diversifying their supply chains away from China.\nSince last year, Apple has expanded production significantly in India after suffering supply chain snags in mainland China.\nThe South Asian nation has also become the “most promising medium-term business destination” for Japanese manufacturers, according to a recent survey by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.\nChina was pushed to second spot because of its economic slowdown and rising tensions between Washington and Beijing.\nDespite the country’s recent economic swagger, foreign investors may stay away from India in the first half of 2024, when the country gears up for a general election, which is expected to be held in April and May.\n“In the near-term, while election-related uncertainty and the tough global macro environment could keep foreign flows weak over the next 3-6 months, we expect foreign flows to pick up after the election uncertainty fades,” Goldman Sachs noted.\nMarket watchers are hoping that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party wins, ensuring political stability.\nThere is a strong chance of that happening. In the years since becoming prime minister in 2014, Modi has grown only more powerful and popular, while his opponents have been pushed further to the side.\nBut not every economist is as sanguine about India’s prospects and some say that a slowdown is coming.\n“Private consumption has remained strong so far,” wrote Alexandra Hermann of Oxford Economics earlier this month. “But with some of it being debt-fueled and the labor market in distress, this year’s spending may come back to haunt consumers next year.”\nThe public sector may not be able to offset this slowdown, as government debt levels remain high, she added: “To maintain investor confidence ... the government will need to exert fiscal prudence.”\nCritics also say the stock market’s current buoyancy is not the most reliable yardstick to gauge India’s economy, which is struggling to create suitable jobs for its vast working-age population and offer a sustainable and inclusive growth path.\n‘For a variety of reasons ... we have seen an increase in the profitability of large firms in this country, while small and informal firms are doing relatively poorly. But only the former are Quote: d on the stock market, which offers a misleading picture of the broader economy,” former central bank governor Raghuram Rajan and economist Rohit Lamba wrote in a recently-released book “Breaking the Mould.”\n“Indeed, high-employment sectors with many small firms, such as apparel and leather, have shrunk,” in the past few years, they added.\n Copy 29/12/2023 15",

    "text": "Monitoring Desk\nEast London: Pakistan U19 beat Afghanistan U19 by a whopping margin of 181 runs in their opening contest of the ICC Men’s U19 World Cup. Pakistan showcased an all-round performance, as opening batter Shahzaib Khan scored a brilliant ton to help the team post a decent total of 284-9 before the bowlers ran riot to bundle out Afghanistan 103 in 26.2 overs. Ubaid Shah and Zeeshan shared seven wickets among them.\nPakistan skipper Saad Baig won the toss and elected to bat first. The opening batters saw off the first powerplay before Shamyl Hussain (17, 32b, 2x4s) nicked one to the keeper bringing an end to the 36-run partnership in the 11th over. Ten balls later, Azan Awais (5, 5b, 1×4) too departed after being caught down the leg side off Khalil Ahmed.\nSaad (55, 52b, 3x4s, 4x6s) and Shahzaib (106, 126b, 10x4s, 3x6s) came together to stitch a 92-run partnership for the third wicket. Saad hit a flurry of boundaries to up the ante before falling to Allah Mohammad Ghazanfar.\nAhmed Hussain (8, 11b, 1×4) was dismissed by Naseer Khan Maroofkhil with the scorecard reading 151-4 in 30.1 overs. Riazullah (46, 49b, 5x4s, 2x6s), batting at number six, made sure Pakistan kept accelerating but missed out on his half-century.\nArafat Minhas (8, 6b, 1×6) tonked a six soon after walking to the crease but had to return within a space of six balls after being caught behind. Ubaid Shah (22, 12b, 3x6s) chipped in with a valuable cameo and helped Pakistan reach 284-9 in the allotted 50 overs.\nKhalil was the pick of Afghan bowlers as he took four wickets for 51 runs while Bashir Ahmad picked up two wickets. Ghazanfar and Naseer bagged one wicket each.\nAfghanistan’s reply was jolted by two early blows courtesy of opening bowlers Amir Hassan and Ubaid who struck in their first overs respectively. Hassan Eisakhil (19, 29b, 4x4s) and Sohail Khan Zurmati (20, 26b, 2x4s) hung around for eight overs before the former chopped on a ball from Ubaid. All-rounder Ahmad Hussain pitched one up and managed to breach the defence of Sohail as the ball crashed into stumps.\nAfghanistan kept losing wickets at regular intervals as tall fast bowler Mohammad Zeeshan struck twice in his first spell to remove wicketkeeper-batter Numan Shah (26, 31b, 2x4s, 1×6) and skipper Naseer for a seven-ball duck. Ubaid returned to dismiss Arab Gul (2, 11b). Zeeshan bagged his third wicket in the game as he took out Rahimullah Zurmati (20, 32b, 3x4s).\nAfghanistan lost their last five wickets for a mere 12 runs as they were bundled out for a paltry total of 103 runs.

    "text": "Este miércoles 19 de febrero ha fallecido en Bolivia Nicolás Castellanos Francos, obispo emérito de Palencia. Una noticia que han vivido «con dolor» en la diócesis palentina, tal y como han asegurado en un comunicado . «Como familia diocesana nos unimos en la oración por su pérdida y a la eseranza de la resurrección», han añadido.\nEl funeral por su eterno descanso se celerará el próximo martes 25 de febrero, a las 19.00 horas en la catedral de Palencia. Sin embargo, su cuerpo será enterrado en Bolivia «por expreso deseo de monseñor Castellanos», ha indicado la Conferencia Episcopal en la nota en la que ha comunicado la muerte del prelado.\nObispo y misionero\nNacido el 18 de febrero de 1935 en Mansilla del Páramo, provincia de León, ingresó aún adolescente en la Orden de San Agustín . Realizó sus primeros votos en Palencia el 10 de septiembre de 1953. Tras realizar sus estudios eclesiásticos en el monasterio burgalés de Santa María de la Vid, fue ordenado sacerdote el 12 de julio de 1959.

    "text": "Embassy of Japan, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary His Excellency\n2024-09-27: Dear Sir,\nThis week I explained the \"outline\" of the \"special zone\". It's \"wonderful\". Both \"il-legal immigrants\" and \"Americans\" can be \"happy\". The \"special zone\" I propose is not a \"policy\" that \"views\" China as an enemy.\n\"Western countries\" and others have a \"weaker\" economy than \"China\", so \"they\" have no choice but to \"go to war\" with China and \"reset their economy\". That's why I'm proposing it.\nI think that in order to avoid a \"war\" between \"Western countries and China\", it is \"urgent\" to build a \"special zone\" in \"those countries\". If \"they\" could become \"equal\" in the \"economic competition\" with China, I think there would be no \"war\".\nJapanese people hate war. In Japan, \"damages\" for \"fires, etc.\" are \"compensated\" for by the \"property insurance system\". However, there is no \"war insurance\" that \"compensates\" for \"damages\" caused by \"war\". Japanese people hate losing prop-erty.\nTrump is a wealthy man in the real estate business. If a nuclear war were to break out in America, Trump's real estate would be destroyed and he would be left penni-less. That's why he has pledged to end the Ukraine war.\nAmericans who don't own real estate seem to support the Ukraine war. This is be-cause they don't have any real estate to lose even if there is a nuclear war with Russia.\nI think human life is more important than real estate. War is murder. If I thought I would die, I would be against the war. Didn't black people also say that black lives matter?\nI think the people who support the Ukraine war are people who don't own property. People who own property are against the war because they will lose their property. People without property should move to the special zone.\n\"Temporary immigrants\" cannot leave the \"Special Zone\" and go to \"regular Ameri-can cities\". However, it is possible for Americans to live in the \"Special Zone\".\nThe \"middle class\" of America does not have the \"funds\" to \"purchase housing\" in big cities such as \"New York City\", but in the \"Special Zone\", even the \"middle class\" can \"purchase\" a \"home\".\nIn \"New York City\", \"low-income\" Americans have \"hard\" conditions to \"obtain\" a \"job\", but in the \"Special Zone\", they can \"easily\" choose a job. And they will be \"satisfied\" with the \"wages\".\n\"Starting a business\" in America requires \"big capital\". In the Special Zone, you can do business with \"small capital\". There are \"bigger dreams\" here than in \"Western development\".\nIn the \"Special Zone\", Americans can \"challenge\" with a \"pioneer spirit\". It's like \"Western development\". Young people are full of dreams. Trump should \"talk\" about the \"American Dream\" to Americans.\nIf Americans dream of the \"American Dream\", they can't \"wage war\". Americans don't have to like Russians, Chinese, or Arabs.\nHowever, if we don't go to war with them, we can achieve the American Dream. Let's build a special zone.\nIn a CNN poll after the debate, 63% of votes went to Harris, while 37% went to Trump. Trump should \"declare\" the construction of a special zone on the Mexican border on immigration and economic policy, and \"win.\" He should talk about the American Dream. !\nPart 1 Citations/References\nThe \"special zone\" will \"accept\" refugees and immigrants as \"temporary immigrant\" workers, with residence limited to the \"special zone.\" Developed countries will use them as low-wage workers to grow their economies, and refugees and immigrants will get jobs and live a life of human hope.\nNo2：\nNo1：\nThe \"special zone\" will \"accept\" refugees and immigrants as \"temporary immigrant\" workers, with residence limited to the \"special zone.\" Developed countries will use them as low-wage workers to grow their economies, and refugees and immigrants will get jobs and live a life of human hope.\nNo2：\nhttps://world-special-zone.seesaa.net/No1：\nhttps://naganoopinion.blog.jp/I'll write again tomorrow.\nPart 2. Japan is a \"state of abnormal human rights violations\". \"Everyone\" of the \"international community\", please help!\nFirst of all, please read \"false accusation\" in the 2010 \"Crime of Supporting Violation of Immigration Law\".\nReason for punishment:\nA Chinese national obtained a \"residence status\" by submitting a \"false employment contract.\" And they committed immigration law violations (activities outside of their qualifications).\nBecause \"we\" provided \"false employment contract documents\" to the Chinese, the Chinese were able to obtain \"residence status.\"\nThe Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan because they obtained a \"status of residence\".\nBecause the Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan, they were able to \"work illegally.\"\nTherefore, ``we'' who ``provided'' the Chinese with ``false employment contract documents'' were punished as ``helping'' the Chinese ``activities outside the scope of their status of residence''.\nThis is an arbitrary \"error of applicable law\". This is out of the \"logic of the law\".\nA Chinese national obtained a \"residence status\" by submitting a \"false employment contract.\" And they committed immigration law violations (activities outside of their qualifications).\nBecause \"we\" provided \"false employment contract documents\" to the Chinese, the Chinese were able to obtain \"residence status.\"\nThe Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan because they obtained a \"status of residence\".\nBecause the Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan, they were able to \"work illegally.\"\nTherefore, ``we'' who ``provided'' the Chinese with ``false employment contract documents'' were punished as ``helping'' the Chinese ``activities outside the scope of their status of residence''.\nThis is an arbitrary \"error of applicable law\". This is out of the \"logic of the law\".\nMy claim:\n\"1\" The Immigration Control Act stipulates that the Minister of Justice will take an \"administrative disposition\" (Immigration Control Act: Cancellation of the status of residence) for the act of submitting false documents and obtaining a status of residence.

From a report: In its report, the CMA's independent inquiry group determined that Apple's Safari browser policies prevent competing browsers from implementing certain features, such as faster webpage loading technologies. The investigation also revealed that many UK app developers would prefer to offer progressive web apps as an alternative to App Store distribution, but Apple's current iOS limitations make this impractical.\nAdding to competitive concerns, the regulator highlighted a revenue-sharing agreement between Apple and Google that \"significantly reduces their financial incentives to compete\" in the mobile browser space on iOS. The CMA also found that both companies can manipulate how users are presented with browser choices, making their own offerings appear as the clearest or easiest options.",
