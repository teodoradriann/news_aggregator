    "title": "Two men accused of plotting knife attack on synagogue in Germany",
    "text": "Stuttgart, May 24 : German authorities have detained an 18-year-old youth after he allegedly discussed carrying out a knife attack on a synagogue in the south-western German city of Heidelberg. The suspect, who comes from the town of Weinheim, is being held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, public prosecutors and criminal investigators in the south-western German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg announced on Friday. He allegedly plotted the potential attack with another 24-year-old suspect, who was shot and captured by the police earlier this month after a raid on the man's flat turned violent. \"The killing of one or more visitors during the attack on the synagogue with a subsequent martyr's death was discussed as the intended goal, in which both people wanted to be shot by emergency services,\" the authorities said. On May 3, police raided the home of the 24-year-old suspect in the town of Bad Friedrichshall on suspicion of preparing a serious act of violence endangering the state. According to police, the 24-year-old suddenly took several kitchen knives and fled outside through a window while officers were in his flat. He was caught by officers but, instead of surrendering, he threw a knife toward a policeman and charged. The officer shot the man. The 24-year-old man was treated for his injuries and remains in police custody on allegations of attempted manslaughter and a particularly serious case of assault on police officers. An analysis of evidence seized during the search revealed a link to the 18-year-old man from Weinheim, with whom the 24-year-old is said to have discussed a possible knife attack on visitors to a synagogue in Heidelberg in April 2024, according to investigators. The 18-year-old's apartment was searched on May 18. He was arrested and remains in custody. Authorities said that there are no indications of an imminent threat to visitors to the synagogue. --IANS/DPA int/as/arm",

    "text": "Texas Longhorns' Matthew Golden Sends Heartfelt 'Thank You' to Quinn Ewers\nQuinn Ewers's long-awaited decision came Wednesday as the three-year starting quarterback for the Texas Longhorns declared for the NFL Draft.\nFollowing the announcement, his teammate and leading receiver Matthew Golden penned a farewell tweet to Ewers.\n\"3 I can’t thank you enough bro,\" Golden tweeted. \"Blessed to be able to play with you\"\nIt was a second heartfelt message sent from Golden -- who also declared for the NFL Draft -- to a now former teammate of his. The first message was the two he sent to All-American safety Michael Taaffe, who announced his return for a senior season Tuesday.\nGolden transferred to Texas last offseason after spending the first two years of his college career at Houston. And despite being the first season he played with Ewers, the junior receiver thrived. The Houston, Texas, native set a career-high with 987 yards and nine touchdowns on 58 receptions while playing in all 16 games for the Longhorns.\nThe career year now has helped Golden put himself in the conversation for being one of the top receivers available in the upcoming NFL Draft. Meanwhile, Ewers will be among one of the first quarterbacks taken in a draft that also includes Cam Ward, Shedeur Sanders, Jaxson Dart and Jalen Milroe.\nIn his final season wearing the burnt orange and white, Ewers threw for 3,472 yards, 31 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. He finishes his college career with 9,128 yards and 68 touchdowns with 24 interceptions.\nThe 2025 NFL Draft will begin on Thursday, April 24 in Green Bay.\nJoin the Community:\nSubscribe to our YouTube Page HERE\nYou can follow us for future coverage by subscribing to our newsletter here.

    "text": "This handout picture released by the Israeli army on December 24, 2023 reportedly shows Israeli soldiers from the Givati Brigade operating in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip - Copyright AFP RIZA SALMAN Mai Yaghi with Claire Gounon in Bethlehem Israel pushed on Sunday with its military campaign to destroy Hamas over the October 7 attacks, as the focus of the deadly combat shifted to southern Gaza where most displaced Palestinians are trapped.\nUS President Joe Biden stressed the “critical need” to protect civilians, in a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed Israel would “continue the war until all of its goals have been achieved”, officials said.\nAs heavy fighting raged on, the Israeli army said it had struck another 200 targets in the past 24 hours in the besieged Palestinian territory where it is seeking to defeat Hamas and free remaining hostages.\nThe army said 153 troops had died in Gaza since it launched its ground invasion on October 27. Ten soldiers were lost in battles on Saturday, one of the deadliest days for the Israeli side.\n“This is a difficult morning, after a very difficult day of fighting in Gaza,” said Netanyahu. “The war is exacting a very heavy price… but we have no choice but to keep fighting.”\nThe army said soldiers had raided a northern Gaza compound near schools, a mosque and a clinic and found “explosive belts adapted for children, dozens of mortar shells, hundreds of grenades and intelligence documents”.\nHamas rejected those claims as lies meant “to justify their massacring of innocent civilians and their destructive aggression that has affected the entire infrastructure… in the already blockaded Gaza Strip”.\nThe bloodiest ever Gaza war broke out when Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7 and its Islamist militants killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\nThe gunmen also seized around 250 hostages, 129 of whom are believed to remain in Gaza following the exchange of captives for Palestinians prisoners during a week-long truce late last month.\nIsrael’s withering military campaign, including massive aerial bombardment, has killed 20,424 people, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry.\nVast areas of Gaza lie in ruins and its 2.4 million people have endured dire shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine due to an Israeli siege, alleviated only by the limited arrival of aid trucks.\nEighty percent of Gazans have been displaced, according to the UN, many now shielding against the winter cold in makeshift tents and forced into the south of Gaza even as ground fighting comes closer.\nNear the far southern Gaza city of Rafah, Umm Amir Abu al-Awf, 27, suffered wounds to her hand and legs in a strike on her house early Sunday.\n“Who won?” she said. “Nothing has been achieved except killing civilians… They keep saying Rafah is safe. It is not safe. Nowhere is safe. Every house has a martyr and injured.”\n– ‘More hatred, less peace’ –\nIsraeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus indicated that forces were close to gaining operational control in northern Gaza and that now “we focus our efforts against Hamas in southern Gaza”.\nFighting has raged in the main southern city of Khan Yunis, the birthplace of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’ leader in Gaza and the man Israel holds most responsible for the October 7 attack.\nElsewhere, Palestinian rescuers scrambled again to pull survivors and bodies from the rubble of a destroyed residential building, after a strike hit in the central city of Deir al-Balah.\n“I was praying when a huge explosion occurred,” said Yazan Moqbel, a wounded man whose sister was still under the broken concrete. “Rubble fell on us. I didn’t know what happened.”\nThe head of the UN refugee agency, Filippo Grandi, urged an end to the suffering in the third month of the war.\n“For aid to reach people in need, hostages to be released, more displacement to be avoided and above all stop the appalling loss of lives, a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza is the only way forward,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n“War defies logic and humanity, and prepares a future of more hatred and less peace.”\nOn Friday, the United States allowed the passage of a UN Security Council resolution that effectively called on Israel to allow “immediate, safe and unhindered” deliveries of life-saving aid to Gaza “at scale”.\nWorld powers had wrangled for days over the wording and, at Washington’s insistence, toned down some provisions — including removing a call for a ceasefire.\nOne displaced Gazan, Ahmad al-Burawi, now living in Rafah in southern Gaza, said: “We just want to return to our lands, that’s all. We want a solution… People are dying.”\n– Silent Christmas –\nAs the war rages on, Christians around the world celebrate Christmas Eve, and festivities are usually held in the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem where they believe Jesus was born.\nBut this year the city is almost deserted, with few worshippers around and no Christmas tree erected, after church leaders decided to forego “any unnecessarily festive” celebrations, in solidarity with Gazans.\nPalestinian president Mahmud Abbas voiced hope Christmas would mark “a cessation of the Israeli war against the Palestinian people in Gaza, as well as across the occupied Palestinian territories”.\nThe Gaza war has heightened tensions across the Middle East, where Israel faces a range of enemies — Iran-backed armed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen that have voiced strong support for Hamas.\nCross-border fire has erupted almost daily between Israel and Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah movement.\nAnd Yemen’s Huthi rebels have fired at cargo vessels in the Red Sea, leading the United States to build a naval taskforce to deter the missile and drone strikes.\nThe US military said four drones had targeted the USS Laboon, but had been shot down, and that an Indian-flagged tanker was hit and sent out a distress call.\nIran’s deputy foreign minister, Ali Bagheri, denied the Islamic republic was orchestrating the campaign, saying the Huthis act on their “own decisions and capabilities”.\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron, in an interview published Sunday, branded Iran “a thoroughly malign influence in the region and in the world”.\nburs-jd/fz/dv",

By 9 a.m., the Philadelphia Fire Department had fished their vehicle out of the river!\nAnother Car Recently Ended Up In Schuylkill River Note that it’s unclear if the Philadelphia couple will face any charges for public indecency, indecent exposure, or lewd or disorderly conduct charges, given that the couple was getting it on in a public area.\nHowever, to be clear, there’s no specific federal law banning sexual activity inside of a car in the U.S. The risk is getting it on in a public place, in the view of people.\nFox 29 reports that this is the second car to end up inside the Schuylkill River in the last few weeks. Police are still investigating the case of a 4-door sedan recovered from the river on August 16.\nAn eyewitness said he saw the car stop suddenly and then reverse into the river. He called 911, but responding authorities did not find anyone inside the locked car. However, a window of the car was open, and the back glass was reportedly shattered.\nUPDATE: vehicle recovered but NO BODY inside… pic.twitter.com/dQR3rh9bon\n— Marcus Espinoza (@MarcusFOX29) August 16, 2024\nRELATED: Megan Thee Stallion Sparks Dating Rumors After “Couple’s Edition” Video With THIS NBA Player (WATCH)\nWhat Do You Think Roomies? +1 0 +1 0 +1 0 +1 0 +1 1 +1 0 +1 0",

    "text": "Au moins cinq personnes ont été tuées par certaines des nombreuses tornades qui ont balayé une partie des grandes plaines du centre des États-Unis la semaine dernière. En Oklahoma, où quatre personnes sont mortes, un petit garçon a sauvé ses parents, grièvement blessés dans l’accident de leur voiture, emportée par une tornade. Une histoire digne d’un film catastrophe. Branson Baker, 9 ans, est devenu ces derniers jours le héros des États-Unis. Samedi 27 avril, le petit garçon a réussi à sauver ses parents, grièvement blessés dans l’accident de leur voiture, prise dans une tornade. La famille Baker tentait justement de fuir les tornades dans la ville de Dickson, et se dirigeait vers l’abri anti-tempête d’un ami. Quand, tout à coup, la voiture se retrouve prise dans l’œil d’une tornade, avant d’être projetée dans un arbre. Les parents, Marvin Wayne Baker et Lindy Baker, sont grièvement blessés, relate KVTV. Branson Baker, neuf ans, a sauvé ses parents d’une tornade en Oklahoma. “Impressionnant pour un petit enfant” Leur fils, Branson, est miraculeusement indemne. Le petit garçon, selon le récit de son oncle Johnny Baker au média américain, exhorte alors ses parents à tenir bon: “Maman, Papa, s’il vous plaît, ne mourez pas. Je reviendrai”. Branson parcourt alors 1,5 kilomètre dans la pénombre, à peine éclairé par l’orage, et évitant tous les débris. “Il courait aussi vite qu’il pouvait, aussi fort qu’il le pouvait. Il a probablement parcouru 1,5 kilomètre en 10 minutes, et c’est assez impressionnant pour un petit enfant”, relate son oncle. Plus de 70.000 dollars récoltés en ligne L’enfant réussit à prévenir des voisins, et ses parents sont secourus. Hospitalisés, ils souffraient tous deux de fractures au dos, au cou et aux côtes. Le père de famille a également perdu une partie de son doigt, et son bras a été fracturé. Lindy Baker, elle, a eu un poumon perforé, la mâchoire et une main cassées. Selon nos confrères américains, Wayne Baker est depuis sorti de l’hôpital, et les deux devraient se remettre. Une cagnotte en ligne a été lancée pour aider les Baker à payer les frais médicaux. Ce dimanche 5 mai, elle affiche déjà plus de 70.000 dollars.

    "text": "A Kentucky mechanical maintenance company will soon begin work on a new $7 million plant in Heflin, with plans to hire up to 30 people.\nContour Fabrications and Mechanical (CFM) has announced that construction and site work along U.S. 78 is set to begin next month, with an opening in early 2026.\nCFM will refurbish and maintain the large steel reels used in neighboring client Southwire’s manufacturing plant in Heflin, where that company produces high- and medium voltage electrical cables.\nThe new location will serve Southwire at both its West Georgia and Heflin locations. The company also looked at sites in Georgia before deciding on Heflin.\n“Alabama’s rural communities are playing a vital role in driving our state’s economic future, and CFM’s decision to locate in Cleburne County is proof of that progress,” Gov. Kay Ivey said in a statement.\nThe project is benefiting from $2 million pledged by the Growing Alabama program toward site preparation and infrastructure development. Growing Alabama authorizes up to $26 million in funding for economic development.\n“This new location shows our commitment to quality and growth,” Jason Young, co-owner of CFM, said. “We look forward to serving Southwire and building connections in Alabama.”\nAlabama Commerce Secretary Ellen McNair said the project is the “kind of impactful, targeted growth” the state supports through its Catalyst strategy.\nCatalyst, approved last year, identifies eight sectors for economic development, with one being metals and advanced materials.\n“This project not only strengthens Alabama’s industrial base but also brings high-quality jobs to a rural community that is clearly ready for growth,” McNair said.",
