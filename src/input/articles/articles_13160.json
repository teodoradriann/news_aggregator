    "text": "- Tomás Soucek (13')\n- Konstantinos Mavropanos (55')\nArsenal miss chance to reclaim top spot after loss to West Ham\nDo Arsenal need to sign a striker to sustain Premier League challenge?\nThe \"ESPN FC\" crew discuss Arsenal's 2-0 defeat to West Ham and ponder whether Mikel Arteta should pursue a striker in the January transfer window.\nArsenal spurned the opportunity to retake first place in the Premier League as they lost 2-0 to fellow Londoners West Ham United at the Emirates on Thursday.\nWest Ham only had three efforts on target but\nTomas Soucek gave them a halftime lead before former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos extended the advantage after the break.\n-\nStream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nArsenal had more than twice as many chances but failed to take any as the visitors defended gamely.\n\"This is a very disappointing night for us,\" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta told reporters. \"We have to put the ball in [the net] and win it [the game].\"\nWest Ham took the lead against the run of play after 13 minutes when Soucek knocked home after a pull-back from\nJarrod Bowen, who looked as if he just managed to keep the ball in play.\n\"It's difficult because the ball was in the air,\" Bowen told Amazon Prime. \"It was hard to tell. It would have been easier to tell if it had been on the ground.\"\nAfter that it was an Arsenal blitz with\nBukayo Saka crashing the ball against the post and Gabriel Jesus missing two good opportunities before Mavropanos scored with a thumping header from a James Ward-Prowse corner in the 55th.\nWest Ham could have made it three from three chances but\nSaid Benrahma had a penalty saved in added time after a foul by former West Ham captain Declan Rice.\nThe defeat raises familiar questions about Arsenal's title credentials. They led the league this time last year only to falter in the run in and be overtaken by Manchester City.\nIt may have been one of those nights when things just did not happen in front of goal but finishing remains an issue.\nAs well as striking the post, Saka also had a near point-blank header stopped by Alphonse Areola, who made a string of fine saves in the second half too.\nJesus should have a scored when Arsenal were still one goal behind but headed over an open goal while fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli also missed good opportunities.\nThe win leaves West Ham in sixth place on 33 points and marked a landmark night for their manager David Moyes who had never won at Arsenal in the league in 22 attempts.\nSecond-placed Arsenal remain on 40 points, two behind\nLiverpool who beat Burnley 2-0 on Tuesday.\nGame Information\n- Referees:\n- Michael Oliver\nEnglish Premier League Standings\n|Team\n|GP\n|W\n|D\n|L\n|GD\n|P\nhttps://www.espn.in/football/club/_/id/359/arsenal Aston Villa Manchester City Tottenham Hotspur https://www.espn.in/football/club/_/id/371/west-ham-united Manchester United Brighton & Hove Albion Newcastle United Chelsea Wolverhampton Wanderers AFC Bournemouth Fulham Brentford Crystal Palace Nottingham Forest Everton Luton Town https://www.espn.in/football/club/_/id/379/burnley Sheffield United\nPremier League News\nBritish members of parliament are calling for the creation of a new criminal offence of unlawfully entering a soccer match, plus better collaboration between United Kingdom and overseas police to improve safety at sports event at home and abroad.\nUK lawmakers call for punishment for unlawfully entering matches\nBrighton & Hove Albion picked up a big 4-2 home win over Tottenham Hotspur ending their four game losing streak in the process.",

    "title": "Minister Blair welcomes Latvian Defence Minister Andris Sprūds to Canada and joins Drone Coalition to aid Ukraine",
    "text": "Minister Blair welcomes Latvian Defence Minister Andris SprÅ«ds to Canada and joins Drone Coalition to aid Ukraine\nNational Defence\nNews release\nMarch 7, 2024 - Ottawa, Ontario - National Defence / Canadian Armed Forces\nToday, the Honourable Bill Blair, Minister of National Defence, welcomed Latvia's Defence Minister, Andris SprÅ«ds, to Canada. This is Minister SprÅ«ds' first visit to Canada since his appointment as Latvia's Minister of Defence.\nMinister Blair and Minister SprÅ«ds held a bilateral meeting at National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa. The Ministers condemned Russia's illegal and unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. Minister Blair commended Latvia's military support to Ukraine and the Ministers reaffirmed that both Canada and Latvia will continue to provide Ukraine with comprehensive military assistance.\nTo further develop Ukraine's drone capabilities, Minister Blair committed to Canada joining the Ukraine Defense Contact Group's Drone Capability Coalition, co-led by Latvia and the United Kingdom. As a member of the Capability Coalition, Canada will continue to look for ways to boost Ukraine's drone capabilities.\nTo date, Canada has stepped up significantly to contribute to Ukraine's drone capabilities by donating over 100 made-in-Canada, specialized drone cameras to Ukraine from L3 Wescam. Building on these drone camera donations, Minister Blair announced an additional donation of\n[over 800 drones from Teledyne FLIR](/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/02/ukraine-240219-canada01.htm) last month in Waterloo, Ontario.\nThe Ministers also participated via video link in a videoconference on support for Ukraine, hosted by France's Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, StÃ©phane SÃ©journÃ©, and France's Minister for the Armed Forces, SÃ©bastien Lecornu.\nThe two Ministers discussed current efforts to scale up the multinational NATO Battle Group in Latvia, which Canada has led since 2017. Minister Blair thanked Minister SprÅ«ds for Latvia's hospitality to the approximately 1,000 Canadian troops currently deployed in Latvia.\nCanada is more than doubling its military presence on Operation REASSURANCE - from about 1,000 troops to a sustained deployment of up to 2,200 troops by 2026, as Canada committed in the\n[July 2023 Roadmap on Scaling the eFP Latvia Battle Group to Brigade](/wmd/library/news/canada/2023/canada-230711-canada01.htm). Canada is also deploying additional capabilities to the Battle Group. In late 2023, Canada deployed a Canadian Army Tank Squadron of 15 Leopard 2 Main Battle Tanks to Latvia, and starting this summer, Canada will begin to deploy Royal Canadian Air Force helicopters to the Battle Group, as Minister Blair announced in December 2023.\nMinister Blair also highlighted that Canada is investing in new military capabilities for the Canada-led Battle Group. In 2023, Canada\n[announced](/wmd/library/news/canada/2023/canada-230309-canada01.htm) that it was designating three key capabilities for Canadian troops in Latvia as Urgent Operational Requirements. Since then, Canada has finalized the procurement of all three capabilities: [anti-tank weapons](/wmd/library/news/canada/2023/canada-231215-canada02.htm); [an air defence capability; and anti-drone equipment](canada-240215-canada01.htm). This equipment will begin to flow to Canadian Armed Forces members this year.\nMinister Blair and Minister SprÅ«ds reaffirmed that Canada and Latvia are dedicated to maintaining a close, productive relationship as NATO Allies. The two Ministers agreed to stay in close, regular contact.\nQuick facts\n-\nCanada enjoys excellent relations with Latvia. Canada was the first G7 country to recognize the restoration of Latvia's independence in 1991, and one of the first countries to ratify Latvia's accession to NATO in 2004.\n-\nLatvia is home to Canada's largest current foreign military deployment. Approximately 1,000 Canadian Armed Forces members are deployed to Latvia.\n-\nCanada is more than doubling its military presence in Latvia. Canada will complete the full implementation of persistently deployed Brigade capabilities to Latvia by 2026, at which point the Brigade will have up to 2,200 CAF members as part of the Forward Land Forces and supporting elements in Latvia.\n-\nMinister Blair visited Latvia in December 2023, where he met with Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs and Defence Minister Andris SprÅ«ds. During his visit, Minister Blair\n[announced several measures](/wmd/library/news/canada/2023/canada-231215-canada02.htm)to strengthen Canada's military presence in Latvia, and several investments in infrastructure needed to scale up the current battle group to a brigade.\n-\nMinister Blair and Minister SprÅ«ds also recently met bilaterally and multilaterally in Brussels, Belgium at the meeting of NATO Defence Ministers in February 2024.\n-\nCanada is participating in the Armour and Air Force Coalitions.\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|",
