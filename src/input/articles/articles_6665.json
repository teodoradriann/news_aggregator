    "title": "Lenovo China clones the ThinkPad X1 Carbon with an old, slow, local x86",
    "text": "Four-core crawler can’t beat current – or ancient – AMDs or Intels Lenovo's Chinese operation has created a premium laptop based around a slow and out-of-date x86-compatible processor – but at least it's locally designed. Chinese state media report that the machine – dubbed the Kaixian X1 G1d – weighs in at 990 grams, boasts a 2800x1800 display, three USB-C ports, one USB-A slot, and an unspecified capacity for DDR4 memory. The Zhaoxin KX-6000G chip powering the laptop offers just four cores and runs four threads. While Lenovo has apparently juiced the 3.6GHz processor to run at 3.8GHz, tests of the processor rate it as inferior to Intel and AMD desktop chips released three to five years ago. Lenovo has nonetheless used premium packaging for the machine, which is said to resemble the ThinkPad X1 Carbon that has long been the PC leader's flagship business laptop. Prices start at around $1,500. But don't try buying it from Lenovo.com.cn – it's not there. The machine is being sold at third party online stores, while Lenovo China's own online store is full of machines packing more recent and powerful Intel and AMD processors. But the box does feature on the website of Shanghai Zhaoxin Integrated Circuit Co., Ltd – the silicon slinger that made its processor, using tech derived from the x86 license it acquired years ago from Taiwan's Via Technologies, which made its own modest range of processors before quitting the CPU biz and heading for other markets. Chinese chipmaker Loongson now just three to five years off the pace on the desktop China's top Office clone copies Microsoft again – with an inconvenient outage China Telecom's next 150,000 servers will mostly use local processors Lenovo turns to India as source of AI servers What gives? Why has Lenovo created – and seemingly hidden – a premium-look laptop with a poor processor? To answer that question, remember that China wants locals to use more tech designed and built within its borders. Earlier this year Beijing even excluded AMD and Intel from a list of approved CPUs, and has also emphasized the use of locally developed operating systems. Know, too, that Zhaoxin has Beijing's favor, and that Chinese media is hailing this laptop as the first time the chip design firm's wares have been packaged into a product. Zhaoxin, however, has already bettered the KX-6000G. Just last week it showed off its KX-7000 series processors in a desktop PC from local box builder Tongfang Computer. One market that could be receptive to a pretty but underpowered laptop is China's government, which has been asked to lead the transition to local tech by example. But overall, this one is a head-scratcher. ®",

    "title": "Bethlehem ‘without Christmas trees, without lights’ due to Israel-Hamas war | Bucks Free Press",
    "text": "Bethlehem, the normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus, resembles a ghost town this Christmas Eve, with celebrations called off due to the Israel-Hamas war. The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square are missing, as are the foreign tourists who gather each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrol the empty square. Gift shops have been slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did open their doors once the rain stopped pouring down. There are few visitors, however. Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years, said: “This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there’s just darkness.” He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, symbolising the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounds the scene, with grey rubble added to the spectacle reflecting none of the lights and bursts of colour that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square, said: “We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to.” Mr Salameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. “Normally, you can’t find a single chair to sit, we’re full from morning till midnight,” he said. This year, just one table was taken – by journalists sheltering from the rain. He said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and was not able to cover operating costs. Mr Salameh estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income – almost all of that during the Christmas season. With many major airlines cancelling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say around 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed. Under a banner that read “Bethlehem’s Christmas bells ring for a cease-fire in Gaza,” a few teenagers offered small inflatable Santa figures, but no one was buying. Instead of their traditional musical march through the streets of Bethlehem, young scouts stood silently with flags. A group of local students unfurled a massive Palestinian flag as they stood in silence. Bethlehem’s mayor, Hana Haniyeh, said in an address: “Our message every year on Christmas is one of peace and love, but this year it’s a message of sadness, grief and anger in front of the international community with what is happening and going on in the Gaza Strip.” Dr Joseph Mugasa, a paediatrician, was one of the few international visitors. He said his tour group of 15 people from Tanzania was “determined” to come to the region despite the situation. “I’ve been here several times, and it’s quite a unique Christmas, as usually there’s a lot of people and a lot of celebrations,” he said. “But you can’t celebrate while people are suffering, so we are sad for them and praying for peace.” More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel’s air and ground offensive against Gaza’s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault October 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since October 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.

    "text": "\"Demonic\" sea lions attack beachgoers in California for this bizarre reason\nLos Angeles, California - A gang of \"demonic\" sea lions have been attacking people on beaches in South California, likely due to a bizarre and deadly disease linked to recent algal blooms.\nSeveral people have been attacked by \"possessed\" sea lions on beaches in Southern California, raising concerns about an algal bloom that can be deadly for the animals and cause increasingly violent behavior.\n\"Its expression was feral, almost demonic, devoid of the curiosity or playfulness I’d always associated with sea lions,\" wrote Rj LaMendola on Facebook after being attacked by a sea lion.\n15-year-old Phoebe Beltran was also attacked while doing a lifeguard swim test at a nearby beach.\n\"I was just so scared, so shocked, but I still felt the immense pain on my arms, like, over and over again,\" she said.\nWhile sea lions are naturally relatively calm and friendly creatures that very rarely attack people, such incidents are believed to be the result of domoic acid toxicosis, a neurological condition caused by algal blooms.\nOver the last few years, these blooms have become more regular and increasingly severe, with 2025 being a particularly early year for a bloom to have begun.\nAccording to scientists, the sickness brought on by the bloom makes sea lions feel extremely unwell and disorientated. As a result, they get scared and more aggressive.\nScientists warn of algal bloom-triggered sea lion sickness\n\"These animals are reacting to the fact that they are sick,\" CEO John Warner of the Marine Mammal Care Center (MMCC) in Los Angeles told the BBC.\n\"They're disoriented, and most likely, most of them are having seizures, and so their senses are not all fully functional as they normally would, and they're acting out of fear.\"\nThe MMCC is a nonprofit that looks after sick sea lions as well as other marine mammals.\nThey have treated at least 195 sea lions in just the last two months compared to only 50 in the same time period last year.\n\"Their behavior changes from what we're used to, to something more unpredictable,\" Warner said. \"If they're still aggressive or not foraging properly, it tells us their brains aren't functioning the way they should.\"\n\"These are still the same charismatic, really fun-to-watch expert cuddle puddlers that we see along the coast all the time,\" he said before cautioning that people still \"need to remember they are wild animals.\"\nCover photo: Unsplash/Shannon VanDenHeuvel",
