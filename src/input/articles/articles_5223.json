    "title": "LA Rams, Edwards Lifesciences offer free heart screenings in Inglewood",
    "text": "INGLEWOOD (KABC) -- In recognition of Black History Month and American Heart Month, the L.A. Rams and Edwards Lifesciences hosted a heart screening for the community. \"Heart disease is leading cause of death in the United States. Not cancer. And heart disease disproportionately impacts the African American community, so we are here to provide education and awareness about heart disease and heart valve disease in addition to providing the screening,\" said Dr. Cedric Cravens, director of patient engagement and health access equity with Edwards Lifesciences. The screenings were completely free at Faithful Central Bible Church in Inglewood which is Rams legend Joe's Sweet's home church \"One of the reasons this is really important, especially during Black History Month, is that we can't do it by ourselves. There's this old adage that says, if you go by yourself, you can go fast, but when you go as a group, you can go further,\" said George B. Thompson, a pastor at Faithful Central Bible Church. The event featured two heart health informational sessions and screenings including blood pressure, electrocardiogram and echocardiograms. Attendees learned about the signs and symptoms of heart disease. \"There are many things that we can do to try and lower our risk of developing cardiovascular disease such as exercising at least 150 minutes weekly, making sure our blood pressure is under control, controlling diabetes and things like that,\" said Dr. Tiffany Randolph, a non-invasive cardiologist. \"I personally have health care but also too knowing that in certain communities that it's not available. Poverty in certain communities, actually people not having education, not understanding how important it is to have these type of screenings, so having that information, having a team like the Rams come to our community and say, 'Hey this is important. We want to pour into your community. We're not only going to play in your community, but we also want to pour into the community.' That's important to me.\" said Nannette Griggs, a member of the church.",

    "title": "Dunzo's demise: How the Reliance-backed hyperlocal delivery startup unravelled, ET Retail",
    "text": "In January 2022, Dunzo appeared unstoppable fresh from raising $240 million led by Reliance Retail. The company promised to deliver groceries to millions of Indians within 15 minutes.Three years on, Kabeer Biswas, its sole remaining founder has left Dunzo marking the end of a venture that pioneered India's hyperlocal delivery movement. ETtech reported on Thursday that Biswas has joined Flipkart to lead the ecommerce major’s quick commerce business Minutes.A closer look at the events of the past few years reveals a series of strategic missteps, financial mismanagement, and operational challenges that eventually led to the downfall of Dunzo.The hyper-growth trapAfter closing its largest fundraise in 2022 where Reliance Retail invested $200 million, Dunzo ramped up its operations, pushing for hyper-growth. Its aggressive expansion of Dunzo Daily, a 15-20-minute grocery delivery service, became the central focus.The company's monthly expenses ballooned to more than Rs 100 crore, fuelled by expensive India Premier League (IPL) sponsorship and marketing campaigns that tripled business volume but led to unsustainable cash burn. Despite its expansion efforts, Dunzo struggled to shed its image as primarily a courier service rather than a quick commerce contender.As cash reserves dwindled and funding proved elusive, the company was forced to extend its delivery promise from 15 minutes to 60 minutes, hoping to lower costs through order batching. The problems multiplied by mid-2023 amid a broader funding slowdown in India's startup ecosystem.Failed investments, M&AsA potential investment from fintech PhonePe in Dunzo's merchant network business failed to materialise, with the deal's collapse partly attributed to concerns from other investors about PhonePe's Walmart backing.Similarly, Flipkart’s offer to acquire the company hit a wall when investors opposed selling the Dunzo brand.Even Reliance Retail, which held a 26 per cent stake in Dunzo, remained reluctant to infuse additional capital. The company's attempts to raise funds through a rights issue at a significantly reduced valuation highlighted its increasingly desperate financial situation.The ambitious expansion from seven cities to 15-16 proved to be a critical misstep. Dunzo was already grappling with operational challenges and mounting costs in existing markets when it pursued this aggressive scaling.Business crumblesA belated strategic pivot to focus on Bengaluru and Pune came too late, as competitors like Swiggy Instamart had already cemented their market dominance.Zepto, too, had begun scaling operations and emerged as the third major player.Internal stability crumbled as financial pressures mounted. Five board members, including co-founders Dalvir Suri and Mukund Jha, departed. Employees faced months of delayed salaries, some extending into 2023, while multiple rounds of layoffs followed.This reflected in Dunzo's FY23 financials as its losses more than tripled to over Rs 1,800 crore even as revenue grew fourfold to Rs 226 crore.The company's ventures into business-to-business (B2B) logistics through Dunzo Merchant Services and its platform integration with the government’s Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) proved insufficient to address the fundamental cash flow challenges.In a last ditch effort it tried securing $20 million from existing investors but that too didn't come through.What’s next?Throughout its 10-year journey, Dunzo's aggressive focus on rapid growth, driven partly by investor expectations, came at the cost of sustainable business practices.Having raised $450 million in all, the company was last valued at $745 million. It counted Google, Lightbox and Blume Ventures as its investors with Reliance being its single largest shareholder.The company compromised on unit economics and cost control in its pursuit of market share. Marketing strategies, including substantial spending on IPL sponsorships and unprofitable growth tactics, placed a heavy burden on finances without delivering long-term value.The reliance on external funding became particularly problematic when the investment climate soured.Unable to secure timely investments, Dunzo faced mounting liabilities and boardroom instability. The erosion of investor trust accelerated as it struggled to meet its financial obligations to vendors and employees, marking a stark reversal for a startup that once symbolised the potential of India's hyperlocal delivery segment.Dunzo’s debt of around $60 million remains a drag on its books.Several cases have been filed against the startup, with at least two of them being heard at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). A final verdict is awaited in these cases from the tribunal.The Dunzo brand remains with the company but there is hardly any presence left for any senior executive to run the company. Biswas is finally out from Dunzo and with that, Dunzo's two years of struggle and toil come to a long-awaited end.",

    "text": "Plus de 30 000 salariés chez Boeing (Licence) ont officiellement choisi de se mettre en grève après avoir rejeté le contrat préféré de l’entreprise aérospatiale à une écrasante majorité.\\n\\n\\nSelon le district 75 du syndicat de l’Association internationale des machinistes, 94,6% des travailleurs qu’il représente et W24 Machinists ont voté jeudi pour rejeter l’accord provisoire du syndicat avec Boeing. Quatre-vingt-seize pour cent de ces travailleurs ont voté en faveur d’une grève, qui a débuté à minuit vendredi.\\n\\n« Il s’agit de respect, de faire face au passé et de lutter pour notre avenir », a déclaré jeudi soir Jon Holden, président du district 751 de l’IAM. Reuters rapporte. \\n\\nLes dirigeants du syndicat, y compris Holden, avaient plaidé pour que les travailleurs acceptent le contrat, même si ses membres dans les régions de Seattle et de Portland n’étaient pas satisfaits. \\n\\nL’accord, s’il avait été approuvé, aurait donné augmentation de salaire de 25 % pour les travailleurs d’ici la fin du contrat de quatre ans, qui expirerait en septembre 2028. Il offrirait également aux membres des taux minimaux plus élevés, des heures supplémentaires obligatoires réduites et une voix dans la sécurité et la qualité du système de production de Boeing et garantirait que le prochain avion commercial de Boeing soit construit dans l’État de Washington et dans l’Oregon.\\n\\nMais les travailleurs espéraient une augmentation de salaire de 40 %, ainsi que d’autres revendications qui n’ont pas été satisfaites, notamment le retour de leur retraite traditionnelle, abandonnée en 2013. Jeffries (JEF) analystes récemment estimé qu’une augmentation de 40 % ajouterait 2 % aux besoins de trésorerie du constructeur d’avions, soit 1,5 milliard de dollars de plus que sa base actuelle.\\n\\nLa grève de l’IAM est la première pour Boeing depuis 2008, lorsque les travailleurs du syndicat sur la côte ouest ont observé un arrêt de travail de huit semaines qui a coûté à l’entreprise environ 100 millions de dollars par jour en revenus différés. \\n\\nBoeing a besoin de ces travailleurs pour assembler ses principaux avions de ligne 737 Max, que l’IAM 751 fabrique à Washington. Bien que la Federal Aviation Administration ait plafonné le nombre d’avions que Boeing peut construire après un éclatement du bouchon de porte plus tôt cette année exposée Problèmes de contrôle de qualité, l’entreprise doit encore produire toutes les unités qu’elle peut.\\n\\n\\n « Je sais que la réaction à notre accord provisoire avec l’IAM a été passionnée », PDG Kelly Ortberg aurait-il dit aux travailleurs avant le vote. « Je comprends et respecte cette passion, mais je vous demande de ne pas sacrifier l’opportunité d’assurer notre avenir ensemble à cause des frustrations du passé. »\\n\\n",

    "text": "Summary by Ground News The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem led a Christmas procession to the city of Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank on Sunday. The procession was much smaller than previous years, with Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa only being accompanied by some Franciscan monks and a handful of other believers. Bethlehem is usually visited by tens of thousands of international pilgrims around Christmas.

    "text": "The 2023 [Cleveland Browns](https://www.dawgsbynature.com/) season was mostly defined by injuries and resiliency. Despite losing key starters like Jack Conklin, Nick Chubb and Deshaun Watson early in the season, the Browns were able to roll to an 11-win season and a playoff berth. The start of training camp for 2024 [came with some injury concerns as well for Cleveland](https://www.dawgsbynature.com/2024/7/24/24205300/cleveland-browns-place-7-players-on-training-camp-injury-lists-nick-chubb-greg-newsome). [As the Browns kicked off camp at The Greenbrier](https://www.dawgsbynature.com/2024/7/25/24206234/browns-training-camp-practice-schedule-greenbrier-dates-times), seven players were added to different injury lists including Greg Newsome and Nyheim Hines for injuries not sustained while with the team. While Jack Conklin, Jedrick Wills, Chubb and Hines were known to be recovering from injuries last season, Dalvin Tomlinson and D’Anthony Bell were new. On the first day of training camp, HC Kevin Stefanski announced that Newsome had undergone surgery already and that Tomlinson would be doing the same: Lot of updates from Browns HC Kevin Stefanski:— Daniel Oyefusi (@DanielOyefusi) — CB Greg Newsome underwent surgery after injuring his hamstring during training; team is hoping to have him back for Week 1 — DT Dalvin Tomlinson is going to have a knee scope — Stefanski will continue to call plays [pic.twitter.com/owPnwXXrTG] [July 25, 2024] We share more from [HC Kevin Stefanski’s play-calling decision here earlier](https://www.dawgsbynature.com/2024/7/25/24206397/browns-kevin-stefanski-ken-dorsey-decision-made-on-play-calling). On the practice field, Myles Garrett led a big group of players who started off to the side during drills: — Ashley Bastock (@AshleyBastock42) [#Browns]starting off to the side today: Myles Garrett, David Njoku, Nick Chubb, Jerry Jeudy, Cameron Mitchell, D’Anthony Bell, and Nyheim Hines. [pic.twitter.com/Anwr6OQufL] [July 25, 2024] Garrett and Jeudy [later joined the walkthrough portion of the practice](https://x.com/ScottPetrak/status/1816552778501902599). We will have a full recap of Browns Training Camp Day 1 on the site this afternoon. What is your concern level with all of the injuries noted above?",
