    "title": "Old Farmer’s Almanac serves up weather predictions and variety of homespun tips for 2025",
    "text": "TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - Just about everyone seems to be interested in the weather.\nEvery year since 1792, forecasts have been a key component of The Old Farmer’s Almanac.\nThough the forecasts are made months in advance, they have proven to be amazingly accurate, its publishers say.\nAlready on the shelves of stores across the nation, the 2025 Old Farmer’s Almanac is predicting a “calmer, gentler” winter for many parts of the United States.\nThat would be good news for those of us who live in the Midwest.\n“This winter, temperatures will be up and snowfall down throughout most parts of the United States,” says Carol Connare, the Almanac’s editor. “While there will still be plenty of winter chill out there and powdery snow to enjoy, the high costs associated with the season shouldn’t hit so hard.\n“It will be, by and large, a very temperate, uneventful winter and potentially a welcome reprieve from the extremes of recent years.”\nThere will be exceptions to those predictions, something the Almanac doesn’t shy away from noting. Winter rainstorms will leave Florida, the Deep South and southern California sopped and soaked, Meanwhile, heavy snowfall is expected in central and southern Appalachia, the western Ohio Valley and the Rockies — which will be welcome news for skiers.\nA more moderate winter will eventually give way to a sweltering summer, especially for folks without air-conditioning, the Almanac predicts. The new edition shares the best ways to beat the summer heat, including advice on how to make an inexpensive, homemade air-conditioning unit from a box fan and 1-liter bottles.\nThe 2025 Old Farmer’s Almanac also explores: how tomatoes -- once dismissed as “odious and repelling-smelling berries” by The Horticulturalist -- became North America’s favorite vegetable; the surprising Canadian history of America’s favorite pastime; and why incidences of “white dragons” -- also known as avalanches -- are on the rise. In addition, the Almanac looks into whether Earth is on a collision course with the collection of space rubble known as “Bennu.”\nBeyond weather prognostications, the newest edition of The Old Farmer’s Almanac features a healthy dose of wit and wisdom along with tried-and-true advice, including:\n• Trick a garden located anywhere into growing almost anything\n• Start and care for a backyard flock of chickens\n• Catch, cook, and truly appreciate Nature’s original “fish sticks” — that is, smelts.\n• Garden by the cycles of the Moon\n• Understand and interpret the curious behaviors of cats\n• Find health and happiness in a cup of tea\n• Give the perfect hug\nIn an email interview, the Almanac’s associate editor Tim Goodwin discussed what keeps the publication fresh and relevant after 233 years.\n• What is new this year with the 2025 Old Farmer’s Almanac?\n“There is a great collection of features that grace the Almanac pages in the 2025 edition, covering all the subjects that Almanac readers have come to expect. For gardeners, there are stories about tomatoes, gardening by the Moon, and how to trick plants to be ‘Zone Cheaters.’ We received a large collection of recipes for our holiday recipe contest and, after extensive testing, we narrowed it down to the top four to share. We explain why your cat does some of those curious behaviors, the folklore behind the ocean tides, and why you should be aware of Bennu. Add in the Canadian roots of America’s pastime, the science behind avalanches, and the best way to give -- and receive -- a hug, and the 2025 Almanac truly has something that will interest everyone.\n“And, of course, all the mainstays of the Almanac return — from the calendar pages and regional weather forecasts, to the astronomical data and gardening charts that are handy throughout the year.”\n• Why do you think the Almanac stays popular year after year? What’s its appeal?\n“For one thing, the iconic yellow cover is immediately recognizable and we like to think it brings upon a sense of nostalgia. We have been published every year since 1792 -- the oldest continuously published periodical in North America -- and the love of the Almanac is something that is passed down through the generations. With 2.5 million copies distributed each year, the Almanac is in the hands of so many people across the country and our faithful readers love to share what the Almanac is all about.\n“The appeal is what the Almanac provides. There is no other publication where you can get this kind of wealth of information — which has been tirelessly edited, fact-checked, and proofed—in one place and it’s something that you can use throughout the year.\n“The Almanac is so well known for its long-range weather forecasts and that’s what so many people come back for year after year, but that is just the tip of the iceberg.”\n• What makes the Old Farmer’s Almanac unique?\n“Outside of the long-range weather forecasts, it’s the useful information that it provides. Where else can you get information about upcoming eclipses, what to see in the night sky each month, and the rise and set times of the Sun and the Moon in the same book as the first and last frost dates for the year, when to set eggs, and the best day to have dental work, mow your grass to promote growth, and go camping based on the Moon’s sign? But it’s far from just dates and charts, the carefully chosen collection of features in gardening, food, astrology, astronomy, etc., provide insight into many topics that offer a new perspective with a wealth of knowledge.”\n• Who is the primary audience for the Almanac?\n“We like to think the Almanac has something for everybody. Whether you’re passionate about weather, gardening, astronomy, or food, there is a story that will make you say ‘I never knew that!’ There will be data, dates, times, conversions that help you in everyday life. If someone out there doesn’t believe the Almanac is for them, pick it up and give it a look because you might be surprised how much will interest you.”\n• How do you appeal to younger audiences?\n“It’s all about providing new information that will pique everyone’s interest. Since we have such a long history, there is a reasonable assumption that most folks know what the Almanac is or have least seen it -- again that yellow cover -- so it is important to make sure that each year is unique. You want to have that historical aspect, the pages and sections that are hallmarks of the OFA, but at the same time we always want to make sure that we provide our readers—new and returning, younger and older—with a reason to pick it up throughout the year and, of course, the next year.\n“Younger readers are value-conscious and we are giving them something that is useful every day of the year for less than $10. Also, there’s new interest in the old ways—ways of gardening for instance—that have stood the test of time.”\n• Everyone is interested in the weather, it seems -- how does the Almanac make its predictions so far in advance and how accurate are the forecasts?\n“There is a great interest in the Almanac’s long-range forecasts. When the OFA comes out each year, we talk to radio and TV stations, as well as podcasts and newspapers across the country and in Canada. We also get questions through our website about weather predictions well in advance for specific dates as people plan weddings, events, and trips based on the OFA.\n“When Robert B. Thomas started the Almanac and the long-range forecasts, he did so with the belief that weather on Earth was influenced by sunspots—magnetic storms on the surface of the Sun. We still use solar science as part of the three scientific disciplines employed to make our forecasts, along with climatology and meteorology. We predict weather trends and events by comparing solar patterns and historical weather conditions, using among other things, 30-year statistical averages prepared by government meteorological agencies to predict temperature and precipitation deviations from averages, or normal.\n“Our results are typically very close to our traditional claim of 80%, but of course some years are better than others. That’s just how it goes when predicting the weather.\n“It really depends on where you live, because for some zip codes and regions we are spot on or very close, while in other areas we miss by a larger margin. For Topeka, we predicted November 2023 to March 2024 would be .5 inches over normal precipitation and it was actually .2.”\n• What’s the greatest appeal of the Almanac, especially in a world that seems to be changing so quickly?\n“I think the appeal is that The Old Farmer’s Almanac has stayed true to its roots for 233 years and readers know what to expect. When Robert B. Thomas founded the OFA, he laid a foundation for this yearly periodical that still remain to this day. It continues to be a calendar of the heavens and provide long-range weather forecasts much like it did in the beginning. Not everyone is looking for the ‘latest and greatest,’ and there’s a draw to something that not only has lasted over two centuries and can be a link to previous moments in time, but also be current and informative. And, part of our mission is to have a pleasant degree of humor as stated by the founder himself, and who couldn’t use a little more lightheartedness in their day?\n“We saw last year how the winter just wasn’t as cold and our forecast for the 2024–25 winter reflects what we have seen in recent years. A good portion of the country, including the Heartland (where Topeka resides) will experience more milder temperatures this winter, while areas that typically see snow will not see as much snow when compared to those 30-year averages. As for summer 2025, most of the country should be prepared for hot and dry conditions.”\n• Do city folks read it as well as those in the country?\n“The Almanac has something for everyone, especially people who like to grow things. You don’t have to live in an area where it is farmland and acres of land for gardens, people do a lot with patios and even windowsills. The Almanac can be “useful, with a pleasant degree of humor” no matter where you live. Whether you’re interested in astronomy, gardening, or food, or simply like to be presented with new interesting material, you will find something in the Almanac. You can garden anywhere, observe the night sky in all different locations, and cooking is a universal language that isn’t governed by where you live. Pick it up and see for yourself!”\n• Where can people pick up copies?\n“Anywhere books and magazines are sold! Many retailers — like supermarkets, pharmacies, bookstores, and wherever you buy gardening supplies like Lowe’s, Tractor Supply and Walmart — carry The Old Farmer’s Almanac. If folks can’t find it, they can go to almanac.com/wheretobuy and select what state they live in and a list of retailers will be provided. It can also be ordered on almanac.com/shop or through Amazon and sent right to your mailbox.”\n• Anything else?\n“We are currently working hard on the 2026 edition, which will have at least a few stories celebrating America’s 250th anniversary. And the OFA brand is more than just the Almanac: we have an annual Garden Guide, an OFA Kids that comes out every other year (Volume 11 will hit the shelves next summer), a collection of calendars, a planner, and a gardening handbook series!”\nThe new edition includes all of this, plus the Almanac’s “Trends” predictions for 2025; the humor of “Anecdotes & Pleasantries”; “Mind-Mangling” puzzles; award-winning holiday recipes; and weather forecasts for all 18 regions of the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii.\nFor those who live on farms -- and those who reside in cities, towns and villages across the country -- The Old Farmers’s Almanac offers an enjoyable and entertaining way to spend some time on a cold winter’s night, or evenings in the spring, summer and fall, for that matter.\nPick it up, take a few minutes to glance at some of the material it contains, and chances are you’ll find out something you didn’t previously know, while having a good time learning about it.\nThe Old Farmer’s Almanac — with its iconic yellow cover and classic corner hole — originates from Yankee Publishing Inc., a 100% employee-owned company in Dublin, N.H.\nThe Almanac’s editors also produce their annual Garden Guide ; digital monthly magazine EXTRA !; The Old Farmer’s Almanac for Kids Vol. 10, now available; and a collection of wall and desk calendars, including The Old Farmer’s Almanac Planner .\nThey also publish a collection of gardening titles, such as the Container Gardener’s Handbook , released in Spring 2024; the Flower Gardener’s Handbook ; and the Vegetable Gardener’s Handbook , now in its seventh printing.\nThe 2025 Old Farmer’s Almanac is available for a cover price of $9.95 wherever books and magazines are sold. A full list of stores that carry The Old Farmer’s Almanac is available at Almanac.com/Wheretobuy .\nPrint and digital copies of The 2025 Old Farmer’s Almanac also are available online at Almanac.com/Shop and on Amazon.\nDaily Almanac wit and wisdom are available through Almanac.com , Facebook , Pinterest , Instagram , TikTok , and the Amazon Echo voice assistant.\nCopyright 2024 WIBW.

    "text": "BELLEVUE, Neb. (KMTV) – United Way worked with the Department of Veteran Affairs and Offutt Air Force Base to launch the new military and family helpline. - United Way of the Midlands, Offutt AFB and the Department of Veterans Affairs created new helpline for Military and families - The helpline is available 24/7 to Service members, veterans and their families in Nebraska and Iowa - The military and family helpline can give resources for financial help, food, housing, childcare and more BROADCAST TRANSCRIPT: A new helpline aims to support service members, veterans and their families with specialized confidential assistance. “One of the worst things is to have someone go through issue and challenge and here's some resource that they're not connected to,” said John Hilgert, director of the Nebraska Department of Veterans Affairs. “We want to make sure they are connected to make sure everything runs smoothly.\" United Way of the Midlands partnered with Veterans Affairs and Offutt Air force Base to create the new helpline for military members and their families. \"Through the helpline if there's issues that may be needed for their family, some recommendations or if they are new to the area this can help them make sure everything is good back home so they can focus on the mission,” Hilgert said. The help line is through United Way's already existing 211 help line. Shawna Forsberge, president and CEO for United Way said by partnering with Offutt and the VA, they were able to create a helpline tailored to service member’s needs. \"We really feel there’s profound responsibility to stand up for those that served so this is a really a unique public private partnership that we combine what United Way and 211 does best with the expertise of the installation and the VA to provide comprehensive support,” Forsberge said. The helpline can assist service members with finding resources for multiple things including childcare, financial help, housing, employment and food. Users are provided with live support through their phone, online or email. The helpline available 24/7 to all service members and veterans across Nebraska and Iowa.",

    "text": "今天突然公布周琦受伤的消息，这是让人意外的情况。因为内线本来能用的人就不是很多，最终造成内线会非常劣势。更为关键的是，现在球队的伤病名单还非常多，已经受伤的四个人都快凑出一套首发阵容了。\n其中崔永熙和张镇麟肯定是不能打了。现在崔永熙还在美国康复，现在还没有完全痊愈，即便现在已经开始有球训练了，距离完全好还有很长一段时间。并且张镇麟之前遭遇伤势复发，当然在上赛季，张镇麟的伤病就没有好过。他一直都在坚持保守治疗，最终造成他的伤势始终没好。当然到目前，还没有传出张镇麟手术的动态，不知道下赛季的状态会怎么样。\n曾凡博已经结束了德国的治疗，回到了北京，但他还无法参加欧洲拉练，他的腰伤目前也没有好。现在差不多还有一个月的时间，曾凡博肯定想参加亚洲杯，不知道欧洲拉练之后，他的动态会怎么样。\n周琦在训练过程中造成伤势复发，无法坚持高强度的比赛，他会前往美国进行康复治疗。周琦肯定也想继续征战亚洲杯，这么短时间，不排除周琦和以前那样带伤的可能性，这就很让人遗憾。\n不知道现在杨瀚森的情况怎么样。杨瀚森之前就表态需要的话就打，现在可能还是要看郭士强的决定。后续杨瀚森肯定要打完夏季联赛，那么差不多就是中下旬了。即便他抵达球队，也无法成为绝对的核心。反正球迷都希望杨瀚森继续留在美国，但目前官方还是没有一个明确的定论，或许是在等待周琦的伤势？如果周琦状态不好，余嘉豪与徐昕顶着的难度非常大，今年亚洲杯又悬了。\n声明：个人原创，仅供参考",

    "text": "The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) has published an online resource designed to provide easy access to interventions that improve minority health and reduce health disparities.\nUNC Lineberger’s Sam Cykert, MD. The HDPulse Interventions Portal features a study led by UNC Lineberger’s Samuel Cykert, MD , that demonstrated that a system-based approach to optimizing care profoundly narrowed Black-white disparities in cancer treatment and markedly improved care for everyone. The portal has 24 evidence-based interventions that address a range of diseases and health conditions\nCykert and Eugenia Eng, PhD, now professor emerita of health behavior at UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health and a former UNC Lineberger member, and their colleagues with the Greensboro (North Carolina) Health Disparities Collaborative led the ACCURE Pragmatic Quality Improvement trial, which demonstrated a system-based intervention within cancer treatment centers can reduce and eliminate disparities in treatment and outcomes for black patients with early-stage lung and breast cancer.\n“After decades of scrutiny and hundreds of papers outlining health care disparities, studies documenting interventions mitigating these disparities have been exceedingly rare,” said Cykert, a professor of medicine at the UNC School of Medicine. “Therefore, it’s deeply significant that the NIH and NIMHD have created this website to showcase evidence-based, successful interventions. Our multi-faceted approach not only helped close the gap in cancer treatment disparities but also demonstrated markedly improved care for all patients with curable lung cancer.”\nCykert said this system-based approach for cancer care should be implemented now essentially at every cancer center, as well as be used to improve the management of preventive care for other chronic diseases.",

    "text": "Émile Chouinard and Jacob Newcombe win the Paul-Dumont Trophy\nApril 18, 2024 -\nQuebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) News Release\nBoucherville, QC - The QMJHL is proud to announce that Émile Chouinard of the Baie-Comeau Drakkar and Jacob Newcombe of the Cape Breton Eagles win the Paul-Dumont Trophy as personalities of the year in the league.\nIn his fourth and final season in Baie-Comeau, Chouinard collected 14 points in 45 games, with a +38 rating, seventh on the Drakkar's scoring list. Chouinard had to end his regular season on February 3 to undergo treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma. The courageous No. 15 remained with the team's entourage until his return to action in Game #3 of the first round on April 2.\nNewcombe will remember January 18, 2024 for the rest of his life. On that day, against his former team, the Chicoutimi Saguenéens, he made a comeback after battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type of cancer. Scoring 24 points in 26 games, his return inspired the Eagles, who compiled the QMJHL's fourth-best record in the second half of the season en route to fourth place in the Eastern Conference.\nFor an interview with Émile Chouinard : Jordan Robert, 418 295-6377, communications@le-drakkar.com\nFor an interview with Jacob Newcombe : Brad Chandler, 902-295-0683, brad.chandler@capebretoneagles.com\nThe finalists were:\nYanick Jean, head coach, Chicoutimi Saguenéens\nOn February 23, Yanick Jean set a QMJHL record with his 590th victory as head coach. A pilot in our league since 2005 and with Chicoutimi since November 2014, Jean also led the young Saguenéens to a 35-25-4-4 record for 78 points, just five points behind Moncton and third place in the Eastern Conference. Not bad for a team that relied on eight rookies who played at least 20 games.\nJustin Poirier, forward, Baie-Comeau Drakkar\nIn his second QMJHL season, Poirier made headlines by becoming the first 17-year-old since Sidney Crosby in 2004-2005 to score 50 goals. His 51 goals earned him the first-ever Mario-Lemieux Trophy, as the league's top goal-scorer. Number 9 added 31 assists to finish seventh in the league in scoring. He is eligible for the next NHL draft.\nQuebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League Statistics\n• Discuss this story on the\nQuebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League message board...\nQuebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League Stories from April 18, 2024\nÉmile Chouinard and Jacob Newcombe win the Paul-Dumont Trophy- QMJHL Character and Compete Wanted from Ownership- Halifax Mooseheads Maxim Massé Wins the Michael-Bossy Trophy- QMJHL Change in Hockey Operations for Moncton Wildcats- Moncton Wildcats QMJHL announces finalists for the Kevin-Lowe Trophy- QMJHL\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.",

    "title": "SteamDB Leaks Are In Trouble As Private Branches Are Being Enabled On More Games",
    "text": "Modern gaming has increasingly allowed players to stay connected to the development process of their [favorite games and updates](https://www.ginx.tv/en/news). One key tool for this is SteamDB, which enables players to monitor game files and spot new content - even before official announcements.\nHowever, the growing use of private branches on SteamDB is starting to limit this behind-the-scenes access. Let’s delve into the details of this trend and what it means for players.\nGame Leaks May Start Drying Up As More Games Use Private Branches on SteamDB\nSince Steam's inception, players have used tools like SteamDB to track game updates and glean insights into developers' activities. SteamDB has been instrumental in highlighting subtle changes in game files, which often hint at upcoming content or updates. It’s also served as a valuable barometer for predicting new game releases, as developers typically update Steam pages more frequently as they approach launch.\nSteam is starting to enable 'private branches' in app info for some games, so SteamDB will not be able to track updates for these anymore.\n— SteamDB (@SteamDB)[pic.twitter.com/34YRSW8YkD][November 13, 2024]\nUnfortunately, a recent post [by SteamDB on X](https://x.com/SteamDB) revealed a troubling development: \"Steam is starting to enable 'private branches' in-app info for some games, so SteamDB will not be able to track updates for these anymore.\" While this change might seem minor to some, it could significantly limit one of the best tools players have for staying informed about game development and updates, particularly for highly anticipated titles.\nA prime example of this impact is [Hollow Knight: Silksong](https://www.ginx.tv/en/video-games/hollow-knight-silksong-rated-in-australia), the eagerly awaited sequel to the iconic Metroidvania Hollow Knight. Fans have been clamoring for news since the game’s announcement in 2019, and SteamDB updates—showing file changes or additions—have provided reassurance that the game is actively being developed. If Team Cherry opts for private branches, fans may lose one of their only sources of insight into the game’s progress.\nThe same can be said for games like [Elden Ring](https://www.ginx.tv/en/elden-ring) and its DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, where SteamDB updates sparked speculation and excitement among players eager for more details and release timelines.\nWhile data miners and leakers might still uncover some information, the shift to private branches could significantly reduce the amount of accessible data, leaving fans in the dark. For now, players can only hope that the adoption of private branches remains limited and that developers maintain transparency by keeping updates publicly visible. [These small windows](https://steamdb.info/) into development have been a cherished part of the gaming community’s connection to the games they love.",

    "title": "Falcao García eligió destino tras salir de Millonarios: ya entrenó y dijo \"no paramos\" - Semana",
    "text": "Aún permanece latente el dolor de la afición de Millonarios luego de que conociera de manera oficial que Falcao García no iba más y su renovación, había sido imposible de cara al 2025.“Luego de varias semanas de trabajo en donde se estructuró una importante oferta económica por parte del club, complementada con patrocinios, no se lograron contrarrestar los efectos fiscales por renta y patrimonio, los cuales no permitieron la continuidad de Radamel Falcao García ”, indicaba la misiva difundida por el cuadro azul al público en general.De parte del jugador, el pasado martes, cuando se produjo todo, hubo sentidas palabras: “No es fácil decirlo y mucho menos aceptarlo, pero por motivos ajenos a mi voluntad y la del club debo despedirme, siempre hubo una gran disposición de las dos partes, pero hay temas ajenos a lo deportivo que no podemos manejar y que impidieron mi continuidad”. Falcao lanza un “no paramos”En medio de todo ese cruce de información que se ha generado, quien apareció fue el protagonista primario. Lo hizo a través de sus redes sociales, con un video y agregándole la frase “no paramos”.Se trataba de un compilado de ejercicios en el que se le vio entrenando de manera individual, acompañado de profesionales.Entre los detalles que causaron relevancia en medio del video, fue el lugar en el que se encontraba el goleador colombiano. Su residencia ya no es en Bogotá o algún lugar de Colombia, rápidamente se pudo evidenciar que decidió un destino internacional que parecieran ser los Estados Unidos.“No se ilusionen”Intentando hacer seguimiento a la situación casi que en un minuto a minuto, luego quien apareció con una información más fue el periodista Antonio Casale, muy cercano al elenco azul, que de manera tajante dijo: “No se ilusionen”. Sobre lo que su colega radial mencionó en la mañana, aclaró: “A pesar del esfuerzo de Enrique Camacho, no se había conseguido el dinero”.Además de eso, confirmó que ante la negativa el pasado martes de Millonarios por hacer más esfuerzos, clubes contactaron al Tigre: “Empiezan a llegar opciones como la de Newels para jugar Copa Libertadores”. Luego de eso, fue algo más fulminante al decir: “Al martes Falcao solo pensaba en Millonarios, a hoy solo piensa en otras opciones y no solo en Millonarios”.“La plata no está. Todavía están buscando la plata”, acabó. Lo que da la razón al video del entrenamiento compartido en el Instagram de Falcao, donde demuestra que en caso de un ofrecimiento de otro club, podría jugar un tiempo más.Millonarios, por su parte, se mantiene en silencio desde la parte directiva, pero David González, entrenador, dio la cara por la situación: “Lo único que nosotros podemos decir, es que Millonarios está haciendo todo lo posible. Se han reanudado las conversaciones y todo es por parte del club”.“El club tiene el mayor de los intereses de que se pueda dar por todo lo que significa él”, sumó previo a tomar el vuelo rumbo a Santa Marta para el juego del debut en Liga del viernes, ante Unión Magdalena.",
