    "text": "Though innocuous on the surface, conspiracy theories abound down the TikTok rabbit hole. Graphic by Mira Fox\nBy Mira Fox January 25, 2024\nWhen I open TikTok, I mostly see cute videos of dogs, and inside jokes related to niche corners of my life — being a millennial living in Brooklyn with roommates, say, or working in journalism. There may be a few calming videos of cooking or crafts. The most problematic part of the app, for me, is its ability to hypnotize, making hours of my time vanish.\nYet according to an open letter Jewish creators on the platform released in November — which echoes what I’ve learned over several years of reporting —TikTok has an antisemitism problem, one critics say has reached new heights during the Israel-Hamas war. The CEO of the video app met with Jewish organizations and leaders in December to address concerns that it was driving and boosting antisemitism, and the issue has received extensive coverage .\nRelated Antisemitism on TikTok spiked 912% says a new study. But is it accurate? So why, in my own use of the app, have I stumbled on antisemitism so infrequently — when I know for a fact it’s there?\nForwarding the News Thoughtful, balanced reporting from the Forward and around the web, bringing you updated news and analysis of the crisis each day.\nTerms (Required) I agree to the Forward's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Email (Required) The answer is, on its surface, simple: I’m not into conspiracy theories. The platform knows this, and after years of use — I signed up for my personal account in 2020 — its algorithm knows what I want (and don’t want) to see. The app steers me away from antisemitism so assuredly that it’s sometimes hard to find even when I’m actively looking for it in my role as a journalist, instead of absent-mindedly scrolling as an everyday dog-lover.\nBut I know other casual users do encounter incredibly hateful speech, twisted conspiracy theories and antisemitic harassment on the platform. So I wanted to see what TikTok might show an average, young new user — whether it would spiral into hate speech, and just how it would get me there.\nTo get any idea of what kind of videos TikTok might be serving up to its average user, I couldn’t be me: a 32-year-old Jewish woman living in Brooklyn who listens to folksy Jewish heartthrob Noah Kahan and, as my algorithm has recently realized, used to ride horses.\nSo I started fresh. And it turned out that my ticket down the rabbit hole was news — something many TikTok users rely on the platform for. When I looked for analysis and explanations of the Israel-Hamas war, I fell into a nest of conspiracies.\nTikTok’s all-knowing algorithm The reason my TikTok feed is so wholesome is because of the app’s algorithm , which is famously so adept at determining each individual’s niche interests that people have declared that the app knew that they were gay before they themselves did .\nThe algorithm’s complexity means that everyone’s TikTok feed is different. The video app works differently than other social media sites like Facebook, Instagram or X, formerly Twitter, where users largely see posts from people they follow, perhaps with some trending posts mixed in. Instead, o n TikTok, users have little control over the videos they’re served. The main interface with the app is through the user’s homepage, called the For You Page — FYP for short — where they scroll through an infinite supply of videos served up by the app’s algorithm that play, one by one. A few might be from people they follow, but most won’t.\nRelated How Jewish TikTokers are trying to reclaim an antisemitic trend The FYP is populated by clips not-so-randomly chosen by an algorithm that watches users’ every move — noting not just what they like or comment on, but how long they linger on any given video, whether they play it through all the way, whether they click on a hashtag in its caption. Users are shown new videos based on inferences the algorithm has made about which posts are just similar enough to the ones they’ve already engaged with to stake a hold on their attention.\nEven when users try to find new content through specific searches, they’re subject to the algorithm’s decisions of which videos to pull up. Posts don’t appear in chronological order, or even order of popularity. “Suggested searches” — clickable terms the algorithm thinks a user might be interested in based on what they’re looking at — pop up on videos they’re watching or as they scroll through search results, to direct continued browsing. The algorithm shapes every part of your experience in the app.\nThe insidious issue with this algorithmic approach comes when it exposes people to radical ideologies when they’re not actively looking for — an issue that has also arisen with suggested videos on YouTube . But at least on YouTube, viewers have to click on a suggested video to watch it; on TikTok, most of the time, the video just appears in front of them.\nRelated How TikTok’s #MyJewishHeritage plan went horribly awry Video-based content is already difficult to effectively moderate, because problematic content might be showcased visually, without keywords an automated AI might be able to check. And TikTok users are known for inventing shorthand and coded language specifically to evade censorship. There’s corn — or even just a corn emoji — for discussing porn, or “seggs” for sex. In the world of antisemitism, “H!tl3r” or “that Austrian painter” helps users talk about Hitler without detection.\nCombine the ease with which these videos escape moderation with the absolute power of the algorithm and it means that, at least theoretically, certain innocuous choices might be enough to prompt the app to suddenly begin to feed you hateful content — even if you weren’t looking for it.\nThe average TikTok simulacrum To begin my experiment, I made a new profile, this one with a birthday in 2001 — the only information the app requests when you make a profile. Since concerns over TikTok users’ general youthfulness have been so prominent, I figured that I had better masquerade as Gen Z. I began to scroll, doing my best to move directly counter to my actual impulses to ensure I didn’t land, yet again, in DogTok. (TikTok niches often have nicknames like BookTok, which is about books, or FitTok, about fitness.)\nThe first video I saw was a clip of giant ships crashing through waves in a stormy North Sea. (For whatever reason, the dangerous waters of the North Sea are very viral right now on the app.) Then there was a makeup video, a few dances, some thirst traps. I was definitely seeing a part of TikTok that I don’t encounter on my regular account. But it was all innocuous and, if I’m being honest, boring. It was not immediately obvious how the app might choose to show me extremism of any kind.\nRelated An academic is breaking down antisemitic dog whistles on TikTok Eventually, a clip appeared of a woman, her hand over her face, with text scrolling across the screen about God. The caption read: “If yu [sic] wanna be able to love you’re gonna have to desire a strong relationship with Jesus b/c HE IS love.” The short video had 1.8 million likes, and I let it play a few times as I explored the comments. These consisted mostly of: “amen” and “God is good!” But a few comments asked other users to pray their same-sex attraction away. This was the closest I’d seen to anything remotely hateful or discriminatory.\nLingering on that post — letting it play several times as I read the comments — immediately impacted my algorithm; my feed began to fill with Christian preaching videos. But after several hours of concerted scrolling, wondering if being on Christian TikTok would ever bring me to, say, videos of Christians accusing Jews of killing Jesus, I realized I was getting nowhere interesting.\nAll the videos were inspirational, about how this video was meant to find you — yes, you! — because God loves you no matter what mistakes you may have made. That’s sweet, if not very compelling when you get 10 in a row. But mostly, it’s cheerfully bland. Mainstream Christian content, it seemed, was not going to lead me to extremism.\nBut once you begin viewing content about Judaism, and especially about Israel, that changes.\nSearching sideways While going fishing for antisemitism seemed like it would violate the terms of my experiment, I had to do something to expand my FYP past lip gloss and sermons. So I searched for videos about “Israel vs Palestine” — a suggested search that appeared as soon as I typed the first few letters of “Israel,” indicating its popularity on the app. (Actually, it suggested I spell it “Palatine,” which is either strategic censorship evasion or just a really common typo.)\nThe initial search produced largely normal videos — people arguing about the politics, sure, but a well-balanced split of opinions. But nestled in my results about the war, TikTok offered me a box of related search terms, including: “Judaism religion debunked.” Curious, I clicked.\nOne of the boxes of suggested searches TikTok prompted me with, including some sexualizing of Jewish women and a lot of theorizing about Satanism. Courtesy of TikTok This, it turns out, is one way to stumble down the rabbit hole. Choosing one slightly odd search suggestion was enough to lead me to more suggested searches offering increasingly out-there search terms. It didn’t take long to land in a nest of extremism.\nThe first video I was shown about “Judaism religion debunked” was a Christian explanation of why Jewish law is unnecessary given the existence of Jesus; basic Christian theology, really. But the second video was about the antisemitic Khazar conspiracy , a false belief that today’s Jews are “not real Jews” and are, instead, descended from a tribe in the Caucasus and now attempting to take over the world.\nThe video was actually debunking the conspiracy, although apparently unsuccessfully. In the comment section, nearly every user was arguing that the Khazar conspiracy is true.\nFrom here, I followed a path I imagined any curious user might; I searched for “Khazar.” After all, no matter how well-intentioned, efforts to debunk conspiracies can often instead serve to introduce them to new audiences and help them spread .\nThat search landed me in an endless feed of videos promoting the antisemitic conspiracy — preachers saying the Khazars are secret devil-worshippers; Hebrew Israelites accusing Jews of usurping their identity; fake historians pointing at maps explaining the origin of the Khazars.\nFrom there, I clicked on a hyperlinked suggested search term on the first video, which said “Benjamin Freedman knew this first.” This brought me to a series of videos reposting a 1961 speech by Freedman, a noted Holocaust denier, in which he alleges a “Zionist scheme” to start wars in an attempt to amass power.\nDown the rabbit hole From my first innocuous search about the war, it only took a few clicks to enter the world of antisemitic conspiracists. Doing so changed my entire feed.\nWhen I returned to my FYP, the posts had become increasingly conspiratorial; the inspirational sermons were gone. The videos I was receiving weren’t necessarily antisemitic, but they involved a lot of magical thinking and anti-government suspicion. There were posts alleging that the Mandela Effect is proof of a government psyop, and a series of videos claiming that police had covered up the appearance of giants walking the streets in Miami, which some users said were “nephilim” — biblical creatures that signify the impending apocalypse.\nAnd, as I continued to scroll, things got more Jewish. My FYP showed me a video of a rabbi discussing the concept of Jewish chosenness in a neutral way — it seemed mostly normal. But then I clicked the suggested search at the top of the comments, which was, oddly, “Jewish wrist,” which led me to videos about people tattooing numbers on their forearms. The suggested searches attached to those videos included options such as “fake Jews vs. real Jews” and “Ashkenazi Jewish witchcraft Satanism.”\nI’d come across a wealth of false antisemitic conspiracies. All the classics, really: blood libel, demon-worship, world-governing cabals.\nEven the comment sections on seemingly-innocuous videos that popped up on my FYP became increasingly full of antisemitism. On a video of a music duo singing a country song, users congratulated the singers for going viral and getting popular. But commenters also warned the folk musicians to avoid the “juice” once they got to Hollywood — clarifying in subsequent comments that “juice” meant “the joos,” or, yes, the Jews.\nCommenters having a normal one. (Adrenochrome is part of another conspiracy theory, this one most closely associated with QAnon.) Courtesy of TikTok Eventually, I began to see antisemitism appearing natively on my FYP. It wasn’t constant — there were still videos about the snow storms sweeping across the U.S. in January, girls complaining about bad breakups and videos about how oil pulling can whiten your teeth. But every few videos, I’d get someone talking about the secret powers controlling the government, or the mysterious, demonic families controlling the banks. Videos were peppered with references to a mysterious, all-powerful “they.”\nEven if the Jews weren’t named, it’s clear who they meant.\nSo is TikTok antisemitic or not? As I found my way into the world of TikTok antisemitism, I did my best to behave as I thought an average person might — someone who isn’t predisposed toward conspiracy theories or antisemitism, but who doesn’t know much about how to avoid them, either.\nIt’s certainly possible to never end up in an extreme corner of TikTok; my FYP could have easily remained a bland, infinite stream of dances and make-up tutorials and sermons. Still, it’s just as easy to land in a nest of conspiracy theories simply by looking for videos about the news.\nI never searched directly for antisemitism, conspiracies or hate speech. But if the app suggested the idea to me initially, then I went along with it.\nSure, the first video on the Khazar conspiracy I got wasn’t endorsing it, but if I were someone who had never heard of Khazars before, I might want to learn more by searching for the term — at which point I’d see hundreds of videos arguing for the conspiracy’s truth. And so on.\nI asked Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, why social media platforms continue, after years of criticism, to enable conspiratorial spirals like this.\n“Their business is keeping you on the platform, so they prioritize things that capture your attention,” he said. “A conspiratorial mind is fertile ground for algorithmic cross-fertilization, deepening and broadening.” The more time a user spends engaged, the more revenue the platform makes. So once the algorithm has figured out that one conspiracy theory holds your attention, it tries to show you more — maybe you’ll enjoy a new conspiracy you’ve never heard of.\nRelated opinion Young Americans are turning against Israel — and you can thank TikTok This means that even simple curiosity about a conspiracy theory can immediately embed a user in a world in which every video is arguing that there are secrets in the world. It trains users in the kind of rampant suspicion and conspiratorial thinking that can guide them farther down the rabbit hole.\nSure, other social media platforms can suggest these ideas too — X offers a list of trending terms, and if the Talmud is trending because people are posting about how it’s full of evil secrets, users will get introduced to that idea.\nBut at least on X, those conspiracies have to be fairly mainstream to make much of an impact. On TikTok, if you demonstrate even the slightest interest, the app is happy to guide you further into the world of conspiracies. You can suddenly land on a nest of videos with just a few hundred likes — barely anything in the world of TikTok — but the algorithm will still bring you there if you follow its suggestions.\nAnd once you do, they’ll become inescapable; videos about Jewish devil-worship will pop up between videos about the perfect scrambled egg as though they’re just as plebeian, teaching you conspiratorial thinking alongside cooking techniques.\n“We call that rabbit-holing,” Ahmed said. “But the platforms just call it, basically, a captive audience.”\nMira Fox is a reporter at the Forward.

    "text": "EE.UU. emite alerta de tormenta geomagnética severa que alcanzará la tierra este viernes Los vientos solares que se mueven directamente hacia la Tierra a casi 800 kilómetros por segundo alcanzarán el planeta hacia las 20:00 hora del este Una tormenta geomagnética, causada por una serie de erupciones solares y que podría ser la más severa desde 2005, alcanzará la Tierra este viernes al anochecer, según informó la Oficina Nacional de Administración Oceánica y Atmosférica (NOAA, en inglés). \"Tenemos por delante un acontecimiento muy, muy raro\", dijo en una conferencia de prensa Shawn Dahl, coordinador en el Centro de Predicción del Clima Espacial (SWPC, en inglés) en Boulder, Colorado. Los vientos solares que se mueven directamente hacia la Tierra a casi 800 kilómetros por segundo alcanzarán el planeta hacia las 20:00 hora del este (24:00 GMT) \"Hemos notificado a los operadores de infraestructura crítica, incluidas las comunicaciones, los satélites y las plantas de energía eléctrica\", añadió el funcionario. SWPC ha alertado también a la Agencia de Gestión de Emergencias (FEMA), pero no espera \"un colapso pasivo catastrófico\". Las tormentas geomagnéticas, explicó el portavoz, pueden tener impacto en la infraestructura orbital terrestre y en la superficie de la Tierra con el potencial de interferir con las comunicaciones, la red de energía eléctrica, la navegación y las operaciones de radio y de satélites. La serie de erupciones comenzó el 8 de mayo y las condiciones para la tormenta persista podrían durar todo el fin de semana. \"Una gran mancha solar ha producido erupciones desde moderadas a muy fuertes desde el miércoles\", señaló la agencia. \"Al menos cinco de esas erupciones estuvieron asociadas con eyecciones de masa de la corona solar que parecen dirigidas hacia la Tierra\". Estas eyecciones son explosiones de plasma y campos magnéticos en la corona solar que causan tormentas geomagnéticas cuando ocurren en dirección a la Tierra, explicó NOAA. La gran mancha solar ha lanzado una secuencia asombrosa de cinco eyecciones de masa solar hacia la Tierra, según la plataforma Spacewather.com, que estima que, si se tratara de un huracán, sería de categoría 4.",

El Gobierno de [Estados Unidos ](https://www.wradio.com.co/tag/estados_unidos/a/)emitió este jueves 27 de junio sanciones contra tres compañías de [Emiratos Árabes Unidos](https://www.wradio.com.co/tag/emiratos_arabes/a/) involucradas en el transporte de petróleo iraní o productos petroquímicos y bloqueó once buques vinculados a esas empresas. Lea también: El Departamento de Estado justificó esa decisión en respuesta a una “continua escalada nuclear”, alegando que en el último mes [ Irán](https://www.wradio.com.co/tags/iran-a/) ha anunciado “medidas para ampliar aún más su programa nuclear en formas que no tienen ningún propósito pacífico creíble”. “Las acciones de Irán para aumentar su capacidad de enriquecimiento son aún más preocupantes a la luz de la continua falta de cooperación de Irán con el Organismo Internacional de Energía Atómica (OIEA) y las declaraciones de funcionarios iraníes que sugieren posibles cambios en la doctrina nuclear de Irán”, dijo en un comunicado el secretario de Estado, [Antony Blinken.](https://www.wradio.com.co/tag/antony_blinken/a/) Las tres empresas sancionadas son Sea Route Ship Management FZE, Almanac Ship Management LLC y Al Anchor Ship Management FZE. Como resultado de las sanciones, quedan bloqueadas las propiedades y activos que esas personas o empresas tengan en territorio estadounidense, y se prohíbe a los estadounidenses tener transacciones con ellos. “Seguimos comprometidos a no permitir nunca que Irán obtenga un [ arma nuclear](https://www.wradio.com.co/tags/armas-nucleares-a/) y estamos dispuestos a utilizar todos los elementos del poder nacional para garantizar ese resultado. (...) Irán debe cesar sus escaladas con respecto a su programa nuclear, así como sus otras acciones desestabilizadoras”, concluyó Blinken.",

    "text": "He used his Make-A-Wish request to redo his school’s weight room. Now the Vikings are sending him to the Super Bowl\nBy Mike Max\nClick here for updates on this story\nPRINCETON, Minnesota (\nWCCO) — Carter Julson, 13, received a heart transplant two years ago, after his parents noticed that he wasn’t able to keep up with his friends in sports.\n“We just sensed something wasn’t right,” said his father Brian Julson.\n“For a long time, I was just going about, didn’t know anything was wrong, and my mom just wanted to make sure because she had read about this disease, and I kind of had some of the symptoms,” said Carter Julson.\nThen in 2019, doctors discovered he had cardiomyopathy, a disease that impacts the heart muscle. It was a shock for the family.\nBut he found a donor, and his life changed.\n“I’ll never forget it – the call came on the 29th of March. And he was in surgery that Tuesday, the following day.” said Brian Julson.\n“It means the world that what the donor had to go through and their family, just that sacrifice that happened, like knowing that is just really tough. But I’m so thankful that I can do my sports and keep up with my friends and be with my family so it means the world,” Carter Julson said.\nCarter Julson became a part of the Make-A-Wish Program. But instead of going on a trip, or asking for something for himself, he instead asked to re-do the weight room at Princeton High School. He got to design the floor and the types of weights in the room. And, he chose to add a tiger mural to the wall — the school mascot — to symbolize strength.\nBut the story doesn’t end there. The Minnesota Vikings got word of his kind deed and invited him out to practice.\nAnd after the practice, the Vikings surprised him with two tickets to the Super Bowl.\n“I couldn’t believe what was happening,” Carter Julson said.\nNow, Carter Julson is a three sport athlete. He plays basketball, football, and baseball.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.
