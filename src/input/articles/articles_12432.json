    "text": "the Hidden Bias in Fitness Tracking: Why Current Devices Fail People with obesity Published: June 20, 2025\nThe Problem with Existing Technology For millions striving to improve their health, fitness trackers have become ubiquitous tools. However, a notable flaw exists within these devices: their consistent underestimation of energy expenditure in individuals with obesity. This inaccuracy isn’t merely a technical glitch; it’s a barrier to effective weight management and overall well-being. According to the CDC, over 42% of adults in the United States are considered obese, representing a ample population potentially misled by flawed data. The consequences range from discouragement and reduced motivation to potentially harmful adjustments in diet and exercise routines based on incorrect information.\nThe core issue lies in the algorithms used by most trackers, which are often calibrated using data from individuals with a healthy weight. These algorithms don’t adequately account for the physiological differences present in bodies with higher body mass, such as increased metabolic demands and altered movement patterns. This leads to a systematic underreporting of calories burned, creating a distorted picture of actual energy output.\nA Personal Revelation Sparks Innovation The impetus for a groundbreaking solution arose from a deeply personal experience. A scientist, observing his mother-in-law diligently participating in an exercise class, noticed a stark disconnect between her visible effort and the results displayed on the class’s fitness leaderboard. Her exertion simply wasn’t reflected in the data.This observation ignited a research project aimed at rectifying this widespread problem.\n“Fitness trackers often fail people with obesity by underestimating their energy burn, leading to discouraging results and misguided health data.”\nResearcher’s statement regarding the core issue.\nThis initial frustration evolved into a focused examination, ultimately leading to the development of a novel algorithm by a team at Northwestern University.The team recognized that a one-size-fits-all approach to energy expenditure calculation was fundamentally flawed and that a more nuanced methodology was required.\nA New Algorithm for Inclusive Health Tracking The team’s solution is an open-source smartwatch algorithm specifically designed to accurately measure energy expenditure in individuals with obesity. Unlike existing methods, this algorithm incorporates a more comprehensive understanding of the biomechanical and metabolic factors that influence calorie burn in this population. Think of it like tailoring a map – a standard map works for general navigation, but a topographical map is essential for accurately charting mountainous terrain. This new algorithm provides that topographical detail for the complexities of energy expenditure in individuals with obesity.\nrigorous testing has demonstrated that the new algorithm’s performance rivals that of gold-standard laboratory equipment used for measuring metabolic rate. This level of accuracy represents a significant leap forward in health technology,offering the potential to empower individuals with obesity to make informed decisions about their health and fitness.\n“His team at Northwestern developed a new open-source smartwatch algorithm that accurately captures energy expenditure for individuals with obesity, rivaling gold-standard lab equipment and paving the way for more inclusive, empowering health tracking.”\nDescription of the algorithm’s capabilities and impact.\nThe Path Forward: Open Source and Accessibility The decision to release the algorithm as open-source is a crucial element of this innovation. By making the code freely available, the team hopes to accelerate its adoption by fitness tracker manufacturers and app developers, ultimately leading to more inclusive and accurate health tracking for a wider population. This collaborative approach fosters innovation and ensures that the benefits of this research are accessible to all, not just those who can afford premium devices or specialized services. The team is actively seeking partnerships to integrate the algorithm into existing platforms and explore further refinements based on real-world user data.",

    "text": "With the Baltimore Orioles franchise in an upward swing, it seems the CEO John Angelos does not want to relinquish his control of the team despite it being his father’s wish upon his death.\nAfter five straight losing seasons, including three years with over 100 losses, the process has finally worked and the Baltimore Orioles are relevant again. They stunned the baseball world in 2022 by finally making the jump to being a competitive team once again. Then in 2023, they evolved into a full-fledged contender.\nRelated:\nRevisiting MLB Free-Agent Contract Disasters: What’s The Worst Signing Each Year For The Past Decade?\nHeading into 2024, Baltimore has a team built to be good for years to come and has the cap flexibility and assets to further improve the roster. All the work that the Angelos family put into bringing the franchise back to relevancy has finally paid off. And with their brand as strong as it has been in a long time it could be a perfect moment to sell.\nIt is something that has been rumored in MLB circles recently, and billionaire David Rubenstein is a potential buyer. Furthermore, a sale is reportedly something that owner Peter Angelos wants to happen after he passes away. That could come soon with the 94-year-old battling health issues in recent years.\nJohn Angelos does not want to sell the Baltimore Orioles\nHowever, it seems that his eldest son John — the organization’s chairman and CEO — has no interest in letting the franchise slip out of the family’s control. On Wednesday, the\nWall Street Journal reported that a battle over the future of the Baltimore Orioles could be brewing inside the Angelos family.\n“John Angelos has indicated privately that he intends to keep the club moving forward, potentially throwing the future of the franchise into turmoil,” the Wall Street Journal claims.\nRelated:\nNew York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers could soon engage in 2nd bidding war for a top free agent pitcher\nThe Orioles are currently valued at\n$1.7 billion. With the value of owning a sports team in North America on a heavy upward swing, that number could certainly increase if Baltimore has another strong season in 2024. It was recently reported that Carlyle Group Inc. co-founder and Baltimore native David Rubenstein is currently in talks to purchase the team.\nHowever, it’s believed that John Angelos has informed Maryland officials the franchise is not for sale.",

    "text": "Peruvian Comedy Icon ‘ Yuca ‘ Battles Serious Illness A Nation Holds its Breath for Enrique ‘Yuca’ Espejo Lima, Peru – July 2, 2024 – Beloved Peruvian comedian and actor Enrique “Yuca” Espejo is facing a critical health challenge, prompting widespread concern throughout the country.The news, shared by his brother and fellow entertainer Alfredo Benavides, has cast a shadow over the Peruvian entertainment industry, a sector where Espejo has been a prominent figure for generations.\nPeru has a strong tradition of comedic performance, with figures like Espejo becoming deeply ingrained in the national culture. Similar to the impact of Charlie chaplin in the United States or lucille Ball in the UK, Espejo’s work has provided decades of laughter and entertainment for Peruvian families. The current situation is notably poignant given his long-standing connection with the public.\nGrim Prognosis Revealed by Family Benavides’ statements paint a sobering picture of Espejo’s condition. He revealed the severity of the situation, stating, “only a miracle will make ‘Yuca’ stand up.” This declaration has fueled anxieties among fans and colleagues alike. While the precise details of Espejo’s illness remain private, the repeated invocation of a “miracle” suggests a profoundly arduous medical scenario.\nSources close to the family have confirmed that a return to television is not anticipated in the near future. This is a significant loss for Peruvian television, where Espejo’s appearances consistently drew high ratings and positive audience engagement. The absence of such a recognizable face will undoubtedly be felt by viewers.\nPersonal matters Emerge Amidst Health Concerns In recent interviews, Benavides also touched upon past personal relationships, recounting a previous romantic connection with Gabriela Serpa and her reported reaction to his shared kiss with Roxana Molina. He explained that Serpa expressed jealousy when he shared a kiss with Roxana Molina. While these anecdotes have garnered some media attention, they are largely overshadowed by the overwhelming concern for Espejo’s health and well-being.\nThe juxtaposition of these personal revelations with the gravity of Espejo’s illness highlights the complexities of public life and the challenges faced by individuals navigating both professional and private struggles under intense scrutiny. It’s a reminder that even those who bring joy to others are not immune to personal hardships.\nAwaiting Further Updates The Peruvian public is united in sending support and hoping for a positive outcome for Enrique “Yuca” Espejo. As of today, July 2, 2024, the situation remains critical. further updates will be provided as they become available.",

    "text": "Playground equipment stolen from East Troy park returned Updated: Aug. 19, 2024 WALWORTH COUNTY, Wis. (CBS 58) -- Mystery solved. The toy train that disappeared from a playground in the Town of East Troy is back. Police say someone anonymously dropped it off Monday, Aug. 19. \"There was a lot of criticism for the individual that took it,\" said Chrystal Bishop, who lives nearby. Social media blew up after someone swiped what was about to be the newest addition to the Jim Burns Memorial Park, with comments like, \"come on, do better\" and \"what's wrong with people?\" \"And kind of creating that indirect pressure that we better return this and get it done in a hurry,\" said Town of East Troy Police Chief Alan Gorecki. Chief Alan Gorecki says the little red train was reported missing last week. \"And we checked the park and checked the area,\" said Chief Gorecki. Park users tell us the red train had been sitting just off the walking path, several feet from where the rest of the new playground equipment had been installed weeks earlier. \"Everything was laying on the side over there for quite some time. So I understand why someone might have thought it was gonna be junked or thrown away,\" said Bishop. But Highway Department Superintendent Todd Scheel says it should've been clear the little red train, shiny and new, was not being thrown away. It was part of the new installation that they'd repeatedly publicized on the town's Facebook page. \"Yeah, we published the heck out of it. This was actually separated from the concrete base. How somebody would've taken that it was junk just by looking at it, I don't know,\" said Scheel. That security camera is facing the only way out of the park. After all of this, the chief says he'd like to install a camera right on the park. \"I was shocked when I walked out our shop door and seen it sitting there. I'm like hmm, pressure finally got to somebody. I'm just glad it's back. I'm glad the kids will be able to enjoy it,\" said Scheel. Now that it's been returned, the case is closed. \"No questions asked. It was returned. It was returned in perfect condition, and it's been reinstalled at the park and the kids have already been playing on it,\" said Chief Gorecki. Published: Aug. 15, 2024 WALWORTH COUNTY, Wis. (CBS 58) -- The Town of East Troy Police Department is asking for your help, as they believe someone may be behind the disappearance of a beloved toy at a public playground. When crews tasked with replacing the equipment at the Jim Byrnes Memorial Park arrived for work earlier in the week, they noticed a red train toy that had been waiting to get reinstalled wasn't anywhere to be found. \"When we were starting to dig holes to set it up, we noticed that we were missing a piece,\" said Highway Dept. Superintendent Todd Scheel, who noted the toy is about two feet wide and two feet long. That's when they decided to notify the nearby police department. \"I got a call from the highway shop supervisor, saying we're missing a train,\" recalled Chief Alan Gorecki. “I drove the park and then I walked some of the areas where I thought, eh, maybe they threw it back here hiding, just trying to play a prank on us, but we weren’t able to come up with it.” So, he turned to Facebook, [posting about the theft on social media](https://www.facebook.com/tetpd/posts/pfbid0NERfMvm5W3pup6gUvmakQSq9PsmCMVK48c8efL87x7g46MkbqXUuJoi7H5EHoNQ2l) to get the word out. Gorecki noted that while the toy had been placed to the side of a trail surrounding the playground area, \"it was pretty obvious it was in good working condition.\" “If they thought it was set aside and gonna be placed in a trash, why not ask?\" Gorecki said. \"It's just not right.\" Scheel agreed, adding that the park is a community hotspot for many. “Seeing how many people use this park, I mean on a daily basis, people walking their dogs, people just out for a general walk,\" Scheel said. \"How could somebody come and take something for a little kid?\" Police confirmed they have security camera footage that overlooks the park and that a dark SUV could be a potential suspect vehicle. “We are working on it and if we do come up with the plate, we are going to pursue that,\" Gorecki said. As for now? They're hoping someone will return the toy to its rightful spot. “You’re hurting everybody else by taking it,\" Scheel said. \"You’re taking some kid's joy away.”",

    "title": "Victorious Naomi Osaka Sets Sights on WTA Big Names Following Miami Open Comeback",
    "text": "Breaking her streak of winless matches post the Australian Open, Naomi Osaka has roared back into form at the Miami Open held at the Hard Rock Stadium. The Japanese tennis star made a significant comeback, indicating her readiness to lock horns with the “big dogs” of the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA).\nOsaka’s resurgence adds an exciting twist to the WTA landscape. It’s a bold statement from a player who’s had a challenging start to the year. After her victory at the Australian Open, she found herself mired in a series of lacklustre performances, which cast a cloud over her future in the game. However, her recent win shows that she’s far from done.\nNotably, it’s not just about the win for Osaka. Her eagerness to face the top players in the WTA circuit speaks volumes about her competitive spirit and hunger for success. It’s clear she’s not just content with her victory in Miami; she’s looking to build on it and continue her ascent in women’s tennis.\nOsaka’s performance at the Miami Open has certainly set the stage for some thrilling showdowns in the future. Her competitors should be on guard, for her appetite for victory seems to have been rekindled.\nIn a sport that’s as much about mental fortitude as it is about physical prowess, Osaka’s recent win is a testament to her resilience. The tennis world will undoubtedly be watching her next moves closely. After all, if her performance in Miami is anything to go by, we can expect to see more of the fiery competitor that catapulted her to global stardom.\nIn conclusion, Naomi Osaka’s return to form at the Miami Open could mark the beginning of an exciting chapter in her tennis career. Her willingness to take on the WTA’s top players, combined with her renewed self-belief, could see her reclaiming her spot at the top of the game. And if her performance in Miami is an indication of her future trajectory, her competitors have every reason to be wary.",
