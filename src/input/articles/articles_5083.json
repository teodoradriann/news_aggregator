    "text": "- By Kamakshi Bishnoi\n- Published: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 06:11 PM (IST)\n- Source:JND\nMaha Kumbh 2025: Reacting to the ongoing uproar over West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s controversial remark about the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati, the 46th Shankaracharya of the Jyotish Peeth in Uttarakhandhas extended his support to CM Banerjee and slammed the UP government over alleged mismanagement during the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj.\n“False propaganda was spread, the talk of 144 years itself is a lie. Crowd management and hospitality principles were not followed. Even when people died, they tried to hide it, which was a grave crime. In such a situation, if someone calls it names, then we won't be able to oppose it,\" Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati said referring to Mamata Banerjee’s remarks.\nWATCH: Swami Video\n— ANI (@ANI)\n[#WATCH]| Bemetara, Chhattisgarh: On West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's 'Mrityu Kumbh' remark, Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati Maharaj says, \"... There was a traffic jam of 300 kilometres, if this is not mismanagement then what is it? People had to walk…[pic.twitter.com/pxDXWI5og7][February 19, 2025]\nRaising the issue of Ganga water, Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati said, \"There was a traffic jam of 300 kilometres. If this is not mismanagement, then what is it? People had to walk 25-30 km with their luggage. The water coming for bathing is mixed with sewage water and the scientists don't consider it fit for bathing, yet you are forcing crores of people to bathe in it.\"\nREAD MORE: CM Adityanath Chides Mamata Banerjee Over 'Mrityu Kumbh' Remark, Calls Out Oppn's Criticism Of Mahakumbh\n\"Your job was to either stop the drains for a few days or divert them so that people could get pure water while bathing... You knew 12 years ago that the Maha Kumbh would come after 12 years, why did you not make any effort in this regard?\" he said, as quoted by news agency ANI.\nMamata Banerjee on Tuesday, accused the Uttar Pradesh government of mishandling the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, alleging that the biggest religious event has turned into \"Mrityu Kumbh.\" Banarjee’s statement addressed the Prayagraj Stampede that took place during the ongoing Mahakumbh 2025, in which at least 30 got killed while several others sustained injuries.\n“Maha Kumbh has turned into ‘Mrityu Kumbh’. I respect Maha Kumbh, and I respect the holy Ganga Maa. But there is no planning. How many people have been rescued? For the rich and VIPs, there are systems in place to get camps (tents) for as much as Rs 1 lakh. But for the poor, there are no arrangements at Kumbh,\" the Chief Minister said while addressing the Budget Session of the West Bengal Assembly.\nIn response to Banerjee’s statement on Tuesday, the BJP legislators have referred to her as a ‘Hindu virodhi mukhyamantri’ (anti-Hindu chief minister). They stated that the purported insult to the Maha Kumbh would not be condoned by the Indian people.\nREAD MORE: Woman Breaks Internet With Her Shocking Discovery At Mahakumbh Mela | Video Goes Viral",

    "title": "Zebra Mussels invade Midland's water system, causing pressure issues | newswest9.com",
    "text": "MIDLAND, Texas — An unexpected invader is contributing to Midland’s low water pressure : zebra mussels. The invasive species, known for wreaking havoc on lakes and rivers across North America, has now made its way into the Permian Basin—causing disruptions at the Midland Water Treatment Plant.\n“At the same time, we’ve had zebra mussels at our water treatment plant here in town,” Midland Mayor Lori Blong said in a press conference earlier this week.\nBut what exactly are zebra mussels, and how are they affecting the local water supply?\nZebra mussels are small, bivalve mollusks that thrive in freshwater environments by attaching themselves to surfaces such as rocks, boats, and pipes.\n“A zebra mussel is a little mollusk,” said Michael Nickell with the Sibley Nature Center in Midland. “It’s a little bivalve clam-like thing.”\nWhile they are commonly found in lakes and rivers, their presence in Midland’s water system is surprising, given the city’s location in the arid Permian Basin. Experts say they likely arrived through human activity.\n“People take their boats out for recreation, or for that matter, large ships can pick up these larvae—and even adult zebra mussels—and transport them across the ocean,” Nickell explained. “Now, they’re widespread across North America, and they get into municipal water supplies. If your water supply comes from a body of water like a lake, there’s going to be a risk.”\nZebra mussels reproduce rapidly.\n“The female releases her eggs into the water. The male releases his sperm, and fertilization takes place in the water,” Nickell said. “The little larvae are carried by water currents. They can go from water body to water body just following the currents.”\nBecause of this, the mussels can spread quickly, clinging to boats, trailers, and fishing gear.\n“Mussels will typically attach themselves to boats, trailers, and fishing gear,” Nickell said. “From there, the open water is their oyster.”\nThe City of Midland has been working to filter and treat water from the Colorado River before distributing it through the system. However, zebra mussels pose a serious threat due to their ability to clog infrastructure.\n“They outcompete our native freshwater mussel species,” Nickell said. “And they do a lot of ecological and municipal damage by just clogging things up.”\nDespite their destructive nature, zebra mussels do have one surprising effect on the environment.\n“They’re filter feeders, so as water passes through them, they actually help clean it,” Nickell said.\nBut their benefits are outweighed by the damage they cause, as their populations remain unchecked.\n“They have impacts on the environment as far as cleaning water,” Nickell added. “But their numbers are so great and really unchecked. And so, they do a lot of tremendous damage that way.”\nOnce zebra mussels take hold, they are difficult—if not impossible—to remove completely. The best way to prevent their spread is to clean and dry boats and fishing gear before moving between bodies of water.\n“The best thing boaters can do is keep boats and gear clean and dry,” Nickell emphasized.\nThe City of Midland said crews and engineers are actively working through the issues, with the goal of restoring normal water pressure by the end of the week.\nClose Ad",

    "text": "In the first leg of the Conference League playoffs, Servette lost 2-0 to Chelsea. After the break, Geneva were on the losing track due to a penalty and missed many chances at the end. FC St. Gallen plays against Trabzonspor 0:0. In a week’s match against Chelsea in the second leg of the Conference League playoffs, Servette needs a small miracle to advance to the group stage like they did last season. The Genevans put in a good performance away at Stamford Bridge and had a few good chances, especially in the closing stages. But as so often in recent months on the European stage, the Genevans were unlucky in the final stages.\nFrick in the spotlight several times After a balanced first half without any major upsets, things really got going in the first few minutes after the break. First, Servette keeper Jérémy Frick brought down Christopher Nkunku in the penalty area – a penalty was awarded. The fouled player did not miss this chance and hammered the ball into the left corner (50′).\nA few seconds after the restart, Frick, who is allowed to guard Geneva’s goal in the European Cup and the national cup, was back in the spotlight. The goalie lost the ball 25 meters from the goal and Marc Guiu was able to head towards the empty goal alone. But the 18-year-old new signing from Spain managed to play the ball towards the goal with so little pressure that Frick was able to parry the shot. Frick also defused the two follow-up shots.\nIn the 76th minute, the English finally made it 2-0. Noni Madueke beat Frick in the near corner after a nice pass from Enzo Fernandez. With relatively little effort, Chelsea’s million-euro team, in which ex-Basel player Renato Veiga played the whole way, achieved relatively high results.\nGeneva chances galore in the final minutes As a result, Chelsea practically stopped playing football and made many inaccurate mistakes in their own half. This gave Servette numerous chances – some of them top-class. But it was not the first time that it became clear that coach Thomas Häberli’s team was lacking a goalscorer in attack.\nSubstitute Jérémy Guillemenot (80th minute), Tiemoko Ouattara, who also came off the bench, with his shot that hit the crossbar (86th minute), Julian von Moos (90th minute) and Guillemenot again (96th minute) all missed excellent opportunities. However, the goal that Servette deserved was not scored. The Genevans were badly served with a 2-0 defeat, and the return match turned into a mammoth task.\nThis is how it continues Like the other Swiss European Cup participants, Servette has no game in the Super League this weekend. The reunion with Chelsea will take place next Thursday at the Stade de Genève. Kick-off is at 8:30 p.m., SRF will broadcast live from 8:20 p.m.",
