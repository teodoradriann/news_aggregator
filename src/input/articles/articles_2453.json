    "title": "Biden warns democracy ‘at risk’ as leaders mark D-Day",
    "text": "OMAHA BEACH, France: US President Joe Biden on Thursday warned on the 80th anniversary of D-Day that democracy around the world was at risk, as leaders marked the 1944 landings in occupied France that helped defeat Nazi Germany in World War II. Haunted by today´s war in Europe following Russia´s invasion of Ukraine, Biden, Britain´s King Charles III, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to the tens of thousands of Allied troops who stormed the beaches of Normandy in northern France on June 6, 1944. The commemorations also provided a hugely symbolic backdrop to talks on how Kyiv can regain ground after Russian advances, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attending an international ceremony with all the leaders. Biden said D-Day showed the need for international alliances and vowed never to abandon Ukraine in its fight against Russia, in a pointed swipe at his election rival ex-president Donald Trump who has publicly questioned the importance of organisations such as Nato. “We´re living in a time when democracy is more at risk across the world than at any point since the end of World War II,” Biden said. “Isolationism was not the answer 80 years ago and is not the answer today,” he said. “Real alliances make us stronger -- a lesson that I pray we Americans never forget.” Biden also vowed that, under his leadership, the United States “will not walk away” from Ukraine “because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there”. “Ukraine´s neighbours will be threatened, all of Europe will be threatened,” he added, describing Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “tyrant bent on domination”. He said that to surrender to bullies or “bow down to dictators” is “simply unthinkable”. Kyiv has been pushing Europe to up its military support, with Russia in recent months gaining the upper hand on the battlefield and concerns growing over what a Trump presidency could mean for the conflict. “Allies defended Europe´s freedom then, and Ukrainians do so now. Unity prevailed then, and true unity can prevail today,” Zelensky said in a post on X. Arriving at the ceremony he shook hands with wheelchair-bound veterans, bowing down in respect to them.

    "title": "Chargers News: Jim Harbaugh's NFL Comeback with Los Angeles",
    "text": "By Jake Faigus ,\n2 hours ago\nJim Harbaugh is back in the NFL, and he’s ready to make an impact as the new head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers .\nAfter wrapping up his first training camp, he welcomed his parents to watch him lead the team during their preseason finale against the Dallas Cowboys.\nHarbaugh, who played for the Chargers in the late 1990s, is no stranger to the NFL. His coaching career has taken him from the University of San Diego to Stanford, the San Francisco 49ers, and most recently, the University of Michigan, where he achieved significant success. Now, he’s focused on building a winning culture in Los Angeles.\nSince his hiring in January, Harbaugh has emphasized hard work and dedication. He thrives in the football environment, constantly seeking challenges and opportunities to improve.\nHis enthusiasm is palpable, and it’s clear he’s excited to be back in the league.\n\"I love to work. I love working and having something to work on,\" Harbaugh said . \"I sit at my desk and hope somebody brings me something to work on.\n\"To get to do it in this kind of environment with these spectacular people, it's inspiring. It really is,\" Harbaugh continued . \"So much to do, so much to learn. I feel like I'm on my feet all day. I've got stuff to do.\nHe later added : \"Dare I say it, I'm having fun.\"\nThe Chargers organization is buzzing with energy, and the excitement is evident among fans and players alike. Team owner Dean Spanos has noted a renewed sense of optimism surrounding the franchise, attributing it to Harbaugh’s presence.\n\"This would be an understatement, but I haven't been this excited in a long time,\" Spanos said . \"I see it in the community, I see it in the organization from our staff to our players and our coaches. It's electrifying.\n\"I think Jim being here has brought a sense of awareness about our team … and I think the fans are so excited about that,\" Spanos added . \"You see it everywhere you go.\"\nAs the Chargers prepare for the 2024 season, Harbaugh brings a strong track record, boasting a winning percentage that ranks among the best in the NFL. He’s hungry for another shot at a championship after previously leading the 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance.\nWhile he recently celebrated a national title with Michigan, Harbaugh is eager to chase another championship in the NFL.\n\"I only have so many sands left in the hourglass and I want another shot,\" Harbaugh said . \"I want another shot to be simply known as World Champions. The Lombardi Trophy, that's my mission.\"\nHis competitive spirit drives him, and he’s determined to unite the team in pursuit of their goals.\nHarbaugh’s coaching staff includes familiar faces who have witnessed his leadership style firsthand. They recognize his commitment to team building and his relentless drive to succeed.\nMinter, who was with Harbaugh at Michigan, described him as \"one of the most elite leaders in all of sports.\"\n\"Some people have hobbies and different things to get their mind off things. Football is his job and his hobby,\" Minter said . \"Team building is his job and his hobby. He pours everything he has into that.\"\nRoman was asked if he thought Harbaugh would flip some sort of switch as the regular season draws near.\n\"Jim flipped the switch many years ago,\" said Roman , who was Harbaugh's offensive coordinator in San Francisco. \"And it stayed flipped. It stuck.\n\"He's going all the time. It's one of the reasons he's been so great over the years,\" Roman added . \"I don't really notice much difference, he's on all the time. That's Jim. One of the reasons we love him.\"\nAs the regular season approaches, Harbaugh’s focus remains clear. He’s not just content to be back in the NFL; he’s here to win.\nThe Chargers are gearing up for their opener against the Raiders, and Harbaugh’s passion for the game will undoubtedly motivate the team.\nWith his return, the Chargers are poised for an exciting season. Harbaugh’s dedication and experience could be the catalyst for a successful campaign in Los Angeles.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Boeing enfrenta greve após rejeição de acordo por sindicato | ADVFN News",
    "text": "Os trabalhadores da Boeing ( NYSE:BA ) entraram em greve pela primeira vez em 16 anos, após 94,6% dos membros do sindicato rejeitarem a oferta de contrato. A paralisação envolve mais de 33.000 funcionários da fábrica de Renton, perto de Seattle, responsável pela produção do popular 737 Max. A ação interrompe a fabricação e afeta a extensa rede de fornecedores.\nA Boeing também é negociada na B3 através da BDR ( BOV:BOEI34 ).\nAs ações da Boeing estão em queda de 0,5% no momento que este artigo foi escrito , uma melhora de uma queda mais acentuada no pré-mercado.\nA greve aumenta as dificuldades financeiras da empresa, que já enfrentava desafios com lapsos de qualidade e investigações recentes. A greve gera pressão adicional sobre a Boeing, que busca equilibrar suas operações com uma dívida de US$ 45 bilhões.\nOs líderes sindicais justificaram a greve com base em 16 anos de salários estagnados, aumento dos custos de saúde e eliminação de bônus anuais. Mesmo com a oferta de um aumento salarial de 25%, os trabalhadores esperavam melhores termos, o que agravou a insatisfação.\nApesar da greve, a Boeing sinalizou estar disposta a retornar à mesa de negociações para chegar a um novo acordo. A empresa tenta redefinir seu relacionamento com os trabalhadores, mas o sindicato se mantém firme na busca por melhores condições, prometendo piquetes em 30 locais.\nA paralisação pode impactar significativamente as finanças da Boeing, com analistas estimando uma redução de até US$ 3,5 bilhões no fluxo de caixa caso a greve dure 50 dias. Isso agrava a situação da fabricante, que possui milhares de encomendas de jatos 737 MAX de grandes clientes como Southwest e United Airlines.\nA situação marca mais um capítulo na complicada relação trabalhista da Boeing, que precisa rapidamente encontrar uma solução para evitar danos prolongados à produção e às entregas.\n<img src=\"https://images.advfn.com/sales/br_advfn/empiricus/rodape-120924-emk-ajust.jpg\" advfn\" width=\"550\" height=\"287\" style=\"display:block\" border=\"0\">\nADVFN BRASIL",

    "title": "Most Dangerous Cosmetic Surgeries: US Surgeons Reveal The Most Popular, Yet Dangerous Cosmetic Surgeries; And Their Side Effects | Times Now",
    "text": "Most Dangerous Cosmetic Surgeries: In the United States, most people go for cosmetic procedures – which have seen a rapid surge in the last few years. According to statistics from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, there is an increase of 5 per cent surgeries happening every year. Doctors say even though all surgeries carry risks, one has a sizeable 92 per cent likelihood of life-threatening complications. The eye colour change surgery - which includes colourful iris implants, laser pigment removal, and keratopigmentation, tops the list of the 10 most dangerous cosmetic surgeries in the US. How is eye colour changing surgery done? Keratopigmentation - also known as corneal tattooing or eye tattooing, is a surgical procedure that can change the colour of your eye by injecting pigment into the cornea. Apart from cosmetic, it is sometimes also done for therapeutic reasons like improving the appearance of eyes that have been damaged by disease, injury, or irregularities in the cornea's shape. Even though keratopigmentation has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, experts say youngsters are thronging clinics to get it done. With recovery times ranging from one to eight weeks and an average cost of $12,000, it is currently the most popular cosmetic surgery across the country. How is keratopigmentation done? According to experts, the procedure is done using a corneal refractive laser off-label and uses a mineral-based pigment that is inert when inserted into the translucent cornea using a cannula. New York Post reported that a French company that trains ophthalmologists to perform keratopigmentation had shared footage of a woman who changed her brown eyes to a stark, vibrant blue in a clip scoring nearly 30 million views on TikTok. However, experts are warning against this procedure, saying it can permanently change the cornea from clear to opaque. Some other complications include: Blindness Damage to the cornea can lead to cloudiness, warpage, fluid leakage, and vision loss Reaction to the dye It leads to inflammation, uveitis, or blood vessel growth into the cornea Infection The procedure also causes light sensitivity and bacterial or fungal infections that can spread all over, leading to pain, swelling, blurred vision, and even permanent loss of vision. Dr. Colin McCannel, a professor of clinical ophthalmology at the University of California, Los Angeles, told Healthline that it is a “bad idea” to pursue “any unnecessary eye surgery” due to the risk of complications. Which are other dangerous cosmetic procedures? Number two on the list of popular cosmetic surgeries is thigh lifts – with a nearly 80 per cent risk of complications like infection, blood clots, and even fatality. Also known as thighplasty, it helps improve the contours and tone of your thighs and works by removing excess fat and sagging skin. However, according to experts, it can lead to deep vein thrombosis and edema. Thereafter, comes the hugely popular Brazilian butt lift, in which a plastic surgeon removes fat deposits from other parts of your body and inserts them into areas around your butt. After your recovery, you will see the butt will be bigger, stick out more and have an even shape. However, it comes with an almost 40 per cent risk of injury, fat embolism, and even death.

    "text": "By Ismael Lopez\nSAN JOSE (Reuters) – Nicaraguan police detained on Thursday two senior Catholic priests who are close to the country’s top church leader, a person with knowledge of the matter said, raising to at least six the number of clergymen detained this week.\nThe source, who declined to be named for fear of arrest, said the two priests were detained for publicly praying for jailed Bishop Rolando Alvarez, the most prominent critic of President Daniel Ortega.\nLocal media outlet Confidencial named the priests as Carlos Aviles and Hector Treminio, and noted that their arrest brings to at least six the number of priests detained over the past week, adding that two of the clerics had already been released.\nThe government’s press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOver the past few years, Ortega’s government has targeted members of the Catholic church, a crackdown officials have in the past said was needed to punish treasonous behavior or other alleged crimes.\nAviles is the second-highest ranking cleric in the Archdiocese of Managua, led by Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes, while Treminio is its treasurer.\nAlvarez, the bishop of Matagalpa, forcefully criticized the government’s deadly response to mass protests that broke out in 2018, and was convicted of treason and sentenced to a 26-year prison term earlier this year.\nLast week, police arrested Bishop Isidro Mora of the Siuna diocese, making him the second bishop to be detained after Alvarez’s detention in 2022.\nMany of the latest clergymen detained were arrested because they publicly offered prayers for Alvarez, according to the source and local media, but the government has not issued any statements explaining the priests’ alleged crimes.\nNicaraguan Bishop Silvio Baez, who has been living in exile in Florida since 2019 and is the second-ranking leader of the archdiocese, called for the priests to be released.\n“I ask God to protect them and that they be freed immediately!” wrote in a post on X on Thursday.\nAccording to exiled Nicaraguan researcher Martha Patricia Molina, who publishes records of what she describes as the persecution of the Catholic Church under Ortega, the number of bishops, priests and seminarians behind bars in the country currently stands at nine.\n(Reporting by Ismael Lopez; Writing by David Alire Garcia and Miral Fahmy)",

    "text": "A retired sergeant and his family saved a couple who was vacationing in the same area. (WXIX, FAMILY PHOTOS, RAIN PHOTOS, CNN, Family Photos/ Rain Photos) By Brenda Ordonez Published: Jun. 22, 2024 at 5:48 AM EDT | Updated: 37 minutes ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nCINCINNATI ( WXIX /Gray News) - A retired Cincinnati police sergeant and his family saved an Ohio couple who just happened to be vacationing in the same area in Florida.\nThe Ramsey family is from Ohio, while the Bell family lives in northern Kentucky.\nUp until June 11, the two families had no idea they lived so close to one another.\nSome might call it a coincidence. Others will say it’s luck, but these two families call it a miracle.\nDean and Shana Ramsey recall the moment they said they almost drowned while vacationing in Siesta Key, Florida.\nSeveral streets flooded that day after the area received more than 11 inches of rain, an abnormal amount, according to Sarasota County officials.\n“You couldn’t see anything but rain and water,” Dean Ramsey recalled.\nWith several cars stalled on the road, the couple said they tried to pull off on what they thought was land.\n“The water sucked us right into that lagoon and that was it,” Dean Ramsey explained.\nWatching in horror from their condo was retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant Mike Bell, his wife Ginger Bell and their three young kids.\nThe Bell family responded.\n“We were able to stop, slow things down, and assess and make some decisions on how we were going to move forward,” Mike Bell said.\nThat plan started with Mackenzie Bell giving valuable information to 911.\n“I remembered they needed to know the address, so that’s the first thing I told her and then I told her a car is in the pond and there was two people in there,” Mike’s and Ginger Bell’s daughter, Mackenzie Bell, said.\nMeanwhile, the retired sergeant and his wife, who is an emergency medical doctor, took action.\n“I went over to the edge of the water and realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” Mike Bell recounted from that moment. “At that time, Ginger exited the front door next to the pond. I look at her and said, ‘We need flotation devices.’”\nThat’s where little Hank Bell came in.\n“I didn’t want them to die, so I ran as fast as I could,” Hank Bell explained. “I went up the elevator, which is extremely slow, and I knew there were stairs that were faster. So, I ran down the stairs.”\nFlotation devices in hand, the Bell kids handed them to their parents who were already in the water.\n“He went into the lady’s side and I went into the man’s side,” Ginger Bell said. “She was able to climb out on her own, but I put the boogie board right in front of her. She got her body on the boogie board and that’s when I started paddling and we kicked over to the side.”\nGinger Bell ran into some issues helping Dean Ramsey.\n“When he was trying to get out, his foot got stuck, so he was on his back with one foot out and one foot stuck in the steering wheel,” Ginger Bell remembered.\n“I looked at her and I said, ‘I’m stuck, I can’t,’” Dean Ramsey remembered. “At that time, I was like, ‘I’m going down with the car,’ but she’s like, ‘Get out of this car! You got to get out! Kick your leg!’ I started thrashing my leg and my foot popped out.”\nThe rescue took about five minutes.\nBack on dry land, the Ramsey family saw their rescuers as “guardian angels.”\nThe families say they have plans to reunite in the near future.\nThe Bell family wants to remind residents to always be mindful of their surroundings and assess a situation before getting involved. They said if your car is going in a body of water, roll down the windows or punch them out by hitting the corners.\nThose tactics could save a life.\nCopyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "Matteo Salvini interviene ancora sulla questione scioperi. Dopo che ieri, in Italia, più di 500 mila persone sono scese in piazza per protesta e a Torino ci sono stati scontri tra manifestatnti e polizia (con sei agenti feriti), il vicepremier attacca: «Sono soddisfatto di aver garantito, ieri, il diritto a viaggiare con i mezzi pubblici a milioni di italiani. Il mio impegno non cambia in vista di dicembre, quando si contano già 15 scioperi proclamati, fra cui uno generale fissato il 13 (guarda caso un altro venerdì) a pochi giorni dal Natale. Sono pronto a intervenire ancora, per aiutare i cittadini». E sulla manifestazione di ieri è tornato anche Maurizio Landini: «Quando sono stato a Palazzo Chigi per la legge di bilancio ho regalato alla presidente del Consiglio 'L'uomo in rivolta di Albert Camus. Il senso di quel libro che fece grande rumore è rimettere al centro la libertà delle persone. Se la persona non si rivolta di fronte alle ingiustizie non esiste come persona, perché viene cancellato. Io l'ho pensata così». Landini spiega così le parole pronunciate ieri in occasione dello sciopero generale. «Oggi - ha detto al congresso nazionale delle Acli - la messa in discussione della democrazia non la danno le persone in piazza per i propri diritti ma chi in Parlamento sta tentando di far passare un decreto che chiama sicurezza ma riduce le libertà e gli spazi delle persone».",

    "text": "Los actos antisemitas en Francia se dispararon después del 7 de octubre Una cuadruplicación en un año: el número de actos antisemitas registrados en Francia saltó en 2023 a mil 676, frente a los 436 de 2022, según un informe que lamenta una \"explosión\" tras el 7 de octubre, fecha de los atentados de Hamás contra Israel. - Redacción AN / ARF Nunca antes se había alcanzado un nivel semejante en Francia, el país con la mayor comunidad judía de Europa (unas 500 mil personas), declaró a la AFP Yonathan Arfi, presidente del Consejo Representativo de las Instituciones Judías de Francia (CRIF). En seis de cada 10 casos (57.8%), los actos registrados se referían a agresiones a personas (violencia física, palabras y gestos amenazadores, etc.) y no a bienes, según el informe, que recopila cifras “registradas por el Ministerio del Interior y el Servicio de Protección de la Comunidad Judía (SPCJ)”. Sin embargo, el CRIF señala que estas cifras reflejan “sólo una fracción” de los actos antisemitas, es decir, aquellos por los que se presentó una denuncia o se informó a la policía. Nuevas generaciones Otro dato preocupante para el CRIF es que el 12.7% de los actos tuvieron lugar en centros escolares, la mayoría de ellos en secundaria. “Asistimos a un rejuvenecimiento de los autores de actos antisemitas. Las escuelas ya no son el santuario de la República”, deplora. “Por primera vez desde hace mucho tiempo, las nuevas generaciones son más susceptibles a los prejuicios antisemitas que las generaciones precedentes”, explica Yonathan Arfi, identificando “tres combustibles” de este fenómeno: “el odio a Israel, el islamismo y el conspiracionismo”.

El 7 de octubre El CRIF constató una “explosión” (+1,000%) de los actos antisemitas tras el atentado de Hamás en suelo israelí el 7 de octubre. Israel prometió “aniquilar” a Hamás y lanzó una vasta operación militar que mató a 25 mil 700 palestinos, la gran mayoría mujeres, niños y adolescentes, según el Ministerio de Sanidad del movimiento islamista. Según Yonathan Arfi, “el 7 de octubre actuó como catalizador del odio, activando el antisemitismo latente” y permitiendo así que la gente actúe. “A partir del día 7, prácticamente el mismo día, asistimos a un aumento de los actos antisemitas”, declaró asimismo a CNews Elie Korchia, presidente del Consistorio Central Israelita. Ya en 2012, tras el ataque a una escuela judía de Toulouse en el que murieron tres niños y un profesor a manos de Mohamed Merah, se registró un aumento del 200% de los actos antisemitas. También hubo un aumento del 300% tras el atentado yihadista contra el supermercado Hypercacher en 2015. Invisibilización en el espacio público El número de incidentes antisemitas pasó de unos 40 al mes en verano a 563 en octubre, 504 en noviembre y 175 en diciembre. Un descenso a finales de año “difícil de analizar” para el presidente del CRIF, que se mantiene cauto: “Estaban las vacaciones, sin duda una baja de intensidad…” “Todavía estamos lejos de las cifras anteriores al día 7”, subraya, lamentando la “falta de condena social del antisemitismo”. Algunos judíos prefieren no llevar kipá ni poner una mezuzá en su puerta para no llamar la atención. “El riesgo al final es el de una invisibilización de los judíos en el espacio público. Es una victoria que no podemos ofrecer a los antisemitas“, subraya Yonathan Arfi. (RFI)",

    "text": "Pas question de le laisser tomber: le cadeau génial d’Erling Haaland pour un enfant victime de harcèlement scolaire\nOn le sait, Erling Haaland est un joueur généreux. Le Norvégien a déjà plusieurs fois fait preuve d’une grande empathie et l’a encore fait cette semaine, en répondant à Vini, un jeune garçon de 4 ans vivant au Brésil. Ce dernier a opté pour une coupe de cheveux particulière, avec des cheveux longs qui lui arrivent aux épaules. Ce qui n’est pas passé dans son école, où plusieurs élèves se sont moqués de lui, avec insistance. Un harcèlement scolaire raconté par sa maman, Angélica Almeida, dans le Globo.\n“Chaque jour, les gens lui disaient: ‘Ce sont des cheveux de filles, pas de garçons. Coupe-les, ce n’est pas joli.’ Il était triste parce qu’ils le comparaient à une fille”, raconte-t-elle. Mais un autre enfant a finalement changé la perception, avec une idée qui va tout faire basculer. “Son camarade m’a demandé s’il pouvait dire que c’était Haaland. Je lui ai alors répondu qu’il pouvait dire que c’était mini Haaland, poursuit sa mère. À la fin de l’année dernière, les enfants de son école jouaient aux cartes et disaient “c’est le fils de Haaland”, a témoigné la maman.\nVini s’est alors intéressé à la star de Manchester City, devenu son joueur préféré. Il a même organisé une fête d’anniversaire dédiée intégralement à Erling Haaland, avec des posters et des décorations à son effigie. Touchée, Angélica avait pris contact avec Manchester City, qui a relayé l’info auprès du Norvégien. Ce dernier a donc envoyé une vidéo au jeune garçon, affirmant qu’il était très fier de ses cheveux. “Vini a trouvé cette vidéo représentative: même s’il est un garçon, il peut avoir les cheveux longs et être respecté pour cela”, conclut Angélica, aux anges en recevant ce cadeau.\nC’est ce que l’on appelle un superbe geste !",
