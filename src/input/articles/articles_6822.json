    "text": "Delhi air pollution: The air quality index (AQI) continues to remain severe in the national capital on Friday. Even though the strictest Stage-4 curbs under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) are under implementation, the air quality has remained in the ‘severe’ category. On Friday, the AQI of Delhi was recorded at 430, a slight improvement from Thursday’s 448.\nAccording to SAFAR-India, Alipur station has recorded an AQI of 427, Anand Vihar station of 458, Bawana 468, Burari Crossing 442, Dwarka Sector 8 460, IGI Airport 397, ITO 455, Jahangirpuri 450, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium 422, Lodhi Road 390, Mandir Marg 265, Mundka 465, Najafgarh 435, Nehru Nagar 459, North Campus DU 420, Okhla Phase 2 458, Patparganj 447, Pusa 396, RK Puram 450, Rohini 454, Shadipur 437, Siri Fort 453, Vivek Vihar 452, and Wazirpur 463 among others.\nGRAP restrictions are put in place when the air quality deteriorates drastically. When the air quality is in the poor category (201-300), the first stage is implemented. When it deteriorates to ‘very poor’ (301-400), the second stage is implemented, third is implemented when the air quality becomes severe at 401-450, and stage four when the air quality hits severe plus at over 450.\nDELHI AIR POLLUTION: STUBBLE BURNING, FIRECRACKERS\nThe government has blamed a combination of factors including stubble burning and firecrackers for Delhi’s worsening air quality. In a response to a question in Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Environment Kirti Vardhan Singh said stubble burning contributed an average of 10.6 per cent to Delhi's PM2.5 pollution from October 8 to December 7.\nSingh said that the air pollution in North India during the winter period is a culmination of multiple factors, including high levels of anthropogenic activities in the densely populated region.\nLower temperature, lower mixing heights, inversion conditions and stagnant winds, along with a combination of other factors such as stubble burning, firecrackers result in high pollution in the region.\nThe minister said that according to the Decision Support System of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, the average and maximum contribution of stubble burning to PM2.5 pollution in Delhi stood at 10.6 per cent and 35 per cent during the period from October 8 to December 7.\nCopyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

She died Tuesday at a hospital.\nShe was the second person to fall from the balcony of the fourth floor apartment where the fire started and where she lived, authorities said.\nAuthorities have not yet said how she knew the other woman already reported killed.\nManteca resident Charlotte Holguin, 54, who was visiting the apartment, died at the scene after plummeting from the balcony to the ground below.\nTwo other people suffered injuries, including a man who was able to get out of the burning apartment on his own and was in stable condition Wednesday. Another person injured has already been released from a hospital.\nThe cause of the fire remained under investigation Wednesday.\nThe fire erupted about 2:53 a.m. Sunday at the four-story, 30-unit Waterstone Apartments building at 3939 Bidwell Drive.\nFirefighters were on the scene within minutes and saw Holguin and another person hanging from the balcony. They both fell before firefighters could get a 35-foot ground ladder, the largest carried on a Fremont fire truck, to them. Authorities said the ability to use an aerial ladder on the truck was inhibited by obstructions in the parking lot. The fire was considered under control about 3:40 a.m.\nThe fire displaced dozens of residents.\nThe building was red-tagged by city officials, meaning it is not inhabitable.",

    "title": "Pawn Pawn streams new 'Halloween' EP exclusively on Side-Line ahead of the official release tomorrow",
    "text": "The dark electronic trio, Pawn Pawn has just announced the release of their new EP, “Halloween”. The EP will hold 3 tracks (which you can exclusively preview right now Side-Line): “Trick Or Treat”, “I Can Only Tell You With My Eyes”, “Jealousy Looks Good On Me”.\nHalloween by Pawn Pawn Vocalist Liz Owens Boltz explains that the music on the EP is “about synthpop and industrial-pop. Our creative journey has brought us here, trying a darker and more aggressive sound, and having fun with it.” And she adds: “While inspired by film director, John Carpenter, the EP is named in honor of a holiday many dark hearts celebrate every day. It’s about embracing darkness and flirting with the extremes of behavior.”\nAbout the songs itself she says: “Each of the songs on the EP is an exploration of emotional extremes: vengeance, obsessive attraction, jealousy. The Halloween EP’s themes represent tales of liminal spaces; the space between thinking about revenge and actively seeking it, or the space between obsessing over someone and actually making a move, for example. Lastly, the EP is also about the lines between passion and destruction, the idea that jealousy can make us more passionate and wanting to be the very best version of ourselves. Meanwhile that battle between passion and jealousy is one that can never be won and is ultimately self-destructive.”\nHalloween is available on all major digital platforms including Bandcamp and Spotify from tomorrow on.\nAbout Pawn Pawn Pawn Pawn, hailing from Toledo, Ohio, crafts a blend of darkwave, post-punk, and nu-gaze, resulting in an indie synth-pop sound. The trio comprises Liz Owens Boltz on lead vocals and guitar, David Daniel Smith handling drums, percussion, and various instruments, and Brandon William Boltz contributing on guitar, bass, and keys.\nTheir discography includes the 2018 album “Bedtime” and the 2022 release “Mourning”, featuring tracks like “I Don’t Want U 2 B Happy” and “Hopeless but Stable”. In November 2024, they already unveiled the single “I Can Only Tell You With My Eyes”.\nAnd now there is the brand new EP “Halloween”.",

    "text": "British defence giant BAE Systems was one of the biggest FTSE 100 risers yesterday as the industry was boosted by geopolitical tensions. On a quiet day for the London market, BAE’s share price rose 0.6 per cent, or 6.5p, to 1,102p after a report revealed its order book had jumped around £7billion in a year. Heightened global hostilities and ongoing conflicts have increased defence spending. The order books of the world’s biggest defence companies have been pushed to near record highs and the MSCI’s global benchmark for the industry’s stocks is up 25 per cent over the past 12 months. The war in Ukraine partly explains the increase but firms such as BAE Systems have also been buoyed by new orders for existing contracts.

Shell’s share price dipped 0.3 per cent, or 7p, to 2,549p. BP’s stock dropped 0.4 per cent, or 2p, to 465p on lower oil prices. ‘The market is likely to try the upside again... maybe in the early new year, on expectations of a recovery in fuel demand thanks to monetary easing in the United States,’ said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, of NS Trading, a unit of Nissan Securities. UK housebuilder stocks fell on fears the Bank of England will be slow to cut interest rates in 2024. A cautious approach would keep mortgage costs higher for longer. Barratt Developments’ share price fell 0.7 per cent, or 4p, to 562.4p, Land Securities’ stock dropped 1 per cent, or 7.2p, to 716.4p and Berkeley tumbled 0.4 per cent, or 20p, to 4,737p. Streeter said: ‘Housebuilders are on the back foot amid signs that consumers are still showing signs of resilience in their spending patterns in the post-Christmas sales. ‘The Bank of England is showing more wariness than the Fed about the trajectory for inflation, so any sign that interest rates might stay higher for longer in the UK aren’t read well for the housing market.’ On London’s AIM market, the biggest faller was chipmaker Sondrel. Shares plunged 53.7 per cent after a £1.7million contract delay sparked cashflow issues.",

    "text": "Las exmonjas de Belorado cambian otra vez de sacerdote en apenas diez días\nSe trata de un cura de origen alemán que celebra misa en las dependencias del hotel de Arriondas, en la que han denominado como «capilla del restaurante de clausura Santa María del Chicu»\nLos monasterios cismáticos se convierten en un catálogo de clérigos sedevacantistas: en nueve meses ya han tenido seis capellanes diferentes\nLas exmonjas de Belorado consiguen la licencia de apertura para su «restaurante de clausura» en Asturias\nLa Aemet avisa de la entrada de un frente de intensas lluvias a España a partir de esta fecha: estas son las zonas más afectadas\nBelorado se ha convertido en un catálogo de sedevacantistas. Cuando hace apenas diez días anunciaban la presencia en Arriondas del obispo Rafael Cloquell, de origen valenciano pero formado en el sedevacantismo en Alemania, ahora parece que un discípulo suyo ha tomado el relevo y, desde ahora, el padre Manuel -»de origen alemán», según afirma la nota de prensa- será el encargado de «administrar los sacramentos» a las exreligiosas, en la que ha rebautizado, sin ningún rubor, como «capilla del restaurante de clausura Santa María del Chicu».\nSegún afirma el jefe de prensa, la colaboración de los religiosos sedevacantistas con las exmonjas «es rotativa». Así, «ayudan a las hermanas en las misas diarias y son figuras que van y vienen, se van rotando y colaboran con la actividad religiosa diaria», añade, a la par que confirma que «el sacerdote padre Manuel ya ha realizado la primera misa en la capilla del restaurante de clausura Santa María del Chicu de las monjas en Arriondas».\nEn realidad, los motivos de este continuo tránsito son bien diversos y las circunstancias que les llevan a abandonar los monasterios mucho más mundanas de lo que cuentan las exreligiosas en sus notas de prensa. Los primeros en llegar a Belorado, justo en el origen del cisma, fueron el obispo excomulgado Pablo Rojas y su fiel sacerdote, el cura coctelero Jose Ceacero. Llegaban con el aura de representar a una importante entidad sedevacantista, la Pía Unión de San Pablo Apóstol, que, según ellos contaba con varias capillas, un floreciente seminario en Alar del Rey (Palencia) y el respaldo de la alta sociedad vizcaína.\nPero, como demostró ABC, ni existían los fieles, ni pasado nobiliario, ni propiedades, ni capillas, y el seminario de Alar del Rey apenas estaba habitado por Rojas y Ceacero y sus pastores alemanes, con los que el obispo se da bucólicos paseos por la ribera del canal de Castilla que allí nace. La Pía Unión quedó más bien reducida a una pareja de amigos -se conocen desde sus años de infancia en Linares- que trataron ser curas católicos pero no fueron aceptados en el seminario.\nEl protagonismo que tomaron en los primeros momentos del escándalo, en especial el del cura coctelero que se convirtió en improvisado portavoz como su parte diario a las puertas del monasterio. Una actitud que no gustó a las exreligiosas, en especial a la exabadesa, que los expulsó de Belorado justo cuando el arzobispado de Burgos decretaba la excomunión de las diez religiosas que habían protagonizado el cisma al renegar de la autoridad del Papa y de los obispos católicos. Rojas se mostró muy dolido por la decisión y reconoció entonces a ABC que habían sido «utilizados» por las exreligiosas.\n«Caminamos libres y solas en defensa de la fe católica», dijeron entonces, pero lo cierto es que la abrupta expulsión del obispo excomulgado y el cura coctelero dejó entonces a las exmonjas sin un capellán que celebrara los sacramentos en el cenobio y les diera asistencia religiosa. Algo poco acorde para una comunidad que sostiene que en el origen de su ruptura con Roma se encuentra su deseo de vivir con autenticidad la vida consagrada.\nSe acercó por Belorado algo después, ya a finales del verano, el cura argentino Sergio Casas Silva, que a su formación eclesiástica sumaba en su currículum el ser juez colegiado de boxeo y campeón nacional de cebado de mate en 2017. Casas Silva fue ordenado sacerdote dentro de la Iglesia católica, pero su relación con el sedevacantismo llevó a que fuera excomulgado. Además, según Casas Silva se hizo volver a ordenar 'subconditione' por el obispo sedevacantista John Hesson, aunque este niega haber presidido esa ordenación.\nEsta funcionalidad es sólo para suscriptores\nSuscribete",
