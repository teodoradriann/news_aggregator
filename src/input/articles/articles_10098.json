    "text": "Morongo Tribe writes $5 million check to help San Gorgonio hospital The Morongo Band of Mission Indians today donated $5 million to San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital in Banning to establish a program geared specifically to women's health. \"Morongo is delighted to be building on our partnership with the San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital Foundation to advance health care in the Pass,'' Morongo Tribal Chairman Charles Martin said. \"It is crucial that we continue to support new advancements at our community hospital to ensure women, mothers and families have access to high-quality care that addresses their unique health care needs.\" The $5 million check is the second-largest single charitable gift to the foundation, following a $5.6 million check provided by the tribe in 2022, according to officials. \"Today's gift by ... Morongo will bring profound and positive changes to local health care, allowing us to expand our services and improve the wellbeing of women of all ages in our community,'' Dr. Karan Singh said. \"Morongo is helping us set a new standard for health care excellence across the San Gorgonio Pass.'' The funds will go directly to the establishment of a \"Women's Health Program,'' providing specialized services, like obstetrics, gynecology, breast exams, family planning and general wellness efforts, according to officials. \"The donation will also upgrade critical patient monitoring systems, with $1.4 million dedicated to enhancing technological capabilities and patient care efficiency,'' Morongo said in a statement. Hospital Board Chairwoman Susan DiBiasi expressed the medical campus' gratitude to the tribe for the \"incredible support you continue to offer to our foundation and our hospital.\" \"This donation will improve the lives of women and children across the Pass communities and puts our hospital in a position to provide innovative new health care services to our patients,'' she said. According to the tribe, with the latest gift, the total amount of charitable donations made by Morongo exceeds $20 million over the past decade in support of \"local and regional nonprofit organizations that help seniors, families, veterans, youth and those in need.\"",

    "title": "Sanofi, Orano Strike Deal to Develop Radioligand Medicines for Rare Cancers",
    "text": "Partnership is expected to develop radioligand therapies based on lead-212 alpha-emitting isotopes, which offer the opportunity to destroy cancer cells with minimal damage to healthy tissue. Sanofi and Orano Med announced that they have agreed to terms on co-developing radioligand therapies (RLTs) for rare cancers. According to Sanofi, the joint venture aims to revolutionize treatment options for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers. Operating under the Orano Med brand, the collaboration will also focus on the discovery, design, and clinical development of RLTs based on lead-212 alpha-emitting isotopes, which have the potential to destroy cancer cells with little damage to healthy tissue. This agreement follows news of an exclusive licensing agreement with Orano Med and RadioMedix to advance RLTs in rare cancers with a focus on one late-stage project, AlphaMedix.1 “We are excited to partner with Orano in establishing a French pioneer that unites our respective expertise in biopharma and nuclear technology to drive groundbreaking progress in the fight against cancer. As a French biopharmaceutical company, we are deeply committed to fostering and enabling innovation in our home country. This collaboration is part of a broader effort to strengthen our ties within the scientific community, both in France and globally, with the goal of advancing the development of cutting-edge treatments for patients,” said Paul Hudson, CEO, Sanofi, in a press release. Orano stated that the investment by Sanofi is expected to strengthen the company and allow them to accelerate the development of their pipeline, leveraging the unique capabilities in the discovery and development of lead-212 based therapies. Additionally, Orano Med has developed a global industrial platform with the goal of ensuring an independent, reliable, and scalable supply of lead-212 based therapies to patients globally. Under terms of the deal, Sanofi will make an investment of approximately $325 million, a 16% equity stake in the new entity.1 “Sanofi’s partnership with Orano Med is a strong recognition of the potential of lead-212 based radioligand therapies to advance the treatment of cancers. This validates our strategy, having developed this expertise over the past 15 years, and reinforces our position as a leader in targeted alpha therapies. We look forward to combining Sanofi’s expertise with our R&D and world-class radiopharmaceutical capabilities to advance the development of potentially transformative therapies like AlphaMedix and make them available to patients in need as quickly as possible,” said Julien Dodet, president, governing board, Orano Med, in the press release. RLTs work by employing molecules labeled with radioactive isotopes that specifically bind to cancer cells, delivering localized radiation directly to the tumor or metastatic sites. According to the Advanced Radiation Centers of New York, RLTs combine the specificity of molecular targeting agents with the therapeutic efficacy of radiation, offering a promising option for treating various cancer types. Common RLTs include Xofigo and Pluvicto for prostate cancer, and Zevalin for lymphomas. In most cases, patients who are candidates for RLTs are those with advanced or metastatic cancer that expresses specific targets for the radioligands, such as bone metastases in prostate cancer for Xofigo or prostate-specific membrane antigen-positive cells for Pluvicto.2 “The success of Orano Med is an example of our group's ability to diversify beyond our core nuclear business. By applying our expertise in nuclear materials to fields like targeted alpha therapies, we are demonstrating that nuclear technology can have a positive societal impact, not just for energy and climate, but also for human health. This innovation reflects Orano's commitment to exploring new opportunities and taking bold steps to address some of the world’s most pressing challenges,” said Nicholas Maes, CEO, Orange Group, in the press release.

    "text": "GRANTSVILLE — The Highland Thrift Shop in Grantsville continues to serve the community in many ways. In 2023, the organization was able to give well over $26,000 to groups throughout the county. This is in addition to offering a place to purchase clothing, books and various household and even pantry items at discount prices. The shop is located in the former Grantsville Elementary School at 116 Main St. across from The Casselman Inn. The building was renovated into apartments and businesses in the early 1980s. The Highland Thrift Shop was founded on June 8, 1987, by members of several churches. Over the years, the board has donated thousands of dollars to other local charities in the community. It became an official nonprofit in 2015. Manager Jenna Wagner reported that the shop’s overarching mission is “to help the poor and suffering as Jesus Christ asks all of us to do.” She spoke of the “amazing souls” who have helped the organization to assist so many people. “Our shop started in June 1987 and has continued to grow each year since,” Wangner said. “God has truly blessed us, our community and the people in it.” End of the year gifts given were as follows: Union Rescue Mission, $500; Hospice of Garrett County, $2,000; It’s In The Bag, $3,500; the Dove Center, $3,000; Grantsville Volunteer Fire Department, $2,000; Habitat for Humanity of Garrett County, $500; Northern Garrett Rescue Squad, $2,000; Cindy’s Fund, $1,500; James Isaac House, $1,500; Grantsville Elementary School, $2,000 Highland Thrift Shop Food Pantry, $4,500 and Grantsville Lions Club, $3,000. “We started doing a Spirit Day Fundraiser for one school each month in the county,” Wagner said. “We donated 50% of our sales from the scheduled day back to the school.” Donations included Grantsville Elementary School, $520; Friendsville Elementary School, $530; Route 40 Elementary School, $500 and Accident Elementary School, $400. The thrift shop was able to sponsor a family of three for Operation Christmas Surprise. “We donated lots and lots of trash bags of clothing to the UPMC Behavioral Health Wing,” Wagner said. Several bags of Christmas Cards were donated to Operation Christmas Card. One bag of puzzles, nine bags of linens/clothes/shoes and two boxes of vases were donated to Cherry Hill Assisted Living. A gift of $250 was given to the Sliger family, which had a child born early in the NICU. Other donations were “multitudes” of bags of shoe boxes with books to Operation Christmas Child; five bags of Easter eggs to Grantsville Lions Club for their egg hunt event; six large store fixtures to Glade Mennonite Church for their monthly giveaway; and one large trash bag of baby/kids clothing to the Oakland Girl Scout project. In addition, $250 was donated for Fletcher Fazenbaker’s medical expenses; $250 for Anika Stein’s medical expenses; $250 to the NHS After Prom; clothing and kitchen/household items to a family who lost their home in a fire; and several boxes of books were given throughout the year to the Grantsville Library. Other donations included $250 to Garrett County Calvary Christian Academy for their Furniture Drive; $30 worth of clothing, linens and health/ beauty items and two bags of food to a mother/son who were displaced; $250 to the Northern Middle School PBIS Program; and $1,000 to Grantsville Lions Club. Four trash bags of baby clothes were donated to Mountain City Church for a clothing giveaway; a raffle basket and items were given for the Grantsville Rotary Bingo, 14 trash bags of items were donated to make scarecrows for the Grantsville Lions Club Oktoberfest; and two raffle baskets/items were given for the Grantsville Elementary PTO fundraiser for Autumn Glory. The shop also donated 11 boxes of plates to MoonShadow; two pair of shoes and socks to a student at Grantsville Elementary; one box of creamer, sugar and coffee to Breakfast with Santa at Grantsville Elementary School; 21 pieces of formal wear to the Appalachian Crossroads formal event; two boxes and one bag of formula for tube feeding to Hospice; a Christmas tree and several boxes of Christmas items to a church for a Christmas play; 24 records, a large trash bag of big ornaments, Christmas lights and wrapped boxes to Grantsville Elementary School’s Christmas program; $100 to Accident Elementary School; $250 to pay partial rent for a displaced woman and $500 to the CareCrows fundraiser for Cindy’s Fund. Highland Thrift is donating a Christmas meal to 29 families who signed up. This is the first year for this outreach. Families will receive a ham, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, applesauce, rolls and dessert. The meal is not prepared but includes instant and easy to prepare items. “We’re very excited with the number of participants,” Wagner said. The store held a Santa Event with 39 children coming through. Each received a stocking and gift, including an orange, toothbrush/toothpaste, hat and gloves, gift card to the shop, activity pad and crayons and a candy cane. Businesses helping make this event happen included The Print Shoppe, Four Seasons Fabric Shop, Grantsville Lions Club, Casselman Market, Guys Tire Shop, Grantsville Volunteer Fire Department, Grantsville Family Dentistry and Highland Thrift Shop. A Christmas Tree stuffie giveaway was also held again this year. Four Seasons Fabric Shop donates the tree and the thrift shop donates the stuffed animals, allowing each child to take one from the tree. The Winter Coat Giveaway started again in November and is currently thriving. Jackets in both children and adult sizes are always needed. “Our shop’s Christmas dinner was held at Penn Alps again this year, where we had an amazing turnout,” Wagner said. “We had several teenage volunteers this year.

    "title": "Free China Needs Military Buildup Now",
    "text": "Free China Needs Military Buildup Now\nNew book — ‘The Burning Moat’ — proposes a crash program to save China’s only multiparty democracy.\n‘Cities along the frontier must resolutely fortify their defenses; protected by metal ramparts and boiling moats, they become impregnable.’\nThese words from ancient China’s Book of Han are the inscription for the aptly timed\nnew book stressing the urgency of Free China stepping up its defenses against Beijing. The job cannot be left to Taiwan alone, though, stresses President Trump’s former deputy national security advisor, Matthew Pottinger. America, too, needs to boost immediately its production of ammunition and missiles, he contends, while also planning strategically for Taiwan’s defense.\nIn “The Burning Moat,” due out in July, Mr. Pottinger — a Hoover Institution fellow — and his coauthors propose a kind of crash 24-month program to give Taiwan a fighting chance to fend off Communist China. At least, that is, until the end of the decade, Mr. Pottinger contends, when newer defense technologies “may enter democratic arsenals,” enabling an “allied ‘offset’” against “China’s growing military juggernaut.”\nAs importantly, as Mr. Pottinger sees it, Taiwan itself will need to adopt “a new military culture.” He points to the doughty Ukrainians, who have shown “what a people can accomplish when they and their leaders embrace the will to fight.” Israel, too, Mr. Pottinger reckons, offers a model for Taiwan. The Jewish State, after all, has “won every war it has fought since the 1940s, despite facing numerically superior and technologically sophisticated enemies.”\nYet “Taiwan’s military is neither built nor acculturated for quick mobilization or prolonged struggle.” Hence the need for “training and equipping Taiwan’s ground forces — and citizens — to resist Chinese incursions,” its coauthors say. Were the People’s Liberation Army to invade “tomorrow,” they say, Taiwan “would struggle to hold out long enough” for America and its allies “to\nintervene with decisive force.”\nTo that end, Taiwan’s new president, Lai Ching-te, is pressing for reform of the armed forces. Mr. Lai aims to steer the military away from the influence of the opposition Nationalists, who favor a more conciliatory approach to the mainland. It would be more apt to frame the reforms as a return to the\nprinciples of Taiwan’s ex-president, Chiang Kai-shek, who succeeded the founder of Chinese democracy, Sun Yat-sen, a New York Sun correspondent.\nChiang called Taiwan a “citadel of freedom.” His legacy pervades Taiwan’s military, whose top brass, the Financial Times\nsays, “reject an identity exclusively focused on Taiwan rather than a greater China.” If Mr. Lai fears this raises “doubts over their loyalty in the event of war,” as the FT reports, this ignores Chiang’s vision of a democratic reunified China ruled not by the communist tyranny at Beijing, but by the free Legislative Yuan for now situated at Taipei.\nMr. Pottinger’s call for a renewal of Taiwan’s defenses has already sparked skepticism from voices on the left like Ian Buruma. “A show of force is supposed to deter China from aggression,” he\nwrites in the New Yorker. He fears this could backfire and provoke Red China. He points to the concern raised by a Tufts professor, Sulmaan Khan, who asks: “What if the show of force backed China into a corner from which it felt it had no option but to lash out?”\nThis geopolitical timidity corresponds, whether intentionally or not, with the propaganda from China’s tyrant, Xi Jinping. He tried to palm off on the European Union Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, that “Washington was trying to goad Beijing into attacking Taiwan,” the Financial Times\nreports. America “was trying to trick China into invading Taiwan,” Mr. Xi told the credulous European, but he “would not take the bait.”\nYet Mr. Xi’s own rhetoric about Taiwan — by\nwarning “China will surely be reunified” this year, the 75th anniversary of Mao’s takeover of the mainland — underscores that Free China “is in the crosshairs of totalitarian aggressive ambition,” as Stanford’s Larry Diamond says in the foreword to “The Burning Moat.” Concludes he: “We cannot allow a democracy to be swallowed by a power-hungry dictator without endangering all democracies.”",

    "text": "¡Un éxito! Concluye Congreso Eucarístico en Cancún con aforo total y sanaciones Se realizó el cierre del congreso con un aforo de aproximadamente mil 100 personas, que era la capacidad máxima. El segundo Congreso Eucarístico de Quintana Roo culminó ayer con aforo total, pero también con sanaciones de personas de todas las edades que sufrían dolores por las vivencias de cada día, y hasta conversiones. Desde las 09:30 horas del sábado se realizó el cierre del congreso en la parroquia Virgen de San Juan, con un aforo de aproximadamente mil 100 personas, que era la capacidad máxima. Pero, Pedro Pablo Elizondo Cárdenas, obispo de la Diócesis Cancún-Chetumal, señaló que el congreso tuvo actividades presenciales en las 73 parroquias del estado, donde miles de quintanarroenses reforzaron su identidad de católicos. Y también recibieron el mensaje del significado de Jesús en la Eucaristía, y como la adoración a este sacramento y la entrega de las culpas puede otorgar paz, liberación y tranquilidad en la vida de cualquiera. Según información de la Diócesis Cancún-Chetumal, los días 30 y 31 de mayo, y el primero de junio se hicieron diversas actividades. Entre estas hubo una procesión en Chetumal, horas santas, conferencias sobre la eucaristía, la caridad, la entrega de la persona a Dios, la importancia de María en la eucaristía, y más. Hubo conferencias, confesiones, y descansos de espíritu para recibir absolución y perdón. Esta última fue para aquellas personas que traían muchas presiones y recibieron una oración de liberación, con la que quedaron dormidos pero se levantaron más tranquilos. Se dieron cantos como Nadie te Ama como Yo, de Martín Valverde, rezos a Jesús para presentar la situación que cada quien carga en su corazón, entregarla al Señor y decirle que confían en Él para sanarla. “El resultado tiene que ser que todas las parroquias tengan una capilla de adoración perpetua. Porque es ir y encontrar en esas capillas la paz, la tranquilidad, la serenidad, la adoración, la contemplación que se está perdiendo en este mundo super acelerado, super estresante”, dijo monseñor. En las capillas de adoración perpetua está presente el Santísimo todo el tiempo. Ahí la gente visita a Jesucristo en la Eucaristía, le reza, lo adora, y se confiesa, y gracias a esto obtienen paz, relajación, y se eliminan malestares como el estrés, la angustia o la depresión. Por su parte, la cantante católica Guadalupe Aguilar, comentó que el congreso eucarístico es una oportunidad para que las personas puedan estar en comunidad, y encontrar a Jesús en la Eucaristía para encontrar paz, luz y fortaleza para tomar decisiones y luchar. “Es algo muy importante dentro de la diócesis, para ayudar a los fieles a tener pues más fuerza, a sentir esa compañía que a veces nos falta de Jesús. Es un reto que los jóvenes participen (…) porque nuestra juventud tiene muchas otras distracciones”, destacó. Cabe señalar que el objetivo del congreso fue impactar a más de 100 mil personas en el estado.",
