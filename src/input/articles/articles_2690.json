    "title": "Union representing 40 per cent of Quebec teachers reaches deal, ends unlimited strike",
    "text": "MONTREAL — A union representing 40 per cent of Quebec teachers has reached a deal in principle with the government and is ending a strike that has shut around 800 schools since Nov. 23. Fédération autonome de l’enseignement — or FAE — said Thursday night on social media that it spent the day analyzing a tentative deal with the province and will recommend it to its members for approval during general assemblies after the holidays. Details of the agreement have not been released. Even though the FAE called the deal \"a new step,\" it emphasized \"it is up to the teachers to respond to (Premier) François Legault's government and to say whether they feel they have been heard.\" The union said it has ended all of its pressure tactics, such as the general strike that has shut 800 schools, including in Montreal, since the end of November. If students affected by the FAE strike return to school as scheduled in January, they will have been away from classes for almost seven consecutive weeks. The FAE, which represents more than 66,000 teachers, took the most hard line out of all the public sector unions negotiating new contracts with the government when it launched an unlimited general strike. Earlier today, the government announced it had reached tentative deals on salaries with an alliance of unions, excluding the FAE, representing 420,000 public sector employees, including teachers and health-care workers. They had walked out sporadically since November, for a total of 11 days. The only major labour group without any sort of agreement is a nurses union with about 80,000 members — Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé du Québec — which said today that negotiations are ongoing. Earlier Thursday, before the FAE announced the end to its strike, Sylvain Martel, spokesman for parents group Regroupement des comités de parents autonomes du Québec, said he was feeling optimistic but remaining cautious that 800 schools would reopen after the holiday break. \"We're glad that we're able to hope for going back to school on Jan. 9, but everything is tentative, lots of people have to agree to what's on the table, so let's hope that it's a real deal and (union) members will get what they want,\" he said in an interview. Martel said discussions have been taking place between teachers, parents and administrators about how children will catch up after missing so much school. How that happens will vary, he said, because the effects of the strikes were unequal — some parents taught their children at home, others hired tutors, but many less-fortunate students spent weeks with little to no learning at all. \"It's very difficult for students to go back to the same rhythm they were in November, so it's going to take a little while, but we'll get there,\" he said.

    "title": "Migratory Animals Face Mass Extinction But As A Conservationist I'm Optimistic | MENAFN.COM",
    "text": "Author: Dan Challender ( MENAFN - The Conversation) The world is facing three planetary crises: biodiversity loss, climate change and environmental pollution. Recognised threats to biodiversity include habitat loss and overexploitation but new analyses suggest that migratory species are faring particularly badly.\nThe global extinction risk is increasing for all migratory species. Importantly, however, there is cause for optimism.\nI'm writing this in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, for the 14th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Migratory Species. This UN biodiversity treaty came into being in 1983 to support the conservation and sustainable use of migratory species.\nI'm here with representatives of many of the world's governments, United Nations agencies and various environmental organisations. The aim of the meeting is to review implementation of the convention, consider including additional species under the treaty and address emerging issues of concern for migratory species.\nThis is a flagship event. It is the first time that member countries have met in person since the COVID pandemic and the first such meeting ever to be held in Central Asia.\nStatus update A landmark report titled the State of the World's Migratory Species has been launched at the meeting, the first ever report of its kind. The results are alarming.\nThey indicate that three in four species included under the convention are affected by habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation and seven in ten listed species are threatened by direct use and trade to varying degrees. Worse still, they suggest that the extinction risk is increasing for all migratory species, including those not included under the convention.\nSome species are of particular concern. Populations of fish included under the convention have declined on average by 90% since 1970. Many species under the convention that need or would significantly benefit from international cooperation, are identified as high priorities for further conservation action based on their conservation status and biological vulnerability.\nThese include 90 species of bird (including the whooping crane), 18 terrestrial mammals (such as the African hunting dog) and 12 aquatic mammals (such as the Amazon river dolphin). In some cases, this is despite these animals having been listed under the convention for decades.\nThis report is important because it details the range of threats that migrating species face. Animals migrate for various reasons including to find food, to reproduce, and ultimately to survive. Importantly, they do not respect national borders.\nThey may also face different threats along migration routes. Understanding the scope and severity of these threats where they occur is therefore essential to informing conservation action, especially in the context of the triple planetary crises.\nEffective action More broadly the report is important because it enables an assessment of how conservation efforts to conserve migratory species listed under the convention are working or if they are not. The results also call into question the effectiveness of the convention itself.\nThe effectiveness of multilateral environmental agreements can be measured in various ways but arguably the most critical measure of effectiveness is whether such agreements are solving the problem for which they were designed.\nThere are various reasons why such agreements are not always as effective as they could be. These include a lack of political will, a lack of resources to identify and implement context-specific measures at relevant scales and a lack of resources for law enforcement.\nSuccess stories do shine through, though. Native to central Asia, the saiga antelope was included in the convention in 2006. This has proven key to catalysing concerted conservation action for the saiga.\nIn 2006, all range countries for this species, including Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, also signed a memorandum of understanding vowing to restore saiga populations by improving monitoring, reducing poaching and illegal trade and creating alternative livelihood options for local communities.\nThe saiga antelope, an animal that once roamed the Eurasian steppe alongside woolly mammoths, has gone from being listed as critically endangered to near threatened, thanks to international conservation efforts. Yakov Oskanov/Shutterstock Saiga range countries are well on their way to achieving this objective. In the last 15 years, new knowledge of the saiga antelope's ecology, migration and trade has been generated and effective anti-poaching measures have been implemented.\nAs a result, the saiga was moved from critically endangered to near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list of threatened species in 2023. This has been possible because of political will in range countries but also because of collaboration between government agencies, conservation practitioners, environmental organisations and academics.\nHere in Samarkand, this collaborative effort is clear to see. For the saiga, collaborators have focused on several aspects of the species' conservation. These include evaluating management approaches, sustainable use of the species, stockpile management, building the saiga conservation network and identifying key research needs along international supply chains.\nCatalysing cross-border conservation While headlines are bleak, I feel optimistic. This landmark meeting has been positive and I've noticed a renewed sense of commitment to improve the conservation of migratory species. There is a clear sense that the governments gathered here know what they need to do. It is now about getting on and doing it.\nThis reflects the fact that the scientific community does know how to conserve species. Conservation measures should be context-specific, applied at relevant scales, and socially legitimate among local communities and Indigenous peoples if they are to be successful .\nRenewed commitment to conservation solutions identified in this report could build political will to act together. If member countries can rise to the challenge, then there is hope for the world's migratory species.\nMENAFN15022024000199003603ID1107857379\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

Which will have an investment of $2,949 million and the support of USAID’s Amazonía Mía program, over the next two years, 160 beneficiaries between productive units and MSMEs will strengthen their productive and business capacities.\n“Caquetá has all the potential to be a leading department in agroindustrial production in the country, with which we will be able to continue advancing in the transformation and economic reactivation of Colombia. From the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism we continue to advance with programs, such as ZASCA, that allow us to take advantage of all this natural wealth and bring progress, modernization and development to all the productive units of this region,” highlighted the vice minister (e) of Business Development, Lorenzo Castillo Barvo.\nYou can read: The Attorney General’s Office asks the Constitutional Court to invalidate marriages with minors\nThis ZASCA Center, located in the Agrosolidaria facilities, offers beneficiaries access to specialized machinery for the transformation of non-timber forest products and cocoa derivatives, such as jams, snacks, oils, among other products that will become an opportunity to increase the productivity, optimize income and generate more employment.\nAccording to Hernán Ceballos Gacharná, general manager of iNNpulsa Colombia – Colombia Productiva, “this ZASCA Reindustrialization Center marks a milestone for the region and the country, especially because it will allow the strengthening of business and productive units and MSMEs that, in addition to finding in the non-timber forest products a business opportunity, they promote the conservation and protection of the natural spaces of their territory.”\nFor her part, María Neomice Prieto Martínez, legal representative of Agrosolidaria Florencia, highlighted that “the drive towards agro-industrial and socio-business development is essential to strengthen the local economy and promote sustainability. The integration of the community to the ZASCA Center, as well as the strengthening of the productive chain, can contribute to a paradigm shift in the relationship between people and their ecosystems, promoting a more harmonious and sustainable development.”\nYou may be interested in: Superfinanciera ordered Ferney Alarcón not to continue collecting money",

El sumo pontífice de 88 años debió frenar varios de sus discuros en las últimas semanas producto de la bronquitis que lo aqueja. Por este motivo, el Vaticano decidió que era momento de internar el líder de la Iglesia católica para resguardar su salud.\nEl papa Francisco se encuentra internado en el el Policlínco Gemelli de Roma por la bronquitis, algo que no es menor, teniendo en cuenta que el sumo póntifice tiene desde sus 19 años solo la mitad de su pulmón derecho, lo que complica cualquier cuadro respiratorio.\nLa decisión de Trump que le pone en contra a todos los cristianos: quebró una enseñanza clave de la Biblia\nEl fin de las deudas hipotecarias | Infonavit lanzó un nuevo préstamo para todos los trabajadores que cumplan con este requisito\nAumenta la preocupación por la salud de papa Francisco\n\"Esta mañana , al final de las audiencias, el Papa Francisco fue ingresado en el Policlínico Agostino Gemelli para realizar algunos exámenes diagnósticos necesarios y continuar el tratamiento en ambiente hospitalario de la bronquitis todavía en curso\", informó el Vaticano en su comunicado oficial.\nEl papa Francisco tiene 88 años y según datos de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, OMS, actualizados al 2021, la esperanza de vida para los hombres en Italia es de 80 años, un dato revelador y aclave de cara a la salud de sumo pontífice.\nA este dato se suman las principales causas de muerte de hombres en Italia, de las cuales, el pápa Francisco está en la línea roja, principalmente por sus antecedentes clínicos en sus sistema respiratorio. La OMS reveló las principales causas de muerte de hombres en Italia:\n- Enfermedad cardíaca isquémica 147.7%\n- Covid-19 131.6%\n- Ataque 82.7%\n- Cáncer de tráquea, bronquios y pulmón 81.2%\n- Enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva 59.5%\n\"En Italia , la esperanza de vida al nacer (años) ha mejorado en 2,83 años , pasando de 79,4 [ 79,3 - 79,4 ] años en 2000 a 82,2 [ 82,2 - 82,3 ] años en 2021\", indicó el reporte de la OMS.\nEl papa Francisco y sus antecedentes clínicos que preocupan\nCon esta internación, el sumo pontífice suma la cuarta hospitalización y crece la preocupación mundial y las preguntas aparecen, una de ellas es \"¿Cuánto le queda de vida al papa Francisco?\" o \"¿Se va a morir el papa Francisco?\".\n- En el2019: se sometió a una cirugía de cataratas en la Clínica Pio XI de Roma.\n- Finales de 2020 - inicios de 2021: Sufrió dolores por inflamación del nervio ciático, lo que le obligó a cancelar actos.\n- Julio de 2021: fue hospitalizado 10 días por una operación de estenosis diverticular sintomática del colon.\n- Junio de 2023: fue operado por una hernia abdominal con colocación de una malla en la pared del abdomen.\n- Marzo de 2023: fue ingresado tres días por problemas respiratorios.\n- Noviembre de 2023: canceló su viaje a Dubái (COP28) por problemas respiratorios.\n- Febrero de 2024: se realizó una tomografía computarizada de control de los pulmones.\nSobre su problema en la rodilla, el cual padece desde hace varios años, es un problema que aqueja bastante al papa Francisco; sin embargo, el sumo pontífice se ha negado a operarse para no someterse a una anestesia general, esto lo lleva a tener que usar bastón y silla de ruedas.",
