The (main-)inflation was not from dillo, who could have thought! Of course dillo inflated old money, but does it matter if it's in a legit way and everyone has access to it? Imagine legit players making actual money from npc whilest having fun with a cool game mechanic dancing on their dillos, unacceptable! - But seriously, how can you be so blind and/or ignorant to not see the obvious and finally decide to do something against it, it's already a horrible part of the game even for legit players (in my opinion) but either opinion doesn't even matter here as the problem with scripters outweighs any other advantages for the game. Now if it was up to me, I'd just completely disable that part of the game and either revamp it or just give up on this failed project. Just accept you failed on that part of the game and get your ideas on how to fix this problem if you can't handle the scripters by no way of detecting them. Give up on the concept of people should be still able to watch a series whilest farming if you then can't handle the consequences, this concept already is like a magnet for scripters without even knowing what game or game mechanic it is, make it active just like dungeons or even kinda mining/fishing (of course you could script those aswell, but easier detectable + people non stop watch you) where you actually need brain cells.

    "title": "Elon Musk's Misleading Election Posts Viewed 1.2 Billion Times: Report",
    "text": "Elon Musk had purchased X platform in 2022 for $44 billion. False or misleading US election claims posted on X by Elon Musk have amassed nearly 1.2 billion views this year, a watchdog reported Thursday, highlighting the billionaire's potential influence on the highly polarized White House race. Ahead of the November election, researchers have raised alarm that X, formerly Twitter, is a hotbed of political misinformation. They have also flagged that Musk, who purchased the platform in 2022 and is a vocal backer of Donald Trump, appears to be swaying voters by spreading falsehoods on his personal account. Researchers from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) identified 50 posts since January by Musk -- who has more than 193 million followers on the social media site -- with election claims debunked by independent fact-checkers. None of the posts displayed a \"Community Note,\" a crowd-sourced moderation tool that X has promoted as the way for users to add context to posts, CCDH said, raising questions about its effectiveness to combat falsehoods. \"Elon Musk is abusing his privileged position as owner of a... politically influential social media platform to sow disinformation that generates discord and distrust,\" warned CCDH chief executive Imran Ahmed. \"The lack of Community Notes on these posts shows that his business is failing woefully to contain the kind of algorithmically-boosted incitement that we all know can lead to real-world violence.\" The posts analyzed by CCDH carried widely debunked claims, such as that Democrats are encouraging illegal migration with the aim of \"importing voters\" or that the election is vulnerable to fraud. Both claims amassed hundreds of millions of views. Last week, Musk faced a firehose of criticism for sharing with his followers an AI deepfake video featuring Trump's Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris. In it, a voiceover mimicking Harris calls President Joe Biden senile before declaring that she does not \"know the first thing about running the country.\" The video, viewed by millions, carried no indication that it was parody -- save for a laughing emoji. Only later did Musk clarify that the video was meant as satire. \"Musk behaves as if he is beyond reproach despite growing evidence of the harmful role he is personally playing to fuel disinformation and division ahead of the US elections,\" Nora Benavidez, from the advocacy group Free Press Action Fund, told AFP. \"As his behavior edges closer to election interference, it's up to others -- the public, regulatory agencies and advertisers -- to hold him accountable for his anti-democratic behavior.\" Musk, who purchased the platform in 2022 for $44 billion, is facing growing scrutiny over his potential influence on voters. On Monday, a bipartisan group of five US secretaries of state sent an open letter to Musk, urging him to fix X's AI chatbot known as Grok after it produced election misinformation. Hours after Biden stepped down from the presidential race last month and endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee, Grok churned out false information about ballot deadlines, which was amplified by other platforms. X -- which also faced criticism for stoking tensions during recent far-right riots across England -- has gutted trust and safety teams and scaled back content moderation efforts once used to tame misinformation, making it what researchers call a haven for disinformation. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com X did not respond to an AFP request for comment.

    "text": "“Nessuno di noi chiuda il cuore a questo amore che perdona e salva. Gesù Cristo è morto e risorto per tutti”. È l’esortazione contenuta nel messaggio per la Pasqua di mons. Donato Oliverio, vescovo dell’Eparchia di Lungro degli Italo-albanesi dell’Italia Continentale. “Come ai discepoli – ricorda il presule – Egli invita ciascuno di noi a diventare messaggeri di un annuncio di salvezza, essere testimoni di speranza in un mondo di ombre. Come a Tommaso Egli ci conceda di posare il nostro sguardo sulle sue piaghe, in modo da capire il senso e il valore della sofferenza, per lenire le tante ferite di cui ciascuno di noi è portatore. Quante volte nei nostri rapporti quotidiani, invece che l’amore, regna l’egoismo, l’ingiustizia o l’odio! Queste sono le piaghe dell’umanità che straziano anche il corpo e attendono di essere guarite dalle piaghe di Nostro Signore”. “È vitale, per tutti noi – conclude mons. Oliverio – vivere sperando, nutrirci di cose buone, di amore, di comprensione, di parole e di atteggiamenti che siano espressione dell’Amore”.",

    "text": "Lincoln honors 911 call center workers amid nationwide shortage\nLINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) - In the midst of a national staffing shortage at 911 call centers, the City of Lincoln said it’s also in need of more telecommunications workers, taking this week to honor what they do.\nAt the new Lincoln Emergency Communications 911 Center on Wednesday, city officials gathered to share about the important work done by dispatchers, calling them a central link between the public and first responders.\nMayor Leirion Gaylor Baird also signed a proclamation marking this as National Public Safety Telecommunicator Week in Lincoln.\nJessica Loos, the center’s director, said there’s currently 14 openings for call takers, as well as other roles that haven’t been filled in more than a decade.\nShe adds the center still meets its minimum staffing numbers for each shift, but occasionally she has to mandate overtime or call in workers to meet that standard.\n“I don’t know that there’s a better center you can start your career in with 911,” she said. “While we have openings, I’m very confident we’re going to find the individuals that belong here.”\nLoos said that those mandates are no secret, and it’s something she tries to be upfront about when hiring new staff.\nThe LECC also offers a training academy to prepare workers for the half a million calls the center fields every year.\n“Not a job for anybody,” Loos said. “We don’t just want somebody picking up your call just to answer your call, we want somebody that’s committed to doing the right thing, getting you the right resource.”\nEmma Gettemy, who’s worked for the center twice now, said every day is different. And while it can be stressful, she takes pride in making Lincoln a safer place.\n“You have to have the passion for it, and that really helps you build resilience,” Gettemy said. “We cover for each other, we support each other. I know it’s hard for us to always get the days and times off, but we’re here cause we love it and we love helping the Lincoln community.”\nClick here to subscribe to our 10/11 NOW daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox.\nCopyright 2025 KOLN.
