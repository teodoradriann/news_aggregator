    "text": "It could be days before Toronto sees the current lengthy period of swelteringly hot and humid weather finally break, according to Global News’ top meteorologist. Toronto and much of southern Ontario have been struggling with days of heat warnings, with daytime temperatures in the 30s and nights rarely dropping below 20 C. A heat warning for Thursday said the humidex temperature was “near 40” and listed the serious consequences of extreme heat on people’s health. Global News’ chief meteorologist Anthony Farnell said that, while late July and early August are typically among the hottest times in Toronto, the consecutive days of high humidity are biting. [top news stories from Canada and around the world.](javascript:void(0)) Get daily National news Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy . “This hasn’t even come close to breaking any records but it’s the humidity that is starting to get to us,” he said. “When you factor that mugginess in, the humidex has been in the upper 30s most of the week and it will continue to feel like you’re stepping outside into the tropics through the upcoming weekend.” Environment Canada said a “cooler” air mass should arrive overnight between Thursday and Friday but the oppressive overall heat will likely continue until after the weekend, according to Farnell. “There will be some slight relief in the days ahead thanks to extra cloud cover but a meaningful change in the weather pattern won’t occur until next week,” he said. “A cold front will likely spark thunderstorms on Sunday night and more rain is expected on Tuesday. Temperatures will actually be below seasonal all week with highs in the mid-20s with much lower humidity levels.” - Ford rules out boundary changes, while some worry ‘your vote is going to count for less’ - Simply Delicious Recipe: Guernsey Girl cheese with fresh herb salad - Day parole revoked for man who killed Indigenous woman with trailer hitch - Murder charge laid after human remains found in Ontario kidnapping case",

    "text": "Finale dolcissimo per gli Skorpions che passano anche sul campo dei Panthers\nIl campionato chiama e gli Skorpions rispondono presente nella gara più difficile, almeno sulla carta, nella tana dei campioni in carica\nUn passo dopo l’altro, sempre più sicuro, verso una nuova dimensione. Il campionato chiama e gli Skorpions rispondono\npresente nella gara più difficile, almeno sulla carta, nella tana dei campioni in carica. Finisce 38 a 34 per Ryan Griffin e soci, al termine di un match dai mille capovolgimenti e dai mille colpi di scena, alzi la mano chi a memoria rammenta due touchdown su ritorno d’intercetto, concluso con una meta quasi teatrale, degna di Hollywood, di Maclaine Griffin che a un passo dal triplice fischio segna dopo aver ricevuto uno snap.\nE dire che la gara era cominciata nel peggiore dei modi, due touchdown subiti e il primo intercetto a carico di Ryan Griffin potevano creare brutti pensieri nella testa dei giocatori, ma questi Skorpions non sono soltanto il talento del loro quarterback. Hanno una solidità impressionante, come dimostrano i dieci punti in sequenza, il primo touchdown di Davide Silvestri su ritorno di kick off è da incorniciare, che li riportano a contatto dell’avversario. Chiuso il primo tempo sotto di sei, il field goal è a opera di Stefano Granelli, la squadra di Nick Holt accelera in un lampo nel terzo quarto trovando punti con Andrea Volonnino, ricezione da 14 yarde e con Pietro Migliori che si prende il lusso d’intercettare Patterson e ritornare l’ovale per 32 yds. Attacco, special team, difesa, tutti segnano e danno un contributo profondo alla causa, si parlava di solidità mentale e tecnica, costringendo i Panthers a rincorrere per la prima volta nel match. L’ultimo quarto, severamente vietato ai deboli di cuore, vede Parma pareggiare, Varese tornare avanti con il secondo touchdown di Davide Silvestri su ritorno di calcio, fanno 157 yarde di guadagno in sole due giocate, i Panthers mettere di nuovo la testa avanti, 34 a 30, con una meta e un field goal. Tutto finito? Assolutamente no.\nGli Skorpions, negli ultimi tre minuti costruiscono un drive perfetto, basato in primo luogo sull’asse dei fratelli Griffin. Dopo un paio di ricezioni funamboliche, Maclaine si prende il lusso di ricevere uno snap direttamente nelle mani ed andare a violare l’end zone avversaria in prossimità del pilone che delimita l’area parmense. C’è tempo per quattro giochi dei Panthers che non riescono a schiodarsi dalle proprie 20 yarde. Poi Ryan Griffin chiama la victory formation. Il tempo d’inginocchiarsi e scatta la festa grigiorossa,\nPrima divisione.
