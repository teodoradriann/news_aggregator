    "title": "Prep basketball | Lemke, Butor help Tigers get 93-81 win in Bambauer Classic opener – Times-Standard",
    "text": "The Arcata Tigers boys team started the Bambauer Classic on Wednesday with a nice team performance that saw the Tigers get a 93-81 win over Lincoln High in a high-scoring affair. Arcata made the trip to Marin County and got above .500 (6-5) on the season with the win over the short-handed Lincoln Zebras team that played with only six players, leaving just one reserve on the Zebra bench. Lincoln also came out with a noticeable strategy, to let the three balls fly. The Zebras did their best to stretch the floor and play the numbers with the three-point shots but sophomore Luke Lemke and senior Kalani Butor had no interest in seeing Arcata enter the loser’s side of the bracket. The duo combined for over 50 points and controlled the pace for the Tigers. The Lemke-Butor pairing usually isn’t the headline for the Tigers, the team had both league co-MVPs last season with junior Luke Moxen and the graduated Brandon Bento-Jackson sharing the honor for the Big 5 champion Tigers. Moxen started the game great for Arcata, scoring the game’s first bucket for the Tigers and displayed his all-around game with post moves, a block, his ability to put the ball on the ground and make plays and even knocking down a three-ball. Moxen’s performance was short-lived as early in the third quarter Moxen had to leave the game with a lower-body injury. He appeared to attempt to walk it off but then got treatment for it on the Tigers’ bench and did not return to the game. While losing the top scorer would be too much to overcome for many teams, Arcata had the depth to keep pushing and building a lead. Arcata had several contributors in the third quarter. After Moxen went down, junior Finn Warner hit a three, sophomore Jack Luh soared for an offensive rebound and put back lay-in and junior Dawson Vallerga had back-to-back layups to help Arcata take a 67-52 lead into the fourth. Even with all of the help from Arcata’s supporting cast, it was Butor with his high-release point on his jumpers and Lemke pacing up-and-down the court that buried Lincoln. Butor was able to consistently get to the line to disrupt any Lincoln momentum while Lemke seemingly played at a whole different speed than the fatigued Zebra defense that had to play heavy minutes with limited rotation. Lemke took home Little 4 offensive MVP for the Tigers’ football team earlier this year but he still looked in mid-season form on the court. In the second half, he took the game over for Arcata. He sliced through the Lincoln defense with such ease, one might think the defenders spent the day readying for the game in a crockpot. Lemke found open teammates, knocked down free throws and punctuated his run with a step-back three that felt like a dagger even with plenty of time still on the clock. Lincoln won the fourth quarter 29-26 — impressive considering the fatigue level with all of their players seeing such heavy minutes but it was not enough as the Tigers won it 93-81. Arcata is back at it on Thursday as they’ll face the host team, Marin Catholic in the late game, with tip-off set for 8 p.m. Dylan McNeill can be reached at 707-441-0526.",

    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Reproductive health advocates spoke at the Indiana Statehouse Thursday about a judge's recent decision to stop Indiana's Department of Health from releasing terminated pregnancy reports.\nIt's only a temporary block for 10 days.\nAmong the dozens gathered for a rally at the Statehouse was 36-year-old Ashlie Kehrberg. She knows the joys and sorrows of motherhood.\nKerberg lives on a farm in Bloomington with her husband and five children, ages 1 to 15.\n\"It's such a beautiful family and those lives matter so much,\" said Kehrberg of her husband and children.\nShe's also lost a child, too, an infant son named August.\n\"He passed away at 10 weeks old from SIDS,\" Kehrberg explained.\nIt's the days right after August's birth that Kehrberg is willing to talk about because of what she said she went through — postpartum psychosis.\n\"Every time he cried, because he was very difficult, I was gritting my teeth and I just wanted to squeeze him and that's not OK,\" Kehrberg recalled.\nShe said she also wanted to take her own life.\n\"None of it was logical and I was out of my body, out of my mind, out of my body, but I would verbalize it,\" she recalled.\nSpeaking about what she was feeling allowed her husband to get her help. That same support system was there after August died.\nKehrberg went on to have two more children, a boy and girl, now 4 and 1.\nJust a few months ago, she discovered she was pregnant again. Kehrberg decided to leave the state to have an abortion.\n\"I didn't want to risk anything happening with my other children,\" she said, fearing she might experience another bout of psychosis.\nShe was also concerned that the spinal cancer she had when she was 23 could return. She fought the disease when her oldest child, now 15, was just a toddler.\nKehrberg was among a handful of women Thursday who were willing to share stories about the abortions they'd had.\n\"I advocate for maternal health because I saw what I did, what I went through,\" said Kehrberg.\nKetki Tamhankar also shared her story of the abortion she received in Indiana in 2016 before the law changed.\n\"Even at that time, it was not easy to get an abortion. We had multiple meetings, multiple appointments,\" Tamhankar explained.\n\"I've seen more women talking about abortions that they have had and being able to be honest about the care that they need because they want everyone to be able to have the care that they deserve,\" said OB/GYN Dr. Caitlin Bernard, who also attended the rally.\nBernard became a well-known face more than two years ago during the special legislative session when Indiana lawmakers passed a near-total abortion ban in Indiana.\nAt the time, Bernard spoke about performing an abortion on a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio. She was later disciplined by the state's licensing board for revealing a patient's age and location.\nRecently, Bernard was one of two doctors who sued to stop Indiana's Department of Health from releasing individual terminated pregnancy reports after Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order requiring it.\nDoctors in Indiana are required to fill out terminated pregnancy reports after performing an abortion.\nBefore the near total abortion ban became law, Indiana's Department of Health would release individual terminated pregnancy reports, if requested.\nThose reports would have any identifying information about the patient taken out, only the doctor's name could be seen.\nAfter the near-total abortion ban went into effect, the Department of Health stopped releasing those individual reports, arguing that with so few abortions happening now in Indiana, it would be easier to identify who had the abortion, especially in rural counties, thus violating patient privacy.\nThis week, a Marion County judge issued a stay, halting the release of those reports for 10 days.\n\"I think he made it very clear that physicians should not release patient information through the TPR process and legally requiring us to do so is not right,\" Bernard said of the judge's decision.\n\"I think this is something that's a direct violation of HIPPA,\" said Tamhankar. \"We deserve the right to our own medical privacy.\"\n\"It makes you a target,\" Kehrberg said about the release of the reports.\nOne thing Kehrberg wasn't happy about, several bills dealing with maternal health that didn't make it through the legislative process, including some, she said, that didn't even get hearings.\nKehrberg was especially disappointed that House Bill 1462, authored by State Rep. Vanessa Summers (D-District 99), didn't go anywhere.\nThat bill would have created a helpline for mothers in crisis, like Kehrberg once was.\n\"How can I trust you when I can't trust you managing these bills at the Statehouse?\" she asked.\nBoth Kehrberg and Bernard said they don't believe the fight over the terminated pregnancy reports is over.\n\"We will continue our fight to protect patient information,\" said Bernard.",
