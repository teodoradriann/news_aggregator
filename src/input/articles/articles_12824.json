    "text": "Manizales\nRicardo Bonilla, Ministro de Hacienda, realizó un recorrido por fincas cafeteras, Cenicafé y quiso conocer de cerca las dinámicas cafeteras en Caldas, frente a lo cual destacó que debido a que los fenómenos climáticos que se han vivido recientemente no han sido negativos para los cultivos de café , se espera superar los 12 millones de sacos de café mejorando a su vez el precio de exportación.\n“Eso significa que el fenómeno del niño no generó efectos adversos y esperamos que con el fenómeno de La Niña mejoren las condiciones del cultivo y la cosecha, vamos a superar los 12 millones de sacos este año, estamos en una mini bonanza”. Destacó el ministro desde Chinchiná donde hizo varias actividades.\nDe igual forma se refirió al precio del café y de las exportaciones frente a lo que destacó que “queremos que el precio del café internacional hace rato esté por encima de $2 dólares y eso es bueno para los cafeteros, pero también es bueno para que los cafeteros utilicen esa mini bonanza esos precios para reinvertir, entonces es hora de renovar café y es hora de hacer otro tipo de tratamientos de mejora de los sitios de beneficiadero, es decir, es hora de invertir y aprovechar los buenos precios, hay mayores recursos de parte del Ministerio de Agricultura para garantizar la renovación de cultivos y está el programa de obtención de fertilizantes más barato, ya tenemos que mirar con la nueva ministra que cómo se fortalecen”, dijo el Ministro Bonilla.\nHabló también sobre la informalidad en el sector en temas de exportación frente a lo que explicó que tienen una inquietud, ¿quién le vende el café a los grandes exportadores privados?\nFue enfático en hablar de la visita que era para fortalecer los lazos con los productores y para incentivar la modernización en el proceso a través de la inclusión de nuevas tecnologías y habló de la economía productiva.\nInsistió que no están en contra de la Federación Nacional de Cafeteros y que buscan revisar puntos para trabajar de forma conjunta.\nLe puede interesar: Miércoles y jueves, los días con más emergencias por lluvias en Caldas\nLe puede interesar: Gobernación de Caldas busca liquidar judicialmente el segundo contrato de Mil Viviendas",

    "title": "'I guarantee it'… Michael Bisping predicts brutal knockout in major UFC 311 fight",
    "text": "UFC Hall of Famer Michael Bisping is expecting Jamahal Hill vs. Jiří Procházka will steal the show at UFC 311.\nUFC light heavyweight contenders Jamahal Hill and Jiří Procházka may not be the headlining fight at UFC 311, but their clash is arguably just as important as a title fight. Both fighters are looking to make a strong case for another shot at UFC light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira after brutal knockout losses to the titleholder in their most recent outings.\nThere’s a lot of pressure on Hill and Procházka this weekend to make a statement to the rest of the UFC light heavyweight division. Both former titleholders have one-punch knockout power, and their fight is expected to be an intriguing matchup for as long as it lasts.\nMichael Bisping feels Hill vs. Procházka not only has the chance to earn ‘Fight of the Night’ honors but there’s a chance it’ll end destructively.\nREAD MORE: Arman Tsarukyan’s incredible ‘$100 million’ net worth leaked by MMA legend ahead of UFC 311 Photos by WWE/Getty Images, Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images Michael Bisping predicts Jamahal Hill vs. Jiří Procházka won’t go the distance During the UFC 311 preview show on TNT Sports , Bisping gave his breakdown for Hill vs. Procházka.\n“Jamahal Hill has been going after everyone online, doing a great job at turning the fanbase against him,” Bisping began on Hill vs. Procházka. “But the way I look at that is he has a chip on his shoulder…he’s annoyed, embarrassed, and mad. And those emotions could help you! He holds this dear to his heart. And on the flip side, Jiří Procházka, the samurai. We call that a joke, but he’s serious when he says he’s been out in Japan training with karate grandmasters…he’s got a wild style, crazy aggressive, unpredictable…\n“I cannot wait for this fight. This could be ‘Fight of the Night’ as long as it lasts, it’s going to be one of the most exciting fights you’re ever going to see. And somebody is going to get knocked out cold, I guarantee it!”\nHill and Procházka both demonstrate tendencies to search for finishes inside the Octagon, with both positive and negative outcomes. The two former champions earned light heavyweight gold by dismantling some of the division’s top challengers in horrific fashion.\nProcházka’s most-recent TKO/KO win came against Aleksandar Rakić at UFC 300 last April. The victory earned him a short-notice title rematch against Pereira at UFC 303, falling to the Brazilian for the second time by stoppage.\nHill, who earned the then-vacant belt by outpointing Glover Teixeira at UFC 283, earned three consecutive knockout wins before the Teixeira clash. He finished Jimmy Crute, Johnny Walker, and former title challenger Thiago Santos before getting the title shot.\nREAD MORE: ‘This is gonna be WrestleMania’… Israel Adesanya makes prediction for UFC 311 title fight Jamahal Hill vs. Jiří Procházka winner could be next for Alex Pereira Pereira, who most recently defended the belt against Khalil Rountree Jr. at UFC 307 in October, is expected to face the surging Magomed Ankalaev for his next title defense. But Hill and Procházka have the opportunity to potentially skip the line and change the UFC matchmakers’ course for the division.\nAdding to the intrigue surrounding Hill vs. Procházka, there have been some back-and-forth barbs between the two former champions in recent months. While the extent of their brewing bad blood is debatable, their pre-fight barbs could add to a likely furious-paced fight at UFC 311.\nHill and Procházka are both looking to kick off the new year with a bang, and Bisping and other analysts believe it’s almost a guarantee that their clash won’t last long.\nREAD MORE: Joe Rogan’s rib-crushing kicks leave UFC fans speechless",

    "text": "The Boston Celtics overcame a 21-point deficit and raised their home record to 15-0 by beating the Detroit Pistons 128-122 in overtime Thursday night.\nThe Pistons also made dubious NBA history, losing for the 28th straight time, the longest in-season losing streak in league history. If they fall on Saturday vs. the visiting Toronto Raptors, they would tie the longest skid of all time, including from one season to the next.\nBoston trailed 115-113 after Detroit’s Jaden Ivey made a 3-pointer with 2:32 remaining in overtime, but the Celtics scored the next six points and didn’t relinquish the lead again.\nBoston’s Kristaps Porzingis scored a season-high 35 points and added eight rebounds. Jayson Tatum finished the game with 31 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds.\nCade Cunningham led the Pistons with 31 points and nine assists. Detroit received 22 points and 10 rebounds from Ivey, 15 points and 14 rebounds from Jalen Duren and 17 points, 12 rebounds and six assists from Bojan Bogdanovic.\nThe Celtics, who had trailed 64-43 late in the first half, led 108-106 after Cunningham was called for goaltending on Tatum’s layup with 8.7 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, but Bogdanovic sent the game to overtime when he collected the rebound of a missed 3-pointer and scored with 4.1 seconds left.\nThe Celtics won without Jaylen Brown, who was scratched because of a back contusion. He was injured when he collided with LeBron James during the second quarter of Boston’s game against the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday.\nDetroit’s Isaiah Stewart didn’t play because of a toe injury. Kevin Knox II replaced Stewart in the starting lineup.\nThe Pistons were up 28-17 with 2:33 remaining in the opening quarter, but the Celtics closed the quarter on a 10-2 run and were within 30-27 going to the second period.\nThe Celtics faced their largest deficit of the season after Ivey gave the Pistons a 60-43 lead with 2:15 left in the second quarter. The lead grew to 21 with 45.1 seconds remaining in the half on two free throws by Duren, and the Pistons led 66-47 at halftime.\nThe Celtics were 4 of 24 from 3-point territory in the first two quarters, but they outscored Detroit 35-16 in the third. The teams headed to the final quarter tied at 82-82.\n–Field Level Media",
