Start your personal success story with ChessBase and enjoy the game even more.\nMagnus Carlsen continues to collect World Championship titles. Thanks to a brilliant 3-day performance in Samarkand, the Norwegian grabbed his fifth World Rapid Championship title after obtaining an undefeated 10/13 score.\nSince 2013, Carlsen has won 16 World Championship titles. The first one he got was, in fact, the classical title —\nin Chennai. The very next year he grabbed the ‘triple crown’, after winning both the rapid and blitz categories in Dubai.\nThe 33-year-old went on to win four more matches for the world crown in classical chess and collected five more blitz titles and (now) four more rapid titles.\nAs pointed out by Tarjei J. Svensen, perhaps the most impressive fact if we look back on Carlsen’s performance on these all-important events is his incredible stability. In ten World Rapid Championships, the ace has never finished below fifth place!\nPerhaps the most impressive thing with Carlsen in these events, isn't just that he tends to win many of them, but his stability. His placements in the World Rapid Ch. since 2012:— Tarjei J. Svensen (@TarjeiJS)\n2023: 🏆\n2022: 🏆\n2021: 🥉\n2019: 🏆\n2018: 5th\n2017: 5th\n2016: 🥉\n2015: 🏆\n2014: 🏆\n2012: 🥈\n[December 28, 2023]\nIn Samarkand, Carlsen entered day 3 of the rapid sharing first place with Vladimir Fedoseev and Yu Yangyi. Round 10, the first of the day, saw him beating Fedoseev in the critical clash of co-leaders. Carlsen became the sole leader and did not let go of that spot until the end of the tournament.\nA second consecutive win, over Iranian GM Pouya Idani, left him a half point ahead of Vidit Gujrathi in the standings. Vidit came from grabbing back-to-back victories over Anton Korobov and Arjun Erigaisi. The run of consecutive wins could have continued in round 12, as Vidit got a clear advantage in his game with white against Fedoseev.\nThis is a completely winning setup for White. Not only does he have an extra pawn and the bishop pair in an open position, but he also has the initiative. Incredibly, however, Vidit began to play imprecise moves at around this point, first giving up his advantage and then blundering into a lost position.\nAfter losing this game, Vidit drew Maxime Vachier-Lagrave to finish in shared third place (fourth on tiebreaks) with 9/13 points. The\nwinner of the FIDE Grand Swiss then shared a post on X confessing, “This won’t be easy to forget💔”.\nVidit Gujrathi | Photo: FIDE / Lennart Ootes\nFedoseev’s victory left him in sole second place a half point behind Carlsen going into the final round. Both contenders for the title got the white pieces and drew their games — against Praggnanandhaa and Dmitry Andreikin respectively — which meant the perennial favourite had secured outright victory.\nWith his 9½/13 performance, Fedoseev, now representing Slovenia, finished in sole second place. A 12-player group scored 9/13 points, with Yu Yangyi grabbing the bronze medal on tiebreak criteria.\nThe biggest underdog in the large group with 9 points was Volodar Murzin, who finished the tournament undefeated and collected wins over Praggnanandhaa, Ian Nepomniachtchi and Levon Aronian!\nVolodar Murzin | Photo: FIDE / Lennart Ootes\nCongratulations to Magnus Carlsen for his fifth Rapid crown.

At that point, third seed Lei Tingjie (the challenger of the latest\nmatch for the Women’s World Championship) had caught up with her in the lead. A group of five players stood a half point behind with one round to go.\nCo-leaders Lei and Bodnaruk signed a 3-move draw in the final round, a more understandable decision for Bodnaruk, who both had the black pieces and a better tiebreak score — in case of a tie for first between more than two players, the two participants with the better tiebreak scores would decide the tournament winner in a blitz playoff.\nOut of all the chasers, only Humpy grabbed a win in round 11, as she obtained an advantage out of the opening and converted it into a victory playing white against Kateryna Lagno.\nBodnaruk and Humpy had better tiebreak scores than Lei, which meant they were to play a blitz playoff to decide the championship.\nHumpy Koneru beat the ever-fighting Kateryna Lagno to catch the leaders in the final round | Photo: FIDE / Lennart Ootes\nLei Tingjie grabbed the bronze medal | Photo: FIDE / Lennart Ootes\nIn the playoff, Humpy — who won this event\nback in 2019 — kicked off with a win. Bodnaruk bounced back with black in a wild encounter, which meant two more blitz games would follow.\nThe third blitz encounter ended in a draw, and once again it was Bodnaruk who prevailed in the rematch, when she obtained a major time advantage — while getting a clearly inferior position on the board.\nHumpy, playing white, has a piece for two pawns here, with a winning position. Her 38.Kc7 was a mistake, as it allowed 38...Rxb3, and the position is now balanced.\nMore importantly, though, this miss seems to have befuddled the Indian star, who lost on time after 39.Rd4 Bd5. The final moments of the dramatic game were captured and shared on FIDE’s X profile:\nThe final game of the FIDE Women’s World Rapid Championship couldn’t be more dramatic!— International Chess Federation (@FIDE_chess)\nHumpy Koneru blundered in a winning position and eventually lost on time after a couple of moves.

    "title": "Wind farms: How Spain solves the problem of \"surplus\" green energy",
    "text": "The plains of the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha in central Spain were once famous for their windmills. Today, they have been replaced by wind turbines, much more impressive on the horizon of the area not far from Madrid. The landscape is dominated by the 28 huge wind generators of the Sierra del Romeral wind farm, located on the hills not far from the historic city of Toledo. The wind farm, managed by the Spanish company Iberdrola (Iberdrola), in the last five years, has contributed to the accelerated production of renewable energy in Spain. The capacity of wind power plants, which use the kinetic energy of the wind, the main source of renewable energy in recent years, has doubled since 2008, while the capacity of solar power plants has increased eight times in the same period. [Wind as an energy revolution that needs to be managed carefully](https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat/srbija-57468664?xtor=AL-73-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bvijesti%5D-%5Blink%5D-%5Bserbian%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D) [How much does it cost to install solar panels in Serbia and is it worth it?](https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat/srbija-58751837?xtor=AL-73-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bvijesti%5D-%5Blink%5D-%5Bserbian%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D) [Reversible hydropower plants in the Balkans: Guardians of energy and the key to transition to renewable sources](https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat/balkan-68427133?xtor=AL-73-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bvijesti%5D-%5Blink%5D-%5Bserbian%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D) After Sweden, Spain has the largest renewable energy infrastructure in the European Union (EU). Pedro Sánchez, Prime Minister from Spain's Socialist Workers Party, recently said that his country is \"the driving force behind the energy transition at the global level\". The boom began in 2018, shortly after the Sánchez government came to power, which removed regulatory hurdles and introduced subsidies for renewable energy production. The covid-19 pandemic further accelerated everything. \"The corona virus has had a very positive impact on our sector,\" says José Donoso, director of the Spanish Association for Solar Photovoltaic Energy (UNEF), which represents the solar panel sector. \"People saved money, had time to think about what to do with it, and many of them decided it was better to invest in a roof than in a bank.\" In the meantime, the government has set new ambitious goals, including that by 2030, 81 percent of electricity consumption will be provided from renewable sources. However, this positive trend has caused concern in the power industry due to the imbalance between supply and demand. Occasionally there is an excess of electricity. Although the Spanish economy has recovered from the pandemic crisis and is growing faster than all other major EU economies, electricity consumption has been declining in recent years. Last year, electricity consumption was even below the level during the 2020 pandemic, and the lowest since 2003. \"Until 2005, we saw that when gross domestic product (GDP) grew, electricity consumption grew more than GDP,\" says Miguel de la Torre Rodríguez, director of systems development at the company. Spanish Electricity Network (REE) which manages Spain's national electricity grid. \"Recently we have seen that demand has grown less than GDP, which means that energy intensity, that is, the relationship between consumption and economic activity, is decreasing,\" he says. Watch the video: Will the world embrace wind energy? There are several reasons for the recent decline in demand. One of them is the energy crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which has caused businesses and households across Europe to cut back on consumption. Also, energy efficiency has been improved. The increased use of renewable energy has further contributed to the reduced consumption of electricity in the national grid. Rodríguez says that during the day, when solar energy production is especially high, there can be a disruption in the balance of supply and demand, which affects prices. \"Since the power system must always be balanced - the demand must be equal to the production, which means that there is excess production during those hours,\" he says. \"This led to a drop in prices, especially during certain hours, when prices were at zero or even in the red.\" Although such low prices benefit consumers, they potentially pose a problem in terms of attracting investment to the industry. \"Because of this, investors may find it more difficult to decide to increase investments in the production of electricity from renewable sources,\" says Sara Picinato, an expert on renewable energy sources at the organization Greenpeace Spain. \"It can be a bottleneck in the energy transition.\" Concerns about excess electricity in Spain have sparked discussions about the need to speed up the \"electrification\" of the economy, which means phasing out fossil fuels. The Sanchez government has set a goal that by 2030, 34 percent of the economy will switch to electricity. \"This process is taking place slowly and we need to speed it up,\" says UNEF's Jose Donoso. \"Electricity is the cheapest and most competitive way to produce clean energy. We need plants and facilities that use electricity instead of fossil fuels.\" [Electric cars: Where are the Balkans compared to Europe](https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat/srbija-68510444?xtor=AL-73-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bvijesti%5D-%5Blink%5D-%5Bserbian%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D) [What are heat pumps and are they the future of heating in Serbia](https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat/srbija-67025820?xtor=AL-73-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bvijesti%5D-%5Blink%5D-%5Bserbian%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D) A complete transition to electricity is considered unrealistic, as the transition will be difficult for some important sectors such as the chemical and metal industries. However, Donoso and many others believe there are opportunities for faster electrification. For example, Spain lags behind many European countries in terms of the installation of heat pumps in homes and the use of electric cars, which only make up about six percent of vehicles in the country. Picinato agrees that electrification is key, but says there are other ways to solve the supply and demand problem. Among them are a faster pace of phasing out nuclear power and increasing energy storage capacity. \"In order to provide the necessary flexibility, which enables a better balancing of production and demand during the day and during the night, we need to engage more people and more industries in the management of electricity demand,\" he says.

The report said the Egyptian side has intensified communication with both sides to achieve calm before enforcing its three-stage Gaza truce proposal, stressing efforts are being made to \"stop escalations and implement a ceasefire successfully.\" A Hamas delegation has headed to Cairo to enforce the Egyptian proposal, an Egyptian security source told Xinhua on Monday. The source said Egypt has informed the Israeli side of Hamas's acceptance of the Egyptian proposal, adding that the Israeli delegation will arrive in Cairo on Tuesday to complete discussions on the implementation of the Gaza ceasefire and a hostage-for-prisoner swap deal at the invitation of Egypt. Earlier, Hamas announced its approval of \"a proposal that meets its demands of ceasing fire, reconstructing the strip, returning the displaced to their areas of residence, and swapping prisoners with Israel.\" Meanwhile, a Hamas source told Xinhua that the Gaza ceasefire proposal presented by Egypt and Qatar includes three stages, each lasting 42 days. The source said the first stage involved a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from the \"Netzarim axis,\" a zone in central Gaza that separates the northern and southern Palestinian enclave, as well as the return of displaced persons to their residential areas in northern Gaza. Also, this stage would bring out a 10-hour daily cessation of Israeli airstrikes and a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, as well as the release of approximately 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners, the source added. The source noted that the proposal stipulates a complete withdrawal of the Israeli army from the coastal area and a permanent cessation of military operations and hostilities during the second stage, while the blockade on the strip would be lifted in the third stage. The source emphasized that \"the ball is now in the Israeli side's court,\" noting that the United States is committed to ensuring the agreement's implementation. Also on Monday, Israel Defense Forces Spokesman Daniel Hagari said Israel was reviewing \"seriously\" the Egyptian proposal earlier approved by Hamas. \"We are examining every response and answer very seriously, exploring every possibility regarding the issue of negotiations and the return of hostages,\" Hagari said at a press briefing. However, the Israeli army was in parallel continuing preparation for a ground assault on Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, where about 1.2 million displaced people have been seeking refuge. \"Simultaneously, we continue to operate actively in the Gaza Strip and will continue to do so,\" said Hagari, adding that the military announced in the morning the beginning of the evacuation of civilians from eastern Rafah \"as part of the preparation for a ground operation in the region.\" The Israeli war cabinet unanimously decided on Monday to continue the operation in Rafah to exert military pressure on Hamas to promote the release of Israeli hostages and to achieve other goals of the war, according to a statement from the Israeli Prime Minister's Office. The statement confirmed that the proposal approved by Hamas is far from meeting Israel's core demands and Israel will send a delegation to Cairo to exhaust every possibility of reaching an agreement acceptable to Israel. Qatar, Egypt, and the United States are seeking to reach a deal for a prisoner exchange and a second ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, following the first one that ended last November. Israel has launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, following Hamas's surprise attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people.

    "text": "JUEVES, 15 de agosto de 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Los empleados afroamericanos en un lugar de trabajo tóxico son más susceptibles a la depresión y a la pérdida de sueño que los blancos, según una investigación reciente.\nLos trabajadores negros que eran maltratados por los empleadores dormían aproximadamente 100 minutos menos por noche que los trabajadores blancos o las personas negras que no sufrían maltrato, mostraron los resultados.\nTambién eran más propensos a desarrollar síntomas de depresión, encontraron los investigadores.\nLa investigación de seguimiento reveló que esta respuesta podría deberse a la historia de prejuicios raciales de Estados Unidos, apuntaron los investigadores.\nLos empleados negros maltratados tenían casi ocho veces más probabilidades de percibir prejuicios atribuidos a su raza que los empleados blancos maltratados, encontraron los investigadores.\nLos empleados blancos eran menos propensos a atribuir el maltrato a la raza y podían deshacerse de él más fácilmente, mostraron los resultados.\n\"Nuestros hallazgos no pretenden responsabilizar a los empleados afroamericanos por ser demasiado sensibles, sino informar a las organizaciones de que el maltrato se experimenta en el contexto de la identidad de uno\", señaló el investigador Erik Gonzalez-Mule, catedrático de gestión y emprendimiento de la Facultad de Negocios de la Universidad de Indiana.\n\"Las organizaciones deben esforzarse por crear un lugar de trabajo inclusivo para sus empleados negros, y deben encontrar formas de reducir el maltrato en el lugar de trabajo, por ejemplo, implementando medidas de responsabilidad o fomentando la intervención de los transeúntes\", añadió González-Mule en un comunicado de prensa de la universidad.\nPara este estudio, el equipo primero analizó los datos recopilados de más de 3,500 personas como parte de un estudio sobre la salud de la mediana edad realizado por el Instituto sobre el Envejecimiento de la Universidad de Wisconsin-Madison.\nSe preguntó a los participantes sobre el maltrato en el lugar de trabajo, y a algunos se les pidió que usaran dispositivos que monitoreaban su sueño o completaran cuestionarios para evaluar los síntomas de depresión.\nLos datos mostraron que el maltrato en el lugar de trabajo se asoció con la depresión y la pérdida de sueño, pero solo para los empleados negros.\nEn una segunda fase del estudio, los investigadores reclutaron a unas 500 personas en línea y les pidieron que recordaran un caso en el que se sintieran maltratados por un compañero de trabajo o un jefe.\nLas personas afroamericanas eran más propensas a atribuir ese maltrato a su raza, mostraron los resultados.\nLos hallazgos se publicaron en una edición reciente de la revista Journal of Applied Psychology.\nLos investigadores argumentaron que es posible que las empresas deban tomar medidas adicionales más allá de hablar de boquilla sobre la diversidad, la equidad y la inclusión.\n\"Muchos de ellos se han centrado predominantemente en el aspecto de la diversidad, y la mayor parte de la atención se ha centrado simplemente en la dotación de personal para un lugar de trabajo más diverso\", escribió el equipo en el estudio.\n\"Alentamos a los gerentes a prestar atención a la línea a menudo citada, de que 'la diversidad está siendo invitada a la fiesta; A la inclusión se le pide que baile\". El maltrato en el lugar de trabajo es la antítesis de la inclusión, incluso si se aplica de manera consistente a través de líneas raciales\", agregaron.\nMás información\nLa Asociación Americana de Psicología ofrece más información sobre los lugares de trabajo tóxicos.\nFUENTE: Universidad de Indiana, comunicado de prensa, 9 de agosto de 2024",
