    "title": "Warsi Brothers to enthral Chennai on New Year eve with a Sufi concert",
    "text": "This New Year's eve, Chennai is all set to get a ruhani (divine) touch as eminent Qawwals Amjad Ahmed Khan Warsi and Asad Ahmed Khan Warsi is all set to drench music aficionadoes with some soulful Sufi numbers. Indulge caught up with the musicians of the Dilli Gharana Qawwal Bacche, popularly known as the Warsi Brothers, ahead of their concert in the city. Excerpts from the chat with Asad Warsi....\nWhat can we expect from your Sufi edition this time around?\nOur usual repertoire comprises the evergreen songs Dama Dam Mast Qalander and Mere Rashke Qamar along with a medley of popular Bollywood Sufiyana numbers, including Kun Faya Kun, Khwaja Mera Khwaja and Maula Mere Maula. People always place a farmayish (request) for these songs. It's exciting to be back in Chennai. The audience here knows their music well and is fantabulous.\nUnlike in many other parts of the country, Hindi or Urdu are not the predominantly spoken languages in Tamil Nadu. Do you take any extra endeavour in such cases so that the Qawwalis resonate with the audiences?\nThere are a lot of people who listen to Qawwali in Chennai. We have always received a lot of love from the audience here. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan saab's songs have a massive reach among people as connoisseurs tend to lean toward time-honoured songs.\nWe have also performed at the Hazrat Moti Baba Dargah in Chennai. When you perform Sufiyana numbers at a dargah, the ambience there is out of the world as the precinct metamorphoses into a veritable devotional space. The listeners and performers are transported to a different realm altogether. It was a goosebump-inducing moment there.\nWhat exactly does the word Sufi mean?\nThe word Sufi can be likened to a sant (holy person or a saint), who seeks to find the truth of divine love. A Sant is pure in his body, mind and soul. Just like sants sing bhajans, sufis sing qawwalis. Sufi refers to devotional music and also means white and clean.\nHailing from an eminent lineage of Sufi musicians and having performed qawwalis for quite some time now, how has the genre, which carries the element of mysticism, evolved in the years?\nThere has been a sea change. For instance, Sufi music has reached a wider audience today, and the cinema industry has been a major shot in the arm for the feat. Credit goes to musicians like Rahman bhai (AR Rahman), Pritamji and Ajay-Atul. The songs, too, are getting better and better by the day. Take the case of the Sufi number, Shah Ka Rutba from Agneepath. It is so well made.\nWho do you think has churned out some of the best Sufi numbers in the industry?\nWithout an iota of doubt, Rahman bhai! His Sufi music has had a huge influence on people and is closest to the echoes and elements of the genre. My pick from his repertoire is Khwaja Mere Khwaja (from Jodhaa Akbar). The song touches your heart and rooh (soul) deep within. It is one of his best compositions in the genre.\nComing back to live recitals, how does one appreciate a qawwali, especially when they are attending a Sufi concert for the first time?\nThe most beautiful facet of music is that it transcends boundaries and barriers. The reason even foreigners rejoice in the genre despite not understanding the language or the format is that music is language-agnostic. All you need to do is just dive into the music and soak in the rhythm.\nHow are you spending the New Year in Chennai?\nWe will probably go around the Marina beach and make our customary visit to the Hazrat Moti Baba Dargah.\nTAGS Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan Warsi Brothers AR Rahman Pritam Ajay-Atul",

    "title": "Masciarri: \"Serve sicurezza. Sì al badge di cantiere\"",
    "text": "In questo drammatico scenario la Fillea Cgil Umbria (settore edilizia) ribadisce l’urgenza di alzare il livello di qualità e sicurezza, anche alla luce dei dati allarmanti sulle morti sul lavoro . \"Non si può parlare di sostenibilità o pensare ad un futuro sostenibile sulle spalle di lavoratori precari, sottopagati o non tutelati. Occorre rafforzare la formazione, la contrattazione di anticipo, il ruolo della bilateralità e il presidio sindacale nei cantieri, tanto più in una fase in cui lo scandalo milanese ha messo in luce il rischio di nuove speculazioni e opacità\" afferma con nettezza la segretaria generale Fillea Cgil Umbria, Elisabetta Masciarri. L’Umbria resta in zona rossa per incidenza di morti sul lavoro, superiore del 25% all’incidenza media nazionale.\n\"È un dato che fa male, ma che purtroppo non sorprende. La cultura della prevenzione è ancora troppo debole, e troppo spesso si taglia sulla sicurezza per contenere i costi. Le cause sono note: discontinuità e precarietà lavorativa e contrattuale, subappalti a cascata, imprese con tempi di consegna capestro a cui si aggiunge anche il problema sul fronte ispettivo. Nel recente rapporto Inail si evidenzia infatti, come tra il 2022 e il 2024, le aziende ispezionate nel nostro Paese siano diminuite drasticamente a causa della carenza di organico, passando da 9.267 a 7.735\".\nA suo avviso quali strumenti servono per rafforzare sicurezza e legalità nei cantieri umbri?\n\"Serve un nuovo impulso strategico, che vada oltre i protocolli di facciata. Per questo abbiamo accolto con favore il rinnovato \"Tavolo Tecnico per le Costruzioni, le Infrastrutture e la Sicurezza nei Cantieri\" rinominato con deliberazione della Giunta Regionale n. 580 dell’11 giugno 2025 su proposta dell’assessore Francesco De Rebotti, ma servono azioni operative: la patente a crediti non ha prodotto i risultati attesi, mentre dobbiamo puntare sul badge di cantiere , un tesserino elettronico collegato al sistema bilaterale che consenta di sapere chi si trova in cantiere in ogni momento. Si tratta di una best practice già prevista nel protocollo Sisma 2016, sperimentata a Roma per i lavori del Giubileo, che deve diventare realtà anche qui. Altrimenti, senza un coordinamento forte e senza strumenti innovativi, la sicurezza resterà solo sulla carta\"\nQuali dunque le priorità per il futuro del settore?\n\"Nel nostro Paese c’è la necessità forte di rimettere mano al patrimonio edilizio esistente, che va riqualificato secondo criteri di sostenibilità ambientale e sicurezza sismica. Non basta rincorrere i bonus: serve una strategia industriale di lungo periodo, capace di andare oltre gli incentivi temporanei e affrontare il grande ritardo che abbiamo nella digitalizzazione dei cantieri. Tenendo anche conto che il recente inserimento della nostra regione nella Zes, zona economica speciale, potrebbe favorire occasioni di rilancio per le imprese. Ma tutto questo non può prescindere dal lavoro di qualità: più sicurezza, più formazione e una contrattazione solida. Solo così la riqualificazione diventa occasione di sviluppo vero, e non l’ennesima stagione di interventi spot destinata a esaurirsi\".\nM.N",

    "text": "A roomful of Texas lawmakers and Gov. Gregg Abbott joined President Donald Trump on a phone call on Wednesday to reaffirm Republican commitment to universal school choice in the Lone Star State.\nThe meeting took place in Austin during a break from the House floor. The legislation, which was already approved by the state Senate, earmarks $1 billion for private school vouchers in the first year, or up to $10,000 per selected child.\nIt also provides up to $2,000 for homeschooling expenses and up to $30,000 for special education students who choose a different school. Low-income students would receive priority consideration. The Legislature could increase the allocation in future years based on interest from Texas families.\nA vote on the measure, Senate Bill 2, was postponed on Wednesday afternoon so House members could first discuss the $8 billion public school appropriations bill—House Bill 2—which has implications for universal school choice because many Democrats have said increased funding on public schools, especially in the way of special education, should take priority over school measures.\nThe bill passed 144–4 and now goes to the state Senate.\nX.\n“It’s [Texas] leading in energy and leading in jobs,” Trump said. “And now we’re going to be leading in education too. I just think it’s a really forward-thinking vote.”\nUniversal school choice legislation has failed in the past, but several Republicans who opposed it, some of them in very rural areas where there are no alternatives to public schools, were not reelected last year. Texas Policy Research, a nonprofit that reports on the state Legislature, indicates that there are enough Republicans in the House to push through school choice even if all 62 Democrats in that branch oppose it.\nOn the House floor on Wednesday, Democrats wore “I Love Public Schools” stickers on their lapels.\nDemocrats have argued that Texas universal school choice allows private schools to deny students admission even though those vouchers are paid with taxpayer dollars that would otherwise go to public schools.\nThey have also said that many schools in urban areas and suburbs charge more than $40,000 per year and wouldn’t be attainable for low-income recipients.\nThere appeared to be bipartisan support for the $8 billion public school appropriations bill despite some concerns about funding inequities among some schools for programs such as bilingual instruction.\nDemocrats and Republicans continued to make amendments to House Bill 2 into the afternoon.\nRep. Brad Buckley (R-Salado) said the public school appropriations package includes more funding per student, significant salary hikes for teachers, additional money for teacher certifications and training, and more than $1 billion for special education programs.\n“It’s the largest school funding bill in Texas history,” he said.",

    "text": "Según un informe, los efectos de los químicos tóxicos se subestiman y su impacto en el cáncer podría igualar al del consumo de cigarrillos\nLas sustancias químicas tóxicas presentes en el aire, los alimentos y el agua están fuertemente vinculadas a una gran cantidad de problemas ambientales y graves afecciones de salud, entre ellas el cáncer , la obesidad , la demencia , la infertilidad y el TDAH .\nA través de un nuevo informe , un grupo de ivestigadores describe la toxicidad como “la amenaza más subestimada a la que se enfrenta la humanidad” y advierte que “la contaminación del cuerpo humano es endémica”.\nSegún el documento, los riesgos para la salud humana y del planeta están “ampliamente subestimados” y el impacto del uso de plaguicidas en las tasas de cáncer podría ser comparable al del tabaquismo.\nEn el estudio también se detectó más de 3.600 sustancias químicas sintéticas en el cuerpo humano, provenientes de materiales que están en contacto con los alimentos, como envases y pesticidas. Al menos 80 de estas sustancias se consideran especialmente peligrosas para la salud.\nSustancias químicas conocidas como PFAS (sustancias perfluoroalquiladas y polifluoroalquiladas) fueron detectadas en casi todas las personas analizadas. En Europa, el 14  % de los adolescentes presentaron niveles en sangre lo suficientemente altos como para representar un riesgo grave para la salud.\nEntre los hallazgos más alarmantes del estudio está la relación entre el uso de pesticidas y enfermedades como la leucemia, el linfoma no Hodgkin y los cánceres de vejiga, colon e hígado. Incluso se sugiere que la exposición prenatal a pesticidas podría aumentar en más del 50 % el riesgo de que los niños desarrollen leucemia o linfoma.\nEn el informe también se reunió evidencia que muestra que los químicos sintéticos a los que están expuestas las personas han contribuido al descenso global en la cantidad de espermatozoides. Por ejemplo, se ha encontrado que los hombres con altos niveles de ciertas sustancias PFAS presentan menos de la mitad del conteo normal de esperma en comparación con quienes tienen niveles bajos.\nEn un contexto de aumento en las tasas de cáncer, caída de la fertilidad y alza de enfermedades crónicas, el equipo detrás del informe advierte que el enfoque internacional actual para gestionar los químicos sintéticos es “inadecuado” y “mal entendido”. Por ello, piden una acción más coordinada a nivel global y una mejor estandarización para proteger tanto a las personas como al planeta.\nEl informe, titulado ‘El tsunami invisible’, fue elaborado por el equipo científico de Deep Science Ventures en colaboración con la Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment. Surgió tras una investigación de ocho meses que incluyó el análisis de estudios científicos revisados por pares, además de entrevistas con investigadores, líderes de organizaciones sin fines de lucro, emprendedores e inversionistas.\nSegún los investigadores, la economía industrial ha generado más de 100 millones de sustancias químicas nuevas, y actualmente unas 350,000 se utilizan de forma comercial. Desde la década de 1950, su producción se ha incrementado 50 veces. Advierten que la exposición a químicos tóxicos, a través del aire, el agua y los alimentos, tiene su origen en compuestos derivados de combustibles fósiles, como el petróleo y el gas natural, que son la base de muchos productos industriales.\nEl equipo advirtió que la producción de sustancias químicas persistentes, un grupo de compuestos tóxicos que permanecen en el ambiente durante largos períodos, ha crecido tanto que ya se sobrepasó un “límite seguro para el planeta”. Como ejemplo, señalaron que las PFAS han “contaminado todo el planeta”: se han detectado niveles en el agua de lluvia que superan los límites seguros para el consumo humano y estas sustancias están presentes en la sangre de casi toda la población mundial.\nLa contaminación no persistente también está presente en casi todas partes. Según la Organización Mundial de la Salud ( OMS ), el 99 % de la población mundial respira aire con niveles de contaminación que superan los límites recomendados.\nEl equipo señaló que el informe presenta vínculos “fuertes”, tanto causales como correlativos, entre la exposición a sustancias tóxicas y una amplia variedad de problemas graves de salud humana, como cáncer, obesidad , Alzheimer , complicaciones en el embarazo, TDAH, infertilidad, enfermedades cardíacas y respiratorias.\nMás allá del impacto en la salud humana, advirtieron que los químicos tóxicos también están causando daños “visibles y generalizados” en los ecosistemas, afectando la biodiversidad y el equilibrio natural del medio ambiente .\n“En esta investigación, que recopila trabajos revisados por pares, se demuestra que la humanidad está enfrentando una exposición química masiva, y ampliamente subestimada, a través de los alimentos, el aire y el agua”, señaló Adam Tomassi-Russell, director de Clima en Deep Science Ventures.\n“El problema es de gran escala y la evidencia muestra que necesitamos un cambio profundo en cómo entendemos, financiamos e innovamos para enfrentar esta crisis”, advierten en el informe.\nFuente",

    "text": "PHOENIX – Arizona National parks and forests are already feeling a strain on resources after President Donald Trump’s executive order for a federal hiring freeze and extensive firings.\nGrand Canyon National Park, one of the state’s 22 national park sites , reported wait times being twice as long as usual just a week after the National Park Service and National Forest Service fired thousands. The park lost four toll operators, according to The Washington Post , despite being the second most visited park in the country. The park service fired an estimated 1,000 employees.\nThe Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency has tried to slash numerous areas of federal funding – including for national parks and forests. A federal hiring freeze went into effect Jan. 20, but the park service has since been cleared to fill thousands of seasonal positions.\nWhile national parks are part of the Department of the Interior, national forests are part of the Department of Agriculture, which defended Trump’s decision to cut positions.\nA saguaro cactus stands near the Twisted Sister trailhead in Tonto National Forest on Feb. 24, 2025, in Maricopa County. (Photo by Alexis Heichman /Cronkite News)\n“As part of this effort, USDA has made the difficult decision to release about 2,000 probationary, non-firefighting employees from the Forest Service. To be clear, none of these individuals were operational firefighters,” a USDA spokesperson wrote. “It’s unfortunate that the Biden administration hired thousands of people with no plan in place to pay them long term.”\nThough USDA officials say 2,000 employees were let go, a union says the number is closer to 3,400 workers.\nOthers have been less enthusiastic about the decision to release so many positions. Matthew Nelson, executive director of the Arizona Trail Association , said the decision is most likely to affect residents of the Valley who travel around the state to access natural lands.\n“Most of the public lands that we love and enjoy – so these are national forests, Bureau of Land Management lands, national parks – they’re all managed by federal agencies, and right now, those systems are being completely dismantled,” Nelson said.\nIn 2023, outdoor recreation added over $14 billion to the Arizona GDP , according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n“Beyond just the economic value of outdoor recreation, what it provides in terms of healthy living, I think it really, for me, defines what it means to be an Arizonan,” Nelson said. “That’s why I live here, and why I’ve pursued the job and the lifestyle that I have. If that were to ever change, it would completely transform how I see Arizona and America.”\nBill Wade, executive director of the Association of National Park Rangers , said though the “Valentine’s Day massacre” of firings wasn’t a complete surprise, the extent wasn’t anticipated.\n“That’s kind of using the broad sword rather than the scalpel,” Wade said.\nWade said those affected received an email at 4 p.m. Feb. 14 and were given an hour and a half to return any government equipment. The National Park Service maintains it will continue hiring seasonal staff for better visitor experience.\n“The National Park Service is hiring seasonal workers to continue enhancing the visitor experience as we embrace new opportunities for optimization and innovation in workforce management,” a spokesperson wrote. “We are focused on ensuring that every visitor has the chance to explore and connect with the incredible, iconic spaces of our national parks.”\nIn a social media post about the Grand Canyon, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said the “Trump administration’s removal of essential workers undermines our economy and ability to showcase one of the greatest natural wonders of the world.” On Friday, Hobbs said despite the challenges at the Grand Canyon, she would not use state resources to aid the park, according to the Arizona Capitol Times .\nVolunteers and employees of the park service around the state have said Arizonans and tourists will likely feel the fallout of fewer resources.\n“When this workforce continues to be diminished, it’ll also affect our ability” to maintain trails, Nelson said. “We also need our partners at the Forest Service and the BLM and the National Park Service to be engaged in that process. Otherwise, everything falls apart.”\nCronkite News reporter Emily Fox-Million contributed to this article.\n(Video by Emily Fox-Million /Cronkite News)",
