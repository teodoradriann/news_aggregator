    "text": "The Presbyterian Church in America has issued a statement of repentance after one of its websites published guidance advising illegal immigrants on how to avoid U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention.\nThe since-deleted page, published in January by the PCA’s Mission to North America, provided recommendations such as not carrying documents that show one’s country of origin and not disclosing information about criminal history. The guidance went viral on X last week, prompting swift backlash.\nBreaking News . Spirit-Filled Stories . Subscribe to Charisma on YouTube now!\nFollowing the removal of the resource , MNA Director Irwyn Ince released a statement of repentance, acknowledging the mistake:\nMission to North America serves the PCA for the advancement of Christ’s kingdom through our churches in the U.S. and Canada. We do this through a two-pronged focus on church planting and church vitality. Our church planting efforts facilitate starting and supporting new PCA churches. Our church vitality efforts provide ministry resources that enable our churches to grow in their outward facing missional engagement in their communities, loving neighbors as our Lord commands (Matt. 22:39). One such long-standing MNA ministry is our Refugee and Immigrant Ministry.\nRecently, we posted links on our webpage to external organizations offering a wide range of recommendations and frequently asked questions on immigration. MNA’s leadership erroneously allowed the posting of content that advised undocumented persons on ways to avoid being detained by authorities.\nWe also apologize for causing confusion and consternation in our church. We have removed all the previously posted information from our website.\nMNA’s Refugee & Immigrant Ministry, along with other MNA ministries, seeks to serve our churches with resources that enable them to faithfully follow our Lord’s call to love the stranger. However, MNA does not engage in providing legal advice, political campaigning or partisan positions. The information we post going forward will provide ecclesiastical resources in line with our Confession for guidance on the matter.\nThe MNA Permanent Committee is holding its Spring Meeting during the first week of March and this issue is docketed for further focused discussion as part of the Committee’s regular oversight of MNA’s ministries. The Committee does this work on behalf of the General Assembly of the PCA, which meets annually in June.\nGet your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up-to-date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more!\nAs reported by The Christian Post, Zachary Groff, senior pastor at Antioch Presbyterian Church in Greer, South Carolina, and a member of the committee overseeing MNA, said many in the denomination were “very, very alarmed” by the guidance.\n“The rank-and-file of the PCA is not at all pleased or supportive of what was published,” Groff said, calling it a “grave error in judgment.”\nThank you for visiting MyCharisma.

    "title": "Bella stagione subito rovinata dal calo delle temperature? Il rischio, dove e quando",
    "text": "Meteo, “calo marcato delle temperature”. Dove colpisce, l'avviso di Sottocorona Che tempo ci aspetta nei prossimi giorni? A rispondere ad una delle domande più ricorrenti nei discorsi tra gli italiani è Paolo Sottocorona, meteorologo di La7, che si collega come sempre con la puntata di Omnibus per fare un quadro della situazione meteo: “Ci sono queste nuvole un poco più bianche significa un poco più intense, ma soltanto sul mare non sulla terra, stanno comunque scendendo verso sud. Durante la notte hanno attraversato le zone del centro, con qualche pioggia”. [\"Ciclone della Colomba\" a Pasqua: quando \"il momento clou\"](https://www.iltempo.it/attualita/2024/03/21/news/meteo-previsioni-pasqua-ciclone-colomba-quando-maltempo-ilmeteoit-38822083/) Ed ecco il quadro delle previsioni giorno per giorno: “La previsione per la giornata di oggi, venerdì 22 marzo, ancora vede queste piogge, sulle zone del centro in mattinata di piogge già non ce ne sono più, qualcuno al sud, debole. Sulle altre zone sereno o comunque ampie schiarite. Nella giornata di domani, sabato 23 marzo, era previsto un peggioramento sulle zone di nordest per una specie di sconfinamento di una perturbazione che passa al di là dell’arco alpino, invece oggi la previsione è per qualche fenomeno relativamente intenso, molto più ristretto rispetto a quello che sembrava ieri, quindi parte del Trentino Alto Adige, l’alto Veneto, il Friuli Venezia Giulia, ma solo sulle zone Alpine e prealpine. Al centro e al sud qualche nuvola, qualche velatura, qualche debolissima pioviggine, che vanno dette però difficile che poi siano significative. Poi arriviamo alla giornata di domenica 24 marzo, in cui le zone del nordest hanno un miglioramento, però fra le zone del centro, del sud e della penisola balcanica ci sono zone con piogge un pochino più estese, quelle che riguardano le zone del centro e del sud nostro sono appena moderate, una piccola incertezza, è una perturbazione in esaurimento che scende in queste zone e quindi lascia qualche qualche possibile pioggia”. [Settimana di Pasqua con sorprese: prima temporali e poi caldo nordafricano](https://www.iltempo.it/attualita/2024/03/21/news/meteo-pasqua-temporali-caldo-nordafricano-previsioni-3bmeteo-38819154/) Il meteorologo della rete di Urbano Cairo si focalizza infine sulle temperature massime: “Per la giornata di oggi c'è qualche leggera diminuzione sulle zone interne fra centro e sud, proprio per il passaggio di queste nuvole, ma sulle altre regioni, quelle del nord e quelle del centro, i valori vanno facilmente anche a superare i 20 gradi. Se guardiamo la tendenza si comincia a vedere qualcosa che riguarda l'inizio della prossima settimana sostanzialmente, perché se fra centro e sud ci sono leggeri aumenti, diminuzioni non forti sull'Italia però guardate al di là delle Alpi, su Francia, Svizzera, ancora anche l’Austria, beh c'è un calo di temperature piuttosto marcato - segnala Sottocorona -.

    "title": "UN Security Council demands Iran-backed Yemen rebels halt their attacks on ships in Mideast waters",
    "text": "UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council on Thursday approved a resolution demanding Yemen's Houthi rebels halt all attacks on ships and urged that the disruption to maritime security in a critical Middle East waterway be urgently addressed.\nThe resolution made no mention that the Iran-backed rebels claim they are staging the attacks because of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\nThe resolution, which also extended the requirement that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres report monthly on the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, was approved by a 12-0 vote, with Russia, China and Algeria abstaining.\nShipping has reduced drastically through the route crucial to Asian, Middle East and European markets in a campaign the Houthis say will continue as long as the war rages in the Gaza Strip.\nThe resolution condemns the Houthis' continuing attacks, which the rebels say are aimed at ending the war in Gaza, now in its ninth month — emphasizing the need to address root causes, ''including the conflicts contributing to regional tensions and the disruption to maritime security.\"\nSparked by Hamas' surprise attack on Oct. 7 in which the militants stormed into southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage, the war has so far killed over 37,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants.\nThe Houthis have targeted more than 60 vessels in the waterway, firing missiles and drones. Four sailors have been killed, one vessel was seized and two others have been sunk in Rebel attacks since November.\nThe Houthis maintain they target ships linked to Israel, the United States or Britain. However, many of the vessels attacked have little or no connection to the Israel-Hamas war — including some bound for Iran.\nIn response, a U.S.-led airstrike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, including a series of strikes on May 30 that killed at least 16 people and wounded 42, according to the rebels.\nYemen has been engulfed in civil war since 2014, when the Houthis seized much of northern Yemen and forced he internationally recognized government to flee from the capital, Sanaa. A Saudi-led coalition intervened the following year in support of government forces, and in time the conflict turned into a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\nThough fighting has decreased considerably since a six-month truce in 2022, the war has devastated the Arab region's poorest country and created one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters.\nThursday's resolution, which was a follow-up resolution to one adopted Jan. 10 that condemned and demanded an immediate halt to Houthi attacks, ''urges caution and restraint to avoid further escalation of the situation in the Red Sea and the broader region.''\nSpeaking on behalf of the United States and Japan, which sponsored the resolution, U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood said after Thursday's vote that the Houthi attacks ''threaten international peace and security'' and that they are ''a global challenge'' that \"necessitates a global solution.\"\n\"With this resolution the council once again sends a clear message to the Houthis: Cease these attacks immediately,'' he said.\nHe stressed the need to deprive the Houthis of weapons, noting that the resolution reiterates all countries are required to implement a 2015 U.N. arms embargo on Houthis and others undermining Yemen's stability.\nRussia's deputy ambassador Anna Evstigneeva said Moscow supports the safety of navigation in the Red Sea and other waters adjacent to Yemen, but she accused the ''so-called U.S. coalition'' of using the January resolution to justify its attacks on the Houthis.\n''We urge all participants in the coalition to immediately halt illegal attacks and to transition to political and diplomatic means to reduce tensions in the waters adjacent to Yemen,'' Evstigneeva said.\nChina's deputy U.N. ambassador Geng Shuang said Beijing has repeatedly called on the Houthis to end their attacks on commercial ships but abstained as it did in January because some key elements in the resolution ''could have negative consequences and lead to further escalation of regional tensions.''\nHe pointed to actions by ''certain countries'' against Yemen that have not only killed civilians and damaged infrastructure, ''but also heightened security risks in the Red Sea waters.''\nAn immediate and lasting cease-fire in Gaza ''will help cool down the situation in Yemen and the Red Sea,'' Geng said.",

    "text": "Isaac Howard (Michigan State) netted the winner in the bottom of the seventh round of the shootout to help lift the U.S. National Junior Team to a 4-3 victory over Czechia in preliminary round play of the 2024 IIHF World Junior Hockey Championship Friday at Frolundaborg in Gothenburg, Sweden. Howard gave the U.S. the lead just 1:12 into the opening period. Eric Pohlkamp (Bemidji State) chipped the puck out of the American zone up to Frank Nazar (Michigan) who took off on a two-on-one with Howard. He slid the puck across the slot for Howard who beat Czech goaltender Michael Hrabal (UMass) five-hole. The U.S. had a pair of power-play opportunities in the first period but was not able to convert despite several good chances, including a one-timer from Jimmy Snuggerud (Minnesota). Czechia leveled the score at 15:40 after Jakub Stancl put one home from the top of the crease after a feed from behind the net. Adam Bares gave the Czech’s a 2-1 lead 6:23 into the second frame, but Team USA responded less than two minutes later when Will Smith (Boston College) netted a feed from Ryan Leonard (Boston College). Gabe Perreault (Boston College) drew an assist on the play as well. At 11:47, Robin Sapousek put a one-timer past goaltender Jacob Fowler (Boston College) for a 3-2 Czech lead, but the U.S. rallied less than three minute later when Ryan Chesley (Minnesota) sent a laser past Hrabal from the slate off Lane Hutson (Boston University) bumped the rebound of his own shot on goal out to Chesley. Cutter Gauthier (Boston College) nearly gave the U.S. the lead late in the final period, but his shot was blocked by a Czech defender. With the score knotted at 3-3 at the end of regulation, the game went to a five-minute three-on-three overtime period. The U.S. had a power play in the extra session and four total shots on goal but was unable to capitalize. The game went to a five-round shootout to decide the winner. With the Czechs up 1-0 heading to the bottom of the fifth, Perreault sent the game to extra rounds where Howard beat Hrabal two rounds later to secure a 4-3 victory for the U.S. Fowler made 20 saves in the contest and stopped six of seven shooters in the shootout. Team USA will play its final preliminary round game on New Year’s Eve against Slovakia. Opening faceoff is 12 p.m. local/6 a.m. EDT at Frolundaborg and the game can be seen live on NHL Network. NOTES: Lane Hutson was named the U.S. Player of the Game … Team USA outshot Czechia 34-23 … The U.S. was 0 for 3 on the power play while Czechia was 0 for 2 … With the win tonight, the U.S. has secured one of the top two spots in Group B for the tournament’s quarterfinals. Slovakia currently holds the No. 1 position in Group B with nine points, while the U.S. has eight. The winner of Sunday’s game between the two teams will earn the top spot in the group.",

    "text": "Former tabloid publisher testifies about scheme to shield his old friend Trump from damaging stories As Donald Trump was running for president in 2016, his old friend at the National Enquirer was scooping up potentially damaging stories about the candidate and paying out tens of thousands of dollars to keep them from the public eye. But when it came to the seamy claims by porn performer Stormy Daniels, David Pecker said he put his foot down. “I am not paying for this story,” he told jurors Thursday at Trump’s hush money trial, recounting his version of a conversation with Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen about the catch-and-kill scheme that prosecutors alleged amounted to interference in the race. Pecker was already $180,000 in the hole on other Trump-related stories by the time Daniels came along. “I didn’t want to be involved in this from the beginning.” Pecker’s testimony was a critical building block for the prosecution’s theory that their partnership was a way to illegally influence the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors are seeking to elevate the gravity of the history-making first trial of a former American president and the [first of four criminal cases](https://apnews.com/projects/trump-investigations-civil-criminal-tracker/) against Trump to reach a jury. But the hush money trial was just one of the consequential legal matters facing the Republican presidential candidate on Thursday. The [U.S. Supreme Court also heard arguments](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-capitol-riot-prosecution-immunity-72c885c07c77970d4380206f87b2d8ca) over whether Trump should be [immune from prosecution](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-immunity-prosecution-capitol-riot-9fd5dc5947dab82bbd18d3efcb4267d8) in a federal case over his efforts to reverse his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden. The high court justices appeared [likely to reject](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-capitol-riot-prosecution-immunity-72c885c07c77970d4380206f87b2d8ca) his immunity claim. In other legal woes, the hush money case includes a looming decision on [whether he violated a gag order](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-gag-order-hush-money-juan-merchan-f182e7d5c27967b86a59277fd24743e4) and should be held in contempt. His former lawyers and associates were indicted [in a 2020 election-related scheme in Arizona](https://apnews.com/article/arizona-fake-electors-charges-2020-election-9da5a7e58814ed55ceea1ca55401af85). And a New York judge rejected a request for a new trial in a defamation case that found Trump [liable for $83.3 million in damages](https://apnews.com/article/trump-carroll-defamation-trial-e4ea8b93cdeb29857864ffd8d14be888). But Trump has a long history of emerging unscathed from sticky situations — if not becoming even more popular. The high court arguments made it seem possible that he could benefit from a lengthy trial delay, possibly beyond November’s election. It was an unusual confluence politically, too, as the Trump started the day campaigning at a Manhattan construction site before heading to court, while the Supreme Court was hearing 2020-related issues. The outcome of the Supreme Court case will have lasting implications for future presidents, because the justices were seeking to answer the [never-before-asked question](https://apnews.com/article/trump-supreme-court-jan-6-immunity-38fd48f47324bf812e2194831ef75471) of whether and to what extent does a former president enjoy immunity from prosecution for conduct during his time in office. Trump had asked to skip his New York criminal proceedings for the day so he could sit in on the high court’s special session, but that request was denied by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who is overseeing Trump’s trial on [34 felony counts of falsifying business records](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-arraignment-hush-money-81225510ef7638494852816878f612f0) in connection with hush money payments. “I think the Supreme Court has a very important argument before it today,” Trump said outside the courtroom. “I should be there.” Instead, he sat at the defense table in a Manhattan courtroom with his lawyers, listening intently to his old friend testify how he and his publication parlayed rumor-mongering into splashy stories that smeared Trump’s opponents and, just as crucially, leveraged his connections to suppress unflattering coverage. Trump has maintained he is not guilty of any of the charges. In New York, he says the stories that were bought and squelched were false. “There is no case here. This is just a political witch hunt,” he said before court in brief comments to reporters. As Pecker testified in a calm, cooperative tone about risque tales and secret dealings, the atmosphere in the utilitarian 1940s courtroom was one of quiet attentiveness. Two Secret Service agents were stationed in the first row of the courtroom gallery directly behind Trump. Ten court officers stood around the room. Jurors intently listened, and some took notes. Pecker recalled that the publication bought a sordid tale from a New York City doorman and purchased accusations of an extramarital affair with former Playboy model Karen McDougal to prevent the claims from getting out. The breaking point for Pecker came with Daniels, who was eventually paid by Cohen to keep quiet over her claim of a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump. The ex-president denies it happened. Pecker recalled to the jury that he was dining with his wife the night after the public learned of the infamous 2005 “Access Hollywood” tape in which Trump discussed grabbing women sexually without asking permission, when then-editor Dylan Howard called with an urgent matter. Howard said he heard from Daniels’ representatives that she was trying to sell her story and that the tabloid could acquire it for $120,000, Pecker told jurors. Pecker was tapped out; he told Cohen as much. At the same time, Pecker advised that someone — just not him — should do something to prevent the story from going public. “I said to Michael, ‘My suggestion to you is that you should buy the story, and you should take it off the market because if you don’t and it gets out, I believe the boss will be very angry with you.’” Cohen followed his advice. Pecker testified that Trump later invited him to a White House dinner in July 2017 to thank him for helping the campaign. The ex-publisher said Trump encouraged him to bring anyone he wanted, recounting that the then-president told him, “It’s your dinner.” Pecker said that he and Howard, as well as some of his other business associates, posed for photos with Trump in the Oval Office. Pecker said others at the dinner included Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and press adviser Sean Spicer. At one point during the evening, Pecker said Trump asked him for an update on Karen McDougal. “How’s Karen doing?” he recalled Trump saying as they walked past the Rose Garden from the Oval Office to the dining room. “I said she’s doing well, she’s quiet, everything’s going good,” Pecker testified. But months later, in March 2018, the president became furious when McDougal gave an interview to CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Pecker testified. “I thought you had and we had an agreement with Karen McDougal that she can’t give any interviews or be on any TV channels,” Trump told Pecker by phone, the former National Enquirer publisher said. He said he explained to the then-president that the agreement had been changed to allow her to speak to the press after a November 2016 Wall Street Journal article about the tabloid’s $150,000 payout to McDougal. “Mr. Trump got very aggravated when he heard that I amended it, and he couldn’t understand why,” Pecker told jurors. In other developments, prosecutors argued Trump had again violated a gag order, all while waiting to hear from Merchan whether Trump would be held in contempt on other suspected violations. [Merchan](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-juan-merchan-hush-money-appeal-lawsuit-6abe221a7cb2ea670eb3ed1a7a134643) has barred the GOP leader from making public statements about witnesses, jurors and others connected to the case. Trump was dismissive about the looming decision. When asked by reporters if he would pay fines if so ordered, he replied, “Oh, I have no idea.” He then said, “They’ve taken my constitutional right away with a gag order.” A conviction by the jury would not preclude Trump from becoming president again, but because it is a state case, he would not be able to pardon himself if found guilty. The charge is punishable by up to four years in prison — though it’s not clear if the judge would seek to put him behind bars.",
