    "text": "Christian Beck's LawConnect shed its bridesmaid label in the Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race by claiming its first line honours victory in arguably the most exciting finish in years. The Christian Beck maxi crossed the Castray Esplanade finish line in Hobart in first place at 08.03.58am this morning in the time of 1 day 19 hours 03 minutes 58 seconds. In second place was the defending champion Andoo Comanche, skippered by John Winning Jnr for whom it was his last race in the boat after chartering the 100-footer for two years. Andoo Comanche finished 51 seconds behind in 1 day 19 hours 04 minutes and 49 seconds. It was the second closest finish in the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia race, with the closest being the seven second margin between top two, Condor and Apollo in 1982. LawConnect finished outside the race record of 1 day 9hrs 15min 24sec, set by the boat they beat today, LDV Comanche, which won line honours in 2017 with her then owners, Jim Cooney and Samantha Grant. But that did not matter in light of the dramatic finish to the 628 nautical mile race in which LawConnect and Andoo Comanche fought from start to finish. \"I can't believe that result. Honestly. It's a dream come true. I never thought it was possible, actually,\" said a smiling Beck after LawConnect docked at Kings Pier in Hobart. \"Because they took the lead pretty close to the finish line, we thought there's no way we could get it back,\" Beck said. \"But a wind gust came. It happened. So, it was a complete surprise, to be honest.\" Asked how the nerves of his crew were in the dying minutes of the race, Beck said: \"There were guys who sort of couldn't watch it and stuff like that. It was very nerve wracking.\" Beck said his joy of winning this year was heightened after falling short in previous years. The boat's run of misfires dates back to before his second place in the last three races. Beck first raced the boat, but as InfoTrack, in the 2017 Hobart, after buying it the from Anthony Bell, who had sailed it to line honours victory in a race record time as Perpetual Loyal in 2016. It was the fourth of five boats to finish inside Bell's record, but received a 20 percent penalty placing when a crew member failed to lodge a declaration at the finish, dropping the boat to 24th place. In 2018, Beck returned and placed fourth over the line. \"It does make you appreciate it more,\" said Beck, adding that he would return next year. LawConnect's win against the highly favoured Andoo Comanche was against the odds. Equally as amazing though, was how their duel ended in such a close match-racing battle. After stalking Andoo Comanche all night, it initially looked like LawConnect's chances were slipping away, as the defending champions got a 2nm lead in the crossing of Storm Bay. But LawConnect's crew did not give up and edged closer to Andoo Comanche on the Derwent River. By Sandy Bay and with 1.5nm to go, LawConnect had all but caught the leader. Then, in a brilliant slugfest of jibes between the two boats, the lead changed five times as they both tried to make best of the varying but light breezes. LawConnect only sealed the victory with its last jibe less than 50 metres before the finish. After finishing, and as is tradition, Beck was thrown into the water off King Pier by his crew. They then celebrated the win and receipt of the J.H. Illingworth Challenge Cup by spraying themselves with champagne. Beck lauded his crew, especially Sailing Master, Tony Mutter and tactician, Chris Nicholson. \"There's two guys that were really instrumental, Tony Multter and Chris Nicholson,\" he said. \"They have a lot to contend with. Firstly, the boat, I jokingly call a 's... box.' But compared to Comanche, it honestly is a 's...box. I know it looks good on TV, but you get up close to that boat and it's as rough as anything. \"Comanche is a beautiful boat. It's better in every way. It's four times lighter, etc. So, the fact that they can make that boat beat Comanche is amazing. \"Secondly, they had a pretty lean budget. And thirdly, they had the five corporates, including me, on the boat to deal with. None of us know all that much about sailing. \"So, to have all of that and still win the race, it's an incredible feat.\" For the full list of entries and more information about the race, visit rolexsydneyhobart.com.",

    "text": "KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI | AFP | Getty Images\nTravelers wait in line to check-in for their flights at the United Airlines Terminal 1 ahead of the Christmas Holiday at O'Hare International Airport on Dec. 22, 2022, in Chicago.\nThis holiday season won’t just be the most wonderful time of the year – it’ll also be record-breaking, with over 119 million people forecast to travel 50 or more miles away from home.\nThe projection is for 3 million more travelers than last year and 64,000 more than the previous record back in 2019, according to the auto club AAA .\nThe most popular mode of travel this holiday season will be by car, as 107 million are expected to drive between Dec. 21 and Jan. 1, a 12-day period that AAA notes is two days longer than the club’s defined holiday period in 2023 because of the days of the week on which Christmas and New Year’s Day fall.\nAir travel is expected to break last year’s record, with 7.85 million passengers flying during the 12-day timeframe, followed by 4.47 million people predicted to travel by train, bus and cruise – the highest amount in 20 years, according to AAA.\nTips for Holiday Travelers as New U.S. Consumer Protections Kick In Reuters Nov. 26, 2024\nAs over a hundred million people are expected to travel this holiday season, traffic delays on the roads and congestion in transit stations and airports will likely be heavier. The Transportation Security Administration is expecting to screen over 39 million people nationwide from Dec. 19 through Jan. 2.\nOn the roads, the worst traffic delays are expected to be on “the weekends before Christmas Day and New Year’s Day,” according to AAA and INRIX , a transportation analytics company. The delays nationwide could extend travel times by up to 30%. However, on those holidays themselves, as well as on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve, minimal traffic delays are expected.\n“With a near record number of auto travelers expected this holiday season, drivers should expect delays in and around major metro areas, with Sunday, December 22 expected to be the nation’s worst day to travel,” Bob Pishue, transportation analyst at INRIX, told AAA. “Our advice is to avoid traveling during peak commuting hours during the week. If schedules allow, leave bright and early or after the evening commute.”\nRegardless of when they leave, the millions of drivers this holiday season will benefit from lower gas prices compared to this same time last year, with the national average for a gallon of gas falling to $3.02 this week, just shy of breaking the $3 mark, which it reportedly hasn’t done nationally since May 2021.\nREAD:\nThe Best Christmas Light Displays\nThirty-one states, however, have average gas prices below $3 as of Dec. 13, according to AAA Fuel Prices . Oklahoma has the lowest average at $2.52, while Hawaii has the highest at $4.55. The state with the second highest gas price in the contiguous U.S. is California, with an average of $4.33 per gallon of regular gas.\nJoin the Conversation See Comments Tags: Christmas , Travel , holidays , Airlines\nRead More",

    "text": "Arsenal missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League as they slipped to a disappointing defeat to West Ham amid more VAR controversy.\nThe Gunners needed victory to replace Liverpool at the summit but lost 2-0 by the Hammers on a night where David Moyes finally landed a victory at the Emirates Stadium.\nFULL MATCH DETAILS\nHis West Ham side lost Kurt Zouma ahead of the game and Lucas Paqueta after just over half an hour but hit the front through Tomas Soucek's strike, awarded after VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build-up.\nA second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos secured the points and things could have been even better for the visitors had Said Benrahma not seen a last-gasp penalty saved by David Raya.\nMoyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United, so this was a long time coming for the Scot.\nArsenal laboured when they needed to continue their recent winning run in London derbies to go back to the top of the table.\nInstead, only captain Martin Odegaard could hold his head high on a night where their defence creaked and Gabriel Jesus was guilty of missing a couple of very good chances.\nTomas Soucek slams home the opener Arsenal started well, with some great touches in and around the West Ham box from Odegaard in particular.\nBut at the other end their defending left a lot to be desired, as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Magalhaes failed to deal with a simple ball into the middle.\nJarrod Bowen capitalised by latching onto the miscue and teed up Soucek to finish - the goal surviving a lengthy VAR check which could not ultimately make a call on if the ball had not gone out of play before Bowen's cutback.\nArsenal looked to respond although the goal gave West Ham something to defend, although Jesus found a way in behind with a subtle flick into Bukayo Saka, whose header was brilliantly saved by Alphonse Areola.\nPaqueta had been hurt in the warm-up and lasted just over half an hour, with his fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli curling an effort just wide for Arsenal as they continued in vain to find a leveller.\nThe hosts were getting closer, West Ham gifting possession as two passes saw Arsenal in on goal once more, this time Saka hitting the base of the post from an acute angle.\nFormer West Ham captain Declan Rice fired just over from 25 yards but it was another player coming back to haunt his former club who would find the back of the net soon after.\nMavropanos made just seven league starts in three years as an Arsenal player but returned to the Premier League last summer with the Hammers and headed them two goals ahead before the hour.\nArsenal keeper David Raya saves Said Benrahma's spot-kick Jesus then headed straight at Areola before sending another fine chance well over the bar moments after Arteta introduced Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson off the bench.\nAreola was on hand again to keep out a Leandro Trossard effort, with Vladimir Coufal clearing a William Saliba header off the line from the resulting corner.\nRice had come off the bench during a 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat on his return to West Ham earlier in the season and endured another night to forget here as he conceded a late penalty for tripping Emerson Palmieri in the box - only for Raya to keep out substitute Benrahma's tame spot-kick.",

    "title": "El viernes queda marcado por temperaturas de menos de 10 grados en media España",
    "text": "Las temperaturas de este viernes sobre media España quedarán enmarcadas por debajo de los diez grados, en una jornada con ascenso de temperaturas en las provincias costeras del Atlántico sur y el Mediterráneo peninsular. La predicción de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet), indica que se prevé que persista una situación de inestabilidad en la península y Baleares, con nubes abundantes y probables lluvias débiles en zonas de la mitad sur, el tercio nordeste y el entorno mediterráneo.\nEstas precipitaciones podrían ser más intensas y llegar a fuertes e ir con tormenta en el nordeste de Cataluña, la zona de Alborán y litorales del sureste peninsular. Asimismo, este viernes podría nevar débilmente en puntos del Sistema Central, el sur de la Ibérica, las montañas del sureste y, de forma más probable, el Pirineo. La cota de nieve se situará entre 1.200 y 1.600 metros.\nEn general, a lo largo del día se espera que las precipitaciones tiendan a menos y se abran cada vez más claros, aunque se mantendrán los chubascos en el oeste de Galicia. Canarias tendrá cielos nubosos en las islas montañosas con probables chubascos ocasionales, así como intervalos nubosos en el resto del archipiélago.\nNIVELES DE TEMPERATURAS EN LAS PROVINCIAS\nEn cuanto a las temperaturas, hará más frío en Ávila, Burgos, León, Segovia y Soria (7 grados), y Logroño, Palencia y Pamplona (8), y más calor en Las Palmas de Gran Canaria y Santa Cruz de Tenerife (22), y Almería, Melilla y Murcia (18).\nPor último, este viernes soplarán vientos moderados del norte y nordeste en la mitad norte del área mediterránea. A lo largo del día se espera una tendencia a rolar a componente oeste. En Canarias aparecerán vientos del este y del sureste con tendencia a arreciar.",
