    "text": "There are many ways today’s senior citizens are mistreated or disrespected, but one of the most severe is denial of medical care they paid for.\nAs a 38-year resident of this community and a 35-year volunteer on various boards and commissions, it was shocking to me that when my wife fell and was severely injured—while she received excellent care from the entire team of ER doctors, hospital doctors, resident medical students, ER and hospital nursing teams and therapists, as well as hospital management—United Healthcare, against recommendations from her doctors and entire medical team, is forcing her release from the hospital and denying acute physical therapy care at Los Robles East Campus facility.\nMy employer and I pay significant premiums for family coverage, only to find that artificial intelligence and bureaucrats denied care after repeated requests from hospital personnel and medical staff.\nViolence and physical retaliation directed at corporate executives is never the answer; however, good people must do whatever is necessary within the law to stop the scams, extortion and abuse perpetuated by United Healthcare.\nIn the past 29 years, nearly half a million dollars was taken by United Healthcare by myself and the company I work for; half of that was $244,000 from me directly. This amount does not include the thousand upon thousands of dollars paid by me directly that was not covered by United Healthcare. This also doesn’t include the tens of thousands of dollars taxed by Medicare over 53 years of working.\nThis financial shakedown must stop. Please write local, state and national officials and your local press, our voices must be heard, to save us all.\nRick Lemmo\nNewbury Park",

    "text": "Thursday 6th June, 2024 The outcome of India’s parliamentary election (2024) has led to a ‘perspective ambiguity’. Prime Minister Narendra Modi lost no time in declaring victory for the BJP-led NDA alliance, which secured 293 seats in the 543-member Parliament, but he must be a worried man. The BJP is short of 32 seats to form a government under its own steam; it has lost 63 seats or about 20% of its parliamentary strength. It had 303 seats in the previous Parliament, and that number has dropped to 240.\nModi has become the second Indian Prime Minister to win a third term. The first PM to do so was Jawaharlal Nehru. But Nehru won an outright majority in Parliament in 1962; Modi has had to depend on smaller parties in his alliance to retain his hold on power. Modi must be reeling from a sharp drop in his victory margin in his own constituency, Varanasi; it has decreased to 152,000 from 480,000 in 2019 whereas Modi’s bete noire, Rahul Gandhi, won Raebareli by a staggering 390,000 votes.\nModi, who reigned supreme with 303 seats in the previous Parliament, is now dependent on parties such as Nitish Kumar’s JD-U and Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP to form a government. He has had to lead an alliance of strange bedfellows. Both Kumar and Naidu were bitter critics of Modi. Kumar helped form the oppositional alliance, the INDIA bloc, before switching his allegiance to PM Modi. Naidu also closed ranks with the BJP in the run-up to the election. These politicians have been described as extremely ambitious and highly unpredictable, and whether Modi will be able to manage them and consolidate his grip on the NDA alliance remains to be seen. They will demand plum ministerial posts in return for their support. The TDP is said to be eyeing Transport and Health portfolios! That is the name of the game in coalition politics, where it is not uncommon for the tail to wag the dog, so to speak. These two political leaders are however not the only problem Modi will have to contend with. The next five years will feel like an eternity for PM Modi.\nNothing would have been more shocking for the BJP than its defeat in Uttar Pradesh’s Faizabad constituency, where the Ram Mandir has been built. Modi may have thought he would be able to win the Lok Sabha election hands down after the consecration of that temple, which became a centrepiece of the BJP’s election campaign. The BJP lost that seat to the Samajwadi Party! Modi must be disappointed that the Ram Mandir hype failed to trigger a massive wave of support for his party. This particular defeat signifies a massive setback for the BJP’s ethno-religious agenda.\nModi’s divisive election campaign failed to yield the desired result. The BJP’s failure to secure an outright majority could be attributed to a host of factors, some of them being the suppression of the Opposition, the arrogance of power, chronic unemployment, and the rising cost of living. The BJP also did not care to reimage itself in a positive light to attract the youth.\nModi will hereafter see the Congress-led INDIA bloc with 223 seats, in his rearview mirror. The Congress (99 seats) and its allies have eaten into the BJP support base considerably, but they have a long way to go before being able to capture power.\nThe bumpy ride ahead for the BJP-led coalition government to be formed may improve the INDIA bloc’s chances of bettering their electoral performance and turning the tables on the BJP and its allies in time to come. Modi will have a lot to worry about in his third term.\n ",

    "text": "Éducation Instruction en famille : comment l’encadrement renforcé a fait fondre la pratique\nUn rapport de la Cour des comptes souligne la baisse importante du nombre d’enfants instruits en famille, après le vote, en 2021, de la loi réglementant davantage cette pratique.\nUn serrage de vis qui a eu des effets. Depuis la loi du 24 août 2021 confortant le respect des principes de la République, ne fait plus l’école à la maison qui veut. Les familles qui le souhaitent doivent d’abord demander une autorisation, alors qu’auparavant, elles n’avaient qu’une simple déclaration à faire à la mairie et à l’Éducation nationale. Un encadrement plus strict critiqué par les associations défendant l’instruction en famille (IEF) et qui a eu des répercussions, comme le montre un rapport de la Cour des comptes paru mercredi. La réforme « a permis de davantage sécuriser, dans l’intérêt de l’enfant, le recours à cette modalité d’instruction », soulignent les Sages.\nPour l’année scolaire 2024-2025, première année de mise en œuvre complète du nouveau régime, 30 644 enfants (soit 0,3 % des 3-16 ans) ont été autorisés à être instruits en famille contre 72 369 en 2021-2022 (soit 0,6 %). Certes les demandes ont été moins nombreuses et la baisse démographique se ressent. Mais presque un quart des demandes d’autorisation (23 %) ont été refusées. Car pour obtenir l’aval des autorités, il faut pouvoir justifier sa demande en raison de l’état de santé de l’enfant ou de son handicap, de la pratique d’activités sportives ou artistiques intensives, de l’itinérance de la famille en France, de son éloignement géographique de tout établissement scolaire public ou de l’existence d’une situation propre à l’enfant motivant le projet éducatif. C’est ce dernier motif qui est le plus l’objet du refus d’autorisations. Refus qui génèrent le plus de recours et de saisines de la médiatrice de l’Éducation nationale.\nPar ailleurs, en 2024-2025, 17 refus ont été justifiés par l’inscription des personnes chargées de l’instruction au Fijait (Fichier des auteurs d’infractions terroristes) ou au Fijaisv (Fichier judiciaire automatisé des auteurs d’infractions sexuelles et violentes).\nDes contrôles à renforcer\nEn général, l’instruction en famille est souvent temporaire. « Pour la majorité des enfants, cela dure un an », souligne la Cour des comptes. Les enfants sont répartis sur l’ensemble du territoire même s’ils sont davantage présents dans le Centre, le Sud-Ouest et le Sud-Est. « Ils sont davantage représentés dans les espaces ruraux à faible densité de population », précisent les Sages.\nAvec la nouvelle loi, les moyens dédiés aux contrôles pédagogiques des familles faisant l’école à la maison ont été améliorés : 80 emplois d’inspecteurs ont ainsi été créés depuis 2022. Si toutes les familles pratiquant l’IEF font théoriquement l’objet d’un contrôle pédagogique annuel et que celui-ci est satisfaisant dans 90 % des cas, la Cour observe cependant que « les contrôles pédagogiques ne sont pas tous effectués ».\nLa réussite scolaire, une inconnue\nAutre point faible : « Le niveau et la réussite scolaire des enfants restent difficiles à mesurer », soulignent les Sages. Il n’existe pas non plus d’indicateurs permettant de renseigner leurs résultats au brevet ou au bac. D’où la recommandation de la Cour de rendre obligatoire pour les enfants qui sont instruits dans la famille, le passage des évaluations nationales à la fin de chaque cycle.\nPar ailleurs, si les mairies doivent théoriquement réaliser une enquête auprès des enfants instruits en famille dès la première année puis tous les deux ans, force est de constater que peu le font. La Cour des comptes suggère donc de mieux les informer sur cette mission et de leur fournir une trame type pour réaliser les enquêtes.",
