    "text": "A suggestion that three republicans were on holiday in Colombia rather than training rebels was said to be “insulting to (the) intelligence” of diplomats, archive documents show.\nThere was concern at the time that the arrest of the so-called Colombia Three in 2001 could damage the Northern Ireland peace process.\nThe incident happened after the IRA agreed on a way of disabling its arsenal, following months of slow progress.\nColombian authorities alleged that the men were training members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, also known as Farc.\nThe men were convicted of training rebels and sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2004; they were granted amnesty in 2020 as part of Colombia’s peace process.\nIn 2022, it was reported that their amnesty had been revoked.\nThe Colombia Three have always denied wrongdoing, maintaining they were in the country to observe Colombia’s peace negotiations.\nThe three men, who were travelling on false passports, Niall Connolly, James Monaghan, and Martin McCauley, were arrested on August 11 2001 at Bogota International Airport.\nIn newly released State documents, the discussion between top Irish and US officials in the aftermath of the arrests show that the US Special Envoy for Northern Ireland Richard Haass was angry at the incident.\nIn a meeting between Mr Haas and Ireland’s Ambassador to the US Sean O hUiginn, he said the men were “not on vacation, they were not promoting a peace process”.\n“It was not only implausible to try to put across such explanations but insulting to our intelligence.\n“A far better course would be to admit that a mistake had been made and say that it would not happen again.\n“It was far more likely that the detainees were involved in some kind of ‘transfer of knowhow about bomb-making’.”\nA briefing document written for the Department of Foreign Affairs detailed a meeting in Washington DC between Mr Haass and Ireland’s Ambassador to the US Sean Ó hUiginn.\nThe document notes that the Irish and British governments were “obviously in stocktaking mode to work out a strategy in relation to developments in the peace process, including of course the Colombia dimension”.\n“The benign explanation that the three might have been engaged in peace education was not sustainable.\n“Rather the choice was from the malign menu, for example, of some kind of weapons dealing, testing or training,” the note dated September 7 2001 said.\nThe material can be viewed in the National Archives in file 2023/53/29",

    "title": "LA Archbishop Leads Interreligious Memorial Service for the City’s Homeless",
    "text": "CV NEWS FEED // Archbishop José Gomez led an interreligious memorial service for the deceased homeless persons in the city of Los Angeles, California last week, where he implored for the attendees “to see everyone as a child of God.” The second annual Homeless Persons’ Interreligious Memorial took place at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels on December 21. [According](https://angelusnews.com/local/la-catholics/2023-cathedral-homeless/) to news outlet Angelus News, near the “altar were 1,665 battery-charged candles, bearing the names of each of the people identified by the LA County coroner’s office as having died on the streets from December 2022 through Nov. 3 of this year.” Attendees were encouraged to take a candle home after the service and pray for the person whose name was on the candle. Religious leaders from the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, Orthodox, Bahá’í, Hindu, Jewish, and Mormon faith traditions spoke at the memorial and lit candles to honor the homeless who had died. The memorial prayer service, Gomez said, was a call “to reach across the boundaries that separate us from our neighbors, to recognize in each person the spark of the divine, to see everyone as a child of God.” “We need to bear one another’s burdens,” Gomez said. “We need to lift up our neighbors when they’ve fallen, bind their wounds, and find them a place to live. When one of us is suffering, we all suffer.” After the parable of the Good Samaritan from the Gospel was proclaimed at the service, Gomez said, “Jesus asks us tonight to see with ‘new eyes.’ He asks us to look at the ‘other’ and see a brother or a sister. Whatever the color of their skin, whatever their nationality, their language, or religion. Whatever their condition or their worldly status.” More than 200 people attended the memorial, and were also encouraged after the service to donate sleeping bags, blankets, and other items. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul Society and [SOFESA](https://www.sofesa.org/), an LA nonprofit organization that cares for the homeless and low-income helped organize the vigil. Before the memorial, the Los Angeles Archdiocesan Council of Catholic Women also held a community donation drive called “Hearts & Hats” that collected scarves and hats for the homeless. Council member Karen Akana told Angelus News, “It’s just remarkable that we have that many people on the streets who have passed away. It’s hard to believe that even tonight somebody is probably dying because it’s so cold outside. So we came down to pray for them.” Angelus News noted that in 2022 Los Angeles had an [estimated](https://www.foxla.com/news/los-angeles-homeless-count-2023) homeless population of 41,980, “making it the city with the largest homeless population in the country that year (that number grew to 46,260 this year). The number of homeless deaths in LA counted for this year’s memorial was over 200 more than the same time period in 2022.”",

    "text": "Meghalaya’s Sporting Odyssey in 2023 By Our Reporter As the curtain falls on the sporting spectacle that was 2023, Meghalaya can look back at a rollercoaster of athletic achievements, heartbreaks, and a few wall-tumbling incidents – all delivered in the unique flavor that only our beloved state can provide. Let’s take a leisurely stroll down the memory lane of Meghalaya’s sporting escapades, shall we? January Jamboree: Kishan Lyngdoh’s Century and Football’s Farewell The year kicked off with Kishan Lyngdoh announcing his arrival on the cricketing scene with a resounding maiden first-class hundred. In the football fraternity, Meghalaya bid farewell to Aibok Kharpran, a stalwart associated with Shillong Lajong FC. The echoes of his contributions resonated in the hills. February’s Fables: Santosh Trophy Soiree and MMA Marvels Meghalaya etched its name in football history by reaching the Santosh Trophy semifinals for the first time, showcasing resilience and skill. Meanwhile, in the world of mixed martial arts, Raymond Johnny Kurbah donned the black belt with pride and became the first Khasi MMA fighter to be signed by a US-based agency, bringing a dash of international flair to our local talent pool. Marching into March: Meghalaya’s Football Prodigy’s Mancunian Sojourn Young Federick Kupar Kurbah, the footballing prodigy, lived every footballer’s dream with an exposure tour to the hallowed grounds of Manchester United, adding a touch of glamour to Meghalaya’s sporting narrative. April’s Awe: Jaden Pariat’s Podium Glory Jaden Pariat, the racing sensation from Meghalaya, made headlines by standing on the British F4 podium, marking a historic moment and securing a proud spot in the international racing circuit. May Magic: Lajong’s I-League Return and Bhutia’s Footballing Haven Shillong Lajong FC made a triumphant return to the I-League, stirring emotions and reaffirming their place in Indian football. Simultaneously, the legendary Baichung Bhutia added a feather to Meghalaya’s cap by launching the first residential football academy in the Northeast, elevating the footballing dreams of aspiring youngsters. June Jolts: The Wall’s Tumble and a Sporting Luminary’s Farewell June brought a mixture of embarrassment and sorrow as the retaining wall at the new PA Sangma Stadium in Tura decided to take a tumble, creating a moment that’ll be etched in our collective memories. The month also saw the passing of Chiranjib Choudhury, a sports administrator par excellence. July Jubilations: Elite Programs and Young Football Hopefuls The Super Elite Programme for athlete development took flight, promising to nurture Meghalaya’s brightest talents with international coaches. Young footballers Damaitphang Lyngdoh and Helen Nongtdu found themselves in the spotlight, making it to the 50-men probable list for the India U-23 football squad. August’s Acceleration: Jaden Pariat’s Ferrari Dreams Jaden R Pariat, the rising star of motorsport, earned an invitation to the prestigious Ferrari Driver Academy selection trials, showcasing the caliber that Meghalaya is producing on the global stage. September’s Snag: SSA Vice-President’s Departure The sporting fraternity mourned the loss of Dibus Marbaniang, a senior Vice-President in the Shillong Sports Association, leaving behind a legacy of dedication and service. October’s Ovation: Golf Glory and MFA Leadership Change October witnessed Johnwell G Momin qualifying to represent Meghalaya in golf at the National Games 2023, a moment of pride for the Tura Golfers Association. Meanwhile, Hamlet Dohling assumed the presidency, and Sunesh Syiem took over as the General Secretary of the Meghalaya Football Association. November’s Nexus: I-League’s Homecoming and National Games Ordeal Shillong Lajong FC brought the I-League back to Meghalaya, playing their first home game with enthusiasm at the SSA Stadium. However, the joy was tempered as Meghalaya returned empty-handed from the 37th National Games in Goa, the lone state without a medal. December’s Delight: Pohkseh SC Triumph The sporting year culminated with Pohkseh SC claiming the Shillong Sports Association’s Second Division title, adding a touch of local fervor to the December air. As the sun sets on 2023, Meghalaya’s sports enthusiasts can look back with a mix of pride, nostalgia, and a readiness for the next chapter in our sporting saga. Here’s to another year of triumphs, challenges, and the undying spirit of Meghalaya in the world of sports. Cheers!",

    "text": "Economía La firma Moody’s abre la puerta a una posible rebaja de calificación para Colombia al cambiar la perspectiva de su nota crediticia de estable a negativa La noticia se conoció en la tarde de este jueves 27 de junio de 2024. [Por: Redacción El País](/autor/redaccion-el-pais/) La firma Moody’s mantiene la calificación de Colombia en Baa2 en grado de inversión, pero determinó rebajar la perspectiva de estable a negativa. Lo anterior se da debido a las condiciones macroeconómicas retadoras que enfrenta el país que pueden impactar la consolidación fiscal, la tendencia de crecimiento, y el costo de endeudamiento, las cuales están asociadas con un débil crecimiento económico, un incremento sostenido en el costo de endeudamiento del país que podría deteriorar el manejo fiscal y el perfil crediticio del país hacia adelante. Por otro lado, esta calificadora de riesgo resalta como aspecto positivo la institucionalidad del país, que se traduce en el correcto funcionamiento de pesos y contrapesos. Asimismo, destaca que el Banco de la República sigue haciendo un manejo de la política monetaria de manera independiente. Sobre el Gobierno Nacional, Moody’s sostiene que este ha tenido la capacidad de demostrar para hacer recortes en el gasto con el fin de cumplir la regla fiscal, y mantener bajo control los niveles de deuda, en línea con sus pares. Para los expertos de la firma, el cambio en la perspectiva es el reflejo de complicaciones en la gestión fiscal por un crecimiento económico menor al esperado, el cual está afectando negativamente los ingresos tributarios, a lo que se suman mayores costos de endeudamiento, lo que en conjunto genera una presión adicional sobre las cuentas del Gobierno Nacional. “Estos factores están obstaculizando la capacidad actual y futura de las autoridades para cumplir la regla fiscal, al tiempo que aumentan el riesgo de un posible deterioro en el perfil crediticio de Colombia”, asegura un informe de Moody’s al respecto. En la parte del crecimiento, la firma considera que el aumento del ruido político y algunas decisiones políticas del Estado han contribuido a un sentimiento negativo entre los inversionistas. “La formación bruta de capital fijo disminuyó un 9,5 % y representó el 17,3 % del PIB en 2023, por debajo del promedio del 21,1 % durante 2013-2022. Aunque la actividad económica está mejorando en 2024, la persistente debilidad en la dinámica de inversión pesaría sobre una recuperación sostenida de las perspectivas de crecimiento a mediano plazo de Colombia, volviendo al crecimiento tendencial de alrededor del 3 %, y restringiría la capacidad de las autoridades para lograr una consolidación fiscal continua en 2025-2026″, precisan en el documento. Ante esto, el ministro de Hacienda, Ricardo Bonilla, se pronunció asegurando que “la calificadora de riesgo ha puesto un voto de confianza en el país, destacando las decisiones contundentes de recorte de gasto con el fin de mantener la sostenibilidad fiscal y macroeconómica que ha tomado el Gobierno del presidente Petro”.

Each initiative, especially our ReBubble and Wings Coin projects, show our deep commitment to the planet and prove that we are on the right path to a greener tomorrow.”SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES, July 5, 2024 / — Managing Director, Georg Plesser [EINPresswire.com](https://www.einpresswire.com/)/ -- The Excelsior Hotel Ernst in Cologne was recently recertified by [Green Globe](https://www.greenglobe.com/)for the third year. For over 160 years, the Excelsior Hotel Ernst has been welcoming guests through its doors right opposite Cologne Cathedral, in the heart of Cologne’s Old Town. Family owned since 1863, the hotel has ensured that it keeps pace with the latest sustainable luxury practices. Managing Director, Georg Plesser, expressed his pride and optimism saying, “In securing Green Globe certification once more, we're not just honored, we're energized! Each initiative, especially our ReBubble and Wings Coin projects, show our deep commitment to the planet and prove that we are on the right path to a greener tomorrow.” Among Excelsior Hotel Ernst’s sustainability achievements from the past year, two projects stand out, reflecting the hotel’s efforts toward making a positive impact on the planet. Firstly, the ReBubble – the social soap initiative continues to make significant strides. Each year, all soap remnants are collected which are then processed and sold anew. This innovative project not only reduces waste but also contributes to the circular economy, showcasing the hotel’s commitment to sustainability in every aspect of its operations. Furthermore, ReBubble works with the Aachen Lebenshilfe workshop that provides employment opportunities for people with disabilities thereby imbuing the soap with a special emotional value as well. Secondly, a collaboration with Wings Coin has introduced a transformative approach to housekeeping operations. Since 2023, guests have had the option to forgo room cleaning, supporting Excelsior Hotel Ernst’s sustainability strategy. Through this partnership, a total of 460 opt-outs were recorded last year alone. Significant resource savings were made through this initiative including more than 346 kW/h in electricity consumption, water savings of 22.5 liters, 728 kg in CO2, over 1762 kg in bed linen, towels and cleaning cloths, and 50 liters of cleaning supplies. The eco-conscious program also empowers guests to participate in environmental efforts at the hotel. The non-profit organization Project Wings receives support for each cancelled room cleaning service. The organization’s environmental protection projects include the world’s largest recycling village in Indonesia, implementation of waste management systems, species protection and nature conservation. “Both projects are spearheaded by a dedicated Green Team, demonstrating a collective commitment to our sustainable future. The Green Globe recognition fuels our motivation to continue our green journey!” said Mr Plesser.
