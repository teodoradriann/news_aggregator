    "text": "Gaming Avowed devs address key multiplayer co-op feature removal Jessica Filby ❘ Published: 2024-11-15T12:25:02 Obsidian Avowed is finally on its way, but it won’t have multiplayer, despite it being a highlighted feature during the game’s early development.\nIt’s no secret that multiplayer games are the current trend in modern video games. Whether it’s the new Black Ops 6, Baldur’s Gate 3, Helldivers 2, or even Warhammer Space Marine 2 , we’ve seen tons of incredibly successful multiplayer adventures released over the last few years.\nSo, with Obsidians highly anticipated Avowed finally getting a release date, one feature has been revealed to be missing; Multiplayer. Thankfully, the developers have spoken out and explained their decision.\nArticle continues after ad Why is Avowed not multiplayer? During Obsidian’s 20th Anniversary documentary , the developers explained why they chose to remove the feature and make it a solely single-player venture.\n“It was a more interesting game to publishers” explained the devs during the documentary, adding that promising “multiplayer made it interesting” towards the people investing.\nHowever, as they went on, they found they “were too focused on Co-op and we were too focused on changing the way our pipelines work and the way that we write conversations and the way we do quests and everything else,” forcing some drastic change.\nArticle continues after ad Article continues after ad Clip starts at 18:30 “After working on it for a little bit we realized that we weren’t focused on the things that we’re best at and so we did make a pivot on the game to refocus and make sure that it was at the end of the day an Obsidian game” explained the developers.\nThe choice to make a purely single-player game and slide away from the previously promised multiplayer is undeniably a good one. As the devs mentioned, it gives them the chance to focus on what they’re good at, which is touching stories, somewhat ridiculous adventures, and unforgettable games like Pillars of Eternity.\nRelated: Baldur’s Gate 3 players cry out for major feature Article continues after ad So, while the game won’t have a multiplayer option, you may be wondering whether you can romance your companions, unlike Outer Worlds which focuses on companion relationships with NPCs rather than the player.

It said its technicians were racing to restore power.\nThe heat index, which takes humidity into account, climbed to 42 Celsius (107.6 Fahrenheit) on Wednesday.\nMunicipal authorities reported that the outage suspended subway service on all lines in both directions and darkened 50 stoplights, causing chaos in central and southern Buenos Aires that forced the deployment of hundreds of traffic cops.\nLater Wednesday afternoon, service resumed on all but two train lines, the capital’s subway franchisee said. Officers rescued people temporarily trapped in elevators. Pedestrians were left broiling on sidewalks downtown, unable to cross the traffic-snarled main thoroughfare of Avenida 9 de Julio.\nBlackouts are relatively common in Argentina, especially in periods of peak demand, such as the height of the hot summer months in the Southern Hemisphere.\nYears of effectively frozen prices for electricity under previous left-leaning administrations had led to a lack of investment in the electricity sector.\nBut utility rates have surged under libertarian President Javier Milei, who has also courted foreign investors to bankroll big energy infrastructure projects.",

    "text": "Cologne police acting on indications of a possible attack searched Germany’s landmark cathedral with sniffer dogs on Saturday and said worshippers attending Christmas Eve Mass would undergo security screening before being allowed in. In Austria, police in Vienna also said they were taking heightened security measures around churches and Christmas markets, deploying both uniformed and plainclothes officers. Neither police agency specified the threat, but the German news agency dpa said authorities were responding to signs of a possible attack by Islamic extremists, without citing a specific source. Michael Esser, head of the criminal investigation department of the Cologne police, said in a news release that the threat indications pointed to New Year’s Eve rather than Christmas, but added that “we are putting everything possible in motion for the security of cathedral visitors on Christmas Eve”. Cologne’s towering cathedral, whose twin spires are 157 metres (515 feet) tall, is a major tourist destination visited by some six million people a year. Police and cathedral officials urged those attending Mass on Sunday evening to arrive early and not bring bags or purses. The European Union’s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, warned on December 5 that Europe faces a “huge risk of terrorist attacks” over the Christmas holidays due to fall-out from the war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.",

    "text": "[Minor Díaz se sentía frustrado](https://www.nacion.com/puro-deporte/futbol-nacional/liberia-vs-alajuelense-en-vivo-todo-lo-que-debe/JBNZMJB2YNHXFDPWOB4AS37IEM/story/) al finalizar el partido entre el Municipal Liberia y la Liga Deportiva Alajuelense. Lo ocurrido en ese encuentro le provocó una gran molestia, un colerón que le resulta difícil de digerir. El motivo de su descontento radica en que, a pesar de que su equipo jugó muy bien, la Liga se llevó los tres puntos con un triunfo de 2-1 a domicilio, en el Estadio Edgardo Baltodano. Al efectuar un análisis amplio del juego, Minor Díaz reconoce que a los pamperos les faltó profundidad, pero que tenían el partido controlado en el segundo tiempo y que marearon a Alajuelense, pero fue insuficiente. Apenas entró al camerino, lo primero que el técnico les dijo a sus jugadores fue que no quiere que se acomoden, porque hay una exigencia: ganar.

Yo quiero que mi equipo gane y que le gane a estos rivales. Así de sencillo, yo no engaño a nadie, ni vendo humo. La exigencia para este equipo en este semestre es buscar la clasificación”, recalcó. Añadió que la zona de confort nunca le ha gustado y, sin necesidad de una bola de cristal, les adelantó a sus futbolistas que la primera pregunta en la rueda de prensa sería sobre el hecho de que fueron superiores a Alajuelense en el segundo tiempo, pero perdieron. “Ya estoy cansado de eso, ya no estoy para eso. Creo que la etapa del ascenso ya pasó. Aquí debe haber otra exigencia: ganar a estos rivales”. El ideal para él, y para cualquier entrenador, sería jugar bien y ganar, pero entre ambas cosas, él prefiere ganar.

Ya hay que ganar. Tenemos un equipo para pelear por la clasificación y si no le ganamos a estos rivales, creo que no tiene sentido. Tiene que haber exigencia y eso es lo que me molesta. Hoy, entre jugar bien y ganar, prefiero ganar”, enfatizó Minor Díaz. Para él, ya es hora de que se acabe la misma alaraca sobre el buen juego del Municipal Liberia. No quiere conformismo, porque para crecer como técnico, también tiene que exigir a sus jugadores más allá de hacer un gran partido contra la Liga. “Yo no vendo humo, sé cuál es el camino que quiero seguir y, disculpen, pero en mi fútbol lo que cuenta es ganar. Lo demás no sirve”.

Esto también le molestó, ya que en el primer tiempo la Liga apenas realizó dos remates a puerta. “No concretamos, y Adrián Garza falló una acción muy clara, similar a la que tuvo Alajuelense. Créame que trabajé mucho en la pretemporada, especialmente en definición. Me molesta y la responsabilidad es mía”. También mencionó que si los nuevos jugadores del Municipal Liberia pensaban que estarían de vacaciones en el club, se equivocaron, ya que deben buscar la clasificación. “Exijo porque yo trabajo, mi cuerpo técnico trabaja y uno quiere trascender en el fútbol, abrirse espacio como entrenador y la única forma de hacerlo es trabajando. Esto es duro, porque fue un monólogo de lo que fue el semestre pasado”, concluyó Minor Díaz.
