    "text": "The protection status S for refugees from Ukraine came into force in spring 2022.\nKeystone / Michael Buholzer\nSince the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, Switzerland has accelerated the processing of requests for protection from Ukrainian refugees. However, it is now rejecting more applications than ever before.\nThis content was published on\n15. August 2024 – 08:23\nLast November, refugees from Ukraine were able to breathe a sigh of relief in Switzerland, when the government extended the special protection until March 2025 External link which has existed since March 2022.\nThe “Protection Status S” allows them to live, work and receive social assistance in Switzerland. This special status also means that they do not have to go through the normal asylum procedure, but are recognized as refugees in a fast-track procedure.\nThis applies provided that they were already living in Ukraine before the start of the war on February 24, 2022 and entered Switzerland.\nOn July 31, the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) tweeted that 66,182 Ukrainians currently hold a valid Status S. However, the post also revealed that 26,392 Status S permits have been revoked since they were first issued in March 2022.\nThe government has the right to revoke the S permit if holders move their residence to a third country and obtain legal residency there.\nIn addition, the permit can be revoked if a person stays in Ukraine for more than 15 days per quarter. Exempt from this rule are those who can prove that they are preparing for a permanent return to Ukraine.\nFrom the Statistics from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees External link (UNHCR) shows that on 4 July, only 63.1% of all Ukrainians who applied for asylum or temporary protection in Switzerland were registered in Switzerland.\nIncrease in rejection rate In addition to withdrawing the S permit, the migration authorities can also reject applications for protection from Ukrainians. Since the war began in February 2022, the SEM has so far refused S protection status to around 2,500 people from Ukraine. The rejection rate is increasing.\nSEM spokesman Daniel Bach told the Swiss-French television station RTS that many Ukrainians no longer come to Switzerland directly from Ukraine, but from other European countries.\nThis is one of the main reasons why they do not meet the criteria for an S permit. Why do Ukrainians from safe European countries try their luck in Switzerland?\n“It is possible that people who have already received protection in another country apply for asylum in Switzerland for various reasons. For example, because family members live here,” Lionel Walter, media spokesperson for the Swiss Refugee Council (SFH), writes by email.\n“The SEM then clarifies this and, depending on the case, refers to this existing protection. This is not unusual and also occurs in procedures in other countries of origin. From our point of view, it is important that people have access to protection in a country that respects their fundamental rights,” Walter continued.\nAccording to the SFH, Switzerland is not a more popular destination country than the rest of Europe because the protection status is similar. However, their research also shows that the choice of destination country is not only determined by the legal framework, but also by cultural proximity, language, communities and the presence of relatives.\nMore\nMore\nHow two years of war in Ukraine have shaped Swiss politics\nThis content was published on\n23. Feb. 2024\nNeutral Switzerland was also affected by the war in Ukraine. How has the country changed two years after the Russian attack?\nMore How two years of war in Ukraine have shaped Swiss politics\n“The reason is simple and brutal: the war in Ukraine continues and the situation is not better than it was a year ago, but probably worse,” Sasha Volkov, board member and spokesman for the Ukrainian Association of Switzerland, told SWI swissinfo.ch.\nVolkov was recently in Ukraine and lived with his family near Kiev for two weeks. The electricity supply is irregular, with power outages in the capital region lasting six hours and then electricity for three hours, he reports.\n“People considering returning to Ukraine are finding that they need generators if they want to return to their homes, and that running them is more expensive than electricity in Switzerland,” he says.\n“They have no money to return to Ukraine and are hesitant to stay where they are because solidarity with the Ukrainian people is no longer as great as it was at the beginning of the war.”\nIntegration and return plans The Swiss government has recognized that Ukrainians will not return to their homeland in the foreseeable future.\nIn November last year, it set itself the ambitious goal of integrating 40% of the people living here into the world of work by the end of 2024. The current figure is 25%.\nFor this purpose, 3,000 francs per person have been made available, which will be used primarily for language courses.\nA proposal by Parliament to introduce online registration instead of work permits, if adopted, is also expected to reduce the bureaucratic burden for companies wanting to hire Ukrainians.\nMore\nMore\nEscape or front: Ukrainian men in the sights of Swiss politics\nThis content was published on\n14. Jun. 2024\nThe Ukrainian army needs men. The right-wing party in Switzerland is raising the question of whether male refugees from Ukraine should be sent back.\nMore escape or front: Ukrainian men in the sights of Swiss politics\nHowever, a shadow of uncertainty continues to hang over Ukrainian refugees, as the S status, which is provisionally valid until March 2025, was never intended for a long-term stay in Switzerland.\nLast September, the Swiss government announced its preliminary strategy to facilitate the return of Ukrainian refugees following the abolition of S status.\nIt is estimated that 80% of the refugees would leave voluntarily because their male family members are in Ukraine.\nThe report recommends giving refugees six to nine months to plan their departure.\nTo this end, he proposes a financial incentive of 1,000 to 4,000 francs per person, with those who leave earlier receiving more money.\nA return becomes less likely for some However, the longer the stay in Switzerland, the less likely it is that a person will be willing to leave Switzerland voluntarily.\nIn addition, after five years of continuous residence, they could receive a Swiss B permit, which is valid for five years.\nA report published in December Survey by UNHCR, SEM and market research institute Ipsos External link suggests that a voluntary return of Ukrainian refugees will not be easy.\nA third of the Ukrainian refugees surveyed do not want to return to their homeland, 40% said they were undecided.\n“Some are giving up on Ukraine. This is inevitable the longer the war lasts,” says Volkov of the Ukrainian Association of Switzerland.\nEdited by Mark Livingston, Translation from English: Christian Raaflaub\nMore\nMore\nNewsletter\nSign up for our newsletter and receive the top stories from swissinfo.ch directly in your mailbox.\nMore Newsletters\nArticles in this story\nRead more\nFurther\nBack\nMore\nWhy Swiss trams are popular in Ukraine\nThis content was published on\n15.

    "text": "Hesperia Unified School District in San Bernardino County, California today notified an undisclosed number of people about a May 2024 data breach that compromised names, Social Security numbers, and driver’s license numbers.\nRansomware group LockBit claimed responsibility for the attack and gave the school district until June 3, 2024 to pay an undisclosed sum of money.\nThe schools’ notification ( PDF ) specifically states employee information might have been accessed by an unauthorized party, so student data might not be impacted. In addition to the data mentioned above, some files contained health insurance and medical information.\nWe don’t yet know how many people are affected by the breach, whether the school district has paid or will pay the ransom, which systems were affected, or how attackers breached the district’s network.\nComparitech contacted Hesperia Unified School District for comment and will update this article if it responds.\nWe recommend victims take advantage of the free credit monitoring and ID theft protection offered by the school district via Experian. Monitor your credit report, bank statements, and medical bills for signs of fraud.\nWho is LockBit? LockBit is one of the most prolific ransomware gangs of recent years after first appearing in 2019. The group is most likely based in Russia.\nLockBit often extorts victims twice: once for a decryption key to restore systems that its malware has encrypted, and again in exchange for not selling or publicly releasing stolen data.\nComparitech has logged 45 confirmed attacks claimed by LockBit so far this year, affecting 165,367 records. 11 of those attacks were against the education sector, six of which occurred in the United States:\nClackamas Community College Groton Public Schools Central School District 13J Township of Union Public Schools Ewing Marion Kauffman School Hesperia Unified School District LockBit has claimed a further 360 unconfirmed attacks this year, 21 of which are on the education sector.\nIn 2023, LockBit was also responsible for attacks on White Settlement Independent School District, Olympia Community Unit School District 16, University of Health Sciences and Pharmacy, Hillsborough County Public Schools, Fauquier County Public Schools, Río Hondo College, William Jewell College, Greensboro College, Atlanta Technical College, and Virginia Union University.\nRansomware attacks on US education In addition to data theft, ransomware attacks can lock up critical computer systems and networks, forcing schools to resort to pen and paper, and in some cases even cancel classes until systems are restored.\nComparitech has logged 20 confirmed ransomware attacks on US schools and colleges so far in 2024, affecting 24,054 records. In 2023, we recorded 109 such attacks, affecting 2,014,576 records.\nAbout Hesperia Unified School District Formed in 1987, the San Bernardino County school district consists of three high schools, three middle schools, 12 middle schools, five charter schools, two continuation schools, three choice schools, two alternative schools, and one adult education school. It has about 22,000 students and 1,150 staff, according to external sources.",
