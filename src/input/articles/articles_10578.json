    "title": "Forum Post: RE: Glioma with Enhancement - husband diagnosed",
    "text": "My husband has recently been diagnosed with a glioma with enhancement - he is 34 we have a coming up 2 year old little boy. My husband is not wanting to know timelines at the moment but myself and parents have looked and discussed.\nIt just seems a nightmare, it started with metallic taste every 6-8 weeks, then had episodes just very minor 5s not thinking anything of it every few weeks, 3 virtual doctor appointments saying migraines.\nLed to more regular and more serious until a car accident, luckily minor no-one hurt, they put it to epilepsy. Saw neurology recommended MRI eventually after calling got one and we got the above news.\nIt is located between two lobes affecting speech and movement.\nNow NeuroScience awaiting assessments, they plan to operate in the next month.\nAbsolutely terrified of what is to come.\nHi,\nThank you, it always feels like you just want to know a but more.\nThe hospital have been great and yesterday's appointments went well. He had a seizure there today but was his mildest one yet in comparison to Sunday so hopefully tablets may be starting to do something.\nThey currently are not allowing any visitors, just hope it's not too bad and he doesn't want to know too much.\nHis job have asked him to put his resignation in. Glad to hear macmillan have been helpful and the hospital recommende Brian yesterday. We've found out macmillan have a centre at our local hospital as well as where he has his op.\nJust got to hope Monday goes ahead now.\nSending you love and support in your journey.\nThank you\nI'm in a similar situation to your daughter. I've got oligodendroglioma grade 2/3 diagnosed last summer, had the op, had 6 weeks radiotherapy, and started my first PCV chemo cycle last week. I hope your daughter copes well with the treatment. It's a rollercoaster ride we didn't ask for!\nThanks for making contact SmallSteps. My daughter is 41, married with a son of 7, she's a teacher but she can't see herself going back to teaching as it's so stressful these days. All this came out of the blue as her GP put the headaches and low concentration down to mild epilepsy...plus a car accident and luckily no one was hurt, which lead to more tests.\nShe is grieving for the life she had planned and hoped she'd have and all her family are being as supportive as we can without being in her face all the time plus keeping a normal routine for her son. She is the 1 who has to go through the treatment while I feel powerless. She's only a week into chemo and will be on it till August and we have enough info about what's going to happen to her general health....she lost most of her hair through radiotherapy and is coming to terms with that...most days anyway.\nHow are you doing with your treatment so far?\nTake care.\nJust to let everyone know, they have only removed so much it is a grade 2 glioma, the area of enhancement and what is left they do not know an exact grade or how much is left until the next scan.\nThey are not doing any further treatment for now, they want to see how he goes. We are in limbo, he keeps feeling sick, is tired a lot, sick of doing PIP application and ESA forms.\nThe consultant is trying to say take time and try to do normal activities like bits of exercise if you can but not to work obviously. Just feel like a massive rollercoaster, never getting off, no proper answers. The more we read the letter its all just coming across like a waiting game, await scan and everything may change all over again.\nOh Manorview08, hang in there. Listen to the consultant's advice. Take this slowly...one step at a time. Its a huge amount to take in and cope with.\nWe've been living scan to scan for almost 18 months and I'd love to say it gets easier but its a rollercoaster ride. This is also a huge exercise in patience both with yourself and your husband.\nPlease remember that you can also reach to Macmillan Support Services on 0808 808 00 00 - most services are open 8am to 8pm, 7 days a week\nClicking here to see what is available. This service provides lots of cancer information, emotional support, benefit and financial guidance or just a listening ear.

Stay positive\nlove n hugs\nWee Me xx\nMacmillan Support Line - 0808 808 00 00, 7 days a week between 8am-8pm\nThank you for sharing your story! Similar to mine, im a nurse and cant se myself being able to go back to work if im just waiting about. Appt keep being pushed back too. A good thing I know but also very frustrating. I didn't meet the criteria for ESA so hoping my PIPs is accepted.

    "text": "LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) -\nChina-owned British Steel said it could close its two blast furnaces as soon as June with the potential loss of up to 2,700 jobs, as U.S. tariffs and environmental costs threaten to damage its already struggling operations.\nBritish Steel, owned by China's Jingye Group, has warned for years that steel-making in Scunthorpe, north east England, is loss making, and said on Thursday that it would consult over the closure of its blast furnaces and other related operations.\n\"The blast furnaces and steelmaking operations are no longer financially sustainable due to highly challenging market conditions, the imposition of tariffs, and higher environmental costs relating to the production of high-carbon steel,\" British Steel said in a statement on Thursday.\nU.S. President Donald Trump imposed\nglobal tariffs\nof 25% on all imports of steel on March 12, dealing another blow to British Steel, which said its Scunthorpe operations are losing 700,000 pounds daily.\nBritain's steel exports to the United States are worth over 400 million pounds a year, or about 5% of UK steel exports, according to industry body UK Steel.\nBritish Steel, which has been making steel since 1890, said it was beginning consultations with unions and the proposed closures could impact between 2,000 and 2,700 jobs - subject to consultations - with June the earliest possible date for closure.\nThe company has been in talks with the government for months over a funding package to help it replace the blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces, a greener type of steel production, but the two sides have not reached an agreement.\n\"We made an offer to British Steel on Monday and they have rejected that offer. We are still in talks with them at the moment,\" Sarah Jones a minister in the Department for Business and Trade said on Wednesday.\nBritish Steel said it would continue working with the government to explore options for the business.\n(Reporting by Sarah Young in London and Anandita Mehrotra in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Kate Holton)\nThis article is reserved for members Unlock the article: REGISTER NOW! 100% Free Registration Already a customer?

    "text": "[Warhammer 40,000 : Space Marine 2](/jeux/warhammer-space-marine-2-3050884837.html)Action 9 septembre 2024 Franchise :\n[Warhammer 40.000](/jeux/warhammer-40-000/franchise.html)\n- PC\n- Xbox X|S\n- PS5\nVictime de son succès, [Warhammer 40,000 : Space Marine 2](/jeux/warhammer-space-marine-2-3050884837.html) jouit déjà d'une petite communauté modding qui est officiellement soutenue (en esprit) par les développeurs de [Saber Interactive](/societe/saber-interactive-5308.html). Mais face à l'avalanche de mods conflictuels en coopération, le studio active les freins d'urgence.\nLe réalisateur Dmitriy Grigorenko a pris la parole [sur Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/6681747476222836957?l=english) pour expliquer qu'à partir d'aujourd'hui, si Saber Interactive encourage toujours les artisans du pixel à publier des mods, ces add-ons officieux seront interdits en ligne. « Nos données montrent qu'une quantité non-négligible d'instabilité des serveurs ces derniers jours est liée aux mods, et cette instabilité impacte même les joueurs qui n'ont pas de mods installés. Nous avons aussi reçu des signalements de joueurs qui montrent que leurs fichiers de sauvegarde ont été corrompus après avoir joué avec d'autres personnes utilisant des mods. »\nBourrins sensibles\nComme la cigarette qui est interdite dans les restaurants pour limiter le tabagisme passif, Warhammer 40,000 : Space Marine 2 va donc appliquer un cordon sanitaire sur les mods pour vous empêcher de blesser accidentellement vos camarades de jeu. Cependant, deux exceptions resteront : votre partie hors-ligne, bien évidemment, ainsi que vos parties privées entre copains. Si vous détruisez le fichier de sauvegarde d'un ami, vous pourrez vous expliquer avec lui sur le parvis de Gare du Nord, à l'arme blanche, comme font tous les gens normaux.\nQuant à l'avenir, Saber Interactive promet de nouvelles fonctionnalités pour ouvertement soutenir le modding sur Warhammer 40,000 : Space Marine 2. « Nous voulions concevoir un jeu moddable dès le début (c'est notamment pour ça que nos fichiers ne sont pas chiffrés). En tant que développeur, c'est toujours un plaisir de voir la créativité de notre communauté. [...] Nous allons fournir un point d'accès à notre back-end pour que les moddeurs évitent de passer leur temps sur des correctifs après chaque patch. Si, par accident, nous brisons ce pipeline dédié aux mods, nous le réparerons. De plus, nous allons publier certains outils internes pour faciliter le travail des moddeurs. »\nWarhammer 40,000 : Space Marine 2 déploiera son embargo anti-mods courant décembre. Dmitriy Grigorenko n'a pas précisé quand arriveraient les outils de modding.",

    "text": "[Donate to the Israeli-Palestinian Crisis Appeal](?form=israelipalestiniancrisis) The terrible situation in Gaza is tearing lives apart. Your donation today will help with the practical support to help where possible. 2023 has not been without its challenges – from conflicts new and ongoing, to droughts and floods, and a cost-of-living crisis felt both here in the UK and the world over. Over these past 12 months we have been buoyed by our incredible supporters, who have donated to our humanitarian appeals, spoken out about injustice to MPs, joined us in prayer and fundraised in their schools, churches and communities. Thank you to everyone who has stood by us to help those most in need across the world. Here are some moments from 2023. The Turkey and Syria earthquake killed over 50,000 people and left millions without homes. CAFOD joined the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) to [launch a major appeal](/give/donate-to-emergencies/turkey-syria-earthquake-appeal), and once again our supporters showed their enormous generosity. Our local partners were able to provide emergency shelter, food, warm blankets and winter kits. We are still there, supporting affected families. In February [CAFOD staff and partners were thrilled to welcome Pope Francis](/news/international-news/reaching-communities-in-drc) on his long-anticipated visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan. He met people forced to flee their homes to escape violence and prayed for peace and an end to division. In the spring people tied up their laces for our Big Lent Walk which saw thousands of people, including 650 schools, support CAFOD’s work by walking, donating and praying. Next year’s event is due to be even bigger, as we join our sister agency in Scotland, SCIAF, to encourage people to walk 200km over the 40 days of Lent. In the last academic year (2022-2023), Catholic schools in England and Wales raised an amazing £610,000 for CAFOD. Thirty-seven more schools achieved the [LiveSimply Award](/campaign/livesimply-award/livesimply-award-for-schools) – an initiative which sees schools committing to live simply, sustainably and in solidarity with the world’s poorest. [Jenny Garzón Saavedra](/education/laudato-si-for-schools/jenny-in-colombia), youth worker for our church partner FUNVIPAS in the Colombian Amazon, spoke to 8,000 young Catholics at Wembley Arena in March for Flame – the National Youth Congress. Droughts and flooding in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan have destroyed farmland, killed livestock and forced millions from their homes. Thanks to our supporters we have helped communities with urgent supplies of food, water, and seeds resilient against climate change, and we will continue to respond for as long as we are needed. Coastal regions that are home to millions of people have already been irreversibly damaged by climate change, including from rising sea levels and salination of water. Following floods in Pakistan, we supported mobile health clinics that travelled hundreds of miles to treat people in need of medical help. Generous donations to our [Harvest Appeal](/give/appeals/harvest-appeal) will allow us to reach even more people affected by the climate crisis in 2024. In October [we delivered ‘Salina’s letter’ to the World Bank’s UK offices](/news/campaigning-news/salina-s-letter-delivered-to-world-bank). Salina is a small-holder farmer from Bangladesh who is fighting to keep control of her own seeds. Part of CAFOD’s ongoing [Fix the Food System](/campaign/fix-the-food-system) campaign, the letter was signed by 18 Catholic Bishops and over 70,000 Catholics from 750 parishes across England and Wales. The [publication of Pope Francis’ Laudate Deum](/pray/laudate-deum-explained) was a rallying cry to phase out fossil fuels and to care for our common home. More than 3,000 CAFOD campaigners joined Pope Francis, writing to MPs, joining climate marches and signing petitions urging Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to stick to the UK’s climate commitments. At COP28, for the first time [international governments pledged to phase down fossil fuels](/news/campaigning-news/cop28-un-climate-talks-end-with-agreement-to-transition-away-from-fossil-fuels) and establish a loss and damage fund to help vulnerable communities adapt to the impacts of climate change. In 2024 we will continue to advocate for a cleaner, more just world. CAFOD is working with our local partners to support those in the hardest-hit frontline areas of the east and south this winter. Their experienced local staff are providing families and individuals in crisis with emergency accommodation, food, water, basic home repairs and medical assistance, alongside mental health support and employment counselling. 2023 will no doubt be remembered for the terrible death and destruction over the last few months in Gaza and Israel, and what can appear to be the end of hopes for peace in the region. But as we join calls for an urgent and permanent ceasefire, we pray that our local partners will soon be able to restart their programmes - from delivering life-saving medical outreach services for vulnerable communities in Gaza, to working tirelessly for peace and a political solution to the crisis. The terrible situation in Gaza is tearing lives apart. Your donation today will help with the practical support to help where possible. A prayer for people suffering due to the conflict in Gaza and Israel. Email David Cameron to call for peace and urge the UK to play its part in upholding international law. The challenges are set to continue into 2024, with the UN predicting increased displacement, conflict and the continued impact of climate change. As people of hope, we take heart in our ability to come together as a faith community to stand in solidarity with vulnerable communities. As we look to the new year ahead we thank everyone again for their continued support and wish you a peaceful festive break.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON — Around 3,500 employees are on the chopping block at the Food and Drug Administration, but they don’t yet know who they are.\nThe Health and Human Services Department on Thursday announced a sweeping plan to cut 10,000 jobs and consolidate operations across its sub-agencies. FDA drug, medical device, or food reviewers and inspectors will not be among those fired, according to an HHS fact sheet . Instead, the cuts will target employees working on policy, human resources, information technology, procurement, and communications. The administration will start sending notices to employees on Friday, with the terminations coming into effect on May 27.\nThe sparing of FDA reviewers may put some industry leaders at ease, but other FDA experts are concerned that firing the thousands of employees supporting their work will make it more difficult for the agency to promote innovation and protect public health. The layoffs will shrink the FDA by almost 20%.",
