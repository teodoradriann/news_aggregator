    "title": "Cascades Raptor Center Soars Again",
    "text": "The Cascades Raptor Center’s soft reopening on Feb. 8 sounded like a “welcome home” party for the birds and its generous volunteers. Birds calling, children laughing and CRC workers conversing about the raptors added to the overall rejoicing that the center, after three weeks of closure due to the mid-January ice storm, was open once again to the public.\n“We’ve been working way more than usual. We’re probably all a little bit rusty, birds and humans included too. We haven’t had to talk to guests like we usually do,” says Kit Lacy, a CRC bird curator who oversees the ambassador animal collection and rehabilitation cases of birds at the center.\nLacy says several staff members haven’t taken a day off since the storm, which downed two aviaries, cut out the electricity for the center and forced some birds to re-shelter in temporary aviaries.\nBut after an outpouring of donations from both seasoned and first-time donors, the CRC staff is ready for normal operations again — and to host an international bird training conference that started Feb. 14 and runs through Feb. 17.\n“To know that people care deeply and want to see us back open again — that’s why we decided we really wanted to have this special day,” Julie Collins, executive director of CRC, tells Eugene Weekly.\nCollins says the Raptor Center hopes to rebuild the two downed aviaries by the start of summer with help from Silver Brigade, a group that works weekly with CRC to help build new structures around the center.\n“We definitely still have some work to do, but now we feel we can buy all the lumber and supplies we need. Sometimes nonprofits, when you don’t have the funds, have to do things the best you can,” Collins says.\nThe threat for winter storms and summer fires has always existed for CRC, Collins says. To prevent any potential summer fires from burning down buildings, the center recently bought sheep to graze underbrush any potential fire hazards.\nLooking ahead to potential winter storms, CRC has a well-established routine on how to help the center’s grounds.\n“What we do every year, we [take] out trees and anything that looks dangerous or that doesn’t look healthy, we try to remove so that it would be safer,” Collins says.\nFor the immediate future, however, the staff at CRC aim to focus their attention on welcoming back visitors and holding the International Association of Avian Trainers and Educators Conference this week.\n“This is what we do and why we’re here. We don’t have these birds on our team to just live where with the trainers, they’re here to help us to inspire people and connect people with the world around us. It’s good to get back into the work of it,” Lacy says.",

    "title": "RAY MASSEY: BMW ups the ante with 356 mile range 340hp all-electric i5 eDrive40",
    "text": "To mark the start of 2024, I’ve been driving BMW’s new eighth-generation 5-series saloon — and specifically the first range-topping i5 all-electric model.\nBMW bosses say this 5 offers the technology and luxury of the pinnacle 7-series limousine —and I can confirm this to be the case.\nPrices are from £51,000 for the petrol 208 hp 520i capable of 0-62 mph in 7.5 seconds up to 143mph. There are two petrol-electric hybrid options. At the other end of the spectrum, the 601 hp all-wheel drive i5 M60 xDrive I tested reaches 62 mph in half that time — a supercar-like 3.8 seconds —up to 142 mph, and will cost about £100,000.\nBut as many purchasers will be company car and business users, tax advantages over private cash or finance-deal customers will slash the overall cost.\nThe smart, modern and uncluttered interior feels spacious and tastefully crafted.\nElectrifying: BMW’s claimed 356 mile range 340hp all-electric i5 eDrive40\nIt is a touch sci-fi — in a sophisticated way. It’s large and imposing, but elegantly so. And acceleration is formidable and smooth.\nThere’s even a soundtrack from Hollywood composer Hans Zimmer to accompany your launch.\nIt’s also the first BMW to feature in-car gaming via the large central screen. Leather-free Verganza interiors are offered as standard — the first BMWs in the UK to do so.\nThe EV M60’s claimed range is between 285 and 316 miles depending on spec. But brace yourself: that all costs £97,745. And with more than £17,000 of ‘extras’ on my car, that took the total to more than £115,000.\nThe interior lighting changes according to your driving or mood mode. There’s even a digital art option. Regenerative braking means you can drive ‘one pedal’ with little need to apply the brakes, while also generating and storing extra charge.\nIn the range just below and with much the same kit (though less power) is the 340 hp all-electric i5 eDrive40, from £74,550 with a range of up to 356 miles and 0-60 in 6 seconds. Touring estate versions join the line-up in spring.\nI really did have a celebratory ‘high five’ with the new BMW electric i5 – the flagship of the eighth generation 5-series since the 1970s.\nThe curved widescreen dashboard infotainment system and interior ambience made me feel like Star Trek’s Captain Kirk at the helm of the Starship Enterprise. I could almost imagine Dr McCoy in my ear saying: ‘It’s a 5-series Jim, but not as we know it.’\nBut while being hi-tech and luxurious, it is not ostentatious or blingy. It oozes sophistication. Captain Kirk would feel quite at home driving this for leisure and pleasure on his days off exploring the universe.\nHowever, you really do have to watch the speedo and finesse your right foot to avoid inadvertently hitting warp speed in this lightning-fast top of the range executive limo inspired by BMW’s Motorsport or ‘M’ division. The acceleration is phenomenal.\nIt is longer (it stretches to 5 meters), wider and taller and with an increased wheelbase and enhanced road presence compared to its predecessor\nThe smart, modern and uncluttered interior feels spacious and tastefully crafted\nBMW bosses say this 5 offers the technology and luxury of the pinnacle 7-series limousine\nThe i5 will be a stretch for all but the most well-heeled private buyers\nGreat for Germany de-restricted autobahns. But take care elsewhere.\nLonger (it stretches to 5 meters), wider, taller and with an increased wheelbase and enhanced road presence compared to its predecessor, the new 5 promises and delivers improved seating comfort and legroom, especially in the rear.\nIt brings the tech levels of the flagship 7-series limousine into the executive 5-series, proving that 7 into 5 really does go.\nAnd boy can you quickly run up a bill of optional extras.\nThe extras fitted to my car, that took the total to more than £115,000 included: £1,750 for M Carbon exterior styling; £3,300 for a technology plus pack that includes head-up display; and a Comfort Plus pack that adds front and rear heated seats, ventilated extra-comfort and beautifully crafted front seats, and an electric boot-lid.\nMy own driving experience comes as latest figures show that every fourth BMW sold in the UK last year was all-electric. And that can only accelerate,\nBMW Group UK reported 28,723 registrations of all-electric vehicles in 2023, a 34 per cent increase on 2022, and accounting for a quarter of the total 111,734 sales.\nIn the corporate sector the proportion is even higher, with half of all registrations being all-electric vehicles (BEVs).\nAs I indicated earlier – the i5 will be a stretch for all but the most well-heeled private buyers. But for executives securing one as their company car and benefitting from the generous tax perks, it’s a much more economically savvy option.\nSo, the risk of correcting the most famous split infinitive in broadcasting history, from Star Trek itself, let me conclude: the i5 really is an electric car in which to go boldly.\nHOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP How to save on car insurance: Ten top tips to cut the cost in just a few minutes Dumped car nuisance More than 53,000 abandoned cars were dumped on doorsteps last year, reveals new freedom of information data secured by specialist Scrap Car Comparison (scrapcarcomparison.co.uk).\nAnd anyone who has experienced the hassle it causes, as I did for nearly a year, with councils and police reluctant to act, knows just how infuriating it can be.\nHassle: More than 53,000 abandoned cars were dumped on doorsteps last year\nOutside London, the dumped-car capital of the UK is Coventry — once Britain’s principal car-making city — with 1,898, followed by Brighton & Hove (1,889), Leicester (1,765) and Manchester (1,664).\nLondon councils accounted for more than 29,500 of the total 53,794 abandoned cars, with Bromley topping the list with 2,239 in the year to September 2023.\nIn Scotland numbers were highest in Edinburgh (1,087) and Glasgow (1,043).\nThe report also reveal that January 2023 was the month that saw the greatest total number of abandoned vehicles in the year across the nation – a total of 3,666.\nThe report noted: ‘This could be down to a range of factors, such as an increase in opportunistic car theft and joyriding while people were out at festive celebrations, to people opting to desert a costly old motor as purse strings tighten in the winter months.’\nHowever, experts also add that some ‘informal’ car dealers also use public streets to park up their unsold vehicles\nSome abandoned cars are also stolen.\nDavid Kottaun, Operations Manager at Scrap Car Comparison said: ‘When a car becomes too much to run or maintain, some people can simply opt to abandon the vehicle.\n‘Abandoned vehicles can create problems for access if the car is blocking an entrance, path or even a road, as well as risking harming the environment they are abandoned in due to leaks of hazardous fluids. It also stretches the resources of councils investigating and removing the vehicle.\n‘While sometimes a vehicle may be abandoned due to crimes such as theft, in most cases where someone has chosen to leave their vehicle, they are potentially missing the opportunity to earn money due to scrapping their car instead.\n‘If a car is too old to drive or is not repairable, it could still offer you value through scrap value, so it is never a good idea to simply abandon a vehicle’.\nWebsite: https://www.scrapcarcomparison.co.uk/blog/scrap-car-report-statistics/\nLack of charging points could hit sales Government failure to meet its targets on public charging points risks putting the brakes on already sluggish electric car sales, say car dealers.\nHowever, prices for new electric cars could fall as manufacturers are forced by law to produce an increasingly higher percentage of electric vehicles —with some likely to be sold at a loss.\nA big influx of new, cheaper Chinese vehicles will also increase downward pressure on prices, says Auto Express editor Steve Fowler.\nInflux: Prices for new electric cars could fall as manufacturers are forced by law to produce an increasingly higher percentage of electric vehicles\nThe predictions follow the RAC announcing the Government had missed its motorway services high-power EV charger target in 2023.\nThe NFDA car dealer survey showed nearly six out of ten respondents who were not interested in purchasing an electric vehicle put this down to a lack of charging facilities in the UK.\nSAVE MONEY ON MOTORING Your legal duty Your legal duty Car insurance Compare policies Peace of mind Peace of mind Warranties Get covered Car servicing One-off or multi-year Save 40% One-off or annual 5,000+ dealers 5,000+ dealers Sell your car fast Up to £1,000 more Every year Every year MOTs made easy Apply online Affiliate links: If you take out a product This is Money may earn a commission.

Sin embargo, Atalanta fue más efectivo y no perdonó las distracciones del conjunto del alemán Jürgen Klopp.\nEn la segunda mitad, los locales fueron a buscar el empate desde el inicio. El propio Musso salvó un remate de Mohamed Salah y más tarde al delantero egipcio le anularon un gol por offside.\nDe esta manera, Atalanta sacó una ventaja muy importante para la revancha, que se disputará el jueves 18 de abril en el Gewiss Stadium de Bérgamo, en Italia.\nEn el duelo de equipos italianos, Roma venció 1-0 al Milan en el marco de la ida de los cuartos de final de la Europa League disputado en el estadio Giuseppe Meazza.\nhttps://www.espn.com.ar/video/clip/_/id/13503063\nEl cordobés Paulo Dybala otorgó una asistencia para que Gianluca Mancini anote el único tanto del encuentro, luego de una polémica jugada previa que derivó en un corner y en la que parecía haber offside de Romelu Lukaku; asimismo, Leandro Paredes fue titular en el equipo visitante dirigido por Daniele De Rossi.\nCon este resultado, Roma sacó una leve ventaja para el encuentro de vuelta que se disputará el jueves 18 abril en el Estadio Olímpico de Roma.\nPor último, Bayer Leverkusen -dirigido por Xabi Alonso y orquestado en mitad de cancha por Exequiel Palacios- sigue dando pasos agigantados en la temporada, ya que, además de estar en lo más alto de la Bundesliga y a un paso de ser campeón, venció 2-0 a West Ham en la ida de los cuartos de la Europa League y sacó una buena ventaja de cara a la vuelta en Inglaterra.\nhttps://www.espn.com.ar/video/clip/_/id/13503075\nLos tantos fueron anotados por dos jugadores ingresados: Jonas Hofmann y el nigeriano Victor Boniface.",

    "title": "NRL must make 'money man' Langer next Immortal: Walters",
    "text": "The NRL should go \"back to the future\" and make rugby league icon Allan Langer the next Immortal, Brisbane coach Kevin Walters insists. A new Immortal, the 14th, will be inducted at a Hall of Fame dinner next month and Langer will be one of the candidates along with legends of the game such as Ron Coote, Darren Lockyer, Billy Slater, Johnathan Thurston and Cameron Smith. Langer won four man of the match awards for Queensland in 34 Origin games spanning 15 years and had and a decorated 25-game Test career. Throw in his 258-game club career and four premierships as captain with the Broncos, including a Clive Churchill medal in 1992, and it is a remarkable record for a footballer who stood at just 165cm. \"It is pretty clear in my head that Allan Langer is very much underrated as far as elite players go and Immortal players,\" Walters said. \"There is nothing he didn't do on the field for the Broncos, whether it was captaining the club to four premierships or captaining Queensland to series wins or for Australia. \"Locky would be another one but I have got Alf in front of Locky at this stage. I am not saying Locky can't be an Immortal in the future but right now Alfie is the one. \"They have got a statue of him (at Suncorp Stadium). All they have got to do now is make him Immortal. Cameron, JT and Billy have only just recently retired. We've got to go back to the future.\" Walters played alongside Langer at the Broncos and for Queensland and Australia with him. \"He was known as 'the money man'. That was a thing amongst all the players at the Broncos through that era,\" Walters said. \"A lot of us would go to the bank and put our card in and there was no money coming out. He always had something, particularly late in games. When he went to the machine there was always something coming out. \"Two things (stand out). His unpredictability on the field. Sometimes Alfie didn't know what Alfie was doing but it just seemed to work. \"And just the size of him. I think he was 67 kilograms in his first State of Origin game and most of that was all ticker. For the size of him I think he achieved enormous things, and there was his mental strength and his capacity to want to win. \"Alfie brings people together and he brings the game together. \"If you ask a lot of people their thoughts, the fans, I am sure Alfie would be right up there.\" In 2018 Wayne Bennett said Langer deserved Immortal status. \"I believe he is the best Bronco and the most influential player in my time here,\" Bennett insisted. \"\"He was a star for a decade. In my opinion, he was the best player in the game for a decade.\"Joey (Andrew Johns) was a wonderful player. It was just that Alf got lost in it all ... but if he'd been down in NSW, Alf would have been Immortalised, there is no doubt about that.\"",

    "text": "Estiman que las temperaturas serán superiores a lo habitual en la zona central y este del país, incluida la Ciudad de Buenos Aires y la Costa Atlántica . Se esperan precipitaciones inferiores a la normal en el este de la provincia de Buenos Aires y en la Patagonia. De noviembre a enero, hay posibilidad de variaciones subestacionales con olas de calor. Lo esencial: durante el trimestre noviembre 2024 a enero 2025, la Ciudad de Buenos Aires (CABA) y su zona metropolitana es probable que experimenten jornadas más calurosas que lo habitual , según anticipa el nuevo informe trimestral del Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) . Esta probabilidad podría ser más notoria en el este de la provincia de Buenos Aires, impulsada por factores climáticos estacionales y la ausencia de fuerzas de gran escala como El Niño o La Niña. Además, las lluvias serán escasas e inferiores a lo habitual en la región este bonaerense, incluida la Costa Atlántica y zonas aledañas.\nPor qué importa : el clima caluroso y seco previsto va a influir en la planificación de actividades al aire libre y el turismo durante las fiestas de fin de año, una época de reuniones familiares y también en la temporada de verano en la costa bonaerense. Las altas temperaturas y la falta de lluvias pueden intensificar las olas de calor y aumentar la demanda de agua y energía.\nEs recomendable seguir los sistemas de alerta por olas de calor para mitigar los riesgos en la salud . La reducción en las lluvias podría tensar los recursos de agua en las zonas del país más afectadas por las altas temperaturas El pronóstico de noviembre a enero para todo el país\nEl nuevo informe del SMN advierte sobre temperaturas superiores a lo esperado de noviembre a enero (Christian Heit) El pronóstico climático trimestral elaborado por el SMN para noviembre-diciembre 2024 y enero 2025, indica las probabilidades de precipitación y temperatura para todo el país. El SMN utiliza las categorías Superior a la Normal (SN), Normal (N), e Inferior a la normal (IN) como valor de referencia para estimar las previsiones meteorológicas.\n“El informe muestra que gran parte del país tendrá temperaturas superiores a las normales , con mayor probabilidad de que eso ocurra en el centro y centro este del país” , dijo a Infobae Cindy Fernández , comunicadora del Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN),\n“Se espera que predomine una circulación de vientos que favorezca el ingreso de aire cálido en esas zonas, y que predominen los días mayormente soleados, esto contribuye a este pronóstico de lluvias inferiores a lo normal y temperaturas cálidas” , completó Fernández.\nEn tanto, ante la consulta de Infobae, Alpio Costa , meteorólogo e investigador en el Instituto Antártico Argentino (IAA/DNA), señaló que “ es altamente probable que encaremos un final de primavera e inicio de verano seco y caluroso” .\nEl informe del SMN estima probabilidades para los próximos 90 días, pero vale destacar que eso no quita que dentro del trimestre se desarrolle algún subperíodo con características distintas, como unos días o una semana más fresca de lo normal, agregó Costa.\nCalor agobiante en el centro del país Se esperan temperaturas “normales o superiores a la normal” en la franja central del país, la región norte y mayores posibilidades hacia el este de Buenos Aires. En el este y sur de la Patagonia se estiman valores habituales de temperatura para esta época del año.\nEn cuanto a las jornadas cálidas que pueden avecinarse , la franja central del país, que incluye CABA, la provincia de Buenos Aires y la Costa Atlántica, presenta posibilidades de temperaturas superiores a la normal (SN).\n“Todo el centro y este de la provincia de Buenos Aires, incluyendo el área metropolitana y la Costa Atlántica , está en una zona donde las probabilidades de déficit de lluvias y temperaturas por encima de lo normal es bastante alta , supera inclusive el 50%”, detalló Costa .\nSe recomienda estar atentos a sistemas de alerta por olas de calor (Télam) “Es importante saber dos cosas al mirar los mapas del informe del SMN –aclaró Costa– cuando uno pronostica para un período a futuro uno tiene tres categorías: las condiciones estén por arriba de lo normal, dentro del rango normal, o por debajo de lo normal, si las tres categorías fueran igualmente probables, cada una tendría un 33,3% de probabilidad de ocurrir” .\n“Justamente lo interesante es observar cuando la probabilidad de ocurrencia futura de una de las tres categorías le gana a las otras dos. Los distintos tonos de colores no hablan de la intensidad de cuánto más calor o menos lluvia vamos a tener, sino de cuán probable es que la categoría domine en los próximos 90 días”, agregó el meteorólogo.\nMenos lluvias que lo normal El informe del SMN estima que es probable que las lluvias sean escasas, es decir “inferior a la normal” en el este de la provincia de Buenos Aires y hacia el oeste y sur de la Patagonia . Es probable que las precipitaciones sean normales o “inferior a la normal” en el sur del Litoral, Córdoba, este de San Luis, oeste de Buenos Aires, La Pampa y este de Patagonia.\n“En el nuevo pronóstico trimestral del SMN se ve claramente que toda la Patagonia y el centro del país, sacando Cuyo, espera precipitaciones por debajo de lo normal en el promedio de los próximos 90 días ”, consideró Costa.\nLas condiciones del Fenómeno El Niño Oscilación del Sur (ENOS) permanecen en estado neutro, lo que si gnifica que no se espera la influencia directa de El Niño o La Niña durante el período.\nPara quienes planean sus vacaciones en esta época, es importante destacar que, a pesar de las tendencias generales, se recomienda revisar los pronósticos diarios y semanales . Las oscilaciones subestacionales y sinópticas pueden causar eventos de lluvia localmente intensas o temperaturas extremas que no están previstas en el pronóstico estacional. Se sugiere, además, estar atentos al sistema de alerta por olas de calor o temperaturas extremas.",
