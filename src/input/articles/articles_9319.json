[ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 05-07-2024 14:28 IST | Created: 05-07-2024 14:28 IST - Country: - India Emphasising the state government's commitment to sustainable environmental practices and fostering a greener future, Tripura Chief Minister Manik Saha took part in a state-level mass plantation drive on Friday near Taranagar on NH 108 B in the Mohanpur sub-division of West Tripura. The plantation drive was a part of \"Ek pedh maa ke naam\" initiative started by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on World Environment Day, Saha said. \"For keeping the environment alive, PM Modi on World Environment Day adopted the slogan 'Ek pedh maa ke naam'. All the ministers and leaders across India have planted saplings. It is a very innovative slogan and everyone has a lot of enthusiasm for it here,\" he said. Saha, accompanied by Minister of Forest Animesh Debbarma and Minister of Agriculture and Power Ratan Lal Nath at the drive, led this special initiative, planting 5 lakh seedlings in just 5 minutes, highlighting the importance of environmental conservation at the present time. \"Along with our Forest Minister Animesh Debbarma and Minister of Agriculture and Power Ratan Lal Nath, we have planted trees here, in addition to 5 lakh trees planted in five minutes all across Tripura,\" Saha said. Saha led the way for the programme in order to raise awareness about the role of planting seedlings and saplings in combating the challenges faced due to global warming and climate change. \"Ecological balance is very important. It is a symbiotic relationship between man and tree. To counter global warming, trees are very important,\" he added. Forest Minister Animesh Debbarma also spoke about the problems related to global warming and heat waves and how they can be countered by planting trees. He further said that they have identified degraded land where more trees can be planted. \"All the problems related to global warming, and heatwaves can be countered by planting trees. I had a meeting with the officer of the forest department, and wherever there is degraded land due to work on the national highway, we will plant trees there,\" Debbarma said. He also stated that the forest department has a target to plant an additional 40 to 45 lakh trees by the end of this year. \"At the end of the year, we have a target to plant an additional 40-45 lakh trees. We already have 76 lakh seedlings and we will try to take them to 50 lakh fully grown trees,\" he added.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more .\nCNN — Parrots are smart, with some species found to have the problem-solving skills of a young child . So if small kids can use technology in some capacity, why can’t parrots?\nResearchers aiming to answer why parrots should use technology for cognitive enrichment set out to answer just how tablets could be improved for optimal use by the intelligent birds , according to a recent March study.\nBy designing a balloon-popping tablet game and collecting data from 20 pet parrots, the researchers found that birds’ interest in the game indicated mental stimulation could be a potential benefit. However, the critters’ anatomy was an obstacle to interacting with the screens. Each parrot popped virtual balloons by using its tongue and beak, with eyes often very close to the screen. As a result, the bird would have to turn its head or pull back to find the next target.\nA parrot pops virtual balloons by using its tongue and beak. Kleinberger et al. The findings establish a framework that researchers can use to design bird-friendly tablets, according to the study , which has been peer-reviewed prior to an upcoming May presentation at the ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, lead author Rébecca Kleinberger said.\n“A lot of animals in managed care, in zoos, in homes, they interact with technology on a daily basis. They see the screens that we use. Sometimes they use some as toys,” said Kleinberger, an assistant professor of humanics and voice technology at Northeastern University in Boston. “But there is very little research done on how does technology affect animals’ experiences and how we could potentially create better technologies for animal enrichment.”\nKleinberger is the principal investigator of the INTERACT Animal Lab, a team of researchers who study how technology can enrich the lives of dogs, orcas and birds, according to a news release from Northeastern University. The team released a 2023 study that revealed a group of parrots enjoyed making video calls with other feathered friends .\n18 dogs and their owners participated in the experiment.

Rébecca Kleinberger\nResearchers designed the tablet game to be used by a parrot in collaboration with the bird's caretaker. Rébecca Kleinberger Tablets designed with parrots in mind Seventeen birds completed the study, which involved interacting with a touch screen for no more than 30 minutes a day for three months. Two birds dropped out after a lack of interest in the tablet, while one bird showed signs of stress and anxiety. Caretakers recorded their parrots at home, keeping them on a familiar schedule. The human study participants also played a part in praising and encouraging their creatures to stay engaged, Kleinberger said.\nSome parrots were precise when tapping a target on the screen, while others seemed to be more engaged in the interaction with their caretakers.\n“The (games) were not made to be used in isolation for the bird to do by (themselves), but really, to consider in the social context of their existing interaction with their caregivers, and how the system can also help reinforce the bond between humans and animals,” Kleinberger said.\nRébecca Kleinberger is the principal investigator of the INTERACT Animal Lab, a team of researchers who study how technology can enrich the lives of dogs, orcas and birds. Gabriel Miller One way to improve tablet designs for birds is to use the camera on the device to have a better sense of where the bird is and adjust accordingly, or redesign the layout of a game with the parrot’s proximity to the screen in mind so the bird can see the targets better, Kleinberger said. Another improvement the researchers identified solved the problem of birds tapping one target multiple times very quickly and apparently growing frustrated. One bird showed more interest in playing the game after researchers adjusted the tablets to only account for one tap per 300 milliseconds, she added.\nIt was not surprising that the birds could learn to follow a circle on a screen because of their higher capacity for intelligence, said Kurt Sladky, a clinical professor of zoological medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s School of Veterinary Medicine. Sladky was not involved in the new study.\n“We see a lot of birds that, for whatever reason, out of boredom, or out of sexual frustration, they pick their feathers. … I think to prevent some of that boredom, I can see (playing games) being useful — they love noises, they love music, they love watching things,” said Sladky, who has feathered patients that have shown interest in watching YouTube videos of other birds.\nB8C6TT MEXICAN AXOLOTL Stephen Dalton/Avalon.red/Alamy Stock Photo Related article Why axolotls seem to be everywhere — except in the one lake they call home\nMobile games for parrot enrichment If a parrot owner is looking to introduce tablets into a pet’s schedule, it’s important to remember that the activity should be collaborative between the owner and the bird, Pepperberg said. “But if you’re just leaving it in the cage, for the birds, it’s like leaving your young children with a tablet all day.”\nEvery bird will have individual likes and dislikes, favoring one game and not another, she added. Pet owners should watch their birds for symptoms of aggression and irritability in using the tablet while also keeping birds on a schedule and not having them play with tablets for long periods.\n“When we look at the way technology has changed human lives, in the good and the bad, it’s tremendous how much our lives have changed for the past 100 years,” Kleinberger said. “A lot of our research (looks into) providing ethical, sustainable and meaningful enrichment for animals (with technology) designed for their own well-being … rather than systems that are used to reduce the interaction that we as humans need to provide them.”",

    "text": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard & Husband Reveal How They Met & Fell in Love While She Was in Prison [Gypsy Rose Blanchard](https://www.justjared.com/tags/gypsy-rose-blanchard/) is officially a free woman and she can now live her happily ever after with husband Ryan Scott Anderson. For those who don’t know, Gypsy got married in a small prison ceremony back in July 2022. The 32-year-old, a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, was serving eight years for the murder of her mother Dee Dee Blanchard. The prison where Gypsy was held does not allow conjugal visits, so the newlyweds were unable to consummate their marriage. They finally will have the chance now that she is free. In a new interview, Gypsy and Ryan talked about how they met and what it was like falling in love while she was locked away. Keep reading to find out more… “It was when Tiger King was really popular,” Ryan told [People](https://people.com/gypsy-rose-blanchard-wants-children-husband-after-prison-exclusive-8420555) about his decision to reach out to Gypsy. “My co-worker at the time was like ‘I want to write Tiger King.’ I said, ‘I’ll tell you what, if you write him, I’ll write Gypsy Rose Blanchard. I never thought she’d be my wife.’” “I remember telling her what her story meant to me, and on the second page I just let her have it. I told her everything about me,” Ryan added. He said, “She told me the main reason [she responded] was probably because I was from Louisiana [Gypsy's original home state]. So I credit that as being the most important thing.” “I remember I had butterflies when we’d email, but really what set it over the top was the first time I heard her voice,” he said. Gypsy talked about her love for Ryan. “Ryan has seen me through some really good times, some really hard times. I would say that he is probably the most compassionate soul that I’ve ever met, and the most patient,” she said. “God knows, he’s so patient with me, because I could be a lot to handle. I could be an emotional handful.” Gypsy added, “We’re in love… It’s hard because I’m going into a new life and I’m newly married, and I’m going to have kids one day, and I’m going to have to explain to my kids why their grandmother on mommy’s side isn’t around. And that’s going to be a really hard conversation.” Gypsy is optimistic about life as a freed married woman. “I don’t foresee any major hardships,” she said. “I think this, being in prison, has been the hard part. I think when I’m at home with my family, with my husband’s arms around me and I’m surrounded by my loved ones, that is when I will be happy.” Learn all about [the new docu-series that is premiering](https://www.justjared.com/2023/12/28/the-prison-confessions-of-gypsy-rose-blanchard-how-to-watch/) next week.

    "text": "The \"Predatory Trade Practices Act\" is a deeply flawed proposal that would expose thousands of South Carolina’s most financially vulnerable citizens to the kinds of predatory lending practices the bill’s sponsors and advocates claim they want to prevent. The bill, S.910, also would impose additional burdensome restrictions on South Carolina installment lenders that would significantly reduce the availability of safe, affordable credit to more than 45% of low-incomes households throughout the state. For more than a century, credit-building loans like traditional installment loans have served as effective and beneficial economic tools to empower S.C. households, particularly those consumers who do not have strong credit histories. S.910 contains many unnecessary if not ill-informed provisions. For example, it would bar installment lenders from using text messaging to market to consumers. There’s one problem: Installment lenders are already barred from using text messages under the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Similarly, the bill requires installment lending companies like mine, which are not banks or credit unions, to undertake analysis of prospective borrowers’ ability to repay a loan before making the loan. But all licensed installment lenders in the state already do this through an underwriting process that is more rigorous than the bill’s requirements, and usually includes face-to-face meetings between the borrower and installment lender. Such hands-on customer care is never more apparent than in the convenience check, or \"live check\" process. These are checks mailed to select consumers who have been evaluated for a history of credit repayment. Once a customer deposits a convenience check and activates the loan, one of our local customer service staff works directly with the borrower to review terms of the loan, ensuring the customer fully understands the transaction. Every check is clearly marked as a loan and as an installment loan is subject to stringent federal and state oversight. We adhere to the Federal Truth in Lending Act requiring standard disclosure of annual percentage rates, finance charges, amount financed and total payments and terms, all found in a bold, bordered box on the front page at the top of every credit disclosure. S.910 would not apply to banks or credit unions that use some of the same practices that the bill claims it wants to end. Common sense dictates that a bill that bars what it calls “predatory practices” from one set of lenders should include all lenders. S.910 instead picks winners and losers in the market, while imposing real financial harm on tens of thousands of South Carolinians. Unlike most small-dollar loan products at credit unions, installment loans are not secured by a borrower’s checking and savings account, home or vehicle. Credit unions also market credit products to low-income consumers that include as many as 45 different monthly and annual junk fees. Installment lenders do not require a borrower to provide access to their savings or checking accounts, and there are no hidden fees. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reports that more than 26% of S.C. households are either unbanked or underbanked, meaning they have severely limited access to bank services and look to non-bank sources for the credit they need to avoid hardship and build a positive credit history. Yet credit unions require costs to open an account, sometimes with the full amount of what a consumer wishes to borrow deposited to secure the loan. How do these onerous requirements help consumers in need of greater financial flexibility, not less? But credit unions are exempted from S.910. By steering consumers toward loan alternatives at credit unions, policymakers are limiting consumers to options that can trap borrowers in a cycle of debt. Such products often take years to pay off with minimum payments, are subject to fluctuating interest rates, come with frequently changing terms and conditions and end up costing borrowers significantly more over time. Traditional installment loans, on the other hand, have clear terms, consistent monthly payments with a payoff date. They have no hidden fees or balloon payments. South Carolina’s installment lenders are committed to serving the customers who rely on them. We also commit to working with policymakers on additional consumer protections that offer borrowers greater confidence and choices that benefit their financial needs. Unfortunately, S.910 accomplishes none of these goals. Legislators should start from scratch and work with all parties invested in ensuring all our citizens have access to fair, transparent and affordable credit. J. Dan Walters is the CEO of Credit Central, an installment lender based in Greenville.",

    "text": "Si bien entendemos la objeción de conciencia personal para respetar las creencias religiosas o éticas frente al procedimiento, no concuerda que la Universidad como institución deba excluirse de los criterios establecidos como país.\nDistintos medios sacaron a relucir una práctica de Universidad Católica que lamentablemente no es novedad: Los centros de Salud UC CHRISTUS no realizan procedimientos anticonceptivos de largo plazo y de esterilización como lo son el DIU, el implante subdérmico, y vasectomías, todo esto bajo la justificación del respeto intransigente a su concepción ética de planificación familiar.\nEstas prácticas, no son nada nuevas. El 2017, luego de años de lucha y discusión en las calles y en espacios legislativos, se promulgó la Ley 21.030 sobre la interrupción voluntaria del embarazo en tres causales, un gran paso para quienes creemos en el aborto libre como un derecho. Sin embargo, solo un par de meses después la Red Salud UC CHRISTUS se convirtió en la segunda institución privada en ser objetora de conciencia.\nNo nos parece congruente la actitud de la institución ya que uno de los pilares fundamentales de nuestra Universidad es su compromiso con el servicio público y la vinculación con el medio. En innumerables ocasiones han declarado la importancia de que la comunidad UC esté inmersa en la realidad que vive Chile y el mundo, pero al momento de hablar sobre derechos sexuales y reproductivos, que es una discusión urgente para las niñas, adolescentes y mujeres de la sociedad, nos cierran las puertas. Podríamos especular que esta puerta no se puede abrir, pero sería incorrecto, porque desde el 2004 la Facultad de Medicina UC en representación de nuestra casa de estudios se comprometió a construir y administrar los Centros de Salud Familiar (CESFAM) Áncora, instituciones que han sido reconocidas por la comunidad debido a su labor como centros de atención pública en comunas del sur oriente de Santiago y que, por su sentido público, realizan tratamientos anticonceptivos de largo plazo. Es precisamente, este sentido público el que como Consejería Superior de la Universidad Católica, queremos que se replique en la Red UC CHRISTUS.\nSin embargo, no somos los únicos con este deseo. Somos cientos de compañeras y trabajadoras de la comunidad UC, quienes, a través del Petitorio Feminista 2024 para este 8M, le exigimos a la Universidad que deje de excluirse de decisiones que hemos acordado como país y que de una vez por todas asuma el rol público que tanto se enorgullece de tener. Declaramos en este: “Si bien entendemos la objeción de conciencia personal para respetar las creencias religiosas o éticas frente al procedimiento, no concuerda que la Universidad como institución deba excluirse de los criterios establecidos entre todas las personas como comunidad, pues esto constituye una restricción al acceso de prestaciones legitimas, afectando derechos e intereses de las mujeres y cuerpos gestantes consagrados en nuestra actual legislación”. Punto que junto a otras demandas será votado el próximo 6 y 7 de marzo en la UC.\nHoy, el 63% de mujeres entre 15 y 29 años no proyecta ser madre en el futuro y más de la mitad indican que estarían dispuestas a realizarse o inducirse un aborto (INJUV, 2022). Nuestro sentido público tiene que responder a esa realidad, no a la que queramos imponer, tiene que responder con la entrega de tratamientos que nos permitan elegir nuestro futuro. Pero lamentablemente, si hoy una estudiante UC quiere utilizar un anticonceptivo de larga duración, sin importar la razón de su decisión, el establecimiento educacional que ella escogió para formarse y fomentó la libertad, le negará su derecho.\nIsidora Rodríguez, Consejera Superior de la Universidad Católica\nEl contenido vertido en esta columna de opinión es de exclusiva responsabilidad de su autor, y no refleja necesariamente la línea editorial ni postura de El Mostrador .",
