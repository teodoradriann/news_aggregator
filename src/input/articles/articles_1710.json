    "text": "In every issue of Ms., we track research on our progress in the fight for equality, catalogue can’t-miss quotes from feminist voices and keep tabs on the feminist movement’s many milestones. We’re Keeping Score online, too—in this biweekly roundup. Lest We Forget “To the entire LGBTQI+ community—and especially transgender children—please know that your president and my entire administration have your back. We see you for who you are: made in the image of God and deserving of dignity, respect and support. America is the only Nation in the world founded on an idea: We are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We have never fully lived up to that idea, but we have never fully walked away from it either. This month, we recommit to realizing the promise of America for all Americans, to celebrating courageous LGBTQI+ people, and to taking pride in the example they set for our Nation and the world.”– [President Biden]officially recognizing this June as Pride Month. “The threats to a woman’s right to make her own decisions about her body and her future keep coming—right now Republicans are working to rip away access to safe medication abortion, block women from receiving emergency abortion care that could save their lives, ban abortion nationwide, and restrict access to contraception. And Republican attacks on basic healthcare are only escalating. The antiabortion movement has shown its cruelty and utter disregard for women’s lives again and again, and it is essential that we use every opportunity to continue to make clear exactly how extreme right-wing abortion bans and restrictions on reproductive health care have endangered women, hurt families, and rolled back rights.”–Senators Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Ver.) announcing a congressional hearing on the harm caused by abortion bans since the Dobbs decision. “As a young girl, I would come home, I’d settle in after a day of school, pull up my TV tray with dinner and I would turn on my evening ritual: Jeopardy! And I’d glance at the coffee table, where I’d see an array of things: it could be the cat’s collar, my homework, some mail that had just been brought in—and some magazines. The magazines said Ms. on them. “I remember them vividly because the pictures were different. There was diversity that I hadn’t seen as often, both of color and of age and the names were different. There were congresswomen, there were astronauts and the topics were different—from mothering to being a working mom to heavier topics such as domestic violence, the poverty line, unearthing its roots, where it comes from and matters of equity. “I was too young at the time to know what most of it meant. But I also knew that to my mom, the significance of these magazines was important. I mean, it wasn’t a one-off. She had a subscription and having these pages in our home, it signaled to me that there was just so much more than the dolled-up covers and the images that you would see on the grocery store covers. It signaled to me that substance mattered.”– [Meghan Markle], the Duchess of Sussex, sharing her experience with Ms. at the [Ms. Foundation 2023 Women of Vision Awards]. “There was a well-published case [in Louisiana], a woman’s water broke early, the pregnancy was nonviable, but because of the abortion ban in the state, doctors recommended a C-section because they were too worried about the liability of doing a D&C, an abortion. “We are now in a moment in this country where we are having to do the most dangerous procedure to save lives, it’s egregious. It’s dangerous. Doctors are afraid to do their jobs, hospitals are afraid to see patients, you’re creating healthcare deserts. We’re creating new barriers for care. And who’s the most impacted? It’s women of color, immigrant women, those most on the margins of access to care.”–Reproductive Freedom for All president and CEO [Mini Timmaraju], speaking at the [Black Maternal Health Week roundtable]. “I appreciated what she said. I think she’s gonna be on our team because we have a lot of the same ideas, the same thoughts. You know, we had a nasty campaign; it was pretty nasty. But she’s a very capable person, and I’m sure she’s going to be on our team in some form. Absolutely.”–Donald Trump, [praising Nikki Haley]after she announced she would vote for him in November. “I was losing so much blood, the security guard put me in a wheelchair. The standard treatment for a miscarriage—what I was experiencing—is exactly the same treatment as a medication abortion. Yet in the second hospital, the staff told me that ‘we’re not doing that now’ and told me to go home and wait. Ultimately, it took weeks for me to pass my pregnancy—at home, and I was absolutely terrified. This experience has made me see how Black women die without proper maternal care.”–Louisiana resident Kaitlyn Joshua, who experienced a miscarriage at 11 weeks and faced the grim realities of the state’s near-total abortion ban. Milestones + Former President Trump was convicted of 34 felony charges last week, at the end of his hush money trial in New York. His sentencing is scheduled for July 11, four days before the Republican National Convention where he is expected to formally become their presidential nominee. + Senate Republicans blocked the Right to Contraception Act (RTCA), which received 51 votes but couldn’t overcome the filibuster. Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) voted with Democrats in support of the bill, which would have codified the right to birth control and emergency contraception. + Almost half of swing-state voters trust Vice President Kamala Harris to take over as president if necessary. However, polls still show that she would do worse than President Biden in a campaign race with Donald Trump. + Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey’s millionaire tax has already generated $1.8 billion, $800 million more than expected for this year. The state plans to invest the additional revenue in education and infrastructure. “Opponents of the Fair Share Amendment claimed that multimillionaires would flee Massachusetts rather than pay the new tax, and they are being proven wrong every day,” said a spokesperson for Raise Up Massachusetts. + The Texas Supreme Court rejected a challenge to their abortion ban led by 20 women who were denied medically necessary abortions. + Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Katie Britt (R-Ala.) bashed a Progress Action Fund ad depicting a generic Republican politician taking a baby from a couple that used IVF, amid attempts to ban the procedure in Republican-dominated states. The senators claimed it was “utterly repulsive,” and pointed to their bill that would cut Medicaid from states that ban IVF—which wouldn’t protect IVF at all, since the same states want to cut Medicaid anyway. “Ted Cruz is disgusting, deceptive, and shameless,” responded Progress Action Fund Founder and Executive Director Joe Jacobson. “His bill is a Trojan Horse that would help accomplish his repulsive goal of taking away healthcare and reproductive freedom from millions of Americans. The American people will see right through Cruz’s charade, as threatening Republicans with Medicaid cuts is as much of a deterrent as threatening him with a trip to Cancun.” + A new rule proposed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons would punish incarcerated people who use social media or direct others to on their behalf. Many incarcerated people use social media to follow the lives of friends and family and raise awareness of abusive living conditions within prisons. But the proposed rule would put social media use in the same “high risk” discipline category as fighting and property damage. + A South Dakota coalition has been blocked by Lamar Advertising from running billboards with a link to information on abortion care, despite Lamar approving the campaign in January. A similar billboard campaign in Chicago was also blocked by Lamar in Chicago this spring. + The three liberal Supreme Court justices recused themselves from a lawsuit filed against them for rejecting a case seeking to overturn the 2020 election. Raland Brunson previously sued hundreds of members of Congress for not investigating election fraud, and certifying President Biden’s win. The Court rejected that suit in 2023, and has now also refused to hear his case against Justices Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson. + Several Texas professors are suing for the right to misgender transgender students and teaching assistants, as well as punish students who need to miss class to get an abortion. + Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry signed a new anti-abortion bill into law, classifying mifepristone and misoprostol as dangerous controlled substances, at the same level as powerful opioids. The bill will make it much harder for patients to receive medication abortion prescriptions, and will increase the fear and scrutiny abortion care providers and patients face. + Massachusetts man Robert Kawada has been charged with poisoning and assault and battery after tricking his ex-girlfriend of a few months into taking abortion pills. Prosecutors say Kawada faked a phone call from a nurse recommending iron pills, and then gave her misoprostol instead. + The Biden administration has canceled $7.7 billion in student loans , affecting over 160,000 people. This brings their total canceled debt to a whopping $167 billion, for 4.75 million people. + Anti-abortion doctor Ingrid Skop was appointed to the Texas Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Review Committee, which studies the impact of abortion bans on maternal mortality. In 2021, Skop testified that rape and incest victims as young as 9 could safely carry pregnancies to term. + Melinda French Gates is leaving the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and launching her new philanthropic efforts with a $1 billion pledge to organizations focused on women and families. “In nearly 20 years as an advocate for women and girls, I have learned that there will always be people who say it’s not the right time to talk about gender equality. Not if you want to be relevant. Not if you want to be effective with world leaders (most of them men). The second the global agenda gets crowded, women and girls fall off. It’s frustrating and shortsighted,” she shared. + Maurie D. McInnis will be the first permanent female president of Yale University . The author and cultural historian is currently president of Stony Brook University, where she recently survived a censure vote after over 30 pro-Palestine protesters were arrested on campus. + Minnesota defeated Boston 3-0 to win the first Professional Women’s Hockey League championship . The league has six teams, and promising attendance means next year’s season will increase from 24 to 30 games. + The NCAA could reach a $2.8 billion settlement agreement with college athletes that would allow students to be paid and receive back pay for television revenue since 2016. But with football and men’s basketball the major TV revenue drivers, the settlement could violate Title IX by discriminating against women athletes. Colleges already struggle to meet Title IX requirements: a 2019 survey found that 80 to 90 percent of athletic programs did not comply with Title IX. They regularly underfund women’s programs and offer more scholarship aid to men. University of Florida women’s volleyball coach Mary Wise comments, “What we’ve seen in the past in women’s athletics is if they don’t have a seat at the table, they’ll be on the menu.” + As the Supreme Court considers another abortion case, almost 6,000 doctors from all 50 states have signed a letter urging the Court to uphold the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) and protect emergency abortion care. “We know firsthand how complications from pregnancy can lead very quickly to a medical crisis, requiring immediate care and treatment. Doctors and health professionals in emergency departments must be allowed to use the full range of medical options to save these patients’ lives, including abortion,” the letter states. + Mexico elected their first woman and first Jewish president, Claudia Sheinbaum . Sheinbaum won with over 58 percent of the vote, and is the former governor of Mexico City. She also holds a Ph.D. in energy engineering. How We’re Doing + Americans are getting their periods younger , at an average of 11.9 for those born from 2000-2005, compared to 12.5 for those born between 1950-1969. Better nutrition and higher body fat percentage may be one cause, but researchers worry that endocrine-disrupting chemicals from plastics and pollution may also be to blame. Girls of color and those with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to start their periods early. And early puberty can stunt growth and increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and breast cancer, as well as sexual violence, anxiety and depression. + New research found that pregnancy requires about 50,000 dietary calories , much more than previously believed. Scientists assumed that the energy was solely for the fetus, but found that 96 percent of the energy required for pregnancy was actually needed for the heavy demands on the pregnant person’s body. + Around 8.5 percent of all assessments on the Ada Health app are of sexual health-related conditions. As such, Ada was also one of the founding members of the U.S. Business Action to End HIV by the Health Action Alliance, a coalition to reduce the transmission of HIV in the United States. Ms. spoke to Dr. Claire Novorol, chief medical officer and co-founder at Ada Health, to learn more about the role that AI tools play in reproductive healthcare. The app uses AI technology to assist in the early diagnosis of symptoms in patients using a conversational bot and an algorithm trained in medical knowledge. “We do a lot of work to ensure that we’re providing equitable access to health information and care through the AI and that we’re training the AI to be as valuable as possible across all age groups and all conditions,” said Novorol. She emphasized that the single largest user group for the app is young women, and so training the AI to be cognizant of how issues may present uniquely in female-bodied individuals is a priority. “We’ve actually had quite a lot of feedback from people saying that they received their endometriosis diagnoses after Ada suggested it despite years of navigating the system and not having a diagnosis.” Up next: U.S. democracy is at a dangerous inflection point—from the demise of abortion rights, to a lack of pay equity and parental leave, to skyrocketing maternal mortality, and attacks on trans health. Left unchecked, these crises will lead to wider gaps in political participation and representation. For 50 years, Ms. has been forging feminist journalism—reporting, rebelling and truth-telling from the front-lines, championing the Equal Rights Amendment, and centering the stories of those most impacted. With all that’s at stake for equality, we are redoubling our commitment for the next 50 years. In turn, we need your help, Support Ms . today with a donation—any amount that is meaningful to you . For as little as $5 each month , you’ll receive the print magazine along with our e-newsletters, action alerts, and invitations to Ms. Studios events and podcasts.

    "text": "What can you eat during Ramadan? Tips for healthy fasting\nRamadan is a beautiful expression of the desire to show Allah your dedication to improve through an effort of discipline. During fasting, meals are only consumed before sunrise and after sunset. There are certain foods that Muslims are not allowed to consume during this time. As Ramadan fast approaches, one of the big questions at the back of the mind of most Muslims is, what can you eat during Ramadan?\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n[What can you eat during Ramadan?](#350825-what-can-you-eat-during-ramadan) [What are you not supposed to eat during Ramadan?](#350825-what-are-you-not-supposed-to-eat-during-ramadan) [What is the best breakfast for Ramadan?](#350825-what-is-the-best-breakfast-for-ramadan) [What is the sunset meal for Ramadan?](#350825-what-is-the-sunset-meal-for-ramadan) [What is a special dish for Ramadan?](#350825-what-is-a-special-dish-for-ramadan) [What are 3 examples of traditional Ramadan foods?](#350825-what-are-3-examples-of-traditional-ramadan-foods) [What to eat before fasting for Ramadan?](#350825-what-to-eat-before-fasting-for-ramadan) [What is allowed and not allowed during Ramadan?](#350825-what-is-allowed-and-not-allowed-during-ramadan)\nRamadan is the holiest month in the Islamic calendar. For the entire\nmonth of Ramadan in Kenya and the rest of the world, Muslims enter a period of spiritual contemplation and reflection on their faith in Allah. In fact, it is one of the Five Pillars of Islam.\nWhat can you eat during Ramadan?\nDuring Ramadan, two main meals are served: suhoor, which is served before dawn, and iftar, which is served after sunset. Suhoor should be a hearty, healthy meal to provide needed energy throughout a day of fasting — it ends when the sun rises and the fajr, or morning prayer, begins.\nAt the end of the day, when the sun sets, the maghrib prayer starts, and the day's fast is broken with iftar. Muslims can continue eating and drinking throughout the night until the next day's suhoor. At the end of the\nRamadan month, Muslims celebrate the Festival of Fast-Breaking, called Eid al-Fitr. Here is how your Ramadan food list should look like.\nRamadan dishes for suhoor\nFor suhoor, you need to begin the day with a simple meal that will give you enough energy to get you through the day and help you endure up to 15 hours. Various delicious and healthy foods can be served during this time. These include:\n- Whole oat pudding: Oats are a great source of fibers, which slows down the release of energy, keeping you full for longer.\n- Protein smoothie: Peanut butter is an excellent source of protein, and it's filled with healthy monounsaturated fat. Bananas are an important source of resistant starch that will help you feel full. Blend milk, yogurt, quick oats, banana, peanut butter, chia seeds, and cocoa powder for a quick protein smoothie.\n- Poached eggs: Eggs are considered a healthy source of protein and Vitamin D. Add it on top of grainy toasts and top it off with sliced tomatoes for added fiber. Eating eggs will leave you feeling full.\n- Fruits and vegetables: They are rich in minerals and vitamins that help one feel energized and stay hydrated. Examples of fruits to be consumed during suhoor include watermelon, strawberries, peaches, oranges, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, spinach, and celery. You can make a salad which will bring together several fruits and vegetables.\n- Nuts: This nature's gift is known to make people full with just a small quantity. If you pair nuts with hot milk, then that would become a wholesome combination because dairy products are also very fulfilling. You can also add nuts to yogurt. If you want to pair it up with bread, then you can use nut butters.\n- Dairy products such as milk and cheese\n- Bread and cereals\n- Ensure that you consume water during suhoor to keep your body hydrated during the day.\nRamadan dishes for iftar\nAre you stuck on what to prepare or eat for the iftar meal? Here is a list of healthy Ramadan fasting Iftar food items:\n- Dates: Muslims break their fast by eating 1 or 3 dates before beginning the iftar meal, as was the practice of Prophet Mohammed, who broke his fast with three dates and water.\n- Soups: They are a very healthy option for starting the Iftar. They play an essential role in replenishing the body fluids and prepare the stomach to receive other foods. Some of the soups to try out include lentil, vegetable, chicken, and vermicelli soups.\n- Juices: After a full day fast, you will need a healthy starter full of vitamins. It is recommended that you consume a glass of refreshing juice, such as orange or carrot juice. The juice should be consumed before or after the meal to replace the fluids lost during the day.\n- Fresh vegetables: As you know, vegetables are a very important source of fibers, vitamins, and minerals needed after a long day without food. These play a critical role in preventing constipation and bloating, which are common problems during fasting. Ensure that the iftar meal is loaded with a rich combination of fresh vegetables.\n- Water: It is important that you drink eight glasses of water during this period to hydrate the body. Ensure that you distribute the water glasses in small quantities between iftar and suhoor to prevent bloating.\n- Main course: At the end of the day, you should gather around the table to eat the delicious main course that includes stews, stuffed vegetables, side dishes, starchy foods, fish and meat dishes, and so on. The main course can also include Ramadan\nspecial dishessuch as chicken kebab, biryani, paya curry, egg fried rice, and so on.\nTraditional Muslim food\nTraditional dishes should be on top of the list of Ramadan food items. The following are some of the traditional iftar and suhoor food items that should be served during Ramadan.\n- Omelet roll\n- Soothing porridge\n- Rice pudding\n- Bean breakfast spread\n- Fish stew\n- Moroccan lentil soup\n- Chicken biryani\nWhat are you not supposed to eat during Ramadan?\nThe discussion of food for Ramadan also includes those food items that should not be eaten during this time. It is advisable that you avoid or\nlimit the intake of these foods during Ramadan:\n- Avoid fried and fatty foods, which contain a high percentage of the daily recommended fat and sodium intake, such as chips and samosa. Frequent consumption of these foods increases fatigue and exhaustion.\n- Avoid those foods that contain high amounts of salt. Sodium can dehydrate the body and affect its ability to absorb fluids.\n- Avoid foods that contain large amounts of sugar. These foods are often high in calories but poor in nutritional value. Even though these foods provide the body with instant energy, the energy is generally short-lived.\n- Stay away from foods that contain chocolate or any other source of caffeine. Caffeine is a diuretic and can cause the body to lose fluids, salts, and other important minerals needed during the day.\nWhat is the best breakfast for Ramadan?\nDates are the best breakfast snack you can take. They are a traditional way to break the fast and are a great source of natural sugars, fiber, and essential nutrients. They will give you a quick energy boost.\nWhat is the sunset meal for Ramadan?\nThe sunset meal for Ramadan is called Iftar. It is a very important meal, both physically and culturally, as it breaks the day's fast.\nWhat is a special dish for Ramadan?\nSome special dishes for Ramadan vary greatly across the regions celebrating Ramadan. Some people opt for sweet or savory pastries and soups.\nWhat are 3 examples of traditional Ramadan foods?\nPrimary traditional Ramadan foods include omelette rolls, soothing porridge and chicken biryani.\nWhat to eat before fasting for Ramadan?\nSuhoor, the pre-dawn meal before a day of fasting\nduring Ramadan, is an important meal to fuel your body for the day ahead.\nWhat is allowed and not allowed during Ramadan?\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn until sunset, refraining from eating, drinking, smoking, and engaging in sexual activity. You can maintain good Ramadan health tips by practicing proper hygiene, praying, doing charity work, and doing good deeds.\nWhat can you eat during Ramadan? The above list of food items that can be taken during this period should serve as a guide. Food eaten before fasting will ensure that you have enough energy to last you throughout the day. To maintain a balanced and nutritious diet, ensure you consume food from all the major food groups equally distributed between the two meal times.\nTuko.co.ke shared 100+ awesome\nprofile pic comments for Facebook.

The Wildcats reached 10 wins in a season for the fourth time in school history.\nOklahoma true freshman quarterback Jackson Arnold, making his first start in the wake of Dillon Gabriel’s transfer, passed for 361 yards and two touchdowns. However, he was intercepted three times and lost a late fumble on a sack after the Wildcats took a 31-24 lead with 5:28 left on Cowing’s touchdown.\nArizona then added a 19-yard touchdown run by DJ Williams, ending the game by scoring 25 unanswered points in the final 15:02.\nOklahoma had roared back from a 13-0, first-half deficit and was up 24-13 when momentum changed quickly.\nDalton Johnson popped the ball out of the hands of receiver Jalil Farooq, and Maldonado grabbed it and raced down the left sideline for his 87-yard fumble return.\nMartell Irby intercepted Arnold on the next play from scrimmage, setting up Arizona at the Oklahoma 11. The Sooners defense stiffened, though, forcing the Wildcats into a game-tying, 37-yard field goal.\nWhen the Wildcats got the ball back after a punt, they drove 95 yards, capped by Fifita’s scramble and TD pass to Cowing. Cowing caught seven passes for 152 yards and two touchdowns. Teammate Tetairoa McMillan made 10 receptions for 160 yards.\nArnold completed 26 of 45 passes. Oklahoma outgained Arizona 562-383 but was undone by the six turnovers, which led to 28 points.\n–Field Level Media",

    "text": "When Wayne Lane finally returned home, the challenges ahead felt nearly insurmountable. Needing time to mentally heal from eighteen years in a Louisiana prison but also a stable, immediate income, Lane faced an uphill battle. “Trying to transition from incarceration to society is no easy task,” he says. “It takes faith and discipline.” Back in Boston, Lane obtained his Commercial Driver’s License, or CDL, ushering in a career that has given him the security he’s strived for. Now, Lane is a homeowner, has completed his parole, and is hoping to help others in his position by starting his own business: Switching Lanes with Wayne, a course for people transitioning out of incarceration to help them obtain their own CDLs. A new collaboration between Harvard Law School’s Transactional Law Clinics, First Step Alliance, and the City of Boston is working to give returning citizens like Lane a pathway to financial stability. The [Fresh Start Entrepreneurship & Financial Capabilities Program](https://www.firststepalliance.org/fresh-start-business) [offers] returning citizens the education, mentoring, and legal assistance they need to start and run their own business. The initiative brings together entrepreneurship and money management training, providing comprehensive preparation for becoming a business owner. Lane joined the program last spring to learn the ins and outs of how to get Switching Lanes with Wayne off the ground. “The Fresh Start Program helped me out in ways you couldn’t imagine,” he says. Supporting financial stability and self-sufficiency “This kind of training program helps people who are at the very beginning of dreaming about their business,” says [Carmen Halford](https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/carmen-halford/), lecturer at law and clinical instructor at Harvard Law. “They’re just starting to figure out, how do I do this on a larger scale? How do I make this a sustainable income source for myself?” “Becoming a business owner isn’t just about financial stability; it’s about regaining control and creating something of your own,” adds Nancy Eiden, creator of the Fresh Start Entrepreneurship Program and founder of [First Step Alliance](https://www.firststepalliance.org/), a nonprofit dedicated to bringing financial education and access to banking services to returning citizens. “Our Fresh Start Entrepreneurship Program helps people transform their dream of business ownership into reality. Whether it’s learning how to create a business plan or understanding important personal finance concepts, such as budgeting and credit building, we provide the resources and support people need to create a path forward.” Dreaming after incarceration can be difficult, says Lane. As an activist advocating for returning citizens, he felt called to turn his experience into an education for people facing the challenges he once overcame. “My vision widened, and I decided I wanted to open a CDL driving school. Fresh Start helped me put that business plan into action.” For individuals returning to society after incarceration, a steady income can feel far out of reach. Little social support exists for returning citizens, while there are an increasing number of barriers to successful reentry; even the luckiest of returning citizens can face challenges securing housing and addressing employment discrimination, mental health, a lack of credit, and often a drastically altered social network than the one they left behind. Being a business owner can provide crucial stability, income, and opportunities. About 3,000 individuals return to Boston after incarceration each year. At the Transactional Law Clinics, Halford wanted to find more ways to bring the clinic’s expertise to this population. “We want to make sure that the projects we’re taking on are working to build a more sustainable and equitable community here in Cambridge, in Boston, in Massachusetts,” she says. The clinics’ involvement in the Fresh Start Entrepreneurship Program stems from a broader mission to promote economic justice. Halford elaborates, “We see the role of a transactional attorney as not just making deals and moving money around, but to actually build wealth in communities that face systemic obstacles to growing it.” Inspired by the Fresh Start Entrepreneurship Program, Halford is teaching a reading group this fall titled Second Chance Entrepreneurship, drawing on experiences working with returning citizens. The program’s development began with conversations between Halford and Eiden: “We were talking about how there’s a lot of overlap in our missions, and entrepreneurship was a natural area where we felt like we could collaborate,” Halford says. Recognizing the complexity of starting a business, the two sought to create a comprehensive support system — covering everything from guidance on how to write a business plan to explaining the pros and cons between an LLC and a corporation. “At First Step Alliance, we understand that financial stability and self-sufficiency are key to successful reentry, yet returning citizens often face systemic discrimination and can be completely shut out of mainstream banking and meaningful employment opportunities,” explains Eiden. “Through our Fresh Start Programs and proposed new credit union initiative, we’re working to bridge this gap, helping returning citizens create an alternative path to income and wealth creation through business ownership, as well as improving access to affordable financial services.” The program brought in additional partners, including [Reentry Survivors](https://www.reentrysurvivors.com/), an organization that provides individuals returning from the justice system with skills for a successful reintegration into society. The Boston Public Library joined in to provide Chromebooks to each program participant in exchange for signing up for a library card. Boston calling The [Boston Mayor’s Office of Returning Citizens](https://www.boston.gov/departments/returning-citizens) has also been an instrumental collaborator, providing crucial funding, outreach, and support, including $500 grants to each participant as starting capital. Ashley Montgomery, its executive director, says that the partnership was a natural fit. “A lot of our clients want to go into entrepreneurship for a multitude of reasons, and we wanted to provide a resource to clients interested in starting their own businesses,” she explains. Rechelle Hypolite, the office’s director of programming and strategic initiatives, adds, “For our clients to have a direct pipeline of folks that can really support them and tell them, ‘Hey, either I’ve done this before, or I’ve seen this before and know this process, and I can help you along the way,’ that’s really important.” The program addresses several critical barriers faced by returning citizens, particularly in areas of employment and housing. Hypolite says that it is difficult for people with low credit scores to find a place to live. “Having access to programs and support like Fresh Start and other initiatives through our office allows people to access opportunities that will really stabilize their lives,” she says. The Fresh Start Program’s structure includes business skills trainings, money management trainings, and legal presentations over the course of six ninety-minute sessions. This spring was the program’s pilot year and included a legal presentation by students from Harvard’s Transactional Law Clinics. Looking ahead, the program’s organizers are exploring ways to expand its reach and impact, and a second, shorter version of the program is starting up later this month. Halford is contemplating plans for future in-person legal training sessions, potentially including student involvement in intake processes to help program participants become clients. For future cohorts, First Step Alliance aspires to offer small loans to program graduates to help kick start their businesses, and build their credit histories, but that is contingent on fundraising. Harvard Law students on the vanguard As students in the clinics, Ian Malesiewski ’25 and Nicky Yoon ’25 worked with Halford to interview returning citizen entrepreneurs and to solicit their feedback; to create a presentation explaining legal considerations for starting a business; and to facilitate a Q&A session with attorneys. “I learned the extent of the structural barriers that returning citizens face when it comes to entrepreneurship,” reflects Yoon. “As such, our work felt especially pressing and significant, as one of those barriers is a lack of access to knowledge, whether legal, financial, or otherwise. The existence of the Fresh Start Entrepreneurship Program was an encouraging indication of societal efforts to empower returning citizens, and I hope the program continues to grow.” “Throughout the project, it became evident that most of the individuals in the cohort were starting from scratch and didn’t have a lot of support with starting their businesses,” adds Malesiewski. “It was extremely rewarding to help bridge this information divide and help provide them with information they needed to earn a living.” Switching Lanes with Wayne For Lane, the Fresh Start Entrepreneurship Program provided more than just business skills. “It gave me a lot of confidence, for one,” he explains. “It helped me with the beginning stages of my business, and being able to interact with other students allowed me to get comfortable doing presentations and put my business plan in place.” Other classmates also had business ideas aiming to help returning citizens get back on their feet, and Lane plans to continue collaborating with them in the future. Already, the program is building momentum. “In the next cohort coming up, we’ve literally doubled our numbers since the last time we sent out the flyers,” says Hypolite. “One of my former clients had heard about the program through friends, and he is finally able to join this fall and is so excited. There’s a real sense of community building around it.” The collaboration demonstrates the potential for innovative partnerships in addressing a shared goal: economic empowerment for returning citizens. By combining legal expertise, business training, and government support, the program is creating new pathways for returning citizens to rebuild their lives and contribute to their communities. Lane’s advice to other returning citizens considering entrepreneurship reflects the program’s ethos. “Just continue that faith, make sure you have the necessary discipline in your life, and continue to stay focused,” he says.

    "text": "Melissa Velásquez Loaiza\n(CNN) — La familia de un anciano indonesio fallecido durante el Hajj de este año se alegra de que fuera enterrado en la ciudad santa de La Meca, según declaró su hija, mientras la nación del sudeste asiático llora a cientos de sus ciudadanos que perecieron bajo un calor extremo durante la peregrinación islámica anual.\nMás de 1.300 personas murieron en el Hach de este año, con “numerosos casos” debidos al estrés térmico, según las autoridades saudíes, después de que más de 1,8 millones de peregrinos participaran a pesar de que las temperaturas se dispararon hasta niveles peligrosos. Las autoridades de Indonesia, el país de mayoría musulmana más poblado del mundo, dijeron que al menos 215 indonesios se encuentran entre los fallecidos.\nEn declaraciones a CNN este domingo, Heru Jumartiyah dijo que su padre de 86 años, Ngatijo Wongso Sentono, murió el 17 de junio en su tienda de campaña en Mina, al sureste de La Meca, mientras esperaba las oraciones del mediodía.\n“Estaba dormido y antes no tenía síntomas de enfermedad. Todo el mundo decía que estaba sano durante la procesión del Hach”, declaró.\nSentono se había inscrito para la peregrinación en 2018 y viajó a La Meca con su esposa de 83 años y vecinos de la ciudad indonesia de Yogyakarta, dijo Jumartiyah.\n“Mi padre estaba muy entusiasmado con la idea de ir al Hach. Quería irse inmediatamente”, dijo.\nDecenas de peregrinos del Hajj mueren mientras las temperaturas en La Meca alcanzan los 49 ºC\nPeregrinaje mortal en La Meca debido al calor extremo 2:04\nRealizar el peregrinaje a La Meca es uno de los cinco pilares del Islam, que exige a todo musulmán que esté en condiciones físicas y económicas de realizar el viaje a la ciudad santa de La Meca al menos una vez en su vida.\nSegún la creencia islámica, morir y ser enterrado en La Meca se considera una bendición, y muchos musulmanes viajan en su vejez tras haber ahorrado durante muchos años para realizar la peregrinación.\n“Nos alegramos de que fuera enterrado en La Meca”, declaró Jumartiyah, y añadió que esperaba visitar la tumba de su padre cuando finalmente hiciera la peregrinación.\nJumartiyah dijo que su madre, Pariyem Prawirodinomo, está sana y que regresará a Indonesia el 7 de julio.\nUnos 241.000 peregrinos indonesios tenían previsto realizar el viaje a La Meca este año, según las autoridades indonesias, la mayor cuota de la historia del país.\nSegún datos del Ministerio indonesio de Asuntos Religiosos, la mayoría de los indonesios que murieron en la peregrinación de este año eran mayores de 50 años.\nNo es raro que Indonesia registre cientos de muertes durante el Hajj de cada año: el año pasado, 773 personas murieron durante la peregrinación, según los registros del ministerio.\n“Ahorraron toda su vida para esto”: la angustia de una estadounidense cuyos padres murieron durante la peregrinación a La Meca\n“He visto morir a muchos peregrinos”\nEl calor extremo se ha señalado como uno de los principales factores de los cientos de muertos y heridos registrados este año durante el peregrinaje. La Meca, la ciudad santa central para los peregrinos del Hach, registró este lunes temperaturas récord de 51 grados centígrados.\nDiversas autoridades han señalado también que los problemas se han agravado por el número de peregrinaciones no oficiales, y el gobierno saudí dijo este domingo que los viajes “no autorizados” eran responsables de más de cuatro de cada cinco de las víctimas mortales.\nArabia Saudí exige que cada peregrino adquiera una de las 1,8 millones de licencias disponibles para acceder legalmente a La Meca. Estas licencias pueden costar varios miles de dólares estadounidenses. Los peregrinos sin licencia no suelen viajar en autobuses turísticos organizados con aire acondicionado o fácil acceso a suministros de agua y alimentos.\nComo parte de la peregrinación, los fieles realizan una serie de rituales en la ciudad santa de La Meca y sus alrededores, que a menudo implican muchas horas de caminata diaria bajo un calor abrasador.\nAlgunos peregrinos han lamentado la deficiente infraestructura y organización del Hajj de este año. Incluso los peregrinos de los viajes oficiales pasan la mayor parte del día caminando al aire libre bajo el calor.\nSeis peregrinos del Hajj mueren por insolación en La Meca tras advertencia de temperaturas cercanas a los 48 grados Celsius\nVideo relacionado: Fotografía inédita de la piedra ancestral de La Meca 1:13\nAlgunos testigos han relatado a CNN cómo vieron a fieles perder el conocimiento y pasar junto a cadáveres cubiertos de telas blancas.\nUn indonesio de 44 años, que solo quiso que se le llamara Ahmad, recordó haber visto a muchos moribundos por el calor.\n“De camino a casa, vi morir a muchos peregrinos. Casi cada pocos cientos de metros, había un cuerpo tendido y cubierto con una tela ihrom (tela blanca)”.\n“Cada vez que hay una distribución de agua por parte de los residentes locales o de ciertos grupos, es inmediatamente invadida por los peregrinos”, añadió, diciendo que no vio personal sanitario ni una sola ambulancia a lo largo del camino.\nEn las últimas décadas, el gran tamaño de las multitudes del Hach ha sido un factor en varios incidentes mortales durante la peregrinación, incluida una estampida que mató a cientos de personas en 2015.\nSin embargo, los expertos advirtieron de que el aumento de las temperaturas supone la amenaza más mortífera para los peregrinos, ya que los récords de calor caen en Medio Oriente —una de las regiones más vulnerables a la crisis climática—, lo que hace más arriesgadas las concentraciones masivas.\nEl climatólogo e historiador del tiempo Maximiliano Herrera, que hace un seguimiento de las temperaturas extremas, declaró a CNN que los desiertos de la región “se calentaban por la noche mucho más rápido que durante el día”, lo que se suponía que proporcionaba un respiro y alivio del calor. “Esto no existía hasta hace un par de décadas”, dijo Herrera.\n“A todo el mundo le afecta el calor mortal y, lamentablemente, no me sorprende el número de muertos (en el Hajj)”, añadió.\n“Pasar tiempo al aire libre en el calor extremo de La Meca es arriesgarse a morir… así que me temo que habrá más peregrinaciones mortales del Hach en el futuro”.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "A Light vem desenvolvendo um projeto que utiliza tecnologia para reduzir os acidentes de eletrocussão envolvendo animais silvestres nas áreas urbanas aqui do Rio. Apelidado de Conexão Selvagem, o projeto foi lançado oficialmente nesta quarta (02/03). O objetivo é mapear regiões mais vulneráveis e implementar medidas preventivas na rede elétrica para proteger a fauna local.\nEm parceria com o Instituto Vida Livre e a Concert Lab, e com apoio da Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (Aneel), o plano conta com um investimento de R$ 3,1 milhões. Utilizando Inteligência Artificial (IA), a iniciativa vai monitorar o comportamento dos animais, identificar os pontos de risco e propor melhorias na infraestrutura elétrica. Além disso, uma plataforma digital que analisará os dados coletados, ajudando a identificar os pontos mais críticos e a priorizar as ações de adaptação da rede elétrica.\nInicialmente, o projeto está sendo realizado em áreas com grande biodiversidade, como os bairros do Jardim Botânico, Recreio dos Bandeirantes e as Vargens. “Escolhemos essas regiões iniciais pelas características de vegetação e biodiversidade, repleta de árvores e animais silvestres que habitam ali. Através de câmeras e de tecnologia de ponta, faremos o monitoramento dessas espécies. Estamos dando um passo importante junto com nossos parceiros para minimizar os acidentes causados pelo contato dos animais com a rede elétrica, reforçando o compromisso da Light com a biodiversidade do Rio.”, explica Felipe Cruz, gerente de Meio Ambiente da Light.\nO projeto já contemplou a criação de relatórios para iniciar suas ações em campo, além da definição da área de atuação. Também já realizou o planejamento e a instalação dos equipamentos fotográficos e sensores nos pontos estratégicos para obtenção dos dados.\nAtualmente o Conexão Silvestre está em fase de desenvolvimento da solução da web, o que significa que estão sendo realizadas a estruturação e análise dos dados de ocorrências na rede elétrica da Light, obtendo dos dados geográficos e comportamentais, além de informações sobre relevo, clima e avistamento de animais nas regiões indicadas. Com base nessas informações, será feito o desenho inicial da ferramenta.",
