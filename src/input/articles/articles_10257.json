    "text": "Enugu State governor, Peter Mbah, has reiterated his administration’s commitment to making the state an agricultural hub for investors. He made this known while unveiling the Enugu rice at the Ministry of Agriculture and Agro Industrialisation complex in Enugu on Thursday. The governor, represented by his deputy, Ifeanyi Ossai, commended the Commissioner for Agriculture and Agro Industrialisation, Patrick Ubru, for the efforts in making the event a reality. He said, “I am impressed by what I see today, it is encouraging, I commend the farmers of Enugu State and with your synergy, support and cooperation to Enugu State Government, production of rice will continue to increase for the benefit of all. This is the development we have been craving for as well as the growth we are praying for. Indeed, our tomorrow is here.” He enjoined staff of the ministry to be dedicated to their duties and give maximum support to the commissioner so that the ministry could achieve the mandate and vision of the state for agriculture. Mbah noted that the Enugu rice brand would grow bigger than what it was known for, stressing that the state would soon be known as a rice producing state. He explained that Enugu was now an oil producing state and also doing well i the agricultural sector, saying, “This will help to reduce hunger to zero by 2031.’’ Earlier, Mr Ubru had commended the governor for his commitment to the rebirth and development of the sector. He stated that the occasion was a testament to their collective efforts in promoting and emphasising the authenticity and originality of the Enugu rice brand. The commissioner stressed that it offered the state an opportunity to showcase the exceptional quality of its locally produced rice and to celebrate the hard work of the farmers. He maintained that the launch was promoting the brand, its originality and also ensuring that farmers had the opportunity to make substantial sales to increase their income. He said that the rice would be sold at the most affordable prices to make the rice accessible to all, to improve their livelihoods and boost their local economy. Ubru noted that the state government had directed his ministry to ensure the establishment of more rice mills across the LGAs with comparative advantage in rice production. “These mills will revolutionise rice processing in our state and also enhance our self-sufficiency and economic growth,’’ he added. He said this would be achieved through the land space of over 50,000 hectares of rice fields in different locations at Idodo-Owo-Ubagu-Amankanu-Nkerefi-Nara- Ugboka rice fields in Nkanu East LGA.He stated, “Others are Ibiteolo-Mgbagbu Owa rice fields in Ezeagu LGA,Oduma-Nenwe-Okpanku rice fields in Aninri LGA,Adani-Okoro-Ogurugu- Asaba rice fields in Uzo-Uwani LGA and rice fields in Isi-Uzo LGA. He added that Mbah’s vision was to feed Enugu people and make the state the food basket of the nation as demonstrated with the payment of counterpart funds for the donor agricultural-assisted projects. These include the payment of seven years arrears for Agricultural Transformation Agenda Support Program phase -1, the initial payment for the new Livestock Productivity and Resilience Support Project. The three years payment for IFAD assisted Value Chain Development Programme is also part of the payments. The state programme coordinator of IFAD-VCOP, Dr Edward Isiwu, stated that some farmers in Abakaliki went to Nara, Nkerefi, Nomeh and Ubahu to cultivate rice on leased land which they sold as Abakaliki rice. He appealed to the state government to provide them with some land to cultivate rice and help in increasing the production of the grain in the state. 0 Comments [cancel reply](/news/enugu-ready-to-become-agric-hub-for-investors-says-mbah/#respond) You must be logged in to post a comment.

Chris Olave made one of the plays of the day on this juggling touchdown catch against the Atlanta Falcons — somehow keeping his balance while sprinting into the end zone and tracking the football as it deflected from one hand to another.\nBut the New Orleans Saints’ star wideout secured the catch to score a go-ahead touchdown. It’s taken some time for Olave to get in sync with his new quarterback Derek Carr, but he’s finished the year strong and is consistently coming through with tough catches when the team needs them.\nAnd he’s still developing. Olave has made strides this year in fighting for contested catches and running for more yards after the catch. If he can take another step forward in 2024, there’s no telling how high his ceiling might be.\nArticles Dennis Allen had the least-respectable response to Arthur Smith's complaint Falcons head coach Arthur Smith unamused by Saints running up the score Bucs win the NFC South, here's how Saints can reach playoffs WATCH: Alontae Taylor comes in off the bench for his second career interception",

    "text": "La Cour nationale du droit d’asile (CNDA) a rendu ce 11 juillet 2024, un arrêt stipulant que « l’ensemble des femmes afghanes » ont vocation à obtenir le statut de réfugiées en raison de leur genre. [Société](https://www.humanite.fr/sections/societe) Pour la première fois en droit français, le genre féminin est reconnu comme ouvrant, en tant que tel, la possibilité d’ [obtenir la protection asilaire en France](https://www.humanite.fr/monde/afghanistan/les-femmes-afghanes-considerees-comme-refugiees-admet-la-cour-du-droit-dasile). C’est le sens de la décision rendue ce 11 juillet par la Cour Nationale du droit d’Asile (CNDA), accordant le statut de réfugiées aux Afghanes en raison des persécutions faites aux femmes dans leur pays [depuis que les talibans y ont pris le pouvoir en 2021](https://www.humanite.fr/monde/afghanistan/deux-ans-apres-cest-une-vie-sans-vie-pour-les-afghanes). Réunie en Grande formation, la cour a constaté que « les autorités afghanes ont porté atteinte, depuis leur arrivée au pouvoir le 15 août 2021, aux droits et libertés fondamentaux des femmes et des jeunes filles afghanes, notamment en les excluant du gouvernement provisoire, en supprimant les institutions et mécanismes de promotion de l’égalité de genre et de protection contre les violences basées sur le genre ainsi qu’en remettant en cause leur droit à la santé, à l’éducation et leur liberté d’aller et venir ». Pour cela, elle s’est appuyée sur la documentation publique disponible, notamment les rapports du Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies aux droits de l’homme du 20 juin 2023 et du rapporteur spécial des Nations Unies des 1er septembre 2023 et 13 mai 2024 ainsi que la note d’orientation pour l’Afghanistan de l’agence de l’Union européenne pour l’asile. Le genre comme un « groupe social » En France, le droit d’asile repose en premier lieu sur la Convention de Genève de 1951 relative au statut des réfugiés. L’article 1 de ce texte international dispose que « le terme ‘réfugié’ s’appliquera à toute personne (…) craignant avec raison d’être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un certain groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques ». Jusqu’alors, même si la CNDA reconnaissait déjà l’existence d’un « groupe social » dans le cas des homosexuels dans certains pays (Mali, Tunisie, Égypte…), des femmes voulant se soustraire à un mariage forcé (Mali, Mauritanie, Guinée, Burkina Faso…) ou encore à celles risquant l’excision (Égypte, Cameroun…), aucun « groupe social des femmes » n’était reconnu. Au-delà du fait d’être de sexe féminin, l’identification du groupe social nécessite que les femmes soient perçues de manière différente par la société environnante et qu’elles se voient reconnaître une identité propre dans cette société, en raison notamment de normes sociales, morales ou juridiques ayant cours dans leur pays d’origine. C’est désormais le cas puisque la Cour a jugé qu’il résulte de l’ensemble de normes juridiques et sociales qu’elles ont à subir que « les femmes et jeunes filles afghanes sont, dans leur ensemble, perçues d’une manière différente par la société afghane et qu’elles doivent être considérées comme appartenant à un groupe social susceptible d’être protégé comme réfugié ». Un tournant jurisprudentiel inspiré d’une décision européenne « Cela va uniformiser la jurisprudence pour les années à venir, car les décisions de la Cour en grande formation s’imposent à toutes les formations de jugement et à l’ [Office français de protection des réfugiés et apatrides](https://www.humanite.fr/social-et-economie/droit-dasile/immigration-les-agents-de-lofpra-en-greve-contre-la-politique-du-chiffre) (Ofpra) », explique-t-on à la CNDA. Déjà, le 16 janvier 2024, la Cour de Justice de l’Union européenne avait ouvert la voie en janvier à une telle décision dans un arrêt qui précisait que : « Les femmes, dans leur ensemble, peuvent être regardées comme appartenant à un « groupe social » et prétendre ainsi au statut de réfugié si dans leur pays d’origine elles sont exposées, en raison de leur sexe, à des violences physiques ou mentales, y compris des violences sexuelles et domestiques ». Cette décision constitue un salutaire retour de balancier. En effet, au lendemain même de l [a prise du pouvoir par les talibans début août 2021](https://www.humanite.fr/monde/afghanistan/en-afghanistan-les-talibans-ont-mis-en-place-un-apartheid-genre-contre-les-femmes-selon-lonu-799703), la CNDA avait placé « en délibéré prolongé » les demandes d’asile en cours des ressortissants afghans. Puis, le 27 août, le Centre de recherche et de documentation de la CNDA préconisait tout simplement « une diminution de la protection des Afghanes et des Afghans au motif d’une « cessation du conflit armé ayant opposé les talibans au gouvernement du président Ashraf Ghani ». Ce qui signifiait que tous ceux et toutes celles qui ne pouvaient prouver des craintes personnelles de persécution leur permettant d’être reconnus comme réfugiés sur le fondement de la Convention de Genève et qui craignaient « seulement » pour leur vie ou leur intégrité physique en raison de combats entraînant une « violence aveugle » verraient leur demande de protection rejetée. Malgré cela, l’Afghanistan est demeuré, pour la sixième année consécutive, le premier pays de provenance des demandeurs d’asile en France, avec plus de 17 500 premières demandes introduites et 90 % des demandes de protection aboutissent favorablement. Néanmoins jusqu’alors, cette protection concerne majoritairement des hommes, qui représentent plus des deux tiers des ressortissants afghans réfugiés en France. C’est pour cela qu’Amnesty International demande à la France de faciliter la délivrance de visas aux femmes afghanes en exil. « Cette décision de la CNDA rappelle l’importance pour les autorités françaises de tenir leur promesse renouvelée à plusieurs reprises de rester aux côtés des femmes et des filles afghanes. Les rares femmes afghanes qui réussissent à fuir dans les pays voisins font face à des arrestations arbitraires, du harcèlement et le risque d’être renvoyées en Afghanistan », rappelle l’ONG dans un communiqué. La Pakistanaise Malala Yousafzai, a de son coté appelé vendredi 12 juin, le Pakistan, dans une interview à l’AFP, à abandonner sa politique d’expulsion des Afghans sans papiers, afin notamment de protéger les femmes et les filles face aux talibans. « Il est très inquiétant que le Pakistan force les réfugiés afghans à retourner en Afghanistan. Je suis très inquiète pour les femmes et les filles », a déclaré vendredi cette femme de 27 ans, qui a reçu le prix Nobel de la paix en 2014 pour son combat pour le droit des filles à l’éducation. Or, malgré les promesse d’Emmanuel Macron de « ne pas abandonner les femmes et les filles afghanes » les visas permettant de rejoindre la France à partir de l‘Iran et du Pakistan sont délivrés au compte-goutte et les délais pour obtenir un rendez-vous dans les consulats ne cessent de s’allonger. L’enjeu principal, pour les femmes afghanes qui cherchent protection, est donc de pouvoir se rendre en France par des voies légales et sûres. Avant de partir, une dernière chose… Contrairement à 90% des médias français aujourd’hui, l’Humanité ne dépend ni de grands groupes ni de milliardaires. Cela signifie que : - nous vous apportons des informations impartiales, sans compromis. Mais aussi que - nous n’avons pas les moyens financiers dont bénéficient les autres médias.

    "text": "On the heels of its most successful regular season in franchise history, The Detroit Lions are gearing up for their first playoff game on Jan. 18, 2025, against the Washington Commanders.\nAnd when they take the field Saturday evening at Ford Field, they will have the full backing of Saints Nation.\nThe St. Clair College Centre for the Arts and the College's Main South Campus will be splashed with a Honolulu blue hue starting on Thursday, Jan. 16, as a show of support for the surging Lions as the team begins its quest for its first-ever Super Bowl title.\n\"Saints Nation stands with the Detroit Lions as they embark on what we all hope will be a deep push into the playoffs,\" said St. Clair College President, Michael Silvaggi. \"We know firsthand how much it meant to our Saints Football team when fans and the community rallied behind our eventual National Champions.\"\n\"We want the Lions to feel that same love from the Windsor-Essex community and hopefully, get the same results.\"\nCaesars Windsor, businesses throughout Windsor-Essex, and the City of Windsor are also showing their pride for 'The Pride' by casting blue light onto their respective buildings.\nStaff and students are also encouraged to get into the playoff spirit by donning their favourite Lions swag and colours to school on Friday, Jan. 17. And hopefully, that Friday tradition will continue as the Lions stalk their prey en route to the Vince Lombardi Trophy.\nGo Lions!",
