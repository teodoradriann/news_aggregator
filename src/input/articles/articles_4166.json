His visit, showcasing his affinity with Tamil culture, included prayers and blessings for prosperity and happiness. Party leaders expressed their support for his cultural engagement. [PTI](/pti-stories)| Pudukottai(Tn) | Updated: 30-05-2024 22:42 IST | Created: 30-05-2024 22:42 IST - Country: - India Union Home Minister Amit Shah offered prayers at the Kottai Bhairavar temple at Tirumayam here on Thursday. He was accompanied by his wife Sonal Shah to the roadside temple for the darshan and puja. Priests at the temple welcomed the couple with shawls and garlands. \"Prayed at the Kottai Bhairavar Temple in Pudukkottai, Tamil Nadu. Sought blessings for the happiness and prosperity of all,\" the minister later said in a post on social media platform X. He posted photos of his darshan in the temple. Shah's visit, which was earlier scheduled for April, exemplifies how he closely associated himself with Tamil culture and practices, BJP state chief K Annamalai said about the tour. Located on the northern side of the Archaeological Survey of India-managed fort's outer walls, the Kottai Bhairavar temple is dedicated to Bhairavar, an aspect of Lord Siva. Besides Annamalai, party seniors, including H Raja, were among those who received Shah upon his arrival here by road from the Tiruchirappalli airport. The minister later left for Tirupati. ''On April 12, during the election campaign in TN, our Hon HM had to visit this temple but it was cancelled unfortunately due to adverse flying conditions,'' Annamalai said in a post on X. However, the union minister resolved that he would visit the temple and seek the blessings of Bhairavar before the end of the elections, he said. ''His visit today exemplifies how he closely associates himself with our Tamil culture & practices,'' Annamalai said. He too posted photos of Shah's trip. Shah visited the Sathya Giriswarar temple at Tirumayam, too. ''It was a profoundly fulfilling experience to offer pooja at the Sri Sathyagiri Natha Perumal temple in Pudukkottai, Tamil Nadu, today. May the Bhagwan Vishnu guide our way to fulfilling the aspirations of the nation,'' Shah said in another social media post. After offering prayers at the Sri Arulmigu Rajarajeswari Udanurai Satyagireeswarar Sivan temple in Pudukkottai, the minister said. Although he was scheduled to visit the sacred temples in Tamil Nadu on April 12, the programme was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions. ''May the Almighty bestow good health and happiness on all,'' he said. (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

    "title": "Robert Garcia wants ‘legend’ Nonito Donaire to retire",
    "text": "Nonito Donaire may be a boxing icon and future hall of famer but he should consider hanging up the gloves — according to his trainer Robert Garcia Donaire (42-8, 28 KOs) recorded consecutive defeats, by the great Naoya Inoue, and then by Alexandro Santiago in July 2023. Yet the “Filipino Flash” aged 41 he plans to fight on, and has targeted a showdown against the similarly great Roman “Chocolatito” Gonzalez. His trainer, regardless, believes it may be time for him to quit. “Nonito Donaire is already a hall of famer,” Garcia told BoxingScene. “He’s a four-division world champion and he’s fought great fighters. He challenged himself against some of the great fighters in the world so he doesn’t need to prove anything else to himself.” Donaire is one of the greatest fighters of the modern era – one who captured world titles in four weight divisions. Many thought his career was nearing its end in 2014 when Nicholas Walters took the WBA featherweight title away by stoppage him. Two years later Donaire lost a unanimous decision to Jessie Magdaleno, and to Carl Frampton in 2018. A return to bantamweight then reignited his career. He defied expectations to be competitive against the great Inoue in a unanimous decision defeat in 2019, and in June 2021 he captured the WBC 118lbs title with a fourth-round knockout of Nordine Oubaali. Another fourth-round knockout, of Reymart Gaballo in December 2021, set the stage for a rematch with Inoue in June 2022 in Inoue’s native Japan, when “The Monster” stopped him in two rounds. If there is no shame in losing to Inoue, the loss to Santiago came as a surprise. “He’s a legend and has accomplished a lot in his career so he doesn’t need to prove nobody anything,” Garcia said. “I would like to see him say that he’s retired but from what I understand, he might want to fight a few times more. “I think he still has a little bit left but as a warrior – as a legend that he already is – he doesn’t need to prove nothing to anybody. “He could retire and everybody would be happy. It’s up to him. He’s still healthy and talented enough to compete but me personally – I would like to see him retire. Yeah, I would love to see him just retire, enjoy life, enjoy his family, wife and kids.” Bernard Neequaye is a sports journalist with a specialty in boxing coverage.

    "text": "Filho de John Lennon é diagnosticado com câncer e passa por cirurgia de emergência 19/12/2024 18h51\nJulian Lennon, filho de John Lennon, usou suas redes sociais para contar que descobriu um câncer de pele. Na publicação feita na última quarta-feira, 18, o cantor e compositor explicou que passou por uma cirurgia para retirar um melanoma, tumor na pele que deixa uma cor escura na região em que se encontra.\nEle já havia enfrentado um câncer de pele alguns anos atrás. Em seu relato, Julian disse que viajou a Los Angeles, nos Estados Unidos, a trabalho e aproveitou para se consultar com o oncologista que o atendeu da primeira vez. \"Foi ele que diagnosticou e operou meu câncer de pele e, literalmente, salvou minha vida, escreveu.\nApós sair de uma entrevista, o músico recebeu uma ligação urgente do médico. \"Tinha sinais de câncer de pele em dois locais, no meu ombro e no antebraço, um deles era um melanoma e precisava ser operado o mais rápido possível.\"\nEle garantiu que a cirurgia foi um sucesso, mas que ainda espera o resultado da biópsia, que pode ser disponibilizado até o Natal. \"Em vez de ir para casa montar minha árvore de Natal e terminar o ano tranquilamente relaxando em casa, voei de volta para Los Angeles e passei por uma cirurgia na qual passaram horas me operando e limpando a região\", disse.",

    "text": "PUBBLICITÀ Circa 33mila lavoratori della Boeing hanno deposto gli strumenti di lavoro a partire dalla mezzanotte di venerdì, dopo aver votato per lo sciopero .\nL'azione è un nuovo colpo per il colosso costruttore di aerei, che nell'ultimo periodo sta affrontando sfide finanziarie e di reputazione.\nL'Associazione internazionale dei macchinisti e dei lavoratori aerospaziali ha dichiarato che i suoi membri hanno respinto un contratto che avrebbe aumentato le retribuzioni del 25 per cento in quattro anni.\nIl sindacato ha aggiunto che il 94,6 per cento ha votato a favore del rifiuto del contratto, mentre il 96 per cento ha votato a favore dello sciopero. Per lo sciopero, era necessaria solo una maggioranza di due terzi.\nI lavoratori sono insoddisfatti per la stagnazione dei salari I leader del sindacato avevano inizialmente consigliato ai membri di accettare il contratto proposto all'inizio della settimana.\nOltre ad aumentare i salari, avrebbe mantenuto la costruzione del prossimo aereo commerciale della Boeing nell'area di Seattle, a condizione che il progetto iniziasse prima della scadenza del contratto.\nI lavoratori, tuttavia, sono arrabbiati per la stagnazione dei salari e per le concessioni fatte a partire dal 2008 sulle pensioni e sull'assistenza sanitaria .\nLa Boeing ha sottolineato di essere “pronta a tornare al tavolo per raggiungere un nuovo accordo” dopo il voto.\nRelated La capsula Starliner della Boeing atterrata senza astronauti a bordo Boeing, aereo fuori pista in Senegal: 10 feriti e altre polemiche sulla sicurezza dopo il 737 Max “Il messaggio è stato chiaro: l'accordo provvisorio raggiunto con la leadership dello Iam non era accettabile per gli iscritti. Restiamo impegnati a ripristinare le relazioni con i nostri dipendenti e con il sindacato ”, ha dichiarato l'azienda in un comunicato.\nLo sciopero ignora un appello dell'ultimo minuto del nuovo amministratore delegato della Boeing, Kelly Ortberg, nominato il mese scorso.\nPoco prima del voto, Ortberg aveva avvertito i lavoratori che lo sciopero avrebbe messo “a rischio” la ripresa dell'azienda, aggiungendo che “nessuno vince” in caso di sciopero.\nUn anno difficile per il colosso dell'aeronautica Quest'anno ben poco è andato per il verso giusto per la Boeing, dall'esplosione di un pannello in uno dei suoi jet passeggeri a gennaio alla Nasa che ha lasciato due astronauti nello spazio invece di rimandarli a casa con una navicella Boeing afflitta da problemi.\nFinché lo sciopero continuerà, la Boeing sarà privata del denaro necessario che ricava dalla consegna di nuovi aerei alle compagnie aeree.\nCondividi questo articolo Commenti Notizie correlate La capsula Starliner della Boeing atterrata senza astronauti a bordo Corea del Sud, i lavoratori della Samsung Electronics in sciopero Frodi online: Revolut boccia l'iniziativa di Meta, \"non è sufficiente\", su Facebook volano le truffe Sicurezza aerea Boeing Sciopero PUBBLICITÀ Scelti per voi Ora in riproduzione Prossima Libano, Idf: \"Ucciso responsabile reti di comunicazione di Hezbollah\" Ora in riproduzione Prossima Morte Nasrallah, Khamenei: \"Legittimo l'attacco del 7 ottobre\" Ora in riproduzione Prossima Dazi alle auto elettriche cinesi: i Paesi Ue si dividono Ora in riproduzione Prossima Ucraina, nuovi attacchi missilistici russi nell'oblast di Donetsk Ora in riproduzione Prossima Austria, leader della destra Kickl a colloquio per formare il governo PUBBLICITÀ I più visti Corea del Sud presenta il suo più grande missile balistico Come fa Israele a sapere dove sono i capi dei gruppi terroristici Emilia Romagna: allerta rossa maltempo, duemila evacuati nel ravennate La desalinizzazione può contribuire al fabbisogno di acqua dolce?

    "text": "Ex-Kenya cricket internationals reminisce old times\nWhat you need to know:\n- Maurice Odumbe, 54, who played for Team Green was named the best fielder while Karim, 60, who represented Kenya in the three ICC World Cups; 1996 (vice-captain), 1999 (captain) and 2003 was crowned the best bowler after he took two wickets in two overs where he conceded six runs.\n- “It was a good feeling to meet my comrades, whom we had played with. I had not seen them in a longtime, so it was nice to come back on the ground and see what we could do and I believe everyone had a wonderful day,” said Karim.\nLegendary cricketer Steve Tikolo produced a man-of-the-match performance to guide his side, Team Red to a six-wicket victory over Team Green in a Kenya Legends T20 match at Sikh Union Club in Nairobi on Sunday.\nThe contest, which was dubbed the “Clash of the Legends”, was graced by several cricket stakeholders including the Cricket Kenya chairman Manoj Patel, family members of the retired Kenyan cricketers and a section of the national team players.\nIt was organised by Chidambaran Subramanian, Kamaljeeth Singh and Kalpesh Solanki.\nBatting first after losing the toss, Team Green, which was captained by Kenya cricket legend Aasif Karim, set a target of 119 runs for the loss of eight wickets in 20 overs of their innings.\nIn reply, Team Red carried the day after hitting 122 runs for the loss of four wickets in 18.1 overs of their innings.\nGoing by the slow pace of some of the former national team players, it was evident that age and lack of consistent play had taken a heavy toll on them. The match was stopped for several minutes in the seventh over after Team Green’s Zafir Din retired hurt after injuring his uncle. He was rushed to hospital for medication.\nTikolo, 52, lived to the expectation with his brilliant batting, which saw him top-score with 47 runs off 32 balls.\nHe thrilled the crowd with his five fours and a towering six.\n“When we play this game, we do it to perform and win for our team. Fortunately today my team crossed the line and I’m very happy with the performances from the players,” said Tikolo, who is regarded as one of the most accomplished batsmen Kenya has ever produced.\n“Our plan as a team was to restrict them so that they don’t score many runs. When we came in to bat, it was about us occupying the crease more…I still have it to play for the legends but not the national team,” added the Nigeria cricket national team coach.\nHis team mate Andrew Mboya also impressed with 38 runs from 33 balls including two fours and two sixes. For that impressive performance, Mboya received two trophies – Most Sixes and Best batsman.\nMaurice Odumbe, 54, who played for Team Green was named the best fielder while Karim, 60, who represented Kenya in the three ICC World Cups; 1996 (vice-captain), 1999 (captain) and 2003 was crowned the best bowler after he took two wickets in two overs where he conceded six runs.\n“It was a good feeling to meet my comrades, whom we had played with. I had not seen them in a longtime, so it was nice to come back on the ground and see what we could do and I believe everyone had a wonderful day,” said Karim.\nOdumbe said: “I have really enjoyed myself. I cannot believe that at my age, I can still be the best fielder. It means that my body is still cooperating. We need more of these.”\nSubramanian on the other hand said: “They have shown that they are true legends. It was not easy for them to come in without practice and playing but they have shown how best they are in their game.”\nThe match was sponsored by several entities including; Sikh Union, Zayan Agencies Limited, Jumbo DDA Kenya, Sunshine Travel and Tours, Red Star Enterprises Limited, SUVI Racing, Bank of Baroda, Filmline Limited, Nairobi Sports House and Radio FM 44.",
