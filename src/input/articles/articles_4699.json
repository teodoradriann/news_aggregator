    "text": "What Makes Joanna Gaines' Chili A Huge Crowd-Pleaser Chili generally tends to be a crowd-pleaser. There's just something inherently comforting about a steaming bowl of meat, beans, and spices that makes it a reliable favorite. Many [styles of chili](https://www.thedailymeal.com/eat/regional-american-chili-styles/) exist, all with different flavor combinations. But while each is delicious in its own way, the kind that interior designer and TV personality Joanna Gaines makes is next-level satisfying, due to how it transforms both the taste and texture of the dish. Gaines' chili recipe, originally shared in the first volume of her \"Magnolia Table Cookbook,\" starts off like plenty of other chili recipes. It's made with ground beef, canned tomatoes and chiles, and southwestern-style beans, and is topped with shredded cheese and served with cornbread. In addition to these common ingredients, however, the cookbook author also incorporates chips — Fritos, to be exact. This has the effect of both introducing an extra hint of saltiness and adding a crunch factor. It's no wonder Gaines described the topping as \"a revelation\" in her book. Adding Fritos to chili Though Joanna Gaines has shared many of her own original recipes in her cookbooks and cooking show, the chili recipe isn't one of them. As she revealed in her book, she inherited the recipe from her sister-in-law, who gifted her a family cookbook when she married into the Gaines family. However, the family wasn't the first to combine Fritos with chili. In the southwestern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico (where Joanna's husband Chip Gaines spent his childhood), there's a regional specialty called [Frito Pie](https://www.thedailymeal.com/recipes/frito-pie/). This popular dish is made simply by topping a bag of Fritos with chili, and can be garnished with a scoop of sour cream. The Gaines family recipe technically inverts the order, topping the chili with Fritos, instead of the other way around. However, as Joanna showcased in an episode of her 2020 YouTube vlog series, \"Quarantine Cooking,\" she serves hers more like a Frito Pie, with the corn chips on the bottom. Joanna Gaines' tips for making chili One of the great things about chili is that it offers a lot of flexibility in terms of [what ingredients and spices you can add](https://www.thedailymeal.com/1124384/ingredients-that-will-take-your-chili-to-the-next-level/). All of them, along with their exact measurements, are outlined in the \"Magnolia Table Cookbook,\" but Gaines herself admits that she doesn't always follow her recipes to a tee. Even if you don't have every single ingredient, you can still make a tasty chili, [even if you're using chili from a can](https://www.thedailymeal.com/1443218/upgrade-canned-chili-ingredients-tip/). Gaines, after all, improvises when she's missing ingredients; for example, she says that southwestern-style chili beans can easily be substituted for any other canned variety. Since Fritos are a major part of this recipe, you'll also want to be mindful of the salt content. If you plan to put a lot of Fritos in your chili, you may want to either opt for the lightly salted kind so you have better control over your sodium intake, or simply cut back on the amount of salt you incorporate in the stew in first place.",

And we stand by their claim that the Crown is breaching Te Tiriti o Waitangi failing to protect Te Iwi Māori from climate change impacts.\" says Green Party Māori Development Spokesperson, Hūhana Lyndon. \"The Government is willing to trash our taiao to pay for their tax cuts - raiding the climate emergency response fund, cutting transport projects that reduce emissions, like public transport and bike lanes, and ending the oil and gas ban. For too long, legacy parties have played politics with our planet - favouring polluting industries at the expense of protecting communities and the planet. Aotearoa is not willing to accept this. \"As kaitiaki of te taiao, we have consistently seen tangata whenua at the forefront, advocating for our communities in the wake of climate-change powered disasters, in Auckland, Te Tairawhiti, and the Hawke's Bay. We know tangata whenua are more likely to be impacted by climate change than other New Zealanders. \"A better future is possible, one where our tamariki swim in clean waters, gather kai moana and live in harmony with the natural world. There is no time to waste, we must act now to ensure a thriving taiao for our mokopuna and future generations. Honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi is our future - for people and planet.\" says Hūhana Lyndon. [here](/greens-support-waitangi-tribunals-climate-1175391/).",

    "text": "Frenchwoman Killed in Lebanon Explosion Amid Escalating Conflict An 87-year-old Frenchwoman was killed after a powerful explosion in southern Lebanon. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the incident, noting the building collapsed. Israel's bombardment of Lebanon continues despite international calls for a ceasefire. Around 20,000 French citizens live in Lebanon, maintaining strong ties with Paris. An 87-year-old Frenchwoman was killed after a powerful explosion in the south of Lebanon, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on Thursday. The ministry stated that the building where the Frenchwoman lived collapsed following the explosion. No other French nationals are known to be affected by the conflict so far. Israel has continued its bombardment in Lebanon, with ongoing strikes causing numerous fatalities. In the face of a possible regional escalation, Israel has rejected ceasefire proposals from the United States, France, and other allies. Around 20,000 French citizens are registered with the French foreign affairs ministry as residing in Lebanon. The country, once a French protectorate, maintains strong connections with Paris.
