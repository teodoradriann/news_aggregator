    "title": "Vučić on the decision on Kosovo license plates: With this and some other things, we avoided big pitfalls and dangers",
    "text": "The President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vučić, said today that with the decision on the free movement of vehicles with Kosovo RKS plates through central Serbia, \"big pitfalls and dangers\" for the country have been avoided. Vučić told Prva Television that he thinks that the decision of the Government of Serbia, which will come into effect tomorrow, will benefit the Serbian people and Serbia as a whole. \"Our interest is the Open Balkans and the freedom of movement, which also applies to vehicles. I think that this decision will benefit the Serbian people and Serbia as a whole. With this and some other things, we have avoided major pitfalls and dangers for Serbia,\" Vučić said. He estimated that during January and February, Serbia will face \"great pressures\" regarding Kosovo, but also that it will be exposed to new pressures due to relations with Russia. \"They have to solve the Kosovo problem before entering into any talks about Ukraine. The end of January and February will be the peak of their campaign around the elections for the European Parliament, and in March there will be elections in Russia, where there will be the renewal of Putin's mandate, but also even fiercer pressure from the world to all those who have any relationship with Russia,\" said Vučić. He assessed that yesterday's repetition of voting at 35 polling stations throughout Serbia showed \"regularity\" according to which the popularity of the list \"Serbia must not stand still\" increased and the popularity of the list \"Serbia against violence\" decreased, and this, he said, was due to the violence they used. on the streets of Belgrade. \"A certain growth was seen, I saw it through the polling stations, compared to the previous vote, of the list led by Branimir Nestorović and the decline of all other lists, but that doesn't mean anything,\" said Vučić. He said that he expects the election process to be completed in the next 10 to 12 days, since voting will be repeated on January 2 at eight more polling stations. Vučić also said that unlike the parliamentary elections, where the list around the Serbian Progressive Party will have the majority, in Belgrade after the local elections \"there is no clear majority\". \"The first list is 'Belgrade must stand' with 49 mandates, then the list 'Serbia against violence' with 43 mandates, Miloš Jovanović has seven, Nestorović six and SPS five mandates. We and Dacic are two mandates short of an absolute majority, obviously everything depends on Nestorović. If he wants new elections, new elections will be held, and if he doesn't want it, there will be a new majority,\" said Vučić. He announced that in a year and a half, the average salary in Serbia will be 1.000 euros, and that \"already in March\" it will be around 830-840 euros. \"A good economic time is coming, an increase in pensions, the minimum wage, an increase in wages in the public sector. Serbia's economy is functioning well, if there were no wars in the world, we would get an investment rating and then Serbia would go to heaven,\" said Vučić. Bonus video:",

    "text": "The fire truck Peoria donated to Ukraine just responded to its first call\nPEORIA (25News Now) - After a decommissioned Peoria fire truck was given a second life overseas, locally-based organization US Ambulances for Ukraine received word Wednesday that it went on its first emergency response call.\n“When you start to get feedback, or you get messages, or even pictures or videos. It’s great to know the vehicles are doing what you hope they would do,” said founder Chris Manson.\nTuesday night, volunteer firefighters in Ukraine used the truck to respond to a small fire in a building that had spread to nearby brush.\n“To see that be able to be carried forward to a whole other country and to see that it can have a positive impact on the community, it makes us feel good inside,” said Peoria Fire Chief Shawn Sollberger.\nIn March, the Peoria City Council approved sending the decommissioned fire truck to Ukraine. US Ambulances for Ukraine vehicles are only used for humanitarian purposes.\nManson has traveled to Ukraine to deliver vehicles around nine times. He took the Peoria truck in May.\nHe and his team have had to take shelter before, but this was the first time they witnessed a large attack, as Ukraine’s war with Russia continues.\n“It was really the first time seeing the anti-aircraft fire go up, seeing them actually hit their targets, you know, seeing explosions in the distance or over the city. So, that was a little unsettling,” Manson said.\nTheir efforts will continue, even after witnessing this violence. The organization is currently working to secure around fifteen more vehicles to donate. These cars, ambulances, and fire trucks will come from all over the United States.\nIn the meantime, the Peoria fire truck is there to answer calls.\n“The citizens of Peoria, and the city council, the fire chief, can rest assured that the vehicle is doing what it’s supposed to be doing, living a good second life serving citizens in need,” Manson said.\nYou can watch 25News - any newscast, anywhere - streaming LIVE on 25NewsNow.com, our 25News mobile app, and on our WEEK 25News SmartTV streaming app. Learn more about how you can get connected to 25News streaming live news here.\nCopyright 2025 WEEK.

    "text": "EU, US to Launch Maritime Corridor To Deliver Aid To Gaza\nThe European Union, along with the United States and the United Arab Emirates, will launch a maritime corridor to deliver humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza amid mounting alarm about the conditions there.\n(Bloomberg) -- The European Union, along with the United States and the United Arab Emirates, will launch a maritime corridor to deliver humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza amid mounting alarm about the conditions there.\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, announced the plan Friday during a trip to Cyprus, where she warned of a “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza. She said the operation should begin this weekend, with a pilot operation being conducted Friday.\n“I call on all the actors who have a role to play here to help this corridor deliver on its potential,” von der Leyen said in a statement. “The maritime corridor can make a real difference in the plight of the Palestinian people.”\nThe EU has been growing increasingly frustrated about humanitarian aid flows being blocked, but the bloc remains split over how its approach to Israel and the crisis. EU leaders will address the Middle East crisis when they hold a summit in Brussels later this month, but it’s unclear whether they will be able to agree on a joint statement calling for a humanitarian pause or a ceasefire.\nBelgium, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, conducted the first flight this week in an airdrop operation coordinated by Jordan aimed at delivering aid to Gaza. Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib said that the suffering of civilians is “unbearable.”\n“All those concerned about the situation in Gaza should put pressure on Israeli government to grant unimpeded humanitarian land access & not blocking convoys,” Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said in a post on X on Thursday. “Other options are not enough: airdrops good but insufficient, sea corridors needed but take time. And time is of essence.”\nPresident Joe Biden said Thursday that he ordered the US military to create a temporary port on the Gaza coast as he called on Israel to allow more aid into the territory.\nUS officials said it could take weeks to build the facility, which could allow ships to deliver food, water, medicine and other supplies.\nRead more: EU, US to Launch Maritime Corridor to Deliver Aid to Gaza\n--With assistance from Georgios Georgiou.\n(Updates with Biden announcement in last two paragraphs)\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n ",

    "text": "HINSDALE — If it wasn’t for a knee injury during his days as a FedEx delivery driver, Jason Reed might never have realized his dream.\nWhile recuperating, Reed revisited a long-held ambition from when he was a kid: to own a pizzeria. It stemmed from his days working at Domino’s as a teen; he also worked nights there when he was making his way through school at Berkshire Community College.\nReed originally wanted to own a Domino’s franchise, but found the company’s overhead requirements too large to meet. Instead, he found himself looking at local joints in need of new ownership.\n“I just started looking for local pizza shops and I found Anna’s (Pizza and Greek Restaurant in Hancock) while I was rehabbing my knee,” Reed said. “I was like, ‘This could be my ticket out of a truck.’”\nReed ran Anna’s Pizza and Greek Restaurant, at 175 Lebanon Mountain Road along Route 20, for about three years. Then, he got a chance to move closer to home — right around the corner, in fact. He’s lived in the town with his family for seven years.\nOn Wednesday, April 10, he opened his new establishment, the Hinsdale Pizza House, at the corner of Plunkett Avenue and Main Street in Hinsdale.\nThen, the orders started flying in.\nThe restaurant was supposed to be open from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., but ...\n“The phone was off the hook at 5 p.m.,” Reed said. “We just couldn’t keep up.”\nReed was used to handling 30 tickets on a typical Friday night in Hancock, but on a Wednesday and Thursday night in Hinsdale, he easily cleared double that figure. When the shop opened, he had just one full-time employee besides himself to deal with the rush.\nFoot traffic was a large contributor to the unexpected customer flock, he said, having managed a roadside shop on a highway as opposed to a storefront in the heart of town.\nThe restaurant’s kitchen setup includes an oven capable of cooking four large pizzas at a time, he said, which takes about 12 minutes to complete. He can cook about 20 pizzas an hour with that equipment layout, which wasn’t close to meeting the demand.\nThe result was long wait times for some patrons, and\na decision to close the restaurant temporarily until he could work out the kinks. Hinsdale residents have been gracious and supportive of the business so far, he said, but he wants to ensure that he gets it right the second time around.\nReed hopes that will be in about a week, with an anticipated re-opening date of April 23.\nReed has made major changes since the last night the restaurant was open, hiring five more staffers, including one more full-time employee. The rest are part-time workers covering shifts. The new hires are exclusively kitchen staff, he said.\nReed is also moving more kitchen equipment into the restaurant, opening up a storage room in the building that was previously going to be unused to set up more ovens and stoves. A range hood that was already in the building proved to be a windfall for him, as he’ll be able to move appliances right in.\n\"I wasn't going to utilize it,\" Reed said. \"I didn't know what to expect. But now that I know I need a staff, I can have people two rooms away and still be out front.\"\nThe range hood was installed by one of the business's previous owners — who played no small part in its storied legacy.\nThe Hinsdale Pizza House’s location is a fixture in the town’s history. It’s the site of Naughton’s Market, a corner store that first opened in 1900, owned and operated for decades by the successors of founder John Naughton, Sr.\nSubsequently, it was Glenn’s Hinsdale General Store, owned by the late Glenn Wnukowksi. Visitors to the pizza shop can still visit “Glenn’s Corner,” named in Wnukowski's honor.\nFor the last few years, it operated as Birch and Cork Furniture, Co., whose owners installed the “Glenn’s Corner” sign.\nWnukowski was the one who installed the range hood that is helping Reed to adapt the business so quickly.\nReed hopes that his pizza joint, distinguished by each pie's homemade sauce and dough, can fit right into the beloved community spot, too.\n“I built relationships out at Anna’s; I’ll do the same here,” Reed said. “After a while, I’ll know your name when you walk in … it’s like a small town feel.”",

    "text": "Vitoria, 31 dic (EFE).- El lehendakari, Iñigo Urkullu, ha destacado que desde el año 2012 -cuando empezó su mandato- a la actualidad el paro en Euskadi ha descendido desde una tasa del 16 por ciento a menos del 8 por ciento actual.\nEn su último mensaje de fin de año -será emitido esta noche, pero el Gobierno Vasco lo ha facilitado antes-, el lehendakari, que no repetirá como candidato en las elecciones vascas de primavera, se ha despedido: \"Servir a la sociedad vasca es el honor más grande que, personalmente, jamás habría podido imaginar\".\nDesde el 2012, \"Euskadi ha cambiado y se ha transformado. Lo ha hecho gracias al esfuerzo de todas y todos. Nuestra sociedad ha avanzado y ha dado pasos decisivos hacia el futuro\", de los que ha destacado cuatro: empleo, convivencia, cohesión y autogobierno.\nRespecto, al primero, el empleo, ha resaltado el descenso del paro, \"un gran logro colectivo que debemos a las personas emprendedoras, autónomas, empresas, cooperativas, economía social, trabajadores y trabajadoras; personas que invierten, innovan y abren nuevos mercados\".\nEn la convivencia, ha rememorado que en 2012 \"compartíamos el reto anhelado de la paz y la convivencia, dejar atrás décadas de violencia y terrorismo, lograr la desaparición definitiva de ETA, avanzar en una memoria crítica; en la cultura del respeto, la paz y la convivencia...Nos queda la herida de las víctimas, a quienes recordamos cada día\".\nEste año 2023 ha recordado también a las víctimas inocentes fallecidas en Ucrania, Israel, Gaza y en tantos lugares en los que se dan conflictos violentos.\nAdemás, ha mostrado su \"profunda preocupación por la falta de capacidad de la Unión Europea ante los conflictos armados internacionales\" así como por el endurecimiento de las políticas migratorias.\nEl tercer paso es la cohesión social, la capacidad de superar situaciones adversas y adaptarse al cambio, preservando la igualdad de oportunidades.\nEn 2012, ha admitido, \"no imaginábamos lo que nos esperaba\", con crisis sucesivas y profundas, pandemia, guerras, inflación, subida de los tipos de interés, mayor coste de la vida... este es el contexto real de estos años. Euskadi ha sabido afrontarlo\".\nEsta respuesta ha sido posible gracias al cuarto paso, al autogobierno, \"gracias a nuestros propios recursos y capacidades. Lo recuerdo una vez más, nuestro autogobierno ni está garantizado, ni ha tocado techo. Debemos defenderlo y protegerlo, también ampliarlo y reforzarlo\".\nEn esta década larga, ha resumido, Euskadi ha avanzado \"con aciertos y, sin duda, también con errores\", tras lo cual ha defendido su gestión, \"basada en el rigor, en la seriedad, en la máxima responsabilidad, sin hipotecar el futuro de nadie, sin prometer imposibles, siempre con los pies en el suelo\".\nPara Urkullu, este próximo 2024 será un año \"de transición fundamental para situar a Euskadi entre los países más desarrollados del mundo\".\n\"Contamos con recursos para reforzar los servicios públicos, garantizar el sistema vasco de protección social, afianzar nuestro desarrollo económico y el empleo\".\nTodo para responder a los retos de futuro, como la transición tecnológica, la medioambiental, el refuerzo de los servicios públicos esenciales o el reto demográfico.\nTambién habrá que \"proteger a quien más lo necesita, no dejar a nadie atrás, avanzar en igualdad y atajar, de una vez por todas, la lacra de la violencia machista y el menosprecio a la dignidad de las personas\".\nUrkullu ha terminado con las mismas palabras \"de confianza, compromiso y esperanza de mi primer mensaje en 2012: Comienza un nuevo año, un nuevo tiempo, trabajaremos para que sea mejor para todas y todos, este es nuestro compromiso\".

    "text": "Audio relacionado En entrevista para MVS Noticias con Juan Manuel Jiménez, en ausencia de Manuel López San Martín, Emilio Saldaña ‘Pizu’, experto en tecnología, habló sobre el desarrollo de la Inteligencia Artificial durante el 2023. \"El gran auge de la AI en tantas industrias. Destacaría el que como nunca la humanidad tuvimos el acceso a un reto intelectual que como especie no habíamos nunca enfrentado y me parece que de ese sentimiento de instinto y supervivencia es que se generaron a lo largo de este año tantos temores y que crecieron tanto, se magnificaron tanto hasta el punto de hablar de una posible destrucción de la especie humana\", expresó. \"La velocidad, la participación de los gobiernos en entender, regular y participar de los cambios de la Inteligencia Artificial, por ejemplo en el desplazamiento o no laboral...México ha sido un participante muy activo no solamente en el uso de la Inteligencia Artificial a nivel empresarial o en la participación en el uso de mujeres en el campo de la AI, sino que además participa en las mesas a nivel legislativo hacia donde debería ir la regulación\", agregó. Te podría interesar El uso de la Inteligencia Artificial en las elecciones del 2024 Para terminar, Emilio Saldaña destacó en la conversación la forma en cómo los políticos pueden apostar por el uso de redes sociales y las tecnologías como AI para mejorar la comunicación de entre los candidatos, ciudadanos y plataformas políticas en un año electoral como lo será el 2024. \"Es súper oportunidad de hacer una elección informada o no... El uso de la tecnología como el puente de comunicación entre políticos y sus plataformas y los jóvenes, es importantísima\", declaró. Te podría interesar \"El uso de las herramientas digitales son una gran apuesta para que los jóvenes se puedan acercar a sus plataformas, conozcan qué les están ofreciendo para mejorar su entorno, desde la posibilidad de tomar el documento de las propuestas de los candidatos y pedir a un Chat GPT que te lo explique para alguien de 15 años, que te lo explique en tu beneficio y esto permita decidir informados\", concluyó.",
