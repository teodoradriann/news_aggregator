    "text": "Verkehr ohne Abgase\nHUK Coburg: Private E-Autokäufe legen stark zu\nCoburg (dpa)\nBisher werden die meisten Elektroautos in Deutschland von Firmen angeschafft, die privaten Autobesitzer hingegen sind weit zögerlicher. Eine neue Analyse deutet auf nachlassende Vorbehalte.\nNach langer Flaute kommt der private Elektroauto-Markt in Deutschland wieder in Schwung. Im zweiten Quartal sind laut «E-Barometer» des Versicherers HUK Coburg so viele private Autobesitzer auf einen vollelektrischen Wagen umgestiegen wie seit der Streichung der staatlichen Kaufprämie Ende 2023 nicht mehr.\nDemnach entschieden sich zwischen Anfang April und Ende Juni im statistischen Schnitt 5,5 Prozent der privaten Besitzer bei der Anschaffung eines anderen Wagens für ein batteriebetriebenes Auto. Das war gut ein Drittel mehr als in den ersten drei Monaten des Jahres (4,1 Prozent), wie das Unternehmen mitteilte. Fahrzeuge mit Hybridmotoren sind in der Auswertung nicht mitgezählt.\nFirmen- und Dienstautos außen vor\nDie alte Bundesregierung hatte den Elektroauto-Zuschuss im Dezember 2023 gestrichen, danach war die Umstiegsquote von 6,2 auf unter 4 Prozent gesunken. Die Auswertung beruht auf den unternehmenseigenen Daten, die HUK ist mit gut 14 Millionen Fahrzeugen Marktführer der Kfz-Versicherung in Deutschland vor der Allianz.\nAnders als das Kraftfahrtbundesamt (KBA) in seinen Zulassungsstatistiken wertet die HUK für ihr «E-Barometer» ausschließlich die Anmeldungen privater Autobesitzer aus, und zwar sowohl gebrauchter als auch neuer Fahrzeuge. Firmen- und Dienstautos sind ebenso wenig berücksichtigt wie die Fahrzeugflotten der Autovermieter.\nDas Unternehmen will damit Aufschluss über die Präferenzen der Autobesitzerinnen und Autobesitzer gewinnen. «Ob der Umstieg zur E-Mobilität in Deutschland gelingt, entscheidet sich im privaten Automarkt, denn er umfasst gut 90 Prozent des Gesamtmarktes», sagte Vorstandsmitglied Jörg Rheinländer.\nVorbehalte gegen Elektroautos werden schwächer\nAuch die begleitenden Umfragen deuten darauf, dass die verbreitete Elektroauto-Skepsis in der Bevölkerung schwächer wird. In der aktuellen Version bewertete erstmals eine relative Mehrheit von 48 Prozent E-Autos mit «sehr gut» oder «gut», 45 Prozent hingegen halten Batterieautos nach wie vor für weniger oder gar nicht gut. Anfang 2024 waren die Befürworter noch mit 37 Prozent in der Minderheit gewesen. Das Umfrageinstitut Yougov befragte im HUK-Auftrag vom 12. Mai bis 1. Juni 4.180 Menschen ab 16.\nDie Vorlieben aber unterscheiden sich stark nach Alter, Geschlecht und Bundesland: In der Altersgruppe ab 40 sind im bundesweiten Schnitt nur 39 Prozent E-Auto-Befürworter, unter den Jüngeren von 16 bis 39 hingegen sind es knapp zwei Drittel (65 Prozent).\nFrauen sind demnach skeptischer als Männer. Letztere halten batteriebetriebene Autos zu 55 Prozent für eine gute Sache, bei den Frauen sind es nur 41 Prozent. Am höchsten sind die Anteile der E-Auto-Besitzer in Bayern (3,7 Prozent) und Niedersachsen (3,6), in Sachsen (1,7 Prozent) am niedrigsten.",

    "text": "GUNTUR: The aqua farmers in Bapatla district are in high spirits as the construction of the high-tech integrated aqua park in Nizampatnam is set to gain pace.\nTo benefit farmers not only in Bapatla but also in other coastal areas, the State government has planned to set up an aqua park on 192 acres with an investment of Rs 186 crore. The Central government has released Rs 84 crore to start the works of the aqua park. Bapatla district Collector J Venkata Murali said that the park will be set up through a central and private partnership, and Rs 82 crore has already been released.\nThe State government issued GO 571 allotting survey numbers to the land reclaimed from the sea, and works will begin as soon as permissions from Chief Commissioner of Land Administration (CCLA) are secured.\nHe visited the land suitable for the aqua park setup and gave necessary instructions to the officials. In the coastal district, the majority of the population in Repalle, Nizampatnam, Bapatla, Karlapalem, Chirala, Vetapalem, Chinaganjam, Nagaram, Bhattiprolu, and other regions depend on aquaculture, which is spread over 21,400 acres.\nThe aqua products of the district are very famous worldwide, with varieties of fish and prawns worth Rs 2,250 crore exported to over 52 countries.\nAqua farmers, in order to get quality seeds of various varieties of fish and prawns, had to travel all the way to Chennai, Pondicherry, Rameshwaram, and Ramanathapuram in Tamil Nadu, bearing high transport costs. Opining that setting up an aqua park would reduce investment costs, T Krishna\nPrasad, an aqua farmer in Chinaganjam, said that it would prevent the hassle of travelling to other States in search of quality seed. With the processing units, farmers would get good selling prices for their produce, he added.\nThough the project has been on the cards for the past couple of decades, it was delayed for various reasons. After a long wait, the foundation stone for the construction works was laid in May 2023 by former chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. The aqua park will be developed as one of its kind in the entire country, producing rare seaweeds and ornamental fish available only in the sea. Food processing units, hatcheries of rare species, and a knowledge centre to educate farmers on the latest technology in use in aquaculture will also be set up.\nThe aqua park will contribute to the growth of the transport, economic, and tourism sectors in the region and provide direct and indirect employment to over 1,000 people. Aqua tourism will get a boost with the setup of sports fish in over 50 acres. The officials are finishing the groundwork and preparing to start construction works as soon as possible.",

Last month, another anti-aircraft defence system in Tel Qulaib and Tel Maseeh in southern Syria were hit in what the senior intelligence sources said was an intensified campaign by Israel to disrupt Syrian air defence systems that Iran was involved in expanding. [Reuters](https://www.devdiscourse.com/reuters-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 04:08 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 04:08 IST Israel carried out an aerial strike targeting a main Syrian air defence base in southern Syria on Thursday in the latest bombing campaign since the outbreak of war in Gaza on Oct. 7, Syrian army and intelligence sources said. Citing a Syrian military source, state media had earlier said missile strikes coming from the direction of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights had targeted several sites it did not identify. \"Our air defences confronted the (Israeli) aggressors' missiles and downed some of them with only material losses,\" a Syrian military source said. Reuters could not independently verify the report. There was no immediate comment from Israel's military. Since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israeli civilians and soldiers, Israel has escalated its strikes on Iranian-backed militia targets in Syria and also struck Syrian army air defences and some Syrian forces. The strikes are believed to have targeted a Syrian army air defence base and a radar station in the Tel al-Sahn area in the Sweida province in southwestern Syria, according to a Syrian military intelligence source and another regional security official familiar with the matter. Last month, another anti-aircraft defence system in Tel Qulaib and Tel Maseeh in southern Syria were hit in what the senior intelligence sources said was an intensified campaign by Israel to disrupt Syrian air defence systems that Iran was involved in expanding. \"Tehran is stepping up its efforts to provide Syria with air defence systems that can potentially erode of the effectiveness of Israeli strikes,\" said another regional military source who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. \"This is related to the Gaza war calculations in the event of the conflict spreading,\" he added. Israel has for years carried out attacks on what it has described as Iran-linked targets in Syria, where Tehran's influence has grown since it began supporting President Bashar al-Assad in a civil war that started in 2011. The strikes are part of an escalation of what has been a low-intensity conflict with a goal of slowing Iran's growing entrenchment in Syria, Israeli military experts say. Fighters allied with Iran, including Hezbollah, now hold sway in vast areas in eastern, southern and northwestern Syria and in several suburbs around the capital.
