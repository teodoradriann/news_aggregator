    "title": "Deportation Proceedings Against Honduran Immigrant Temporarily Stayed, After Dozens of Supporters Journey Hours to Federal Courthouse",
    "text": "|\nA federal judge in U.S. District Court in Manhattan extended her July 21 temporary restraining order protecting Gerson Turcios, a 23-year-old Honduran immigrant and Rhinebeck resident detained Friday by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, from deportation.\nThe decision by Judge Ronnie Abrams will keep Turcios in federal custody at the Orange County Jail in Goshen for another week, allowing him and his legal team time to begin to try to reopen his immigration case, which his attorneys hope will allow him to remain in the country.\nAccording to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Turcios unlawfully entered the United States through Texas in December 2019 and was issued a notice to appear in immigration court. He was ultimately ordered removed from the country on Nov. 3, 2023.\nThe decision Wednesday was met with relief from the more than 30 friends, family members, and local employers who took the trip from Rhinebeck to Manhattan for the hearing to support Turcios’ case. Turcios did not attend the hearing.\n“It’s a total win,” said Luciano Valdivia, owner of Market St Restaurant and Board President of the Rhinebeck Area Chamber of Commerce, speaking outside the courthouse to a crowd of supporters. Valdivia has helped lead the organizing effort around Turcios’s case. “This is what was hoped for,” he said. Many community members at the courthouse said the hearing’s outcome is a testament to the power of collective action and local support.\nTurcios was detained by ICE agents outside his home in Rhinebeck around 5 p.m. last Friday, according to a family member who witnessed the incident but has asked to remain anonymous. ICE reportedly came looking for someone else, but as Turcios returned home from work and pulled into the driveway, two agents approached his car, used a facial recognition device to confirm his identity, and then placed him in handcuffs.\nThe arrest galvanized the Rhinebeck community. The next day, neighbors organized to find legal representation and to raise money for Turcios’s defense. A SpotFund campaign launched on Sunday has raised more than $65,000, as of Wednesday night. As news of Wednesday’s hearing date spread, organizers quickly arranged a bus seating roughly 50 people to bring community members to the courthouse.\nJust after sunrise, seven supporters boarded that coach bus in the parking lot of Tops Friendly Market in Rhinebeck, bound for the federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan. Other supporters opted to take the train or drive to the city on their own. The bus group—made up of Turcios’s family, employers, and neighbors, along with community members eager to help—traveled together for the two-hour ride. They clustered near the front of the bus, many of them strangers before the ride commenced.\nAt the center of the group sat Idania Williams, who describes Turcios as “like a brother” to her, though they are not related. As the bus drove south, Williams shared stories about Turcios’s life. Since he arrived in Rhinebeck in December 2019, he’s celebrated Christmases and birthdays with her family, she said, and he passed his driver’s test with their help. “He was part of our family,” she said.\nThe mood on the bus was nervous in anticipation but warm, filled with laughter, quiet resolve, and a sense of shared purpose. For many, the trip felt like a small act of resistance, an antidote to the feeling of helplessness that has spread in some circles as a result of the federal government’s immigration crackdown. “I’ve been seeing the spread of terror in immigrant communities in the Hudson Valley,” said Ashwini Sukthankar, a labor organizer from Rhinecliff who rode the bus to the courthouse. “We just have to show up.”\nOthers echoed that sense of urgency. Isaac Hoey-Wasow, who attended Rhinebeck High School with Turcios but didn’t know him personally, said he had heard only good things from mutual friends—about Turcios’s work ethic, his dream of starting a landscaping business, and his desire to build a life in the United States after he left Honduras and walked alone for days to reach the Texas border. “I would be here no matter who it was because it’s for each other,” he said. “And if you’re able to step up to help someone who’s been treated unjustly, it’s the right thing to do.”\nKathryn Noelle Phillips, one of Turcios’s landscaping clients, said she grew concerned when he didn’t show up for work last Saturday. He has been helping her reseed the grass on her property after septic work and is always punctual, she said. “It wasn’t like him,” she said as she rode the bus. Turcios had worked for her for over a year, helping with everything from mowing the lawn and cleaning gutters to fixing her shower. She also noted his deep ecological knowledge and love of nature. Phillips found out about his arrest later that day, from a story in The Daily Catch.\nMany who traveled to the courthouse said that while they had followed the ICE raids and deportation cases across the country with growing alarm, Turcios’s detention brought the issue home and compelled them to act. “When it’s in your backyard, that gives you a better opportunity to do something that hopefully affects the situation you’re seeing,” said Jess Lurie, a Democratic political organizer, on her way to the hearing.\nIn the courtroom, just after 11 a.m., Abrams acknowledged the emotional weight of the case and the outpouring of support from the community. “I fully appreciate how heartbreaking this must be for Turcios and his family,” Abrams said from the bench. She acknowledged the many letters submitted on Turcios’s behalf and said it was clear he is “loved in his community.”\nBut she also made clear the legal limitations of her role. “The law is clear,” she said. Federal law restricts the district court from staying the removal order.\nDuring the hearing, Abrams asked why a motion to reopen the case had not already been filed, given that the original removal order was issued over 18 months ago. Gregory Copeland, one of Turcios’s attorneys, explained that the team had only just been granted access to their client hours earlier and had not yet had time to review the details and history of his case.\nImmigration attorney Paul Grotas has since been retained to file a motion to reopen Turcios’s case with the Board of Immigration Appeals. According to Valdivia, Grotas met with Turcios via Zoom on Wednesday.\nFor many in the room, the judge’s decision was a moment of cautious optimism. “It’s a short-term victory,” said Jenny Friedberg, who employed Turcios as a landscaper and has helped organize the support and fundraising effort for his case. Friedberg said she was relieved to know Turcios won’t be moved, that he can have visitors and make phone calls. “We have time,” she added.\nSome close friends and family members were disappointed not to see Turcios in person at the courthouse, as they had expected. “It’s kind of dehumanizing for him not to be here,” a close friend, Brendan Dougherty, said outside the courthouse after the hearing. Turcios had been planning to attend Dougherty’s birthday party on Saturday, the day after he was detained.\nEven so, Dougherty said he’s been struck by the rapid and widespread response to the case. Local community members from both sides of the aisle have come together around the case, asking ‘Why him?’ Dougherty said.\nOn the bus ride home, U.S. Rep. Pat Ryan (D-18) called Leah Conklin, another organizer, to express his gratitude to the group and praise the local effort as a potential model for other communities confronting similar situations.\n“We’re just gonna keep doing our work,” said Friedberg, who underscored the importance of continued community support and action. “I’m very energized.”",

Esta nueva prueba del ‘ingenio mexicano’ nació entre simpatizantes de AMLO, cuyo emprendimiento está siendo todo un éxito ¿Te animas a probarlo? Se vende en esta pulquería de México. ¿Eres fan de AMLO? Prueba el litro de pulque que apoya a la Cuarta Transformación La bebida de los dioses, mejor conocida como pulque, ya se vende en un cilindro con la forma del “Tlatoani” para mostrar su apoyo hacía AMLO y la Cuarta Transformación. El “Amlitro” fue una idea que surgió entre los dueños de la pulquería Calavera Coyote, ubicada en el centro de Puebla, cerca de la Facultad de Filosofía y Letras de la Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP). Para el antojo, y sólo por el mes de abril, podrás comprar tu “Amlitro” por el módico precio de: - Amlitro de Pulque Natural: 95 pesos - Amlitro de Pulque Curado: 135 pesos Tu bebida será servida directamente de un jarrón de pulque en un cilindro con la forma de AMLO, posteriormente será sellado con su tapa y se agrega un popote para tu comodidad. Redes sociales reaccionan al Amlitro que se vende en Puebla Las reacciones en redes sociales por el “Amlitro” no se hicieron esperar, generando buenos comentarios, memes y hasta criticas. Aunque algunos criticaron que era una bebida desagradable al igual que la forma del cilindro, la gran mayoría celebró su creación y afirmaron que “necesitan uno de manera urgente”. “Es un honor estar con Obrador y Claudia” y “¿Donde venden ese termo? necesito uno” fueron algunos de los comentarios. También los usuarios aprovecharon la publicación para presumir sus pertenencias con la forma de AMLO.",

    "text": "Sanidad Sanidad lleva a lo privado 4.350 ecografías B.M - jueves, 19 de junio de 2025 El contrato tiene un presupuesto de 208.800 euros y las pruebas se harán desde agosto Hospital Nuestra Señora de Sonsoles - Foto: David Castro La Gerencia de Asistencia Sanitaria de Ávila contratará por 208.800 euros la realización de 4.350 ecografías en un proceso que supone externalizar estas pruebas y hacerlas fuera del sistema público. En este caso, la plataforma de contratación del sector público dio a conocer este contrato para la realización de estos procedimientos diagnósticos mediante ultrasonidos para pacientes beneficiarios de la asistencia sanitaria pública pero que se harán en centros privados. Según se indica en el contrato, el plazo de ejecución será de cuatro meses y se comenzarán a realizar desde el próximo 1 de agosto o desde la fecha de formalización del contrato si es posterior.Según se indica en el procedimiento que se acaba de abrir, se llevará a cabo la realización de procedimientos diagnósticos mediante ultrasonidos que no pueden ser realizados pro medios propios, como consecuencia de la falta de profesionales para cubrir la plantilla actual del centro, unido al crecimiento de la demanda que no ha podido ser absorbido con el incremento de la actividad. Por ello se lleva a cabo esta contratación y así posibilitar la reducción de los tiempos de espera de los pacientes de la Gerencia Sanitaria de Ávila que se encuentran pendientes de este tipo de pruebas.Aunque no se conoce cuántos pacientes están a la espera de hacerse una ecografía a día de hoy, puesto que se informa de estos datos de forma trimestral, la última información disponible, correspondiente al cierre del pasado mes de marzo, indicaba que en Ávila había 481 personas en la lista de espera para hacerse esta prueba con una media de espera de 41 días.Hay que tener en cuenta que no se trata solo de las personas que están en lista en un momento determinado sino que es una prueba a la que se siguen incorporando pacientes ya que es un método diagnóstico.El número estimado de procedimientos que se van a realizar asciende a 4.350. De ellos, las cifras previstas son de 400 en piel y tejidos blandos, 1.200 en articulaciones, 250 en cuello (tiroides), 1.300 en abdomen completo, 800 en riñón, vías urinarias y próstata, 200 en cuello (troncos supraaórticos) y 200 en el sistema venoso de las extremidades inferiores.El adjudicatario de este contrato está obligado a cumplir todo el plazo de vigencia del mismo y a que sus centros dispongan de los recursos y equipamiento general para realizar con eficacia, calidad y garantía las actividades que se contratan, así como el personal sanitario y no sanitario que permita la perfecta atención y realización de las pruebas.contrato anterior. No es la primera vez que desde la sanidad abulense se decide hacer una contratación externa para realizar ecografías como uno de los métodos para bajar la lista de espera.La última de estas contrataciones se vivió en septiembre del pasado año cuando se decidió externalizar 3.600 ecografías ante el aumento de demanda de esta prueba. Entonces el contrato tuvo un presupuesto de casi 270.000 euros, un plazo de ejecución de dos meses y el adjudicatario fue el hospital Santa Teresa.Las ecografías que se contrataron en aquel momento eran parecidas a las de la actualidad puesto que se repiten algunas como piel y tejidos blandos, articulaciones, cuello o riñón, aunque también había algunas diferentes como cadera pediátrica.Ya en aquel momento se explicó que la cifra que se iba a contratar se hacía en base a una previsión en cuanto al número de pruebas y se recordó que dentro del plan de choque de reducción de listas de espera, tanto quirúrgicas como de pruebas diagnósticas, se contemplaba el autoconcierto (peonadas) y el concierto, acudir a centros privados, que es lo que se hizo en entonces y se vuelve a realizar con el nuevo contrato.Se decidió optar por este sistema tras ver que la demanda de ecografías en el área de salud de Ávila se había venido incrementando de forma sostenida desde 2019 hasta alcanzar niveles superiores a los previos a la pandemia.
