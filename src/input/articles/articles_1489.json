    "text": "Rajasthan school teachers suspended over ‘love jihad’ The action came after Sarva Hindu Samaj, Sangod, sent a memorandum to the Education Minister, alleging that activities of religious conversion and love jihad have been going on in the school since 2019. (Representational image/File) Two instructors at a government school in the [Kota district ](https://pressvani.com/minor-student-gang-raped-in-kota)have been suspended by Rajasthan Education Minister Madan Dilawar due to accusations that they had engaged in activities related to religious conversion and \"love jihad.\" In this context, an inquiry is also being conducted against another educator. The instructors, who were assigned to a school in Kota's Sangod block, received their suspension orders on Thursday evening. Regarding the matter, the minister made a video statement available. We have learned that a Hindu girl's name was changed to a Muslim name when she was in high school. In the neighborhood, there is a plot involving religious conversion and love jihad. After receiving the information, we moved to suspend two teachers, and we are currently looking into another. \"The three of them will lose their jobs after an investigation if it turns out that they were involved in these acts,\" Dilawar stated in the video. The action was prompted by a document issued by Sarva Hindu Samaj, Sangod, to the Education Minister, in which the group claimed that since 2019, there had been religious conversion and love jihad activities taking place in the school. The statement further claimed that three teachers had ties to Pakistani organizations and prohibited groups. The memorandum also mentioned that a police station in Sangod had previously received a formal complaint (FIR) regarding this matter, but no action had been taken. What's Your Reaction?",

    "text": "KAMLOOPS, B.C. — Vancouver's Catholic archdiocese is marking Easter with a commitment towards reconciliation with First Nations in B.C., Archbishop J. Michael Miller says.\nThe church and the chief of the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc announced Thursday that a \"Sacred Covenant\" agreement has been reached between the church and the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C.\nThe covenant comes three years after the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C., announced the discovery of what it believed were the remains of more than 200 children at the site of a former residential school.\nMiller said the agreement with the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc will open a \"new chapter\" in the relationship between the church and First Nations in B.C.\n\"Unquestionably, the church was wrong in implementing a government colonialist policy which resulted in devastation for many children, families and communities. We recognize as Catholics, as the Catholic Church, our part in the resulting tragedies,\" Miller said.\nThe covenant is set to be signed on Easter Sunday, \"a special time of hope and renewal,\" Miller said.\n\"Easter Sunday is the ideal time to help start a new chapter in First Nation and Catholic relations in our province,\" he said. \"Our hope and our prayer is that by taking this next step, we will build on our relationship, a relationship already established but still young, and be an example to Canadian society of respecting the identity and the experience of Indigenous Peoples.\"\nChief Rosanne Casimir of Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc said the covenant will see the church share records and information as the nation continues to investigate the site of a former Kamloops Indian Residential School where hundreds of children went missing.\nCasimir said the agreement is crucial to learning the truth about what happened to the missing children, and access to the church's historical records will help \"bring justice to the children who never made it home.\"\n\"We seek to memorialize the missing children. We also seek meaningful ways to support survivors and intergenerational survivors on their healing journey so that they and their future generations may thrive,\" she said.\nThe nation announced in May 2021 that a search around the former school site using ground-penetrating radar found 200 potential unmarked burial sites.\nSince then, First Nations across the country have conducted searches and made similar discoveries.\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission identified at least 6,000 deaths at residential schools during their time in operation in Canada between the late 1800s and 1996.\nIn many of the deaths, schools didn’t record the children's names, genders or cause of death.\nThe children in the schools were separated from their families and forbidden to speak their own language. They were undernourished and often experienced physical and sexual abuse.\nThe agreement includes commitments from the church on how to properly memorialize residential school survivors, information sharing about missing children and offering \"healing services\" to family members of those who attended the school.\nCasimir said the possible excavation of the Kamloops school site has not begun as it's a \"very sensitive step moving forward,\" that involves work with other nations, survivors and their families.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published March 28, 2024.\nThe Canadian Press",
