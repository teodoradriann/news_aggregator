    "text": "Researchers have found that people who play the game Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) show improvements in their mental health. James Cook University PhD researcher Alyssia Merrick led the study, which analysed the effect the game had on 25 people who played over eight weeks. She said D&D is a tabletop game involving paper and pen, typically played over a series of sessions and with three to six people taking on player characters' roles and one person who takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM). \"The DM is charged with guiding the players' journey and plays the role of enemies and nonplayer characters the players interact with. Players roll dice to determine the result of game actions. The die roll is modified by the abilities given to the players' characters,\" said Ms Merrick. She said researchers measured aspects of the mental health of 25 people with a mean age of 28, including eight females. Four had never played D&D at any level. They played eight one-hour sessions of D&D over eight weeks before their mental health was measured again. \"The game involved players tracking a goblin through a cave system after it had stolen from a town, and players faced monsters and traps as part of this pursuit,\" said Ms Merrick. She said participants demonstrated significant decreases in depression, stress and anxiety and significant increases in self-esteem and self-efficacy over the study period. \"Players often say playing D&D is cathartic and provides a space to express emotions in the game without concern for outside consequences. Due to the nature of the game being cooperative, D&D also offers players a sense of connectedness and a safe space to explore their mental health problems, allowing them to feel more at ease. \"This work and a growing number of other case studies suggest D&D can be harnessed to minimise the impact of anxiety symptoms,\" said Ms Merrick.

    "text": "Embark on a hero’s journey through childhood loss and healing told with good humor in Katie Love’s gripping memoir.\nIn her recently published memoir, “Two Tickets to Paradise: From Cult to Comedy,” L.A. comic Katie Love presents a deeply personal exploration into themes of resilience, self-discovery, and fortitude. Delving into the depths of childhood innocence, the harrowing lure of cultish ideologies, and the redemptive power of humor, Love’s memoir stands as a captivating must-read for 2024.\nWinner of the National Indie Excellence Award, Two Tickets to Paradise: From Cult to Comedy unfolds during the tumultuous 1970s within a landscape colored by cultural upheaval and shifting societal norms. Love’s journey begins amidst the heartache of tragic personal loss — the death of Katie’s mother — and the appeal of a utopian promise within the Jehovah’s Witness faith. The book intricately weaves together the landscape of a changing America with Love’s heroic personal journey in a landscape of a changing America, illuminating the challenges and triumphs she experienced as an innocent young girl undergoing profound personal, social and cultural changes.\nThe memoir chronicles Love’s quest to see her mother again in “Paradise”, an earnest endeavor that leads her through unforeseen adversities and unveils a world starkly different from the one promised. Love’s narrative dances between tragedy and comedy with tender introspection, recounting the transformation of a Bible-wielding child evangelist into a vivacious comedian who discovers solace and healing through the cathartic medium of humor.\n“Katie Love’s remarkable memoir is as unexpected a read as her life’s journey has been. She has survived truly harrowing experiences thanks to her inner strength and undimmed resilience. But Katie’s fierce intelligence and wry sense of humor shine brightly throughout even the darkest moments, and will have you wiping tears of laughter from your eyes even as your heart breaks. Katie’s writing is raw, brave, and at times unexpectedly poignant. This is an unforgettable book.” praised Channing Dungey, Chairman of Warner Bros. Television, adding to the growing acclaim surrounding Love’s work.\nLove’s unfiltered storytelling refrains from sugar-coating the painful realities, yet remarkably, it remains devoid of bitterness. She candidly yearns for love and acceptance from a family trapped in their inability to provide the support she deserves.\nThrough her memoir, Love reflects on the transformative nature of self-love amid adversity, offering readers a poignant glimpse into the human capacity for resilience and the pursuit of acceptance in the face of trials. The memoir’s raw portrayal of life’s complexities makes it a thought-provoking read.\nAvailable in print, digital, and audio formats, the memoir promises an immersive reading experience that resonates with readers seeking poignant storytelling intertwined with the power of humor.
