    "title": "‘Maybe I’m bonkers, but I have a calling’: Ukraine’s medics on frontline",
    "text": "When Russia launched its invasion in 2022, Roman Vozniak gave up his old life. A civilian doctor, he joined Ukraine’s national guard. “I decided to become a combat medic. I told my wife I’d be home in two months,” he said. Two years later, Vozniak is still working on the frontline, treating wounded soldiers. “Your job is to stop people dying. It’s simple. If someone doesn’t make it, you move on. You have to act quickly”. Vozniak is based in Sviatohirsk, a picturesque city in the eastern Donetsk region. Once, tourists would visit its turquoise-domed 16th-century monastery, built at the bottom of a steep chalk hill, and relax in beach cafes along the willow-lined Siverskyi Donets River. In May 2022, Russian forces arrived. They occupied Sviatohirsk for four months. By the time they left, pushed out after a battle, houses and sanatoriums had been destroyed. “There was a beautiful pine forest where you could collect mushrooms. Now it’s a place of death,” Vozniak reflected. The Russians mined the cemetery and woodland nature trails. Fighting continues nearby in the Serebryansky forest . After countless enemy attacks, swaths of trees have burned down. Instead of greenery, there are blackened trunks. Russian airstrikes and artillery pound Ukrainian positions, and trenches criss-cross the sandy earth. Vozniak and his medical colleagues evacuate the wounded in customised vehicles. They included buggies – more manoeuvrable in forest conditions – and armoured ambulances. A charity, Razom for Ukraine , donates them. “For the first two months it was chaos. Things are calmer now,” said Illya Sakhno, a paramedic, as Ukrainian guns thumped away in the distance. A patch on his uniform said: “The louder you cry, the faster we will get to you.” Another read: “Ukraine or death”. A member of the team, 29-year-old nurse Inna Mahomedova, said she had given up her job as a seamstress to help wounded soldiers. She retrained. Was her work hard? “Of course you have emotions. Sometimes it’s terrible. Your soul hurts. I want to be useful,” she said. During breaks, she relaxed by watching horror movies. “It may sound strange, but they switch me off,” she said. “I know they are made up and that nothing is real.” Two monks were killed in 2022 when the monastery was shelled . Civilians left too, including Sviatohirsk’s then mayor, who sided with Moscow . One of those who stayed was 84-year-old Babushka Rima. Earlier this week she gathered bark in a bucket. “I sleep in my kitchen,” she said. “A rocket hit my cottage. It’s the only room left. At nights it’s noisy from explosions “I’ve buried my husband and son. There’s no point in leaving my home because it’s time for me to die soon.” Related: Ukrainian medics help soldiers on the frontline – video During a press conference last month to mark the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion, Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave a figure for dead Ukrainian soldiers – 31,000. He refused to reveal the number of wounded. On Saturday he paid tribute to the “humanity and selflessness” of the medical professionals who have been working since 2014, when Russia seized parts of eastern Ukraine. They were “always helping to save lives”, he tweeted. Humanity, selflessness, and work for the lives of others are all about our people, about our medical professionals. I thank doctors, nurses, all our combat medics, all volunteers who have been by our soldiers' side since 2014 and since February 24, always helping to save lives. [pic.twitter.com/ZKnemIVO3L] — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) [March 2, 2024] Many working with wounded soldiers think the number of deaths is probably higher than the official estimate. “If you don’t recover a body, death is not confirmed,” said Svitlana Druzenko, medical director of the Pirogov First Volunteer mobile hospital . The Russians tried to kill paramedics and frequently fired on rescue vehicles, she said, adding that it was not possible to use helicopters as the enemy would target them, so casualties went by ambulance. Druzenko and her team are based in Lyman , a frontline town not far from Sviatohirsk that has been occupied several times. She described the battle with Russia as “cardinally different” from the second world war – a conflict “without any rules”, fought with kamikaze drones and laser-guided bombs. Russia’s recent successful military push was connected to its presidential election next week, she said. “The Kremlin loves dates. It’s trying to grab territory before then.” Parked in front of a residential compound were green-painted ambulances and a Humvee. Given Ukraine’s recent setbacks, including the loss of the city of Avdiivka , how was morale? “Everyone is tired. Our western partners are tired. I would describe myself as a pessimist,” Druzenko said. “No, realist is better.” In her view, people were “more important” than winning back Crimea and occupied areas. “I don’t see light at the end of the tunnel.” Alex, a surgeon with the mobile hospital, said he often took part in medical evacuations despite the risk of being bombed. “Maybe I’m bonkers,” he joked. “But I have a calling to do this.” Other volunteers said they had no right to feel demoralised. “We believe in victory and a Ukrainian miracle,” said Masha Tsybulska, a 29-year-old nurse. “The wounded guys are not afraid. They are brave. So we have to keep going and hope for a breakthrough.” Patients are driven to stabilisation points and then taken to military hospitals. Oleksandr – a doctor with the call-sign Granddad – said 95% of cases involved shrapnel wounds. He said he talked with badly wounded soldiers and asked them about their families. Badges on his arm proclaimed: “I heal disease by cursing a lot” and “No step back. Behind us is the morgue.” Swearing lowers stress reactions and aids recovery, he said. Related: ‘On our knees’: Ukrainians near frontline say they pay the price for west’s hesitancy At a hospital in Donetsk oblast, a soldier called Andrii was receiving treatment for concussion. Andrii is a 50-year-old driver from Kherson, the southern city liberated in 2022 and now under daily Russian fire. He said a Russian drone had hovered above his foxhole and dropped a bomb. “Of course it’s bad out there. They have more drones than we do,” he said. Asked whether the soldiers with him had all survived, he shook his head sadly. The doctor on duty, Vitallii Harnik, said Andrii would recover in a week or so. “At first, patients with concussion suffer from a range of symptoms. Their head spins and they throw up. We medicate them. They need peace and quiet,” he said. Harnik carried out a series of routine tests. He asked Andrii to touch his nose and checked his breathing and pulse. Nearby, other wounded soldiers browsed their phones and dozed on camp beds. Oleksandr said soldiers typically went back to their platoons as soon as they recovered. “It’s a brotherhood. They know why they are fighting. It’s for their loved ones and their land.” The war, he suggested, was a battle between democracy and totalitarianism. “We are a great country with big ambitions. Our problem is the neighbour to our right. We are different, with another worldview. We have fuck all in common with them.” Back at Sviatohirsk, Vozniak said he had taken two weeks’ holiday since the invasion. Comradeship and humour helped him and his colleagues deal with challenging situations. His call sign, he said, was Caspar, the friendly translucent ghost from the vintage cartoon series. He conceded he had no idea when the war might finish. “My wife is a doctor too. She understands,” he said. “My job may be difficult, but it beats digging trenches.”",

    "title": "Trump Has Thrown a Wrench Into Mitch McConnell’s Immigration Deal",
    "text": "“That’s, like, parallel-universe shit,” a furious North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis exclaimed to reporters Thursday. “That didn’t happen.”\nTillis was referring to a report Wednesday night,\nfrom Punchbowl News, that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was backing away from a deal for enhanced border security with additional aid for Ukraine. The final product of those negotiations has supposedly been coming any minute now for about a week. McConnell, the Senate GOP’s most steadfast supporter of funding Ukraine’s defense against Russia, has been pushing the effort.\nWhat threw Tillis and other McConnell allies into a fit about the reporting wasn’t just the idea that McConnell had turned, but that he had done so out of deference to Donald Trump. According to Punchbowl’s reporting, McConnell, during a Republican conference lunch on Wednesday, said that the “politics on this have changed,” and noted that Trump—whom he referred to as “the nominee”—is campaigning on fixing a broken border.\n“We don’t want to do anything to undermine him,” McConnell reportedly said.\nMcConnell’s office didn’t say anything to deny the reporting. But other GOP senators suggested that his comments had been misinterpreted. He wasn’t throwing in the towel on the deal, which lead negotiators Sens. James Lankford, Chris Murphy, and Kyrsten Sinema say they’re putting the finishing touches on. And he wasn’t “bowing” to Trump, who has been hectoring senators and House members to reject anything short of “\nPERFECT.”\nWhat Republicans didn’t deny, though, was that McConnell had explained how difficult the politics of the situation had become. And no one would contradict him on that.\nLankford, the poor soul tapped with negotiating the deal for Republicans, referred to McConnell’s remarks at the meeting as an “elephant-in-the-room conversation,” as in “everybody in the room knows this,” so McConnell was just saying it “out loud.”\nSo what, precisely, was the elephant in the room? The dirty politics of election-year policymaking, and why significant legislation is much more challenging in even-numbered years. Politicians have to choose, as the saying goes, whether they want the solution or the issue. Donald Trump, as ever, is more blunt than others in saying that he wants to run against Biden’s unpopular handling of border security, and a bill that markedly\ndecreases border encounters would be a “win” for Biden, defanging the potency of Trump’s attacks. After his comfortable wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, Trump is firmly in control of the party’s presidential nomination. That makes it much harder to refuse his wishes.\n“It is going to cause a lot of problems politically,” Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance told reporters on Thursday. “On the flip side, of course, all of us want to secure the border. We might have disagreements about how to get there.\n“So I think,” Vance said of McConnell, “he was just acknowledging the quandary.”\nThe package has split Senate Republicans between their old-guard and MAGA factions, and another rule that’s especially pertinent in election years is that you don’t want to pursue issues that split your members. Typically, McConnell and Senate GOP leadership would never have even gotten into a negotiation with so many predictable red flags. (Keep in mind, too, that the policy issue here is immigration, on which there hasn’t been a meaningful bipartisan deal in a long, long time.) What’s kept McConnell going on this treacherous turf was the need to get cash to Ukraine—which could fall, and quickly, if the American military is cut off.\n“If he’s going to get any money to Ukraine, which he’s for, he’s going to have to get the border done,” Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said of McConnell’s situation. When a reporter asked Lankford on Thursday whether there was a viable path for Ukraine aid without a border deal, Lankford said, simply, “No.”\nChris Murphy, the top Senate Democrat in the border negotiations, said Thursday that Senate Republicans would need to decide “in the next 24 hours as to whether they actually want to get something done,” or whether they want to keep the border a “mess” for political reasons.\n“Republicans have made it very clear they aren’t willing to support Ukraine aid without a border package,” Murphy said. “We have negotiated a border policy package. We did what Republicans asked us to do. And now they seem to be having a hard time actually closing the deal.\n“What is very scary to some Republicans,” he continued, “is that the deal we have reached will actually fix a big part of the problem. And I know for Donald Trump and some Republicans, it’s not in their best interest for there to be policy changes that actually fix the broken asylum system or give the president new tools to better manage the border.”\nNegotiators are keeping details of the would-be deal close to the chest. That alone has been a source of consternation to a lot of Senate Republicans (or so they say).\n“So, I hear from you guys [the media] that\nthere’s a trigger of 5,000 people a day, and that’s when you can trigger the [expedited removal] authority,” Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley told reporters of one reported provision in the deal. “So I say, ‘I don’t like the sound of that.’ And then I’m told by our leadership, ‘Well, that’s not actually how it’s written.’ So I say, ‘How is it written?’ ‘Well, wait for the text.’ ” (Hawley said he could show reporters text messages of his exchanges with leadership as proof, but he demurred when taken up on that offer.)\nAn argument that supporters of the package have been making to Republicans is that they wouldn’t be undermining Trump—they’d be empowering him by putting in place statutory tools on border security that he could employ on Day 1 if elected president. (Keeping expedited removal tools out of Trump’s hands, it should be said, is also the go-to argument progressives have been making to protest the bill from the left.)\n“If President Trump’s the nominee, I want him to be the president next year,” Tillis told reporters. “And I want us to succeed in this Congress to provide the tools he was asking for six years ago.”\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz, who did not take kindly to early reports of the to-be-determined deal, said that this was only proponents’ latest argument in a shifting series of them.\n“Now, if that’s the reported justification, the fact that Trump himself has said he doesn’t need these changes should carry a lot of weight,” Cruz told reporters. “And we do know that, without one word of this bill being enacted, Trump was able to produce incredible success in securing the border.”\nSince the bill has a “zero percent chance of passing the House,” he surmised, “the only purpose” of the deal would be “to give political cover to Democrats who pretend they want to secure the border.”\nA border deal linked with Ukraine aid was never going to be an easy thing to get through. But Trump’s emergence as the more-or-less presumptive nominee and his political interests have made it that much harder for Republicans to pull together a supportive whip count. It doesn’t matter which details are switched in the eleventh hour: The deal would be very, very unlikely to meet Trump’s standard of “PERFECT ON THE BORDER.”\n“But who knows?” Hawley, who will never, ever in his life vote for a bipartisan compromise on border policy, told reporters: “Maybe we’ll see the text tomorrow and it will be, like, a thing of beauty.”",
