    "title": "What is Breast Cancer Risk Assessment? The tool used to detect Olivia Munn's cancer early",
    "text": "\"I was diagnosed with breast cancer,\" her caption read. \"I hope by sharing this it will help others find comfort, inspiration and support on their own journey.\"\nThe 43-year-old mom explained how she and her sister had initially taken a genetic test that \"checks for 90 different cancer genes\" in February 2023. Both had received negative results for all genes, including BCRA - the most well-known breast cancer gene.\nHowever, Munn had also received a mammogram examination around the same time. Two months later, she was diagnosed with breast cancer.\nShe explained how she wouldn't have found the gene for another year if it wasn't for her doctor opting to calculate her \"Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Score\". Munn noted that her OBGYN, Dr Thaïs Aliabadi , saved her life by doing this.\nThe Breast Cancer Risk Assessment is an online tool used to estimate a woman's percentage of developing breast cancer during their lifetime. According to Cedars-Sinai, the assessment \"will help you learn if you have risk factors that may raise your breast cancer risk. It is not a complete review of all breast cancer risks.\"\nThe questionnaire takes about three to five minutes to complete. Questions include basic information about age, family history, medical history, menstrual cycles, gene mutations, and drug use. If a woman has already tested postive for either BCRA1 or BCRA2, this tool should not be used or relied on.\n\"One in eight people assigned female at birth (AFAB) in the United States (around 12 per cent) will develop breast cancer during their lifetime,\" a Cleveland Clinic report stated. \"Tools like risk assessments can help your healthcare provider determine how likely you'll be among the 12 per cent, so they can monitor your breast health closely.\"\nThe clinic emphasised that a breast cancer risk assessment \"can't tell if you will (or won't) develop breast cancer,\" but whether you have an \"above-average risk of developing breast cancer compared to others of a similar age and background.\"\nAge, family history, genetic mutations, race and ethnicity, breast density, hormone exposure, childbirth history, and when your period started or stopped are the most influential factors.\nThe United States National Cancer Institute's Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) - also referred to as the \"Gail model\" after its developer, Dr Mitchell Gail - is the most popular test. Dr Gail developed the test in 1989, but it has since been updated numerous times to predict the likelihood of developing breast cancer within five years and up to the age of 90.\n\"Still, the Gail model doesn't predict breast cancer risk for everyone,\" the Cleveland Clinic noted. \"It's not a reliable tool for predicting risk if you've had a previous breast cancer diagnosis or if you have a genetic mutation that increases your risk.\"\nOther test models include IBIS (Tyrer-Cuzik model), Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium's (BCSC) Risk Calculator, BRCAPRO, Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA), and Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) Breast Cancer Risk Calculator.\nOlivia Munn reveals breast cancer diagnosis and shares video from hospital bed\nOlivia Munn reveals she was diagnosed with breast cancer\nOlivia Munn reveals she can't sit down in Fendi dress at 2024 Oscars\nHow Team GB plan to optimise their sleep for the Paris Olympics - and how you can too\nSex and intimacy are 'major concerns' for people living with cancer - why regaining sexual wellness matters\nChristie Brinkley undergoes skin cancer surgery after revealing diagnosis",

    "title": "'Bridgerton' Star Adjoa Andoh Embraces Her Christian Faith",
    "text": "“Bridgerton” star Adjoa Andoh recently discussed the importance of the role faith has played in her life and how the church has always been her “go-to space.” Andoh explained, sharing that her parents even met through her mother’s vicar, “Faith was big in my mother’s family.” The actress attended her village’s chapel and church, saying, “I was the kid that went three times on a Sunday, did the flower arranging and went to Bible class in the week.”\nAs she got older, Andoh stopped going to church as regularly but “would always go to church on high days and holidays, wherever I was.” She explained, “It’s a place of peace, and I think a late teenager/early 20s person needs peace. It would always be my go-to space; that never changed.” Andoh started attending church regularly again when her eldest daughter started going to a church school. She said, “I was just coming home, really. I just needed the shove. And that’s been my church ever since. I got married there. My daughter got married there. I became a reader in 2009.”\nView this post on Instagram\nOne of her sermons is even available on YouTube, where she\nreminded viewers that “we are family. God’s family. Our faith is in a God of redemption and justice and love.” Andoh’s children are equally passionate about their faith. Her middle daughter, Daisy, is even studying for a Ph.D. in theology. “We have great conversations about thinking about the Bible in the context of when it was written,” the actress said of her family. “Who was it written for? Who it was written by? What was going on at the time?” Andoh still thinks of church as a safe place to process thoughts and emotions.\nShe explained, “For me, church is the place where we come in all our differences and all our difficulties. It’s the place where you can be a hot mess; you don’t have to be fine. It’s you and God. As a community, we need to open those spaces so people always feel welcome.” Andoh continued, “Our job [as Christians] is to make the space so people can be in conversation, in relationship, in the peace, the solitude, the comfort — whatever they need — with God.”",

Lucknow: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath conducted an aerial survey of the flood-affected areas in Shravasti and Balrampur districts on Thursday. During the survey, he collected details regarding the extent of the flood from the officers and directed them to expedite the relief and rescue operation in the affected areas. After the aerial survey, the CM visited the flood-affected villages and interacted with children and women, saw the distribution of relief materials to the needy and handed ₹4 lakh cheque each to families who had lost the members in the floods. Addressing the flood victims, CM said immediate assistance was being provided to the farmers and sharecroppers who died due to natural disasters human-wildlife conflict, snake bites and lightning strikes. The CM emphasized that the state government was conducting relief operations with full force and the loss of life and property had been minimal despite the ongoing flood crisis. “The state government stands with people in this time of crisis and the flood victims do not need to worry about anything. The state government is trying to help you in every possible way. Our effort is to ensure that people don’t face any problems”, he said.

The CM felicitated PAC personnel who had evacuated flood victims to safer place. Along with giving them appreciation certificates, Yogi announced special rewards and cash prizes for their bravery and service. The chief minister conducted an aerial survey of all the flood-affected villages in Ikauna Tehsil of Shravasti to assess the flood situation. Later, Devi Patan divisional commissioner Shashi Bhushan Sushil and Shravasti district magistrate Ajay Kumar Dwivedi informed the CM that sudden release of water from the barrages in Nepal led to the flood in the district. Now the water level of the rivers was gradually decreasing. Yogi inspected the Lakshmanpur Kothi Rapti barrage. He met 11 people rescued from the flood, interacted with the children at the flood shelter and distributed biscuits. He felicitated Rekha Devi, the village guide and 5 PAC jawans who gave information about the people trapped in the flood At present 12 districts in the state are affected by floods, impacting 633 villages across 33 tehsils, with a total affected population of approximately 17.97 lakhs, including over 18,000 cattle. More than 1.45 lakh hectares of agricultural land has been submerged in the flood water..

    "title": "Alameda sues Marina owner for allegedly flouting 'Draconian' rental laws",
    "text": "A community of houseboat residents in Alameda is getting some legal help from the city over an ongoing dispute with their landlord.The city of Alameda is taking legal action against the owner of the Barnhill Marina, for alleged violations and what it deems as \"Draconian\" rent hikes. The Barnhill Marina has 42 floating homes and a dozen live-aboard sailboats along the Alameda side of the Oakland Estuary. \"Most of us have been here for a long time and are kind of older, and living on a fixed income,\" said Sandy Privett, a houseboat owner.Privett has lived in her floating house with the red trim for 50 years. She and other houseboat owners pay rent to the owner of the marina for docking and utilities.Three years ago, a new landlord, an LLC named Valley Investments Redwoods, acquired the marina. Privett noted, \"He started immediately with some demands that we weren&apos;t expecting,\" such as doubling the rent.Privett&apos;s $500 monthly boat slip rent doubled to $1,000, causing financial strain. \"It&apos;s difficult for anyone to come up with something that&apos;s double what they were paying before,\" she said. \"When something like that happens, it does make you feel really insecure about your major investment, your home, and your life.\"Such rent hikes violate local and state laws, which limit increases to no more than an average of 3-3.5% percent annually. Those rental laws apply to boat slips under California&apos;s \"Floating Home Residency Law\", passed in the state legislature in response to this specific dispute in Alameda, back in 2022.Alameda City Attorney Yibin Shen condemned the actions, citing \"exorbitant rent increases, as much as 178 percent.\" The city fined the owner $120,000 for violations, but the owner never paid, and never lowered the rent. The owner of the company tried to sue the City of Alameda for \"unfair rental laws\" in 2022, but lost the suit. In that lawsuit against the City of Alameda, attorneys for Valley Investments Redwoods said that before the change in ownership, \"The berthing fees averaged $574 and were approximately 60-71% below market rate. The prior owners were able to keep these low rates because they did not adequately maintain the premises, failed to procure flood insurance, enjoyed lower property tax obligations, and did not have the same debt service obligations.\"Now, the city, along with the Alameda County District Attorney&apos;s Office, is suing the property owner to get it to comply with the law and pay the fines. According to the lawsuit, the owner is now prohibiting houseboat owners from transferring boat slips to new owners unless the new owners agree to 178% rent increases. That means houseboat owners can&apos;t sell their homes if they decide to leave.\"The owner basically has said to the tenants, &apos;accept double, triple rent increases, or I will not allow you to transfer your property.&apos; We find it to be incredibly egregious and this is why we&apos;ve brought the action,\" said Shen.Efforts to reach the property owner&apos;s attorneys for comment are ongoing. Valley Investments Redwoods, LLC is based in Sacramento, but does not have a business website or listed email or phone number. KTVU contacted the attorneys who represented the property owner in its failed 2022 lawsuit against the City of Alameda for comment on this new legal action and has not heard back from them.",
