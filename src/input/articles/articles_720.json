Epub 2022 Dec 22. PMID:\n36618677\nYan Tang\nFu brick tea (FBT) and its extracts have good lipid-lowering effects and have been used in the treatment of obesity in previous studies. Unfortunately, the therapeutic effect of FBT on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has not been thoroughly studied. In this study, we explored the mechanism by which FBT alleviates NAFLD from the perspective of the gut microbiota and liver metabolites. The results showed that FBT could reduce the body weight, liver weight and abdominal fat of NAFLD mice, and improve liver pathological morphology, liver lipid deposition, blood lipids and liver function. Moreover, FBT improved the diversity of the gut microbiota and changed the profile of liver metabolism in NAFLD mice. Further studies showed that FBT could ameliorate the cecum barrier, and regulate the effects of factors related to lipid synthesis in the cecum and liver of NAFLD mice. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that FBT can alleviate high fat induced NAFLD by regulating the homeostasis of the gut microbiota and liver metabolites.\n[Black Tea : CK(745) : AC(176)](/substance/black-tea) [Gastrointestinal Agents : CK(3145) : AC(843)](/pharmacological-action/gastrointestinal-agents), [Hepatoprotective : CK(5098) : AC(2264)](/pharmacological-action/hepatoprotective)",

Veo bien que tener un título pueda ser algo privado, que no se pueda saber si tienes X o Y titulación si no lo dices tú, pero una vez lo dices, no veo mal que se pueda consultar, sobre todo en casos como este donde la persona es muy conocida.\nEs tan mentiroso que si le das un reloj y le quita las pilas, este no llegaría dar la hora correcta dos veces al día.\nEn realidad aunque tuviera el título (la facultad dice que no), tampoco sería periodista.\nAlvise es un tentetieso para salir de Ayuso.

Todavía se sabe que escuece viendo que tienen a bastardos malpagados defendiendo lo indefendible por doquier.

    "text": "News\nPolice Investigating After 13-Year-Old Basketball Player Is Recorded Stomping Opponent's Head Mid-Game\nPolice have opened an investigation after a violent attack at a youth basketball game was captured on camera.\nIn the video, a player, identified as a 13-year-old boy, was seen stomping the head of an opposing boy who had fallen to the ground.\nThe Sunday game was a match between the Filipino-American youth team Tumakbo United and Payton’s Place in Alameda, California.\nThe video started with a Tumakbo United player receiving the ball.\nA Payton’s Place player then collided with him, grabbing his jersey and bringing them both down. A short scramble for the ball turned into a scuffle between the two downed players.\nAnother Payton’s Place player was then seen approaching the downed Tumakbo teen from behind.\nThe approaching player raised his right foot high above the victim and appeared to throw the full weight of his body into that foot as it slammed into the other boy’s head, making him go completely limp on the floor.\nA referee immediately intervened and grabbed the attacker, creating distance from the victim.\nA video of the incident can be seen\nhere. (WARNING: The linked video contains graphic content.)\nAccording to\nKTVU-TV, the Alameda Police Department confirmed that it is currently investigating the incident.\nAuthorities said both boys were listed as 13 years old in the incident report, but other information about the case is being kept quiet because of the age of those involved.\nThe incident left the downed Tumakbo player with heath problems he is still dealing with.\n“You could clearly see the size of his shoe on his face,” the victim’s mother Eva Guingab told\nKGO-TV. “My son suffered a concussion for the first time he played basketball.”\nThe Guingab family said the child is in concussion protocol after the injury. The incident also left the youth plagued with headaches.\nThe Payton’s Place player’s parents believed their son was simply defending his teammate from the Tomakbo United player.\nPayton’s Place put out a statement shortly after the recorded incident began to gain traction online.\n“There is footage circulating of one of our team’s games this past weekend,” the sports nonprofit wrote in an\nInstagram post. “Unfortunately, the footage is not a positive representation of our team and our values.\n“The behavior that was exhibited by our player is not acceptable, and is being taken seriously. We do not condone violence. Our players are expected to conduct themselves with integrity on and off the court.”\nKTVU reported Payton’s Place issued another statement Tuesday saying the 13-year-old behind the attack is no longer playing with Payton’s Place.\n“His behavior was unexpected. We are working to assist in providing him resources to prevent this in the future,” the team announced.\n“Violence has never been a part of our team. On behalf of the Payton’s Place Family, we sincerely apologize to the player injured in this incident, his family, and all those impacted.”\nTruth and Accuracy\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.\n Read our editorial standards.",

    "text": "Best Dan Houser Rockstar Games\nDan Houser’s departure from Rockstar Games leaves behind an immense legacy of critically acclaimed games that are beloved by gamers everywhere. Houser was an integral part of Rockstar’s iconic attitude and his voice influenced the limits of absurdity and unbridled fun in their games. Rockstar Games’ most popular titles, such as Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Red Dead Redemption , were written by Dan Houser, showcasing his deep involvement and contribution to the essence of these games. Rockstar Games has been at the forefront of the gaming industry for over two decades. They are pioneers of open-world gaming and have been pushing the limits of absurdity and unbridled fun since 1998. At the helm of some of Rockstar Games’ most popular and critically acclaimed titles is founding member Dan Houser, who established the company alongside his brother Sam Houser, as well as Gary Foreman, Terry Donovan, and Jamie King.\nRelated\n7 Best Open-World Games That Don’t Feel Empty, Ranked It’s easy for open-world games to let their massive worlds become stale, but these titles don’t fall into that trap.\nIn 2020, Houser announced he would be leaving Rockstar Games, later establishing a new studio named Absurd Ventures which has announced new projects in 2023. Although Houser has taken his career away from Rockstar Games, he leaves behind an immense legacy of critically acclaimed games that are beloved by gamers everywhere. Players may not quite realize how integral Houser was to their favorite games, and how much of Rockstar’s iconic attitude was influenced by his voice.\nGrand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars Metascore: 93\nGrand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars Platform(s) PSP, iOS, Android, Nintendo DS Released 2009-03-17 Genre(s) Action-Adventure Developer(s) Rockstar Leeds, Rockstar North\nAlso set in GTA 4’s Liberty City, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars follows Huang Lee, who is part of the organized crime syndicate the Triad, as he attempts to retrieve a stolen sword that was gifted to him by his late father. Lee accidentally becomes caught up in a huge power struggle in the higher ranks of the syndicate.\nChinatown Wars is one of the few GTA games developed for handheld consoles, namely the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. The game was written by Dan Houser alongside David Bland and is one of the highest-rated DS games on the Metacritic site.\nRed Dead Redemption Metascore: 95\nRed Dead Redemption Platform(s) PS3, Switch, PS4, Xbox 360 Released 2010-05-18 Genre(s) Open-World, Adventure Developer(s) Rockstar San Diego\nRed Dead Redemption was released in 2010 and quickly became one of Rockstar Games’ most popular titles.

The story follows outlaw John Marston as he’s blackmailed into working for the government after they kidnap his wife and child. Compared to previous Rockstar titles, Red Dead Redemption placed more outright emphasis on morality and questioned more serious themes – all of which helped garner its immense success.\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City Metascore: 95\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City Platform(s) PS2, Xbox (Original), PC, iOS, Android, macOS Released 2002-10-29 Genre(s) Action, Adventure Developer(s) Rockstar Games\nIn 2002, Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, which is set in 1986 and follows Tommy Vercetti as he builds an organized crime empire by acquiring different organizations across the city.

Brothers CJ and Sweet are among some of the most popular GTA characters.\nDan Houser wrote the game with James Worrall and DJ Pooh, and also produced it, as well as voice acting. Houser stated that the satire was “leveled at the broader weirdness of America and American consumerism and American action movies”.\nGrand Theft Auto 3 Metascore: 97\nGrand Theft Auto 3 Platform(s) PS2, Xbox (Original), PC, iOS, Android, macOS Released 2001-10-23 Genre(s) Action, Adventure Developer(s) Rockstar Games\nGrand Theft Auto 3 is the fifth overall GTA installment, but the third main game in the series.

GTA 3 is thought to be a turning point for the open-world gaming genre and was critically acclaimed for its 3D gameplay, concepts, and world map.

    "text": "Exigen a la Junta mantener el maestro de apoyo en Infantil en el CEIP San Francisco de Ciudad Rodrigo\nFernando Pablos defiende en las Cortes la necesidad de conservar cinco docentes en el centro, pese al descenso de matrículas, para garantizar la calidad educativa en zonas rurales\nEl PSOE de Salamanca ha registrado una iniciativa en las Cortes de Castilla y León para exigir a la Junta que rectifique y anule la supresión de dos plazas de maestro en el colegio San Francisco de Ciudad Rodrigo, medida comunicada recientemente por la Inspección Educativa.\nEl procurador socialista Fernando Pablos, firmante de la propuesta, respalda la postura de la comunidad educativa del centro, que acepta la pérdida de un docente por la reducción de matrícula en 3 años, pero rechaza de forma contundente la eliminación de la segunda plaza, correspondiente al maestro de apoyo en Educación Infantil.\nTanto el AMPA como las familias consideran este puesto esencial para garantizar una atención de calidad en una etapa tan delicada del desarrollo. Pablos subraya que el criterio de la Junta, que impide contar con maestro de apoyo cuando solo hay una línea, perjudica especialmente a las zonas rurales, donde esta situación es habitual.\nLa iniciativa socialista destaca además que la baja natalidad y la despoblación no deben conllevar una merma de recursos educativos, sino al contrario: deben compensarse con medidas que promuevan la igualdad y la cohesión territorial.\nPor ello, el PSOE exige que durante el próximo curso se mantengan al menos cinco de las seis plazas actuales, destinando una al apoyo en Infantil, y recuerda que “aunque solo exista un aula, esta necesita apoyo, sea en un pueblo o en una ciudad”.",
