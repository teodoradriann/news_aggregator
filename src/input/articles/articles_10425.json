    "text": "ROSEBURG, Ore. – A rededication ceremony for the Douglas County Veterans War Memorial was hosted by the Douglas County Board of Commissioners and local veterans groups on Wednesday at the Douglas County Courthouse, county officials said. Douglas County officials said that the memorial, which stands on the courthouse grounds and was first constructed in 1971, honors those Douglas County residents who died while serving their country. After receiving an Oregon Heritage Veterans and War Memorial grant from the state parks and recreation department in 2023, the memorial underwent a year-long renovation effort that began in September of last year, the county said. Officials said that the renovation project included replacement of four of its bronze plaques that commemorate fallen Douglas County veterans, refurbishment of the memorial grounds, a new Purple Heart memorial, new gold star and blue star bronze plaques, two new flag poles to display the POW/MIA flag, and beautification of the grounds around the memorial. Previously, a minor restoration project was done in 2007 but some repairs were left unfinished, county officials said. “Speaking on behalf of Commissioner Chris Boice, Commissioner Tom Kress, and myself, we dedicate this Douglas County Veterans War Memorial as a sacred place in Douglas County where veterans will gather to share experiences or sit alone where they can ponder thoughts of which they can never share with anyone,” said Commissioner Tim Freman, during his keynote speech at the ceremony. “Those who need to can use this memorial as a place of healing. We dedicate this memorial as a place where children will learn lessons of freedom from their parents and grandparents. We dedicate this memorial as a place where those coming after us will recognize our desire to acknowledge those who have sacrificed so much for our freedom, and they will be encouraged to place the same importance on this site as we do today. Thank you and May God Bless the United States of America.” Douglas County officials said that the commissioners also issued a proclamation during the ceremony declaring September 20 as POW/MIA Recognition Day in Douglas County. A live video recording of the ceremony can be found on Douglas County’s",

Police respond to ‘domestic assault’ call involving Miami star\nTyreek Hill's wife, Keeta, reportedly said she is filing for divorce\nMiami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill is in trouble again. Police were called after the 31-year-old was involved in a domestic dispute with his wife Keeta Hill, ABC affiliate WPLG reported, citing an incident report. According to the report, the NFL star was described as 'very aggressive and impulsive' by his wife's mother, Alesia Vaccaro.\nThe publication further added that Keeta said that she is ‘in the process of filing for a divorce’. Neither the Dolphins WR nor his wife have responded to these claims yet.\nTMZ Sports cited a Sunny Isles Beach Police Department incident report, to add that Keeta's mother told officers that she had called for emergency services after she saw Tyreek throw a computer to the floor. He also reportedly grabbed the couple's daughter. The two are parents to Zev Hill, twins Nakeem and Nyla Hill, Soul Corazon Hill, Tyreek D'Shaun Hill Jr., and Trae Love Hill.\nThe report further added that officers on the scene stated that Keeta told them that she and Tyreek had been arguing frequently and Monday's incident started with a comment that ‘he was not involved enough with their daughter’.\n\"That's when he got irritated,\" officers said Keeta told them. After the Miami Dolphins star ‘grabbed his daughter’, he said: “I have the same rights as a father as her as a mother, and I can take my baby whenever I want.” Officials, however, said that the ‘argument never became physical’.

    "text": "2023-12-28 09:21:56 After Corona, many people are drawn to the screen again. Film funding boss Peter Dinges explains what “Barbenheimer” has to do with it and why the numbers will probably still be below 2019. Berlin. People in Germany are drawn to the big screen more often again – but still less often than before the pandemic. “The cinemas are doing much better than expected,” said the board of directors of the Film Funding Agency (FFA), Peter Dinges. The film theaters have recovered significantly after the corona pandemic. “Cinema is on everyone’s lips again.” Final figures for 2023 will not be published until next year. So far it is foreseeable that the ticket numbers will not yet be at the pre-Corona level of 2019, but will be below it, said Dinges. In the first six months of this year, 45.2 million tickets were sold at the box office, as the FFA announced in its half-year balance sheet. In 2019 there were 53.7 million cinema tickets in the same period. In a dpa interview in January 2021, Dinges expected that there would be a cinema boom after the end of the pandemic. Did that come true? “If you look closely, there is a cinema boom,” emphasized the film funding boss. “We haven’t reached the previous numbers yet, but if we look at what the cinema has offered this year and how people have received the cinema, I think it’s a good start for the future.” Older moviegoers are still hesitant There were ticket numbers and sales that were higher than in 2019 in various months. People are coming back – but not as quickly as the industry had hoped. A closer look shows that young people were going to the cinema more again. Older people, on the other hand, would not yet come back as strongly as they did in 2019. There could be several reasons for this, said Dinges – such as higher prices and costs of living. This year you also had to dig deeper into your pockets when it came to ticket prices. The average admission price was over ten euros for the first time, as Dinges noted. That was in the first half of 2023. “This price has to be put into perspective in the context, because it was due to films like “Avatar” and “Guardians of the Galaxy”. For them there was a 3D and an extra length surcharge.” This had a significant impact on the average price. This has now fallen again. Cinema operators also felt higher energy costs and, in some cases, higher wage costs. According to Dinges, they would have to factor this into the admission price in some way in order to recoup the costs. Recipe for success from “Barbenheimer” Nevertheless, from his point of view, films this year were “unusual: unusually beautiful and unusually good.” For example, the two blockbusters “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” which were released in theaters on the same day in July. The neologism “Barbenheimer” quickly made the rounds. According to Media Control, the lurid satire with Margot Robbie as a stereotypical Barbie was the most visited in 2023. From Dinges’ point of view, it’s a phenomenon in summer – a time of year when people don’t actually like to go to the cinema that much. “What was particularly special about these films was the way they addressed the audience. This was an address via social media, which actually made the films a cult even before they were released.” In addition, both are crossover films, meaning they appeal to multiple target groups and are shown in multiplexes as well as in art house cinemas. Crossover films in general would have worked this year. “This is modern cinema. This is how people want to be addressed. It worked, and worked very, very well. That seems to me to be a recipe for the future.” Some blockbusters won’t be shown until 2025 because of Hollywood strikes Speaking of the future: Looking ahead to next year, some blockbusters may have to be compromised. Screenwriters and actors in Hollywood had been on strike for months – this has also led to delays in the delivery of films and their programming for 2024 in this country. “We will of course feel this in terms of the number of visitors. But: postponed does not mean lifted,” said Dinges. Films like the new part of “Mission Impossible” and “Avatar” will be on screens in 2025. Will the consequences of the strike mean that more German films will come to the fore? “German film and international film have actually always worked together,” explained Dinges. “If one is missing, the other has stepped forward.” This could already be seen during the pandemic, when many US blockbusters were not released and there was a “phenomenal” German market share.

    "text": "ABOGADOS CRISTIANOS\nDisolver el rezo ante Ferraz no fue un \"abuso de autoridad\" para la justicia\nEl jueza archiva la denuncia de Abogados Cristianos y recuerda que lo que se prohibió fue una concentración sin permiso, no un acto religioso\nAlberto Muñoz | Cristina Gallardo\nLa justicia no ve abuso de autoridad ni\nprevaricación en la orden de disolución del rezo del rosario por parte de la policía durante las manifestaciones frente a la sede del Partido Socialista en Ferraz. En un auto al que ha tenido acceso El Periódico de España, de Prensa Ibérica,, el juez Ángel José Lera, titular del juzgado de Instrucción Número 18 de Madrid, archiva las actuaciones a raíz de la denuncia presentada por Abogados Cristianos contra Francisco Martín, Delegado del Gobierno en la capital.\nLa asociación, por medio de su presidenta, Polonia Castellanos, fue muy contundente a finales de noviembre cuando anunció que iban a denunciar al político del\n[PSOE ](/tags/psoe/)y que no se dejarían \"amedrentar\" por la respuesta policial frente a las concentraciones: \"Este gobierno ha emprendido una auténtica persecución contra los cristianos; está llevando al calabozo a personas pacíficas por el simple hecho de rezar mientras elimina condenas de todo tipo a sus socios\".\nSin embargo, en ese auto la justicia deja claro que \"no existe una prohibición de rezar, sino un acuerdo de que no se celebre una concentración\". El motivo de que la policía interrumpiese esa concentración, dice el auto, no tiene que ver con qué se estaba haciendo en las concentraciones. Simplemente no se habían \"completado los plazos legales de comunicación\" a la\n[Delegación del Gobierno](/tags/delegacion-del-gobierno/). De hecho, deja la \"puerta abierta a una nueva convocatoria cumpliendo con ellos\".\nUna circunstancia que, por ejemplo, ya se dio el fin de semana pasado durante las elecciones autonómicas gallegas, cuando alrededor de un centenar de personas se congregaron entre las calles Ferraz y Marqués de Urquijo para rezar el rosario durante el recuento de los votos.\nNo ve prevaricación\nSegún explicó la asociación Abogados Cristianos en un comunicado fechado el pasado 28 de noviembre, ponía la denuncia por presunta prevaricación y abuso de autoridad del Delegado del Gobierno y no descartaba presentar también acciones judiciales contra la policía.\nSin embargo, el auto del pasado 18 de enero anticipa desde un principio que la denuncia de la asociación tenía pocos visos de prosperar, pues \"no es suficiente que una resolución administrativa no sea ajustada a derecho para que constituya un delito de prevaricación\". Es decir, que los hechos, en cualquier caso, no corresponderían a la vía penal, sino a la administrativa.\nPara que exista prevaricación, dice el juez, tiene que existir una voluntad de fondo de ejercer el poder de forma arbitraria a sabiendas de que no se está actuando conforme a derecho. Y eso, dice la justicia, no es lo que se observa en los hechos que tuvieron lugar frente a la sede del PSOE en el momento más encendido de las protestas. \"En un injustificado ejercicio de abuso de poder no es la mera ilegalidad lo que se sanciona [como prevaricación], sino la arbitrariedad\", resume la resolución.\nNacional Dos pisos en Benidorm y tres terrenos en Polop: las propiedades que despertaron las sospechas sobre el asesor de Ábalos https://www.informacion.es/nacional/2024/02/21/guardia-civil-detiene-asesor-exministro-98451481.html Corrupción en la compra de mascarillas: detenido un asesor del exministro Ábalos e investigación en Interior https://www.informacion.es/nacional/2024/02/22/historial-delictivo-koldo-garcia-izaguirre-98496246.html El historial delictivo de Koldo García Izaguirre, asesor de Ábalos, en Navarra https://www.informacion.es/sucesos/2024/02/21/guardia-civil-detiene-asesor-exministro-98453168.html https://www.informacion.es/sucesos/2024/02/21/guardia-civil-detiene-asesor-exministro-98453168.html https://www.informacion.es/nacional/2024/02/22/koldo-asesor-abalos-declaracion-comisiones-mascarillas-98496377.html El asesor de Ábalos queda en libertad pero el juez le prohíbe salir de España https://www.informacion.es/nacional/2024/02/22/ayuso-apunta-sanchez-caso-koldo-98499749.html Ayuso apunta a Sánchez por el 'caso Koldo': \"De portero de prostíbulo a asesor de un ministro, lo normal https://www.informacion.es/nacional/2024/02/23/empresa-trama-koldo-asesor-abalos-ministerio-transportes-98546011.html La empresa de la ‘trama Koldo’ recurrió al asesor de Ábalos para \"agilizar trámites\" en el Ministerio de Transportes https://www.informacion.es/nacional/2024/02/21/koldo-garcia-izaguirre-asesor-abalos-98464238.html Koldo\n ",
