    "text": "More cases, additional death reported in nationwide Boar's Head deli meat listeria outbreak Mary Walrath-Holdridge USA TODAY Show Caption\nHide Caption\nWhy food recalls are increasing E.Coli, metal and even a dead bat have been found in recalled food. In fact, food recalls are increasing. Yet, that might actually be a good sign. Here's why. USA TODAY The Boar's Head deli meat recall linked to a multi-state listeria outbreak has reportedly caused at least one more death and 10 new hospitalizations since late July. The additional cases come as health officials continue to investigate the outbreak that has caused at least three deaths, hospitalized at least another 40 people across 13 states and spawned multiple lawsuits. Boar's Head has recalled 71 products since July 26, equating to about 7.2 million pounds of deli meats.\nThe Boar's Head deli meat recall linked to a multi-state listeria outbreak has reportedly caused at least one more death and 10 new hospitalizations since late July, according to an update released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\nThe additional cases come as health officials continue to investigate the outbreak that has caused at least three deaths, hospitalized at least another 40 people across 13 states and spawned multiple lawsuits.\nSince the last wave of information was shared on July 31 , the number of affected people has continued to grow, with the most recent death occurring in Virginia. Nine additional cases of illness were also reported, bringing the total up to 43, all of whom ended up hospitalized, the CDC said Thursday.\nBoar's Head has recalled 71 products since July 26 , equating to about 7.2 million pounds of deli meats. The brand is also facing legal action, with at least one class-action suit on the books as of early August.\nHere's the most up-to-date information on the recall.\nListeria lawsuits: Boar's Head listeria outbreak triggers lawsuit against deli meat company in New York\nWhat Boar's Head products are recalled? Boar’s Head initially announced a recall for 207,528 pounds of liverwurst and other deli meats on July 26, followed by an expanded recall on July 30 to include over 7 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products.\nIn a July 30 statement from the company, Boar’s Head said that it initiated the expanded recall of all products produced at its Jarratt, Virginia facility after it learned that its Strassburger Brand Liverwurst had been linked to the national listeria outbreak.\nBoar’s Head Ready-to-Eat liverwurst products recalled\nProduced between June 11, 2024 and July 17, 2024, and have a 44-day shelf-life “Boar’s Head Strassburger Brand Liverwurst made in Virginia” 3.5-pound loaves in plastic casing, or various weight packages sliced in retail delis Sell-by dates range from July 25, 2024, to August 30, 2024\nOther Boar’s Head deli meat products\nBoar’s Head also recalled all deli products, including prepackaged deli products. Look for “EST. 12612” or “P-12612” inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels.\nMulti-state listeria outbreak kills three A listeria outbreak linked to sliced deli meat has led to 43 hospitalizations and three deaths in 13 states, according to an ongoing investigation by the CDC and U.S. Department of Agriculture. These numbers are up from the two deaths and 33 hospitalizations reported in late July.\nThe ages of the sick people range between 32 and 94, with the median being 75, CDC data showed. The three deaths were reported in Illinois, New Jersey and Virginia.\nThe CDC and USDA are currently aware of 13 states with infections as a result of the outbreak.\nThese states include:\nNew York: 14 Maryland: 8 New Jersey: 4 Massachusetts: 3 Missouri: 3 Virginia: 3 Georgia: 2 Minnesota: 1 Wisconsin: 1 Illinois: 1 Pennsylvania: 1 North Carolina: 1 Indiana: 1\nListeriosis or listeria poisoning symptoms Listeriosis, or listeria poisoning, is a foodborne bacterial infection most commonly caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. It is considered a serious condition and can be dangerous or life-threatening, especially to older adults, people with weak immune systems and pregnant women.\nAccording to the USDA, symptoms include:\nFever Muscle aches Headache Stiff neck Confusion Loss of balance Convulsions Diarrhea Other gastrointestinal symptoms Miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery and/or life-threatening infection of newborn infants Death People in higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food, said the USDA.\nWhat to do to stay safe The CDC advises people who are pregnant, 65 or older, or have weakened immune systems to take extra precautions to avoid becoming ill.\nAt-risk individuals should do as follows:\nDo not eat recalled deli meats. Throw them away or contact stores about returns. In addition, do not eat any other deli meats you get sliced at deli counters, unless it is reheated to an internal temperature of 165°F or until steaming hot. Let it cool before you eat it. Listeria can grow on foods kept in the refrigerator, but it is easily killed by heating food to a high enough temperature. Clean your refrigerator, containers and surfaces that may have touched sliced deli meats. This is especially important if you purchased any of the recalled deli products. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms: People who are not pregnant usually have fever, muscle aches, and tiredness. They may also get a headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or seizures. Pregnant people usually have fever, muscle aches, and tiredness. However, Listeria can cause pregnancy loss or premature birth. It can also cause serious illness or death in newborns.\nOne of the best ways to avoid listeriosis is to avoid foods that have not been properly stored or that may be more prone to carrying listeria bacteria. People who are at high risk, such as pregnant women and children, should avoid eating the following :\nUnpasteurized soft cheeses, such as queso fresco and brie. Unheated cheeses sliced at a deli. Unheated deli meat, cold cuts, hot dogs, and fermented or dry sausages. Premade deli salads, such as coleslaw and potato, tuna, or chicken salad. Refrigerated pâté or meat spreads. Refrigerated smoked fish. Raw or lightly cooked sprouts. Cut melon left out for more than 2 hours. One hour if it’s exposed to temperatures hotter than 90 degrees. Cut melon in refrigerator for more than a week. Raw (unpasteurized) milk, yogurt, and ice cream.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

    "title": "The 'Hello Girls' arrived in Europe before the first Doughboys. Here's why they were so crucial",
    "text": "With her book The Hello Girls and a follow-up documentary film, historian, commentator and author Elizabeth Cobbs set out to recognize the women who served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps’ Female Telephone Operators Unit during World War I. Members of the unit, many of whom worked Stateside as switchboard operators, maintained communications on the Western Front under spartan and sometimes hazardous conditions. Despite having served in uniform, however, the Hello Girls were denied veteran status. Though Congress remedied that in 1977, many of them had died by then. Recently lawmakers introduced legislation to formally honor the unit with the Congressional Gold Medal, presented for distinguished achievements that have had a major impact on American his-tory and culture. Past recipients include notable American warriors and military units. Cobbs recently spoke with Military History about her book and why the\nHello Girls are deserving of recognition.\nWho were the ‘Hello Girls’?\nThey were a group of 223 young women—some in their teens, most in their 20s and a few “old women” in their 30s—who volunteered at the request of the U.S. Army to go to France and run the telephone system. This was a daring thing. Most soldiers hadn’t even gone yet. These women were in logistics. The Army needed telephone operators over there before the majority of doughboys. They had to facilitate what was happening at the front, to get supplies, to get troops shipped here and there. Some served as long as two years. These women fielded 26 million calls for the Army in France. A handful traveled with\n[General [John J.] Pershing]https://www.historynet.com/pershing-makes-army/ during the big battles of Meuse-Argonne and Saint-Mihiel. Others served at the headquarters of the American First Army, which was close to the front but not in the war zone. They came from all over—from Washington state, down to Louisiana, up to Maine, even Canada. There were some French-Canadian women who volunteered and served with the U.S. Army.\nMany served close to or on the front lines. Were any killed or wounded?\nNone were killed in action, but some did suffer permanent injuries, mostly from tuberculosis, which was common in northern France. Two died from the influenza pandemic, one on Armistice Day, Nov. 11, 1918.\nThe conditions of World War I were pretty difficult, especially related to the weather these women had to endure in fairly exposed accommodations. Some were under bombardment. Some were in buildings where artillery concussions blew out windows. Once, they were told to evacuate but wouldn’t leave until the soldiers had. These women worked around the clock, especially the supervisors. Chief Operator Grace Banker, who led the first unit, recorded in her diary at the start of an offensive, “I slept two hours today.” They were handling incredibly complex logistical problems near the front lines. They got no breaks; they worked seven days a week, 12-hour shifts for several months during the worst part of the American war effort. It was extremely stressful. Some were close enough to the front lines that their switchboards shook during bombardments.\nOf course, these women crossed the ocean to get to Europe in the first place. This was a time when troopships were being sunk. All of these women knew about this, and they were constantly told to use their lifejackets as pillows and wear all of their clothes to bed in case they were torpedoed. It was scary.\nWhat kind of training did they receive?\nThey went through a very strict recruitment and training. They had to be bilingual in French and English, and many washed out because of that. In fact, 7,600 women applied for the first 100 positions. Many were cut for language reasons, others because they weren’t fast enough on the phone. Once selected, they were vetted extremely carefully, sometimes three and four times, by Army intelligence. These women were literally handling national secrets in the wires they connected. One woman was even pulled off a ship at the last minute, though she turned out to not be the German spy they feared she was.\nOnce selected, they were trained by AT&T [American Telephone and Telegraph] on the phone system. After that they were sent to New York City, where they were drilled and learned to salute on the rooftop of AT&T headquarters. Once they went to France, the women who were sent toward the front were trained in the use of gas masks and pistols. They wore uniforms and had dog tags; otherwise, they risked being executed as spies if captured. They were told again and again that their uniforms and dog tags were their protection as soldiers of the U.S. Army.\nMany were bilingual. How important was that skill?\nThe first group of 100 female volunteers were all required to be absolutely fluent in French and English. They had these super strict tests, where they had to simultaneously translate and operate a telephone exchange, record everything correctly and communicate accurately under pressure. It’s hard for us to appreciate today how nerve-racking that could be. They were getting hundreds of calls an hour, all of them critically important, truly a matter of life and death. These women felt a great deal of responsibility. They were connecting all kinds of calls, such as between commanders and combat units in the field. There were times when they were even talking with French combat troops. The Army set up its own PBX [private branch exchange] telephone system for communications to and from the front. However, the women often had to connect with French lines and French toll operators. Back then, a toll call would be passed from operator to operator to operator. This was a problem for the American doughboys, who generally did not parlez-vous. Pershing realized he couldn’t get a call to go anywhere, so that’s when they realized they needed people who could do the job and communicate with the Allies at the same time.\nWhy were women selected as operators?\nThe Army found it took men 60 seconds on average to connect calls that women connected in 10 seconds. In wartime that was the difference between life and death—for an individual and sometimes for whole battalions. Women were adept at using this technology and had the ability to do it much faster and more reliably than men. They were tested on being able to place calls in two languages, write and convey messages, make life-and-death connections in an instant, all while maintaining their composure and decorum.\nBanker received the Distinguished Service Medal. What did she do to earn such recognition?\nChief operator for the Signal Corps, Banker was a remarkable person who was devoted to the American cause during World War I. She led the first female contingent under very challenging and difficult circumstances. At one point she developed a severe allergic rash. A doctor told her she needed to have it taken care of, but she said she didn’t have time. There’s a photo of her in which she looked absolutely terrible. Grace served under the extraordinarily demanding conditions of the Battles of Saint-Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne and was recognized for courageous service. In World War I the U.S. Army awarded only 18 Distinguished Service Medals to Signal Corps officers, of whom 16,000 were eligible. All the honorees were listed by rank. She was listed as “Miss,” because she was a [single] woman.\nWhy did the War Department deny the ‘Hello Girls’ veteran status?\nTheir commanding officers begged and pleaded with the War Department to recognize these women who had served alongside them, some in very dire circumstances. Around 11,000 women served with the Navy and Marines during World War I, and every one of them got military benefits, including hospitalization for disabilities. They all served at home in the United States. Only the Army sent women across the ocean into harm’s way, and then denied them veteran status. It was so upsetting and maddening for these women. They were told it would lessen the importance of the meaning of “veteran” if they were to grant women this honor. The Army decided early in the war these women would be contract employees. However, they neither told the vast majority of women, nor gave them any to sign. In fact, women took the same soldier’s oath everybody else did. They wore uniforms but were unaware there was a distinction. Many of the women were flabbergasted when they arrived home and found out they weren’t veterans.\nCongress finally recognized them as veterans in 1977. How did that come about?\nTheir recognition came on the same legislation as the WASPs [Women Airforce Service Pilots], introduced by Senator Barry Goldwater. Goldwater had also been a service pilot in World War II and couldn’t believe that\nwomen he’d served with, many who wore the same uniform as him, were not being given veteran benefits. At that time the women of World War I came forward and said, “What about us?” The legislation then covered both groups.\nWhy award the Hello Girls the Congressional Gold Medal after so many decades?\nBecause it’s a story that was lost. I’ve met so many women in the Army who’ve said they had no idea this is where their story began. Women today represent 15 percent of the armed forces. It’s a very brave act for any woman to join an organization in which she is going to be in the distinct minority and going against gender expectations. It’s important to say we value female veterans as much as we value male veterans. The Congressional Gold Medal would help all Americans better appreciate the women in our armed services. It would help us recognize that what the Hello Girls did was not only physically courageous, but morally courageous—challenging every social convention at the time in order to help our country. It took a very special person to do that. They performed a heroic service.\nThis interview appeared in the Autumn 2023 issue of Military History magazine.\nhistorynet magazines\nOur 9 best-selling history titles feature in-depth storytelling and iconic imagery to engage and inform on the people, the wars, and the events that shaped America and the world.",

    "title": "​​神州数码AI实践再度入选顶级国际商学院案例库，助力全球企业构建新增长曲线 - 中国日报网",
    "text": "​​在前不久闭幕的2025亚太AI大会上，欧洲工商管理学院（INSEAD）与神州数码联合发布首个AI案例《塑造未来，神州数码从数字化迈向AI驱动型组织的转型之路》。该案例系统阐释了神州数码在企业数字化转型方面的实践历程，并融入了其基于“AI驱动的数云融合”战略框架的最新探索成果，旨在为全球企业在AI时代进行管理创新与组织变革提供了借鉴。\n​​数据资产：企业价值评估的新“标尺”\n神州数码董事长郭为在演讲中指出，AI时代的企业竞争已从传统资源（如厂房、设备）转向数据资产的积累与运营。“工业化时代的企业价值由固定资产定义，而数字化企业的估值核心在于数据资产的规模和质量。”\n郭为强调，企业的运行和发展，是业务模式、技术范式和管理方法三大要素不断相互影响、进化所产生的结果，这个相互作用和影响的过程，就构成了企业进化或企业成长的飞轮。在AI的时代，在数云融合的时代，企业不仅仅要做到全面感知、快速决策、持续优化，而且要基于数据资产的形成，把每一个企业所掌握的天然禀赋演化成企业新的增长点。他表示：“在AI与数云融合的时代浪潮下，借助数据资产的形成，企业可将自身所掌握的天然禀赋转化为新的增长点，推动企业在激烈的市场竞争中脱颖而出，这给每个企业都带来了全新机会。”\n数云融合：企业AI就绪的“前提”\n为助力企业通过数据资产与天然禀赋构建新增长曲线并实现价值变现，神州数码提出了“AI驱动的数云融合”技术架构。这一架构是企业实现数据资产累积和AI就绪的前提。基于云的环境，企业的数据可以在一个平台内自由流动，进而实现数据要素随时随地的重新编排，快速敏捷响应外部环境和客户需求的实时变化，进而实现企业在数字时代的转型蜕变。\n“神州数码内部已部署6-7个AI智能体（Agent），用于自动化招投标盖章、数据分析等任务，”郭为透露，“效率提升达90%以上。”\n“数据资产的复用性极强，一次采集可服务于多个业务场景。”郭为强调。\n从案例到赋能：全球化的中国实践​​\n此次与INSEAD联合发布AI案例，是继与哈佛大学商学院、伦敦商学院合作之后，神州数码第三次携手国际顶尖商学院合作发布相关案例。\nINSEAD教授及战略系主任陈国立指出：“该案例不仅是对神州数码AI转型方法论的高度认可，也是希望给全球学术界提供更为丰富研究素材，助力丰富和完善全球数字化转型与AI应用的理论体系，形成‘中国实践’与‘全球学界’的重要链接节点。”\n值得关注的是，神州数码也已经将自身对于AI 的理解和实践，转化为赋能企业AI场景落地的工具和平台。其推出的神州问学平台，不仅可以为企业提供从算力、模型、数据、到应用的全栈AI服务能力，也能作为企业Agent中台，管理海量AI智能体的协作。“未来每个企业都需要基于通用的模型构建自身专属的模型。”郭为表示，神州数码正在为千行百业的企业提供专业的全栈AI产品与服务，助力其完成AI时代的数字化转型，帮助其构建新的增长曲线，实现价值创新。\n由此可见，神州数码的目标或许就是成为企业第二增长曲线的“孵化器”。\n展望：AI时代的长期主义​​\n面对AI落地过程中的挑战，郭为呼吁企业保持耐心，技术革命需要工匠精神。\n“其中最大的挑战在于如何构建正确的认知。当前，外部舆论环境对于AI抱有极大的热情，但AI在企业实际场景的落地还处于初级阶段。这种差异容易引发疲劳和焦虑……我们时常担心企业推进相关应用的速度过于缓慢。”\n他以集成电路发展史为例，强调数据治理、流程重构等基础工作的重要性。“从最初半导体的发现到如今的成就，这个过程历经了上百年的时间。因此，对于任何一项技术的发展，我们都需要坚持‘工匠精神’和保有足够的定力。”郭为表示。\n随着该案例进入INSEAD 案例库和MBA课堂，世界各地的学员将有机会学习到中国企业在AI驱动的数字化转型方面的实践经验和方法论，对于如何以数据资产与天然禀赋为支点，挖掘全球化市场的新增长机遇有新的认识。正如陈国立教授所言：“这不仅是商业模式的创新，更是一场关于企业如何重新定义自身价值的革命。”\n（中国日报北京记者站 杜娟）",
