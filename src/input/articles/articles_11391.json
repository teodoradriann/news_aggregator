    "text": "LOS ANGELES - Engaging with dogs through playful interactions or watching their endearing videos on social media could indicate a beneficial practice.\nA recent study published in the journal PLOS One suggests that such activities might enhance individuals&apos; brainwave patterns linked to rest and relaxation, as evidenced by neurological assessments.\nFor the study, researchers focused on discerning the impact of specific activities on mood, rather than merely general interactions with dogs. This was achieved through a combination of objective measurements of brain activity and subjective assessments of participants&apos; emotions.\n30 healthy adults, around the age of 28, were recruited from pet salons and a dog grooming school in Seongnam, South Korea, during May and June 2022.\nIn a subdued environment within a local grooming academy, each participant engaged in eight activities with a 4-year-old, well-trained, female standard poodle owned by the study’s principal investigator. These activities encompassed meeting, playing, feeding, massaging, grooming, photographing, hugging, and walking the dog.\nRELATED: Your dog may have ‘better health’ outcome if it has a friend, study finds\n(File: boytsov / iStock / Getty Images Plus)\nPrior to commencing the activities, participants sat and gazed at the wall for three minutes to minimize potential external influences. The authors recorded participants’ brain waves during each activity via electroencephalogram tests (EEGs) for three minutes.\nEEGs are noninvasive tests that measure brain electrical activity using small metal discs called electrodes affixed to the scalp.\nResearchers found that various activities yielded different impacts on participants&apos; brain waves.\nPlaying and walking with a dog notably amplified the intensity of alpha-band oscillations, commonly indicating a state of stability and relaxation. This type of brainwave activity correlates with enhanced memory function and diminished mental stress, as outlined in the study.\nEngaging in grooming, play, and gentle massaging of the dog corresponded with heightened beta-band oscillations, typically linked to increased attention and concentration. Moreover, participants reported feeling significantly less depressed, stressed, and exhausted following interaction with the poodle.\nRELATED: Watch this adorable rescued sea otter show off her basketball skills: &apos;Clam dunk!&apos;",

    "text": "2023 could likely be viewed as a coming-of-age story for our Neanderthal cousins, as they further shed their brutish image, revealing themselves as skilled hunters and surprising artisans. We learned so much about the Neanderthals capabilities, that some researchers even started to question whether they were really a separate species to us! So let’s dive in to some of the biggest discoveries in human evolution from 2023… [The Oldest Art in the World Wasn’t Made By Homo sapiens](https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/oldest-neanderthal-art-0017811) One of the most hotly debated questions in the history of Neanderthal research has been whether they created art. In the past few years, the consensus has become that they did, sometimes. But, like their relations at either end of the hominid evolutionary tree, chimpanzees and Homo sapiens, Neanderthals’ behavior varied culturally from group to group and over time. … [Neanderthals Hunted Elephants Twice the Weight of Modern Ones](https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-evolution-human-origins/neanderthal-elephant-hunt-0019976) Evidence has emerged from Germany dated to 125,000 years ago showing Neanderthals hunted elephants twice the size of contemporaneous ones. … [Reevaluating Neanderthals: Are They Actually the Same Species as Us?](https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-evolution-human-origins/neanderthal-species-0019644) [Neanderthals](https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/neanderthals-cared-each-other-and-survived-old-age-new-research-009871) have been recognized as a species distinct from modern humans for quite some time. But if a trio of researchers from universities in Portugal, Italy and Spain get their way, this designation may soon change. These archaeologists believe Neanderthals were not a different species at all but instead were simply another variety of humans, a conclusion that they draw after completing an analysis of the ingenious way that Neanderthals used fire to satisfy their survival needs.",

    "title": "Governor issues emergency proclamation over condominium insurance rates | Hawai'i Public Radio",
    "text": "The proclamation would allow the state to loan up to $60 million in general funds to the Hawaiʻi Hurricane Relief Fund and the Hawaiʻi Property Insurance Association to issue insurance policies. It would also allow the Hawaiʻi Hurricane Relief Fund to issue hurricane insurance again, which it has not done since the early 2000s. The idea would be to use these loans to help alleviate pressure for condo owners in the short-term, without dipping into the about $160 million Hurricane Relief Fund, which has acted as part of the state’s reserve funds for the past two decades. The proclamation is based on recommendations from the Insurance Task Force, which Speaker Scott Saiki co-chairs. “It's really meant to be a temporary stopgap measure that will provide some limited relief to condo buildings by giving them one layer of potential insurance coverage that they would otherwise have to obtain through a foreign source,” Saiki said. “So this is just meant to provide a layer of coverage that condo buildings can access,” he said. Foreign sources of coverage are extremely expensive. So the insurance policies permitted through the emergency proclamation are closer to the market rate. Saiki added that other types of residences, not just condos, have started seeing dramatic increases in property insurance — which is why the task force recommended that the governor issue an emergency proclamation. There was a measure that failed last legislative session that would have used the Hurricane Relief Fund as a mechanism to provide state-backed insurance policies for condominiums. Saiki said that it is an option the task force is considering recommending next year. Buildings can contact the Insurance Division of the Department of Consumer Affairs to apply for hurricane coverage or the Hawaiʻi Property Insurance Association for other property insurance policies.",

Around the same (52%) say they feel the drinks spiking epidemic is on the rise, just as the UK festival season begins and young people attend post school and university exam parties.\nIt also found the majority (85%) of adults think people are likely to get spiked in a nightclub, 52% at a festival and 50% at a pub.\nBut, according to CounterSpike, 35% say that they have been spiked in a nightclub, 30% in a pub and only 8% at a festival.\nMike said the gender split might also surprise people.\n\"Even more men are being spiked than before, which is for robbery, as well as other factors,\" he said.\n\"Because it's so easy to pull someone's phone out of their pocket after they've been spiked, hold it over their face to open their phone, and then you've got access to their bank accounts.\"\nThe organisation also asked people what would make them feel safer from the risks of spiking.\n45% said more obvious CCTV inside venues, 38% said anti-spiking tests at the bar, and 25% said shelves in toilets for drinks.\nHear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour, every hour, on Greatest Hits Radio on DAB, smartspeaker, at greatesthitsradio.co.uk, and on the Rayo app.",

    "title": "Cognizant führt AI Training Data Services ein, um die Entwicklung von KI-Modellen auf Unternehmensebene zu beschleunigen",
    "text": "TEANECK, N.J., 31. Juli 2025\nCognizant ist ein Partner für das Training von Daten- und KI-Modellen, dem große Digital-Native-Pioniere seit langem vertrauen, um einige der fortschrittlichsten KI/ML-Modelle der Welt zu trainieren.\nTEANECK, N.J., 31. Juli 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cognizant (NASDAQ: CTSH) Cognizant gab heute den Start von AI Training Data Services bekannt, einem neuen Angebot, das Unternehmen bei der Erstellung, Feinabstimmung und Implementierung von KI-Modellen in kürzester Zeit und in großem Umfang unterstützt. Cognizant nutzt seine langjährige Erfahrung als Daten- und KI-Modell-Trainingspartner für ausgewählte Digital-Native-Pioniere und stellt sein Fachwissen Kunden aus den Global 2000 zur Verfügung, um KI-Innovationen voranzutreiben.\nDer Bedarf des Marktes an sauberen, relevanten Trainingsdaten ist von entscheidender Bedeutung für Unternehmen, die KI-gestützte Anwendungen entwickeln und generative und agentengestützte KI einsetzen wollen. Die begrenzte Verfügbarkeit großer, genau kommentierter Datensätze kann einen erheblichen Engpass für das Training von Machine-Learning-Modellen darstellen, insbesondere für Large Language Models (LLM) und Computer-Vision-Systeme. Multimodale Daten, die Text, Bilder, Audio und mehr umfassen, sind besonders wertvoll, da sie Modelle in die Lage versetzen, komplexe Szenarien zu bewältigen, die Kontext aus verschiedenen Datenformen erfordern.\nDie AI Training Data Services von Cognizant sind ein strategisches Angebot, das es Unternehmen ermöglicht, KI-Modelle schnell zu erstellen, fein abzustimmen, zu validieren und in großem Umfang einzusetzen, und zwar in Übereinstimmung mit der internen Governance und Aufsicht des Unternehmens. Sie vereinen Fachwissen in den Bereichen Data Engineering und KI-Schulung mit fundiertem Fach- und Branchenwissen, um multimodale Daten in qualitativ hochwertige Inputs für maschinelles Lernen und generative KI-Modelle zu verwandeln. Diese Dienstleistungen umfassen Datenkommentierung, Modellanpassung und -erweiterung sowie Data Governance und sollen Unternehmen in die Lage versetzen, die Markteinführung zu beschleunigen, die Modellgenauigkeit und -leistung zu erhöhen und die Kosten zu senken.\nSeit Jahren unterstützt Cognizant führende Unternehmen der digitalen Welt beim Training einiger der weltweit fortschrittlichsten KI-Modelle. Das Unternehmen hat mit Vorreitern in den Bereichen Technologie, Gesundheitswesen, Automobil, Medien und Einzelhandel zusammengearbeitet. Die mehr als 10.000 Expertinnen und Experten von Cognizant haben Milliarden von Datenpunkten und Millionen von Datenetiketten für jede wichtige Modalität – einschließlich Sprache, 2D/3D-Bilder, Video und Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) – kommentiert und qualitätsgeprüft, oft angereichert mit geografischen Metadaten für zusätzliche Genauigkeit. Dank seines Fachwissens kann Cognizant hochpräzise, spezialisierte Datensätze für die Bereiche Gesundheitswesen, Automobilindustrie, Medien, digitales Marketing und mehr erstellen.\n„Wir bei Cognizant sind bestrebt, unsere Kunden dabei zu unterstützen, ihre KI-Innovationen im großen Maßstab zu beschleunigen. Mit der Einführung von AI Training Data Services fördern wir dieses Engagement und stellen Unternehmen die hochwertigen, multimodalen Daten zur Verfügung, die sie für die Entwicklung anspruchsvoller KI-Lösungen benötigen\", so Ravi Kumar S., CEO von Cognizant. „Durch die Nutzung dieser speziellen Fähigkeit, die wir gemeinsam mit digitalen Innovatoren entwickelt haben, machen wir einen bedeutenden Schritt nach vorn bei der Unterstützung der KI-Transformation für unsere G2000-Kunden in verschiedenen Branchen.\"\nDie AI Training Data Services von Cognizant bieten verschiedene Kernfunktionen, wie z. B.:\n„Unternehmen sind bestrebt, KI zu operationalisieren, aber viele werden durch Datenschulden (Data Debt) gebremst – eine anhaltende Belastung durch fragmentierte, qualitativ schlechte oder unzugängliche Daten, die die Entwicklung effektiver KI-Modelle einschränken\", so Saurabh Gupta, President, Research & Advisory Services bei HFS Research. „Cognizant stellt sich dieser Herausforderung, indem es sein gesamtes Leistungsspektrum – Business Services, IT-Expertise, Engineering Excellence und Ökosystempartnerschaften – zu einer schlanken, auf den Branchenkontext abgestimmten Lösung zusammenführt. Die KI-Trainingsdatenservices vereinen tiefgreifendes Fachwissen mit fortschrittlichen Datenentwicklungs- und Schulungsfähigkeiten und sind ein Beispiel für den Services-as-Software-Ansatz, der Unternehmen dabei hilft, die Datenbereitschaftslücke zu schließen und in einer KI-getriebenen Welt wettbewerbsfähig zu bleiben.\"\n„Unternehmen versuchen heute, generative und agentenbasierte KI in großem Umfang einzusetzen. Diese Technologien versprechen, Geschäftsmodelle zu verändern, indem sie einen viel höheren Grad an End-to-End-Automatisierung und damit effizientere und effektivere Abläufe ermöglichen\", sagt Anil Vijayan, Partner bei der Everest Group. „Je größer diese werden, desto größer wird der Bedarf an umfassenden und vielfältigen Daten, die die Erstellung von KI-Modellen beschleunigen, die Präzision der Modelle verbessern und die Einhaltung von Vorschriften unterstützen. Die AI Training Data Services von Cognizant mit ihrer Erfolgsbilanz sind in diesem Bereich von großem Wert.\"\nWeitere Informationen über Cognizants AI Training Data Services finden Sie auf der Webseite des Unternehmens, auf die Sie über diesen Linkgelangen.\nInformationen zu Cognizant\nCognizant (Nasdaq-100: CTSH) entwickelt moderne Unternehmen.
