    "text": "Czechia's Second-Largest City Is A Wildly Underrated Foodie Gem With Youthful Vibes And Historic Charm\nCzechia's capital, Prague, is a world-renowned vacation destination and a stunning example of Middle-European elegance and sophistication. With its charming historical center and ancient Jewish quarter, combined with its dramatic castle, beautiful Baroque architecture, an endless supply of Gothic churches, and picturesque bridges over the Vltava, it is easy to see why it is such a popular destination and one of the best places in Europe to visit during the winter.\nBut Prague's popularity is also its undoing. Crowds of tourists, particularly bachelor parties drawn by its affordable nightlife and the best beer in Europe, can make visiting \"the City of a Hundred Spires\" a less delightful experience. However, travelers to Czechia shouldn't despair, as Prague is not the only destination in this excellent country that is worth a look. Located about 125 miles southeast of Prague, Czechia's second-largest city is a staggeringly underrated spot with an incredible food scene, a vibrant and youthful atmosphere, and bags of historical charm, without the crowds that can make the capital less appealing.\nBrno is unusual, fun, and full of surprises. While it offers a huge helping of the same classic Baroque beauty and fascinating history as Prague, it combines them with some wonderful modernist design, as well as a more playful, quirky atmosphere that makes this off-the-radar gem a true delight to explore. Much like Košice in neighboring Slovakia, Brno is an underrated, uncrowded, affordable gem that's well worth a visit.\nFind quirky clocks, unusual public art, and pioneering modern architecture in Brno\nFor visitors looking for a similar experience to a trip to Prague, it is best to start in Brno's old town. The Old Town Hall is a Gothic marvel, the oldest non-religious building in the city, with a wonderful selection of myths and legends attached, including its stuffed crocodile which is said to be the \"dragon\" that once terrorized the city. Its 207-foot observation tower offers amazing panoramic views of the city. Špilberk Castle and the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul dominate the skyline and are definitely worth visiting, while the eccentric, bullet-shaped Astronomical Clock adds a touch of whimsy and interactive enjoyment to any visit.\nBrno is blessed with a wonderful array of public art, and the city is dedicated to installing alternative, unusual sculptures and statues that offer excellent insight into its unique character. It is worth seeking out \"Courage\" by Jaroslav Róna, a knight astride a horse teetering on overly long legs, to discover its surprisingly risqué design. The city is also full of great museums, with the Museum of Romani Culture being a particular highlight. This sensitive and informative institution provides an exceptional celebration of Romani culture and art and is designed to push back against the centuries of discrimination that the community has suffered.\nAlongside its brilliant historical attractions, Brno is a haven for fans of modern architecture. Often lauded as one of the first examples of modern architecture in Europe, the Vila Tugendhat is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as the setting for the declarations that split the former Czechoslovakia in two to create Czechia and Slovakia.\nGreat food and a town that comes alive after dark\nNot only is Brno a picturesque, historical place to explore but it is also an eclectic, vibrant, and exciting destination for foodies and fun lovers. It is a university town with a large student population of around 60,000, which creates an exciting, progressive atmosphere and means there are always plenty of options for a great night out.\nEating out in Eastern Europe can sometimes be a bit monotonous, with a focus on rich, heavy meat dishes and plenty of potatoes, pickles, and cabbage. Brno defies these stereotypes with a wide selection of interesting and forward-thinking drinking and dining options, from hipster-style lunchtime cafes like Skøg to more food-orientated evening proposals like Soul Bistro.\nThere are some great places to soak up the lively ambiance after dark, too, with some excellent cocktail bars like 4pokoje and The Bar That Does Not Exist. Jakubské náměstí (St. James Square) is a great outdoor spot to hang out with locals, while clubs like Fléda, Metro Music Bar, and Šelepova No. 1 are ideal choices for anyone who wants to extend a night out.",

    "text": "El sindicato CCOO ha mantenido este jueves un encuentro con los grupos municipales del PP, PSOE e IU en el Ayuntamiento para abordar la situación de la Gerencia de Urbanismo en el que ha reclamado la \"protección del servicio público\". El sindicato ha trasladado sus \"inquietudes\" sobre las decisiones que el gobierno municipal está tomando en esta área, en especial la externalización de licencias urbanísticas, algo que interpreta que tiene un \"afán privatizador\". Al encuentro han asistido el secretario de Política Institucional de CCOO de Sevilla, Jorge Carlos Lebrón; el secretario de Acción Sindical de CCOO de Sevilla, Sergio Montero, y los delegados de la Sección Sindical de CCOO en la Gerencia de Urbanismo Juan Serrano y Norberto Gómez, respectivamente. Lebrón ha llamado la atención sobre la \"deriva presupuestaria que la Gerencia está sufriendo en los últimos años y que hace que cada vez se ejecute menos presupuesto del previsto\". Igualmente, Lebrón ha asegurado en una nota de prensa que se ha detectado \"un afán privatizador, como el anuncio por parte del gobierno municipal de externalizar las licencias urbanísticas a través de los colegios profesionales, una decisión que, basada en la falsa premisa de que la gestión privada es más eficiente que la pública, llevará aparejada un aumento de los costes, una reducción de la calidad y un empeoramiento de las condiciones laborales\". A juicio de CCOO, éste es \"un hecho muy grave, ya que supone encargar a manos privadas la concesión y el estudio de licencias urbanísticas en la ciudad. Es decir, el control previo al inicio de la ejecución de obras, control de ejecución o de comprobación de las ejecutadas, que siempre han sido funciones realizadas por personal de la Gerencia y que, con este acuerdo, pasan a ser realizadas por personal externo, mientras el Ayuntamiento no cubre las plazas disponibles con personal funcionario, adelgazando así cada vez las funciones de la Gerencia\". Todas estas cuestiones, a juicio de CCOO, \"ponen en peligro el futuro del organismo\" y, al mismo tiempo, \"suponen un claro perjuicio a la ciudanía sevillana, que ve menoscabado su derecho a recibir un servicio público esencial\". En este sentido, Lebrón ha instado a que \"se realicen políticas de urbanismo que sirvan para que la ciudad sea cada vez más inclusiva y accesible en materia de vivienda, sea cual sea la capacidad económica de las personas que deseen acceder a una vivienda\". CCOO también ha puesto el foco en la \"saturación\" de pisos turísticos existente en Sevilla, donde algunas zonas llegan a tener una ocupación del 43%, mientras que otras ciudades han intervenido este mercado cuando sus índices han superado el 8%. \"Una reciente sentencia da el visto bueno a la intervención por parte del gobierno local, al que le pedimos que actúe y que no siga escudándose en esperar una regulación autonómica\", ha apuntado el secretario de Política Institucional de CCOO de Sevilla.

    "text": "The world should not be surprised when Israel responds to “terrorism” from the north, President Isaac Herzog has said, suggesting that West Jerusalem is preparing to escalate the conflict with the Lebanon-based Hezbollah.\nHerzog brought up Lebanon at Wednesday’s ceremony in Jerusalem, which marked the 57th anniversary of Israel taking control of the entire city during the 1967 conflict with Egypt, Syria and Jordan.\n“I turn from here to the international community and its leaders and stress – one cannot remain indifferent to this terrorism, from Lebanon or anywhere,” Herzog said. “The world needs to wake up and realize that Israel has no choice but to protect its citizens and it should come as no surprise when it does so – strongly and ever more resolutely.”\nHerzog claimed that Israel has been attacked “by Iran’s proxies in Lebanon” on a daily basis and that now was not the time to stand by and allow things to escalate.\n“This terrorist aggression must be stopped,” he said.\nRead more Israel bombs ‘Hamas compound’ in Gaza school Earlier in the day, two drones launched by Hezbollah struck the town of Hurfeish, near the border with Lebanon, killing a reserve Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier and injuring ten more people. The group also claimed to have struck an Iron Dome missile defense site in Ramot Naftali, using a guided missile. The IDF said it could not confirm this.\nA total of 19 IDF soldiers have been killed in the north since October 7 last year, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government responded to the series of Hamas raids out of Gaza by launching an offensive against the Palestinian enclave.\nHezbollah has sought to support Hamas by occasionally firing rockets into northern Israel. Rocket exchanges have compelled the evacuation of more than 53,000 Israelis and 95,000 Lebanese from the vicinity of the border.\nIsrael has also blamed Hezbollah rocket strikes for starting a series of wildfires in the Golan Heights and northern Galilee over the past weekend, which burned down almost 2,500 acres of forest.\nNetanyahu echoed Herzog’s comments while visiting the northern city of Kiryat Shmona on Wednesday, saying the IDF was prepared for “very intense action” against Hezbollah.\n“Whoever thinks that they can hurt us and that we will sit idly by is making a big mistake,” he told reporters. “One way or another, we will restore security to the north.”\nHezbollah official Naim Qassem told Al Jazeera on Tuesday that the group doesn’t consider Israeli threats to be serious. “We have decided not to widen the battle and we do not want an all-out war. But if it is imposed on us, we are ready and we won’t retreat,” Qassem said.\n ",

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.

She admitted that ⁣she often finds‍ herself drawn to new relationships even when she knows⁤ they might not be the right fit. [[3]]\n​\nHaack’s openness about her dating habits comes after a whirlwind few years. She‌ was married ⁣to El ⁢moussa from 2009 to 2016,and then quickly moved on to a relationship with Ant ‌Anstead,which ended ‍in 2021.

[[1]]\nWhile Haack hasn’t publicly explained the reasons⁣ behind her pattern, she has expressed a desire for love and connection. Some speculate that her high-profile lifestyle and demanding career⁣ may contribute to⁣ her seeking out quick romances.⁤ [[2]]\nIrrespective of the reasons, Haack’s‌ willingness to be honest about her dating struggles is refreshing.

    "text": "These identical twins both grew up with autism, but took very different paths [The Science of Siblings](https://www.npr.org/series/1241438370/the-science-of-siblings) is a new series exploring the ways our siblings can influence us, from our money and our mental health all the way down to our very molecules. We'll be [sharing these stories](https://www.npr.org/series/1241438370/the-science-of-siblings) over the next several weeks. Sam and John Fetters, 19, are identical twins at opposite ends of the autism spectrum. Sam is a sophomore at Amherst College who plans to double major in history and political science. In his free time, he runs marathons. John attends a special school, struggles to form sentences, and likes to watch Teletubbies and Sesame Street. Two brothers. Same genes. Different flavors of autism. To scientists, twins like Sam and John pose an important question: How can a disorder that is known to be highly genetic look so different in siblings who share the same genome? \"That is one of the greatest mysteries right now in research on autism,\" says [Dr. Stephanie Morris](https://www.kennedykrieger.org/patient-care/faculty-staff/stephanie-m-morris-md), a pediatric neurologist at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore. Solving that mystery could help explain autism's odd mix of nature and nurture, Morris says. It also might help \"modify the trajectory\" of autistic children experiencing speech and language delays, or difficulty with social communication. Identical twins on separate paths Sam and John are spending the weekend with their mom, Kim Leaird, at the family's apartment in West Tisbury, a small town on Martha's Vineyard. The twins are crowded together on a couch. Even seated, they look tall. Standing, Sam is 6 feet, 5 inches, his brother just an inch shorter. John lets Sam do most of the talking. He frequently touches his brother, who sometimes takes his hand. John has \"a truly tremendous amount of empathy,\" Sam says. \"He's able to be very supportive.\" When Sam and his mother were at odds, John would comfort him. And when Sam ran track and cross country in high school meets, he'd see his brother at the finish line, \"jumping up and down because he was so happy.\" When John speaks, it's often about Sesame Street characters, including his favorite: Cookie Monster. Why that particular Muppet? \"He likes cookies!\" John says. Early in life, Sam and John were much more similar than they may seem today, Leaird says. \"They both did not wave, they didn't respond to their name, they both had a lot of repetitive movements,\" she says. At age 2, neither was speaking. So Leaird enrolled them in an early intervention preschool. It worked for Sam. \"He started talking and has never stopped,\" Leaird says. \"It was only then we were like, 'Well, what's going on with John?\" She moved John to a more intensive program. Even so, he didn't begin using words until he was 4. And over the next few years, Sam says, it became clear that he and John were on different paths. \"When we were kids, he was really passionate about Sesame Street; I was really passionate about Thomas the Tank Engine,\" Sam says. But later, \"I started moving to other passions and he just kept being passionate about Sesame Street,\" Sam says, \"which is totally valid.\" What twin studies reveal about autism When Sam and John were 5, Leaird enrolled them in a study of identical twins with autism. \"I just thought it might be good to see if we could find answers,\" Leaird says — especially \"to help John, if we could.\" The family was living in Maryland at the time. So Sam and John were evaluated at [Kennedy Krieger Institute](https://www.kennedykrieger.org/), which is known for treating children with developmental disabilities. Studies like the one involving Sam and John have played a critical role in understanding autism since the 1970s. \"The earliest twin studies really helped to debunk this theory that autism was caused by parenting,\" Morris says. Under this theory, moms took the brunt of the blame, supposedly for being \"cold and distant and detached from their child.\" Those studies showed that autism was largely a product of genetics, not parenting. In 2019, a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7355281/) of 366 pairs of identical twins changed the field again. The study confirmed earlier research showing that if one twin had autism, there was a 90% chance the other would too. \"However, the level, or the severity in which the twins were manifesting the diagnosis, was incredibly different,\" Morris says. The finding suggests that autism symptoms can be greatly influenced by events that happen after conception. We are identical twins in almost every other way — laugh in the same way, cry in the same way, see the day in the same way, love the same way. These events could include mutations in dividing fetal cells, or something that causes certain genes to be switched on or off. Another possibility, Morris says, is that the severity of symptoms is affected by different experiences during pregnancy and in the first few months of life. \"There's something in very very early development that might be unique to one of the twins and not the other,\" she says. \"That could be something as simple as an infection.\" A hole in the heart Both John and Sam were born with anatomical anomalies that required surgery. Sam had a hernia that needed repair, but it was surgery that could wait until he was 5. John had a hole in his heart that was affecting his growth and had to be fixed when he was still an infant. Sam's surgery went smoothly. But John developed an infection in the incision surgeons had made in his chest. The infection was from drug-resistant staph bacteria. So John went back to the hospital and spent a month on powerful antibiotics pumped directly into a vein near his heart. There's no way to know whether that experience changed the course of John's autism. \"It's really only later that I thought, well, maybe it was the staph infection and John's environment when he was so little,\" Leaird says. Regardless of what causes twins to end up at different places on the autism spectrum, these siblings seem to have a special relationship, Morris says. \"I think there's an understanding that 'My twin isn't quite as capable of communicating in the way that they need to, so I'll help them with that,'\" she says. That description fits Sam and John. When asked to name his favorite episode of Sesame Street, John blurts out a series of words: \"Abby makes the seasons change.\" Sam understands immediately and quickly steps in to explain. \"There's an episode with Abby Cadabby, Rosita and Zoe, where they dance around with the seasons changing,\" Sam says. \"I think that's the one he's referring to.\" His brother's keeper Sam has always looked out for his brother, Leaird says. When the boys spent a year in the same school, she says, Sam did fine, but John struggled and had some noisy meltdowns. \"Sam would hear him from his classroom, and he would just flee,\" Leaird says. \"He would get up and run to his brother to help him and to translate for him.\" Now that Sam is off at college, he worries about his brother, whose limited speech and flapping arms can make him the target of insults and ridicule. \"One of the ways you avoid that is trying to present [as] more neurotypical,\" Sam says. \"I can do that. My brother can't.\" Actually being neurotypical isn't something Sam wants for his brother or himself. \"I think I approach the world in interesting ways,\" Sam says, noting that autism has contributed to his passion for history and running. John's autism is part of the \"amazing and creative world in his head,\" Sam says, a world that includes Teletubbies and Muppets, as well as people and places. Even so, Sam wishes his brother could use words the way he does. \"We are identical twins in almost every other way — laugh in the same way, cry in the same way, see the day in the same way, love the same way,\" Sam says. \"He should absolutely have that ability to speak. He should have that. And him not having that is so unfair.\" So for now, Sam plans to keep using his own words to help say what his brother can't.
