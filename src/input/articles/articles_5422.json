People Editorial Guidelines Published on April 23, 2025 05:51PM EDT Comments Jay and Mavis Leno. Photo: Michael Tullberg/Getty\nJay Leno was granted conservatorship of his wife, Mavis Leno, in April 2024 following her dementia diagnosis. In a new interview, Jay opened up about caring for his wife and why he is embracing his new responsibilities, despite the challenges that her dementia has presented. The comedian, who faced his own health challenges in the last three years, said the way he's stepped up for Mavis in her time of need is \"what love is\" as he sweetly added: \"I would rather be with her than doing something else.\" Jay Leno is staying true to his vows.\nThe comedian and former late night host opened up about how his life has changed one year after he was granted conservatorship of his wife of more than four decades, Mavis Leno , following her dementia diagnosis.\nDuring an appearance on In Depth with Graham Bensinger , which premiered on April 23, Jay, who is just days away from his 75th birthday, explained that this is the first real challenge he has faced in his life.\n\"When you get married, you sort of take a vow: ‘Will I live up to this? Or will I be like a sleazy guy if something happens to my wife, I'm out banging the cashier at the mini mart?'\" he said. \"No, I didn't. I enjoy the time with my wife. I go home, I cook dinner for her, watch TV and it's okay.\"\n\"It's basically what we did before, except now I have to feed her and do all those things,\" he continued. \"But, I like it. I like taking care of her. She's a very independent woman, so I like that I'm needed.\"\nJay added that \"you have to find the humor\" in the situation to get through hard things, recalling a time when he took Mavis, now 78, shopping at Nordstrom, and she insisted on buying a pair of designer shoes.\nMavis and Jay Leno. Kristian Dowling/WireImage\nSomething else he and Mavis have been doing together since her diagnosis is going through memories on flashcards, which has brought some laughs among them as well.\n\"It's kind of fun,\" Jay admitted. \"I go, ‘Honey, that's President Obama. Remember we had dinner?’ [She'll say], 'Oh, not me.’ [And I'll say], 'Yeah, honey, that was you!'\"\nStill, that doesn't take away from the difficulty of the new dynamic he has with his wife of 45 years.\n\"Well, that's the challenge, isn't it? When you have to feed someone and change them and carry them to the bathroom and do all that kind of stuff every day,\" he said. \"It's a challenge. And it's not that I enjoy doing it, but I guess I enjoy doing it.\"\n\"I'm not just, ‘This person is attractive and sexy,' and having sex with them and everything,\" he noted of having a partner. \"At some point in my life, I'm gonna be called upon to defend myself. I think that's really what defines a marriage. I mean, that's really what love is. That's what you do. I mean, I'm glad I didn't cut and run. I'm glad I didn't run off with some woman half my age or any of that silly nonsense. I would rather be with her than doing something else.\"\nJay Leno and Wife Mavis Enjoy Night Out at Comedy Show amid Her Dementia Struggles Mavis and Jay Leno. George Pimentel/WireImage\nJay first filed for conservatorship for Mavis in January 2024 as he revealed that she had been diagnosed with “advanced dementia,” according to documents obtained by PEOPLE at the time. He was seeking the petition to set up a living trust for Mavis to ensure that she has \"managed assets\" to provide her with future care if he died.\nIn early April 2024, Mavis’ court-appointed counsel, Ronald Ostrin, filed a report regarding Jay's conservatorship petition, noting that Mavis “consents” to the idea, and thus Ostrin formally recommended the approval of Jay’s petition as conservator of his wife’s estate.\nIn the filing which was obtained by PEOPLE at the time, Mavis’ neurologist, Dr. Hart Cohen, said Jay is “such a nice man and treats [Mavis] like gold.” Ostrin described the former Tonight Show host as “a standup guy” whose “private persona matches the public persona he projects.”\nOstrin also provided an update on Mavis’ health, revealing that she “sometimes does not know her husband, Jay, nor her date of birth. The neurologist said Mavis also “has a lot of disorientation, will ruminate about her parents who have both passed and her mother who died about 20 years ago.\"\nWho Is Jay Leno's Wife? All About Mavis Leno The report also spoke to the relationship between of the couple, who have been married since 1980, with Ostrin describing them as “long-term, loving and supportive,” and Mavis viewing Jay as “her protector and she trusts him.”\nJay and Mavis Leno. David Livingston/Getty Days after the filing, Jay and Mavis' lawyer attended a hearing at Los Angeles County Superior Court, where her attorney said she was \"in agreement\" with the conservatorship and \"receiving excellent care with her husband, Mr. Leno.” Jay was later deemed \"fit\" to serve as conservator .\nJay Leno Shares the Shocking Details of His Burn Accident: 'My Face Was on Fire' It's been a difficult few years for Jay. Besides his wife's health struggles, he also sustained second and third degree burns after a gasoline fire in 2022. He had been working on a steam engine underneath a car in his garage when the fire started. Mavis was by his side as he recovered from the severe burns.\nThen, in November 2024, Jay sustained injuries after falling down a steep hill . He told Inside Edition that he broke his wrist, lost the nail on one of his fingers and bruised the entire left side of his body during the tumble. He had to wear an eye patch during his recovery.\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nThe comedian initially met his wife after he performed at the iconic Comedy Store in the '70s, and they tied the knot in 1980.\nJay previously joked to PEOPLE about the secret to their long-lasting marriage, saying, \"Not screwing around is a huge key. You can do a lot. You can leave your underwear on the doorknob for the rest of your life if you don't screw around.\"\nAll jokes aside, Jay shared, \"I always tell guys when they meet a woman, 'Marry your conscience. Marry someone who's the person you wish you could be and it works out okay.'\"\nClose Leave a Comment",

    "text": "Israeli tanks, missiles strike Gaza in new offensive [ World ](https://indaily.com.au/news/world/) In one of Israel’s latest airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt. Israeli forces have attacked areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip where residents have been expecting a renewed ground offensive in areas crammed with tens of thousands of Palestinians already displaced by the Israeli-Hamas war. At nightfall on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the southern city of Khan Younis killed eight Palestinians, health officials said. Three Palestinians were killed and six injured in an Israeli missile strike on a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent said. The Islamist group Hamas released video it said showed its fighters targeting Israeli tanks and soldiers east of Bureij. Reuters was not able to verify the location or the date the video was filmed. Yamen Hamad has been living in a school in Deir al-Balah, also in central Gaza, since fleeing from the north. He said people newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground. In one of Israel’s latest airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. Their bombed building was housing displaced civilians, according to local medics and residents. Reuters video showed rescuers scrabbling through rubble to uncover and pull out victims including a baby and several children and rushing them through milling crowds of dazed and weeping people to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital. Palestinian health authorities said earlier that 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 – nearly one per cent of Gaza’s population. Thousands more dead were feared to be buried or lost in the ruins. Throughout the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies. Hamas and its fighters are dug deep into the Gaza Strip’s dense cities and towns and their leaders are still at large. Israel has reported 169 of its soldiers killed in its Gaza campaign after Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on October 7, killing 1200 people and taking about 240 hostages. Some 110 hostages were freed during a November 24-December 1 humanitarian pause and more than 20 others have been declared dead. US President Joe Biden on Thursday said Hamas killed an American hostage, Judith Weinstein, 70, on October 7. Last week he said her husband Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on the same day. The Israeli military released findings of an investigation into the killings in error by its troops of three Israeli hostages in Gaza on December 15. Soldiers mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding.

Egypt on Thursday confirmed it had put forward a framework proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip that includes three stages ending with a ceasefire and said it was awaiting responses on the plan. The proposal is an attempt “to bring viewpoints between all concerned parties closer, in an effort to stop Palestinian bloodshed and the aggression against the Gaza Strip and restore peace and stability to the region,” Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt’s State Information Service, said in a statement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will keep some form of security control over all of Gaza indefinitely, though he insists that this would not amount to reoccupying the enclave. – AAP with DPA Local News Matters Media diversity is under threat in Australia – nowhere more so than in South Australia.

    "text": "Our nation just celebrated Memorial Day. It is a day set apart for us to remember all those who made the ultimate sacrifice. They gave their lives to defend the country they loved– a country that promoted freedom and the principles so beautifully laid out in our Declaration of Independence and the Constitution’s Bill of Rights. It is up to us, the living, to make sure their sacrifice was not in vain.\nI often refer to the United States as a shining city on a hill. From America’s founding, the country has provided hope to the world. Quoting from ushistory.org , “The passengers of the Arbella who left England in 1630 with their new charter had a great vision. They were to be an example for the rest of the world in rightful living. Future governor John Winthrop stated their purpose quite clearly: ‘We shall be as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon us.’”\nPresident Ronald Reagan frequently referred to America as a shining city on a hill. I’ve kept that image tucked away in my heart for many years. Can America be, or remain, a shining city on a hill with the eyes of all people upon us? Are we an example of what is good and right about how people should live and how leaders should govern?\nFor those working to protect innocent human life, we know that each and every human life has value. Every individual is deserving of dignity and respect, simply because they are a member of the human family. They are our brothers and sisters.\nFollow LifeNews on the MeWe social media network for the latest pro-life news free from Facebook’s censorship!\nOn a popular evening news/commentary show, a segment was given to a reporter interviewing people on the street. One young woman was asked, “Do you believe in God?” She answered, “No.” The follow-up question was, “What happens to you when you die?” Her answer, “Nothing.”\nMany people live, day to day, believing that what they see is all there is. The 70, 80, or 90 years on earth is all they have and then they’re done. If life is difficult or lonely, it would be natural to wonder why it is wrong to end that life through suicide or assisted suicide.\nIf, after all, this life is all there is, what difference does it make if we bring another life into the world when that newborn life will require time and money? What if we fear that the new addition may bring more heartache than joy?\nThose with a Christian or other-religion perspective see life as a gift of God—a blessing that should be protected, nourished, and loved. For many without that perspective, their attitude is more of “eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.”\nThat’s why I love the active involvement in the movement of those who are secular or atheist. They provide an important voice, that life is precious no matter what else you believe—or don’t believe.\nHow do we reach those who see life as short-term and finite? A quote attributed to President Theodore Roosevelt gives us some direction: “Nobody cares about how much you know until they know how much you care.”\nWe can, and must, elect pro-life candidates and enact pro-life legislation because the law is an effective tool. But our educational outreach is a critical component of what pro-lifers do and has been from the very beginning.\nWhen we say that it is wrong to kill unborn babies, we need to make sure abortion-minded women know that we care about them as well. Do they understand that we don’t want them to undergo the physical pain of a chemical abortion or the mental anguish of living with the memory of the death of their child?\nOur words and actions must show love for those who have been through an abortion and concern for those considering this horrific “choice.”\nPregnancy centers and other organizations help women with after-abortion counseling. A great website, https://hurtbyabortion.org , gives women the opportunity to share their stories for others to read. They will hopefully find comfort, knowing they are helping others through the same trauma.\nThe covid pandemic changed a lot of our nation’s lifestyle. People became isolated and lonely; they spent more time on phones and Zoom calls. Young people see and compare themselves to others on social media, probably wondering why they aren’t an “influencer” or wondering how to become one. They want people in the world to notice them, to care about them, to know they exist.\nMore than ever, the pro-life movement is needed in so many ways. We continue our efforts to protect our most vulnerable brothers and sisters from abortion and euthanasia and assisted suicide. As individuals, our love for life can also be infectious.\nIn 1989, in his farewell address, President Reagan said of his beloved country, “After 200 years, two centuries, she still stands strong and true on the granite ridge, and her glow has held steady no matter what storm. And she’s still a beacon, still a magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness, toward home.”\nWe can be individual lights, shining in our homes and communities, letting our love for fellow human beings shine through. And together, we will be that shining city on a hill, spreading the warmth so many of our brothers and sisters are looking for.\nLifeNews Note: Carol Tobias is the president of the National Right to Life Committee .",

Credit: Thomas Wielecki\nThe year 11 and 12 senior campus, where some 45 per cent of enrolments are drawn from nearby private schools, ranks among the highest-performing comprehensive schools in the HSC.\nThe move to shut down the senior campus model was made as part of the Labor government’s election promise guaranteeing access to co-ed high schools across Sydney .\nTuesday’s state budget contained $15 million in the coming year to upgrade Freshwater ahead of it becoming a year 7 to 12 school. Another $10 million was allocated to dismantling Asquith Girls and Boys in the upper north shore and turning them into two separate co-ed campuses, set to be named Asquith High and Hornsby High.\nAbout $40 million was allocated to the new Liverpool High, a co-ed school that will merge Liverpool Boys and Liverpool Girls into a six-storey campus with a new gym and sports courts.\nThe Freshwater Senior Campus P&C is pursuing legal action against the department, including seeking a judicial review of the decision to expand the school. Credit: Thomas Wielecki\nAnother $5 million in this year’s budget will go to Bayside High – which will merge James Cook Boys Technology High and Moorefield Girls – while $7 million was allocated for upgrades to the new co-ed Randwick High.\nWhile many parents have welcomed expanded access to co-ed public high schools after years of lobbying for more options, others have fiercely opposed shutting or merging campuses.\nAdvertisement In February, Freshwater parents launched a campaign to fund a legal case to block the government from dismantling the senior campus model.\n“Despite Freshwater’s overwhelming success as a senior school, taxpayer money is being wasted on a plan to dismantle something that isn’t broken,” the fundraising page says . Parents argue the senior model works, outperforms some high-fee private schools, and has helped combat the exodus of students from the public system.\nA consultation report revealed most parents, teachers and students at the senior school did not support the move, but parents at local primary schools preferred it to become a year 7 to 12 school.\nHead of the Freshwater P&C Sam Williams said parents at the school “are fiercely committed to protecting the school for future generations of students. Once it’s gone you can’t get it back.”\nLoading Williams said the P&C is pursuing legal action against the department, including seeking a judicial review of the decision to expand the school.\nHe said it was illogical to dismantle the senior model given the proximity of the co-ed Forest High and Cromer High, and nearby private school St Luke’s Grammar building a $20 million dedicated senior school at Pittwater Road.\nA year ago, education bureaucrats praised Freshwater for its popularity, fostering a strong sense of belonging in students and being among the best-attended schools in the state.\nBut the president of the P&C at nearby primary school Harbord Public, Martijn Timmer, said he was pleased with the move to expand the school. “Previously we only had Balgowlah Boys and Mackellar Girls, now this gives us more co-ed options in walking distance.”\nLoading Williams said there are concerns among parents about falling enrolments in nearby primary schools including Curl Curl North and Manly West, and if the population projections will support expanding the school.\nThe NSW Education Department has pushed back plans to open the school to years 7 to 12 until 2028.\nA department spokesperson said funding will upgrade the school to support additional enrolments, with construction expected to start early next year.\n“The timeline to expand Freshwater Senior Campus to include years 7 to 10 has been extended to allow more time for transition planning and to enable currently enrolled students to complete their senior schooling,” the spokesperson said.\nManly MP James Griffin said the $15 million would be better allocated at other northern beaches schools, including Balgowlah Boys, where he said, “teaching blocks and various classrooms are in states of disrepair”.\nThis week’s budget included an overall $2.6 billion for new schools and upgraded classrooms across NSW, including new schools in Sydney’s south and north-west growth corridors.\nFreshwater Senior Campus school captains Sophie Rawstorne and Sebastian Rayel say the current model works. Credit: Edwina Pickles\nA new public primary school is slated for Emerald Hills, near Leppington, where school-aged population growth has far eclipsed projections. Another new primary school is earmarked for Grantham Farm in the north-west, however, families will need to wait until 2028 for both schools to open their doors.\nStart the day with a summary of the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.
