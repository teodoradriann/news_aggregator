    "text": "There was panic in Odigbo local government area of Ondo state following the shocking discovery of three headless bodies floating in a river along the Odigbo-Ore old Road.\nThe discovery was made Sunday when locals stumbled upon the decomposing bodies floating in the river, with some bodies logged at the riverbanks.\nEyewitness accounts stated that the victims were brutally murdered and dumped in the river by suspected kidnappers.\nOne man identified simply as Shileola, an immediate past youth leader of the community, expressed shock over the incident.\nHe said: “I was shocked when I first heard about it over the phone. I rushed to the scene, hoping to identify the victims through their clothing or any other means, but all efforts proved abortive.”\nHe speculated that the victims might have been killed elsewhere and their bodies dumped in the river, as no reports of missing persons have been recorded in the area so far.\nThe youth leader however, urged residents to remain vigilant and security-conscious in the wake of the incident.\nWhile as of the time of filing this report, the exact cause and those behind the gruesome death remains unknown in the community.\nIn his reaction, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Ayanlade Olayinka, confirmed that some three bodies were recovered at a river in Odigbo.\nHe said immediately it was reported at the Ore Division, the DPO of that division moved a detective to the scene where the three bodies were recovered.",

    "title": "the PS5 is getting ripped apart on Amazon, including the Fortnite version ????\\ufe0f",
    "text": "With the deal put forward by Amazon on Black Friday, the PS5 Digital with a DualSense controller drops to 374 euros instead of 449 euros. If the console has already been the subject of some discounts in the past, this price drop remains exceptional. At the same time, you can also take advantage of the PS5 Standard with a DualSens controller and Fortnite Cobalt Star benefits at the price of 474 euros instead of 549 euros.\nWhether you pick up either of these PS5s, we recommend you don't wait. The console attracts people in all its versions and the slightest discount has been expected by players since the start of Black Friday. For its part, Amazon has very limited stock: first come, first served, and it is certain that there will not be enough for everyone.\nTo find all the current offers on Amazon, click here:\nGet the PS5 Digital on promo\nBuy the pack with PS5 and controller on sale\nAmazon accompanies the PS5 with several far from negligible services. On the one hand, the video game console is delivered free and quickly, it only takes a few days for the order to reach your home. Of course, you are entitled to the manufacturer's warranty as if you had ordered from the official brand. Finally, please note that you can change your mind until January 31, 2025, in which case the return is free and then the refund is full.\nBy shifting its return deadline in this way, Amazon allows the public to order their Christmas gifts right away, whether it is the famous PS5 or the rest of its catalog. In fact, you benefit from the console at the best price, you offer it at the end of year holidays and you return it quietly in January if it does not suit its recipient, which we highly doubt.\nThe PS5, reference console\nWe no longer present the PS5 as the video game console has been famous since its release, it has established itself as the reference model among gamers. With the current offers on Amazon, two options are available to you, because you can favor the Digital version on the one hand: this one does not include the disc player. If you take this version, you buy the games online electronically. Otherwise, the gaming experience remains exactly the same.\nOtherwise, you can choose the PS5 Slim included in the pack at Amazon. As its name suggests, it is positioned as a slightly thinner model than the basic version, but it is just as competent. This is equipped with aBlu-ray player so you can enjoy your games physically (PS5 or PS4). The model is based on an ultra-high speed SSD drive so that loading times are almost instantaneous for games.\nThe PS5 Slim can boast of offering a high level of realism thanks to the Ray Tracing light rendering technology and compatibility with HDR technology for vivid and dynamic colors. With the video game console, you can even play in 4K with compatible games and displays.\nIn detail, the pack discounted on Amazon includes the PS5 Slim console with a controller, but also 8 in-game cosmetic items (worth around 5,000 V-Bucks) and 1,000 V-Bucks to use in Fortnite. Remember that stocks are ultra limited by Amazon, don't wait to secure the deal of your choice, because this opportunity will not happen again soon.\nTo access discounts on Amazon, click here:\nBuy the PS5 on sale\nBuy the pack with PS5 on sale\n????

    "text": "Street ministry is one of my favorite things to do. There is something refreshing about meeting people from all walks of life in an outdoor setting and telling them about Jesus’ love for them.\nOne beautiful summer day, I met a young mother who was walking to a store with her small children. Her face showed signs of stress, yet her children seemed joyful as they ran and skipped in the gorgeous weather. As she neared the store, I stopped her and asked if I could pray for her. With great relief, she said with a sigh, “How did you know I needed prayer and someone to talk to today?” In response, I said, “God knew that you needed the prayer, and I am happy to be the one to pray for you.”\nAs the birds chirped and soared through the breezy air, she began to share her hardships with me as her children hugged my legs and giggled. With a smile, I shared with her the difficulties I faced in life and how God saved me before helping me to overcome those challenges. As I asked her to join me in taking a seat on the nearby chairs, I held her hand and hugged her children in my other arm. I began praying for her and tears fell from her eyes. I then asked her to repeat the words of a prayer for salvation. To my great delight, her small children also repeated the prayer with pure and innocent voices.\nLuke 15:7 (CSB) says, “I tell you, in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than ninety-nine righteous people who don't need repentance.”\nThere is rejoicing in heaven when the people we share Christ with receive Him as their Lord and Savior. I imagine one of the most exciting celebrations happening at that moment! What a pleasure to participate in setting up heaven for a joyful celebration.\nJust as we rejoice when we find something valuable that we have lost, God the Father rejoices as well. The Bible shares a parable about a lost son coming home and the father celebrated by throwing a party. The father said, “But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.” (Luke 15:32)\nMaybe street ministry is not a desire for you. That is completely understandable. Might there be people you encounter in your daily life that you can share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with? A neighbor, a friend, or a fellow grocery store shopper may come to your mind. There may be someone that you encounter who will not attend a church service or watch a Christian program. You may be the person they need to hear from to receive God’s gift of salvation. As Matthew 5:14 shares, “You are the light of the world. A city situated on a hill cannot be hidden.”\nPray for the courage to begin sharing the love of God with those in your daily life. You were created to be the light of the world.\nLet us pray: Dear Lord, I want to share Your love with others. Please give me the boldness to reach out to the lost people in my life so they receive the gift of Jesus Christ. I want them to experience Your love through me. In Jesus’ name, amen.\n~\nScripture is quoted from the Christian Standard Bible. Copyright © 2017 by Holman Bible Publishers. Used by permission.

    "text": "France, Germany, Britain, and the United States jointly condemned Iran’s recent increase in highly enriched uranium production, reaching up to 60% purity—a level close to that used for nuclear weapons. In their statement, the allies expressed concern about Iran’s actions, deeming them reckless in the current tense regional context, [Reuters reported.](https://www.reuters.com/world/france-germany-uk-us-condemn-irans-increase-uranium-enrichment-2023-12-28/) The rise in uranium enrichment coincides with heightened hostilities in the region, notably Israel’s offensive against Hamas in Gaza. Iran-backed proxies have escalated attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and targeted U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria, further intensifying tensions. Despite the condemnation, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on Tuesday that Iran had reversed its months-long slowdown in highly enriched uranium production. The joint statement denounced this escalation, characterizing it as a worrisome development in Iran’s nuclear program. Iran, responding on Wednesday, dismissed the IAEA report as “nothing new” and asserted compliance with program rules. The country already possesses enough uranium of 60% purity, sufficient to make three nuclear bombs if enriched to 90%, according to the IAEA’s theoretical definition. Despite these concerns, Iran denies any intention to develop nuclear weapons. The 2015 nuclear deal involving Britain, France, and Germany aimed at preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is now at risk. Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the accord in 2018 prompted Iran to gradually violate its provisions, adding complexity to the current diplomatic challenges.",

    "title": "Freezing rain, snow to lead to hazardous conditions Saturday",
    "text": "Freezing rain, snow to lead to hazardous conditions Saturday\nFreezing rain mixed with snow tonight, Saturday morning will lead to hazardous driving conditions.\nA low pressure system moving through the Midwest will bring freezing rain mixed with snow tonight and Saturday as temperatures gradually warm up.\nSkies will become mostly cloudy through this morning as temperatures slowly reach a high in the mid to upper-teens across the area. As the system approaches to the south of us, temperatures are expected to rise. This means we will reach our low in the low to mid-teens through the early evening hours. Once we reach our low, temperatures are actually going to slowly rise back into the upper-teens and low-20s by the late night and overnight hours. With this rise in temperatures on the way, the upper atmosphere will also warm up. The warming temperatures at the surface and upper atmosphere will lead to some messy precipitation chances for the area starting late tonight and continuing into Saturday.\nBy late tonight, between 10 pm and midnight (12 am), a wintery mix of freezing rain and snow is projected to move into the area from the southwest. This mix of freezing rain and snow is projected to continue through Saturday morning and into the mid-afternoon hours for portions of the area (areas east of Mankato).\nFreezing rain brings concerns as it leads to very icy and slick conditions on surfaces. Freezing rain is more like a glazing of ice, meaning, there really is no traction when freezing rain occurs in an area. Because of this, it is important to understand that freezing rain is one of the more dangerous types of precipitation and/or hazardous weather conditions to be out and about in as there are usually many spin outs, crashes/accidents, and cars sliding off the road into ditches.\nIt is advised to not go out and about late tonight or Saturday morning as roads are expected to be very slick and dangerous for everyone, including emergency officials/authorities. If you have to go out and about early Saturday morning, it is advised to make sure you have a safety kit in your vehicle just in case. The safety kit should include items such as extra clothes for everyone in the vehicle, blankets, nonperishable foods/snacks, water for everyone, chargers for smart devices, a flashlight or two, extra batteries for the flashlights, some candles (or crayons as those burn slowly and warm), and a lighter or some matches. Of course, other items you or the others in your car may need (like medications for example) should also be included in the safety kit, along with items for your vehicle like jumper cables.\nThe freezing rain-snow mix may continue through the mid-afternoon hours in southern Minnesota and northern Iowa before wrapping up Saturday afternoon/evening. Temperatures are projected to hover in the low-30s through the afternoon hours with winds up to 15 mph mixed in. Saturday night will remain cloudy as temperatures dip into the upper-20s by Sunday morning.\nOnce the freezing rain and snow clear out of the area, we could have up to a tenth of an inch (0.10″) of ice built up on surfaces and a possible dusting of snow in portions of the area.\nSunday will be quieter but cloudy. We are looking at highs in the mid-30s with winds reaching up to 15 mph. Sunday night will remain cloudy with temperatures dipping into the low-30s by Monday morning.\nThe next chance of precipitation will move in throughout Monday as a cold front moves through the area. Temperatures are projected to hover in the mid-30s through the early to mid-afternoon hours. As the next round of precipitation develops in the area, we will likely see a mix of rain and snow with temperatures in the mid-30s; however, as temperatures start to drop through the mid to late afternoon hours, the rain/snow mix will start to transition to just snow for the evening before wrapping up, leaving behind mostly cloudy skies. Temperatures are projected to drop into the low-20s by Tuesday morning.\nTuesday will continue to be mostly cloudy with a chance of some light snow around the area. Temperatures are anticipated to hover in the mid-20s with winds reaching up to 10 mph throughout the day. Tuesday night will continue with mostly cloudy skies as temperatures dip into the low-teens by Wednesday morning.\nWednesday through Friday of next week will then be nice and quiet with a mix of mostly cloudy skies to partly cloudy skies. As of right now, we aren’t looking at any big precipitation chances next week. Instead, we may just see some flurries on Thursday. Temperatures will hover in the low to mid-20s with winds ranging between 5 and 15 mph with occasional gusts up to 20 mph at times. Overnight temperatures will be on the colder side, dipping into the single digits and teens by the following mornings.\nSaturday and Sunday of next weekend will remain rather quiet but with more sunshine mixed in as we are looking at mostly sunny skies for both days. Temperatures through next weekend are projected to hover in the low to mid-20s with winds reaching up to 15 mph. Overnight temperatures will continue to be on the colder side as the are anticipated to drop to around 11 degrees by Sunday morning and the low-20s by Monday morning.\n[Click here to download the KEYC News Now app or our KEYC First Alert weather app.](https://www.keyc.com/page/keyc-apps-for-ios-and-android-devices/)\nCopyright 2024 KEYC.
