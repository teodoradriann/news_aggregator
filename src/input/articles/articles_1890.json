David returned to the Metro Manila District Jail in Taguig City, his first visit as cardinal, to continue his tradition of celebrating Mass for its inmates. —Contributed photo\nMANILA, Philippines — Kalookan Bishop Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David on Thursday called for a law providing compensation equivalent to the minimum wage for persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) who are eventually acquitted.\nThe cardinal made the call after celebrating Mass for PDLs at the Metro Manila District Jail in Taguig City. The Mass coincided with Pope Francis’ scheduled visit to Rebibbia Prison in Rome to mark one of the Catholic Church’s major events at the beginning of the Jubilee Year 2025, a special year of forgiveness and pardon.\nArticle continues after this advertisement READ: Newest PH cardinal assails Israel over Gaza attacks\nFEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO COA: BSP spent P5.95B for new peso banknotes NEWSINFO Rody asks Davao folk: ‘Don’t abandon Dutertes’ NEWSINFO SWS: Erwin Tulfo, Revilla, Go, Cayetano lead senatorial preference poll “I hope a law can be enacted where all PDLs who are not yet convicted and are eventually acquitted will be compensated by the government, even at minimum wage (around P20,000 per month they were imprisoned), so that when they start their life over, they will have capital,” David said, as relayed by the human rights group Kapatid, which initiated the visit.\nUnder Republic Act No. 7309, victims of unjust imprisonment or detention may be compensated based on the number of months of imprisonment or detention. Provided, however, that in no case shall such compensation exceed P1,000 per month.\nArticle continues after this advertisement In all other cases, the Board of Claims can approve a claim of up to P10,000 or the amount needed to cover expenses like hospitalization, medical treatment, lost wages, or other injury-related costs, whichever is less.\nArticle continues after this advertisement The cardinal started his homily by discussing the cultural nuances in Philippine languages, citing as an example the phrase “tao po,” which Filipinos often use when knocking on the door to check if someone is inside the house.\nArticle continues after this advertisement David, a Kapampangan, said that in their province, instead of “tao po,” the usual phrase is “Diyos po”—as if to say that they are “arriving in the name of Jesus.”\nA world with no PDLs The priest recalled that when he was a child, he asked who was knocking on the door when the person said “Diyos po” to which his grandfather told him: “Let them in first before asking who they are. There’s no God who intends harm.”\nArticle continues after this advertisement David intertwined these reflections with other stories of hospitality and hope, which is the theme of Christmas, including a retelling of Victor Hugo’s “Les Misérables,” focusing on the journey of Jean Valjean, a thief who stole bread and was imprisoned and found redemption through the Church’s kindness.\nThe cardinal also recounted an anecdote from his seminary days during the traditional Christmas play “Panunuluyan,” where a student playing an innkeeper deviated from the script by allowing Mary and Joseph to enter, saying after the show, “Ayoko, ang sungit ng character ko. Bakit ko itataboy si Jesus?”\nDavid ended the Mass with a prayer: that the Lord’s dream be realized—a world where there is no need for PDLs and where freedom shines brightly.\nSystemic challenges On Jan. 16, David, then a bishop, had already visited and celebrated Mass for PDLs, marking the first time a Metro Manila bishop held such an activity for them in the Taguig compound.\n“You are very fortunate because then Bishop Ambo opened the year with a Mass in this jail. He was still wearing a purple skullcap, and he returns today to close the year with another Mass, now wearing a red skullcap because he is a Cardinal,” said Gerry Bernabe, national coordinator of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines’ Episcopal Commission on Prison Pastoral Care, during the gathering.\nAfter the Mass, held on the fifth floor of a building housing some of the prominent political prisoners in the country, David engaged with PDLs as they detailed the systemic challenges they faced, such as overcrowding, inadequate food and medical services, and the slow pace of justice.\nPolitical prisoner and National Democratic Front of the Philippines peace consultant Adelberto Silva highlighted the inhumane conditions in Philippine prisons, which rank among the most overcrowded globally.\n“We hope, Cardinal David, that with your help, awareness can be raised about the grave issues Filipino prisoners face, so we may push for reforms in the prison and justice systems, as well as pursue just peace in our country,” Silva said.\nDavid called for the release of political prisoners as a meaningful first step toward the Jubilee Year’s Pilgrimage of Hope and reiterated his wish for a peaceful resolution to the world’s longest-running insurgency through resumed peace talks.\n757 political prisoners Peasant rights group Tanggol Magsasaka, meanwhile, called for the immediate release of the 757 political prisoners “unjustly detained” in detention facilities around the country.\n“These individuals—farmers, labor organizers, urban poor advocates, media practitioners, educators, environmental defenders, human rights advocates, and peace workers—are incarcerated on fabricated charges designed to stifle dissent and intimidate activists and government critics,” the group said in a statement.\nAmong them are activist Amanda Echanis and journalist Frenchie Mae Cumpio, both of whom were arrested in 2020 for illegal possession of firearms and explosives.\nThe group also called for the release of elderly prisoners, such as alleged New People’s Army members Rosita Taboy and Evangeline Rapanut, as well as peace consultant Frank Fernandez and his wife Cleofe Lagtapon.\nTanggol Magsasaka noted that out of the 757 political prisoners in the country, 156 were women, while 103 were part of the elderly. Their continued detention, particularly as they endure worsening conditions behind bars, “is a violation of their human rights and a blight on our nation’s democracy.”\nCiting reports from human rights groups Samahan ng Ex-Detainees Laban sa Detensyon at Aresto (Selda) and Karapatan, Tanggol Magsasaka criticized the “deplorable conditions” within the country’s detention facilities.\nPolitical detainees, the group said, have to endure “overcrowding, inadequate medical care, and the psychological toll of prolonged, unjust imprisonment.”\nTanggol Magsasaka pointed out that the country remains a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which “explicitly guarantees the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, peaceful assembly, and protection against arbitrary detention.”\nYour subscription could not be saved.

    "title": "#3 Jornadas de 17 horas y hacinamiento: las condiciones de los temporeros en la empresa de un líder de Vox en Balears",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n“Sé que me puede perjudicar porque igual no dan una buena referencia de mí y el año que viene… Pero quiero que se dé a conocer la realidad, que las nuevas personas que vengan no tengan que estrellarse contra el muro con el que nos damos nosotros ”, asume Fernando. Su nombre es falso porque, de otra forma, su historia no podría contarse. La historia de las condiciones en las que viven y trabajan los temporeros de Terracor que han contado su vivencia a elDiario.es. Este conglomerado mallorquín está formado por seis empresas dedicadas al cultivo y venta de frutas y verduras. En su organigrama figuran cinco socios. Uno de ellos, el secretario general de Vox en Balears y el conseller del Consell de Mallorca, Toni Gili.\nA 8.000 kilómetros de su país y sin más contactos que sus propios compañeros, la mayoría se sienten atrapados en un panorama que no saben muy bien cómo resolver. “Algunos hemos pedido un aumento de sueldo que se nos ha denegado, y también hemos hablado con asociaciones de colombianos aquí para que nos puedan echar una mano, pero por el momento no ha habido ninguna mejora”, afirma otro de los afectados.\nLa realidad que explican los temporeros de Terracor es que las condiciones no son halagüeñas: según su versión, su salario ronda los 6 euros la hora y en sus jornadas lo “normal” es que trabajan doce horas. En el cuadrante del mes de mayo que uno de los empleados muestra a elDiario.es figuran también jornadas de 13, 14 e incluso 17 horas. En las nóminas consultadas no aparecen horas extra remuneradas.\nEl Ministerio de Inclusión, Seguridad Social y Migraciones, en cuanto ha tenido conocimiento de los hechos, a través de su Secretaría de Estado de Migraciones, ha accionado. En coordinación con la Delegación del Gobierno en Balears, ha localizado a la empresa y, una vez realizado este trámite, ha notificado la denuncia a Inspección de Trabajo para que acuda y realice la visita pertinente de cara a, en su caso, depurar responsabilidades.\nelDiario.es ha intentado ponerse en contacto con Toni Gili antes de la publicación de este reportaje, pero el político ha derivado la consulta a la responsable de comunicación del grupo, quien ha especificado que el año pasado la empresa superó una inspección en los alojamientos de los temporeros, pero no ha sabido concretar qué organismo se encargó de dicha inspección ni cuáles fueron las instalaciones revisadas. “Los trabajadores no tienen ningún lujo, es cierto, pero cumplimos la normativa”, añade esta persona. Tampoco ha podido proporcionar información sobre las condiciones laborales ni las jornadas de trabajo actuales de los empleados. “El problema en Balears es que coincide la temporada alta turística con la agrícola y eso hace que la competencia por los trabajadores sea muy fuerte”, explicaba en un reportaje anterior Gili , ingeniero técnico agrícola y responsable de Innovación y Producción de la compañía.\nAlojamiento precario y sin higiene.\nA mediodía, el sol de agosto cae a plomo sobre la carretera de Manacor. Una recta casi infinita de asfalto flanqueada por campos en los que destaca un invernadero blanco con el logo de Terracor. Debajo, una frase: “Agricultura de aquí, del día”. Lo que se levanta detrás -uno diría que estratégicamente escondida- es precisamente una de las dos instalaciones en las que la empresa aloja a sus temporeros. “La primera vez que vine, hace ya casi veinte años, sí me sorprendí. Ahora ya…”, reconoce uno de los trabajadores antes de encogerse de hombros.\nEntre invernaderos de hortalizas y plantas aromáticas se levanta una gran nave de piedra. En el lateral el hueco del antiguo portón da paso a una suerte de salón tan precario como los suelos y paredes sin acabar. Más al fondo, sobre un suelo ya embaldosado, se llega a la cocina ya la sucesión de fogones y estantes que guardan la comida y enseres de las 28 personas que viven aquí. Algunas, trabajadoras permanentes de la empresa.\nLas habitaciones están del otro lado, donde la nave adquiere más el aspecto de una antigua casa mallorquina de campo y conserva aún parte del encalado de sus paredes. Allí donde había espacio se ha colocado una cama. Incluso en el antiguo salón. Las habitaciones compartidas se suceden a uno y otro lado. Algunas con la puerta abierta porque es la única ventilación que tienen, otras con las ventanas tapiadas por paneles de madera. En una de ellas aún duermen quienes han cubierto el turno nocturno: desde las seis de la tarde hasta las seis de la mañana para preparar los pedidos de los hoteles.\nTodo el conjunto tiene un aspecto destartalado. Los socios de la empresa lo conocen bien. Hace apenas veinte minutos que Toni Gili se ha marchado. Los cables cuelgan de las vigas, las columnas que sostienen el inmenso porche están agrietadas y carcomidas. Bajo su techo conviven lavadoras, sillas, extintores y carteles que indican que está prohibido fumar. Aquí y allá se acumulan cajas vacías de fruta, bidones de Repsol y garrafas con los productos utilizados en los invernaderos, algunos de los cuales son a escasos metros de las habitaciones. Además de la decena de sacos de basura amontonados junto al muro exterior, otro de los espacios en peor estado es un cobertizo en el que también se ha habilitado un dormitorio junto a una maraña de cables, tuberías, mangueras y hierros de más de un metro. de altura.\n“Cuando nos contratan nos dicen que tendremos alojamiento, pero no cómo será. Luego cuando llegas tampoco eliges si en la casa o en los contenedores, pero todos pagamos lo mismo: 80 euros al mes”, cuenta estás uno de los temporeros. Una cantidad que la empresa les descuenta directamente de la nómina y que le supone unos ingresos mensuales de 2.240 euros sólo con estas instalaciones. También incluye los servicios de electricidad y agua, de hecho también tienen agua corriente, “pero no es apta para el consumo”, nos dicen.\n“Yo no vivo así en mi país, yo tengo una casa, pero no está tan mal. Al final se trata de no gastar mucho y poder mandar a casa todo el dinero posible”, cuenta una trabajadora. Algunos se han asomado al mercado inmobiliario de Mallorca -donde la media del alquiler supera ya los 1.400 euros- y han vuelto horrorizados y aún más resignados. Por un lado, la crisis de la vivienda hace prácticamente imposible plantearse cualquier alternativa. Por otro, para quienes han llegado amparados por la orden del Ministerio de Inclusión, Seguridad Social y Migraciones, que regula la gestión colectiva de contrataciones en origen, la “puesta a disposición del trabajador de un alojamiento adecuado” es una de las obligaciones del empresario. . Un alojamiento que debe cumplir, dice el artículo 2, las condiciones de “habitabilidad e higiene adecuadas”. Su cumplimiento, añade, “podrá ser objeto de certificación y/o verificación”. Pero entre la temporada 2023 y la 2024 no hay constancia oficial de que alguien haya inspeccionado las instalaciones de Terracor.\nOtro de Vox que se salta la ley a la torera y parece que vive en otra época, porque el retraso es importante, vale, ¿cuál es la noticia? porque ese mamón va a seguir teniendo explotaciones agrícolas aunque sea un esclavista y a pesar de que le pillasen.\nSinceramente, esperaba algo mejor. Mis amigos se postularon para otros puestos en España y llegaron antes”, relata otro de los temporeros. Las fotografías que le enviaron cuando él aún estaba en Colombia eran las de un apartamento “normal” compartido. Aquello le animó a dar el paso. Tenía experiencia en el campo y pasar nueve meses en una isla del Mediterráneo no sonaba mal. Su intención era conseguir dinero para poder volver a la Universidad –tuvo que abandonar Medicina por falta de recursos- y ayudar también a su hermana a pagar los estudios. “Al llegar vi que todo era diferente, pero no me planteé irme. En Colombia decimos 'ya que metimos las patas, metamos también el cuerpo”, recuerda.\nÉl es uno de los chicos de los contenedores. Desde hace meses comparte una caseta prefabricada con otras dos personas. La literatura, la cama, la taquilla y el armario plegable apenas dejan espacio para moverse. La orden del Ministerio señala que “es recomendable” que el “espacio total habitable del dormitorio alcance un mínimo de 3,5 metros cuadrados por persona”. “Me dio vergüenza contárselo a mis amigos. No les envié ninguna foto y sólo les dije que las condiciones no eran muy aptas. A mi madre ni de chiste le cuento”, afirma. Ésa es la confesión más extendida entre sus compañeros: que la familia no sepa, no se preocupe.\nAdemás del suyo, otra media docena de contenedores prefabricados se reparten por el terreno. Incluso la caseta en la que aún cuelga el rótulo de “oficina” aloja ahora a dos trabajadores. En otra se acumulan neveras, hornillos y bombonas de butano en una suerte de segunda cocina. Más alejado, un nuevo módulo hace las veces de baño, según explican, para los chicos senegaleses. Un baño de cortinas raídas, desagües atorados y moho. El infierno en el paraíso del turismo.\nLa situación de los temporeros de Terracor sale a la luz después de que elDiario.es dedicara un reportaje a los temporeros colombianos que desde hace años llegan a Mallorca para salvar la temporada agrícola ante la falta de mano de obra local . Sólo en los dos últimos años, entre 400 y 500 ciudadanos de este país han desembarcado en la isla de la mano de Unió de Pagesos, Asaja y empresas particulares para dedicarse a la recolección y distribución de frutas y hortalizas. Junto a ellos, recorren los campos y los invernaderos otros tantos trabajadores de Senegal o Rumanía, algunos de ellos con contratos permanentes.\nConstituido en 2017, Terracor Grup tiene su sede principal en Manacor, aunque trabaja más de 305 hectáreas tanto en este municipio como en Petra, Felanitx y Porreres. Entre sus principios están el “compromiso muy firme con el respeto por nuestra tierra” y el medio ambiente, y uno de sus eslóganes principales es “democratitzam lo rural per a que tota Mallorca ho disfruti” (“democratizamos lo rural para que toda Mallorca lo disfrute”, en castellano). A través de sus seis marcas, no sólo se dedica al cultivo y comercialización de fruta y verdura, sino que también cuenta con su propio restaurante -con vistas a uno de sus invernaderos- y organiza “experiencias agrícolas y gastronómicas” para locales y turistas.\nEn 2022 la empresa inauguró su nuevo centro agrícola en la finca de Sa Teulera (Petra), desde donde comercializan hasta 8 millones de kilos de producto local al año. Además de colaborar con diversas entidades públicas y privadas de Mallorca, así como con ONG, en 2021 recibió el premio BBVA a los Mejores Productores Sostenibles.",

    "text": "El domingo pasado, River Plate y Boca Juniors protagonizaron el partido más emocionante y esperado de la actual Copa de la Liga. El encuentro que correspondía a los cuartos de final de la competencia dejó como ganador al Xeneize con un 3 a 1 luego de dar vuelta el resultado. Sin embargo, el gran atractivo de la jornada se la llevó el duelo de hinchadas que se volvieron a ver las caras luego de la final de la Copa Libertadores 2018. En este contexto, un video se viralizó en TikTok por la aparición de un perro con la camiseta azul y oro en medio de la hinchada. El equipo dirigido por Diego Martínez sigue a paso firme con este renovado Boca que busca conquistar la Copa de la Liga y la Copa Sudamericana. En el medio, se topó con el River de Martín Demichelis, que todavía no encontró el once ideal, pero que cuenta con una gran cantidad de figuras de renombre. Si bien el encuentro disputado en el Mario Alberto Kempes de Córdoba comenzó con un gol de contrataque en los pies de Miguel Borja , el Xeneize logró dar vuelta el resultado en el segundo tiempo con goles de Miguel Merentiel y Edinson Cavani. Así accedió a las semifinales del torneo local donde se enfrentará a Estudiantes de La Plata .",

    "text": "Virus Sincitial Respiratorio La vacuna contra la bronquilitis en bebés evita 10.000 hospitalizaciones este invierno España es el país en implementar la inmunización de forma tan amplia y la campaña da resultados positivos EFE La primera campaña de inmunización contra el Virus Sincitial Respiratorio (VRS), que se puso en marcha en octubre con el medicamento nirsevimab para proteger a los menores de un año de complicaciones como la [bronquiolitis ](/tags/bronquiolitis/)o la [neumonía](/tags/neumonia/), ha evitado desde entonces casi 10.000 hospitalizaciones de bebés. Así lo pone de manifiesto la evaluación que ha realizado el [Ministerio de Sanidad](/tags/ministerio-de-sanidad/) junto con las comunidades y el Centro Nacional de Epidemiología del Instituto de Salud Carlos III sobre la efectividad y el impacto de nirsevimab para prevenir la enfermedad grave -no la infección, puesto que no es esterilizante-. Con coberturas que han rebasado en algunas comunidades el 90 %, los resultados desvelan que la inmunización con el anticuerpo monoclonal nirsevimab, que España ha sido el primer país en aplicar de forma masiva, redujo el riesgo de hospitalización en un 83 % en los menores de 6 meses inmunizados. Los ingresos de los [bebés ](/tags/bebes/)de hasta 1 año de edad han caído un 75 % respecto a los que se estimaba que se iban a producir en este grupo, lo que se traduce en cerca de 10.000 hospitalizaciones evitadas. El VRS es la principal causa de infecciones en las vías respiratorias inferiores en la población infantil menor de un año, especialmente las relacionadas con bronquiolitis y neumonía; en España, las infecciones causadas por este virus provocan todos los inviernos una importante sobrecarga asistencial, tanto en atención primaria, como en urgencias y hospitales. Nirsevimab empezó a darse en octubre del año pasado a menores de 6 meses nacidos a partir del 1 abril de 2023 y hasta el 31 de marzo de este año, así como a bebés de riesgo de hasta 2 años; para la próxima temporada, ya está disponible la vacuna frente a VRS para embarazadas, que ofrecerá protección a los lactantes por el paso de anticuerpos durante el embarazo y que está pendiente de inclusión en el calendario vacunal. Después de un periodo de distorsión provocado por la [covid-19,](/tags/coronavirus/) el sincitial, como otros virus, volvió a circular con fuerza en la temporada 2022-2023 hasta recuperar su comportamiento y valores habituales precovid en la sucesiva. De esta forma, su impacto en esta última temporada ha sido menor, según los datos del ISCIII: hasta marzo, el VRS dejó 465.723 infecciones atendidas en Atención Primaria (casi la mitad que las 877.252 de la temporada previa) y 21.190 hospitalizaciones frente a 34.632 ocurridas en 2022-2023. Las máximas tasas de ingresos se produjeron en menores de 1 año (3.329, el 15,7 % del total por VRS) en comparación con las 13.432 (38,8 %) de la temporada anterior.

When asked why he had the ratchet knife in his pocket, Beckford explained that he was just carrying it while driving home from work.\nHowever, the judge dismissed his explanation and imposed a fine of $2,000 or a 10-day prison sentence.\nJudge Wilson then asked Beckford, “What you learn from this?” to which Beckford replied he would refrain from repeating the offence.",
