    "title": "CONCERT REVIEW: Lil Baby hosts an epic birthday party",
    "text": "Earlier this year, when Lil Baby announced his first multi-city tour as a solo headliner, fans were stunned that there weren’t any Atlanta dates. In fact, before the “It’s Only Us” tour began, the Oakland City native quietly canceled 10 dates and dropped Kid LaRoi as an opening act — leading some to speculate about low ticket sales. The canceled dates even led to debates online about whether he can carry his own tour.\nSure, he’s one of the top-selling rappers, but is he a good performer?\nAt his third annual Lil Baby & Friends Birthday Celebration, the answer was undoubtedly yes. Wednesday night’s show at State Farm Arena proved that he no only has the captivating stage presence, but he has the love from friends and industry peers to help him along the way. For the rapper, who was born on Dec. 3, the concert was the epitome of a grand birthday party that’d make anyone envious if they weren’t invited.\nIt must be said that the concert had a 7 p.m. start time and Lil Baby didn’t appear on stage until a few minutes before 10 p.m. (Memphis rapper Gloss Up, one of the supporting acts for the “It’s Only Us” tour, opened the show around 8 p.m. with a 30-minute set that slightly alleviated the long wait). The wait was so perplexing that some fans even wondered if any of his friends would show up at all.\nLil baby and his friends must fell out??\n— a pisces gworlll 💖💘💕✨🌑 (@lolyesimlying) December 28, 2023 But all the doubt subsided as soon as Lil Baby graced the stage. Suddenly, the long wait didn’t seem to matter anymore as the sold-out crowd rapped along to opening tracks like “Stand on It,” “My Dawg” and “Southside.” Wearing a red leather jacket and pants to match, he seamlessly embodied the persona of a rap superstar who’ll always be adored in Atlanta. And that adoration is reciprocal. The concert felt like a love letter to the Atlanta fans who’ve made Lil Baby one of the biggest rappers in the world.\nExplore PHOTOS: Lil Baby draws star power for birthday bash Last year’s Lil Baby & Friends Birthday Celebration featured appearances from Drake, Lil Yachty and more. This year’s show carried the same level of star power. Rappers like Quavo, Rob49, Hunxho, 2 Chainz and Rylo Rodriguez — who was met with fans rapping every word to his hit “Equal Dirt”— took the stage earlier in the show. In between those sets, Lil Baby continued the momentum by performing songs like “Pure Cocaine” and “Sum 2 Prove.”\nCredit: Robb Cohen for the Atlanta Journ\nCredit: Robb Cohen for the Atlanta Journ\nAnd if that wasn’t enough, R&B crooner Fridayy, Detroit rappers 42 Dugg and Veeze, 21 Savage and Lil Durk (who performed DJ Khaled’s “Every Chance I Get” with Lil Baby) also hit the stage. The highlight of the night arrived when J. Cole performed hits like “Middle Child” and “No Role Modelz.”\nThe show ended with final appearances from the City Girls’ Yung Miami and Atlanta singer Jacquees. Dressed in all-black this time, Lil Baby concluded the night with his hit “Freestyle.” But he didn’t even need to perform the song. The crowd performed it for him, rapping each verse with the fervor of knowing that the hit is indeed an anthemic track for Atlanta hip-hop.\nLil Baby is Atlanta rap’s star of the moment. With three no. 1 albums (his latest, “It’s Only Me,” was released in 2022) and more than a dozen top 10 hits under his belt, the 29-year-old rapper has become a household name in less than five years. Wednesday night’s show was a stunning celebration full of surprises that proved the secret to Lil Baby’s skyrocketing success is his unyielding fanbase.\nRelated Credit: Henri Hollis\nReview: Rapper’s Atlanta seafood spot is casual, messy and fun About the Author\nDeAsia Paige DeAsia is an award-winning music and culture journalist whose work has been featured in Pitchfork, NPR Music, Teen Vogue and more.

They were astonished to learn that practitioners following the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance had been imprisoned, tortured, and their organs harvested for transplant surgeries. [Falun Gong practitioners tell people the facts about their cultivation practice.](/u/article_images/2024-3-26-italy-vomero-06.jpg) Many thanked the practitioners for telling them what was happening in China.

    "text": "(ST. JOSEPH, Mo.) On Nov. 11, 2024, Missouri Western State University's Nursing Program and Mosaic Life Care entered a new partnership to provide financial, academic and career support to nursing students. Mosaic and the university will cover three years of tuition for students and give them opportunities to work at Mosaic, thanks to the Nursing Scholars of Promise (NSP) program. Missouri Western State University President Elizabeth Kennedy said \"Even though Missouri Western has the fourth lowest cost tuition in the state, reducing cost is always one of our goals. So talking with Mosaic and looking at what their needs were, you know, so many of our graduates go into Mosaic to work.\" \"They'll have a special mentor, and this will be someone who will help them academically when they begin as freshmen, to make sure that they're doing well in their courses. They'll also have the opportunity to work part time at Mosaic, 12 hours a week during the academic year and summer, if that works out, which is always helpful for our students,\" Kennedy concluded. With the new partnership, Mosaic Life Care CEO, Mike Poore, is excited to continue using the hospital as a learning environment for students. Poore said \"If you're able to work in the hospital, you understand that a nurse is not a nurse. That's not a nurse. There are oncology nurses and intensive care nurses and (OR) nurses, and the ability to work in the hospital before you become a nurse, gets you to understand where your interest may be and focus on what you wanted to be as a nurse getting out. \"I mean, I'll hire every nurse that graduates from here. They have such a great program. You know, we talked about the NCLEX, 100% pass rate that really talks to the quality of nurse that we have here, but more of it too is that these students actually get to work inside our hospital, that they'll have opportunities to work inside our hospital,\" Poore concluded.

    "text": "GENOVA (ITALPRESS) - Una vittoria fondamentale per chiudere con largo anticipo il discorso salvezza. Il Monza vince 3-2 contro il Genoa dopo la rimonta subita dai padroni di casa, decisiva la rete di Daniel Maldini che regala la decima vittoria stagionale a Raffaele Palladino. Nel prossimo turno i brianzoli sfideranno il Cagliari. I liguri, ancora a +10 sul Sassuolo e sul terz'ultimo posto, sfideranno la Juventus. La gara del Ferraris si è infiammata immediatamente, alla prima vera occasione la squadra di Palladino è passata in vantaggio: assist di testa di Colpani all'8' del primo tempo, per Pessina è stato semplicissimo ribadire in rete. Il vantaggio dei lombardi ha scosso i padroni di casa, dopo dieci minuti Dany Mota si è inventato un gol da copertina, sempre su assist di Colpani: sforbiciata dal limite e pallone praticamente imparabile per Martinez. Al 26' i biancorossi, in maglia bianca da trasferta, hanno sfiorato la terza rete con una conclusione violenta dalla distanza da parte dello stesso Colpani, il pallone però si è schiantato sul palo grazie anche alla deviazione del portiere rossoblù. Viste le premesse, Gilardino nella ripresa ha stravolto la squadra con tre cambi, Spence, Malinovskyi e Vitinha sono entrati rispettivamente al posto di Vogliacco, Strootman e Frendrup. Il nuovo assetto tattico ha sorpreso gli ospiti, al 6' di gioco Feliciani, richiamato dal Var, ha assegnato un calcio di rigore al Grifone per un fallo di mano di Pablo Marì: dal dischetto Gudmundsson si è fatto prima ipnotizzare da Di Gregorio, poi sulla respinta l'islandese ha accorciato le distanze. Il pareggio è arrivato al 23' dopo un errore in mediana di Akpa-Apro, Vitinha ha preso palla sulla trequarti per poi inventarsi il piazzato sul palo lontano. Nel momento migliore del Genoa il Monza è tornato nuovamente in vantaggio con una ripartenza fulminea, sul tiro di Valentin Carboni - respinto da Martinez -, il più veloce è stato Daniel Maldini, entrato in campo da pochi minuti. In pieno recupero i padroni di casa hanno sfiorato la rete in una mischia confusa nell'area avversaria, ma Di Gregorio è riuscito a tenere il pallone sulla linea.- Foto Image -(ITALPRESS).\nIn Breve\nsabato 09 marzo\nChe tempo fa\nAccadeva un anno fa\nCronaca\nCronaca\nTI RICORDI COSA È SUCCESSO L’ANNO SCORSO A MARZO?\nAscolta il podcast con le notizie da non dimenticare\nAscolta \"Un anno di notizie da non dimenticare\" su Spreaker.",
