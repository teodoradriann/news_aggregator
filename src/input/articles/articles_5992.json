    "title": "Sleepless in Kyiv: Ukraine faces constant drone attacks - Times of India",
    "text": "KYIV: In the early hours of September 26, the familiar sound of air raid alerts filled the skies over Kyiv, starting at 4.30 am and lasting until 7.30 am. Residents once again took refuge in bomb shelters as Russian drones targeted the capital, leading to explosions across several districts. For many, sleepless nights have become routine as drone attacks and air raid warnings disrupt the city's rhythm.The full-scale scale war, which began in Feb 2022, continues with full force, with Russia regularly sending drones into Ukrainian airspace. The people of Kyiv and other regions have become accustomed to hours spent in bomb shelters, especially at night. While some have grown immune to the alarms, choosing to stay at home despite the danger, others continue to face the stress of running for safety every night.\"I heard the Shahid engine just minutes ago, followed by air defence shots,\" said Volodymyr Solovian, a hybrid warfare analyst in Kyiv. \"These drones usually move behind the Dnipro river, and this time I saw air defence tracers over the Dnipro. Drone attacks on Kyiv have become frequent, happening five or six times a month.\"The scale of the aerial threat is immense. According to official data, from February 24, 2022 to September 25, 2024, a total of 47,577 air raid alerts were issued across 141 Ukrainian districts. Of these, 1,270 alerts were in Kyiv, with the average alert lasting one hour and nine minutes. The longest recorded alert lasted an exhausting 50 hours and 30 minutes. Most air raids are triggered between midnight and 6 am, and officials imposed curfew round the year during these hours.113718552Out of all the alerts, around 12,740 explosions were reported, meaning that about one in four warnings turned into actual missile or drone strikes. These figures exclude artillery shelling, which has also become a constant threat in the eastern region of Ukraine bordering Russia. The regions of Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia have seen the highest number of air alerts, while Kherson, Sumy, Donetsk, and Kharkiv have reported the most explosions.Iryna Valenkeych, a 70-year-old resident of Borodianka, spoke of the fear that grips her every night. \"Every day is a nightmare,\" she said. \"We are afraid when we go to sleep. Air alerts sound six times a night. We are scared.\" She recounted the story of her family where her brother was killed by Russian forces earlier in the war, making the nightly alarms even more terrifying.In Kyiv and Lviv cities, bomb shelters have become an essential part of daily life. Converted cellars and underground floors of commercial buildings are now used as safe spaces. Metro stations serve as a refuge for many urban residents. In the village of Moschun, in Kyiv region, even an underground billiards room has been turned into a shelter.The impact on children is especially concerning. Inna Sovsun, a people's deputy (member of Parliament) from the opposition Holos Party, described the strain on her 11-year-old son. \"We live in constant fear of air raid alerts. The children are under extreme pressure. In Oct 2022 my son asked me if we were going to die during one of the alerts. He was scared it might be a nuclear bomb. It's heartbreaking that kids are being taught how to survive a nuclear attack at school,\" she said.As Kyiv and other regions across Ukraine continue to face relentless air attacks, Ukrainian air defence forces are working to intercept the drones.While Kyiv remains under constant threat, residents are doing their best to cope with the daily uncertainty and fear, hoping for a time when the air raid alarms fall silent for good.",

He previously said a doctor recommended he try the pig kidney when he was diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease.\nLast month, Slayman’s doctors said a new kidney could last years, but there are also many unknowns in animal-to-human transplants.

    "text": "A Remedy Entertainment, estúdio responsável por títulos como Control e Alan Wake, revelou detalhes de seu novo projeto multiplayer, FBC: Firebreak. Durante a transmissão Xbox Partner Preview, o estúdio apresentou o primeiro trailer de gameplay do jogo. Além disso, destacou que ele marcará a estreia da Remedy no gênero multiplayer cooperativo.\nFBC: Firebreak é um jogo de tiro em primeira pessoa cooperativo para três jogadores. De acordo com Thomas Puha, Diretor de Comunicações da Remedy, o objetivo é oferecer uma experiência divertida e acessível. Dessa forma, que isso permita aos jogadores enfrentarem missões agitadas com seus amigos.\nAlém disso, o estúdio revelou que a narrativa é ambientada no mesmo universo de Control. Entretanto, o estúdio se esforça para deixar claro que o jogo não é uma sequência nem uma expansão.\nNo jogo, o jogador assume o papel de um agente do Federal Bureau of Control (FBC). Ele enfrenta ameaças paranaturais na Casa Antiga, sede do FBC. Equipados com “paranatural augments”, os agentes têm acesso a habilidades especiais, como foi mostrado no trailer. O destaque vai para uma arma em forma de gnomo de jardim.\nLeia mais\nTencent concede empréstimo de 15 milhões de euros à Remedy Control 2 não será impactado por demissões na Annapurna Interactive Alan Wake e Control virarão filmes com acordo entre Remedy e Annapurna Remedy reforça que FBC: Firebreak não possui ligação com Control Além disso, a Remedy vem explorando novos desafios com esse projeto. Apesar de ser o primeiro multiplayer do estúdio, a equipe trouxe novos talentos para colaborar na criação do jogo. Entretanto, eles mantiveram um núcleo de desenvolvedores experientes para garantir que o projeto preserve as características marcantes da empresa.\nPor fim, mesmo sendo uma experiência cooperativa, a Remedy continua fiel ao seu estilo de narrativas envolventes. Dessa forma, Kayatta explicou que, embora FBC: Firebreak se passe após os eventos de Control, os jogadores não precisam ter jogado o título anterior para entender a história.\nFoto: Divulgação/Remedy Entertainment Porém, aqueles que conhecem o jogo anterior encontrarão diversas referências e elementos familiares do universo de Control. FBC: Firebreak tem previsão de lançamento para 2025, com versões para Xbox Series X|S e PC, e estará disponível no Game Pass no dia do lançamento. O estúdio, por fim, promete atualizações constantes e novos conteúdos após o lançamento.\nFonte: Xbox\nConteúdo Relacionado números impressionantes\nControl foi jogado por quase 20 milhões de jogadores",

    "text": "10. Achraf Hakimi (Marocco, Paris Saint-Germain) - In August: 2 goals, 2 assists. [Achraf Hakimi](https://www.transfermarkt.com/achraf-hakimi/profil/spieler/398073) was a key player for [Morocco](https://news.22bet.com/wiki/national-teams/morocco/) at the [Olympic Games](https://news.22bet.com/tag/olympic-games/) in August. His performances helped the African team reach the semi-finals of the tournament and ultimately secure a bronze medal. Even in the match they lost [against Spain](https://news.22bet.com/predictions/morocco-vs-spain-football-summer-olympic-games-05-08-2024/), Hakimi managed six tackles and four assists, which could have made a difference for Morocco in their quest for the final. The best way to come back home! +3🔫 [pic.twitter.com/IzAMIKba7H]— Achraf Hakimi (@AchrafHakimi) [August 23, 2024] Post-Olympics, Achraf performed brilliantly in three matches in the French league and was the best player against Montpellier. Hakimi is undoubtedly one of the best full-backs in world football right now. 9. Federico Valverde (Real Madrid) - In August: 2 goals,1 assist. [Federico Valverde](https://www.whoscored.com/Players/344644/Show/Federico-Valverde) has become a crucial player for [Real Madrid](https://news.22bet.com/wiki/club-teams/real-madrid/) in recent years. The Spanish midfielder is versatile and capable of delivering high-quality performances in almost any role on the pitch. Nominated for the 2024 Ballon d’Or Federico Valverde Real Madrid Uruguay[#ballondor][pic.twitter.com/5jrvYAan4c]— Ballon d’Or (@ballondor) [September 4, 2024] He significantly contributes to defensive efforts and effectively transitions from attack to defense. This has become especially important following the arrival of another attacking player, [Kylian Mbappé](https://news.22bet.com/wiki/players/kylian-mbappe/), a forward less inclined toward defensive duties. In addition, Valverde outplays opponents with his strong dribbling and regularly creates openings in the opponent’s penalty area, occasionally scoring goals. 8. Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen) - In August: 3 goals, 1 assist. [Wirtz](https://www.fotmob.com/en-GB/players/1152455/florian-wirtz) was the best player in the [Bundesliga](https://news.22bet.com/tag/bundesliga-2023-24/) last season, and it is crucial for [Leverkusen](https://news.22bet.com/wiki/club-teams/bayer-leverkusen/) that Florian stays at the club for as long as possible. After all, he continues to be the creative engine of the team, regularly orchestrating dangerous moments in the final third. Not The Result we wanted but I am still proud of my team [#B04RBL][pic.twitter.com/0JjhEuhI7O]— Florian wirtz (@FlorianWirtz10) [September 1, 2024] 7. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Napoli) - In August: 1 goal, 1 assist. After Antonio Conte’s arrival as Napoli’s head coach, it became clear that [Khvicha Kvaratskhelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khvicha_Kvaratskhelia) would have to adapt to the team’s new 3-4-3 formation. Conte prefers a system with three central defenders and two wing-backs, while Kvaratskhelia thrived as a left forward in a 4-3-3 / 4-2-3-1 formation. Despite the shift, the Georgian is adjusting well to the new system and effectively operates in the left half-space. In the new season, “Kvaradona “could emerge as one of [Serie A’s](https://news.22bet.com/tag/serie-a-24-25/) top performers this season. 6. Marcus Thuram (Inter Milan) - In August: 5 goals. [Marcus Thuram](https://www.sofascore.com/player/marcus-thuram/791702) has made an explosive start to the season, scoring 5 goals in August, inlcuding two braces – one of which came in a crucial victory against [Atalanta](https://news.22bet.com/predictions/inter-vs-atalanta-match-preview-prediction-betting-tips-30-08-2024/). After netting 13 goals in Serie A last season, Thuram is already proving instrumental in Inter Milan’s quest to defend their league title.

Mason Greenwood (Olympique de Marseille) - In August: 6 goals. [Mason Greenwood](https://www.transfermarkt.com/mason-greenwood/profil/spieler/532826) is fully showcasing his talent under Roberto De Zerbi’s guidance at [Olympique de Marseille](https://www.om.fr/en) and could well compete for the title of top scorer in [Ligue 1](https://news.22bet.com/tag/ligue-1-24-25/). De Zerbi on Mason Greenwood: “Mason is a very high level player, we all wanted him, the owner also got involved in person. There has been so much controversy, so much talk, but we all see the player on the pitch. I don’t want to get into his private life, I don’t know anything… [pic.twitter.com/lD4wqtfSoj]— Kara (@UTDKara) [September 1, 2024] Greenwood has scored in five consecutive matches and shows no signs of stopping, as he is in excellent physical condition. His transfer from Manchester United for €26 million this summer looks like a bargain, as he could have been a valuable asset for the [Premier League](https://news.22bet.com/tag/premier-league-24-25/) side. 4. Bukayo Saka (Arsenal) In August: 1 goal, 3 assists. [Bukayo Saka](https://www.whoscored.com/Players/367185/Show/Bukayo-Saka) has quickly achieved peak physical condition among the English players who represented the national team in [Euro 2024](https://news.22bet.com/tag/uefa-euro-2024/) and has already become [Arsenal’s](https://news.22bet.com/wiki/club-teams/arsenal/) standout player in August. Bukayo Saka remains the only Arsenal player in history to score or assist against every team he’s faced in the Premier League ⚽️🎯 [pic.twitter.com/yWHe4gBZwu]— ESPN UK (@ESPNUK) [September 5, 2024] Saka is valuable in fast combinations and maneuvers. Most importantly, he dangerously shoots at the goal from different positions. He also excellently performs varied crosses and cutbacks into the opponents’ penalty area. While he has scored only one goal, he is poised to become Arsenal’s top scorer again. 3. Erling Haaland (Manchester City) - In August: 10 goals Pep Guardiola continues integrating the Norwegian forward into his attacking model, leveraging Haaland’s remarkable ability to convert chances. No club has scored more Premier League goals than Erling Haaland this season 💀🤖 [pic.twitter.com/FxTdUEUINy]— OneFootball (@OneFootball) [September 3, 2024] Although [Haaland](https://www.sofascore.com/player/erling-haaland/839956) is minimally involved in combinations with his teammates, his efficiency in the penalty area is unparalleled. With 10 goals in August alone, Haaland is proving once again that he is one of the world’s most dangerous strikers. 2. Raphinha (Barcelona) - In August: 3 goals, 3 assist In recent years, European journalists have speculated about whether [Barcelona](https://news.22bet.com/wiki/club-teams/barcelona/) truly needs [Raphinha](https://www.whoscored.com/Players/300447/Show/Raphinha). Over the summer, there were even rumors that the Brazilian might leave the team, as he had few chances on the right flank, where he had to compete with the brilliant young talent Lamine Yamal. But Hansi Flick was able to maximize Raphinha’s best qualities by giving him more attacking freedom in the area between the lines. Raphinha Rises. [pic.twitter.com/TBdZr9H6X6]— FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) [September 4, 2024] Raphinha effectively beats defenders 1v1, makes penetrating passes into the penalty area, creates multi-pass combinations with teammates, and makes well-timed runs behind opponents into the penalty area. At the same time, he is very useful in pressing. If he continues to play like this, he could be in contention for the title of La Liga’s best player this season. 1. Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) In August: 4 goals, 4 assists. As has become tradition, [Mohamed Salah](https://www.sofascore.com/player/mohamed-salah/159665) is demonstrating top-class performance after the summer break, making a strong case for being considered the world’s best player. The rested Egyptian consistently makes a difference in the first part of the season but gradually slows down after January. They don’t really believe that Mohamed Salah is among the top 30 players in the world Hahaha wth this award has lost its credibility. [pic.twitter.com/AxD5iSYiIw]— ⁷𝐸¹¹ (@spumar7T) [September 4, 2024] Salah particularly feels the strain of the intense Premier League schedule from November to mid-January, exacerbated by his trip to the African Cup of Nations last year. However, just like in previous seasons, Salah is unstoppable in August and brings immense value to [Liverpool](https://news.22bet.com/wiki/club-teams/liverpool/), making a difference in every match. Salah is so magnificent in all attacking phases of play that it’s impossible not to place him at the top of the list of the best players in August 2024.",
