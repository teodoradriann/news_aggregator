    "text": "This photo taken on Nov. 1, 2024 shows an outdoor installation featuring \"Double 11\" shopping festival at Alibaba Group's Xixi Park in Hangzhou, east China's Zhejiang Province. (Xinhua/Huang Zongzhi) BEIJING, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Qwen foundation model, developed by China's Alibaba Group, has spawned over 100,000 derived models, claiming the top spot globally. This advancement comes as the e-commerce giant continues to ramp up its investment in AI, aiming to bring about transformative changes to its business landscape.\nAlibaba recently announced that it would invest more than 380 billion yuan (about 53 billion U.S. dollars) in building cloud and AI hardware infrastructure in the next three years.\n\"We will focus on the domestic and overseas e-commerce business, cloud computing technologies and internet platform products,\" said Eddie Wu, Alibaba Group's CEO, at an earnings call in February.\nThe development of AI is bringing about significant changes to the industry, Wu said. \"Our planned investment in cloud and AI infrastructure over the next three years is set to exceed what we have spent over the past decade.\"\nThe substantial investment increase in research and development of basic AI models is expected to uphold the group's advanced technologies and its leading position in the industry, while also driving the development of AI native applications.\nAlibaba Group is an important player in the AI landscape within the Asian market, boasting the largest cloud services scale in Asia and ranking fourth globally.\nThrough deep integration of cloud and AI technologies, Alibaba Cloud aims to become one of the largest cloud computing networks delivering AI intelligence.\n\"We anticipate 90 percent of future tokens, intelligent output generated by models, will be created and processed through cloud networks, as only cloud architecture can efficiently handle such massive computational demands,\" Wu said.\nHe said the next three years could be the most intense and substantial period for cloud infrastructure development in Alibaba's history.\nLeveraging its globally distributed data centers, the company will deliver these resources to application developers worldwide with unparalleled speed and accessibility, Wu said.\n\"If AI is one of the most common commodities in the future, just like electricity today, then cloud computing networks would perform like a power grid,\" he said.\nAlibaba will also keep advancing AI integration with its e-commerce platform Taobao to redefine lifestyle consumption.\nTaobao is developing multiple AI-driven initiatives to enhance consumer engagement and transaction efficiency. The upcoming AI-powered solutions will also be applied across various consumption scenarios, including purchase decisions, Wu said.\n\"We believe AI serves as an important driver in elevating Taobao's user engagement and commercial value,\" he said.\nAlibaba is also considering evolving its Amap from a navigation tool into a lifestyle services gateway by embedding AI innovations. With its massive 170 million daily active user base, Amap will hopefully become China's next-generation AI-driven platform for location-based consumer experiences, Wu said.\nTo meet the AI development needs of consumer business, Alibaba Group has recently announced hundreds of recruitment positions. AI technology and product related research and development positions account for 90 percent of these new positions. They will be engaged in the cutting-edge technologies and applications such as text, multi-modal large models and AI Agent.\n\"We take AI as a once-in-a-generation industry transformation opportunity. Our primary goal is to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), continuously pushing the boundaries of model intelligence,\" Wu said. ■",

    "text": "Miles de sevillanos han arropado a los Reyes Magos desde su salida a las 16,30 horas de este viernes desde la Fábrica de Tabacos, sede de la Universidad de Sevilla (US), tras ser coronados Melchor, Gaspar y Baltasar por el rector de la US, Miguel Ángel Castro; el arzobispo de Sevilla, José Ángel Saiz Meneses; y el alcalde de la ciudad, José Luis Sanz. Tras las fuertes precipitaciones que acompañaron al Heraldo en la tarde de este pasado jueves, lo que no impidió que el alcalde le entregara las llaves de la ciudad, un cielo despejado ha contribuido a dar más brillo aún a una cabalgata llena de colorido, alegría y música. El cortejo, formado por 33 carrozas, ha arrancado desde la calle Palos de la Frontera con un primer puñado de caramelos tirado al cielo en señal de recuerdo a los que ya no están y a los sones de la Agrupación Musical Virgen de los Reyes, a la que se unen otras seis bandas más. En total y hasta las 22,00 horas, se reparten 100.000 kilos de caramelos y, este año como novedad, 1.500 kilos de mojama en envases de quince gramos cada uno para no ocasionar incidentes. El cortejo está compuesto por 3.000 integrantes, tiene 45 minutos de paso y el mismo recorrido que en 2023. Durante el recorrido, tanto el arzobispo de Sevilla como el regidor sevillano han entregado caramelos a pie de calle. Este año, los Reyes Magos están encarnados por Jesús Vera Carrillo (Melchor), presidente y fundador de la promotora inmobiliaria ABU; Federico Alonso Aliste (Gaspar), director médico y CEO de Tecnoláser Clinic Vision, y José Luis Cabeza Hernández (Baltasar), fundador de Mesón Serranito. La cantante Laura Gallego es la diosa Palas Atenea -que micro en mano se ha arrancado con canciones para animar a los sevillanos- y el Mago de la Fantasía lo representa Andrés Morilla, director de HiperHostelería RV. El Gran Visir lo encarna Carlos Navarro Antolín, subdirector de Diario de Sevilla y la Estrella de la Ilusión, Margarita Cabanás Jiménez, jefa del Servicio de Oftalmología del Hospital Virgen del Rocío de Sevilla. La Estrella, finalmente, no lanza entradas de Icónica -el festival de música que se celebra en verano en la Plaza de España- \"por motivos de seguridad\" pero sí repartirá la mañlana del 6 de enero cien \"tarjetas de la ilusión\" premiadas con una entrada doble para asistir a uno de los conciertos de Icónica Sevilla Fest, de entre un total de 50.000, por \"lugares emblemáticos de la ciudad que han sido fuente de inspiración de diez temas de artistas icónicos de los más diversos estilos y géneros\". La comitiva de Sus Majestades de Oriente cuenta con cuatro carrozas dedicadas a la celebración de efemérides del Cuerpo Nacional de Policía, con 200 años de extistencia; la Universidad Pablo de Olavide (UPO), que conmemora sus 25ª aniversario, y los colegios oficiales de Ingenieros Industriales y de Economistas de Sevilla. A estas carrozas se suma una dedicada al Consejo Regulador de la Mojama de Barbate (Cádiz) y Mojama de Isla Cristina (Huelva), que es la que reparte los blister de mojama. El Ayuntamiento, como cada año, ha preparado un dispositivo especial de Policía compuesto en esta ocasión por 188 agentes. Toda la flota de vehículos está disponible para este día, distribuida por los barrios y por las dos cabalgatas que se celebran esta misma tarde, participando un total de 90 vehículos, entre patrulleros y todoterrenos, y 63 motos. La Policía Local ha verificado los permisos de conducir de los conductores de las carrozas y se efectuarán controles de alcoholemia a los mismos. Además del operativo de tráfico, cinco equipos de intervención de la Policía controlarán también los espacios cercanos al recorrido de la cabalgata a fin de garantizar la seguridad exterior del evento y poder intervenir en cualquier momento.

    "text": "A hunchback with a deformed neck, a child decapitated by a soldier and a woman with a bloodied face make, among other unusual characters, the three-century-old nativity scene presented in a monastery in the center of Ecuador's capital.\nComposed of 300 rooms, the singular nativity scene belongs to the Carmelite Descalzas, nuns who have been living in Ecuador since 1653. The collection is part of the Carmen Alto Museum, located in the historic heart of Quito.\nDepictions of indigenous people His figurines, dating from the 18th to the early 20th century, depict biblical scenes such as the Flight into Egypt, the Massacre of the Innocents or the Adolescent Jesus in the Temple. In the middle of these biblical representations, presented in a wing of the monastery transformed into a museum, are figures from the daily life of the colonial era. \" Seeing pieces that illustrate interculturality and diversity in the city is very interesting. We have representations of indigenous people, Afro-descendants, and even chapetones ,\" as the Spanish conquistadors and settlers were called, Gabriela Mena, coordinator of the museum, told AFP.\nAmong the figurines are several figures of the indigenous Yumbo people, with painted faces and feather ornaments on their heads. The figurines of the Afro-descendants wear \" French-style, very ornate\" outfits , says Noralma Suarez, head of the museum's reserve, which is exhibiting these pieces until the first quarter of 2024.\nThe nativity scene includes varied scenes such as mothers nursing their babies, a hunchback showing his neck deformed by the effects of goiter, and a domestic violence scene in which a man threatens a woman with a bottle, while she appears to be recoiling with a child on her back and a bloodied face.\nRacism and machismo Some figurines are up to 50 cm tall, including those depicting Mary, Joseph and Jesus. Others are just a few centimetres long. This nativity scene, which is set up each year under a different contemporary theme such as migration or natural disasters, makes it possible to \" highlight, to feel certain things that were happening at a given moment in history ,\" says Noralma Suarez.\nThis year, the installation aims to provoke reflection on women traders who work informally and rarely have the opportunity to enjoy Christmas with their families due to the workload. Rag dolls, representing these women and their children, are the first new pieces to be integrated into the unusual nativity scene. These figures mingle with the old ones that highlight artistic techniques such as sgraffito, collage or the technique of rubbing a sheep's bladder on the sculpture to give it a smoother finish.\nRead also\"Christmas: The Flame of Hope\"\nReducing this nativity scene to \" a beautiful popular and cultural tradition can lead us to make it folkloric (...) some of the things that are depicted in it ,\" notes Gabriela Mena, citing the roles attributed to indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples or violence.\nThis is why the crèche uses old prejudices as a pretext to engage in a reflection on themes such as racism, machismo or poverty. \" It's like moving the structures of the museum and making everything stand in question ,\" she says.",

    "title": "Chiefs cheerleaders are ready to celebrate another Super Bowl win with this crazy tradition",
    "text": "The Kansas City Chiefs cheerleaders have a unique and heartfelt way of commemorating their Super Bowl appearances-by getting tattoos. This tradition has evolved into a cherished ritual for the squad, ensuring that their unforgettable moments on the NFL's biggest stage are permanently etched in their memories. It's not just about the game; it's about the bonds formed and the experiences shared.\nIn a TikTok video shared after the Chiefs' 2024 Super Bowl victory, veteran cheerleader Stefanie Hill unveiled this \"crazy tradition.\" Hill explained, \"We have this crazy tradition where we get tattoos every time we go to a Super Bowl.\"\nFilmed in March 2024, the clip captures Hill and her fellow cheerleaders arriving at Definitive Tattoo Gallery, the same studio they visited the previous year. \"Last year, we went to Definitive Tattoo Gallery and we absolutely loved it, so we're back!\" she added enthusiastically, showcasing the excitement that surrounds this annual event.\nRelated:\nFor Hill, this visit marked her fourth Super Bowl appearance and her fourth tattoo. She proudly displayed the Roman numerals inked on her foot from previous championships: Super Bowl LIV, Super Bowl LVII, and Super Bowl LVIII. Now, she was there to add another milestone to her collection-Super Bowl LIX. Reflecting on her journey, Hill shared that this tattoo would be particularly significant as she had just completed her \"sixth and final season\" with the Chiefs cheerleading squad. This adds a layer of nostalgia, making the experience even more poignant.\nThe inspiring tradition of Chiefs cheer squad\nThe video also showcased the camaraderie among the team as they filled the tattoo studio, laughing and sharing stories. While this tradition has become a beloved part of their Super Bowl experience, Hill made it clear that participation is entirely optional. \"It is not a requirement to get a tattoo,\" she emphasized, highlighting the personal choice involved in this meaningful ritual. Many of her teammates chose to join in, with some opting for matching designs while others expressed their individuality through different tattoos.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs cheerleaders have become a vibrant part of the team's culture, celebrating their achievements in ways that go beyond the sidelines. Their tattoos serve as lasting reminders of the hard work, dedication, and unforgettable moments they've shared on football's grandest stage. Each design tells a story, representing not just victories but the spirit of teamwork and the joy of being part of something greater than themselves. As the Chiefs continue their journey in the playoffs, all eyes will be on the cheer squad to see if they keep this heartwarming tradition alive.",

    "text": "Anthony Edwards Accuses Ex of 'Sabotage' and Using $5K in Child Support to Fund Lavish Lifestyle The paternity case between [NBA star](https://www.enstarz.com/tags/nba) Anthony Edwards and his ex-bae, Daja Carlyle, have heated up after the baller accused her of \"harassing\" his associates and using child support payments to fund her lavish lifestyle. The [Minnesota Timberwolves](https://www.enstarz.com/tags/nba-basketball)' baller claimed his ex harassed members of his administration team, and claims she attempted to have her support payments increased due to her unwillingness to get a job. The 23-year-old's lawyer has weighed in on the legal matter, writing on behalf of his client in a recent motion in the ongoing paternity case between him and his daughter's mother.

These individuals are part of the [Anthony']s team of representatives, including those working for [Anthony's] agency,\" per '[The Jasmine Brand](https://thejasminebrand.com/2024/10/24/anthony-edwards-accuses-ex-girlfriend-of-harassing-his-associates-using-child-support-payments-on-herself/).' \"The communications vary from demands to speak to [Anthony], threats about what is to come if [Anthony]and his attorneys do not abide by her demands,\" the lawyer continued. \"There is no rhyme or reason for [Daja] to contact individuals who work for [Anthony],\" he wrote. \"This attempt to sabotage the Father's personal and professional relationships must end.\" In what appears to be the effort to be active and supportive in his daughter's life, the basketball star opted to have his name listed as the child's biological father, in addition to submitting a request for joint physical and legal custody per a petition he filed in February, per the media outlet. That said, he didn't get the response he may have been looking for, as Carlyle reportedly rejected Edwards' request. She reportedly proposed instead that she retain primary custody of the child and even requested for the NBA All-Star to pay child support.

According to the report, the basketball shooting guard — who goes by the nickname \"Antman\" — and Carlyle share a daughter together, Aris Ariel Carlyle, who was born last year.",
