    "text": "Donald Trump tried Thursday to explain away his apparent staycation amid a tightening presidential race, but unfortunately for the former president, his numbers just didn’t add up.\nEver since Trump’s rally in Atlanta this past weekend, the former president has been lying low at home. Meanwhile, his running mate, J.D. Vance, has seemingly been sent to follow Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz across the country, to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.\nDuring a press conference from the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday, Trump was asked about his apparent pause in public appearances. He didn’t take it well.\n“You have not had a public campaign event for nearly a week now, tomorrow you’ll be in Montana which is not a swing state,” said one reporter. “Some have your allies have expressed concern that you’re not taking this race seriously, particularly—”\n“What a stupid question,” Trump interjected .\n“At a time where there is enthusiasm on the other side. Why haven’t you been campaigning this week?” the reporter asked.\n“Uh, because I’m leading by a lot and because I’m letting their convention go through,” Trump said, implying he had taken a step back before immediately contradicting himself. “And I am campaigning a lot.”\nTrump then claimed that he’d kept busy working on “commercials that are at a level that anybody’s ever done before.”\nThe Republican nominee also said that he’d been doing remote interviews.\n“I’m speaking to you on phones, I’m speaking to radio, I’m speaking to television. Uh, television is coming over here,” Trump said. “Excuse me, what are we doing right now?”\nEarlier this week, Trump called into Fox & Friends to push the baseless claim that Harris had picked Walz out of antisemitism against another contender, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, but he couldn’t get through it without reviving his own offensive comments about Jewish voters.\nTrump then criticized Harris for not speaking more with the press. “She’s not doing any news conferences. You know why she’s not doing [it]? She doesn’t know how to do a news conference. She’s not smart enough to do a news conference,” Trump said Thursday.\nThis claim seems to be a new line of attack for Trump and Vance, who made a comment about it Wednesday on the tarmac in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\nSomeone close to Harris’s campaign told Politico that there was little “incentive” for Harris to speak more with the press. “She’s getting out exactly the message she wants to get out,” they said.\nAs for Trump’s claim that he’s “leading by a lot,” that’s not necessarily clear.\nWhen listing recent polls that had him ahead, Trump cited a recent Rasmussen Reports survey published Thursday, which found that Trump was leading 49 percent to 44 percent. Rasmussen was recently dropped from the national poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight, after it was determined to be too right-leaning to be considered reliable.\nTrump cited a CNBC poll published Thursday, which found the former president to have a two-point lead over his opponent. He also mentioned an MSNBC poll that placed him ahead, but such a poll did not appear to exist.\nWhile Trump claimed he’d taken the lead in swing states, an Ipsos poll published Thursday found that the two candidates were neck-and-neck, with Harris taking a slight lead. On Wednesday, two key national poll aggregators found that after months of struggling, the Democratic Party’s candidate had overtaken Trump in the polls.\nTrump is well aware that he’s beginning to struggle in the polls—apparently, it’s driving him nuts .\nThe post Old Man Trump Cites Made-Up Polls to Excuse Low-Energy Campaign appeared first on New Republic .",

    "text": "TRAVERSE CITY — Some small businesses in Northern Michigan got a sales boost, thanks to the holiday season. Retailers big and small, rely heavily on sales during the holiday shopping season, and Underground Toys, located at ‘The Commons’ in Traverse City, is no different. The toy store opened its doors about a month ago right before the Christmas shopping season started. Co-owner of Underground Toys, Caitlin Bowden, said they’ve seen plenty of foot traffic during and even after the holiday sales. And with many parents off work this week, the gloomy weather and kids with extra spending money from Christmas, the holiday sales continue to thrive. “They’re just looking for something to do, especially when it’s raining out. So, this is the perfect place to come. You know, go to all the shops, go to the restaurants. So, yeah, this week has been really nice because people are still enjoying themselves, are kind of in the holiday spirit there,” said Bowden. Bowden said some advantages to shopping locally at their store is kids have the ability to look and touch the toys in a less overwhelming setting and it’s a more fun shopping experience than buying online.",

    "text": "KOTA KINABALU: Datuk Christina Liew has paid tribute to SM Muthu who passed away recently, hailing the environmental activist as a hero.\nThe Sabah Tourism, Culture and Environment Minister said Muthu may have ruffled many feathers including those in power with his outspokenness on environmental issues but the latter stuck to his convictions in order to champion causes he believed in.\n“We welcome these kind of heroes,” she said after an event here on Thursday (July 4).\n“I call them (Muthu’s efforts) heroic acts because he doesn't care whether it pleases people, including some leaders, or not. But whatever he raised, the points are good and it's taken.\n“Why? Because only through his voices and his thoughts that we know which part is our weakness and we need to improve on them,” Liew added.\nThe Minister said this when asked to share her thoughts on Muthu who died after a two-year battle with cancer on Sunday (June 30). He was 75.\nMuthu, from Teluk Intan in Perak, came to Sabah as a young teacher in the early 1970s.\nHe passed away at his home in Kingfisher Park here at 5pm on Sunday, leaving behind his wife Mary Lau Mee Yin and children Dr Anand Nainar and Michele Nainar.\nDuring his life, Muthu was uncompromising on his stand over issues affecting Sabah and was even questioned by police and sued for bankruptcy for his convictions but yet refused to back down.\nHis unyielding stand on environmental issues including coal plants for power generation, developments at Tanjung Beach and Likas Bay here, as well as indigenous and social rights, gained him the nickname \"Green Man\".\nLiew said Muthu was not only a good environmental activist and visionary, but more importantly a good man, hoping there will be others who will follow in his footsteps.\n“I feel very saddened by his passing. And I pray that his good work will not be forgotten.\n“We will continue some of the things that he raised, we will start working on that,” she said.\nOpen Modal × $(document).ready(function(){ var freeBoxShow = false; $(window).scroll(function() { var scrollPercent = 100 * $(window).scrollTop() / ($(document).height() - $(window).height()); window.setTimeout(function () { //scroll to page length 35% then show the pop-up if (scrollPercent >= 35 && !freeBoxShow) { freeBoxShow = true; $('#freeHTMLBoxBtn').click(); } }, 500); }); var freeModal = document.getElementById(\"freeModal\"); $(\"#freeHTMLBoxBtn\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"block\"; //$('body').addClass('free-modal-open'); }); $(\".free-close\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"none\"; //$('body').removeClass('free-modal-open'); }); var freeBox = '",

Hier soir, lorsque le soleil s’est couché, de nombreuses aurores boréales ont pu être observées dans la région de Nice ( Alpes-Maritimes ).\nUn spectacle incroyable capturé aux quatre coins du département. Voici vos magnifiques images.\nÀ lire aussi\nPHOTOS. Aurores boréales près de Nice : « Je n’imaginais pas pouvoir en voir un jour ici »\nDéjà visibles en mai dernier sur la Côte d’Azur Ce n’est pas la première fois qu’un tel phénomène se déroule dans le ciel azuréen cette année. Déjà en mai dernier, une tempête solaire avait provoqué des dizaines d’aurores boréales au-dessus de nos têtes durant deux nuits de suite. Un spectacle déjà rarissime. Mais une fois n’est pas coutume, elles étaient de retour dans la soirée de ce jeudi 10 octobre 2024.\nElles étaient même visibles en plein centre-ville de Nice, dans le quartier du Parc impérial sur les collines. « J’ai pu, de façon improbable , les capturer », écrit Kate Jacqueline Suarez. Les photos sont tout juste somptueuses.\n« Pour la deuxième fois en 2024, nous avons vécu une nuit absolument unique . Hier soir, dès que le ciel s’est assombri, les aurores se sont mises à danser dans le ciel des Alpes-Maritimes », raconte Christophe Suarez, photographe environnement et météo.\nVidéos : en ce moment sur Actu À lire aussi\nNice. Après l’orage, un magnifique double arc-en-ciel : les images sont splendides\nDes aurores d’une intensité rare Dans l’arrière-pays, notamment à Tende dans la Roya, le phénomène a également extasié les habitants. C’est là que les premières aurores boréales sont apparues. De nombreuses photos ont été postées sur les réseaux sociaux. Tout le département a pu profiter de cette époustouflante vision. Entre le rose et le violet , les couleurs ont parfois viré à l’orange et au rouge.\nCliquez ici pour visualiser le contenu Cliquez ici pour visualiser le contenu Le phénomène a été constaté un peu partout en France. Il est dû à une grosse tempête solaire survenue le 9 octobre dernier. Les météorologues avaient prévenu, la chance de pouvoir en observer était importante.\n« Tous les voyants sont au vert pour de belles aurores », avait alerté Eric Lagadec, astrophysicien. Toutefois, une telle intensité reste très rare puisque l’activité était maximale en début de soirée. De tels phénomènes ne s’étaient pas déroulés depuis 2005.\nSuivez toute l’actualité de vos villes et médias favoris en vous inscrivant à Mon Actu .\n#Météo France",

    "text": "Whether you’ve got antsy kids at home or in the classroom, a good board game can keep the little ones entertained for hours — not to mention help strengthen their critical-thinking skills. So while we’ve written before about all sorts of games and activities in the past — including the best four-player board games , two-player board games , and board games for adults — here, we’ve rounded up the 21 best board games for kids.\nBest strategy board game for kids\nTicket to Ride $55 now 20% off $44 Ticket to Ride is an adventure-style game in which players attempt to cross the country and connect cities by building train routes. Suitable for ages 8 and up, it is easy to pick up “but also offers a level of strategy and tactics just deep enough for competitive gamers to return to time and again,” says Ian Ross, who runs the popular Instagram page Board Games As Art .\n$44 at Amazon Buy Best pick-and-pass-style card game for kids\nSushi Go! $12 For a lightning-quick, pick-and-pass-style card game, Lauren Bilanko, a co-owner of Twenty Sided Store , suggests Sushi Go! , which she says is very easy to learn but still fun enough to play over and over again. The gameplay is simple: collect cards to create collections of dishes for different point values, and whoever scores the most points wins.\n$12 at Amazon Buy Best farming-style board game for kids\nTakenoko $47 Illustrator Stephen Walsh told us about this “really sweet” game about competitive panda husbandry that’s a favorite of his kids. It asks players to cultivate land plots and grow three species of bamboo for pandas. Walsh describes it as the “perfect Christmas Day game” to break out when you want something family-friendly and cheerful. The game takes about 45 minutes to play and is suitable for ages 8 and up.\n$47 at Amazon Buy $42 at Walmart Buy Best building-focused board game for kids\nMouse Trap Board Game $25 Most ’90s kids will remember this classic, which is suitable for children ages 4 and up and can accommodate two to four players. “Nothing could beat being a kid and unboxing this game to build a wacky Rube Goldberg machine,” says board-game designer Rob Sparks .\n$25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy Best family-friendly word-association board game\nJust One $25 In our roundup of the best board games to break out during parties, five of our experts praised Just One . “Hands down, Just One is our favorite new party game,” says Kelsey Demers, who runs the board-game blog the Tabletop Family . “It’s simple to play, a breeze to teach, and utterly addictive.” The game won the prestigious 2019 Spiel des Jahres, or German Game of the Year, which evaluates board games based on their game concept, rule structure, layout, and design. The main objective, as the title suggests, is for players to help their teammates guess a word by suggesting “just one” word as a hint. Which sounds easy enough, but, as Matthews warns, “Watch out, duplicate words cancel each other out,” so you need to be creative. A right answer scores your team one point, while a wrong answer docks two points, with the ultimate goal being to get as many points out of 13 as possible. This game takes about 20 minutes to play and is suitable for up to seven players.\n$25 at Amazon Buy Best storytelling board game for kids\nDixit $40 now 15% off $34 Walsh describes Dixit as “a great icebreaker of a game, fantastic for getting everyone interacting.” Great for kids with strong imaginations, it begins with one player being designated the storyteller; that player makes up a sentence based on the image on one of the cards in their hand. Then each player selects the card in their hand that best matches the sentence and gives it to the storyteller. The storyteller shuffles the cards and presents them to the other players, who place bets on which is the original card with the winners gaining points for correct guesses. As an added bonus, “the card artwork is beautiful, imaginative, and sometimes a little surreal,” Walsh says.\n$34 at Amazon Buy Best bingo-style board game for kids\nThinkFun Zingo! $20 $20 Recommended by longtime Manhattan nanny Kasia Dabrowska, this bingo-esque game is easy to teach kids because the name of the game is speed-spotting familiar items like a dog, bird, or baseball bat.

But, Ro says, “it’s actually pretty challenging, even for adults” because, depending on what you spin, you either advance or go on a scavenger hunt to collect different objects on the highly detailed, six-foot board. “Augie relishes the challenge and gets really excited each time he plays,” she adds.\n$25 at Macy's Buy Best travel-size board game for kids\nSpot It!

    "text": "( MENAFN - UkrinForm) Germany and Ireland have confirmed their intention to continue supporting Ukraine in countering Russian aggression and on its path to EU membership.\nThis was stated by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock during a press conference with her Irish colleague Micheál Martin, a Ukrinform correspondent reported.\n\"Putin deliberately continues his heinous missile terror against people in Ukraine for almost two years now. That is why it is important for us to intensively support Ukraine in its right to self-defense,\" she said.\nBaerbock thanked Ireland, which has taken over 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, 2% of the country's population. This, she said, clearly emphasizes Europe's solidarity with Ukraine, and Ireland plays a particularly important role in this process.\nRead also: Ambassador: Germany transfers new air defense systems to Ukraine this year \"Our support will continue for as long as people in Ukraine need it,\" she emphasized.\nIn his turn, Martin noted that both countries agree that the EU should continue to stand by Ukraine and support it on its path to liberation. He thanked Germany for taking the lead in supporting Ukraine in Europe.\nThe ministers also supported Ukraine's plans for EU enlargement, noting that this should go hand in hand with domestic reforms. In this context, Germany and Ireland fully support Ukraine on its path to the EU.\nMENAFN19012024000193011044ID1107741314\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "As a cold front makes its way through San Antonio on Thursday night, a number of resources are available to make sure the most vulnerable remain safe — and in case a backup plan is needed.\nStrong, gusty winds will move across South Central Texas through Friday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. The coldest air of the season arrives in the area Sunday morning, the NWS said, putting highs in the 30s and lows in the teens and 20s.\nAnd the day will only warm up about two to three degrees Sunday, said Emily Heller, meteorologist for the National Weather Service San Antonio-area.\nThat’ll just be the start of it of the cold snap: Breezy winds will continue Monday and Tuesday, dropping temperatures to the low 20s, possibly into the upper teens, and even colder wind chills at 10 to 13 degrees on Monday morning. The coldest wind chill, in the single digits, is expected in the San Antonio area Tuesday morning.\nThe area will start warming up Wednesday morning, Heller said, with lows ranging from the 20s to the low 50s in the afternoon.\nFor San Antonians living or commuting in the north and east sides, periods of light, freezing drizzle or freezing rain are possible. “Very light ice” on the roads is possible, Heller said, but nothing extreme.\nAcross the rest of the city, gusty winds bring serious high fire danger. Heller said outdoor burning isn’t recommended and that safety while driving will be important.\nWhere to take shelter from the cold\nWarming and resiliency centers provided by the city and county are available overnight to locals who need a warm place indoors.\nOn Sunday night, the city will open six overnight resilience hubs, which are facilities where local residents have access to basic needs and supplies and have shelter from the severe cold. People going to the resiliency centers should bring clothes, supplies, and medicine.\nPets are welcome, the city said, and kennels will be available in a separate area on site.\nThe following resiliency centers will open all day and overnight, starting Sunday at 9 p.m. through Wednesday at 8 a.m.\n- Normoyle Senior Center, 700 Culberson Ave.\n- Northeast Senior Center, Thousand Oaks Drive.\n- Southside Lions Senior Center, 3303 Pecan Valley Drive.\n- Garza Community Center, 1450 Mira Vista.\n- Copernicus Community Center, 5003 Lord Rd.\n- Miller’s Pond Community Center, 6175 Old Pearsall Rd.\nBexar County also will open five overnight warming centers beginning Sunday at 9 p.m. through Wednesday at 8 a.m.\n- Lighthouse Church Temple, 8201 Old Pearsall Rd.\n- OuterWest Community Church, 12280 Alamo Ranch Pkwy.\n- St. Padre Pio Catholic Church, 3843 Bulverde Pkwy.\n- Christ the King Lutheran Church, 1129 Pat Booker Rd. in Universal City.\n- Elmendorf Community Library, 203 Bexar Ave. in Elmendorf.\nOn Monday, the city will open 14 daytime warming centers from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Residents may bring clothes, supplies and medicine. VIA Metropolitan Transit will offer passengers fare-free travel to or from the following locations:\n- Central Library, 600 Soledad St.\n- Schaefer Library, 6322 U.S. Highway 87 East.\n- Mission Library, 3134 Roosevelt Ave.\n- Cortez Library, 2803 Hunter Blvd.\n- Bazan Library, 2200 W. Commerce St.\n- Guerra Library, 978 W. Military Drive.\n- Maverick Library, 8700 Mystic Park.\n- Igo Library, 13330 Kyle Seale Pkwy.\n- Encino Library, 2515 E. Evans Rd.\n- Thousand Oaks Library, 4618 Thousand Oaks.\n- Tobin Community Center, 1900 W. Martin St.\n- Harlandale Community Center, 7227 Briar Pl.\n- Cuellar Community Center, 5626 San Fernando St.\n- Hamilton Community Center, 0700 Nacogdoches Rd.\nFor people experiencing homelessness, the city is helping local nonprofits expand capacity at overnight shelters, including Haven for Hope, the Salvation Army, Communities Under the Bridge, Corazon San Antonio, and Sold Out Believers Church.\nOther local nonprofits are going to homeless encampment areas in the city to alert people of the cold weather, offering transportation to those who decide to go to a shelter.\nSafety tips\nTo ensure safety inside your home, make sure your carbon monoxide alarms are working and keep space heaters or other heating equipment 3 feet away from anything that can burn. Don’t use a generator indoors or an oven to heat your home, and avoid using power strips.\nTo prevent pipes from freezing, leave one faucet on to keep water moving. Know where your meter cutoff valve is\nin case you have to turn it off and turn off irrigation systems at the shut-off valve.\nThe weather is also a danger to pets, so shelter them inside your home. If a pet cannot come indoors, put a sweater on them and feed them extra food to stay warm. Before leaving your home, check under your vehicle’s hood near the engine for cats or other animals that are trying to stay warm.\nIf you need any help, get in touch with the city’s customer service line for services or resources by dialing 3-1-1. Calls are being taken Monday through Sunday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and until 11 p.m. for urgent requests. On Monday, customer service will operate from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and until 11 p.m. for urgent requests.",

    "text": "NEW DELHI: India and the US have decided to reactivate the Indian Ocean Observing System (IndOOS), a network of 36 moored buoys in the high seas to collect high-resolution ocean and atmospheric data for weather forecasts. The IndOOS array of buoys fell into neglect and disrepair during the years of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to gaps in observational data considered crucial by weather forecasters, particularly since the links between the Indian Ocean Dipole phenomenon and monsoon were established. The reactivation of IndOOS was discussed last month during a meeting of Earth Sciences Secretary M Ravichandran with Rick Spinrad, Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the US. The moored buoys are part of the Research Moored Array for African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction (RAMA) programme that was born out of a collaboration between the Ministry of Earth Sciences and NOAA in 2008. “We want to reactivate RAMA. I discussed it with the NOAA chief during my visit to Washington in March,” Ravichandran said. NOAA has agreed to provide instrumentation and India will give ship-time from July for restarting the RAMA array, he said, adding that about 60-90 days of ship-time will be required for the purpose. In an article published in the Bulletin of American Meteorological Society (BAMS), weather forecasters from several countries wrote that the pandemic disrupted the deployment and maintenance cruises for the observational array and also resulted in supply chain issues for procurement and refurbishment of equipment.",

    "text": "St. Augustine said, “The confession of evil works is the first beginning of good works.” Pretending to be perfect is exhausting, but when we understand we’re all sinners in need of a Savior, that’s when true life-change begins. As believers, our goal should be to live with integrity, understanding that it’s not about perfect actions, but a perfect heart—one that remains set on God. Proverbs 10:9 (ESV) says, “Whoever walks in integrity walks securely…” We see this in the life of King David. God called David a man after His own heart, but he was far from perfect. His life proves four realities about integrity. First, it shows that integrity begins when we root ourselves in God’s truth. David was born into an underprivileged family, but he became the King of Israel, taking it from the most oppressed nation to the most blessed nation of the region. How did he do this? And why did God choose him? Because David valued God’s wisdom. In Psalm 25:5 he wrote: “Guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my Savior, and my hope is in you all day long.” When we also root ourselves in God’s truth, we will begin walking in integrity. Then, David’s life proved that integrity continues as we rely on God’s trustworthiness. At one point, David grew so discouraged by his trouble that he made a series of terrible decisions. He had an affair with Bathsheba, his military leader’s wife, and then had him killed. David knew he was wrong, and he repented. God, true to His nature, was merciful. While David still had to face the consequences of his actions because he relied on God’s trustworthiness, he was able to continue on the path of integrity. (2 Samuel 11-12) It’s the same for us. When we fail, we must trust in the mercy of our Savior, and allow Him to lead us back to His path. Next, David’s life shows that integrity remains tenacious in trials. David’s consequence for his sin was the life of the son Bathsheba conceived in the affair. David fasted and prayed for their son to live, but he died. After God made His answer clear, David was heartbroken, but he didn’t pout or blame God. Instead, he worshipped. He focused on the goodness of God. (2 Samuel 12:20) Throughout our lives, we too will face trial, whether it’s because of our actions, or simply because we live in a fallen world. When we do, we also must prove tenacious, fixing our focus on God’s goodness. The last thing David’s life shows us is that integrity always resolves to try again. David grew from his mistakes, and 2 Samuel 12:24-25 tells us God granted David and Bathsheba another son who later became the wisest king to ever live. Friends, integrity leads to security, every time. We won’t be perfect, but if we’ll continually set our heart on God, we will walk in His blessing!",
