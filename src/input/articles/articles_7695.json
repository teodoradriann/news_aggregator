    "title": "Better ocean connectivity boosts reef fish po | EurekAlert!",
    "text": "Research led by the University of Oxford has found that oceanographic connectivity (the movement and exchange of water between different parts of the ocean) is a key influence for fish abundance across the Western Indian Ocean (WIO). The findings have been published today in the ICES Journal of Marine Sciences. Connectivity particularly impacted herbivorous reef fish groups, which are most critical to coral reef resilience, providing evidence that decision-makers should incorporate connectivity into how they prioritise conservation areas. The study also revealed that, alongside oceanographic connectivity, sea surface temperature and levels of chlorophyll (the green pigment in plants that drives photosynthesis) strongly predict reef fish distribution and abundance in the WIO. Protecting reefs is essential in this area, particularly for rapidly growing local communities, which are highly dependent on reefs and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Lead author Laura Warmuth (Department of Biology, University of Oxford) said: “It was striking that herbivorous fish – which are critical to reef resilience – were particularly strongly impacted by ocean connectivity. Efficient conservation area prioritisation should include connectivity for decision making regarding marine protected area management across country borders. This is particularly relevant in the human-pressured WIO region, where annual bleaching is predicted on most coral reefs by mid-century, even under optimistic climate change scenarios.” Coastal communities are highly dependent on reefs for food security, with small-scale fisheries providing up to 99% of protein intake and around 82% of household income in the WIO. Home to some of the world’s poorest communities and seeing rapid population growth, locals are at an ever-increasing risk of climate change, which has the potential to devastate reefs with successive coral bleaching. While sea surface temperatures are rising around the world, temperatures in the Indian Ocean are increasing faster than other tropical oceans – and it is one of the most vulnerable ocean regions to thermal stress. Fish diversity is central to reef resilience, providing several key services to reefs by their different feeding patterns such as feeding on algae which can compete with corals. The researchers developed a metric of proportional oceanographic connectivity to simplify complex oceanographic models, allowing them to incorporate this element into ecological models. Typically, across the study reef sites, medium connectivity levels were associated with higher fish abundances, rather than high levels. High connectivity may help with larvae dispersal but can come with side effects, such as stronger wave exposure or increased dispersal of pollutants or invasive species. The study revealed that sea surface temperatures and chlorophyll levels also had a strong influence on the abundance of fish species at all levels of the food chain. Senior author Professor Mike Bonsall (Department of Biology, University of Oxford) added: “It is really imperative that decision-makers responsible for marine planning understand how ocean patterns and environmental factors affect reef fish across the food chain. Our work emphasizes how crucial this link is between ocean currents and fish ecology for understanding the broader impact of environmental change and fishing regulations on sensitive coral reef fish systems.” The researchers now plan to explore the impacts of human activities, including how human population density and market distance affect reef fish abundance and biomass in the WIO. They will also investigate how environmental and oceanographic factors are predicted to change for different climate change scenarios, and how fish abundances and distributions will change with them. The study was a collaboration between the University of Oxford, the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, UK, the Coastal Oceans Research and Development in the Indian Ocean (CORDIO) NGO in Mombasa, Kenya, the Institute of Zoology in London, UK, and the Bertarelli Foundation Marine Science Programme.

    "title": "Integrated Biosciences discovers new antibiotics effective at killing MRSA and other germs using AI drug discovery software - NotebookCheck.net News",
    "text": "Integrated Biosciences has discovered a new class of antibiotics that are effective at killing antibiotic-resistant MRSA and other germs. The company utilized AI deep learning trained on key parts of current antibiotics that kill to achieve this. This discovery helps counter the growing problem of drug-resistant bacteria. Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus is one example of a bacteria that has become ever more drug-resistant. Current antibiotics are losing their effectiveness as deaths increase yearly. Thousands die from MRSA infections, and the death rate after infection, even among non-symptomatic carriers, is much higher than normal. Traditional methods of antibiotic drug discovery can easily exceed a $1 billion and take decades. Integrated Biosciences had their AI search for viable antibiotics through a set of 12 million candidates using just software rather than lab work. The AI was trained to know what aspects of a molecule leads to high antibiotic activity and importantly toxicity. This bypassed the tedious work needed to isolate, then test candidates one-by-one in the lab. Although discovering a new class of antibiotics quickly is astonishing given the recent paucity in this field, new drugs must still be carefully tested in animal and human studies, so these are still years from reaching the market. Sports atheletes and children are vunerable to infections due to the nature of their play, but even sharing contaminated razors can spread MRSA. In the meantime, you can kill antibiotic-resistant MRSA and other germs on surfaces and toys at home using an EPA registered disinfectant ( such as this at Amazon ).

These antibiotics specifically and potently kill MRSA and other bacterial pathogens. (Photo: Business Wire) December 20, 2023 11:00 AM Eastern Standard Time SAN CARLOS, Calif.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Integrated Biosciences, a biotechnology company pioneering the use of synthetic biology and machine learning to develop next-generation therapeutics for age-related diseases, today announced the publication in the journal Nature of a peer-reviewed manuscript detailing the application of its platform in the discovery of a new class of small molecule antibiotics capable of addressing antibiotic resistance. This discovery represents one of the first new classes of antibiotics in the past 60 years and is the first discovered leveraging an AI-powered platform built around explainable deep learning. The paper, entitled “Discovery of a structural class of antibiotics with explainable deep learning,” was co-authored by a team of 21 researchers, led by Felix Wong, Ph.D., co-founder of Integrated Biosciences, and James J. Collins, Ph.D., Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science at MIT and founding chair of the Integrated Biosciences Scientific Advisory Board. Additional collaborators included researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, and the Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research in Dresden, Germany. In their study, the researchers virtually screened more than 12 million candidate compounds to identify this new class of antibiotics. “This discovery of a new class of antibiotics is a breakthrough result showing that artificial intelligence and explainable deep learning are uniquely capable of catalyzing drug discovery,” said Dr. Wong. “Our work makes publicly available several high-powered models to accurately predict both antibiotic activity and toxicity. Importantly, this is one of the first demonstrations that deep learning models can explain what they are predicting, with immediate and far-reaching implications to how drug discovery is done and how efficiently we can find new drugs using AI.” Satotaka Omori, Ph.D., founding member and Head of Aging Biology at Integrated Biosciences, and a contributing author on the publication, said, “An important implication of this study is that deep learning models in drug discovery can, and in many cases should, be made explainable. While AI continues to make an impact, it is also limited by the many black box models that are commonly used and obfuscate the underlying decision-making process. By opening up these black boxes, we aim to create more generalizable insights that may be more useful in accelerating the use and development of next-generation approaches to drug discovery.” In this groundbreaking approach, the team of researchers trained deep learning models on experimentally generated data to predict the antibiotic activity and toxicity of any compound. Drawing inspiration from AI used in other contexts, including DeepMind’s AlphaGo gaming technology, the authors designed new models to explain which parts of a molecule were important for antibiotic activity. The result was a new class of antibiotics with potent activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens. In one series of experiments, the researchers tested a candidate antibiotic in mouse models of MRSA infection and found that it was efficacious both topically and systemically, indicating that the compound could be suitable for further development as a treatment for severe and sepsis-related bacterial infections. “This is an important validation of how important the integration of AI and explainable deep learning will be to overcoming some of the most vexing challenges in medicine, in this case antibiotic resistance,” said Dr. Collins. “Building on these validating studies and similar approaches, the Integrated Biosciences team is poised to further accelerate their integration of synthetic biology and a deep understanding of cellular stress to address a significant unmet need for new treatments targeting age-related diseases.” “In any given class of drugs, there are often persistent issues that have limited clinical development. A key innovation in this study was that we could look to explainable deep learning to help us address specific issues, such as resistance and toxicity, and find solutions quickly,” said Dr. Wong. Alicia Li, a research associate at Integrated Biosciences and a contributing author on the publication, added, “It’s really exciting to see how we’ve been able to demonstrate a new way to predict how useful a compound will be as an antibiotic, the likelihood that the compound will progress in Phase I trials, and whether or not the compound is one of potentially many other members in a novel class of drugs.” Integrated Biosciences has built a body of research that, in addition to this new Nature publication, includes a Nature Aging paper published in May demonstrating how AI can be used to discover novel senolytics, anti-aging compounds that selectively eliminate senescent “zombie” cells. These compounds have shown promise in their ability to treat age-related diseases, such as fibrosis, inflammation, and cancer. A Cell Systems paper published in July demonstrated a synthetic biology-based platform allowing human control over aging-associated stress responses, enabling accelerated drug screens for targeting aging.

    "title": "No need to capture PoK by force; its people will themselves want to join India, says Rajnath Singh, rajnath singh, PoK, Jammu and Kashmir, AFSPA",
    "text": "Defence Minister Rajnath Singh during an interview with PTI, in New Delhi. l Photo: PTI New Delhi: India will never give up its claim on Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir (PoK) but it won't have to capture it with force because its people, on their own, would want to be part of India after seeing the development in Kashmir, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has said. In an exclusive interview to PTI, Singh asserted that the ground situation has improved significantly in Jammu and Kashmir and that a time will come when AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) will no longer be required in the Union Territory. The defence minister, however, said the matter is under the domain of the Union Home Ministry and it will take appropriate decisions. He said elections will also be held there definitely, but wouldn't give a timeline. \"I think India will not have to do anything. The way the ground situation has changed in Jammu and Kashmir, the way the region is witnessing economic progress and the way peace has returned there, I think demands will emerge from people of PoK that they should merge with India,\" he said. \"We will not have to use force to take PoK as people would say that we must be merged with India. Such demands are now coming,\" he said. The defence minister asserted that \"PoK was, is, and will remain ours\". Citing improvement in the ground situation in Jammu and Kashmir, Singh said assembly elections will be held there soon, but did not give a timeline. \"The way the situation is improving in Jammu and Kashmir, I think a time will come when AFSPA will no longer be required there. It is my view and it is for the Home Ministry to decide on it,\" he said. The AFSPA empowers security forces to conduct operations and arrest anyone without any prior warrant. It also gives immunity to the forces if they shoot someone dead. The defence minister, referring to Pakistan's proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir, said Islamabad must stop cross border terrorism. \"They are trying to destabilise India and we will not allow it to happen,\" he said. The ties between India and Pakistan came under severe strain after India's warplanes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot in Pakistan in February 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack. The relations further deteriorated after India on August 5, 2019 announced the withdrawal of special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and the bifurcation of the state into two union territories. India has been maintaining that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan while insisting that the onus is on Islamabad to create an environment free of terror and hostility for such an engagement.

    "text": "How some groups are using indigenous science to restore ecosystems In 2015, the Soda Fire burned 280,000 acres of mostly sage grouse habitat in southwest Idaho. Immediately after the wildfire was out, officials went to work trying to restore the landscape using thousands of pounds of seeds, herbicides and millions of dollars to keep out invasive plants and provide food and shelter to sage grouses, pygmy rabbits, golden eagles and the other animals that live there. But many scientists are finding that some landscapes can come back on their own or with much less invasive help from people, and there are more and more examples of this kind of restoration popping up around the West. Journalist Josephine Woolington did some digging into the idea of native restoration. She wrote the March feature story for [High Country News](https://www.hcn.org) about [native plant species and restoring landscapes](https://www.hcn.org/issues/56-3/underground-seed-banks-hold-promise-for-ecological-restoration/), and she joined Idaho Matters to talk more.",

O estudo desta criação foi publicado na revista Nature.\nEste avanço é especialmente relevante para milhões de diabéticos que dependem de insulina, uma vez que episódios de baixa glicemia podem ser perigosos, causando convulsões e perda de consciência.\nO projeto de uma insulina responsiva à glicose era uma meta antiga dos pesquisadores, mas somente agora a Novo Nordisk conseguiu implementar um “interruptor liga/desliga” na molécula da insulina.\nLeia mais:\nBrasileiros criam técnica que pode revolucionar diagnóstico da DiabetesInfecção bacteriana pode ser um gatilho para diabetesSua voz pode indicar sinais de diabetes – entenda\nQuando os níveis de glicose estão altos, o interruptor ativa a insulina, facilitando a absorção do excesso de glicose. Por outro lado, em níveis baixos, o interruptor desativa a insulina, prevenindo quedas perigosas de glicose.\nInsulina modificada foi eficaz na proteção contra hipoglicemia\n- Testes laboratoriais mostraram que a insulina modificada, chamada NNC2215, apresentou uma afinidade 3,2 vezes maior para se ligar aos receptores de insulina conforme os níveis de glicose variavam.\n- Em testes com ratos e porcos, a NNC2215 foi tão eficaz quanto a insulina humana, mas com maior proteção contra hipoglicemia.\n- Este desenvolvimento é promissor, especialmente para diabéticos que enfrentam um medo intenso de episódios de hipoglicemia.\n- A insulina responsiva pode permitir um controle mais rigoroso dos níveis de glicose sem o risco elevado de baixas perigosas.\nOs pesquisadores acreditam que essa tecnologia pode melhorar significativamente o tratamento do diabetes, permitindo uma titulação mais segura da insulina e potencialmente reduzindo complicações associadas à doença.",

    "text": "'I wished it had been me': Husband weeps after wife falls 70 feet off New York cliff Police in New York are investigating the death of a 39-year-old Singapore woman who reportedly fell 70 feet after losing her footing while taking photos at the edge of a cliff. Meanwhile her husband says he wishes he had been the one to fall instead of her. Nur Aisyah Binte MD Akbar and her husband were on vacation from Singapore and hiking along Beacon Hill Trail in [Minnewaska State Park](https://parks.ny.gov/parks/minnewaska/details.aspx) (about 100 miles north of New York City) on Dec. 22 and had stopped to take photos at the edge of a cliff, [New York State Police said](https://troopers.ny.gov/news/new-york-state-police-respond-reports-injured-hiker-minnewaska-state-park-town-rochester). Police said Akbar lost her footing and fell approximately 70 feet off the cliff. Her husband, 41-year-old Abdul Rauf Bin Mohd Said, called 911. State police troopers responded, and Akbar was hoisted out by a helicopter. She was taken to a local hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries, police said, adding that the incident remains under investigation.

The [accident occurred as the couple](https://www.facebook.com/rauf.said/posts/pfbid027nSBJnaWM2UWPtVSfvf3fsYyEWKar6zXkDMZRYHroB7Q9s8ETVUC6WzCpKsN3xB5l) \"found a nice part of the park to sit down, take pictures, and discuss our next goals,\" said Said, adding that the temperature was almost 32 degrees and there was ice present over the ground and rocks, making them very slippery. As Said was recording a video of his wife talking about the park's beauty, she slipped and fell down the cliff. \"Right after Ais fell off the cliff, I rushed forward, slipped, but didn't fall off the cliff. (Believe me, I wished it had been me),\" wrote Said on Facebook. \"I screamed for help at the top of my lungs, and three sisters, who heard my cries, rushed over to my spot with their father and aunt.\" Said said that the sisters hiked down to where Akbar had fallen and told him that she was still breathing so they gave her their coats to keep her warm until rescuers and medics arrived. \"The sisters said Ais told them her name, that she had two dogs, and that she really wanted to drink sweet tea,\" he wrote. \"One of the rangers that was with her told me the same thing. And she was repeatedly saying thank you to them ... Even during the most eventful moments, she was still thinking of making sure the people around her are appreciated.\" Said shared a shaky video that partially shows his wife being helped by the sisters. \"Thank you! Is she still alive!?\" he shouts, followed by crying. A woman responds, \"Yeah, she is.\" In another video shared by Said, he talks to the three sisters who shared more about how his wife was doing when they got to her. \"She wasn't in any pain for the first while,\" one of the sisters says. \"She couldn't feel much. But then right at the end she started to feel a little pain in her hips. She would say that her hands were cold but the rest of her was warm. So we were holding her hand and putting our hands on her hands.\" Said weeps: \"I should have been down there.\" Wife wasn't breathing at the time of evacuation When his wife was being evacuated about three hours after the fall, Said said that paramedics told him she wasn't breathing anymore. \"I broke down,\" he wrote. \"We rushed to the nearest hospital, where it was confirmed that she didn't survive and had passed away.\" Said said that the rescue operation took about three hours because authorities needed to cut down trees to be able to evacuate using a helicopter. Furthermore, the rocks were slippery and the terrain difficult. Said said that he himself attempted to go down to where Akbar had fallen but kept slipping, even injuring his right wrist in the process. Akbar's body was repatriated to Singapore after the necessary legalities were completed and arrived there on Wednesday morning, [Said said](https://www.facebook.com/rauf.said/posts/pfbid022KwhwTMdw2YaH36zNQ3pRU6nRtGNSXqzXzooSccSL8985HKhgDb2noo6Qn795zuKl). The funeral and final rites will take place at the couple's home in Singapore. \"I wished I was there, physically by your side at your final moments, but it was not meant to be,\" Said wrote at the bottom of the Facebook post in a message to his wife. \"I am sorry that I was not there. I hope you forgive me and wait for me. Everyone misses you and loves you.\" Mike Randall covers breaking news for the Times Herald-Record and the Poughkeepsie Journal.
