    "text": "Taylor Swift fans from around the world, who had swarmed to Vienna with friendship bracelets on their wrists and the pop star’s lyrics etched in their minds, were left heartbroken after an averted attack derailed their plans and cast her world tour’s future into uncertainty. “The happiest that we had ever seen her was when we told her last year that we got the tickets,” Hovington said. “And the saddest we have ever seen her was when we told her last night that the shows were canceled.” thank you lovely church in— kristi hovington (@kristihov) [#vienna]that played Taylor swift songs the day of the first cancelled concert and gave lots of sad swifties a place to gather. Thanks to the police for keeping us all safe! [#ViennaTStheErasTour] [pic.twitter.com/p9eZeIJaeT] [August 8, 2024] The Eras Tour — the highest-grossing concert tour in history — is scheduled to resume Aug. 15 with the first of five shows in London’s Wembley Stadium. The canceled shows in Vienna mark the biggest disruption to the tour since November, when a show in Rio de Janeiro was postponed following extremely hot temperatures that led to a fan’s death. The threat in Vienna came to light days after a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed yoga and dance class in the town of Southport in North West England, and coincides with a wave of terrorist threats against large events in Europe as well as mass shootings in the United States and other countries. Emily Best, a 40-year-old Swift fan from Brussels who had snagged tickets to all three Vienna shows, found herself wondering how she would explain what had happened to her 7-year-old son at home. “I think I would tell him that there are bad people who want to ruin things,” she said, and added: “They can’t see the beauty and joy of what the Eras Tour represents. It’s sickening.” Swift herself has admitted to having a fear of an attack at one of her shows. “I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months,” she told Elle Magazine in 2019, following the Manchester Arena attack and the Vegas concert shooting two years prior. “There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe.” Many Americans planned vacations to see Swift perform overseas, where the flight, hotel and ticket can cost less than admittance to once of her U.S. shows. [Skip to end of carousel](#end-react-aria-:R2frqdl76:) click here . Autumn Allen of Columbus, Ind., said she and a friend had bought some tickets to attend multiple shows at Wembley Stadium this month. But now they have decided to give the tickets to fans who couldn’t see the show in Vienna. Allen, who runs a Swift-related Facebook page, said news of the terrorist plot sent many into an “emotional spiral.” But she noted that fans stranded in Vienna didn’t stay despondent for long. A swath of videos and pictures posted to social media show Swifties singing in the city. Fans in Vienna gathered on Corneliusgasse, a small street close to Happel Stadium, to celebrate the 14-time Grammy winner. The street’s name echoes a song on Swift’s 2019 “Lover” album, “Cornelia Street.” “Our friends that were supposed to be attending a concert are dancing in the streets of Vienna; they are creating their art on sidewalks with chalk … and trading friendship bracelets,” she said. “Our friends in Vienna seem hopeful and unafraid.” As Hovington and her daughter walked through Vienna on Thursday, they discovered Esme’s birthday plans were not entirely ruined. On their way from the Austrian National Library to a shopping district, the teen heard Swift’s music being sung i n a church . They went in. “There were people in their Taylor Swift concert outfits … with their arms around each other, holding hands, taking pictures, taking videos,” Hovington said. “We sat through a couple of songs, just everybody was singing quietly. It wasn’t like at the concert — where people are screaming and dancing — it wasn’t like that. It was more of a somber, reflective, but really kind of cathartic moment. It was really beautiful, just completely unexpected.” “It was really sad,” Esme said. “But knowing that other people felt the same way I did … made me feel better.” - Old rivals Bill O’Reilly and Jon Stewart reunite to spar on ‘The Daily Show’July 17, 2024Old rivals Bill O’Reilly and Jon Stewart reunite to spar on ‘The Daily Show’July 17, 2024 - Just nowJust now - The 26 best things to do in D.C. this weekend and next week1 hour agoThe 26 best things to do in D.C. this weekend and next week1 hour ago",

    "text": "[London Chemical Attacker Is Ex-Asylum Seeker Say Sources](https://www.gbnews.com/news/london-chemical-attacker-asylum-seeker-new-cctv-image-released) Dimitris Kouimtsidis, GB News, February 1, 2024 The man behind the horrific [chemical attack in London](https://www.gbnews.com/news/clapham-common-corrosive-substance-thrown) is an ex-asylum seeker, sources have told GB News. It is understood that Abdul Shokoor Ezedi arrived into the UK in a lorry in 2016. He failed twice in previous applications to be granted asylum in the UK, before being ultimately successful. It has also been revealed that Ezedi was convicted of a sexual offence at Newcastle Crown Court in 2018, prior to being granted asylum. Sources have told GB News, that he was handed a suspended sentence for “sexual assault/exposure” with an unpaid work order. He was then discharged from probation supervision in 2020 when the work order was completed. This comes as the Metropolitan Police released a new image of Ezedi, who is currently on the run. Ezedi allegedly attacked a woman and her two children with a corrosive substance – now known to be alkaline – in Clapham, south London. Ezedi, [believed to be from the Newcastle area](https://www.gbnews.com/news/london-chemical-attacker-newcastle-woman-police-name-suspect), is alleged to have thrown an alkaline substance at the mother and her two daughters in a “targeted” attack which saw a total of 11 people taken to hospital. Following the attack, a huge manhunt was launched which included several forces, with the manhunt still ongoing. Police originally reported that he has injuries to the right side of his face and have now released a second image of the suspect, with the injuries clearly visible. Superintendent Gabriel Cameron said: “We are now releasing an image of the last known sighting of Abdul Shokoor Ezedi, which was on Caledonian Road, N1 at 20:48hrs on Thursday, January 31. “The image is taken from the Tesco store, where Ezedi is believed to have purchased a bottle of water. He left the shop and turned right. “The image shows Ezedi with what appears to be significant injuries to the right side of his face. This makes him distinctive. “If you see Ezedi, call 999 immediately. He should NOT be approached.” Superintendent Gabriel Cameron, a senior officer who polices in Lambeth, has updated on last night’s events: “Firstly, I want to acknowledge the considerable public concern following this terrible incident, and update on the injuries suffered by the victims. “The woman, who is aged 31, and her two daughters – aged eight and three – all remain in hospital. “While none of their conditions are life-threatening, the injuries to the woman and younger girl could be life-changing. “It may be some time before hospital staff are able to say how serious that might be. “Three women – two in their 30s and one in her 50s – who were injured when they bravely came to the aid of the family, have all been discharged from hospital with minor burns injuries. “A man in his 50s who also helped declined hospital treatment for minor injuries he suffered. “Five officers who were injured as they responded have all been treated and have left hospital.”",

    "text": "Israel's Defense Systems Demonstrated in Eilat Interceptions\nMichael Doran Highlights Unity Among Israelis and Division Among Elites Over War Effort\nThe recent war effort in Israel has sparked an intriguing societal dynamic, as observed by Michael Doran, a Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute. During his ten-day visit to the country, Doran noted a remarkable unity among the Israeli populace in support of their nation’s actions. However, a stark contrast emerges within the Israeli elite, with opinions on the war effort starkly divided.\nThe Paradox of Unity and Division\nIn an interview with Sky News Australia host James Morrow, Doran described the situation as a series of paradoxes that have taken root within Israeli society. While there is robust support for the war among the general population, the elite circles have been embroiled in heated debates and divisions over the same issue. This dichotomy paints a fascinating picture of the current state of affairs in Israel.\nA Tumultuous Time for Prime Minister Netanyahu\nThese observations coincide with a challenging period for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose approval ratings are experiencing a significant decline. Current polls suggest a mere 15 percent of Israelis are in favor of Netanyahu continuing his term in office. This marked drop in support poses a severe challenge for the Prime Minister’s political survival.\nInternational Pressure and Domestic Discord\nNetanyahu’s tumbling popularity comes in the wake of escalating tension between the US and Israel. Reports indicate that President Biden’s patience with Netanyahu is wearing thin, following the Prime Minister’s rejection of the US’s requests to scale back Israel’s military offensive in Gaza and take steps towards establishing a Palestinian state post-war. This friction, coupled with growing international criticism over Netanyahu’s handling of the war, only serves to deepen the rift within Israeli society.\nAs Israel navigates this turbulent period, the dynamic between unity and division within its society, as highlighted by Doran, will continue to shape the nation’s trajectory. The implications of this societal dynamic, particularly on the political future of Netanyahu, remain to be seen.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.\n[]https://bnnbreaking.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-clarifies-adivasi-and-vanvasi-distinction-criticizes-bjp-and-pledges-indigenous-empowerment/",
