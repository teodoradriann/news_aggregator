    "title": "Liam Delap eyes 'dream' tournaments as motivation and hails 'incredible' Harry Kane - VAVEL International",
    "text": "Liam Delap may have only started his first Premier League game in August, but the Ipswich Town striker is already looking forward to international tournaments with England.\nLee Carsley will lead the U21s into the U21 European Championships in Slovakia this summer, where Delap is expected to play a significant role for the Young Lions.\nHis meteoric rise to the top is of little surprise to those who have coached him, and the 22-year-old has taken every step up in his stride on his path to the top.\nAhead of this summer's Euros, where England will look to retain their crown from 2023, Delap is eying the competition as a source of inspiration - and next year's FIFA World Cup is also on the striker's mind.\nHe said: \"It’s a motivation for any player inside this group or even outside of it. It’s an honour and a dream for anyone to play at a major tournament.\n\"We have an unbelievable team, so hopefully we can do special things in the summer at the Euros.\"\nThe Winchester-born talisman was drafted into training with the senior England team on Tuesday, alongside the likes of Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham. Unphased by the step-up, Delap shared his gratitude for the opportunity.\n\"It was an incredible experience. They’re all players I look up to, admire and carve my game upon,\" he said.\n\"They appreciate that everyone is here for a reason. There is so much expression of freedom, they let you be you, obviously in a structured way, but they let you be yourself.\n\"I’ve been here through the age groups, so it’s always nice to come here and play with people you have played with through the years. Some of my close friends are here, so it is always nice to come and play with them. James McAtee is my really close friend from [Manchester] City growing up.\"\nOn training with Kane, the Three Lions' all-time leading goalscorer, Delap could do little to hide his admiration of the Bayern Munich star.\n\"That was the first time I’ve trained with him. He is someone I’ve looked up to for ages. He’s got everything and has had the most amazing career. He’s still flying. For someone like me to look up to him and then watch him live is an incredible experience,\" he said.\n\"I had a little chat with him, he’s a really nice guy. I watched him enough in the shooting drill to take so much from him. He’s just incredible. Everything goes in. His all-round game is incredible and he’s played at the top level for so long.\"\nIn his first full Premier League campaign, Delap has already scored 10 goals in 28 appearances, for an Ipswich Town side currently in the relegation zone.\nAsked about how quickly he has taken to the top flight, he shared that he always believed in his own ability to thrive amongst the biggest clubs.\n\"I’ve always had that belief that I could take to the [Premier League quickly]. I had the backing of the manager [Kieran McKenna] and all the players which has helped me push on. Credit to them because they have given me the confidence and the belief.\"\nAlthough still facing a daunting battle against relegation, Delap offered huge praise for McKenna and the job he has undertaken with the Tractor Boys.\n\"He’s incredible, such a good guy. He’s improved and helped me so much, it’s just the little things. His ability to get the best out of every player is really good.\"",

    "text": "The Lake County Sheriff’s Department is investigating a Gary officer-involved shooting that left a 38-year-old man dead.\nAt about 8:38 p.m. Tuesday, sheriff’s department officers responded to a call in the 2200 block of Carolina Street to assist Gary police with an armed hostage situation, according to a release from the Lake County Sheriff’s Department. Upon arrival, a woman told police that her boyfriend had taken drugs and locked himself in a room with their 1-year-old child and a gun, a Gary Police release stated.\nAbout 20 minutes later, police received a call about a 35-year-old man being shot in the arm at the residence. He told police that he had gone to the house to get the child, his nephew, but was shot and fled to a nearby residence, police said. He refused medical treatment at the scene.\nOfficers made contact with the suspect — a 38-year-old man. Police could hear the baby crying inside, but couldn’t see the child. Gary Police tried to speak to the man through a back door, trying to de-escalate the situation, but the man shot through the door four times in the direction of officers, the release stated.\nPolice helped secure the perimeter around the building and alerted the Gary Police SWAT team. As the suspect was resisting de-escalation efforts and shooting at officers, the SWAT team breached the residence with a ram, police said. A drone showed the man had gone to the second floor with his child.\nTear gas was deployed by police. The man eventually walked out of an apartment around 4:20 a.m. holding a 1-year-old boy and waving a gun, police said.\nAs the man ran toward his vehicle and officers, a Gary police officer opened fire, and the suspect was later pronounced dead at the scene, the release stated.\nThe child was unharmed, but taken to Methodist Hospital Northlake as a precaution and the Department of Family Services was notified.\nEveryone involved in the incident has been left unnamed as the investigation is ongoing.\n“Our community is deeply saddened by this tragic incident that began as a family matter but escalated into a critical public safety situation involving a young child,” Gary Chief of Police Derrick Cannon said in a statement. “I commend the officers who responded to this dangerous scene where the subject repeatedly fired at officers. I also extend my sincere gratitude to Lake County Sheriff, Oscar Martinez for providing additional resources, including their Police Assisted Recovery Initiative (PARI) team with licensed social workers who supported our negotiators’ de-escalation efforts.”",
