    "text": "“I dati INAIL 2023, anche se provvisori, ci dicono che calano gli incidenti mortali in itinere, ma non quelli sui luoghi di lavoro, che passano da 722 a 745. Questo significa che anche se il numero complessivo diminuisce e cala in alcuni settori, non possiamo abbassare la guardia, perché ogni morto sul lavoro ferisce la coscienza civile del paese”. Lo ha dichiarato l’onorevole Chiara Gribaudo (Pd), Presidente della commissione d’Inchiesta sulle condizioni del lavoro in Italia della Camera dei Deputati a commento dei dai usciti oggi dall’INAIL sui primi 11 mesi del 2023.\n“Dobbiamo poi tener conto dell’aumento delle denunce delle malattie professionali, 67.094 nei primi 11 mesi del 2023, oltre 11mila in più rispetto allo stesso periodo del 2022. Il dato di per se non è preoccupante, perché è indice anche di una consapevolezza crescente rispetto ai rischi e alle conseguenze negative che possono scaturire dal lavoro. Ma questo richiede un impegno di tutte le istituzioni per garantire luoghi e tempi di lavoro sani, che non mettano a rischio la salute di lavoratori e lavoratrici, sopratutto attraverso la diffusione di una nuova cultura del lavoro più attenta ai diritti” ha aggiunto la deputata dem.",

    "text": "A woman considered to be one of New Zealand’s worst “serial and prolific” shoplifters took nearly $8500 worth of clothes from Auckland’s David Jones store in a single day.\nJennifer Gordon, in her late 40s, has an extensive criminal history, with 55 convictions for shoplifting or theft.\nShe has more than 150 convictions for dishonesty offending, as well as one for dealing in methamphetamine, for which she received two years and four months in prison in 2019.\nShe is currently back in prison for seven shoplifting convictions and one of possession of cannabis for supply.\nThe latest convictions cover shoplifting between September 2022 and June 2024, during which she took more than $25,000 worth of goods. None of the property was recovered.\nIn November last year, Gordon appeared before Judge Maria Pecotic in the Waitakere District Court and was sentenced to two years and six months in prison.\nHer criminal history and latest offending was detailed in a recently released High Court decision after she appealed that jail term, arguing it was “manifestly excessive”.\nIn the High Court at Auckland, Justice Andrew Becroft found otherwise, saying there was “no demonstrated error” in the sentencing judge’s approach and the prison term was an appropriate sentence.\n“While courts are traditionally sympathetic to those (often women) with deep-seated psychological problems leading them to struggle with lifelong and habitual shoplifting, the sentencing judge was alive to all these issues,” Justice Becroft said.\nThe High Court decision listed numerous times when Gordon went to retail stores, took items and left without paying.\nThief hid clothes in bags\nTypically, when stealing clothes, she went into the fitting rooms and put the garments in bags she had brought with her, removing security tags.\n“Of course, one can imagine more sophisticated shoplifting, but for an individual acting alone, her method was clearly considered and planned,” Justice Becroft said.\nThree of the shoplifting outings were to the upmarket David Jones store in Newmarket.\nOn September 23, 2022, Gordon took $1460 worth of clothes from David Jones, and she returned two days later to steal items worth $2187. On November 1, 2022, she took more clothes worth $8490 from the department store.\nOther shops targeted between December 2022 and June 2024 included Rebel Sport at Wairau ($2158 worth of goods), Farmers Albany ($2010 worth of duvet sets), Farmers Northwest ($400 of baby clothes) and Torpedo 7 Albany ($1350).\nOn April 8, 2023, she hit two stores in one day, taking electrical goods and other items from Briscoes Wairau Park ($4330) and Briscoes Glenfield Mall ($2509).\nOn April 5, 2024, she took $546 in power tools from Bunnings Westgate but was stopped by store security as she was leaving.\n“The accepted summary of facts identifies Ms Gordon as one of the highest-risk recidivist retail crime offenders in the country,” Justice Becroft said.\nIn September 2024, Gordon was traffic-stopped by police. Her car was searched when officers smelled cannabis.\nThey discovered three resealable bags containing 88.4g of cannabis, resulting in the conviction for possessing cannabis for supply.\nA ‘very sad’ personal life\nJustice Becroft said it was clear Gordon had had “a very sad personal life” and now suffered from anxiety, depression and addictions.\nOn top of that, a psychologist had assessed her as suffering from kleptomania — a compulsion to steal — and she had coped with her history of trauma through stealing, substance abuse and gambling.\nSome of Gordon’s shoplifting occurred while she was seeing a counsellor.\nMuch of it happened when she was on bail.",

    "text": "Comfort finds us in unexpected places. Like this simple, not-too-sweet, subtly flavored applesauce bread that boasts sugar and spice and all things nice. It’s lovely warm out of the oven, natch, but also toasted and slathered with butter the next morning or afternoon or at 2 am or, well, whenever you crave a little comfort.–David Leite\nApplesauce Bread FAQs\nWe’ve become quite fond of making\napplesauce from scratch. You know, the kind of applesauce that’s not uniformly smooth but rather punctuated with tender, sweetly tart chunks of caramelized apple goodness. And we tend to make so much of it we don’t hesitate to use it in this applesauce quick bread recipe to lend it a little something unexpected in terms of taste and texture.\nAlthough you certainly won’t be disappointed if you make this recipe with store-bought unsweetened applesauce. (Avoid sweetened applesauce, as it will result in an overly sweet bread.)\nAbsolutely. You’ll get about 24 muffins from a full recipe, and they’ll need to bake for about 20 minutes.\nWe think a\ncream cheese frosting and more chopped nuts would be lovely on top of the loaf, and that would make a phenomenal teacher or hostess gift, or a lovely “welcome to the neighborhood” gesture to new neighbors. As far as the sliced bread, we love it warm (or cold) plain, with butter, or cream cheese with another sprinkle of cinnamon would be fantastic, too.\n☞ Want other sweet bread recipes? Try these:\nApplesauce Bread\nIngredients\n- 4 large eggs, at room temperature\n- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar\n- 3 cups store-bought or\nhomemade applesauce, at room temperature\n- 2 sticks (8 oz) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled, plus more for the pan\n- 3 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 tablespoon baking soda\n- 1 teaspoon\nkosher salt\n- 1/2 teaspoon\nground cinnamon\n- 2 cups walnuts, lightly toasted and chopped (optional)\nInstructions\n- Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C). Lightly butter 2 loaf pans or place paper liners in 24 cupcake or muffin tins.\n- Toss the eggs and sugar in the bowl of a mixer fit with the paddle attachment and beat until the mixture thickens and turns the color of lemons, 2 to 3 minutes.\n- Add first the applesauce and then the butter and beat well, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. The mixture may appear curdled but fear not, you did not just ruin your quick bread batter. Everything is fine. Just keep on going with the recipe and keep calm.\n- Dump the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a separate bowl and mix well. Stir it into the applesauce mixture and beat to combine. Add the nuts, if desired, and mix well. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.\n- Scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pans or, if making muffins, use a 2-ounce ice cream scoop or heaping tablespoon to fill the prepared tins. Bake the bread until golden brown and firm in the center, about 1 hour for loaves and 20 to 25 minutes for muffins.\n- Let the bread cool in the pans for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and set aside to cool.\nAdapted From\nCookies for Kids’ Cancer\nBuy On Amazon\nNutrition\nNutrition information is automatically calculated, so should only be used as an approximation.\n@leitesculinariaor tag #leitesculinaria!\nRecipe Testers’ Reviews\nWith fall on the way, I’ve been wanting to make something with apples to celebrate the season. Since I had most of the ingredients on hand already, I was excited to make this delicious applesauce bread.\nI was afraid the bread might not be moist enough, since there was no yogurt or buttermilk involved, but the mixture of applesauce and butter really made a very moist bread. (To clarify, I used store-bought unsweetened applesauce; I didn’t want to use sweetened applesauce that might interfere with the flavor and sweetness of the other ingredients.)\nI did use walnuts, which I would recommend; the crunchiness added a nice texture to the bread. I made the bread in loaf pans, but instead of the one hour suggested cooking time, it actually took my bread one hour and 15 minutes to bake completely.\nJust like the title of its cookbook, I bet this delicious bread would sell out quickly at a bake sale!\nAn unpretentious, good-anytime applesauce bread that’s easy to make. It was extremely moist and had a gentle texture, and it stayed that way even after having been refrigerated overnight. In fact, I thought the deeper sweetness, which reminded me of dark brown sugar, tasted better the following day.\nI used store-bought applesauce without any added sugar. For a fancy look, I think you could “dress” the top of the batter before it goes in the oven; some of the chopped walnuts, sliced almonds, and thinly sliced apples come to mind.\nUPDATE I go back to this recipe time and time again. I used the\nApple Pear Sauce (a recent addition to LC) for my most recent batch, and the result was adored just as much as it had always been. I usually make two loaves (8 1/4-by-4 1/4 inches) and typically start checking the loaves at 50 minutes, but this time I baked one loaf with pecans on top and 12 muffins with sliced almonds on top. The muffins were done in 20 minutes.\nThis applesauce bread recipe delivers exactly what’s promised—easy to make, moist, AND you probably have these ingredients in your pantry.\nI made the applesauce using five apples, which was not enough (the five medium apples made about two cups). Luckily I had a small store-bought jar which, together with my homemade, made up the 3 required cups.\nLooks really nice and is nicely moist. It smells nice too! What more could you want? I’m going to freeze one and see how it tastes in a month or so.\nOh, and as I am not a fan of nuts in my breads, I didn’t use them. When I make this again, I might add some other spices, such as nutmeg or ginger, and more cinnamon.\nThis easy quick bread makes a scrumptious, moist loaf with ingredients most of us have on hand and in very short order! I made it on a Sunday morning and it was perfect for late breakfast-time on a slow-moving early fall day. Because it is both lovely and moist, it would, as the authors suggest, also be terrific for bake sales, and I think it would be a fine hostess gift at any time.\nThe directions were precisely correct, and after exactly 1 hour of baking time, I had a loaf with a beautiful crumb. I made this batch without walnuts, because I did not have them on hand, but, because I love nuts in my baked goods, would definitely add the optional nuts next time.\nNonetheless, this loaf is yummy in its most plain Jane version, and could only get better from there. I think pecans or almonds would substitute just fine for the walnuts. Further, pear sauce or apple pear sauce would add an additional hint of fall. I used a smooth applesauce, but I would also consider chunky to add a bit of texture to this bread.\nAnd for big cinnamon lovers, the cinnamon could be doubled for a spicier touch—or a pinch or two of cloves and/or nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon would switch it out a bit as well.\nButter, cream cheese, and/or apple butter would also complement this delicious loaf well.\nThis applesauce bread is one of the easiest quick breads I’ve ever had the pleasure to bake. A great change from banana bread. I wasn’t sure whether the standard-size loaf pan should be 9″ by 5″ or 8″ by 4″, so I used the latter. The loaves came out beautifully rounded on top.\nI did use the walnuts as suggested, and they made a nice textural addition to the bread. So moist and delicious. Great for dessert, breakfast or just snacking. Will definitely make this again!\nThis applesauce bread has a subtle applesauce-y, spicy taste. It’s a fine-grained loaf bread and it also makes wonderful muffins. The applesauce keeps it moist and flavorful without being too sweet. It is good with coffee, milk, and tea—what more could you ask for?\nThis recipe made 1 standard-size loaf and 18 muffins. Next, let’s see how it freezes because it would be great to have this on hand at all times.\nThis applesauce bread is a winner for any bake sale! I had all the ingredients on hand and it went together so fast. The result was two beautifully rounded loaves and the house smelled of fall.\nI used unsweetened store-bought applesauce. The cooking time for the loaves was perfect. I also made the recipe a second time and made all muffins. Again, the cooking time was perfect. I gave the loaves away (crazy me) and then kept all the muffins. Great little snack, and they stayed so moist. I think it would’ve been helpful to give the measurements for a “standard-size loaf pan.” To me, that means 8 1/2″ x 4 1/2″ x 2 1/2″. This is definitely a keeper!\nThere is nothing not to like about this recipe. It’s easy to make, most, if not all, of the ingredients are already in your pantry, and the result is a light, moist and flavorful bread (cake?) that can be served at any time of the day. I made 12 muffins with half of the batter and a loaf with the other half. I almost forgot to add the nuts to the batter, so as I was filling the muffin tin I simply sprinkled them on top. This actually worked better, since the muffins looked very “dressed up.”\nI didn’t have time to make my own applesauce, so I used regular Mott’s. I don’t think this had any effect on the end result, so take it easy and go with store-bought applesauce.\nLoved this easy, easy bread/muffin! It has great flavor and was ready in minutes. There are only a few common ingredients and I had everything I needed.\nI decided to make muffins for easy portability. I ended up using a combo of homemade and no-sugar-added Mott’s and they turned out very tasty. The only thing I questioned was the amount of flour vs. the amount of applesauce. I ended up adding about 1/2 cup more flour, as the batter seemed very wet and the muffins still turned out great! Will make again!\nI made this recipe twice. The first time I got 33 muffins instead of 24. They were perfectly done and golden brown at 20 minutes. I baked them in aluminum muffin pans with cupcake liners in them. The muffins were very moist and good, but I felt a slight aftertaste in my mouth after eating them. As the muffins aged in the fridge and I took them to work for my snack each day, that taste went away.\nSome of my tasters also commented on this, and some even asked if I’d put molasses in them. I thought a whole tablespoon of baking soda sounded like a lot, and maybe that was the culprit. I decided to make them a second time and use baking powder instead. I made a half recipe this time and used a silicone muffin pan with paper liners. It took about 10 minutes more baking time to get them to a golden brown, but they did taste much better from the start. These make a great snack and are very moist. I’ll be making them again, but with baking powder instead of baking soda.\nThe applesauce bread tastes good. I used the optional toasted walnuts and really liked the combination. Note that this requires a lot of butter. The butter overwhelms the applesauce flavor a little bit. If I were making this again, I would substitute safflower oil for all or part of the fat in the recipe. I always line my pans with parchment for quick loaves and so never have a problem with removing them from pans.",

    "text": "“Wynn Management Skills Program” graduation ceremony\nBusiness experts would undoubtedly agree that employee training is an indispensable tool for boosting both individual and organizational performance and lowering employee turnover, but also for maximizing job satisfaction and cultivating a company culture replete with enthusiasm and motivation.\nMoreover, in addition to training existing employees, nurturing young adults who are entering the workforce for the first time can help equip them with the necessary skills and experience that an industry requires, and gives them a reliable framework upon which they can start to build their career. This provides society with the skilled labor it needs to sustain itself and gives the youth a sense of purpose that can ultimately serve as a catalyst for business innovation and sustainable growth.\nProf. Im Sio Kei\nMs. Linda Chen\nThe hospitality industry is one of the cornerstones of the government’s “1+4” appropriate diversification development strategy as it was fundamental to Macao’s designation as a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy, it is the driving force behind our aim to become a “City of Sports” and is the key player in the successful implementation of the nascent “Big Health Tourism” that is being given so much focus as of late. Furthermore, a 2019 report authored by consultancy firm Deloitte on behalf of the Macao Government Tourism Office (MGTO) forecast the annual number of visitors to the city in 2025 will reach up to 41 million—a figure that surpasses that seen before the pandemic. However, the report also highlighted an inadequate level of human resource talent development at that time in Macao, which is why employee and youth training schemes have become so vitally important in recent years.\nWynn Macau has seized this unique opportunity to focus on team building and youth training to prepare a loyal, engaged, and productive team of hospitality specialists that the entire Greater Bay Area can be proud of. By launching the “Wynn Management Skills Program” in collaboration with Macao Polytechnic University (MPU), management staff can now enroll on a two-year professional training program that specializes in a range of different fields to cultivate interdisciplinary strategic thinking that will solidify Macao’s position as a global tourist destination. As a testimony to the success of these efforts, 45 trainees were recently awarded professionally accredited certificates at a graduation ceremony held at the MPU. In a speech given at the event, President and Vice Chairman of the Board of Wynn Macau Limited Ms. Linda Chen commented on the importance of these courses that “allow the trainees to gain a sharper business insight and broad visions of the market, which can deepen their understanding of innovative technology and the ever-changing business environment and are very important for their career development.”\nThe two-year program covers important topics ranging from regional and national industrial development, trends of digital finance, and current application of high technology in tourism and entertainment scenarios to integrated resort management models featuring interdisciplinary collaboration. Rector of Macao Polytechnic University, Prof. Im Sio Kei, praised the long-term cooperation the institute has with Wynn Macau and highlighted its wider import to “foster a sustainable pool of high-quality integrated tourism and leisure professionals for Macao.”\n20 youths participated in the hospitality management certified program\nWynn x EHL Hospitality Management Certified Program\nFor the hospitality industry to progress and comprehensively elevate its quality and services, training must be provided to every level of the workforce, ranging from top management to entry-level workers. Every employee has potential, and Wynn Macau is fully committed to investing in that potential and transforming it into a tangible reality. This is one of the many reasons they have now partnered with a global leader in education and innovation for the hospitality sector—the EHL Hospitality Business School based in Switzerland—who offer a wide array of hospitality management degrees for people with varying backgrounds and career aspirations. Together, they have rolled out “Wynn x EHL Hospitality Management Certified Program” which is specifically designed to nurture the talent of local youth to maximize their engagement and contribution to the hospitality industry.\nThe program attracted 20 young professionals who embarked on a transformative educational experience throughout October and November. Upon completion, the students had all received valuable vocational training and had expanded their understanding of the complexities of hotel operations and the practical skills required in the hospitality industry. The training was delivered in three separate modules: “Personal Effectiveness and How to be a Future Leader in Hospitality” which focused on increasing self-awareness and adaptability and developing the important skills of effective communication and influential leadership; “Hospitality Luxury Brand Management” which equipped the trainees with hands-on practical knowledge of the intricacies of luxury brands, and the strategic choices implicit in luxury branding and communication in various industries; and “Data Analytics for Hospitality” which taught the important skills of collecting, transforming, analyzing, and interpreting data related to both the rooms division and food and beverage division, and the techniques required to communicate their findings with stakeholders.\nVice President of Learning and Advancement at Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace, Dr. Barry Ip, highlighted how the valuable experience that EHL brings from its international hospitality operations is highly beneficial to the development of youth in Macao, and high-level training such as this would contributes significantly towards solidifying Macao’s position as a World Center of Tourism and Leisure.\nTalent development is the key to unlocking Macao’s moderate economic and industrial diversification and Wynn has shown consistent dedication to providing diverse training programs for its team members in the hope of fostering more outstanding local talent and creating more upward mobility opportunities, not just for the individual in the workplace, but also for Macao on the world stage.",

The mosque also scheduled the Tahajjud night prayer at12:00 and visiting hours will conclude at 23:30 throughout the week, for the duration of this period. In readiness for Ramadan’s concluding ten days, the centre has outfitted the mosque’s courtyard with approximately 1,500 carpets.

The mosque is also equipped with 50 wheelchairs and 3,515 seats to ensure the comfort of worshippers. Moreover, in collaboration with the Abu Dhabi Civil Defence Authority, ambulances are on standby, and a civil defence team will be stationed at the mosque.

    "text": "„Höhle der Löwen“-Star Judith Williams warnt Fans eindringlich: „Fallt darauf nicht rein“\nUnternehmerin Judith Williams, bekannt aus „Die Höhle der Löwen“, ist aktuell sehr besorgt. Auf Instagram sendet sie ihren Fans eine ernste Botschaft.\nHerrsching – Die erfolgreiche „Höhle der Löwen“-Investorin Judith Williams (53) ist Rampenlicht gewöhnt. Sie selbst steht mit ihrem Gesicht vor allem für die erfolgreichen Produkte ihrer Kosmetiklinie. Als Geschäftsfrau mit Herz ist sie zudem sehr nahbar. Kunden und Fans vertrauen ihrem Urteil und Rat. Das macht ihr Business so erfolgreich. Doch das könnte ihr zum Verhängnis werden.\n„Höhle der Löwen“-Investorin Judith Williams kämpft gegen Betrüger\nNun richtet die smarte Geschäftsfrau auf Instagram ernste Worte an ihre Fans. Scheinbar nutzen Betrüger ihren Namen und ihr Gesicht, um mit minderwertigen Produkten das schnelle Geld zu machen. „Bitte fallt darauf nicht rein! Wir haben bereits rechtliche Schritte eingeleitet“, schreibt Judith Williams in einem Post. Die Fans sind dankbar für den Tipp und bewundern sie dafür, dass sie so aktiv dagegen vorgeht.\nJudith Williams ist klar, dass es nicht einfach sein wird, die Betrüger dingfest zu machen. Unter den Anzeigen sind viele KI-generierte Inhalte. Sie kennt sich aus, denn in ihren Firmen sind inzwischen ebenfalls KI-Tools im Einsatz. „Solange der Mensch im Mittelpunkt bleibt, kann KI ein mächtiger Begleiter sein“, sagt die Unternehmerin in einem aktuellen Interview mit der Zeitschrift KI-Buzzer. Sie weiß um den Nutzen und die Möglichkeiten der Technik bestens Bescheid.\nJudith Williams kennt die Gefahren von Fake-Profilen\nDie aktuellen Fake-Anzeigen können Judith Williams erheblich schaden. Kunden, die den Betrug nicht sofort durchschauen, vermuten vielleicht Absicht. Doch die „Höhle der Löwen“-Jurorin hat zum Glück den Ernst der Lage erkannt und wehrt sich öffentlich gegen die dunklen Schatten im Netz. Ihre Fans stehen hinter ihr und melden sogar selbst immer wieder Fake-Anzeigen und Profile.\nSolche Herausforderungen im Unternehmensalltag schlauchen, immerhin hat Judith Williams viele andere Projekte – wie ihr Ausflug zum „Traumschiff“ – auf der Tagesordnung. Erholung sucht sie im Zuhause am Ammersee. Sie ist ein Familienmensch durch und durch und findet vor allem bei Ehemann Alexander Rat. „Er ist ein ganz wunderbarer Mensch mit sehr tiefsinnigen Gedanken“, sagte sie einst gegenüber der Zeitschrift Bunte.
