    "text": "Siria ha denunciado este jueves un ataque israelí desde los Altos del Golán, ocupados por Israel, hacia el sur del país en medio de la escalada de la violencia por la situación en la Franja de Gaza, controlada por el Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica (Hamás). \"Nuestras fuerzas de defensa aérea respondieron a los misiles y derribaron la mayoría de ellos\", ha señalado una fuente militar siria a la agencia de noticias estatal SANA, agregando que ha habido \"pérdidas materiales\", si bien se desconoce si hay víctimas. Según ha informado el Observatorio Sirio para los Derechos Humanos, con sede en Londres e informante en el país árabe, las fuerzas israelíes han disparado misiles contra el Aeropuerto Internacional de Damasco y un puesto de control en el sur, ubicado en la ciudad de Sweida. Esto se produce después de que en la víspera despegara el primer avión desde que el aeropuerto quedó fuera de servicio tras un ataque israelí el pasado 22 de octubre que acabó con la vida de dos trabajadores civiles del aeropuerto y dañó las pistas. Los vuelos estaban desviados al aeropuerto de Latakia. Los Altos del Golán son un territorio que Israel arrebató a Siria durante la Guerra de los Seis Días (1967) y la Guerra del Yom Kipur (1973) y que se anexionó de forma efectiva en 1981, en un movimiento no reconocido por la comunidad internacional.\nSiria denuncia un ataque de Israel desde los ocupados Altos del Golán hacia el sur del país\nDEPORTES\nTevez habló del mercado de Independiente: el extranjero que es “prioridad”, la frase que le dijo a Alan Franco y la polémica sobre Santi López\nLa marca más peculiar de Lionel Messi en 2023: no se daba desde hacía 19 años\nRiver Plate volvió a la carga por una promesa del fútbol uruguayo: su parecido con Cavani y el “guiño” que ilusiona a los hinchas\nAtento Boca Juniors: un club brasileño mejoró la millonaria oferta por una de sus figuras y el Inter Miami se mete en la pelea\nENTRETENIMIENTO TENDENCIAS\nBebidas sin alcohol: qué alternativas creativas y sabrosas existen\nLos alimentos saludables son esenciales para el control del peso efectivo a largo plazo, según expertos de Harvard\nGlaciares, bosques y quema de tierras: qué plantea la Ley Ómnibus para el cuidado del ambiente",

    "title": "New study reveals stark climate reality for young Canadians - North Shore News",
    "text": "Hundreds of millions of people born in recent years—including hundreds of thousands of Canadians—are expected to be hit hardest by a rise extreme weather events, a new study has found.\nThe global study, published in the journal Nature and led by Canadian Luke Grant, found that the number of people facing unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves, crop failures, river floods, droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones will at least double from 1960 to 2020 if current policies to avoid global warming aren’t strengthened.\nInstead of measuring exposure to extreme weather based on assets damaged, or people harmed and killed, the study measured impacts based on “unprecedented lifetime exposure”—a threshold beyond which the frequency of exposure is extremely unlikely in a world without climate change.\nCurrent policies to draw down global warming are expected to limit temperature increases to 2.7 C above pre-industrial levels by 2100.\nBut at only 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming, 62 million children—more than half the people born in 2020—face exposure to a lifetime of unprecedented heat waves, the study found.\nThat number goes up to 92 per cent, or 111 million people worldwide, if global temperatures climb to 3.5 C above pre-industrial levels.\n“The most important point here is emissions of earlier generations is having a disproportionate impact on later generations,” said Grant.\nYounger Canadian generations to see major increase in exposure to extreme events\nIn addition to its global findings, the study broke down exposures to extreme weather events by country.\nUnder the Paris climate accords, countries around the world promised to keep global temperatures below 1.5 C of warming above pre-industrial levels.\nIn that scenario, 43 per cent of Canadian babies born in 2020 would see a spike in exposure to unprecedented heat waves, up from 19 per cent for those born in 1960.\nAt 2.5 C warming, exposure rises from 13 per cent to 76 per cent between the two cohorts.\nAnd at 3.5 C of warming, the researchers calculated that 98 per cent of Canadian babies born in 2020 (370,000 individuals) would see unprecedented exposure from heat waves, up from 18 per cent, or 74,000 babies, born in 1960.\nMajor increases in exposure to wildfire, crop failures and flooding were also found between the Canadian generations.\nUnder all warming scenarios, only two per cent of those born in 1960 are expected to face unprecedented exposure to wildfires. But for those born in 2020, that number climbs to between 14 and 23 per cent depending on the depth of global warming.\nMeanwhile, unprecedented crop failures are expected to impact up to 11 per cent of Canada’s population born in 2020, up from two per cent for those born in 1960.\nAnd when it comes to flooding, up to 14 per cent of babies born in 2020 are expected to face unprecedented impacts, a major increase from the one per cent of babies affected who were born in 1960.\nGrant warned that the country level data could see major swings as climate change progresses and people react to their new reality.\nRegardless of the final numbers, he said Canada’s current affordability crisis means young people face the prospect of rising costs at the same time they will be exposed to more frequent and powerful heat waves. That will leave many people even more vulnerable to extreme weather, he said.\n“What’s special about our study is that it’s multidisciplinary—we’re taking a lot of effort to draw a connection between climate modelling and the human experience,” said Grant.\nClimate action could prevent dangerous heat wave exposure for hundreds of millions of children\nNow a physical scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada based in Victoria, Grant carried out the study using work he did during his PhD studies in Brussels, Belgium.\nThe study pointed to the European city as an example, noting a person born in Brussels in 1960 would go on to see three unprecedented heat waves in their lifetime there.\nBabies born in 2020, meanwhile, were projected to experience 11 heatwaves under 1.5 C of warming; 18 heatwaves under 2.5 C of warming; and 26 heatwaves under a 3.5 C increase in global temperature.\nAt a global level, if warming were to increase to 3.5 C above pre-industrial levels, 29 per cent of children born in 2020 will face unprecedented exposure to crop failures while 14 per cent would face unprecedented exposure to river floods.\nOn the other hand, keeping warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 would protect huge swaths of some of humanity's youngest generations, the study found.\nCompared to the 2.7 C of warming expected under current policies, the Paris climate accord target would allow 613 million children born between 2003 and 2020 to avoid such lifetime exposure to heat waves.\nAnother 98 million of these children would avoid the impacts of crop failures; 64 million wouldn’t see river floods; 76 million would stay out of the way of tropical cyclones; 26 million would sidestep drought; and 17 million would evade wildfires.\nNumbers are ‘conservative’ estimates\nIn focusing on the local impacts of extreme weather events, the researchers did not analyze how people might adapt (say by buying a heat pump or air conditioning unit) or fail to adapt (by not having money to do so).\nThe study also did not look at how the effects of climate change can cross jurisdictions.\nThe researchers pointed out gaps in their data when it comes to knock-on effects to taxation as governments spend to rebuild damaged public infrastructure. The researchers also left out potential disruption to supply chains and how the collapse of a country’s agricultural breadbasket could draw down the availability of food across the globe.\nEven the direct, but non-local, impacts of wildfire smoke weren’t captured by the study—an impact made more tangible this week in research published by the Canadian Medical Association Journal. That study found Canada’s 2023 wildfires led to daily increases of 11 per cent to 24 per cent in asthma-related emergency department visits across 30 public health units in Ontario.\nTogether, those gaps mean the study's estimates are conservative, the authors note, with extreme events likely to affect a growing share of the world’s youngest people.",

With the support and sponsorship of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, FIRST Israel offers children programming from when they are in primary school to when they attend high school through which they can learn about robotics as part of a team and community. ;These programs - FIRST LEGO League Challenge for primary school students and FIRST Robotics Competition for high school students &ndash; also provide a platform for kids to learn about core values such as teamwork, the importance of the process of learning, and inclusion.\"I called this year &lsquo;We continue thanks to them.&rsquo;\"Ido Mazorskiconsole.log(\"2390 BODY2.

All five were passionate about the competition, and some of them volunteered at competitions after graduation.FIRST competitions in IsraelEvery year competitions in Israel are a celebration of robotics and inclusiveness and include children from all sectors, this year was no different, both Ido Mazorski, the leaving CEO, and Gila Kusan, longtime FIRST Israel employee and entering CEO, told The Jerusalem Post.This year, the competition began a few weeks before October 7th. For the first three weeks of the war, Mazorski was called to the army, and work at FIRST Israel became slow. &ldquo;After three weeks of the war, I gathered all of the mentors and told them that we had to get the kids to the workshops,&rdquo; he told the Post.

Uploaded on 4/5/2024 (credit: FIRST ISRAEL)Throughout the preparation time for the competition in Israel, Mazorski and the FIRST Israel organization team helped participants from across the country &ldquo;to allow the kids to have the experience that we wanted them to have,&rdquo; said Kusan.She further stressed that &ldquo;there was more intensive work on the Core Values, to give the kids a sense of security. It was important to us to have this activity without including anything that does not relate to FIRST.&rdquo; Kusan then added that throughout the teams&rsquo; preparation time, &ldquo;There was a feeling of camaraderie, we are the FIRST family, despite that horrific event, we found a way to have this activity, and it allowed us to incredible achievements.&rdquo;The team&rsquo;s efforts came to fruition in a five-day festival in Haifa where approximately 450 \"teams from all sectors&rdquo; participated said Kusan to the Post. When asked how the war affected team participation, Mazorski stated, &ldquo;There was almost no team that did not participate because of the war.&rdquo;&ldquo;The kids come to the event for the experience, and not for politics, the notion of inclusion is one of FIRST&rsquo;s Core Values, it's embedded in the organization,&rdquo; said Mazorski regarding how Jewish and Arab kids contacted throughout the competition.However, since the war broke out and many teams could not work on their robot and teamwork, the FIRST Israel team decided to extend the preparation period for the FIRST LEGO League Challenge. Therefore, Israel could not send representatives to the FIRST LEGO League Challenge world festival.The International FIRST Robotics Competition in Texas FRC Team Orbit #1690 taking a picture with the banner showing they won first place in the world championship in Texas. Uploaded on 4/5/2024 (credit: FIRST ISRAEL)On the other hand, the FIRST Robotics Competition (for high school students) teams were able to stay on schedule and sent the teams that won in Israel to the international competition in Houston Texas, where the Israeli team from Binyamina called Orbit #1690 won first place for the first time in FIRST Israel&rsquo;s history.&ldquo;550 kids and adults flew to the US, 14 teams, and we won big time,&rdquo; said Mazorski to the Post. In addition to Orbit #1690 winning first place, another team from Israel won a prestigious award. A team from Holon, called Team Sycamore #5614, won an award called The Impact Award, which is one of the most sought-after awards the competition offers. The award is given to the team who has had a significant positive effect on their community for an extended period of time and exposed people to STEM. When asked about the reception the Israeli teams received in the US, Mazorski emphasized to the Post the importance the organization put into separating the competition and world politics. He said, &ldquo;When we got to the US, there was nothing out of the ordinary, we made sure to maintain restraint and avoid transforming the event into something else.&rdquo;",

    "text": "News Search | All News Topics > Airline Industry ; Press Releases by Industry Channel > [All Airline Industry Press Releases](/pr_archive) Contact: Dan Hubbard, 202-431-5970, [dhubbard@nbaa.org](mailto:dhubbard@nbaa.org) Washington, DC, April 4, 2024 – The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) welcomed the release this week of a comprehensive series of industry recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) addressing concerns about mental health from across the aviation community. Formed in December 2023, the Mental Health & Aviation Medical Clearances Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC) was tasked with five primary responsibilities. Topping that list was identifying factors that discourage those in the aviation industry from disclosing mental health concerns. Potential barriers identified by the committee include culture, trust, fear, stigma, knowledge and information gap and financial. “These concerns often stand in the way of pilots and controllers seeking mental health help,” said Mark Larsen, CAM, NBAA’s director for safety and flight operations and an ARC member. The ARC also reviewed mental health guidelines and procedures in place at other international regulatory agencies, acknowledging their experiences can help inform revisions to FAA’s approaches. “In total, the ARC report includes 24 recommendations to the FAA and aviation stakeholders,” Larsen said. “If fully implemented, these recommendations would help ensure those in the aviation community seek out appropriate resources and treatment to address mental health concerns.” These recommendations include: - Create a non-punitive pathway for disclosing mental health conditions and treatments. - Revise and evaluate the requirements for reporting and certification/qualification of psychotherapy (talk therapy), depression/anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. - Ensure aeromedical screening protocols and requirements are based on safety management system (SMS) principles (i.e., proportionate, relevant and risk-based) and appropriately communicated to applicants. - Expand the use and promotion of peer support programs. - Develop mental health literacy, education and awareness campaigns. - Increase mental health training and improve quality assurance for aviation medical examiners (AMEs). - Modernize the FAA’s information management system/Aviation Medical Certification Subsystem. Larsen noted the report and its recommendations were adopted unanimously by ARC members. “This shows a deep understanding and broad desire from the aviation community to reduce the barriers that keep pilots, air traffic controllers and others from seeking mental health care,” he said. “We applaud the FAA, and specifically the Office of Aerospace Medicine, for convening the ARC to bring industry and government together to address this important safety issue,” Larsen added. “NBAA will continue its leadership promoting aviation mental health and take steps to further support the mental health of those in business aviation.” Read the Mental Health & Aviation Medical Clearances Aviation Rulemaking Committee Report . # # # Founded in 1947 and based in Washington, DC, the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) is the leading organization for companies that rely on general aviation aircraft to help make their businesses more efficient, productive and successful. The association represents more than 10,000 company and professional members and provides more than 100 products and services to the business aviation community, including the NBAA Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (NBAA-BACE), the world’s largest civil aviation trade show.
