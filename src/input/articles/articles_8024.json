    "text": "The current president of Ecuador, Daniel Noboa, has asked for international assistance to combat the drug trafficking and violence that has taken over his nation over the last five years. This is violence that has affected Afro Ecuadorian people and caused massive displacement. We spoke with the Afro Ecuadorian journalist/community leader Juan Montaño about the situation. AmNews: How does the armed conflict affect the Afro Ecuadorian population? Juan Montaño: As one of the Ecuadorian ethnic groups with the highest rate of impoverishment, the impact is major. Black communities in the north of the province of Esmeraldas have been (and are) the most affected by the violence of different criminal groups who have allied with business groups. The reckless felling of the primary forest, illegal mining, and the planting of palm oil have all led to the migration of dozens of families to the cities of Guayaquil and Quito, and the creation of new population settlements in other provinces (for example, in Santo Domingo or the Ecuadorian East) and our dispersion throughout the country. This uprooting has an impact on the education of Afro Ecuadorian youth, a high percentage of whom are now members of criminal gangs. That also deepens the community’s impoverishment and gives some people an alleged justification for racist depictions of us and discriminatory actions. AmNews: What are the most affected Afro Ecuadorian regions? JM: Mainly in the province and city of Esmeraldas and in the neighborhoods of Guayaquil––for example, Pablo Neruda, and La Trinitaria, to name a few. The city of Esmeraldas, where I live, is economically dying from various extortion and business assaults. And the extortion is at all levels: The shoe-shiners are even being extorted. We believe criminal groups from other countries are reorganizing and redirecting the local criminals in Ecuador. For example, extortion (usually called vacuna, the Colombian phrase for extortion), the number of hitmen (increased spectacularly), and the blackmailing of Ecuadorian and Esmeraldan authorities have increased. That is why this year, the province and city of Esmeraldas have shocking figures: 81 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the highest in the world! An important, and quite large, proportion of the victims are Black people: yet, so are the perpetrators (they are mostly youth). AmNews: What is Esmeralda’s situation in regards to this conflict and how do you think it could be solved? JM: It needs to be noted that: First, the violence has increased impoverishment, even though the province was already poverty-stricken. And it is a province with fewer people working in state institutions, so if the economic dynamics (like the circulation of the dollar) slow down or drop to a minimum, problems such as begging accelerate and grow, but the labor force for the criminal gangs increases. That’s what’s happening now. Second, some authorities in Esmeraldas govern in absentia because gangs threaten them. But it must also be said that many of these authorities and their lack of vision took us back to the 1990s because of their inefficiency. Third, private initiatives by Esmeraldans have stopped and one of their most important economic activities––tourism––has been reduced to almost nothing. Better said, unemployment has become a deadly tragedy. Fourth, education levels, which were already tenuous following the last government administrations (of Lenín Moreno, Guillermo Lasso, and the current Daniel Noboa) worsened. Now there has been the creation of gangs or involvement of gangs in educational institutions. Again, everything is heading to a point of no return. Fifth, the lack of social investments in the area is an “absence of the state.” Afro Ecuadorian organizations have denounced this situation many times, but this has been ignored and underreported by the traditional media. We even proposed doing a “March of 10,000” to Quito to demonstrate against this, but we were not able to come to a consensus and the march has been postponed. In Afro Ecuadorian organizations, we believe that one of the only ways we can reverse our current situation will be to fight “by all means necessary,” following the philosophy of Malcolm X.",

    "title": "Nevada National Guard Pays Tribute To Garrison Brown",
    "text": "The late Garrison Brown touched the lives of many people and not all of them were Sister Wives fans. The Nevada National Guard Servicemen and Women knew him as well, and they paid him a nice tribute on Friday. He was in the process of transferring to Arizona’s Nation Guard when he passed away. Garrison Brown Joined The National Guard It’s been more than seven years since TLC aired the discussion between Kody Brown, Janelle, and their son about wanting to join the military. Eventually, he decided on the National Guard. His half-brother, Paedon also joined the National Guard. TLC fans saw that when her son came home from training, Janelle cried with joy, and Kody Brown felt very proud of him. Garrison Brown was the darling of his family and his fans, except that his father became estranged from him during the coronavirus. Still, that doesn’t cancel out his military-loving son from the heart of his father. When he heard about the young man’s death, he allegedly raced to his house. No doubt, there will be many regrets. However, he hopefully takes some comfort from the nice things that the National Guard soldiers said about his son. National Guard Pays Respectful Tribute To Garrison On March 8, The Nevada Army National Guard Soldier’s Facebook page shared a long and special tribute in honor of Janelle and Kody’s son . It also came with two photos of the young man who served his country, which you see further down in this article. Judging by what was said, he seemed like a respected and dedicated military man. Master Sgt. Christopher LaDuca said that they got to know the family. But, he added: [Garrison’s] done everything you can do here for a guy who is combat arms, from gunner on a Bradley (armored vehicle) to dismount team leader. He was also a great listener. I have pictures of him in the back of classrooms taking notes. In the field, he was always tuned in and locked in for every piece of information. He never talked down to people or played the macho game. He spent most of his time just doing what was right. Capt. Elijah Armstrong, 1st Squadron, 221st Cavalry Maintenance Officer also had some nice things to say about Staff Sgt. Robert Garrison Brown : He loved being in the military. He loved his family. He loved getting out into the field with his fellow Soldiers, [and] He will be greatly missed. Sister Wives Fans React When the post arrived on a Reddit community about Sister Wives, the OP shared a screenshot and said: A lovely tribute from the Nevada National Guard honoring Garrison’s memory. TLC fans who joined in the discussion were very taken by the achievements of Garrison Brown . Here’s what some of them said: - As viewers we have some insight to how precious of a soul he was, but its so clear that he was absolutely treasured by all who were blessed to know him. - This is really lovely. He was clearly well thought of among his peers. - Ugly crying over this line. We have lost a beautiful soul. Such a tragedy. - this is so sweet of them, but also makes me sad that Garrison’s army brothers and sisters are hurting. sweet Garrison, you will be so sorely missed. - What a meaningful tribute. Someday when it isn’t so raw I think this will bring so much comfort to the familly. What did you think of the fine tribute by the National Guard of Nevada for their brother-in-arms?
