    "text": "ABIDJAN, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast on Tuesday said there were good prospects for the April-to-September mid crop despite very little rainfall across all cocoa regions.\nThe world's top cocoa producer is its mid-November-to-March dry season. Rainfall is sparse during this period.\nThe season also coincides with dry Harmattan winds that blow south from the Sahara between December and March, and can damage crops.\nSeveral farmers said flowers and cherelles were abundant, and that many beans from the October-to-March main crop would be leaving the bush until mid-February as pods were ripening.\nThey said their focus had shifted to the weather's impact on the mid crop.\n\"There are enough flowers and cherelles for the mid crop. If we have good rain these months it will be better for the next steps,\" said Salame Kone, who farms near the western region of Soubre, where 2.8 millimetres of rain (mm) fell last week, 2.1 mm below the five-year average.\nSimilar conditions were reported in the southern regions of Agboville and Divo and in the eastern region of Abengourou, where there was no rain last week.\nThere was also no rain in the centre-western region of Daloa and in the central regions of Bongouanou and Yamoussoukro.\nFarmers there said the intensity of Harmattan winds had dropped.\n\"Everything is going well for the trees. We have big pods for this month and for next month. The mid crop is also starting well,\" said Albert N’Zue, who farms near Daloa, where rainfall last week was 2.7 mm below the five-year average.\nCocoa cooperatives and farmers said bean buyers for major exporters and grinders were paying 1,050 CFA francs ($1.78) per kilogram, 50 more than the guaranteed price of 1,000 CFA francs ($1.69).\nThey said it was an attempt to attract more farmers as they feared a lack of beans meant they would be unable to honour their contracts.\nAverage temperatures ranged between 27.9 Celsius (82.22 Fahrenheit)and 29C this week.\n($1 = 591.5000 CFA francs)\n(Reporting by Loucoumane Coulibaly Editing by Sofia Christensen and Barbara Lewis)\n(( ;))\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "City breathes easier with improved AQI, thanks to wind reversal | Mumbai news - Hindustan Times",
    "text": "City breathes easier with improved AQI, thanks to wind reversal Mumbai's air quality improved from 'poor' to 'moderate' due to a wind reversal mechanism that swept away pollutants and replaced them with clean air. Mumbai: After consistently choking in ‘poor’ air for weeks, the city breathed easier on Monday as its Air Quality Index (AQI) levels improved from 181 (poor) to 132 (moderate). Thanks to the wind reversal mechanism on Sunday night that swept away pollutants and replaced them with clean air. Prof (Dr) Gufran Beig, chair professor at NIAS, IISC and founder of SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research) explained this natural phenomenon, “There is always a wind reversal every 4 to 5 days where the wind blows from the sea towards land and vice-versa. When the wind blows from land towards the sea, then pollution peaks and when there is a wind reversal, it comes from the sea sweeping away all the pollutants. So, this is a kind of reversal which happened Sunday night where a fast wind blew from the sea towards the land which resulted in improved air quality.” He added that this trend will continue for at least four to five days. [Click here](https://www.hindustantimes.com/2024-planner-guide-and-2023-top-events-recap) Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed that out of 24 locations in the city, four locations recorded ‘poor’ air quality; 18 were in the ‘moderate’ category and only two locations had an AQI below 100. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe. Kandivali West and Siddharth Nagar in Worli, where the AQI reached 214 and 212, fell in the poor category followed by Chembur at 205, Shivaji Nagar in Govandi at 203. The locations in the moderate category were Byculla at 185, Navy Nagar in Colaba at 159, Malad West at 119, Kandivali East at 122, Powai at 126, Chakala in Andheri East at 110, Mulund West at 105, Kurla at 108, Andheri airport at 108, Vile Parle West at 113, Sion at 131, Colaba at 107 and Vasai West at 115. The only area which recorded an AQI level below 100, are Khindipada in Bhandup West at 85 and Borivali East at 96. Not just that the IMD forecast expecting minimum temperatures to fall down to 18 degrees C will have to wait and Mumbai will record a minimum temperature of 20 degrees C for the next three days. According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast, a dip in temperature was expected by one or two degrees on January 2 and 3. Sunil Kamble, director, IMD, told HT that this will not happen at least for the next three days. “In the next two-three days the minimum temperatures will be in the range of 20degC and maximum will be 33degC.We are not getting strong northerly winds.We were expecting some westerly disturbance (WD) will come and give a good snowfall in the northern region but it was not that strong and that’s why we will not expect drop in temperature for the next 2-3 days. Mumbai’s cold weather depends on weather in the north and we will get the effect of it after 2-3days,” he said.",
