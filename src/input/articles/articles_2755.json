    "title": "Timeline: Strong-to-severe thunderstorms could bring flooding, gusty winds to Chicago area",
    "text": "The Chicago area could see more showers and thunderstorms on Thursday, with a chance of severe weather looming in the forecast. According to the Storm Prediction Center, the area remains at a “marginal” risk of severe storms, with a few different threats possible as the day moves along. Here’s what we know about when those storms could arrive, and what they could bring to the region. Thursday Afternoon Thursday afternoon will see widely-scattered showers and thunderstorms across the area, and while no sustained severe weather is expected during that time, there is still a chance for some gusty winds and flooding in some locations, with heavy rain possible. Thursday Evening According to the NBC 5 Storm Team, the greater threat for severe storms could come in the evening hours, especially in areas north of Interstate 88, though storms could develop throughout the Chicago area. According to the SPC’s guidance, the main threats will be gusty winds, which could exceed 60 miles per hour, and a risk of flash flooding due to anticipated heavy rain. There is also a low risk for damaging hail of up to an inch in diameter, and a non-zero risk of tornadoes, especially in counties north of Chicago. Those storms are expected to push out of the area by the late evening hours and into Friday morning, but more could arrive in fairly short order. Friday The low-pressure system that could bring showers and storms to the area Thursday will park itself over Lake Michigan for a short period of time Friday morning, and could generate more showers and storms during the morning. That system could also generate winds off of Lake Michigan that will bring cooler temperatures to the region on Friday, with highs only in the upper-70s or low-80s to begin the weekend. Saturday/Sunday While areas near the lake will remain cool over the weekend, with highs in the low-80s, the rest of the region will see temperatures rise back into the mid-to-upper 80s before another chance of a cool down arrives next week. More importantly, dry conditions are expected for the weekend, a welcome sight for those going to Lollapalooza and other significant events.",

    "title": "10 Video Game Remakes NO ONE Asked For",
    "text": "10 Video Game Remakes NO ONE Asked For\nDo you want an Until Dawn remake? No? Well, here it is anyway.\nMany factors have to be taken into consideration before remaking a video game. How can the property be updated while still maintaining the essence of the original? What elements can be improved upon? Can modern technology be implemented to enhance the gaming experience?\nOf course, the most important question to ask is also the simplest - Is the demand still there? Square knew Final Fantasy VII Remake would sell like crazy, since the fanbase have been begging for a reboot for decades. When Resident Evil 2 Remake topped the charts, Capcom got to work on redoing the follow-ups, since interest in the zombie saga peaked.\nHowever, there are times when a publisher or development team decide to give an RPG, platformer, or a shooter a do-over, despite the fact nobody asked for it. When a title is still available on last-gen systems, it comes across as greedy to retool it for the latest console with the mildest tweaks. If the game in question is terrible or if the IP has been dead in the water for years, bringing it back rarely bodes well.\nWith that in mind, it's bewildering why these ten remakes got the thumbs up when it was crystal clear that nobody wanted them.\n10. GoldenEye 007\nIt's hard to comprehend how impactful GoldenEye 007 was. Thanks to its accessible controls, mission-based gameplay, perfect soundtrack, flawlessly structured levels, and masterful multiplayer, it revolutionised the first-person shooters and proved movie tie-in games could be top-quality. (It also made everyone develop an unbridled hatred for Oddjob.) As a result, Bond enthusiasts were giddy with excitement upon learning GoldenEye 007 was being remade.\nSadly, that elation turned to confusion when it became apparent 2010's GoldenEye 007 was a remake in name only. Daniel Craig was portraying James Bond in the films at the time, so it was decided the martini-guzzling secret agent would be modelled off him instead of Pierce Brosnan.\nTo further emulate the modern Bond era, this revision removed the banter with Q and Moneypenny prior to missions, since the characters hadn't appeared in the on-screen reboot at the time. Bond's relationship with the main villain, Alec Trevelyan, was completely rewritten, distancing the plot from the source material once again.\nAnyone intending to give this GoldenEye 007 a go purely to scratch that nostalgic itch were shocked to learn the levels had been redesigned from the ground up. Basically, the reboot had little resemblance to its N64 counterpart.\nIronically, the game itself was pretty solid. But it was so divorced from what came before, it seemed disingenuous to call it a GoldenEye 007 remake.",

    "text": "At 7.30 p.m., as the flames started rising from the funeral pyre of BRS MLA Lasya Nanditha, there was a chilling calm. The family members watched in hushed silence holding each other’s hands at the East Marredpally’s Smashana Vatika, located about four km from her residence in Karkhana’s Gruhalakshmi Colony, Secunderabad.\nThe silence was an arc of grief away from the inconsolable wailing that followed the news of Nanditha’s death in a road accident. The families of neighbours and party workers shared the grief after her body was shifted to her residence, an upper-middle class neighbourhood in Karkhana, from the Gandhi Hospital after an autopsy at around 11 a.m., almost six hours after her demise on the city outskirts in Patancheru.\nThrough the day, political leaders led by Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy offered floral tributes condolences at the residence of the MLA.\nEarlier, Former Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao along with other senior BRS leaders like Sabitha Indra Reddy visited the late SCB MLA Sayanna’s residence to pay homage to Nanditha. Mr Rao spoke to her mother, and elder sister Niveditha and consoled them. The family members wailed inconsolably when BRS MLC Kalvakuntla Kavitha reached the family home.\n“She always greeted me with a smile even if she did not necessarily have to,” said one of the women standing by the crowd outside her residence.\nAround afternoon, Chief Secretary A. Santhi Kumari issued orders and directed the Hyderabad District Collector and the Hyderabad Police Commissioner to make necessary arrangements in consultation with the family members.\nCOMMents\nSHARE\nCopy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

    "text": "A un año de su implementación, el programa de captación de agua de lluvia Nubes UDG de la Universidad de Guadalajara tiene 16 sedes intervenidas con este sistema de captación de agua de lluvia, mediante los cuales se captan 2 millones 200 mil litros de agua.\nSe trata de implementaciones instaladas en 3 mil 018 metros cuadrados de superficie, que beneficia a 57 mil alumnos de los planteles:\n- Centro Universitario de Tonalá (CUTonalá).\n- Centro Universitario de Ciencias Biológicas y Agropecuarias (\nCUCBA).\n- Centro Universitario de Ciencias Exactas e Ingenierías (\nCUCEI).\n- Preparatoria 6.\n- Preparatoria 18.\n- Preparatoria 19.\n- Preparatoria de Ciudad Guzmán.\n- Preparatoria de El Arenal.\n- Módulo San Agustín.\n- Módulo Concepción de Buenos Aires.\n- Módulo Atequiza.\n- Módulo Tolimán.\n- Módulo Matatlán.\n- Módulo San Miguel Huaixtita.\n- Módulo Ocota de la Sierra.\nEl profesor investigador del Departamento de Estudios del Agua y la Energía del\nCUTonalá, Jesús Barrera Rojas, mencionó que en dicho campus Nubes UDG apenas alberga 180 metros cuadrados (menos del 1 por ciento de la superficie del centro universitario), pero permite recabar 153 mil litros por temporada.\n“Para saber cuánta agua se quiere captar sólo se tendría que investigar cuál es la precipitación promedio en su localidad; aquí, el Área Metropolitana de Guadalajara (AMG) es de más o menos entre 850 y 1000 milímetros por temporada”.\n“Entonces, si tenemos un metro cuadrado de superficie para captación sólo multiplicamos ese metro cuadrado por los milímetros de agua y tendríamos los litros. Es decir, en un metro cuadrado tendríamos mil litros”, mencionó.\nEn el CUTonalá, además de captarla, utilizan el agua para el consumo humano; esto mediante un sistema extra de desinfección, de filtrado y absorción, y otro de desinfección mediante UV.\nBelkis Sulbarán Rangel, profesora investigadora del CUTonalá, recalcó que “la captación de agua de lluvia es una solución viable que se puede tener desde nuestros hogares- Esto no es nuevo, pues se usa desde hace siglos en diferentes partes del mundo y reduce la dependencia de fuentes externas y las inundaciones; incluso, pueden traer beneficios económicos con ahorros a largo plazo para empresas y hogares”.\nRecordó que en el AMG hay una dependencia excesiva de fuentes como el Lago de Chapala, y eso hace que “la gestión del agua dependa de las condiciones de lluvia de cada temporal”. Esa situación, añadió, se podría contrarrestar si en más terrenos de la ciudad se pudiera captar el agua.\nProponen que sistemas de captación se incluyan en desarrollos urbano\nBarrera Rojas indicó que es importante que este tipo de programas se difundan entre empresas y hogares para aprovechar la lluvia.\n“Hay políticas públicas que se deberían implementar, como el que las instalaciones de nuevos desarrollos habitacionales; zonas industriales o de servicios deben de contar dentro de sus planos con sistemas de captación de agua de lluvia, ya sea para contenerla, almacenarla o para la infiltración y recarga de los mantos acuíferos”, indicó.\nOtra de las opciones es la implementación de jardines de lluvia, que consiste en una depresión ajardinada para reconducir el agua superficial para infiltrarla y recargar el subsuelo; esto, dijeron, permitiría que se redujeran las inundaciones en zonas bajas de la ciudad.\nAída Lucía Fajardo Montiel, investigadora del CUTonalá, añadió que según la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) se requieren 100 litros de agua por día para satisfacer las necesidades humanas.\n“Pero hay que considerar que de este total de agua casi 80 por ciento se convertirá en agua residual, que podría ir a plantas de tratamiento y esto nos daría la oportunidad de tratarla, procesarla y volverla a utilizar. Esta acción también sería importante para el cuidado del recurso hídrico”, declaró.\nIndicaron que los mayores desafíos para implementar los sistemas de captación es la educación y concientización, pero también políticas de apoyo y mayores incentivos para que las personas los implementen de manera voluntaria. Reconocieron el avance del programa estatal de Nidos de Lluvia UDG.\nTambién se necesita que exista más infraestructura urbana para instalar los sistemas que implican planeaciones urbanas, ingeniería civil y sostenibilidad urbana. Otro problema, dijeron, es que los sistemas pueden representar una fuerte inversión por los costos iniciales; pero que al largo plazo los ahorros de agua serán significativos.",

De esta manera, en la modalidad A, dedicada a la \"Mejor iniciativa emprendedora desde centro no cooperativo\", el premio, dotado con 2.000 euros, ha sido para el IES La Melva de Elda en Alicante, por el proyecto \"Farmahogar\".\nEste proyecto propone la creación de una cooperativa social orientada a ofrecer servicios de atención farmacéutica y acompañamiento domiciliario a personas mayores, dependientes, con movilidad reducida o en situación de soledad. Esta necesidad se ha hecho aún más visible tras la pandemia del Covid y desastres naturales como la DANA, sufrida en la Comunidad Valenciana, dejando una huella emocional profunda, especialmente en las personas mayores, muchas de las cuales ahora sufren miedo a salir de casa o han perdido redes de apoyo.\nPor su parte, el colegio Mendiño, cooperativa de enseñanza gallega de Vigo en Pontevedra, ha obtenido el premio en la modalidad A, dedicada a la \"Mejor iniciativa emprendedora desde centro cooperativo\", por el proyecto \"Opportunity\", dotado con 2.000 euros. Este proyecto nace de la idea de proporcionar empleo, buscando conectar directamente la oferta y la demanda de trabajo en el sector pesquero, facilitando procesos de contratación justos y eficientes entre armadores y población migrante para cubrir la demanda en el sector pesquero de relevo generacional, y ofreciendo beneficios económicos, sociales y empresariales a la región.\nPor último, en la Modalidad B, dedicada al mejor \"Proyecto a través de cooperativa escolar\", dotado con 1.000 euros para la adquisición de material educativo o informático que favorezca la labor de los docentes y el desarrollo del alumnado de esta cooperativa educativa, el premio ha sido concedido al colegio Reina Sofia de Totana en Murcia, por el trabajo \"Abuelos 2.0\". El proyecto plantea la creación de una Cooperativa escolar cuyo objetivo es conectar a los jóvenes con los mayores a través de la tecnología para que no se queden atrás en el mundo digital, que se comuniquen mejor con su familia, que encuentren información útil en internet, que puedan realizar trámites online y que se diviertan con las cosas que ofrece la tecnología.\nAdemás de estos tres premiados, los miembros del jurado han acordado otorgar una Mención Especial en cada una de las modalidades a los proyectos \"Kilómetros de Salud\", realizado por el alumnado del Colegio Valle del Miro de Valdemoro en Madrid, y al \"Voluntariado Intergeneracional: Tú y yo\", del alumnado del Colegio Cipriano Galea de La Ñora en Murcia, por su calidad, por su valor educativo, originalidad y sostenibilidad social y económica.\nEl jurado ha estado constituido por responsables del Ministerio de Educación, Formación Profesional y Deportes; el Ministerio de Trabajo y Economía Social; CNMV; UCETAM; UECoE y Grupo Cooperativo Cajamar, quienes han tenido en cuenta la originalidad, viabilidad del proyecto, interés por la sostenibilidad, capacidad de implantación y cooperación, entre otras cualidades.\nEl objeto del concurso, en el que han participado estudiantes de ESO y FP en representación de centros educativos de todo el país, ha sido fomentar la cultura emprendedora entre los escolares, compartir los principios y valores que identifican al cooperativismo y a la economía social española, y dar visibilidad y reconocimiento a los proyectos que vienen desarrollando las cooperativas de enseñanza y el resto de los centros escolares para impulsar el espíritu empresarial.\nEl acto de entrega de los premios se celebrará en el Hotel Nelva de Murcia el próximo 27 de julio durante la celebración del Congreso \"Inteligencia Artificial, Salud Mental y Liderazgo: Retos de la Educación del Futuro\" que organiza UCOERM, acto conmemorativo de la Capitalidad española de la Economía Social 2025 Murcia, así como coincidiendo con el Año Internacional de las Cooperativas 2025.\nComparte la noticia\nCategorías de la noticia\nEPDA Podcast\nEntrevista a Fernando Darder\nFecha emisión: 18.01.2025\nCon Pere Valenciano\nComentarios en la noticia\nPara dejar su comentario debe acceder como usuario registrado\nEntrar con mi cuenta\nCrear cuenta\nOrden visualización de comentarios\nPrimero más reciente\nPrimero más valorado\nCargando comentarios de los lectores\nMás noticias\nEncuesta\nSe celebra el Día del Donante de Sangre esta semana ¿es usted es donante?\nSí, soy donante habitual\nSí, soy donante aunque de forma esporádica\nNo he sido donante aún, pero no me negaría a donar sangre llegado el momento\nNo, no quiero ser donante y no me siento cómodo con la idea\nVOTAR\nVER RESULTADOS\nComparte la noticia\n0\nEventos y digitales valencianos, S.L.
