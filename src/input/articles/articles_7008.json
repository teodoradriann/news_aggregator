    "text": "USC Football Recruiting: Trojans building an elite 2026 class\nAfter consecutive cycles ranked No. 15 or lower in the On3 Industry Football Team Recruiting Rankings, USC is looking to bounce back with what could become the best class of the Lincoln Riley era.\nAt the beginning of June, the Trojans hold the country’s No. 1 class and a whopping 28 commitments — nearly double what every other Power 4 program in the country has in their own classes. One checks in as a five-star, while 17 more check in as four-stars and another 10 check in as three-stars. And a number of those are on the cusp of attaining blue-chip status.\nUSC has seen a few departures from the group, notable five-star linebacker Xavier Griffin, who opted to decommit last month. He was one of two early five-star commits, along Rancho Cucamonga (Calif.) CB RJ Sermons, who joined the class on Dec. 13. He opted to graduate early and reclassify up a year to USC’s 2025 class on May 23.\nIt didn’t take Riley and Co. long to find another elite prospect though, as five-star tight end Mark Bowman pledged to the Trojans exactly a week later. He joins a group headlined by top-100 quarterback Jonas Williams, who USC flipped away from rival Oregon. They also poached four-star defensive lineman Tomuhini Topui from the Ducks, as well as beating them out for elite offensive tackle Keenyi Pepe.\nIn total, more than half of the Trojans’ class hails from the Golden State (63%), and 63% of current commits are blue-chip prospects in the On3 Industry Ranking. Alongside Bowman, Pepe, and Williams, USC has top-100 commitments from CB Elbert Hill (No. 39), EDGE Simote Katoanga (No. 65), CB Brandon Lockhart (No. 71), and DL Jaimeon Winfield (No. 95).\nTrojans commitments by position\nQuarterback\nFour-star Jonas Williams, No. 89 NATL.

    "text": "Sports\nCaitlin Clark’s Video With New Teammate is Turning Heads\nThe WNBA is just two months away from the start of its 2025 season, so naturally, teams and their players are starting to get back to work. The Indiana Fever are no exception, especially since they brought in a lot of new faces to improve their roster.\nWhat turned a lot of heads on Wednesday, however, was the Fever's latest post featuring their new player in Brianna Turner and second-year guard Caitlin Clark.\nAfter officially introducing Turner as a member of the Fever, the defensive star apparently had a workout with Clark.\nThe Fever shared a video showing some of the highlights from their practice session together, including Clark dishing out a perfect assist to Turner for a layup.\nSure enough, fans loved how the two quickly got to work. The video also further intensified the excitement that fans feel for the new season.\n\"Oh yes we getting that [ship] this season! Go Fever!\" a commenter wrote. Another one said, \"Omg someone is actually setting a pick for CC?? Yall … it's over for the league.\"\nA fan added, \"Awesome happy to see Caitlin.\"\n\"Lab work. Turner is much more athletic then we think. Girl can block shots! And very nice catching ally ooooops,\" a commenter shared.\nA fifth supporter claimed, \"We winning it all this year.\"\n\"Let's go! So pump can't wait to have everyone back in Indy,\" a follower excitedly said.\nWNBA training camp begins on April 27, while the 2025 regular season kicks off on May 16. With that said, the wait shouldn't be too long for Fever fans to see Caitlin Clark work fully with her new teammates.\nAside from Turner, the Fever also added Sydney Colson, Natasha Howard, DeWanna Bonner, Jaelyn Brown and Sophie Cunningham this offseason.\nIndeed, it will be interesting to see Clark play with her new teammates and how the Fever's improved roster will help the team.\nRelated: New ‘Insane' Caitlin Clark Stat Has WNBA Fans at Each Other's Throats\nCopyright 2025 The Arena Group, Inc.
