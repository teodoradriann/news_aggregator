    "text": "Son nom est Leevi Merilainen. Le jeune portier de 22 ans est tout simplement intraitable depuis son rappel dans la Ligue nationale de hockey (LNH). «Il s’est vraiment bien adapté à la vitesse du jeu, surtout lors de ses trois derniers matchs. Il a l’air tellement calme et confiant devant son filet», a confié l’entraîneur-chef Travis Green.\nLa recrue affiche un dossier de cinq victoires et deux revers en sept rencontres cette saison. Ses statistiques personnelles sont tout aussi étincelantes avec une moyenne de buts alloués de 1,99 et un pourcentage d’arrêts de ,925.\n«Il tout simplement génial, a affirmé l’attaquant Drake Batherson. C’est un gars assez détendu, surtout pour un jeune gardien de but qui arrive. C’est aussi de cette façon qu’il joue. Même avant les matchs, il est assez calme. C’est un gardien spécial et il joue incroyablement bien.»\nLors de ses trois derniers départs, le Finlandais s’est surpassé. Il n’a accordé que deux buts aux puissants Stars de Dallas en plus de blanchir les Islanders de New York et les Penguins de Pittsburgh. Ottawa est d’ailleurs l'équipe qui a signé le plus de blanchissage cette saison avec sept.\n«Il est vraiment impressionnant. Son calme et sa confiance en lui, c’est vraiment agréable à voir. À seulement 22 ans, je n’ai jamais vu un gardien jouer de cette manière», a expliqué l’attaquant Shane Pinto.\nMerilainen respire la confiance actuellement. Celle-ci semble inébranlable, mais également contagieuse alors que ses coéquipiers jouent sans complexe devant lui.\n«Il ne parle pas beaucoup, mais je pense qu’il est tout simplement extrêmement mature. Pendant le match, tu le sais que même si un but est encaissé, il arrive à se ressaisir très rapidement. Je pense que c’est important pour un gardien de but. C’est vraiment impressionnant ce qu’il fait présentement», a mentionné Pinto.\nDes nouvelles en rafales\nAprès avoir reçu une rondelle au visage lors du dernier match, Thomas Chabot s’absentera pour la rencontre de jeudi soir face aux Capitals de Washington. Fraîchement rappelé des Senators de Belleville, l’Ottavien Donovan Sebrango effectuera ses débuts dans la LNH dans sa ville natale.\n«C’est exactement ce à quoi je rêvais en grandissant de jouer mon premier match à Ottawa, a souligné le défenseur de 23 ans. Je n’ai pas encore pris totalement conscience de ce qui va se dérouler ce soir. J’ai travaillé toute ma vie pour arriver à ce moment. Je suis excité de vivre cette expérience avec ma famille et mes coéquipiers.»\nL’attaquant Michael Amadio sera de retour dans la formation, lui qui est absent depuis le 21 décembre dernier en raison d’une blessure.\nDans le cas du Québécois David Perron, il s’approche tranquillement d’un retour au jeu. Le vétéran de 36 ans a été limité à seulement neuf rencontres cette saison.",

A new, rediscovered track from the late Tina Turner has made its public debut.\n\"Hot For You Baby,\" a previously unheard and unreleased song from the R&B and soul singer-turned rock star's vault, along with an array of other never-before-released tracks, live performances, and footage will appear on the 40th Anniversary Edition of \"Private Dancer,\" Turner's fifth studio album.\nThe track \"was thought to be lost to time, but this thrilling discovery introduces a fresh chapter in the 'Private Dancer' story,\" according to a Thursday announcement from Parlophone Records.\n\"Hot For You Baby\" was recorded and was initially set to appear on the 1984 record. That album, \"Private Dancer,\" marked Turner's mid-career comeback after she fled an abusive relationship with her musical mentor and first husband, Ike Turner.\nADVERTISEMENT The May 1984 album was recorded in two weeks and went on to become a huge commercial success despite her label's reluctancy to promote her music. “What’s Love Got to Do With It,\" a track from \"Private Dancer\" was Turner's only No. 1 single.\nThat song earned a record of the year Grammy Award and Turner the status of being the (then) oldest woman to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 chart .\nThe re-release of \"Private Dancer,\" due March 21, comes nearly two years after Turner's death.\nTina Turner's 'Hot For You Baby:' Listen below \"Hot For You Baby\" made its on-air debut Thursday on BBC's Radio 2 Breakfast Show at 8:50 a.m. local time. The track, according to BBC is a \" prime example of Turner's raspy, physical style of soul.\"\nThe song had previously been recorded and released by Australian singer John Paul Young (the voice behind disco classic \"Love Is In The Air'), but his version of the song wasn't a hit, per BBC.\nADVERTISEMENT The 40th Anniversary Edition of \"Private Dancer\" will be available in multiple configurations: a 5-CD/Blu-ray set, 2-CD, a 1-LP Pearl vinyl, and a 1-LP picture disc (all available for pre-order here ).\nThe 5-CD/Blu-ray set will feature live performances from a two-night stint at NEC Birmingham, where David Bowie and Bryan Adams performed with Turner, and five upgraded \"Private Dancer\" music videos. Other exclusive content will be available in other formats.\nContributing: Melissa Ruggieri, USA TODAY\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: New, unreleased Tina Turner song makes debut: 'Hot For You Baby'",

    "title": "Tips & Outfit Ideas for Women Embracing Their Beauty at Every Stage - Must-Know Fashion Secrets",
    "text": "Photos of 13 Celebrity Houses & Neighborhoods Burned to the Ground by LA Wildfires\nJanuary 09, 2025\nFor years, mainstream fashion has often catered to younger generations, leaving fewer style inspirations for women over 50. Now, a new wave of influencers proves that confidence, not age, defines great style. Their approach focuses on practical wardrobe choices, bold fashion statements, and the freedom to dress without limitations.\nFashion advice for women over 50 has traditionally emphasized dressing appropriately rather than encouraging individuality. However, a growing number of women are now embracing fashion as a means of self-expression, opting for outfits that make them feel confident and empowered.\nLeading this movement are influencers like Grece Ghanem, Ting Ma, and Gym Tan. Through their social media platforms, they offer practical fashion tips, essential wardrobe staples, and innovative styling techniques that challenge outdated norms and celebrate personal style.\nFashion has no expiration date, and several women are proving that confidence and personal expression matter more than age. Among them, Ghanem, Ma, and Tan have gained widespread recognition for their fresh approach to style.\nThrough social media, they challenge outdated fashion rules and offer practical insights on how to dress with confidence at any stage of life.\nGhanem, a 60-year-old content creator based in Montreal, Canada, originally worked as a microbiologist before transitioning into personal training. Over time, her bold and colorful fashion choices gained attention, making her a sought-after style icon.\nMa is a 50-something TikToker with a rapidly growing audience. With over 219,000 Instagram followers, she shares outfit transformations that challenge traditional ideas of how women over 50 should dress.\nTan, a style influencer in her 60s, takes a more minimal yet polished approach to fashion. With over 317,000 Instagram followers, she prioritizes clean lines, structured silhouettes, and comfort without sacrificing style.\nEach of these women brings a unique perspective to fashion, proving that style isn’t about looking younger—it's about dressing in a way that feels authentic. Their insights provide valuable guidance for anyone looking to refine their wardrobe and embrace fashion with confidence.\nFor Ghanem, Ma, and Tan, style isn't about following trends—it's about confidence. They don't follow rules that dictate what women should or shouldn't wear past a certain age. Instead, they dress in a way that reflects their personalities and makes them feel their best.\nMa rejects the idea that age should determine wardrobe choices. \"I dress however, whenever, and in whatever I want. Never let anyone dictate how you should dress,\" she says. She focuses on pieces that complement her body, rather than dressing to meet expectations.\n\"If I’m spending money on clothes, they need to please me first,\" she writes. \"No designer clothes,[..] can make you more beautiful than self-love and acceptance. This is the key thing we often overlook.\"\nGhanem approaches fashion with the same mindset, emphasizing that getting dressed should be a positive experience. \"Styling should be joyful. It should add an extra layer of happiness,\" she explains.\nTan shares a similar perspective, writing, \"Getting dressed should be easy, enjoyable, and a celebration of YOU no matter your age!\" Their approach highlights a simple truth—style is not about fitting into a category but about choosing clothing that makes you feel confident and comfortable.\nA well-curated wardrobe starts with timeless, well-fitting pieces that can be styled effortlessly. Each of these three women emphasizes the importance of investing in clothing that feels good, fits well, and works for different occasions.\nFor Ghanem, denim is a non-negotiable. \"The perfect pair of denim trousers. The ones that make you feel confident and that you can throw on with anything,\" she says. She still owns a pair of Levi's jeans from her 20s, proving that a great fit never goes out of style.\nMa focuses on structure and proportion, favoring high-waisted trousers, tailored blazers, and fitted tops that complement her shape. Rather than following trends, she chooses pieces that highlight her features.\nTan, known for her polished yet practical looks, gravitates toward structured pieces. \"My approach to style over 60 is simple, direct, effortless, and one that allows for an ease in movement,\" she shares.\nThese essentials provide a strong foundation for any wardrobe, making it easier to create stylish, comfortable outfits that reflect personal style.\nFor years, society has promoted a narrow idea of how women over 50 should dress—favoring muted colors, loose silhouettes, and conservative styles. Ghanem, Ma, and Tan reject these outdated notions.\nThrough social media, they challenge expectations by showcasing outfits that reflect their personalities rather than conforming to traditional norms. Ma frequently addresses these stereotypes in her viral videos.\nIn one TikTok clip, she appears in a conservative outfit. The clip starts with her in an oversized black shirt, dark gray sweatpants, and glasses, her hair appearing brittle and unstyled. Over the footage, she writes, \"What some people think women over 50 should look like.\"\nShe then transitions into a polished and stylish outfit—an off-the-shoulder white peplum top with black stripes, a white above-the-knee skirt, and floral black heels.\nHer hair is styled in an elegant updo, and she accessorizes with earrings and a necklace, with an overlay text that reads, \"Think again!\" The final caption says, This is me at 53! Fashion knows no age.\"\nIn the post description, she explains how outdated stereotypes fail to represent the vibrance and diversity of modern women over 50, emphasizing self-care, confidence, and embracing one's individuality. \"Time to redefine aging on our terms,\" she writes.\nRather than dressing to appear younger, Ma focuses on wearing pieces that suit her body and reflect her style.\nTan also challenges age-based fashion norms in her content. In a TikTok video from April 2022, she first appears in a simple black long-sleeved shirt and glasses, with her hair down and unstyled.\nOver the clip, she writes, \"What people expect me to look like and wear in my 60s.\" The video then cuts to her in a fitted, shimmering black dress, accessorized with earrings and a sleek hairstyle.\nShe expands on this perspective in a separate Instagram post from November 2023, where she shares a montage of her outfits. In the caption, she describes her approach to fashion as effortless yet intentional.\nAs someone who leads an active lifestyle, she gravitates toward structured, classic pieces that don't overwhelm her petite frame. She also enjoys adding personality through pops of color, statement jewelry, and unexpected combinations.\n\"I run, walk fast, like to get things done, and talk with my hands, so ease and comfort are key!\" it reads.\n\"Lastly, I enjoy the creative process of getting dressed and just showing up and challenging the norms and expectations of 'dressing my age,'\" she concludes.\nGhanem also encourages women to step outside their comfort zones. \"You have to try things. You can't judge a piece by the color or what it looks like on the hanger,\" she says. Her wardrobe is a mix of classic tailoring and unexpected statement pieces.\nThrough their fashion choices, these women continue to prove that age is not a style limitation—it's an opportunity to embrace individuality.",

    "text": "Eileen Esther Molina Fernández | Foto: Juan Pablo Carreras 78 23 Julio 2025 23 Julio 2025 Publicado recientemente Holguín, 23 jul (ACN) Con un variado programa de actividades, el Hospital Docente Gustavo Aldereguía Lima, en el municipio holguinero de Gibara, celebrará este 26 de julio el 65 aniversario de su fundación. Susana Pérez Serviño, especialista de primer grado en Ginecología y Obstetricia y directora de la institución, señaló a la ACN que durante la jornada se reconoció a fundadores, se realizaron sesiones de bailoterapia, encuentros con pacientes oncológicos, trabajos voluntarios, y se priorizó la prestación de servicios de calidad a la población. Destacó que uno de los momentos más significativos fue la plantación de 65 árboles de caoba en las áreas exteriores, iniciativa en la que participaron trabajadores, personalidades de la localidad costera, jubilados y jóvenes en formación en el propio centro. Además, resaltó los avances logrados en la terminación del cuerpo de guardia y las áreas de consulta y laboratorio de la nueva sede, una de las principales inversiones de la Dirección General de Salud, que ofrece mayor confort y amplitud para la atención médica. Aunque la hospitalización aún se mantiene en la antigua sede, ubicada en las zonas bajas de la cabecera municipal y próxima al malecón, la institución perfecciona la formación docente de su personal y ha aumentado las consultas externas de especialidades. Entre los resultados destacados en la conmemoración del aniversario figuran la asistencia a las zonas rurales y de difícil acceso, mediante las evaluaciones de proyección comunitaria, así como los logros del Programa de Atención Materno Infantil. El centro médico, fundado por José Ramón Machado Ventura el 26 de julio de 1960, contaba inicialmente con cinco servicios; en la actualidad, los pacientes reciben tratamiento en 42 especialidades y prevé continuar ampliando las prestaciones mediante la recuperación del salón de partos y la expansión de capacidades para el seguimiento a embarazadas de alto riesgo.",

    "text": "How Katherine Heigl spends her 5 to 9 — from raising teens to maintaining her 100-day Peloton streak\nKatherine Heigl thinks a strongly worded letter should be sent to whoever's responsible for moms experiencing perimenopause while parenting teens.\nThe Emmy-award winning actor, best known for her roles in \"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"27 Dresses,\" and \"Firefly Lane,\" has three children with her husband Josh Kelley: two daughters, Naleigh, 15, and Adalaide, 13, as well as a son, Joshua, 8.\nHeigl, 46, told Business Insider that everyone's hormones changing at once is \"really difficult,\" but she prioritizes her and her kids' physical and mental health as best she can, even if it sometimes means making the same \"kid-friendly\" dinners on repeat.\nSpeaking to BI to promote the dog food brand she founded, Badlands Ranch, in the latest installment of our \"5-9\" series, Heigl shared how she spends her days in her rural Utah home. She also detailed how she's relearning her body during perimenopause and how she's changed her relationship with exercise for the better.\nCoffee and chilling with her dogs\nOn an average day, what time do you get up, and what's your morning routine?\nTypically, I'm up around 8 a.m. or 8:30 a.m., and the first thing I do is let my little dog sleep in bed with me. Then we all come down, the dogs go out, then they get their breakfast, I make a cup of coffee, and then we just sit in our little sitting room off the kitchen.\nI either journal, read, or sometimes scroll, but typically, I give myself an hour to just sit, have a cup of coffee, and chill with the dogs before I get going — whether working or working out.\nComing down to see your dogs in the morning is the best because they're so excited.\nYou can leave the room for two minutes and come back, and they're equally as excited.\nSo right. So what do you have for breakfast most days?\nI just cannot make myself eat until about noon. So it's just a cup or two of coffee, and that's it until lunch.\nI love food — I'm a total foodie — but I have no patience to make it for myself. So I typically will just throw a smoothie together really quickly, and that will be that until dinner.\nI used to really love to cook, and I used to cook a lot, but now, I live in the mountains of Utah. We can't even get a pizza delivered. When you're forced to cook every day, come up with meals, and figure it out every day, I'm so over it now.\nI have not been a great mom in that way lately. I've been like, \"Hey, guys, let's just have ramen.\" So I'm giving myself a break, but I'll get back to it, I'm sure.\nI'm sure your kids aren't complaining. Are they fussy eaters?\nMy oldest daughter, Naleigh, she'll eat anything. She and I have very similar tastes — we both really like spicy food, we love Indian food. My other two are fussy, yes.\nI had a work trip to Vegas recently and decided to take the whole family. We had some beautiful dinners and lunches, and I was shocked: My son ordered a white truffle pizza.\nI didn't think he'd like it, but he looked at me and said, \"Really good food makes me feel like I'm floating.\"\nSo I'm hoping he'll be a bit more adventurous. I get really sick of making the same kid-friendly dishes all the time.\nWorking out for mental health\nYou mentioned you sometimes exercise in the morning. What does movement look like for you? Dog walking?\nActually, no. I live on 20 acres of land, so they are very happy roaming and running around the yard. I used to do quite a bit more hiking: Where I live is on a paved road, 7,000 feet up, so it's all uphill.\nI got us a Peloton a few years ago. I didn't realise they have everything from strength training to yoga to meditation to stretching classes. So I do no less than three days a week. Right now, I'm really proud of myself because I'm on a 100-week streak.\nThat's amazing.\nIt's probably the first time in my life I've ever made that kind of commitment to exercise. About three years ago, I changed my perspective — instead of it being about beating my body into submission because I wasn't happy with my body, I made it about my mental health and feeling better.\nOnce I shifted to thinking about how exercise can help me go about the rest of my day in a better, more energized way, it became way less of a chore. Exercise used to be something I hated and had to talk myself into, but now I look forward to it because it does make me feel better. I just feel healthier inside my head.\nIt's such a refreshing shift to make, but it's also hard to do, especially for women, because for so long, we've been told to exercise to shrink ourselves.\nYes, and it's something I really try to teach my daughters now. It's not about changing the way you look, it's about changing the way you feel. And if you can approach it from that place, it's less of a challenge to get yourself to do it and to have that self-discipline. I do have to make them, though.\nWell, they're teenagers aren't they? So, that's tricky.\nYeah. Send help, please.\nPerimenopause and holistic health\nSo you have eight dogs?\nYes, we were down to five, but then we adopted three new puppies. I think my husband wants me to stop, but I say to my family: \"Listen, I do a lot for you guys and the dogs bring me so much joy, happiness, and comfort, so your help with these dogs is really about helping and supporting me so I can do the same for you.\"\nI'm going to use that argument.\nIt really works. Who can argue with that? You don't want me to have comfort or peace or joy? You can't say that. That's horrible.\nGenius.\nCaring for our dogs and all dogs is so important to me. That's why I wanted to work with the team creating Badlands Ranch dog food. It aligns with my passion for holistic health — we're all learning more and more how important our digestive health is, and if we keep that healthy, how much of the rest of our system functions better and healthier. It's the same for dogs.\nWhat other lifestyle essentials do you have to keep yourself healthy and happy?\nI have had to learn to really make my mental health a priority and recognize the triggers when stress gets too much. Every year I get older, I've learned how to better manage and not necessarily predict, but notice those triggers before it goes too far.\nMeditation has become really important. I do not do it nearly enough, but I try to do it at least three days a week. That has helped me a lot just with clarity, purpose, and perspective.\nWith three kids and obviously a house full of pets, of course, there's stress, and things are going to come up. But to be able to take a step back, give yourself even just an hour a day to approach everything calmly, has made a huge difference to my health, my mentality, and even just ensuring I get a better night's sleep, which then ensures that my body and mind and everything functions better the next day.\nI know you've spoken about perimenopause before.\nYeah. Whoever designed it so that women would be going through perimenopause while raising teenagers should be sent a strongly worded letter.\nIt's really difficult. Their hormones are all over the place, they're trying to adapt and get used to their new bodies and their new ways of thinking, and I am too. So the only thing I can do is look at them and go, \"Well, at least we're in it together.\"\nI just started researching something called Eight Sleep — it goes over your mattress to keep the bed cool at night. The number of nights that I wake up so hot and drenched in sweat. The good news is that I live in Utah, and nine months out of the year, it's freezing, so I can just step outside and cool off.\nPerimenopause is like having to relearn your whole system and body again. I feel like it happens almost every 10 years. In my 20s, my hormones were crazy and tumultuous, and I was trying to figure myself out. And then I had 10 years in my 30s where I had a good handle on it all, and then it all started shifting and changing again at about 40. Great.\nJust endless changes, that's exhausting.\nGet used to it.\nHow do you wind down to give yourself the best chance of a good sleep?\nThere are nights where we'll watch a show — my husband and I have gotten really into \"Succession,\" but I prefer to read for an hour before actually putting my head on the pillow.\nIf I scroll for too long at night or in bed, it really messes with my circadian rhythm. It just makes sleep really restless, and I think the blue light and onslaught of sensory overload is a thing. So we all put our phones down a good hour before bed.\nRead the original article on Business Insider",
