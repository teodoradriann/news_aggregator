    "title": "#22 Cómo perder la alcaldía de Pamplona y la reputación en una sola frase",
    "text": "[Osdransky](/user/Osdransky)a [eldiario.es](/go/link/3891544)\nLa plaza consistorial de Pamplona parece sanfermines en esta moción pero el PP sigue sin entender absolutamente nada!!!!\nIdos a tomar por culo!!!!!!!\n[#1](c1#c-1) llevan así desde la recogida de firmas para derogar el estatut catalán. Pero que sigan, que sigan.\n[#10](c10#c-10) y eso que allí ponen todos los impedimentos posibles para que la gente no vote (sobre todo los grupos poblacionales que no suelen votar a los republicanos).\n[#1](c1#c-1) Positivo por el elefante uso del imperativo del verbo ir con el enclético \"os\". Aunque la real academia admite desde hace años \"iros\" y todos recordamos con cariño aquel \"si me queréis, irse\" de la gran Lola no es menos cierto que \"Idos a tomar por culo\" destila elegancia, clasicismo, ritmo, gracia y donaire en cada sílaba.\n[#9](c9#c-9) No hay ningún clasismo, todo lo contrario, está reconociendo la dureza de ese trabajo y el mérito que tiene hacerlo.\nEs como si dijera \"preferiría trabajar en la mina\". Se refiere a la dureza del trabajo.\nNo va a decir \"preferiría trabajar como CEO de un eléctrica\", lo cual no suena a trabajo físico duro.\nNingún clasismo, pero lo dice elpanfleto.es, manipulando, y os lo tragáis todo sin masticar. Qué pena. Un poquito de capacidad crítica no os vendría mal, deberíais intentarlo, aunque os cueste, debido a que hay que pensar y eso no es fácil para vosotros. Es más fácil formar parte del rebaño.\nCreo que les ha retratado muy bien. Estoy un poco cansado de eldiario pero este artículo es bastante adecuado.\n[#0](c0#c-0) gracias\n[#2](c2#c-2) Tranquilo, tienen todo el escudo mediático. No lo verás en el telediario de A3, salvo que esa misma frase la hubiera dicho una alcaldesa del PSOE o de SUMAR.\n[#5](c5#c-5) Al hilo de lo que dices, hoy he visto las noticias de la noche de A·, con Vicente Vallés, y, en algún momento creía que le iba a dar un infarto: los independentistas, Bildu, traición del PSOE, traición de Sánchez y así así... Uno, si sigue escuchando cree que va a llegar el final de la democracia y el apocalipsis, como mínimo.\n[#6](c6#c-6) es indecente lo de ese señor... verlo vomitar bilis de esa manera, da muchisima grima, no se como no le aconseja alguien que se modere un poco\n[#14](c14#c-14) ¿Que se modere?\n¡Le pagan y muy bien por eso!\nY le sacan en El Hormiguero cada vez que escribe un libro.\nNo conoces a los Lara, los del Planeta, ni a Mauricio su jefe directo.\nA mí el que me hace gracia es Feijó diciendo que el PSOE ya no es un partido constitucionalista.\nPues no sé, creo que debió quedarse dormido en el artículo 1 porque en el 140 ya te dice de forma general cómo se eligen los concejales y como son éstos los que eligen a un alcalde.\nEn fin, que habrá quien le compre el discurso, pero no hay por donde cogerlo",

The Oscar-winning actress, who has been open about her love of animals, recently recalled that she volunteered with the ASPCA during the 2001 tragedy. “People would go over to the piers over on West Street, and they would say, ‘My dog Simpson, or my goldfish or my rabbit,’ or whatever it is, and they’d say, ‘This is my address, this is my apartment,’ and I’d get these cards and we’d go down,” Swank said during an appearance on the [Literally! With Rob Lowe](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hilary-swank-no-gurus-on-set/id1510058141?i=1000647484941) podcast. Related Stories The Million Dollar Baby star told Lowe that while there were many challenges and obstacles, including no working elevators, no technology and building stability risks, that didn’t stop them from saving these animals. “If their animal was on the 50th floor, you were walking up to the 50th floor,” she said. “And we’d get up there and we brought cats down, we brought turtles down, we brought fish down, we brought lots of dogs. I think a couple hamsters.” Swank added, “But I mean, these apartment buildings, they were missing windows, and the trauma that these animals went through living there for, you know, some a few days and some a few weeks.” The host also brought up a particular 9/11 rescue story that Swank previously shared with him regarding a “terrified” cat. “It was going crazy,” the Ordinary Angels actress said. “It was missing its person. Who knows how long it didn’t have food? The front windows were blown out. It was smoky. It was dirty. It was dangerous. … It kept getting out of a blanket, so we finally figured out how to put it in a pillowcase, knew it could still breathe through it, got them back to their owners.” Swank noted that she had volunteered at the ASPCA before 9/11 but helping to reconnect these pets with their families will always hold a special place in her heart. “Reuniting these animals with their owners was such a gift,” she added. “They were just so happy.” THR Newsletters Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day [Subscribe Sign Up](https://cloud.email.hollywoodreporter.com/signup/)",

    "text": "DeSantis slams Haley for Civil War gaffe but faces tough questions on slavery's legacy ANKENY, Iowa — Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis slammed opponent Nikki Haley for giving \"a really incomprehensible word salad\" answer when she was asked in [New Hampshire what caused the Civil War.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/12/28/nikki-haley-slavery-civil-war/72046352007/) During a Wednesday town hall in Berlin, New Hampshire, a voter asked Haley, “What was the cause of the United States Civil War?” “Well, don’t come with an easy question or anything,\" Haley responded. \"I mean, I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how the government was going to run. The freedoms and what people could and couldn’t do.” Haley never mentioned slavery in her answer, drawing backlash from her Republican and Democratic rivals. On Thursday, Haley said \"of course the Civil War was about slavery,\" and she [suggested the question came from a Democratic plant in the audience.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/12/28/nikki-haley-defends-civil-war-answer-blames-democratic-plant/72048362007/) DeSantis was quick to criticize Haley at an Ankeny campaign stop Thursday morning. He told reporters she is \"not a candidate that's ready for prime time.\" \"The minute that she faces any kind of scrutiny, she tends to cave,\" DeSantis said. \"I think that that's what you saw yesterday. Not that difficult to identify and acknowledge the role slavery played in the Civil War, and yet that seemed to be something that was really difficult.\" DeSantis claimed the abolition of slavery was a \"partisan achievement.\" \"The Republican Party was founded to put a stop to the growth of slavery in this country. And the abolition of slavery was — and to this day, remains — the party's top achievement,\" he said. But DeSantis faced his own gauntlet of questions about slavery and the legacy of the Civil War. A reporter asked about a curriculum standard approved in Florida that \"includes how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.\" The language earned Florida and DeSantis scorn, including from U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, who at the time was a presidential candidate before later dropping out. DeSantis cut off the reporter's question about the standard: \"That's a fake narrative,\" he said. \"We've now had a whole semester that's happened. Have you seen examples of (teachers) saying what the media was saying this summer? No.\" DeSantis said the standard was \"bastardized\" intentionally to \"create a narrative.\" \"Florida's standards were written largely by African-Americans, and they were accurate, and any of those narratives are false,\" he said. Another reporter asked DeSantis to comment on Jacksonville, Florida, Mayor Donna Deegan's removal of a Confederate monument. \"I'm opposed to taking down statues,\" DeSantis said. \"The idea that we're going to just erase history is wrong.\" USA Today contributed reporting.

    "text": "Singapore has lauded India's historic signing of a peace accord with the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA), saying that it will significantly enhance foreign investments from Singapore in the Northeast region.The Centre, Assam government and ULFA on Friday signed the long-elusive tripartite peace accord in New Delhi on Friday, leaving just one separatist group, ULFA's anti-talk faction, ULFA (Independent) outside the peace process.Expressing his appreciation for the tripartite peace pact between ULFA, the Centre and the Assam government, Singapore High Commissioner to India, Simon Won took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) and said, \\\"We are happy to see the historic tripartite peace pact signed amongst ULFA, GOI and the Govt of Assam. This will anchor peace in the region and give a big boost to foreign investors like Singapore to move into the Northeast.\\\" We are happy to see the historic tripartite peace pact signed amongst ULFA, GOI and the Govt of Assam. This will anchor peace in the region and give a big boost to foreign investors like Singapore to move into the Northeast. - HC Wong @PMOIndia @CMOfficeAssam @HMOIndia https://t.co/u0QuyPRXvH— Singapore in India (@SGinIndia) December 30, 2023 ]]>The Singapore envoy's comments came as a reply to the post of Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who had called it a \\\"historic day\\\" and said that this step is in the direction of lasting peace and progress in Assam.Himanta Biswa Sarma said, \\\" Guided by the sterling vision and blessings of PM Modi, efforts for lasting peace and progress in Assam received a historic impetus today. The Memorandum of Settlement, signed under the guidance of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, stands out for many reasons.\\\" CM Saram further said that the agreement draws the curtains on Assam’s “oldest armed resistance pursued by ULFA, protects the interests of our people and paves way for spurring growth in the region”.Calling it a special day for ‘Bharat’, Sarma further added that those who were once associated with violence will become partners in the nation’s progress. “For an entire generation, the insurgency had stymied the potential of Assam. The single-minded pursuit of inclusive development by Hon’ble PM since 2014 has resulted in today’s transformative achievement which marks a new dawn of harmony and togetherness,” he stated.ULFA Signs Landmark Peace Deal With Centre And AssamA 29-member delegation of the ULFA’s pro-talks delegation, including 16 ULFA members and 13 from civil society, signed the agreement on Friday. This a significant pact as the banned ULFA-Independent has been the only major insurgent outfit in the state after the ULFA pro-talks faction signed the agreement with the Centre and Assam government.The separatist ULFA was formed in April 1979 in the aftermath of an agitation against undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan).It split into two groups in February 2011 with the Arabinda Rajkhowa-led faction giving up violence and agreeing to unconditional talks with the government. Paresh Baruah, who leads the other rebranded ULFA-Independent faction, is against the talks.The pro-talks faction has sought constitutional and political reforms for the protection of the identity and resources of Assam’s indigenous people including their right to land. The Union government in April sent it a draft agreement. An earlier round of talks between the two sides was held in Delhi in August.Notably, the BJP-led Centre has signed peace deals with rebel Bodo, Dimasa, Karbi, and Adivasi outfits in Assam over the last three years.Meanwhile, Union Home Minister Amit Shah has assured the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) pro-talks faction of time-bound implementation of the agreement that was signed.

This is the first kids' area at the airport post-security.\nThe play area is a free STEM themed zone with interactive learning activities.\nchildren's discovery lab TUL\nchildren's discovery lab TUL\nchildren's discovery lab TUL\nFOX23 attended the ribbon-cutting and spoke with airport and Discovery Lab representatives.\n\"Discovery Lab is excited to partner with Tulsa International Airport to bring a learning experience for families while they're waiting to make their connections or make their flights,\" said Ray Vandiver, executive director of Discovery Lab. \"Our exhibit designers have chosen a group of experiences that represent the style of learning that happens at Discovery Lab. So it's action-based learning, you learn by doing, full body, minds on.\nRay said the activities are designed to engage children's brains.\n\"You navigate through a vertical maze, it's physical, mental, there's a human circuit where you're the wires connecting the power supply to appliances,\" Ray said. \"So it's about playful learning, it's about science, technology, engineering and math learning, and it's all happening at the airport.\"\nFOX23 spoke with airport representatives, who said the play area is opening at the perfect time for travelers and their kids.\n\"We are expecting 114,000 passengers to pass through this airport during spring break,\" said Stephanie Chester, director of marketing and community relations for TUL. \"Our goal was to have this completed by spring break, we met our goal, we're super excited that the families that are traveling over the next week will have a place for their kiddos to burn some energy before they board their flight.\"\nStephanie said the play area's purpose is to not only provide an educational experience for kids but to improve the customer experience of parents as well.\n\"As a mother of two, something I always look for is what can my kiddos do before they board a flight where they have to remain still for an hour, two hours, three hours,\" Stephanie said. \"Being able to have this here for them is something that was a top priority for us.\"\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Bloomberg — La tasa de muertes violentas en Venezuela descendió a su nivel más bajo en más de dos décadas después de años de migración masiva, tanto de criminales como de víctimas que huyeron de la crisis económica del país. El Observatorio de Violencia en Venezuela registró 26,8 muertes violentas por cada 100.000 habitantes este año, en comparación con una tasa de 35,3 por cada 100.000 habitantes en 2022, según Roberto Briceño León, director del observatorio, en una transmisión web el jueves. Esta cifra es la más baja desde 2001 y representa un tercio de lo que era en 2016. Los jóvenes, que tradicionalmente han sido las principales víctimas de la violencia, se han ido del país, mientras que los criminales y las pandillas han emigrado debido a la falta de oportunidades para cometer delitos, según Briceño León. Aunque las muertes violentas en el mundo han aumentado debido a las guerras, en la mayoría de los países de América Latina la tendencia ha sido una reducción en las tasas de homicidios, comentó. La tasa de Venezuela en 2023 sigue siendo alta y solo es superada en la región por Ecuador y Honduras. Otros datos del observatorio: - La percepción de seguridad de los venezolanos es mayor. - La tasa de suicidios aumentó a 8.2 por cada 100,000 habitantes, en comparación con 6.5 del año pasado, en medio de la crisis económica y humanitaria que enfrenta Venezuela desde hace años.
