The Mother See issued a statement in this regard.\n\"With deep concern, we learned about the ongoing provocative actions around the ‘Cows’ Garden’ estate belonging to the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem.\n\"On December 28, more than three dozen armed persons invaded the territory of the ‘Cows’ Garden,’ carried out violent actions, as a result of which clergymen of the Patriarchate and members of the local Armenian community received various physical injuries.\n\"It is obvious that the provocateurs are once again trying to achieve the appropriation of the ‘Cows’ Garden’ estate through terror, threats and violent actions, violating the procedures defined by the law.\n\"Strictly condemning what happened, we express hope that the Israeli authorities will respond legally to the criminal actions manifested against the Patriarchate and the Armenian community [of Jerusalem], the guilty will be held accountable, and the recurrence of similar incidents will be ruled out,\" the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin noted, in particular, in its statement.",

    "text": "On Jan. 2, Malbon Golf announced the signing of its first PGA Tour ambassador, Jason Day . The Aussie had been with Nike since 2016, but Day left the checkmark behind as the calendar flipped to 2024.\nMalbon is a popular brand deeply embedded into the game of golf and strives to connect with the younger generation. One thing is certain — Malbon will bring lots of style to the Tour with its new deal with Day.\nIn December, the former world No. 1 teamed up with Lydia Ko to win the inaugural Grant Thornton Invitational. Well, his good form made the trip with him to Hawaii as he posted an 8-under 65 Thursday to hold a share of second after the opening round of The Sentry at Kapalua’s Plantation Course.\nThursday was also Day’s first competitive round rocking his new Malbon threads. Take a look at some photos of Day’s new look below.\nThe Sentry : Photo gallery\n2024 The Sentry Jason Day plays his shot from the sixth tee during the second round of the 2024… Jason Day plays his shot from the sixth tee during the second round of the 2024 Sentry at Plantation Course at Kapalua Golf Club in Kapalua, Hawaii.

    "text": "Be prepared for severe weather power outages\nTWIN FALLS, Idaho (KMVT/KSVT) —Our winter weather can sometimes lead to power outages here in Idaho.\n“When an outage happens you need to be prepared because if you’re prepared then you won’t panic,” Angela Miller from Idaho Power said.\nWhen the lights go out and the heat turns off Miller says there are some important things to know to stay safe.\nTurn off appliances that you were using when the power went out, especially electric ranges and space heaters, to prevent the possibility of a fire if you’re away when power is restored.\nAlso prepare for medical needs, such as refrigerated medicine or electrically powered medical equipment. This could mean finding a place you can go during an outage or buying a backup generator.\nOnly use generators in well-ventilated areas.\n“If you are in an outage, also leave one light on so you know when it comes back on. Other things that you should do is know how to open your garage, so if your power goes out, you’re not trapped,” Miller explained.\nDuring the winter months, outages can be more severe, lasting hours or even days.\n“We can see transformers that blow. A lot of times you’ll see when the temperature drops extremely low. There’ll be an extra surge on those power lines,” Jackie Frey, Coordinator of the Twin Falls County Office of Emergency Management said.\nJackie Frey, with the Twin Falls County Office of Emergency Management, said when experiencing an outage you’ll want to make sure to have non-perishable food and water on hand, ”We’re not looking at making full meals, we’re looking at hydration and nutrition. Making sure that what you have is healthy and that it can help sustain you.\"\nThere are also other items you’ll want to make sure are in your emergency kits.\n“You would put things in it like flashlights, maybe a radio that you could crank, some granola bars. I recommend always having games and books for your kids,” Miller stated.\nA reminder that each person should have their own kit, and you can check for updates if there is an outage on Idaho Power’s website.\nCopyright 2024 KMVT.

    "title": "Senior Biden Campaign Official Not Happy When Anchor Pushes Her on 'Cognitive Function'",
    "text": "Note to reporters interviewing President Joe Biden's proxies: Their vocabulary does not include words such as \"cognitive function.\" During an interview Wednesday on Scripps News' \"On the Scene,\" Biden campaign spokeswoman Adrienne Elrod apparently lost her ability to process words when host Chris Stewart asked her a question about the importance of mental acuity in this fall's presidential race. \"How much should a ... candidate's cognitive function factor into that decision when someone votes?\" Stewart said. \"I don't even know what that question means,\" Elrod responded. \"Well, I mean, when they vote, should they be thinking about which candidate, how they're functioning cognitively?\" he said. \"Sure absolutely, they should,\" Elrod replied sharply with a glare that would curdle milk. [ffad_ic1] \"Alright, we'll leave it at that,\" Stewart said, clearly realizing that was all he was going to get from the spokeswoman. \"How much should a candidate's cognitive function factor into that decision when someone votes?\" Top Biden spokeswoman Adrienne Elrod: \"I don't even know what that question means.\" AWKWARD! pic.twitter.com\\/Zl8uh2Nesr — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) June 5, 2024 The question, of course, was an extremely vital one. On Thursday, Biden embarrassed the nation again during a D-Day commemoration ceremony in France by doing a half-sitting, half-standing move while French President Emmanuel Macron and first lady Jill Biden remained standing. The video showed the president's wife covering her mouth as if instructing him to remain standing. Awkward 😬 pic.twitter.com\\/3KNLco85hj — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) June 6, 2024 After the ceremony, the first lady, holding Biden's hand, walked away from the ceremony, leaving Macron alone to talk with the veterans. Jill, Ed.D., escorts Joe Biden out as French President Macron stays behind to greet veterans pic.twitter.com\\/n4rpRgdbv5 — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) June 6, 2024 A report Tuesday from The Wall Street Journal also highlighted the president's cognitive decline based on accounts from more than 45 Republican and Democratic lawmakers and staffers. The report painted a picture of an 81-year-old commander in chief who increasingly relies on note cards and cheat sheets during meetings, sometimes struggling to be heard or understood. Some said Biden would drift off at times, closing his eyes for extended periods. His demeanor and grasp of policy details were described as varying day-to-day. \"You couldn't be there and not feel uncomfortable,\" one person who met with the president during Ukraine aid negotiations in January told the Journal. Others said he frequently deferred questions to aides. In one meeting, Biden took 10 minutes after entering the room just to get started, then largely relied on note cards to state obvious points everyone had already agreed on, according to the report. Participants could barely hear the president, and \"much of the conversation didn't include him\" as staffers had to field questions directed at Biden. [firefly_poll] In a February follow-up with House Speaker Mike Johnson on U.S. liquid natural gas export policy, Biden seemed unaware the policy was already in effect, the Journal reported. He wrongly claimed to Johnson that it was \"only a study\" despite it being an active policy, leaving the Republican leader \"dismayed,\" according to witnesses. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy recalled Biden \"rambling\" and mumbling through debt ceiling negotiations last year, with his ability to command the room varying \"day to day.\" McCarthy said Biden always required note cards: \"He couldn't negotiate another way.\" When McCarthy asked lawmakers to follow up with Biden to hammer out the final details of the debt ceiling plan, they were frustrated. The former speaker told the Journal that the president kept revisiting old ground and seemed to forget how far along the negotiations had progressed. \"He was going back to all the old stuff that had been done for a long time,\" McCarthy said. \"And he was shocked when I'd say: 'No, Mr. President. We talked about that meetings ago. We are done with that.\" The White House pushed back on these reports, with spokesman Andrew Bates calling the accounts \"false claims\" made as a \"political tactic.\" In another clip from her appearance with Stewart on Scripps News, Elrod said with a straight face that Biden is \"sharper than ever\" and that \"he has achieved more as president than at least the past four to five presidents before him.\" Top Biden campaign spokesman Adrienne Elrod: Biden is \"sharper than ever\" 😬 pic.twitter.com\\/XmwxDoxvMH — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) June 5, 2024 The cognitive decline of the president seems to get more obvious by the day, and the White House has to know that few Americans believe the narrative about Biden being a \"savvy and effective leader.\" The continuing sight of a president who has to be led around like a child with a nursemaid is not only embarrassing, it's also dangerous.

Arthur Edwards/Pool via REUTERS 2/5 LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince William said on Thursday his late mother Princess Diana would have been honoured to see a charity set up in her name doing \"inspirational work\" to support young people around the world.\nWilliam, 41, said his mother's legacy was something both he and his wife Kate, Princess of Wales, had sought to focus on through their work.\n\"I know that she would have been honoured to see a charity in her name doing such inspirational work to uplift young people from all corners of the globe,\" the heir to the throne said in a speech at London's Science Museum where the ceremony was held.\n\"She taught me that everyone has the potential to give something back, that everyone in need deserves a supporting hand in life,\" William added.\nThe Diana Award was set up 25 years ago in memory of King Charles' first wife, who was killed at the age of 36 in a 1997 car crash in Paris when William was 15 and his younger brother Harry was 12.\nThe charity's Legacy Award, which recognises young people for their social action of humanitarian work, was set up in 2017, with a ceremony held every two years.\nTwenty recipients from across the globe were honoured at Thursday's ceremony including three from Britain and the United States with other recipients coming from countries such as India, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and Jamaica.\nThe ceremony comes in a week in which William's wife Kate, 42, apologised after her office issued a photograph she had edited of herself with the couple's three children.\nLeading news organisations, including Reuters, withdrew the picture after post-publication analysis showed it did not meet their editorial standards.\nThe picture had already attracted huge media attention as it was the first official photograph of Kate since she spent two weeks in hospital after undergoing abdominal surgery in January for a non-cancerous but unspecified condition, with her absence from royal duties sparking intense social media speculation.\nRoyal officials said she was not due to return until after Easter and has declined to give details, saying her health was a private matter.\nBritain's Prince William pays tribute to his late mother Princess Diana at awards event 2",

    "title": "Prominent Hindu speaker who chose monk life at 17 — Kartik Maharaj in eye of BJP-TMC political storm",
    "text": "Kolkata: On 24 May, thousands of monks marched through Kolkata’s streets to voice their opposition to comments made by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee against a section of Hindu monks. The rally, organised by Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), held significance, as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) cornered Mamata Banerjee over “appeasement politics”. Barefoot and carrying musical instruments, the monks’ procession, accompanied by the sound of conch shells, was a striking display of saffron that transformed the cityscape, despite Kolkata’s familiarity with political rallies. While addressing a rally in Hooghly district on 19 May, Mamata Banerjee had said: “I have heard for many days, there is a sadhu (saint) in Berhampore called Kartik Maharaj. I used to respect Bharat Sevashram Sangha; they have been on my list of respected organisations for a long time. But the man who says ‘I will not let TMC agents sit (in polling booths),’ I don’t accept that person as a sadhu because he is political and harming the country. I have identified who all are doing such things.” Meanwhile, speaking to ThePrint, Kartik Maharaj, said “She (Mamata) has done a favour by taking my name. I am not a common man, I am Kartik Maharaj, I represent the Sanatan Dharma. I am a monk, not a don that I will go and stop polling agents.” He claimed that the police were under duress from her and she could check with the officers if he had done so. “It’s a lie. What the chief minister has said against the Hindu organisations was condemned across the world and the Prime Minister is hurt by those words. This protest is not for me, but to safeguard the Hindus in Bengal,” he added. Born in Bengal’s undivided Dinajpur district, Kartik Maharaj chose to become a monk at 17. “My parents were shocked, they wanted me to continue with my education. But I was inspired by a sadhu who would often visit the Kali temple near my house,” he said. He joined Bharat Sevashram Sangha in the early 1980s and later founded its Beldanga branch in Murshidabad. “There was a deadly cyclone, Bhola, in 1970, that devastated Bengal. I helped rehabilitate the poor who had lost everything. As a monk, I was dedicated to serving humanity,” he told ThePrint. Known also as Swami Pardiptananda, Kartik Maharaj organised a ‘1 lakh Gita paath (recitation)’ in Kolkata, last year, which the BJP called a grand success. He was part of a delegation led by Bengal BJP chief Sukanta Majumdar to invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. “Only Narendra Modi has a clear vision for the country. I connect with him a lot. In fact, when Modiji led the life of a monk, he would visit the Bharat Sevashram in Rajkot and Surat. I had heard many stories about him. In November 2023, I met him for the first time and was in awe,” he recalled. In fact, Kartik Maharaj also organised a Kumbh Mela in Bengal’s Tribeni (Hooghly district) last year, which Modi hailed as the “revival of Hindu tradition after seven centuries,” on his Mann ki Baat radio show. However, a little-known monk in West Bengal, who has now grabbed national prominence, Kartik Maharaj is no stranger to controversies. In 2016, in an interview with Bengal Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) mouthpiece Swastika, he said, “I will only help Hindus who defend themselves, not those who come to me after being attacked.” The following year, at Hindu Samhati’s annual event in Kolkata, he claimed that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu — a 16th-century spiritual leader worshipped by Bengalis — also preached violence against Muslims, but the Bengalis have forgotten it. Hindu Samhati was established by former RSS pracharak Tapan Gosh in 2008, following his departure from the RSS in the previous year. Gosh had been associated with the RSS since the 1970s. Kartik Maharaj became a prominent speaker at Hindu Samhati events organised in Bengal and across the country — raising the prominence of Bharat Sevashram Sangha in Bengal. About Bharat Sevashram Sangha Founded in 1917 by Acharya Swami Pranavanandaji Maharaj in Bajitpur Village, Bangladesh (erstwhile Faridpur district), Bharat Sevashram Sangha is a charitable trust now based in Kolkata and recognised as a non-profit organisation by the Government of India since 1935. “Swami Pranavananda’s dynamism has helped to create a new consciousness within Hinduism, which can lead to a restoration of Hindu values and a flourishing of genuine religion in the sub-continent, which according to Smart, ‘is something of vital moment to global civilisation, in which Hindu values must surely play a major role’” stated the Bharat Sevashram Sangha’s website. Known as Binod during his childhood, an obedient student who loved to meditate, Swami Pranavananda became a role model for other students. He was given a special initiation by a saint in Gorakhpur on a new moon day in 1913. In 1924, he attained monkhood. “Everyone is welcome in our ashram, there are young volunteers, who work on the ground. We have over 500 monks who are running hospitals, mobile medical units, tribal welfare and educational centres in collaboration with the central government in Jharkhand, Gujarat, West Bengal, Assam, Nagaland, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh. We also help in relief work during natural calamities,” explained Kartik Maharaj. According to him, Swami Pranavananda had even met former prime minister Indira Gandhi for the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. “Our founder had united all the namasudras under one organisation. Whenever the Hindus faced trouble, he saved them with sticks and swords. He had said — ‘those who can give their head and take them as well, come with me,’” Kartik Maharaj told ThePrint while speaking of the history of Bharat Sevashram Sangha. From being Eastern Bengal’s largest Hindu caste, the namasudras are now West Bengal’s second-largest Scheduled Caste community, making up 4 percent of the state’s population, according to the 2001 Census . The Bharat Sevashram Sangha now has branches across the country and also expanded globally with over 50 branches. “We have branches in America, the United Kingdom, Japan, Indonesia and many other countries,” said Kartik Maharaj. During the 125th birth anniversary of Swami Pranavananda in 2020, Mamata attended as the chief guest at Kolkata’s Netaji Indoor Stadium to pay her tributes. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee attending the 125th birth anniversary of swami Pranavananda Maharaj in Kolkata | ANI West Bengal Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee attending the 125th birth anniversary of swami Pranavananda Maharaj in Kolkata | ANI In the lead-up to the West Bengal assembly elections in December 2021, the CM was seen paying floral tributes to Swami Pranavananda at Bharat Sevashram Sangha in Kolkata. Two months later, Union Home Minister Amit Shah visited the ashram and took part in the prayer rituals amid the pandemic. In Delhi, Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla in 2021 was the chief guest at the Bharat Sevashram Sangha’s Delhi branch at a book unveiling. Back in West Bengal the same year, former foreign secretary Dr Harsh Vardhan Shringla was felicitated at the Bharat Sevashram’s Siliguri branch before he joined the kirtan prayers in the evening. Speaking at the ashram, Shringla recalled his stint in neighbouring Bangladesh and how the Bharat Sevashram Sangha had played a pivotal role in safeguarding the Hindus and lauded its philanthropic work. According to a former BJP leader, devotees visit Bharat Sevashram branches almost every day. “We have all the temples inside the premises — Durga maa, Hanuman, Shiv, Narayan. So all the Hindus come to offer prayers. This becomes a place for meet and greet as well once the rituals are completed and bhog is offered,” said the leader. He went on to add that, although the ashram has no political links, politicians have never skipped being seen associated with it “as it is a popular organisation for the Hindus here.” Political fight in between elections Amid election season, a political skirmish has erupted, with Mamata Banerjee’s remarks involving three prominent organisations — Ramakrishna Mission, ISKCON, and Bharat Sevashram Sangha — stirring controversy. These institutions hold significant sway among the Bengalis and have inadvertently provided the BJP with leverage to pivot its campaign narrative against the Trinamool Congress (TMC). In Hooghly district Mamata said, “In Asansol, there is a Ramkrishna Mission. What have I not done for the Ramakrishna Mission (RKM)? When CPI(M) had blocked food to the Mission, I supported RKM and its existence and rights. Mothers and sisters would come and help with preparing the vegetables while CPI(M) wouldn’t allow you (RKM) to work. But I know a few, not everyone is like this.” On ISKCON, the West Bengal CM had said: “I have given 700 acres of land to ISKCON in Nadia district for construction. There is ISKCON Mission on that list as well. One or two will always be there who are instructed from Delhi to tell their followers to vote for the BJP. Why will sadhus and seers do such propaganda? Everyone respects RKM, they have a WhatsApp group for their members, I can love them, I can learn from them, but they don’t vote, how can they tell who to vote for? Few are violating, not all.” Responding to the CM, PM Modi, at a rally last week, said, “The Chief Minister has crossed all limits, she made ridiculous allegations against Ramakrishna Mission, ISKCON and Bharat Sevashram and insulted the sadhu community.”. He added that the CM was not ready to say anything to her TMC MLA (Humayun Kabir), who is threatening to erase the Hindu community but working day and night to save the perpetrator of Sandeshkhali — Shahjahan Sheikh. “These people abuse those who take Ram’s name, these people will not allow Ram Navami and will appeal for vote jihad against Modi. This is the truth of TMC and INDI-Alliance,” he added. These developments come as South Bengal prepares for the final phase of polling on 1 June, with most constituencies being predominantly Hindu, except for Diamond Harbour, Basirhat, and Joynagar, which have a substantial Muslim electorate. However, according to political analyst Jayanta Ghoshal, Mamata’s remarks were not a calculated utterance, but an impulsive knee-jerk reaction to some information she had received from her party units and administration, especially on Kartik Maharaj. “Mamata doesn’t hide her emotions, so she said it. But later she understood, it was not needed after the PM reacted sharply. The BJP thought they could be the beneficiary of consolidating their Hindu vote bank. And one might see Mamata’s Muslim appeasement.” Ghoshal told ThePrint. The political analyst added that Belur Math (headquarters of the Ramakrishna Math) steered clear and said it was an apolitical organisation, “but no one can deny Modi’s deep attachment to it. “He (Modi) used to stay at Rajkot Ramakrishna Mission and wanted to become a monk,” he said. Meanwhile, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) fears that Mamata’s statement will only benefit the BJP and further hurt TMC’s poll prospects in the state. “Mamata Banerjee has brought in religion to divert attention from the corruption her party has committed. One cannot expect anything more from her but communal politics. The BJP and TMC are both dividing people based on religion in West Bengal. Her comments will only benefit the BJP,” politburo member Mohammed Salim told ThePrint. Echoing this sentiment, political science professor Udayan Bandopadhyay said, “Do these Hindu organisations have a common platform? As far as my knowledge goes, they operate on their own in an independent capacity. It’s wrong to paint them with the same colour. ” The professor added that the CM could have avoided mentioning the names of these institutions as they work hard at difficult times. “But we must admit that they are non-state actors having independent goals and missions. They have an international reputation for their service.” (Edited by Richa Mishra)",

    "text": "Feds failed to consider all the health risks of a popular weed-killer: court rules By Nick Murray News February 20th 2025 Share this article\nParliament Hill is shown in Ottawa on Tuesday, Feb. 18, 2025. Photo by: The Canadian Press/Sean Kilpatrick\nThe federal government has been ordered to reassess its 2022 approval of a popular weed-killer after a Federal Court judge ruled this week the original approval was unreasonable.\nIn a decision issued Tuesday, Justice Russell Zinn gave Health Canada six months to reassess the health risks of glyphosate — the most heavily-used pesticide ingredient in Canada — after the agency failed to show it considered new scientific evidence identifying new or elevated risks associated with the herbicide when it renewed the registration for a product containing it.\nGlyphosate has been on the market since the 1970s and is in more than 169 pest control products sold in Canada, including Roundup. Farmers use it to keep weeds out of their crops.\nGet daily news from Canada's National Observer Email Bayer, which makes Roundup through its subsidiary Monsanto, has faced multiple lawsuits in the United States from Americans claiming the herbicide gave them cancer. Several cases resulted in multi-million-dollar awards to the plaintiffs, while others have been overturned on appeal.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Bayer's appeal in one case, although the company could continue to appeal as lower courts rule against it. As of July 2024, the company still faced about 58,000 claims.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported in 2020 there were no risks to human health from current uses of the herbicide, but its assessment was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The EPA has not yet provided a reassessment.\nEurope has banned certain formulations of glyphosate products and has banned pre-harvest use of it. Canada has not forbidden those products and still allows growers to use glyphosate products prior to harvest.\nIn August of 2022, Health Canada was in the process of renewing the registration for a product called Mad Dog Plus, which contains glyphosate.\nBy law, the agency can rubber-stamp a product registration renewal as long as the product is materially the same and no new evidence of risks associated with the product's ingredients is presented.\nCourts rule that the feds failed to consider all the health risks of a popular weed-killer But during the renewal process, four environmental organizations — including the David Suzuki Foundation and Environmental Defence — presented Health Canada with 61 new scientific studies identifying new or increased risks associated with glyphosate.\nWhile the Federal Court’s ruling didn’t speak to the health risks of glyphosate, Zinn said Health Canada failed to show any evidence that it evaluated the new studies.\n“The record offers no meaningful insight into how (Health Canada) considered the 61 new scientific studies the Applicants submitted, if it gave them any consideration at all,” Zinn wrote in his decision.\n“Brief and conclusory internal documents indicating mere ‘awareness’ of the evidence do not meet the ‘justification, transparency, and intelligibility’ threshold necessary for reasonableness review.”\nZinn didn’t quash the approval of Mad Dog’s registration, saying the situation was not the company's fault and withholding registration would cause it harm. Instead, he gave Health Canada six months to review the new studies and show proof that it considered them.\n“I find that maintaining the renewal indefinitely without sufficient justification would undermine regulatory accountability,” Zinn ruled.\n“(Health Canada’s) failure to provide a meaningful explanation regarding the 61 new scientific studies cannot be overlooked.”\nHealth Canada last re-evaluated glyphosate between 2004 and 2017 and concluded it posed acceptable health and environmental risks.\n“The decision really confirms that Health Canada does have an obligation to keep up with the science, and they will need to be transparent in how they address that new science,” said Laura Bowman, a lawyer with Ecojustice, one of the environmental groups that asked for the judicial review.\n“Previously, the public would only get to see what (Health Canada) thought about new science every 20 or 25 years, whereas now they’ll have to address it on a more regular basis.”\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 20, 2025\nFebruary 20th 2025 Nick Murray Keep reading",
