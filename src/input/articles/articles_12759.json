Fue el mejor azulgrana en la primera mitad y demostró su capacidad anotadora con 19 puntos, algunos de ellos de enorme categoría.\n4 Baldwin Puesta en escena especialmente errática. Surtió a sus compañeros de cuatro asistencias, pero falló los dos tiros libres decisivos en el epílogo.\n5 Raieste Emergió con fuerza en el inicio con cinco puntos, aunque su cometido no fue más allá de aportar dureza en las labores defensivas. Acabó desesperado por los errores en el tiro libre de sus compañeros.\n8 Moneke Junto a Rogkavopoulos y Forrest, de lo mejor anoche. Es increíble su capacidad para firmar canastas de todos los colores y no tembló en las entradas hacia el aro.\n4 Diop No se arrugó en primera instancia en el emparejamiento con Tavares, pero acabó en el ostracismo de la rotación debido al notable encuentro de Samanic como ‘cinco’ abierto.\n4 Howard Noche para olvidar, y ya van unas cuantas. Anotó su primer intento de triple, pero se cargó de faltas muy rápido y ello no le permitió acumular minutos sobre la cancha. Preocupa su irregularidad.\n6 Samanic Se retó con Hezonja en el primer cuarto y fue un protagonista en el epílogo. Dejó una de las jugadas de la jornada con su mate, pero falló un tiro libre decisivo tras lograr el rebote.\n5 Hall Irregular en su paso por Madrid. Protagonizó un buen mate a pase de Howard, logró cinco rebotes, pero no lo tuvo fácil ante una pareja de baile de la talla de Tavares.\n9 Rogkavopoulos Titánica actuación que reafirma su gran estado de forma. Firmó un doble-doble fruto de un derroche físico mayúsculo en la lucha por el rebote y su habilidad para encontrar el aro.\n4 Jaramaz Noche muy discreta en la rotación en el puesto de base. Entró en pista para dosificar a Howard, cargado de faltas, pero apenas generó juego en la circulación.",

    "text": "'Skeletal and Exhausted' Jennifer Garner Sparks MAJOR Health Concerns as Pals Urge Her to Take Break From Parenting, Career — And Comforting Troubled Ex Ben Affleck in Wake of His J Lo Divorce\nFeb. 20 2025, Published 7:45 p.m. ET\nJennifer Garner is running herself into the ground, and friends are starting to get worried about the actress' wellbeing.\nThe 52-year-old has been trying her best to juggle her Hollywood career, co-parenting three kids with ex Ben Affleck, and volunteering following the brutal L.A. wildfires – and things may be catching up to her, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\nA close source said: \"Jen has been dedicating every waking hour to helping her friends who have lost everything in the fires. She is helping her church, and she has been going non-stop.\n\"She needs to take some time to relax but that is not how Jen is – not when she is passionate about something.\"\nThe insider added: \"The fires took a big toll on her and she lost a friend. She has been out there every day volunteering her time.\"\nThe Alias alum has also found herself in the middle of her ex Affleck's post-divorce chaos with Jennifer Lopez.\n\"The fires came on the heels of Ben’s split from JLo which wore her out, [as she was] playing mediator,\" the source continued.\nThey noted: \"Not having that whole mess to deal with has been a weight lifted. On top of this, she is also raising children and is an incredibly hands-on parent.\"\nGarner and Affleck – who split in 2018 – share kids Violet, 19; Fin, 16; and Samuel, 12.\nAffleck, 52, has apparently relied on Garner during his divorce, and the Pearl Harbor actor is said to even be trying to rekindle their relationship despite the mom-of-three already dating longtime boyfriend John Miller.\nA previous source said: \"Ben would get back with Jen in a heartbeat if she'd have him,\" the insider said, however, Garner is currently in a relationship with her longtime boyfriend John Miller.\n\"He never really got over the end of his first marriage. Jen gets him like no one else and as the mother of his three kids, she'll always be on a pedestal for Ben. He'll never stop having regrets that he let her walk away.\"\nAs for Garner, friends claim they fear she's close to completely bottoming out with all the pressures of life.\nAnother source exclusively told RadarOnline.com: \"Jen hasn't burned out yet, but she's come close and knows it's because she has a hard time saying no, especially when it comes to helping neighbors or lending a hand to the community.\n\"You're seeing that up close as she puts in real hard work around the wildfire recovery. The disaster directly affected people she has known for years through church and in her neighborhood.\"\nAccording to our insider, the movie star has gone away from focusing on herself, and has been spotted looking thinner than normal.\n\"Jen only had a supporting role in Deadpool & Wolverine last year but she spent months getting back into shape and sharpening her martial arts training so she could do her own stunts,\" the source claimed referring to the box office smash starring Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.\nThey added: \"The movie was a hit and Jen won raves, but you kind of wish she was a little more selfish and didn't feel the need to say yes every time a friend asks for a favor.\n\"She doesn't want to admit it, but she has a messiah complex and is always putting other people's needs first. You'd love to see her go sit on a tropical beach – but Jen isn't wired that way. Her life is exhausting.\"",

    "title": "Pakistan keen to boost ties with Germany: Senate chairman",
    "text": "ISLAMABAD: Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gillani on Thursday said Germany was a valuable partner of Pakistan bilaterally and in the EU context and “we are keen to further strengthen this partnership”. On defence cooperation between Pakistan and Germany, he called for revisiting the German decision for imposing ban on selling small arms to Pakistan. He noted the fact that Pakistan and Germany shared a rich history of diplomatic relations founded in mutual trust, cooperation and commitment to global peace and development. He expressed these views during a meeting with a three-member German parliamentary delegation led by Michael Muller, MP, German Bundestag, at the Parliament House here. The chairman Senate specially mentioned the high level contacts and said that Pakistan desired to promote more interactions at all levels, underscoring the need to promote parliamentary exchanges between the two countries and said that high level political contacts helped bring people closer. He informed the delegation that the Senate of Pakistan was working on establishing friendship groups to promote people-to-people contacts for better understanding. While appreciating development cooperation, he expressed the desire to continue efforts for tackling climate change-related challenges. He said German assistance for rehabilitation of flood and earthquake victims was remarkable as it helped in providing relief to the homeless and shelterless communities during the crisis at that time. Both Pakistan and Germany enjoy cordial relations and cooperation at international forums like IPU and CPA. “Such a bond of friendship and collaboration shows that Germany is a trusted partner,” he remarked. The Senate chairman also emphasized increasing bilateral trade volume and said that huge potential existed to further boost mutual trade and economic cooperation. He observed that education, sports particularly football, energy, health, environment and climate were some of the areas where Pakistan could learn from German experiences. He appreciated Germany for providing scholarships to Pakistani students for higher studies. He specifically observed that inordinate delays in the issuance of student, family reunion and business visas created hardships for people and hoped that the issue would be addressed as early as possible. He said Pakistan was committed to promoting peace and stability in its neighbourhood and beyond on the principles of the UN charter for peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue and diplomacy. He said durable peace in South Asia remained linked to peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions and as per aspirations of the Kashmiri people. The human rights issue, he said, remained a top concern for European countries and in this regard, they might use their influence over India to improve the human rights situation in IIOJK and halt political engineering. He also highlighted the Palestine situation and said that it was deeply upsetting for Pakistan that Israeli aggression against civilians in Gaza and Rafah did not show any sign of stoppage. He called upon the international community to take steps for immediate ceasefire and reiterated that there could be no peace in the region unless a dialogue-based approach on the two states solution was adopted. He acknowledged the positive role played by the Pakistan diaspora in the socio-economic development of Germany while saying the community was acting as a bridge between Pakistan and Germany. Senator Sherry Rehman , Senator Irfan Siddiqui and Senator Abdul Qadir also expressed their views during the meeting. They called for cooperation in diverse sectors including energy and climate change to introduce new approaches and pathways for de-carbonization. Sherry appreciated German assistance in the field of climate finance. Senator Siddiqui emphasized the need to enhance cooperation in the education sector. Senator Qadir stressed cementing business linkages. The leader of the German delegation thanked Gillani for the warm welcome at the Parliament House. He said Pakistan was an important country for Germany and should continue to act as a stability anchor for the region. He also called for broadening mutual collaboration and diversifying the linkages. He said Pakistan was most affected by the impacts of climate change and there was huge potential where both Pakistan and Germany could work together and share experiences. The Senate chairman also celebrated the seventy years of Pakistan-Germany relationship and extended an invitation to his counterpart in the German parliament to visit Pakistan at a convenient time.",

    "text": "OTTAWA — Health Canada is reminding Canadians about a recall of home bed assist handles after learning of an additional death. Four models of bed handles distributed by Drive Medical were first recalled two years ago after two reported deaths — one in Canada and one in the U.S. Health Canada says as of Dec. 19, the company has received a report of a second death in this country. The metal handles are affixed alongside the mattress to help people get in and out of their regular bed at home. The products are not designed for hospital beds. Health Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada. It says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund. The recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ. No information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S. Drive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued. More than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "text": "Centoventi anni e non sentirli, la geotermia toscana celebra il passato ma guarda al futuro\nEsattamente 120 anni fa, il 4 luglio 1904, il principe Ginori Conti accese le prime cinque lampadine grazie al vapore contenuto nel cuore della Terra: fu il primo caso al mondo in cui l’energia rinnovabile presente nel sottosuolo venne utilizzata per produrre elettricità.\nAllora la geotermia era già usata per impieghi industriali – un altro primato mondiale segnato a Larderello nel 1818, per estrarre acido borico –, ma quella fu l’inizio di una straordinaria storia di successi toscani che continua ancora oggi nel mondo.\nPer celebrarla, ieri a Larderello si è svolto l’evento di commemorazione dei 120 anni dell’epopea elettrica della geotermia che ha richiamato circa 300 persone, alla presenza del presidente della Regione Toscana Eugenio Giani, dei sindaci di Pomarance Graziano Pacini, di Castelnuovo Val di Cecina Alberto Ferrini, di Volterra Giacomo Santi, dell’assessore di Massa Marittima Ivan Terrosi, nonché di rappresentanti delle associazioni di categoria e culturali del territorio, accolti dal responsabile Geotermia Enel green power Luca Rossini e dal responsabile area appenninica Enel Riccardo Amoroso.\nLa giornata si è aperta con la visita del Museo della Geotermia, a cui è seguita l’inaugurazione della mostra fotografica “Le terre del Vapore” di Fabio Sartori nella nuova Sala plastici della sede Enel green power di Larderello; poi la “Banda dello Stabilimento”, composta dalla “Filarmonica Puccini” di Pomarance e da alcuni musicisti geotermici, ha suonato l’inno francese, in ricordo del Conte De Larderel, e poi quello italiano con l’alzabandiera. L’apertura straordinaria e la visita della bellissima Chiesa Gentilizia, all’interno degli stabilimenti di Larderello, hanno introdotto la “Corale di Valle” che si è esibita in un concerto di livello.\nPer l’occasione, ieri, Enel ha inoltre esposto sulla facciata del Palazzo del Museo della Geotermia la grande effigie dell’esperimento del principe Ginori Conti del 4 luglio 1904.\nÈ la Toscana che ha permesso lo sviluppo della filiera geotermica nel mondo, dando accesso a una nuova fonte rinnovabile con cui oggi è possibile alimentare la transizione ecologica. A partire dalla Toscana stessa, ovviamente.\nOltre a soddisfare il 33% del fabbisogno elettrico regionale e a rappresentare più del 70% della produzione toscana da fonte rinnovabile, già oggi la risorsa geotermica fornisce calore utile a riscaldare circa 13mila utenti, 26 ettari di serre e aziende agricole ed artigianali, alimentando anche un’importante filiera del turismo sostenibile con 60mila visite annue tra i poli museali, gli impianti, i percorsi di trekking tra le manifestazioni naturali dei territori geotermici.\nMa la secolare storia della geotermia è destinata ad avanzare oltre. La Regione Toscana punta a\nraddoppiare la produzione di energia da questa fonte, e ha avanzato a Enel green power un ampio ventaglio di richieste, concretizzando le condizioni che dovranno accompagnare il Piano industriale richiesto a Enel affinché possa essere valutato positivamente, e da lì condurre a un rinnovo ventennale delle concessioni minerarie che sottendono la coltivazione geotermica.",

    "text": "Alertan sobre lluvias y tormentas eléctricas en occidente La Habana, 21 mar (ACN) El [Centro de Pronósticos del Instituto de Meteorología (Insmet)](http://www.insmet.cu/asp/genesis.asp?TB0=PLANTILLAS&TB1=INICIAL) emitió hoy el Aviso de Alerta Temprana No. 2 sobre la ocurrencia de lluvias y tormentas eléctricas en el occidente del país. El aviso destaca que un nuevo frente frío se formará mañana viernes sobre el golfo de México, avanzando hacia el Este y aproximándose al occidente de Cuba. Por delante de este sistema se desarrollará una banda prefrontal, que avanzará rápidamente hacia la mayor de las Antillas y provocará un deterioro del tiempo en la región occidental. Los nublados que acompañan esta banda prefrontal con fuerte actividad de chubascos y tormentas eléctricas, avanzarán hacia el este sobre la mitad occidental de Cuba durante la noche del viernes 22 y la madrugada del sábado 23. Con el avance de este sistema ocurrirán chubascos, lluvias y tormentas eléctricas, que pueden ser fuertes e intensas en algunas localidades del occidente. En áreas de chubascos y lluvias pueden producirse rachas de vientos fuertes, caída de granizos y fuerte actividad eléctrica, así como inundaciones en zonas bajas y de mal drenaje. El Insmet no descarta que de forma aislada puedan ocurrir otros eventos severos. Agrega la nota que el frente frío llegará en la tarde-noche del sábado 23 a la región occidental y también generará a su paso chubascos lluvias y algunas tormentas eléctricas. Esta situación meteorológica se trasladará posteriormente hacia las provincias centrales y llegará más debilitada a la región oriental el domingo 24. El Centro de Pronósticos mantiene una estrecha vigilancia sobre esta situación meteorológica y emitirá informaciones relacionadas en los Pronósticos del Tiempo y Avisos Especiales que lo requieran. - Visto: 317",
