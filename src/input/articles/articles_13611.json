    "text": "- Ndayishimiye, a fervent Catholic, said powerful nations \"should keep\" their aid if it comes with an obligation to give rights to homosexuals.\n- Some African leaders have in the past accused donor countries of trying to impose their values on the continent.\nBurundi's President Évariste Ndayishimiye has said that homosexuals in his country \"should be stoned\".\nResponding to a reporter's question, Mr Ndayishimiye, a fervent Catholic, said powerful nations \"should keep\" their aid if it comes with an obligation to give rights to homosexuals.\nSome African leaders have in the past accused donor countries of trying to impose their values on the continent.\nHomosexual sex is illegal in Burundi, punishable by up to two years in jail.\nIn an interview with the BBC last month, Ghanaian Catholic Cardinal Peter Turkson said homosexuality should not be a criminal offence and people should be helped to understand the issue better.\nBut his views are at odds with many conservative Christians on the continent. More than 30 African countries outlaw homosexual sex.\nTalking to journalists at a press conference, President Ndayishimiye used a Bible reference to say that God was opposed to homosexuality adding that it was no longer an issue in Burundi.\nHe had been asked about alleged pressure from Western countries for LGBT rights to be respected.\n\"For me, I think that if we find these people in Burundi they should be taken to stadiums and be stoned, and doing so would not be a crime,\" he said.\nMr Ndayishimiye suggested that homosexuality was like \"choosing between Satan and God\".\n\"If you want to choose Satan now go and live in those countries [in the West] and I think those who strive to go there want to acquire those habits, they should remain there and never bring them to us,\" the president added.\nIn a rare court case in August, seven people were sentenced to between one and two years in prison after they were found guilty of engaging in homosexual acts - a charge they denied.\nHomosexual sex is also illegal in many other countries in the region, including in Uganda, which in May tightened its law further to include a possible death penalty for what is described as \"aggravated homosexuality\". This includes having gay sex with someone below the age of 18 or where someone is infected with a life-long illness such as HIV.\nThe fresh measures led the World Bank to halt new loans to Uganda and the US to pull Uganda out of a preferential trade agreement and impose visa restrictions on key officials.\nUgandan rights groups are currently challenging the law in the courts.\nGhanaian MPs are also considering a bill that would make identifying as LGBT punishable with a three-year prison sentence. People who campaign for LGBT rights could also face up to 10 years in jail.",

    "text": "¿Cómo el presidente de un país democrático puede reducir la lucha electoral a ultraderechistas y progresistas sin pestañear? ¿Cómo hacerlo con la complicidad de su bancada sin que se les caiga la cara de vergüenza? ¿De qué naturaleza moral está hecho un tipo que miente por sistema, y proyecta sobre los demás toda su ruindad? ¿Hemos de colegir ante su descaro que su impostura es compartida por la mitad de los españoles? Si es así, ¿se ha de concluir que todo está permitido?\nMe froté los ojos de incredulidad la semana pasada en la sesión de control al gobierno, cuando el Jefe de la oposición le preguntó por la investigación judicial a su mujer y por toda respuesta defecó en la cara de todos los españoles con la matraca de la fachosfera y la máquina del fango, todo ello adobado con Hazte oír, el de la motosierra, Manos limpias, Netanyahu y la ultraderecha. Palabras envilecidas , delincuentes de guante blanco, la manera más sucia y burda de inyectar odio emocional en los sufridos votantes para arrastrarles a la confrontación como medio para evitar rendir cuentas.\nEso la semana pasada, pero ya entrados en harina electoral, estoy a punto de sacármelos cuando oigo gritar a la candidata del PSOE a las elecciones europeas, Teresa Rivera: \" ¡No pasarán! ¡No pasarán, ¡No pasarán!\" , desenterrando el grito de Dolores Ibárruri Gómez llamando a la Guerra Civil. Y de fondo palanganeros en mítines convertidos en trincheras gritando: \"¡ Gracias Begoña ¡\", con Pedro induciendo en cartitas perfumadas a los electores: \" O Yo o el juez \". Nuevas sesiones de espiritismo de Pedro Sánchez ejerciendo de López Rega para convertir a Begoña Gómez en su Evita Perón. Solo que el espejo refleja cruel la imagen esperpéntica de Trump . Aunque no sé qué es peor.\nVivimos en una época ilustrada, pero demasiados responsables políticos e intelectuales se niegan a argumentar con razones y datos y los sustituyen por estímulos dogmáticos, normalmente infectados de valores negativos para deshacerse de sus adversarios. Se acabó la complejidad de la realidad, todo es blanco o negro, puro maniqueísmo, la pocilga donde el hedor y la mierda lo impregna todo. El peor crimen contra la libertad. Si la educación pública se diseñó para comprender la complejidad del mundo y adquirir criterio sobre la realidad, este maniqueísmo sanchista es el peor atentado contra ella.\nNo sé qué hizo de este proceder un arma intimidatoria, pero desde que se instaló entre nosotros parecemos seres infantiles con miedo a ser electrocutados por cualquiera de sus estigmas. Con una anomalía en su aplicación, es unidireccional, sólo funciona contra la derecha. Y sólo funciona si la esgrime la izquierda o el nacionalismo.\nFrente a ese sabotaje a la democracia del sanchismo, ¿qué hace la derecha? Asumir acomplejada el estigma . Graso error.\n¿Hay alguna razón para que Pedro Sánchez pueda pactar con los herederos de ETA, con la derecha nacionalista y xenófoba de Junts o con cualquier enemigo de España, y el PP se vea obligado a ocultar la posibilidad de pactar con Vox por el mero hecho de que Sánchez lo estigmatice como la ultraderecha? ¿Es peor Vox que Bildu o PNV? ¿Peor que Junts, la CUP, ERC o AC? A todos ellos les une con VOX su nacionalismo identitario. En el caso de Bildu, PNV, ERC, CUP, ERC y AC, el nacionalismo étnico catalán y vasco, en el de Vox, el nacionalismo identitario español. Ahí están empatados , pero mientras VOX acepta y defiende la Constitución, y no ha cometido delito alguno, todos los otros han realizado crímenes horrendos a lo largo de su historia y han atentado contra la Constitución. ¿Por qué entonces es más indeseable VOX? ¿Por su política de inmigración? Su prevención frente a la inmigración islámica no es peor que la de Junts, ERC o AC, pero mientras Bildu, PNV, la CUP, ERC, Junts y AC practican la hispanofobia contra el resto de españoles e imponen políticas de segregación lingüística, Vox ampara los derechos de esos españoles en cualquier lugar de España.\nSi no es por cuestiones xenófobas , ¿podría ser entonces por sostener ideologías conservadoras o ultraconservadoras? No más que Junts, AC y el PNV en cuestiones económicas, religiosas o morales. Aunque unos y otros tienen derecho a profesarlas, el Estado de derecho las ampara. Como ampara a los separatistas defender la independencia sin que nadie les pueda perseguir por ello. Incluso tienen modos constitucionales para llegar a ella: modificando la Constitución según las reglas establecidas.\nDel autor 30 May. 2024: ¡Victoria! 23 May. 2024: La próxima jugada de Sánchez 16 May. 2024: ¿Quién ganó en Cataluña el 12-M? 9 May. 2024: ¿A quién votar el 12 de mayo? Insisto entonces, ¿por qué es tan indeseable VOX para Pedro Sánchez? ¿Sólo por ser nacionalista español? Extraña disonancia la suya, que se encama con todos los nacionalistas que quieren destruir España, y pone un cordón sanitario al PP para impedirle que forme mayorías parlamentarias con él. ¡Con lo fácil que tendría el PSOE pactar con el PP cuestiones esenciales de Estado sin depender de los chantajes de sus enemigos!\nEn el colmo de la impostura , Sánchez recrimina a Feijóo la mera posibilidad de que pudiera pactar con Puigdemont una moción de censura. Más allá de la mentira que en él es moneda corriente, el personaje tiene las santas narices de afear y vetar en el adversario lo que en él es una virtud, pactar con Puigdemont.\nNo pretendo hacer una defensa de Vox, con el que me separan tantas cosas, sólo remarcar por contraste el gran error de perspectiva histórica del PP frente a las artimañas del sanchismo y los nacionalistas. Cuando en el fútbol te dejas arrebatar la posición, estás perdido . No es distinto en la vida en general y en la política en particular. Es la asignatura pendiente del PP, también de Feijóo. Siempre acobardado ante la hegemonía moral de la izquierda, siempre atento para defenderse, nunca para atacar. Que aprenda del Real Madrid. Sabe defender, ralentizar el partido y atacar. Es decir, hacer de la virtud, necesidad .\nHabría de fijarse Feijóo en dos mujeres de su partido tan distintas, Isabel y Cayetana , y sin embargo tan eficaces dando la batalla cultural que España tiene pendiente frente al nacionalismo y la izquierda plurinacional y reaccionaria. Un ejemplo vale más que mil palabras. En esa misma sesión parlamentaria de control al Gobierno de la semana pasada, Cayetana Álvarez de Toledo les ocupó el espacio de la hegemonía moral y política con una intervención tan sencilla como irrefutable: \" Sr. Bolaños, comparar es comprender. Fíjese en ese ultra Abascal, ¿ha secuestrado a alguien ? Otegui , ¿Ha jaleado al terrorismo desde un periódico?, Aizpurua … \". Y así repasando las evidencias de todos los partidos que apoyan al Gobierno de Sánchez. No sin antes darle dos mandobles merecidos a Vox. Merece la pena escucharla y seguir sus pasos. Así se equilibra el respeto debido a todos. Vale más ponerse colorado una vez, que estar pagando royalties toda la vida.\nUna pequeña historia : un día, un putero de aldea llegó a la capital para visitar un burdel. Cuál no sería su sorpresa cuando vio que la moza más guapa de su pueblo ejercía la prostitución en el local. Se aprovechó de la situación, y para evitar ser delatada en el pueblo, la muchacha accedió a tener sexo gratis con él. La asunción del chantaje no impidió las habladurías en la aldea cada vez que iba por fiestas. Un verano, harta del acoso moral, entró en el único bar del pueblo con el descaro que solo una prostituta sabe imprimir, y viendo cómo todo el mundo murmuraba y la sancionaba con miradas chismosas, grito con determinación: ¡Sí, ejerzo de puta en Madrid, y vivo mejor que todos vosotros, muertos de hambre! Y tú, tú y tú —señaló a tres cazurros— no volváis por mi negocio porque os hecho a patadas. Ahí se acabaron las habladurías. Desde entonces, admirada y respetada. Por cierto, los tres pringados quedaron como Cagancho en Almagro.\nNo sólo hierra el PP con Vox , también lo hace con Izquierda Española , la única izquierda que, como los populares, defiende la existencia de España sin complejos frente a quienes la quieren convertir en cortijos y privilegios.\nDesde que irrumpió en la realidad hace unos meses, los medios de la izquierda le hicieron el vacío o la falsificaron, mientras que los de derecha la recibieron con entusiasmo. Les pareció estupendo una izquierda auténtica que desenmascara a la izquierda oficial encamada con el nacionalismo y las fuerzas más reaccionarias. Las críticas a la derecha y su agenda social les importaban un carajo mientras le diera estopa a la izquierda oficial y real… Pero en cuanto han irrumpido por primera vez en las Elecciones Europeas, han desaparecido de sus medios. Graso error. Más allá de algún medio digital humilde, sólo Carlos Alsina de Onda Cero le ha ofrecido sus micrófonos para una entrevista de 9 minutos en medio de la campaña. Escúchenla aquí. Muy recomendable, sobre todo para los ciudadanos de izquierdas.\n¿Por qué se equivoca nuevamente el PP? Porque, quiera o no quiera, en un Estado de derecho es inevitable la existencia de partidos de todas las ideología, también de izquierdas. Quiera o no, le interese o no le interese, existirán partidos de izquierdas. Y ya que es inevitable, mejor será que sean democráticas y no populistas o caballos de Troya del nacionalismo. Cuanto antes surja con representación parlamentaria una Izquierda Española de libres e iguales contra los privilegios asimétricos de la izquierda nacionalista y reaccionaria, más fácil será volver a la senda constitucional y más difícil tendrán los Pedro Sánchez de turno vendidos a Bildus y Puigdemones formar gobiernos. Sólo votando a Izquierda Española será posible llegar de nuevo a la normalidad democrática y a una socialdemocracia que nos haga a todos los españoles iguales en derechos y obligaciones. Y ya que por razones y generosidad no dan cancha a Izquierda Española en sus medios, al menos que lo hagan por interés. Puede que el triunfo de Izquierda Española sea la única opción que tenga España para deshacerse de esta izquierda reaccionaria y nacionalista que nos gobierna. A buen entendedor pocas palabras bastan.\nTemas PSOE Izquierda Española",
