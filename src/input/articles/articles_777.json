    "text": "Hardy Brits braved the lashing rain and strong winds to usher in the New Year, as the nation came together to kick off 2024 in spectacular style. Revellers flocked to the banks of the River Thames in the early evening, hours ahead of the traditional London fireworks which lit up the sky into a cacophony of colours when Big Ben struck midnight. In a display that lasted almost 15 minutes, 100,000 people cast their eyes to the sky to take in the firework, laser, and drone spectacular which was hailed by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan as the capital's 'best and biggest ever' New Year celebration. Another breathtaking display took place in Edinburgh as part of the annual Hogmanay celebrations, with fireworks launched above Edinburgh Castle while Kasabian's 'Fire' played out on the stroke of midnight. Partygoers refused to let the miserable weather dampen their parade as they powered through the pouring rain across the country, including in Liverpool, Leeds and Newcastle, in a bid to welcome 2024 in style. While lucky ticket holders packed out the Thames to get the optimal view of the 12,000 fireworks fired above the London Eye, revellers dressed to the nines in their finest outfits have descended on clubs and bars to see in the New Year. Fireworks were launched into the sky above the London Eye as Britain saw in the new year New Year revellers get in the party spirit in Leeds overnight as they welcome in 2024 London put on a show tonight as a sensational firework display was witnessed by revellers braving the elements A wet start to the New Year in Manchester this morning as revellers hit the bars in rain ponchos LONDON: The display marked the King's coronation year and also used Charles' quote to mark the 75th anniversary of the Windrush crossing Revellers welcome 2024 in Birmingham overnight as partygoers are carried through the street Hardy revellers have braved the lashing rain and strong winds to usher in 2024, as they shake off the dreary weather to kick off the New Year in spectacular style Revellers brave the rain as they make the most of New Year's Eve in Liverpool city centre LONDON: The capital was lit up by thousands of fireworks as crowds flocked to the River Thames LONDON: Fireworks explode around the London Eye and the Houses of Parliament during New Year's celebrations LONDON: Despite the miserable weather, revellers gathered on the banks of the Thames in the early evening, hours ahead of the traditional London fireworks which lit up the skies as Big Ben struck midnight LONDON: Fireworks explode around the London Eye and Big Ben as the clock struck midnight LONDON: The iconic fireworks were said to have soared as high as 200m into the air when they were launched from the London Eye on the stroke of midnight EDINBURGH: Fireworks light up the sky over Edinburgh Castle and the Balmoral Clock to mark the New Year Others dressed a little bit more suitably for the weather have flocked into city and town centres across the country to marvel at spectacular light and firework displays. That's despite a forecasters putting a storm warning in place which has caused some events in the south to be cancelled due to powerful 75mph gales. After millions watched the incredible displays in Sydney and Auckland, Mayor Sadiq Khan told Sky News that the events would be 'nothing' compared to London's - which lasted for just under 15 minutes. After the bongs of Big Ben sounded midnight, 'London: A Place for Everyone' was written high above the crowds as the unity-themed display welcomed the new year. As hits by the Spice Girls, Calvin Harris, Dua Lupa and others rang out across the city, revellers were invited to look back on 2023. The celebration referenced the King's coronation and also used Charles' quote to mark the 75th anniversary of the Windrush crossing in which he said the new arrivals 'collectively enrich the fabric of our national life'. The display - which included more than 12,000 fireworks, 600 drones and 430 lights - also paid homage to the NHS, which celebrated 75 years in 2023. There were repeated references to London's diversity and inclusivity, with the capital telling the world everyone is welcome in a city where people can be themselves. Further messages throughout the pyrotechnic show were heard from Mr Khan, Dame Helen Mirren, Bella Ramsey, Stephen Fry, Joanna Lumley, George the Poet, and Baroness Floella Benjamin, who read a poem by the late Benjamin Zephaniah. Mr Khan said: 'Our unique combination of fireworks, drones, lighting and music have put on a fabulous show for the millions watching around the globe, sending a message of unity and showing why London is the greatest city in the world. '2023 was filled with so many special moments, and as we move into 2024, I feel more inspired than ever to continue our work towards building a better, greener and more prosperous city for everyone.'

In Scotland, the 30th Hogmanay street party in Edinburgh was headlined by rock band Pulp after their surprise reunion last year. Edinburgh City Council leader Cammy Day said: 'After the difficult years of the pandemic, I'm overjoyed that our festivals are back to their brilliant best and providing such high calibre cultural offerings for our residents and visitors.' Elsewhere, there has already been an impressive firework show in Blackpool, as the explosives erupted into the sky with Blackpool Tower illuminated in the background. In Newcastle's Quayside crowds were treated to BAFTA award-winning artist Seb Lee-Delisle's new Laser Light City laser show, which was projected onto the Baltic Flour Mills. Revellers also gathered in anticipation of Edinburgh's Hogmanay firework display as musicians hyped the crowd up for an evening of entertainment. Thousands of people are at the sold out Princes Garden Street Party and Concert in the Gardens in what mark's the festival's 30th anniversary. The event, organised by UniqueAssembly and City of Edinburgh Council, was headlined by Pulp, who have not played in the city in 20 years. Following their set, the fireworks will begin at midnight and will end at around 00.50am on Monday. Before the event, Alex MacDonald, 26, said he was most excited for Pulp and the fireworks. He told the PA news agency: 'I'm heavy looking forward to Pulp, like - it's gonna be smashing. 'The fireworks will be phenomenal man. It'll be brilliant. We'll have a heavy bevy to that, ken what I'm saying?' Dave Reed, also 26, said he is 'here for the tunes and everything else that's happening'. He added: 'I'm well excited for the fireworks, it's gonna be everything. 'That's what Edinburgh is all about, and that's what Hogmanay is all about.' Ahead of the main display, there were some small firework displays between different musical sets, much to the applause of the hyped-up crowd. Commenting on the news of a sell-out, Al Thomson, co-director of UniqueAssembly, said: 'We're in for one hell of a party now. Fifty thousand people in the streets of Edinburgh enjoying good music, good company, and one of the best fireworks displays in the world - there's no better way to start the new year. 'We started things off right with the Torchlight Procession on Friday, where we saw 20,000 people come together to shine a light on homelessness, raising money for our charity partner Social Bite; and this is just the perfect end to the year and the best way to celebrate 30 years of Edinburgh's Hogmanay.' However, not every planned event took place this evening, with Plymouth's Winter Wonderland and a Devon town's fireworks display both cancelled. A yellow weather warning for wind is in place for Britain's entire southern coastline and south Wales.

Saturday's Eurostar cancellations hit one family who were hoping to make it back to Britain in time for New Years, after they were stranded in Brussels following a surprise trip for a Canadian relative. Luke Gibbs, 32, from Kenley, south London, travelled with his wife, Kyla, cousin Liam Eton and sister-in-law Brea Melanson, from Canada, and planned to arrive in London in time for New Year's Eve celebrations on Sunday. Mr Gibbs, a business development manager, paid £600 for a New Year's Eve event in London Bridge, which is not refundable and now he cannot attend after his train from Brussels to St Pancras was cancelled. He described the communication with Eurostar as 'appalling'. 'I think the way (Eurostar) dealt with it is pretty appalling in terms of not trying to say 'this is how you rebook it, we'll help you out with expenses',' Mr Gibbs told the PA news agency. 'They just said, 'unfortunately, it's cancelled, we're sorry, get on with it', which is shocking really.' Organisers of Plymouth's Winter Wonderland took the 'very difficult decision' to rip up its plans for New Year's Eve tonight because of the expected stormy winds. 'As much as we are very disappointed and frustrated, your safety comes first, as well as ours, and we can't possibly take the risk,' they said as they confirmed those who had bought tickets will be fully refunded. Elsewhere, Barnstaple, in Devon, cancelled its annual fireworks because of the 'horrendous' weather, reported Devon Live. Barnstaple Town Centre Management said it axed the display for safety reasons.

'We know this is disappointing, but safety is always the priority and we unfortunately can't control the weather.' Temperatures are set to plummet on New Year's Day and in January increasing the chance of sleet and snow on higher grounds in the north, with frosty mornings for many. Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: 'There are growing signs of cold weather developing as we head through the first half of January. 'The chance of a significant cold spell is quite high. 'The highest risk of snow will probably be in the North and East. But if low pressure pushes up from the southwest, this would lead to the possibility of snow as weather fronts move northeast.'",

    "title": "Running clubs to be recommended to long-term sick under Government plans | York Press",
    "text": "Running and gardening clubs will be recommended to those on long-term sickness leave in a bid to get people back to work. Doctors, employers, job centres, social workers and charities will be encouraged to suggest therapy and life coaching under new Government plans to create a national occupational health service and reduce the number of people whom GPs sign off from work. Community activities such as singing, cooking or gardening clubs will also be offered through NHS “social prescribing” initiatives. Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride and Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said the scheme is not a “one size fits all” but they hope it will work with other services to help people stay in employment. They told The Times: “We know the longer someone spends out of work, the harder it becomes for them to find a job. They added: “We also know that one in five of those claiming the highest level of health benefits want to work and feel they could do so with the right support.” Currently, there are 2.2 million people claiming Universal Credit with no work requirements. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has previously committed to tackling the growing numbers of those too ill to work. The pilots will see 15 areas test a service known as WorkWell which involves work coaches, physiotherapy and mental health treatment. Following the trials, the Governments hopes to expand the scheme nationally but key elements of it will not take effect until 2025. Ms Atkins and Mr Stride said: “Where someone could fall out of work and on to long-term sickness benefits, WorkWell is designed to swoop in and provide the support that people need to stay in work, or return as soon as possible.” Labour’s shadow employment minister Alison McGovern told The Times the scheme is “all too little and it’s far too late”.

Get well soon Mason,\" a second wrote.\n\"Mason Miller did what?\" a third asked.\nMost read in Baseball\nMiller has been sensational this season, posting a 2.21 ERA and striking out 70 batters in 40 2/3 innings.\nHe is 15 for 17 in save opportunities.\nMiller's lack of saves is largely due to the fact Oakland has a disappointing 41-63 record.\nHe made the All-Star team in his rookie campaign and threw a pitcher with 103.6 mph in the game which broke a record.\nThe 25-year-old Miller has been a trade deadline candidate leading up to the July 30 deadline.\nHowever, the A's have reportedly asked for a huge return.\nMiller has five years before he hits free agency.\nIt doesn't seem likely that he will be traded but it won't be because of his pinky injury on his non-throwing hand.\nRead More on The US Sun\nMiller's injury won't be season-ending.\nBut throwing an injury into the mix makes it difficult for Oakland to receive the highest value for the rookie.",

    "text": "La troisième tentative fut la bonne : après deux reports en deux jours, la Russie a finalement réussi jeudi le lancement de sa fusée de nouvelle génération Angara-A5 depuis le cosmodrome Vostotchny, dans l’Extrême-Orient russe. Le lancement a lieu à 9h00 GMT, selon une retransmission en direct sur le site de Roscosmos, l’agence spatiale russe. Les images montraient la fusée propulsée dans les airs et s’élever dans le ciel. \"La fusée a fonctionné normalement, l’étage supérieur s’est séparé du troisième étage de la fusée\", s’est félicité dans un communiqué l’agence Roscosmos quelques minutes plus tard. Ce lancement réussi intervient toutefois après deux reports en deux jours, mardi et mercredi, pour des raisons \"techniques\", avait expliqué Roscosmos, un nouvel accroc pour [le programme spatial russe miné par les difficultés.](https://www.rtbf.be/article/russie-test-reussi-de-la-fusee-angara-de-nouvelle-generation-10905527) La fusée Angara-A5 est un engin de nouvelle génération développé dans le cadre d’un programme destiné à remplacer les vieillissants lanceurs Proton, dont la technologie remonte aux années 1960. Ce programme moderne, dont l’idée remonte aux années 1990, a toutefois pris du retard et le calendrier fixé par les autorités russes au moment du premier essai, dès 2014, n’a pas été respecté. Source d’une immense fierté à l’époque soviétique, le secteur spatial russe s’est enlisé depuis la chute de l’URSS à force de scandales de corruption, de coupes budgétaires, de retards en série et de revers embarrassants, comme la perte de la sonde lunaire Luna-25 en août 2023.",

    "text": "With the Baltimore Orioles franchise in an upward swing, it seems the CEO John Angelos does not want to relinquish his control of the team despite it being his father’s wish upon his death. After five straight losing seasons, including three years with over 100 losses, the process has finally worked and the Baltimore Orioles are relevant again. They stunned the baseball world in 2022 by finally making the jump and becoming a competitive team. Then in 2023, they evolved into a full-fledged contender.

Heading into 2024, Baltimore has a team built to be good for years to come and has the cap flexibility and assets to further improve the roster. All the work that the Angelos family put into bringing the franchise back to relevancy has finally paid off. And with their branding growing it could be a perfect time to sell. It is something that has been rumored in MLB circles recently and is reportedly something that owner Peter Angelos wants to happen after he passes away. That could come soon with the 94-year-old battling health issues in recent years. However, it seems that his eldest son John — the organization’s chairman and CEO — has no interest in letting the franchise slip out of the family’s control. On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that a battle over the future of the Baltimore Orioles could be brewing inside the Angelos family. “John Angelos has indicated privately that he intends to keep the club moving forward, potentially throwing the future of the franchise into turmoil,” the Wall Street Journal claims.

With the value of owning a sports team in North America on a heavy upward swing, that number could certainly increase if Baltimore has another strong season in 2024. More must-reads:",

    "text": "Uma greve de funcionários paralisou os voos da Aerolíneas Argentinas nesta sexta-feira, 13. Ao menos 319 voos e 37 mil passageiros foram afetados, segundo a empresa.\nA ação começou às 12h desta sexta e deve durar 24 horas. Os trabalhadores pedem aumento salarial e protestam contra medidas do governo de Javier Milei, que quer privatizar a empresa.\nA paralisação deve custar US$ 2,5 milhões de dólares à estatal, segundo comunicado da empresa, pelos gastos com multas, compensações, hoteis para passageiros e outros gastos.\nA recomendação da empresa aos passageiros com voos nesta sexta e sábado fiquem atentos aos avisos enviados por email. Caso as passagens tenham sido compradas por uma agência de turismo, a recomendação é os clientes falem diretamente com ela.\nAs empresas Flybondi e Jetsmart seguem operando, mas enfrentam alguns problemas. Segundo o Clarín, há relatos de atrasos em voos e demora no processamento de malas, por conta de efeitos da paralisação da Aerolíneas e da Intercargo, que maneja bagagens nos terminais.",
