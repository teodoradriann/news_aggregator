Due to the morning lows in the 60s, the sunshine will warm us into the 70s for one more day. Much colder air will pour into Southern New England tonight as winds switch to the northwest, ushering colder Canadian air into out region. Overnight lows will drop into the lower 40s. The cold pool of air will be here for the entire weekend and even though there will be ample sunshine, daytime highs will struggle in the 50s. Saturday night into Sunday morning Daylight Saving Time comes to an end and clocks go back an hour. Temperatures will also drop off into the upper-20 and lower-30s, making for a light freeze in many areas. Looking to next week, Monday is looking to be the coldest with highs near 50. A warm front Monday night will bring in clouds and the next chance of showers Monday night. The warm air behind the front will bring back the 70s for midweek.",

    "text": "The Motley Fool This Sector is the New Oil, and I’m Buying 1 Stock in Bulk Read full article Amy Legate-Wolfe February 16, 2024 at 3:00 a.m. · 4 min read Source: Getty Images\nWritten by Amy Legate-Wolfe at The Motley Fool Canada\nOil is out.\nAnd semiconductor stocks ? They’re definitely in.\nDecades ago, it seemed as though oil had nowhere to go but up. We used it, and still do, for pretty much everything. But there has been a shift in the winds, and now oil stocks are far less stable. In fact, many haven’t seen a strong rise in share price in the last few years . That is unless they’re either acquired, or move towards more diversified assets.\nBut semiconductors? These stocks are on the rise.\nBullish, but bumpy For investors looking to gain lots of rewards in the long term, semiconductor stocks offer an enormous opportunity. However, the near term might be a bit bumpy. As the entire global economy continues to digitize rapidly, semiconductor companies continue to play an enormous role.\nOf course, you might have watched them spout in recent times thanks to the expansion of artificial intelligence (AI). And that’s certainly true. We’ll need more semiconductor chips so that we can receive faster, more responsive AI. But it goes beyond that one area.\nSemiconductors are critical in the role of cloud computing, 5G wireless networks, even autonomous vehicles. However, more recent times have been difficult for the industry. Higher inflation and interest rates, along with geopolitical issues, have been a burden on this burgeoning industry. But I wouldn’t give up on it quite yet.\nWe’ve seen success! I’m sure you’ve already come across this name, but Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) remains a top choice among many investors. The company quickly became one of the ‘Magnificent 7’ over the last year. It even managed to topple Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) to take the fourth most-valued company spot for a little while.\nThat over-a-trillion-dollar market cap has been matched by a rising share price. The graphics chipmaker continues to post a lot of upside for analysts. While the company may have started out in gaming, it has quickly shown that it can help meet the demand as the world expands its semiconductor chip use.\nStory continues The thing is, it’s pricey. Like, really pricey. And while NVDA stock certainly remains a great investment, it could also be seen as a risky one. Not only for its share price, but also ongoing macro issues. What’s more, should supply-chain issues hit, this could really hurt Nvidia stock. So there’s another Canadian company I would consider instead.\nCanada’s biggest chipmaker While Canada’s largest semiconductor stock is nowhere near Nvidia stock, it’s still a strong one to consider. POET Technologies ( TSXV:PTK ) is a semiconductor stock already providing its products on a global scale. But shares are still in penny status, trading at $1.75 as of writing.\nThe company was doing quite well, but during its last quarter missed out on earnings estimates. Shares are down 69% in the last year. So again, there could be a bumpy ride for this stock in the near term. Long term, however, we’re going to continue to need these semiconductor stocks. And Poet stock looks like the best of the best.\nGranted, there is definitely going to be a lot of competition, and not just from the United States. India, China, and other countries have already been increasing their deployment of semiconductor chips. However, if you’re looking for a Canadian company set up for success, I would still consider Poet stock as a solid long-term bet.\nBottom line, everything is turning digital. And everything digital runs on semiconductors. So if you’re wanting to create major returns, this is the sector to beat.\nThe post This Sector is the New Oil, and I’m Buying 1 Stock in Bulk appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada .\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

    "text": "XALAPA, VER.- Octubre es un mes que ha estado enmarcado por fuertes lluvias en Veracruz, las cuales dejaron múltiples afectaciones como inundaciones, deslaves y derrumbes de puentes. Para este jueves 31 de octubre se prevé que las precipitaciones vuelvan a aumentar. En el pronóstico de la Subdirección de Estudios y Pronósticos Meteorológicos de la Secretaría de Protección Civil (SPC) de Veracruz indica que la interacción de una vaguada en el suroeste del Golfo de México y la llegada una nueva onda tropical a la zona cercana, intensificarían el viento del Norte en las costas y se presentarían algunas lluvias en los próximos días.

El clima en Xalapa para este viernes 1 de noviembre se pronostica con un ambiente fresco desde las primeras horas. Los nublados predominarán en la mayor parte del día y las lluvias se esperan entre las 4:00 y 7:00 de la tarde, por lo que se pide a la población extremar precauciones. El pronóstico indica que ya a partir del sábado 2 de noviembre disminuyan las lluvias y habría un fin de semana estable en las condiciones del tiempo. Nuevo frente frío y posible ciclón tropical La misma Dirección de Meteorología de la SPC indica que entre la tarde del miércoles 6 y el jueves 7 de nueva cuenta podrían aumentar las lluvias en “en gran parte” de Veracruz. Esto se debe al pronóstico de aproximación de un nuevo frente frío y el fortalecimiento de una vaguada en el Golfo de México. Hasta el momento hay un 50 por ciento de probabilidad de que un ciclón tropical se desarrolle en el suroeste del Caribe en los próximos 7 días. El pronóstico oficial indica que se podría mover hacia el Golfo de México a medidos de la primera semana de noviembre, por lo que las autoridades en Veracruz se mantienen en vigilacia.",

(Nasdaq: SNTI) (“Senti Bio” or the “Company”), a clinical stage biotechnology company developing next-generation cell and gene therapies using its proprietary Gene Circuit platform, today announced plans to streamline its business operations, including reducing its workforce by approximately 37 percent, to enable increased focus on SENTI-202, a first-in-class Logic Gated investigational cell therapy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”). The Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for SENTI-202 was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in December 2023 and the Company anticipates dosing the first patient in the second quarter of 2024. Additionally, the Company will continue to support the clinical development activities of SENTI-301A for the treatment of advanced glypican 3 (“GPC3”)-expressing hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) in China through its partnership with Celest Therapeutics. The Company expects that these resource allocation efforts, combined with other expected receivables, will extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2025.\n“We have made significant progress toward our mission to advance our Gene Circuit enhanced oncology cell therapies and recently achieved our milestone of IND clearance for SENTI-202, in line with our previous guidance. Despite this progress, we are taking the difficult but necessary steps to enhance our focus on demonstrating clinical proof-of-concept for our Gene Circuit technology and potentially bringing SENTI-202 and SENTI-301A to patients,” said Timothy Lu, MD, PhD, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Senti Bio. “With these resource allocation efforts, our team will remain laser-focused on the clinical progress of SENTI-202 and supporting our partnership with Celest Therapeutics for SENTI-301A in China. We extend our immense gratitude to our dedicated colleagues impacted by this decision and are committed to supporting them throughout this process.”\nThe Company outlined the following key strategic decisions:\nPrioritize the clinical development of SENTI-202, a potentially first-in-class, off-the-shelf Logic Gated chimeric antigen receptor natural killer (“CAR-NK”) cell therapy product candidate for the treatment of AML and other hematologic malignancies. The Company anticipates the following from the Phase 1 clinical trial: First patient dosed in the second quarter of 2024 Initial efficacy data by year-end 2024 Durability data in 2025 Continue SENTI-301A program work in China through the partnership with Celest Therapeutics; the first patient is anticipated to be dosed in the first half of 2024 Scale back all other research and development initiatives while continuing to support ongoing partnerships with Spark Therapeutics and BlueRock Therapeutics Reduce current headcount by approximately 37 percent; anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of 2024 The Company expects to incur one-time costs of approximately $1 million, of which nearly all are cash expenditures related to severance and are anticipated to be incurred in the first quarter of 2024 The combination of anticipated cost savings, and the Company’s balance of cash, cash equivalents and investment securities of $40.3 million as of November 30, 2023, and other expected receivables, are now expected to fund its revised operating plan into the first quarter of 2025\nAbout Senti Bio\nSenti Biosciences is a biotechnology company developing a new generation of cell and gene therapies for patients living with incurable diseases.

    "text": "Rain helps firefighters slow New Mexico blazes as Biden approves disaster relief At least two people have died after the blaze devastated southern parts of the US state. More than 1,000 firefighters in the US state of New Mexico took advantage of a break in the weather to gain the upper hand – for now – on a pair of wildfires that have killed two people, destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands to flee. President Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration for parts of southern New Mexico, freeing up funding and more resources as crews worked to keep the flames from spreading. Their efforts have received a boost from a storm system that brought with it rain, hail and cooler temperatures to the mountain village of Ruidoso and other parts of the state. “The fire has lost momentum,” Arthur Gonzales, the fire behaviour analyst for the federal attack team, told residents at a community meeting in Alamogordo on Thursday night. “We still have a lot of work to do, but it’s really changed that fire behaviour,” he added, noting that very little growth in the blaze is expected over the next few days. But firefighters know this is a brief respite given the tinderbox conditions that helped fuel the fires in the first place. Within days, the fires have consumed an area half the size of Washington, DC. “What we’re really focusing on now at this point is: when might we see this return to active fire spread?” Mr Gonzales said. “Is there potential for this to start picking up and moving again?” Federal and local officials said evacuation orders likely would remain in place for days in some places as crews snuff out hot spots around Ruidoso. Law enforcement officers are also patrolling the streets to keep potential looters away. Despite some reports that the fires were caused by human activity, federal incident commander Dave Gessar said the causes are under investigation and remain “undetermined”. The federal disaster declaration will help with recovery efforts, including temporary housing, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property and other emergency work in Lincoln County and on lands belonging to the Mescalero Apache Tribe. Residents fled the larger of the two fires with little notice as it swept into neighbourhoods on Monday. More areas were evacuated on Tuesday as the fire ballooned, consuming homes nestled among the the ponderosa pines that dominate the hillsides. An estimated 1,400 structures have been destroyed or damaged, and Ruidoso mayor Lynn Crawford has estimated about half of these were homes. Whole portions of some communities were lost, he said. “These are things that are burnt to the foundations and all the trees around it,” he said. “It’s devastating.” Authorities say a 60-year-old man who died was found near the popular Swiss Chalet Inn in Ruidoso. His family said he had arranged for a lift from friends but they were unable to get to him on Monday since the roads were blocked. It appeared he was overcome after he tried to set out on foot. On Wednesday, officers discovered the skeletal remains of an unidentified second person in the driver’s seat of a burned vehicle. A couple of residents have been driving around Ruidoso and neighbouring Alto, providing reports via social media of what they are seeing. There are locations where the ground was turned to ash, the trees were blackened and homes were reduced to their foundations, with only fireplaces remaining. Much of the US south-west has been exceedingly dry and hot in recent months. Those conditions, along with strong winds, whipped the flames out of control, rapidly advancing the South Fork Fire into Ruidoso in a matter of hours. Evacuations extended to hundreds of homes, businesses, a regional medical centre and the Ruidoso Downs horse track. Nationwide, wildfires have scorched more than 3,344 square miles this year – a figure higher than the 10-year average, according to the National Interagency Fire Centre. Nearly 20 wildfires burning in California, Arizona, Colorado and Washington state and elsewhere are considered large and uncontained.",

    "text": "Un estudio científico advirtió que la Luna \"dejará de ser visible\" desde la Tierra para luego desaparecer de la órbita con efectos complejos para el entorno y para los ritmos circadianos que determinan la duración de los días.Es que, de acuerdo al reporte astronómico compartido por la especialista Sarah Romero en la revista Muy Interesante, el principal satélite natural terrestre podría comenzar a perder claridad. Impresionante Descubrimiento arqueológico: hallan una nueva civilización en Latinoamérica Hallazgo Descubrimiento sorprendente: astrofísicos encuentran un túnel interestelar en el Sistema Solar. ¿A dónde conduce? ¿Cuándo va a separarse la Luna de la Tierra?La Luna se aleja de la Tierra a una velocidad de 3,78 centímetros por año, fenómeno que ocurre desde que se formaron ambos cuerpos celestes. Aunque este proceso se considera \"extremadamente lento\", su impacto se acumula con el tiempo. Ahora, la investigación científica alertó que, si este ritmo se mantiene, podría dejar de ser perceptible \"a simple vista\" dentro de aproximadamente 50.000 millones de años.Este distanciamiento se debe a la interacción entre la rotación terrestre y las mareas oceánicas, que genera fricción y desacelera gradualmente la rotación del planeta. Por ello, a medida que la Tierra reduce su velocidad, la Luna se aleja en respuesta. Un estudio explica que la Luna podría desaparecer. ¿Cuáles son las consecuencias de que la Luna se aleje de la Tierra?Más allá de la pérdida de visibilidad de la Luna, su distanciamiento progresivo podría tener efectos significativos en la Tierra a lo largo del tiempo vinculados a los entornos naturales y al tiempo.Duración del díaLos seres vivos, incluidos los humanos, están adaptados a un ciclo de 24 horas. Si el alejamiento de la Luna continua, la rotación de la Tierra seguirá desacelerándose, lo que podría llevar a que los días se alarguen a 25 horas. Este cambio requeriría una adaptación en los ritmos circadianos de muchas especies.Es oficial: declararon el martes 19 de noviembre feriado y habrá un nuevo fin de semana largo de 4 díasSe cumplió la predicción de Elon Musk: su profecía sobre los hogares ya es toda una realidad Impacto en el ambientePese a que, en el corto plazo, los efectos son mínimos, con el tiempo, la prolongación de los días y la alteración de los ciclos naturales podrían generar cambios significativos en el entorno terrestre y en la vida tal como la conocemos. El estudio concluyó: \"Si bien este proceso ocurre en una escala temporal que es difícil de concebir, sus implicaciones podrían ser profundas\". Los autores remarcaron también que la posibilidad de que la Luna deje de ser visible \"es un recordatorio de los cambios constantes en el universo y de cómo estos pueden impactar la vida en la Tierra\".",

    "text": "In a significant development, the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) has signed a tripartite peace pact with the Union and Assam governments, marking an end to decades-long insurgency in the state.The agreement, inked in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, aims to address various political, economic, and social challenges in Assam.Amit Shah has assured the ULFA representatives that the government would implement the agreement in a time-bound manner and that a committee, working with the Assam government, will oversee the fulfilment of the agreement.As part of the accord, a substantial development package will be provided to Assam.The peace pact will also secure cultural safeguards and land rights for the indigenous people of the state.Assam has seen prolonged suffering due to militancy and ULFA violence, which claimed 10,000 lives since 1979.However, the ULFA's hardline wing, led by Paresh Baruah, did not participate in the accord, as Baruah has consistently rejected government overtures.This development comes after the ULFA faction, led by Arabinda Rajkhowa, initiated unconditional discussions with the central government in 2011.The ULFA, founded in 1979, had advocated for a 'sovereign Assam' and has been involved in subversive activities, leading to its prohibition by the central government in 1990.Follow ABP Live for more such news and the latest updates from Assam and Northeast India.",

    "title": "Storm Gerrit Hits UK: Thousands Left Without Power, Travel Disrupted",
    "text": "As Storm Gerrit continues to batter the United Kingdom, the country is grappling with widespread disruptions. The severe weather event has left thousands of households without power and\ncaused significant travel chaos, with more than 200 flood alerts and warnings still in place.\nBritish Airways, one of the UK’s leading airlines, was forced to cancel over 20 flights to and from London Heathrow on Thursday due to the adverse weather conditions. The storm’s impact is not limited to air travel; ferry services to various destinations, including the Hebrides, France, and the Isle of Wight, are also facing potential delays and cancellations.\nThe British Meteorological Office stated the severity of the storm: “Last night a supercell thunderstorm crossed Greater Manchester causing damage. We know from our Doppler radar that it had a strong rotating updraft.” The statement further suggested the likelihood of a tornado at the surface, although this has yet to be confirmed with surface data.\nThe effects of Storm Gerrit have been felt across various regions, with the Northeast and Shetland being particularly hard hit. Approximately 14,000 homes in these areas are currently without power. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks are working tirelessly to restore electricity, but some households might face power outages until tomorrow.\nThe storm has not only affected power supplies but also disrupted several rail lines and roads. Scotrail, after assessing the damage on Thursday morning, confirmed that key rail lines across the country remain inaccessible. This includes critical routes such as Aberdeen to Edinburgh, Glasgow to Oban, and Edinburgh to Dundee, near St. Andrews.\nThe disruption caused by Storm Gerrit highlights the increasing challenges posed by extreme weather events in the UK. The frequency and intensity of such storms have been on the rise, prompting concerns about the resilience of the country’s infrastructure and the need for more robust emergency response plans.\nThe impact on daily life is significant. For those without power, the situation is more than an inconvenience; it’s a matter of safety and comfort, especially during cold weather. The\ndisruption to travel not only affects commuters and travelers but also has a ripple effect on the economy, particularly in regions reliant on tourism and transportation.\nAuthorities are urging residents to stay informed and prepared. They recommend avoiding unnecessary travel, securing loose items outdoors, and following safety advice from local councils and emergency services. For those affected by power outages, it’s advised to have emergency supplies on hand and to check on vulnerable neighbors.\nThe response to Storm Gerrit also underscores the importance of investing in infrastructure that can withstand such extreme weather events. This includes strengthening power grids, improving drainage systems, and ensuring that transportation networks have contingency plans in place.\nAs the UK continues to face the wrath of Storm Gerrit, the focus remains on ensuring the safety of its residents and minimizing disruptions. The situation is a stark reminder of the power of nature and the need for preparedness and resilience in the face of increasingly unpredictable weather patterns.",
