    "title": "New California laws protect employees using cannabis away from work",
    "text": "Starting in the new year, California employers will be barred from asking workers about their use of cannabis outside of work, and from discriminating against them because of it. Two bills signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in the past couple of years aim to strengthen the state's legal cannabis industry by updating outdated laws. Assembly Bill 2188, which Newsom signed in 2022, will prohibit employers from using the results of hair or urine tests for marijuana -- which can detect traces of cannabis for days or weeks -- in their decisions to hire, fire or penalize workers. When the governor signed AB 2188 along with other cannabis-related bills in 2022, he said in a news release that \"rigid bureaucracy and federal prohibition continue to pose challenges to the industry and consumers.\" Senate Bill 700, which Newsom signed this year, clarifies AB 2188 by amending the state's Fair Employment and Housing Act to bar employers from asking job applicants about their prior use of cannabis. People are also reading… California NORML, a nonprofit organization that advocates for consumer rights related to cannabis, sponsored AB 2188. In its argument supporting the bill, the organization said hair or urine testing for marijuana does not detect actual impairment, a fact the federal government has acknowledged. \"Studies indicate that metabolite tests for past use of marijuana are useless in protecting job safety,\" the group said. The exceptions under AB 2188 would be for workers in the building and construction industry and for job applicants and employees in positions that require a federal background investigation or clearance. The National Federation of Independent Business lists the new laws among the top five \"compliance headaches\" for California's small business owners in 2024. California Chamber of Commerce opposed AB 2188, though it removed its \"job killer\" label after some revisions, saying before the bill was signed that employers risk liability when they \"take legitimate disciplinary measures\" against employees. \"Employers must be able to keep their workplace safe by disciplining employees who arrive at work impaired,\" the group said. But AB 2188 does not prevent employers from using other tests to detect impairment, such as blood tests. SB 700 accounts for employers' rights to ask about an applicant's criminal history, but the employer may not discriminate against an applicant when it finds information about past use of cannabis-related to criminal history unless otherwise permitted by law. In 1996, California became the first state to legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes, and the state's voters legalized its recreational use in 2016. Recreational use of marijuana is now legal in 24 states and Washington, D.C.

    "text": "I continue to read letters concerning snow removal; most are critical, and some are supportive. My experience indicates a pretty dismal effort, not because of the snow removal personnel but despite them. It appears management at state and municipality have trimmed down the efforts to achieve savings and we are now paying the price. That is my grasp of the facts without firm support. I would love to see a comparison of past levels of effort to current levels of effort. Perhaps an inflation-adjusted comparison of snow removal budgets from 2000, 2005, 2010, 2020, and present to include funded positions and numbers of equipment. Perhaps the editors might take on an investigative effort to make these comparisons. If they are essentially equal, then we are good and it is just the snow levels. However, if my hunch is right and the level of effort has decreased over time, then that speaks for itself. — Michael L. Mott Eagle River Have something on your mind?

    "text": "AXTELL, Neb. — According to the CDC, from about 2011 to 2023, there were almost no bird flu cases detected in people, but if you take a look at the numbers for this year, things have changed dramatically.\n“They’re in the eastern part of the state, so Nemaha County over on the eastern edge of Nebraska had an infection. And then Sarpy County and Lancaster County had them,” Ron Seymour, UNL Extension Educator, said.\nSeymour added that H5N1 spreads easily and can be deadly to poultry.\n\"There's about seven different strains of bird flu that is out there, and it is highly communicable. It spread in our environment by wildlife, primarily by birds that are migrating so ducks and geese,\" Seymour said.\n“On poultry, specifically, I mean, they say if they get the flu virus, they can start to not feel well, you can see that they're not drinking water. They might have a runny nose or a cough, just kind of like humans if they get a cold or any other virus like that. And then they have, rest, respiratory issues, they can get watery eyes, and they can die very easily and very quickly,” Seymour said.\nSeymour said that you should drink pasteurized milk, and farmers should use good sanitation practices like routinely washing your hands and wearing an N95 mask around livestock and poultry.",
