    "text": "© AFP إيلون ماسك في لوس أنجليس في كاليفورنيا في 13 نيسان/أبريل 2024\n© ا ف ب/ا ف ب/ارشيف إتيين لوران\nسان فرانسيسكو (الولايات المتحدة) (أ ف ب) – اتهم إيلون ماسك “آبل” بتفضيل “أوبن إيه آي” ومساعدها للذكاء الاصطناعي “تشات جي بي تي” في متجر التطبيقات التابع لها App Store، مهددا الشركة التي تتخذ في كاليفورنيا مقرا باتخاذ إجراءات قانونية ضدها.\nوكتب الملياردير الثلاثاء على صفحته عبر منصة إكس “تتصرف آبل بطريقة تجعل من المستحيل على أي شركة ذكاء اصطناعي أخرى غير +أوبن إيه آي+ الوصول إلى المركز الأول في متجر التطبيقات، وهو انتهاك واضح لقواعد المنافسة”.\nوأضاف أن شركته “إكس إيه آي” التي طورت مساعد الذكاء الاصطناعي “غروك” ستتخذ “إجراء قانونيا على الفور”.\nيتيح متجر التطبيقات App Stpre تنزيل التطبيقات على أجهزة آبل. تُعد هذه المنصة بالغة الأهمية للناشرين الذين يتطلعون إلى جذب المستهلكين.\nتٌبين هذه المنصة للمستخدمين قائمة بأكثر التطبيقات شيوعا عليها راهنا، في فئات مختلفة، استنادا بشكل خاص إلى المراجعات والتقييمات وعدد التنزيلات.\nولم تستجب آبل التي لا تُقدم سوى معلومات قليلة عن معاييرها، لاستفسارات تقدمت بها وكالة فرانس برس.\nأثارت اتهامات إيلون ماسك جدلا حادا على “إكس” بين مديري “إكس إيه آي” ومدير “أوبن إيه آي” سام ألتمان.\nكتب ألتمان ردا على منشور إيلون ماسك “هذا ادعاءٌ لافتٌ للنظر، بالنظر إلى ما سمعته عن تلاعب إيلون بـ+إكس+ لمصلحته الشخصية ومصلحة شركاته، ولإلحاق الضرر بمنافسيه وبالأشخاص الذين لا يحبهم”.\nورد إيلون ماسك بأن “سام ألتمان يكذب كما يتنفس”، واصفا منشوره بأنه “هراء”.\nفي منشور إيلون ماسك الأول، أضاف المستخدمون أيضا ملاحظات سياق (نظام لمكافحة المعلومات المضللة على إكس) استشهدوا فيها بمقالاتٍ صحفية بعناوين مثل “في كانون الثاني/يناير 2025، كان +ديب سيك+ التطبيق الأول في جميع الفئات على متجر التطبيقات”.\nDeepSeek شركة صينية ناشئة في مجال الذكاء الاصطناعي اكتسبت شهرةً واسعةً بفضل مساعد الذكاء الاصطناعي الذي يحمل اسمها.\nكان إيلون ماسك جزءا من الفريق المكون من 11 شخصا الذي أسس “أوبن إيه آي” عام 2015، وقدم تمويلا أوليا بقيمة 45 مليون دولار.\nلكنه ترك الشركة عام 2018، واستمر في مهاجمتها منذ النجاح الباهر لتطبيق “تشات جي بي تي” أواخر عام 2022.\nوقد اتخذ إجراءات قانونية ضد الشركة النجمة بين مجموعات التكنولوجيا العملاقة في سيليكون فالي حاليا بتهمة خيانة المبادئ التي تأسست عليها، وعرض أيضا الاستحواذ عليها.\nومثل غيرها من شركات التكنولوجيا العملاقة، تواجه “آبل” إجراءات قانونية من سلطات المنافسة الأميركية والأوروبية.\nيشكل متجر التطبيقات الخاص بها محور نزاع مستمر منذ سنوات مع شركة “إبيك غايمز” ناشرة لعبة الفيديو “فورتنايت”.\nوبحسب “إبيك غايمز” ومطورين آخرين، تحتكر غوغل وآبل سوق تطبيقات الأجهزة المحمولة بنظامي التشغيل “آي او اس” و”اندرويد”، وهما تسيئان استخدام هيمنتهما من خلال فرض منصات تنزيل ودفع خاصة بهما، وفرض رسوم باهظة على إنفاق المستخدمين.\nقضت محكمة أميركية في أواخر عام 2021 بأنه لم يعد بإمكان آبل إجبار ناشري التطبيقات على استخدام متجر التطبيقات ونظام الدفع الخاص بها.",

People were being warned to not eat shellfish from those areas. The ministry's deputy director-general of food safety Vincent Arbuckle said extreme weather could be a factor in the increasing growth of agal blooms. \"It may well be weather-related or could well be the result of Cyclone Gabrielle and extreme weather events earlier in the year. \"After extreme flooding you'll get more nutrients in the water around the coast and agal blooms do occur when you get high nutrient run-off.\" An algae-like organism called Okeania spp was discovered on beaches on the southern side of Waiheke Island, he said. \"Okeania spp is a cyanobacteria that forms dark-coloured mats of slimy material when it washes up on the beach. As these cynobacterial mats decompose, they turn into a stinky sludge. \"It can also produce a toxin called Lyngbyatoxin-A, which can cause skin and eye irritation and respiratory issues.\" Affected shellfish included bivalve shellfish such as mussels, oysters, tuatua, pipi, toheroa, cockles, and scallops, as well as pūpū (cat's eyes), Cook's turban and kina (sea urchin), said Arbuckle. \"The risks of this toxin contaminating shellfish is unknown, so this warning is precautionary until we can find out more. It's important to note that cooking shellfish will not destroy biotoxins. \"At this stage, finfish are not included in this public health warning, but we advise people to gut the fish and discard the liver before cooking.\" Meanwhile, testing of shellfish for areas in Kawhia and Northland found elevated levels paralyctic shellfish toxins which could cause symptoms such as numbness, a tingling (prickly feeling) around the mouth, face, hands, and feet, difficulty swallowing or breathing, dizziness and headache, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, paralysis and respiratory failure and, in severe cases, death. The ministry has detected high levels of toxin-producing phytoplankton in Northland, as well as an Alexandrium pacificum bloom in Kawhia. In both cases, Arbuckle said cooking the shellfish did not remove the toxin. But pāua, crab and crayfish could still be eaten if the gut was completely removed prior to cooking, as toxins accumulate in the gut, said the ministry. If the gut is not removed, its contents could contaminate the meat during the cooking process.",

Segundo Renato, o [Grêmio](/futebol/time/_/id/6273/gremio) já tem sido prejudicado por conta das tragédias que abalaram o Rio Grande do Sul neste ano. Sem atuar em casa e fazendo longas viagens, o Grêmio ocupa a zona de rebaixamento. Na próxima rodada, a equipe vai enfrentar o [Vasco](/futebol/time/_/id/3454/vasco-da-gama), que não atuou na rodada por causa de o adversário, na ocasião o [Cuiabá](/futebol/time/_/id/17313/cuiaba), ter compromisso pela [CONMEBOL Sul-Americana](/futebol/liga/_/nome/conmebol.sudamericana). \"E o Grêmio, infelizmente, deixou mais dois pontos aqui. O que mais eu posso falar? O Grêmio não venceu porque, mais uma vez, o [Corinthians](/futebol/time/_/id/874/corinthians) não precisa disso. É vergonha para o futebol brasileiro, para a CBF. O presidente da CBF está aonde? Em Paris, e as coisas estão acontecendo aqui no Brasil. O que a gente vai fazer? Continuar trabalhando contra tudo e contra todos, essa é a realidade. Contra tudo e contra todos\". \"Agora vamos jantar dentro do vestiário, vamos até o aeroporto, pegar um voo que vai sair às 2 da manhã para Chapecó. Sabe-se lá a hora que vamos chegar, sabe-se lá que horas o grupo vai dormir, mas ninguém quer saber disso. O Vasco não jogou durante a semana, só está esperando a gente na boa. O Grêmio jogou na quinta e no domingo, e a CBF não está nem aí, claro que não está. A gente tem que nadar contra a maré. A gente trabalha, trabalha, trabalha, para chegar na hora do jogo e colher os frutos, aí chega na hora, o que a gente colhe? Colhe essa vergonha aí\", disparou. Sobre o VAR, Renato Gaúcho voltou a disparar críticas aos árbitros que estão no vídeo. O técnico chamou esses profissionais de 'idiotas'. \"Mas esse tal de VAR é difícil, é difícil de entender. Eles têm as ferramentas e não sabem usar. Não sabem usar ou estão mal-intencionados. Cada um tem a sua opinião. O treinador e jogador falam e são julgados, aí você vê alguns idiotas no VAR, que fazem um monte de m***, e no outro jogo está no VAR de novo. Isso quando não estão dentro de campo apitando. O que a gente vai fazer? O nosso presidente da CBF em Paris, e a gente vendo essas palhaçadas. Em toda rodada a gente vê uma ou mais de uma palhaçada. O Corinthians é grande, não precisa disso, não é culpado de nada\", disparou. Renata Ruel, comentarista de arbitragem dos canais ESPN, afirmou que o Grêmio [tem razão em reclamar da arbitragem por conta do pênalti marcado](/futebol/brasileirao/artigo/_/id/13952899/corinthians-gremio-renata-ruel-ve-razao-reclamacao-penalti-var-brasileiro-segue-sendo-vergonha) ao Corinthians.

During the meeting, he said that as many as 60 people fell ill suffering with diarrhoea in the past few days, out of which 39 people are still receiving treatment at various hospitals.\nIt may be noted that the drinking water is supplied to these areas through a 16 km Krishna water pipeline. Along with this, as many as seven power bores and 36 hand bores are present in the region.\nThe water supply was halted for a few days due to pipeline repair works, following which the people consumed bore water.\nThe minister informed that nitrite traces were found in the bore water. Though the Krishna water pipeline supply has been resumed, diarrhoea cases are being reported.\nIn order to find out the reason for the issue, water samples have been sent to laboratories in Vijayawada and the reason for the increasing cases will be ascertained in the next couple of days.\nStating that the negligence of the previous YSRC government led to dire conditions in the State, he said that the funds allotted by Asia Infra Bank and AMRUT scheme have been neglected.\nThe former YSRC government has failed to give matching funds and as a result, `3,500 crore funds were not released, which would have been utilised to lay roads and supply safe drinkig water in the majority of municipalities in the State.

Si las auroras son provocadas por el sol, como tengo entendido, ¿qué ha cambiado en ciclo solar que las pueda estar provocando?.\nCuriosidad desde el desconocimiento.\n[#6](c6#c-6) No tiene porque ser solo el sol, el campo magnético de la tierra también cambia y fluctúa.\n[#1](c1#c-1) He visto suficientes películas de desastres como para saber que despues se viene el apocalipsis.\n[#1](c1#c-1) a mi lo que me escama es que el Friker Jiménez que ha dedicado en el pasado programas al \"peligro\" de las tormentas solares haya pasado de puntillas sobre este tema de las auroras boreales tan tan al Sur (cuando ocurrieron por primera vez hace unas semanas y supongo que ahora igual), cuando debería dedicarle un programa entero con ejjjjpertos y teorías a cascoporro... lo que me lleva a pensar que si ni siquiera los \"magufos oficiales\" le prestan atención, es que algo \"gordo\" viene y está aún más tapado que de costumbre....\n[#1](c1#c-1) Aquí lo tienes\n.\n[#7](c7#c-7) [#9](c9#c-9) [#24](c24#c-24) [#26](c26#c-26) \"Si es bien cierto que las auroras boreales en España en realidad no son improbables, lo que sí es una circunstancia que parece única es que en un mismo año hayamos disfrutado de dos espectáculos similares. \"\nParece que a lo que se refiere es que no hay precedentes de que hayan ocurrido dos veces en un mismo año... pero vete tú a saber...\n[#35](c35#c-35) Perdón, no entré a ver los tuits de la noticia. Hablaba por tuits que vi por la mañana al despertar. Con fotos y comentarios que hablaban de las 04:00... Pero bueno, era broma. Si sé a ciencia cierta que va a haber semejante espectáculo estoy despierto yo y hasta despierto a mi hija de cinco años para que lo vea.\n[#39](c39#c-39) Los cometas si no se ven muy bien a simple vista no me llaman tanto la atención. Recuerdo de joven, allá por el ¿96?, el Hale-Bopp que se veía a enorme a simple vista. Aquello si que era un espectáculo...\nY hará 10 años hice mis pinitos de astrofotografía con un telescopio Dobson y la reflex... cómo mola fotografiar tus propias galaxias\nIgual el problema es que ya no tengo telescopio y los últimos cometas los he visto con prismáticos. Sacar fotos del cometa con un telescopio+reflex igual si que era interesante... pero esa afición ya pasó. Ya no hay tiempo para ir de noche a pasar frío jejeje\n[#17](c17#c-17) mmm... no.\n[#17](c17#c-17) No.\n[#17](c17#c-17) Antes comamos unos gambones al vapor.\n[#9](c9#c-9) a esto venía\nEn España lo tenemos todo para el turista. A partir del 2024 incluimos auroras boreales en el catálogo.\nEsto el Ministerio de Igualdad lo iguala rápido.\neso es culpa de los aviones que nos fumigan",

    "title": "Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck’s divorce progresses: U-Haul truck seen at mansion",
    "text": "A U-Haul truck was spotted outside Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck’s sprawling Beverly Hills mansion on Thursday, signaling a significant step in their divorce proceedings. Reports reveal that Lopez, who no longer feels comfortable in the grand estate, is moving out. The insider shared with People that the mansion, purchased for their blended family, has become too large and emotionally charged for the Bronx-born singer. Lopez has been searching for a new home since May but has yet to find a suitable replacement. Meanwhile, Affleck recently closed on a $20.5 million Brentwood mansion on July 24, which also coincided with Lopez’s 55th birthday. The couple, who legally separated on April 26, initially bought the 12-bedroom, 24-bathroom Crestview Manor for $60.85 million in May 2023. The estate, perched on a five-acre promontory, now seems to be a reminder of their past rather than a shared future. The former couple who are reportedly carrying a $20 million mortgage on the property, enlisted The Agency realtor Santiago Arana in May to discreetly sell the mansion. It was publicly listed on MLS for a staggering $68 million on July 11, but has yet to find a buyer. The estate also includes a 5,000-square-foot guest penthouse, a caretaker house, and a two-bedroom guard house. Adding to the complexity, Lopez filed for divorce on August 20, marking what would have been the second anniversary of their wedding at Affleck's $8.9 million, 87-acre property in Georgia. Without a prenuptial agreement, all assets acquired during the marriage are considered community property.
