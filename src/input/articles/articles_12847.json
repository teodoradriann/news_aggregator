    "title": "De la grippe aviaire à la pandémie humaine : que disent les dernières études sur le virus H5N1 ?",
    "text": "Un adolescent positif au virus H5N1 est en réanimation dans un hôpital du Canada. Les autorités sanitaires enquêtent sur l’origine de sa contamination, tandis que se réveillent les questions autour de la possibilité d’une pandémie humaine de grippe aviaire. Le point avec le professeur Hervé Fleury, virologue\nPourquo[i le cas du jeune garçon positif au H5N1 au Canada](/sante/grippe-aviaire/grippe-aviaire-un-premier-cas-humain-identifie-au-canada-22100066.php), et actuellement en soins intensifs, inquiète-t-il les autorités sanitaires ?\nDéjà sa vie est actuellement en suspens. Les équipes médicales cherchent à comprendre comment et par quoi il a été contaminé. Des tests sont effectués sur les animaux domestiques autour de lui, et même sur les personnes de son entourage. De façon préventive, l’entourage du jeune homme a été placé sous médicaments antiviraux. L’enquête sera décisive et les conclusions pourraient faire basculer nos certitudes, à savoir que la contamination interhumaine n’a pas encore été démontrée. D’où l’inquiétude des autorités sanitaires du Canada.\nComment s’est implanté ce virus H5N1 et quid de son évolution ?\nIl vient des oiseaux sauvages, avant de se transmettre aux oiseaux domestiques, les canards par exemple. Actuellement dans les Landes, il y a deux foyers de grippe aviaire. Désormais, on sait qu’il se transmet aux mammifères, les phoques du Chili ont été contaminés en 2023, puis les vaches aux États-Unis. Les chats de ferme ont été également contaminés après avoir bu du lait de vache cru. Et ça, c’est un phénomène marquant : observer que le lait cru contient du virus. Évidemment, le lait pasteurisé est débarrassé de tout risque. Très récemment, le virus H5N1 a été retrouvé chez un porc aux États-Unis.\nMutations du virus\nEn fait, ce virus H5N1 s’adapte et mute régulièrement. À quel moment pourrait-il être à l’origine d’une contagion entre humains ?\nC’est une hypothèse. On peut remarquer que ce virus à une mutation dans une protéine PB2 qui s’adapte aux mammifères, le fait qu’un porc ait été contaminé n’est pas une bonne nouvelle, car on sait que le porc est l’intermédiaire entre les virus humains et les virus d’oiseaux. On peut en effet craindre que le porc transmette à l’homme un virus adapté ou muté, ce qui entraînerait une pandémie.\nLes porcs ont-ils été à l’origine d’épidémies humaines ?\nEn 2009, l’épidémie dite « mexicaine » de grippe A, causée par le sous-type H1N1 : quatre virus différents recombinés. On peut craindre cette fois une recombinaison à partir du H5N1, via les porcs, pourquoi pas. Les scientifiques sont actuellement en cours de réflexion sur cette possibilité, jusque-là rien n’est prouvé.\nDans l’hypothèse où une pandémie H5N1 deviendrait possible, quelles seraient les parades ?\nLes États-Unis sont en train d’analyser les eaux des égouts et font des tests PCR pour mesurer l’éventuelle présence du virus, sachant qu’on a trouvé des traces dans les eaux des égouts d’Hawaï, mais impossible pour l’instant de savoir si ces traces de virus viennent des animaux, oiseaux ou hommes… Les Américains ont un stock fédéral de vaccins contre le H5N1 et le laboratoire Moderna synthétise un vaccin ARN contre le H5N1, en Europe, deux autres laboratoires travaillent aussi à fabriquer des vaccins. Nous sommes dans l’anticipation. Le risque que ce virus s’adapte à l’homme existe, il ne faut pas être alarmiste mais réaliste.",

(ANI File Photo) New Delhi: A 24/7 flood control room has been set up by the Delhi government to monitor real-time data from the Hathni Kund Barrage from where Yamuna water is released to Delhi.\nDelhi government ministers, Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj, made an announcement at a joint press conference in New Delhi. This followed a session of the principal committee tasked with overseeing, advising, and coordinating flood control initiatives in the National Capital Territory.\nThey stated that the flood control room would be staffed by officials from various agencies, such as the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), and the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC).\n“Last year, the Yamuna reached to its highest levels in 70 years. The Delhi government is gearing up to tackle any possibility of floods. The control room is in touch with officials at Hathini Kund barrage from where Yamuna river discharge is received. After the release of one lakh cusec of water, relief and rescue machinery starts working,” said Atishi, Delhi water minister.\n“We took the stake of the preparations of Delhi govt and all the concerned departments regarding flood relief and flood control. We hope that the flood situation doesn’t occur in Delhi. But, if the level of water in Yamuna rises, Delhi govt is ready to deal with that,” said Atishi.\nMinister for Health-Urban Development Saurabh Bharadwaj said the control room will monitor data in real-time and will be entirely computerised.\n(With PTI inputs)",

    "text": "All Blacks rookie Tamaiti Williams and his partner Alice Weir are the parents of a baby girl born more than three months early. Kaea Kate Williams was born 12 days ago at 27 weeks gestation and weighing “only... 1.4 pounds [0.63kg]”, wrote Williams and Weir under a photo of their new daughter they posted to Instagram late last week. “We welcomed our little princess Kaea Kate Williams on 07/04/24″, the Crusaders tighthead prop and his partner wrote, accompanied by a love heart emoji. “Alice and baby are doing really well! But we have a long road ahead!” The black-and-white image shows Williams , 24, touching his new daughter inside her incubator. The newborn’s fingers sit on the middle joint of her dad’s right index finger as the All Blacks’ left hand rests across her tiny body. “We appreciate all the prayers, love and support,” the couple wrote on the joint post, which received 4632 likes and more than 270 comments. The Herald asked Williams via his Crusaders Super Rugby Pacific franchise if he wanted to comment further about Kaea’s arrival. “Tams is keen to hold off for a couple of weeks before talking publicly about it”, a Crusaders’ spokesman said. “As you can imagine it’s a tender time for him and his family.” Several All Blacks were among those posting words of support to Whāngārei-born Williams and Weir following their announcement on Instagram. Ardie Savea offered his best wishes. “Congrats usoo - prayers and love fams”, wrote Savea, the All Blacks’ 70th test captain. Dalton Papali’i and Sevu Reece also left heartfelt messages for their All Blacks teammate. “Congrats my brother! Sending all love”, wrote Papali’i, while Sevu Reece offered “blessings and prayers to you and the girls”. A pregnancy term is normally about 40 weeks. A baby born before the 37th week of gestation is known as a premature or preterm baby . In New Zealand, about 7 to 10 per cent of babies are born prematurely. They are among an estimated 15 million babies born prematurely around the globe each year, according to the World Health Organisation. Premature babies usually spend longer in hospital after birth, cared for by specialists in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). New Zealand has more than 24 NICU units in hospitals around the country. The youngest age at which babies can be looked after is about 23 weeks’ gestation. Cherie Howie is an Auckland-based reporter who joined the Herald in 2011. She has been a journalist for more than 20 years and specialises in general news and features.",

This initiative provides essential certifications leveraging the Medical Device Discovery Appraisal Program (MDDAP), equipping appraisers to grow in their careers, access new revenue opportunities, and contribute to continuous improvement efforts within the industry.\nMDDAP launches innovative learning pathway to enhance appraisal expertise within the medical device sector.\n[Share]\nMDDAP is a tailored version of the CMMI framework and provides a model and method by which medical device manufactures can better understand, measure, and improve their capability to develop high quality devices. VIP, which is a specialized program developed in tandem with the FDA, the medical device industry, and the Medical Device Innovation Consortium (MDIC), uses MDDAP as a key component to support medical device makers.\nThe MDDAP certifications entail a mix of coursework, observations, and apprenticeships for those who want to become an MDDAP Appraisal Team Member (ATM) or MDDAP Appraisal Team Lead (ATL). MDDAP launched the ATL certification at the end of March with the development of a new self-paced, eLearning course and Observation process, opening the door for MedTech professionals to join the growing community of MDDAP appraisers.\n“Through this new learning pathway, those earning an MDDAP certification not only have the potential to expand their business offerings, reach new clients, and become more skilled in their profession with new training, but also have the opportunity to contribute to the safety and efficacy of medical devices and patient outcomes,” says Kim Kaplan, ISACA Principal Product Manager, MDDAP.\nBecoming an MDDAP Appraisal Team Member (ATM)\nFor those wanting to become an MDDAP Appraisal Team Member (ATM)—an individual who has the prerequisite experience and training to participate and support an appraisal of an organization against the MDDAP tailored view of the CMMI framework—the certification is valid for a three-year period upon completing the following steps.\n- After applying and then completing a program interview, prospective MDDAP Appraisal Team Members (ATMs) then continue with two classes—the Building Organizational Capability course, a virtual, four-day introductory course, and the MDDAP Concepts eLearning course, which prepares learners to participate in an MDDAP appraisal.\n- After the candidate completes a professional services agreement, they move to the ATM observation stage, an in-the-field evaluation of candidates during which they apply the knowledge they obtained during training.\n- Lastly, during the apprenticeship stage, individuals engage in on-the-job training with a coach over the course of one to four additional appraisals.\n- After becoming an MDDAP ATM, certified individuals will be able to facilitate discussions, generate notes, and validate and obtain consensus around results.\nBecoming an MDDAP Appraisal Team Lead (ATL)\nAfter earning their MDDAP ATM certification, interested individuals can pursue the MDDAP Appraisal Team Lead (ATL) certification, expanding the pool of professionals eligible to earn the credential.\n- After applying for the ATL certification, candidates participate in the Medical Device Discovery Appraisal Program (MDDAP) Appraisal Team Lead Training Course, which prepares them to lead an MDDAP appraisal. The course covers MDDAP appraisal quality and ethics, the roles and responsibilities of appraisal participants, how to use the MDDAP Method Definition Document (M-MDD), how MDDAP appraisals can be used to evaluate and improve business performance, and the key aspects of the MDDAP appraisal approach.\n- Learners will complete this course feeling prepared to lead their first MDDAP appraisal and ready to schedule their ATL observation.\n- Following this observation, candidates are offered additional coaching through an apprenticeship stage to earn their ATL certification.\nIndividuals who complete the ATL certification will be able to lead an appraisal of an organization against the MDDAP tailored view of the CMMI Framework, including scoping the level of effort, setting the objectives, creating the plan, schedule, logistics, resource management, and risk mitigation - plus managing the appraisal team to support the effort.\nAnother path to the ATL is the MDDAP Appraisal Team Lead Bootcamp, which takes prospective ATLs on the full journey from Building Organizational Capability through Appraisal Team Lead Coaching in one year.\n“Those who pursue this learning pathway have the opportunity to be on the ground floor of a growing and developing program,” says Simona Rollinson, ISACA Chief Operating Officer. “MDDAP certification holders will be able to work with some of the top medical device manufacturers around the world—helping these organizations build capability to save lives and produce higher quality products.”\nLearn more about VIP and MDDAP here: https://www.isaca.org/mddap#overview.

    "text": "AWS’ Ocelot chip: A Quantum Leap Towards Error-Free Computing? A groundbreaking advancement at the AWS City IT Center at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has yielded a new chip, dubbed “Ocelot,” poised too revolutionize quantum computing. This innovative chip promises to significantly reduce errors,a major obstacle in the advancement of quantum technology,potentially unlocking breakthroughs across diverse fields. The Ocelot chip represents a pivotal step toward making quantum computers more reliable and practical, addressing a critical challenge that has long plagued the field.\nThe Promise of Quantum Computing Quantum computers possess the exceptional potential to tackle complex problems that are simply beyond the reach of classical computers. Their ability to “concurrently analyze a huge number of potential results, and carry out calculations in a few minutes rather of millions of years” opens up unprecedented possibilities. This immense processing power could revolutionize various sectors, including medicine, materials science, and artificial intelligence, paving the way for groundbreaking discoveries and innovations.\nThe Challenge of Quantum Errors Despite their immense potential, quantum computers face a significant challenge: the extreme sensitivity of quantum bits, or qubits, to environmental disturbances. Thes disturbances, often referred to as “noise,” encompass factors such as “vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference, etc.” This sensitivity leads to errors in calculations, which significantly hinders the reliability and accuracy of quantum computations. Overcoming this hurdle is crucial for realizing the full potential of quantum computing.\nOcelot Chip: A Breakthrough in Error Reduction The Ocelot chip, developed by the AWS City IT Center at Caltech, offers a promising solution to the persistent problem of quantum errors. According to AWS, the chip “could divide the quantum quantum errors in 5 to 10 the quantum approaches to conventional approaches.” This significant reduction in errors could pave the way for more stable and accurate quantum computations, marking a significant advancement in the field. The enhanced stability and accuracy provided by the Ocelot chip are essential for developing practical and reliable quantum computers.\nGlobal Investment and Competition The immense potential of quantum computing has spurred significant investment from both the public and private sectors worldwide. “IT giants of the American West Coast invest colossal sums in this technology, especially in an attempt to reduce errors.” Furthermore, “The United States and China has invested massively in quantum research, considered an essential emerging field.” This global competition underscores the strategic importance of quantum technology and the race to achieve quantum supremacy.\nRecognizing the strategic importance of quantum technology, Washington has also taken measures to protect its advancements in this field, having “imposed restrictions on exports related to this technology.” These restrictions reflect the growing recognition of quantum computing as a critical technology for national security and economic competitiveness.\nPotential Applications and Impact Researchers worldwide believe that advancements in quantum computing, such as the Ocelot chip, will have a transformative impact on various industries. They anticipate that the new technology “will for exmaple facilitate the development of revolutionary drugs or much more effective batteries,essential in the fight against global warming.” The development of more effective batteries, in particular, is seen as crucial in the global effort to combat climate change and transition to a sustainable energy future.\nExpert Insights: Dr. Anya Sharma on the Ocelot Chip To gain further insight into the importance of the Ocelot chip, we spoke with Dr. Anya sharma, a leading expert in quantum computing and professor at MIT.\nEditor: Dr. Sharma, can you explain what makes the Ocelot chip so meaningful?\nDr.Sharma: “The excitement surrounding the Ocelot chip is entirely justified.
