    "title": "Venezuela launches military exercise over British warship 'threat' - Breitbart",
    "text": "Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday ordered more than 5,600 military personnel to participate in a “defensive” exercise near the border with Guyana, in response to Britain sending a warship to the area. Maduro said he was launching “a joint action of a defensive nature in response to the provocation and threat of the United Kingdom against peace and the sovereignty of our country.” Britain said Sunday it would divert the patrol vessel HMS Trent to Guyana, a former British colony, amid the South American country’s simmering territorial dispute with neighboring Venezuela over the oil-rich Essequibo region. A Guyana foreign ministry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that the ship was due to arrive Friday and would be in its territory for “less than a week” for open sea defense exercises. The ship will not dock in Georgetown. The television broadcast accompanying Maduro’s announcement showed fighter jets participating in the Venezuelan exercise, as well as ships and ocean patrol vessels. The Venezuelan government earlier asked Guyana, in a statement, “to take immediate action for the withdrawal of the HMS Trent, and to refrain from involving military powers in the territorial controversy.” Guyana’s vice president Bharrat Jagdeo said the country was not doing anything to threaten Venezuela. “A lot of these measures were long-planned and they are routine and they are part of our building a defensive capability,” he told a press conference. “We don’t plan on invading Venezuela. President Maduro knows this and he need not have any worry about that.” ‘We are warriors’ Maduro claims that Essequibo — which makes up about two-thirds of Guyana’s territory — is actually Venezuelan land, a decades-old contention that has flared since massive oil deposits were found in its waters. The rising tensions have raised fears in the region of a potential conflict over the remote area of 160,000 square kilometers (62,000 square miles). The South American neighbors agreed earlier this month not to resort to force to settle the dispute, during a meeting between Maduro and Guyana’s President Irfaan Ali. “We believe in diplomacy, in dialogue, in peace,” said Maduro. “But no one should threaten Venezuela, no one should mess with Venezuela. We are a people of peace, but we are warriors and this threat is unacceptable for any sovereign country,” he said. “The threat of the decadent, rotten, ex-empire of the United Kingdom is unacceptable.” A UK foreign minister, David Rutley, visited Guyana earlier this month and reiterated sovereign borders “must be respected” and that London would work internationally “to ensure the territorial integrity of Guyana is upheld.” Maduro’s government held a controversial referendum on December 3 in which 95 percent of voters, according to officials in the hard-line leftist government, supported declaring Venezuela the rightful owner of Essequibo. He has since started legal maneuvers to create a Venezuelan province in Essequibo and ordered the state oil company to issue licenses for extracting crude in the region. Guyana’s Ali has branded the moves a “grave threat to international peace and security.”",

    "text": "Advertisement [By Vivian Chen, MD](/wc/vivian-chen-md) [commerce guidelines.](/commerce-guidelines)Our selections are never influenced by the commissions earned from our links. Do you put your plastic cutting boards into the dishwasher? If so, you may be exposing yourself to hormone-interfering endocrine disrupters. Here's what to know. What I consider the biggest problems with plastic cutting boards Plastic cutting boards are marketed as being the most sanitary option because they are antimicrobial and can be put into a dishwasher, making them easy to clean. However, plastic contains endocrine disrupters like BPA [1](#citations) and phthalates [2](#citations). Under certain conditions (e.g., heat, sun), plastic can leach these substances [3](#citations). A study in 2022 found that putting reusable plastic water bottles into the dishwasher [4](#citations) encouraged the migration of chemicals from the bottle into the drinking water inside. It is likely that the same applies to plastic cutting boards. You may think you are sanitizing your cutting boards by putting them into a hot wash in your dishwasher, but in reality, this may be loosening harmful chemicals from the plastic that can get into your food the next time you use the board. In addition, cutting creates deep grooves in the plastic where bacteria can linger, which makes used plastic cutting boards very difficult to fully disinfect in a dishwasher. You really need to be using a brush to get into those grooves. So if you do use a plastic board, opt to give it a good scrub yourself instead of placing it in the dishwasher. In one older study [5](#citations) out of the University of Wisconsin, researchers placed several bacteria, including E. coli and Salmonella, on both used and new wood and plastic cutting boards. The wood cutting boards consistently outperformed the plastic boards in terms of bacterial safety. Moral of the story? Wooden cutting boards may turn out to be more sanitary than plastic and prove better for your hormonal health (provided they don’t use plastic-containing glues to stick the wooden pieces together). Some plastic cutting boards are also coated with antibacterial substances to prevent bacteria from growing, but this only trades in bacteria growth for other chemicals, often endocrine disrupters. A common antibacterial ingredient is triclosan [6](#citations). The FDA does not recognize triclosan as safe due to its hormone-disrupting properties [6](#citations). While triclosan has been phased out of handwash and sanitizers [7](#citations), it still lurks in other everyday products —including cutting boards. Some people also use strong chemicals, such as bleach diluted with water , to clean plastic cutting boards. That creates the fearful possibility of contaminating your food with such chemicals. If you've ever put tomato or turmeric-rich foods into a plastic container, you'll see that it turns red or yellow. This is because the ingredients have seeped into the matrix of the plastic. Harsh cleaning agents could also be seeping into your board, potentially contaminating the food you cut on it. OK, so plastic is bad news… What's a better material? Thankfully, there are plenty of alternatives to plastic cutting boards that are just as easy to use but safer for your health. Glass, for example, is a nonporous surface that does not provide places for bacteria to linger. Like plastic boards, glass ones can also be cleaned in the dishwasher. However, glass boards do have some downsides. Cutting on glass can be loud, and since glass is breakable, it's a risky material for households with children or pets. The hard surface of glass boards also dulls knives quickly (as do ceramic and marble boards). So, glass boards may be most useful for rolling dough or doing other kitchen tasks that don't involve cutting. I personally look for solid one-piece wood cutting boards that are made without glue and finished with a nontoxic oil such as beeswax or fractionated coconut oil instead of petroleum-based mineral oil/wax. Koehl Karpentry and Mamma Mangia are two of my favorite small brands, but you can also find a local woodworker who can make a board for you out of solid wood (black walnut is my go-to). I find it best practice to use two different cutting boards for my meats and my fruits and vegetables. The takeaway Swapping out your plastic cutting board for a wood option is one quick strategy for reducing toxins at home.

Two white buses could be seen outside the church’s front door on Albion Road near Islington Avenue Thursday afternoon. The buses, chartered by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada transported just over 50 migrants from Pilgrim Feast to hotels in Niagara Falls. In previous weeks they’ve taken others to temporary spaces in Windsor and Mississauga.\nGet the latest National news. Sent to your email, every day. “The church was never meant to do this,’ said Miller, pointing out that they’ve managed to help care for refugees on a combination of dwindling donations and their own expenditures, which they have been told are not fully reimbursable by the city.\n“I’m not looking for a medal from the government of Canada, but what I am looking for is financial help … I need the government to decide they want to speak to us. They need our help. We need their help. Let’s work together.”\nAnswering questions via email, City of Toronto spokesperson Russell Baker told Global News, “As of December 17, the City was supporting 11,181 people – 9,370 people in the shelter system and 1,811 people outside the shelter system in bridging hotels and programs supported by the Canadian Red Cross. Of these, 5,372 are refugee claimants – or 48 per cent of the total number of people being supported.”\nStory continues below advertisement Baker wrote that the City gave Revivaltime, Pilgrim Feast and Dominion $50,000 each in September to help with the costs of the refugee response. Later that month, city council included the latter two churches in a plan to divide $750,000 in funds among 22 eligible community organizations.\nRelated News North Toronto churches sheltering refugees feeling strained Refugees moved out of Toronto churches and into hotels across Ontario “Dominion Church received $140,015 from its reimbursement application, bringing the total they have received to $190,015,” wrote Baker.\n“Pilgrim Feast Tabernacles received $235,305 from its reimbursement application, bringing the total they have received to $285,305.”\nCity officials realize that is not enough to fund the churches’ efforts, but say City Hall itself isn’t getting enough from Ottawa.\n“In December, the City of Toronto received confirmation that $35 million will be paid to the City by the Federal government, which still leaves $165 million in required funding for the City to manage refugee claimant costs … the City continues to call on its federal partners for all remaining 2023 expenses by year-end.”\nWith the arrival of winter, shelter systems around the GTA are full, and alternative programs are struggling. That leaves refugees like Rasidat, who says she came to Pilgrim Feast from Nigeria to flee persecution for her sexual orientation, worrying about the future.\n“We’re still looking for shelter,” she told Global News, pointing toward her children.\nStory continues below advertisement “If they don’t [increase funding] I will be outside. Something, I don’t know, might happen to my kids due to the cold outside.” Officials at both Pilgrim Feast and Dominion Church have discussed plans to raise funds for, buy and re-zone property to open up their own shelters for asylum claimants. Pilgrim Feast is hoping to open a space in Toronto, while Dominion is eyeing a spot in Peterborough. Those plans, however, are still in their early stages.\nRelated News More Toronto churches turning away asylum seekers they’ve been caring for since summer Toronto church Revivaltime Tabernacle says it will no longer shelter asylum claimants",
