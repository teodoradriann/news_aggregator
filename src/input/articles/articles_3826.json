    "text": "After 36 years, Tim Burton is back with another “Beetlejuice” movie, which opened the Venice Film Festival to raves from critics. But don’t expect another entry in the franchise anytime soon.\nTHR reports that the director won’t consider it for another 36 years, when Burton will be 102. [READ MORE: ‘Beetlejuice Beetlejuice’ Review: Tim Burton Is Back & At His Best In Decades [Venice]]https://theplaylist.net/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-review-tim-burton-is-back-and-at-his-best-in-decades-venice-20240828/\nAt the UK premiere of “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” last night, Burton shot down the prospects for turning his beloved series into a trilogy of films. “Well, if [the same] time frame goes on, I’ll be about 100. So maybe. I doubt it,” the director told THR. It’s a quippy answer, but it’s also the truth. No one expected a sequel to the 1988 film decades later, but here it is, complete with Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder, and Catherine O’Hara reprising their roles. But Burton’s return to “Beetlejuice” wasn’t a cash grab, nor was it due to a creative dry spell, where the director had no other ideas to implement. Instead, Burton considered it time to return the story’s characters as a way with reckoning with his own aging process.\n“Well, because the Lydia character (Ryder) interested me,” Burton told THR about his idea for the new sequel. “Getting older is where you start thinking about what happens in life. [She] starts as a cool teenager. Relationships… Do you have kids? What are they like? What do you like? How do you change? These are all things that I know and experience. So it felt more right to make this now, rather than back in, like, 1989.” Of course, Ryder’s Lydia isn’t centerstage in “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” either. She’s relegated her role as primary character to her daughter Astrid, played by Jenna Ortega, Hollywood’s latest Scream Queen. Other newcomers in the sequel include Justin Theroux, Monica Bellucci, and Willem Dafoe, too.\nThanks to roles in “X,” “Scream,” and “Wednesday,” Burton’s “Addams Family” Netflix spinoff series, Ortega has emerged as horror’s new heroine, and no one else comes close to vying for her crown. So it was a no-brainer for the actress to sign on for “Beetlejuice 2” when Burton asked her to star. “Most definitely. I mean, I was surprised he asked me about “Wednesday,”” Ortega said to THR about joining the film. “I was surprised he asked me about “Beetlejuice.” Working with him is a dream.” But what Ortega really enjoys about working with Burton is the inclusive nature of his film sets. “It’s the best. It’s so safe, it’s so collaborative, it’s so inviting, and everybody just keeps outdoing themselves,” Ortega continued. “It’s very playful and it doesn’t feel like work, you don’t want to leave. Playing [Ryder’s] daughter is probably one of the most grateful experiences I’ve ever had. She is just an absolute legend and one of the loveliest people.”\nBut Burton bringing on the likes of Belluci and Dafoe helped raise the stakes of “Beetlejuice 2″ as well. Dafoe had never worked with Burton before the sequel, so when the offer arose, the actor simply couldn’t refuse. “That was a big draw,” Dafoe said “I mean, I followed him for years, and I really like his movies. He’s contributed a lot to movies, so when he asked me to do something, even if I’m not exactly sure what it’s going to be, I was happy to sign off.” In the sequel, Dafoe plays a ghost cop who was a B-movie actor before he died; a role Dafoe plays with relish. “You know, the narcissism of actors, things like that, I [could] play within this,” the actor quipped. It’s the second straight role for Dafoe, after Yorgos Lanthimos‘ “Poor Things,” that required heavy prosthetics. Dafoe didn’t mind. It’s fun because it has a kind of playful, goofy aesthetic,” said the actor, “but it still sticks with the horror genre.”\n“Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” sees the Deetz family return to Winter River after Astrid’s father passes away, only for Ortega’s Astrid to release Keaton’s Beetlegeuse back into the world. Calamity ensues, but the Deetzs aren’t the only group that wants Beetlegeuse back to the Afterlife. Burton’s sequel hits theaters next weekend on September 6, and expect it to do well. After opening Venice, “Beetlejuice 2” has a lot of buzz thanks to numerous positive reviews. And if it does well at the box office, maybe a “Beetlejuice 3” is right around the corner?",

    "text": "More than 30,000 Boeing workers in the Seattle area and in Oregon were set to strike Friday after staff rejected a new labor contract. The work stoppage will halt production of most of the company’s aircraft. More than 30,000 Boeing workers were set to strike Friday, halting production of most of the company’s aircraft after staff rejected a new labor contract.\nIt’s a potentially costly development for the manufacturer that has struggled to ramp up production and restore its reputation following safety crises.\nWorkers in the Seattle area and in Oregon voted against a tentative agreement that Boeing and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers unveiled Sunday. That proposal included 25% wage increases and other improvements to health-care and retirement benefits, though the union had sought raises of about 40%. Workers had complained about the agreement, saying that it didn’t cover the increased cost of living.\nThe vote is a blow to CEO Kelly Ortberg , who has been in the top job for five weeks. A day before the vote, he had urged workers to accept the contract and not to strike, saying that it would jeopardize the company’s recovery.\nThe ultimate financial impact of the strike will depend on how long it lasts.\nJefferies aerospace analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu estimated a 30-day cash impact from a strike could be a $1.5 billion hit for Boeing and said it “could destabilize suppliers and supply chains.” She forecast the tentative agreement would have had an annual impact of $900 million if passed.\nBoeing has burned through about $8 billion so far this year. Production has fallen short of expectations as the company works to stamp out manufacturing flaws and faces other industry-wide problems such as supply and labor shortages.\nA blowout of a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 at the start of the year has brought additional federal scrutiny of Boeing’s production lines.\nM.

    "text": "\"Le cure palliative in Lombardia affrontano una crisi economica che mette a rischio la qualità e la continuità dell’assistenza a pazienti inguaribili, quindi la loro stessa dignità\". Luca Moroni, direttore dell’hospice di Abbiategrasso e coordinatore regionale di Federazione cure palliative e della Commissione cure palliative Uneba Lombardia, lancia l’allarme. Gli ultimi dati sullo stato della rete di assistenza nella regione sono stati presentati alla Business school della Liuc, nel corso del primo convegno dell’Osservatorio cure palliative. Relatori Antonio Sebastiano, direttore dell’Osservatorio in ateneo, i colleghi Roberto Pigni e Umberto Restelli, esperti del terzo settore, Tania Piccione, presidente di Federazione cure palliative, Luca Degani, di Uneba Lombardia, e Giampaolo Fortini, presidente della Società italiana di cure palliative.\nI numeri restituiscono una situazione critica. Gli hospice lombardi operano con un tasso di saturazione dell’88,2%, che corrisponde a pieno regime, ma ricevono dalla Regione l’80% delle risorse necessarie: il costo di un posto letto è 114.914 euro, il rimborso si ferma a 86.653. Nonostante l’eccellenza riconosciuta delle cure palliative lombarde, meno della metà dei pazienti che ne avrebbero bisogno riceve assistenza e per periodi brevi (47 giorni di media a domicilio, 17 in hospice).\n\"Questa situazione si traduce in bilanci in rosso per la maggior parte degli hospice, soprattutto quelli gestiti dal terzo settore, dove il deficit rischia di diventare insostenibile nel medio-lungo termine – spiega Moroni –. Negli hospice pubblici il disavanzo grava sui bilanci delle Aziende ospedaliere, costringendo a scelte che penalizzano sia le strutture di cure palliative sia altri servizi. Il sistema di remunerazione attuale, basato su tariffe non indicizzate all’inflazione e contratti annuali con regole mutevoli, genera incertezza e impedisce una programmazione efficace: dal 2016 le tariffe sono aumentate del 6,7%, mentre l’inflazione ha raggiunto il 22,4%\". Gli hospice, dagli elevati standard assistenziali, destinano il 62% dei costi al personale, risorsa particolarmente scarsa. \"È urgente mettere in sicurezza la sostenibilità a lungo termine della rete e riattivare i tavoli tecnici per progettare un futuro solido\" conclude Moroni.\nSilvia Vignati",

    "text": "Turkish defense company Baykar's domestically developed armed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Bayraktar TB3 broke an altitude record Thursday with a domestically produced engine, reaching 33,000 feet in a performance test.\nAccording to a statement from Baykar, the testing process for the Bayraktar TB3 has continued successfully.\nAfter making its first flight for the Turkish Republic's 100th anniversary on Oct. 27, 2023, successfully conducting medium and high-altitude performance tests, the Bayraktar TB3 UAV completed the High Altitude System Performance Test on Thursday, reaching a record altitude.\nThe UAV successfully completed the test at the AKINCI Flight Training and Test Center in Corlu district of Tekirdag with the PD-170 engine developed by TUSAS Engine Industries Inc., or TEI.\nThe altitude record belongs to the Bayraktar AKINCI TIHA unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) developed by Baykar, at 45,118 feet.\nThe Bayraktar TB3 UAV logged a total of 327 hours and 35 minutes in test flights, including a remarkable 32-hour continuous flight covering 5,700 kilometers (3,541 miles) on Dec. 20, 2023.\nOn March 26 this year, it achieved another milestone by successfully flying with the domestically developed ASELFLIR-500 system, known for its superior performance globally.\nEquipped with foldable wings, the Bayraktar TB3 will become the first armed UAV capable of operating from short-runway ships like the TCG Anadolu.\nThis advancement, coupled with its beyond line-of-sight communication capability, positions it as a game-changer in reconnaissance, intelligence and attack missions, enhancing Türkiye's deterrent capabilities significantly.\nBaykar, largely self-funded, has relied on exports for 83% of its revenue since 2003, becoming the defense and aviation sector's export leader, according to the Turkish Exporters Assembly.\nRecognized by the Presidency of Defense Industries in 2023, Baykar's exports totaled $1.8 billion last year, constituting over 90% of its income and one-third of the sector's total exports in 2023.\nAs the world's largest UAV exporter, Baykar has fulfilled 97.5% of its contracts through exports, with agreements signed with a total of 34 countries, including 33 countries for the Bayraktar TB2 UAV and nine countries so far for the Bayraktar AKINCI TIHA.\n# Akıncı # AKINCI TIHA # altitude record # Baykar # Bayraktar AKINCI TIHA # bayraktar TB3 # Bayraktar TB3 UAV # domestic engine # High Altitude System Performance Test # Türkiye's national UAV # UAV",
