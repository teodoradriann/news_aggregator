    "text": "Loris Cabirou led the way in the final of two Lamborghini Super Trofeo North America practice sessions at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Thursday, edging out Ryan Norman by a mere 0.008 seconds in a session that saw multiple red flag stoppages. The ANSA Motorsports driver set his benchmark 1:25.516 lap time early in the session aboard the No. 30 Lamborghini Huracan Super Trofeo EVO2 he shares with Bryson Morris. His time held firm, despite multiple challenges from Norman and Danny Formal’s Wayne Taylor Racing with Andretti entry. Scott Huffaker was third-quickest in the No. 22 WorldSpeed Lamborghini, despite bringing out the first of two red flags when he went off at Turn 4 early in the session. ANSA’s Nico Jamin managed to record the session’s fourth fastest time before teammate Kiko Porto found the Turn 4 runoff, bringing the second red. The Pro-Am No. 66 Forty7 Motorsports entry of Joel Miller rounded out the top-five. Cole Kleck was once-again quickest in Am, with Rocky T. Bolduc holding a commanding margin over the rest of his LB Cup competitors. The exit of Turn 6 proved troublesome for many of the drivers as they increased their pace in second practice, with race control issuing 24 track limits warnings and penalties for violations at the corner during the 45-minute session. Qualifying is scheduled to begin at 10:20 a.m. EDT tomorrow morning, with Race 1 going green at 4:00 p.m. EDT later that afternoon featuring live streaming coverage on Peacock and IMSA.tv.

    "text": "RHONJ's Dolores Catania calls out \"chaotic\" Tom Sandoval for how awful he is at the game, while Challenge legend Wes Bergmann threatens everyone as the Round Table descends into chaos!\nThere's a new way to play The Traitors that we never considered. What if the Traitors all hated one another and declared open war on one another ... while being forced to work together against the rest of the house?\nHow could that possibly work, you say? We're not sure, either, but we're all going to find out as this season has gone completely off the rails with Boston Rob Mariano, Danielle Reyes, and Carolyn Wiger going completely off the script and out of their minds.\nTalk about letting your paranoia get the best of you!\nDanielle is definitely the worst of the three, as she's openly campaigning against and targeting both of them, having said she wants a new batch of Traitor cohorts she can trust to work with.\nRob created this monster, inadvertently, when he went against a fellow Traitor in Bob the Drag Queen. But as he again tried to reiterate tonight, he only did it because Bob TDQ openly threw out that the house needed to consider one of the three newcomers -- which includes him -- was likely a Traitor.\nHow could Rob not see that as a pretty direct threat?\nGetty\nAndy Cohen Defends Asking Real Housewives What Plastic Surgery They've Had Done\nView StoryLast week's episode ended with Carolyn on the cusp of attacking Danielle in the turret, and she did not disappoint. The Survivor finalist, who wore her heart and quirkiness on her sleeve tattoos on that show, let her emotions fly as she attacked Danielle for targeting her on this one.\nDanielle, who absolutely did do that, tried to deflect, and finally offered what seemed to be a sincere apology and mea culpa. She even said she would fix it that day, which is where everything went wrong.\nAt the mission, Carolyn was still getting information brought to her about Danielle's dastardly lies about her from the previous day. But thinking this was all new trash talk, she decided it was time to take out Danielle ... especially after Britney told her that \"somebody\" told her that Carolyn was throwing Britney's name around, which never happened.\nSo we have Danielle openly campaigning against both of her fellow Traitors and Carolyn ready to drag Danielle into the mud and out of the game -- while also not trusting Rob. Is it crazy that the guy who stirred this pot was the only one not actively trying to destroy his fellow Traitors this week?\nPeacock/Getty\nTom Sandoval-Chrishell Stause Fight Blows Up on The Traitors Over Ariana Madix\nView StoryBoston Rob Under Fire\nTo be fair, he's been under a lot of heat in the House, and he was getting torn apart again this week. The Survivor legend is playing a very typically Boston Rob game, controlling everything, but he's never had to justify his actions quite so blatantly.\nDanielle's strategy in the turret is to let Boston Rob get his way, which is how Biggest Loser trainer Bob Harper became the latest celebrity \"Murdered\" by the Traitors. Rob pointed out that Bob was very directly gunning for him at the last Round Table, making him the most imminent threat to the three of them.\nWell, the most imminent threat is each other, but they can't kill a fellow Traitor. Could you imagine?!?\nWhat was amazing was seeing how incredible Challenge superstar Wes Bergmann's deductive mind was. By the time they got to the Round Table, he and Big Brother champ Derrick Levasseur had rallied their troops against Rob, and Wes totally called out his game.\nHe flat-out said that he believed that the Traitors had an agreement to not target one another, unless the other did so first. He then noted that Bob the Drag Queen made the comment about watching out for the three newcomers, which, he said to Rob, \"allowed you to stand by your code to go after the Traitor.\"\nGetty\nRHONJ's Jennifer Aydin Addresses Jersey Mike's Incident, Claims She 'Was Not Rude' to Staff\nView StoryDerrick made the argument that Bob Harper's death right after he called out Rob was very telling, but not nearly as telling as Rob's continuing survival both after Bob H calling him out, and after his open warfare with Bob TDQ. If Rob were a Faithful and that good at the game, how could the Traitors not take him out.\nOnce again, Rob proved why he's a master at these types of games, and it's more than that he \"leaves his morals at the door,\" as Derrick put it.\nFirst, Rob pointed out that Bob TDQ's final words were to say that everything he'd said was a lie, meaning him targeting Rob must have been a lie. Then, he noted that no one in the House thinks Ivar is a Traitor, so the only way to get rid of him would be murder, so he was shocked when both he and British Royal Lord Ivar Mountbatten made it to breakfast.\nThen, he turned the tables on Wes, as the one spearheading this campaign against him, saying even that is evidence Wes could be a Traitor. After all, \"if the Traitors are able to put a target on me, they don't have to waste a murder on me, because you're gonna do it for them.\"\nFOX/Toofab\nChristy Carlson Romano Compares Special Forces to Working in Hollywood, Exit Wasn't Her Choice (Exclusive)\nView StorySideshow: Dolores v Sandoval\nWhile the big dogs are playing Traitors, it's been just as enjoyable watching all the sideshows, i.e., the people who are really, really bad at these games.\nAs expected, it's mostly the reality stars not known for competition shows. Bachelorette Gabby Windey's loyalty seems to blow with the wind, as when she turned on her close friend Nikki Garcia last week, with the barest of nudges.\nZac Efron's brother Dylan and Big Brother's Britney Haynes have been pawns in everybody else's game, but perhaps the most entertaining feud to emerge has been between Tom Sandoval and ... well, everyone.\nGabby and Nikki threw shade on Day 1 when they refused to say hello to him, Selling Sunset's Chrishell Stause threw him under the bus because she knows the Vanderpump Rules alum knows how to lie and betray (\"Scandoval\" anyone)?\nBut all of that was prelude to Tom stepping up to show off his terrible deductive skills this week. First, he bullied Britney into a corner, forcing her to listen to whatever his latest theory was.\nGetty\nLala Kent Calls Ariana Madix, Katie Maloney Reactions to VPR Recasting 'Slap in the Face'\nView Story\"We've gotta be on Theory 73 now. It's not even 9 a.m. yet,\" Britney lamented after finally escaping.\nAt breakfast, [RHONJ's](http://toofab.com/tags/rhonj) [Dolores Catania](http://toofab.com/tags/dolorescatania) hilariously called Sandoval out for having the worst reads in the house by telling him, \"Tom, you know why you're here. You're too chaotic. You said it yourself. You said, 'I have a lot of theories, no one believes me.' So you're great for the Traitors.\"\n\"I have good evidence, I feel like,\" Sandoval sulked in response. \"Sometimes.\"\nBut he didn't. Just as he had virtually nothing when he decided that Dolores must be a Traitor and started floating that theory around. As word got back to her, she quipped that he just seems to need to be in the middle of things, adding, \"I don't think Tom's had a lot of attention in his younger years.\"\nAt the Round Table, Sandoval decided to put his big boy pants on and formally throw out Dolores' name, to which she brilliantly encouraged him, \"I don't want you to be nervous to say this because I don't think any of it will make sense so I'm okay with it.\"\nHilariously, Tom barely got one sentence out before the rest of the Table shut him down and shut him up so they could get to the real suspects, namely Wes and Rob.\n[\nHGTV\n](https://toofab.com/2025/01/30/christina-haack-tarek-el-moussa-divorce-the-flip-off/)\nChristina Haack & Tarek El Moussa Break Down While Reflecting on Divorce 8 Years After Split\nView StoryTraitors Target Traitors, Wes v Rob\nWhen it came down to serious discussion at the Round Table, there were a lot of names thrown out, including Traitors blatantly targeting other Traitors, but it all came down to a massive test of wills, savvy, and public speaking skills between Boston Rob and Wes.\nShockingly, as the two of them were going at it, Carolyn jumped in to defends Wes -- which could be seen as weakening Rob as the two were going head-to-head, while throwing out her own target: Danielle.\n\"Wes is clearly being used as a scapegoat here,\" she said. \"There are multiple lies going around. I'm just gonna be real. I don't fit in in the real world and I don't fit in in this castle; I've always been the quirky one. So coming into this game, I didn't have a ton of allies. So luckily, I found an ally in Danielle … until recently.\"\nShe then threw Danielle hard under the bus -- though honestly -- for all the hustling Danielle had done the day prior to try and turn the house against her.\n[\nFOX/Instagram\n](https://toofab.com/2025/01/29/carey-hart-pink-special-forces/)\nCarey Hart Details Sacrifices He Made for Family & Why Wife P!nk Would Never Do Special Forces (Exclusive)\nView StoryAnd, despite saying she would try to fix it today, Danielle double down on her lie that Carolyn had said Britney's name. She again tried to deflect attention away from Wes, saying, \"Wes gets looked at as the chaos maker. It's Wes, he's causing chaos. No, it's you, Danielle. You are causing chaos.\"\nNone of it was enough to divert attention from the main attraction. Wes and Derrick laid out their arguments, Rob pushed a lot of attention on Wes as someone who builds an army of allies to support his claims, with Gabby chiming in that it's so he can be safe.\nThen, Wes dug his own grave when he was called out for how aggressively he plays the game. It's one thing to be aggressive and own it, which he did. That's fine. Where he went wrong was when he threatened everyone.\nHe said he'd dial back his aggression and that he appreciated everyone who didn't vote for him tonight. But for those who do vote for him, he warned he'd have his eyes on them ... which was absolutely the wrong thing to say.\nIn the end, it was a nailbiter of a vote, with Wes getting eliminated with seven votes to Rob's five. Dolores voted for Tom and Carolyn voted for Danielle -- just to keep the feuds alive, but this proved another hard-fought victory for Rob. With 13 players left, though, how long can he last?\n[\nABC/Getty\n](https://toofab.com/2025/01/29/the-view-karoline-leavitt-joy-behar/)\nJoy Behar Criticized for White House Press Sec. Jab, While Whoopi Rips 'Wokeness' Stance\nView StoryTraitors Declare Open War\nRather than the hour ending with the Traitors discussing who to murder, they had to deal with the fact that they are now in open warfare.\n\"Ultimately, I got through by the skin of my teeth with zero help from my Traitors,\" Rob noted on his way up there.\nThe confrontation did not disappoint, either, as Rob could only stand back in shock as Carolyn and Danielle went after one another. Danielle continued to dig her own grave when Carolyn called out her lying about Britney and she tried to argue, \"You brought it up to kill her, that's what I meant.\"\nThat was referring to their Traitor discussions on who to murder, though. \"So I'll just let her know that that happened in the turret?\" Carolyn marveled. \"Come on, girl, you can't be serious!\"\nWhen Rob lamented he didn't know what to do at this point, Carolyn had a pretty straightforward solution for him: \"We just gotta go after Danielle.\"\n[\nYouTube\n](https://toofab.com/2025/01/29/natalie-joy-nick-viall-miscarriage/)\nNatalie Joy 'Actively Miscarrying' Second Baby with Nick Viall: 'I Feel So Empty Inside'\nView Story\"It's kinda obvious the game that you're playing. It's as if you want to get rid of us and be like the most faithful Traitor and then nobody will suspect you at the end,\" Carolyn said, pretty much summing up Danielle's strategy all game.\nHonestly, Carolyn is in the best position right now, if her fellow Traitors can't turn the house against her. She's much smarter than anyone thinks -- including her fellow Traitors -- and absolutely no one suspects that she could possibly be a Traitor.\nDanielle is playing an aggressive and very sloppy game, and Rob is playing a masterful defensive game. But can either of them make it to the end? It's not looking likely. Carolyn, though, is actually sitting pretty in the midst of chaos ... for now.\nWhen Traitors are at war, anything can happen. Maybe the Faithfull should just sit back and let them slaughter themselves.\nThe Traitors drops new episodes every Thursday at 8 p.m. ET on Peacock.",

    "text": "En el marco de una nota exclusiva en el piso de SportsCenter, Sofía Toccalino fue la primera atleta entrevistada de forma local que es parte de la campaña \"You got this\" de Adidas.\nEl alto rendimiento se trata de disciplina, constancia, ambición, inteligencia, paciencia, resiliencia. Toccalino hace 10 años que se pone la camiseta de Las Leonas y desde el 24 de julio jugará la Copa Panamericana. Sabe cuánto costó quedar en cada torneo, cuánto sufrió. Sin embargo y más allá de todas las variables que atraviesan a un deportista de élite, Poy cree que lo que la llevó a estar en ese lugar de privilegio, es su familia.\n\"Soy una agradecida, sin ellos no podría estar disfrutando como disfruto. Me acuerdo que me han llevado a entrenar a Quilmes, a Parque Roca, al Ce.N.A.R.D., que mi hermano me juegue en el patio de casa y que entrenemos juntos técnicas. Hacía entrenamientos invisibles con Luquitas (hermano) que me tiraba las bochas, me acompañaba y me alentaba\", contó la jugadora surgida en St. Catherine's.\nPero además de estar motivándola para seguir creciendo, también se ocuparon y preocuparon por contenerla cuando no todo iba bien. \"Lo que más me marcó fue en los momentos que quedaba afuera de lista internacionales, eran ellos los que hacían que yo esté tranquila porque había dado todo\", explicó Poy.\nAunque lleva colgadas varias medallas olímpicas, continentales y mundialista, sabe que el ser consciente la ayuda a seguir siendo parte: \"Mi familia me hizo tener los pies sobre la tierra y entender que era un juego. Me siento en un lugar privilegiado y debo cuidarlo todos los días. Estoy en un lugar que mucha gente quiere estar y siempre lo soñé. Tienen que decidir por 18 de todo el país. Jugadoras como vos (Mechi Margalot), Carla Rebecchi, como todas las que estuvieron, dejaron un legado muy grande y nosotras lo queremos mantener vivo, y me parece que eso es lo lindo que tienen Las Leonas. Pasan las jugadoras y Argentina sigue estando ahí arriba\".\nSobre el final, la ex-Leona y conductora de Sportscenter le mostró un video en el que se encuentra entrenando con su hermano, a quien Poy eligió como su mayor influencia. De esta forma, Adidas busca reflejar la importancia de la positividad de los entornos para ayudar a que los atletas crean en You Got This.\n.\nCon lágrimas en los ojos, Poy contó que Luqui -como le dice ella- \"la hizo creer, la hizo crecer y está ciento por ciento agradecida a su familia, en general\".\nSin duda el talento, su juego, y sobre todo el poder de adaptación, la versatilidad de Toccalino, le permitieron permanecer en Las Leonas. Pero atrás de ella, hay quienes están dispuestos a dar todo para sostenerla. Todos necesitan de alguien.",

He demostrado que no creo en el camino de la violencia y además, tengo un profundo respeto por todas las creencias”.\ncompartir Comentarios La delegada de la Región Metropolitana, Constanza Martínez (CS) , respondió este viernes a las críticas que le hizo el Arzobispo de Santiago, Fernando Chomalí , a raíz de un tuit que publicó en 2018 y que dice “Si quiero prenderle fuego a algo, que sea a la Iglesia y a la Constitución de Pinochet”.\nEn plena Navidad, cinco años después, Chomalí respondió a la publicación que hizo la delegada presidencial y escribió: “Dios la bendiga Constanza”, le contestó Chomalí en esa misma red social, cinco años después de la fecha de publicación.\n“Dios la bendiga”: la respuesta del arzobispo de Santiago a un antiguo tweet de la delegada RM sobre “prenderle fuego” a la Iglesia Y este jueves el arzobispo salió a explicar por qué decidió responder al post de la delegada. “Este mensaje, aunque haya sido escrito hace cinco años, sigue en las redes e incita al odio , ofende a los católicos y a quienes ven en la experiencia religiosa un bien para la sociedad”, señaló.\nAdemás, Chomalí hizo un llamado a la delegada Martínez a que “vaya a conocer la inmensa labor social que realiza la Iglesia”. “Estoy seguro de que en vez de querer quemarlas las va a querer cuidar y promover”, aseguró.\nLa historia continua más abajo\nMás sobre Iglesia Arzobispo de Santiago explica por qué respondió a antiguo tuit de delegada RM: “Incita al odio” 28 dic 2023 “Dios la bendiga”: la respuesta del arzobispo de Santiago a un antiguo tweet de la delegada RM sobre “prenderle fuego” a la Iglesia 26 dic 2023 Arzobispo de Santiago explica por qué respondió a antiguo tuit de delegada RM: “Incita al odio” Martínez se refirió al tema esta mañana durante una actividad del programa Verano Seguro y dijo que “este es un tuit bien antiguo, de hace 5 años, lo había hablado cuando asumí el cargo hace más de 2 años. Hace alusión a una canción de un artista nacional que se llama Alexander Andwanter , de una canción que se llama ‘siempre es viernes en mi corazón’, que recomiendo mucho que la escuchen”.\nY enfatizó que la canción “tiene una crítica importante a la política, al congreso y también a las instituciones eclesiásticas respecto al trato que se le ha dado a la población homosexual y de las disidencias sexuales”.\nMartínez aclaró que escribió el tuit el día en que se declaró inconstitucional la ley que prohibía el lucro en las universidades y en la educación en general, “una demanda que varios de nosotros hemos peleado a lo largo de nuestra historia política”. “Y en eso también ser bien franca, si ustedes revisan mi experiencia política, lo que he hecho en estos dos años, pero también lo que he hecho en mi experiencia política como dirigente estudiantil, es siempre velar por las manifestaciones pacíficas. Lo he demostrado, he demostrado que no creo en el camino de la violencia y además, tengo un profundo respeto por todas las creencias”, añadió.\nAntes de finalizar y respecto a si ofendió a los creyentes , como señaló Chomalí, la autoridad metropolitana sostuvo que “vengo de un ambiente que también es de mucho respeto a las distintas creencias y creo que mis hechos ya han dado cuenta de eso. Un tuit respecto a una canción me parece que no representa lo que he hecho ni lo que soy”.\nComenta Por favor, inicia sesión en La Tercera para acceder a los comentarios.\nDe cuánto fue el temblor de este viernes 29 de diciembre en Chile Baltasar Daza Hace 2 horas La Suerte en Chile: estos son los RUT ganadores del viernes 29 de diciembre Andrés Barra Hace 2 horas ¿Cuándo es el feriado bancario 2023 y cómo funciona?
