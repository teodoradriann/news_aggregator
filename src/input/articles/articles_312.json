    "text": "Mejoras en el drenaje de Hidalgo reducen problemas de inundación Mientras las lluvias persisten en nuestra frontera, las mejoras al sistema de drenaje que se han hecho por los últimos meses en el condado hidalgo, parecen haber hecho su trabajo. Noticias RGV se encuentra cerca de la milla 1 antes de llegar a la carretera 107 en La Villa y las lluvias han sido puntuales fuertes, pero de manera intermitente, un momento está lloviendo y al otro sale el sol. Hacia el fondo podemos ver una obra de muchas que ha podido ampliar la capacidad. el plan es que el canal como este no sea tan angosto, y pueda retener más agua pluvial. Roel Salinas vive en Donna, y la tormenta tropical, Alberto, no le dejó grandes daños. Nada comparado a previas inundaciones. Y es que según funcionarios del condado Hidalgo, como el comisionado David Fuentes, él piensa que se debe a las mejoras a los canales de aguas pluviales. Cerca de la Villa, hay dos obras multimillonarias, una de 20 millones de dólares que vienen de una subvención de la oficina general de tierras de Texas, está ampliando este canal de 150 pies a 400 pies, hasta 121 metros. Otro plan de expansión incluye un canal al norte la Villa, cerca donde se acaba la Montecristo Road el plan es que esa agua llegue a este tubo para después desembocarse en esta laguna de detención. Desde este lugar, en unos tres años, el agua pluvial que provienen de gran parte del condado Hidalgo. No solo será detenida para evitar inundaciones en el condado Willacy, pero también, se podrá filtrar y vender como agua potable. La primera planta podría costar hasta 70 millones de dólares. Y esa será una de cuatro plantas potabilizadoras con un costo de 30 millones cada una.

    "title": "Bishop Patrick Walsh remembered for his commitment to Catholic education – The Irish News",
    "text": "Former Bishop of Down and Connor Patrick Walsh has been remembered for his commitment and “robust defence” of Catholic eductaion. The Co Cork-born cleric died on December 28 at Nazareth House care home in south Belfast, aged 92. His death came six weeks after that of Bishop Anthony Farquhar, who was consecrated with Bishop Walsh, and also resided latterly at Nazareth House. A maths teacher and former member of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, Patrick Walsh was ordained in 1965 and became a bishop in 1983. He was born in Cobh in 1931 before his family moved to Belfast when he was 11. He attended St Mary’s Christian Brothers’ Grammar School in west Belfast then Queen’s University Belfast from 1948 - 1952, where he studied mathematics. From there he went to the Pontifical Lateran University, Rome for four years, where he obtained a Licentiate in Theology. Following his ordination, he spent two years studying at Christ’s College, Cambridge where he obtained a MSc in mathematics and subsequently also obtained a MSc from Queen’s University. He was appointed to the staff of St MacNissi’s College, Garron Tower in 1958 and remained there until 1964, when he was appointed chaplain to the Catholic students attending Queen’s. In 1970 he was appointed president of Saint Malachy’s College, Belfast. Bishop Walsh was ordained as Auxiliary Bishop for the Diocese of Down and Connor in 1983 and in 1991 he was appointed Bishop of Down and Connor. He chaired the board of governors of St Mary’s University College in Belfast and was chair of the trustees of the four diocesan colleges, as well serving as chair of the trustees of the Mater Hospital. He retired in 2008. Bishop Donal McKeown, apostolic administrator of Down and Connor, said he learned of Bishop Walsh’s death with “great sadness”. “I know that you will join me in praying for Bishop Patrick and in offering his brother Michael and sister-in-law Angela, his late brother Jack and late sister Mary, his nieces Maria and Jacqueline, his nephew Michael, their families and his wider family and friends, our heartfelt condolences and our prayers over the coming days,” he said. Bishop McKeown said Bishop Walsh’s “personal commitment to Catholic education was well known and his robust defence of it will long be remembered”. “These early years of his priestly ministry taught Bishop Patrick that Catholic education, and the values it espouses, opens up incalculable opportunities for young people and assists the journey towards peace in a society often torn apart by violence and conflict,” he said.",

The accidents happened in Ghazni province on the same highway between the capital Kabul and southern Kandahar city late on Wednesday, provincial head of information and culture Hamidullah Nisar said on X, without specifying how many people were killed and injured in each accident.\n“There is a possibility the numbers could rise,” Nisar told reporters outside a hospital in Ghazni city where victims had been sent.\nHe noted that some of the injured were in a “critical condition” and had been sent to Kabul for treatment. “Among the injured and dead were children, women and elderly people,” he added.\nOne bus collided with a fuel tanker near Shahbaz village in central Ghazni while the other hit a truck in the eastern district of Andar, Nisar said.\nChief government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted on X that the authorities had “great regret” over the accidents and that an investigation would be launched.\nTeams worked to clear debris at the sites into the morning, with hunks of metal and broken glass strewn across the area in Andar along with the clothes and meals of bus passengers, an AFP journalist saw. One of the injured in the accident in Shahbaz, Khadim, said he was jolted awake by the noise of the accident but then lost consciousness.\nWhen he came to and pulled himself from the wreck he “saw there were a lot of people under the vehicle and on the ground around us, there was crying and blood everywhere”.\nLocals shout out their grievances as Macron visits Mayotte President Emmanuel Macron comforts a woman as he talks to residents in cyclone devastated Mamoudzou.—...\nLabour Minister Tulip Siddiq named in UK Bangladesh corruption probe Senior Labour minister UK Tulip Siddiq. — Facebook@dewan.sumon.77/FileDHAKA: A senior Labour minister in the UK has...\nSpain seeks curbs on sugary drinks in schools The representational image shows school students enjoying their lunch time at canteen. — Pexels/FileMADRID: Spain´s...\nGerman MPs vote to safeguard top court from ‘extremists’ German Chancellor Olaf Scholz appears as a witness in his role as former finance minister at the German parliament's...\nPelicot’s ex-husband jailed 20 years in France mass rape trial Gisele Pelicot leaves the court after attending the trial for Dominique Pelicot and 50 co-accused, at the courthouse...\nIndian soldiers battle rebels in held Kashmir, five killed Indian Central Reserve Police Force personnel stand guard on a street in Srinagar, October 12, 2021. — ReutersHELD...\nBilly Bob Thornton On Turning Down Villain Role In ‘Spider-Man’, ‘Mission: Impossible III’ Chris Martin Reflects On Life Without Kids Jesse Eisenberg On How Lex Luthor Role In ‘Batman V.

Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.\nThey have bided their time through injury and loaded position groups but are finally ready to begin starring for the Nittany Lion defense that led the nation in sacks and total yards allowed.\nSeveral NFL-bound defenders will play Saturday but will see limited duty, in order to help protect them against wear and tear and injury.\nPenn State outside linebacker Tony Rojas (13) tries to get to West Virginia quarterback Garrett Greene during the fourth quarter of a football game at Beaver Stadium September 2, 2023 in State College.\nThat will open the door at linebacker, and for Rojas, in particular. The true freshman appeared poised to make a significant instant impact this past season. That just never quite materialized, in part, because the Lions relied on an experienced, five-man rotation.\nNo matter that Rojas looked physically ready to compete in the Big Ten as 6-foot-2 and 225 pounds. Or that he led the team with nine tackles and a pass break-up in April’s Blue-White Game.\nPenn State freshman Tony Rojas smiles as he sees family and friends outside Beaver Stadium Saturday, Nov. 18, 2023, in State College, Pa.\nHe mostly served only as a special teamer and late-game backup in 2023. He played in all 12 regular-season games but was credited with just 16 tackles.\n“I’ve seen a lot of growth through his ups and downs,” said linebacker Curtis Jacobs, one of those Lions who may play only sparingly against Ole Miss.\n“I felt like it’s been really good for him to develop this year, that’s something I wish I had a little more of my freshman year. I just feel like he’s ready to take over. He plays fast all the time. I just think he’s ready to take that next step.”\nPenn State football rising defenders: Tony Rojas to Dani Dennis-Sutton Rojas is finally ready to shine because of his “instincts, the kind of instincts that come from preparation,” Jacobs said. “I feel like that’s where he’s grown so much in his game. … Now I see how he prepares and how he’s seeing things on film and attacking it in practice. I feel like the Maryland game was a really big indicator of that. He spent all week attacking that and deep-diving into his preparation and he was able to make two incredible plays because of it.\n“I see him becoming a big-time player at Penn State.”\nWawa vs. Sheetz: A Penn State football Peach Bowl poll: Sheetz or Wawa?And the winner is …\nPSU roommates on the rise: ‘Next year they’re going to go crazy.’ Why these Penn State football stars stick together\nIn the blowout victory over the Terps in early November, Rojas made his first career interception, returning it 20 yards. He also forced the first fumble of his career.\nTwo weeks later he hit career-highs with four tackles and 1.5 tackles for loss against Rutgers. He figures to star in 2024 alongside Kobe King and All-America candidate Abdul Carter.\nIt’s been an even longer wait for defensive ends Vanover and Fisher.\nVanover, an extra-long pass rusher at 6-foot-4 and 266 pounds, played sparingly while learning during his first three years on campus. He seemed prepared to take on a larger role in 2023 until an undisclosed leg injury at Ohio Sate nearly ruined his season.\nHe’s back now. On Thursday, senior defensive tackle Dvon Ellies called him the most underrated player on the defense.\n“He’s definitely put on a show for a lot of people, these last couple of weeks, especially,” Ellies said. “He’s just been on a roll. He’s been Mr. Consistent. His technique has been tremendous. I just don’t think he get enough attention ….”\nPenn State defensive end Zuriah Fisher (36) pursues Massachusetts quarterback Ahmad Haston in the second half of a NCAA football game against Massachusetts Saturday, Oct. 14, 2023, in State College, Pa. The Nittany Lions won, 63-0.\nMeanwhile, Fisher’s career was temporarily delayed by a knee injury that all but wiped out his 2022 season. He returned late to play in two games, making a pair of tackles.\nHe flashed more as a backup this season but was stuck behind All-American Chop Robinson and All-Big Ten Adisa Isaac − both now leaving for the NFL.\n“Those are two guys with twitchy, great technique,” Isaac said, describing Vanover and Fisher. “Amin is probably not the fastest, but he’s very sound in what he does. He has big, powerful hands. So he’s a guy who’s not going to jump off the screen with his explosiveness, but he’s going to get (into the backfield) with relentlessness and that aggression.”\nThey should battle for a 2024 starting spot opposite of Dennis-Sutton.\nPenn State’s edge rusher group was so loaded this past year that Dennis-Sutton, a former five-star prospect, earned his only two starts when Robinson was injured.\nStill, he was named third-team All-Big Ten for his six tackles for loss, 3.5 sacks, two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery.\nDennis-Sutton also, finally, will be in the spotlight, too, during his third year on campus.\nFirst, he figures to star on Saturday against Ole Miss. He’ll take Robinson’s spot, who has opted out of the game.\n“He’s a guy that when he catches fire, he catches fire,” Isaac said of Dennis-Sutton. “And it can be real scary how quick he can rack up sacks and be disruptive.”\nFrank Bodani covers Penn State football for the York Daily Record and USA Today Network.

    "title": "The Passing of a Saintly Centenarian",
    "text": "Shortly before her 102nd birthday, on October 24, 2023, Wanda Poltawska passed into the next world. In the year 2021, when she became a centenarian, she joked to an interviewer that “For many people, I’m something of a museum piece!” Her modesty belied her history.\nA museum is where things of great value are displayed so that they can be appreciated for years to come. Dr. Poltawka is a person who should be long remembered for her courage, her tenacity, her determination, and her inestimable contribution to the Catholic Church.\nI had the distinct pleasure and honor of meeting this extraordinary human being at a private home. The year was 1990. The site was Toledo, Ohio. Wanda was on her way to Florida to visit one of her daughters. She related a series of extraordinary events to our small household gathering seated around the dining room table. We were most privileged and attentive to what she had to say.\nIn 1962, after being diagnosed as having throat cancer, doctors planned to subject her to a desperate medical procedure. The auxiliary bishop of Krakow, Karol Wojtyla, a close friend of Wanda, being very concerned about her condition, dispatched a letter to Padre Pio requesting his prayerful intervention: “Venerable Father, I ask that you pray for a forty-year-old mother of four girls, in Krakow, Poland (who during the last war spent five years in a concentration camp and possibly may die of cancer) that God may extend his mercy to this woman and her family in the presence of the Most Blessed Virgin. Most obligated in Christ, Karol Wojtyla.”\nThe now canonized Saint Padre Pio’s response was simple and reassuring: “To this request one cannot say, ‘no’.” He then asked the courier to save the letter “because one day it will become important”. The request proved prophetic. It was included in the canonization process when Karol Wojtyla was declared a saint of the Catholic Church.\nJust prior to the scheduled surgery Wanda Poltawska’s health was miraculously restored. Could the cure have been the result of Padre Pio’s intercession? Being a psychiatrist, trained in science, Dr. Poltawska wanted some shred of proof. She traveled to Pietrelcina, where the Capuchin friar resided. She found herself standing outside of a church and asking a passerby where Padre Pio might be. She was told that she was standing outside of the very church where he was saying Mass. She entered the church and sat down. During the celebration of the Mass, Padre Pio looked directly at this pilgrim from Poland, conveying to her the assurance that she was the woman for whom he had prayed. It was a miraculous meeting of minds and hearts concerning another miraculous meeting.\nThere was an additional occasion when Wanda Poltawska came close to death. This time her life was saved thanks to a friend. While imprisoned in the Ravensbrück concentration camp, a doctor, presuming that she was dead, threw her onto a pile of corpses. She was subsequently rescued by a friend who had seen her move a finger.\nShe experienced unspeakable deprivation and suffering at Ravensbrück for nearly five years. During that period, she experienced hunger that she later described as “monstrous and indescribable”. Nonetheless, she never allowed herself to become less than who she is: “I must, simply must get the better of my hungry body. I will not stop being myself just because I am hungry,” she later wrote. However, once she was released, she was back in that dreadful camp of horrors in her dreams. When she was in prison she dreamed of being home; when she was home she dreamed of being in prison. On the advice of a psychiatrist, she exorcized her nightmares by writing about them. This process of purgation led to the publication of her book, And I am Afraid of My Dreams. In her Foreword to the book, which she translated, Mary Craig appraises it as conveying “a priceless insight into a dark period of human history which we might prefer to forget, but which it might be better to try to understand.”\nWhile caring for a pregnant unmarried girl, she sought the help of a young priest by the name of Karol Wojtyla. It was the auspicious beginning of a lifelong friendship. When Wanda introduced her mother to Karol Wojtyla, she predicted that the young cleric would one day occupy the throne of Peter. Poltawska compared her friendship with the future pope with the spiritual bond that existed between St. Francis of Assisi and Saint Clare. Her association with John Paul II over the years was productive. She collaborated with him in his writing of Love and Responsibility and in was influential in his understanding of a true feminism which emphasizes the nature and dignity of women. When Wojtyla became Archbishop of Krakow, he founded a Family Institute in that city and placed Wanda Poltawska in charge.\nDr. Poltawska received her medical degree from Jagiellonian University in Krakow in 1951 and her doctorate in psychiatry in 1964. As a psychiatrist, she specialized in juvenile psychiatry. In this capacity she was able to help many of the unfortunate “Auschwitz children” who had been deeply traumatised in concentration camps.\nIt is impossible to think of Wanda Poltawska without thinking of God’s mercy. But it is also impossible to think of her and not to think of the human capacity for brutality. Dr. Poltawka is a powerful witness in our times that only through Christian heroism can we begin to make sense of life in the modern world.",
