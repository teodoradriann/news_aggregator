    "title": "The Best Donuts In SF",
    "text": "Julia Chen\nSenior Staff Writer, San Francisco\nJulia is a Bay Area native who has been eating and writing with Infatuation since 2020. Her quest to find SF's best dumplings is ongoing.\nSFGuide\nphoto credit: Carly Hackbarth\nDonuts are always a good idea. There’s nothing like a sugary, pillowy ring of fried dough to give us a burst of energy in the morning or power us through a questionable all-nighter. And lucky for us, there are tons of great donut spots in SF. Here are 11 of our favorites.\nNo rating: This is a restaurant we want to re-visit before rating, or it’s a coffee shop, bar, or dessert shop. We only rate spots where you can eat a full meal.\nWhat makes the brioche donuts at George’s Donuts & Merriment special is their light and airy texture. If it weren’t for the generous injections of cream, we’d be worried they’d fly away when the Muni barrels by. There’s no going wrong with any of the brioche donuts—if you only have room for one or two, you should get the Bacon and Eggs and the key lime pie (feel free to skip the apple fritter that’s dry and has no fruit flavor). This West Portal cafe does sell out of their brioche donuts the quickest, but the vanilla or chocolate-glazed crullers are also a great fallback. If you have time, ask to dine in so that you can order the fried-to-order donut holes that come with a chocolate fudge dipping sauce.\nSoaking in the sun at Dolores Park is one way to instantly feel good. Another is to just walk up to Mochill Mochidonut. At the Japantown mall kiosk, ring-shaped mochi donuts that come in an assortment of fun colors and glazes are the name of the game. Rich dark chocolate, matcha oreo, black sesame, even one with puffy Fruity Pebbles on top will beckon you from behind the small glass case. But aside from looking like something we want to dedicate an entire scrapbook to, these donuts are incredible. They’re super chewy and taste about as close to literal sunshine as you can get.\nThis family-run spot in the Sunset nails classic donuts, from maple bacon and old fashioneds to chocolate bars and pillowy cinnamon twists. But their creative weekend specials are what keep us coming back—think Bavarian crème brûlée, PB&J, and mochi donuts with colorful glazes. It’s also one of the few spots with vegan options (the one glazed with sweet guava is our go-to). Grab a white chocolate mocha or frappe to wash it all down.\nWhat makes the city’s only German pastry shop special is the attention to detail chef and owner Ha Do puts into her beautiful cakes, pies, and other sweets. Case in point: the Berliner. These seasonal jam and custard-filled donuts are fluffy and light thanks to the sunflower seed oil they’re fried in, and topped with a super fine powdered sugar that gets all over the place (in a delightfully messy way) with every bite. Hahdough has two locations you can order a box of a dozen from—the original takeout window in Hayes Valley, and a larger spot in NoPa. Or just pop into either spot to pick up a few to go.\nThe promise of a tangy, sweet passion fruit milk chocolate donut from Dynamo Donut & Coffee is one foolproof way to get us out of bed in the morning. Another? Getting to choose from their rotating list of donuts with unique, seasonal flavors (before inevitably ordering one of each), like lemon szechuan, blackberry crumb, or zucchini oat. They have vegan and gluten-free options, plus espresso drinks and tea. You can pick up these fantastic donuts at their shop in the Mission or their small kiosk on the Bay Trail in the Marina.\nBob’s Donuts on Polk Street in Nob Hill fries up incredible classic glazed donuts and apple fritters, all day, every day. Which is great news if you love donuts more than your pet (if so, please consider getting their “giant donut” and taking \"The Challenge\"). And, cool fact: This 24-hour spot has been churning out puffy, airy classics since the 1960s. Head to Bob’s newer location in NoPa if you’re in the area (though, it’s only open until 9pm).\nUncle Benny’s in the Sunset is a great spot for a quick breakfast—they have tons of bagel sandwiches, coffee, and fresh juices. But chances are very high that something from their neatly organized case of colorful, fresh-made donuts will call to you. They focus on classic flavors here, like apple fritters, sprinkle donuts, glazed old fashioneds, and maple bacon, all of which will immediately send sugar coursing through your veins, in the best way. Fill a big box with an assortment of flavors and take it across the street to Golden Gate Park.\nIf you’re looking for a classic donut spot to satisfy a 3am craving, this is the place. There are multiple locations in SF, but the Noe Valley outpost is the one open 24-hours. No matter what time of day it is, you’ll always find the coffee pots full, and the pastry case stocked and well-lit, like a beacon after a night of bar-hopping down Valencia. The apple fritters at this place are bigger than a newborn baby’s head, the old fashioneds are always perfectly cakey, and even better—nothing costs more than $2.50.\nWhen you see the word “DONUTS” in big green letters running down a sign on a white corner building, you’ll know you’ve made it. All Stars Donuts in the Richmond is where we go to fill up on sprinkle-covered donut holes, maple donuts dotted with bacon, and cinnamon twists that are softer than our Tempurpedic mattress topper. The old-school spot has a few cafeteria-style tables to eat your donuts if you want to stay a while, but we like to take a few pounds of donuts to Golden Gate Park and sample each in the sun.\nYou’re at this old-school Mission institution for gooey, overstuffed, jam- and cream-filled desserts. While the donuts decidedly have a classic feel, fun combinations like chocolate raspberry jam, mango jam, and orange vanilla cream make this place stand out. Their old fashioned and classic donuts tend to be on the chewier side (and not in a good way), but the way the jelly and cream literally fill your mouth with joy more than makes up for it. Grab some extra napkins—you’re likely going to splat some jelly on your shirt. And bring cash.\nDonut World is a small shop in the Inner Sunset with greasy-spoon-diner feels—just without the seats, or the diner food, for that matter. Instead, this place has a wide selection of donuts available until 11:30pm (or 12pm on the weekends)—and in the somewhat-sleepy Inner Sunset, that's worth a ton. The old fashioned donuts are the way to go—the thick cake-like batter melts in your mouth. Out of all of the donuts, the maple old fashioned is a nutty hit, but you’ll always leave happy with a plain glazed or anything covered in sprinkles.\nFrom scoops, cones, and cookie sandwiches, here's where to get your ice cream fix.\nYes, there are actually spots to get a meal after 11pm. Here’s where to find them.\nSenior Staff Writer, San Francisco\nJulia is a Bay Area native who has been eating and writing with Infatuation since 2020.

    "text": "A DANCE FOR CAGSAWA The Cagsawa HistoriKultura Dance Troupe, representing the Cagsawa Festival of Daraga, wins the street dance presentation during the culminating event of Albay’s Magayon Festival held in Legazpi City on Friday. The performance of the contingent, composed of students from the town’s different barangays, reflected the rich and colorful history of the historic village of Cagsawa, which is famous for the ruins of the church destroyed by Mayon Volcano’s eruption in 1814, and the town of Daraga itself. —Mark Alvic Esplana\nLEGAZPI CITY, ALBAY, Philippines — Clad in colorful festival attire, contingents from different towns and cities in Albay swayed to the beat of the drums, and celebrated both faith and Bicolano culture during the street dance competition on Friday at the culmination of the monthlong Magayon Festival in the province.\nWith a performance focused on honoring Catholic traditions, the Cagsawa Festival of Daraga town, the Coron Festival of Tiwi town, and the Sarung Banggi Festival of Sto. Domingo town took the top three honors.\nADVERTISEMENT The Cagsawa Festival, which bagged the P500,000 first prize for the street presentation and P50,000 for best in moving choreography, celebrated the culture and faith of Albayanos and commemorated the 1814 eruption of Mayon Volcano that destroyed the Cagsawa Church and left hundreds of people dead.\nFEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO Mayor Alice Guo’s DNA test no longer feasible NEWSINFO Alice Guo ordered suspended as mayor of Bamban, Tarlac NEWSINFO Duterte ordered transfer of P47.6 billion COVID funds to PS-DBM – Duque READ: Bicol Loco festival kicks off with colorful hot air balloons\nThe Coron Festival contingent, which took home P400,000 in cash for street presentation, was accompanied by a float designed to look like a pilgrimage boat, with the image of Our Lady of Salvation and belfry of the town’s church. Tiwi’s float came first, with P50,000 in cash prize.\nSarung Banggi Festival, meanwhile, received P300,000 for its street presentation.\nThe contingents from Legazpi City and the towns of Tiwi, Daraga, Sto. Domingo and Manito performed their tribal dances at a kilometer stretch of Rizal Street in Legazpi, from Vel Amor Subdivision to Peñaranda Park.\nTourism, trade boost The festival took a hiatus when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in March 2020 and returned last year, but with less fanfare and only for two weeks, said Dorothy Colle, Albay’s provincial tourism officer.\nThis year, about 80 events were scheduled for the whole month of May, with the hope of boosting tourism and trade in the province.\nADVERTISEMENT Colle said one of the highlights was the Marian fluvial parade held on May 1, to introduce Our Lady of Salvation, a revered Catholic icon of the village of Joroan of Tiwi, with the hope that the chapel where the image is ensconced would “hopefully become a national shrine.”\n“We also want to introduce faith tourism here in Albay, [as] we have culture and arts, ecological activities, and now this kind of event to invite tourists and devotees,” Colle said in a phone interview on Saturday.\nHundreds of Marian devotees joined the 62-km “Inang Magayon Maritime Procession” from Joroan’s pier to Sawangan Park at Legazpi Boulevard on May 1.\nHerbie Aguas, director of the Department of Tourism Bicol, said activities like these would benefit local businesses, especially the local transportation, restaurants, hotels, and other tourist-related establishments.\n“If we look at Camarines Sur, why they are number one in tourist arrival [all year round], it’s because of [the] Peñafrancia [Festival] … and the devotees of ‘Ina’ [who] flock every [September] in Naga City,” Aguas said in a private chat message on Saturday.\n ",

    "text": "Le partenariat stratégique vise à obtenir du nickel, du cuivre et du cobalt plus propres dans le cadre du projet Kabanga Nickel pour l’industrie japonaise des batteries\nChris Showalter, PDG de Lifezone Metals Limited ( NYSE : LZM ), a le plaisir d’annoncer la signature d’un protocole d’accord avec la Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC) (JOGMEC). Ce partenariat stratégique vise à soutenir les efforts de la JOGMEC pour obtenir des métaux plus propres pour l’industrie japonaise des batteries dans le cadre du projet Kabanga Nickel.\nLe site de Kabanga est l’un des plus grands et des plus riches gisements de sulfure de nickel non exploités au monde, avec du cuivre et du cobalt comme sous-produits. En utilisant la technologie Hydromet de Lifezone, le projet devrait permettre de réduire considérablement les émissions par rapport aux méthodes de fusion traditionnelles.\nM. Showalter a déclaré : « Kabanga est un gisement de nickel à haute teneur de classe mondiale et nous nous réjouissons de l’occasion qui nous est donnée de faire de la JOGMEC un partenaire stratégiquement aligné. Avec BHP comme partenaire pour le développement du projet, la Société Générale comme conseiller financier principal pour le processus de financement du projet, le soutien de la U.S. International Development Finance Corporation et du gouvernement de la Tanzanie, et maintenant cette coopération stratégique avec la JOGMEC – une agence administrative indépendante du gouvernement japonais axée sur l’énergie et les métaux –, nous constatons qu’il existe clairement une intention de faire avancer ce projet d’importance mondiale au bénéfice de tous les partenaires et de toutes les parties prenantes. »\nSelon les termes du protocole d’accord, Lifezone collaborera avec la JOGMEC afin de faciliter l’approvisionnement en métaux venant de Kabanga, grâce à la part des droits de commercialisation détenue par Lifezone pour le marché en pleine croissance des batteries au Japon, garantissant une chaîne de valeur des métaux durable et traçable. Cette initiative est conforme à l’engagement de Lifezone et de la JOGMEC de promouvoir des pratiques minières responsables et de soutenir la transition mondiale vers l’énergie propre.\nLa JOGMEC envisagera d’apporter un soutien financier aux entreprises japonaises lorsqu’elle aura soumis une demande au programme de soutien financier du gouvernement japonais. Cet investissement potentiel souligne à quel point le projet Kabanga Nickel est important pour répondre à la demande croissante de l’industrie japonaise pour des métaux plus propres.\nLe protocole d’accord n’est pas contraignant et n’impose aucune obligation à l’une ou l’autre des parties.\nLa JOGMEC est une agence administrative indépendante du gouvernement japonais dont la mission est d’assurer un approvisionnement stable et abordable en énergie et en ressources minérales afin de renforcer la base industrielle du Japon.\nLe Japon est un partenaire du Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), qui vise à accélérer le développement de chaînes d’approvisionnement diversifiées et durables en minéraux énergétiques essentiels, en collaborant avec les gouvernements hôtes et l’industrie afin de faciliter un soutien financier ciblé et diplomatique pour des projets stratégiques tout au long de la chaîne de valeur. Les partenaires du MSP comprennent l’Allemagne, l’Australie, le Canada, l’Estonie, les États-Unis, la Finlande, la France, l’Inde, l’Italie, le Japon, la Norvège, la République de Corée, le Royaume-Uni, la Suède et l’Union européenne (représentée par la Commission européenne).\nLa JOGMEC et l’U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) sont toutes deux membres du réseau de financement du MSP récemment annoncé et le projet Kabanga Nickel a été reconnu comme un projet du MSP.\nSi vous souhaitez recevoir les alertes de Lifezone Metals, veuillez vous inscrire ici.\nRéseaux sociaux\nLinkedIn | X | YouTube\nÀ propos de Lifezone Metals\nÀ Lifezone Metals (NYSE : LZM), notre mission est de fournir une production de métaux plus propre ainsi que leur recyclage. Grâce à une plateforme évolutive soutenue par notre technologie Hydromet, nous assurons une production de métaux moins énergivore, moins polluante et moins coûteuse que les fonderies traditionnelles.\nNotre projet Kabanga Nickel en Tanzanie est considéré comme l’un des plus grands et des plus riches gisements de sulfure de nickel non exploités au monde. En y associant notre technologie Hydromet, nous nous efforçons de déverrouiller une nouvelle source de nickel, de cuivre et de cobalt de qualité LME (London Metal Exchange) pour les marchés mondiaux des métaux de batteries, afin de donner les moyens à la Tanzanie d’obtenir une pleine création de valeur et de devenir la prochaine meilleure source de nickel de catégorie 1.\nGrâce à notre partenariat de recyclage du platine, du palladium et du rhodium aux États-Unis, nous travaillons à démontrer que notre technologie Hydromet peut traiter et récupérer les métaux du groupe platine à partir de convertisseurs catalytiques automobiles usagés de manière responsable, de manière plus propre et plus efficace que les méthodes conventionnelles de fusion et de raffinage.\nwww.lifezonemetals.com\nÉnoncés prospectifs\nCertains énoncés faits dans les présentes ne sont pas des faits historiques, mais peuvent être considérés comme des énoncés prospectifs au sens du Securities Act of 1933, tel que modifié, du Securities Exchange Act de 1934, tel que modifié, et des dispositions relatives à la sphère de sécurité (safe harbor) du Private Securities Litigation Reform Act de 1995 concernant, entre autres, les plans, stratégies et perspectives, tant commerciaux que financiers, de Lifezone Metals Limited et de ses filiales et/ou sociétés affiliées.\nEn général, les déclarations qui ne sont pas des faits historiques, y compris les déclarations concernant les actions futures possibles ou présumées, les stratégies commerciales, les événements ou les résultats d'exploitation, et toutes les déclarations qui se réfèrent à des projections, prévisions ou autres caractérisations d'événements ou de circonstances futurs, y compris les hypothèses sous-jacentes, sont des énoncés prospectifs.

    "text": "Hundreds of supporters from Pakistani Islamist parties on Friday rallied to protest against what they say were blasphemous remarks by the country's chief justice. The protest call, by various religious and political groups led by hardline Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) whose rallying cry is \"death to blasphemers\", said that remarks by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa in a case against a member of the minority Ahmadi community were blasphemous. The court had granted bail to an Ahmadi community member earlier this week, ruling that blasphemy charges against him did not stand. The man, accused of blasphemy for distributing Islamic literature, had been in jail for 13 months. \"We (will) monitor the sermons and protests outside mosques,\" said police official Abrar Hussain in southern city of Karahci, warning the protesters to remain peaceful. Hundreds of the protesters took to streets in the northwestern city of Peshawar, chanting slogans against the chief justice, said police official Mubarak Khan. The top court on Thursday issued a statement after the Islamist parties and some political groups launched a campaign accusing the chief justice of deviating in his ruling from the constitutional definition of a Muslim, which excludes Ahmadis. \"This impression is absolutely wrong,\" the court statement said, deploring what it called a \"vicious campaign\" against Isa. The campaign against Isa was also joined by some supporters and aides of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who think a ruling by the chief justice stripping Khan's party of its symbol on ballots cost them votes in an election on Feb. 8. Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party's information secretary Rauf Hasan did not respond to a request for a comment. Human rights groups say Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores, and just accusing someone of such a crime could lead to mob justice. Judges hesitate to take up such cases for fear of retribution, which leaves accused languishing in jail for years without cases being heard. Blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan. No one has been executed by the state for it, but numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs.",

    "title": "Chinese threat actors behind \"widespread\" exploitation of Ivanti VPN zero-day",
    "text": "Share this article on:\nSecurity researchers at Mandiant are confident that Chinese hackers are behind an ongoing malware campaign exploiting a flaw in Ivanti Connect Secure appliances.\nChinese-backed hackers are very likely exploiting a [recently revealed zero-day vulnerability in Ivanti VPN devices](https://www.cyberdaily.au/security/11557-ivanti-warns-of-active-exploitation-of-a-bug-in-its-connect-secure-appliances), deploying a raft of malware on targeted appliances.\nResearchers at Google’s Mandiant cyber security division were initially responsible for disclosing CVE-2025-0282, and Mandiant and Ivanti are continuing to investigate the campaign at the time of writing.\nCVE-2025-0282 is an unauthenticated stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability that could lead to a threat actor executing code remotely on an impacted device, which in turn could lead to the compromise of an entire network.\nMandiant is currently studying multiple infected devices and has found several families of malware, particularly the SPAWNANT installer, SPAWNMOLE tunneler and the SPAWNSNAIL SSH backdoor.\nResearchers have also observed what appears to be new malware being deployed by the threat actor, which Mandiant has dubbed DRYHOOK and PHASEJAM.\nWhile the SPAWN family of malware has been seen to be used by a group of Chinese threat actors dubbed UNC5337, the latter two have not been linked to a particular threat group.\nUNC5337 has been exploiting compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPN appliances since at least January 2024, and has links to another Chinese threat actor, tracked as UNC5221. Both have been seen to engage in cyber espionage activities. Once persistence has been maintained on a network, the groups deploy tunnellers to communicate with their command and control infrastructure, perform network reconnaissance, and harvest credentials.\nMandiant expects the espionage activity to continue against “a wide range of countries and verticals”.\n“Mandiant assesses that defenders should be prepared for widespread, opportunistic exploitation, likely targeting credentials and the deployment of web shells to provide future access,” Mandiant said in a January 9 blog post.\n“Additionally, if proof-of-concept exploits for CVE-2025-0282 are created and released, Mandiant assesses it is likely additional threat actors may attempt targeting Ivanti Connect Secure appliances.”\nYou can learn more about [Mandiant’s analysis of the exploitation here](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/ivanti-connect-secure-vpn-zero-day).\nIn addition, the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre released its own Act Now Critical Alert regarding CVE-2025-0282 and CVE-2025-0283 yesterday.\n“This Alert is relevant to Australian Organisations who use Ivanti Connect Secure, Ivanti Policy Secure and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA Gateways. This alert is intended to be understood by technical users,” the ACSC said on January 9.\n“Customers are encouraged to patch to the latest version of Ivanti Connect Secure, Ivanti Policy Secure and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA Gateways, where available and apply advice detailed in Ivanti’s Security Advisory.”\nDavid Hollingworth has been writing about technology for over 20 years, and has worked for a range of print and online titles in his career. He is enjoying getting to grips with cyber security, especially when it lets him talk about Lego.",
