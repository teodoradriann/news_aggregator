    "title": "“Ho sempre voluto lavorare con Disney”. Le rivelazioni nella nuova biografia di Keith Haring",
    "text": "“Ho sempre voluto lavorare con Disney”. Le rivelazioni nella nuova biografia di Keith Haring\nDopo averlo tanto desiderato, il writer statunitense ricevette una proposta di collaborazione da parte della Disney. Peccato che la lettera arrivò solo nel 1990, poco prima della sua morte\nNato il 4 maggio 1958 a Reading, in Pennsylvania,\nKeith Haring ha subito rivelato una forte inclinazione per il disegno. Una propensione incoraggiata dal padre e influenzata dai personaggi di fumetti americani e cartoni, soprattutto quelli della Disney. “Ho sempre voluto lavorare per Walt Disney quando stavo crescendo”, raccontava il giovane writer statunitense. “In qualche modo penso sia uno dei tre artisti più importanti del XX secolo insieme a Warhol e Picasso“. Un ascendente che ha forgiato alcune delle opere più note di Haring, come i disegni di Mickey Mouse realizzati nel 1980 traendo ispirazione dalla Pop Art e dai graffiti. Nel corso della sua carriera, Haring ha provato diverse volte a entrare in collaborazione con la casa di produzione americana, ma senza successo. La svolta arriva nel 1990, quando la Disney invia una proposta di collaborazione all’artista. A rivelarlo è Brad Gooch, autore di Radiant: The Life and Line of Keith Haring, la nuova biografia di Keith Haring, in uscita a marzo.\nLa proposta di collaborazione di Walt Disney per Keith Haring\nDell’arrivo di una lettera da parte della Disney ne aveva già parlato la critica Ingrid Sischy nel 1997 (come si legge su Artnew.com), ma il suo contenuto non era ancora stato approfondito.\nOggi, Googh rivela i dettagli della proposta di collaborazione in Radiant: The Life and Line of Keith Haring, sottolineando che l’artista veniva sollecitato per il progetto Mickey Mouse visto attraverso gli occhi di Keith Haring. Purtroppo, la lettera arrivò solo nel 1990, poco prima della morte dell’artista. Questi era a conoscenza del sollecito da parte della casa di produzione ma, oscillando tra momenti di lucidità e altri di smarrimento, Haring pensò che fosse una bugia nel tentavo di alleviare parte del suo dolore. In ogni caso, l’artista non avrebbe avuto le facoltà per potersi dedicare a un lavoro del genere.\nLa collaborazione tra la Disney e Keith Haring\nPossiamo dire che il sogno dell’artista è diventato realtà postumo, nel 2021, quando la Keith Haring Foundation e la Disney hanno iniziato a produrre orologi Swatch, magliette Uniqlo e borse Coach utilizzando le opere d’arte originali Disney Mickey Mouse di Keith Haring. “Il rispetto e l’ammirazione di Keith Haring per Walt Disney, in particolare per l’amato Topolino, sono serviti come ispirazione per alcuni dei suoi pezzi iconici”, precisano dalla Fondazione. “Collaborando con Disney, siamo in grado di dare vita alle sue opere d’arte attraverso un nuovo mezzo e continuare a celebrare la sua influenza duratura sulla comunità artistica e sulle generazioni future”.\nValentina Muzi\nArtribune è anche su Whatsapp. È sufficiente\ncliccare qui per iscriversi al canale ed essere sempre aggiornati",

    "title": "A warm, dry spring has U.S. forecasters worried about the upcoming wildfire season",
    "text": "A warm, dry spring has U.S. forecasters worried about the upcoming wildfire season Most of the United States is expected to see warmer-than-average temperatures this spring, federal forecasters say, with dry conditions likely in the West. That's raising concerns about wildfires, especially in parts of the Southwest, Great Plains, and the Upper Mississippi River Valley, said Jon Gottschalck, operations branch chief at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center. The southern High Plains, in particular, which includes Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, is going to be \"quite vulnerable to high wildfire risk, especially during high wind events,\" Gottschalck said Thursday on a call with reporters. Texas recently suffered the largest wildfire in the state's history, which investigators [say was started by power lines](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/us/texas-smokehouse-creek-fire-xcel-energy.html). In the Mid-Atlantic this week, high winds [helped fuel blazes](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/us/virginia-wv-wildfires.html) in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland. NOAA [released its Spring Outlook](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/spring-outlook-warmer-for-most-of-us-wetter-in-southeast) amid a stretch of record warm weather. Last month was the [hottest February on record](https://www.noaa.gov/news/earth-just-had-its-warmest-february-on-record), and 2023 was the [hottest year ever](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/28/1221827923/2023-hottest-year-record-climate-change). High average temperatures last year were exacerbated by a strong El Niño climate pattern, which is a [natural cycle](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/05/1186098964/with-el-nino-and-climate-change-this-week-saw-some-of-the-hottest-recorded-weath) that heats water in the Pacific Ocean and raises average temperatures worldwide. Gottschalck said the effects of the current El Niño are expected to weaken through the spring. But recent heat records are part of a longer warming trend that scientists expect to continue as climate change intensifies. Global temperatures are rising because of the accumulation of greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, [according to the World Meteorological Organization](https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/climate-change-indicators-reached-record-levels-2023-wmo#:~:text=The%20WMO%20report%20confirmed%20that,ten%2Dyear%20period%20on%20record.), which is part of the United Nations. Those greenhouse gasses come from humans burning fossil fuels. \"Climate change is affecting the timing, intensity, and duration of weather events in the United States,\" Rick Spinrad, NOAA's administrator, said in a news release. Forecasters also warned of low water levels on the Mississippi River this summer because of below-average snowpack and precipitation in the Northern Plains and the Midwest. Ed Clark, director of the National Water Center, said low-flow conditions could affect navigation on the entire Mississippi River system, as well as water supplies for communities and industries. NOAA doesn't expect major flooding anywhere in the country this spring. Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

    "text": "Alibaba Group Holding has reiterated its commitment to China’s AI and consumer markets, according to chief financial officer Toby Xu Hong in an interview with Xinhua.\nAlibaba is a China-based technology company operating in e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital infrastructure.\nXu said the company has allocated 380 billion yuan (US$52 billion) for AI-related infrastructure and an additional 50 billion yuan (US$6.97 billion) for subsidies benefiting merchants and consumers.\nThese investments are aimed at supporting technology and internet service development in China.\nXu cited encouragement from a February business symposium attended by President Xi Jinping and leading entrepreneurs, which influenced Alibaba’s recent strategic decisions.\nIn February, Alibaba announced plans to spend at least 380 billion yuan (US$53 billion) over three years on AI, cloud computing, and related infrastructure, surpassing its total spending in these sectors over the past decade.\n🔗 Source: South China Morning Post\n🧠 Food for thought 1️⃣ Alibaba’s investment reflects China’s rapidly expanding AI market dynamics Alibaba’s $52 billion AI commitment comes as China’s AI sector reaches unprecedented scale, with over 5,100 AI companies representing 15% of the global total and 71 recognized unicorns 1 .\nThe Chinese AI market was valued at 747 billion yuan ($103 billion) in 2024 and is projected to exceed 1 trillion yuan by 2025, indicating the massive opportunity driving Alibaba’s substantial investment 1 .\nThis isn’t Alibaba’s first major AI bet. The company previously led a $600 million funding round for facial recognition startup SenseTime in 2019, when it became the world’s most valuable private AI startup 2 .\nAlibaba also developed its own Hanguang 800 AI inference chip in 2019, which improved machine learning tasks by 12 times and reduced the time to categorize 1 billion product images from one hour to just five minutes 3 .\nThe scale of current investment reflects intensifying competition, as rivals like Baidu have achieved significant milestones with their ERNIE Bot gaining over 200 million users and handling 1.65 billion daily API calls by late 2024 4 .\n2️⃣ Investment timing capitalizes on renewed government support for private sector participation The announcement follows China’s Private Economy Promotion Law, which aims to support private enterprises that contribute over 60% of GDP and 80% of urban jobs 5 .\nAlibaba CFO Toby Xu linked the investment decision to President Xi Jinping’s February business symposium with entrepreneurs, indicating how policy signals directly influence private sector capital allocation.\nChina’s public sector AI spending alone is expected to exceed 400 billion yuan in 2025, while total AI investments reached approximately $209 billion from 2013 to 2023, demonstrating the government’s commitment to the sector 1 .\nThe AI sector is projected to add 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points to China’s annual GDP growth, equivalent to $930 billion in labor value by 2025, making private sector participation strategically important for national economic goals 1 .\nRecent Alibaba developments",
