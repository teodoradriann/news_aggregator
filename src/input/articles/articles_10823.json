Key points - Battle to contain Port Hills fire in its third day. - The fire is now more than 70% contained but it may be weeks before it is fully out. - A state of emergency was declared on Wednesday evening for Christchurch City, including Banks Peninsula, and Selwyn District. - 33 homes in Christchurch are still unable to be accessed, down from 110. One dwelling has been destroyed. - Some cordons have been shifted to allow evacuated residents to move back home to areas where it is safe - Civil Defence said while the smoke may look like it is \"diminishing\" there is no room for complacency: \"Please don't think it's over\". - People should stay away from the fire area and not fly drones. Crews have made good progress today against the massive blaze in Christchurch's Port Hills, but it is not yet fully contained. The blaze, which has now burnt through 650ha, was first reported at 2.15pm on Wednesday on Worsleys Rd, Cracroft, in the south of the city, where fire officials said vegetation had caught alight. Today there were 95 Fenz staff on site, but Christchurch mayor Phil Mauger told media \"it could take days, it could take weeks\" for it to be fully extinguished and officials say there were still many areas of concern. Fire and Emergency New Zealand incident controller Dave Stackhouse said late this afternoon crews had made good progress and the fire was more than 70% contained, \"but we're not yet at 100\". He said the fire had not exceeded the 650ha, 14km perimeter established earlier. He said crews had time through to Sunday \"to really knock this fire\". Wind changes expected from then would determine how they continued working to extinguish it. Crews were today being supported by 22 trucks and tankers, 12 helicopters, two fixed wing aircraft and five diggers. Stackhouse said this morning that the fire was about 70 percent contained. Any threats from overnight were nullified, thanks to the public calling 111. \"Today we are going to hit it hard with a bigger number of firefighters to really focus on strengthening fire breaks. It is still very much an active fire ground with heavy machinery and helicopters at work. \"Firefighters are working incredibly hard to get to a position where we can allow residents to return to their homes and get some normality, and this remains our priority. \"Today there will be a heavy presence on the Summit Rd and Worsley Spur as crews focus on containing the fire.\" He said the public had been \"outstanding\" and thanked them for their support: \"We can't sit on our laurels though. We have to maintain the pressure and really nail this thing.\" Mauger said there was a far greater feeling of comfort on the fireground today. However, he said \"it could take days, it could take weeks\" until all the hotspots were out, but there was a greater sense of calm among firefighters and other authorities. \"We went out early, we hit it hard and it's great, but we mustn't take our foot off the throttle because there's still a long way to go. It could take days, it could take weeks to get the hot spots out of it.\" 'STAY VIGILANT' The commander of the Port Hills fire response says any returning residents will need to remain vigilant for flare-ups for some time. Operations commander Des Irving told a community meeting today that some Worsleys Rd residents might soon be able to return to their homes after the fire ground was inspected. Irving said there were \"some flare ups\" overnight and people \"did the right thing\". \"They called 111 and we responded accordingly and that's exactly what we want to happen so for those people going back - if that eventuates - into their homes, you still must remain vigilant for some time.\" Canterbury group controller for Civil Defence Richard Ball said efforts were now moving to a recovery phase. \"Everybody was relieved this morning to see the fire was visibly reduced. However, we will continue to work until it is safe for people to re-enter their properties.\" A state of emergency remains in place for Christchurch City, including Banks Peninsula, and Selwyn District. Homes were evacuated in Early Valley, Worsley Spur, Hoon Hay Valley, Kennedys Bush and Selwyn. However, a Christchurch City Council spokesperson said just 33 homes remained evacuated in the Christchurch area, down from 80 yesterday. All 30 evacuated households in the Selwyn area had been allowed to go home, they said. A southerly wind change overnight sparked a warning for Christchurch residents that they could wake to a strong smell of smoke - but the wind has now dropped significantly, helping firefighting efforts. Twenty-eight fire crews took over from overnight teams this morning, supported by 15 helicopters dropping water on the fire and two fixed wing aircraft. Fenz and police said it was too early to say what caused the fire - which ignited almost seven years to the day of the 2017 Port Hills blaze. Fire and police investigators were trying to work out “whether there [was] any human involvement”. Canterbury Inspector Ash Tabb said this morning police still wanted seeking information and videos from the public around the time the fire ignited on Wednesday afternoon. He also reminded people not to visit the fire area unless they had a legitimate reason to do so. People coming to \"have a look\" at the area was a \"big stress\" for residents.\" \"We only want bona fide visitors - residents, contractors - in the area.\" Emergency Management Minister Mark Mitchell this morning reiterated police's call for the public not to visit the fire area or fly drones. \"You've got helicopter pilots in the area who are really concentrating hard on getting water onto the fire area and an unauthorised drone can take a helicopter down.\" Mitchell acknowledged the hard work of the emergency services. \"I have no doubt in my mind that it was the speed of the response ... that has got much better and faster control of this fire.\" He thanked the community for the \"enormous pastoral support\" put around affected residents and media for their role in getting information out to the public and providing reassurance. Emergency services showed The New Zealand Herald their control centre at the top of the mountain range yesterday, situated to the south of the city, from where the full impact of the blaze was apparent. Smouldering trees and a vast expanse of scorched scrubland could be seen over the landscape. Plumes of smoke were billowing out and trees were consumed by flames. It had spread to the Christchurch Adventure Park, which was affected by the 2017 fire. Christchurch Mayor Phil Mauger said \"maybe we have to look at\" how the Port Hills were managed in the future to prevent fires. He said the long grass was part of the natural area, but also acted as fuel. Changes were made after the 2017 blaze about what people should be planting on their land, and they were advised on what to do if a fire breaks out. But forestry was a different story. COOLER DAY BEFORE HOT WEEKEND MetService meteorologist John Law told RNZ's Morning Report programme today the wind today would be \"a lot lighter\" than what Christchurch experienced yesterday. The wind was expected to change from a southerly back to a to northeasterly this evening. Smoke would be \"drifting a little bit closer towards Christchurch\" throughout the day. The thing to watch out for, Law said, was wind starting to pick up in the region towards the end of the weekend - not ideal conditions for firefighting. Today's high will be 21degC, down from 28degC yesterday, but it was due to get hotter towards the end of the weekend. A high of 27degC was forecast for Monday. - NZ Herald, RNZ, ODT Online, Star News",

    "text": "“My name is Kathy, and I am an alcoholic.”\nSo starts the Meet the Founder page of Kathy VandenBerghe’s dating app, Sober Dating … One Date at a Time . VandenBerghe is what you might call an accidental entrepreneur; a female founder who started her business simply because she needed it at a pivotal point in her life - and it didn’t yet exist.\nTurning Personal Tragedy Into Opportunity\nVandenBerghe’s story is an inspiring example of how strong female leaders can turn tragedy into opportunity. As a young woman, the California native married a Wall Street executive, moved to Greenwich, CT and raised four children. At 49 years old, her marriage ended, and she spent the next 10 years celebrating her independence - with alcohol.\n“There was always a celebration and there was always champagne,” VandenBerghe shared. Her ten-year party ended tragically in a hotel room in Las Vegas. “I woke up on the bathroom floor and murdered about 20 relationships with drunk texting.” She called a friend for help and that day embarked on her journey to sobriety.\nVandenBerghe celebrated one year of sobriety during the pandemic and was ready to get back in the dating game. “It was important to me that I date someone who is as mindful about their drinking as I am,” she said. She searched for sober dating apps and found none. It was at that moment that her mission - create an inclusive dating app that creates community and connects like-minded people committed to sobriety - took shape.\nMORE FOR YOU What s Going On With Reacher Season 2 Fight Choreography Reacher Season 2 Is Now Officially One Of The Worst Shows On TV Satoshi Woke Up Legend Of Bitcoin s Mystery Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Suddenly Deepens Finding the White Space The online dating industry is huge - and growing. More than 380 million people around the world used online dating apps in 2023. And options for online daters are abundant, with platforms catering to a wide variety of characteristics, including religious beliefs (Jdate, Christian Mingle), age (SilverSingles, SeniorMatch) and orientation (Grindr, HER).\nYet, among all the dating platforms, VandenBerghe couldn’t find one that connected people committed to living a sober life (that includes drugs and alcohol.) In other words, she found that white space, or what Harvard Business School describes as, “a place where a company might have room to maneuver in a crowded playing field.” And she set out to monetize that white space.\n“I thought, ‘You know what universe? I can do this. I’ve got some great ideas,’” VandenBerghe said. “So, I threw it out there and the universe answered. She gave me all the people. She gave me app developers, ex-employees at Apple and engineers. And people just started showing up.” Ten months later Sober Dating was available in the App Store.\nThat was just over two years ago, and the app has been downloaded more than three million times and has close to one million active (paid) users from 59 countries around the world, including the US, India, the United Kingdom, Pakistan and Cambodia.\nIt’s clear this app filled a void. User testimonials include expressions of gratitude such as, “I choose Sober Dating for the connections I am able to make with potential partners that are also fulfilled by a life of clarity, and free from drugs and alcohol” and “Sober Dating has quickly become my favorite dating app because it removes that initial hurdle of vetting potential matches that also don’t drink.”\nRiding The Trend VandenBerghe’s motivation to start Sober Dating was clearly personal. But she has, perhaps inadvertently, tapped into a trend - and a market segment - that is strong, growing and lucrative. Sobriety is no longer a taboo topic kept hidden for fear of judgment. “We are starting to recover out loud,” said VandenBerghe. “It’s no longer shameful. People are talking about it more. I think the stigma is really melting away.” Here’s why.\nIncreased focus on mindfulness and wellness. We are in the midst of a seismic shift towards mindfulness and wellness and that shift often includes avoiding or limiting alcohol consumption.\nThis shift can easily be seen in alcohol industry statistics. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that U.S. beer shipments for 2023 are expected to have hit their lowest level in a quarter-century. At the same time, sales of non-alcoholic beer, wine and spirits are on the rise, increasing 54% in the first half of 2023 and 73% during Sober October last year, according to alcohol delivery program Drizly.\nGen Z drinks less. Alcohol consumption by younger consumers is on the decline. Gen Zers are drinking about 20% less alcohol than millennials did at their age. And many are forgoing booze entirely. A study revealed that the share of college-age students abstaining completely from alcohol has grown from 20 to 28 percent over the last two decades. The decline is thought to be attributed in part to an increased focus on health as well as a shift toward the use of legal marijuana.\nAlcohol is harmful to the body and mind . Gearing up for the more than 40% of U.S. adults who will take part in Dry January this year, the Today Show recently reported on the health benefits of abstaining from alcohol. These include a rapid decrease in chemical messengers in the blood associated with cancer progression, improvements in insulin resistance, weight and blood pressure, less acid reflux, better sleep, more energy, weight loss and better skin. And aside from the physical, those who give up drinking often have an increased sense of achievement and better mental clarity.\nFor many “sober curious” people around the globe, Dry January and Sober October are solid first steps toward healthier life choices. For others, sobriety is an imperative in their everyday lives. Thanks to VandenBerghe and the sober community she has helped build, those looking to live alcohol free now have a safe space to find connection and love in a substance-free world.\nJane Hanson",

    "text": "The Detroit Lions successfully defended the den in the regular season finale against the Minnesota Vikings. The Lions held off the Vikings, 30-20, in the Week 18 matchup in Ford Field.\nJared Goff threw for 320 yards and two touchdowns in a mistake-free offensive performance. David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs each rushed for a touchdown as well in an uneven game that saw Detroit convert just one of its nine third-down attempts.\nBig plays and special teams ruled the day for Detroit, which improved to 12-5 with the win. Amon-Ra St. Brown caught a 70-yard touchdown pass, and Kalif Raymond ignited a drive with a 42-yard punt return and also chipped in with a 41-yard catch-and-run. Punter Jack Fox had a fantastic game and his coverage units were sharp, too.\nThe defense also made some big plays. Detroit sacked Nick Mullens four times and forced him into two fourth-quarter interceptions under heavy pressure. Aidan Hutchinson bagged two sacks and had another 12-yard tackle-for-loss, while rookie LB Jack Campbell notched a sack amongst his team-high 11 tackles.\nThe victory could be a costly one for Detroit. Pro Bowl tight end Sam LaPorta and Raymond both left the game with knee injuries that could impact their availability in the wild card round next weekend.\nDetroit’s 12th win ties a team record set back in 1991, the last year the Lions won a postseason game. The Vikings finish 7-10 a year after winning the NFC North.\nRelated Lions rookies set NFL offensive production record",
