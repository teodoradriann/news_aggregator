    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her.\nThe civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected.\nAccording to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement.\nMolldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up.\nTreatment called 'inconceivable' Gypsy Rose Blanchard released from Missouri prison early Thursday morning, DOC confirms Cher files for conservatorship of her son, claims Elijah Blue Allman's life is 'at risk' Ex-boyfriend of missing St. Louis woman admits to her murder after Wisconsin arrest: Police 6 dead, 3 injured in Johnson County, Texas, crash; victims include 2 young kids ages 9, 10 California Pizza Huts lay off all delivery drivers ahead of minimum wage increase “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit.\nGoldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment.\n\"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.”\nDoctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.\nThe lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg.\n“Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote.\nWilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages.\nWilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "Steve Bannon Ordered to Report to Prison by July 1 for Contempt of Congress",
    "text": "On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols ordered that Steve Bannon, once an advisor to former President Donald Trump, must surrender himself to prison by July 1 to begin a four-month sentence. The House, then under Democratic control, in October 2021 voted to find Bannon [in contempt of Congress](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/rebeccadowns/2021/10/21/house-votes-to-hold-steve-bannon-in-contempt-n2597844) over refusing to comply with a subpoena from the now former January 6 Select Committee. He [was found guilty](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2022/07/22/bannon-found-guilty-n2610691) in July 2022. As [POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/06/steve-bannon-prison-jan-6-subpoena-trump-00162065) reported: A federal judge has ordered Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of former President Donald Trump, to report to prison by July 1 for his conviction for defying a subpoena from the Jan. 6 committee. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, previously paused Bannon’s four-month sentence while he appealed his conviction. But on Thursday, Nichols ruled that the original reasons for the postponement no longer apply because a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel [ruled strongly and unanimously last month against Bannon’s position]. Bannon intends to continue appealing the case to the full bench of the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court. But unless one of those courts steps in to block Nichols’ decision, Bannon is unlikely to be able to stave off prison in the meantime. If Bannon indeed heads to prison on July 1, it would put him behind bars until just before the November election. In addition to keeping Bannon — who hosts a popular far-right podcast — off the air for a crucial stretch of the election cycle, Nichols’ decision would also effectively pardon-proof Bannon’s jail sentence. (Trump [pardoned Bannon]on the final day of his presidency on federal fraud charges.) The order was also the subject of [POLITICO's PM edition](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook-pm/2024/06/06/bannon-ordered-to-jail-00132333) for Thursday. Although Nicholas' order comes after Bannon lost an appeal, Bannon nevertheless remains confident. As the report also mentioned: Recommended “We’re going to go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to,” Bannon said after Nichols’ decision. “There’s not a prison built or jail built that will shut me up.” Schoen called on Speaker Mike Johnson to formally declare the Jan. 6 committee’s previous subpoenas invalid, contending this would add legal weight to Bannon’s appeal. It’s unclear how receptive the appeals court or the Supreme Court will be to a plea from Bannon to remain free. Earlier this year, Navarro struck out at the appeals court and made a similar pitch to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency matters arising in Washington, D.C. Another Trump adviser, Peter Navarro, is currently serving his own four-month sentence for his contempt charge. He was sentenced [in late January](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2024/01/25/peter-navarro-n2634177). Navarro also sought appeals, though the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his appeal to be released from prison in late April. Per The New York Times' Jonathan Swan and Human Events' Jack Posobiec, Bannon said \"Don’t pray for me. Pray for my enemies. They’re the ones who need it.\" When I asked him about this just now, Bannon told me the same thing -- that people should pray for his enemies not for him -- after being told his prison date. Comes in the context of Trump allies planning revenge prosecutions. He also texted: \"honey badger.\"— Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) [https://t.co/RZkGRS86D2] [June 6, 2024] While Trump advisers are serving time, those found to be in contempt of Congress by the House under President Barack Obama's time in office, such as the [IRS' Lois Lerner](https://townhall.com/columnists/petemcginnis/2024/05/18/happy-anniversary-n2639161) and [then Attorney General Eric Holder](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2012/06/28/congress_votes_holder_in_criminal_contempt-n668023), did not serve time.

The House, now under Republican control, is also looking to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland [in contempt](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2024/03/25/garland-threatened-with-contempt-over-hiding-bidens-secret-tapes-n2636944) over refusing to turn over the audio from Special Counsel Robert Hur's interview with President Joe Biden.

    "title": "Planned Cruise Expansion at Port Canaveral Faces State Opposition",
    "text": "Port Canaveral’s plan to expand and build a new cruise terminal on the north side of the port facilities is being challenged by several Florida state officials.\nThe contention is that the new cruise terminal plan may jeopardize the port’s ability to support the space industry, which is also critically important to the state’s economy.\nOn Friday, August 2, 2024, Florida Department of Commerce Secretary J. Alex Kelly and Department of Transportation Secretary Jared Perdue jointly sent a letter expressing their concerns about the expansion project.\n“Florida’s cruise tourism and commercial space launch sectors are both vitally important,” Kelly and Perdue wrote. “Port Canaveral bears the responsibility of housing and supporting both. … In this case, the port has announced its intention to support one sector to the direct detriment of the other. That decision must, therefore, be reversed.”\nIt is unclear how Kelly and Perdue feel the expansion of the port’s cruise terminal facilities may impact necessary work and infrastructure for the space industry.\nThe only comment is that the cruise terminal plans may impact the expansion of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities that support space efforts. There are no details about how or when such expansion may be planned in the future.\nKelly and Purdue have said it may be necessary to shift planned investments to other Florida facilities, removing such funding from Port Canaveral, if earlier plans are not reinstated.\nThe Department of Commerce will “stringently” review the port’s compliance with an $8.245 million grant, which provided road project funding to support the aerospace industry.\nThe roads that would lead to the new cruise terminal could have been funded in large part by that grant. Port Canaveral may need to more clearly demonstrate how both industries can be supported as necessary.\nSpace Florida, the state’s aerospace agency, has indicated that port space must nearly double by 2023 to support the rapidly growing private space industry.\n“The port has been an integral part of the commercial space industry’s growth and operations in our state, and our commitment to the enterprise remains strong,” said Port Canaveral spokesperson Steve Linden in the statement. “We look forward to working in partnership with Secretary Perdue and Secretary Kelly towards a positive resolution.”\nThe Port Canaveral Authority Board of Commissioners’ next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, August 21.\nSome Space Operations Leaving Port Canaveral It should be noted that the largest private space operator, SpaceX, recently announced that all Dragon spacecraft splashdowns will be shifted to California rather than recovery off the coast of Florida.\nThis is not related to operations or expansion at Port Canaveral, but rather out of concern for potential debris fallout from returning spacecraft.\nSpaceX will now base their Dragon recovery vessel from the Port of Long Beach, where the space company already has operational facilities.\nPlan for New Port Canaveral Cruise Terminal Port Canaveral will continue to provide LNG support for both cruise ships as well as the space industry. Liquefied natural gas is a top fuel for both maritime and aerospace vehicles, and is at the forefront of lower emissions and cleaner environmental initiatives for many cruise lines.\nRead Also: LNG Cruise Ship – Top Pros and Cons\nWith more than 6.9 million passengers visiting Port Canaveral in 2023, the cruise port is the second-busiest passenger terminal in the world, only behind the 7.3 million passengers sailing from PortMiami.\nAt the same time, Port Canaveral supported 72 orbital rocket launches in 2023, with 55 already having launched so far in 2024 and dozens more scheduled for the rest of the year.\nAt times, the cruise industry and space industry have come into conflict, such as when Harmony of the Seas inadvertently caused a rocket launch abort by sailing into a restricted area in January 2022.\nIn other cases, cruise gests have been treated to amazing views of rocket launches when space operations have coincided with ships at the popular Florida homeport.\nCarnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean International, Norwegian Cruise Line, and Disney Cruise Line all homeport from Port Canaveral, with Princess Cruises and Celebrity Cruises homeporting their first ships from the port in the coming months.",

    "text": "This delivery makes Norway the first F-35 partner nation to complete its full fleet of the aircraft, bringing the Royal Norwegian Air Force’s (RNAF) operational F-35 fleet to a total of 52 aircraft.\n“The F-35 is a powerful tool for strategic deterrence, enhancing alliance-based security and discouraging potential aggression,” said RNAF Col Egil Soerstroenen, the F-35 JPO Norway National Deputy. “Receiving all our 52 F-35 aircraft thus represents a huge milestone for Norway. We highly value the solid and successful partnership with government and industry in the F-35 program, and we will continue to evolve Norway’s F-35 capability in strong cooperation with the other F-35 partner nations.”\nThe advanced 5th-generation capabilities of the F-35 platform and now with a full fleet of F-35 aircraft, Norway will be able to enhance its military capabilities to secure its sovereignty and protect its interests in the High North, as well as support NATO in critical missions.\n“The F-35 is a fundamental capability for Norway and the Norwegian Armed Forces,” said Soerstroenen. “The cooperative nature of the F-35 program expands on our partnership with key allies enabling us to support the important mission of maintaining control of our area on NATO’s Northern flank. The F-35’s ability to operate nearly autonomous in a contested environment makes it a truly remarkable weapon platform.”\nThis milestone reflects F-35 program’s strength of international cooperation. As the first partner nation to complete its full fleet, Norway sets a precedent for operational readiness and long-term commitment to collective defense.\nThe F-35 is the multi-mission strike fighter of choice for 20 allied nations and routinely demonstrates its unmatched capabilities at the hands of joint and international warfighters. The continued success of the global F-35 enterprise – through shared investment, innovation, and interoperability – demonstrates how allied nations are uniting to ensure security, stability, and peace in an increasingly complex global environment.",

    "text": "Before returning to the NFL this season as New England's offensive coordinator, Bill O'Brien spent two seasons in the same position at Alabama.\nPart of his tenure there was spent discouraging Jalen Milroe from playing quarterback. That's according to Milroe.\nThe Crimson Tide quarterback said so while speaking with reporters Thursday ahead of of Monday's national semifinal game against Michigan.\nAlabama QB Jalen Milroe says his former OC and current Patriots OC Bill O'Brien told him he should not be a quarterback.\n\"How would you feel if I told you that you sucked?\"\n\"Look where I'm at right now. So who gets the last laugh?\" pic.twitter.com/xurEAr61ge\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 28, 2023 \"All my life, even when I was in college,\" Milroe said of people discouraging him from playing the position. \"Shoot, my own offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien told me I shouldn't play quarterback.\"\nAsked on a followup about his reaction to O'Brien's assessment, here's what Monroe had to say:\n\"How would you feel if I told you you suck?\" Milroe said.\n\"I wouldn't like it,\" the reporter responded.\n\"Ok, then. That's exactly how I felt,\" Milroe continued. \"Biggest thing for me, be true to myself and stay the same. Nothing changed about me. Only thing that changed was that I had opportunity, and I seized it.\"\nMilroe went on to say that O'Brien told him \"there's a bunch of positions\" he could have switched to from quarterback.\n\"But look where I am right now,\" Milroe continued. \"Who gets the last laugh?\"\nHow Jalen Milroe got here Where Milroe is right now is in the College Football Playoff. But it wasn't a straight-forward path to get there.\nMilroe took over at Alabama in the fall after 2021 Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young left for the NFL as the No. 1 pick by the Carolina Panthers. His hold on the position was initially tenuous, and head coach Nick Saban benched him in Week 3 after he threw two interceptions in a Week 2 loss to Texas. His second interception set Texas up at the Alabama five-yard line ahead of a go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter.\nBut Milroe returned as Alabama's starter in Week 4 and has since led the Tide to 10 straight wins that included perhaps the pass of the college football season to beat Auburn ahead of victory over Georgia in the SEC championship. He finished the season completing 65.5% of his passes for 10.4 yards per attempt and 226.5 yards per game with 23 touchdowns and six interceptions. He added 468 yards and 12 touchdowns on the ground as one of college football's most dynamic offensive talents.\nNow he's two wins away form a national championship. And he's not shy about letting his doubters know it.",

    "text": "MasTec ( MTZ Quick Quote MTZ - Free Report ) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.44 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.66 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 12.50%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this utility contractor would post earnings of $1.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.63, delivering a surprise of 32.52%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\nMasTec , which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Heavy Construction industry, posted revenues of $3.4 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.52%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.28 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nMasTec shares have lost about 2.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.3%.\nWhat's Next for MasTec? While MasTec has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nAhead of this earnings release , the estimate revisions trend for MasTec: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.42 on $2.81 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.53 on $13.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Building Products - Heavy Construction is currently in the bottom 44% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\nNorth American Construction ( NOA Quick Quote NOA - Free Report ) , another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2024. The results are expected to be released on March 5.\nThis heavy construction and mining services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.73 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nNorth American Construction's revenues are expected to be $216.42 million, down 9.7% from the year-ago quarter.",
