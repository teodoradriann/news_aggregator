    "title": "Watch Royal Navy frigate HMS Richmond shoot down two drones over Red Sea in dramatic video",
    "text": "This is the dramatic moment a Plymouth-based Royal Navy warship shot down two Houthi attack drones in the Red Sea. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said the incident overnight saw HMS Richmond use its Sea Ceptor missiles to repel the attack. US Central Command reported that 15 drones in total were brought down by group vessels and planes during assaults in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden early on Saturday. A video, released by the Ministry of Defence, shows flashes of light as the missiles are launched into the air at the Houthi attack drones. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said: \"The UK and our allies will continue to take the action necessary to save lives and protect freedom of navigation.\" Confirmation came from the [Ministry of Defence](https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/ministry-of-defence) that the Type 23 frigate jointly with international allies, \"fully repelled\" a Houthi drone attack, fortunately resulting in no injuries or damage, reports [the Express](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1875651/hms-richmond-houthi-drones-Red-Sea). Read More [First official picture released of Princess of Wales since undergoing serious abdominal surgery](https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/kate-middleton-breaks-silence-thanks-9154246) The crew of HMS Richmond were praised by the MoD for their \"exemplary manner\", restating the UK's firm stance that we will act as needed to shield innocent lives and the world economy. Despite having little or no ties to Israel, the Houthis, originating from Yemen, have explained their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea as a reaction to happenings in Gaza. These attacks on vessels travelling through the Red Sea have led to ships rerouting around southern Africa instead of using the Suez Canal between Europe and Asia, increasing costs and posing a potential risk to the global economy. The UK sent HMS Richmond to the Red Sea at the start of January. HMS Diamond and HMS Lancaster were already in the region to the region to protect container ships from assaults by the Houthis. The warship is part of a US-led coalition named Operation Prosperity Guardian, which has been protecting trade ships as they journey through the region and towards the Suez Canal and Europe. At the time, Shapps told MPs that HMS Richmond, a type 23 frigate, would be posted to protect merchant vessels - but stressed the warship is only being deployed to the Gulf to replace a British vessel already on patrol there.

    "text": "Dear Annie: My wife has been on pain medication for almost a decade, and it has turned into a serious addiction. I have to monitor her pills weekly -- though, recently, it’s been daily. She hasn’t worked at all the last decade, ever since she started getting prescribed the painkillers. She lays in bed all day long, sleeping or watching TV. I’ve bought several safes to lock away her pills in so that I can only administer to her what she needs. She’s broken into all of them. I keep the pills with me at all times so that I can make sure she doesn’t take too much. She’s constantly deriding me, blaming me for her not having enough pills. She always pleads, “Just give me tomorrow’s pills tonight.” She has now brought our adult children into this mess by trying to make them pick sides in this ongoing fight, but the kids know she has a problem! I have brought up rehab several times, but she dismisses the idea and claims she doesn’t need it. This past year, I got her an appointment with a therapist. It was just online, through videoconference, and my wife completely blew it off, barely paying attention to the therapist. After 25 years of marriage, I’m about ready to file for divorce. Help! -- Tired of Mother’s Little Helper\nDear Tired: Of course you’re exhausted. You’re living in the tides of addiction, but you don’t have to be subject to the constant push and pull. To find some grounding, I strongly encourage you to check out Nar-Anon ( https://www.nar-anon.org ) or SMART Recovery Family and Friends ( https://www.smartrecovery.org/family ). You cannot neglect your own mental health.\nAs for your wife, she clearly has a severe opioid addiction and needs professional help. You and your adult children may choose to do an intervention in order to make the strongest possible case to get her into an in-patient treatment facility. She will need the supervision of medical professionals if she’s going to detox. Call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration at 800-662-4357 for guidance and to be referred to resources in your area.\nSend your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com .\nMore from MLive Dear Abby: Should we tell our neighbors their dog barks all day?

    "title": "The Bat Trang Pottery Museum’s Architectural Ode to Tradition Is A Canyon In The City Of Vietnam",
    "text": "In the heart of Vietnam’s Bat Trang village, where the artistry of ceramic and pottery has thrived since the 11th century, a striking testament to this enduring legacy has emerged. The Bat Trang Pottery Museum stands not only as a repository of artisanal creations but also as a living embodiment of the village’s rich history and cultural identity.\nDesigner: 1+1>2 Architects\nThe design of the Bat Trang Pottery Museum is more than just a structure; it is a poetic translation of local tales and traditions. The architects embarked on a collaborative journey with pottery experts, local artisans, and villagers, ensuring that the museum’s essence resonates with the very soul of Bat Trang. The tiered, canyon-like architecture pays homage to the potters’ wheels, capturing the spirit of traditional kilns crafted from brick. This deliberate nod to the village’s heritage reflects a commitment to preserving and celebrating the art form that has been passed down through generations.\nWalking through the Bat Trang Pottery Museum is not merely a visual experience; it is a journey through architectural drama. The seven inverted domes create a mesmerizing interplay of light and shadow, forming expansive open-air spaces on the ground level. These spaces become dynamic venues for events, exhibitions, and traditional festivals, fostering a sense of community engagement. Skylights strategically positioned atop the structure usher in daylight, infusing the interiors with ambient coolness and creating a harmonious connection with the surrounding environment, also marked as a sustainable element.\nThe choice of materials in the museum’s construction is a delicate dance between tradition and modernity. Fiber-reinforced concrete cladding, chosen as the primary construction element, speaks to the contemporary while remaining grounded in practicality. Its lightness allows for upward expansion and easy implementation by local builders. Intertwined with this modern material are earthen bricks, mosaic ceramic, and pottery tiles—each telling a story of the Bat Trang craft village. This thoughtful integration not only pays homage to the local craftsmanship but also ensures a seamless blend of the museum with its cultural context.\nBeyond its role as a repository of ceramics and pottery, the Museum serves as a multifunctional haven for the community. The four-story tower accommodates commercial enterprises and homestays, ensuring economic support for the locals. The Bat Trang culinary space on the fourth floor celebrates the village’s gastronomic heritage, complemented by an adjacent auditorium for performing arts. At the summit, a rooftop garden crowns the museum—a collaborative workshop and playground, inviting visitors to engage in the artistic process.\nIn capturing the essence of Bat Trang’s local ceramic and porcelain crafts, the Bat Trang Pottery Museum stands as a beacon of cultural continuity. It is a testament to the delicate balance between architectural innovation and the preservation of tradition, offering visitors an immersive experience that transcends time and tells the story of a village deeply rooted in the art of pottery. Architectural photographer Trieu Chien’s lens captures the sculptural beauty, inviting the world to witness the harmonious marriage of past and present in this unique architectural masterpiece.",

    "text": "CIUDAD DEL VATICANO.- El papa Francisco no asistirá a la audiencia jubilar prevista para este sábado, mientras que en la misa con ocasión del Jubileo de los Diáconos del domingo será sustituido por el responsable del dicasterio para la Evangelización, Rino Fisichella, informó este martes el Vaticano.\nLos partes médicos difundidos explicaron que el cuadro clínico del papa es “complejo”, por lo que se alargará su hospitalización en el Policlínico Gemelli de Roma, donde está ingresado por “una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio”, que obligó a cambiarle la terapia que recibe.\nA pesar de su hospitalización, Francisco volvió anoche a hablar con la parroquia de la Sagrada Familia, la única iglesia católica de Gaza, explicó a los medios italianos su párroco, el sacerdote argentino Gabriel Romanelli.\nPor el momento, sólo ha trascendido que el pontífice ha pasado tranquilo su cuarta noche en el Gemelli y en la jornada de hoy se espera una actualización del informe sobre sus condiciones de salud y sobre si está funcionando el tratamiento.\n“El Santo Padre continúa sin fiebre y con el tratamiento prescrito. Las condiciones clínicas son estables”, se indicó en el último comunicado emitido el lunes por la tarde Santa Sede sobre el estado de salud del pontífice, de 88 años.\nPreviamente, el Vaticano había explicado que las últimas pruebas realizadas mostraban “una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio que ha obligado a modificar aún más la terapia” de Francisco, cuyo tratamiento ya había sido modificado el sábado, después de los primeros exámenes.\nEl Vaticano añadió que el “cuadro clínico complejo requerirá de una hospitalización adecuada”, lo que hace prever que el papa permanecerá varios días en el hospital y que probablemente se pierda algunos de los múltiples actos del Año Santo, como ya ha sucedido con el de este lunes por el Jubileo de los artistas en los estudios de Cinecittà o el Jubileo de los diáconos de este fin de semana.",
