    "text": "Photo: Shutterstock.com China is upset with Germany’s possible decision to send warships through the Taiwan Strait, warning that it would be seen as meddling in China’s internal matters. The warning came after reports that two German naval ships — the frigate Baden-Württemberg and the supply ship Frankfurt am Main — might sail through the 180-kilometer-wide strait next month. If Germany proceeds, it would be the first time since 2002 that German warships have navigated the sensitive waters between Taiwan and mainland China, according to Militarnyi. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and sees the strait as under its control, making any foreign military presence there highly provocative.

He noted that weather conditions could influence the final decision. &quot;We are showing our flag here to demonstrate that we stand by our partners and friends, our commitment to the rules-based order, the peaceful solution of territorial conflicts, and free and secure shipping lanes,&quot; Schulz added. In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning made it clear that Taiwan is part of China and that opposing Taiwan&#039;s independence is key to regional stability. &quot;Beijing has always opposed any actions that undermine China’s territorial sovereignty and security under the pretense of freedom of navigation,&quot; she told reporters. This potential move by Germany follows similar actions by other NATO allies like the U.S. and Canada, whose warships have regularly passed through the Taiwan Strait. The German ships, currently in Tokyo after a long journey across the Atlantic and Pacific, are set to join regional exercises with forces from countries like France, Japan, and the United States.

    "text": "NEW DELHI: China Thursday lodged a protest with India for PM Modi’s acknowledgement of Taiwan Prez Lai Ching-te congratulatory message on X in which Modi had said he’s looking forward to closer ties as “we work towards mutually beneficial economic and technological partnership”. Chinese foreign ministry urged India to resist Taiwan’s “political calculations'” and not do anything to violate the “one-China principle”.Lai had said in his message he wanted to enhance the partnership and expand collaboration on trade, technology and other sectors to contribute to peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. China, which opposes any political contact between Taiwan and countries with which Beijing has diplomatic relations, said it had protested with Indian authorities and that India is familiar with China’s “clear” position on the issue.“The one-China principle is a universally recognised norm in international relations and a prevailing consensus in the international community. India has made serious political commitments on this and is supposed to recognise, be alarmed about and resist the Taiwan authorities’ political calculations. China has protested to India about this,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning.China too has congratulated Modi for the poll outcome but not in the form of a message from President Xi Jinping but through an official statement, and through its newly appointed ambassador Xu Feihong. Like other countries which have diplomatic ties with China, India too follows one-China policy even though there has been no public articulation of it since 2010. China opposes all forms of official interactions between Taiwan authorities and other countries, saying Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory.",

    "text": "A portrayal of the cruxificion of Jesus Christ at a Stations of the Cross procession at the St Thomas’ Cathedral.\nKUCHING (March 29): Over 200 Christians congregated at the St Thomas’ Cathedral to observe Good Friday today.\nThe cathedral was filled to capacity and its narthex overflowed as people gathered to pray and reflect for the 6.30am Commemoration of the Passion of Christ service.\nDuring the service, Reverend Wity Kendu said while Good Friday commemorates the solemn cruxificion of Jesus Christ, it also symbolises the divine transformation of sorrow into redemption through God’s grace.\n“Through Christ’s sacrificial death on the cross, salvation has been made possible — offering redemption and eternal life to all who believe,” he said in his sermon.\nGood Friday commemorates the cruxifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary, and marks the end of the 40-day period of fasting called Lent, which began on Ash Wednesday, where Christians focus on repentance and remembrance.\nIt is an essential component of the Paschal Triduum (Three Days), following Maundy Thursday and preceding Easter Sunday.",
