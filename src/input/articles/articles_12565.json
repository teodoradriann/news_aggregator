    "title": "Union representing 40 per cent of Quebec teachers reaches deal, ends unlimited strike",
    "text": "MONTREAL — A union representing 40 per cent of Quebec teachers has reached a deal in principle with the government and is ending a strike that has shut around 800 schools since Nov. 23.\nFédération autonome de l’enseignement — or FAE — said Thursday night on social media that it spent the day analyzing a tentative deal with the province and will recommend it to its members for approval during general assemblies after the holidays. Details of the agreement have not been released.\nEven though the FAE called the deal \"a new step,\" it emphasized \"it is up to the teachers to respond to (Premier) François Legault's government and to say whether they feel they have been heard.\"\nThe union said it has ended all of its pressure tactics, such as the general strike that has shut 800 schools, including in Montreal, since the end of November. If students affected by the FAE strike return to school as scheduled in January, they will have been away from classes for almost seven consecutive weeks.\nThe FAE, which represents more than 66,000 teachers, took the most hard line out of all the public sector unions negotiating new contracts with the government when it launched an unlimited general strike.\nEarlier today, the government announced it had reached tentative deals on salaries with an alliance of unions, excluding the FAE, representing 420,000 public sector employees, including teachers and health-care workers. They had walked out sporadically since November, for a total of 11 days.\nThe only major labour group without any sort of agreement is a nurses union with about 80,000 members — Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé du Québec — which said today that negotiations are ongoing.\nEarlier Thursday, before the FAE announced the end to its strike, Sylvain Martel, spokesman for parents group Regroupement des comités de parents autonomes du Québec, said he was feeling optimistic but remaining cautious that 800 schools would reopen after the holiday break.\n\"We're glad that we're able to hope for going back to school on Jan. 9, but everything is tentative, lots of people have to agree to what's on the table, so let's hope that it's a real deal and (union) members will get what they want,\" he said in an interview.\nMartel said discussions have been taking place between teachers, parents and administrators about how children will catch up after missing so much school. How that happens will vary, he said, because the effects of the strikes were unequal — some parents taught their children at home, others hired tutors, but many less-fortunate students spent weeks with little to no learning at all.\n\"It's very difficult for students to go back to the same rhythm they were in November, so it's going to take a little while, but we'll get there,\" he said.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press",

He also stated that he has the keys to victory if he were to fight du Plessis.\nDDP responded to this claim during an interview with MainEventTV, calling the fight an easy payday if it were to ever happen.

White is open to Islam moving up to welterweight, though the champion will not do so as he is good friends with the current UFC Welterweight Champion, Belal Muhammad.\nWhen it came to a move regarding the 185 pound division, Dana explained how it was a different level, visibly expressing doubt about Islam's chances. He did not outright deny the idea, though it currently seems very unlikely.\nThere have been talks about a potential superfight between UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Alex Pereira coming back down to middleweight and challenging Dricus, and given the smaller weight difference, White was much more open to that idea.\nRelated\nHow Islam Makhachev Made Company History At UFC 311\nAt UFC 311, Islam Makhachev became the lightweight GOAT with most UFC Lightweight Championship wins and defenses.",

    "text": "2023-12-28 20:24:00\nAccording to the scientific journal IScience, the embryo belongs to a group of feathered theropods called oviraptorosaurs and measures about 27 centimeters long and offers a fascinating insight into the evolutionary links between dinosaurs and modern birds.\nNicknamed “Baby Yingliang,” this dinosaur embryo is one of the most complete ever discovered, providing researchers with a rare opportunity to observe a baby theropod in an unusual posture, similar to that of today’s bird embryos shortly before the hatching. The posture, called “tucking,” involves hunching the body and lowering the head under the wing, a vital behavior for modern birds during hatching.\nBelgian researchers identify the true cause of the extinction of dinosaurs: “One element played a dominant role”\nThe scientists, including independent writer Ben Taub, published their findings in a paper in 2021, pointing out that the posture observed in Baby Yingliang is unprecedented in non-avian dinosaurs but reminiscent of that of contemporary bird embryos. This similarity suggests that folding behavior may have evolved among the theropod ancestors of birds.\nProfessor Steve Brusatte, author of the study, commented on this exceptional discovery by pointing out that the prenatal dinosaur resembles a baby bird rolled up in its egg. This observation reinforces the idea that many characteristics of modern birds evolved from their dinosaur ancestors.\nAlthough this discovery is extraordinary, the researchers note that it is currently the only specimen of its type. Therefore, in-depth studies on other similar fossils will be necessary to confirm the hypotheses formulated from Baby Yingliang. Nonetheless, preliminary findings suggest that some developmental behaviors considered exclusively avian may be more deeply rooted in the theropod lineage. A breakthrough that sheds new light on the fascinating evolution of feathered and toothless species that populated the Earth millions of years ago.\n1703804739\n#Exceptional #discovery #perfectly #preserved #dinosaur #embryo #fossilized #egg",
