    "title": "Montana lawmakers reject proposed ban on mRNA vaccines",
    "text": "The Montana House of Representatives on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly against House Bill 371, a measure that would have banned mRNA vaccines — used primarily in COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots — and made it a misdemeanor to administer the shots. Introduced by Greg Kmetz, R-Miles City, the contentious bill revealed deep-held beliefs by some lawmakers about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine technology that became common during the global coronavirus pandemic. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration has approved mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines and boosters from Moderna and Pfizer. The FDA has also approved a Moderna mRNA vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus. Kmetz said he became politically active during the pandemic, starting when then-Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, ordered non-essential businesses to temporarily close down. He said his wife lost her job in the healthcare field for not getting vaccinated, and a friend’s grandson was hospitalized for one of the rare side effects attributed to the COVID-19 vaccines. https://dailymontanan.com/2025/02/20/montana-lawmakers-reject-ban-mrna-vaccines/",

    "text": "United States men’s national team defender Chris Richards had a heart-in-mouth moment on Wednesday when he was shown the first red card of his career. Thankfully for the 23-year-old the red card was immediately rescinded.\nDuring Crystal Palace’s 2-1 defeat to Chelsea the American defender — who plays a defensive midfielder role for Palace — took one for the team and committed a foul to halt a counterattack.\nIn the 73rd minute Noni Madueke had successfully dribbled past Richards and the USMNT player tried to pull on the Chelsea forward’s shirt to slow him down.\nWhen that was unsuccessful Richards finally brought Madueke down with a tackle near midfield.\nReferee Michael Salisbury immediately reached for a card but didn’t realize what color he was holding.\nAccidental Chris Richards red card vs. Chelsea\nThe ref gave Chris Richards a red by accident and then switched it to a yellow\n[pic.twitter.com/GvvCaBrrVt]— USMNT Only (@usmntonly) [December 27, 2023]\nSalisbury quickly switched the color of Richards’ booking and had a quick laugh. An incident like this can happen every now and again.\nThis same blooper even happened to the great Ronaldinho back in the day.\nCrystal Palace evaded going down a man but couldn’t avoid defeat as a late Madueke penalty sealed the victory for Chelsea.\nWhile current results haven’t looked great for Palace — no EPL wins in their last eight games — Richards has finally been getting playing time with the club.\nHe plays center back for the USMNT but has been converted into a defensive midfielder for Crystal Palace playing the full 90 minutes in the last six EPL games.\nRichards has shown promise in the role and helped set up Palace’s goal vs. Chelsea with a crunching tackle to win back possession.\nCHRIS RICHARDS TACKLE IN SLOMO. GOING TO WATCH THIS ON A LOOP UNTIL NEW YEARS EVE.\n[pic.twitter.com/cRxQ7H6N0E]— Men in Blazers (@MenInBlazers) [December 27, 2023]\nMichael Olise brings Crystal Palace level at Stamford Bridge!\n— NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer)\n[December 27, 2023]\nIf Richards keeps performing like this, and avoiding red cards, then Palace will surely record a league victory soon.",

    "text": "Liberal comedian Stephen Colbert jokingly parodied a famous poem about immigration to criticize President Biden’s new effort to secure the border. The White House on Tuesday announced executive actions to stop illegal immigrants at the southern border claiming asylum if crossings reach a certain level, a move that has angered many progressives, including apparently Colbert. \\\"Yesterday, Biden signed a controversial executive order that allows the president to suspend granting immigrants asylum if the number of asylum seekers averages more than 2,500 a day,\\\" Colbert said Wednesday night on \\\"The Late Show.\\\" \\\"In response, they changed the poem on the Statue of Liberty to read: ‘Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses up to 2,500 people a day, while supplies last, only valid at participating Dairy Queens.’\\\" Colbert also noted that Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., had blasted the move, sharing a clip where Kennedy suggested \\\"President Biden is in trouble politically. He’s polling right up there with fungal infections.\\\" BIDEN CRITICIZED BY HIS OWN PARTY FOR 'USING THE SAME TOOLS' AS TRUMP TO CONTROL THE BORDER \\\"Sir, show some respect,\\\" Colbert replied. \\\"He’s polling right up there with ‘Former President Fungal Infections.’\\\" This is the second night in a row the talk show host mocked Biden's policy shift toward the border. On Tuesday night, Colbert jokingly recommended that Biden pitch border security to Democrats by saying, \\\"the wall is going to be gluten-free, and the barbed wire will be pro-choice. It’s not a border wall. It’s a bord-Her wall,'\\\" The Statue of Liberty poem Colbert was parodying was \\\"The New Colossus,\\\" by 19th century poet and activist Emma Lazarus. The poem, which was famously inscribed onto the Statue of Liberty, is often quoted by immigration advocates. The text has been a source of debate in recent years, such as when CNN reporter Jim Acosta cited it to then-Trump advisor Stephen Miller while criticizing the Trump administration's immigration stance. \\\"The poem that you’re referring to was added later (and) is not actually part of the original Statue of Liberty,\\\" Miller replied in 2017. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Other far-left entities such as the \\\"Jewish Voice for Peace\\\" have publicly quoted Lazarus, who was a Zionist herself, to call for a cease-fire in Gaza. It wrote last year as it \\\"took over\\\" the Statue of Liberty, \\\"The famous words of our Sephardi Jewish ancestor Emma Lazarus etched into this monument compel us to take action to support Palestinians yearning to breathe free.\\\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

    "title": "¿Quién fue el ser humano que viajó al espacio por primera vez? La historia de Yuri Gagarin - UnoTV",
    "text": "El cosmonauta ruso Yuri Gagarin se convirtió, el 12 de abril de 1961, en el primer ser humano en viajar al espacio exterior. Partió en la nave Vostok 1 del cosmódromo de Baikonur, localizda en la actual Kazajistán. De acuerdo con el sitio de la NASA la nave Vostok1 circuló la Tierra a 27 mil 400 kilómetros por hora, el vuelo duró 108 minutos y el punto más alto al que estuvo Gagarin fue de 327 kilómetros de la Tierra. Precisamente por esta razón la Asamblea General de la ONU aprobó el 12 de abril como Día Internacional de los Vuelos Espaciales Tripulados. ¿Quién es Yuri Gagarin, el primer humano en viajar al espacio? Yuri Gagarin nació el 9 de marzo de 1934 en Klushino, una pequeña aldea rural cerca de Moscú. Creció en una familia humilde. Desde pequeño mostró una pasión por los aviones que pasaban cerca de su hogar y por ello, tan pronto pudo se unió a Fuerza Aérea Soviética donde destacó como un gran piloto y paracaidista. Durante la carrera por el espacio entre Estados Unidos y la entonces Unión Soviética, los rusos llevaban la ventaja, pues en 1957 pusieron en órbita un satélite y también por esa época lanzaron al primer ser vivo al espacio, la perrita Laika. Fue en 1961 que lanzaron al primer ser humano al espacio. Curiosamente Yuri Gagarin no era muy alto, pero su estatura, 1.57 metros, le ayudó para ser escogido entre los candidatos debido a que la dimensión de la nave era reducida, de acuerdo con una publicación en X de nibiruastro. ¿Cómo fue el despegue y aterrizaje? Se realizó el 2 de abril de 1961, a las 5 y media de la mañana, hora local, Yuri Gagarin tenía buena presión arterial y temperatura corporal. Lucía un traje espacial color naranja y un casco blanco. A su regreso a la Tierra se convirtió en un símbolo global, su hazaña emocionó a todo el mundo y avivó la curiosidad por el espacio. En su país lo recibieron como héroe, pero también en otros países que visitó y donde lo recibieron espectacularmente, a pesar de que era la época de la Guerra Fría y de los conflictos entre las potencias mundiales. A sus 27 años se dedicó a promover la exploración del espacio y la cooperación entre los países del mundo. Murió en un accidente de aviación, a los 34 años, el 17 de marzo de 1968. Curiosidades de Yuri Gagarin - Lanzó una frase para la historia, antes de subir a la nave espacial, dijo: “¡Poyekhali!”, que en español significa “¡Vámonos!” - Otras de sus frases que se recuerdan son: “La Tierra es azul” y “Pobladores del mundo, salvaguardemos esta belleza, no la destruyamos” - Su viaje duró 108 minutos orbitando la Tierra - Echó a andar una tradición que los cosmonautas siguen, orinar en la rueda trasera del autobús que lo llevó a su nave, según sitio de la BBC - Llevó a su viaje, como amuleto, una foto de su esposa Valentina - En todo el mundo existen monumentos en su honor",

(KGO) -- A veteran and well-known Bay Area restaurateur says he was fired as a volunteer at the Palo Alto VA Hospital after documenting food that was allegedly being unsafely stored and served to patients. And while the VA denies the allegations, the hospital refuses to provide a copy of the inspection report it claims it passed six months before the allegations surfaced.\n\"They don't care! They don't care,\" said Dennis Berkowitz. \"It's below health standards... Our patients there are facing a lot of chronic health conditions and they're more vulnerable (to) food poisoning.\"\nIn the Bay Area food scene, everyone knows Dennis Berkowitz. He's most notably the founder of the legacy Max's franchise. His 70-year culinary career includes opening hundreds of restaurants across the country, including catering for the Department of Defense and the Hotel Corporation of America. Berkowitz was also the top boss of food and beverage for the Fairmont Hotel franchise in the 1960s and Hyatt hotels in the 1970s -- when prices for a gentleman's cut roast beef was only $7.50.\nThe point is: Berkowitz knows his way around a kitchen. And says he holds food quality and safety to the highest standards.\nWhich is why it was unusual for a veteran of the business -- and a veteran of the Army -- to be fired from the Palo Alto VA Hospital as an unpaid kitchen volunteer.\nHere's what he says happened.\nVIDEO: 'Can't sleep!': East Bay neighbors fed up after school alarm won't stop beeping\n\"I took a look at what they were doing, and I was very upset.\" Berkowitz said.\nThe 85-year-old former Army Second Lieutenant says he witnessed food being stored at unsafe temperatures and that staff allegedly falsified those records from November through January last year. He says photos he took show a few examples, like chili being stored at 95 degrees one day, 80 degrees another, and 75 degrees the next - that's 65 degrees below the minimum requirement for storing hot food, according to the Centers for Disease Control. It's supposed to be at least 140 degrees to prevent bacteria.\n\"That's the perfect incubation for E. coli...\" Berkowitz said.\nDr. Michael Stanton is a Cal State East Bay assistant professor of Public Health. He says anywhere between 40 and roughly 140 degrees Fahrenheit is considered \"the danger zone\" -- a breeding ground for bacteria.\n\"There are a number of bacteria that could multiply at that temperature, for example salmonella, listeria, E coli,\" said Dr. Stanton. \"We know that in between those two temperatures, bacteria have a tendency to grow and multiply - sometimes doubling every 20 minutes.\"\n\"(It's) certainly problematic and could lead to serious diseases,\" he said.\nBerkowitz says another example is the nacho cheese. Instead of 140 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, pictures appear to show it being stored at 92 degrees one day - then below 80 degrees another. And what he says is even worse, the burgers were being stored at 121 degrees during one shift - down to 112 the next. According to VA lunch standards, the maximum holding time for burgers is 30 minutes.\n\"This would hold for five hours at this temperature,\" Berkowitz explained. \"If they had leftovers, they would serve them the next day.\"\nMORE: Bay Area viewers question UPS explanation for 'lost items' now for sale online\nAccording to Berkowitz, the other problem?\n\"They were falsifying the records.\"\nThe Army vet also took pictures of the sheet where cooks document the temperatures of food being stored. According to VA guidelines, it's supposed to be done every two hours for hot and cold food.\n\"There was a book in the main kitchen that hadn't been filled out since September -- all the numbers are exactly the same. It's impossible to have something 165 five hours later... 165,\" Berkowitz said.\nHe says he couldn't even find a thermometer in the VA kitchen, so he brought one in from his own. According to the complaint he says he filed with the VA, Berkowitz alleges management did not address the issues upon being notified.\n\"They didn't care,\" he said. \"In fact ... (management) said, 'You're not allowed to take pictures. If it were up to me... you'd never would have got this job.'\"\nAnd in another instance, Berkowitz says the contents of a soup being served were misrepresented.\nVIDEO: UPS tells Bay Area customer his guitar is destroyed and discarded, but he then finds it for sale\n\"What kind of soup is this?' Berkowitz says he asked VA kitchen staff. \"I was told, 'vegetarian'...but there was ham scraps!\"\nBerkowitz said he was told to tell customers, \"It's chicken soup...quote... unquote.\"\nDr. Stanton is familiar with the Palo Alto VA because he did his residency and postdoctoral fellowship at the hospital for four years. While he never witnessed these problems during his time there, he does share this concern: the vulnerable population that could be more susceptible to food poisoning.\n\"You're talking about a lot of people with chronic illnesses; that's a common person visiting our clinics at the VA,\" Dr. Stanton said.\n7 On Your Side reached out to the Palo Alto VA for further comment on these allegations and the images that were shared. We received the following statement, saying the \"VA initiated an investigation in January 2025 to examine Mr. Berkowitz's allegations. After a thorough review, which included interviews with Veterans Canteen Service (VCS) staff and Mr. Berkowitz, the allegations were unsubstantiated.\"\nThe VA contracts with EcoSure, a third-party auditing company, to conduct inspections. The hospital told 7 On Your Side the Palo Alto VA's restaurant facility, known as VCS, passed its latest unannounced inspection in May of 2024 with no findings of unsafe or hazardous conditions. But that inspection was six months before Mr. Berkowitz even started as a volunteer.\n7 On Your Side asked if any follow-up inspections had taken place since then, but the VA didn't answer. The agency was also not willing to provide a copy of the inspection report it claims it passed last May. So we then asked: when did these inspections start, and how often do they occur? The VA didn't answer that either.\nMORE: Despite restraining order, Bay Area man says urgent care billed him for 'free' COVID tests\n7 On Your Side filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to find out.\nWhich brings us back to Berkowitz.\n\"Why do you think you were let go?\" asked 7 On Your Side's Stephanie Sierra.\n\"Because I stirred up too much s***, that's why - because I held them to a quality standard that they didn't like,\" Berkowitz said.\nThe veteran chef himself wrote a list of the customers who would greet him in the food line everyday. He says all he wants for them is a safe experience.\nPlus...\n\"I want my job back!\" he said. \"Let's see if they give it to me...\"\nAfter all, he asks, why fire an unpaid volunteer? 7 On Your Side also asked, but the VA didn't answer.\nTake a look at more stories and videos by 7 On Your Side.\n7OYS's consumer hotline is a free consumer mediation service for those in the San Francisco Bay Area.

    "text": "Venezuela anuncia ejercicio militar y acusa al Reino Unido de “provocación hostil” por buque en las costas de Guyana\nmacamilarincon\n(CNN Español) –– El presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, anunció este jueves que ordenó una acción conjunta defensiva en respuesta a lo que señaló como una “provocación del Reino Unido” luego de que inicialmente la BBC reportara, citando al Ministerio de Defensa británico, que se enviaría un buque patrullero a las costas de Guyana.\n¿Cómo es la riqueza del Esequibo y cómo contribuyó al crecimiento exponencial de Guyana?\n“Por eso he ordenado la activación de una acción conjunta de toda la fuerza armada nacional militar bolivariana sobre el caribe oriental de Venezuela, sobre la fachada atlántica, una acción conjunta de carácter defensiva como respuesta a la provocación y a la amenaza del Reino Unido contra la paz y la soberanía de nuestro país”, afirmó Maduro durante la ceremonia de salutación de fin de año a la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana (FANB).\nLa reacción de Venezuela sigue a un reporte de la BBC del domingo en el que indicaba, citando al Ministerio de Defensa, que el Reino Unido se preparaba para “enviar un buque de guerra a Guyana en una muestra de apoyo diplomático y militar a la antigua colonia británica”.\n¿Qué sigue ahora en la disputa entre Venezuela y Guyana por el Esequibo? Puntos claves del acuerdo y posibles escenarios\nEl HMS Trent, un patrullero de la Marina británica, agregó la BBC, visitará Guyana, “aliado regional y socio de la Commonwealth, a finales de este mes como parte de una serie de compromisos en la región durante su despliegue de tareas de patrulla en el Atlántico”. El Ministerio de Defensa del Reino Unido confirmó a CNN en Londres esta declaración.\nMaduró calificó a la respuesta venezolana como “acción conjunta militar general Domingo Sifonte” en honor al general que Maduro considera héroe de la Guyana Esequiba y a quien, además, se le rendirá homenaje en enero “trayendo sus restos a que descanse definitivamente en el panteón de los héroes de Venezuela”.\nVenezuela y Guyana acuerdan seguir con diálogo sobre disputa del Esequibo\nLa Cancillería de Venezuela publicó un comunicado en rechazo a la llegada del buque británico y advirtió a la Comunidad del Caribe (Caricom) y a la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños (Celac) de que las acciones contradicen el entendimiento acordado el 14 de diciembre entre Venezuela y Guyana.\n“La presencia de la nave militar es extremadamente grave, ya que viene acompañada de declaraciones por parte de voceros políticos y militares de quien fungió como despojador de la Guyana Esequiba, el cual insiste en inmiscuirse en dicha controversia”, dice el comunicado.\nEl encuentro que se llevó a cabo el 14 de diciembre entre los mandatarios de Guyana y Venezuela en San Vicente y las Granadinas cerró con el compromiso de mantener la vía diplomática como el único camino para resolver el conflicto, y se estableció el acuerdo de 11 puntos suscrito por las partes y los mediadores de ambos países.\n“Venezuela insta a las autoridades guyanesas a tomar medidas inmediatas para el retiro del buque HMS Trent, y abstenerse de seguir involucrando a potencias militares en la controversia territorial”, afirma el comunicado.\nCNN está intentando comunicarse con el Ministerio de Defensa del Reino Unido por los informes de que personal militar venezolano participará en ejercicios militares en el golfo de Paria en respuesta al despliegue del HMS Trent en Guyana.\nOsmary Hernández colaboró con este reporte.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "Hong Kong sees hottest New Years Eve since 1884",
    "text": "Hong Kong has recorded its hottest ever New Year’s Eve with the temperature reaching 25.7 degrees Celsius at the city’s Observatory on Sunday. “The maximum temperature recorded at the Observatory was 25.7 degrees, the highest temperature on New Year’s Eve on record since 1884,” the Observatory said in a weather bulletin issued soon after 1 pm on Sunday. Visibility was also low across the city, with Swiss air quality company IQAir recording a level of air pollution that was “unhealthy for sensitive groups” on Sunday. That followed warnings from the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) that some air quality monitoring stations on Saturday were expected to reach “very high” or “serious” levels amid “higher than normal air pollution levels. “Under the influence of a dry continental airstream, the weather in Hong Kong today is mainly fine,” an EPD statement read. “Light wind is unfavourable for pollutant dispersion. The intense sunshine enhances photochemical smog activity leading to rapid formation of ozone and fine particulates in the Pearl River Delta region.” When a very high level of air pollution is recorded, people are advised to reduce their time spent outdoors, while it is recommended that children, the elderly and those with certain health conditions reduce or cease outdoor activities. On December 12, the maximum temperature was 28.7 degrees Celsius, the highest for a December day since 1953. The lowest temperature recorded at the Observatory last month was 8.1 degrees, on December 23. According to the Observatory, the mean [temperature](https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/cis/climat.htm) last month was 19.1 degrees, 0.9 degrees higher than normal, while the mean maximum temperature of 21.6 degrees was 1.2 degrees above normal. Several weather-related records were broken in 2023, including the amount of hourly rainfall, when 158.1 millimetres poured down between 11pm and midnight on September 7. That resulted in [widespread flooding and several landslides](https://hongkongfp.com/2023/09/08/in-pictures-hong-kong-hit-by-widespread-flooding-as-record-breaking-rains-paralyse-city/). The historic downpour also contributed to [September’s record-breaking total rainfall of 1067.1 millimetres](https://hongkongfp.com/2023/10/05/september-eventful-for-extreme-weather-says-hong-kong-observatory-as-t1-storm-warning-issued/), more than three times the monthly normal of 321.4 millimetres. Hong Kong also saw its [hottest summer since records began in 1884](https://hongkongfp.com/2023/09/05/hong-kong-sweats-through-hottest-summer-since-records-began-in-1884/), reaching an average temperature of 29.7 from June to August. Climate experts told HKFP last year that recent extreme weather events were a reminder that “ [climate change is really here](https://hongkongfp.com/2023/09/09/extremes-will-become-normal-hong-kong-needs-better-disaster-awareness-ex-observatory-chief-says-after-record-rainfall/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CClimate%20change%20is%20here.,battered%20by%20record%2Dbreaking%20rainfall.),” adding that typhoons and temperatures would become more intense. Among them, biological scientist Michael Boyle found that Hong Kong’s wealthier districts would warm at a slower rate than its poorest areas, leaving those living in low-income neighbourhoods [at greater risk of exposure to heat considered dangerous to human survival](https://hongkongfp.com/2023/09/13/wealthy-hong-kong-districts-will-warm-at-a-cooler-pace-than-poorer-areas-study-finds/).
