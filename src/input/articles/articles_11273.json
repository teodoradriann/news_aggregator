    "title": "Speeding up the development of .NET / C# microservices with Devprime - DEV Community",
    "text": "The market is undergoing a significant shift driven by digital transformation, compelling companies to update their business processes and strategies for greater efficiency and agility. The adoption of new technologies enables the development of digital platforms that promote new sales channels, online presence, and customer relationships. The microservices approach serves as a significant facilitator by allowing the isolation of business contexts with independent, agile, and secure evolution. This architecture incorporates various principles that drive new experiences, such as the ability to scale according to business demand. When discussing microservices, many distributed system patterns come to mind, such as retry, circuit breaker, resilience, asynchronous communication, and observability. These patterns are essential in discussions about modern cloud-native applications. A crucial factor in the microservices strategy is determining the appropriate size for each one. My recommendation is to embark on a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) journey with business areas to build clear modeling and outputs, such as a Context Map. In a traditional project, decision-making about technical directions in microservices implementation would typically take weeks or even months. Additionally, there would be significant divergences among the teams responsible for implementation. In this article, I'll discuss microservices development using [Devprime](https://devprime.io), which provides a complete software architecture project, accelerators, and intelligent components. This approach enables the development of the first microservice in just 30 minutes, saving about 70% of the investment in backend development. However, in this article, I will demonstrate that advancing through these stages and adopting a modern software development experience follows the leading market strategies. Getting Started Installing the Devprime Platform The first step is to create an account on the [Devprime platform](https://devprime.io), activate it, and obtain a valid license. Next, you'll need to install a version of .NET SDK 7+ compatible with your operating system, be it Linux, macOS, or Windows. Make sure to follow the installation instructions provided by Microsoft for the .NET SDK. Additionally, you'll need to install a containerization tool like Docker or Rancher Desktop, enabling the creation and execution of containers for your microservices. These tools facilitate deployment and management of microservices in isolated environments. Lastly, choose a code editor to develop your microservices. Visual Studio Code is a popular and free option, but you can also use other options like Visual Studio Professional, depending on your preferences and specific needs. Execute the commands below: a) dotnet tool install devprime.cli -g b) dp auth Prepare your local environment with MongoDB, RabbitMQ, SEQ containers following the instructions in the Devprime documentation ( [https://docs.devprime.io](https://docs.devprime.io)). After starting the services, enter RabbitMQ and create the default exchanges and queues named 'orderevents' and 'paymentevents'. Creating the First Microservice in 30 Minutes The command \"dp new\" triggers Devprime's intelligent engine to design a production-ready microservice application in seconds, saving weeks or months of work. dp new ms-order –state mongodb –stream rabbitmq At this point, you have a production-ready microservice as described earlier, with a complete project of software architecture, standardization, maintainability, and special functionalities provided by the Devprime Stack, such as observability (Log, Distributed Trace, Metrics), retry and circuit break, resilience applicable to various services like databases, streaming, and external API consumption. To run it on Windows, Linux, or macOS, use one of the scripts below, remembering to apply \"chmod +x run.sh\" for the shell. .\\run.ps1 or ./run.sh (Linux, macOS) Visualizing the Newly Created Microservice by Devprime CLI The Devprime platform has provisioned a new microservice with a complete software architecture project using a Hexagonal Architecture approach, Event-driven Architecture (EDA) based on leading market practices, prioritizing maintainability, testability, and productivity using Devprime's intelligent components integrated with technology adapters. Open the project in Visual Studio Code using the command: code . Key elements in the image: Web – API exposure Stream – Integration with Streams (RabbitMQ, Kafka, AWS SQS, Azure Services BUS, Google PUB/SUB...) State – Integration with persistence and storage (SqlServer, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Redis, Oracle) Security – Integration with Identity provider (IDP) (Keycloak, Auth0, Azure AD, AWS Cognito, Google Identity Platform...) Services – Adapter for external API integration Observability – Exposure of Logs, Trace, Metrics Healthcheck – Service availability Extensions – Extensibility for external components Adding Business Rules One of the primary challenges in application evolution is standardizing business rules. The Devprime platform addresses this issue through Domain-Driven Design (DDD), standardizing the implementation of source code within the Domain project. This approach includes concepts like Context Map, Bounded Context, Aggregate Roots, Value Objects, Entity, Application Services, Domain Services, Domain Events, and Handlers. To accelerate the implementation, let's use an example code based on a marketplace, containing code for the \"Order\" Aggregate and another for the \"Item\" Entity. Execute the command below and observe the result: dp marketplace order When opening the project in Visual Studio Code, you'll notice the Marketplace business class generated by the previously executed command. This business class represents the \"Order\" entity within the Marketplace context. The actual implementation of business rules is carried out by the developer after the DDD journey in collaboration with the client or team responsible for the business domain. During the DDD journey, the goal is to understand and model the concepts, behaviors, and interactions of the business domain. This modeling is translated into code during implementation. Accelerating Additional Implementations with Devprime Accelerators A powerful feature available in Devprime CLI is the \"dp init\" command, which analyzes business rules and implements various common stages, generating necessary code such as Dependency injection, Application objects, Repository, and Unit tests for the basic software cycle. Execute the command: dp init After completing the microservice implementation, you can run it and observe the log automatically generated by the Devprime platform's observability adapter. This log is extremely useful for understanding your microservice's behavior and performance during execution. In a production environment, the log generated by the microservice will be automatically captured by Kubernetes, a widely used container orchestration platform. Kubernetes can redirect microservice logs to a centralized storage solution like Elasticsearch. ![Image description]( [https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uhc3z63ob24g2hxljpi7](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uhc3z63ob24g2hxljpi7) .png) Making a POST on the Microservice API By accessing the microservice API's default URL ( [https://localhost:5001](https://localhost:5001) or [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)), you'll have access to Swagger, an interactive documentation tool displaying available endpoints in the API. These endpoints are automatically available when using the \"dp init\" command and implemented within the Devprime platform's web adapter. Access the \"POST\" option via Swagger, fill in the data, and confirm. This request will be received by the Web adapter, transported by Application Services, and subsequently processed in the previously implemented business rule in the domain, as shown in the log below. By observing the log generated during the request's processing in the microservice, you'll understand the entire application processing flow, including stages like persistence in the MongoDB database and event emission in RabbitMQ. Exploring Accelerators for Distributed Systems Now, let's take another step in understanding the microservices accelerators present in the Devprime platform's Stack. At this point, let's start the RabbitMQ service in Docker to observe automatic retry and circuit breaker behavior. When attempting a new POST on the API, you can observe another intelligent behavior: if a circuit breaker resulting in a \"Not delivered\" status for the event is detected, the resilience strategy will initiate local fallback to preserve this event. Upon reactivating the RabbitMQ service in Docker and the stream adapter detecting connectivity, the circuit breaker is deactivated, and the preserved event in the resilience strategy is recovered and automatically returned to RabbitMQ. In this demonstration, you could observe an incredible and essential behavior in all modern applications, offered in all projects based on the Devprime platform. This ability to handle failures automatically, such as the circuit breaker and resilience strategy, makes applications more robust and reliable, ensuring a better user experience. The Devprime platform provides these functionalities as an integral part of its projects, facilitating the development of resilient and distributed microservices. Exploring Unit Tests Apart from the entire implementation flow carried out by the 'dp init' command, another very interesting aspect is the unit test cases, serving as a guide for software developers to use as a model in unit test development. Final Thoughts In this article, we demonstrated a basic example of using the Devprime platform's accelerators, aiding in the implementation of the first cloud-native microservice in 30 minutes. These accelerators also contribute to saving approximately 70% of backend development costs, offering a modern, customizable, and evolutionary software architecture project. The [Devprime platform](https://devprime.io) provides an efficient and agile approach to microservices development, supporting patterns like Domain-Driven Design (DDD), resilience, asynchronous communication, and observability.

Each ceremony involves the reading of an account of the life and sacrifice of a veteran, culminating in the sounding of the Last Post.He started playing the trumpet in Year 5 at Garran Primary School. He said he got involved in what he called the marvellous ACT Instrumental Music Program which aims to have a brass or woodwind band in every Canberran public school.From the trumpet, it's a short step to the bugle (which is a simplified version of a trumpet). He found himself playing the Last Post in high school and then his father got wind of the need for buglers at the war memorial.",

    "text": "Harris County Upholds Support for Families: Court Sustains Uplift Harris Program\nBy Francis Page, Jr.\nClick here for updates on this story\nApril 18, 2024 (\nHouston Style Magazine) — In a landmark decision, the 165th District Court stood with Harris County, denying the motion by the Texas Attorney General’s Office to halt the county’s pioneering Uplift Harris initiative. This guaranteed income project is designed to empower Harris County families, offering financial stability in challenging times. Harris County Attorney Christian D. Menefee hailed the ruling as a significant victory for the community. “Republican officials have unjustly targeted Harris County families, but today, justice prevailed. Uplift Harris is more than a program—it’s a beacon of hope. Providing resources to those in poverty isn’t just right, it’s essential for societal progress,” Menefee asserted. Attorney General Ken Paxton’s contention that Uplift Harris contravenes the Texas Constitution’s gift clause was met with strong rebuttal. Harris County maintains that the initiative fulfills a ‘public purpose,’ echoing the Texas courts’ standard and promoting economic growth within the county. Furthermore, Paxton’s challenge to the program’s selection process was countered effectively. Harris County emphasized the rationale behind its lottery system, mirroring state practices and meeting strict income and geographical criteria, thus aligning with the state’s equal protection principles. As the state prepares to appeal, with the likelihood of involving the Texas Supreme Court, the community’s eyes are set on the April 24 fund disbursement, a critical milestone for Uplift Harris.\nAbout the Harris County Attorney’s Office: At the helm of legal affairs for Texas’ most populous county, Christian D. Menefee stands out as the youngest and first African American Harris County Attorney. Commanding an office of 250 dedicated legal professionals, Menefee embodies a progressive and inclusive vision for the administration of justice and civil representation.

    "text": "Recientemente tomó estado público que un joven menor de edad (15 años), oriundo de la localidad de San Andrés, partido de General San Martín, provincia de Buenos Aires, habría manipulado imágenes de sus compañeras de colegio mediante la utilización de sistemas de inteligencia artificial (IA), generando desnudos ( nudes ) con la imagen de las chicas, para comercializarlas a través de la plataforma Discord (programa de comunicación gratuito que permite compartir chats de texto, voz y video mediante la generación de grupos privados). En otras palabras, este joven habría tomado fotos de sus compañeras de clase y las habría “desnudado” utilizando IA, para vender dichas imágenes en el mercado a través de la plataforma mencionada.\nLa tecnología que se habría utilizado es la denominada deepfake que permite editar videos (voz incluída) o imágenes falsas de personas que aparentemente son reales, pero que no lo son, utilizando para ello fotografías que usualmente son tomadas de las redes sociales de las víctimas. Eso incluye la posibilidad de crear supuestas personas actuando de una manera que no es real, simulándose de ese modo acciones que nunca se ejecutaron.\nA este tipo de sistemas de IA se sumó la aplicación “Sora” (de OpenIA) que permite al usuario la creación de un video a partir de instrucciones de texto, esto es, la generación de video-contenido a partir de frases.\nSituaciones como la ocurrida con las alumnas del colegio de la localidad de San Andrés se multiplican, como el caso testigo de Almendralejo (España) cuando, a fines de 2023, distintas adolescentes fueron víctimas de hechos similares al ser tomadas sus imágenes de Instagram para fabricar nudes eróticos falsos distribuidos en distintos sitios webs por un compañero de aula.\nEstrellas de la canción como Taylor Swift y de Hollywood como Scarlett Johansson , como asimismo el propio papa Francisco y Donald Trump han sido víctimas de esta tecnología, e inclusive han promovido acciones legales contra sus desarrolladores ya que, en muchos casos, sus fotografías y/o videos han sido utilizados para desinformar e influenciar a la población en determinado sentido; principalmente en el voto.\nAhora bien, frente al hecho puntual ocurrido en San Andrés y demás antecedentes mencionados, las preguntas que se imponen son las siguientes: ¿qué responsabilidad legal cabe al autor de este tipo de hechos?, ¿qué respuestas legislativas se esperan al respecto?\nEn materia de responsabilidad civil, el derecho personalísimo a la imagen de las chicas involucradas en este despropósito encuentra protección legal en el artículo 31 de la ley 11.723 cuando refiere, como principio general, que “…el retrato fotográfico de una persona no puede ser puesto en el comercio (utilizado) sin el consentimiento expreso….”.\nEl artículo 53 del Código Civil y Comercial de la Nación refuerza la protección de la ley mencionada incluyendo asimismo a la voz de una persona, que tampoco puede ser reproducida, bajo ninguna forma, sin su expresa autorización. Eso adquiere máxima relevancia en los casos de la grabación de conversaciones en ámbitos públicos y privados sin autorización de alguno de los participantes, y los supuestos de deepfake .\nAl respecto, la Corte Suprema de Justicia de la Nación sostuvo en reiteradas oportunidades que el legislador ha prohibido , como regla, la reproducción de la imagen (y la voz) en resguardo del correlativo derecho a ella, restricción que sólo cede si se dan específicas circunstancias que tengan en mira un interés general que aconseje hacerlas prevalecer por sobre aquel derecho.\nEl amparo legal se extiende a cualesquier técnica de reproducción de los rasgos físicos de una persona , con prescindencia del procedimiento empleado y del soporte material en el cual se fija la imagen.\nDicho en criollo, nadie puede utilizar ni comercializar la imagen ni la voz de otra persona sin su consentimiento bajo pena de responder por los daños y perjuicios causados. Si el autor de los hechos es menor de edad puede surgir la responsabilidad de los padres, sobre los que recae la obligación de custodia, guarda y debida vigilancia.\nEn cuanto a las respuestas legislativas para penalizar este tipo de acciones , sin perjuicio de que estos hechos pueden calificarse como “violencia de género digital”, se han presentado en el Congreso Nacional algunos proyectos de ley que persiguen encuadres (tipos) penales especiales.\nPor ejemplo, los proyectos de ley presentados por los diputados Juan Fernando Brugge y Gerardo Milman, con similares fundamentos y diferente extensión normativa, proponen modificar el Código Penal de la Nación y establecer fuertes penas de prisión para todo aquel que incurra en este tipo de acciones, ya sea mediante la producción, financiación y/o comercialización de imágenes elaboradas y/o modificadas por sistemas deepfake .\nLógicamente, siempre es mejor prevenir que curar, por lo cual resulta aconsejable evitar este tipo de hechos con un adecuado marco de concientización en el nivel familiar y educativo, mediante su tratamiento en el aula, incluyendo una modificación en la ley de educación superior que establezca, como materia obligatoria, el tratamiento de estas cuestiones y/o cualquiera vinculada al uso responsable de herramientas informáticas y sistemas de IA.\nLa IA asegura grandes oportunidades y beneficios para la humanidad, aunque también facilita herramientas que permiten confundir la identidad de las cosas y de las personas, como asimismo la desinformación y la mentira.\nDependerá de los Estados establecer normas de juego claras que permitan identificar este tipo de situaciones y sancionarlas razonablemente, sin afectar el desarrollo de una industria que ha prometido actuar con ética proactiva, sujeta a verificación en el tiempo. Hasta que eso suceda, navegaremos aguas peligrosas.\nAbogado y académico en Derecho Digital y Data Privacy.
