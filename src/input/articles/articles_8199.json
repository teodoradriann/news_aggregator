    "text": "ESCANABA, Mich. (RRN) — The Bay College Norse women's basketball team improved to 2-0 in conference play with an impressive 112-59 win over the North Central Michigan College Timberwolves Wednesday night at the Bay College Gym.\nThe Norse raced out to a 30-10 lead after the first quarter and never looked back, as all nine players in uniform scored at least two points. Five of them scored in double figures, led by Menominee's Anna Axtell, who threw down 35 points on 12-of-21 shooting from the floor.\n“Any time you get a double-double, it's great, but 35 is quite a bit of points,” Norse Coach James Fassett said. “I mean, she only had two three's, so Anna was active, right? She had eight offensive rebounds. So Anna was as active all night, all over the floor.”\nBark River-Harris graduate Lauren Zawada had a career-high 25 points, making ten of the 19 shots she took. She also made four-of-five three-point attempts, had six rebounds, and contributed five steals on defense.\n“I felt good,” Zawada said. “I've been trying to shoot in the game, and I never take shots, I never did in high school. I decided that tonight is the night to start shooting them. I've been practicing them, and tonight, it felt good.”\nBay had a bit of a lull in the second quarter after jumping to that 30-10 lead, with the Timberwolves (1-15 overall, 0-2 MCCAA) playing the Norse to a near-draw on the scoreboard.\nBut in the third quarter, the Norse stepped on the gas again, outscoring the visitors from Petoskey, 35-14, to put the game away for good.\nZawada, in particular, did that, making three triples in the third quarter alone. This offensive onslaught happened as the 2-0 Muskegon College Jayhawks prepare to come to Escanaba on Saturday for an early-season showdown.\n“I think we're ready,” Zawada said. “I think we have some things that we still need to work on, but I think we're in a good spot for right now.”\nPoint guard Makenna Hendrickson of Baraga added an impressive stat line of her own in Wednesday's win: ten points, eight assists, seven steals, and six rebounds. Kennedy Sproule knocked down three triples and scored 13 points (plus six rebounds), and fellow Bark River-Harris graduate McKenzie Hoffmeyer contributed 12 points.\nThe Timberwolves had three players get double-doubles. They were led by Maziah Shelton's 16 points and eleven rebounds. Arika Taylor chipped in 14 points and ten boards, and Camile Warden added 13 points and 15 rebounds.\nBay made 12-of-46 three-point attempts; NCMC tried only four triples all night long, and made one.\nThe Bay defense forced the Timberwolves into 48 turnovers. The Norse had just seven.\nBay College improved to 9-7 overall, 2-0 in the MCCAA, with the Muskegon Jayhawks (12-3, 2-0) coming to town for a 1:00 game on Saturday.\n“We'll be ready,” Fassett promised.\nSaturday's game will be broadcast live on FM-106.3, and on-line at www.baynorse.com.\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 BY MY UP NOW – WBUP/WJMN.

Well, those who aren’t necessarily political are doing that now, and they’re explicitly against the pro-Hamas clown show they’re seeing daily.

    "title": "8 bold predictions for the Rams this season",
    "text": "The 2024 season is about to get underway for the Los Angeles Rams , a team with Super Bowl aspirations after making it to the playoffs last year. They'll start the season with the team that ended their 2023 campaign, the Detroit Lions of the NFC North. With Matthew Stafford leading the way once again and a receiving corps as good as any in the NFL, the Rams are well-equipped to make a run this season. The defense, even without Aaron Donald, has a ton of potential thanks to the young talent up front and in the secondary. Before the season kicks off, we have eight bold predictions for the Rams in 2024. 1. Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp will each have 1,100 yards Robert Woods and Brandin Cooks each had at least 1,200 yards in 2018. The following year, Kupp and Woods each had 1,100-plus yards. Since then, however, the Rams haven't had two receivers with even 1,000 yards in the same season. Kupp and Nacua should each clear 1,000 yards receiving fairly easily this year, as long as both of them stay healthy. That's the biggest question with this receiving tandem, though. Health. With Kupp fully healthy and Nacua in excellent shape after a workout-filled offseason, I'm betting both of them will go over 1,100 yards this season. 2. Colby Parkinson will score 6 touchdowns In his career, Parkinson has four total touchdowns. He's only caught 57 passes in four years, seeing a very limited role during his time with the Seahawks. This is the season he breaks out, though. He's the biggest target Stafford has, standing 6-foot-7. He towers over the Rams' other receivers and will easily catch the eye of Stafford when the Rams are in the red zone. Yes, he's competing for targets with Nacua and Kupp, but he should get a bunch of opportunities to score this season as a red zone weapon. 3. Three players will have at least 7 sacks For the past decade, it's been the Aaron Donald show up front for the Rams. Only twice since 2017 have the Rams finished a season with three players who recorded at least seven sacks: 2019 and 2023. It's not easy to get such production out of three different players, but even without Donald, the Rams will find success rushing the passer. It'll just come from several different sources instead of primarily one player. Byron Young and Kobie Turner are both good bets to finish with at least seven sacks after posting eight and nine, respectively, in 2023. The Rams would then need just one of Jared Verse or Braden Fiske to also post seven sacks. My money is on Verse, who will have ample pass-rushing opportunities opposite Young. It wouldn't be a surprise if all four players finish with at least five or six sacks. 4. Blake Corum will lead all rookies in rushing yards It's no guarantee that Kyren Williams will miss time at some point this season, but there's probably a good chance he'll be sidelined for at least a game or two when you consider his injury history and the physical nature of the position. Even if Williams doesn't get hurt, Corum has a decent chance to finish atop the rookie rushing chart. The Rams clearly want to get him involved and if he has the hot hand early in the year, Sean McVay may not be able to resist rising the rookie over Williams. 5. Matthew Stafford will finish top 5 in MVP voting For the first time last season, Stafford received MVP votes. He finished eighth in the race to win the coveted award, but he'll improve on that this year. I'm just not willing to go out on a limb and say he'll win MVP. That would require him to put up gaudy numbers and likely the Rams to finish first in the NFC. Even a top-five finish in polling for MVP would be an accomplishment for Stafford. It would show he's still one of the five best quarterbacks in the NFL, even at the age of 36. 6. Rams will win the NFC West The 49ers are once again heavy favorites to win the division, which is understandable given the talent they have across the roster. But the Rams are built to take them on this season, more so than they have been in recent years. This is a physical offensive line with a ton of power, leading the way for two smaller backs who could get lost behind the wall of blockers in front of them. Defensively, their line is loaded with young talent and players who don't take a play off. The 49ers are still top of the class, but there are questions about their depth. If they suffer injuries at running back, wide receiver or tight end, they could be in serious trouble. 7. Jared Verse is named Defensive Rookie of the Year Turner almost won Defensive Rookie of the Year last season with his nine sacks. Young was even in the running after he had eight sacks. This year, it's Verse's turn to avenge that loss by Turner and win the award himself. He was a first-round pick who was drafted into a perfect situation with the Rams. Sure, he'd be better set up for success if he had Donald drawing double-teams on the interior, but Verse should still approach 10 sacks, if not eclipse that number. 8. At least six Rams will make the Pro Bowl While there are no locks for the Pro Bowl on the Rams' roster this year, there are a lot of strong candidates. At wide receiver, Nacua and Kupp are both very good picks. Steve Avila at guard is another one after he played every snap last season. Stafford should make the Pro Bowl again if he plays the way he did in 2023. Defensively, Turner, Quentin Lake, Tre'Davious White and Kamren Curl could all earn consideration for the Pro Bowl.",

    "text": "I installed Bazzite a few days ago because i kept having GPU related crashes in pop_os that do not happen on a windows partition.\nI run an application (e.g. discord, steam or literally anything else) and my gpu will crash out in a few seconds, maybe 30-60mins if i have something running in firefox. None of the suggested combinations of shift, alt, ctrl and diverse f keys do anything to bring it back.\nSince i now got the same crashes under Bazzite i thought i’d investigate whats the matter there. I didn’t come closer to a solution but towards some interesting information.\nSo everytime i try to install Bazzite it creates a home folder called “bazzite-pop_os” unless i force it from btrfs to ext4 which is odd because i didn’t know bazzite is based on pop and i wasn’t able to find anything on the internet in that regard.\nUsername in my terminal also is “fuutralala@pop-os”. My journalctl logs as pop_os, and now i slowly get to the suspicion that bazzite is either not able to properly uninstall pop or it’s based on pop and doesn’t tell us.\nAnyone got any suggestion what to do? I mean i could always go back to windows which i would like to avoid. To rma my GPU wouldn’t be the solution either because that already happened and as stated before, none of these crashes happen on windows.\nI can’t speak to your GPU crashers but the hostname thing is likely your home router caching the hostname from your last OS and assigning it to your new install.",

    "title": "How To Celebrate The Fall Equinox For Sweet Seasonal Transition",
    "text": "How To Celebrate The Fall Equinox For Sweet Seasonal Transition\nWhen the days grow shorter and the air turns crisp, I find myself eagerly anticipating the arrival of the fall equinox. Living in Brooklyn, New York, a place where the city’s energy never seems to slow, it might seem odd to seek out the subtle seasonal transitions. But, for me, special days like the\nequinox and solstice are major touchstones for grounding my spirit and nourishing my creativity.\nThis means I eagerly anticipate the autumnal shift. Every year, as the fall equinox approaches, I find myself leaning into the quieter, more reflective rhythms that this time of year invites.\n“This day is a celebration — a time to honor the harvest and all that we’ve gathered, both literally and metaphorically.”\nAnd, it’s a good time to exist in the liminal space between light and dark, work and rest. An observance, if you will. Essentially, this day is a celebration — a time to honor the harvest and all that we’ve gathered, both literally and metaphorically.\nAs you keep scrolling, I’ll share not only the science behind this special day but also the rich tapestry of cultural celebrations that have honored the equinox throughout history. If you’re like me and looking for meaningful ways to celebrate, I’ve gathered a few ideas (from experienced experts and practitioners!) that can help you welcome the season with intention and grace. 🍂\nSo, what is the fall equinox? Let’s dive right in.\nOccurring usually on September 22nd or 23rd, the fall equinox marks a pivotal moment in our yearly journey around the sun. (This year, in 2024, we’ll be celebrating on Sunday, September 22nd.) This day is significant because it represents a perfect balance between daylight and darkness. Astronomically speaking, the equinox happens when the sun crosses the celestial equator, moving from north to south. As a result, day and night are almost equal in length everywhere on Earth. This balance is a direct consequence of Earth’s tilted axis, which is inclined at approximately 23.5° relative to its orbit around the sun. (Pretty cool, huh?)\n“This day is significant because it represents a perfect balance between daylight and darkness.”\nFYI: The word equinox itself comes from Latin, meaning “equal night.” On this day, the sun’s rays strike the equator perpendicularly, creating this equal distribution of daylight and darkness. Then, the nights gradually grow longer, and the days shorten, leading us into the cooler season of fall in the northern hemisphere.\nAstrologically, there are also other things in play.\nCristina Farella, astrologer and host of Soror Mystica podcast, says, “The fall equinox is observed when the Sun crosses out of the sign Virgo and enters the 0° of the sign Libra, ending summer and beginning autumn, officially.”\nThe transition from summer to fall isn’t just about a change in temperature (tell me about it, I have an entire mood and vibe shift!). It’s also an adjustment in the energy and rhythms of the natural world. The earth’s gradual cooling and the lengthening of nights encourage a slowdown, mirroring the natural process of harvesting and preparing for the winter months.\nHistorically, how have cultures and societies observed the equinox?\nThe fall equinox has been more than just a day of equal light and darkness. It has been a time steeped in meaning and celebration, reflecting a deep connection to the cycles of nature and the cosmos.\nIn ancient Mesopotamia and India, precise astronomical observations were vital to daily life, with the equinoxes playing a significant role in their calendars. According to\nDallas Athent, author and researcher, “People quite literally lived and died by their calendars. Their calendars meant everything.”\n“In ancient Mesopotamia and India, precise astronomical observations were vital to daily life, with the equinoxes playing a significant role in their calendars.”\nThe Incas, who revered the sun as a deity, made the equinox a time of significant ritual. Machu Picchu, the renowned archaeological site, features a stone called Intihuatana, which is aligned so that it casts no shadow at noon during the equinox. This alignment underscores the Incas’ deep reverence for the sun and their intricate understanding of its celestial path. Athent notes: “The focus on the sun and its physical placement is pretty cool!”\nIn many cultures, the fall coincides with harvest festivals. For example, Sukkot, celebrated by Jews in October, is a time to give thanks for the bounty of the earth and prepare for the coming winter. This reflects a universal theme of preparation and gratitude, resonating across different societies.\n“In many cultures, the fall equinox coincides with harvest festivals.”\nPagan traditions are also celebrated with the Mabon festival, too. As Athent found in her research, “Mabon is celebrated by picking apples and using them in rituals to thank the gods.”\nToday, modern conveniences have changed how we experience the world. Athent points out, “Even if we were to mimic fall equinox celebrations in their original forms, a lot of the meaning may be lost due to technology and convenience.”\nHow to celebrate the fall equinox\nReady to celebrate? There are quite a few big benefits to ringing in the equinox — inside and out — even though our world has changed significantly from the days of yore. “The collective, at this time of the year, benefits from pulling back from the extremes of summer, and gently setting their sights on balancing their inner and outer realms, goals, and desires,” says Farella.\n“With any transition, it gives an opportunity to reset your intentions and find a better routine. Ask yourself, ‘What do I need during this period of time?’”– Wendy Tran, LMFT\nThere’s much more to behold for your inner and outer self, too.\nWendy Tran, licensed marriage and family therapist (LMFT) and mental health recruiter, offers this food for thought: “With any transition, it gives an opportunity to reset your intentions and find a better routine,” she says. “Ask yourself, ‘What do I need during this period of time?’ Is it more rest and prioritizing sleep? Is it nurturing your body with good food to remain healthy during cold and flu season? Is it visiting a sauna or doing some light therapy to make up for the loss of heat and light? There are so many different ways to incorporate more self-care during this time.”\n1. Support your health\nThe fall equinox is a perfect time to check in with your health and well-being. As Tran suggests, “Many of us have heard of seasonal affective disorder which typically impacts folks during the fall and winter seasons. With less time in the sun, our bodies may be impacted by a vitamin D deficiency.” Checking in with your medical and mental health care providers can help you prepare for the shorter days ahead and ensure you have strategies to stay balanced and healthy.\n2. Seek balance\nEmbrace the equinox as an opportunity to find balance in your life. This might mean slowing down or, for some, stepping up your activity. According to Tran, “Balancing often means learning to be mindful day in and day out. Sometimes grounding and maintaining balance is as ‘simple’ as listening to your body.” Pay attention to your needs, whether it’s more hydration, movement, or adjusting to the changing season.\n3. Incorporate mindfulness\nAs the season shifts, sprinkle mindfulness practices into your routine. Tran notes, “Practicing acceptance can be really helpful when you have to enter into a (literal) season of life that is particularly challenging.” Whether it’s through breathwork, meditation, or simply being present, mindfulness can help you navigate the changes of the equinox with a sense of calm and acceptance.\n4. Set intentions\nUse this transitional period to set new intentions and adjust your routines. Tran shares, “With any transitions, it gives an opportunity to reset your intentions and find a better routine.” Reflect on what you need during this time, whether it’s more rest, nourishing food, or different self-care practices, and align your actions with these intentions.\n5. Go outside and engage with nature\nReconnect with nature by spending time outdoors. Tran explains, “Nature oftentimes can keep us present by helping us give in to all of our 5 senses.” Enjoy a walk, breathe in the crisp air, and immerse yourself in the beauty of fall. This can be a grounding way to embrace the season’s changes.\n6. Clean and declutter your home\nConsider a thorough home cleaning as a way to clear out physical and psychic space. Farella advises, “Getting rid of physical objects that hold energy from old cycles can be really healing.” Light candles, journal, and reflect on what balance means to you as you declutter and refresh your living space.\n7. Go within\nTake time to reflect and explore your inner world. Farella suggests, “Use this fall equinox to set your inner sights on exploring the world of your dream space, your imagination, or perhaps your deeply held feelings that are yet unprocessed.” Journaling or meditating on your thoughts can help you embrace the introspective energy of the season.\nIt’s a wonderful time to embrace the shift and find your own rhythm within it. Remember, it doesn’t have to be completely idyllic or picture-perfect. Instead, focus on finding the positives. As Tran says, “Not every season is going to be a ‘great season’ or your ‘favorite season’, but you can find good in every season.”\n“Not every season is going to be a ‘great season’ or your ‘favorite season’, but you can find good in every season.”– Wendy Tran, LMFT\nThe equinox is a moment for reflecting on how far you’ve come in this cycle, and reaping the rewards of this growth. Farella also reminds us, “The equinox is a harvest moment. What can you harvest from this summer’s season of growth? What deserves to be saved for future nourishment, and what, like a weed, should be pulled for now?”\nSeek balance in your own way, without stressing perfection. The process of finding balance is more about experimentation and understanding what elements of your life truly matter. Farella offers some advice: “The scales don’t just help us balance, they help us discern what is balanced, and therefore help us understand the value of different elements of our life.”\nEmbrace the equinox as an opportunity to enjoy the experience and focus on what feels right for you in this season of change.\nStephanie Valente is a Contributing Editor at The Good Trade.

With his long lens camera, Smith makes a bird call, snaps a picture of a flamingo and smiles as he takes in the zoo.\n“I see the smile on your face, like, this is your happy place?” asked WPTV anchor Mike Trim.\n“Well, this is my family,” Walter said.\nPhoto provided by Walter Smith Walter Smith is a Navy veteran who served in the late 1960s. A family that heals wounds unseen. Smith is a Navy veteran who served in the late 1960s. Non-combat related incidents, he’d rather not talk about, led him to a dark place mentally for most of his life.\n“I knew there was something wrong,” he said, “but I never could put my finger on it and acknowledge it.”\nThrough help with the Veterans Affairs, a post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis was a breakthrough, helping Smith get to brighter days.\n“I’ve dealt with it, I accepted it, and I’m just trying to live my life as it is and I don't want to go backwards,” he said.\nWPTV Walter Smith takes in the sights and sounds at Palm Beach Zoo in West Palm Beach, Fla. Now it’s forward, walking his path through his peaceful paradise. Seeing his happiness means a lot to zoo staff as well.\n“He is an ambassador of the zoo, he’s an ambassador of Palm Beach County,” Erin Ward, VP of marketing at Palm Beach Zoo, said. “I mean how lucky are we that we get to have him every week.”\nEvery week is a new step in Smith’s healing.\n“I’ve come a long way, I really have,” he said.",

    "text": "San Lorenzo fue inhibido por la FIFA e inhabilitado para incorporar nuevos jugadores, a raíz de un reclamo por una deuda del mediocampista colombiano Yeison Gordillo por un millón de dólares. El jugador, que llegó al club de Boedo en 2021 a cambio de un millón cuatrocientos mil dólares desde Deportes Tolima de Colombia, terminó libre por la intervención de Futbolistas Argentinos Agremiados en su reclamo por la falta de pago del pase y una deuda salarial. Luego de una intimación inicial se logró negociar con los dirigentes “azulgranas” (la Comisión Directiva ahora reemplazada), pero el club finalmente no pagó. La inhibición le impide a San Lorenzo realizar incorporaciones, con lo que las llegadas del volante uruguayo Santiago Viera y el defensor colombiano Jhohan Romaña quedaron suspendidas hasta la solución del conflicto. Por otra parte, se confirmó la continuidad del ídolo Leandro “Pipi” Romagnoli como entrenador de la Reserva, luego de reunirse con el nuevo responsable del fútbol del club, el exmediocampista Néstor Ortigoza.",
