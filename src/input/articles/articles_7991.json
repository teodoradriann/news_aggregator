    "title": "Une étude de la VUB projette une perte de masse significative des glaciers d’ici 2100",
    "text": "Partout dans le monde, les glaciers perdent de la masse à un rythme alarmant. Dans une nouvelle étude, un chercheur de la Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) a tenté de mesurer l’évolution de quelque 200.000 glaciers d’ici 2100. Ses projections montrent des pertes légèrement plus élevées que celles incluses dans les récents rapports du GIEC, indique la VUB vendredi dans un communiqué.\nL’étude, publiée dans la revue scientifique The Cryosphere, fournit les projections les plus complètes et détaillées de l’évolution des glaciers, à l’exception des calottes glaciaires du Groenland et de l’Antarctique, selon la VUB. Les résultats, basés sur des modèles avancés calibrés à l’aide d’observations spécifiques à chaque glacier, tiennent compte des derniers scénarios climatiques. “Dans le scénario le plus optimiste et faible en émissions, les glaciers devraient perdre environ 25 à 29% de leur masse d’ici 2100” , explique l’auteur, Harry Zekollari, du département d’Eau et Climat de la VUB. “En revanche, dans un scénario à fortes émissions, ce chiffre augmente considérablement, avec une perte projetée de 46 à 54% de la masse glaciaire mondiale” , ajoute le chercheur.\n► Revoir | +d’actu : adapter la ville au réchauffement climatique: on fait comment?\nLes pertes de masse ne sont toutefois pas uniformément réparties. Les Alpes européennes, par exemple, figurent parmi les plus vulnérables, avec une perte de volume estimée à plus de 75%, et beaucoup risquent de disparaître complètement dans des scénarios à fortes émissions, souligne l’étude. À l’inverse, les glaciers des régions polaires, comme le Canada arctique, l’Islande et le Svalbard, devraient conserver une part plus importante de leur masse d’ici la fin du siècle, bien qu’ils subiront eux aussi des pertes considérables. La perte de masse glaciaire a des implications majeures pour la montée du niveau de la mer, la disponibilité en eau, la biodiversité et la stabilité des écosystèmes naturels.\nBelga",

    "title": "Ordering takeaway in extremely cold weather Ninety percent of respondents support the platform to extend delivery time - Teller Report",
    "text": "In December 2023, temperatures plummeted across the country, and heavy snow fell. Poor visibility and icy and slippery roads put people at risk. In this context, \"should you order takeout in extremely cold weather\" has once again aroused heated discussions, some netizens believe that you should try not to order takeout, strong winds, blizzards, low temperatures and other bad weather not only bring a lot of safety hazards to riders, but also easy to deliver overtime \"be badly reviewed\", and \"there is bitterness in the wind and rain\"; There are also riders who posted videos on the Internet saying, \"If you don't order takeout, where can I make money\", another voice was heard. A few days ago, the China Youth Network of China Youth Daily conducted an online questionnaire survey on \"Should I order takeout in extremely cold weather\" (14963,51 respondents participated), 27.48% of the respondents believed that driving in extreme weather was unsafe and the risk factor was high, so they should not order; 73. % of the respondents believe that they should order, and if they don't, they will lose their income. In an interview with a reporter from China Youth Daily and China Youth Network, the delivery riders also expressed their different views. To send it or not to send it? Riders have their own expectations \"There's no way, we're going to work.\" Li Jian, a rider at the Lama Temple site in Beijing, said that living in such a big city has a cost every day, so no matter what the weather, he will do his best to get the job done. He believes that if customers are worried about the safety of riders in extremely cold weather, they only need to pay attention to the distance between the store and themselves when ordering, and try not to order takeaway more than 5 kilometers away, as too far will indeed bring great trouble to riders. Li Jian said that the road is not easy to walk in snowy days, traffic jams occur from time to time, and the distance is too far to easily lead to overtime, and the meals will be cold. Wang Shuoxin, a rider at Meituan's special delivery Jilin Tiancheng site, said that in extremely cold weather, he hopes that consumers will try not to order, and the weather in Jilin is cold, and it is really difficult to send it when it snows heavily. \"In the past two days, the highest daytime temperature in Jilin was minus 13 °C, and the first two days were below minus 20 °C, and I ran 72 orders a day in this environment.\" Since the cooldown, Wang Shuoxin has run for 10 hours a day at most, receiving a subsidy of nearly 130 yuan. \"It's just recommended that everyone don't order unless necessary, no matter how cold it is after receiving the order, I will try my best to serve the customers well, the station distributed knee pads, gloves, and handlebar covers to us to keep out the cold, but what I hope most is that the customer can understand the rider more.\" He said. \"Of course! That's what I do, and I have to support my family, and if everyone doesn't order us, we'll be laid off. Zhang Dong, a rider from Ele.me (crowdsourcing) Preferred Beijing Dongzhimen Business District, said that during extremely bad hours or when no one runs orders at night, some bonus activities will be launched. The platform will have a \"rush order\" activity and weather subsidies, and the team will also distribute cold items such as handles and knee pads. He said: \"I run 10-12 hours a day, and I receive a subsidy of 1 yuan or 2 yuan per order depending on the weather conditions, and in the days from December 2023 to 12, 18, I got almost 24,1000 yuan for the weather subsidy and the reward for rushing orders.\" ” \"Personally, I don't want people to order in extremely bad weather.\" Zhou Sheng, a Meituan delivery rider who is also at the Dongzhimen site in Beijing, said. \"We are the system dispatching orders, and I will send as much as the system sends.\" Zhou Sheng recalled that on the day of the blizzard in Beijing, he delivered more than 11 orders during the afternoon peak (00:13-30:20) alone, which was really difficult. He said that if you have to order takeout in extremely cold weather, I hope everyone can be more considerate and tolerant. 90.3% of respondents supported the platform's move to extend delivery times Compared with the cold storm and snow in winter, the takeaway guys are more concerned about customer evaluations and platform management mechanisms such as \"overtime bad reviews\". Now, various food delivery platforms are also making adjustments. \"We have set up a special team for 'safe production' to do a good job in the safety of rider distribution and cold protection.\" The relevant person in charge of Ele.me said that the platform has now formed an emergency mechanism under special weather, optimized the route and dispatched the order protection, matched more flexible delivery time for riders, shortened the delivery distance, opened the penalty exemption measures and abnormal declaration, elimination, etc. in some stations and knight stations, and also prepared ginger soup, hot tea, medicine boxes, etc., to do a good job in logistics support. \"In the winter of 2023, Meituan Takeaway invested 17.3 billion yuan in special delivery subsidies, and sent gloves, handlebar covers, windshield quilts, warm babies and other cold-proof materials to riders.\" According to the relevant person in charge of Meituan, the platform will help riders reduce delivery pressure by increasing order subsidies, extending delivery time, shortening delivery distances, eliminating overtime and bad reviews and other measures during extreme weather, and also unites all sectors of society to build more than 8, heart-warming stations across the country, so that riders can deliver meals to citizens with peace of mind and safety. In extreme weather, the platform takes measures such as extending the delivery time, eliminating overtime and bad reviews, do consumers support it? According to the survey, 68.34% of the respondents expressed support for the elimination of overtime negative reviews, believing that extreme weather is understandable. 26.76% of the respondents were neutral and believed that they could have a choice; Only 4.9% of respondents chose not to support it, believing that the move would affect dining arrangements. As for the platform's initiative to extend the delivery time, 90.3% of the respondents expressed support, believing that it is not necessary to care about slow and fast, and 9.7% of the respondents did not support it, believing that the delivery cost should not be paid by consumers. Chen Yi, a young man who participated in the questionnaire, said that winter has arrived, and the extremely cold weather may last for a long time, and if everyone stops ordering, the riders will have a meager income that month, and it will be difficult to make ends meet. She understands that it is not easy for delivery staff to deliver food in extremely cold weather, and will remind them in the notes that they are not in a hurry to deliver food, pay attention to safety, and express gratitude when picking up food. \"If the timeout is too long, I think the platform can give us consumers a certain amount of coupon compensation.\" She said. Some time ago, the lowest temperature in Tianjin reached minus 21 °C, and Yan Chenchen, who was born in the 90s, chose not to order takeout, he considered the safety of the riders, and if the delivery time was long, the taste of the food would also change. He said that if there are special circumstances that must order takeout, he will choose to give a tip, and leave a message to remind the rider to put his own safety first. \"Point or not\", the protection of workers' rights and interests is the key The issue of \"whether you should order takeaway in extremely cold weather\" is not right or wrong, \"to order or not\" is the choice of consumers, and the essence of the heated discussion among netizens is the attention and care of new professional practitioners such as takeaway brothers. According to the \"Survey on the Situation of Emerging Youth in Beijing\" jointly organized by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Institute of Sociology of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 71.8% of the emerging youth groups are satisfied with their current jobs. However, 59.7% of young people working in the platform economy, with online car-hailing drivers, couriers, food delivery riders, and flash delivery brothers as typical groups, are significantly lower than the whole, and special attention needs to be paid to the improvement of working conditions and the protection of occupational rights and interests. In terms of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of takeaway brothers, seven departments, including the State Administration for Market Regulation, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the National Development and Reform Commission, have jointly issued the \"Guiding Opinions on Implementing the Responsibilities of Online Catering Platforms and Effectively Safeguarding the Rights and Interests of Takeaway Delivery Workers\", which has put forward all-round requirements in terms of ensuring labor income and safety. In recent years, various localities have also introduced a number of corresponding policies to strengthen the protection of the rights and interests of food delivery riders and express delivery riders. Seven departments, including the Anhui Provincial Market Supervision Bureau, have jointly issued the \"Implementation Opinions on Protecting the Rights and Interests of Takeaway Delivery Workers and Strengthening the Supervision of Takeaway Delivery Behaviors\". In April 2023, the Xiamen Municipal Special Working Group for the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Couriers and Takeaway Riders issued the \"Special Work Plan for the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Couriers and Takeaway Riders\", deploying 4 key tasks from the aspects of rights and interests protection, standardized management, labor relationship identification and responsibility definition. On May 15, 2023, the \"Hangzhou Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Online Catering Takeaway Delivery\" came into effect, stipulating the rights and interests of online delivery workers in terms of contracting, training, insurance, remuneration, etc. Many grassroots units are also carrying out various \"care projects\". Since the beginning of winter, the seven \"little brother gas stations\" located in different directions of Shichahai Street, Xicheng District, Beijing have been warm. Many takeaway boys who are galloping in the cold wind pass by here, and they will stop the car and come in to rest for a while and drink a cup of ginger tea. \"Little Brother Gas Station\" is a volunteer service project for young people with new forms of new employment jointly carried out by the Youth League Working Committee of Shichahai Street and the Party and Mass Service Center. Although the space is small, it is warm and functional, providing a variety of services and conveniences, such as boiling water, Wi-Fi, rest space, meal heating, mobile phone charging, newspaper reading, emergency medicine kits, love umbrellas, etc., and free special tea drinks according to the season. Solve practical problems such as drinking, eating, and resting for little brothers and outdoor workers. Chen Guozhen, director of the Party and Mass Service Center of Shichahai Street, introduced that the street will set the 5th of each month as the \"Little Brother Volunteer Service Day\", on the one hand, to provide various services, on the other hand, to invite them to carry out volunteer services within their ability to guide two-way radiation. \"I hope that they can feel professional identity and professional value in caring and caring. It is also expected that they will be the 'eyes' and 'ears' of the community, and actively participate in the co-construction, co-governance and sharing of the community. Chen Guozhen said. Recently, the State Administration for Market Regulation announced the relevant content of the \"Proposal on Strengthening the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Food Delivery Riders\" put forward by Guan Xu, a deputy to the National People's Congress. The reply pointed out that the legal system for the protection of the rights and interests of workers in new forms of employment will be improved. Cooperate with relevant departments to accelerate the introduction of labor security laws and regulations applicable to workers in new forms of employment, accelerate the implementation of model labor contracts specifically applicable to food delivery riders, and strengthen the effective connection between flexible employment groups and the existing social security system. Xue Jun, a professor at Peking University Law School, said in an interview with a reporter from China Youth Daily and China Youth Network that at present, food delivery riders have become an indispensable part of the public's daily life, and protecting their legitimate rights and interests has become a general consensus in society. However, in order to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of food delivery riders are always protected, it is inseparable from the platform's lawful actions. Major platforms should respond positively. In the short term, it may lead to an increase in platform costs, but in the long run, it will change the entire food delivery business structure, which is not only conducive to the labor security of riders, but also conducive to improving the efficiency of personnel use in the industry.

    "text": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) – Hundreds of supporters from Pakistani Islamist parties on Friday rallied to protest against what they say were blasphemous remarks by the country’s chief justice.\nThe protest call, by various religious and political groups led by hardline Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) whose rallying cry is “death to blasphemers”, said that remarks by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa in a case against a member of the minority Ahmadi community were blasphemous.\nThe court had granted bail to an Ahmadi community member earlier this week, ruling that blasphemy charges against him did not stand. The man, accused of blasphemy for distributing Islamic literature, had been in jail for 13 months.\n“We (will) monitor the sermons and protests outside mosques,” said police official Abrar Hussain in southern city of Karahci, warning the protesters to remain peaceful.\nHundreds of the protesters took to streets in the northwestern city of Peshawar, chanting slogans against the chief justice, said police official Mubarak Khan.\nThe top court on Thursday issued a statement after the Islamist parties and some political groups launched a campaign accusing the chief justice of deviating in his ruling from the constitutional definition of a Muslim, which excludes Ahmadis.\n“This impression is absolutely wrong,” the court statement said, deploring what it called a “vicious campaign” against Isa.\nThe campaign against Isa was also joined by some supporters and aides of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who think a ruling by the chief justice stripping Khan’s party of its symbol on ballots cost them votes in an election on Feb. 8.\nKhan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party’s information secretary Rauf Hasan did not respond to a request for a comment.\nHuman rights groups say Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores, and just accusing someone of such a crime could lead to mob justice.\nJudges hesitate to take up such cases for fear of retribution, which leaves accused languishing in jail for years without cases being heard.\nBlasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan. No one has been executed by the state for it, but numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs.\n(Reporting by Asif Shahzad in Islamabad, Ariba Shahid in Karachi and Mushtaq Ali in Peshawar; Editing by Peter Graff)",

    "title": "Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces | East London and West Essex Guardian Series",
    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal. Islamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country. Jewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”. The Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.” The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that: – Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021). – West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021). – The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021). – West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021). The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”. A spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets. “It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.” Tell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”. Iman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender. “We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.” The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022. PA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change. Methods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. But the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied. Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021). Data obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine. A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”. The board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”. A spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.” The Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups. “The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred. “We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law. “Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "text": "HGTV Magazine Announces Its 2025 Color of the Year\nVersatile violet is having a moment! Here's what designers are saying about this stunning shade — plus 10 ways to bring it home.\nLearn more.\nThe editors of HGTV Magazine saw this pretty purple hue popping up in recent designer projects (like the one on the cover of the January/February issue), new lighting and furniture collections and on trend lists from brands like Sherwin-Williams and Minwax. Spotting it a fourth time, worn by Frances Tiafoe at the US Open, made it official: This color is having a major moment.\nHow to Add Purple to Your Home\nDANE TASHIMA\nFun and fearless decorating is the name of the game in this purple living room. Tour the rest of the house with HGTV Magazine.\n1. Try Purple Paints\nFor this room in Larchmont, New York, homeowner Raeleen Yoon chose Benjamin Moore’s African Violet. “My goal was a space that felt feminine but also edgy and cool,” she says. The soft hue complements the highly patterned Roche Bobois sofa. The overdyed rug is from ABC Home.\n23 Purple Paint Colors Our Editors Love\n23 Photos\nWow! What color purple is that? The editors of HGTV Magazine share their favorite purple paint shades — and how to use them around your house.\n2. Pull Up a Purple Chair\nRevamp your living space with stunning violet seating.\n3. Make a Statement With Lilac Cabinets\n“My client is a mom of three, and she wanted to make a statement in the space where she spends a lot of her time,” says designer Kristie Rosada of this Philadelphia kitchen. White oak trim adds a calming natural element to the custom painted plywood.\nCourtney Apple\n4. Light Up a Lavender Lamp\nIlluminate your space with a table lamp in the year's trendiest shade.\n5. Put Up Purple Wallpaper\nDesigner Lucie Ayres chose a graphic Hygge + West print for the walls of this Los Angeles bedroom and mixed in other light purples with a Safavieh rug and custom Villa Nova fabric canopy. “These shades create an incredibly soothing aesthetic,” she says.\nAmy Bartlam\nFanciful wallpaper and a mix of different lilacs and purples encourage imagination and playfulness in this bedroom designed by Lucie Ayres.\n6.

    "text": "FOLIA\nCarnaval: PBH divulga blocos contemplados com auxilio financeiro\nFesta de rua da capital pode atrair cerca de 6 milhões de visitantes neste ano, diz Prefeitura de Belo Horizonte\ncompartilhe\nSiga no\nA Prefeitura de Belo Horizonte (PBH) anunciou nesta quinta-feira (23/1) a lista final dos blocos de rua da cidade que foram selecionados para receber auxílio financeiro para o Carnaval de 2025. O valor aportado é de R$ 1,76 milhão, investimento que vai beneficiar 101 agremiações. Alguns blocos tradicionais ficaram fora, como Unidos do Samba Queixinho, Bartucada, Alcova Libertina e Truck do Desejo. A lista completa dos blocos classificados pode ser conferida no\nPortal da PBH.\nOs valores do auxílio passaram por reajuste em 2025:\n-\nCategoria A: R$ 22,8 mil\n-\nCategoria B: R$ 13,2 mil\n-\nCategoria C: R$ 8 mil\nSegundo a PBH, para a festa de 2025, um total de 568 blocos de rua se cadastrou para desfilar, com a previsão de 624 cortejos nas nove regionais da capital. Em relação à edição 2024, houve um aumento de cerca de 7% nos desfiles previstos a ser realizados, e 176 novos blocos de rua se inscreveram para se apresentar pela primeira vez.\nO número de cortejos pode oscilar até o período oficial da folia, pois alguns blocos ajustam a quantidade de apresentações. Em média, há desistência de 20% dos desfiles pré-cadastrados, com base em análises dos anos anteriores.\nO objetivo do auxílio financeiro, de acordo com o órgão, é proporcionar aos blocos a oportunidade de melhorar a estrutura de ensaios, aprimorar a qualidade do som e a segurança oferecidas aos foliões que acompanham o cortejo. O valor também poderá ser utilizado na contratação de músicos, dançarinos, carregadores, assessores, produtores, técnicos de som, motoristas, seguranças, equipe de apoio, produção, brigadistas, mini trio e UTI móvel.\nOs contemplados pelo patrocínio também deverão veicular logos da Prefeitura de Belo Horizonte e da Belotur e marca turística nas peças de divulgação do desfile do bloco. A Belotur já está em fase de conclusão das reuniões com todos os blocos de rua para o fechamento de trajetos e outros detalhes operacionais.\nA presidente da liga de blocos de Belo Horizonte, Pollyana Paixão, disse estar feliz com o aumento no valor distribuído, mas que ainda considera pouco perto do porte da folia da cidade: \"O pessoal estava bem ansioso, até porque o fornecedor não pode esperar: quem já tem o dinheiro e não depende do auxilio acaba ficando adiantado nos preparativos. É uma pena sermos o terceiro maior carnaval do país, porém nosso patrocínio ser dez vezes menor que o do Rio de Janeiro por exemplo. Precisamos reverter esse quadro de miséria\".\nPatrocinador oficial\nNa última quinta-feira (16/1), a PBH divulgou a Ambev como patrocinadora oficial da folia. Com um investimento de R$ 5,9 milhões, o grupo cervejeiro se une ao poder público municipal para promover a festa de rua da capital.\nAlém da Brahma, a Ambev também incluirá outras marcas no evento, como Skol Beats, Zé Delivery e Guaraná Antártica. O evento também conta com o apoio da Câmara de Dirigentes Lojistas de Belo Horizonte (CDL-BH), e a Rede Globo ficou com o edital de emissora oficial da folia.\nSiga nosso canal no WhatsApp e receba em primeira mão notícias relevantes para o seu dia\nO evento de 2025 ocorrerá entre 15 de fevereiro e 9 de março. A expectativa, de acordo com a PBH, é que a folia atraia cerca de 6 milhões de visitantes e movimente aproximadamente R$ 1 bilhão na economia local.\n*Estagiária sob supervisão do subeditor Thiago Prata",

    "text": "El papa Francisco no asistirá a la audiencia jubilar prevista para este sábado, mientras que en la misa con ocasión del Jubileo de los Diáconos del domingo será sustituido por el responsable del dicasterio para la Evangelización, Rino Fisichella, informó este martes el Vaticano.\nLos partes médicos difundidos este lunes explicaron que el cuadro clínico del papa es \"complejo\", por lo que se alargará su hospitalización en el Policlínico Gemelli de Roma, donde está ingresado por \"una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio\", que obligó a cambiarle la terapia que recibe.\nA pesar de su hospitalización, Francisco volvió este lunes a hablar con la parroquia de la Sagrada Familia, la única iglesia católica de Gaza, explicó a los medios italianos su párroco, el sacerdote argentino Gabriel Romanelli.\nPor el momento, sólo ha trascendido que el pontífice ha pasado tranquilo su cuarta noche en el Gemelli y en la jornada de este martes se espera una actualización del informe sobre sus condiciones de salud y sobre si está funcionando el tratamiento.\n\"El Santo Padre continúa sin fiebre y con el tratamiento prescrito. Las condiciones clínicas son estables\", se indicó en el último comunicado emitido el lunes por la tarde Santa Sede sobre el estado de salud del pontífice, de 88 años.\nPreviamente, el Vaticano había explicado que las últimas pruebas realizadas mostraban \"una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio que ha obligado a modificar aún más la terapia\" de Francisco, cuyo tratamiento ya había sido modificado el sábado, después de los primeros exámenes.\nEl Vaticano añadió que el \"cuadro clínico complejo requerirá de una hospitalización adecuada\", lo que hace prever que el papa permanecerá varios días en el hospital y que probablemente se pierda algunos de los múltiples actos del Año Santo, como ya ha sucedido con el de este lunes por el Jubileo de los artistas en los estudios de Cinecittà o el Jubileo de los diáconos de este fin de semana.",
