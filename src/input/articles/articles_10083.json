    "text": "This diary is directed at (1) my previous fundamentalist church, Denton Bible Church and (2) fundamentalist churches in general. This diary is not a diatribe against other people of faith, especially not against my fellow democrats. If I offended my fellow Kossacks who are democrats while being people of faith, I am truly sorry as this was not my intent. I will share as I have before here how I ended up with them. I had an extremely painful childhood that led to suicide attempts and self-harm in middle school. That has never left me. I still struggle with self-harm and it's bad. I know that this is what led me to fundamental Christianity. I literally took a Bible and burned it (I lived on my own) and said, 'God if you exist which I doubt, then come down and do something about it ' Six months later, in my dorms, my next door neighbor shared the fundamental gospel and I became a fundamentalist born again Christian and I started going to Denton Bible Church. I am appalled by the fact that they were notified about this in 1999 and did nothing substantive about it until 2019, 20 years later. In addition, it is awful that after having relieved Shiflet of his duties because of what they saw, Tommy still wrote a recommendation letter for him and this led to more victims and then after he was fired from the other church, let him preach again at their church. They sent this guy to Dallas Theological Seminary. Their strawman definition of woke is so stupid, it's not worth the words to show how stupid they are except to point out that Charlie apparently doesn't understand that chattel slavery was real in the United States. Woke as I understand it simply means you are aware of the ugly history of bigotry in this country and the structural discrimination that still exists in addition to people who are bigots. And I fail to see how anybody on Earth 1.0 can deny these obvious truths. They cannot abide people who are not white straight men being equal with white heterosexual men. They just can't. I just learned within an hour of writing these very words that my previous fundamentalist church and its elders failed to protect young girls and despite bright warning lights chose not to act. There are many victims in this story. Denton Bible Church grew from a dozen people meeting in buildings they rented to a reasonably large church to a very large, fundamentalist, Calvinism, dispensational church. In graduate school, I moved from fundamentalist Christian and republican to independent to democrat having left fundamentalism by late 2005 to progressive democrat. When I was a fundamentalist, I can hardly begin to tell you how much I admired the senior pastor. He is extremely smart, was a starting quarterback at a division 1 university who was extremely strong physically and as a marathon runner in excellent condition, charismatic, and a gifted speaker. He earned a graduate degree from Dallas Theological Seminary, but his knowledge of the Bible is as deep as anybody in the country. He avoided charismatic and health, wealth, and prosperity errant theology. He studied and taught word by word, phrase by phrase, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, chapter by chapter through each book of the Bible. He only rarely taught on topics. Even though I disagree with him profoundly, I didn't expect to learn that my old church would have had a child molester on staff. I wrote previously about how I was pretty certain that he had given a speech from the pulpit at a church meeting endorsing Donald Trump and warning against former Secretary Hillary Clinton whom he said would fundamentally change the country. I wrote that although I couldn't find that message, I found a video of him teaching from the pulpit during a church service celebrating the win of Donald Trump and explaining how the Bible taught essentially a completely unregulated free market capitalism among other things. I found something even more explicit. I also found him railing against 'wokeness' and making other statements that simply made me feel sick. I am going to present some news stories exposing the fact that they had a child molester on staff. I will present a lot of one victim's statements. I will also share some stories on him speaking on political issues he doesn't understand. From the Dallas Morning News, a MAJOR newspaper . Denton megachurch pastor retires a year after report alleged church ignored signs of abuse Senior pastor Tommy Nelson led Denton Bible Church for decades. Last year, his church was accused of failing to adequately respond to sexual abuse allegations against their now-convicted former youth pastor. Tommy Nelson, the longtime senior pastor of Denton Bible Church, announced his retirement earlier this month exactly a year after a FOX 4 report alleged his church ignored red flags of abuse by a former youth pastor. Nelson is also a bestselling author of several books on marriage and family. Nelson shared news of his retirement in a letter sent on Oct. 4. “A church like Denton Bible Church needs to always be, to always exist,” he wrote to congregants. “A church that is fundamental, premillennial, Calvinistic, dispensational, discipleship-focused, elder ruled, complementarian, and ‘non-woke’ must continue.” Denton megachurch pastor retires a year after report alleged church ignored signs of abuse Senior pastor Tommy Nelson led Denton Bible Church for decades.

While they had heard troubling stories long before then, the most they had done was confront him directly. One time, they asked him to write an apology letter to a child… which he didn’t do. In 2005, they revoked his ordination, a punishment that means next to nothing outside his church bubble. (He was still able to get a job at another church after that.) They never went to law enforcement. Nelson’s report in May, summarizing the investigation Nelson’s report in May, summarizing the investigation, admitted the church failed to recognize the warning signs, didn’t prioritize care for the victims, and created an environment where abuse could thrive… but all of that was a superficial apology. It suggested everyone was doing everything they could, but they simply didn’t know any better. Now one of the victims has spoken with FOX 4 in order to talk about the church’s failures. “You know what frustrates me the most about this story? Is the number of times we’ve been told, ‘We did not know what to do,’” the victim said. “I don’t have words for that. I don’t think you need a seminary degree to know what to do. You need to do the right thing. Take care of the victims and report to police and [Child Protective Services].“ One of the bombshells? ..

Roy's Report Shiflet worked at Denton Bible Church from 1996 to 2001. He then served as youth pastor at Fellowship Bible Church in Little Rock from 2001 to 2003. According to a five-page summary of the independent investigation’s findings released in May, youth workers told Denton Bible leadership, including Nelson, about Shiflet’s inappropriate behavior as early as 1999. When speaking to The Roys Report (TRR), she called Nelson’s statement in May “incredibly selfish and calloused.” “It is the role of a pastor to shepherd the flock of God,” the woman, who requested we call her “Deborah,” told TRR. “He lacked remorse, lament, and a sense of brokenness. Systemic injustice was perpetuated by egotistical narcissists and cult-like behavior at this church. I know that sounds harsh, but all the victims’ experiences have been nothing short of an abomination.” Nelson claimed that prior to 2005, he had never heard the word “pedophile.” He added that the betrayal by Shiflet—someone Nelson had personally mentored— .After he was fired in Arkansas, Shiflet went back to Denton and was invited to speak at the church.

Here's the real danger according to Tom Nelson: being woke Tommy Nelson, the 70-year-old senior pastor of Denton Bible Church and a conference speaker, says, “I have been in the ministry almost 50 years, and [wokeness] is the most insidious and dangerous and pervasive ideology that I have ever seen in all of my life, in all of my ministry. And it is dangerous to the Christian church as well as to our culture.” Charles Stolfus, the church’s associate pastor, told a local newspaper, “Wokeness describes the belief among some who claim to have been ‘awakened’ to the idea that American society is so irredeemably racist that it must be overthrown through moral, political and economic revolution. It is an insidious belief system that holds that America is a nation founded on white supremacy and oppression and that these forces must be rooted out by any means necessary.” Instead of viewing people “as individuals created in the image and likeness of God,” says Stolfus, wokeness categorizes them by groups, “whether male or female, black or white, gay or straight [and] then as either an oppressor or as an oppressed individual according to their group identities.” The movement also “favors the normalization of the LGBTQ identity,” he says.

Leaders of a Denton, Texas, church were conflicted when the church distributed a flyer endorsing specific city council and mayoral candidates in September. At first, Denton Bible Church posted on social media that the Johnson Amendment was known to be unconstitutional (it’s not) and that no church has been “punished” for violating it (also not true – for instance, a New York church lost its tax-exempt status after AU reported it to the IRS for publishing a newspaper ad opposing Bill Clinton for president in 1992). After the endorsements received media attention, Denton Bible Church backtracked and issued a statement that claimed the flyer didn’t go through the proper review process and shouldn’t have been distributed. But the church went ahead and sponsored a political campaign rally featuring Allen West, chairman of the Texas Republican Party, and Jeremy Dys, a lawyer for the Christian nationalist law firm First Liberty.

Tom Nelson of Denton Bible Church said his friends in Irving are on \"dangerous\" ground. \"If the Bible is not true and authoritative on the roles of men and women, then maybe the Bible will not be finally true on premarital sex, the homosexual issue, adultery or any other moral issue,\" he said. \"I believe this issue is the carrier of a virus by which liberalism will enter the evangelical church.\" Mr. Nelson added that his church's recent sermon series on the Bible and gender roles came in part because of Irving Bible Church's conclusions about women and preaching. .

    "text": "26/06/2025 - 8:23\nNosso ensino superior é etarista, assim como o mercado de trabalho. A consequência é um gigante capital humano inutilizado e subestimado. Quem perde é o desenvolvimento do país.”A engrenagem da sociedade é a juventude.” Quem nunca ouviu isso? O ensino superior público, do acesso à infraestrutura, é focado nos jovens. A consequência é um mercado de trabalho altamente etarista. Poderia aqui focar minha discussão num juízo de valor sobre o preconceito e etarismo, mas prefiro ser mais prático.\nJá pararam para pensar na imensa quantidade de capital humano ocioso que essa resistência e cultura do culto à juventude proporcionam?\nDificuldade começa na inserção\nPrimeiramente, quero trazer a preocupação com aqueles com maior idade que chegam à graduação. Como será a inserção deles no mercado de trabalho? Noto que, no caso dessas pessoas, ficamos muito felizes por terem chegado à graduação e por serem nossos colegas de sala, mas os tratamos com muito preconceito e condescendência.\n“Que bonitinho, voltou a estudar. Seus filhos devem estar muito orgulhosos.” De alguma forma, entendemos que já é uma grande glória estar ali, mas internamente entendemos, e aceitamos, que não vai muito além disso. É como se apenas a aprendizagem bastasse, mas e o mercado de trabalho? E a remuneração? E a mobilidade social? Só serve para os jovens?\nEsse preconceito se estende para o mercado de trabalho. Sejamos honestos ao analisar o seguinte cenário: dois currículos com a exata mesma formação na mesma universidade. A única diferença é a idade. Um tem 48 anos e o outro 24. Quem a empresa irá preferir?\nE se estende para o pós inserção\nInfelizmente, quem já está no mercado de trabalho não está livre. Hoje peguei um carro de aplicativo cujo motorista era um senhor de 71 anos. Dedicou mais de 40 anos à Receita Federal e agora, para não ficar parado, faz corridas por aplicativo. Consigo, e os convido para essa provocação, claramente o ver preterido ou subestimado em uma conversa sobre sua própria área. É como se todo seu conhecimento e experiência, simplesmente já não valessem mais por ele não ser mais jovem.\nO mercado de trabalho, cruelmente, não apenas desvaloriza seus profissionais a partir de uma certa idade, como também subestima e invalida todo o conhecimento tácito e prático que adquiriram por anos. Tudo isso por puro etarismo. Poxa, que desperdício.\nA consequência não é trivial\nAqui estamos diante de uma consequência real: milhões de indivíduos totalmente subestimados e inutilizados. Alguns nem têm a oportunidade de ingressar no mercado de trabalho. Outros são cruelmente tirados do jogo e jogados fora, e, junto com eles, toda a bagagem e conhecimento. Quem perde é o desenvolvimento do nosso país.\nO que pode ser feito? Acredito que a solução passa por políticas dentro de dois eixos: mercado de trabalho e educação.\nQuanto ao mercado de trabalho, há a necessidade de incentivo para as empresas contratem pessoas mais velhas e alguma política que aproveite a riquíssima experiência e bagagem desses indivíduos pós ciclo tradicional de carreira. Talvez alguma utilidade prática para eles junto às universidades com quem está no início da carreira e ainda em formação.\nNo entanto, também precisamos de políticas educacionais. Seria incrível a criação de uma verdadeira formação continuada à nível federal. Formação essa que visa formar o profissional em todas as etapas de sua carreira. Isso, além de os munir de capacitação, também servirá como uma sinalização para o próprio mercado de trabalho.\n__\nVozes da Educação é uma coluna semanal escrita por jovens do Salvaguarda, programa social de voluntários que auxiliam alunos da rede pública do Brasil a entrar na universidade.

    "text": "It may be the day after April Fool’s Day, but this is no joke. The coveted Nvidia RTX 5070 is currently available at the major retailer, Best Buy, at its regularly suggested price of $550.\nThere have already been reports of increased availability of the RTX 50-series graphics cards, such as news of exclusive offerings for Amazon Prime members. However, this sighting is a lucky opportunity for those who don’t want to spend in excess for a graphic component. All of Nvidia’s GPUs have been subject to reseller and scalper inflation, but its cheapest option becoming too costly can be exhausting. Retailers attempted to push the price of the mid-range RTX 5070 Ti up to $1,000 in March before complaints forced them to bring the price down to a more reasonable level.\nMichael Crider at PC World noted several hours ago that the Nvidia RTX 5070 GPU was available at Best Buy in his Pennsylvania area and simulated purchasing the component. Having success, he suggested that a Best Buy Plus membership potentially gave him a leg up in processing the purchase, but also noted there is also a possibility of the retailer cancelling orders after confirmation due to lack of availability.\nKeeping this in mind, I attempted to simulate my own purchase, fumbling through the Best Buy interface as online shopping is not my forte. I received a short web-queue before being prompted to log in to my Best Buy account. Once logged in, I got all the way to the checkout page at approximately 5 p.m. eastern time without entering any payment information– Having been given nine minutes to complete the order.\nI don’t have a Best Buy Plus membership. The hardest part of the experience was recalling whether I had a Best Buy account at all (I do).\nThere are several Best Buy locations in my Brooklyn area, but I just worked with the one that was already connected to my webpage, which indicated that it had RTX 5070 models in stock, and they were selling fast.\nThe Best Buy page indicated that there were shipping and in-person pick-up options, which I believe increases the likelihood of receiving a product. Had I completed my purchase, I would have been able to pick up my GPU within a week, on April 8.\nThis will hopefully be a light at the end of the tunnel for many anxious Nvidia fans who have been waiting to get their hands on affordable GPUs. The component brand did indicate that availability would open up in the coming weeks and months, and it seems it is keeping up on that promise.",

    "text": "Japan has successfully landed its SLIM (Smart Lander for Investigating Moon) spacecraft on the lunar surface, marking the country’s entry into the league of nations that have achieved moon landings. The SLIM lander, launched by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in September, made a soft landing around 15:20 UTC. While the descent and landing were successful, the spacecraft’s solar panel capabilities appeared to be impaired, requiring it to rely on battery power. Despite this setback, JAXA’s president, Hiroshi Yamakawa, confirmed the success of the landing. Japan is now the fifth country to reach the moon’s surface, following Russia, the U.S., China, and India. The SLIM mission, a cargo research endeavour, carries scientific payloads, including an analysis camera and lunar rovers. This achievement reinforces Japan’s position as a significant player in space exploration. The global trend of lunar exploration continues, with more attempts planned by various countries and private companies in the coming months.",

    "text": "It’s an inevitable part of Christmas. With joy in the air and mistletoe hanging, we’ll inevitably see some more engagement rings featured on our social media timelines. It is the most wonderful time of the year after all!\nBut just how much do you spend on an engagement ring?\nTo give you some idea, Bespoke Diamonds Ireland have published the results of their latest survey which shows exactly how much, on average, each county in Ireland spends.\nWhile the average spend in Wexford put us third lowest in Ireland, the Model County also saw one lucky couple spend the third highest amount on a single engagement ring.\nNationally, the average spend on an engagement ring comes in at €4,810. Wexford’s spend comes in less than that at €3,557. Only Kilkenny (€3,465) and Roscommon (€3,458) saw a lower average spend.\nThe average diamond carat weight for a ring in Wexford was 1.1ct.\nThe county with the highest average spend in Ireland was Galway with €6,425, followed by Cork (€6,325) and Limerick (€5,325).\nThere was some retribution for Wexford, however, as the Model County saw the third most expensive ring purchased according to Bespoke Diamonds’ data.\nThe most expensive ring purchased in the country was in Cork for €52,000. This was followed by a €39,500 ring in Dublin and then a €31,000 ring purchased by a couple in Wexford.\nThe happy Wexford spent big on a “bespoke designed three stone engagement ring with a natural oval centre stone and a complimenting stone on each side”.\nThe figures published by Bespoke Diamonds shows that an oval cut diamond remains the most popular and that 51% of rings are chosen by couples, while the man/one partner makes the choice in 49% of cases.\nGet ahead of the day with the morning headlines at 7.30am and Fionnán Sheahan’s exclusive take on the day’s news every afternoon, with our free daily newsletter.",

    "text": "Após mais de três anos de negociação, os países-membros da Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) chegaram a um consenso para o acordo global que prevê uma ação conjunta em futuras crises sanitárias. Chamado de Tratado das Pandemias, o pacto estava sendo discutido desde dezembro de 2021 para formular respostas unificadas após a pandemia da covid-19.\nO consenso do acordo foi obtido nas primeiras horas desta quarta-feira (16), durante reunião do Órgão Negociador Intergovernamental (INB, na sigla em inglês) em Genebra, na Suíça. O Brasil participou de todo processo de negociação como representante da região das Américas.\nO próximo passo agora é levar o texto do tratado, que tem 37 artigos, à Assembleia Mundial de Saúde, órgão máximo de deliberação da OMS, marcada para 19 de maio. O documento ainda precisará ser ratificado pelos países que fazem parte do organismo multilateral. Uma vez isso feito, o documento passará a ter caráter vinculativo, isto é, deverá ser seguido obrigatoriamente por seus signatários.\nO anúncio do consenso vem meses após os Estados Unidos deixarem as negociações pelo tratado. Em janeiro, quando Donald Trump assumiu a Casa Branca, o presidente americano determinou que o país abandonasse as tratativas e saísse da OMS.\nDe acordo com fontes a par das negociações, a saída dos EUA serviu como gatilho para que os membros do INB e países que participavam das discussões se mobilizassem em prol de um consenso, sobretudo para manifestar um apoio ao multilateralismo em geral e à OMS — que são focos de constantes críticas de Trump.\nAté então, as tratativas estavam travadas e chegaram a ser postergadas no ano passado, quando não foi possível chegar a um acordo entre os países sobre como deveria funcionar o Tratado das Pandemias.\n“Ao chegarem a um consenso sobre o Tratado da Pandemia, não apenas estabeleceram um pacto geracional para tornar o mundo mais seguro, como também demonstraram que o multilateralismo está vivo e forte, e que, mesmo em um mundo dividido, as nações ainda podem trabalhar juntas para encontrar um entendimento mútuo e uma resposta conjunta a ameaças compartilhadas”, disse o diretor-geral da OMS, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nAgora, com o consenso, o tratado propõe adoção de medidas concretas para prevenção de pandemias, incluindo a abordagem \"Uma Só Saúde\" — que integra a saúde humana, animal, vegetal e ambiental; o fortalecimento da pesquisas; o estabelecimento de uma rede global de cadeia de suprimentos e logística; a mobilização de uma força de trabalho nacional e global para emergências em saúde; entre outras determinações.\nO acordo também ressalta que não irá intervir na soberania dos países para tratar questões de saúde pública dentro de seus territórios nem dá a OMS poder para impor medidas ou direcionar decisões dos próprios governos centrais.\nEm nota, o Itamaraty e o Ministério da Saúde comemoraram a chegada ao consenso: “O acordo logrou consolidar compromissos claros por parte dos governos e avanços em uma série de temas importantes para o Brasil e para o Sul Global. O Brasil seguirá engajado nos esforços multilaterais voltados à melhoria da governança da saúde global”.\nApesar do acordo ser visto como um avanço, há ainda alguns pontos que ficaram sem definição e que precisarão ser debatidos a posteriori, como o acesso e repartição de benefícios de patógenos, que será colocado como um anexo ao Tratado das Pandemias.\n— Foto: Pixabay",
