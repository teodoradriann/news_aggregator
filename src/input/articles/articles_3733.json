    "title": "Prince Harry pays tribute to his 'eternal bond' with Princess Diana as he accepts Pat Tillman Award - after fallen vet's own mother said he was not deserving - as Meghan Markle watches on after skipping ESPY's red carpet",
    "text": "Prince Harry paid tribute to his &#039;eternal bond&#039; with Princess Diana as he addressed Pat Tillman&#039;s mother while accepting her son&#039;s namesake award at the ESPY&#039;s - weeks after she condemned him being honoured with the prize. The royal extended an olive branch to Tillman&#039;s mother Mary and noted his &#039;respect&#039; for her advocacy of her son&#039;s memory, as he also applauded the sacrifice of wounded veterans and praised the Invictus Games in his victory speech. &#039;Her advocacy for Pat’s legacy is deeply personal and one that I respect,&#039; he said, referring to the fallen soldier&#039;s mom. &#039;The bond between a mother and son is eternal and transcends even the greatest losses.&#039; The royal&#039;s win sparked backlash from some as the award has typically gone to unsung veterans, with Mary Tillman telling the Mail last month she was &#039;shocked&#039; her son&#039;s award would go to &#039;such a controversial and divisive figure.&#039; But Harry brushed off calls for him to turn down the award from from critics including the former head of Britain&#039;s Royal Navy Lord West, who warned the royal risked the wrath of military veterans. Meghan Markle beamed with pride as Prince Harry collected a prestigious military honor at the ESPY Awards at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles Harry gracefully accepted the award at the ceremony despite critics having called for him to turn down the honour - while an online petition was set up condemning the prize The award is named after Pat Tillman, the iconic NFL player who gave up his lucrative career to enlist in the army in the wake of 9/11 before his death in Afghanistan in 2004 &#039;There are recipients that are far more fitting,&#039; Mary said. &#039;These individuals do not have the money, resources, connections or privilege that Prince Harry has.&#039; The Pat Tillman Award is named after the iconic NFL player who gave up his lucrative career to enlist in the army in the wake of 9/11 before his death in Afghanistan in 2004. Meghan Markle beamed with pride as Prince Harry accepted the prestigious military honor, and he used his time on stage to pay tribute to wounded veterans. As he accepted the award from three previous winners, Harry - who served two tours in Afghanistan - noted the struggles that military personnel face after they return from duty. Although some criticised the choice of Prince Harry for the award, ESPN defended it and cited his role in setting up the Invictus Games, which he brought up as he dedicated the award to &#039;the entire service community.&#039; &#039;Tonight, we celebrate healing through sport,&#039; he said, ending the speech by addressing veterans around the world, telling them: &#039;We will leave no one behind.&#039; The Duke and Duchess of Sussex joined other award nominees including Patrick Mahomes and Caitlin Clark at the glitzy ESPN event on Thursday evening, hosted by tennis legend Serena Williams. He began his acceptance speech by expressing his &#039;deepest gratitude to everyone at the Pat Tillman Foundation&#039; including the ex-NFL player&#039;s widow Marie Tillman Shenton who was among those attending. He then addressed Mary Tillman, before adding: &#039;I stand here not as Prince Harry, Pat Tillman Award recipient, but rather a voice on behalf of the Invictus Games Foundation and the thousands of veterans and service personnel from over 20 nations who have made the Invictus Games a reality. &#039;This award belongs to them, not to me.&#039; He also spoke of the inspiration Invictus Games competitors provided amid what he called &#039;an age of polarisation and divison&#039;. The duke said: &#039;While so much progress has been made since those first Invictus Games, the world outside seems to be in an even more precarious state. Harry dedicated his award to &#039;the entire service community&#039;, and pledged to leave &#039;no one behind&#039; as he touched on the sacrifice of wounded veterans The royal couple received a huge cheer as they were announced at the event by host Serena Williams, who jokingly warned them not to &#039;overshadow&#039; her Williams has grown close to Meghan Markle in recent years, and their friendship was on show at the event as the tennis star joked that her thunder would be stolen by the royal couple &#039;breathing too much oxygen&#039; Prince Harry, who raised eyebrows last month as he was announced as the winner, was greeted on stage by three previous victors of the Pat Tillman Award &#039;Conflicts rage around the globe - anger and resentment towards those who are different seem to pervade societies everywhere. &#039;Our community challenges that - our community proves that unity is not just possible but formidable. &#039;The beauty of the Invictus Games lies in how it brings people together no matter one&#039;s nationality, background or personal struggles. &#039;It is a collective, built from courage and mutual respect - where athletes discover time and time again the common denominator of their humanity. Read More Americans call on Prince Harry to &amp;#x27;do the right thing&amp;#x27; and turn down ESPN Pat Tillman award &#039;Having survived the crucible of armed combat and forged through the challenge to rebuild bodies and minds impacted by conflict, they form a family. They exemplify the very best in all of us. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex had received a huge cheer when they were announced by Williams, a close friend of Meghan, as she jokingly warned them not to &#039;overshadow&#039; her on &#039;my night.&#039; Williams also received a warm welcome on stage as she admitted the role was a departure from her usual talents, saying: &#039;You may be asking what I&#039;m doing up here.&#039; &#039;This is my night,&#039; she quipped while pointing out Harry and Meghan. &#039;I don&#039;t want to be overshadowed by you two breathing too much oxygen.&#039; Williams also paid tribute to the banner year women&#039;s sports has had in 2024, and took aim at the hosts ESPN for a lack of airtime given in years past. Hours before the event began, a small aircraft flew a mysterious message aimed at Prince Harry overhead, cryptically urging him to &#039;investigate Mum&#039;s death.&#039; The announcement of Harry as the winner last month drew scrutiny on event organizers, with ESPN personality Pat McAfee implying that Harry was picked as a purposefully divisive winner to increase TV ratings. The award ceremony was hosted by tennis legend Serena Williams, who cut a glamorous figure on the red carpet before she joked with Harry and Meghan Williams received a raucous reception as she admitted to the audience that her hosting role was beyond her usual talents, joking: &#039;You may be asking what I&#039;m doing up here&#039; The Duchess of Sussex was embraced as she and her husband Prince Harry arrived at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles for the 32nd ESPY Awards Mary Tillman also claimed that she was not even consulted over the winner. &#039;These individuals do not have the money, resources, connections or privilege that Prince Harry has. I feel that those types of individuals should be recognized,&#039; she said. ESPN quickly defended its decision to give the award to Harry following Mary&#039;s remarks, saying it chose the Duke of Sussex ‘specifically for the work of The Invictus Games Foundation.’ ‘While we understand not everyone will agree with all honorees selected for any award, The Invictus Games Foundation does incredible work and ESPN believes this is a cause worth celebrating,’ the network said in a statement to the New York Post. Read More Prince Harry &amp;#x27;stunned&amp;#x27; by backlash to his ESPY nomination for &amp;#x27;the Pat Tillman Award for Service&amp;#x27; The award notably joins together the worlds of sport and the military, and aims to recognize those who made &#039;remarkable civic contributions, extraordinary fortitude, and spirit of service&#039; in both realms. Former winners of the award came out in support of Harry after critics scathed his victory, with 2017 and 2018 winners, US Marine Jake Wood and USAF Master Sgt. Israel Del Toro Jr. respectively, defending the Duke. Wood told TMZ that he saw Harry&#039;s military record as deserving, with the royal having served in two tours of Afghanistan, the same number of tours he himself had done. Del Toro Jr. also cited Harry&#039;s work with the Invictus Games, and said he was looking forward to watching the royal win this year&#039;s award. The Pat Tillman Award has previously been given to unsung heroes and ast year it went to members of the Buffalo Bills American football team training staff who revived a dying player on the field. An online petition urging ESPN to reassess its decision last night had more than 75,000 signatures. The petition page set up by New Jersey resident Patti Mickel states: &#039;Prince Harry, while a former military officer, has been involved in controversies that call into question his suitability to receive an honor of this magnitude. &#039;In contrast, Pat Tillman exemplified duty, honour, and sacrifice. He gave up his successful NFL career to serve his country after the 9/11 attacks, and tragically lost his life during his service. Mary Tillman, the fallen NFL star-turned-veteran&#039;s mother, she was &#039;shocked&#039; her son&#039;s award would go to &#039;such a controversial and divisive figure&#039; The Duke of Sussex completed two tours of Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot Previous winners Jake Wood (left, 2018) and Sgt. Israel Del Toro Jr., (right, 2017), defended Prince Harry&#039;s win this year and paid tribute to his military service amid the backlash Hours before the event began, a small aircraft flew a mysterious message aimed at Prince Harry overhead, cryptically urging him to &#039;investigate Mumis death&#039; &#039;Awarding this honour to someone who does not reflect the award&#039;s intent diminishes its value and disrespects Tillman&#039;s memory.&#039; Comparisons have been drawn with how Harry, who completed two tours of Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot, was recognised as a Living Legend of Aviation at a star-studded ceremony in Beverly Hills, California, in January. As he joined astronauts Buzz Aldrin and James Lovell in collecting that honour, former Royal Navy head Admiral Lord West said of Harry: &#039;He is not a living legend.&#039; Read More EXCLUSIVE Prince Harry should turn down &amp;#x27;sporting Oscars&amp;#x27; gong that honours US war hero, military chiefs say Lord West said this week of the prince&#039;s latest honour: &#039;I really think Harry should be well advised to sit back and not accept awards like this. &#039;It doesn&#039;t travel well with people in the military. And when the mother of the man who died doesn&#039;t want him to get this award, he should think about that. &#039;My advice to him is to sit back and not accept any awards at the moment. They are going his way because has such a high profile and people want to take advantage of that.&#039; Former NFL player Pat McAfee has also been among ESPN&#039;s critics, saying: &#039;We should celebrate sports. The worldwide leaders should celebrate sport but doing something like this is obviously trying to p*** people off.&#039; He suggested a new category award just for Harry, adding: &#039;ESPY for Royal Family member who doesn&#039;t want to be called &quot;Royal Family member&quot; who loves sports?&#039; Sources close to the prince have told of him feeling hurt by the backlash against the prize nomination - describing the fallout as &#039;a bitter pill to swallow&#039;. One was quoted by the Telegraph as saying: &#039;Harry&#039;s legacy on Invictus, the things he has achieved, that&#039;s his real passion. &#039;This is the space in which he truly feels at home, it is something he deeply cares about. The reaction certainly took the shine off the award.&#039; And former Pat Tillman Award winner Wood defended Prince Harry on TMZ Live, saying: &#039;He&#039;s a royal prince - there&#039;s 100 different things he could have done with his life after his service in the British Armed Forces but he&#039;s chosen to dedicate a big portion of his post-military life to helping veterans.&#039; Prince Harry used his acceptance speech after receiving his award to praise the Pat Tillman Foundation and said he was there &#039;as a voice on behalf of the Invictus Games Foundation&#039; Tillman won legions of fans over his three years in the NFL playing for the Arizona Cardinals The NFL star&#039;s death in 2004 sparked a media frenzy as it was later revealed that he died by friendly fire, but the military covered it up until a month after his funeral Tillman was already a famous name in the NFL before he gave it up to enlist, having spent three successful years playing for the Arizona Cardinals. In 2002, he gave up a $3.6 million, three-year contract extension in favor of the Army, and although his time in the military captured headlines the same as in his NFL career, he was earning just $1,600-per-month before taxes, according to Bleacher Report. He was first deployed to Iraq in March 2003, and returned to the US to complete Ranger school – a grueling 62-day course – before re-deploying again to Afghanistan in April 2004. Read More Meghan Markle glows in bridal white as she supports Prince Harry at the ESPYs Tillman’s death just weeks into his tour of Afghanistan sparked a media frenzy, as it was initially reported that Tillman died at the hands of ‘enemy combatants’ after his squadron was ambushed. However, it later emerged that Tillman had run up a hill during a gun battle to protect his fellow soldiers, but was actually shot three times in the head by his own men in a tragic case of friendly fire. The military only admitted the truth a month after Tillman&#039;s very public funeral, with many speculating it did so to avoid further bad press as his death came in the same week that torture at the Abu Ghraib prison facility was exposed. The Invictus Games was established in 2014 by Harry as an international multi-sport event for wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women - including those still serving in the armed forces as well as veterans. Earlier this week the prince told of being excited to see the &#039;passion, determination, and resilience&#039; of the Team UK squad taking part in the next Invictus Games, the first to include winter sports. He predicted a &#039;memorable experience&#039; scheduled for next February in Vancouver which will include alpine skiing, snowboarding and skeleton, after a 64-strong Team UK squad was named. Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, quit frontline royal duties in January 2020 and moved across the Atlantic for a new life in Montecito, California, with their children Archie and Lilibet. Meghan and Harry won applause from fellow guests at the ESPY Awards which were being held for the 32nd time The pair were seen catching up with friends after arriving for the event ahead of Prince Harry collecting his Pat Tillman Award and delivering his acceptance speech He released a tell-all memoir Spare in January last year, which became the UK’s fastest-selling non-fiction book after he clinched a £16million ($20million) advance as part of a £32million ($40million) four-book deal with publishers Penguin Random House. The book included allegations that he was pushed into a dog bowl by his elder brother Prince William during an argument over former TV show Suits actress Meghan. It also claimed William teased Harry about his panic attacks, that King Charles put his own interests above his second son and saw Harry talk about taking cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms. Harry and Meghan gave an interview to Oprah Winfrey in March 2021 in which they accused an unnamed member of the royal family of raising concerns about how dark their son Archie’s skin might be.",

    "text": "Eledumare Ministry faults January 1, New Year celebration The Chief priest of Eledumare Ministry, Owolabi Salis, has said celebrating January 1 as New Year has an English origin, noting that it is idolish and whoever worships idols, stones, woods or human beings submits his soul to it. He said all the major religions claimed to be directed by one God who is consistent but they all have different calendars including new years, different rules and so on. “One will allow you eat pork, another will condemned that you should not. One will direct that you should not work on Sunday, Saturday or Friday, another will direct that you work on Sunday, Saturday or Friday. Which one is right we do not know and they all claim to come from one God who is consistent. One uses the solar calendar, others use the lunar calendar and so they all have different New Year.” He argued that if truly, January 1, was named after Janus, a Roman god of beginning and doorways, then celebrating January 1 means celebrating the birth of that Roman god. “Many other religions have said no to January 1 but have different dates. When did the planet Earth start revolving around the Sun? None of them can say with certainty the day, using the solar calendar, when the earth starts revolving around the sun. The chance that it is January 1 is 1:365.25 because we have 365.25 days in a year. What we are all sure of is our new years, that is, our birthdays. “All these inconsistencies are what is called religious programming or religious racing; every religion sells its idea to gain more membership. They scare people with messages like “If you don’t follow me, you will go to hell”. He added that the only Being worthy of worship is one first root, the owner of the soul, Eledumare, which is the Lord God Almighty. “you have to worship him directly because when He deposited the soul in your parents, he never used intermediaries. “ If you worship January 1 and the date is not your birthday, you are an idol worshiper of Janus god (the powerful Roman god of beginnings and doorways) and your spirit is harvested by Janus. You are submitting your soul to Janus, therefore, you do not deserve to live. You may not know before but now you know. “Do not give your spirit to Janus – the Roman god of beginnings and doorways. Forget what your spiritual leaders tell you because they may not be knowledgeable enough. “Many have been so spiritually battered and go to worship places on January 1 as if it is the true date that the sun starts revolving around the sun. “ We all agree that the sun and the moon are good for measuring calendars. We also agree that our lovely planet Earth revolves around the sun in 3651⁄4 days which creates the New Year. But nobody knows the exact date when the earth started revolving around the sun. Nobody knows when our planet Earth was created and started revolving around the sun. It could have been January 3, May 2, July 1 or any other date. What is clear to all of us is that it revolves in 3651⁄4 days. The only book written by Eledumare, the Lord God Almighty, is in the nature discoveries. Nobody knows the New Year for all of us but we all know our new year which is our birthday and that should be our spiritual day. “ We should also be mindful that January 1, New Year in Nigeria is different from January 1 New Year in Australia, USA, Japan and many other countries because of timezone differences. This is why our group’s New Year on this earth, if we all know when the earth is created, cannot necessarily be 12.01 am on January 1. It could have been 11 pm, 2 am or 12 noon in some countries. In some countries, there are 3 or more new years like in the USA. As they celebrate the new year in Nigeria, Australia has already celebrated and the USA is still in the old year! He urged people to pay attention to their birthday, saying it is spiritual. “We should know the time and place. If you were born at 2 am on Jan. 30, in Nigeria, if during your birthday you are in New York, USA, your birthday should be 8 am on Jan. 29 because there is a 6 6-hour difference between New York, USA and Nigeria during January. Even this time zone is challenging because the time zone differences are set by human beings. “With Eledumare, every day is New Year, Every day is a birthday, Every day is Death Day and Every day is important. Your New Year is your birthday,” he said. He added that one of the objectives of Eledumare Ministry is to recover devotees from stories of men and imposed bondages that are inflicting on the people’s spiritual problems. “ Everyone born with a soul is a member of the Ministry but may not be a devotee. The Ministry is founded by Eledumare, the Lord God Almighty Himself. We are just promoters,” he said. Get the latest news delivered straight to your inbox every day of the week.

    "text": "Hope Christian Elementary faces questions over reporting of sexual abuse allegation\nLegal experts question whether the school delayed reporting to police, potentially violating state law.\nLegal experts question whether the school delayed reporting to police, potentially violating state law.\nEditorial Standards\nLegal experts question whether the school delayed reporting to police, potentially violating state law.\nEditorial Standards\nAn Albuquerque teacher is facing formal charges of sexually abusing an 11-year-old girl at Hope Christian Elementary School — and now questions are emerging about whether school officials followed state law when the allegations first came to light.\nKelly McEachren, a fifth-grade teacher, has been charged with criminal sexual penetration and contact of a minor. According to court records, the abuse allegedly occurred during the 2024–25 school year, while the child was in his class.\nTimeline raises legal concerns\nDocuments show the allegations were first reported to school staff on April 6. The next day, April 7, McEachren was placed on administrative leave after school officials confirmed the details with the girl’s parents. That same day, Albuquerque police responded to a child sexual abuse call and interviewed the family.\nIt wasn’t until April 8 that school principal Robyn Taylor spoke with police — raising concerns about whether the school delayed its obligation to report.\nUnder New Mexico’s mandatory reporting law, any person who suspects child abuse is legally required to report it immediately.\n“The statute reads that the report shall be made immediately,” said KOAT legal analyst John Day. “If the school waited or conducted its own internal investigation first, it may have been in violation.”\nDay said the law’s use of the word “immediately” can be subject to interpretation.\n“Does it mean the minute a student reports it to a teacher? Should they call 911 right away? Or can they wait and consult lawyers or verify details?” Day said. “That part of the law is not clearly defined.”\nSchool says it cooperated with authorities\nIn an email sent to Hope Christian families, the school acknowledged being aware of the allegations since they were initially made. It also stated that the school had “been actively working with and cooperating with all authorities and parties involved.”\nHowever, KOAT reached out to Principal Taylor for clarification about exactly when the school notified police. She did not return calls or emails.\nAs of publication, the Albuquerque Police Department has also not responded to inquiries about the timeline of the school’s involvement in the case.\nTeacher denies allegations\nMcEachren has denied all allegations through his attorney. A judge denied a motion to cancel his arrest warrant on Monday.\nThis case is still under investigation, and more information is expected as legal proceedings move forward.",

    "title": "It was described as shocking and flawed. What are the implications of the visit of Jerusalem church leaders Isaac Herzog? - Teller Report",
    "text": "Archimandrite Abdullah July described the meeting of the Patriarchs in Herzog as shocking (Al Jazeera) JERUSALEM – The heads of the churches of Jerusalem did not receive their statement, in which they explained why they participated in a meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog ahead of Christmas. The meeting sparked outrage and criticism. The heads of the churches stressed in their statement that they demanded during their visit to \"stop the waterfall of blood\" in Gaza, and that \"everything that is addressed outside this framework is aimed at distorting the image of Christians and churches, and to serve political agendas that churches refrain from delving into or addressing.\" This meeting, which was held last Thursday, did not go unnoticed, especially as it quoted Isaac Herzog as saying that \"the forces of evil carried out barbaric and sadistic attacks,\" in reference to the seventh of last October, and that he expects \"the leaders of the Christian world to strongly condemn the atrocities of Hamas, and to support our efforts to eradicate evil\" in the Holy Land, as he put it. And began Archimandrite Abdullah July – former head of the monastery of Roman Melkites Catholics in Ramallah – speaking to Al Jazeera Net, describing the meeting of the patriarchs Herzog \"shocking\", because the heads of churches who met with him are the same who took a position that there are no greetings and manifestations of celebration this year, given the situation that the country is going through. Jerusalem church leaders meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Thursday (social media) No wisdom in visiting \"It was not necessary to go there because our people are being slaughtered, and the visit is not appropriate, and if there is an annual protocol as they say, and if we assume in good faith that the visit was aimed at demanding an end to the bloodshed in Gaza, a little wisdom would have been enough not to organize it,\" July said. The Archimandrite touched on the fact that Christians are an integral part of the Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic nations, adding that they are not just minorities and sects, and their presence is emergency, but rather they are a historical and authentic part of the nation, and their position is clear towards the cause with which they are associated. July pointed out that the \"Ramallah Youth Club\" organized on Saturday a stand rejecting the visit, during which the picture of one Christian cleric, Bishop Hilarion Capuch, nicknamed the \"Guardian of Jerusalem\", was raised, a Syrian cleric who dedicated his life defending the Palestinian cause, until Israel arrested him and sentenced him to 12 years in prison. \"The image of this bishop, years after his departure, was raised so that the Palestinians would say that this man is our address, and this is what we want the cleric to be in the country. He must be part of the people, their concerns and their aspirations.\" For his part, began researcher in the history of the Orthodox Church Elif Sabbagh speaking – Al Jazeera Net – describing the visit as \"defective\", and the behavior of what they call themselves spiritual presidency of Christians \"outrageous and sedition that serves only the occupation\", and stressed that it is not permissible to turn a blind eye to this visit nor tolerate those who carried it out \"because they went to shake hands with the killer in order to acquit him. We don't tolerate the killer and we don't shake his hand.\" According to writer and specialist in Israeli affairs, Elif Sabbagh, this visit comes after a two-week postponement, because Israel wanted it in conjunction with the celebration of Christmas, to use it to its advantage in front of European and American public opinion, to say that there is no problem between it and the Christians, and to absolve itself again of the bombing of the Baptist Hospital and other Christian properties in the Gaza Strip. Sabbagh added, \"What happened at the Baptist Hospital should not be forgotten, and what happened from the sniping in the Latin Monastery cannot be overlooked, and the killing of people in the Gaza Strip should not be tolerated, and we consider the Christian clerics who met with Herzog as occupiers like the Israeli occupation, because they are foreigners and do not understand the dignity of the Palestinian people or their rights, and they cooperate with the occupation, because they are part of it.\" Committee to follow up the behavior of clerics Within the framework of the Christian movements against this visit, Sabbagh confirmed that several meetings were held in Palestine and abroad, during which a number of Christian personalities and activists met, and it was agreed to establish a follow-up committee, which includes worldly and non-religious figures, to follow up on the behavior of Christian clerics and their relationship with the Israeli occupation. The follow-up committee will be a general committee that includes all Christian communities in the Middle East and will work within a long-term program that ensures that the behavior of the clergy that only serves Israel is not silenced or overlooked. Sabbagh said, \"We have been fighting for many years to have the heads of our churches in Palestine as Arabs and not foreigners, so why do we see the head of the Russian church, Russia, Germany, Germany and Greek Greek? We are required to have the heads of churches in Palestine to be foreigners. The answer is that our problem lies in the Jordanian and Palestinian political authority, which supports foreigners at the expense of the rights of Arab churchchildren.\" Sabbagh concluded his speech to Al Jazeera Net by saying that \"if these really want to serve Christians and defend them in Palestine, why did not we see them serious movement when the settlers took the habit of spitting almost daily on the cross and clergy, in Jerusalem in particular and Palestine in general?\" \"They were calling for tolerance at the time,\" the same spokesman replied, wondering whether their recent visit to Isaac Herzog was also part of tolerance or ignoring the tragedy experienced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. It is noteworthy that the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) denounced this meeting, and said in a statement, \"We were shocked by the image of Christian leaders in the occupied Palestinian territories, as they meet with the head of the Zionist entity on the occasion of Christmas, especially since none of them spoke about the difficult times our people are going through, due to the crimes of genocide and crimes of ethnic cleansing.\" \"We believe that this Christian leadership, with this behavior, does not represent our people in all its sects,\" the statement said.

A judge sentenced 37-year-old Fausto Antonia Castro Mendoza of Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico, to 17.5 years behind bars. After completing his sentence, Castro Mendoza will be deported to Mexico as he is not a United States citizen. Castro Mendoza previously pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and fentanyl in the case. On March 4, a Seward County Sheriff’s deputy conducted a traffic stop on a white SUV traveling eastbound on I-80 near Highway 6 and made contact with the driver, Castro Mendoza, and front seat passenger, Jesus Villanueva. United States Attorney Susan Lehr said during the traffic stop, the deputy became suspicious of the two men and conducted a probable cause search of the SUV. The deputy discovered 44 pounds of meth and two pounds of fentanyl pills. In their post-arrest interviews, both Castro Mendoza and Villanueva admitted to transporting the meth and fentanyl pills from Denver, Colorado, to Omaha, and that each was being paid to do so, Attorney Lehr said. Villanueva pled guilty to the same narcotics charge and was sentenced to 19.5 years in prison on April 3. Copyright 2023 KOLN. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "2023-12-24 10:38:28 After learning of Röttgen’s words, I understood that in the EU it is no coincidence that such men who do not express the authentic will of the people are elected by their respective national parliaments. There are apparatuses that are capable of changing democratic dynamics in a subtle way, with the sole purpose of sitting at the control panel. They intend to train the masses as they please and create in Europe a spirit of division, of enmity that leads to the same hatred that exists between Palestinians and Israelis. In order for the pain to be so great that it becomes incurable and permanent: Il Chairman of the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee Norbert Röttgen: “Europe must strengthen its support for Ukraine. Kiev’s refusal will strengthen Russia and will only lead to a new war”: ▪️Ukraine’s partners must move from a tepid offensive strategy to a full-scale offensive strategy that will provide the country with all the weapons needed to gain the upper hand and repel Russian troops. Europe in particular must do more. This includes supplying the maximum possible amount of material from the stockpiles of relevant EU weapons systems, increasing military production and expanding each country’s production capabilities. In particular, Europe can and should transfer many more medium- and long-range cruise missiles to Kiev. This would allow Ukraine to attack Russian infrastructure in occupied territories while protecting its soldiers from dangers on the front lines. Europe should also accelerate and extend the supply of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, which will allow the country to establish air superiority. Combined with the provision of additional air defense systems such as Patriot and IRIS-T missiles, such assistance will allow Ukraine to effectively put pressure on Russian forces and gain the upper hand on the battlefield. ▪️Only when Russia is in its own backyard will negotiations become possible. Only then will Western politicians be able to achieve the true criteria of victory: ensuring that Putin’s war of aggression does not repay Russia and that Europe does not become a theater of war. However, if the West were to capitulate in the face of fatigue and civil war, it would simply end up playing into Putin’s hands. A Russian victory would set the stage for further war across the continent, bringing the unrest closer to NATO territory. ▪️Putin cannot be allowed to imagine that his monstrous invasion has any basis; if he wins, wars of aggression in Europe could become more common. From the point of view of Kiev and its partners, this means that, at a minimum, Ukraine’s pre-war borders must be restored. Kiev is fighting not only to regain its territory, but also to defend the fundamental right of states to self-determination, as well as the largely peaceful order that has reigned in Europe since the end of the Second World War. This is a goal that liberal democracies in the West and around the world should unanimously support, especially in Europe, where war has returned to the continent. ▪️Reducing support for Ukraine will likely reduce, rather than increase, Russia’s appetite for negotiations. Putin will have the upper hand and will have no reason to engage in dialogue if he believes a military victory is possible. Russia’s vast military-industrial complex is capable of withstanding many years of military action; Europe, on the other hand, is not increasing military production and will soon run out of vital military systems that Ukraine so badly needs. Knowing this, Putin can only wait. Time is on his side. ▪️The lack of a backbone in the US and EU could have major consequences for the rest of the world. Should the West back down in the face of Putin’s onslaught or demonstrate that it is unable to significantly increase support for Ukraine, such a failure would signal weakness to China and other revisionist powers such as Iran. It would also send a disastrous message to other key allies such as the Philippines and Taiwan, which rely on U.S. military support for their security and territorial integrity. Shifting to a targeted offensive strategy and helping Ukraine successfully fight Russia would help contain China in the Indo-Pacific and reassure US and EU allies. Every Republican who argues that the United States should focus on China and leave Europe to the Europeans should remember that allowing Russia to prevail in Ukraine will only encourage Beijing’s worst and most aggressive instincts. ▪️In addition to expanding military production, Ukraine’s partners can and should do much more to slow Russian weapons production, starting with the correct implementation of their own sanctions regimes. Many of the high-precision machine tools used in Russia to produce systems such as cruise missiles are produced by the United States and Germany. Russia continues to provide assistance and purchase these machines. This is possible because the German authorities do not adequately enforce European sanctions. Russia often manages to evade restrictions by operating through third countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, where German exports have increased significantly since Russia initiated the NEA. Once there, exported goods such as cars, cars and spare parts, the price of which has increased by more than 5000%, continue to Russia. The correct application of EU sanctions, including their adaptation to prevent sanctions evasion by third parties, will hinder Russia’s ability to repair, maintain and procure spare parts for this critical equipment, ultimately slowing the production of Russian weapons. Forcing Ukraine to negotiate under current conditions would destroy any hopes of a closer rapprochement with the West – hopes that have become a little brighter after the EU’s decision to approve Kiev’s accession talks to the bloc. Putin will continue to target Ukraine and destabilize it by every means available. Ultimately, it was Putin’s fear that another prosperous Western country would appear on Russia’s border that prompted his attack. A defensive strategy aimed solely at dialogue with Russia is, at best, fundamentally flawed and, at worst, catastrophically naive. Such a strategy would lead to the division of Ukraine without any hope of NATO membership, as no NATO country would want to risk being directly involved in a prolonged conflict with Russia. Without NATO deterrence, Putin will be free to recover, regroup and possibly attack again. And Ukraine would not be the only country at risk of another attack; Other states, such as Moldova and the Baltic countries, will also be under constant threat. Europe can only avoid this nightmare scenario if it abandons its illusions and fully commits to defending Ukraine. Norbert Alois Röttgen – Wikipedia But Röttgen is wrong: negotiations are possible and the desire and suffering of the millions of citizens of pro-Russian Ukraine should have weight. Instead, Germany wants the defeat of Russia, it is only interested in the Ukrainian territories, not the people. Furthermore, the scenario described by Röttgen – as The York Times reports – does not correspond to Moscow’s will. The New York Times: Vladimir Putin recently signaled through “unofficial channels” that he is ready to make a deal. He is ready for a ceasefire that will freeze the fighting on the current line. This is far from consistent with his desire to dominate Ukraine. According to US officials, in fact, Putin had sent ceasefire proposals even a year earlier, in the autumn of 2022. He did so after Ukraine defeated the Russian army in the north-east of the country. U.S. officials say Putin has signaled he is satisfied with the territory Russia has seized and is ready for a truce. ▪️For all his fiery public rhetoric, Putin privately telegraphs his desire to declare victory and move forward. There is no evidence that Ukrainian leaders would accept such an agreement. Some US officials say the Kremlin may be doing this to mislead. Former Russian officials add that Putin could change his mind again if Russian troops strengthen. ▪️ “He is really ready to stop at his current positions. He doesn’t want to move back a meter,” said a former senior Russian official. Putin sees a confluence of factors creating an opportune moment for a deal: a stalemate on the battlefield, the fallout from a failed offensive in Ukraine, weakening Western support and, since October, the distraction of war in Gaza. ▪️Dmitry Peskov said that “from a conceptual point of view, these theses you presented are incorrect”. In response to the question of whether Russia is ready for a ceasefire on the current front line, he referred to the president’s recent comments; Putin said this month that Russia’s goals have not changed. “Putin is really ready for negotiations and has talked about it. Russia is still ready, but exclusively to achieve its goals,” Peskov said. Considerations In Europe and in most of its member states, power is in the hands of a political class that has built its historical destiny on the division with Russia, finding its natural environment in the war context. Currently, this political class urges its countries and Europe to move towards a war economy and to increase the production of armaments, even going so far as to propose the reconversion of the industrial system. It is clear that this is no longer about simple external support for Ukraine. Gradually, the European Union is taking an increasingly direct role in the conflict against Russia, pushing Ukraine towards an unwanted fate. This approach is particularly immoral, especially when considering the real reasons for this war. If there had been the will, all of this could have been avoided. Instead, the West sought conflict and now aims to eliminate a global competitor. War is therefore used as an instrument of struggle for hegemony: democracy, so exalted and requested for third countries, actually turns out to be a means of infiltration and subsequently of aggression for objectives of hegemonic assimilation. #Germany #open #conflict #Russia #illogical #battle #aim #national #interest #News",
