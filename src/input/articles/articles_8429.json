    "title": "FTC Files Response to NonCompetes Ban Challenge",
    "text": "Yesterday (May 29), in Ryan, LLC et al. v. The Federal Trade Commission, the FTC filed its response in opposition to Plaintiffs’ request to stay/enjoin the FTC Rule banning non-competes from taking effect on September 4. The Court has committed to issuing a decision on Plaintiffs’ request no later than July 3. Consistent with commentary to the Rule, the main thrust of the FTC’s response argues it has authority to issue the Rule pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act’s directive that Congress “empowered and directed” the FTC to prevent the use of unfair methods of competition through rulemaking. The FTC also devotes significant briefing to dispelling the application of the “major questions doctrine” to curtail its regulatory ability. We anticipate the Court’s decision will most likely hinge on whether the Court applies the major questions doctrine – articulated in the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency – to grant a nationwide injunction enjoining the Rule. In the West Virginia decision, the Supreme Court found the EPA’s policy involved a “major question” and that the agency went too far in its attempt to regulate absent explicit permission from Congress to do so. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit employed that same rationale to affirm a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of President Biden’s COVID-19 federal contractor vaccine mandate. The Fifth Circuit’s decision likely drove the filing of the two lawsuits challenging the Rule in Texas federal courts, which sit in the Fifth Circuit. Plaintiff’s reply briefs are due June 12.",

    "title": "Rising spots: Odisha home to 696 leopards",
    "text": "BHUBANESWAR: At 696, the number of leopards has increased in the state as compared to previous estimates, revealed the first ‘All Odisha Leopard Estimation’ report of the state government on Thursday.\nReleased by Forest and Environment minister Ganesh Ram Singhkhuntia on the occasion of 70th Wildlife Week here, the report said the leopard number has increased by around 128 more than the previous count of 568 recorded by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in 2022.\nAround 45 per cent of leopard population is located outside the protected area network, indicating presence of a considerable number of the majestic cats in territorial forest divisions. The rare melanistic leopard morph was also recorded in three forest divisions.\nWith approximately 200 leopards, Similipal landscape was found having the highest number these big cat species. Satkosia tiger landscape turned out to be another promising site with the second highest concentration of these predators. Hirakud wildlife division, which includes Debrigarh sanctuary, is another key habitat with significant leopard population, the report stated.\nThe state government carried out the estimation for the first time in May this year after the Status of Leopard in India-2022 report of the NTCA said leopard population in Odisha recorded a ‘significant decline’ and the count of the big cats in the state plunged to 568 from 760 in 2018.\nReports of more than 100 leopard skins being seized in the state during last six years also turned out to be a major embarrassment for the government pointing at the rampant poaching of the species and poor conservation efforts of the Forest department.\nForest officials, however, said the fresh estimation involved a more intensive leopard monitoring. As part of the estimation, a statewide field survey was conducted to identify leopard presence through various signs, including pug marks, scrapes, scats, rakes, urine spray, vocalisations and livestock depredation. Sites with confirmed direct or indirect evidence of leopard were monitored using camera traps to estimate the minimum number of unique adult leopards based on their distinctive rosette patterns.\nWhile the rise in leopard count is a positive sign, the figure is still 64 less than the 2018 enumeration. PCCF, Wildlife Susanta Nanda said the censuses of 2018 and 2022 were carried out in limited areas, whereas in 2024, the estimation was conducted across 47 divisions. Besides, the statistical error which was around 35 per cent in 2018 and 33 per cent in 2022, is less than 10 per cent in the present count. Nanda further said the 284 unique leopards captured in the camera trap this year is also the highest compared to 162 captures in 2022 and 63 in 2018.\nIt was difficult to issue division-wise statistics of the species as the landscape of these big cats is huge and spread across multiple divisions, he added.",

    "title": "Centre, Assam ink “historic” peace agreement with pro-talks ULFA",
    "text": "Guwahati: In a momentous peace agreement marking the end of decades-long insurgency in Assam, the Centre and the\nAssam government signed a “historic” Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) with the pro-talks faction of United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) in New Delhi on Friday.\nUnion home minister Amit Shah, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and senior officials of the Union ministry of home affairs and Assam government were present during the signing of the tripartite agreement.\nReportedly, 16 representatives of the pro-talks ULFA faction, comprising leaders such as Arabinda Rajkhowa, Anup Chetia and Sasadhar Choudhury among others, were present during the MoS signing ceremony at the Union ministry of home affairs in North Block.\nUnion home minister Shah, in his address, said, “This agreement is a significant milestone to fulfill Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of a peaceful, prosperous and insurgency-free Northeast and bringing everlasting peace, prosperity and all-round development of Assam. With the signing of this agreement today, a new era of peace will begin for the entire Northeast, especially Assam. The Narendra Modi government has now achieved success in eliminating all violent groups in Assam.”\nAssuring that a time-bound programme will be made by the home ministry to implement the MoS in letter and spirit and fulfill the demands of ULFA, Shah said a committee would be formed for monitoring the progress of implementation of the peace pact.\n“In fact, in all the agreements signed after 2019, the Modi government has been ahead of time and efforts have been made to fulfill all the conditions,” he said.\nThe Union home minister further said that according to records, more than 9000 cadres have surrendered and that the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) had been lifted from 85 percent areas of Assam.\n“Under the agreement, the ULFA representatives have agreed to abjure the path of violence, lay down all their arms and ammunition and disband their armed organisation. Moreover, ULFA has also agreed to vacate all camps occupied by its armed cadres, engage in the peaceful democratic process established by law and maintain the integrity of the country,” he said.\nFormed in 1979 with the demand for a “sovereign Assam”, ULFA was declared a banned outfit by the central government in 1990.\nThe Union home minister further said that about 10,000 people, who were killed during the decades long ULFA conflict, were citizens of this country. “But today, this problem is being completely resolved. The Government of India has agreed to provide a huge package and several big projects for all round development of Assam. The central government will comply with all provisions of the agreement,” Shah said.\nRecalling the years after the formation of the Modi government in 2014, the home minister said incidents of violence in Assam decreased by 87 percent, deaths by 90 percent and kidnappings by 84 percent.\n“Till date, about 7500 ULFA cadres have surrendered in Assam alone, which will have an addition of over 700 cadres today, thereby taking the number of surrendered cadres to over 8200 in Assam alone, which signals the dawn of a new era of peace,” he said.\nShah said that under the guidance of Prime Minister Modi, the ministry of home affairs worked with the vision of a Northeast, free from extremism, violence and conflict. “As many as nine peace pacts and border-related agreements in the Northeast have been signed over the past five years,” he said.\n“The Centre has signed the NLFT agreement in 2019, Bru and Bodo peace pacts in 2020, Karbi peace agreement in 2021, Adivasi peace agreement in 2022, the Assam-Meghalaya border agreement (in six areas of difference) in 2022, the Assam-Arunachal border agreement earlier this year, the agreement with UNLF recently, and today, this MoS with ULFA,” the home minister said.\nIt may be recalled that the ULFA pro-talks faction, under the leadership of Arabinda Rajkhowa, had initiated unconditional discussions with the central government in 2011, overcoming strong opposition from the Paresh Barua-led anti-talks faction, ULFA (Independent).\nSpeaking to mediapersons after the signing ceremony, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that “except one individual, who is now leading the anti-talks faction of ULFA, all the founding members of ULFA were here today”.\n“These people came to Delhi in 1993 also, when Prime Minister Narasimha Rao was there. Initial discussions took place, but it could not be taken to a logical conclusion. So, after 1993, today, they have visited North Block again and they have signed the accord. They have assured us that the outfit will be disbanded. They are now living in camps, so they will disband the camps, they will deposit their arms, and 726 cadres will be in the mainstream.”\nNotably, top leaders of the pro-talks faction of ULFA comprising Anup Chetia and Sasadhar Choudhury had been camping in New Delhi since Monday to hold last-minute discussions before finalising the content of the tripartite peace agreement.\nEarlier this month, chief minister Sarma had said that the peace agreement with the pro-talks ULFA group would incorporate political, economic, and cultural safeguards as well as land rights for the indigenous people of the state.\nThe chief minister had also stated that Centre and the state government were pursuing talks with the Paresh Barua-led ULFA (Independent) as well.\nMeanwhile, terming the historic peace agreement with the ULFA as a moment of socio-economic optimism for Assam, Union Minister and former Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal welcomed the development.\n“Peace with ULFA reaffirms ‘Modi Ki Guarantee’ for a resurgent, peaceful and vibrant Assam,” Sonowal who was in Dibrugarh on Friday, said.\nDear Reader,\nOver the past four years, EastMojo revolutionised the coverage of Northeast India through our sharp, impactful, and unbiased coverage.

This is ‘Modi Ki Guarantee’ when decades old insurgency has come to a halt, powering socio-economic optimism in Assam.”\n“I take this opportunity to congratulate Union home minister Amit Shah ji for his untiring effort to steer this peace process to reach its logical conclusion, ensuring the culmination of a historic incident on a positive note,” Sonowal said.\nAlso Read |\nEfforts underway to empower women through water hyacinth skills in Kaziranga\nTrending Stories\nLatest Stories\nHate salad or veggies?

    "text": "Democrats have finally learned how to do an insult — with a smile and a shiv, and make sure the insult is about his positions and his policies, not about his race, his waist, his hair. Insult what he says and what he does, not what he is (genetically speaking, that is). Words like “weird” and “creepy” work because they are accurate and because they are delivered in a humorous way, in a more-in-sorrow-than-anger way. Harris and Walz are doing that. Trump can’t. (Seems Vance can’t, either, but that’s a lesser story.) More and more GOP operatives are telling Trump his insults and attacks aren’t working, aren’t going to work, and will cost him the election. Republicans practically beg Trump to change it up. He’s not listening. Former Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway offered a recipe this week for Trump’s struggling 2024 campaign: “The winning formula for President Trump is very plain to see: It’s fewer insults, more insights and [a] policy contrast.” Fellow former Trump adviser Peter Navarro echoed that. “When Trump attacks [Vice President Kamala] Harris personally rather than on policy, Harris’s support among swing voters rises — particularly among women,” Navarro said.

Trump is not listening. Trump Allies Fear He’s Sabotaging His Own Campaign Trump has been in a self-destructive spiral since the moment Democrats replaced Joe Biden with Kamala Harris. . . . Republican donors and Trump campaign officials are struggling to understand why Trump seems to be sabotaging his own candidacy. One theory, according to sources, is that Trump has been experiencing trauma from his near-death experience following the assassination attempt at the rally last month in Butler, Pennsylvania. . . . Another theory is that Trump can’t let go of the fact that Biden dropped out. “They cheated by swapping Biden,” Trump has told people, according to a person who recently spent time with the Republican presidential nominee. The Trump campaign believed that Harris’s honeymoon would fade, but instead, the opposite has happened: Her momentum is surging.

The Trump campaign believed that Harris’s honeymoon would fade, but instead, the opposite has happened: Her momentum is surging. And get this: The emperor of insult, the director of dirty tricks, the sultan of snide, Roger Stone himself, wants Trump to cool it: Even Roger Stone wants Trump to tone down Harris attacks — but he's not listening There are several reasons for this: He does have Project 2025, or course, but he keeps running away from that because he knows it won’t sell politically. But he doesn’t have anything else. He gave a “speech” yesterday about his economic plan: Tic Tacs, tampons, turmoil: What Trump’s ‘economy’ speech actually covered But the broader issue here is that Trump’s “economy” speech was not a speech on the economy. It was a standard Trump campaign speech, with a few more lines about economic proposals slotted in on occasion. Over the course of the nearly 12,000 words spoken from the stage, about 2,000 actually detailed the economy. And even those were generally a mishmash of robotic teleprompter pledges and off-the-cuff riffs about whatever happened to be on Trump’s mind.

But there too, it’s mostly insults and promises to do the things he promised — and failed — to do the last time: build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. So: Trump’s insults are turning voters off, plus Harris and Walz are showing him they are better at insults than he is (better than Vance, too). The GOP is screaming (well, whispering) at him that he’s going to lose, and they are going to lose, if he keeps this up. Which he will — it’s all he knows, and more importantly, it’s all he has. — Minor Update 3:05 PM PDT",

    "title": "The kernel of limitless joy",
    "text": "by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev Unlike temporary ecstasy, true bliss is an innate, self-sustaining essence within us; by exploring the layers of our existence through practices of yoga, we can access profound joy, says SADHGURU JAGGI VASUDEV. Describing the sacred as brahmanand is our unique contribution to the planet. Yog offers us a ladder to this fount of bliss that is the source of all creation. What exactly is bliss? For many, it is simply a psychedelic drug! This is because most people confuse blissfulness with pleasure or ecstasy. However, pleasure is essentially unsustainable, and dependent on an external stimulus. Bliss, however, does not depend on anything external. It is independent, self-sustaining, constant. It is your own nature. You do not earn it from outside; you access it from within. For instance, you watched a sunrise and felt wonderful for a moment. If that moment of sensory pleasantness could become a part of your life energy, your entire experience of life would be dramatically altered. However, for this to happen, you must be able to hold the experience for at least twenty four minutes. This enables the experience to move from the sensory to the neurological system, and then pervade the deeper, more elaborate energetic system, or pranamay kosh. Once pleasantness sweeps through the energy body, love and bliss become your qualities. You are no longer experiencing bliss; you are bliss. Twenty four minutes of pleasantness should not be difficult to sustain. However, the mind intervenes and complicates things. This is where yog becomes so vital. If you open your mouth and wait for raindrops to fall on your tongue, it can be a frustrating method to quench your thirst. The tongue is an inadequate receptacle, and the rains are only seasonal. But if you dig your own well, you have water throughout the year. The yogic science is about learning to dig your own well, so you find a bountiful water source right within you. At one time, we believed that the will of God determined whether a tree in our home bore fruit or not. But then we learnt to take charge. Now we know how to treat the problem of a non-fruit-bearing tree. Similarly, if your inner bliss has not blossomed, it simply means you aren’t doing the right things. Once you see that, a spiritual process can begin. As we engineer the outside, there is also a way to engineer our interiority. There is a way for a piece of creation to transform itself into the creator. Yog encompasses several methods or tantras that bring the first three layers of the human being — the physical, mental and energy bodies — into alignment. This creates a passageway to the innermost core of the self. Now, bliss becomes our natural state of being. The time is ripe for Bliss Tantra, a method to access that kernel of limitless joy within each one of us. Let us make it happen. Top Comment {{{short}}} {{#more}} {{{long}}} [...

    "text": "The Ottawa County farm teaches people about the importance of preserving nature. OAK HARBOR, Ohio (WTVG) - A special program at Earth Heart Farms in Ottawa County is designed to teach people about the importance of preserving nature. It also helps educate and cultivate future conservationists. The land where Earth Heart Farms sits was originally a family farm. But, it was taken out of production more than 30 years ago. The hope is that by sharing the story with younger generations, they will come away with a new appreciation for nature and be encouraged to help preserve our corner of the planet. Earth Heart Farms is an 80-acre property in Oak Harbor. “People come out here and go, ‘Ahhh. It’s so quiet, so peaceful. It’s instant calm,’” Vicki Rae Harder-Thorne, an owner of the property said. Harder-Thorne said her family farmed the land for more than a century. After a number of family discussions dating back to her grandfather, her mother started the process of taking the land out of production in 1992. “About a decade ago, I joined her in the fall to collect seeds. I got it. I understood her deep love of this place and the connection to her ancestors and those who lived here before them. I understood just how much you nurture yourself as you nurture the land,” Harder-Thorne said. The land is once again home to wetlands and prairies that attract and help sustain all kinds of animals. It is also a prime space for pollinators. Harder-Thorne and her family have been sharing their creation with local school children for the last few years. “We have area schools come out in the fall to do field days and learn things like how to do data collections, check on resource quality and the bio-diversity out here,” Harder-Thorne said. The farm’s work is aimed at planting seeds. “That is all it takes. One child whose life is changed, one child who now understands they are part of nature, not outside it, one child who now understands that everything you do matters,” Harder-Thorne said. What is happening at Earth Heart Farms is a small part of the big picture when it comes to protecting the planet, and it benefits all of us. “We’ve realized that wetlands help naturally filter water and clean it out which helps prevent harmful algal blooms. By bringing back wetlands like the ones here, we are helping filter the water before it goes into Lake Erie,” Basia Gawin, a park ranger at Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge said. Taking care of the land is a year-round job and a community effort. Harder-Thorne said all the work pays immediate dividends. And she is reminded of that through the fall field trips. “Some of the students had never been off of concrete and so they lay in the sun in the grass, just enjoying that feeling of the earth underneath them. They can’t get over that there are grasses that are taller than they are, that there are butterflies just flying around here,” Harder-Thorne said. The goal is to ensure that what is happening now continues for generations. “I am hoping this stays this way forever. I have taken steps with my family to help make that happen and it feels really good,” Harder-Thorne said. There will be more student field trips at Earth Heart Farms this week and next. The goal is to continue growing the reach of the farm. Latest Local News | First Alert Weather | Crime | National | 13abc Originals Copyright 2024 WTVG. All rights reserved.",
