    "text": "MCPHERSON, Kan. (KAKE) – A 96-year-old Kansas woman isn’t letting her age stop her from spreading holiday cheer in a big way.\nFor the last few years, Mary Peterson has hand written thousands of greeting cards and sent them to members of the military who cannot make it home to be with their families.\nPeterson said the first year, she sent 7,000 Christmas cards. By this year, she increased her numbers to 8,000.\nSince she started in 2020, Peterson has sent 24,000 cards to military members all around the world.\nPeterson said when she was in high school, her older brother served overseas, and she wrote to him every single week.\nLater, her husband fought in World War II, so she knows very well how lonely the holidays can be for people in the military.\n“There’s so many heartaches and broken homes and people went to the service because it was something else for them to do. And they won’t hear from family because they’ve lost their connection,” Peterson said.\nThankfully, the community members help Peterson by donating thousands of blank holiday cards for her to write in. After she’s done filling them out, Peterson takes them to the Fort Riley base, where they then get sent out to active-duty members in different parts of the world.\nEach card shares the same sweet message: “God bless you and keep you safe. That is my prayer for you. Grandma Mary, McPherson, Kansas.”\nPeterson said she averages writing about 50 cards per day, which means she has to start mid-summer to get them done in time.\nThe 96-year-old said as long as God keeps her hand steady enough to write in beautiful cursive, she’ll never stop sending these letters.\n“I hope that makes them realize that there’s somebody that still loves them and loves what they’re doing,” Peterson said.\nCopyright 2023 KAKE via CNN Newsource.

    "text": "Global partnerships that embed scientific research into clinical care are revolutionising the diagnosis and treatments for children with rare genetic diseases, according to a new report.\nThe white paper found despite advances in genomic technologies, which can detect rare genetic diseases within days, there remained significant challenges to ensuring this leads to improved child health outcomes. But global collaborations, such as the International Precision Child Health Partnership (IPCHiP), using evidence-based approaches to inform decisions in real-time, are overhauling patient care.\nThe paper was led by , , , and .\nRare diseases are becoming increasingly common affecting about 300 million people globally. One in three children with a rare disease will die before the age of five.\nMCRI Associate Professor Katherine Howell said identifying a genetic diagnosis was the first step in delivering precision medicine.\nMore than 70 per cent of rare diseases, now totalling up to 10,000, have a genetic cause.\n\"Advances in genomic technologies, especially exome sequencing and genome sequencing, and integrating these tests into clinical settings have considerably improved diagnostic yields for rare diseases,\" Associate Professor Howell said.\nImage: Associate Professor Katherine Howell\n\"A genetic diagnosis often informs clinical management, treatment, prognosis and access to resources and support. Over 600 rare disease genes that often emerge in childhood and cause severe disorders have treatment available, underscoring the urgency for improving diagnosis rates.\"\nThe report, published in npj Genomic Medicine on Rare Diseases Day, found with limited and often inequitable access to genomic testing, wide-sweeping international efforts were needed to accelerate accurate diagnosis and implement evidence-based practice changes.\n\"A coordinated approach on a global scale can energise collaboration and maximise research output by building on the diverse expertise and existing efforts, reducing duplication and creating frameworks for responsible data collection and sharing,\" Associate Professor Howell said.\n\"Multidisciplinary collaborations are also required to connect clinicians with scientists to advance our understanding of diseases and forge partnerships with industry, foundations, and patient advocacy groups to identify opportunities for development of new therapies and rapidly translate them to the clinic.\"\nIPCHiP, an international consortium leveraging the medical and scientific expertise from MCRI, SickKids, Boston Children's Hospital, GOS ICH and GOSH aims to use genomic data to accelerate discovery and therapeutic options. It has recently been designated a 'Driver Project' of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH).\nSickKids Professor Stephen Scherer said by embedding research in clinical practice, IPCHiP was generating the evidence and model needed to advance precision medicine.\n\"IPCHiP is the first major global clinical collaboration around genomics and precision child health,\" he said. Thanks to our international partnership focused on rare diseases, we can forge innovative diagnostic solutions and work towards new treatments that improve health outcomes.\"\nIPCHiP's initial flagship project, Gene-STEPS found that rapid genome sequencing was highly effective at diagnosing babies with epilepsy and lead to better, more targeted treatment options in most cases. The research, published in The Lancet Neurology, reported rapid genome sequencing had a high diagnostic rate of 43 per cent for infantile epilepsy, supporting the need for greater access to the cutting-edge technology in clinical care.\nMCRI Professor John Christodoulou said a top priority of IPCHiP was exploring approaches that could overcome challenges around how data was currently shared, accessed and used international.\n\"The team is using the Gene-STEPS findings to establish a data network that will allow shared analysis of clinical and genomic information generated from collaborative projects for any paediatric rare disease,\" he said.\n\"Genomic data obtained in childhood and from reproductive carrier screening will help us in the future to tackle the common health issues such as heart disease and cancer.\"\nIPCHiP is expanding its work on rapid genomic testing to other genetic conditions that could benefit from a prompt diagnosis. Its next cohort, GEMStone, will focus on newborns with hypotonia, where a baby is born with low muscle tone, which can lead to difficulties in feeding, holding their head up and achieving developmental milestones.\nPublication\nKatherine B.

    "text": "A Secretaria de Estado de Saúde (Sesau), por meio do Programa Nacional de Imunização (PNI) em Alagoas, reforça, junto à população, a importância de manter o calendário vacinal sempre atualizado, evitando a reintrodução de doenças como o sarampo. Isso porque a doença viral, considerada grave, pode deixar sequelas graves, além de levar à morte.\nEntre as suas principais características, estão manchas vermelhas no corpo e febre alta, além de tosse seca, irritação nos olhos e mal estar intenso. A transmissão acontece por via aérea, por meio da tosse, espirro, fala e respiração, sendo considerada altamente contagiosa.\nÉ importante ressaltar que a vacina contra o sarampo é disponibilizada pelo Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) nos postos municipais, localizados nos 102 municípios alagoanos.\nNo caso da vacina contra o sarampo, o SUS assegura a tríplice viral, que também imuniza contra outras duas doenças: a caxumba e a rubéola. Contudo, dependendo da faixa etária, ela é preconizada em duas doses ou em dose única, segundo o esquema vacinal estabelecido pelo PNI.\n“A vacina tríplice viral deve ser aplicada em duas doses. A primeira, a partir dos 12 meses de idade, e a segunda com um ano e três meses. Adultos que ainda não foram imunizados, com idade entre 20 a 29 anos, devem receber as duas doses, com intervalo de 30 dias entre as aplicações. Quanto aos adultos de 30 até 59 anos, é preconizada apenas uma dose”, explicou a enfermeira Alana Nunes, que atua no Programa Estadual de Combate às Doenças Imunopreveníveis.\nA doença\nO sarampo é uma doença provocada por vírus, que é considerada grave e pode levar ao óbito. Suas principais características são a presença de manchas vermelhas no corpo e febre alta, além de tosse seca, irritação nos olhos e mal estar intenso.\nA exemplo do que ocorreu em 2022 e 2023, Alagoas se manteve livre do sarampo durante todo o ano de 2024, consolidando três anos consecutivos sem registros da doença, conforme dados do Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação do Ministério da Saúde (Sinan/MS).",

    "title": "\"Beau boulot, Joe!\": Donald Trump réagit aux lapsus de son rival à la présidentielle américaine",
    "text": "L'ancien président républicain, de nouveau candidat à la Maison Blanche, s'est moqué de la nouvelle bourde de son adversaire démocrate qui s'est trompé dans l'identité de sa vice-présidente ce jeudi 11 juillet lors d'une conférence de presse au sommet de l'Otan à Washington. Une prise de parole qui n'a pas rassuré. Lors d'une conférence de presse organisée ce jeudi 11 juillet en marge du sommet de l'Otan à Washington, le président américain Joe Biden a multiplié les bourdes, rebaptisant par exemple le président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky en Vladimir Poutine .\nDès les premières minutes de cette conférence, les choses ont mal tourné pour le président démocrate, candidat à sa réélection. \"Écoutez, je n'aurais pas choisi le vice-président Trump si elle n'était pas qualifiée pour être présidente\", a-t-il lancé, voulant évidemment évoquer sa vice-présidente Kamala Harris, sans se reprendre sur cette erreur.\n\"Beau boulot, Joe!\", a lancé l'ancien président Donald Trump sur son réseau Truth Social, n'hésitant pas à repartager la séquence. \"Je suis déterminé à être candidat\" Joe Biden a parfois bafouillé ou peiné à finir ses phrases, mais aussi démontré sa maîtrise de dossiers internationaux notamment, sans notes ni prompteur. Il a une nouvelle fois balayé les mauvais sondages et affirmé qu'il était \"le plus qualifié\" pour l'emporter en novembre face à son prédécesseur républicain.\nS'il dit être déterminé à rester dans la course, Joe Biden n'arrive pas à faire taire la fronde qui secoue les démocrates depuis son débat catastrophique face à Donald Trump, le 27 juin. Et cela inquiète aussi les alliés. Le président américain avait à peine bouclé une heure d'échanges avec les journalistes que deux démocrates supplémentaires lui ont demandé de céder la place.\nBiden est-il vraiment capable de maintenir sa candidature? 15:46 En privé, de nombreux dirigeants de l'Otan craignent une victoire de Donald Trump à l'élection de novembre, ce dernier ayant vivement critiqué l'alliance et le fardeau injuste qui pèse selon lui sur les États-Unis. Il entretient aussi le flou sur le soutien à l'Ukraine.\n\"Je suis déterminé à être candidat, mais je pense qu'il est important d'apaiser les peurs\", a -t-il reconnu, en promettant de faire campagne activement. Ancien bègue, le président américain n'a jamais été un orateur flamboyant. Jeudi, il a parfois bafouillé ou peiné à finir ses phrases, mais aussi démontré sa maîtrise de dossiers internationaux notamment, sans notes ni prompteur.\nSur le même sujet Joe Biden s'accroche à sa candidature à la présidentielle lors d'une conférence de presse marquée par de nouveaux lapsus Joe Biden a répété plusieurs fois vouloir \"terminer le travail\" engagé en 2020, et assuré qu'il serait toujours capable, s'il était réélu, de \"gérer\" les présidents chinois et russe, Xi Jinping et Vladimir Poutine, dans trois ans.\ndossier : Donald Trump",
