    "text": "Local Firefighters Make “Good Stop” After Stroudsville Home Ignites\nSTROUDSVILLE, TENNESSEE: (Smokey Barn News) – Firefighters from across Robertson County made a good stop Wednesday afternoon after a Stroudsville-area home became engulfed in flames and smoke. Crews attacked the fire aggressively, battling not only the flames but also extreme temperatures, and managed to preserve about 40% of the structure.\nThe home is located in the 1300 block of Stroudsville Rd., just outside of Adams, the first call coming into 911 at 4:03 PM. MAP According to officials, all residents and pets were safely out of the home when fire crews arrived.\nThe caller told dispatchers that the fire may have started in the middle of the one-story home and quickly spread. A critical detail reported to 911 early in the call was the presence of 20 pounds of gunpowder stored inside the garage, adding to the danger for first responders.\nThick smoke was visible through the trees as crews arrived. Firefighters from multiple agencies were dispatched, including Adams Fire, Pleasant View Volunteer Fire, Cross Plains, White House Community Volunteer Fire, Springfield Fire, and Montgomery County, which sent several personnel on the closest available truck. Robertson County EMS and EMA also responded to the scene.\nUpon arrival, crews found heavy fire and smoke showing, and the fire was spreading into the attic. Crews moved quickly to get the fire under control, with command reporting progress on overhaul operations around 6 p.m.\nThe fire was officially marked under control at 5:38 p.m., but crews remained on scene for some time to monitor hotspots and begin overhaul efforts.\nAccording to officials, approximately 60% of the home was damaged by fire, smoke, and water. Pleasant View Volunteer Fire Chief Duncan told Smokey Barn News, “It was a good stop.” The home had undergone multiple additions over the years, which created structural complexities, such as multiple attic access points, that made firefighting efforts more challenging once the fire reached the attic. Despite the obstacles, about 40% of the home was saved, Duncan said.\nOne of the residents was transported to an area hospital with smoke inhalation. No other injuries were reported.\nAt this time, the cause of the fire has not been released.\nThis is a developing story. Smokey Barn News will provide updates as they become available.",

    "title": "Ukraine’s Kursk Offensive Has Revealed Russia's Military Weakness | The National Interest",
    "text": "Ukraine’s Kursk Offensive Has Revealed Russia's Military Weakness The daring attack has shown that Russia is actually unwilling to escalate, contrary to conventional wisdom. Over the past two weeks, Ukraine has taken its fight with the Kremlin onto Russian soil. [Kyiv’s offensive](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/new-kursk-offensive-ukraine%E2%80%99s-high-stakes-gamble-212278) consisted of a daring raid into Russia’s Kursk region designed to bring the fight to Russian forces and draw the Kremlin’s combat troops away from its own territory. Aside from a few headlines, though, Ukraine’s bold [strategic gamble](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/ukraines-kursk-operation-strategic-game-changer-against-russia-212388) has gone largely unnoticed. That’s a shame because Kyiv’s initiative—and Moscow’s response to it—has made clear that persistent Western [fears of Russian brinkmanship](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/russian-caution-should-be-lesson-211781) are overblown. Up until now, both U.S. and European policies have been defined by caution and fear of Russian risk-taking. While President Biden has pledged to back Kyiv’s fight for “ [as long as it takes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/07/12/remarks-by-president-biden-on-supporting-ukraine-defending-democratic-values-and-taking-action-to-address-global-challenges-vilnius-lithuania/),” in practice, his administration has been slow to provide Ukraine with the weaponry it needs to win the fight decisively. And even when it has, that aid has been accompanied by onerous restrictions that have had the effect of limiting Ukraine’s fighting potential. European nations, meanwhile, have taken their cues from Washington and settled in for a long campaign of incremental assistance to Ukraine. The result has been a situation that—at least until recently—had settled into [a strategic stalemate and positional warfare](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/01/ukraines-commander-in-chief-on-the-breakthrough-he-needs-to-beat-russia). That’s the equation Ukraine’s push into Russia is attempting to alter. In the process, however, it has also laid bare the hollowness of Moscow’s threats of strategic escalation in response to battlefield setbacks. Ever since the current conflict broke out in February 2022, the West has been concerned that “poking the bear” could prompt Russia to use nuclear weapons and escalate the war into a full-blown showdown with NATO. But Ukraine’s push north, through which it has managed to seize over [480 square miles](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-ukraine-controls-92-settlements-russias-kursk-region-2024-08-19/) of Russia’s Kursk Oblast, hasn’t elicited much of a response from Russia. To be sure, the Kremlin has mobilized in response, declaring a federal emergency in the region and redeploying [troops, tanks, and artillery](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/russia-declares-federal-emergency-border-region-attack-ukrainian-112704921) from the Ukraine front to (so far unsuccessfully) beat back the invaders. However, what Russia has not done is retaliate against Ukraine or its partners with any significant escalatory measures. [President Vladimir Putin](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/putin%E2%80%99s-wartime-dictatorship-enters-new-year-208223) has not ramped up the conflict in conventional terms. Nor has he used nuclear weapons against Russia’s western neighbor, as Russian officials have [threatened in the past](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-putin-nuclear-weapons-82ced2419d93ae733161b56fbd9b477d). Indeed, even with Ukrainian troops now entrenched in Russian territory, the Kremlin hasn’t made any maneuvers that could threaten to escalate the conflict further. Part of the reason for Russia’s restraint is no doubt practical. Simply put, Moscow is already using pretty much all the military resources at its disposal in its attempts to subjugate Ukraine. As such, Russia is unlikely to make moves so provocative that they might prompt the direct involvement of NATO. Indeed, there does not seem to be much that Russia might be able to do to turn the tables on Kyiv without risking the alliance entering the conflict. The lesson is worth heeding. As dominant as Russia’s strongman wants to appear, his government is in a far more precarious position than the West originally believed. Putin’s bluff has always been that he would be more willing to turn up the heat if the war doesn’t go his way. But the reality is that he cannot. All of Russia’s tanks, artillery, aircraft, missiles, and ships are as committed as they can be without exposing Russia to other attacks. And because they are, there are real-world limits to what Russia can realistically do to punish the West. Ukraine’s daring offensive, in other words, has laid bare a couple of critical truths. The first is that [Russia is weak](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/ukraines-kursk-offensive-has-upended-war-russia-212366) and constrained by the same sort of real-world limitations that afflict other powers. The second is that Ukraine, though embattled, can still find ways to break the stalemate and win this war.

    "text": "AtomBeam, a global expert in edge data efficiency solutions, has announced a significant accomplishment in its fundraising campaign on StartEngine, having successfully reached its maximum campaign target of $3 million. AtomBeam's unique tech, which can reduce machine data by an average of 75% almost in real-time, effectively quadrupling the bandwidth of existing connections, has garnered substantial interest and support from investors.\nThe company's fundraising success, reaching the $3 million target with a waitlist exceeding $2 million, underscores the faith and belief that the investor community places in AtomBeam's pioneering solutions.\n\"The import of this funding cannot be overstated in bringing AtomBeam's incredible data efficiency products into fruition,\" expressed Charles Yeomans, CEO of AtomBeam. He extolled the enormous potential of their technology to innovate the way machines relate to each other, whilst acknowledging the trust the investor community had placed in their mission.\n\"We are thankful for the trust and confidence vested in us and continue to stay committed to delivering results,\" he added.\nWith the recent attainment of the $3 million funding milestone, AtomBeam stands in an advantageous position to accelerate its growth by onboarding talent that will enable this trajectory. This will further perpetuate the development and sales of its products.\nAccording to the company, this investment will also draw in a high quality and pedigree of talent. This will help AtomBeam to extend the endorsement of its technology and strategic plans beyond its existing 35 patents and sizeable corporate partnerships.\nThe pioneering solutions and ground-breaking technology by AtomBeam are set to redefine how machines communicate in the future, according to the company.\nIn April of this year, AtomBeam, announced it had raised $1.3 million in its crowdfunding campaign on StartEngine, an important milestone for the company.\n\"We are thrilled to see the continued support of our investors, who recognize the potential of AtomBeam's technology to revolutionize how virtually every machine talks to another machine,\" said Yeomans. \"This successful raise brings us one step closer to achieving our engineering goals and driving adoption of our technology.\"\nOn the revolutionary technology of the company, Yeomans says, “Imagine your phone could send and receive data four times faster just with a software upgrade. Compaction does that by squeezing out all the inefficiencies in data transmission, and it does it so fast all you experience is, ‘Wow!’”",

    "text": "More cases, additional death reported in nationwide Boar's Head deli meat listeria outbreak Mary Walrath-Holdridge USA TODAY Show Caption\nHide Caption\nWhy food recalls are increasing E.Coli, metal and even a dead bat have been found in recalled food. In fact, food recalls are increasing. Yet, that might actually be a good sign. Here's why. USA TODAY The Boar's Head deli meat recall linked to a multi-state listeria outbreak has reportedly caused at least one more death and 10 new hospitalizations since late July. The additional cases come as health officials continue to investigate the outbreak that has caused at least three deaths, hospitalized at least another 40 people across 13 states and spawned multiple lawsuits. Boar's Head has recalled 71 products since July 26, equating to about 7.2 million pounds of deli meats.\nThe Boar's Head deli meat recall linked to a multi-state listeria outbreak has reportedly caused at least one more death and 10 new hospitalizations since late July, according to an update released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\nThe additional cases come as health officials continue to investigate the outbreak that has caused at least three deaths, hospitalized at least another 40 people across 13 states and spawned multiple lawsuits.\nSince the last wave of information was shared on July 31 , the number of affected people has continued to grow, with the most recent death occurring in Virginia. Nine additional cases of illness were also reported, bringing the total up to 43, all of whom ended up hospitalized, the CDC said Thursday.\nBoar's Head has recalled 71 products since July 26 , equating to about 7.2 million pounds of deli meats. The brand is also facing legal action, with at least one class-action suit on the books as of early August.\nHere's the most up-to-date information on the recall.\nListeria lawsuits: Boar's Head listeria outbreak triggers lawsuit against deli meat company in New York\nWhat Boar's Head products are recalled? Boar’s Head initially announced a recall for 207,528 pounds of liverwurst and other deli meats on July 26, followed by an expanded recall on July 30 to include over 7 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products.\nIn a July 30 statement from the company, Boar’s Head said that it initiated the expanded recall of all products produced at its Jarratt, Virginia facility after it learned that its Strassburger Brand Liverwurst had been linked to the national listeria outbreak.\nBoar’s Head Ready-to-Eat liverwurst products recalled\nProduced between June 11, 2024 and July 17, 2024, and have a 44-day shelf-life “Boar’s Head Strassburger Brand Liverwurst made in Virginia” 3.5-pound loaves in plastic casing, or various weight packages sliced in retail delis Sell-by dates range from July 25, 2024, to August 30, 2024\nOther Boar’s Head deli meat products\nBoar’s Head also recalled all deli products, including prepackaged deli products. Look for “EST. 12612” or “P-12612” inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels.\nMulti-state listeria outbreak kills three A listeria outbreak linked to sliced deli meat has led to 43 hospitalizations and three deaths in 13 states, according to an ongoing investigation by the CDC and U.S. Department of Agriculture. These numbers are up from the two deaths and 33 hospitalizations reported in late July.\nThe ages of the sick people range between 32 and 94, with the median being 75, CDC data showed. The three deaths were reported in Illinois, New Jersey and Virginia.\nThe CDC and USDA are currently aware of 13 states with infections as a result of the outbreak.\nThese states include:\nNew York: 14 Maryland: 8 New Jersey: 4 Massachusetts: 3 Missouri: 3 Virginia: 3 Georgia: 2 Minnesota: 1 Wisconsin: 1 Illinois: 1 Pennsylvania: 1 North Carolina: 1 Indiana: 1\nListeriosis or listeria poisoning symptoms Listeriosis, or listeria poisoning, is a foodborne bacterial infection most commonly caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. It is considered a serious condition and can be dangerous or life-threatening, especially to older adults, people with weak immune systems and pregnant women.\nAccording to the USDA, symptoms include:\nFever Muscle aches Headache Stiff neck Confusion Loss of balance Convulsions Diarrhea Other gastrointestinal symptoms Miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery and/or life-threatening infection of newborn infants Death People in higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food, said the USDA.\nWhat to do to stay safe The CDC advises people who are pregnant, 65 or older, or have weakened immune systems to take extra precautions to avoid becoming ill.\nAt-risk individuals should do as follows:\nDo not eat recalled deli meats. Throw them away or contact stores about returns. In addition, do not eat any other deli meats you get sliced at deli counters, unless it is reheated to an internal temperature of 165°F or until steaming hot. Let it cool before you eat it. Listeria can grow on foods kept in the refrigerator, but it is easily killed by heating food to a high enough temperature. Clean your refrigerator, containers and surfaces that may have touched sliced deli meats. This is especially important if you purchased any of the recalled deli products. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms: People who are not pregnant usually have fever, muscle aches, and tiredness. They may also get a headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or seizures. Pregnant people usually have fever, muscle aches, and tiredness. However, Listeria can cause pregnancy loss or premature birth. It can also cause serious illness or death in newborns.\nOne of the best ways to avoid listeriosis is to avoid foods that have not been properly stored or that may be more prone to carrying listeria bacteria. People who are at high risk, such as pregnant women and children, should avoid eating the following :\nUnpasteurized soft cheeses, such as queso fresco and brie. Unheated cheeses sliced at a deli. Unheated deli meat, cold cuts, hot dogs, and fermented or dry sausages. Premade deli salads, such as coleslaw and potato, tuna, or chicken salad. Refrigerated pâté or meat spreads. Refrigerated smoked fish. Raw or lightly cooked sprouts. Cut melon left out for more than 2 hours. One hour if it’s exposed to temperatures hotter than 90 degrees. Cut melon in refrigerator for more than a week. Raw (unpasteurized) milk, yogurt, and ice cream.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

    "title": "Indonesia Christians Concerned Over Muslim Opposition Toward Church",
    "text": "By Stefan J. Bos, Chief International Correspondent Worthy News\nJAKARTA ( Worthy News ) – Devoted Christians in an area of Indonesia’s South Sulawesi Province said Thursday they fear for their future after hardline local Muslims objected to their worship activities and construction of a church.\nChristians explained that the Toraja Christian Church of Lanraki (TCCL) in Paccerakkang village had gathered in a member’s home for two years.\nYet in May, the TCCL asked local authorities for permission to build a church to accommodate the growing number of church members, said the head of its construction committee, Makis Wata\nIn published remarks, Makis recalled being upset about a February 4 banner displayed in the nearby Makasar local police housing complex stating, “We, all Muslims in Paccerakkang, especially residents of RW 02 RT 02 and RT 03, strongly reject the construction of a church and religious activities in our area forever.”\nPastor Nicky Wakkary of the Pentecostal Church in Indonesia (Gereja Protestan di Indonesia, GPdI), who was banned from holding a Christmas service last year at his house in Cibinong, West Java Province, appealed to the Lanraki congregation to remain faithful.\n“The congregation must remain steadfast in their faith and support each other so that they remain steadfast,” despite the difficulties Pastor Nicky said. “At the same time, the congregation must learn more about the community social life around the place, which enables them to build a better relationship with the government and the community.”\nChristians said residents removed the banner early that afternoon, but the future remained uncertain. “The content of the banner is seen as hate speech, and Christians in the community fear it could lead to increased hostility toward their community,” added advocacy group International Christian Concern (ICC), which supports the believers.\n‘DISCRIMINATORY CONTENT’\n“The banner also contains discriminatory content against the church” and “degrades” minority groups such as Christians, the group stressed. “This contradicts Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which emphasizes, “Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.”\nICC added that “Indonesia has ratified international human rights instruments regarding the protection of the right to freedom of expression and religion” and urged local authorities to protect the Christians.\nChristians told Worthy News that the incident comes amid mounting concern about Islamic opposition toward churches involved in evangelism in Indonesia.\nDespite the difficulties, Christianity continues to spread in Indonesia, a mainly Muslim nation of 282 million people. And on Thursday, a massive prayer meeting occurred in the Medan area, Worthy News learned.\nThose identifying as “Christian” comprise roughly 11 percent of the population, including three percent evangelicals, according to researchers.\nYet a leader of a Christian movement of former Muslims and other Christian leaders suggested to Worthy News the actual figure may be higher as not everyone admits to having abandoned Islam.\nICC said it hopes Indonesia will continue to respect its constitution, which states that ” the state guarantees the freedom of each citizen to practice their respective religions and to worship according to their religion and beliefs.”",
