    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Festler in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Festler says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Festler standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Festler would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Festler told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Festler found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Festler said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Festler wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Festler gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Festler waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Festler is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Festler said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Festler added.",

    "text": "Une performance remarquable avec l’Union européenne\nLa Tunisie enregistre une année 2023 exceptionnelle dans ses échanges commerciaux avec l’Union européenne, affichant un excédent de 9.182 millions de dinars, soit une amélioration spectaculaire de 7.803 millions de dinars par rapport à 2022.\nSelon le rapport de la Banque Centrale de Tunisie, cette performance résulte d’une double dynamique : une progression de 12,3% des exportations conjuguée à une baisse de 8,1% des importations.\nLa France consolide sa position de premier partenaire\nPremier partenaire commercial de la Tunisie, la France représente 23% des exportations totales et 10% des importations en 2023. Les échanges bilatéraux ont généré un excédent de 5.854 millions de dinars, en hausse par rapport aux 4.170 millions de 2022.\nCette amélioration s’explique par une augmentation de 10,7% des exportations et une diminution de 3,8% des importations. Toutefois, en excluant le régime de transformation, la balance devient déficitaire de 950 millions de dinars.\nL’Italie réalise un spectaculaire retournement\nDeuxième partenaire commercial, l’Italie a absorbé 18% des exportations tunisiennes et fourni 13% des importations en 2023. Le pays est passé d’un déficit de 2.411 millions de dinars en 2022 à un excédent de 1.385 millions en 2023, grâce à une baisse de 17,4% des importations et une hausse de 17,5% des exportations.\nLes ventes de produits énergétiques ont notamment doublé, dépassant le milliard de dinars.\nL’Allemagne maintient sa position stratégique\nTroisième client de la Tunisie, l’Allemagne maintient un excédent commercial stable, passant de 2.800 à 2.745 millions de dinars. Les échanges ont été marqués par une progression plus rapide des importations (+16,8%) que des exportations (+9,8%).\nLes industries manufacturières dominent ces échanges, avec une forte croissance des exportations d’appareils électriques (+18%) et de pièces automobiles (+55,4%).\nL’Espagne opère un redressement significatif\nLa balance commerciale avec l’Espagne s’est nettement améliorée, passant d’un déficit de 873 millions de dinars à un excédent de 356 millions.\nCette performance résulte d’une baisse de 15,5% des importations, notamment céréalières (-89%), et d’une hausse de 27% des exportations, particulièrement d’huile d’olive (+90%).\nQue se passe-t-il en Tunisie?\nNous expliquons sur notre chaîne YouTube .

    "text": "健檢後約2成把報告「丟著」 上傳健保雲端可助追蹤\n（中央社記者曾以寧台北26日電）衛福部統計去年國人死因有3成與三高有關，國健署放寬成人健檢對象盼助早期發現，但專家指出，1到2成民眾健檢後就把報告丟著，建議可將資料上傳至健保雲端，助追蹤異常。\n衛生福利部國民健康署副署長魏璽倫今天在「預防三高醫起來、健康醫院幫你把關」記者會表示，根據113年國人十大死因統計，其中有5項與三高（高血壓、高血糖與高血脂）慢性病相關，包含心臟疾病、腦血管疾病、糖尿病、高血壓性疾病及急性腎衰竭及慢性腎病，共造成6.1萬人死亡，占總死亡人數約30%。\n魏璽倫說，三高若能及早發現，有機會可以逆轉。國健署自今年起下調成人預防保健服務年齡至30歲，增加「三高慢性病」風險評估服務，並提供健康生活衛教，聚焦從三高檢查結果找出高風險族群，並介入與追蹤照護，強化三高慢性病預防。\n成功大學醫學院附設醫院斗六分院院長吳晉祥指出，過去成人預防保健僅針對40歲以上，但整體利用率僅3成不到，其中以60幾歲族群最高，40多歲族群則利用率最低。\n雖然多數人都知道，體檢報告出來之後，若有數值異常，應回到門診進行追蹤，但吳晉祥指出，仍有不少人以為體檢結束就「結束了」，過去研究發現，約有1到2成的人做完體檢之後，就把報告丟著，即使有紅字也不會追蹤，甚至可能不會認真看報告。\n聖馬爾定醫院院長特別助理劉子秸分享，醫院透過數位科技運用，若民眾同意將健檢資料上傳至健保雲端，可掌握個人健康存摺資訊，醫院即會提供進行生活型態評估、衛教講座及衛生指導、與民眾共同訂定健康目標，助80%病人穩定控制三高，落實全人健康管理。\n國健署指呼籲民眾善用勞工健檢、公教健檢、成人預防保健服務等政府提供的各類健康檢查。並鼓勵民眾同意醫療院所協助將健檢結果上傳至健保署健康存摺，健康存摺將主動連結相關健康管理方案或衛教資源，由醫療團隊提供服務，協助民眾採行健康生活，共同逆轉、延後三高慢性病的發生。（編輯：李錫璋）1140626\n本網站之文字、圖片及影音，非經授權，不得轉載、公開播送或公開傳輸及利用。",

    "text": "Are you ready to power up your potential? In a world that moves at lightning speed, staying informed about business news has become more crucial than ever. From global economic shifts to emerging industry trends, knowledge truly is power in the fast-paced realm of commerce. So, grab your virtual reading glasses and join us as we explore why staying up-to-date with business news can unlock endless opportunities for growth and success. Get ready to empower yourself with the ultimate weapon – knowledge!\nThe Importance of Staying Informed about Business News\nIn today’s fast-paced and ever-changing business landscape, staying informed about the latest news and updates in the industry is crucial for individuals and organizations alike. Whether you are a business owner, an employee, or even a consumer, keeping up with business news can bring numerous benefits and help you thrive in the competitive market.\nOne of the primary reasons why staying informed about business news matters is that it empowers individuals with knowledge. When you are updated on what’s happening in the business world, you gain valuable insights into market trends, consumer behavior, and emerging technologies. This knowledge can help businesses make better decisions, plan ahead, and stay ahead of their competition.\nMoreover, staying informed about business news also allows individuals to adapt quickly to changes in the market. With technology advancements and globalization bringing constant disruptions to industries across the globe, keeping up-to-date with recent developments has become crucial for survival. By being aware of new trends and shifts in industries relevant to your field of work or interest, you can stay ahead of potential risks and capitalize on opportunities as they arise.\nBeing well-informed about business news also helps individuals build their credibility in professional settings. Whether it’s networking events or job interviews, having an understanding of current affairs shows that you are knowledgeable and engaged with your surroundings. It demonstrates your ability to stay updated on industry trends and challenges while highlighting your commitment towards continuous learning.\nHow Business News Can Impact Your Life\nThe world of business is constantly evolving and changing. Every day, new companies are formed, markets shift, and financial dynamics fluctuate. As individuals, it may seem like we are not directly affected by these changes in the business world. However, staying informed about business news can actually have a significant impact on our daily lives.\nFirst and foremost, being knowledgeable about business news can help us make informed decisions in our personal finances. Whether you are a working professional or a student just starting to manage your own money, understanding the latest developments in the business world can provide valuable insights into making smart investments, managing debt and credit cards, and planning for retirement. For example, if you know that there has been an economic downturn in certain industries due to market trends or policy changes, you may choose to invest your money elsewhere instead of taking unnecessary risks.\nFurthermore, keeping up with business news can also help us stay ahead of potential job market changes and opportunities. In today’s fast-paced society where technology advances at breakneck speed and industries are constantly shifting focus or downsizing due to economic factors, it is crucial to be aware of any changes that may affect your career path. By following business news closely, you can gain a better understanding of which fields or skills are in demand and adjust your career goals accordingly. Additionally, it can also give you an edge during job interviews if you are well-informed about current industry trends.\nTools and Technologies for Staying Updated on Business News\nIn today’s fast-paced and ever-evolving business world, it is crucial for individuals to stay up-to-date on the latest news and trends in order to remain competitive. This holds true for both business professionals and everyday consumers. With so many sources of information available, it can be challenging to sift through all the noise and find the most relevant and reliable updates. Fortunately, there are a variety of tools and technologies that make it easier than ever to stay informed on business news.\n1. News Aggregator Apps:\nNews aggregator apps such as Flipboard, SmartNews, Google News, or Apple News gather content from various sources, including traditional news outlets as well as social media platforms. These apps use algorithms to personalize the feed based on your interests, making it easier to access relevant business news quickly. They also offer a “one-stop-shop” experience by providing updates from multiple sources in one place.\n2. Social Media Platforms:\nSocial media has become an essential tool for staying updated on business news. Platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook allow users to follow accounts specific to their industry or interest, making it easy to get real-time updates straight from the source. Users can also join groups related to their field of work where they can engage in discussions and share valuable information.\n3.Summarization Tools:\nWith so much content available online today, reading through lengthy articles or watching long videos may not always be feasible. Summarization tools such as Pocket or Instapaper help solve this problem by cur ating and summarizing articles, saving you time and effort. These tools also allow users to save important articles for later reading, eliminating the fear of missing out on noteworthy information.\n4. Business News Websites and Apps:\nMany traditional news outlets, such as The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, or Reuters offer websites and apps specifically dedicated to business news. These platforms provide comprehensive coverage of the latest industry developments, market trends, and expert analysis. Additionally, they often offer notifications or newsletters to keep users updated on breaking news.\n5. Podcasts:\nPodcasts have gained immense popularity in recent years due to its convenience and ability to cater to multitasking needs. Many industry experts host podcasts that cover relevant business topics ranging from finance and economics to marketing and leadership. Users can listen to these podcasts while commuting or doing other tasks—making it a hands-free way to stay updated.\n6. Newsletters:\nNewsletters are an excellent way to receive curated content straight to your inbox from trusted sources. Many news publications or blogs offer daily or weekly newsletters tailored specifically for business professionals. By subscribing to these newsletters, you can get the latest updates and insights delivered straight to your inbox without having to search for them actively.\nExamples of Companies That Have Made Headlines in the News\nStaying informed about business news is more important now than ever before. In today’s fast-paced world, every decision made by a company can have a lasting impact on its customers, employees, and the global market. This is why it’s crucial for individuals to stay updated on the latest business developments and the companies that are making headlines.\nIn this section, we will take a closer look at some notable companies that have recently grabbed attention in the news due to their actions or decisions.\n1. Tesla:\nTesla, headed by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has been making waves in recent years with its innovative electric cars and renewable energy solutions. The company has been constantly making headlines for its ambitious goals of creating a sustainable future and disrupting the automobile industry. However, Tesla’s controversial CEO and his erratic behavior have also been raising concerns among investors and industry experts.\n2. Facebook:\nFacebook has become one of the biggest names in technology over the past decade but not without facing scrutiny from media outlets worldwide. From data privacy scandals to accusations of spreading fake news and misinformation, Facebook has been at the center of numerous controversies in recent years. These incidents serve as reminders of how powerful social media platforms can be in shaping public discourse and highlight the importance of responsible corporate governance.\n3. Amazon:\nAmazon is known for its dominance in e-commerce as well as its rapidly expanding presence in other markets such as cloud computing and brick-and-mortar retail stores. However, the company has faced criticism from both consumers and employees over issues like worker exploitation, tax avoidance, and questionable business practices. This has led to increased scrutiny of Amazon’s operations and the company’s impact on the economy and society.\n4. Uber:\nAs a leading ride-hailing company, Uber has disrupted the transportation industry with its technology-driven business model. However, Uber’s path to success has been riddled with controversies surrounding its workplace culture, safety standards, and legal battles over worker classification. These issues have raised questions about the gig economy and sparked debates on the responsibility of companies towards their employees in this new era of work.\n5. TikTok:\nTikTok is a popular short video sharing platform owned by Chinese company ByteDance. The app has gained widespread popularity among Gen Z users but has faced scrutiny from governments around the world due to concerns over data privacy and censorship. These controversies have threatened TikTok’s global expansion plans and have highlighted the challenges that multinational companies face when operating in different political landscapes.\nAnalyzing and Interpreting Business News: Tips and Tricks\nAnalyzing and interpreting business news is an essential skill for anyone looking to stay informed about the current state of the economy and how it may affect their personal or professional interests. With so much information available, it can be overwhelming to try and make sense of all the news articles, reports, and data that are constantly being published. However, with some helpful tips and tricks, you can become more efficient at analyzing business news and gaining valuable insights from it.\n1. Start with Reliable Sources: One of the first steps in analyzing business news is to make sure you are getting your information from trusted sources. This includes reputable newspapers, financial websites, and industry publications. Avoid relying on social media or blogs for your primary source of business news as they may not always provide accurate or unbiased information.\n2. Understand the Context: It’s important to understand the context of a particular piece of business news before jumping into any analysis. This means knowing what has happened in the past, who is involved, and what potential implications this news may have for different stakeholders. Take some time to research related events or developments before forming an opinion.\n3. Identify Key Players: Business news often involves various players such as companies, industries, political figures, or economic factors. To fully comprehend a particular story, it’s crucial to identify all the key players involved and how they relate to one another.\n4. Look Beyond Headlines: While headlines can grab our attention quickly, they often don’t tell us everything we need to know about a particular news item. It’s important to read the entire article and look for supporting data or quotes from experts to get a more comprehensive understanding of the story.\n5. Analyze Financial Data: Many business news articles include financial data such as stock prices, earnings reports, or economic indicators. Take the time to examine these figures and use them to form your own conclusions about the state of a company or industry.\n6. Consider Multiple Perspectives: Business news can be subjective, and different sources may provide varying perspectives on the same story. Make sure to read and compare different viewpoints to get a well-rounded understanding of the topic at hand.\n7. Look at Long-term Trends: While it’s essential to stay current with breaking business news, it’s also crucial to consider long-term trends in the economy and specific industries. This will help you gain a broader perspective on how current events fit into the bigger picture.\n8. Seek Expert Opinions: When trying to make sense of complex business news, it can be helpful to seek out expert opinions from analysts, economists, or industry insiders. This can provide valuable insights that you may not have considered otherwise.\nConnecting with Other Professionals Through Business News Discussions\nIn today’s fast-paced business world, staying informed and up-to-date on the latest news and trends is crucial for success. But it’s not just about keeping yourself in-the-know – connecting with other professionals through business news discussions can also be extremely beneficial.\nOne of the greatest advantages of participating in business news discussions is the opportunity to expand your network. By engaging with others who are also interested in or knowledgeable about certain topics, you have the chance to build meaningful connections and potentially form mutually beneficial relationships. These new connections can open doors to future collaborations, career opportunities, and provide valuable insights and perspectives.\nAdditionally, discussing current business news with other professionals allows for a deeper understanding of complex issues and developments. While reading articles or watching news segments alone can provide some level of understanding, talking about these topics with others can bring different viewpoints and expertise to the table. This collaborative learning process can lead to more well-rounded insights, helping you make more informed decisions for your own business or career.\nFurthermore, participating in business news discussions helps you stay on top of industry\ntrends and changes that could impact your work or industry. In a constantly evolving business landscape, this knowledge is essential for staying competitive and adapting to new challenges. Engaging in conversations with other professionals allows for a broader perspective on emerging trends and potential disruptions that may affect your field. This awareness enables you to be proactive rather than reactive in making necessary adjustments within your organization.\nConclusion\nAs we have seen, staying informed about business news and current events is crucial for both professionals and individuals. It not only keeps us updated on the latest developments in the dynamic world of business but also allows us to make better decisions, whether it’s regarding our career or personal investments. With easy access to information through various sources, there is no excuse not to stay informed and use knowledge as a powerful tool for success in today’s fast-paced business landscape. So keep yourself updated and embrace the power of knowledge!",

    "title": "OpenAI planea crear un navegador web con IA para competir con Google",
    "text": "Cerrar ventana emergente Semana de malas noticias para Google . Si el miércoles supo que el Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos quiere obligarla a vender el negocio de Chrome para acabar con su monopolio , el jueves se filtró que OpenAI , su rival y fabricante de ChatGPT , estudia la posibilidad de desarrollar un navegador web propio para desbancarla.\nSegún publica The Information, la start-up de inteligencia artificial financiada por Microsoft se plantea crear un producto de navegación por Internet que combinaría con su chatbot, si bien esa posibilidad está aún lejos de materializarse.\nCon este movimiento, OpenAI podría tratar de plantar cara a Google. Chrome es el navegador más popular del mundo, pues concentra un 67% de ese mercado, según datos de Statcounter , muy por delante de rivales como Safari , Edge o Firefox . Competir con Google es una misión titánica, pero eso podría cambiar si la justicia estadounidense termina obligando a la compañía a desprenderse de su navegador.\nEstados Unidos pide obligar a Google a vender Chrome para romper su monopolio de las búsquedas en Internet\nAmbas noticias han hecho que la capitalización de Google se resienta en bolsa . En las últimas 24 horas, sus acciones se han devaluado un 4,56%.\nBuscador contra Google No es la primera vez que OpenAI reta a Google. A finales de julio, la empresa capitaneada por Sam Altman anunció el lanzamiento de SearchGPT , el prototipo de un motor de búsqueda que se sirve de IA para dar respuesta a las consultas de los usuarios. Un año antes, Microsoft integró esa tecnología en su buscador Bing y en su navegador Edge a través de Copilot , un asistente conversacional que acompaña al usuario durante la navegación web.\nChatGPT: un año del asombro que propulsó el desenfreno capitalista de la inteligencia artificial\nEl dominio de Google en ese campo es aún más abrumador, pues su servicio concentra casi el 90% del mercado mundial de las búsquedas web . Aun así, las maniobras de Microsoft y OpenAI han obligado a Google a mover ficha. A finales de 2023, el gigante tecnológico dirigido por Sundar Pichai lanzó su propio modelo de IA, Gemini , y lo integró a sus servicios para tratar de mejorar las búsquedas y neutralizar a sus rivales.\nOpenAI también está buscando otras fórmulas para ganar terreno a Google. Según The Information, la firma está estudiando la posibilidad de potenciar las funciones de IA en los móviles y tabletas fabricados por la surcoreana Samsung , tradicional socio comercial de Google. En junio, la creadora de ChatGPT anunció una nueva alianza para alimentar los dispositivos de Apple , que cobra unos 12.000 millones de dólares anuales de Google para que su navegador y su buscador estén instalados por defecto.",

    "title": "Samsung cambia de opinión: malas noticias para One UI 7 y Android 15",
    "text": "One UI 7 y Android 15 vuelven a estar en el punto de mira. Y no especialmente con buenas noticias bajo el brazo. Hoy nos hemos levantado con una filtración algo amarga para los usuarios de móviles Samsung : una persona afín al ecosistema de la compañía ha revelado la hoja de ruta que podría seguir la coreana hasta lanzar las versiones estables del software. Lamentablemente, la larga espera que avecinó otra fuente hace unos días se va haciendo realidad.\nMientras que gran parte de los fabricantes ya están actualizando a Android 15 , Samsung sigue estancada en un punto complicado. La compañía no está cumpliendo con su estrategia rápida y efectiva de otros años, y la hoja de ruta filtrada vuelve a poner el dedo sobre la herida. Si la fuente citada tiene razón, la espera para recibir One UI 7 en tu móvil Samsung podría ir hasta febrero de 2025 .\nEsto es lo que dice la supuesta hoja de ruta filtrada sobre One UI 7 y Android 15 en los móviles Samsung.\nGalaxy S24: la primera semana de diciembre empieza la fase beta de One UI 7 para toda la serie. Galaxy S23: entre dos y tres semanas después, la serie completa puede acceder a la beta. Galaxy S22: la serie podría tener acceso a la beta nada más empezar el año. Galaxy S21: toda la serie se quedaría sin acceso a la fase beta de One UI 7. Además, la fuente añade que el programa beta de One UI 7 y Android 15 durará 2 meses , por lo que no se debe esperar una versión estable y oficial hasta bien entrado el mes de febrero.\nA One UI 7 le queda un largo camino por delante Esta hoja de ruta cuadra bastante bien con lo que filtró Ice Universe hace unos días. Según él, One UI 7 está lleno de fallos importantes que Samsung no ha tenido tiempo de corregir, y con los que los usuarios de la fase beta tendrán que convivir. Por lo tanto, no solo se espera que esta prueba sea larga, también podría ser bastante tediosa.\nY, como siempre ocurre cuando hay muchos fallos de por medio, los retrasos están a la orden del día. Por supuesto, también cabe la posibilidad de que One UI 7 se lance con ciertos problemas generales o menos funciones de lo esperado.\nPor el momento, hay que esperar unos 15 días para entrar en la primera semana de diciembre y comprobar la veracidad de esta filtración. Eso sí, viendo que a día de hoy Samsung todavía no ha movido ficha con One UI 7, parece bastante probable que debas esperar pacientemente la actualización estable y oficial .",
