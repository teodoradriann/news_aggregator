    "text": "Hands-on approach at Sculpture by the Sea in Cottesloe helps Aboriginal artist's trees grow By Courtney Withers Posted 5h ago 5 hours ago Thu 14 Mar 2024 at 10:15pm Loading YouTube content abc.net.au/news/sculpture-by-the-sea-cottesloe-beach-balga-boola-bigsmob-balga/103585588\nLink copied\nShare Share article\nIn short: Noongar artist Sharyn Egan’s participatory artwork is on display at this year’s Sculpture by the Sea event at Cottesloe Beach. It’s the largest interactive piece in the exhibition’s history, calling on the public to learn weaving techniques to create and add different sections to her sculpture of Balga trees. What's next? The artist’s piece is progressive, meaning it grows in size as the exhibition goes on. Walking along Cottesloe Beach at the annual Sculpture by the Sea exhibition in Perth is an event many have marked in their calendars.\nLining one of WA's most picturesque beaches are 71 weird and wacky sculptures from 14 countries across the world.\nNormally, an estimated 250,000 people flock to admire the pieces from afar, but this year, they're being asked to take part.\n'Appreciating the beauty' Noongar artist Sharyn Egan has returned to Sculpture by the Sea in Cottesloe, now in its 20th year, with a new kind of artwork.\nThe 67-year-old artist was named the 2024 Tourism WA Invited Aboriginal Artist and has brought with her a major piece of public participatory art.\nSharyn Egan says her sculpture started with seven trees and now there are more than 15. ( ABC News: Courtney Withers )\n\"People are really, really into it and this is quite contemporary,\" Ms Egan said.\n\"They're loving it and really loving being part of it and taking photos of their Balga leaves once they're on the sculpture.\"\nHer sculpture, titled Balga Boola – Bigsmob Balga, grows throughout the duration of the exhibition into a blossoming field of Balga trees.\nThe sculpture is formed through daily workshops. ( ABC News: Courtney Withers )\nFor Ms Egan, focusing her sculpture on Balga trees, the Noongar name for grass trees, was a no-brainer.\n\"It's important to me because it's a plant that grows only in Noongar country and the uses are amazing,\" she said.\n\"It's a Swiss Army knife of the bush.\"\nEach woven Balga tree frond is collected through a series of daily workshops with the public, teaching traditional Aboriginal weaving techniques, and is then added to her sculpture.\nMs Egan says Balga trees are the Swiss Army knife of the bush. ( ABC News: Courtney Withers )\n\"I just wanted to share a bit of knowledge with the public so people can appreciate the beauty of them as well — they're just architecturally amazing,\" she said.\nLargest participatory art piece Sculpture by the Sea Founding CEO and artistic director David Handley said Ms Egan's sculpture was \"by far the largest public interactive piece\" in the exhibition's history.\nHe said the exhibition has had interactive elements before, although this interactive element was the biggest and has continued throughout the whole exhibition.\nDavid Handley loves seeing the public embrace the sculpture and its techniques. ( ABC News: Courtney Withers )\n\"It's a wonderful thing to do in so many ways,\" Mr Handley said.\n\"On one hand, it's fun and members of the public are meeting an artist, but on the other hand, this is an artwork that is really important to Sharyn in terms of the Balga tree and its importance for the Noongar people.\"\nHe said the exhibition always encouraged this type of interaction between the artist and the public, but this piece was \"on a whole new scale\".\nSharing good feelings Attendees this year have been pretty pleased to see their new skills on display as Ms Egan's sculpture grows in size.\nIt has also given people an opportunity to learn and embrace culture through art.\nWorkshop attendees Lee Manning (left) and Mal Dunn (right) enjoying the workshop by the beach. ( ABC News: Courtney Withers )\nWorkshop attendee Lee Manning said it was \"lovely to share this with Sharyn\" and learn more about her craft.\n\"When I was growing up, these were called a name we don't say anymore,\" she said.\n\"Of course now we've been enlightened, I'm happy to embrace what they really are — they are a Balga tree.\"\nAnother attendee, Mal Dunn, also enjoyed her time.\n\"I'm not a very crafty person, but this has been really fun. It's very engaging,\" she said.\nMs Egan loves seeing people pointing out their fronds in her sculpture. ( ABC News: Courtney Withers )\nMs Egan said her piece was growing by the day and it was thanks to people who sat with her.\n\"It's just such a nice sharing feel-good feeling,\" she said.\n\"People are just so happy with simple techniques, and stories, and they have a sense of belonging being part of it.\"\nLoading Posted 5h ago 5 hours ago Thu 14 Mar 2024 at 10:15pm Share\nCopy link\nFacebook\nX (formerly Twitter)\nRelated Stories Luminous glass artworks bring troubling histories into the light Underwater sculptures colonised by marine life in diving paradise off Busselton Jetty Art exhibition links apartheid with colonial Australia in Perth show More on: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Art Cottesloe Indigenous (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Indigenous Culture Installation Art Perth Sculpture Visual Art Top Stories Australia to resume funding to UN Palestinian aid agency UNRWA Laura wasn't told her operation could cause infertility.

    "title": "IG Metall Says Warning Strikes Of Volkswagen Workers Could Begin Next Week: Reports",
    "text": "IG Metall Says Warning Strikes Of Volkswagen Workers Could Begin Next Week: Reports\n(RTTNews) - Germany's largest union IG Metall has reportedly said Volkswagen AG workers across Germany could begin warning strikes after November 30, which is the last date of an agreement or so-called \"peace obligation\" to not stage strikes. The warning strikes normally last from a few hours up to a day.\nThis move comes after the third collective bargaining negotiations between the union and the carmaker failed to bring about a solution last week. It would mark the first large-scale walkouts at the company's domestic operations since 2018. The next collective bargaining talks are scheduled for December 9 over a new labor agreement.\nThe negotiations were over proposed drastic cost-cutting measures, including a 10 percent cut in wages and cutting of benefits, amid intensifying competition from Chinese rivals, slowing demand for electric vehicles (EVs), and the slowing German economy.\nOne of the solutions reportedly suggested by the union for cutting labor costs is for upper management to forfeit their bonuses. The collective bargaining agreement covers around 120,000 of VW's 300,000 staff in Germany.\nIn late October, Volkswagen announced plans to close at least three factories in Germany, lay off thousands of workers and cut pay by 10 percent of the remaining workers. Volkswagen operates 10 plants and employs around 300,000 people across Germany. This would mark the first time the company has closed domestic plants in its 87-year history.\nUS automaker Ford is also facing a backlash from IG Metall union for its plans to cut thousands of jobs amid restructuring of its production site in Cologne, Germany. On November 20, Ford announced it would cut about 14 percent of its European workforce. In January 2023 also Ford announced plans to cut 3,200 jobs in Europe, mainly in Germany.\nIG Metall is Germany's largest union, representing over 2 million workers in the metals and manufacturing industries, largely in the automotive branch. It also represents workers in the renewables sector involved producing wind turbines and solar panels.",

    "text": "El verano ha comenzado en Alicante con uno de sus inicios más calurosos que se recuerdan, con jornadas cercanas a los 40 grados y una ola de calor de por medio que han segado la vida de 24 personas.\nEl potente sol que ilumina la provincia es un arma de doble filo que ha dejado el mayor rastro de víctimas de los últimos años en un inicio de verano por golpes de calor y complicaciones asociadas.\nCon más de dos víctimas por exceso de temperaturas desde que el verano comenzara oficialmente el pasado 21 de junio, 2025 apunta a ser el verano más oscuro en cuanto a bajas por temperaturas.\n[Juan, 45 años y albañil, alto y claro sobre el calor en Alicante: \"Hay ratos en los que siento que me voy a desmayar\"] El análisis de los datos de mortalidad por calor en Alicante, extraídos del Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), revela una tendencia preocupante c on tan solo dos semanas de verano tachadas en el calendario.\nEn comparación con Valencia o Castellón, Alicante es la peor parada, pues la capital valenciana no ha registrado ningún fallecimiento y Castellón tan solo lo ha tenido tres casos este verano.\nLa comparativa con cursos pasados muestra que el aumento en los termómetros se traduce directamente en un mayor número de víctimas mortales.\nEl asfixiante clima extremo de la provincia ha dejado ya 24 muertes (27 desde abril) hasta el 1 de julio, último día registrado, lo que equivale a una media de más de dos fallecidos diarios (2,18) .\nSe trata del mayor número de muertes asociadas a las altas temperaturas en este mismo periodo en los últimos años y triplica las cifras de años anteriores.\nEn el mismo tramo de 2024 —del 21 de junio al 1 de julio— solo se registraron tres muertes por causas atribuibles al calor, o lo que es lo mismo, una muerte cada cuatro día s. Esto implica un aumento del 700 % en 2025.\nAsí, el pasado año se contabilizaron más de 200 muertes por altas temperaturas durante todo el año, siendo agosto el mes más crítico, con hasta 140 , más de 4,5 muertes al día de media. Este curso preocupa la posibilidad de superar esa cifra y elevar el número hasta los 200 muertos en agosto.\nEn 2023, la cifra fue ligeramente mayor, con ocho víctimas en el periodo mencionado y con una tasa de 0,73 muertes/día , pero, aun así, el verano actual refleja un incremento del 200 % respecto a ese año. De hecho, el número absoluto de muertes se ha multiplicado por tres.\nRetrocediendo a 2022, las víctimas también fueron ocho para estas alturas, muy lejos de las preocupantes cifras del presente curso.\n¿Pero cómo estaba la mortalidad por exceso de temperaturas hace una década?\nEl ISCIII registra como datos más antiguos los del curso 2015, por lo que se pueden contrastar los datos con una década de diferencia para comprobar cómo ha variado el número de víctimas.\nSi nos remontamos a 2015, el verano dejó 13 muertes por calor en ese mismo tramo del calendario y 1,18 muertes diarias. En 2025, la cifra casi se ha duplicado respecto a entonces, con un aumento del 85 %.",

Under collective agreements, staff members at the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board who are to be laid off must be notified before the end of March, ahead of the regular budget debate. Last week, facing a $20-million deficit, trustees reluctantly approved cutting about 150 positions, including about 80 non-academic positions to save $7.08 million and about 70 staff in discretionary academic positions to save $8.823 million. Some of the reductions will come through attrition, including retirements and resignations, not filling vacant positions and eliminating other positions.\nAdvertisement 2 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY Subscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.

A few reporters shared videos to social media of Chase doing some light drills.\nChase has been seeking a new contract from Cincinnati and reportedly has threatened not to play in Week 1 unless he gets a new deal.\nBurrow, who is entering his fifth season as the Bengals’ quarterback, shared a positive review concerning Chase.\n“He’s ready to go. Saw him out there today, he looks fast, strong like he always does. Confident if he does go out there Sunday he will be the Ja’Marr we all know,” Burrow said of Chase Wednesday, via Paul Dehner Jr .\nThe Bengals open up the 2024 season on Sunday against the New England Patriots. Cincinnati went 9-8 last season and missed the playoffs as Burrow was limited to 10 games. They will need both Burrow and Chase healthy and playing if they want to replicate the success they had in 2021 and 2022 when they won the AFC North and advanced to at least the conference championship game.\nThe post Joe Burrow shares positive update on teammate Ja’Marr Chase appeared first on Larry Brown Sports .",

    "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has dismissed excuses by some state chapters refusing to join the planned nationwide strike, asserting that the welfare of workers must remain paramount. Speaking to Punch, the NLC National Treasurer, Akeem Ambali, revealed that the union had mobilised its affiliate unions across the country, instructing their leadership to prepare members in states yet to implement the new N70,000 minimum wage for industrial action.\nAmbali condemned states that had only made verbal commitments without formal agreements or concrete implementation plans.\nHe said, “Labour will embark on strike by midnight of the 30th of this month (November); we have mobilsed for that. We have directed the leadership of all affiliates to mobilise their members for the strike.\n“Even states that only made pronouncements without signing an agreement with labour and have yet to implement the new minimum wage will also experience the strike because we know some of them only made statements.\n“They never paid the new minimum wage. Making a pronouncement without negotiation is not known to labour law; even making a pronouncement without cash backing is not acceptable to labour.\n“Those who have only made empty promises and those who are saying they will start paying by January 2025 will incur the wrath of labour. This is not acceptable to us. There will be a strike in these states by 30th midnight.\n“We are very serious about this. We have had all the organs meeting, and the issue has been decided; there is no going back.”\nThe NLC’s Head of Protocol and Public Relations, Benson Upah, said no amount of persuasion or partial compliance would prevent the industrial action, insisting that only full implementation would avert the looming strike.",
