    "text": "Gustavo Otsuka, chefe de delegação da natação brasileira, sofreu um acidente no banheiro da\nVila Olímpica. Nesta quinta-feira, 25, o dirigente não deixou de acompanhar os treinos dos nadadores brasileiros, mas chegou na arena caminhando com dificuldades, com auxílio de muletas.\nO chefe relatou que o acidente aconteceu enquanto tomava banho. No momento em que ia deixar o box, Gustavo escorregou e caiu sentado. Porém, o piso do banheiro da Vila Olímpica é feito de louça e, dessa forma, teve cortes nas cotas, o que o levou a tomar 15 pontos no local.\nAinda nas dependências da Vila Olímpica, o chefe da natação brasileira afirmou que foi amparado pela equipe médica do COB. “Deram uma assistência super-rápida, total, integral, com tudo que havia de aparato médico importante e necessário para atender o meu caso. Estou me recuperando. Se Deus quiser, até o começo da natação, eu vou estar bem para poder ajudar o Brasil na sua performance”, disse Otsuka.\n*Matéria originalmente publicada em\nSportbuzz",

    "text": "【大纪元2025年07月03日讯】(大纪元记者天睿澳洲悉尼编译报导）悉尼科技大学（UTS）被曝光即将裁掉400名员工，调查发现大约35%的受访者正承受很大的心理压力。\n据澳洲广播公司报导，悉尼科技大学正在进行一项名为“运营可持续发展计划（OSI）”的1亿澳元重组计划，该校将斥资500万澳元，聘请毕马威（KPMG）作为顾问，为这一重组计划提供建议。\n校方发言人表示：“我们必须削减支出，因为我们的收入无法覆盖日常运营成本。2024年的收入为13亿澳元，而支出为14亿澳元。我们无法继续承担这样的亏损，而是需要持续降低开支，以保障核心教学与科研工作。”\n在一次员工大会上，校方估计，“运营可持续发展计划”将导致400个职位被裁撤，部分课程可能取消。\n新州安全工作局（SafeWork NSW）目前正在就此次重组可能对员工心理健康造成的伤害展开调查。据悉，全国高校教师工会（NTEU）已计划向监管机构提交员工调查。\n有匿名的员工表示，大家都很害怕。很多人不敢公开讨论这些事，也不敢提问。\n校方表示，已知晓在咨询期员工面临的相关心理风险，正全面配合新州安全工作局的调查。\n工会全国主席巴恩斯博士（Dr Alison Barnes）表示，大量员工正面临生计危机。\n“这些短视的裁员决定，正在严重打击悉尼科技大学员工的身心健康，其根本原因是校方在整个计划过程中严重缺乏人性化和正当的征询机制。”\n“关于变革可能带来的风险评估，也几乎没有任何透明度，这正是职业安全监察机构目前正在调查的问题之一。”\n调查还发现，60%的学术人员表示无法在带薪时间内完成本职工作。\n悉尼科技大学并非唯一近期裁员的高校，过去12个月，澳洲多所大学相继宣布裁员。例如，西悉尼大学计划今年晚些时候裁员300至400人；堪培拉大学已裁员200人；卧龙岗大学计划裁员275人。\n责任编辑：宗敏青\n了解更多澳洲即时要闻及生活资讯，请点击 dajiyuan.com.au\n（本文未经许可不得转载或建立镜像网站）",

    "text": "The Wrap Hilary Swank Says Les Moonves Dismissing Her as ‘Too Half-Hour’ for CBS Drama Freed Her Schedule for ‘Boys Don’t Cry’ Read full article Francie Ebert 1 March 2024 at 12:43 am · 2-min read\nEverything happens for a reason. For two-time Oscar winner and “Ordinary Angels” star Hilary Swank, former CBS chairman and CEO Les Moonves dissing her as “too half-hour” to star in one of his network dramas ultimately led her to one of the biggest successes of her career, “Boys Don’t Cry.”\nInterviewing with actor Rob Lowe on his “Literally!” podcast, the actress recalled the early-career encounter, with longtime friend Lowe admitting that it was one of his “favorite Hilary memories.”\nAs the story goes, Swank had been auditioning for a dramatic role on an hour-long CBS pilot, and when it was between her and one other actress, Moonves dismissed her and chose to cast the other contender.\n“He said, yeah, ‘You’re just too half-hour.’ Not even funny,” Swank recalled. “He didn’t even say I was funny or comedic. I was too half hour.”\nLowe described it as being labelled “too multi-camera” — a sitcom actress.\nBut if it hadn’t been for this rejection, Lowe and Swank said, there would not have been the redirection that led to her starring in “Boys Don’t Cry,” the independent feature that won her her first Academy Award.\n“I love that you even remember who it was,” Swank said.\n“At that time the most powerful man in the business [was Moonves],” Lowe said. “And only because you didn’t get that pilot or that show –“\n“I was able to do ‘Boys Don’t Cry,'” Swank said, finishing his sentence.\n“Boys Dont Cry” was the 1999 film where she portrayed a young trans man. While she only made $75 per day on that month-long shoot, she went on to receive multiple awards and nominations for her acting in the film, including a Golden Globe for Best Actress and the Oscar.\n“The reason I bring this up is because I think it’s super important for everybody in their lives who feel like maybe something didn’t go their way, particularly young actors,” Lowe said, adding, “It really is the concrete evidence of when a door closes or doesn’t even open, another one does.”\nStory continues “It’s so true and it’s so hard to trust that, right? Because like you said, there’s no ‘for sure.’ But I think if you just remain open, you keep that energy open,” Swank said. “Feel it, don’t go, oh, something better is happening — I felt it. I was like, this really sucks. And then I felt it, and then I moved on.”\nListen to Swank’s full interview on “SiriusXM’s Literally!

It would have been easier to tell if it had been on the ground.\"\nAfter that it was an Arsenal blitz with\nBukayo Saka crashing the ball against the post and Gabriel Jesus missing two good opportunities before Mavropanos scored with a thumping header from a James Ward-Prowse corner in the 55th.\nWest Ham could have made it three from three chances but\nSaid Benrahma had a penalty saved in added time after a foul by former West Ham captain Declan Rice.\nThe defeat raises familiar questions about Arsenal's title credentials. They led the league this time last year only to falter in the run in and be overtaken by Manchester City.\nIt may have been one of those nights when things just did not happen in front of goal but finishing remains an issue.\nAs well as striking the post, Saka also had a near point-blank header stopped by Alphonse Areola, who made a string of fine saves in the second half too.\nJesus should have a scored when Arsenal were still one goal behind but headed over an open goal while fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli also missed good opportunities.\nThe win leaves West Ham in sixth place on 33 points and marked a landmark night for their manager David Moyes who had never won at Arsenal in the league in 22 attempts.\nSecond-placed Arsenal remain on 40 points, two behind\nLiverpool who beat Burnley 2-0 on Tuesday.\nGame Information\n- Referees:\n- Michael Oliver\nEnglish Premier League Standings\n|Team\n|GP\n|W\n|D\n|L\n|GD\n|P\nhttps://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/359/arsenal Aston Villa Manchester City Tottenham Hotspur https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/371/west-ham-united Manchester United Brighton & Hove Albion Newcastle United Chelsea Wolverhampton Wanderers AFC Bournemouth Fulham Brentford Crystal Palace Nottingham Forest Everton Luton Town https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/379/burnley Sheffield United\nPremier League News\nArsenal are interested in signing Bayern Munich centre-back Matthijs de Ligt, but it may not happen until the summer.

    "text": "Museveni offers to help Sudan factions end war What you need to know: - The President reportedly promised to work towards efforts aimed at achieving peace and stability in Sudan. President Museveni has offered to support peace talks between the warring parties in Sudan to put an end to the civil war that broke out on April 15, claiming about 10,000 lives and injuring more than 12,000 people. This was revealed by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the leader of Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, on Wednesday, shortly after meeting Mr Museveni at his country home in Rwakitura, Kiruhura District. Two armed forces, one led by Gen Dagalo and another by the army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, also the chairman of the Transitional Sovereign Council, have been fighting for close to eight months. The former attempted to overthrow the latter with whom they seized power together from the former president al-Bashir through a coup in 2021. Gen Dagalo said in the statement that President Museveni tasked him to explain the genesis of the war, which he did. “I provided His Excellency President Museveni with a detailed explanation about the reasons for the outbreak of the war, which was ignited by the remnants with the help of their leaders in the armed forces and the parties that obstruct the solution and support the continuation of the war,” reads part of the statement. Gen Dagalo said Mr Museveni affirmed his full support to the people of Sudan and promised to work towards advancing efforts aimed at achieving peace and stability. “He said he will harness all his capabilities and relationships to help the Sudanese people overcome this difficult stage in their history,” Gen Dagalo added. A few minutes after Mr Museveni confirmed his meeting with Gen Dagalo via his X-platform, the State House released a statement where it explained that the two leaders discussed numerous issues, including bilateral ties and most importantly, putting an end to the war among them. Neither Gen Dagalo nor State House explained whether the President’s intended support towards peace talks is being done under the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad) where the two countries are members. When asked, the deputy presidential press secretary, Mr Faruk Kirunda, said: “None of us attended the meeting. We were just briefed on what took place, which we have released in the statement.” Both the State Minister for Regional Corporation, Mr John Mulimba, and his ICT and Information counterpart, Dr Chris Baryomunsi, who is the official government spokesperson, were unavailable for comment as their known phone contacts were off by press time. This particular meeting came barely two months after Mr Museveni met Gen al-Burhan on September 16 in another closed-door meeting at State House Entebbe where only deliberations on bilateral and regional issues were brought to light that day. Dagalo skips peace talks The two warring leaders were yesterday expected to meet in Djibouti for the first face-to-face peace talks but Gen Dagalo did not appear, prompting Djibouti, which currently holds the Igad mantle, to postpone the meeting to early January. Without giving exact dates, Djibouti’s ministry of foreign affairs in a letter to its member states, said the meeting [between Gen Dagalo and al-Burhan that had been] re-scheduled for “December 28 [yesterday] has been postponed to early January 2024 for technical reasons,” Gen Dagalo had on Wednesday reaffirmed that: “We still adhere to the outcomes of the Igad Presidents’ Summit held in Djibouti, and we will continue to implement what we committed to end the war, relieve the suffering of our people, and restore security and stability to our country.” He further said he got a letter from the former Sudan prime minister, who is also the leader of the Coordination of Civil Democratic Forces (CCDF), calling them to an urgent meeting to discuss strategies to end the war and address its impacts. “With a sense of urgency and responsibility, I embrace the prospect of holding this critical meeting as soon as possible. We will immediately begin to discuss the meeting arrangements. We welcome all national initiatives aimed at fostering peace and reducing the hardships resulting from this war,” Gen Dagalo said. His failure to appear in Djibouti due to technical issues was, however, dismissed by RSF adviser Yousif Izzat, who told the Voice of America (VOA) News that the ministry’s claim was simply “fake news,” but did not as well explain his boss’s failure to appear. The VOA in the same report said an anonymous source familiar with the matter had informed them that the meeting’s postponement was because of “disagreements” between the two parties, but the source did not give further details. The two leaders have for several months been placed under pressure by the international community to work towards ending the war.",
