Almost a full day of rain is likely for parts of New Zealand today and tonight, with some areas of the North Island already drenched. Hikers, campers and New Year’s Eve revellers are being warned to take care as thunderstorms, slips and flooding - including flooded rivers - are possible in the worst-hit areas. A warm, moist northwesterly flow is bring rain or showers to all parts of the country, with thunderstorms possible in northern and western parts of both islands and the deep south. Rain has also been bucketing down in Auckland since lunchtime. [Weather watches and warnings](https://www.metservice.com/warnings/home) have been in place since last night through till tomorrow, running from Waikato and Bay of Plenty down to Fiordland. Between 100-160mm of rain is possible in some warning areas. Forecaster Weatherwatch.co.nz said today would be marked by drizzle, dry spells and sudden downpours bringing a risk of localised flooding. The west of the South Island is bearing the brunt of the bad weather, along with Taranaki, which has been hit by torrential rain since this morning. A heavy rain warning is in place in the area through till 1am with a peak of 15-25 mm/h expected until mid-afternoon today. Westland is under a 21-hour heavy rain warning until 6am Saturday, with 100-140 mm of rain expected over that time and peak rates of 20-30mm/h. Nelson has a heavy rain warning until 7pm tonight with up to 90mm of rain in total. Heavy rain watches lasting 22 hours are in place for Buller, Waikato, Waitomo, Taumarunui, Taupō, Tongariro National Park and the Kaimanawa Mountains, while Fiordland’s watch lasts for 20 hours. Rainfall amounts could reach warning criteria in all those areas, with thunderstorms also possible in many areas. Heavy rain means streams and rivers can rise rapidly and driving conditions may be hazardous, with possible surface flooding and slips. Thunderstorms are also possible in many areas, bringing intense localised downpours, according to MetService. The national forecaster’s meteorologist John Law said those thinking of going camping should keep an eye on the forecasts to avoid being stranded by sudden floods or slips. With heavy rain also expected across the Tararua Ranges and the Tongariro Crossing, keen hikers should also take care, Law said. New Year’s Day to bring drier weather The fast-moving weather system should improve by mid-Saturday but another front will bring more rain on Sunday, MetService says. But there’s good news as 2024 dawns - both MetService and private forecaster Weatherwatch expect the weather to clear for New Year’s Day. Weatherwatch head forecaster Philip Duncan said a big block of high pressure coming in from the Tasman Sea and Southern Ocean will bring clearing, cooler weather on January 1, with the recent high humidity taking a break.",

    "title": "Chiefs all-time passing leader: Where Patrick Mahomes ranks with Kansas City legend Len Dawson | Sporting News Australia",
    "text": "Patrick Mahomes enters his eighth season with the Chiefs, seeking a historic third consecutive Super Bowl victory on his way to becoming a Kansas City legend. The opening game of the 2024 season provides yet another chance for the quarterback to write his name into the team's history books. Mahomes will start Thursday against Lamar Jackson and the Ravens with only 84 yards between himself and the title of Chiefs all-time leading passer. Who knows how many quarters it will take for the 28-year-old to surpass Len Dawson's record, but it will certainly be a challenge against Baltimore's staunch defense. Mahomes is also within range of passing Dawson for first all-time in passing touchdowns, but he still has 18 scores to go before tying the Hall-of-Famer. Here's everything to know about the Chiefs all-time passing leader, including where Mahomes ranks among Kansas City legends. 2024 NFL RANKINGS: QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | Defense Chiefs all-time passing leaders Dawson has held the Chiefs all-time passing record since his retirement in May 1976. With 28,507 yards in the air across 13 years as the team's starter, the Kansas City great was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987. With fewer than 100 yards remaining, Mahomes is looking to break Dawson's record in five fewer seasons and just over half as many games. Here are the top five passing quarterbacks in Chiefs history, with Dawson and Mahomes sitting comfortably at the top. PREDICTIONS: 2024 NFL season | Why Cowboys will miss playoffs | Why Chiefs will win Super Bowl |Rank||Player||Timeline||Yards| |1||Len Dawson||1962-1975||28,507| |2||Patrick Mahomes||2017-2023||28,424| |3||Trent Green||2001-2006||21,459| |4||Alex Smith||2013-2017||17,608| |5||Bill Kenney||1980-1988||17,277| Patrick Mahomes stats Since the Chiefs drafted Mahomes 10th overall in the 2017 NFL Draft, he has steadily improved into one of the best quarterbacks in the league and is continuing to make his case to be considered one of the greatest ever. He led the league in passing in 2022, the same year he won both NFL and Super Bowl MVP. Additionally, Mahomes already tops the Chiefs record books in completions (2,386), completion percentage (66.5%), and passing yards in a single season with his 5,000-plus-yard performance two years ago. Here's a look at Mahomes' career passing statistics with Kansas City. |Year||GS||CMP||ATT||CMP%||YDS||TD||INT| |2017||1||22||35||62.9||284||0||1| |2018||16||383||580||66.0||5,097||50||12| |2019||14||319||484||65.9||4,031||26||5| |2020||15||390||588||66.3||4,740||38||6| |2021||17||436||658||66.3||4,839||37||13| |2022||17||435||648||67.1||5,250||41||12| |2023||16||401||597||67.2||4,183||27||14| WEEK 1 FANTASY PPR RANKINGS: QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers Len Dawson picture, explained Aside from being widely considered one of the most gifted quarterbacks in the history of the NFL, Dawson is also known for something that would wreak havoc in the league today: smoking a cigarette during a game. This wasn't just during any game either. It was the sideline of Super Bowl I, where Dawson was representing the Chiefs. The league's inaugural championship game in January 1967 featured a marquee matchup between Kansas City and the Green Bay Packers, during halftime of which \"LIFE\" magazine photographer Bill Ray captured the quarterback as the picture of tranquility despite being down a touchdown. Super B-Day to Len Dawson. Frescas and heaters for everyone!— Super 70s Sports (@Super70sSports) [pic.twitter.com/mmX8gpIhWM] [June 20, 2016] With a cigarette in his mouth and a bottle of Fresca at his feet, Dawson finished his mid-game break and the Packers proceeded to shut out the Chiefs in the second half, winning the title 35-10. Despite the combination of nicotine and carbonation in his system, the quarterback still managed to complete 16-of-27 passes for 210 yards and one touchdown, only dealing one interception. In fact, he was selected as the Sporting News 1966 AFL All-League player.",

    "text": "Retired police sergeant on vacation with family rescues couple from sinking car CINCINNATI ( [WXIX](https://www.fox19.com/2024/06/21/retired-cpd-sergeant-family-rescue-unknown-tri-state-couple-during-florida-vacation/)/Gray News) - A retired Cincinnati police sergeant and his family saved an Ohio couple who just happened to be vacationing in the same area in Florida. The Ramsey family is from Ohio, while the Bell family lives in northern Kentucky. Up until June 11, the two families had no idea they lived so close to one another. Some might call it a coincidence. Others will say it’s luck, but these two families call it a miracle. Dean and Shana Ramsey recall the moment they said they almost drowned while vacationing in Siesta Key, Florida. Several streets flooded that day after the area received more than 11 inches of rain, an abnormal amount, according to Sarasota County officials. “You couldn’t see anything but rain and water,” Dean Ramsey recalled. With several cars stalled on the road, the couple said they tried to pull off on what they thought was land. “The water sucked us right into that lagoon and that was it,” Dean Ramsey explained. Watching in horror from their condo was retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant Mike Bell, his wife Ginger Bell and their three young kids. The Bell family responded. “We were able to stop, slow things down, and assess and make some decisions on how we were going to move forward,” Mike Bell said. That plan started with Mackenzie Bell giving valuable information to 911. “I remembered they needed to know the address, so that’s the first thing I told her and then I told her a car is in the pond and there was two people in there,” Mike’s and Ginger Bell’s daughter, Mackenzie Bell, said. Meanwhile, the retired sergeant and his wife, who is an emergency medical doctor, took action. “I went over to the edge of the water and realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” Mike Bell recounted from that moment. “At that time, Ginger exited the front door next to the pond. I look at her and said, ‘We need flotation devices.’” That’s where little Hank Bell came in. “I didn’t want them to die, so I ran as fast as I could,” Hank Bell explained. “I went up the elevator, which is extremely slow, and I knew there were stairs that were faster. So, I ran down the stairs.” Flotation devices in hand, the Bell kids handed them to their parents who were already in the water. “He went into the lady’s side and I went into the man’s side,” Ginger Bell said. “She was able to climb out on her own, but I put the boogie board right in front of her. She got her body on the boogie board and that’s when I started paddling and we kicked over to the side.” Ginger Bell ran into some issues helping Dean Ramsey. “When he was trying to get out, his foot got stuck, so he was on his back with one foot out and one foot stuck in the steering wheel,” Ginger Bell remembered. “I looked at her and I said, ‘I’m stuck, I can’t,’” Dean Ramsey remembered. “At that time, I was like, ‘I’m going down with the car,’ but she’s like, ‘Get out of this car! You got to get out! Kick your leg!’ I started thrashing my leg and my foot popped out.” The rescue took about five minutes. Back on dry land, the Ramsey family saw their rescuers as “guardian angels.” The families say they have plans to reunite in the near future. The Bell family wants to remind residents to always be mindful of their surroundings and assess a situation before getting involved. They said if your car is going in a body of water, roll down the windows or punch them out by hitting the corners. Those tactics could save a life. Copyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc.

Eso sí, el combinado de Chile se lo puso difícil en el inicio de este encuentro, agarrado a la efectividad de Erwin Feuchtmann en tiros de proximidad.También convirtió el propio Feuchtmann dos lanzamientos de 7 metros, ante un Sergey Hernández titular y con mayor protagonismo que Gonzalo Pérez de Vargas. Por parte española, Imanol Garciandia era quien mejor interpretaba los planes en ataque, con cortes por delante de ambos centrales chilenos, a veces definiendo él y otras asistiendo al pivote.Los 'Hispanos' neutralizan a Chile para empezar el Mundial - Foto: Beate Oma DahleEsteban Salinas se unió a los peligros de una Chile que aprovechó dos faltas en ataque cometidas por Agustín Casado, como demostraron Rodrigo Aedo al contragolpe para marcar desde el extremo izquierdo y luego Feuchtmann poniendo el 5-8, sin haber transcurrido siquiera 10 minutos.El guardameta Felipe García había contribuido a esa ventaja chilena con un 7 metros parado a Dani Fernández, instancia que repitió más tarde entre arreón y arreón España. Para esa reacción del equipo entrenado por Ribera, el nombre clave había sido Djordje Cikusa, cuya entrada en la cancha asentó la defensa y propulsó la remontada antes del descanso.Con Ian Tarrafeta y Carlos Álvarez como puñales en los costados y al contragolpe, los 'Hispanos' se fueron al intermedio con un 17-13 algo más esperable en la previa de este debut mundialista. Pero hacía falta refrendar esa teórica superioridad ante el conjunto sudamericano, lo que aderezó el arranque de la segunda mitad, con varias sustituciones.Los 'Hispanos' neutralizan a Chile para empezar el Mundial - Foto: Beate Oma DahleLa profundidad de banquillo en España fue un arma que supo exprimir Ribera, especialmente tapando huecos atrás cuando los laterales rivales se cruzaban y propiciando, con ello, muchas transiciones de las que Dani Fernández y Tarrafeta sacaron jugo. Tampoco desentonaron Jan Gurri y Carlos Álvarez mientras las rentas españolas crecían y crecían (26-18).Con tranquilidad en los compases finales, y pese a un 0-3 de parcial en contra después de un tanto de Aedo al contragolpe, España abrochó su primer triunfo en este Mundial reñido. El otro arquero chileno, Vicente González, tuvo cuatro intervenciones de mérito e impidió una distancia más grande en el electrónico del pabellón de la capital noruega. , , , , , , , ,",
