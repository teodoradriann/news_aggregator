    "title": "Soaring Hospital Parking Fees in England Spark Outcry Amidst NHS Funding Concerns | IBTimes UK",
    "text": "Data has emerged indicating a 50 per cent surge in hospital parking fees in England within the span of just one year. The figures, brought to light by the Liberal Democrats, expose the financial burden shouldered by visitors and patients, who collectively paid a staggering £146 million for parking during the 2022/23 fiscal year, equivalent to an alarming £400,000 per day.Comparing these numbers to the preceding year's total of £96.7 million and a threefold increase from two years prior, it is evident that the issue of escalating parking costs is becoming increasingly pressing.A noteworthy aspect of this surge is the more than eight-fold rise in parking fees paid by hospital staff, skyrocketing from £5.6 million in 2021/22 to a staggering £46.7 million in the following fiscal year.The Liberal Democrats swiftly condemned this substantial increase, labelling it a \"tax on caring\". They took aim at the government, accusing it of failing to fulfil a promise made in its 2019 manifesto, which pledged to eliminate unjust charges by providing free parking to those in greatest need. This failure to act on the manifesto commitment has fueled frustration and raised questions about the government's commitment to supporting both patients and healthcare workers.The drastic spike in parking charges can be attributed in part to the reintroduction of fees after the COVID-19 pandemic, a move that has left many questioning the timing and necessity of such a decision.Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing's director for England, expressed concern over the impact on nursing staff and support workers, emphasising that the soaring parking costs disproportionately affect those already earning lower wages. She called for a reconsideration of the government and NHS stance, stating that leaving nursing staff out of pocket for simply doing their jobs is unjust.As of March 2022, current NHS guidance outlines specific groups eligible for free parking, including disabled individuals, frequent outpatient attenders, parents of sick children staying overnight and staff working night shifts. Furthermore, NHS Trusts are encouraged to ensure that fees are \"reasonable for the area\" on a voluntary basis.The Health Foundation think tank reported that NHS England 's budget is now £3.5 billion less than the previous year due to high inflation, raising concerns about the sustainability of healthcare services. The Liberal Democrats warned that if local health services are not adequately funded, parking fees are likely to continue surging, placing additional financial strain on patients and staff.Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat health and social care spokesperson, criticized Chancellor Rishi Sunak for reducing NHS funding, particularly when hospitals are already facing considerable challenges. The party has proposed the creation of a \"visiting and caring fund\" in collaboration with NHS trusts to alleviate the burden on patients and staff by lowering parking fees. This fund aims to ensure that individuals visiting their loved ones in hospitals do not face exorbitant costs.In response, a Tory spokesman defended the government's actions, asserting that they have fulfilled their manifesto pledge to end unfair charges for those in greatest need. The spokesman challenged the Liberal Democrats to be transparent about which services they would cut to further subsidise parking.The escalating concerns about NHS funding and parking fees coincide with recent disruptions caused by junior doctor strikes in England. Last week, nearly 88,000 NHS appointments were cancelled, with over 86,300 of them being hospital check-ups and operations.An additional 1,500 community and mental health appointments were also affected, bringing the total number of appointments disrupted since the initiation of strikes a year ago to over 1.2 million.On the other hand, the upcoming six-day walkout by junior doctors, scheduled to commence on January 3rd, marks the longest in the history of the NHS. Talks between the British Medical Association (BMA) and the government broke down earlier this month, leading to this extended industrial action.NHS England's medical director, Prof Sir Stephen Powis, voiced concerns over the strike's timing, as it coincides with one of the busiest periods for the health service.© Copyright IBTimes 2023.

Members of the public service trade union, Unison are to take part in a national ballot in a dispute over their pay.\nA ballot of Unison members has opened after the union said an offer of £1,290 from local government employers fell short of what council employees need.\nPhil Chanin, chair of Bolton Unison Branch said: \"Over the past 14 years, council and school workers have seen their pay fall further and further behind. Pay awards in local government have been worse than those in the private sector and the economy as a whole. Living costs have spiralled, yet pay in councils and schools has lost nearly a third of its value. We believe that now is the time for us to stand together for better pay\"\nPhil added: \"The joint trade unions, Unison, GMB and Unite submitted a joint pay claim to the local government employers for £3,000 or 10 per cent whichever is the greater.\n\"Their offer of just £1,290 came as a kick in teeth.

    "text": "Abducted Indian Army JCO rescued in Manipur Army columns along with other security forces immediately launched a coordinated joint search operation, which led to the rescue of the JCO on Friday evening. IMPHAL: A serving Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) of the Indian Army was rescued by the security forces, hours after he was kidnapped from his home by ‘unidentified elements’ in Manipur’s Thoubal district on Friday, officials said. A defence spokesman said that Naib Subedar Konsam Kheda Singh, a resident of Charangpat Mamang Leikai in Thoubal district, was abducted while on leave from his residence on Friday morning. Army columns along with other security forces immediately launched a coordinated joint search operation, which led to the rescue of the JCO on Friday evening. The JCO is currently at the Waikhong police station in Thoubal district. Though the exact cause of the abduction is not known yet, media reports suggested that it was an extortion attempt as his family had received such threats in the past. Besides the coordinated search operation, checking of all vehicles plying on National Highway-102 (Imphal-Moreh) was conducted to locate the JCO. Further investigation is underway. Since the outbreak of ethnic violence in Manipur in May last year, soldiers and security personnel, be they on leave or duty, or their relatives have been targeted for nefarious interests. On February 27, the house of Amit Singh, Additional Superintendent of Police (Operations), Moirangthem, was attacked in Imphal. The attackers also abducted him and intimidated his family members by firing in the air, besides vandalising properties. The officer was later rescued due to the timely intervention by the security forces.",

En octubre de 2022, cuando feroces manifestaciones se apoderaron de Irán tras la muerte de la joven Mahsa Amini bajo custodia policial por motivos de moralidad, Salehi lanzó su apoyo al movimiento de protesta. Salehi afirmó que fue torturado y recluido en régimen de aislamiento tras su detención inicial en octubre de 2022 por su participación en el movimiento de protesta. Tras una breve excarcelación en 2023, Salehi volvió a ser detenido por \"hacer afirmaciones falsas y difundir mentiras\", según la agencia de noticias judicial iraní Mizan.

Un tribunal de primera instancia de la ciudad central de Isfahán lo declaró culpable del delito de \"corrupción en la tierra\", y le impuso la pena máxima de muerte. Este sábado, su abogado Amir Raesian dio la noticia de la revocación en un post en X, afirmando que el Tribunal Supremo de Irán había \"evitado un error judicial irreparable\" y anuló la condena a muerte de Salehi esta semana. En su sentencia, el máximo tribunal iraní consideró que las anteriores penas de prisión impuestas a Salehi \"excedían el castigo legal\". La noticia fue recibida con satisfacción por el grupo de campaña [ Index on Censorship](https://www.indexoncensorship.org/), que ha presionado enérgicamente a favor de la liberación del rapero y colaborado estrechamente con un equipo de abogados internacionales especializados en derechos humanos con sede en el bufete londinense Doughty Street Chambers para anular su condena a muerte. \"Es una clara demostración de la injusticia de la decisión del tribunal inferior, y estamos encantados de que Salehi ya no se enfrente a la amenaza de ejecución. El Tribunal Supremo consideró que la condena a muerte dictada contra Salehi era excesiva e incumplía la legislación iraní\", afirmó el grupo en un comunicado este sábado. El caso de Salehi se devolverá ahora al tribunal de primera instancia de Isfahan para que se vuelva a dictar una sentencia, de acuerdo con Index On Censorship, que lamenta la posibilidad de que el rapero vuelva a ser encarcelado. \"Incluso un periodo de encarcelamiento más breve sería una injusticia: Salehi no ha hecho otra cosa que pedir que se respeten sus derechos fundamentales y los de otros iraníes\", añadió el grupo. La abogada de derechos humanos Caoilfhionn Gallagher, con sede en Londres y abogada internacional de la familia Salehi, afirmó que \"no basta\" con que las autoridades iraníes le hayan \"perdonado la vida\". Gallagher, que junto con un equipo de colegas presentó en mayo un llamamiento urgente a la ONU en relación con el caso de Salehi, pidió una vez más su liberación \"incondicional\". \"Instamos a la comunidad internacional a que mantenga la presión en este momento crítico para conseguir la libertad de Salehi y hacer que Irán rinda cuentas por sus atroces violaciones del derecho internacional de los derechos humanos\", afirmó Gallagher en el comunicado de Index On Censorship. La campaña para conseguir la liberación de Salehi ha recibido el apoyo de personalidades de todo el mundo. La Academia de la Grabación, que organiza los premios Grammy, emitió en abril un comunicado en el que se mostraba \"profundamente preocupada por las recientes noticias sobre Toomaj Salehi\". \"Ningún artista debería temer por su vida o su sustento cuando se expresa a través de su arte\", añadía el comunicado. El magnate británico Richard Branson también fue uno de los que pidieron la liberación de Salehi, calificando de \"imposible escuchar la música de Toomaj, leer sus letras y no sentirse profundamente conmovido por su mensaje\". En Irán, más de 300 músicos iraníes firmaron una declaración colectiva en la que expresaban su oposición a la condena a muerte del rapero, describiéndolo como \"un campeón de las justas aspiraciones de toda una generación de iraníes\". La directora ejecutiva de Index on Censorshop, Jemimah Steinfeld, dijo que esperaba que la decisión permitiera a Salehi \"buscar el tratamiento médico que necesita y continuar su vital trabajo\". Claudia Bennett, responsable jurídica y de programas de la Human Rights Foundation, calificó el caso del rapero de \"emblemático de la brutalidad de las dictaduras\". \"Utilizan la detención arbitraria para silenciar a los disidentes y a quienes defienden la democracia y los derechos humanos. El delito de Toomaj fue cantar una canción y publicarla en las redes sociales. Algo que en las democracias damos por sentado\", añadió.",
