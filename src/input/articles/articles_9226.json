    "title": "Environmental stress: A worst-case scenario",
    "text": "When considering environmental stress, we generally think in terms of the heat of the summer or cold in winter, both of which can be challenging. But what if that stress goes to a whole new level? In recent months and years, we have seen very difficult situations like wildfires (not exactly environmental but exponentially worsened by dry weather and high winds) and severe storms such as hurricanes. This is a story about one such event.\nMost folks may recall that in September 2024, the southeastern U.S. was hit by Hurricane Helene, a Category 4 storm that made landfall in Florida’s Big Bend area with 140-mph winds. It crossed Florida and came up through Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and eastern Tennessee, causing numerous fatalities and billions of dollars in damage. We are still hearing about the recovery efforts across much of the region, particularly areas of North Carolina devastated by flooding.\nAnd while we commonly hear about the lives lost and the massive property damage, we typically don’t hear much about the effects on livestock producers, particularly cattle operations. It’s not uncommon to hear about extensive damage to hog barns and poultry houses, but cattle, generally, have very little shelter from a storm of this nature, except for trees and brush. Some farms may have sheds or windbreaks, but this is not terribly common, especially for larger herds.\nOne area affected by the storm was in western South Carolina. The areas around Seneca and Clemson are covered with small to medium-sized cattle operations. One of these is Little Cane Creek Farms, owned by longtime cattle producer Pat Williams, who is heavily involved in the area’s ag industry, including serving as president of the Oconee County Cattlemen’s Association. He is a conscientious manager and takes very good care of his herd. This is reflected in his breeding and calving performance during normal years. In the fall of 2023, Williams calved 100% of his herd in 70 days, from mid-September to Dec. 1. This is not an atypical performance for his operation.\nIn the fall of 2024, this was a somewhat different story. While he did calve all but one cow during his fall calving period, the results were not as good. Helene hit the area on Sept. 29, bringing heavy, sustained winds and driving rain. Fortunately, no mature animal losses took place on the farm. However, about three weeks after the storm, in the middle of his calving period, Williams started seeing calves born dead or very premature – approximately 30 to 40 days with very light birthweights (around 25 pounds), no hair, blind or partially blind. This occurred about the middle of the calving season and affected 20% of his calf crop. Even without current market conditions, this has huge economic effects.\nPostmortems showed no obvious effect from infections, toxicities, nutritional deficiencies or other causes. These cows and the affected calves were in different pastures, so it is unlikely it was from something consumed. They were not subjected to flooding conditions, so it is unlikely they were exposed to anything that might have made its way downstream in high water. To date, no specific cause has been determined. Other herds were similarly affected.\nIn Williams’ case, the very light birthweights could suggest that the cow’s body initiated labor several weeks prematurely when the fetus was still in the growing and developing stage. The question is: What was the trigger that prompted these early deliveries? Stress impacts the reproductive system by influencing body temperature, metabolic hormones and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Additionally, stress can impair the uterine environment, embryo development and maternal recognition of pregnancy, increasing the risk of embryo or fetal loss.\nPatty Scharko is a professor and extension field veterinarian with Clemson University in Columbia, South Carolina. She also heard of some of the losses producers in the area suffered after Hurricane Helene. Surprising to her was that more cases were not reported to her office. However, she acknowledged this was not necessarily unusual, as cattlemen are a pretty self-reliant group.\nScharko observed that in cases like this, the stress can certainly take a toll on cattle herds exposed to the extended effects of the storm. She does not disagree that this significant environmental stress could have a direct effect on certain pregnancies. She says it is also not uncommon in situations where high winds can blow down trees that cattle can gain access to materials such as acorns (which have high tannin levels) from oak trees or other plants such as chinaberries, which are also known to be toxic. However, reviewing the literature, it is unclear if consuming these plant materials might affect the unborn calves or pregnancies.\nJustin Martin of Martin Veterinary Services in Pelzer, South Carolina, worked directly with a number of herds similarly affected. His initial assessment has been that much of what was observed may have been a reaction to a toxin of some type that may have entered the pasture environments from the excessive wind and rain of the storm. But he said he could not discount the direct possibility of the stress effects on a pregnant cow in this situation.\nWhile the actual causes of the calf losses in the area remain unclear, it is obvious that the stress of the storm very likely contributed to this unfortunate situation of so much pregnancy loss.\nThis is the second of a two-part series by Stephen B. Blezinger about understanding and managing environmental stress. The first, “Keeping cattle eating and producing during heat, cold and related events,” was published in the July 2025 issue of Progressive Cattle.",

    "text": "According to [ consequence.net](https://consequence.net/2023/12/heart-first-show-four-years-2023/), the rock duo [Heart](https://music.mxdwn.com/2023/09/16/news/ann-wilson-of-heart-shares-powerful-new-single-this-is-now/) performed their first show in over four years on December 27 at the Yaamava’ Resort & Casino in Highland, California. Ann and Nancy Wilson had previously announced a [New Year’s Eve reunion concert ](https://music.mxdwn.com/2023/10/31/news/heart-announces-reunion-for-new-years-eve-show/)in their hometown of Seattle, Washington. It also appears that [Heart](https://music.mxdwn.com/2021/07/11/news/nancy-wilson-of-heart-shares-video-for-emotional-new-song-walk-away/) has scheduled a few warmup gigs, as the Highland show will be followed by a performance on December 28 at Acrisure Arena in Palm Desert, California. Wednesday’s concert was [Heart’](https://music.mxdwn.com/2022/07/20/news/ann-wilson-discusses-hearts-50th-anniversary-hints-at-special-celebration-in-2023/)s first since performance since October 2019 and during their performance the band ran through a career spanning 14 song sets including the hits “Magic Man,” “Crazy on You” and “Barracuda.” A little bit later on, the Wilson sisters would close out the evening with a cover of Led Zeppelin’s tune “Stairway to Heaven,” where the duo reprised their famous performance of the song at the Kennedy Center Honors back in 2012. Heart will be in full swing when the band joins Def Leppard and Journey as support for the 2024 co headlining North American Stadium Tour. Heart will open on July 30 in Cleveland, Ohio, August 2 in Toronto, and August 5 in Boston. During a recent a recent interview with [96.1 KLPX,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2Gfplabx7g) Ann Wilson shared her thoughts about the upcoming reunion shows: “We’re gonna see how it works with the Heart thing, whether it feels like a level up. If it does feel like a level up, then we’ll keep doing it. But that’s what it has to be. It can’t just slide down into jukebox time… It’s gotta be real. No going through the motions. No phoning it in. No just getting on some kind of circuit just to take people’s money and play the old songs again and again and again. No, we’re gonna make it cool, really make it cool.”",

    "text": "For the first time, Africans had a chance to taste Vietnam’s traditional bánh tét (sticky rice cake). They praised its deliciousness but admitted its filling nature left them too full to enjoy more.\nCong Giap, a native of Nghe An Province, and his colleague Son Thach are long-time members of the team working with Quang Linh Vlogs in Angola.\nIn addition to helping locals cultivate crops, the duo often cook traditional Vietnamese dishes to introduce to the community. These include stir-fried chicken gizzards with beans, shredded pig ear salad, roast pork, chicken rice, grilled pork with rice noodles (bún thịt nướng), and beef stew with bread (bánh mì sốt vang).\nIn a recent video posted to their YouTube channel with over 624,000 followers, Cong Giap and Son Thach brought bánh tét to Maiala village. They offered it to the village priest, a Portuguese landowner, and several local residents.\nSharing bánh tét with the community\nSon Thach explained that his family had recently held a memorial service, during which they made bánh tét. He made five extra cakes to share with the villagers and allow them to experience this Vietnamese delicacy.\nThe cakes were handmade and accompanied by traditional side dishes like pork sausage (giò lụa), chili sauce, and fried eggs.\nEager to have bánh tét after a long time, Cong Giap expressed his excitement, saying, “The cool, rainy weather is perfect for sticky rice dishes like bánh tét.”\nAccording to Cong Giap, the chewy and aromatic cake is filling and suits the locals’ energy needs.\n“Africans typically have large appetites, and this dish keeps them full for hours, providing plenty of energy for work,” he said.\nTo preserve the original flavor, Cong Giap and Son Thach served the bánh tét sliced thinly instead of frying it. The pork sausage was also plated and cut into bite-sized pieces.\nAfter the preparations were complete, they invited everyone to sit at the table and explained the cultural significance of bánh tét during Vietnamese New Year.\n“This is a traditional cake made from glutinous rice and wrapped in banana leaves. It pairs well with giò lụa, which is made from finely ground pork,” Cong Giap introduced.\nDelight and a surprising fullness\nThe local priest, trying bánh tét for the first time, was intrigued. He admitted that he had never encountered anything like it before.\nWhen asked about his experience, the priest nodded enthusiastically, saying, “It’s delicious! I’ve never had anything like this.”\nHowever, he also admitted that the cake left him feeling surprisingly full after just a few slices.\n“It’s so tasty but oddly filling. It looks like rice, but it’s even more satisfying than cornmeal or regular rice. I’d love to eat more, but I’m completely stuffed,” he shared.\nSimilarly, the Portuguese landowner described the bánh tét as chewy, fragrant, and visually appealing with its green banana leaf wrapping.\n“This cake is perfect for me. It’s soft, chewy, and delicious. Even though I ate only a little, I already feel full. I could eat more, but since I’ve just recovered from an illness, I’ll hold back,” he explained.\nTwo members of Quang Linh Vlogs' team brought Vietnamese bánh tét to treat villagers in Africa.\nBánh tét is a traditional dish that is an indispensable part of Tet celebrations for many Vietnamese families.\nAfrican villagers were excited to taste Vietnamese bánh tét for the first time.\nThe priest praised the bánh tét for its delicious taste but couldn’t eat more because he was full.\nPhotos: Cong Giap Vlogs – Life in Africa Thao Trinh",

    "title": "States where robocalls and spam texts are rising fastest | The Sealy News",
    "text": "r.classen // Shutterstock\nStates where robocalls and spam texts are rising fastest\nDespite federal crackdowns and growing public awareness, robocalls and SMS spam are becoming increasingly common in certain parts of the country. Driven by evolving scam tactics and opportunistic targeting, certain states are experiencing an increase in unwanted call and text activity.\nBut which states have it worse than others? And why? PeopleFinders shares what you need to know.\nThe Big Picture: A Nationwide Problem\nIn 2024, Americans received an estimated 53 billion robocalls, and the estimate for spam texts is even higher, according to the YouMail Robocall Index. This staggering volume reflects both persistent scam operations and an increasing reliance on automated systems for marketing.\nWhile robocalls remain a top consumer complaint to the Federal Communications Commission, spam texts are catching up quickly, especially as mobile carriers crack down on voice-based spam.\nIt might not come as a surprise that this rise in spam activity isn’t uniform across the country. A closer look reveals that certain states are experiencing a sharper increase than others.\nStates With The Most Robocall Complaints\nRecent reports indicate that some states experience a higher volume of robocalls and text scams per capita than others. Here are the states with the highest number of complaints per 100,000 people, according to the Federal Trade Commission:\n- Delaware - 885\n- Ohio - 849\n- Arizona - 813\n- Illinois - 801\n- North Carolina - 778\nAnalysts attribute this rise to several factors, including population growth, commonly spoofed area codes, and increased digital activity in certain areas. These regions also tend to be popular targets for seasonal scams, such as tax season or weather-related fraud, giving scammers more thematic hooks for their messages.\nSmishing: Spam Texts Are Catching Up\nAlthough robocalls remain a major source of frustration for many Americans, spam texts are rising fastest in most states. SMS phishing—or “smishing”—is becoming increasingly common, poised to surpass the frequency of robocalls in some areas.\nSmishing scams have become increasingly sophisticated, with links that mimic official portals from banks, government agencies, and delivery services.\nCalifornia and Texas take the cake for the highest volume of spam texts, but states like Arizona and Nevada have seen a sharp rise in fraudulent text scams since 2023. With more governments cracking down on robocalls, it appears that texts are quickly becoming scammers’ next best option.\nWhere Scams Are Rising Fast—And Why\nMany states are seeing a rise in instances of robocalls and “smishing” scams. Here are a few states that saw a significant increase in reported robocalls since 2023:\n- West Virginia\n- Arizona\n- Florida\n- Oklahoma\nWhile spam calls and texts often originate from overseas, scammers routinely spoof local area codes to make their messages appear more trustworthy. As a result, states with dense population centers or high economic activity are disproportionately targeted.\nHow to Protect Yourself\nExperts recommend a multilayered approach to staying safe from scammers. Here are some ways you can avoid falling for an over-the-phone scam:\n- Never answer calls from numbers you don’t recognize.\n- Don’t click on suspicious links, even if they appear to come from a local sender.\n- Forward spam texts to 7726 (SPAM) to report them to your carrier.\n- Use your phone’s built-in spam filtering tools or install third-party call-blocking software.\n- For added peace of mind, look up unknown numbers via\nreverse phone lookupbefore responding, especially if the message sounds urgent or threatening.\nThe FCC has stepped up enforcement against illegal robocallers in recent years, and some states are passing laws to regulate text-based scams. Still, the enforcement landscape remains reactive.\nMany scam operations shift tactics quickly or operate out of jurisdictions beyond the reach of the U.S. legal system. It falls to individuals to take proper action and keep themselves safe.\nKey Takeaways\nRobocalls and spam texts aren’t going away anytime soon, but their growth in popularity isn’t hitting all states equally. As scammers continue to exploit local trust and ever-changing tactics, consumers in high-target areas need to be especially vigilant.\nWith a combination of technological tools and smarter habits, it’s possible to avoid the worst of the spam wave and stop scammers from turning your phone into a liability.\nThis story was produced by PeopleFinders and reviewed and distributed by Stacker.",
