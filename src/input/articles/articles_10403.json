    "text": "US to deny visas, green cards over pro-terror, antisemitic social media posts\nUSCIS will now deny or revoke visas based on social media posts supporting antisemitic terrorism. The immediate policy shift targets online speech and follows recent arrests of pro-Palestinian student activists.\nIn Short\n- US visas may be denied for anti-Semitic social media posts\n- Policy effective immediately under Trump's administration\n- USCIS to scrutinise social media for anti-Semitic content\nYour social media activity could lead to the rejection or revocation of your US visa. In a statement, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that immigration authorities will scrutinise social media accounts and deny visas or residency permits to individuals posting content deemed anti-Semitic under President Donald Trump's administration. The policy will go into effect immediately.\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement, “There is no room in the United States for the rest of the world’s terrorist sympathisers, and we are under no obligation to admit them or let them stay here.”\n“Sec. Noem has made it clear that anyone who thinks they can come to America and hide behind the First Amendment to advocate for anti-Semitic violence and terrorism – think again. You are not welcome here,” McLaughlin said.\nALSO READ: US revokes student visas: What Indian students should do after deportation notices\nIn a statement issued Wednesday morning, the DHS said it will strictly enforce all relevant immigration laws to the maximum degree, to protect the homeland from extremists and terrorist aliens, including those who support antisemitic terrorism, violent antisemitic ideologies and antisemitic terrorist organisations such as Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, or Ansar Allah aka: “the Houthis.”\nUSCIS will now consider social media posts endorsing or promoting antisemitic terrorism or related activity as a negative factor in immigration evaluations. The policy is effective immediately and applies to visa applications, green card requests, and other discretionary immigration benefits.\nThe official statement comes amid reports that the Trump administration has recently revoked the visas of hundreds of international students across the United States. This announcement follows the widely publicised arrests of pro-Palestinian student activists, including Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk, whom the government accuses of participating in antisemitic activities.",

    "title": "Tomato scarcity: Tuta absoluta is not our problem",
    "text": "Tomato is one of Nigeria’s most important short-duration crops. A highly versatile and economically valuable vegetable, it contributes to food security and the survival of the country’s agricultural economy. On the home front, it is a staple ingredient in every kitchen, which comes in different forms and packages – fresh, dried, pasted, natural or synthetic. Indeed, tomato’s indispensability has made it central to the nation’s food inflationary trend. When tomatoes are scarce, the cost of feeding goes up automatically.\nThis was the major reason I penned an article on this column last month, entitled “Averting the looming tomato scarcity”. Considering the outbreak of the deadly tuta absoluta pests – also known as tomato leaf miner or tomato Ebola – in several large tomato farms across Kano, Katsina and Kaduna States, I was worried that the attack on major tomato producing hubs would definitely have a direct impact on the country’s food system.\nAs a matter of fact, the infestation, which started in March and caused a loss of tens of billions of naira, had already led to a spike in tomato prices. As of May, the Chairman of Tomato Growers and Processors Association of Nigeria, Rabiu Zuntu, said that a 50kg basket of tomatoes (selling between N5,000 and N10,000 before the outbreak) then sold for around N30,000.\nHowever, after further research and inquiry, I discovered that the pest infestation is not the major threat to Nigeria’s tomato supply chain and food security. The more lethal hazards hide in plain view.\nFor instance, there is a natural supply gap that actively contributes to tomato scarcity, which is that supplies of fresh tomatoes from the north drastically reduce during rainy seasons. Many tomato farms in the north rely on irrigation, as opposed to rain-fed agriculture, so when the rains come, the farms are not equipped to produce a large quantity, leading to a shortage. Poor road conditions in the rainy season and humid conditions contribute to post-harvest losses. Additionally, many farmers lack the facilities, such as a greenhouse, to continue production during the rainy season.\nThe point is that there are several solvable challenges that cause tomato scarcity, which the Federal Government could tackle in a holistic and multi-stakeholder fashion. Meanwhile, the rainy season creates a favourable environment for certain diseases that can affect tomato crops, such as fungal infections or the Tuta absoluta pest. In other words, the Tomato Ebola is just a single problem in a basket of issues.\nThis, too, is solvable. And, I am glad that the National Horticultural Research Institute, popularly known as NIHORT, has been on this for a long time now. The missing link is what we are about to see in the following paragraphs.\nAfter Tuta absoluta was officially reported in Nigeria in 2015, NIHORT, together with the then Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, carried out a diagnostic survey to identify the causative organisms and appropriate mitigative and preventive measures. In 2018, the institute developed Tuta trap tray – an environmentally friendly tool designed to eliminate adult Tuta absoluta (tomato leafminer) pest, as part of an integrated pest management solution. It also developed biopesticides: NIHORT-Lyptol and NIHORT-Raktin, innovated to target the eggs and larvae of Tuta absoluta.\nThe reader, surely, may now be wondering if these government-sponsored solutions are available, why is Tomato Ebola still ravaging our farms? The answer is as shocking as it is revealing.\nAfter the mass production of the biopesticides and the Tuta Trap Tray from 2018 till date; conducting Hausa radio live phone-in programmes (from 2018 to 2023) in Kano (major hotspot); airing of sustainable Tuta control jingles in Hausa in various radio stations; production and awareness-creation dissemination of flyers; participating in press conferences and brainstorming sessions on Tuta absoluta menace; training farmers in major tomato-producing states such as Kano, Kaduna, Katsina, Jigawa and Plateua States; distribution of 2,000 litres of Lyptol to farmers across the northern states in 2020 and recently production of 4,000 litres of the biopesticies and 500 trap trays for farmers’ use; sending 6,000 litres to Kano State; the needle did not move an inch because most farmers never showed any enthusiasm to adopt and use the pesticides and Tuta trap tray.\nOn enquiry about why the efforts hit a brick wall, I was told by NIHORT staff, “The status of usage with respect to Tuta Trap Tray, as when we sent it to the Kano office, had not changed. Not a single TTT was requested from our Kano office till now. There was no single request for the Integrated Pest Management solutions in our Kano office for 15 months while we waited to solve the problem. Having run almost 16 weeks’ jingles on solutions to Tuta in the local language on Kano and Kaduna (in two) radio stations. All this was done in NIHORT’s response to the claims of the Tuta absoluta outbreak in 2023. They didn’t comply, maybe because they needed to pay for our own, but that of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture (which we supplied), I believe, was free as gratis/subsidy.”\nI, therefore, concluded that the major problem faced by the Nigerian agricultural sector is passing down research output to end-users – that is, the farmers.\nFrankly, if the Nigerian people do what is right, there would not be any substantial threat from the pests, as we already have the institutions and capacity to tackle them decisively. In fact, breeding work is currently ongoing at NIHORT by a team of research scientists to develop new tomato varieties that are resistant to Tuta absoluta. Additionally, the Federal Government has supported the institute to develop two new varieties of tomatoes in April 2025 that are resistant to bacterial wilt (another globally recognised menace in the tomato value chain).\nThe Executive Director of the National Horticultural Research Institute, Dr Mohammed Lawal Attanda, said, “Another challenge is the purchasing power of the farmers. With the outbreak of Tuta absoluta disease, we sprang into action. We have a breakthrough technology to cater for the outbreak. We produced a solution and took it to the field, but the farmers could not really pay for it. They need a subsidised rate for it. But we could not subsidise this bio-pesticide for them. It is organically made and environmentally friendly. It is 100 per cent locally made, certified, and we even have a patent on it. But the farmers cannot afford it. So, the ministry has to come in. We are in that process now to get it across to the farmers. I believe with all hands on deck, we can surmount all the challenges.”\nThe question is, how long are we going to wait before the farmers get the required support to be able to afford the Tuta absoluta solution? This is why I said that the pest infestation is not the problem of tomato production in Nigeria. There is an urgent need to create the necessary linkage between industry and research. It is my view that the government must also set up a special food security fund, which is directed to intervention in critical food production sub-sectors, like tomato.\nReal farmers must be helped to produce organic food for the citizens, in a way that they are not encumbered with the activities of speculators and profiteers. They need access to quality and affordable tomato seeds. If the government cannot subsidise the seeds produced by NIHORT, at least it should do all in its power to drive down the cost of imported seeds. For instance, about 300g of tomato seeds is around N150,000. This is so because the horticultural seed market is largely dominated by seed importation from Europe and other countries. This does not augur well for our country’s food security.",

I don't know about you, but keeping up (or even just doing) things for my own wellness or self-care can slide off my radar or just get pushed aside for some other activity. That happens even more often at the end of the year and with the holidays.\nHere we have a game of wellness bingo for November. I thought it would be a fun way to try to keep at it, or to keep it top of mind, by making a little game of it. I also thought this might be a good way to get a leg up on resolutions for the new year. Wellness takes work - let's do the work together, BIC!\nHOW TO PARTICIPATE:\nThere are a couple of ways to participate. You can aim every week (or every month) to try to check off a different 5-boxes in a row - vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. OR, to add a different take to this wellness challenge, you can use this sheet to see how many boxes you can check off this month. Those are just 2 ways to participate; I'm sure there are other ways and if there's an approach that you find works better for you to get in a little more self care, more regularly, please do share!\nBONUS CHALLENGE: This challenge is certainly one you can do on your own. It's also something we can take part in together! Share about the activities you did to earn each square. I love hearing from this Community - I learn about new things I wouldn't have thought of otherwise. Or, share challenges or questions.\nWe are all at different stages of our wellness / self-care journey. I'm not at expert at all at this and if there's an activity that is not something you are ready for or that you shouldn't engage in, make the adjustments you need to, or just skip the activity. For instance, the first square is to take a walk outside - if it's storming outside or you're in an area where it is not safe to walk outside (e.g., weather advisory, shelter-in-place, etc.), then skip this one and stay indoors. Be safe. For some of these activities, particularly the physical ones, please consult with your physician or health care provider before starting, if and as appropriate.\nThe time periods I included are arbitrary - if you want or can do more than a 10 minute walk outside, go for it. If you're starting out or if you're crunched for time, aim for 5 minutes and work up when, if and as appropriate for you.\nWondering about the activities mentioned in the squares? Check this out - Wellness In Progress: November 2024 - Activity Summary\nMy self-care so far this week...\n.\nNot taking this challenge in any particular order this week I really enjoyed...\nTreating myself to a sample of Le Labo's, \"Gaiac 10.\" I love perfume and this has to be the most decadent, thoughtful presentation I've ever gotten with a sample! The wrapping and personal note make it feel so special....\nDoing a Baby Foot Mask under my Uggiest Uggs while trying to stop my dog Finn from licking the slime (any one else both terrified and in love with Baby Foot?)....\nMy princess pup Edie after a short dog walk outside...\nMusic (especially headphones - I wear them because I'm Autistic to block out noise a lot but am also a musician and think getting to blast music privately can be therapeutic for anyone)....\nAnd, aromatherapy with my diffuser in the kitchen. This time it was a blend of vanilla, sandalwood and oud. Anyone have any go to diffuser oils they love?\nOK, time to go rinse the Baby Foot off and make sure I still have feet, lol. This has been good motivation for me.\nThe Baby Foot masks are my favorite exfoliating peel foot mask [@PDXXXX](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1355616). There’s something satisfying (and unnerving) about seeing all the dead skin flake off. I often forget I’ve done one until I see the shedding and my first thought is always “what is going on?” before I realize it’s the peel foot masks!\nEdie is adorable!!\nP.S. No particular order for which activity or square to do. All up to you!\n[@itsfi](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2307169) Edie thanks you! I know...why is it so satisfying to peel layers of skin off your feet?? It makes me feel disgusting for loving it so much every time but they definitely get the job done, lol\n[@itsfi](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2307169) I absolutely love this idea! I am all for fitting in self care in all its forms, as and when I can, and this is a great way to mix things up and make things fun and engaging! I will definitely be following along with this thread and checking off as many boxes as I can!\nThanks for posting!\nSo glad to hear that [@caitbird](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/5546163) Looking forward to hearing what activities you do for the squares you check off. I’m excited to make these activities more routine and to get ideas from folks here as to what they do.\n[@CorgiMommy](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/463478), thank you; fun and hopefully, an effective tool.\n[@greeneyedgirl107](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/18125), thank you; hopefully it will be helpful.\nThis is such a neat idea [@itsfi](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2307169). I took a walk outside earlier today before seeing this, so I guess I get to mark off the first box!\nYes, one box marked off [@PrettyPaint](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/612743), yaaaay! I went for a walk during lunch so I'll mark that square on mine as well!\nThis is pretty creative [@itsfi](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2307169)\nThere's a line that I think I do pretty regularly, so I'll challenge myself to do the one across. I have all these hand lotions that would love to be used.\naw-shucks, [@danielledanielle](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/33517), that's a huge compliment coming from you; thank you (said wholeheartedly but also bashfully). Yes, that's the spirit! And your hands will thank you for the TLC!\n[@itsfi](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2307169) LOVE this! What a fun way to get in some self care. I like the concept of this game and how we can make it our own. I will be back with an update.\n100% agree [@Mellmars1185](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2700541)! There can be more distractions and hurdles during this time of year to get in self care, let alone do it regularly, so I'm hopeful this will be a flexible and fun way for all of us to do that or maintain that practice now (and then be maintaining our progress come the new year!!) I like that it's a way for us to do this on our own, as a community here on BIC or within our other community of friends, co-workers, family, etc. and also for us to modify the activity to what works best for us.\n[@itsfi](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2307169) This is cool! Can you send me a copy so I can download it? I could be lazy but I'm already editing I don't want to have to crop more photos if I screenshot it lol.\n[@Samtian](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/274521), done! Hope you have fun with this!\nOh, and feel free to come back here and shout out a \"BINGO!\" when you check off 5 boxes in a row!\nWhat a fantastic idea! [@itsfi](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2307169) I love this chart it reminds me of bingo wellness bingo haha this is such an uplifting thread can’t wait to partipicate\nYes, yes, yes [@peculiarzmakeup](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6103078)! It's definitely like BINGO. No moderator to call out the activity here - all up to each person and what will suit them in their personal wellness journey! But, people can if they wish aim to get \"bingo\" (is that what it's called?) and try to do 5 activities that are next to each other. I'm going to *try* to do get one square each day this month, or average one per day.\nI'm thrilled you like this! Super excited to have you on board and I'm looking forward to hearing about how it goes for you and what you do for each of the squares you check off.\nAn add-on to the card on the original post.\nFirst Row:\nTAKE A WALK OUTSIDE (10 MINUTES) - Ahhhh, fresh air! Depending on wear you live, bundle up - it's a little crisp outside. Want to share a great tip that [@heartsmyface](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/369543) shared on the [Habit Stacking Thread ](/t5/Besides-Beauty/Habit-Stacking-Thread/m-p/6860738#U6860738) thread - she occasionally puts on teeth whitening strips before she heads out for a walk.\nMASK TIME - There's a mask for nearly every need and for any time constraints we might be under. Most masks recommend 10-20 minutes but if that's more time than you have, there are others out there, including, [DIOR Capture Dreamskin 1-Minute Mask 2.5 oz / 75 mL](/t5/c-sephora/DIOR+Capture+Dreamskin+1-Minute+Mask+2.5+oz+%25252F+75+mL/pd-p/P504053_2623163) (1 Min), [SEPHORA COLLECTION Booster Eye Mask Smooth + Peptides 1 pair / pack](/t5/c-sephora/SEPHORA+COLLECTION+Booster+Eye+Mask+Smooth+%25252B+Peptides+1+pair+%25252F+pack/pd-p/P512733_2743300) (5 minutes).

Or spend time meditating or just being still, being quiet.\nHAND CARE - This can take many forms - stretching exercises for your hand, using a hand cream regularly, cuticle care.\nSPEAK KINDLY TO YOURSELF - We can be our harshest critics. It's helpful to hold ourselves to a high standard. It's also helpful to cheer ourselves on from time to time. What's something you did today that you're proud of? What do you love most about yourself (e.g., character, accomplishment, feature, etc.) Shout yourself out!\nSecond Row:\nREAD FOR LEISURE (20 MINUTES) - whether it's a book (Kindle, audio or physical book) or a magazine, the newspaper or blog. If you're working through a book, consider posting about it on the [BIC book club!](/t5/Besides-Beauty/BIC-book-club/m-p/3610535#U3610535) thread when you're done.\nSTAY HYDRATED - Whether you measure your daily recommended intake by cups or ounces, aim to get that or more each day!\nTRY / DO SOMETHING NEW - Is there something you've been meaning to try or do - taking up a new hobby? Checking out a museum? Going to the new coffee shop in the neighborhood? Learning a new makeup technique, like blontouring a la [Cheek Challenge Fall 2024: Fall Flushing Forward](/t5/Cheeky-Cheeks/Cheek-Challenge-Fall-2024-Fall-Flushing-Forward/m-p/6657548#U6657548) thread? Go for it!\nTREAT YOURSELF - Treat. Yourself. Now, this is definitely something I would love to hear about. And I think others in the Community would too. What did you do check off this square? Let us know.\nSTRETCH (20 MINUTES) - Do a full body stretch. Focus on one or two areas. If 20 minutes is a stretch, start with 5 or 10. Or, simply pick one part of the body to focus on and do 1 or 2 stretches.\nThird Row:\nAROMATHERAPY - Light a candle to fill a room with your favorite scent - maybe while you're reading for leisure or having some quiet time or stretching - ooooh, multi-tasking and an oopportunity to check off multiple boxes with this wellness challenge.\nEXERCISE (10 MINUTES) - Whether at the gym, working out from home, or walking outdoors (and earning 2 blocks in this wellness challenge). Adjust time, less or more, as needed.\nFREE SPACE - Everyone gets to mark off at least 1 box in this challenge.\nMAKE A DISH USING SEASONAL VEGETABLES - If you feel like sharing, consider posting a photo of your delicious dish on the [What's on your plate?](/t5/Besides-Beauty/What-s-on-your-plate/m-p/430729#U430729) thread.\nGET OUTSIDE (REMEMBER SPF) - When I can, I've been trying to get some of errands done by walking to wherever I need to go - walking to the farmer's market or to a nearby coffee shop.

Foot mask? Pedicure - diy at home or treat yourself to one?\nGET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP - ahhhh, sleep.\nLISTEN TO MUSIC - Do you have music or a song you like to listen to as part of a wellness or self-care practice, or if you have a song that puts you in a great mood? Put that on play and repeat!\nPRACTICE GRATITUDE - Start or end, or do both, each day, identifying something or someone you are grateful for.\nTOOL TIME SELF CARE EDITION - There are several tools out there - candles, a journal, a face roller, gua sha tool.\nFifth Row:\nDIGITAL DETOX BEFORE BED (20 MINUTES) - Turn off the digital devices and set them aside for 20 minutes before calling it a night. NOTE: if you use an app like Headspace to help you sleep or if you read on an e-reader as a form of downtime before bed, keep at it. This is more meant to be off the phone, texting, being on social media (including Sephora BIC), etc. before bed.\nCATCH UP WITH A FRIEND - over the phone, over coffee\nEAT YOUR FRUITS & VEGGIES -\nBE KIND TO YOURSELF - What does that mean for you?\nBODY CARE - This can be in the form of exercise - yoga, pilates, going out for a run, etc. Or, it can be beauty related - using a body gua sha or dry brushing, etc.\nWe are all at different stages of our wellness / self-care journey. I'm not at expert at all at this and if there's an activity that is not something you are ready for or that you shouldn't engage in, make the adjustments you need to, or just skip the activity. For instance, the first square is to take a walk outside - if it's storming outside or you're in an area where it is not safe to walk outside (e.g., weather advisory, shelter-in-place, etc.), then skip this one and stay indoors. Stay safe. For some of these activities, particularly the physical ones, please consult with your physician or health care provider before starting, if and as appropriate.\nThe time periods I included are arbitrary - if you want or can do more than a 10 minute walk outside, go for it. If you're starting out or if you're crunched for time, aim for 5 minutes and work up when, if and as appropriate for you.",

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Police rush to Tyreek Hill’s condo after domestic dispute with wife Keeta Hill: divorce now in motion\nTyreek Hillis under scrutiny after being involved in a domestic incident with his wife,\nKeeta Hill, at their Sunny Isles Beach condo. According to a police report obtained by Local 10 News, officers responded on April 7, 2025, to a call about an “assault in progress.” The dispute reportedly involved thrown objects, a heated argument, and concerns voiced by Keeta’s mother, who feared for her daughter's safety. No arrests were made, but the police report contains troubling allegations that could have major repercussions for Hill both personally and professionally.\nTyreek Hill allegedly threw a laptop and took his daughter toward the balcony during heated argument with Keeta Hill\nSunny Isles Beach Police Department, officers arrived at the residence around 2 p.m. on April 7 after receiving a report of an active domestic dispute. When officers entered the scene, they encountered\nTyreekHill, his wife Keeta Hill, and Keeta’s mother, Alesia Vaccaro.\nVaccaro, who has reportedly been living with the couple since November 2024 following the birth of their child, told police that she witnessed Tyreek Hill become “very aggressive and impulsive.” She alleged that he threw a laptop to the ground and then grabbed his daughter and walked toward the balcony in the middle of an argument with Keeta.\nKeeta Hill tells officers she is filing for divorce from Tyreek Hill and says their arguments have been escalating\nIn her statements to police, Keeta Hill said that she and Tyreek Hill had been experiencing more frequent arguments and that he often throws objects when upset. The latest altercation allegedly escalated when Keeta told Tyreek he wasn’t being present enough in their daughter’s life. According to the report, Hill became visibly irritated and, “without malice,” took the child and began walking with her.\nKeeta Hill told police she is currently in the process of filing for a divorce. Officers observed a bruise on her upper chest, which Keeta said may have occurred unintentionally when Tyreek Hill took the baby from her. Despite this, she chose not to provide a written statement.\nTyreek Hill claims his rights as a father and denies physical confrontation but police documented visible injuries on Keeta Hill\nTyreek Hill confirmed to officers that he had returned home from training and began a conversation about their ongoing couples therapy. He stated that the argument became heated but maintained that he had the right to take his child just as Keeta did, saying, “I have the same rights as a father as her as a mother, and I can take my baby whenever I want.”\nBoth Tyreek and Keeta Hill denied that the incident turned physically violent. However, the bruise on Keeta’s chest was noted by officers in their report, and while the child appeared to be healthy and unharmed, the incident prompted serious concern from responding officers.\nNo arrests were made but the incident raises new concerns about Tyreek Hill’s pattern of off-field behavior\nFollowing the incident, Tyreek Hill voluntarily left the residence around 2:40 p.m. in the presence of officers. Keeta Hill remained at the residence with her mother and child. A case card was issued to her by police, but no formal charges or arrests were made.\nThis marks yet another off-field controversy for the Miami Dolphins wide receiver. Just two months prior, in February 2024, social media influencer Sophie Hall filed a civil lawsuit against Tyreek Hill, accusing him of fracturing her leg during a football drill at his home. And back in September 2024, Hill was cited in an altercation with Miami-Dade police, although that case was dismissed due to the officers not appearing in court.\nAlso read -\nNFL legend Rob Gronkowski donates $400K to transform the high school gym where he once trained\nAs of now, neither the Miami Dolphins organization nor the NFL has issued a public statement regarding the domestic dispute. With the league’s focus on personal conduct, the incident could trigger a deeper investigation that may affect Tyreek Hill’s status heading into the 2025 NFL season.\nThe police report, while not resulting in charges, offers a troubling glimpse into the wide receiver’s personal life—and could carry consequences both on and off the field.\nDownload\nThe Times of India\nNews Appfor LatestSports NewsSubscribe\nStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!\nOrder Now",
