JO Paris 2024 : le boxeur Billal Bennama se contente de l'argent, 54e médaille française](//www.leparisien.fr/jo-paris-2024/direct-jo-paris-2024-les-lebrun-pour-une-place-en-finale-du-cyclisme-sur-piste-suivez-la-journee-du-8-aout-08-08-2024-DIYJ3RWEWBCM5NU7M4RTQYBOIA.php)\nJO Paris 2024 : l’enquête pour harcèlement sexuel visant l’athlète Jimmy Gressier classée sans suite\nL’enquête pour harcèlement sexuel visant l’athlète français Jimmy Gressier, qui a concouru mercredi aux JO 2024 de Paris, a été classée le 2 juillet pour « infraction insuffisamment caractérisée ». Elle faisait suite à un signalement du directeur de l’INSEP.\nL’enquête à l’encontre de\n Jimmy Gressier, fondeur français qui a concouru mercredi aux JO 2024 de Paris, a été classée le 2 juillet pour « infraction insuffisamment caractérisée », a indiqué jeudi le parquet de Paris à l’AFP, confirmant une information de Mediapart. Confiée au commissariat du 12e arrondissement, elle avait été ouverte à la suite d’un signalement du directeur général de l’ Institut national du sport, de l’expertise et de la performance (Insep) en octobre sur le fondement de l’article 40 du code de procédure pénale, permettant à toute autorité de signaler des faits à la justice.\nElle visait selon le parquet à « vérifier si les faits évoqués devaient être qualifiés pénalement de harcèlement sexuel ». « Il est ressorti des investigations qu’à la suite d’une relation consentie de quelques semaines, Jimmy Gressier avait continué à avoir un comportement ambigu, auquel il a mis un terme après avoir compris que son interlocutrice ne le souhaitait plus », a précisé le parquet.\n« Je ne comprends pas comment c’est possible »\nLe ministère public a souligné qu’« aucune plainte n’a été déposée » et « aucune poursuite disciplinaire n’a été engagée ». « L’enquête administrative avait déjà conclu à l’absence d’éléments à charge contre mon client, j’observe que le parquet de Paris arrive aux mêmes conclusions à l’issue d’une enquête préliminaire », s’est félicité Me Antoine Maisonneuve, avocat de l’athlète.\nJimmy Gressier, fondeur détenteur de plusieurs records en France,\nest arrivé 13e vendredi de la finale du 10 000 m aux JO de Paris, et a été éliminé mercredi en séries du 5 000 m. Le signalement faisait suite à une commission d’enquête parlementaire sur les dysfonctionnements des fédérations dans le sport, alors que la Fédération française d’athlétisme (FFA) avait été critiquée par des athlètes pour son inaction en matière de violences sexistes et sexuelles.\nLe 5 septembre 2023, l’athlète Claire Palou, auditionnée par cette commission, avait notamment rapporté des faits de harcèlement sexuel qui se seraient déroulés à l’Insep, au cœur du Bois de Vincennes. Depuis, Claire Palou a publiquement accusé Jimmy Gressier, partenaire d’entraînement, d’avoir eu des comportements ou propos inappropriés après une relation consentie par le passé.\nInterrogée le 1er août par Mediapart sur ce classement de l’enquête, Claire Palou a répondu : « J’ignorais que l’enquête avait été classée. Je n’ai même pas été auditionnée par le commissariat chargé de l’enquête. Je ne comprends pas comment c’est possible. On m’a simplement demandé si je voulais déposer plainte, et j’y ai finalement renoncé ». « J’aurais aimé que les choses soient davantage prises au sérieux », a ajouté l’ancienne spécialiste du demi-fond qui a abandonné l’athlétisme depuis.",

The crash occurred just after 4 p.m. on westbound 215, west of Jones Boulevard. (Victoria Hoang) Yuhas knew he caught back up to the black vehicle by the billowing smoke seen over the center median of the same color. NSP said the SUV collided head-on with another vehicle that then overturned and struck a car. Those two other vehicles caught fire.\nYuhas, safe on the other side, felt compelled to pull over.\n“The driver was yelling for help, and so I instantly jumped over the barrier without really thinking about it,” Yuhas said. “You see stuff like this on TV and you don’t relate with it until you’re right there in that moment.”\nTwo people died after a wrong-way crash in the northwest Las Vegas area Thursday afternoon, according to police. (Victoria Hoang) He joined others helping distressed drivers to safety, or at least those they could safely reach amidst scorching flames that other drivers captured on video. Collectively, Yuhas said they removed the driver of one of the cars on fire off the freeway.\n“He had the gash on his forehead. I think his nose was broken. (His) back was all burnt from the fire in his vehicle,” Yuhas said. “He was having kind of a hard time even processing (what had happened) as he got out.”\nOf the three adult male drivers, this is the only one that survived. NPS, in a release on Friday, corrected incorrect information it provided on Thursday, saying the wrong way driver and one of the cars he hit both died on the scene.\nTwo people died after a wrong-way crash in the northwest Las Vegas area Thursday afternoon, according to police. The crash occurred just after 4 p.m. on westbound 215, west of Jones Boulevard. (KLAS) Wrong-way driver calls are leaving state troopers strained, according to NPS Public Information Officer and Trooper Shawn Haggstrom, who are unable to follow these drivers to stop them as they typically do for other reckless driving reports. He says the reporting calls typically do not come in until moments before the crash happens.\n“You usually can’t ask the driver what they were thinking because they’re dead by the time you guys get there, right?” 8 News Now Reporter Ryan Matthey asked during a virtual interview Friday, to which Haggstrom confirmed.\nThe charred portion of the 215 Northern Beltway on Friday, June 21, 2024, that Nevada State Police said was where a wrong-way driver collided with others before combustion on Thursday. (KLAS) The agency gets slight assistance from wrong-way driving technology, which includes flashing “wrong way” signs on the freeway and interstate off-ramps that detect when a car enters from the wrong way and send video to first responders. There are only four locations in the Vegas Valley that have them, and Thursday’s wrong-way driver likely did not encounter any of them.\nThe Nevada Department of Transportation expects to enhance more exit ramps along U.S. 95 from the Spaghetti Bowl around the Rainbow curve later this year, though widespread installation valley-wide is likely years away.\n“It’s very intense for us because we don’t know what’s going to happen,” Haggstrom said.\nFor those like Yuhas, the bone-chilling experience may never be forgotten, unless he’s no longer required to drive this portion of freeway every day. It’s the fastest way to his job and family, he says.\n“It felt cold outside in that moment, and it was like over 100 degrees,” Yuhas said. “It’s scary to know that I am going to get on that road five times a week and that could happen at any moment.”\nLas Vegas driver Ron Yuhas Haggstrom told 8 News Now that a majority of wrong-way crashes happen from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. and on weekends. To best protect yourself from a wrong-way driver, he suggests:\nScanning the upcoming road 10 to 15 seconds ahead of reaching it At night, avoid traveling in the lane closest to the median where a majority of these crashes happen Utilize headlights and seatbelts Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

    "text": "By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Bassam Masoud\nCAIRO/GAZA (Reuters) – Israeli forces attacked areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip where residents have been expecting a renewed ground offensive in areas crammed with tens of thousands of Palestinians already displaced by the Israeli-Hamas war.\nWith nightfall on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the southern city of Khan Younis killed eight Palestinians, health officials said. Three Palestinians were killed and six injured in an Israeli missile strike on a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent said.\n“The task here is to dismantle Hamas – so that it no longer has military and governing capabilities,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said at a press briefing on operations in Khan Younis. “We will be required to show a lot of perseverance and determination.”\nA Palestinian journalist posted pictures of Israeli tanks near a mosque in a built-up area of Bureij in central Gaza.\nThe Islamist group Hamas released video it said showed its fighters targeting Israeli tanks and soldiers east of Bureij. Reuters was not able to verify the location or the date the video was filmed.\n“That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,” said Omar, 60, who said he had been forced to move with at least 35 family members. He declined to give his surname for fear of reprisals.\nYamen Hamad has been living in a school in Deir al-Balah, also in central Gaza, since fleeing from the north. He said people newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nIn one of Israel’s latest airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. Their bombed building was housing displaced civilians, according to local medics and residents.\nSEARCHING THROUGH RUBBLE\nReuters video showed rescuers scrabbling frantically through rubble to uncover and pull out victims including a baby and several children and rushing them through milling crowds of dazed and weeping people to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital.\nPalestinian health authorities said earlier that 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 – nearly 1% of Gaza’s population. Thousands more dead were feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nOver the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nHamas and its fighters are dug deep into the Gaza Strip’s dense cities and towns and their leaders are still at large.\nIsrael has reported 169 of its soldiers killed in its Gaza campaign after Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.\nSome 110 hostages were freed during a Nov. 24-Dec. 1 humanitarian pause and more than 20 others have been declared dead.\nU.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Hamas killed an American hostage, Judith Weinstein, 70, on Oct. 7. Last week he said her husband Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on the same day.\nThe Israeli military released findings of an investigation into the killings in error by its troops of three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Dec. 15. Soldiers mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding.\nEGYPT’S PLAN TO END CONFLICT\nEgypt confirmed on Thursday that it had put forward a framework proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip that includes three stages ending with a ceasefire and said it was awaiting responses on the plan.\nThe proposal is an attempt “to bring viewpoints between all concerned parties closer, in an effort to stop Palestinian bloodshed and the aggression against the Gaza Strip and restore peace and stability to the region,” Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt’s State Information Service, said in a statement.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will keep some form of security control of all Gaza indefinitely, though he insists that this would not amount to reoccupying the enclave.\n(Reporting by Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo, Bassam Masoud in Gaza and Emily Rose in Jerusalem; writing by Grant McCool; editing by Howard Goller)",
