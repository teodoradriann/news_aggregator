    "text": "Tribune News Network\nDoha\nNour Farchoukh, a distinguished biomedical sciences graduate from Qatar University (QU), has been awarded the prestigious Qatar Precision Health Institute (QPHI) scholarship, making her the first QU graduate selected for the Master of Science (MSc) programme in Genetic Counselling at the College of Health Sciences within QU Health.\nNour’s achievement is a testament to the collaborative efforts between Qatar Genome, a member of the Qatar Foundation (QF), and QU. The scholarship, covering a two-year master’s degree in genetic counselling, signifies a remarkable step in fostering academic excellence and advancing genomic research in the region.\nDr Mashael Al-Shafai, Director of Research and Graduate Studies at QU Health, expressed her enthusiasm for the genetic counselling programme, stating, “The genetic counselling programme, initiated in 2018, aims to equip the healthcare sector in Qatar and the region with capable genetic counsellors possessing the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience to address the growing demands in genetics and genomics. The programme includes taught courses, clinical placements, seminars, and research projects, providing students with a comprehensive learning experience over two years. This landmark achievement in 2022, where the Ministry of Public Health officially recognized genetic counselling as a profession in Qatar, places Qatar ahead in the realm of genomics and healthcare globally.”\nUpon learning about her selection, Nour expressed her gratitude for being chosen as the inaugural recipient of the QPHI scholarship. She stated, “The moment I found out about the sponsorship, I was thrilled and honoured. Dr Mashael generously shared the specific criteria guiding the selection process for the QPHI scholarship: qualification, experience, and interview performance. Notably, the non-working student with the highest score would be chosen. This transparent insight into the assessment rubric deepened my appreciation for the privilege, and I am grateful to be the inaugural QU Health student receiving the QPHI scholarship.”\nNour’s passion for merging her biomedical sciences background with genetic counselling drives her commitment to contribute significantly to the field within the context of QPHI and QU Health. The QU Genetic Counselling programme offers comprehensive training with clinical exposure at prominent healthcare institutions like Hamad Medical Corporation and Sidra Medicine, providing students with a holistic understanding of genetic complexities in Qatar.\nThe official recognition of the profession of genetic counselling in Qatar in 2022 is a significant milestone. Addressing the global shortage of genetic counsellors, Nour recognized the importance of making a meaningful impact. “As I progress in my genetic counselling career, I am dedicated not only to providing direct patient care but also to advocating for the profession. Through mentorship, educational initiatives, and outreach programmes, I aim to inspire and encourage others to join this specialized field.”\n Copy 29/12/2023 10",

    "title": "Biden taps official who left US allies stranded in Afghanistan for Iraq envoy gig: ‘Blood on their hands’",
    "text": "President Biden has been slammed for trying to elevate a State Department official who failed to protect US allies in Afghanistan to a key Middle East ambassadorship. Biden, 81, announced Jan. 25 he was nominating Tracey Ann Jacobson, 59, to be the next US ambassador to Iraq, with the Senate expected to consider her appointment later this month. As the Taliban closed in on Kabul and US forces prepared to withdraw in August 2021, Jacobson — a former envoy to Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kosovo — was put in charge of what Biden called “a whole-of-government effort to process, transport, and relocate Afghan Special Immigrant Visa applicants and other Afghan allies” who had assisted Western forces during the 20-year-long conflict with the Islamic fundamentalists. However, more than two years after the last American soldier left Afghanistan, thousands of those same allies are still stranded in the Taliban-ruled nation — under constant threat of exposure and execution. Umbrella group Islamic Resistance in Iraq responsible for strike that killed 3 troops in Jordan: US Former Marine Chad Robichaux, who helped spearhead one of the largest civilian evacuation efforts from Afghanistan and founded the Mighty Oaks Foundation to support veterans, said Jacobson was among those who “still have blood on their hands” from the botched withdrawal. “Jacobson failed to ensure 150,000 of our wartime allies got contractually promised SIVs (Special Immigrant Visas) [and] left [them] behind after 20 years of service to America, only to be persecuted and hunted down to be killed by the Taliban,” he said. “The White House nominating Tracey Jacobson as the new ambassador to Iraq is a new line on a growing list of embarrassments for America, a slap in the face to our veterans and allies, and further jeopardizes our national security,” added Robichaux, credited with helping to rescue around 17,000 people ahead of the Taliban reconquest. Retired Marine Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller, who was relieved of his duties in August 2021 after calling out the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan , wants Jacobson to admit the State Department failed. As Iran-backed militias attack Americans, Biden tries to save Tehran terrorists “If she can’t admit under oath that the State Department failed in its response to the Afghanistan evacuation, then she doesn’t deserve to represent the American people,” Scheller said. Since toppling the US-backed civilian government in Afghanistan, the Taliban is feared to have hunted down, tortured, and killed a number of American allies, according to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) “Tracey Jacobson failed American veterans and our Afghan allies when she and the Biden administration abandoned hundreds of thousands of our Afghan allies,” McCaul said in a statement Thursday. “If she is allowed to become the next US Ambassador to Iraq, the Democratic US Senate will be telling the American people – and the world – that there is no such thing as accountability or justice in the Biden administration.” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also blasted Jacobson’s nomination. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MORNING REPORT NEWSLETTER “Tracey Jacobson played a central role in one of the most unforgivable of those failures, the abandonment of vetted Afghans who had risked their lives for our security, and it will undoubtedly mar and endanger her nomination,” he told The Free Press . The chaotic pullout was further blighted by the deaths of 13 American soldiers in a suicide attack at Kabul’s international airport, as thousands of Afghans futilely tried to secure seats on flights out of the country. “I am president of the United States of America, and the buck stops with me,” Biden said at the time. “I am deeply saddened by the facts we now face, but I do not regret my decision.” This past February, a report released by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) blasted the withdrawal as “abrupt and uncoordinated,” leaving the impression the US “was simply handing Afghanistan over to a Taliban government-in-waiting,” A 2022 report by the House Foreign Affairs Committee found more than 1,000 Americans were also stranded in Afghanistan at the time of the pullout. The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com.",

    "text": "Islamabad: As the Israel-Hamas war enters Day 84, Pakistan has announced a ban on all celebrations for the new year. Pakistani caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar announced a ban on all types of celebrations for the new year, including NYE celebrations, to express solidarity with Palestine. PM Kakar urged the Pakistani people to refrain from celebrating the coming year and to show \\\"sobriety and humility\\\" for the New Year. \\\"Keeping in mind the seriously concerning situation in Palestine and to show solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters, there will be a strict ban by the government on holding any kind of event for New Year,\\\" stated the Pakistani PM. Since the start of the war on October 7, 2023, over 21,000 Palestinians have been killed across Gaza and West Bank at the hands of Israeli attacks. In this massive death toll, a majority of the deaths have been attributed to women and children. \\\"The whole Pakistani nation and the Muslim world are in a sheer state of anguish over the massacre of innocent children and genocide of unarmed Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank,\\\" Kakar added further. In Pakistan, the New Year celebrations are not big or grandeur in any way as various Islamic groups tend to try and stop all forms of festivities, sometimes forcefully. However, this year, the government has announced the ban. While addressing the nation, the Pakistani PM added that two aid packages have been dispatched to Palestine and a third one is on the way. Kakar added that Islamabad is also in talks with Jordan and Egypt to provide timely aid to Gaza and evacuate the injured. Fireworks Banned At UAE’s SharjahSharjah, the third largest emirate in the United Arab Emirates also announced a ban on fireworks for New Year's Eve celebrations. Taking to Facebook, Sharjah Police announced the ban on fireworks to express solidarity with their “Gazan brothers and sisters”. Anyone violating the ban would be charged with a fine.",
