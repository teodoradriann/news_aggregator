    "text": "Four Duke players scored in double figures, led by Jared McCain’s 24, to crush Queens Duke's Jared McCain drives against Queens' AJ McKee during Saturday's game. (Rob Kinnan/USA Today Sports Images) Advertisement DURHAM – After back-to-back losses to Arkansas and Georgia Tech, Duke coach Jon Scheyer sat down for a one-on-one conversation with Jared McCain .\nThe freshman guard had shot a combined 4 of 17 in the two games, tallying just 11 points as the Blue Devils hit a funk.\nThe message? I believe in you.\nConsider it received.\nMcCain poured in a career-high 24 points as Duke pummeled Queens 106-69 on Saturday afternoon at Cameron Indoor Stadium, the third time in the four games since that chat the guard has scored 21 or more.\nThe hot stretch comes at a key time for the No. 16 Blue Devils (9-3) as they return from a nine-day holiday break, finish non-conference play and get guard Tyrese Proctor back from injury. Duke looked rusty at times early but committed just nine turnovers, blocked 11 shots and scored 33 points in transition to cruise past the Royals, in their second year as a Division I program.\n“I don’t think he had ever been through something like that in his life,” Scheyer said of McCain. “Don’t get me wrong, he’s lost games before, but at that level, on that stage. I think he was questioning some things.\n“He doubled down on his work. His attitude, he was meant to come to Duke. I’m talking mentally, he’s as tough as can be. That’s showed in how he’s responded. There’s going to be ups and downs, but he’s mentally tough enough to handle anything.”\nMcCain showed that in the game’s opening minutes, erasing any worries that Duke would lose the momentum built in a Dec. 20 win against Baylor.\nThe freshman guard was outscoring Queens by himself at the under-12 media timeout, pouring in 14 early points to pace the Blue Devils.\nHe stole a pass in the backcourt, turned around and buried a 3-pointer to put Duke up 11-4. On the next possession, he made the extra pass to a wide-open Caleb Foster , who buried a 3-pointer in the corner to force a Queens timeout.\n“I’m getting more comfortable with college basketball,” said McCain, who was 4 of 9 from 3-point land. “I knew it was going to be a roller coaster with ups and downs, especially for a freshman. I’m just trying to stay as consistent as possible and be myself out there.”\nAdded Scheyer: “I love how ready he was to shoot tonight. That’s what I love to see. … Jared has just played with a confidence level and swagger on the offensive end. And on the defensive end, he’s helped with both sides of the ball. The confidence and edge he came out with was important for our team and a huge reason we got the lead.”\nDuke guard Tyrese Proctor, middle, makes a pass through traffic and around defense from Queens' AJ McKee. (Rob Kinnan/USA Today Sports Images) Duke had four finish in double figures, led by McCain’s 24. Sophomore Kyle Filipowski scored 19 and added a career-high five blocks, Foster had 13 – 10 of which came in the second half – and Mark Mitchell chipped in 10 for the Blue Devils.\nProctor had 9 points in his return after missing three games with an ankle injury, entering midway through the first half to a rousing applause from the Cameron crowd. He drove in for a layup about three minutes later, going down hard and drawing a foul for his first points of the day.\nScheyer said they aimed to play Proctor for 15 minutes. He ended up on the court for almost 18, turning in what Scheyer called an “efficient” performance.\n“It felt good,” the Australian said. “Obviously we didn’t rush it back. But I felt comfortable, the trainers felt comfortable, Coach felt comfortable. It was just the right game on the schedule for me.”\nIt was Proctor’s 3-pointer in transition midway through the second half that gave Duke a 23-point lead – at the time, its largest of the day – and seemed to knock any remaining energy out of Queens.\nIt took some lumps to get there, though.\nDuke had just seven assists on 19 field goals in the first half, good for 36.8% – far below the 62.2% clip of the past three games. That improved in the second half, finishing at 60%.\nThey showed signs of crisp ball movement, especially in transition and off turnovers. After Queens coughed up the ball to start the second half, Filipowski and McCain passed several times between each other before the big man finished underneath. A similar sequence occurred four minutes later, with Filipowski scoring off an assist from Proctor.\n“We had some missed opportunities where we needed to find our guys and hit them,” Filipowski said. “But it’s been really good the past five games seeing the way our team is going and how our offense is going just with how we’re sharing it and the flow. We’ve been working hard on that and it’s paying off.”\nDuke moves back into ACC play with a home showdown Tuesday night against Syracuse. With Notre Dame, Pittsburgh and Georgia Tech to follow, there’s a chance the Blue Devils don’t face another ranked opponent until a Jan. 27 home date with Clemson.\n“This game was important for us to take the next step together,” Scheyer said.\nTIP-INS: Duke’s 11 blocks and 11 steals were both season highs.… It’s the first time Duke has scored 100 points since posting 103 against South Carolina State on Dec. 14, 2021. … It’s the eighth game this season the Blue Devils have recorded fewer than 10 turnovers. … Mitchell continued his 3-point slide, clunking a first-half long ball to extend his streak of 15 straight misses. He’s 1 of 20 from deep on the year. … Scheyer recalled how he had said he thought Proctor could’ve played in the Baylor game. “I don’t think that was right. It’s taken him some time to get back. We’ve wanted to make sure he was ready to go. He looked great tonight. I was happy with how he did.”\ntrending {{ article.title }} premium-icon\n{{ timeAgo(article.live_at) }}",

Addressing health concerns affecting humans, animals, and birds, he advocates for natural farming methods and the establishment of a specialized agricultural university. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Lucknow | Updated: 19-07-2024 16:44 IST | Created: 19-07-2024 16:44 IST - Country: - India Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday highlighted the adverse effects of excessive fertilizer use on humans, animals, and birds, stressing the need to revisit ancient farming practices to resolve health issues. Adityanath pointed out the stark difference between modern farming practices and those from ancient times, urging a re-examination of historical methods. He warned that excessive fertilizer use acts as a 'slow poison,' affecting both humans and wildlife, while addressing a natural farming program. He announced plans to establish a dedicated agricultural university for natural farming in Uttar Pradesh.

    "text": "On the day Hamas terrorists staged their horrifying massacre last October, a 25-year-old Arsenal fan from North London was due to celebrate the Jewish festival of Simchat Torah with friends in Tel Aviv.\nBut when rocket-alert sirens began wailing relentlessly throughout the city at 6.30am, he immediately realised his plans would have to change.\n‘When the sirens went off, it was just instant: “What is going on?” ’ Aaron recalls.\nIt wasn’t long before he discovered the awful truth: as a barrage of 3,000 rockets rained down on Israeli towns and cities, Hamas fighters had breached the barrier that separated Gaza from Israel and were making their way in a motley assortment of cars, trucks and even parachutes to carry out a blood-crazed killing spree.\nThe terrorists massacred a total of 1,200 Jews that day and, as a UN report confirmed last week, systematically sexually assaulted Israeli women, violating at least two corpses.\nIn the wake of the October 7 attacks, Israel mobilised 360,000 reservists, and among them were scores of dual-nationality British-Israeli citizens\nLondoners Aaron and another soldier. Aaron was determined to join the IDF, and spent 18 months proving he had what it takes to serve in one of Israel’s most elite units\nAnd so, when his phone rang at 10.15am, Aaron — a university business student and military reservist — was not surprised to find that the caller was the commander of his unit, ordering him to report to base.\nHis body coursing with adrenaline, Aaron had no time to say goodbye to his friends or call his parents in London before jumping on his motorbike and racing south to join his comrades in Maglan, an elite special forces unit.\nOne of the most secretive units in the IDF, it is known for conducting high-risk operations deep behind enemy lines, and counts former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett among its past members.\nIn the wake of the October 7 attacks, Israel mobilised 360,000 reservists, and among them were scores of dual-nationality British-Israeli citizens.\nI met two of them this week, and their tales of life on the front line were in sharp contrast to the peaceful upbringings they enjoyed in suburban Britain.\nAaron was born in London and ‘made aliyah’ — the process of a Jewish person moving to Israel — in 2018 when he was 18, leaving his family in the UK.\nHe was determined to join the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), and spent 18 months proving he had what it takes to serve in one of Israel’s most elite units. He tackled arduous assault courses and participated in exercises, including ‘sprints up and down sand dunes, big crawling tasks and running with a stretcher’.\nBut despite his extensive training and experience, when we spoke in Tel Aviv this week, Aaron admitted to a deep sense of foreboding as he prepared for battle.\n‘We had never imagined an issue of this scale,’ he says. ‘My journey to base was scary because I had no idea what awaited me.\n‘All I knew was that I needed to get there as quickly as possible. The roads were completely empty, and traffic lights were being zoomed past by everyone. It felt like some sort of apocalypse.’\nAaron was one of the first soldiers scrambled to confront the threat from Hamas, and in the early days of Israel’s military response there were shortages of vital equipment.\nIn the absence of a bulletproof vest, Aaron shoved ‘magazines, a medical kit and grenades’ into the pockets of his flak jacket before getting into an armoured car to drive to the front.\nFor almost five days, he fought to repel some of the 3,000 bloodthirsty Hamas militants who had invaded Israel.\nHis team’s first stop was a kibbutz in Sderot, where at least 50 civilians, including a minibus full of 15 senior citizens and 20 police officers, had been massacred. When Aaron arrived at the kibbutz, corpses littered the streets, and death lurked round every corner.\nThe soldiers’ task was made all the more difficult by the fact that terrified Israeli civilians and other IDF units were present along with the terrorists in Sderot, a city of 30,000, less than a mile from the Gazan border.\nArmed with M4 assault rifles — which can take out targets with a three-round burst from up to 600 metres away — Aaron’s team engaged in deadly gunfights with militants.\n‘You don’t always know where people are when they are shooting,’ he says. ‘They can be 100 metres away, hidden between a few bushes or in between trees. War is loads of confusion. You have no idea what’s going on around you at any point in time.’\nBetween his missions, Aaron would catch a few hours of sleep ‘whenever I had a moment and wherever I found myself . . . on the ground, under bushes or in bomb shelters’.\nPalestinian militants celebrate beside an Israeli tank on the Gaza Strip. According to the Hamas-run health ministry, more than 30,000 Palestinians have died since October 7\nFighting alongside him was Captain Yuval Halivni, 30, who left his wife and two-year-old son at home to dash to the battlefield. ‘We served in the same platoon together,’ says Aaron. ‘Very much side by side over those initial days in October. Yuval was the last person I said “Goodbye” to, and I said “See you there” before I drove to Sderot.’\nTwo days later, on October 9, Yuval was shot dead during a gunfight.\nAaron’s mission escalated to a whole new level on October 27 when he became one of a handful of Brits sent to fight on the front line as Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza began. In all, he spent two-and-a-half months there, fighting terrorists and searching for the hostages.\nAlso serving in Gaza was North Londoner Edward, 22, a Spurs fan and reservist paratrooper in the Israeli special forces.\nLike Aaron, he refused to give his real name amid concern that his family in Britain could be targeted. Some pro-Palestinian campaigners have demanded Brits be prohibited from serving in the IDF and, while the Foreign Office has made it clear that the UK respects the rights of dual nationals to fight in ‘legitimately recognised armed forces’, this hasn’t stopped the militants.\n‘Friends of mine who have said [publicly] they are in the IDF have been crucified for it,’ says Edward. ‘They have received death threats and their families have been tracked down.’\nIn one recent incident, reported by the Mail, a Jewish university chaplain in Leeds was forced into hiding with his young family after receiving death threats and warnings that his wife would be raped over his role as an IDF reservist.\nEdward admits he has been shocked by the ‘virulent anti-Semitism’ that has flourished in Britain in the aftermath of October 7.\n‘[After the massacre] groups around the world took the opportunity to completely, outwardly and vocally express their hatred for Jewish people,’ he observes.\n‘It was very reminiscent of the stories I had heard from my grandparents. Jews being branded for being Jews. Businesses being shut down and boycotted just because of their Jewish connection.\n‘It’s crazy to me that we have regressed so much [as a society] that people [are now] praising Bin Laden . . . and chanting “From the river to the sea” without even knowing what it means.’\nEdward, who left his family to move to Israel aged 16 and joined the army two years later in 2020, adds: ‘It was an honour to come here and serve in the IDF and protect the citizens of the state.’\nHe had been discharged from active duty two months before October 7, and was holidaying in the U.S. as the assault unfolded.\nThe call came at 2am American time. ‘My commander said: “You have to get back to Israel now.”\nSome 247 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the outbreak of war. Pictured: The scene at Ichilov hospital in Tel Aviv following the Hamas attack\n‘I didn’t understand what was going on. So I went online and started seeing the videos. Within 48 hours, I had booked a ticket back to Israel.’\nAfter a month of intensive training, Edward was deployed to Gaza. ‘Our goal was breaking down Hamas infrastructure and uprooting it, because much of it was underground. The first time I saw a Hamas terror tunnel, it felt surreal. They are just these dank, dark holes in the ground.\n‘After we had cleared them, you could smell the stench of dead terrorists coming out of the tunnels for days.\n‘But honestly, we found so many [tunnels] and destroyed so many of them that it felt normal seeing them after a while.\n‘Often we would see the entrance of the tunnels and discuss among ourselves what a horrible existence it must have been to live inside them.\n‘We actually captured some terrorists who were inside, and they spoke to us of not having food, water or connection to their commanders. So they just came out and surrendered.’\nEdward also recalls how the Hamas fighters would operate in ways which endangered Palestinian civilians.\n‘Warfare in Gaza is completely asymmetrical,’ he says. ‘You are trying to operate in the most methodical and straightforward way, but you’re dealing with an enemy that will attack you from anywhere and wear civilian clothing. It’s very difficult to keep track of where your enemy is. It’s gritty and it’s tiring.’\nHe described the battlefield and Gaza as a ‘warped dystopian reality’, with signs of Hamas’s ‘malevolent’ and controlling presence everywhere.\n‘It’s very threatening — things like cameras on every street, tunnels in people’s gardens, and grenades in children’s bedroom drawers; all things I personally saw and found. I found many children’s books with anti-Israel and anti-Zionist writings.’\nIn the UK, Israel’s operations in Gaza have become increasingly controversial. The UN, widely accused of being pro-Palestine, has been warned that Israel is inflicting ‘collective punishment’.\nBut Israel has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and the British-Israeli soldiers I spoke to expressed frustration about the way the IDF and Israel is being portrayed in the Western media.\nThey insist that British people who have never been to Israel or Palestine, or fought in war, cannot fully grasp the situation on the ground.\n‘Morality was always front and foremost in my mind,’ says Edward. ‘There is enormous work done by the IDF to ensure things are done with minimum civilian casualties.\n‘I watched as we entered civilian-populated areas and literally announced our presence. Guys with megaphones would say: “The IDF is currently operating in this area — if any civilians who haven’t previously evacuated are still here, then please leave.”\n‘There were designated zones with heavy concentrations of civilians that we weren’t allowed to go close to. Interestingly enough, these were the areas which had the highest concentration of Hamas soldiers.\n‘There was a school near our base of operations that was full of civilians. [Hamas] used it as a hideout . . . because it knew we weren’t going to bomb a school with all those civilians still inside.\n‘About 5 per cent of the time it is how it is portrayed [in the media], with all the explosions and death and running around and clearing tunnels. But that is a very small fraction of the day-to-day.\n‘A lot of war is just things like holding the line, planning, recuperating and performing guard duty.’\nLike Edward, Aaron testifies to the moral standards of the IDF and the difficulty of combating Hamas and its guerilla tactics, including using civilians as human shields.\nHamas fighters even lure Israeli soldiers towards hidden explosives and booby traps by using speakers to play audio of people crying and speaking in Hebrew.\n‘We are lucky the IDF is so well-practised, in terms of debating what is right and what is wrong,’ Aaron says. ‘We are in a brutal, very difficult moral war. Hamas is playing psychological tricks, notably with the hostages.\n‘There are moral difficulties, but I feel we [the IDF] went about them in the right way.’\nAccording to the Hamas-run health ministry — which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants — more than 30,000 Palestinians have died since October 7.\nMillions more Palestinians have been forced to flee their homes and are living in refugee camps near the Egyptian border.\nThis plays on the minds of both soldiers, but they insist Israel has no choice but to destroy Hamas.\n‘Many people have experienced, and are experiencing, immense suffering because of this war,’ Edward says.\n‘This is something that is tearing both nations apart. I don’t know a single Israeli who would have chosen this war.\n‘But after what we saw on October 7, it is vital to the survival of this state and the Jewish people that Hamas is not able to build in the way it did and do what it did to us [again].’\nSome 247 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the outbreak of war at the time of publication. This weighs heavy on the hearts of both Aaron and Edward.\n‘I find it wild being 25 and knowing you have had so many friends who have died,’ Aaron admits.\nHe feels the loss of two friends particularly deeply: Daniel Kastiel, 24, and Itay Moreno, 24, who were killed together on October 11 while fighting terrorists on Zikim beach, three miles north of Gaza City.\nFor Edward, one of the most painful days of the war was when the youngest member of his battalion was killed in a surprise attack, while he was guarding base camp.\n‘One of my commanders had returned to camp, and from 20 metres out we could see that something was really wrong,’ he says. ‘[The young man] was almost grey.\n‘The captain told us what had happened and said: “He’s not with us any more.” But he died a hero, fighting for his country.’\n***\nRead more at DailyMail.co.uk",

    "text": "Low snowfall and warmer than usual temperatures have forced the early closure of the winter alpine operations at Manning Park Resort. Sunday (March 24) will be the last day of alpine operations. “Despite the heroic and at times herculean efforts of our alpine team this season, Mother Nature has dealt us and many of our industry colleagues, significant blows with the abnormally low snowfall combined with unseasonably warm weather,” said MPR general manager Vern Schram. “Despite all our efforts, we simply don’t have enough snow to safely continue our alpine operations.” While the climate was cruel to alpine skiers, the hill has been blessed with very favourable Nordic conditions this winter and will continue to offer patrons a few more days of operations. Nordic operations will be closed from March 25 to 29 and will reopen for one final weekend this season, from March 30 to April 1. “I want to take a moment to thank you, our valued guests, for your tremendous support during a season that provided many twists and turns and made us wonder if we would have a winter season at all,” Schram said in an email to resort guests and supporters. “Your patience and understanding as we strived to provide you with the best possible experience during these difficult times, was appreciated more than you can imagine. Your positive comments throughout the season, pushed us even more to keep the season going as long as we possibly could. Our team truly wishes we could have made the season last longer for your enjoyment.” For more information on the ski resort visit [manningpark.com. ](https://manningpark.com/)",

    "text": "While most of Grand Valley’s campuses went remote due to heavy snowfalls on Thursday, the GVSU Police Academy proceeded with its 54th graduating class celebration as planned. It took some alterations to the agenda, but the academy made a point to hold its graduation ceremony in person at the Loosemore Auditorium on the Pew Grand Rapids Campus.\n“The recruits are going to be expected to go in and work every day, regardless of whether there’s snow or anything else,” said Geoffrey Collard, director of the GVSU Police Academy, referring to the commitment to keeping the ceremony in person. “It’s really the first day of a true sacrifice in the profession.”\nThirty-nine of the 41 recruits to go through the 54th academy graduated, with injury preventing two from completing their training. All 39 of the graduates were sponsored through the academy or have received conditional offers of employment from law enforcement agencies across the state.\n“Our program not only incorporates the fundamental training in policing, but we’ve also, over the years, started to evolve that curriculum into incorporating a number of different contemporary approaches that are now appropriate with the world in which you will face as a graduate and move into your roles as police officers,” said Paul Stansbie, GVSU professor and former associate dean of the College of Education and Community Innovation.\nStansbie highlighted education in unbiased policing, decision-making, mental health training, law enforcement and the LGBTQ-plus community, and mediation and restorative practices as additional hours put in beyond the minimum standards required by MCOLES.",

    "text": "Cobertura completa de CES 2025 Lea y vea nuestra cobertura completa de CES acá Actualizado hace menos de hace una hora Tabla de contenidos Tabla de contenidos Un teléfono inteligente con un reloj inteligente incorporado La batería más grande que he visto en un teléfono\nPor Joe Maring de DT en inglés desde Las Vegas\nUna de mis cosas favoritas de las grandes ferias comerciales como CES es todo lo extraño que puedes encontrar. Es genial ver grandes anuncios de marcas conocidas, pero a veces es más divertido encontrar algo completamente extraño que no esperabas. Eso es precisamente lo que sucedió cuando visité el stand de Oukatel en CES 2025 .\nRecommended Videos Oukitel no es un nombre familiar en los EE. UU., aunque la compañía de 18 años tiene un historial de creación de algunos de los teléfonos Android más extraños y extravagantes del mercado. Vi dos de ellos en el CES de este año, los cuales son hilarantemente exagerados.\nRelated Samsung estrena en CES 2025 The Frame Pro y su panel más gama alta Un teléfono inteligente con un reloj inteligente incorporado Joe Maring / DT El primer teléfono Oukitel que vi fue el Oukitel WP200 Pro. El teléfono en sí es un asunto bastante estándar. Tiene una pantalla AMOLED de 6,7 pulgadas, un chipset MediaTek Dimensity 8200 y una cámara principal de 108MP. ¡Todo es bueno! Sin embargo, la magia del WP200 Pro es la pantalla en la parte posterior. No es el primer teléfono que hemos visto con una pantalla trasera, aunque es uno de los primeros que he visto en el que puedes separar esa pantalla y usarla como un reloj inteligente.\nPresione el botón pequeño debajo de la pantalla trasera y se apagará para usarlo independientemente del teléfono. A continuación, puedes meterlo en una correa para usarlo como reloj o, si eso no es suficiente, ponértelo en la oreja y usarlo como un auricular Bluetooth.\nLa pantalla trasera/smartwatch/auricular tiene una pantalla táctil totalmente funcional con su propia interfaz de usuario y software. Muestra la hora y las notificaciones, tiene sus propias aplicaciones y ofrece seguimiento de la actividad y el sueño. ¿Es el mejor smartwatch que encontrarás en el mercado? Probablemente no. Pero el hecho de que pueda vivir en la parte posterior de tu teléfono (y funcionar como un auricular excesivo si lo deseas) es exactamente el tipo de inventiva extraña que me encanta ver en CES.\nLa batería más grande que he visto en un teléfono Joe Maring /DT El segundo, y aún más ridículo, teléfono Oukitel que vi fue el Oukitel WP100 Titan. ¿Qué hace que este se destaque? Mucho .\nPara empezar, está la batería, que tiene una capacidad gigantesca de 33,000 mAh. Sí, has leído bien: una batería de 33.000 mAh. Para contextualizar, el nuevo OnePlus 13 nos impresionó recientemente con su batería de 6,000 mAh, que es más grande que la batería de 5,000 mAh del Galaxy S24 Ultra y la batería de 4,700 mAh del Google Pixel 9 Pro . Con una batería tan absurdamente grande, Oukitel promete hasta seis meses de tiempo de espera.\nComo era de esperar de un teléfono con una batería de 33.000 mAh, el Oukitel WP100 Titan es pesado . Se siente como un ladrillo real, y aparentemente sabiendo esto, Oukitel agregó una correa de mano en el marco izquierdo para ayudarlo a sostener el teléfono.\nJoe Maring / DT Pero eso no es todo. Dale la vuelta al WP100 Titan y encontrarás una luz de camping en la parte trasera. Tiene múltiples niveles de brillo y puede emitir una señal SOS si estás en la naturaleza y necesitas ayuda. La luz alcanza hasta 1,200 lúmenes, y puedo confirmar que es increíblemente brillante, especialmente cuando accidentalmente presionas el botón para encender la luz mientras la miras directamente.\nJoe Maring / DT Por último, pero no menos importante, está quizás la parte más loca del WP100 Titan: un proyector incorporado. Está en la parte superior del teléfono (el pequeño cuadrado negro que puedes ver en la foto de arriba) y proyecta hasta 100 lúmenes con una frecuencia de actualización de 120 Hz. Oukitel lo estaba demostrando en su stand de CES, y aunque ciertamente no es el mejor proyector que he visto, se veía más que lo suficientemente bueno para uno que puedes llevar contigo a donde sea que lleves tu teléfono.\nJoe Maring /DT ¿Necesitas un teléfono con un reloj inteligente incorporado? ¿Qué tal uno con una batería de 33,000 mAh y un proyector? Es casi seguro que no; Sé que estos no son teléfonos que usaría como mi conductor diario. Aún así, siempre me encanta ver cómo fabricantes como Oukitel intentan destacar. Cada vez es más difícil hacerlo en 2025, pero parece que Oukitel no tendrá ningún problema con eso durante un tiempo.\nRecomendaciones del editor Poco ha anunciado el teléfono más genial y geek de CES 2025 Usé uno de los teléfonos Android más ridículos de 2024",
