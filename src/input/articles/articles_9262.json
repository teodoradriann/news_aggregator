Sneaker waves, waves coming in further than we normally see,\" said Jane, who came to Half Moon Bay from Santa Cruz.\nDozens of people showed up at Frances Beach in Half Moon Bay to witness the huge waves. There was some debris on the shore and, despite potential danger, some people told us they couldn’t pass up the opportunity.\n\"Yeah, it’s dangerous, but you have to keep yourself away from that. At the same time, you can enjoy this,\" said Prashant, who was visiting from India.\nHigh wave warnings and advisories are in effect along the entire California coast until 3 a.m. Friday. But the larger-than-usual waves are exactly what local surfers are looking forward to.\n\"We had some people go out. They’re competing for a photo contest, actually. Yeah, they’re really hyped about the awesome waves and the giant swell that’s coming right now,\" said Jackson Fisk, with Mavericks Surf Company.\nFeatured\narticle Evacuation warnings lifted after high surf and flooding shut down Santa Cruz, coastal areas High surf warnings and advisories are in effect along the entire California coast as waves are expected to break up to 40 feet high. As of Thursday afternoon, reports from the Bay Area's coastal buoys were showing waves just under 30 feet off both the Sonoma County coast and Monterey Bay.\n\"It’s the biggest storm system we’ve seen here in a handful of years, maybe even decades. So, there’s a local contingency that was out there and then there’s a pretty good size of international crews that flew into the surf at Mavericks today,\" said Luca Padua, a pro surfer from Half Moon Bay.\nOfficials say breaking waves can be dangerous, sweeping people away from jetties and docks nearby. Padua says even skilled surfers take precautions and wear special gear. With another storm on the way, he says they&apos;ll also pass on riding some waves to stay safe.\n\"Tomorrow the swell is down but the wind and rain are up. The following days there may be some more clean surf after that, but we’re going to stay out of the water tomorrow,\" said Padua.\nHigh surf can also cause minor flooding in coastal areas. A coastal flood advisory has been issued and will remain in effect until Friday at 2 p.m.\nBREAKING NEWS Breaking news delivered fast\nBy clicking Sign Up, I confirm that I have read and agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service .",

Para que puedas cultivas los tuyos, te compartimos [el truco de los expertos para enraizar un árbol de limón en maceta para que crezca fuerte.](https://www.radioformula.com.mx/estilo-de-vida/2024/7/4/arbol-de-limon-el-truco-de-los-expertos-para-que-se-llene-de-frutos-en-menos-de-dos-anos-823180.html) En la actualidad muchas personas buscan tener sus propios huertos urbanos en casa, ya que buscan cultivar sus frutas y verduras en casa. Sin embargo, algunas especies pueden ser más difíciles de cuidar, como ocurre con los árboles frutales. ¿Cómo puedo plantar un árbol de limón? Si quieres plantar tu propio árbol de limón, lo único que necesitas es tener unas cuantas semillas obtenidas del interior de esta fruta. Sólo necesitas colocarlas en un papel húmedo y cubrirlas con otro en las mismas condiciones. El secreto para que la semilla germine es mantenerlo húmedo por lo que tendrás que revisarlo de forma continua y añadir un poco de agua cuando sea necesario. Te podría interesar Cuando notes que las semillas ya germinaron, deberás transportarlas a un pequeño envase que deberá tener un agujero en el fondo para que circule el agua. El punto es que puedas rellenarlo con tierra y colocar en él este brote. Una vez que las semillas comiencen a salir por el agujero será tiempo de trasplantarlas a una maceta. ¿Cómo enraizar un árbol de limón en maceta para que crezca fuerte? Lo primero que debes hacer para enraizar un árbol de limón en una maceta es asegurarte de que esta tenga al menos 45 centímetros de diámetro y que tenga orificios de drenaje. Una de las mejores opciones son las macetas de terracota o barro, ya que son porosas y permiten que el árbol respire mejor y el agua se evapore más rápidamente. Una vez que has elegido la maceta perfecta, debes preparar la tierra que puede ser una especialmente diseñada para cítricos o plantas que prefieren un pH ácido y hacer un hueco en el medio. Luego toma la semilla germinada y remueve con cuidado el papel para luego colocarla en el hoyo que previamente preparaste y cubre los alrededores de la planta con tierra hidratada. Cuando hayas terminado este proceso, debes colocar la maceta a la luz directa del sol por lo menos cinco horas al día, por lo que deberás colocar la maceta en el que reciba luz de forma continúa y regarlo sólo una vez por semana, aumentando la frecuencia en la temporada de calor.",

    "text": "WashU hosted its inaugural Lab Supply Swap on the WashU Medical Campus in April. The successful four-day event recirculated supplies and delivered cost savings to WashU labs, indirectly supporting cutting-edge research to cure diseases, improve patient care and solve other complex challenges. The swap also supported local nonprofit organizations.\nThe Lab Supply Swap was planned through close collaboration among the Office of Sustainability, WashU Medicine Operations & Facilities Management Department, Environmental Health & Safety, and members of the WashU EnviroCorps.\nThe team collected surplus lab supplies from WashU laboratories over a two-day period. With guidance from Environmental Health & Safety staff, Sustainability and EnviroCorps staff catalogued the supplies and equipment. These were made available for any WashU lab to pick up free of charge. The majority of supplies were new consumables still in their original packaging.\nIn total, 44 WashU laboratories contributed items, while 86 WashU laboratories picked up supplies. The total value of items recirculated to WashU laboratories exceeded $125,000. By the conclusion of the four-day event, 1,625 pounds of lab supplies and equipment had been redistributed to WashU labs. The remaining 189 pounds of supplies, valued over $8,000, were donated to local organizations, including Just Used Tech, KidSmart and the St. Louis Zoo.\nThe team surveyed participating labs and received overwhelmingly positive feedback.\n“Our lab was able to donate a large amount of cryovials that were unused, yet we have had challenges distributing them to labs in need,” Jessica Klette, for Medical Oncology Clinical Trials, said. “The swap was an efficient way to match our surplus with labs who could use the items.”\n “The lab supply swap was an excellent resource as I set up my new lab — providing needed supplies and saving our lab money,” Dr. Stephen Persaud, assistant professor of Pathology and Immunology, said.\n“Based on the success of the inaugural lab supply swap, we anticipate hosting similar events on an annual or biannual basis as staff capacity allows,” Phil Valko, assistant vice chancellor for Sustainability, highlights.\nWashU became a host site for the Campus Compact EnviroCorps program, the first nationwide AmeriCorps program dedicated to campus-based, community-led environmental action, in September 2024. WashU EnviroCorps members supporting the Green Labs Program , circularity, and solid waste pollution prevention programs were integral to planning and hosting the Lab Supply Swap.\n“The value of recirculated goods from the inaugural swap exceeds the annual budget of the WashU EnviroCorps program,” Valko said. “The savings directly accrue to WashU labs and departments and represent one of many ways our phenomenal EnviroCorps team has added value to WashU and our community partner organizations.”",

    "text": "After its abundant biodiversity has been stewarded by First Nations for thousands of years and it’s been eyed for pristine parkland for a century, parts of an island off B.C.’s Central Coast are closer to being protected forever. At a March 13 ceremony in Victoria, Tula Foundation founders Eric Peterson and Christina Munck announced they would be transferring two parcels, totalling 55 acres, of Calvert Island to the BC Parks Foundation. The land will be incorporated into the island’s Hakai Luxvbalis Conservancy, which is collaboratively managed by the province and the Heiltsuk and Wuikinuxv First Nations. The founders also announced a donation of $92 million to Tula in support of the organization advancing its scientific innovation. READ MORE: [B.C. couple gives away last $92M, wants others to pick up the baton](https://www.vicnews.com/news/bc-couple-gives-away-last-92m-wants-others-to-pick-up-the-baton-7329547) Peterson called Calvert Island the most iconic place on B.C.’s coast as it features breathtaking beaches and incredible biodiversity. It’s also a sacred place for First Nations, he said, noting inhabitants have gathered on the land for over 10,000 years. “It’s not just any piece of real estate, it’s an extraordinary place,” the Tula founder said, highlighting the island’s complex coastlines carved by glaciation and how it sits among a labyrinth of land and sea along the Central Coast. Those comments were echoed by Andy Day, the BC Parks Foundation’s CEO, as he touted the incredible stretch of beach and ecology that make up the donated plots. With the site also hosting rich old-growth forests, Day said the Calvert lands are emblematic of the province’s ecological bounty. Species are under threat around the world, Day said, adding 70 per cent of the world’s biodiversity has been lost in the last 50 years. Protecting land in perpetuity though actions like the Calvert donation is among the only ways to address that crisis, he said. “Along with First Nations people and the province of British Columbia, we will make sure that it continues to be managed responsibly for all British Columbians to enjoy and for all the species in that area to enjoy,” Day said. The CEO hopes the move inspires people to connect with B.C.’s natural areas and spurs other land donations. The gifted plots have had a complex and fought history, Peterson explained. Archaeological findings show signs of human settlement on the island from 13,000 years ago and around 5,000 years back, it hosted industrial-scale shellfish agriculture with clam gardens, processing areas, drying racks and trading sites. First Nations oral histories recount a settlement known as Luxvbalis that was visited by Captain Vancouver. Luxvbalis was devastated by smallpox epidemic of 1862 and many of the dead were abandoned in one of the island’s bays. “There’s many souls from many Nations that have never been properly mourned in this place,” Peterson said. The donated lands were surveyed after the First World War and a group envisioned it as protected parkland around 1925. The sites welcomed gathering and recreation for the next 40 years as they were effectively used as a park, but were then bought after the protections were never made official, Peterson said. The sites were then logged for their cedar giants before they were taken over in the ’90s to host a beach resort. That resort created friction with First Nations, other neighbours and BC Parks as the area was closed off from the public. Those tensions escalated in the 2000s under a new U.S. owner who gated the land. Since Tula bought the plots in 2009 and reopened them to the public, Peterson said he’s thrilled by their current partnership with neighbouring First Nations and he hopes to start conversations with them and all levels of government on transferring a third Calvert property. “They can be assured now that the future of these two parcels is secured for everyone to enjoy,” Peterson said. The Tula Foundation’s Hakai Institute hosts an ecological observatory on Calvert Island that has opened research opportunities to those like Brian Starzomski. He’s one of the many University of Victoria researchers to study at the facility, and said the chance to work there has been lifechanging for scores of students. “The most amazing things would happen at this place,” he said, recounting scientists from diverse disciplines debating the origins of Calvert’s geography while they dined together at the island. “So many great research programs and papers came out of these discussions, it’s one of Eric and Christina’s great skills, they bring people together and support them with everything they need to do amazing things.” READ: [Citizen scientist’s fight for bird habitat access denied](https://www.vicnews.com/local-news/citizen-scientists-fight-for-bird-habitat-access-denied-7329150)",

    "text": "NASCAR Superstar Slams Formula 1 Fans, Claiming They Seek Attention Over Racing\nIn a shocking turn of events, NASCAR legend Kyle Busch has unleashed a scathing critique of Formula 1 fans, accusing them of prioritizing being in the spotlight rather than the actual racing. The world of Formula 1 is renowned for its luxury and glamour, attracting celebrities from various industries such as music, fashion, and film. With races held at prestigious circuits worldwide, Formula 1 is synonymous with opulence and extravagance. However, despite F1’s global appeal, NASCAR remains the dominant force in the United States.\nKyle Busch, a highly esteemed figure in NASCAR, highlighted the stark contrast between the two motorsport worlds. During an appearance on Bert Kreischer’s Something’s Burning, Busch attributed the disparity to “culture,” painting NASCAR enthusiasts as “rednecks” who race in circles, while labeling F1 as a domain of “sophisticated engineers and smart people” who navigate intricate tracks.\nEchoing Kreischer’s mention of the Monaco Grand Prix’s allure, Busch agreed that many attendees are not genuine fans but rather seek to bask in the event’s glamour. Drawing a comparison to the Super Bowl, Busch suggested that F1 spectators are more interested in being seen than in the actual sport, unlike NASCAR fans who genuinely immerse themselves in the experience.\nBusch went on to draw a vivid parallel between F1 and the Kentucky Derby, likening the atmosphere to a gathering where fashion and social status take precedence, dubbing it as “princess vibes.”\nAs the debate rages on between the worlds of NASCAR and Formula 1, Busch’s candid remarks have sparked controversy and ignited discussions about the true essence of motorsport fandom.\nStay tuned for more updates on the latest in Formula 1 and NASCAR.",
