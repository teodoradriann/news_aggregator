    "text": "If you are looking for cogent arguments, then there was no shortage of them from the banks this week in front of the Parliamentary committee looking into banking.\nThey are doing this because the Government has decided banks need some kind of reform and there is not enough competition.\nWhat they plan to do about it we don’t know, but it’s the same argument around telcos, and petrol, and supermarkets, and airlines.\nOf particular concern to the Government is the way the farmers are treated.\nThere is dispute within the banking community, like KiwiBank, Heartland Bank, SBS, and TSB, all say it's not fair, the regulation is troublesome, and the playing field is not flat.\nThe bigger players say things are fine. Of course they would say that. But between them, and if you want to add the non-bank lenders, there seems to be no shortage of options.\nThe defence is that farm bank lending is tough work and it's tough work because lending money to farmers carries risk. Returns from rural lending isn't as high as city lending.\nThe complaint about farmers having higher rates is because a lot of farms operate on flexible rates, not fixed.\nAll the banks talked of their market share. No one bank dominates and a number of banks have grown their books.\nNone of this is to defend the banks at the expense of the farmer, it's just to say that there doesn't appear to be one side overtly more right than the other.\nThe ANZ boss this week more broadly defended her bank's profits. She was on a hiding to nothing. She too was cogent, made sense, and put up a good explanation as to how banks work and what sort of return they need.\nIt will make no difference, which is the big problem we, or in this case the Government, has with big business.\nThey say there must be a lack of competition, profits are too high (without of course anyone defining what exactly is an acceptable profit) and so we will need rules, threats, and the Commerce Commission.\nBut I will tell you this for nothing - none of it will change.\nMy very broad conclusion for all these industries is we have an imperfect market, based partially, but in no small part, on the fact we are a tiny isolated country with five million people.\nWe think we should get better than we do and by being hoodwinked into thinking that, someone must be a robber baron.\nThey aren't, but it makes us feel better.\nTake your Radio, Podcasts and Music with you",

    "text": "Simone Biles [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/simone-arianne-biles/]‘ athletic influence has just gained her another acknowledgment. Biles made it to the recently released list of the most influential sports personalities from all across the globe by Sports Illustrated. As she returned with all the grace to the mat after the Tokyo setback, it appears that she will claim glory in every way possible. To prove her worth, she has gained a position that has not been captured for more than 16 years. Biles’ journey reveals a fact: the fact that he has consistently pushed limits. Moreover, her impeccable achievements in the athletic realm count way more than her historic medal count or eponymous skills. In Sports Illustrated’s 2024 Power List, Biles once again earned her place as one of the most influential figures in sports—the first time it has happened for an American Olympian in the last 16 years. Her name has rightfully gained a seat alongside the names of several other legends of the sports realm. Reshaping the conversation and thoughts surrounding the mental well-being of athletes, Biles stepped back in her sport, going against all the backlash and criticism that came her way. A topic once whispered about in locker rooms is now openly discussed on the world’s biggest stages way more often than before. [https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024-08-05T144115Z_1045065275_UP1EK8514SOWE_RTRMADP_3_OLYMPICS-2024-ARTISTICGYMNASTICS.jpg]Paris 2024 Olympics – Artistic Gymnastics – Women’s Floor Exercise Victory Ceremony – Bercy Arena, Paris, France – August 05, 2024. Simone Biles of United States celebrates with her medals. REUTERS/Hannah Mckay After her brave decision to prioritize her mental health at the Tokyo Olympics, Biles returned stronger, both physically and emotionally. And competing as an olympian in gymnastics at the age of 27 and earning four medals, she showed the world that vulnerability is a form of strength. With 11 Olympic medals and with the total count for World Championships and Olympics standing at 41, Biles unapologetically admitted the fact that she doesn’t keep a count of her medals. With five skills on her name, she was brutally honest, as she stated, “I would have to google,” when asked about her medal count. Simone Biles, with an unparalleled list of achievements, now graces her throne alongside groundbreaking athletes. Biles is on the same page as NBA legend LeBron James, golf king Tiger Woods, former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, and others, proving that she is unquestionably the G.O.A.T. of her sport. Moreover, she solidified her place in the broader legacy of Olympic legends similar to Michael Phelps. Wonder how? HAS SIMONE BILES REACHED MICHAEL PHELPS’ LEGENDARY STATUS IN SPORTS HISTORY? It was the Beijing Olympics that saw Michael Phelps [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/michael-phelps/] reach the zenith of his swimming career. With an unparalleled performance, it was after 2008 that Michael Phelps secured a spot in the power ranking list of Sports Illustrated. Phelps made it to the list just on the caliber of his Olympic performance. Since then, no other athlete has made it to the list as just an Olympian before Simone Biles, this year. [https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1624501452.jpg]BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA – AUGUST 18: Honoree Michael Phelps speaks onstage during the Harold & Carole Pump Foundation 2023 Gala at The Beverly Hilton on August 18, 2023 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Tiffany Rose/Getty Images for Harold & Carole Pump Foundation) While several NBA athletes have undoubtedly graced the Olympic stage, their names have been reflected on the list not solely because of their Olympic performance. Rather, it has been dependent upon the way they dominated their respective leagues. While Phelps left an indelible mark on swimming with his unmatched haul of 23 Olympic gold medals, Biles has carried the torch for gymnastics in her own right. Just as Beijing was Phelps’ land of dominance in 2008, Biles undoubtedly owned the City of Love as she won back-to-back four Olympic medals. This justifies the presence of her name in the list of the top fifty influential sportspersonas. Do you think Biles too has achieved the same level as that of Michael Phelps in her own realm?

Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below\nLinda Margolin Royal, a former advertising copywriter from Australia, was apprehensive about the January 2024 release of her debut novel, \"The Star on the Grave,\" given the rampant antisemitism worldwide today in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks against Israel.\nHer book, \"The Star on the Grave,\" is a fictional historical account of how her family was saved from the Holocaust by Chiune Sugihara , a heroic Japanese diplomat known as \"the Japanese Schindler.\"\nWhile Royal was elated to learn from her publisher, Affirm Press, that her book was the No. 1 Australian fiction debut in the month after its release, she told Fox News Digital that to this day, she can’t shake the eerie feeling she's reliving her own family’s history as she tells their story.\nISRAELI SOLDIER GRAVELY INJURED IN OCT. 7 TERROR ATTACK FINDS NEW FAITH, OFFERS HOPE TO OTHERS\nShe was struck, she said, by her own words: \"Jews run because we learn anyone can become a Jew-hater … Do you know what a betrayal that is?\"\nRoyal finished writing her book in Sept. 2023. When she reviewed it as it was going to print about a month later, she said she told her publisher, \"People are going to think I wrote this [book] post-Oct. 7 because of how chillingly relevant the sentiments are.\"\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\nSugihara’s only surviving son, Nobuki Sugihara, 75, shared with Fox News Digital the background of how his father saved many Jewish people , including Royal's own family, from death.\nIn 1940, when his father was serving as vice-consul for Japan in Lithuania and in Prague, European Jews came to him, fearing for their lives after the Nazis invaded, said Nobuki Sugihara.\nDefying governmental orders, the elder Sugihara surreptitiously issued 2,100 transit visas so the Jews could escape from Poland and Germany to the United States, Canada and Australia through Japan and Siberia in the Soviet Union.\nChinue Sugihara, standing, with his then-young son, Nobuki Sugihara. The elder Sugihara and others risked their lives and their professions to rescue Jewish refugees during the Holocaust.\nSugihara and another diplomat from the Netherlands, Jan Zwartendijk, risked their lives and their professions to rescue Jewish refugees, according to multiple sources. Zwartendijk did so despite being under Nazi rule by issuing destination visas to Curaçao, according to The Times of Israel.\nBoth men suffered negative consequences in their jobs for going against their superiors.\nSURVIVOR OF HAMAS TERROR ATTACK ON ISRAEL RECOUNTS PAIN, GRIEF OF LOSING ‘ANGEL’ BOYFRIEND ON OCT. 7\nIn 1985 and 1997, respectively, Sugihara and Zwartendijk were honored by Yad Vashem, The World Holocaust Remembrance Center, as The Righteous Among the Nations.\nThe Righteous Among the Nations is a title awarded to non-Jews who risked their lives to rescue Jews during the Holocaust .\nThey are honored with The Medal of the Righteous, which is inscribed with the Jewish saying: \"Whosoever saves a single life, saves an entire universe\" (Mishnah, Sanhedrin 4:5), according to Yad Vashem.\nRoyal, the novelist, said that Nobuki Sugihara described his father as \"very caring and loving, and he was a man who did the right thing. He was very humble.\"\nNobuki Sugihara himself told Fox News Digital that he did not know about all the people his father saved until he read about it in a newspaper article when he was 19 years old.\nRoyal’s own father, Michael, and his parents came from Poland to Lithuania to obtain transit visas before traveling through Japan to Australia — where they ultimately chose to reside.\nNobuki Sugihara, age 75 today, holds a copy of \"The Star of the Grave\" by Linda Margolin Royal. Author Royal told Fox News Digital in an interview that when she met Nobuki Sugihara a few years ago, she asked him if she could hug him. \"I'm alive because of his dad, and my kids are alive because of his dad.\"\nRoyal remembered her father telling her that he met Sugihara at the consulate when he was 11 years old — and that he had \"kind eyes.\"\nMultiple sources have said Sugihara rescued as many as 6,000 Jewish people, but Nobuki Sugihara said it’s impossible to know the exact figure, since one passport was for an entire family.\nHe said that in 2016, The Mirrer Yeshiva Central Institute estimated that, including descendants of the survivors, his father could have saved as many as 500,000 Jewish people.\nOverwhelmed with gratitude for Sugihara’s selfless heroism, Royal told Fox News Digital how emotional it was for her to meet the son of the hero at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York City five years ago, when he was a guest speaker.\nSensing the man's reserve as they stood together, she said, \"I asked him if I could hug him, and he sort of smiled … I could see that his wife was smiling, and that it was OK to do that.\"\nMOTHER OF AMERICAN-ISRAELI HOSTAGE TAKEN ON OCT. 7 SAYS HER FAITH HELPS HER THROUGH HER DARKEST DEPTHS OF PAIN\nShe added, \"I just said to him, ‘It's the closest thing to hugging your dad.'\"\nShe went on to Fox News Digital, \"I'm alive because of his dad , and my kids are alive because of his dad.\"\nRoyal never got the chance to meet Sugihara himself before he passed away at the age of 86 in 1986. But she imagined what it could have been like through Rachel Margol, the 20-year-old headstrong protagonist of her book, \"The Star on the Grave.\"\nAuthor Linda Margolin Royal, at her wedding, is pictured with her beloved grandmother, Felka. Royal told Fox News Digital, \"When I started researching trauma and looking back at the photos — suddenly I just got this electric shock when I looked in her eyes … She's just completely overwhelmed.\"\nWhen Rachel Margol meets Sugihara at the Minsk Hotel in Moscow to thank him for giving her family and other families lifesaving transit visas from Lithuania to Japan, he replied, \"I only did what was right … That is all. It’s what anyone would have done.\"\nRachel then points out that others did not do what he did.\nShe hands him a letter from her grandmother, Felka, who is named after Royal’s own grandmother, and is depicted to be just like her in the story.\nMargol shares an extremely close, loving bond with Felka — just as Royal had with her in real life.\nFelka is bold, like her signature color red, and she had an exuberant, magnetic presence that drew in everyone.\nFAR-LEFT HATRED OF JEWS TODAY ECHOES THE SOCIALISM AND ANTISEMITISM OF HITLER IN THE 1930S\nWhen Felka and Rachel celebrated their 60th and 21st birthdays together in Japan, \"The waiters clear the table, and Felka steps up onto the table … They dance joyfully among the rice grains, squashing them into the soles of their high-heeled shoes. Their feet thump the red tablecloth, and they link arms and sing.\"\n\"That was my grandmother,\" Royal told Fox News Digital. \"She did dance on tables and drink vodka … She came to life on the page because that's how my grandmother was. She was hilarious!\"\nAuthor Linda Royal and with her grandmother, Felka. There's a scene in Royal's book, \"The Star on the Grave,\" in which Felka is suddenly gripped by grief and anxiety while helping her granddaughter plan her wedding.\nHowever, beneath a flair for life were tragic memories that she buried deep within herself so that the world would never know her pain, said Royal.\nThere is a scene in \"The Star on the Grave\" in which Felka, the grandmother, is suddenly gripped by grief and anxiety while helping her granddaughter plan her wedding to a Greek Orthodox doctor.\nThe magnitude of Rachel's lack of knowledge about her true identity hits Felka — and the secrets of her past begin to unravel.\nFelka tells her granddaughter what it was like to be married and have a baby at age 18 in Warsaw, Poland in 1926. She described Warsaw as \"a city of intellectuals, of culture, music and theater\" — until suddenly it wasn’t.\nWOMAN VANDALIZES ISRAELI HOSTAGE POSTERS RIGHT IN FRONT OF CAPTIVES' FAMILY MEMBERS IN NEW YORK CITY\nFelka could no longer continue to pursue a degree in law because Jews were not allowed to attend certain schools.\nShe tells her granddaughter, \"Hating us is a European tradition .\"\nFelka also reveals that her father didn’t want her to know she was Jewish. \"Michael forced us. To hide it. He was so worried you would get hurt.\"\nOne night, while she was on a swing, Rachel tried to bring up the subject of her mother, whom she lost when she was just nine years old. Her father shut down the conversation, leading Rachel to say to herself, \"Being Michael’s daughter is a winter like no other, with no spring in sight.\"\nRoyal told Fox News Digital that she \"took her characters to therapy.\" She wanted to understand the effects of generational trauma.\n\"I noticed there was so much trauma with children of Holocaust survivors,\" she said.\nRoyal told Fox News Digital about her grandmother, whom she writes about in her new book, \"If she were alive today, I don’t know how she would cope. I think all this trauma would just surface … In old age, all the bad memories come back.\"\nRoyal discussed the intricacies of her characters' lives with a therapist, she said, such as how Michael’s unresolved childhood trauma affected his parenting skills. She said she wanted to make sure she was accurately portraying the characters and their interactions with each other.\nWhile writing a scene involving Felka, she realized the grandmother was very obsessive-compulsive; for example, all the tassels on her Persian rug had to be facing in the same direction.\nShe said she asked a therapist, \"Does that mean if her outside world was ordered, that she could cope with the disorder on the inside?\"\nThe therapist replied, \"Yes, you’ve nailed it. That’s exactly what happens.\"\nRoyal noticed the anguished look in Felka’s eyes in a photo she took with her on her wedding day.\nShe told Fox News Digital, \"At the time of my wedding , I just thought these were lovely photos of me with my grandmother, but when I started researching trauma and looking back at the photos — suddenly I just got this electric shock when I looked in her eyes. You can just see the trauma. She's just completely overwhelmed.\"\nRoyal’s grandmother passed away in 2002, when she was 93 years old.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\nReferencing how today's antisemitism is a threatening reminder of the Holocaust, Royal said, \"If she were alive today, I don’t know how she would cope. I think all this trauma would just surface … In old age, all the bad memories come back.\"\nShe added, \"All my friends who have Holocaust-surviving parents — they’re now having nightmares.

Creo que confundes conceptos.\nLas benzos actúan sobre los receptores GABA e interactúan también modulando el estrés oxidativo celular, no \"cortándoles el oxígeno\".\n15\nK\n134\n#8\nMaKaNaS\n#2\nMe cuelgo de ti para dar visibilidad a un enlace alternativo con más info cortesía de\n@keizal\nwww.agenciasinc.es/Noticias/Descubren-la-molecula-que-impulsa-la-limpi\n1\nK\n32\n#12\nJesulisto\n#8\nEl zolpidem es una pseudobenzodiazepina pero no es lo mismo.\nDe todas formas, aunque me duermo en el pincho de una pita, cuando necesito algo suelo recurrir a los antihistamínicos tipo hidroxina que, en mi cuñada opinión, creo que producen menos tolerancia y adicción.\n0\nK\n13\n#21\nEmuAGR\n*\n#12\nhidroxizina*\nCon eso te vas durmiendo por todas las esquinas durante todo el día. Yo lo estuve tomando un tiempo y casi me caigo en la bañera...\n1\nK\n23\n#25\nJesulisto\n#21\nSi, hablaba de cabeza, pero ese es el nombre del moléculo\n0\nK\n13\n#16\nRaziel_2\n#12\nSi lo que quieres es quedarte dormido es mejor tomar melantonina, pero solo sirve para quedarse, no para dormir toda la noche.\n0\nK\n11\n#17\nJesulisto\n#16\nYo no la he probado. No tengo problemas para dormir pero cuando me meto más de diez horas en un avión y no me da el presupuesto para business, opto por algo más fuerte.\n0\nK\n13\n#22\nRaziel_2\n*\n#17\nLa teoría dice que tu cuerpo a ciertas horas libera melantonina para empezar el sueño, si te cuesta conciliar el sueño tomar melantonina ayuda a dar ese paso, pero claro, el insomnio es algo muy complejo.\nComo ya he dicho varias veces, soy extrabajador del mar, los cambios de ritmo de estar de guardia 6 horas y dormir 3, volver a estar 6 horas, y dormir 5 durante meses y luego al llegar a casa y dormir toda la noche es jodido.\nLos primeros días me despertaba después de 3 horas de sueño y luego a media tarde estaba muerto, lógicamente.\nA mi me ayudó a las transiciones, aunque he de decir que yo puedo dormir hasta de pie en un barco con balance...\n1\nK\n24\n#4\nporculizador\n#2\nMenos mal que alguien impone cordura.\n#1\nSi cortaran el oxigeno cerebral serian un veneno mortifero.\n5\nK\n61\n#5\nxyria\n#1\nZolpiden es un análogo de las benzo, como tú dices, pero no una benzo en sí.\n2\nK\n41\n#3\nporculizador\nEntonces los betabloqueantes ampliamente utilizados para la tensión arterial son un problema al bloquear los receptores de norepineferina , por eso lo de las constantes pesadillas. Aun los que son altamente cardioselectivos dan problemas, cosa a tener en cuenta, me lo apunto.\n1\nK\n17\n#6\nPriorat\n*\nLo que pasa es que hay numerosos estudios que demuestran que dormir poco aumenta mucho el riesgo de demencia.\nEntonces tendríamos que saber si, respecto a dormir poco, tomando el somnífero el riesgo de demencia es mayor o menor que sin hacerlo y durmiendo poco.\nPorque el estudio me compara dos cosas absurdas. Quién toma somníferos, con la población que no los toma que normalmente no tiene problemas de sueño. Y esa comparación es incorrecta.\n15\nK\n114\n#10\nmaria1988\n*\n#6\nTotalmente de acuerdo. Ya hay estudios anteriores que muestran que quienes toman somníferos tienen más riesgo de demencia, pero eso no significa que si no los tomaran su riesgo disminuiría.\nTambién se debería ver el riesgo de distintos tratamientos comparados entre sí. Si se demuestra que este medicamento en concreto presenta más riesgos que otros, lo ideal sería que no fuera de primera elección en casos de insomnio.\nCC\n#7\n3\nK\n41\n#7\nsauron34_1\nHace tiempo que existen estudios que demuestran que las benzodiazepinas aumentan el riesgo de Alzheimer, el problema es que no dormir también aumenta el riesgo de padecer un montón de enfermedades. Yo cuando me tomo un somnífero (y consigo dormir, que no es siempre) me levanto descansado, pero cuando no duermo estoy que me muero, así que elijo tomar somníferos. Lo que no hay que hacer es tomarlos diariamente porque entonces si que la cagarás de lo lindo.\n7\nK\n94\n#9\nWir0s\n#7\nAquí uno que lleva mucho con zolpiden y diazepan, y eso pq conseguí que me quitaran todo lo demás. Será malo, pero entre dormir 6-7h con suerte y no dormir nada pues me quedo con lo primero.\n4\nK\n47\n#11\nsauron34_1\n*\n#9\nes que totalmente.\nYo el Zolpidem no lo he probado, pero de las benzos he probado Diazepam, trankimazin, lexatin, noctamid, sedotime… me he quedado con lexatin que es la que mejor me sienta y más descansado me deja.\n1\nK\n19\n#13\nAcido\n*\n#11\n#9\n¿Y el Lorazepam qué tal es?\n¿Conocéis de este? (creo que es bastante usado en la actualidad)\n1\nK\n18\n#23\nsauron34_1\n#13\nsabes si ese es su nombre comercial? Es que con el nombre de las benzos me pierdo un poco, siempre me guío mejor por su nombre comercial.\n0\nK\n16\n#29\nLeclercia_adecarboxylata\n#23\nOrfidal.\n0\nK\n18\n#24\nfjcm_xx\n#13\nPues otra benzo. Es cuestión de que lo pruebes. Yo lo pongo en rachas y una dosis muy baja: 1/6.\n0\nK\n9\n#27\nGrub\n*\n#13\nEl lorazepam, vendido bajo el nombre comercial Orfidal o Ativan...\nPor si los conoces por nombre comercial.\nDejan \"kao\" pero en algunos casos no despiertas hasta el café.\nPrueba melantonina. Es diferente, funciona de otra forma.\n0\nK\n9\n#14\nJesulisto\n#9\nYo probaría con los antihistamínicos, una pastilla entera de atarax me deja ko un montonazo de horas así que en caso de necesidad (la clase business de los pobres) me tomo media o una si el viaje es muy largo.\n0\nK\n13\n#15\nyokitolakaka\nMi abuela con 95 años, tiene una lucidez que flipas y lleva desde los 60 tomando pirulas.. alguno me lo explica?\n0\nK\n6\n#18\nataülf\n#15\nya no se hacen las cosas como antaño.\n1\nK\n24\n#28\nGrub\n#15\nSiempre ha dormido bien. Eso es un plus.\n0\nK\n9\n#26\nneiviMuubs\n*\n#15\nque done su cuerpo a la ciencia.\nAhora en serio como ya te han comentado, cada persona es un mundo. Santiago Carrillo era conocido entre otras cosas por ser un político que entre otras cosas estaba todo el dia fumando, y llegó relativamente bien a los 97 años. Creo que no tuvo cancer en su vida.\n0\nK\n7\n#19\nZapZapZap\n#15\nNi todos los que fuman desde los 14 acaban con cáncer, EPOC o infarto. La ciencia no funciona así, en resumen, parece un factor de riesgo, aumenta las probabilidades de padecer la enfermedad.\n0\nK\n6\n#20\nneo1999\nEl problema es nuestro ritmo de vida.\nMi mujer se levanta antes de las 4 para entrar a currar a las 5.\nTeniendo un niño pequeño podemos acostarle relativamente temprano pero no lo suficiente como para dormir 8 horas y que ella se levante como una rosa por lo que ha recurrido alguna vez a la melatonina, que supongo no tiene el efecto de los medicamentos que menciona el artículo pero ... A lo que voy, es insano levantarse tan temprano, el cuerpo se resiente a lo largo del tiempo y el cerebro no puede completar su limpieza igual que quien se levanta a las 7.\n0\nK\n9\nVer toda la conversación (\n29\ncomentarios)\nAutentifícate si deseas escribir\ncomentarios.
