    "title": "Rick Rescorla, The War Hero Who Saved 2,700 Lives On 9/11",
    "text": "Rick Rescorla fought for the British military for six years and earned a Purple Heart for his service with the U.S. Army in Vietnam — but the bravest moment of his life came on September 11, 2001. As smoke enveloped the South Tower of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, a voice rang out in a stairwell that was filled with thousands scrambling for safety. Rick Rescorla, the vice president of security at Morgan Stanley, was singing “God Bless America” on a bullhorn.\nA Vietnam war hero, Rescorla successfully evacuated nearly every Morgan Stanley employee from the tower, saving 2,700 lives.\n“Everybody said, ‘Rick, your folks are out. You’ve done what you need to do,'” Lt. Col. Andrew Watson recalled at a dedication ceremony for Rescorla in 2015, “but he pointed up the stairwell and said, ‘You hear those screams? There’s more people up there. I have to help get them out.'”\nCongressional Medal of Honor Society Rick Rescorla spent years preparing for a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center — and on 9/11, his planning saved thousands.\nRescorla’s actions cost him his life — but they secured his legacy as a hero.\nRick Rescorla’s Heroism On 9/11 When American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center on 9/11, Rick Rescorla was working on the 44th floor of the South Tower. The war hero stayed calm and ignored the orders blasting from the loudspeaker to shelter in place. Instead, Rescorla grabbed a megaphone and began evacuating 2,700 Morgan Stanley employees.\nThe workers knew what to do — Rescorla had led them in an emergency evacuation training program he’d created twice a year.\nRescorla’s wife, Susan, called him when she saw the news that a plane had hit the North Tower. He was busy leading evacuation efforts, but one of his co-workers told her, “Don’t worry. It’s fine, it’s contained. Rick is getting everyone out. He’s out there with the bullhorn now.”\nRick Rescorla’s plan went smoothly at first, but when a second plane struck the South Tower, the urgency to escape grew. So, Rescorla began to sing his own version of “Men of Harlech,” a Welsh battle song, over the megaphone. Years earlier in Vietnam, Rescorla had sung to his men, calming their nerves on the killing fields of Ia Drang.\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology When United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower, Rick Rescorla had already begun to evacuate 2,700 Morgan Stanley employees.\nAs he led the evacuation, Rescorla called Susan for the last time. “Stop crying,” he told her. “I have to get these people out safely. If something should happen to me, I want you to know I’ve never been happier. You made my life.”\nEven when the Morgan Stanley employees reached safety, Rescorla refused to leave anyone behind. He headed back up the stairs to save more lives.\nRescorla was last seen on the 10th floor of the South Tower moments before it collapsed. His body was never recovered.\n“He had a choice,” said Susan at the 2015 dedication ceremony, according to Military.com . “He could have walked out of there anytime he wanted to. If he was here today, he would be proud.”\nHowever, Rick Rescorla’s heroic action on 9/11 wasn’t the first time he’d made a tough choice to save others.\nWho Was Rick Rescorla? Born in Cornwall in 1939, Rick Rescorla watched American soldiers stationed in his hometown as a boy. Fascinated by the World War II infantrymen, Rescorla would later follow in their footsteps, joining the British military at 16 years old.\nSo, how did a Cornish soldier end up working in security at the Twin Towers? Decades earlier, Rescorla had moved to the U.S. to fight in Vietnam.\nUnited States Army Rick Rescorla was a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War.\nAfter serving in the British military as a paratrooper and a police inspector, Rescorla wanted more action. According to Sky HISTORY , his friend Daniel Hill recalled, “He was looking for bang-bang shoot-’em-up.” Hill suggested they both enlist in the U.S. Army so they could see action in the Vietnam War.\nIn 1963, Rescorla finished basic training at Fort Dix in New Jersey. He was quickly promoted as an officer. And two years later, the Cornishman was a platoon leader in the midst of one of the deadliest battles in a bloody war.\nHow A Cornishman Became A Vietnam War Hero In Vietnam, Rescorla’s platoon landed via helicopter in Ia Drang Valley, which became known as the Valley of Death. The brutal battle was the first major engagement between U.S. forces and the People’s Army of North Vietnam.\nWhile holding their line for three long days, Rescorla kept up his men’s spirits through song.\n“We were all sitting in our holes with our knees knocking, we have dead guys all around us, and here comes Rick singing Cornish songs,” recalled radio operator Sam Fantino.\nRescorla earned the nickname “Hard Core” in Vietnam, along with a Purple Heart and a Silver Star. When the war ended, the veteran returned to America and became a U.S. citizen. He earned a law degree and got married. By the mid-1980s, Rescorla was working in corporate security at the World Trade Center.\nBefore the 1993 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, Rescorla and Hill, who had become a counterterrorism expert, thoroughly inspected the Twin Towers for security weaknesses. Rescorla warned that the basement parking garage left the towers vulnerable to attack — but authorities ignored him. Then, in 1993, a truck bomb exploded in the parking garage, killing six.\nFederal Bureau of Investigation Even before the 1993 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, Rick Rescorla warned authorities that the basement presented a security risk.\nOn that day in 1993, according to the 9/11 Memorial & Museum , Rescorla led the Morgan Stanley evacuation. Convinced that terrorists would target the Twin Towers in the future, Rescorla designed a strict disaster contingency plan, which he regularly rehearsed with employees.\nThat plan allowed Rescorla to save 2,700 lives on 9/11.\nEarning The Presidential Citizens Medal Rick Rescorla was not supposed to be in the Twin Towers on 9/11. He gave up a holiday to let a colleague take the day off. But when the planes hit the towers, Rescorla leaped into action.\nDuring the chaos, Rescorla called his Vietnam War buddy Dan Hill. On their last phone call, Rescorla told Hill to get to New York as soon as possible — he’d be needed for rescue efforts.\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology In spite of the danger, Rick Rescorla returned to the South Tower after evacuating 2,700 Morgan Stanley employees.\nIn 2019, Rick Rescorla received the Presidential Citizens Medal posthumously. During the ceremony, battalion commander Watson praised Rescorla for his service.\n“How better can you epitomize selfless service to a nation than to first embark on the conflict in Vietnam, and then to continue to serve your community at every level you find yourself?” Watson asked.\nWatson praised Rescorla for giving his “last full measure of dedication of service and support in an unexpected terrorist attack.”\nLuigi Novi/Wikimedia Commons Rick Rescorla’s name appears at the National September 11 Memorial.\nRick Rescorla was one of just 13 Morgan Stanley employees who died on 9/11. Without Rescorla’s fearless heroism, which saved 2,700 lives, that number would have been much higher.\nAs Hill put it, “You see, for Rick Rescorla, this was a natural death… There are certain men born in this world, and they’re supposed to die setting an example for the rest of the weak bastards we’re surrounded with.”",

    "text": "EAST BRAINERD, Tenn. — [Tornadoes struck middle Tennessee earlier this month](https://newschannel9.com/news/local/2023-tennessee-tornadoes-deadly-lives-lost-fourth-clarksville-tornado-victim-dies-from-injuries-local-reports-say-montgomery-county-middle-tn), killing seven people and and injuring many others. Those tornadoes also damaged buildings and knocked out power for thousands of people. Those storms, as well as others in our area, have left residents looking for ways to stay safe. Thursday we spoke to someone who has experienced disaster first hand about what you can add to your home to protect yourself and your family. So that when severe weather strikes, you'll be prepared. Building a storm shelter came as a no-brainer for East Brainerd Resident Michael Herston. In 2020 his home was considered a “total devastation” from [ the Easter tornados.](https://newschannel9.com/news/local/severe-weather-causes-major-local-damage-late-sunday-night) \"For me, it's not even an option. Whatever the costs, that's safety and security. That's first for us,\" says Herston. He brought in a whole team of structural engineers and designers to provide the safest and sturdiest structure for his family. “I mean, it's your life. It's your life or a few 1,000 bucks. I'm going to spend the money on saving a life,\" Herston says. But Chattanooga Realtor Dawn O'Neil says it's a costly addition. \"With the housing market, the way we have it, it's just hard to justify putting another $10,000 into a storm shelter,\" says O'Neil. But it's not the only way. She says there are more convenient options that home builders are including other than a concrete shelter. \"A lot of builders put doors underneath staircases, things like that. That is great for storage, but it's also great for a place to go if you don't have a basement,\" O'Neil says. Just a few weeks ago, tornadoes raged through Middle Tennessee, bringing storm shelters back to top of mind for homeowners in Chattanooga. “Especially with the tornadoes that just happened and being so close in proximity, I think that's something that people are aware of,\" says O'Neil. But the building of storm shelters hits closer to home. “In 2020 when the storms came to Holly Hills, I think that was something that people, when they were looking at homes, were interested in and it was kind of in the forefront of their mind,\" O'Neil says. Including homeowner Michael Herston. \"Going forward, I'll never have a house again that doesn't have one,\" Herston says. Data from the National Weather Service shows that the average yearly tornado total since 1950 has been 19 per year. However, the average yearly total since 1995 is higher, reaching 32 tornadoes per year on average.",

    "text": "Is it dark 24 hours a day in Iceland?\nNo, it is not dark 24 hours a day in Iceland.\nIs there 24 hour darkness in Iceland?\nYes, during the winter months, parts of Iceland experience 24-hour darkness due to the polar night phenomenon. This occurs in the northernmost parts of the country, such as the town of Ísafjörður, where the sun does not rise above the horizon for several weeks.\nIs Iceland dark during the day?\nUnlike some parts of the Arctic and Scandinavia, Iceland doesn’t suffer from 24 hours of darkness, even on its shortest day in winter. But there is a significant difference in the hours of daylight between Iceland’s summers and winters.\nDoes Iceland ever get darkness?\nYes, Iceland does experience darkness between the hours of 11:30 PM and 3:30 AM. If you want to truly experience the Icelandic Midnight Sun, visit in July, when the sun rises around 3:58 AM and sets around 11:00 PM.\nWhich country has 24 hours of darkness?\nSvalbard, Norway experiences 24 hours of darkness during the polar night season from mid-November to the end of January. This is the best time to see the Northern Lights.\nWhat do people do in Iceland when it’s dark?\nSome activities people do in Iceland during the dark winter months include stargazing, exploring the night sky, and trying to spot stars, planets, and the Milky Way.\nWhy is Iceland so dark?\nDuring the winter months, Iceland experiences shorter days and less light due to its high latitude. The longest day in the middle of December has only around 5 hours of light maximum, with sunrise around 11 AM and sunset between 3 and 4 PM.\nHow do people sleep in Iceland?\nMany Icelanders take advantage of the long summer days by spending time outside and exercising, which helps tire the body naturally so they can sleep. They also use eye masks and blackout curtains to help them sleep during the summer months when it’s still light outside.\nIs Iceland very expensive?\nIceland is relatively expensive compared to many other countries, but the average salary is higher than in most other countries. The high prices can be attributed to a small market, oligopoly, high reliance on imports, geographical isolation, and high import taxes and tolls.\nWhat is the best month to go to Iceland?\nThe best time to visit Iceland is between September and March to see the Northern Lights or between June and August for summer activities.\nCan you see Northern Lights in Reykjavik?\nYes, it is possible to see the Northern Lights from Reykjavik. However, due to the higher light pollution in the capital city, the aurora borealis may appear less vivid compared to other parts of Iceland.\nHow safe is it in Iceland?\nIceland is considered a safe country with a low crime rate. Incidents involving tourists, especially women, are extremely rare. The country does not have an army, and its policemen do not carry guns.\nWhy does Iceland not get dark?\nIceland experiences “white nights” in the summer months due to the midnight sun phenomenon. The setting sun does not fully dip below the horizon during this time, resulting in longer daylight hours. This is most prominent during the Summer Solstice in late June.\nHow long is it dark in Iceland?\nDuring the winter months, the shortest day of the year in Reykjavik has about 4 hours of daylight, while the longest night has about 20 hours of darkness. In the northern parts of the country like Akureyri, the period of darkness can last even longer, with the sun not rising for several weeks.\nDoes the sun ever set in Iceland?\nNo, during the summer months in Iceland, the sun never fully sets. This phenomenon is known as the Icelandic Midnight Sun. The sun remains visible for up to 24 hours a day. The peak daylight hours occur during the summer solstice in late June.\nWhat is the shortest day in Iceland?\nThe shortest day in Iceland is around December 21st when the daylight hours are only about 4 hours and 7 minutes long.\nIs it dark for months in Iceland?\nIn Iceland, it is not dark for six months straight as it is not located at the North Pole. However, during the summertime, Iceland experiences almost 23 hours of daylight, while in winter, it receives barely 5 hours of daylight.\nCan you walk alone at night in Iceland?\nWalking alone at night in Reykjavik, Iceland is generally considered very safe. Incidents involving tourists, especially women, are extremely rare. However, it is always important to stay aware of your surroundings and take normal precautions as a solo traveler.\nAre there any strange laws in Iceland?\nOne strange law in Iceland was the complete ban on dogs in Reykjavik enforced in 1924 due to the increased cases of fatal tapeworms passing from dogs. However, the ban was limited to the capital city, and people in rural areas were still allowed to own working dogs.\nWhat is the coolest thing about Iceland?\nSeveral cool facts about Iceland include being home to one of the first parliaments in the world, having one of the most sparsely populated countries, giving the world the word “geyser,” having no standing army and no McDonald’s, being one of the “freest” countries in the world, and celebrating “Beer Day” to mark the end of a long beer ban.\nIs there a place on earth where the sun never rises?\nNorth of the Arctic Circle, there are periods when the sun never rises. However, Iceland is not located within this area. Above the Arctic Circle, the sun does not rise on the day of the winter solstice, usually around December",

    "text": "Collées sur des palettes, des étiquettes RFID (radio-identification) qui permettent de stocker et de récupérer des données à distance, ont semé la zizanie sur le réseau mobile des opérateurs dans une commune de l’Hérault. L’ANFR a mené l’enquête.\nÀ Vendargues, près de Montpellier, des perturbations affectant les réseaux 3G et 4G sur la bande des 900 MHz ont été signalées par les opérateurs. Une enquête menée par l’Agence nationale des fréquences (ANFR) a révélé une cause inattendue : des étiquettes RFID passives, intégrées à des palettes en plastique d’une entreprise d’e-commerce. Souvent en forme d’autocollants, celles-ci peuvent être fixées sur des objets, intégrées à des produits. Elles sont équipées d’une antenne et d’une puce électronique qui répondent aux signaux radio envoyés par un lecteur.\nCes étiquettes, conçues pour fonctionner globalement grâce à une large bande passante (860-960 MHz), captaient l’énergie électromagnétique des antennes relais situées à proximité. Activées en continu, elles émettaient de manière anarchique, perturbant les fréquences 3G et 4G réservées à Orange, SFR, Bouygues Telecom et Free Mobile. Ce phénomène découle d’un dysfonctionnement lié à un couplage imprévu entre les signaux des antennes et la technologie RFID, notamment par des réactions dues à des produits d’intermodulation passive.\nPour résoudre ce problème, les palettes ont été déplacées dans un bâtiment métallique, agissant comme une cage de Faraday et empêchant ainsi les étiquettes de s’activer. L’ANFR rappelle que tout utilisateur d’équipement RFID est responsable de son bon fonctionnement, sous peine de lourdes sanctions. Cette affaire souligne l’importance de la compatibilité et du respect des fréquences allouées pour éviter de tels incidents.\nSource : Next",

    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open.\nFewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions.\nWarmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan.\nIn Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas.\nOn Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain.\nWarm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each.\nMount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow.\nJames Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season.\n\"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said.\n\"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\"\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\n\"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\"\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n\"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\"\nHe said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n\"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.\nChuck Chiang, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "Wagga is bracing for its hottest day since 2021, and as temperatures rise, residents must be vigilant to stay safe and cool.\nEarly forecasts have temperatures exceeding 40 degrees for the first time since January 24, 2021, next week.\nAs the weather continues to heat up, the Murrumbidgee Local Health District (MLHD) is urging people to stay heat aware.\nMLHD senior medical advisor Dr Anton Forsyth said preparedness is the best way to combat heat-related illnesses.\n\"We're asking people to plan ahead, to know the symptoms of heat-related illness, and what they can do to keep cool and stay hydrated during heatwaves,\" Dr Forsyth said.\nResidents with ongoing health conditions are being reminded to speak with their doctors if they anticipate hot weather will affect them and to store medications at appropriate temperatures.\nDr Forsyth said hot weather impacts everyone, but infants, young children and people 65 years old are at greater risk.\nHe also reminded people to prepare their homes, including checking that fridges, fans, and air-conditioners are working properly.\nAfter a prolonged humid spell, many will welcome this week's dry heat, and home cooling systems are likely to be more efficient than in the past fortnight.\nHarrison & Higgins Airconditioning owner Steve Absolum said homes with evaporative cooling units, known as swampies, will have better relief from the heat in the coming weeks.\nThe systems work to cool spaces by pumping moisture into the air, which is not helpful on a humid day.\n\"In 38 degrees hot weather, no humidity, they're perfect, but any form of humidity affects their performance because they are just putting more moisture into already humid air,\" Mr Absolum said.\n\"With our evaporative coolers, when it's a hot, humid day, we're better off turning the pump off and just running it as a fan.\n\"They just struggle in the humidity, we've all had the moment on a humid day, it's happening in my own house, you've got wet floors, wet walls and everything feels damp because we're just adding more humid air to the already humid air.\"\nTo get the best bang for buck out of evaporative cooling, Mr Absolum said to keep doors and windows open.\nHowever, keeping the house closed is the go if you have a reverse cycle system.\n\"We're conditioning the airspace within our house, so we need windows and doors closed,\" Mr Absolum said.\n\"We're recycling the air internally, and we're cooling that air over and over, so we don't want to be drawing any outside air through windows or open doors because that makes the unit work harder and obviously, we're going to use more power to then condition that airspace.\"\nFor those without air conditioners, ceiling or pedestal fans will help provide some relief.\nThough they do not cool the air, they create a wind chill by pushing air across your skin to draw out heat.\nDuring extreme heat, it is best to stay out of the sun, however, if you intend to cool down in the water,\nit is essential to take precautions.\nDAILY\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.",
