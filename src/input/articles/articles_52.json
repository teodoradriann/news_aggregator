    "text": "A new non-profit organization will help foster collaboration between Stamford businesses, residents and the city itself in improving the city’s parks and recreational areas.\nCalled the Stamford Parks Community Partnership, it launched on May 22 as a 501(c)(3) and already has corporate commitments from the Wellbuilt Company, Philip Morris International, the Ashforth Company, and Henkel, supplemented by a $100,000 matching pledge from the Dalio foundation.\n“Parks are at the heart of our city, providing vital spaces for recreation, relaxation, and connection with nature,” Simmons said in a news release. “My vision is for all Stamford residents to have access to a quality park within a 10-minute walk from where they live and funding from the Stamford Parks Community Partnership will fund projects that ensure we are equitably funding parks across our city. We invite residents, businesses and local organizations to spread the word and participate in this exciting initiative.”\nThe Partnership’s overall goal is to help private and public funds and efforts combine their resources to improve public space throughout the city. Adopt-a-Green and Adopt-a-Park programs will help foster a visible connection between corporations and the community while the Stamford Youth Service Corps will receive funding for an expansion of youth employees who can earn wages and job expereince while beautifying city parks.\nFor more information visit:\nhttps://www.ourstamfordparks.org/",

    "text": "The Turkey Day Dash committee will award two $500 scholarships in the name of a Thousand Oaks High School graduate who lost his life in 2023.\nSuccessful applicants for the Zack Zernick Memorial Scholarship must be high school juniors or seniors who have participated in at least two extracurricular activities and have a 3.0 GPA or higher.

Home-schooled students are eligible.\nThe deadline to apply is Tues., Oct. 22.\nThe scholarship is named for Zachary “Zack” Zernik, a Thousand Oaks native who died at the age of 22 while hiking near Mount Boney outside Newbury Park. As an Eagle Scout and avid hiker and climber, Zack loved the natural world and everything in it. He also was active in wrestling, volleyball, distance running, saxophone, Scouting and woodwork.\nZack was passionate about everything he did.

Applicants should have some record of community service, whether through a sports team, school club or nonprofit organization.\nThe application form is available at\nfive07turkeydaydash.org/zack-zernik-scholarship.\nWinners will be selected by the Dash committee, which includes Zack’s mother, Elizabeth, and announced at this year’s Five07 Turkey Day Dash, happening Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 28 on the campus of Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. The event includes a 5K and the Zack Zernik Mile.\nEvent host Five07 is a locally-owned community coffee shop. Its name represents the five steps owners Sean and Amber Rendineo believe lead to creating something of importance: inspiration, build-up, resistance, overcoming and collaboration.\nFor more information about the scholarship, email or go to\nturkeydaydash.org.",

    "text": "A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of Judith Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza.\nThe news came six days after Ms Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead.\nMs Weinstein, 70, and Mr Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of October 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others.\nIn the early hours of the morning, Ms Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family.\nMs Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza.\nBut six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Mr Haggai was killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza.\nOn Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Ms Weinstein was also killed on October 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza.\nIt was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths.\nThe couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said.\nUS President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Ms Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter.\nThe families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement.\nMs Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs.\nThe kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza.\nMr Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician.\n“Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement.\nAl Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go.\nAlmost all were women and children.\nHe said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her.\nAccording to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity.\nNir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on October 7, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped.\nThe families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones.\nMr Netanyahu met on Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office.\n“I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.",

    "text": "TEMPLE, Texas — Saturday, June 22 will mark one month since two tornadoes touched down along West Adams and Heidenheimer. An EF2 and EF1 blew through Central Texas homes on [May 22](/article/weather/severe-weather/nws-confirms-ef-2-tornado-temple-texas/500-ef7db111-0a6d-4e72-8b5b-f6f48ee8e9bchttps://www.) leaving the community in devastation. Hundreds of homeowners are still working to rebuild like Joely Lux. She has lived in Temple for 19 years. She wasn't home when the tornado hit, but when she came back, she saw water everywhere. Along with that, her roof and fence were both gone. Now a month later, she says it's been quite the adjustment. She is staying in a hotel with her family and 110-pound boxer in a one-bedroom suite working remotely. \"Never in a million years did we think it would come straight down this part of town,\" Lux said. A couple miles outside of Temple lives Jeramy Snowden, who lives in Heidenheimer. His home was hit with an EF1 tornado the same day. \"300,000 volt power lines across our yard,\" Snowden said. \"We were just devastated. Couldn't get in. We had to cut trees to get into the house.\" Both left with homes unrecognizable. May 22 is a day those in Temple will never forget. \"When we came through that night, it just made me cry,\" Lux said. \"Honestly, I'm going to cry talking about it, but it's just the loss.\" What's kept the community strong is people like Diego Gutierrez. \"We're out here trying to take care of some of these damages with these houses on the roof behalf and fence,\" Gutierrez said. \"It's been quite a disaster.\" He works with the Spartan Elite Group, who have been hard at work helping those affected get back on their feet. \"I think in the past two weeks, we've done probably 20 roof jobs and at least 35 fence jobs,\" Gutierrez said. \"We've been out here busting our tails.\" The last month has been quite the adjustment for several homeowners like Lux. She won't even have a roof until July 11, but she's keeping her head held high and she hopes others can too. \"We'll get through this, and we'll build stronger,\" Lux said. If you still need help from the severe storms, FEMA's disaster recovery center is open at Tarver Elementary School in Temple every day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The agency has $102 million dollars in grants to help victims throughout the state.
