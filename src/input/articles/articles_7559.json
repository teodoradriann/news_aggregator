    "title": "Windows 11 receives an avalanche of new features: from an AI draft to the possibility of using your phone as a webcam",
    "text": "Windows 11 hit the market in October 2021, but a lot has changed since then. Microsoft has launched various updates with important news and this year will not be the exception. The Redmond company has just announced that an avalanche of improvements are on the way to the operating system.\nThis is a wide range of functions that seek to improve the user experience. The new thing, as we might guess, is related to artificial intelligence, with features that land in Copilot and the Photos application, but there are also other new features, such as Phone Link. Let's see.\nWindows 11 is updated with a lot of new features\nCopilot has become one of Microsoft's star products. The assistant, powered by GPT-4, is capable of answer questions of all kinds and can even help us program. However, it is not very useful as an assistant to do things for us in Windows, something that is called because it is integrated into the system.\nWhat Microsoft is doing is giving greater capabilities to its AI so that it can make certain tasks easier for us. In this way, we can ask Copilot with natural language to activate the energy saving mode of our laptop, to open applications such as Narrator or Magnifier, to show the available Wi-Fi networks or to empty the trash.\nCopilot, however, is not the only piece of Windows that has AI. The Photos app also benefits from algorithms and, with this latest update, will adopt a “generative erase”. This may sound familiar to you, as it is a very similar proposal to the magic eraser in the Google Photos application.\nUsing this new feature is as simple as selecting the area we want to eliminate with the tool and watching it disappear. As we can see in the images shared by Microsoft, the tool can be used, for example, to delete a dog's leash. We'll have to see how it performs deleting other elements.\nBut not everything is additions. There are updates that also give users freedom to remove or disable certain features. In this case we are facing one of these updates. Microsoft will allow us to say goodbye to the font “Microsoft Start”. At the level of Widgets, we will also be able to access third-party widgets thanks to the Digital Markets Act (DMA).\nNearby Share evolves and now allows you to send and receive files between devices faster. Phone Link is also updated with the ability to access recent photos from a mobile phone and, very interesting, use the camera of this device as a webcam. This has been available on macOS since 2022.\nThere are also improvements in accessibility. Windows 11 now allows us to create custom commands to automate tasks. The Narrator, for his part, now has more natural voices that we can download. As we say, there are many new features, but these are the ones that we believe are the most relevant for system users.\nHow do I get the new features in Windows 11?\nAs we know, Microsoft rolls out its new features gradually, so some of the elements mentioned will arrive before others. The good news is that the company has already begun rolling out the new features. If we want to access them we basically have several paths.\nThe first is to check for an optional non-security March 2024 update in Windows Update. We have to have, yes, a version 23H2 or 22H2 of Windows 11. The other alternative is to wait until April of this year, which is when it is expected that this update will no longer be optional.\nIt is also advisable to enter the Microsoft Store, Microsoft's application distribution platform, and go to the Updates section to download the most recent versions of the apps we have installed. The Photos application, for example, is updated this way.\nImages | Microsoft\nIn crast.net | Elon Musk is preparing his particular email revolution. And his name will be Xmail",

    "title": "During Historic California Heat Wave, a Hero Emerged: Giant Solar-Powered Batteries",
    "text": "Lithium-ion batteries are shown inside a BoxPower SolarContainer housing, part of a PG&amp;E Corp. remote grid power system, in Santa Rosa, California. Bloomberg / Contributor / Getty Images Officials in California say an investment in solar batteries may have saved the state from widespread blackouts and brownouts during a heat wave from June 23 to July 12. The heat wave, which had been anticipated, made national news. In Palm Springs, temperatures reached 124 degrees, and the extreme weather put millions of citizens in the state at risk. As reported by The Sacramento Bee and others, however, giant batteries that store energy from solar power averted a crisis by providing an additional 10,000 megawatts of power, enough to power 10 million homes for hours. Overall, about 11,600 megawatts of new renewable energy has come online since California&#039;s 2022 heat wave, officials from California Independent System Operator said. CAISO is the entity that oversees the state&#039;s power system and electricity market. The news that California&#039;s grid has withstood such a heated challenge comes amid a major policy change affecting how Californians are compensated for excess electricity produced by their solar panels. Last year, the state decreased by 75 percent the amount of money people with solar panels will get for excess energy. That&#039;s led to a decrease in solar panel installations. It also may have caused some solar-power companies to go out of business. However, the changes have spurred homeowners to invest in solar batteries, allowing them to store and use more of that energy in their homes instead of selling it on the energy market. These home batteries, made by companies including Sunpower and Tesla, aren&#039;t the same as the giant grid batteries used by the state. But homes that are relying on their own stored battery power instead of pulling electricity from the grid do help ease the strain on the system during extreme heat waves. Homeowners have other ways to help keep their home cool and efficient, including changing filters regularly and making sure that AC units are clean and working properly.

    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open.\nFewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions.\nWarmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan.\nIn Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas.\nOn Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain.\nWarm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each.\nMount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow.\nJames Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season.\n\"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said.\n\"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\"\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\n\"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\"\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n\"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\"\nHe said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n\"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.\nChuck Chiang, The Canadian Press",

Las víctimas se mudaron con su pareja y sufrieron violencia doméstica, detalló Bárcena. “Curiosamente, a varias de ellas que rescatamos con la ayuda, por ejemplo, de algunos gobiernos nórdicos, que iban a las casas de cuidado y después regresaban a México, regresaban a la pareja, ¿por qué? Porque les daba seguridad”, dijo. Señaló que durante su carrera diplomática, el tema de género y de transitar de una cultura de violencia y discriminación a una de cuidados ha sido un tema central. Recordó estudios internacionales que indican la relación de la cultura de la violencia en América Latina con diversos factores, entre estos, el machismo debido a la incorporación de la mujer al mercado laboral porque el hombre ha dejado de ser proveedor principal y piensa que pierde el control en el proceso de toma de decisiones en las familias o en el entorno. Aunque la violencia contra las mujeres se da en todos los sectores sociales, dijo, se agudiza en los de mayor pobreza y desigualdad. Países con altos niveles de violencia Señaló datos de los altos índices de violencia en países como Nicaragua y República Dominicana, donde la mayor parte del desarrollo económico está en las mujeres. “Una de las razones es el machismo y ese machismo que no se ha adaptado a la incorporación de la mujer al mercado laboral, pero que esa incorporación al mercado laboral tampoco ha sido una incorporación al mercado formal sino al mercado informal, entonces deja a la mujer doblemente vulnerable, por la tendencia al machismo y porque no está protegida por las propias leyes y entorno social al estar en el mercado informal”, indicó. Bárcena aseguró que para transformar esa cultura machista se requieren cambios a la legislación, políticas sociales y educación, así como que la mujer se convierta en el actor principal en los procesos de toma de decisiones para que esté verdaderamente empoderada y no sea un dato más que aparentemente cubre las políticas de género. En este panel también participaron Ana Laura Magaloni, presidenta de Consejo Nuestro Futuro y Tania Espinosa Sanchéz, Coordinadora Jurídica en Latinoamérica para Wiego. DRV",

    "text": "[Passer au contenu principal](#main)\n« Patrick Roy, c'est un winner »\nLa saison dernière, Patrick Roy a mené à bon port le train des Remparts de Québec : champions de la saison régulière dans la LHJMQ, gagnants du trophée Gilles-Courteau et vainqueurs de la Coupe Memorial.\nÀ ses côtés, Simon Gagné était aux premières loges pour contempler les discours inspirants et les ajustements impressionnants de Roy en cours de match. Il n'est donc pas tombé en bas de sa chaise quand il a appris que Roy allait continuer d'écrire son histoire dans la LNH en janvier dernier.\n« J'ai eu la chance d'être avec lui l'an passé, je sais ce qu'il est capable de faire. C'est un winner. Il a gagné comme entraîneur et comme joueur », a commenté Gagné jeudi soir dans une entrevue au 5 à 7.\n« Les discours qu'il faisait avant les matchs me donnaient aussi le goût d'embarquer sur la patinoire et de me défoncer pour lui. Il faisait des discours sur la coupe Stanley de 1993 avec les Canadiens et sur celles avec l'Avalanche. C'était un gars qui pouvait venir te chercher. Je suis très content pour lui et pour Benoit Desrosiers. Je ne suis pas surpris qu'ils se retrouvent ensemble, c'est comme Batman et Robin! »\nAprès s'être joint à la puissante formation qu'était celle des Remparts en 2022-2023, comme entraîneur adjoint à Roy, Gagné doit maintenant rebâtir les fondations de l'avenir de l'équipe dans le rôle de directeur général.\n« Ç'a été extraordinaire [la saison dernière]. C'est sûr que la décision de Patrick Roy et de Jacques Tanguay de prendre leur retraite du hockey junior a été dure à prendre par contre », a admis Gagné, qui célèbre son 44e anniversaire jeudi.\n« D'un autre côté, on est venu me chercher un peu pour prendre la relève. C'est tout un honneur de prendre la place de ces personnes, qui ont tout fait pour les Remparts et la ville de Québec. C'est un nouveau poste que je me voyais occuper dans le futur et Québec, c'est chez moi. J'ai joué pour les Remparts donc c'est naturel pour moi de redonner là où tout a commencé. »\nSans grande surprise, les Remparts n'échappent pas au traditionnel cycle qui dicte la LHJMQ. Au sommet du hockey junior il y a moins d'un an, les Remparts sont maintenant en danger de rater les séries éliminatoires pour la première fois en plus de 40 ans, en vertu de leur fiche de 19-35-4.\nPour des raisons différentes qu'il y a 12 mois, chaque match demeure toutefois d'une importance capitale. Vendredi dernier, les Remparts ont réalisé une remontée contre les Sea Dogs de Saint John en troisième période qui leur a permis d'obtenir une importante victoire en pleine course aux séries.\n« Ce sera une fin de saison excitante, mais différente. Les matchs sont enlevants tous les soirs. J'étais presque aussi content après ce match [contre les Sea Dogs] que lorsque nous avons gagné la coupe Memorial. Tous les points sont importants jusqu'à la fin de la saison. Je m'attends à ce que ce soit serré pour se battre pour les dernières places pour les séries. »",
