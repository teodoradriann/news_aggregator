    "text": "CARLYLE Each year E. Bourassa and Sons in Carlyle hold a toy drive for the local food bank. Although they already collected many items for this, they felt they could do more and wanted to do something different this year. The idea for a fundraiser was born out of the Weyburn branch being challenged by another business. Karley Hislop brought the idea forward to the group, and Carlyle's Bourassa branch decided to try a similar activity. On Dec. 6, the challenge began with Bourassa purchasing 24 items or more for the Carlyle District Food Bank, by which they challenged three other local businesses to purchase 24 items for the food bank and gave them 24 hours to bring the items to the branch. These three businesses would then nominate a business or two of their choice to do the same. This went on until Dec. 15 in the afternoon when the challenge was completed and items were delivered to the food bank. The challenge took off like wildfire and escalated into something much bigger than was anticipated. The organizers were overwhelmed with the success. Tina Renner, administrator for E. Bourassa and Sons said 63 businesses accepted the challenge with many of them bringing in much more than 24 items. Renner and E. Bourassa thanked all the businesses that took part in this challenge, making it such a success. Over 1,600 non-perishable and hygiene items were received and delivered to the food bank. The branch said they plan to continue with the challenge in the future as Carlyle knocked this one out of the park. E. Bourassa and Sons began their business in Carlyle in April 2018. The local office just celebrated its fifth year and now has 13 employees.",

    "title": "Internal politics behind US push for Gaza deal",
    "text": "The U.S. push for a cease-fire and hostage-release agreement to be finalized this week, was prompted by the Biden administration's political considerations, two senior Israeli officials involved in the talks said on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the region to advance an agreement although Hamas was not involved. “He was under pressure to create a sense of momentum and progress leading into this week. The timing was critical for them,” one official told me. \\\"That’s why Blinken proposals solved nothing and when the U.S. saw Israel’s position on a military presence along the Philadelphi Corridor, they realized it wouldn’t fly. That’s why the White House suddenly began pressuring Netanyahu on Wednesday—after Israel had accepted Blinken’s mediation offer. It looked chaotic because it was rushed, and it was rushed because it was political.” The U.S. denied these allegations outright. However, a U.S. official who spoke with Israelis this week acknowledged that “Blinken’s trip wasn’t well-prepared.” The White House hasn’t given up on the possibility of a breakthrough. The new initiative by the mediators involves establishing a mechanism to ensure that both sides fulfill their commitments. This could include deploying international observers to monitor the Nitzarim Route, which the IDF is set to evacuate, and report any possible violations by Hamas, such as militants moving northward. Meanwhile, Mossad chief Dedi Barnea and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar have secretly arrived in Cairo on Thursday. According to CNN, CIA Director Bill Burns is also expected to participate in the talks in the Egyptian capital over the weekend. In addition, The Wall Street Journal revealed new details about a sharp dispute between Israel and Egypt concerning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s demand to maintain a military presence along the Philadelphi Route to prevent arms smuggling to Hamas if a hostage deal and ceasefire are reached. This dispute now poses a major obstacle to U.S. efforts to advance a deal. According to the report, Cairo firmly opposes any Israeli presence on the Philadelphi Route, which lies between southern Gaza and the Egyptian border, even a limited presence as proposed by Israel. Egyptian officials told the newspaper that the Israeli negotiating team recently suggested erecting eight watchtowers along the route. The U.S. proposed a compromise of just two towers, but Egypt rejected both proposals, arguing that any number of watchtowers would give Israel a military foothold in the area. Egypt insists that an Israeli presence would violate the 1979 peace treaty with Israel—a claim that Jerusalem denies. The peace treaty limits the forces that Israel or Egypt can deploy along their border, and regarding the Philadelphi Corridor (which was under Israeli control when the treaty was signed), it stipulates that the IDF cannot station tanks, artillery, or anti-aircraft systems there. The Egyptians, according to the report, also fear that agreeing to any Israeli presence on the Philadelphi Corridor would be seen as cooperating with the “Israeli occupation” of Gaza. The Wall Street Journal also reported that Cairo is demanding American guarantees that if Israel agrees to withdraw from the route in the first stage of the proposed deal, it will not return in later stages if the process falters. Netanyahu has repeatedly stated that the deal, in its agreed-upon framework, is supposed to allow the resumption of fighting in a second phase if negotiations for ending the war fail. Israel, on the other hand, insists on a presence along the route, which is considered Hamas’s “lifeline,” because it doesn’t trust Egypt to effectively block the numerous smuggling tunnels identified there. The report describes a “crisis of trust” with Cairo, which officially denies the existence of any tunnels along its border with Gaza. According to the IDF, many tunnels have been found in the Philadelphi Route area, although it refrains from disclosing how many are still active on the Egyptian side of the border.

We need to be there after business hours at 5:30 p.m. so we don’t interrupt anyone while they’re working. I have to remind my husband EVERY Wednesday that we need to be AT THE JOB. It causes fights. He makes his own hours at his other job. He can work whenever he wants and leave when it’s done. I was raised to believe, “If you’re early, you’re on time. If you’re on time, then you’re late.” His attitude is, “Why worry about when we show up?” I’m angry that he doesn’t respect how important this job is to me. I’m his boss when it comes to this jobsite. How can I handle this? I’m so done. I can’t lose this job, and I can’t do it by myself! It’s HIPAA-protected, so not just anyone can do this with me. -- TIMED OUT IN THE MIDWEST DEAR TIMED OUT: How important is it that you start promptly at 5:30? Could all the work get done if you started at 6? I know you are a stickler for promptness, but who set the hours? You and your husband might fight less often if you become more flexible. However, if the problem persists, remind him that the extra income helps to pay important bills. If that doesn’t motivate him, stop fighting, contact the friend who gave you the job and ask if she has any suggestions about someone who could do what your husband has been doing. I wish you luck.

    "text": "Un cucciolo di coccodrillo siamese mentre esce dall'uovo (Bros Pov, Fauna & Flora)\nRoma, 19 luglio 2024 – Sessanta piccoli coccodrilli siamesi , tra le specie di rettili più rari al mondo, sono riusciti a uscire dalle proprie uova con successo nel parco nazionale Cardamom, in Cambogia . Si tratta del più grande record di riproduzione in natura per questi rettili, che dà nuova speranza per la loro sopravvivenza. Il coccodrillo siamese è infatti a critico rischio d’estinzione . Le uova erano state trovate tra maggio e giugno, distribuite tra 5 nidi, a cui da quel momento è stata assicurata una sorveglianza di 24 ore su 24.\nIl coccodrillo siamese è un rettile d'acqua dolce di colore verde oliva, che presenta una particolare cresta ossea sulla parte posteriore della testa e che può crescere fino a 3 metri.\nFino al 2000, si temeva che la specie fosse estinta in natura, a causa della caccia e della perdita dell’habitat. L’area popolata dal coccodrillo siamese nel sud-est asiatico si è infatti ridotta del 99 %. Al momento, si stima che rimangano circa 400 esemplari liberi in tutto il mondo, e la maggior parte si trova proprio in Cambogia.\n🐊 New hope for critically endangered Siamese crocodiles! 60 eggs hatched in Cambodia’s Cardamom National Park, the largest breeding record this century. Decades of hunting and habitat loss threatened them, but conservation efforts are firmly paying off. https://t.co/SRDSSXKrpG pic.twitter.com/amoYQq30pv\n— Fauna & Flora (@FaunaFloraInt) July 18, 2024 Secondo Flora&Fauna , che collabora a livello internazionale per la conservazione di diverse specie a rischio di estinzione, non è un caso che la specie sia riuscita a sopravvivere proprio in quest’area: “le popolazione indigene locali venerano questo rettile ed è un considerato un tabù uccidere o ferire un esemplare”.\nL’associazione sostiene che “ le persone che hanno sempre vissuto in armonia con i coccodrilli siamesi sono le più adatte a proteggerli ” e per questo lavora a stretto contatto con le comunità locali e il governo cambogiano, al fine di “salvaguardare e integrare la popolazione di coccodrilli rimasta”. “ Dal 2012 , il programma ha liberato con successo un totale di 196 coccodrilli siamesi allevati in cattività in aree sicure”, ha dichiarato Flora&Fauna, “ora abbiamo un'ulteriore prova che i nostri sforzi congiunti stanno avendo un impatto reale ”.\nWhatsApp\nFacebook\nX\nPrint\n© Riproduzione riservata",

    "text": "Los Angeles, California--(Newsfile Corp. - December 28, 2023) - Locker Room Insurance is a forward-thinking insurance brokerage co-founded by 2021 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Calvin Johnson Jr. and Rob Sims, his former NFL teammate, along with experienced business executive and licensed insurance agent Craig Freeman. Together, they're on a mission to elevate the insurance industry and reach underserved markets through Locker Room Insurance.\nJohnson Jr., known for his Hall of Fame football career with the Detroit Lions, has been deeply engaged in community service since childhood, in part because he is the grandchild of a Baptist minister. His dedication led him to establish the Calvin Johnson Jr. Foundation, which has made a difference for nearly 13 years.\n\"The feeling you get from serving people is contagious. It feels great knowing I'm serving my neighbors and providing for families,\" Johnson Jr. said.\nSims, a nine-year NFL veteran who also played with the Lions, shared a similar sentiment. \"We're big on finding solutions that benefit other people. It fills us with excitement to empower those without similar opportunities, enabling them to secure their family's financial future and enhance the community.\"\nLocker Room Insurance\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8798/191320_bd8138025409e9b3_001full.jpg\nFreeman, a mission-driven executive known for his broad business acumen and servant leadership style, is equally excited about the program and its impact on the community.\n\"A quarter of the population doesn't have any type of insurance,\" Freeman observed. \"We want to be able to help. Rob and Calvin have a lot of people they love to help in various ways, but they can't take all of them to the NFL. They might also not be able to help them with other capital-intensive ventures. With insurance, they'll help many agents change their lives and their families' futures through a low barrier entrance, low capital insurance model.\"\nTo get an in-person look at how they operate, apply for an opportunity to attend the Locker Room Insurance launch party in the Detroit area later this year, where they will hosting a NFL Playoff watch party as well as providing a business overview for prospective agents.
