    "title": "Nibi the beaver can stay home! MA Gov. Healey shares update – NBC Boston",
    "text": "Turns out, Nibi the beaver won't have to learn how to live in the wild on its own after all. The beloved animal, which has been in the care of Massachusetts' Newhouse Wildlife Rescue for two years, started the week with an eviction order — the the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife said it would have to go back to the wild on Tuesday . STAY IN THE KNOW | | Get Boston local news, weather forecasts, lifestyle and entertainment stories to your inbox. | But after Gov. Maura Healey paused that plan, she has decided to let Nibi stay at the facility as an educational animal, which Newhouse's owners had been pushing for. “Nibi has captured the hearts of many of our residents, mine included,” Healey said in a statement Thursday. “We’re excited to share that we have issued a permit for Nibi to remain in Newhouse’s care, continuing to educate the public about this important species. I’m grateful to our state’s dedicated wildlife biologists who work every day to care for Massachusetts wildlife, and I hope Nibi inspires more people to protect our natural world.” Get top local stories in Boston delivered to you every morning.[Sign up for NBC Boston's News Headlines newsletter.] While the goal of wildlife rehabilitators is to get animals that are sick or otherwise need care back out into the wild, state officials noted in an announcement, but in rare cases, permits can allow them to be used in educational settings. A copy of Nibi's permit was filed in Middlesex Superior Court Thursday as part of the Newhouse Wildlife Rescue's lawsuit to keep Nibi; a hearing had been scheduled for Friday. \"I'm just thankful, I'm very thankful,\" a relieved Jane Newhouse, a founder of the Chelmsford nonprofit, said in a quick video reacting to the decision that she posted to Facebook. The state's legal filing noted that \"Newhouse Wildlife Rescue has raised Nibi from a one-month old kit to a healthy, adult beaver. Through this permit, Plaintiff may continue to care and train Nibi, and accordingly MassWildlife has fulfilled all aspects of the relief that is sought in Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.\" Newhouse rescued the 1 lb. newborn beaver on the side of the road in Sturbridge in 2022, and she has lived at Newhouse Wildlife Rescue ever since. She went viral that November, when Newhouse shared a video of her building a dam indoors , apparently — and relatably — to keep her roommate from coming back in.",

(KSNB) - Skies will gradually clear out overnight tonight, as the upper level storm that has impacted our Christmas holiday, continues to clear out. With the clearing skies morning temperatures will plummet into the teens and lower 20s. Sunshine will return the next couple of days with highs making a push for the lower 40s both Friday and Saturday. That will help melt some of the recent snow but Saturday afternoon another cold front sweeps through bringing clouds back into the region. Cold high pressure follows sending temperatures into the mid 20s Sunday afternoon with late night revelers facing lows Monday morning in the single digits. New Years Day will be mostly sunny but highs will remain in the upper 20s. The rest of next week will be back in the lower to middle 30s.

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Jones County, Mississippi from 1901-2000 was 49.1. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Jones County, Mississippi experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Jones County, Mississippi history.",

Beijing and Moscow are staunch allies and have strengthened their relations as Western countries turn their backs on Russia over its military invasion of Ukraine. Both sides have also played up the personal relationship between the two leaders, with Xi referring to Putin as his \"good friend.\" Xi said \"The material and public opinion foundation of our relationship has become stronger\" in his recap of the year to Putin on Sunday, according to state broadcaster CCTV. \"In the face of changes unseen in a century, and a turbulent regional and international situation, China-Russia relations have maintained healthy and stable development and moved steadily in the right direction,\" the Chinese leader added. \"Under our joint leadership, political mutual trust between the two sides has further deepened, strategic coordination has drawn closer, and mutually beneficial cooperation has continued to achieve new results,\" Xi was quoted as saying. Xi noted that the volume of bilateral trade exceeded $200 billion ahead of schedule, and he added that Beijing was looking forward to marking the 75th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral ties in 2024. During a visit to Beijing by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin earlier this month, Xi said maintaining close ties with Moscow was a \"strategic choice.\"",

    "text": "Technology\nJapan: Apple Must Lift Browser Engine Ban by December\nJapan, the EU, and the UK all now require Apple to support third-party browser engines. That's great news for the open web.\nIt’s interesting to watch various national technology policies build on each other, learning from their failures and unintended effects in order to be more effective.\nHere, Japan’s legislation has learned from EU rules in order to more effectively ensure that Apple allows non-Safari engines to be used in iOS browser apps:\n“Designated providers (i.e. Apple) must not only eliminate outright bans (like[App Store Guideline 2.5.6]), but must also refrain from practices that, while technically permitting browser engines, render their use impractical or commercially unviable.\nThis is directly relevant to Apple’s current iOS behavior, even under the EU’s Digital Markets Act, where[technical and procedural restrictions continue to block meaningful competition]. Japan’s guidance is clearly designed to avoid similar outcomes.”\nThis should be great news for consumers — particularly if these kinds of regulations are offered beyond the current three regions (EU, UK, and now Japan). Apple has traditionally been a laggard when it comes to adding open web features that might be competitive with native apps. Opening up the App Store to other browsers, and forcing browser choice, could help mitigate that and allow open web features to fall into the hands of iPhone and iPad users sooner.\nOne way this could go wrong, of course, is if it further entrenches Chrome’s position in the market. Chrome already represents two thirds of web browsers. Although Chrome does a far better job of supporting modern open web features (because it suits Google’s business model), it would be a real shame if regulation designed to promote competition actually reduces it on the web.\nWe’ll see how this all pans out, but the best outcome would be a web that has a plethora of different browser engines from different vendors with different business and sustainability models. Stronger competition (with a healthy dose of structured regulation) would help ensure that open web features arrive in the hands of users promptly and accurately. That, in turn, prevents lock-in, helps improve user privacy, and allows the open web to thrive.\n[Link]",
