    "title": "R Ashwin & Prasidh Krishna OUT, Ravindra Jadeja IN: India's Likely Playing XI For 2nd Test Against South Africa | Cricket News, Times Now",
    "text": "After losing the series opener in Centurion by an innings and 32 runs, the Indian men’s cricket team would like to make a comeback in the second and final Test of the two-match series against South Africa. The second red-ball match between the two teams is scheduled to take place at Newlands in Cape Town on January 3. Indian batters produce a shambolic show in the series opener, but despite that, India is unlikely to make changes to the batting line-up. There is an option of playing Abhimanyu Easwaran, who replaced Ruturaj Gaikwad in the Test squad, but it is highly unlikely that the former India A captain will get a chance over Yashasvi Jaiswal, who wasn’t able to do much in the Centurion Test.But there are high chances that India will make a couple of changes in the bowling attack. Star all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja missed the series opener after complaining of upper back spasms on the morning of the match. In his place, world No. 1 Test bowler Ravichandran Ashwin was included in the playing XI, but he could only manage to take one wicket and score 8 and 0 runs. He is all set to be replaced by Jadeja, who is a much more reliable batter and an equally capable spinner in overseas conditions. Apart from Ashwin, Prasidh Krishna, who made his Test debut for India in the Boxing Day Test, could also lose his spot and get replaced by Mukesh Kumar. There were high hopes from Krishna after he picked up a five-wicket haul in the first four-day match between India A and South Africa A, but he couldn’t do much at SuperSport Park and was only able to take one wicket for 93 runs in 20 overs. He was criticised by many experts of the game for his poor show in the series opener.Shardul Thakur also wasn’t able to deliver with the ball, but due to his batting, he is all set to retain his place. India has never managed to win a Test series in South Africa, and after losing the series opener, the historic feat will not be achieved this time either, but India would like to win the Cape Town Test to avoid the embarrassment of losing Test series in South Africa.India’s likely playing XI for the 2nd Test against South Africa: Rohit Sharma (C), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mukesh Kumar, and Mohammed Siraj.",

    "title": "Hammers at the double in first Emirates victory since 2015",
    "text": "For the second time in two months Arsenal conceded a goal when the ball might already have gone out of play.\nAnd just as it had at Newcastle, where Mikel Arteta railed bitterly against VAR and all its deficiencies, it proved mighty costly for the Gunners. In terms of the match and, perhaps, their Premier League title hopes as well.\nGoals from Tomas Soucek and Tinos Mavropanos gave West Ham a first Emirates Stadium win since 2015 and propelled David Moyes' 'Champions of Europe' up to sixth.\nThe unexpected success also kept Liverpool at the Premier League summit, although Arsenal have one more chance to overtake before 2023 ends, by winning at Fulham on Sunday.\nArsenal hired a phalanx of lawyers to defend Arteta for crying 'disgrace' at the manner of Newcastle's 1-0 win on November 4. This time, though, they will just have to suck it up; both goals were also the result of sub-standard defending.\nYet spare a thought for VAR Craig Pawson and his assistant Ian Hussin. No doubt a hail of vitriol, virtual or actual, will come their way for deciding there was insufficient evidence for Soucek's 13th-minute Hammers opener to be wiped away.\nIt happened like this. Emerson pinged in a cross from the left that Arsenal centre-back Gabriel attempted to marshal away towards the opposite touchline.\nBut Oleksandr Zinchenko had also been alert to the danger - and his team-mate had no idea he was now right next to him. The ball pinged off the Ukrainian's chest and squirted across goal, destined to go out for a corner.\nJarrod Bowen, having failed to connect with the initial cross, had other ideas however and hooked it back for Soucek to drive high into the net from six yards and wait for VAR to confirm it was OK.\nIt took a long time for this to happen as the footage from the only relevant angle showed the ball disappearing from view behind Bowen's right leg as he made contact with his left. There was no sign of any gap so, just like Joe Willock's throw-in that never was in the build up to Newcastle's winner, the goal had to stand. Again by the barest of margins.\nFor a while, the setback knocked the stuffing out of Arsenal, who had swarmed around the West Ham goal from the moment James Ward-Prowse planted the game's first shot over theirs, with Bukayo Saka forcing Alphonse Areola into a save and Leandro Trossard firing over from Gabriel Martinelli's cutback.\nIt was Saka who got Arsenal back on track with a header that Areola did well to tip over. West Ham survived a nervous moment when Soucek slid in recklessly on Gabriel Jesus in the box - and again when Saka smacked a drive on to Areola's near post.\nThat was a real head-in-the-hands moment - and the half ended with the Hammers, who had lost Lucas Paqueta to injury and been allowed just 26% of possession, still in front thanks to their one and only shot on target.\nThe second period began as had the first, with Arsenal trying to pass their way through a wall of blue. Trossard was hurt in the act of firing over, clattered by Mohammed Kudus but no foul was given.\nDeclan Rice, booed by some of the away following, decided have a pop from distance but the former Hammers hero is a rare scorer and his effort was too high.\nAnd then, out of nowhere, West Ham scored again, through Mavropanos, the former Arsenal man, from a corner conceded by Ben White.\nAgain Gabriel was found wanting as the Greece centre-back out-jumped him to meet Ward-Prowse's delivery and power a header that went in off the underside of the crossbar and the inside of a post as well.\nMavropanos, back in English football after a four season spell in Germany with Nurnburg and Stuttgart, had played just eight games for Arsenal.\nArteta made a double change shortly after the hour mark, with forwards Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson sent on. Immediately Jesus met a Saka cross with a powerful header that Areola stopped on the line. The Brazilian was back soon after, to meet a White delivery to the back post, but this time his header went over.\nAreola did well to deny Trossard before Saka dived for a penalty that didn't fool VAR. It was West Ham's night, not theirs. And especially not Rice's as his clumsy challenge on Emerson resulted in a stoppage-time penalty.\nDavid Raya saved sub Said Benrahma's tame spot-kick but the final whistle followed straight after.\nRaya 7; White 6, Saliba 6, Gabriel 5, Zinchenko 5 (Nelson 64, 4); Odegaard 7, Rice 6, Trossard 7 (Smith-Rowe 79, 3); Saka 7, Jesus 5, Martinelli 5 (Nketiah 64, 4).\nAreola 8; Coufal 7, Mavropanos 8, Ogbonna 8, Emerson 8; Soucek 7, Alvarez 7; Kudus 6, Ward-Prowse 7, Paqueta 5 (Benrahma 33, 5); Bowen 7.\nMichael Oliver 6.",

    "text": "Vitalik: Compared to Ethereum, Solana is overly centralized, and there are indeed differences in the market goals pursued by Ethereum Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said in an interview: On the internet, many people have expressed some ideas that I find strange, such as Ethereum's values are useless and Crypto is a gambling market. However, within the Ethereum community, their participation in Ethereum is because we have some values and life ideals that we particularly value. We want to create an open world and a decentralized blockchain platform. We will develop sustainable applications and applications that make society better. In addition, when asked \"how do you view Solana\", Vitalik said: I think they are really more centralized than Ethereum. First of all, running Solana nodes is much harder than running Ethereum nodes; secondly, Solana's PoS is more centralized; thirdly, there are more things in the community directly supported by the Solana Foundation. Moreover, Solana's application requirements for decentralization are much lower than those of Ethereum. I think their pursuit of certain market goals is really different from that of Ethereum.

    "text": "While this week's snow has made for some rough conditions outside, that hasn't stopped people from stepping up to help others get through through the mess. A group of Herriman teenagers stepped up Wednesday when snow squalls swept through northern Utah and forced many vehicles off the roads. Along a stretch of Rosecrest Road near Mountain View Corridor, the streets were clear and traffic was moving smoothly Friday, but that's expected to change when more snow starts falling heading into the weekend. That means plenty of people will get stuck trying to make it up a hill on the road. \"There's a lot of crashes over here,\" explained teenager Dallin Oaks. On Wednesday, Oaks and his friends, brothers Carter and Austin Halcom, along with Jaxon Meyers, came to the rescue of several stranded motorists. \"We decided to go in the back, back here and just look around,\" said Carter. \"We saw a couple of cars getting stuck and so we decided we might as well just help.\" In all, the teens said they helped four or five drivers in the span of an hour get out of the road. One car in particular posed quite the problem. \"It was our most challenging car,\" said Austin. \"It was pretty stuck and we could not get it to move, so we tried our best to shovel snow on the tires and we tried to get it moving.\" In the end, it took about 15-20 minutes to get the car moving Overall, the entire rescue operation came with multiple challenges. \"Some of us had boots, but [two in the group] did not, they had trash bags on their feet,\" Dallin said. Video of the teens being knights in shining armor was posted on social media, generating plenty of comments that applauded the teens for their efforts. \"It was just good to see that they noticed it, that a lot of people in the city could see what we did,\" said Jaxon. One driver who was helped by the teens also posted to Facebook, saying he was so grateful they were there to help. \"At the end of the day, it is nice to help others,\" said Carter. With more snow slated for this weekend, the kids promised to be out in the neighborhood again to help if needed.",
