    "text": "Man in Sattahip detained after cannabis-induced hallucinations\nResidents rattled as man climbing over a house fence\nA 36 year old man was apprehended by police in Sattahip district, Chon Buri province, after causing a commotion while experiencing hallucinations from cannabis use.\nThe incident occurred yesterday, July 2 when the man was found climbing over a house fence in Mueang Sattahip subdistrict, appearing intoxicated, dancing, smiling, and speaking to himself around the neighbourhood. Concerned residents alerted the police due to the disruption and fear caused.\nThe man’s girlfriend explained that he frequently consumed cannabis, which led to severe hallucinations. He reportedly claimed to be under a Cambodian spell before his erratic behaviour began.\nShe and her family hoped for him to receive treatment. Initially, the police took him to Sattahip Hospital at kilometre 10 for a medical examination, which revealed no presence of Category 1 narcotics. However, he admitted to using cannabis. Subsequently, he was referred for rehabilitation.\nThe residents, having no intention to press charges, permitted the police to proceed without filing any formal accusations, reported KhaoSod.\nIn similar news, a German expat in Krabi was taken to a rehabilitation facility after suffering severe hallucinations believed to be caused by homemade drugs, leading to hours of shouting and disturbing the neighbourhood.\nOn February 17, police responded to a house in Village 4, Sai Thai subdistrict, following reports of a foreign man screaming loudly and causing alarm among residents.\nAt the scene, officers met 33 year old Kun (alias), a Thai woman who requested urgent help for her 37 year old German husband. She explained that he had been experiencing extreme paranoia and hallucinations, and she feared for both their safety.\nKun disclosed that her husband, a chemical engineer, had been synthesising Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a potent hallucinogen, for personal use.\nShe noted that since beginning the drug use two weeks earlier, he had started seeing visions of Lord Buddha and attempted to climb out of windows, convinced he was in danger.\nLatest Thailand News\nFollow The Thaiger on Google News:",

    "title": "K-Battery Production Rates Decline in Q3, Outlook Remains 'Cloudy' for Q4",
    "text": "In the third quarter of this year, the production rates of South Korea's three major battery makers, known as K-Battery companies, saw a sharp decline. This decrease is attributed to adjustments in production volume, as automakers adjust their inventory in response to a temporary lull in demand for electric vehicles (EVs). However, despite these reductions in factory activity, the K-Battery companies are continuing to ramp up investments in research and development (R&D) to secure their future. According to quarterly reports published on the 14th, LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, and SK On reported declines in utilization rates, impacted by a slowdown in demand from downstream industries. LG Energy Solution’s average production facility utilization rate dropped to 59.8% in Q3, a double-digit decrease from the same period last year, which was at 72.9%. Samsung SDI disclosed only the utilization rate for its energy solution (small battery) division, which showed an average utilization rate of 68% in the first half of this year, down from 77% in the same period last year. Samsung SDI also reported a Q3 operating profit of 129.9 billion KRW, down 72% year-over-year, mainly due to reduced cylindrical battery production driven by lower EV battery sales. SK On also experienced a significant drop in utilization rates, with an average utilization of 46.2% in Q3 compared to 94.9% for the same period last year. Despite the prolonged EV market slowdown, the K-Battery companies have not held back on investments in future technology. In Q3, their combined R&D spending reached 1.99 trillion KRW, up 11.4% from last year's 1.78 trillion KRW. Samsung SDI invested the most in R&D, allocating 986 billion KRW, a 17% increase compared to the same period last year. LG Energy Solution invested 795.3 billion KRW, an 8.9% increase year-over-year. SK On spent 210.4 billion KRW in Q3, slightly down from the previous year's 220.6 billion KRW, as the company sought to control the pace of investment and improve operational efficiency amid ongoing financial losses. The percentage of R&D costs relative to sales also rose across all three companies. SK On nearly doubled its R&D spending ratio, reaching 7.7%, while Samsung SDI and LG Energy Solution increased by 2.8 and 1.3 percentage points, respectively, to reach 7.7% and 4.1%. However, analysts remain pessimistic about the K-Battery companies' Q4 performance, citing the delayed recovery in EV demand, year-end inventory adjustments, and potential one-time costs. KB Securities analyst Jeon Woo-jae forecasts a Q4 operating loss of 89.1 billion KRW for LG Energy Solution, citing factors such as lower sales in the U.S., declining battery prices due to falling nickel and lithium prices, and year-end inventory adjustments. Kim Hyun-soo, an analyst at Hana Securities, expressed a bleak outlook for Samsung SDI in Q4, predicting that while energy storage system (ESS) sales may increase, a minimal rise in prismatic cell shipments and continued decline in cylindrical cell shipments could lead to underwhelming sales and profit performance. Meanwhile, Lee Jin-myeong from Shinhan Investment & Securities noted that SK On may face a return to operating losses in Q4 but anticipates an improvement in fundamentals starting next year with the recovery of the North American EV market. sunone@chosunbiz.com",

    "text": "Russian scientists successfully revived 24,000-year-old micro-organisms, bdelloid rotifers, from Siberian permafrost, showcasing the marvel of cryptobiosis. Scientists have revived 24,000-year-old bdelloid rotifer microworms.\nThe rotifers were frozen in permafrost in a long-term cryptobiotic state.\nLessons from these and other revived organisms could help farms on Mars.\nWe promise this isn't as sinister as it sounds: Russian scientists have revived and cloned 24,000-year-old zombies.\nDon't worry—this isn't a Walking Dead situation. The undead organisms in questions are called bdelloid rotifers, or microscopic \"wheel animals\" named for their circular mouths surrounded by tiny hairs. Like the more charismatic tardigrade, bdelloid rotifers are extremophiles —organisms that can withstand astonishing conditions like red-hot undersea vents or the vacuum of space.\nFor this experiment, the scientists went to Siberia and carved off a slice of permafrost, the term for ground that permanently stays frozen. This particular area has been frozen since at least the end of the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago).\nThe scientists took the frozen rotifers and thawed them gently, at which point the rotifers began to just live…\nCaroline Delbert",
