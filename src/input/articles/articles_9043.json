    "title": "\"Please don't be mad or sad. I'm free now\": David and Victoria Beckham's Former Bodyguard Craig Ainsworth Found Dead After Chilling Final Post",
    "text": "Craig Ainsworth, a former bodyguard to David and Victoria Beckham, has been found dead in Spain under mysterious circumstances after he was reported missing. The 40-year-old ex-Royal Marine vanished days before his body was discovered. His grieving mother, Sally, confirmed the heartbreaking news through a social media post over the weekend, saying, \"With the greatest sadness, the world has lost Craig.\"\nDAVID Beckham's former bodyguard Craig Ainsworth has been mysteriously found dead X Craig had served in Afghanistan and was reportedly battling post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Just before his disappearance, he posted a haunting farewell message on Facebook. In it, he thanked his loved ones and reflected on the pain he had endured, particularly since the COVID-19 lockdowns. \"Goodbye Beautiful People,\" the post began. \"For most of you, this will come as a shock, but I've been in the most tremendous pain for the past four years.\"\nOriginally from Enfield, North London, Craig worked as a personal protection officer for the Beckhams between 2013 and 2015. He was hired through a U.S. security firm and passed extreme physical and psychological tests to qualify for the role. His military training included enduring pepper spray to the face and tackling MMA fighters in pitch darkness—measures meant to prepare him for any real-world threat.\nX Craig also protected other major celebrities such as Johnny Depp, Jennifer Lawrence, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. A photo shared by his mother showed him in military uniform, symbolizing a proud yet painful part of his life. Details of how and where Craig died have not been made public, and the circumstances remain unclear.\nHis final Facebook message included emotional apologies to his Royal Marine brothers and close friends. He wrote, \"Please don't be mad or sad. I'm free now. You guys were the light that kept me going all this time.\" Craig expressed gratitude for those who supported him and made his life meaningful, adding that he lived with \"a pure heart and good intentions.\"\nIn the same message, he also made clear funeral wishes. \"I do not want a funeral. Cremate my body and throw the ashes in the sea,\" he stated. He also asked people who hadn't supported him recently not to pay tribute online. \"If I wasn't worth the effort alive, please don't pretend now. There's nothing worse than a traitor's remorse.\"\nBefore being assigned to the Beckhams, Craig signed a 50-year non-disclosure agreement. However, after the release of the Netflix documentary on David Beckham, Craig spoke publicly about his experience with the celebrity couple. \"David was charming. Victoria kept to herself. She was usually with the kids or working,\" he said. Despite their fame, he praised their parenting, calling their children well-behaved and grounded.\nThe military veteran's death has sent shockwaves through both the security and celebrity communities. Many are remembering him as a dedicated professional and a loyal friend. Those who worked alongside him described him as tough but kind, disciplined yet humble.\nCraig's story also sheds light on the struggles faced by many veterans dealing with PTSD. His death serves as a stark reminder that even the strongest among us can be battling invisible wounds. Mental health awareness advocates have already begun calling for more support for veterans like Craig, who often suffer in silence.\nInvestigations into Craig Ainsworth's death are ongoing. For now, his family, friends, and former colleagues mourn the loss of a man who dedicated his life to protecting others—both on the battlefield and in the high-pressure world of celebrity security.",

    "text": "California's first huge swells of the winter are wreaking havoc on the state's coastline as an incoming atmospheric river storm is forcing evacuations amid flooding of beach and coastal roads.\nMarin County residents in the Calles Pinos, Pradero, Sierra, Onda Resaca, Ribera and Embarcadero areas as well as Calle de Arroyo were\nordered to temporarily evacuate Thursday morning due to high risk of wave damage and coastal flooding. Evacuated residents were told to head to the Stinson Beach Community Center.\nSanta Cruz County issued an\nevacuation warning Thursday on X, formerly known as Twitter, for coastal areas near Seacliff State Beach because of flooding.\nWithin the evacuation area, the tourist hot spot known as the Rio del Mar Esplanade is currently flooded with several inches of storm water.\nOn X, the California Highway Patrol cautions that residents avoid the area and not attempt to drive across or through.\nAccording to the\nNational Weather Service's coastal flood warning for the Bay Area, large breaking waves are causing significant flooding of beach and coastal roads. The waves are depositing large amounts of debris and causing road closures.\nThe San Francisco Bay Area coast could see waves up to 40 feet in some locations. The National Weather Service issued a warning for residents to stay away from rocks, jetties, piers and other waterside infrastructure.\nIn Southern California, the waves aren't expected to be as big, but high surf is expected through Saturday, meteorologists said. In Ventura County, waves of up to 12 feet have already been reported, and the Central Coast has seen 18- to 20-foot swells, said Mike Wofford with the National Weather Service's Oxnard office.\nIn a beachside community in Ventura,\nresidents watched as waves washed trash bins away, sending foaming streams of seawater into neighborhood streets.\nA high surf advisory went into effect at 4 a.m. Thursday for Point Conception in Santa Barbara County and Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach and Palos Verdes Peninsula beaches in Los Angeles County, all of which can expect sets of 15- to 20-foot waves and dangerous rip currents.\n\"We're expecting the highest waves today to be arriving either late morning or early afternoon and then, maybe some drops in height tomorrow, but still well above normal,\" Wofford said.\nThe waves will pick back up Saturday when another surge of higher swells arrives.\nThere have been\nreally strong storms over the Pacific Ocean that \"we don't necessarily see because they move up to the north or go in some other direction,\" Wofford said.\nWhile the storms are moving through, strong winds can form big waves, which \"propagate out along, and the waves just come barreling right in,\" he said.\nAlong with the high surf advisory, the National Weather Service issued a coastal flood advisory through 10 p.m. Saturday.\nAlthough no structural or road damage is expected, there is an increased risk for drowning, the agency warned. Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea, and large breaking waves can cause injuries, wash people off beaches or rocks and capsize small boats.\n\"Never turn your back to the ocean,\" the\nNational Weather Service said on X.\nRain won't be compounding the waves in the Los Angeles County area, as the forecast doesn't call for rain until early Saturday and will continue for most of the day until it tapers off, Wofford said.\nThere's a 30% to 40% chance of rain Sunday into Monday, but it will be in the form of light showers.\n©2023 Los Angeles Times.

    "text": "Texas wildlife experts offer tips to help animals in harsh winter weather [Brandi D. Addison](https://www.lubbockonline.com/staff/7612831001/brandi-d-addison/) When potent Arctic storms impact Texas, the routine winter safety checklist typically involves securing the safety of ourselves, our homes, vehicles and pets. Many wildlife rehabbers advocate that our winter weather knowledge repository should also encompass knowledge on how to safely assist struggling wildlife we may encounter. Wildlife, for the most part, have developed effective strategies to cope with frigid conditions. Birds migrate to warmer regions, and small mammals like bats, prairie dogs, squirrels, and raccoons regulate their body temperature through torpor, a state of decreased activity. Some mammals hibernate, and reptiles enter brumation. But in some cases, animals aren't as capable of surviving the harsh conditions. Here's what Texas wildlife rehabbers suggest for animals in distress. Preparing for winter weather Wildlife experts usually advise the public to minimize interactions with wildlife to establish a clear barrier that discourages wildlife species from becoming overly comfortable with humans. But that doesn't mean humans can't indirectly assist wildlife when possible. The South Plains Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Lubbock recommends providing water, especially when temperatures are cooler and it becomes more challenging to find. \"They'll have to go break the waters several times a day (to ensure it doesn't freeze over). But we don't advocate feeding wildlife,\" said Gail Barnes, who serves as the director of the wildlife rehabilitation center. \"We also recommend that you don't discourage them away from your property. If they're under your porch or shed or have a place that they're using to stay warm, please leave them and let them be for the time being.\" The North Texas Wildlife Center warned on Facebook that people should always check car engines, where small mammals and even reptiles may seek shelter for warmth. When preparing for winter weather, the North Texas Wildlife Rehabilitation Center also recommends against the use of dryer lint for nesting birds. \"Lint is lacking in structure, disintegrates when wet, and can become sticky and coat birds' legs, feet, and feathers causing mobility issues,\" the center shared in a social media post. \"Additionally, lint contains chemicals from laundry detergent. These chemicals can be hazardous to birds' lungs and the strong scent may also attract predators.\" Instead, the center encourages natural materials like a pile of sticks, insecticide-free grass, moss and strips of bark from trees. Caring for sick, injured or dying animals The North Texas Wildlife Center and South Plains Wildlife Rehabilitation Center have provided guidance on caring for animals that are sick or injured as a result of cold temperatures. If a small mammal, such as an opossum or raccoon is found in a state of hypothermia or frozen to the ground, the North Texas Wildlife Center recommends the following: If the animal is frozen to the ground, do not attempt to pull them away, and instead pour lukewarm water around them. Once freed, secure the animal by wearing thick gloves and corral them with a blanket or into the box, then prepare a kennel or ventilated box and provide dry bedding for the animal to live on. After the animal is secured, do not offer food or water, because they need a warm body temperature for proper digestion. Instead, move them to a warm and quiet environment way from pets and children. ”If you do find one that is hypothermic, please bring it inside your house, if (the local rehab center) isn’t open,” Barnes said. In Lubbock, the South Plains Wildlife Rehabilitation Center has a 24-hour drop-off service with heated cages. “After (drop-off), we would put the animal in an incubator with heated cages and warm the animal up, then start feeding slowly,” Barnes said. “Once warmed up, we’d like to release back to where the animal came from.” She added that it’s possible to use a hammer to try to break an animal from ice. “A couple years ago, we had a bunch of birds that their toes were frozen,” Barnes said. “They did lose their toes, but they were able to function.” She also warned that this year, because temperatures have been fairly warm, Lubbock locals may see more baby squirrels and opossums. “Warm, dark and quiet is what we advocate for wildlife,” she added.",
