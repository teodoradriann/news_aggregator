    "text": "La Terra supera per primer cop els 1,5º d’escalfament després del rècord del 2024\nEl 2024 que tot just ha acabat ha estat l’any més càlid des que es tenen registres i el primer en què la temperatura global ha superat en més d’1,5 graus centígrads les xifres de temperatura respecte a l’època preindustrial, segons el darrer informe del programa europeu Copernicus. Els experts consultats pel servei climàtic i d’observació de la Terra a nivell europeu atribueixen a l’acció humana la superació d’aquest llindar de consens internacionalment i reclamen accions “ràpides i decisives” per revertir la situació.\nLa temperatura mitjana al planeta l’any 2024 es va situar en els 15,1 graus, 0,72 graus per sobre els valors per al període 1991-2020 i 1,6 graus més respecte a la mitjana estimada per a l’etapa preindustrial (1850-1900).\n“Cada any de l’última dècada és un dels més càlids i ara estem superant els nivells d’1,5 graus definits en l’Acord de París”, adverteix la responsable d’estratègia climàtica del Centre Europeu de Previsions Meteorològiques, Samantha Burgess.\nEls experts no dubten que les altes temperatures globals, juntament amb unes concentracions rècord de vapor d’aigua a l’atmosfera, són an desencadenar onades de calor sense precedents i esdeveniments de pluges intenses, causant misèria a milions de persones i fenòmens extrems com ara els incendis que afecten Los Angeles o la dana de València.\n“El canvi climàtic no crea megaincendis ni riuades catastròfiques per si sol, però sí que augmenta la intensitat amb què cremen les flames i descarreguen les tempestes”, explica Víctor Resco de Dios, professor d’enginyeria forestal i canvi global de la Universitat de Lleida. En declaracions recollides per SMC, l’expert constata que, malgrat que a Catalunya tenim la impressió que el 2024 no ha estat particularment calorós perquè l’estiu va ser més suau que els dos anys anteriors, cada cop som més aprop dels dos graus d’augment que, després dels darrers canvis, es considera el nivell d’escalfament segur que no afecta de manera crítica la societat. “Amb tot, l’escalfament continuarà progressant i el llindar dels 2 ºC es depassarà en poques dècades. Per això l’adaptació al canvi climàtic esdevé cada cop més urgent i important”, conclou.\n[Identificar-me](/registre/compte/verificat.html?return=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lbHB1bnRhdnVpLmNhdC9zb2NpZXRhdC9hcnRpY2xlLzExLW1lZGlhbWJpZW50LzI0OTU1OTUtbGEtdGVycmEtc3VwZXJhLXBlci1wcmltZXItY29wLWVscy0xLTUtZC1lc2NhbGZhbWVudC1kZXNwcmVzLWRlbC1yZWNvcmQtZGVsLTIwMjQuaHRtbCNjb21tZW50cw==&msg=34bd8f3599cdc6f6308d40855bdb2a1b).

    "title": "Blake Shelton Hopes to Quit Drinking for Gwen Stefani's Sons | In Touch Weekly",
    "text": "When asked about the New Year’s resolution he’s made repeatedly without success, Blake Shelton gives a shockingly honest answer. “Well, I haven’t been able to stop drinking yet. That’s my New Year’s resolution this year: To either cut back or stop drinking altogether,” he promises, adding an emphatic, “I said it.”\nIt’s an earnest admission from the country star who’s said he built his brand on his self-described “drunken redneck” persona. “He knows people will be surprised to hear his resolution,” says a source exclusively to In Touch , adding that his wife of more than two years, Gwen Stefani , 54, “hasn’t pushed him, but obviously there are health benefits to cutting back on alcohol, so she’s supportive. Plus, it’s a good example for his stepsons , two of whom are now in their teens. It’s a win-win for everyone.”\nDrunk History But it will be a challenge. The “More I Drink” singer’s projects often go hand-in-hand with alcohol, and he’s been known to play up his frequent inebriation. Blake, who once joked about all the “trouble that getting wasted all the time gets me in,” has an online history of posting comments about his drunken antics and photos of himself imbibing, and he’s also confessed to drinking vodka while filming The Voice .\nGwen and Blake's Relationship Timeline Amid 'Suffering' Marriage In 2011, he made a series of videos poking fun at his excessive boozing while promoting his album Red River Blue (featuring the hit single “Drink on It”). In one, he quipped, “I think of a hangover as a badge of honor.” And after taking a fall on stage in Oklahoma in 2018, he tweeted, “Yes I had been drinking. A lot….”\nBut as many people realize as they get older, it’s harder to bounce back from a night of excess. “Blake is 47 now, and at that age, drinking takes more of a toll on the body than it used to,” says the source, noting that the extra calories don’t help, either. “Cutting out the beer will definitely help him keep his weight in check. And overall, it’ll make him feel better.”\nDeal of the Day This Half-Zip Sweatshirt Is Every Cozy Girl’s Dream Purchase — Up to 36% Off View Deal Gwen approves. While the singer enjoys wine, “she’s never been a big drinker,” says the source. “And Blake doesn’t feel the need to have alcohol when he’s around her. He values their relationship, and he wants to be fully present for her at all times.”\nFamily Man! Blake Shelton's Cutest Photos With Gwen Stefani's Kids Plus, his bold decision to put down the bottle will get people talking. “Blake famously loves to be provocative, and declaring that he’s going to quit drinking is just the kind of thing he would say to cause a stir,” says the source, noting that while many of his fans have expressed support, others have complained he’s not being himself. “But he’s never cared what anyone thinks. If he really does quit, it will be for him.”\nHave a tip? Send it to us!

    "title": "The warmest December in Weakley County history",
    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Weakley County, Tennessee from 1901-2000 was 38.9. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Weakley County, Tennessee experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Weakley County, Tennessee history.",

After it didn't work, the suspect got inside the victim's car but was unable to drive away because the victim had the keys in his pocket, according to investigators. \"His face was all red and he was crying,\" the man told KOMO News. \"His girlfriend asked me what I sprayed with and I sprayed her in the face, too.\" The two suspects, believed to be a man and a woman in their 30s, were arrested as Federal Way police arrived at the scene, KOMO News reported. The suspects face charges of eluding police, carjacking, and hit and run, according Johnson. Moments before the suspects were arrested According to the investigators, two suspects were eluding Kent police in a stolen vehicle driving northbound on Interstate 5. After a short time chasing after the stolen car, Kent police stopped their pursuit due to strict laws in Washington about officers in high-speed chases. Kent police officers reported the suspects hit multiple cars as they were escaping. The suspects lost control of their vehicle and stopped at a rest area off I-5 in Federal Way, nearly 8 miles north of their first encounter with Kent police. The suspects tried to break into three cars while at the rest stop, state investigators said. One of the suspects opened 72-year-old woman's car door, leading to the bear spray encounter. Investigators said none of the victims suffered serious injuries as the suspects tried stealing the cars. \"I never thought something like this would happen to me, you see stuff all the time,\" the woman's son told KOMO News, \"He's lucky I had bear spray otherwise I would have knocked him to the ground.\"",

    "text": "US President Joe Biden revealed during a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida that a Japanese astronaut will be the first non-American to set foot on the Moon.Â\nThis development is part of Nasa’s ambitious Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the lunar surface for the first time since the Apollo missions ended in 1972.\nThe collaboration between the United States and Japan was highlighted during Prime Minister Kishida’s state visit, demonstrating Washington’s efforts to bolster ties with its key Asian ally. “Two Japanese astronauts will join future American missions, and one will become the first non-American ever to land on the Moon,” Biden stated, emphasizing the significance of this partnership. In response, Kishida hailed the announcement as a “huge achievement” and committed Japan to contribute a rover to the Artemis program.\nArtemis mission\nNasa’s Artemis program is not just about revisiting the Moon but establishing a sustained presence there as a precursor to potential human missions to Mars. The program has already made headlines by committing to include the first woman and the first person of color in its lunar missions. Nasa chief Bill Nelson echoed the sentiment of international cooperation, stating, “America will no longer walk on the Moon alone.”\nArtemis 3, slated for 2026, will mark the first mission to bring astronauts back to the lunar surface. This announcement comes at a time when global interest in lunar exploration is intensifying, with China expressing ambitions to land humans on the Moon by 2030.\nJapan’s space agency, JAXA, expressed enthusiasm about the collaboration, pledging to fulfill its role in developing the rover for the Artemis program. The rover, which will be pressurized, is expected to significantly enhance lunar exploration capabilities by allowing astronauts to travel farther and work for longer periods on the lunar surface. It is anticipated to be used on the Artemis 7 mission and subsequent missions over a ten-year lifespan.\nArtemis mission\nThis partnership extends beyond the Artemis program, as Tokyo and Washington have a longstanding history of collaboration in space exploration, including operations at the International Space Station (ISS). Earlier this year, Japan achieved a significant milestone by successfully landing its SLIM spacecraft on the Moon, becoming the fifth country to do so.\nThe agreement also highlights the broader international involvement in the Artemis program, with the European Space Agency (ESA) securing three seats on future missions in exchange for technological contributions. However, the specifics of European astronauts’ participation, whether they will land on the Moon or merely orbit it, remain under discussion.",

    "text": "Pastor de araque engana 20 fiéis com promessa de viagem à Terra Santa\nO falso religioso aplicou o golpe após usar uma agência de viagens de fachada para vender pacotes turísticos para locais onde Jesus caminhou\natualizado\nCompartilhar notícia\nGoogle News - Metrópoles\nExplorar a fé de cristãos que sonham em cruzar o Oceano Atlântico e pisar na chamada Terra Santa, entre o Rio Jordão e o Mar Mediterrâneo, entre Israel e a Palestina, é a especialidade de um pastor de araque investigado pela Polícia Civil do Distrito Federal (PCDF). O falso religioso aplicou um golpe em pelo menos 20 vítimas, após usar uma agência de viagens de fachada para vender pacotes turísticos incluindo visitas a locais por onde Jesus Cristo caminhou. A 3ª Delegacia de Polícia (Cruzeiro) instaurou inquérito para investigar o caso.\nDe acordo com as investigações, o pastor fake fazia pregações itinerantes em igrejas no DF e Entorno. Fiéis de outros estado também caíram na lábia do golpista, que teria faturado perto de R$ 300 mil com falsa venda de pacotes turísticos. Articulado, simpático e usando a falsa credibilidade por se apresentar como pastor, o estelionatário conseguia captar cristãos de todas as classes sociais que tinham o desejo de viajar até Israel.\nPara facilitar o golpe, o falso pastor chegava a oferecer viagens mais caras, colocando no roteiro países como Egito. O suspeito passava a perna nas vítimas após entregar supostos contratos e começava a receber os valores, que chegavam até R$ 20 mil. Em alguns casos, o estelionatário aliciava vítima com alto poder aquisitivo, como moradores do Sudoeste, idosos aposentado do serviço público ou servidores da ativa. Já pessoas mais humildes eram exploradas e convencidas a assumirem boletos bancários como dezenas de prestações com o pretexto de que viajariam até Israel quando quitassem o valor.\nDecepção e morte\nMuitas pessoas chegaram a usar boa parte das economias para realizar o sonho de conhecer a Galileia, cidade ao norte de Israel onde, segundo a fé cristã, Jesus Cristo pregou o Evangelho, curou enfermos e realizou milagres.\nA polícia apura a morte de uma idosa que teria sofrido um mal súbito ao saber que havia caído em um golpe e não embarcaria mais para Israel.\n“Muitas pessoas depositaram a confiança e todas as economias que tinham para realizar o desejo de fazer essa viagem. Ele se transformou em um grande destruidor de sonhos”, disse uma das vítimas do pastor de araque.\nBoa parte dos golpes foram aplicados ainda em 2023 e se estenderam até este ano. Como desculpa, o pastor fake usou o conflito entre Israel e o grupo militante palestino Hamas, deflagrado em 7 de outubro de 2023, para enrolar as vítimas. “Muitas pessoas já haviam quitado todo o valor para a viagem, mas o pastor falava que o país estava em guerra e passou a adiar a ida. Quando as cobranças se intensificaram, ele passou a bloquear as pessoas no WhatsApp e desapareceu”, disse a vítima.\nTodos os valores transferidos pelos fiéis iam para uma suposta agência de viagens de propriedade do pastor. A empresa, que deveria funcionar em um prédio no Setor Comercial Sul, não existe. A equipe de reportagem da coluna esteve no local para conferir se havia qualquer tipo de sinal da agência comandada pelo pastor. No ponto havia, apenas, um escritório de advocacia sem qualquer vínculo como o religioso. O pastor fake não é visto há anos no prédio onde, de fato, era dono de uma sala comercial.\nO outro lado\nDe acordo com o delegado-chefe da 3ª DP, Victor Dan, o inquérito aberto para apurar todos os golpes está em andamento. “Estamos ouvindo as vítimas e colhendo depoimentos. Também estão tentando intimar o autor para que ele seja ouvido. Por enquanto, o caso é apurado como estelionato”, explicou.\nA coluna tentou localizar o pastor, mas ele não respondeu às mensagens enviadas para o telefone que consta como sendo dele nas ocorrências policiais. O espaço permanece aberto para possíveis manifestações.",

    "title": "Mayor ‘shocked’ at low participation in Anmore South development’s first phase of public engagement",
    "text": "Anmore’s mayor said he was “kind of shocked” at how few residents participated in Anmore South’s first phase of public engagement.\nThe Village of Anmore had been taking input from open houses, workshops, and online feedback from April 20 to June 30 regarding Icona Properties’ proposal to develop 151 acres on the municipality’s southern border.\nDespite being the biggest development in Anmore’s history, less than five percent of Anmore’s approximately 2,600 residents have offered any engagement, said Mayor John McEwen.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW “I’m kind of shocked by that. This is a significant change to the village,” McEwen said. “Get out if you want to have your say.”\nA report on the first round of engagement was presented to Anmore council on July 16, summarizing the village’s three-month effort to consult with the community.\nTwo open houses and four workshops were held in order to consult and inform residents about Icona Properties’ application to amend Anmore’s official community plan, as well as the municipality’s own neighbourhood plan.\nThe proposal has pitched re-designating the large development site from rural to urban in order to construct up to 3,500 units, in a broad mix of single-family homes, and multi-family buildings with commercial components. Build-out is expected to take 25 years.\nIt will require an update to Metro Vancouver’s Regional Growth Strategy, as well as amendments to Anmore’s zoning bylaw.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW The first round of community engagement was meant to gauge the broader community’s initial priorities and concerns towards Icona Properties’ vision for Anmore South – but not many residents bothered to take part.\nWhile 150 residents participated in the first open house in May, only 37 attendees showed up to a second technical open house in June, and 54 residents in total came to four workshops in June. Only 33 residents completed online feedback forms, while another 10 emails were sent directly to staff.\n“I thought it’d be much greater,” McEwen said. “I’m hoping things are going to change.”\nAmong the residents who did participate, there was little consensus to be found, according to Therese Mickelson, a consultant hired to conduct the community engagement.\nMickelson said that there was a mix of support for Icona Properties’ proposal, as well as outright opposition to changing the rural designation. She said the most challenging aspect of the engagement were residents’ “strong feelings,” though she noted the discussions were largely respectful and productive.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW “Most of the participants did recognize that the Anmore South property would be developed, and that the owner has the right to develop their property,” Mickelson said. “But when it comes to what that looks like, there’s quite a mix.”\nTraffic and environmental impacts were some of the top themes that arose throughout the engagement process, according to Mickelson, adding discussions had a heavy focus on the trade offs between density and protecting green space.\nCoun. Paul Weverink said any development of this size is going to come with traffic concerns, but he was glad to see numerous comments supporting a third road connection to Port Moody.\n“That needs to be on the books for the future,” Weverink said. “I don’t think Anmore is gonna have a traffic problem, Port Moody is going to have a traffic problem.”\nResidents who participated in Anmore’s engagement process are eager to get more details from the neighbourhood plan and land use scenarios that are going to be proposed, said Mickelson.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Icona Properties will be taking the feedback to help develop its land use plan; when completed, a second round of community engagement will commence. Anmore’s neighborhood plan, meanwhile, will require a raft of assessments measuring the impacts to traffic, municipal infrastructure and the environment.\n“There’s a lot more work to be done before any decisions are made,” Mickelson. “We are in the early stages of this planning process.”\nCoun. Kim Trowbridge said people opposing developments tend to be the most vocal during community engagement, stating he was encouraged by how much positive feedback was received.\n“This is quite balanced, there’s quite a bit of support,” Trowbridge said.",

    "text": "The president of Colombia, Gustavo Petro , criticized on Tuesday, without mentioning him, his Argentine counterpart, Javier Milei , and his motto “Long live freedom, to hell”, when he spoke before the UN General Assembly about the subjugation of politics in power the richest.\n«Politicians, including the presidents of the most powerful countries on earth, simply obey them. “They pay for the electoral campaigns, they are the owners of the media, they are the ones who hide the truth of science, like in the film ‘Don’t look up'”, he said referring to political power, the richest. % of the world.\nPetro, who has had several disagreements with Milei, said the rich are “the ones who say what you think, what you say and what should be prohibited and silenced.”\n«In their force of prohibition and censorship they shout ‘Long live freedom, to hell’, but it is only the freedom of the richest 1% of the world’s population which in its mercantile and free-market sentiment leads us to the destruction of the atmosphere and life» , he stated.\nEnd of humanity In his third speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Petro predicted today that “the end” of humanity has begun due to the “genocide” in Gaza , wars and climate change that has caused the destruction of 11 million of hectares of jungle. Amazon burned in just one month due to global warming.\nHe denounced that powerful countries, which have the “power to destroy the life of humanity” and at the same time to stop the bombing of Gaza, do not listen to the majority of other heads of state who demand that the “genocide” stop.\n«They don’t listen to us when we vote to stop the genocide in Gaza, even though we are the majority of the world’s presidents and representatives of the majority of humanity; “A minority of presidents who can stop the bombing do not listen to us, that is, the presidents of countries that can destroy humanity do not listen to us,” lamented Colombia’s first left-wing president.\n«In this room, a president’s ability to communicate depends on the amount of dollars he has in his budget, the number of warplanes he owns and, ultimately, his country’s ability to destroy humanity on the ground» , he added.\nThe bells of the planet Likewise, the climate crisis is leading to the end of humanity, according to Petro, because “scientists have said that if the Amazon forest burned we would reach the climate tipping point, where human decisions to stop the collapse will have already been made ”. harmless”, and “the Amazon forest is burning”, he recalled, alluding to the hundreds of fires that have occurred in recent weeks in South America.\n«The bells are already ringing all over the planet for you, for us, for life and for humanity, as Ernest Hemingway said. The bell rings not only for you, but for all of your life. The end has begun,” the president predicted.\nThe president also referred to social inequality, recalling that Oxfam indicated this week that the richest 1% of humanity owns more wealth than 95% of all humanity combined.\n“It is in this achieved inequality, the greatest in our history as a species, that we find the logic of the massive destruction unleashed in the climate crisis and the logic of the bombs that a criminal like (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu drops on Gaza. Netanyahu is a hero for the richest 1% of humanity because he is able to demonstrate that people are destroyed under bombs,” the Colombian president said.\n«The maximization of death» As in previous years, Petro attacked the free market, underlining this time that it is “the maximization of death” and underlining that the richest 1% is the one who allows “bombs to be dropped on women, the elderly and children of families.” Gaza.” , or Sudan, or rebel countries that do not fall under their dominion are economically blocked.\n«I can only tell the weak-voiced people of the world about a country without weapons of mass destruction, but beautiful for its natural and cultural diversity, the country of beauty and butterflies of all colors, which is no longer “It is not It is the time of governments, but it is the time of peoples”, stated Petro, who invited us to raise “the flag of life, otherwise our cities will be filled with cemeteries, as the epidemic has shown us”.\nAnd he addressed the main world leaders directly: “I no longer speak with Biden, nor with Macron, nor with Scholz, nor with Xi Jin Ping, nor with Putin. (…) It is up to humanity to fight, it is the people’s time. If governments were unable and decided to play with bombs and senseless wars, with harmless power games, then it is time to put the solution to humanity’s great problems in the hands of the people themselves.\n*With information from EFE*\n#Petro #criticized #Javier #Milei #spoke #humanity",
