    "text": "Il datore di lavoro che costringe a un’inattività forzata il proprio dipendente può essere condannato per mobbing? Svuotamento delle mansioni: c’è risarcimento?\nOgni dipendente svolge per il proprio datore le mansioni stabilite all’interno del contratto di assunzione e adempie ad ogni altro compito funzionale ad esse, avendo cura di rispettare gli obblighi stabiliti nel codice di condotta aziendale. Il lavoratore che viene meno a tali doveri può essere licenziato, con o senza preavviso, a seconda della gravità della propria condotta. Con il presente articolo esamineremo l’ipotesi opposta: il datore può costringere il dipendente a non fare nulla?\nIn buona sostanza, si tratta di capire se un datore di lavoro può obbligare all’inattività il proprio dipendente. Tale scelta, sebbene controproducente per la propria azienda, è solitamente posta in essere a scopo ritorsivo, cioè per punire il lavoratore. Di fronte a tale circostanza, cosa può fare il dipendente? Non gli resta che accettare la decisione oppure può dimettersi per giusta causa?\nIn effetti, se da un lato il lavoratore costretto all’inattività, pur non facendo nulla, continua a percepire lo stipendio, dall’altro lato non acquisisce alcuna competenza, con grave pregiudizio per la sua professionalità. Il datore può costringere il dipendente a non fare nulla? Approfondiamo l’argomento.\nIl datore può costringere all’inattività il proprio dipendente? Il dipendente ha diritto ad essere adibito alle proprie mansioni.\nIl datore non può costringere all’inattività forzata il proprio dipendente : svolgere le mansioni previste dal contratto, infatti, non è solo un dovere ma anche un diritto del lavoratore, il quale quindi non può essere costretto a stare con le mani in mano.\nPur trattandosi di una scelta contraria all’interesse aziendale, lo svuotamento delle mansioni non è un fenomeno così raro e viene attuato solitamente tramite:\nla marginalizzazione del lavoratore all’interno dell’organizzazione aziendale; l’esclusione da riunioni , gruppi di lavoro, comunicazioni via e-mail o telefonate; il trasferimento del dipendente in un ufficio isolato ; la mancata assegnazione di compiti . A prima vista, potrebbe sembrare un vantaggio ricevere lo stipendio senza dover svolgere alcuna attività.\nTuttavia, questa strategia ha un obiettivo ben preciso: isolare e spingere il lavoratore a lasciare volontariamente il posto di lavoro.\nIl diritto di svolgere le proprie mansioni non è solo un interesse per il datore di lavoro, che remunera il dipendente per questo, ma rappresenta anche un diritto fondamentale del lavoratore .\nLa professionalità di quest’ultimo costituisce un valore giuridico che necessita di protezione.\nPer non parlare, poi, delle ripercussioni che l’isolamento e l’inattività forzata hanno sul benessere psicofisico del dipendente.\nInattività forzata: cosa può fare il dipendente? Il dipendente costretto dal datore a non fare nulla può rassegnare le dimissioni per giusta causa : egli può quindi licenziarsi su due piedi e, al contempo, conservare il diritto alla disoccupazione (Naspi).\nIl datore che obbliga il dipendente all’inattività commette infatti un illecito equiparabile al mobbing , che legittima quindi il dipendente a dimettersi senza preavviso.\nSecondo la giurisprudenza (Cass., 9 maggio 2018, n. 11169), il lavoratore costretto a non fare nulla può chiedere il risarcimento per lesione della propria dignità professionale : la condotta illecita del datore è infatti idonea a produrre un danno di tipo patrimoniale , che può essere liquidato dal giudice (in assenza di una prova esatta) anche in via equitativa.\nIl danno causato dall’ inattività forzata deve essere parametrato:\nalla quantità ed alla qualità della esperienza lavorativa precedente del dipendente; alla tipologia di professionalità lesa ; alla durata dell’ inattività forzata ; all’esito finale della condotta datoriale ; alle altre peculiarità del caso concreto. Ovviamente, qualora all’inattività forzata seguisse anche il licenziamento , il provvedimento potrebbe essere legittimamente impugnato davanti al giudice dimostrando che il dipendente non ha potuto svolgere le mansioni per cui era stato assunto per una scelta precisa del datore.\nPer ulteriori approfondimenti si legga l’articolo dal titolo Non far lavorare un dipendente è illegale?",

    "text": "A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of Judith Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza. The news came six days after Ms Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead. Ms Weinstein, 70, and Mr Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of October 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. In the early hours of the morning, Ms Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family. Ms Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Mr Haggai was killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. On Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Ms Weinstein was also killed on October 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths. The couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Ms Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter. The families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement. Ms Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Mr Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. “Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement. Al Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children. He said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity. Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on October 7, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped. The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones. Mr Netanyahu met on Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office. “I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.

    "text": "The strange case of Gypsy Rose Blanchard, who conspired to kill her abusive mother. She is now released Story highlights The act had helped the mother and daughter get philanthropic donations, a trip to Disney World, and even a home in Springfield from Habitat for Humanity The act had helped the mother and daughter get philanthropic donations, a trip to Disney World, and even a home in Springfield from Habitat for Humanity Gypsy Rose Blanchard, a US woman who killed her abusive mother after conspiring with an online boyfriend, has been released early from prison on parole. She is now 32. Her boyfriend was identified as Nicholas Godejohn. Blanchard remained the centre of one of the most infamous true-crime cases in the past 15 years - a case that not just gripped the nation, but the entire world. trending now For years, her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard, forced her to pretend that she was suffering from leukaemia, muscular dystrophy and other serious illnesses. In a way, she had kept her daughter prisoner, forcing her to use a wheelchair and feeding tube. Blanchard killed her mother in 2015 in Missouri. She had pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder. As quoted by media outlets, Karen Pojmann, who is a spokesperson for the Missouri department of corrections, said that Blanchard was released early in the day from the Chillicothe correctional centre. Pojmann said that she was granted parole after serving 85 per cent of her original sentence. Blanchard gave a knife to her online boyfriend, who had fled the scene. Many suspected it to be the case of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSP), which is a psychological condition that causes a caregiver to engage in attention-seeking behaviour. It makes the person or people under their care ill or makes people believe they are ill. Michael Stanfield, Gypsy Rose Blanchard's trial attorney, also said the same thing. He said, \"People were constantly telling Dee Dee what a wonderful mother she was, and Dee Dee was getting all of this attention.\" How did her mother manage to con people? Some reports mentioned that it is likely that this disorder, now termed a \"Factitious disorder imposed on another,\" is what prompted Dee Dee to lie to everyone. And also tried to convince everyone that her daughter was terribly ill and much younger than she was. The act had helped the mother and daughter get philanthropic donations, a trip to Disney World, and even a home in Springfield from Habitat for Humanity. They also met star Miranda Lambert through the hoax. Stanfield said that Gipsy Rose Blanchard's mother deceived doctors by claiming her daughter's medical records were lost during Hurricane Katrina. She used to hire a replacement doctor and shaved the girl's head to back up her account is being questioned. Gipsy also underwent unneeded treatments - one such was the excision of salivary glands. Her mother even persuaded doctors that it was essential by causing drooling with a topical anaesthetic. She didn't attend proper schooling and was also misled. Stanfield said, \"The doctors seem to confirm everything that you're being told. The outside world is telling you that your mother is a wonderful, loving, caring person. What other idea can you have?\" During the trial, Gypsy testified that her mother used to beat her and chained her to a bed. She mentioned that she started to get what exactly happening to her later, and she wasn't really sick. In 2018, Gypsy had testified at the trial of Godejohn of Big Bend, Wisconsin. She had admitted that she forced him into it. \"I wanted to be free of her hold on me,\" Gypsy said. (With inputs from agencies)",

According to the BareBones website, the show will go on as scheduled over Friday through Monday, and tickets from Thursday will be honored Monday, the rain date. Titled “When Calamity Strikes,” the show explores themes about technology, climate change and genocide through the use of more than 25 puppets. The performance also a way to welcome the changing of the seasons, honoring the “circle of life by celebrating its seasonal arc of death in the fall.” A largely volunteer-run organization, many of the people involved in BareBones also participate in the annual MayDay Parade , known as the rite of spring.",

    "text": "Disgraced Boston City Councilor Tania Fernandes Anderson brushed off most media, instead selecting two of her preferred outlets for remarks, on her first day back at City Hall after accepting a plea deal in a federal public corruption case.\nThe favoritism started on Tuesday when Fernandes Anderson released a statement exclusively to Boston Magazine stating that she would be resigning from the City Council, after federal prosecutors filed documents stating that she would be pleading guilty to two corruption charges and laying out the terms of the plea deal.\nIt wasn’t until hours later that Fernandes Anderson’s attorney began providing the same canned statement from the councilor to other media outlets, upon request.\nUntil outlets, including the Herald, could obtain the statement independently, they were bound ethically to attribute Fernandes Anderson’s statement as being reported by Boston Magazine, which was recently purchased by Boston Globe Media.\nThe same games continued Wednesday when reporters camped out at City Hall began to seek comment from Fernandes Anderson after she showed up roughly half an hour late to the weekly City Council meeting.\nRather than taking questions from all outlets, Fernandes Anderson chose to take a reporter and camera operator from NBC10 into her City Council office, while telling WCVB-TV political reporter Sharman Sacchetti, who was waiting with the NBC10 crew, that she would not be speaking with her station.\nWCVB-TV was the only news outlet on scene for Fernandes Anderson’s early-morning arrest on six public corruption charges last December. The station filmed the councilor as she was being arrested outside her Dorchester home, and the footage quickly went viral on social media.\nFernandes Anderson, according to the NBC10 reporter, would not answer questions about the case but spoke about her decision to attend the City Council meeting, after the terms of her plea agreement and plans to plead guilty were released by the feds and she announced her intention to resign.\nDuring the meeting, when Fernandes Anderson stepped out of the Council chamber to take a break in her office, she was again approached by a scrum of reporters, this time from many more outlets, and refused again to take questions, after doing the earlier interview.\nFernandes Anderson ignored questions, including one about when she would be resigning. Then 10 minutes later while still on break from the ongoing meeting, she went up to the waiting reporters and said that she would take questions from the media after the Council meeting.\n“I’ll be back after the meeting,” Fernandes Anderson said shortly before 2 p.m.. “I really have to go to the meeting, but I’ll be happy to meet with you after … I really want to be more thoughtful about my responses.”\nDuring that time, Fernandes Anderson was asked again when she would be resigning from the Council and was also asked about what emotions she was feeling after the plea deal was announced a day earlier.\nReporters emphasized that they had deadlines to meet, and continued to pitch questions to the councilor, who insisted that she had to get back to a meeting that she showed up late to and was, at that moment, on a break from attending.\nThe meeting went on for about another hour. At about 3 p.m., Fernandes Anderson went up to reporters gathered outside the City Council offices, where she had promised to take their questions, and asked which outlets were there.\nReporters from the Herald, Globe, Boston 25 News, CBS Boston, and WCVB-TV said they were present.\nFernandes Anderson then called out the Globe reporter by name, said she would call her later, and told the rest of the waiting media that she had no comment.\n“Sorry, I can’t speak with you guys,” Fernandes Anderson said.\nAs she was walking away, Fernandes Anderson was asked by the Herald, “So, you’re just speaking with the Globe?”\nAnother journalist asked Fernandes Anderson, “Why are you picking certain reporters?”\nAccording to a plea agreement, Fernandes Anderson will plead guilty to two of six public corruption charges that had been lodged against her in a December 2024 federal indictment.\nThe charges are tied to allegations that she doled out a $13,000 bonus to one of her City Council staff members, also a relative, on the condition that $7,000 be kicked back to her. The exchange was coordinated by text and took place in a City Hall bathroom in June 2023, the indictment states.\nU.S. Attorney Leah Foley plans to recommend that Fernandes Anderson be sentenced to a year and a day in prison, and ordered to pay $13,000 in restitution, per the terms of the plea agreement.\nThe timing of Fernandes Anderson’s resignation will determine whether the city will have time to hold a special election for her District 7 Council seat.\nThe city charter calls for a special election to fill an open district council seat if there’s more than 180 days until the election.\nMay 8 would mark 180 days, meaning that the seat could remain vacant until next January, if Fernandes Anderson, who makes $120,000, does not resign by that time. The district includes Roxbury, Dorchester, Fenway and part of the South End.\nFernandes Anderson was removed from all Council committees on Wednesday by Council President Ruthzee Louijeune.\nOriginally Published: April 9, 2025 at 5:47 PM EDT",

    "text": "Photo: Pascal Deloche / The Image Bank Unreleased / Getty Images\nA woman got into a wild altercation with a priest during Mass at St. Thomas Aquinas Church in St. Cloud, Florida. The Diocese of Orlando said that the woman went to receive Holy Communion but \"appeared unaware of the proper procedure.\"\nFather Fidel Rodriguez briefly spoke to the woman before blessing her and telling her to go to confession before returning to receive Communion.\nThe woman left and returned for the 12 p.m. Mass. When she went to receive Communion, Father Rodriguez asked if she had received the Sacrament of the Penance, and she replied that it was none of his business.\nThe woman then reached into the Communion tray, grabbed the Communion hosts, and started crushing them. Father Rodriguez attempted to restrain the woman, but she refused to let go of the Communion hosts. During the struggle, the woman pushed Rodriguez. In response, he bit her on the hand .\nThe woman was then asked to leave the church.\nFollowing the incident, the diocese defended Father Rodriguez's actions.\n\"Further, while the Diocese of Orlando does not condone physical altercations such as this, in good faith, Father Rodriguez was simply attempting to prevent an act of desecration of the Holy Communion, which, as a priest, Father Rodriguez is bound by duty to protect,\" the dioceses said in a statement.\nWhen speaking to police, Father Rodriguez admitted what happened and said he was acting in self-defense .\n\"I bit her. I am not denying that. I was defending myself and the sacrament,\" Father Rodriguez told the officers.\nNo charges have been filed, but officials said that the incident remains under investigation.",

    "text": "GILPIN COUNTY, Colo. — Last Thursday's snowstorm left behind more than five feet of snow in Gilpin County. One week later, some residents in Gilpin County and neighboring counties are preparing to be snowed in once again. In Boulder County, residents are busy stocking up for the weekend with more snow in the forecast. Ann Gillis has lived near Ward for 50 years and is no stranger to snowstorms. She was snowed in for several days and could only recently leave her home. \"Once the snow starts melting a little bit, it gets really icy and then refreezes,\" said Gillis. \"My road can be an ice skating rink.” 6:26 PM, Mar 14, 2024 Denver7 | Weather Local emergencies declared in Clear Creek, Gilpin counties for massive snowfall Gillis said her neighbors helped dig her out, but one of her cars is still buried under the snow. \"I couldn't tell where the Subaru was. It was just a big mouth of snow,\" said Gillis. In Gilpin County, crews finished widening roads Wednesday night. The county has more than 148 miles of road, which took multiple days to widen. Gilpin Sheriff Kevin Armstrong said crews will have to redo their work once the snow hits. \"It complicates things,\" said Armstrong. 10:32 PM, Mar 15, 2024 Denver7 | Weather Gilpin County man rescued after being trapped in five feet of snow for 10 hours Gilpin County commissioners previously voted to extend a local disaster declaration through March 21 to finish cleaning up the remains of the snow. Armstrong believes the county is prepared to handle the new round of snow but fears it could wreak havoc on unpaved roads. \"The melting of the snow and the water on the road is making it extremely muddy,\" said Armstrong. \"It's going to cause potential damage.\" Armstrong said emergency crews are well prepared and have the equipment necessary to reach families snowed in.",

    "title": "Altech Batteries Ltd (ASX:ATC) CERENERGY Cells Test Safe Under Extreme Conditions",
    "text": "CERENERGY Cells Test Safe Under Extreme Conditions\nPerth, April 3, 2025 AEST (ABN Newswire) - Altech Batteries Limited (ASX:ATC) (A3Y:FRA) (ALTHF:OTCMKTS) is pleased to announce that an individual single-cell stresstesting program conducted by JV partner Fraunhofer IKTS has confirmed the safety and operational robustness of the CERENERGY(R) battery technology.\nHighlights\n- Rigorous testing protocol of individual cells\n- Safety and operational robustness confirmed\n- Long term cycling\n- Over discharge, all safety mechanisms work, no damage\n- Over Charge tests - high voltage, no damage\n- C Rate Tests - no performance degradation, no cell damage\n- High Temperature Tests - stable, no damage\n- CERENERGY(R) batteries proven safe under extreme conditions\nOn 1 October 2024, the Company announced that the first CERENERGY(R) ABS60 battery prototype was successfully brought online and is operating as intended.\nDuring the production of the first prototype, additional individual cells were set aside for a rigorous testing protocol designed to evaluate performance under abnormal or stressed conditions, beyond standard operating parameters. These tests aimed to verify the performance, integrity, and resilience of the individual CERENERGY(R) battery cells-and have delivered excellent results, as detailed below.\nLong Term Cycling\nDaily charge and discharge cycling at 300 degC with a state of charge (SoC) range of 20-100% is ongoing, demonstrating that individual cells are performing consistently across the full capacity range, in line with the expected scientific forecasts.\nOver-discharge Test\nWhile the battery system includes protective mechanisms against overcharging, the test program is designed to evaluate performance under extreme conditions, including scenarios where these protections may fail. One such test-the over-discharge test-assesses the durability of CERENERGY(R) batteries at low voltage levels (<1.7 V). All tested cells successfully passed, demonstrating exceptional resilience, safety, and the ability to recover without damage, even under demanding conditions.\nOver Charge Test\nThe overcharge test evaluates the performance of CERENERGY(R) batteries under high-voltage conditions (>10 V for 15 hours-four times higher than the nominal voltage), simulating worst-case scenarios in which protection mechanisms may fail. All tested cells successfully passed, demonstrating the battery's robustness, effective integrated safety features, and strong resistance to damage caused by overcharging.\nC Rate Test\nThe C-rate is a measure used in CERENERGY(R) batteries to indicate the rate of charge or discharge relative to the battery's nominal capacity, expressed as a multiple of its ampere-hour (Ah) rating. It is a key parameter for evaluating battery performance across various applications. While high C-rates are typically employed in fast charge/discharge scenarios, they can often lead to performance degradation, cell damage, heat buildup, or efficiency losses. However, CERENERGY(R) battery cells have shown none of these negative effects and have proven to be as resilient as anticipated. Conversely, low C-rates are used to extend battery life and maintain optimal efficiency. The cells were tested across a range of C-rate regimes, including C/8, C/5, C/4, and C/3. The results demonstrated strong C-rate flexibility, enabling a wide range of potential use cases.\nCritical Operating Temperatures\nThermal stability testing under overheating conditions has been conducted to evaluate the upper limits of the CERENERGY(R) battery's operating temperature range. Cells were cycled at a C/8 rate up to 400 degC- 50 degC above the maximum expected operational temperature. Additional cells are currently undergoing cycling at C/8 and 350 degC, showing stable and consistent performance. These tests are ongoing to further assess the battery's thermal behaviour and overall robustness under elevated temperature conditions.\nFull Thermal Cycle Tests\nThermal cycle testing is ongoing, with cells being cycled at C/8 between 20-100% state of charge (SoC) at 300 degC. The testing protocol includes cells starting at 100% SoC (fully charged anode) and others at 20% SoC (nearly empty anode). Each thermal cycle comprises three electrical cycles, followed by a temperature transition between 300 degC and room temperature (hot-cold cycles). To date, the cells have successfully completed a significant number of thermal cycles, highlighting the durability of the CERENERGY(R) battery technology. The results confirm that the cells remain both mechanically and electrically stable throughout the process.\nC-Rate Test at high temperature\nThe cells were tested across a range of C-rate regimes, including C/8, C/5, C/4, and C/3, under extreme temperature conditions-specifically at 400 degC, significantly above the typical operating temperature of below 300 degC. No failures were recorded during these tests, demonstrating the robustness of the CERENERGY(R) battery cells even under severe conditions. Higher C-rate testing, including C/2 and beyond, is planned as part of the ongoing test regime to further evaluate and define the physical performance limits of the cells.\nCell Failure Test\nIndividual cell failure testing was conducted to assess whether electrical current flow would be disrupted in the event of one or more cell failures. This test is critical to evaluating the real-world performance and reliability of the ABS60 BatteryPack. The results demonstrated that cell failure does not negatively impact the overall system performance. The CERENERGY(R) BatteryPack continues to operate safely and reliably, maintaining functionality and continuous operation without significant risk or performance degradation, even when individual cells fail.\nCell Circuit Test\nIKTS performed a cell short-circuit test, which included a subsequent short circuit at 100% SoC with a discharge to 0.2 V. During the test, the current reached up to 120 A. The results indicated no leakage, gassing, or fracturing of the cell casing, demonstrating the cell's stability and safety under extreme conditions. Additional evaluations will be conducted to ensure ongoing reliability.\nConclusion\nGroup Managing Director Iggy Tan said \"These tests are crucial for evaluating potential risks, mismanagement, or external factors. Expert testing conducted by Fraunhofer IKTS, in accordance with international standards, has validated the robustness of CERENERGY(R) technology, showing no critical behaviour. The cells continued to operate for days or even weeks under extreme conditions that would cause typical lithium-ion cells to fail and require safety interventions. CERENERGY(R) batteries have proven to be safe under all conditions, ensuring uninterrupted operation without risk or performance degradation, even in the event of individual cell failure.\"\nAbout Altech Batteries Ltd\nAltech Batteries Limited (ASX:ATC) (FRA:A3Y) is a specialty battery technology company that has a joint venture agreement with world leading German battery institute Fraunhofer IKTS (\"Fraunhofer\") to commercialise the revolutionary CERENERGY(R) Sodium Alumina Solid State (SAS) Battery. CERENERGY(R) batteries are the game-changing alternative to lithium-ion batteries. CERENERGY(R) batteries are fire and explosion-proof; have a life span of more than 15 years and operate in extreme cold and desert climates. The battery technology uses table salt and is lithium-free; cobalt-free; graphite-free; and copper-free, eliminating exposure to critical metal price rises and supply chain concerns.\nThe joint venture is commercialising its CERENERGY(R) battery, with plans to construct a 100MWh production facility on Altech's land in Saxony, Germany. The facility intends to produce CERENERGY(R) battery modules to provide grid storage solutions to the market.\n| ||\n|",
