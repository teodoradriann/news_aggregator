    "text": "TAHLEQUAH, Okla. — The Cherokee Nation honored three Veterans with the Medal of Patriotism during the Council of the Cherokee Nation's April meeting. Christopher Huitt and Luke Brown were recognized by Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr., Deputy Chief Bryan Warner and Secretary of Veteran Affairs S. Joe Crittenden. Navy Veteran Daniel Brown was posthumously honored by the tribe. The Cherokee Nation says they recognize Cherokee service men and women for their sacrifices as a way to show the high regard in which all Veterans are held by the tribe. \"It's been an honor, this really touches me deep,\" Huitt said. \"I'm honored by our people and it's an honor that I've made our people proud.\" The Cherokee Nation says that Native Americans, including Cherokees, are thought to have more citizens serving per capita than any other ethnic group. \"Thank you all for being here and honoring us today,\" Luke Brown said. \"It's an honor to be able to stand in the ranks with everyone else.\" Daniel and Luke's mother, Tanya Brown, received the award on his behalf. \"I'm the Cherokee of the family and I just appreciate you honoring my offspring and inviting us to come and honoring us in this way,\" she said.

    "text": "The head of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on Wednesday appealed for the international community to provide an urgent boost in funding and commitment to address Sudan’s escalating humanitarian crisis, now entering its tenth month. A staggering six million people have been displaced within Sudan [since the war between rival militaries](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/04/1135702) the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RAF) erupted on 15 April 2023. A further 1.7 million civilians have sought refuge across borders in South Sudan, Chad, Ethiopia, Egypt, the Central African Republic, and Libya. Their plight demands urgent global attention and an immediate ceasefire, IOM Director General Amy Pope said, having witnessed the devastating impact for herself during a recent visit to eastern Chad. “A ceasefire in Sudan is urgently needed to enable people to rebuild their lives with dignity. We must not turn our back on the suffering of millions of people affected by such devastating conflict,” she said. “Now, more than ever, we need all possible support to continue providing lifesaving humanitarian assistance and move towards recovery and long-term solutions.” Funds needed IOM has launched an appeal for $307 million in 2024 to support 1.2 million people affected by the conflict, including internally displaced individuals, refugees, returnees, and third-country nationals. The UN agency has supported over one million individuals in Sudan and neighboring countries so far, with cash assistance, facilitating safe transportation also delivering critical health, protection, water, sanitation, and hygiene support. ‘No end in sight’ The human rights expert appointed by the UN High Commissioner to monitor Sudan, echoed that call on Wednesday for an immediate end to the violence and transition to civilian rule. Radhouane Nouicer, appointed just over a year ago, demanded justice for the multiple abuses recorded so far. “As fighting between the SAF and the RSF spreads across the country, violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are continuing unabated. It is crucial that the leaders of both sides show more political will to put an end to violence and silence the guns,” he said. “In my regular meetings with Sudanese civil society representatives, I have heard horrific reports of human suffering, including hundreds of suspected cases of enforced disappearance and multiple cases of arbitrary detention by both parties to the conflict,” he added. Rise in ethnic violence Nouicer also expressed alarm at the rise in ethnically motivated violence and hate speech, particularly in the Darfur region, where the RSF and allied Arab militias have targeted the African Masalit community. Reports of conscription of children and mobilization of civilians into so-called “popular” resistance groups are also deeply concerning. In all, over 25 million civilians including over 14 million children need humanitarian assistance and protection. There have also been deeply disturbing accounts of sexual violence against women and girls, most of them allegedly perpetrated by RSF members and their allied militia. ‘This must not continue’ “Sudan a most fertile land is running out of food, and millions are facing acute hunger, but despite the enormous need, delivering aid remains extremely challenging due to ongoing hostilities, persistent insecurity, attacks on humanitarian workers and bureaucratic hurdles,” Nouicer said. At least 45 aid workers have been killed or detained since the start of the conflict – almost all Sudanese nationals. Fuel shortages also continue to affect the movement of humanitarian staff and supplies and the generation of power needed for operations, such as maintaining cold chain storage and running water pumps. “This must not continue. The Government of Sudan, which has the primary responsibility to protect civilians, must take concrete steps to ensure sufficient aid can reach all those in need and facilitate the access of humanitarian convoys to the populations affected by the conflict,” stressed the expert.",

В интервью Politico она заявила о необходимости ограничений против отдельных экстремистски настроенных членов кабинета премьер-министра Израиля Биньямина Нетаньяху.\nПосле встречи с главой европейской дипломатии Кайей Каллас Стенергард подчеркнула, что Швеция будет настаивать на санкциях против таких министров, добавив: «Я хочу подчеркнуть, что мы настоящие друзья израильского народа, но по-прежнему наша обязанность — оказать давление на израильское правительство».\nДля введения санкций ЕС требуется единогласная поддержка всех 27 стран-членов, что, по мнению Politico, маловероятно из-за противодействия сторонников Израиля, таких как Венгрия.\n11 июня 2025 года Австралия, Канада, Новая Зеландия, Норвегия и Великобритания ввели санкции против министра национальной безопасности Израиля Итамара Бен-Гвира и министра финансов Бецалеля Смотрича за подстрекательство к насилию против палестинцев на Западном берегу.",

    "text": "Retired police sergeant on vacation with family rescues couple from sinking car CINCINNATI ( [WXIX](https://www.fox19.com/2024/06/21/retired-cpd-sergeant-family-rescue-unknown-tri-state-couple-during-florida-vacation/)/Gray News) - A retired Cincinnati police sergeant and his family saved an Ohio couple who just happened to be vacationing in the same area in Florida. The Ramsey family is from Ohio, while the Bell family lives in northern Kentucky. Up until June 11, the two families had no idea they lived so close to one another. Some might call it a coincidence. Others will say it’s luck, but these two families call it a miracle. Dean and Shana Ramsey recall the moment they said they almost drowned while vacationing in Siesta Key, Florida. Several streets flooded that day after the area received more than 11 inches of rain, an abnormal amount, according to Sarasota County officials. “You couldn’t see anything but rain and water,” Dean Ramsey recalled. With several cars stalled on the road, the couple said they tried to pull off on what they thought was land. “The water sucked us right into that lagoon and that was it,” Dean Ramsey explained. Watching in horror from their condo was retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant Mike Bell, his wife Ginger Bell and their three young kids. The Bell family responded. “We were able to stop, slow things down, and assess and make some decisions on how we were going to move forward,” Mike Bell said. That plan started with Mackenzie Bell giving valuable information to 911. “I remembered they needed to know the address, so that’s the first thing I told her and then I told her a car is in the pond and there was two people in there,” Mike’s and Ginger Bell’s daughter, Mackenzie Bell, said. Meanwhile, the retired sergeant and his wife, who is an emergency medical doctor, took action. “I went over to the edge of the water and realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” Mike Bell recounted from that moment. “At that time, Ginger exited the front door next to the pond. I look at her and said, ‘We need flotation devices.’” That’s where little Hank Bell came in. “I didn’t want them to die, so I ran as fast as I could,” Hank Bell explained. “I went up the elevator, which is extremely slow, and I knew there were stairs that were faster. So, I ran down the stairs.” Flotation devices in hand, the Bell kids handed them to their parents who were already in the water. “He went into the lady’s side and I went into the man’s side,” Ginger Bell said. “She was able to climb out on her own, but I put the boogie board right in front of her. She got her body on the boogie board and that’s when I started paddling and we kicked over to the side.” Ginger Bell ran into some issues helping Dean Ramsey. “When he was trying to get out, his foot got stuck, so he was on his back with one foot out and one foot stuck in the steering wheel,” Ginger Bell remembered. “I looked at her and I said, ‘I’m stuck, I can’t,’” Dean Ramsey remembered. “At that time, I was like, ‘I’m going down with the car,’ but she’s like, ‘Get out of this car! You got to get out! Kick your leg!’ I started thrashing my leg and my foot popped out.” The rescue took about five minutes. Back on dry land, the Ramsey family saw their rescuers as “guardian angels.” The families say they have plans to reunite in the near future. The Bell family wants to remind residents to always be mindful of their surroundings and assess a situation before getting involved. They said if your car is going in a body of water, roll down the windows or punch them out by hitting the corners. Those tactics could save a life. Copyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "Citing multiple sources, Reuters reported on the 13th (local time) that the U.S. is secretly planting location tracking devices in cargo to prevent the smuggling of AI chips shipped overseas into China. It has even introduced an unusual method to capture the flow of advanced AI chips into areas subject to U.S. export regulations.\nAfter the investigation by the U.S. authorities, the location tracking device will be attached only to certain cargoes. Reuters evaluated, \"It shows how intense the U.S. is to enforce chip export regulations.\"\nAccording to sources, the installation of the location tracking device is mainly involved by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industrial Security (BIS). The Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are also participating. It is a pan-governmental move to prevent the flow of advanced U.S. AI chips into China. U.S. authorities are using the information obtained by the tracker to prosecute companies and individuals who violate export controls. However, it has not been confirmed when the U.S. authorities began wearing location trackers after the implementation of export controls for advanced AI chips to China in 2022.\nIn industrial sites, location tracking devices are said to be used as open secrets. Reuters reported that five officials involved in the supply chain of AI servers knew that location tracking devices were installed in server cargo manufactured by Dell and Super Microcomputer. The server includes chips manufactured by Nvidia and AMD.\nThere were also detailed testimonies. Some officials told Reuters that last year, among the Dell server cargoes containing Nvidia chips, there were cases where the server itself had a small location tracker as well as delivery boxes and internal packaging. It is also reported that resellers remove location tracking devices from Dell and super microcomputer servers to divert advanced AI chips. The server and chip manufacturers mentioned did not say they did not know about the existence of the location tracking device or made any special comments. However, Nvidia told Reuters, \"We do not install secret tracking devices on our products.\"\nThe war of nerves between the United States and China over the import and export of AI chips is currently ongoing. Earlier last month, the U.S. Donald Trump administration and Congress drew backlash from China when they mentioned asking their companies to install a location check function on AI chips being exported. In addition, on the 31st of the same month, China's National Internet Information Office (CAC) raised concerns about Nvidia's \"H20\" chip, which is allowed to be sold in China, and demanded that the company submit evidence.\n[Reporter Choi Hyunjae]",

    "text": "Sumar afirma que Errejón reconoció “hechos moralmente reprobables” tras la denuncia anónima\nEl exdiputado y portavoz de Sumar en el Congreso de los Diputados, Íñigo Errejón, presentó este jueves su dimisión tras la publicación de varias denuncias anónimas en redes sociales que lo acusaban de comportamientos machistas y acoso sexual. El político madrileño ha renunciado tanto a su escaño como a su puesto en la ejecutiva de la coalición, lo que ha desencadenado una rápida reacción de la formación liderada por Yolanda Díaz, que ha abierto una investigación interna para esclarecer los hechos.\nEl caso comenzó a hacerse público el pasado martes, cuando la periodista Cristina Fallarás compartió en Instagram una denuncia anónima que describía a un “político muy conocido de Madrid” como un “maltratador psicológico” y un “verdadero monstruo”. Aunque el mensaje no mencionaba explícitamente a Errejón, en el seno de Sumar muchos identificaron al exdiputado como el destinatario de estas graves acusaciones, lo que encendió las alarmas dentro del partido.\nSegún ha explicado Elizabeth Duval, secretaria de Comunicación de Sumar, el partido actuó de inmediato al conocer las acusaciones. “El martes por la mañana recibimos el anónimo de Cristina Fallarás, y desde ese momento iniciamos una investigación interna”, declaró Duval en una entrevista en el programa Hora 25. Durante el proceso, Errejón fue confrontado con las denuncias y, según la portavoz, reconoció haber tenido “comportamientos moralmente reprobables”, lo que llevó a la formación a solicitar su dimisión.\nDuval también subrayó que el comportamiento admitido por Errejón no es compatible con los valores feministas que defiende Sumar. “Él reconoció unos hechos que son moralmente reprobables, unos hechos que en ningún caso cumplen con el estándar de ejemplaridad feminista que se le debe exigir a cualquier político a cualquier cargo público, pero particularmente a un cargo político de izquierdas y es por eso también por lo que quisiéramos explicaciones. Los comportamientos eran intolerables y no quedaba otra opción”, afirmó Duval, quien reiteró que el partido seguirá investigando si existen más casos de este tipo.\nLos cargos de Sumar censuran el comportamiento\nLa noticia de la dimisión de Errejón ha provocado una ola de reacciones en el ámbito político. Yolanda Díaz, vicepresidenta segunda del Gobierno y líder de Sumar, se pronunció desde Bogotá, donde se encontraba en una visita oficial, afirmando que la decisión de apartar a Errejón fue resultado del proceso de investigación abierto dentro del partido. “Nuestro compromiso contra el machismo y por una sociedad feminista es firme y sin excepciones”, aseguró Díaz en un comunicado difundido en la red social X (antes Twitter).\nPor su parte, otros miembros destacados de la coalición también han manifestado su apoyo a la dimisión de Errejón. El ministro de Cultura, Ernest Urtasun, escribió en sus redes que la coherencia entre lo que se dice y lo que se hace es una “exigencia ineludible” para los partidos progresistas. Mientras tanto, la portavoz de Más Madrid en la Asamblea, Manuela Bergerot, calificó los comportamientos reconocidos como “intolerables”.\nLa controversia se intensificó el jueves por la tarde cuando la actriz y presentadora Elisa Mouliaá hizo pública su denuncia de acoso sexual contra Errejón a través de sus redes sociales. “Yo soy víctima de acoso sexual por parte de Íñigo Errejón y quiero denunciarlo”, escribió Mouliaá, convirtiéndose en la primera mujer en alzar la voz de manera pública sobre el caso.\nCon la dimisión de Errejón, Sumar enfrenta ahora una complicada gestión interna para esclarecer las acusaciones y proteger la credibilidad de su proyecto político, basado en principios de justicia social y feminismo. Mientras avanza la investigación, el partido ha manifestado su compromiso de escuchar y apoyar a las víctimas y garantizar que situaciones de este tipo no vuelvan a repetirse en su seno. @mundiario",
