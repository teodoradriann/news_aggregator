    "title": "Meet the Characters of Marvel Studios’ Echo - D23",
    "text": "By Courtney Potter It’s a sure-to-be-thrilling way to kick off the new year... The good folks at Marvel Studios will soon present Echo, spotlighting Maya Lopez as she’s pursued by Wilson Fisk’s criminal empire. When the journey brings her home, she’s forced to confront her own family and legacy. Echo stars Alaqua Cox (Hawkeye) as Maya Lopez, as well as Chaske Spencer (Wild Indian, The English), Tantoo Cardinal (Killers of the Flower Moon, Stumptown), Devery Jacobs (FX’s Reservation Dogs, American Gods), Zahn McClarnon (Dark Winds, FX’s Reservation Dogs), and Cody Lightning (Hey, Viktor!, Four Sheets to the Wind)—with Graham Greene (1883, Goliath) and Vincent D’Onofrio (Hawkeye, Daredevil, Law & Order: Criminal Intent), who returns to the villainous role of Wilson Fisk, aka Kingpin. Episodes of the series are directed by Sydney Freeland (Navajo) and Catriona McKenzie (Gunaikurnai); Kevin Feige, Stephen Broussard, Louis D’Esposito, Brad Winderbaum, Victoria Alonso, Richie Palmer, Jason Gavin (Blackfeet), Marion Dayre, and Sydney Freeland are executive producers, and Jennifer L. Booth and Amy Rardin are co-executive producers. With Echo’s big premiere on Tuesday, January 9, we’re taking a closer look at who’s who in the highly anticipated series: Maya Lopez (Alaqua Cox) Maya is a force to be reckoned with. She’s skilled in martial arts and hand-to-hand combat—and is at home on her motorcycle. When she flees New York City after assassinating the crime boss Kingpin, she’s forced to reunite with the family she left long ago under tragic circumstances. “In Hawkeye, Maya was a villain,” says director Sydney Freeland. “And while she’s our protagonist in Echo, we wanted to embrace those darker sides and flaws within the character, who is on an extreme emotional journey trying to navigate the pent-up anger inside her. She’s a very nuanced character with culture and ancestry in the Choctaw community, which is something we hadn’t seen before.” In addition to the character’s cultural background, Maya’s physical prowess underscores her mental toughness and is indicative of her soon-to-be antihero status. Cox left her home on the Menominee Indian Reservation in Keshena, Wisconsin, to join the Hawkeye cast just a few years ago. “When I jumped into the Marvel world, it was a big transition for me, but I was so grateful for the opportunity and journey,” says the actor, who learned about plans for Echo while filming Hawkeye. “I felt so overwhelmed and shocked because it was a lead role in my second project, which seemed kind of crazy. I remember telling my family and it just meant so much because it gives Indigenous people a leading character and real representation in an authentic way. It feels amazing to be able to have the opportunity inspire and empower a future generation of people.” The actor is intently aware of what the character’s physicality will mean to others in the amputee community. “I wanted to show people that amputees and people with disabilities can do anything,” says Cox. “Although I am deaf and an amputee, I was able to do a lot of my fighting and stunts—and it was important to me to show my prosthetic leg and not try to hide it under clothes. Maya Lopez is a badass, and I wanted people with disabilities to have someone that they could look up to and see within themselves.” Additionally, Cox’s Maya is the second deaf hero to join the MCU, after Lauren Ridloff’s Makkari in Eternals. It was important to filmmakers that the storytelling and approach to production embraced the character’s preferred way of communicating with others. In fact, many scenes feature no spoken dialogue; the production also provided weekly group learning sessions for the filmmakers and crew to help with the overall communication on set. “All the people on the crew were able to take sign language classes for a few months before we actually started filming, which was really cool,” says Cox. Says director Sydney Freeland, “After studying American Sign Language and talking with [consulting producer and ASL master] Doug Ridloff, one of the things that became apparent was that the hands are an extension of one’s emotion and expression. The hands are the text, and the face is the subtext, and you need those two things together to get an idea of what a person’s feeling. We built our entire visual language with that in mind.” Wilson Fisk, aka Kingpin (Vincent D’Onofrio) Fisk was once known as “Uncle” to Maya, who looked up to him after relocating to New York City with her father as a child. Fisk was long ago crowned Kingpin by the NYC criminal underworld. He was rightly feared by all—nobody dared challenge Kingpin—at least not until Maya Lopez discovered that he gave the orders to have her father killed. Their final encounter ended in a gunshot... but Fisk has the kind of power that always seems to eclipse even the grimmest circumstances. “I love that Echo is Maya Lopez’s origin story,” says the actor. “You get introduced to this Native American world and it’s intense, spiritual, and deeply emotional—it’s all about her family and ancestors. Kingpin is both a physically and emotionally brutal character. There is a strong layer of a father-daughter thing with Kingpin and Maya. It’s a great way to bring out all kinds of intensities and emotions and their dynamic has this flavor that’s completely unique.” Henry “Black Crow” Lopez (Chaske Spencer) Henry is Maya’s well-intended uncle who owns the local roller-skating rink. But Henry has a troubled past that he can’t quite escape—including ties to Fisk’s criminal underworld. Spencer, who fills Uncle Henry’s shoes, says not only is his character the brother of Maya’s late father, William, he still has his hands in the very business that led to her father’s untimely death. “Henry feels guilty about his brother’s death, and there’s a lot that Maya brings to the situation that I don’t think Henry is ready to face yet,” he explains. Skully (Graham Greene) Wise, funny, and kind-natured, Skully owns the town pawn shop. He is a grandfather figure to Maya, offering his support, warmth, and guidance along the way. Unlike many of her estranged family members, Skully is willing to set aside any differences and move forward with love. “When Maya was a young child, [Skully] was going out with her grandmother, Chula,” says Greene. “Maya comes back into his life after she damages her prosthetic leg and wants him to repair it for her—it helps rekindle their relationship.” Chula (Tantoo Cardinal) Chula is Maya’s estranged grandmother. Her overwhelming anger following the tragic loss of her daughter, Maya’s mother, led to the hasty departure of Maya and her father. Maya, so young and impressionable, shared in Chula’s grief—but the distance between them has only grown in the years since they last saw each other. For Cardinal, her character’s maternal instincts are being tested by Maya so many years later. “In the beginning of the series, Maya and Chula’s relationship is pretty fractured and they are not in a good place,” the actress says. “Maya comes from strength, but she also comes from a place of confusion.” Bonnie (Devery Jacobs) Bonnie is Maya’s estranged cousin and childhood best friend who works as an EMT in Tamaha, Oklahoma. She and Maya were like sisters as kids, and Bonnie took it hard when Maya left. She’d love nothing more than to be close again with Maya. “Maya Lopez is so badass, and she goes through the world very guarded,” says Jacobs. “But it’s through glimpses of interacting with Bonnie that we really get to see Maya’s heart and vulnerability.” Biscuits (Cody Lightning) Biscuits is Maya’s well-meaning cousin, who helps her get settled when she returns home to Oklahoma. “Biscuits is Maya’s sidekick, who provides some comic relief for her,” says Lightning. “He’s like a big, earnest puppy dog—but he’s very resourceful and always figures out a way to get things done for Maya. He’s very loyal and will do anything for his family, even if that means getting into some trouble.”",

    "title": "Lawsuit settled: 2 top US gun parts makers agree to temporarily halt sales in Philadelphia - The San Diego Union-Tribune",
    "text": "Two of America's leading gun parts manufacturers have agreed to temporarily halt sales of their products in Philadelphia and elsewhere in Pennsylvania, city officials said Thursday, announcing a settlement of their lawsuit against the companies. Philadelphia filed suit against Polymer80 and JSD Supply in July, accusing the manufacturers of perpetuating gun violence in the city by manufacturing and selling untraceable, self-manufactured weapons commonly known as “ghost guns.” The suit came under a broader legal effort to restrict where manufacturers can market their assemble-at-home guns. David Pucino, legal director of Giffords Law Center, which represented the city, accusing Polymer80 and JSD Supply of “reckless business practices ... that threatened public safety.” “The gun industry must be held accountable when it breaks the law and endangers Americans,” he said in a statement. Under the settlement, JSD Supply, based in Butler, Pennsylvania, agreed it would no longer sell its products in the state for four years, city officials said. Dayton, Nevada-based Polymer80 agreed to a four-year ban on sales to customers in Philadelphia and the nearby counties of Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Lehigh, Montgomery and Northampton, which include the cities of Allentown, Easton, Reading and Lancaster. Additionally, Polymer80 agreed to pay $1.3 million, which Philadelphia officials said will fund efforts to address gun violence. The settlement was expected to be filed with the court on Friday. Messages were left at both companies seeking comment on the agreement. “These weapons have ended up in the hands of our youth and individuals who are not otherwise permitted to possess a firearm, and the consequences in our communities have been devastating,” Renee Garcia, Philadelphia's city solicitor, said in a statement. Ghost guns, which can be purchased without a background check and assembled at home, have become the weapon of choice for children, criminals and others who cannot lawfully own a gun, according to city officials. They have been used in a staggering number of shootings in recent years. Between 2019 and 2022, police recorded a fourfold increase in the number of ghost guns that had been used to commit crimes, according to the city's lawsuit. In 2022, city police seized 575 of the guns. Last July, a gunman armed with an AR-15-style weapon and a handgun — both self-manufactured — went on a shooting spree that killed five people in Philadelphia. Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, announcing the settlement at a news conference to discuss her first 100 days in office, said Polymer80 and JSD produced 90% of the ghost guns recovered in the city, “We needed to find a way to hold them accountable for their role in supplying the crime gun market, and perpetuating gun violence,” she said. In February, Polymer80 agreed to stop selling its firearms to Maryland residents under a settlement with the city of Baltimore. Last month, a federal judge permanently banned a Florida gun retailer from selling or delivering certain gun parts in New York that officials say could be used to assemble untraceable ghost guns and sold without background checks.",

    "text": "Forgo cash cows to save Lord Ayyappa’s divine forest\nIn all these political machinations, there are two things that political parties have conveniently forgotten. One is the temple’s sanctity, and the second is the pilgrims.\nPublished: 24th December 2023 05:00 AM | Last Updated: 22nd December 2023 10:43 AM | A+A A-\nAnother pilgrimage season in Sabarimala is in full swing, and another set of controversy has erupted. This famous pilgrimage place deep inside the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary has been in the news for all the wrong reasons for the past few years. Five years ago, it became the battle-ground for left ‘liberal’ activist politicians who were convinced that Indian women’s liberation would come from them being allowed in this temple and the right-wing conservatives who were gleefully rubbing their hands in anticipation of a golden opportunity to whip up religious sentiments and convert them to votes. Unfortunately, both ended up losing in the next elections. The new controversy now is the failure in crowd management that has resulted in huge inconvenience to everyone concerned and political parties of all hues have jumped into the controversy, accusing each other and trying to gain mileage out of the total mismanagement by the Dewasom Board.\nIn all these political machinations, there are two things that political parties have conveniently forgotten. One is the temple’s sanctity, and the second is the pilgrims. The forest shrine of Sabarimala is unique among many pilgrimage places in India. It opens only for a limited number of days in the year. It is located in an environmentally fragile place, deep inside a national tiger sanctuary. The concept is that of a forest shrine that is secluded from civilisation. One needs to undergo many privations of mind and body for some time, both during the penance period and during the pilgrimage.\nBy custom, one needs to follow 41 days of strict austerities where one needs to avoid all non-vegetarian food, take a bath before sunrise, sleep on the floor, practice celibacy, wear no footwear, tell no lies or cause harm even inadvertently to any living being, meditate and undergo many such penances. The pilgrim loses his or her identity and name, and everyone becomes either Ayyappa or Malikapuram based on gender. The differences of caste, creed, language or religion are forgotten, and the pilgrim is supposed to walk through dense forest for days without footwear or any protection other than his belief in the forest god of Ayyappa, which is himself. It is believed that the wild elephants and tigers that abound in this holy forest won’t harm anyone making this pilgrimage.\nIf the pilgrim forgets this concept of ‘Aham Brahmasmi’ or ‘I am Ayyappa’, it is written in bold letters at the temple entrance—‘Tatwamasi’—or thou are that. In short, this long and arduous journey of self-reflection is to remind oneself about oneness with nature and the true nature of one’s self. It is also about developing self-control and overcoming prejudices based on caste, creed and other identities that get attached to one’s ego. By breaking the coconut at the temple entrance, the pilgrim is again reminded about the breaking of the ego.\nUnlike many temples in other parts of India, Sabarimala’s primary purpose is not having a darshan of the idol. Kerala temples are not designed as places for congregational worship or for having a glimpse of the murti. Among many forms of worship in Hinduism, there is nothing right or wrong about any method. The problem becomes an issue when the Sabarimala shrine is turned into a place of congregational worship and idol darshan like other temples, forgetting the basic tenets. The issue becomes a crisis when the pilgrims forget the concept of penance and Ayyappa and throng the temple like a cheap tourist destination.\nThey come in luxury buses and cars, flood the fragile forest with toxic fumes, litter the pristine areas, and convert the holy Pampa River into a garbage drain. This is nothing new for anyone who has visited India’s temple towns. The holier the town is, the filthier we make it. This crisis turns into a disaster when this desperate need of millions of casual pilgrims—who have no time for penance but want a few microseconds of darshan in a place that was never meant to have so many pilgrims—meet the incompetence and greed of the state Devasom Board, which manages the temple.\nThis disaster turned into a catastrophe when the state administration used the shrine as a cash cow to milk and fill their empty coffers. In the years we are lucky, we get away with unspeakable inconvenience to the thronging pilgrims who have to wait in the haphazardly erected, ridiculously planned clutter of shacks or in the hot sun for hours. In unfortunate years like 2011 or 1999, we witness stampedes that have taken hundreds of lives. As if they are not satisfied with the mess that has been created so far, the central government has joined hands with the state in putting up an airport near the temple, deep inside the jungle, to attract more tourists.\nThe use of the word tourist is deliberate as most people turning Sabarimala into a mela ground no longer deserve to be called pilgrims. Woe is to the genuine pilgrims with no place to go without jostling and fighting through this throng. The journey through the thick jungle teeming with tigers and wild elephants of yesteryears was far more meaningful and divine.\nThey can clear the entire Periyar wildlife reserve, and still, won’t be able to accommodate the number of tourists who are going to masquerade as pilgrims in the coming years. Unless we restrict the number of pilgrims who can visit the forest shrine, we are heading towards a Sabarimala metropolitan city built of shacks and plastic sheets with a filthy drain for Pampa river. Why not have a transparent lottery system that would select the people who can visit the shrine in a particular year? If you get the lottery, it is Lord Ayyappa’s will, and he is calling you. If you don’t get the lottery of visitation, who are you to question the lord’s will? And if you don’t believe in Ayyappa’s will, why are you going there in the first place? This could be a solution with one caveat. This would kill the cash cow that is feeding many politicians and bureaucrats’ pockets but may save Ayyappa’s divine forest and the shrine.\nAnand Neelakantan\nAuthor of Asura, Ajaya series, Vanara and Bahubali trilogy\nmail@asura.co.in",

I have been stopped from going. The travel warning was issued by the United States Embassy in Mexico on January 31 and refers to Ciudad Hidalgo, Chiapas, Mexico. “The United States Embassy in Mexico City has informed American citizens that due to recent security incidents, United States Government employees will not be able to travel to the city of Ciudad Hidalgo, including its surrounding areas within a radius of 10 kilometers (6.2 mi). ), located in the southern part of the state of Chiapas on the border between Mexico and Guatemala,” the travel warning reads.

They also asked their citizens to pay attention to incidents in those areas through local media and to dial 911 in case of emergency. Another recommendation is to follow instructions from local officials as well as review personal safety plans. alert level The United States government has four levels of travel alerts for its citizens. - The lowest level is 1 and travelers are asked to take general precautions. - Level 2 is where increased precautions are requested. - Level 3 is one that recommends reconsidering your trip - Level 4 is the highest and it is advised not to travel there Situation in Chiapas There has been a dispute between drug trafficking gangs over control of territory in that state, which borders Guatemala, according to Mexican media reports.
