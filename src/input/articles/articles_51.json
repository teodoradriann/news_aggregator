    "text": "Press Release Fort Bend County convicted felon sentenced to federal prison for firearms violation Thursday, June 27, 2024 Share Facebook X LinkedIn Email For Immediate Release U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of Texas BEAUMONT, Texas – A Richmond man was sentenced to federal prison for firearms violations in the Eastern District of Texas, announced U.S. Attorney Damien M. Diggs.\nAaron Martinez, 33, pleaded guilty to being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm and was sentenced to 87 months in federal prison by U.S. District Judge Marcia A. Crone on June 27, 2024.\nAccording to information presented in court, on August 3, 2021, Martinez was stopped for a traffic violation in Vidor. During the stop, it was discovered that Martinez had an outstanding felony warrant. A search of the vehicle revealed a loaded firearm and ammunition. Further investigation showed Martinez to be a convicted felon and prohibited by federal law from owning or possessing firearms or ammunition.\nThis case was prosecuted as part of the joint federal, state, and local Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN) Program, the centerpiece of the Department of Justice’s violent crime reduction efforts. PSN is an evidence-based program proven to be effective at reducing violent crime. Through PSN, a broad spectrum of stakeholders work together to identify the most pressing violent crime problems in the community and develop comprehensive solutions to address them. As part of this strategy, PSN focuses enforcement efforts on the most violent offenders and partners with locally based prevention and reentry programs for lasting reductions in crime.\nThis case was investigated by the Vidor Police Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Rachel Grove.\n###\nUpdated June 27, 2024",

    "title": "This Oral-B Electric Toothbrush Is Nearly Half-off Post Christmas",
    "text": "One of the best toothbrushes on the market is [45% off on Amazon today, going for about $55](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O8ODHOA?tag=spycom00-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US&asc_source=web&asc_campaign=web&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fspy.com%2Farticles%2Fgrooming%2Fhygiene%2Foral-b-pro-5000-sale-1202999537%2F). It’s the best $60 deal this side of an ugly concert hoodie. The [Oral-B Pro 5000 Smartseries Power Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush](https://www.amazon.com/Oral-B-Smartseries-Toothbrush-Bluetooth-Connectivity/dp/B07KQ47SJ4?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e6111dd7_3&asc_source=web&asc_campaign=web&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fspy.com%2Farticles%2Fgrooming%2Fhygiene%2Foral-b-pro-5000-sale-1202999537%2F) is only about $15 more than the [Oral-B Pro 1000 model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AKGRTUM/?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=xm2&ascsubtag=AwE kwF&asc_source=web&asc_campaign=web&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fspy.com%2Farticles%2Fgrooming%2Fhygiene%2Foral-b-pro-5000-sale-1202999537%2F), making it a steal. It’s pretty much the best thing Oral-B makes, and the brand whips out all stops for a toothbrush that functions more like a magic screwdriver. The Oral-B 5000 has an automatic pressure sensor, for one, which isn’t just a throwaway feature. It helps protect its user’s gums, which is important in preventing gum recession and therefore cavities (the inspiration for [a very real Brooklyn Nine-Nine bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gfLbcEW0U)). The 5000 also has a two-minute timer ( [the standard expert recommendation for brushing your teeth](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/brushing-your-teeth/faq-20058193)), and bluetooth connectivity, meaning that you can log your brushing habits over time, if that’s your thing. It also has the American Dental Association’s stamp approval, with Oral-B claiming that it’s the first electronic toothbrush to earn that distinction. A mic drop moment in the face of Panasonic Truthers. Amazon reviewers praise the brush’s light weight, its long battery life, and the thorough, rotational arc of the brush. The app itself also received a glowing reception, which may be surprising to some who are dubious about the smartphoneification of everything. But the app shows its user diagrams of the teeth they’re not brushing enough – or brushing too much – even color-coding the coverage you’re getting as you’re using it. It’s an app maybe worth deleting Duolingo for. German fluency may not be in your 2024, but a better smile might be.",
