    "text": "( CNN) — The New York Police Department is investigating whether a Queens man who was arrested Wednesday had plans to carry out an attack before he was pulled over and found with a gun, eight loaded magazines and other weapons, according to police officials with knowledge of the investigation.\nOfficers stopped Judd Sanson after noticing a blacked-out license plate on the Black Ford Explorer he was driving around 1:30 a.m., according to NYPD. The officers ended up finding a large cache of weapons, handcuffs, NYPD uniform items and a New York City transit vest, NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey B. Maddrey told reporters Wednesday.\nSanson, 27, was taken into custody and now faces charges of criminal possession of a weapon – a loaded firearm, criminal possession of a weapon, unlawful possession of ammo feed device, and an obscured license plate, the NYPD told CNN in an email.\nIn court Thursday, his lawyer entered a not guilty plea and Sanson was remanded into custody. His next hearing is set for Monday.\nDuring their search of Sanson’s car, officers also found a 9-millimeter Glock, 100 rounds of ammunition, a stun gun, multiple knives, a weighted whip, an expandable baton, heavy body armor and two axes, Maddrey said.\nThe man allegedly had a bullet-proof vest with an NYPD patch on the front as well as an orange MTA vest typically worn by workers in New York City subways, according to police officials with knowledge of the investigation. Police displayed the items at a news conference on Wednesday, including the Guy Fawkes mask made popular by the movie “V for Vendetta.”\nAccording to an affidavit released Thursday, police found an expandable baton with the words “left me no choice,” “you gon learn today” (sic) and “astaghfirullah” written in marker. That latter phrase is Arabic for “I seek forgiveness in God,” the affidavit states.\nSanson also told an officer, in sum and substance, “Sorry, I’ll take it off. There’s a lot of drunk people nowadays,” according to the affidavit.\nQuestions about motive After the court hearing Thursday, Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said investigators would look through all of Sanson’s social media accounts to find out his true motives.\n“When someone is driving around with 11 different weapons, all of this ammunition, language on the baton that sounds threatening, transit uniforms that can be used almost anywhere in our subway system or in our transit system, we have reason to be concerned,” Katz said.\nA day earlier, Maddrey said “it’s still too early” in the active investigation to determine if the incident is related to terrorism.\n“We’re going to be very thorough with this investigation,” Maddrey said. “It will be investigated by the detective bureau along with our intel unit to just see what else we can learn about this arrest.”\nPolice sources said investigators from the NYPD’s Intelligence Division and the Joint Terrorism Task Force were brought in because of the number and types of weapons, the gun, the amount of ammunition and vests with police and transit symbols.\nInvestigators are also examining writings found in the car and on social media, the police sources said.\n“Members of this department make gun arrests, weapons arrests, arrests for knives every day. But an arrest of this magnitude – the amount of ammunition, NYPD paraphernalia in the car, was significant,” Maddrey said Wednesday.\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said officials take the case “very seriously,” but could not say whether the man was plotting an attack.\n“There is no tolerance for this behavior, this is criminal, and I have confidence in our system that this individual will be prosecuted and handled to the fullest extent of the law,” Hochul told CNN’s Laura Coates Wednesday night.\n“This is unacceptable in the State of New York, it’s frightening but it’s important to know that the police are on top of this and more will be reported as we are able to disclose this to the public,” she said.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "Boeing workers ‘ready to go on strike’ if demands unmet | Workers' Rights News | Al Jazeera",
    "text": "A strike would pile on the financial pain and add to delays in delivering planes to airlines already struggling with capacity shortages. Boeing’s United States West Coast factory workers stood in long lines to vote on Thursday on a much-criticised new contract, some loudly calling for a strike, piling pressure on the planemaker as it wrestles with chronic production delays and mounting debt. A potential strike could start on Friday, which would be a big early blow to new CEO Kelly Ortberg, brought on last month to restore faith in the planemaker after a door panel blew off a near-new 737 MAX jet in midair in January. Roughly 30,000 workers who produce Boeing’s 737 MAX, 767 and 777 jets in the Seattle and Portland areas are voting on their first full contract in 16 years. Polling will close at 6pm local time (01:00 GMT Friday) and the result will be announced this evening, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) said. If a strike is sanctioned, it could start at midnight. The proposed deal includes a general wage increase of 25 percent, a $3,000 signing bonus and a pledge to build Boeing’s next commercial jet in the Seattle area, provided the programme is launched within the four years of the contract. Although the IAM leadership recommended its members accept the deal on Sunday, some workers have responded angrily, with many arguing for the originally demanded 40 percent pay rise and lamenting the loss of an annual bonus. ‘Ready to go on strike’ On Thursday, a line of workers waiting to vote snaked along the street outside the union’s offices in Renton, the Seattle suburb where Boeing makes its best-selling 737 jet. Some held signs and others chanted “strike”. All of several Boeing workers who spoke to Reuters news agency said they were voting to strike, and were confident the bulk of union members would do the same, although more than 20 declined to say what they planned. Under complicated union rules, two-thirds must vote in favour of a strike for the action to begin. With anything less than that, the contract will go into effect. “I’m ready to go on strike for as long as necessary to get everything that we deserve,” said Josh King, a 36-year-old quality inspector. “Normally, a strike doesn’t bring a worse offer, it always brings a better offer.” In a sign some workers were already preparing for picket lines, one union member left the meeting on Wednesday carrying a placard under her arm that read: “On Strike Against Boeing.” Workers have been protesting all week in Boeing factories in the Seattle area that assemble Boeing’s MAX, 777 and 767 jets. One member wearing a high-visibility vest shouted, “Time to strike, baby!” as he exited the building after casting his vote. Financial pain Boeing shares are down 36 percent this year on concerns over safety, production and a $60bn debt burden. A strike would pile on the financial pain and add to delays in delivering planes to airlines already struggling with capacity shortages. According to a note from TD Cowen, a 50-day strike could cost Boeing an estimated $3bn to $3.5bn of cash flow. The Boeing workers’ last strike in 2008 shuttered plants for 52 days and hit revenue by an estimated $100m per day. Boeing faces multiple challenges if there is a strike. It will need to decide how to respond at the bargaining table, after saying it had offered everything it could, as well as secure factories full of extremely valuable, partially built planes, without union workers to do the job. S&P Global Ratings said an extended strike could delay the planemaker’s recovery and hurt its overall rating. Both S&P and Moody’s rate Boeing one notch above junk status. On Wednesday, Ortberg sent a letter to workers, urging them to approve the deal. “A strike would put our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together,” the letter said. The labour talks are a key test for Ortberg, who met with the union’s main negotiator after arriving in August with a pledge to improve labour relations and safety and ramp up production of Boeing’s best-selling 737 MAX passenger jet. Ortberg and Boeing Commercial Airplanes boss Stephanie Pope hit the floor at the company’s jet assembly plants in Everett and Renton this week to talk with workers about the proposed deal, a source said. Boeing said that the average worker pay of $75,608 would grow to $106,350 by the end of the contract, excluding overtime. A strike could also become an issue for airlines that depend on Boeing’s aircraft. Still, Michael O’Leary, CEO of Boeing customer Ryanair, said on Thursday that a strike could further delay aircraft deliveries, but added he believed that if it happened, it would be short. “We would like to see the labour agreement sorted,” he said. Boeing machine repair mechanic Harold Wilson said he had mixed emotions about the contract and wanted to see better pensions and higher wages for younger workers: “I think Boeing will be left struggling again.”",

    "text": "ADHD in Women – Why Gender Bias and Outdated Criteria May Play a Role\nWomen are often not diagnosed and are not treated for adhd Screening for women . Gender biases and outdated criteria could be at work.\nDoctors conduct a patient interview and sometimes ask those who know the patient well — like spouses, siblings or family members to look into the symptoms.\nThe symptoms of adult ADHD can be different at different times, like during menstrual periods, pregnancy or menopause. They can affect relationships, work, and life generally.\nSymptoms\nWomen and those who are born female, (AFAB), often are not diagnosed. Or they receive a misdiagnosis. This can be very frustrating and cause feelings of insecurity. It is important to keep in mind that these difficulties do not come from you and have nothing to have anything to do with your actions or character.\nThe signs of ADHD for women may differ between individuals but the most typical are forgetfulness, disorganization, and difficulty staying focused. You might also have trouble with paying attention or completing tasks, causing difficulties at work or school or having difficulty keeping relationships and managing your finances, and being restless and anxious constantly. Many women suffer from emotional distress, like mood swings and a negative self-image. Many suffer from self-injury that is not suicidal such as burning or cutting themselves or experiencing sleep problems.\nIt’s also important to note that the symptoms of ADHD in women can be different at different times of a woman’s life due to hormonal changes. For example, women with ADHD tend to have more severe symptoms during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy or go through menopause. A few societal beliefs about gender and behavior can affect the degree to which symptoms are recognized. For instance women with adhd in young women , your impulsive behavior or mood swings can be interpreted as symptoms of depression, and your forgetfulness and apathy could be seen as a sign of “female traits.”\nThese differences can be frustrating However, there are steps you can follow to get the support and help you need. It’s always recommended to begin with your primary physician who can refer you to a mental health professional for evaluation. Additionally, some women suffering from ADHD benefit from learning strategies to improve their organizational skills and develop better coping methods. You can also talk to an expert in career counseling or join an online support group.\nIt’s also important to note that the treatment for ADHD for women is similar to that of men, and it can include medication such as stimulants. It is also essential to speak with your doctor about any other conditions you might be suffering from like anxiety, depression, or bipolar disorder.\nDiagnosis\nAdults may be unable to receive an diagnosis for ADHD. You might have not noticed your symptoms in childhood or learned to mask them. Women may also struggle to be diagnosed due to stereotypes about gender. Women who suffer from ADHD may be mistakenly diagnosed as “high-functioning” or as having a “mood disorder.”\nYou must meet certain criteria to be diagnosed with ADHD. The first requirement is to have five ongoing symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity that interfere with work or school life. It is also essential to have a the history of these symptoms starting before you were 12 years old. The other requirement is to have major problems caused by the symptoms in two different settings such as at home or at work. In addition the symptoms must be present for a period of more than six months to qualify as a diagnosis.\nIt is also necessary to undergo a physical exam to rule out medical causes of your symptoms, such as seizures or thyroid problems. You may also be asked to take psychological tests, such as the scale for assessing your behavior or checklist. The examiner will review your history and ask questions about how you’ve managed your symptoms in the past. They might also ask you to speak with people who are familiar with you, including family members and close friends. The person who evaluates you will use their findings to write an evaluation report for you.\nIn some cases an evaluator could determine that you don’t have ADHD. They might conclude that your symptoms, while slight or specific, don’t hinder your everyday functioning. They could exclude the condition, when you have other mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression, which could cause similar symptoms.\nConsult your primary physician for a referral if you are in search of a doctor who can evaluate your symptoms for adhd symptoms women . They may suggest an experienced psychologist or psychiatrist who is specialized in ADHD. You can also contact your insurance company or inquire at local hospitals affiliated with universities to find a medical specialist who can treat adults suffering from adhd in women uk . You can also join an ADHD support group and ask the members for suggestions.\nTreatment\nADHD is a problem that affects a lot of women, yet it is more prevalent in males and boys. It is harder for women to get treatment since they are more likely to hide their symptoms. The symptoms can range from not remembering appointments to not being able to work in noisy or busy environments.\nFemales who live with ADHD are also likely to be under pressure to meet various social expectations. They could be expected to take care of their children, take on multiple jobs, and maintain a stable relationship. This can be a challenge for women who suffer from hyperactive, impulsive or combination symptoms. It is crucial for women suffering from these issues to get regular psychiatric examinations and medication treatment.\nStimulant drugs are usually the first choice to treat ADHD in adults. These include methylphenidate (Ritalin), dextroamphetamine/amphetamine salts (Adderall) and lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse). Non-stimulant medications that can be used in lieu of stimulants include atomoxetine (Strattera) and guanfacine (Intuniv) and viloxazine (Kapvay). A medical professional should monitor the medication to ensure that it is taken at the correct dosage.\nIn addition to medication in addition, there are a number of lifestyle choices that can help people with ADHD manage their symptoms. These can include exercise, sleep hygiene and healthy eating. Techniques to manage stress such as workplace and homelife adjustments and techniques for managing stress can be helpful. Psychotherapy can aid some women with their symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a popular option for treating anxiety and depression, which can be co-occurring disorders that are associated with ADHD.\nDepending on your unique situation depending on your specific situation, a combination of treatment options might be best for you. Your doctor will take into consideration your age, lifestyle, and the severity of your symptoms when forming the plan. They will also take into account any other health issues you may be suffering from and whether there are any drug interactions or adverse effects to be concerned about. They will also consider the impact of hormone fluctuations throughout your menstrual cycle, pregnancy, perimenopausal, and menopause. This will allow them to prescribe the right dosage and type of medication to you. Medications can help to improve your mood and your ability to concentrate.\nSupport\nWomen suffering from ADHD are often underdiagnosed. This is due to a variety of reasons, including the fact that ADHD research focuses on boys and men. This can result in healthcare providers and educators missing the symptoms of girls and women. Also, women are less able than men to screening tools and treatments. Thankfully things are changing. There are now more resources for women with ADHD and a greater understanding of their unique symptoms.\nADHD in women can lead to problems with relationships, school and work performance, and self-esteem. It can also lead to substance abuse and unhealthy coping habits like binge eating. The symptoms can also change at different stages of life. For example, hormone fluctuations can alter the severity of symptoms. The mood swings can be misinterpreted by others as depression or anxiety and can delay a diagnosis.\nA new online screening tool for adult ADHD has been developed by the World Health Organization. This screening tool was designed specifically for women, and it uses real-life situations to create questions which a healthcare professional is able to answer. It will help you determine the most common ADHD symptoms in women and provide information that can be shared with a doctor.\nThe test requires a person to answer 18 questions that are broken down by the four core symptoms of ADHD: inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and two other symptom areas. Scores are calculated, which reveals the severity of your symptoms based on the answers you provide. The screening tool is free to use and can be completed online. It is important to keep in mind that the screening tool can’t substitute for a thorough evaluation of your situation. It is best used in conjunction with an ADHD consultation.\nWhen women with ADHD seek treatment, they usually experience a change in their lives that increases dramatically. The right treatment can enhance relationships, help them achieve success at work and in school, and help them to better understand themselves. Support systems are also crucial. This can be done by joining a support system or finding a coach who has previous experience working with women.",

Read on to uncover everything you need to know about how to regrow your edges.\nCauses of Thinning Edges Traction Alopecia \"The most common causes of thinning edges are often linked to hairstyles that create tension, resulting in traction alopecia ,\" explains Dr. Teresa Song, board-certified dermatologist at Marmur Medica.\n\"This type of hair loss is caused by prolonged or repetitive tension on the hair. Hairstyles that pull the hair tightly, such as ponytails, buns, braids , cornrows, locs, and the use of hair extensions or weaves , are frequent culprits,\" Dr. Song says. \"The constant pulling can loosen the hair shaft from its follicle, leading to hair loss, particularly along the hairline and sides of the scalp.\"\nHormonal Changes \"Hormonal fluctuations—whether from pregnancy, menopause, thyroid issues, or birth control—can wreak havoc on your hair's natural growth cycle,\" Yates says. \"These changes often shorten the growth (anagen) phase while extending the resting (telogen) phase, leading to slower growth and overall thinner-looking hair. This effect is especially noticeable around delicate areas like your edges, where hair can appear more sparse and fragile.\"\nExtreme Dieting According to Yates, aggressive or crash diets that drastically cut calories or essential nutrients can lead to hair loss. \"When the body is deprived of vital nutrients, it prioritizes essential functions and temporarily shuts down 'non-essential' processes like hair growth,\" she explains. \"This can push hair follicles into the resting phase, leading to excessive shedding and slow regrowth, particularly around the hairline.\"\nHigh Stress Levels Whether physical, emotional, or hormonal, stress can significantly impact hair health and often lead to thinning around the edges. “Stress-induced hair loss, known as telogen effluvium, disrupts the normal hair cycle and pushes more follicles into the shedding phase,\" Dr. Song says. \"This typically occurs a few months after a triggering event.\"\nYates adds that elevated cortisol levels—the body's primary stress hormone—can also force follicles into premature rest. That can increase shedding and reduce regrowth.\nProduct Buildup and Scalp Issues When it comes to keeping your hair healthy, it's important to remember that infrequent washing or overusing products like dry shampoo and styling gels can actually do more harm than good. When your scalp isn't properly cleansed, buildup can clog hair follicles, which can block healthy growth and lead to thinning around the edges.\nHow to Prevent Thinning Edges If you want to prevent thinning edges, it starts with being gentle in your haircare habits. According to our experts, the health of your edges is closely tied to how you style, care for and nourish your hair and scalp.\nAvoid Tight Hairstyles and Tension “Styles like tight braids, sleek ponytails, and glued extensions can create damaging traction over time,” says Dr. Ali Syed, chief chemist and founder of As I Am. “If braiding is necessary, try to minimize the pulling force during the process.” Dr. Song echoes this, recommending low-tension styles like loose braids, wash-and-go curls, or low buns to preserve the integrity of your hairline.\nBe Gentle With Styling Tools and Products From edge gels to hot tools, harsh practices can weaken your hair and scalp. “Limit heat-related styling and stay away from scalp scrubs,” says Yates. “Aggressive scrubs can lead to small scratches that can damage the hair follicles.” Brushing with the wrong tools can also cause inflammation and damage. “Use round-tip brushes and avoid shampoos with harsh detergents or strong cleansing claims,” Yates adds.\nA model poses backstage during London Fashion Week. Getty Images\nKeep Your Scalp and Follicles Healthy While cleansing is essential, overdoing it—especially with dry shampoos or harsh products—can lead to clogged follicles and inflammation.\n“Most people are using dry shampoo incorrectly. It is meant to be used on the hair and then brushed out, eliminating grime and product build-up along the way,” says Yates. “Ask yourself, would you leave makeup on your face for five days? That’s essentially what happens when dry shampoo sits on your scalp too long.”\nUse gentle, hypoallergenic shampoos to avoid scalp buildup.\nNourish From the Inside Out All three experts agree that a nutrient-rich diet plays a major role in hair health. Dr. Song recommends checking for common deficiencies, like iron and vitamin D, and taking supplements if needed. Yates stresses the importance of a balanced diet and exercise to reduce stress and keep follicles functioning. “Exercise boosts your metabolism and reduces stress. Incorporating activities like yoga not only relieves stress, but supports healthier hair overall,” she explains.\nHow to Regrow Edges Regrowing thinning edges takes time, consistency, and a holistic approach that targets both the internal and external factors influencing hair growth.\nA model poses backstage during the Milan Fashion Week. Getty Images\nTopicals Natural ingredients are showing real promise in supporting edge regrowth and preventing further damage: “New gels with natural ingredients like rosemary oil and bioflavonoids are helping to counteract traction forces and keep follicles healthy,” Dr. Syed explains. “These leave-on gels, such as As I Am Rosemary Edge Gel , work to support growth while soothing the scalp and reducing inflammation caused by styling tension.”\nWhen it comes to oils and natural remedies, our experts agree that ingredients like peppermint, castor, and rosemary oils are highly effective across all hair types. “ Castor oil is particularly popular in the African American community due to its moisturizing benefits,” says Dr. Song, who also recommends peppermint oil for its ability to stimulate circulation and activate follicles. For those with finer or straighter hair types, using these oils sparingly can help avoid weighing the hair down.\nAnother effective treatment for regrowing thinning edges is minoxidil, \"an over-the-counter medication that stimulates hair growth by increasing blood flow to the hair follicles and prolonging the growth phase of the hair cycle,” Dr. Song says. “It is effective for all hair types, and should be applied twice daily to affected areas for the best results.”\nLifestyle Changes But topical treatments aren’t the only answer. “Hair regrowth starts from within,” says Yates. “A balanced diet, good hygiene habits, and targeted supplements are essential for healthy hair.” Nutrient deficiencies in iron, zinc, biotin, and vitamin D can significantly impact follicle function. Dr. Syed emphasizes the importance of a nutrient-rich diet with plenty of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates to create an ideal environment for hair regrowth.\nPatience Patience is key. “It usually takes three to six months to see noticeable regrowth,” says Dr. Song, “though you may notice baby hairs as early as one to two months in.” If your edges aren't improving despite consistent care, both Dr. Syed and Dr. Song recommend seeing a dermatologist or trichologist. “Sometimes an underlying issue, like hormonal imbalance or inflammation, needs professional attention,” Dr. Song advises.\nRead more:",

Lawyers use virtual juries to try out their strategies before a case makes it to court, and you can get paid for participating. How fun is that!\nThe job requirements are pretty basic. Most of these sites require you to be a U.S. citizen, at least 18 and have no felony convictions. Depending on the case, there may be additional eligibility criteria.\nThe process usually involves filling out a form with your demographic information online. The info is used to match you with relevant cases.\nHow much do you get paid?\nIt depends. Based on the complexity and length of the case, you’ll likely see anything from $5 to $60. But I did see a stat that the average person will make $45 per hour if selected.\nNow, there might not be a ton of opportunities to participate. The number of cases you get invited to can vary based on your demographic profile and the demand for jurors in your area with your background. In other words, this isn’t a reliable income stream, but it can be an interesting hobby.\nOK, let’s do this\nWant to try it? You’ve got options:\neJuryallows attorneys to receive feedback before cases go to court. As a virtual juror, you review cases and answer questions that help lawyers prepare for trial. OnlineVerdictlets you review legal cases submitted by attorneys and provide feedback. Each case takes about 30 to 60 minutes to review. JuryTestis where attorneys upload case materials and jurors provide their opinions on the case. You can listen to or read case details, then answer questions or give a verdict. SignUpDirectlets you participate in mock juries and research projects for legal cases. You can register on the website to be notified when new cases are available.\nProtect your primary email address\nDisposable email addresses are your friends when checking out new opportunities. You don’t want to hand over your primary email address when looking for a side gig, which could lead to spammy messages.\n- In Gmail, you can create disposable email addresses by adding a plus sign (+) and any word or number combination before the @ symbol in your email address.

Le souverain pontife est hospitalisé pour une bronchite depuis vendredi à Rome (Italie). \"Les résultats des examens effectués ces derniers jours et aujourd'hui ont démontré une infection polymicrobienne des voies respiratoires qui a conduit à une nouvelle modification de la thérapie\", précise le bulletin de santé.\nLe Vatican n'a pas communiqué sur la date à laquelle le pape devrait quitter l'hôpital Gemelli de Rome, mais a annoncé lundi que son hospitalisation entraînait l'annulation de son audience générale hebdomadaire mercredi. Dans la matinée, le Vatican avait fait état de nouvelles rassurantes, le directeur du service de presse du Saint-Siège, Matteo Bruni affirmant que le pape avait \"passé une nuit tranquille\" et était \"de bonne humeur\".\nDimanche, l'évêque de Rome a suivi la messe à la télévision, manquant sa prière hebdomadaire de l'Angélus. Le Vatican avait fait savoir en fin d'après-midi que son état clinique était \"stable\".",
