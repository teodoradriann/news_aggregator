    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "[An Express Investigation:](https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/happy-new-year-look-where-most-of-indias-medals-come-from-village-town-under-rs-5-lakh-annual-income-farmers-families-9090014/) For the last couple of months, 15 reporters gathered data about all of India’s Asian Games medallists in Hangzhou. The analysis provided a few clear-cut trends and some fascinating journeys of athletes that highlight those. * 9 girls from low income, low education families availed basic SAI facilities and could change lives and augment family income. At the age of 14, Khushbu saw a few boys playing sepaktakraw – a popular sport in Malaysia – at Bareilly’s Major Dhyanchand Stadium SAI centre. At first, she thought the sport was a different version of volleyball. She would ask her father, Gopal, a home guard by profession who was posted at the stadium, about the sport. “There is a sports hostel at the stadium, and only boys from the north east region used to play the sport. My father asked one of the athletes about the game and then explained it to me,” Khushbu tells [the Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com). Khushbu was left awestruck by the game and insisted to her father that she wanted to play the sport. “The coach told my father that they would need three more girls, so he started a coaching programme for the girls. I brought three of my friends from school. All of us were in athletics, and the game is so unique that they also wanted to give it a shot,” she says. Cut to the present, Khushbu was part of the team that won India’s first-ever medal in women’s sepaktakraw at the Asian Games. Besides financial issues, the family also faced unrelenting interference from pesky neighbours and snoopy relatives. “Although my family was very supportive, there were a few neighbours who had issues with me wearing shorts. ‘Aapki ladki ladkon ke saath khelti hai, chhote kapde pehenti hai (your daughter plays with boys, she wears short skirts).’ My family was exposed to such scornful comments from society that anyone would get mentally scarred. But my grandmother was differently built. She was a strong character,” says Khushbu. “After hearing all these taunts, my grandmother took me to the nearest salon and asked the barber to give me a boy cut. When we returned home she shouted before entering our house, ‘Dikh rahi ye ladko ki tarah ab, khabardar ab kisi ne kuch kaha toh (She is looking like a boy now and I dare anyone to say anything to her from now onwards). I have kept short hari hairstyle since that time,” laughs the 27-year-old medalist. Khushbu’s grandmother had one dream that she wanted to see her in an Indian Army uniform, but unfortunately, she couldn’t as she passed away when Khushbu was completing her Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) training. “She wanted to see me in my Indian Army dress. I was actually training at the time she passed away. Whatever I have achieved in my life, it’s all because of her dedication and support,” she says. Khushbu wants more girls from Bareilly to take up the sport, and she believes that there will be more like her from the city who will represent India. “The kind of reception I received after coming was historic. At Bareilly, the roads are jammed because of politicians. It was a welcome change. Right from the stadium to the house, thousands came to welcome me. It was overwhelming,” she says.",

    "text": "North Lake Tahoe Fire first in state with advanced CPR machine RENO, Nev. (KOLO) -Watch the AutoPulse NXT at work. It’s a real story of man versus machine. Particularly when it comes to saving a life. The advanced CPR machine once attached to the chest, delivers compressions to a patient in cardiac arrest. “The device is completely in charge for this human,” says Jill Andersen, a Firefighter and Paramedic with North Tahoe Fire Protection District as she demonstrates the device on a plastic model of a human head and chest. “We can sit someone up, take them in an elevator.” The machine allows the chest compressions to occur in tough spots like an elevator, up a hill, or coming downstairs--places where a fireman may have to wait or even pause those compressions until the patient is in a more stable location. North Lake Tahoe Fire Protection District is the first to obtain these machines in the state with the help of a FEMA grant. The AutoPulse NXT delivers just the right amount of pressure because there is technology inside the chest strap. It determines resistance and delivers those compressions in a precise and uninterrupted manner. All of this frees up a fireman or paramedic on the emergency call and all that entails. “And when you put someone in that task you know it obviously lends itself to those human factors,” says Chief Russell Barnum with North Lake Tahoe Fire Protection District. “We get tired, the machine doesn’t get tired. We might lose rhythm. The machine doesn’t lose rhythm. We might not compress the chest deep as we need to because we are getting tired. The machine doesn’t do that. So, what this does in the chain of survival in cardiac arrest…it props that up so that we have a better chance of survivability.” It took a week to train all North Lake Tahoe’s firemen and women on the machines. Since most of their calls are medical, and a good percentage of the patients are tourists, the AutoPlus NXT will be put to use in no time at all. Five AutoPulse NXT’s will be put in all 5 North Lake Tahoe Fire ambulances. The beauty of this system, if devices need to be altered in any way-- a change in resuscitation guidelines or updates, the machines can be easily re-programmed to reflect those changes.

The data is a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and may be subject to change. All figures are for crimes recorded by police forces, not incidents.

Not all forces are included in the list and reasons for omissions are given at the end. – Avon & Somerset Antisemitic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5 The force said that completion of the “hate type” field on its records is not mandatory. Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed. – Bedfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 – British Transport Police Antisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22 – Cambridgeshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5 The force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime. – Dorset Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1 – Durham Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 The force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam. – Gloucestershire Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”. – Greater Manchester Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74 Islamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34 The force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish.

They also engage in joint working with partners such as local authorities, Victim Support and third-party Hate Incident Reporting Centres.” – Wiltshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5 Some 15 forces are not included in this list.

Compartir 'La Pasión según San Juan', una pieza que cumple 300 años, será el concierto central del 10º International Bach Festival, que regresa a Gran Canaria con siete conciertos en diferentes formatos.
