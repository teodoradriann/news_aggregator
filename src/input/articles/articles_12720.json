    "title": "Christian lifeguard doesn't have to raise the Pride flag. But he objects to making subordinates do it | News & Features | ArcaMax Publishing",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES — An evangelical Christian lifeguard said that Los Angeles County officials have given him a \"partial\" concession in his quest to avoid hoisting the Pride flag at the beach this month.\nIn a Wednesday legal filing, attorneys for longtime county lifeguard Jeffrey Little said their client was told on May 31, the day before Pride Month began, that he would receive a \"partial religious accommodation\" and \"would not be personally responsible for raising or lowering\" the flag.\nBut as a captain, Little will still have to make sure that his subordinates hoist the flag, a job requirement that his attorneys said would \"violate his sincere religious beliefs.\"\nThe change from the county fire department comes a week after Little sued in federal court, accusing his bosses of religious discrimination by making him work near the Progress Pride flag last summer and punishing him for taking three of the flags down. The county board of supervisors voted last year to require that many government buildings — including lifeguard facilities — fly the rainbow flag, which has extra stripes representing people of color and transgender and nonbinary people, throughout Pride month.\nThe order, Little argued in the lawsuit, was in \"direct conflict\" with his \"traditional Christian beliefs regarding the moral illicitness of same-sex activity, the immutability of sex regardless of gender identity, and the view that all people are children of God regardless of their skin color.\"\nLast year, some county lifeguard stations didn't fly the Pride flags because they didn't have the right flagpoles to hold both that flag and the U.S. flag, according to the lawsuit. Little had asked last summer to work at one of these facilities, a request he said was ultimately denied. He asked again for similar accommodations this year but said the county stonewalled the request, leading him to sue the L.A. County Fire Department as well as three higher-ups in the department's lifeguard division.\nThe fire department, which does not typically comment on pending litigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Little has been a county lifeguard for more than 22 years and made $210,000 last year.\nLast weekend, Little walked the beach with a fire chief and confirmed that the beaches where he would be spending most of his week — Nicholas Beach, Point Dume Beach and Malibu Beach — did not have the right flagpoles to fly the Pride flag, according to the Wednesday declaration. However, the headquarters at Zuma Beach, where he would work one day a week, did have the appropriate flagpole.\n Though Little would not be responsible for flying the flag, the department's risk management staff told him that he would still have to ensure that his subordinates keep the flag raised, the declaration said. The fire department's policy states that all captains must make sure the flag is flown throughout June.\nLittle's attorneys argued that he isn't the only one who has taken issue with the requirements.\n\"My office is informed that the Fire Department has received possibly hundreds of additional religious accommodation requests similar in nature to Captain Little's, and that a protest might be planned,\" wrote Paul Jonna, who is representing Little and is special counsel for the Thomas More Society, a conservative Catholic legal organization best known for challenging abortion rights.\nA county spokesperson said Wednesday that this was inaccurate and that the county had received \"less than a dozen\" requests for exemptions related to the Pride flag countywide.\nStill, the fire department appeared braced for pushback this Pride month. On May 30, Fire Chief Anthony Marrone sent a note to his staff outlining the protocols around raising the flag.\n\"Last year we faced challenges with compliance at several Department facilities,\" he said. \"I want to be intentional and clear that compliance is not optional.\"\n©2024 Los Angeles Times.

So we started CPR right away.\"\nThe Cape Coral Fire Department reported that the man's heart had stopped while he was riding his bike. And thanks to the quick response from Koson and that off-duty paramedic, the man was taken to the hospital and is now recovering.\n\"He's doing well,\" Koson said. \"He's getting better every day. I kind of felt like the guy who survived deserves this. I was just there to help, and I would do it for anyone.\"\nThe Cape Coral Fire Department emphasized the importance of bystander CPR.\n\"You do that bystander CPR, you're tripling someone's chance of survival, and that's one of the biggest success stories that we see all the time, and so we always re-emphasize those to the public, so they understand how important it is,\" said Jason Orellana, a Community Risk Reduction Specialist with the Cape Coral Fire Department.\nKoson's quick thinking and teamwork with the paramedic highlight the vital role of CPR in emergencies. Her actions have made a difference, and the community is reminded of the life-saving power of CPR.\nThe Cape Coral Fire Department offers free community CPR training classes. The next one will be held on Aug. 16 from 9 am to noon in Spanish, and 1 to 4 pm in English.",

    "text": "Photographer Settles Deceptive Advertising Case with Consent Judgment\nNigel Farage Raises Alarm Over Safety of British MPs Amid Sectarian Violence\nNigel Farage, a high-profile British political figure, brought the issue of religious violence and sectarianism within British politics to the fore in a recent GB News discussion. Farage voiced his support for Mike Freer, a Member of Parliament (MP) who has chosen not to seek re-election due to harassment from the group Muslims Against Crusades and a disconcerting visit by Ali Harbi Ali. Ali later went on to murder MP David Amess. Farage expressed his apprehensions about the escalating level of intimidation and threats MPs are facing, which could potentially compromise their safety and the well-being of their families.\nFarage Shares Personal Experiences\nFarage unveiled his own experiences of being a target of several assaults and the subsequent necessity of having security while campaigning. He asserted that while it is crucial for MPs to remain accessible to the public, the ongoing circumstances might render it unfeasible to do so without robust security measures.\nPotential Impact on Political Representation\nFarage cautioned that if the threat of physical violence deters individuals from pursuing political careers, particularly those who are defenders of Israel or identify as openly gay like Freer, it could significantly affect the quality of political representation. It may also discourage MPs from voicing their opinions on critical issues.\nNeed for Enhanced Protection\nConcluding his remarks, Farage urged that MPs require more protection to safeguard their safety and uphold the integrity of the political process. He echoed the concerns raised by his colleagues about the safety of MPs in the face of political sectarianism, emphasizing the importance of politicians being able to perform their duties without fear of intimidation or violence.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.",

    "title": "IDWeek: Clesrovimab reduces RSV disease, hospitalization in healthy infants",
    "text": "There were no treatment or RSV-related deaths during the study. Merck's investigational RSV prophylactic monoclonal antibody, clesrovimab, designed to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease during their first RSV season, demonstrated positive phase 2b/3 study data (MK-1654-004; NCT04767373), which was presented at IDWeek 2024, in Los Angeles, California. According to an announcement from Merck, clesrovimab met all prespecified endpoints in a placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 pivotal trial evaluating a single dose in healthy preterm and full-term infants aged birth to 1 year. Results were consistent through both the 5-month and 6-month time points. The study enrolled 3,632 participants who were randomized 2:1 to receive either a single fixed dose of clesrovimab (105 mg intramuscular injection (IM) or placebo on day 1. According to the announcement, reduction in incidence of RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory infections (MALRI) that required 1 or more indicator of lower respiratory infection or severity compared to placebo through 5 months post-dose, was 60.4% (95% CI: 44.1, 71.9, [P <0.001]). A key secondary endpoint was RSV-associated hospitalizations, for which clesrovimab reduced these hospitalizations by 84.2% (95% CI: 66.6, 92.6, [P <0.001]) through 5 months compared to placebo. A third endpoint was RSV-associated lower respiratory infection hospitalizations, which were reduced 90.9% with clesrovimab treatment compared to placebo through 5 months (95% CI: 76.2, 96.5). In addition, clesrovimab reduced the incidence of severe MALRI (tertiary endpoint) by 91.7% (95% CI: 62.9, 98.1), according to the Merck announcement. “RSV continues to be a widespread seasonal infection that can affect both healthy and at-risk infants and is the leading cause of hospitalization for infants,” said Octavio Ramilo, MD, chair of the Department of Infectious Diseases at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital and investigator for the MK-1654-004 and MK-1654-007 trials. \"The MK-1654-004 study evaluated a broad spectrum of RSV disease ranging from mild outpatient illness to severe disease requiring hospitalization,\" said Ramilo. These promising results demonstrating decreased incidence of RSV disease, including hospitalizations, highlight the potential for clesrovimab to play an important role in helping to alleviate the continued burden of RSV on infants and their families.” “The breadth of data presented at IDWeek highlight the potential for clesrovimab to help lessen the significant impact RSV can have on infants and their families, as well as the strain on healthcare systems due to high infection and hospitalization rates,” said Paula Annunziato, senior vice president, infectious diseases and vaccines, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. “These clinically meaningful findings also reinforce the potential for clesrovimab to be the first and only immunization designed to protect both healthy and at-risk infants using the same dose, regardless of weight. We look forward to continuing to discuss these data with health authorities around the world with the goal of making clesrovimab available for infants as early as the 2025-26 RSV season.” Reference: Merck’s Clesrovimab (MK-1654), an Investigational Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Preventative Monoclonal Antibody, Significantly Reduced Incidence of RSV Disease and Hospitalization in Healthy Preterm and Full-term Infants.

    "text": "La Corée du Nord a qualifié jeudi d'acte \"imprudent et provocant\" la vente par les Américains d'hélicoptères Apache à la Corée du Sud, affirmant qu'elle y répondrait par un renforcement de son propre arsenal. Belga Agence\nPublié le 23-08-2024 à 02h24 à Séoul, Corée du Sud \"Il s'agit d'un acte imprudent et provocant\" qui vise à \"délibérément augmenter l'instabilité sécuritaire dans la région\", a fustigé dans un communiqué le ministère de la Défense nord-coréen.\n\"Nous nous opposons fermement (...) au renforcement militaire (...) des forces vassales\" des Etats-Unis, a-t-il déclaré, critiquant par la même des ventes récentes américaines au Japon et à d'autres alliés de Washington en Asie-Pacifique.\nLes Etats-Unis ont annoncé lundi avoir approuvé la vente de jusqu'à 36 hélicoptères d'attaque Apache, ainsi que du matériel lié, dont des missiles, à la Corée du Sud pour un total d'environ 3,5 milliards de dollars (3,1 milliards d'euros).\nSelon l'agence américaine pour la coopération en matière de défense (DSCA), elle doit permettre \"d'améliorer les capacités de la République de Corée (nom officiel de la Corée du Sud) à faire face aux menaces actuelles et futures\" avec \"une force capable de dissuader les adversaires\".\nLa transaction doit encore être validée par le Congrès américain avant d'être effective.\nCet accord va amener Pyongyang à \"renforcer encore\" ses propres moyens de \"dissuasion stratégique\", a souligné vendredi le régime nord-coréen.\nL'annonce de la vente est intervenue au premier jour des traditionnels exercices militaires annuels menés conjointement par Washington et Séoul. Baptisées \"Ulchi Freedom Shield\", elles mobiliseront des milliers de militaires jusqu'au 29 août.\nWashington est le principal allié de Séoul en matière de sécurité.\nMission de La Libre\nFaire une remarque\nPartager Partager Fermer © 2024 Belga Newsbriefing.
