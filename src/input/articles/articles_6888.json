    "title": "Avista advises customers they can resume normal energy usage amid Spokane cold snap - Sun, 14 Jan 2024 PST",
    "text": "Avista advises customers they can resume normal energy usage amid Spokane cold snap\nTwo days after warning of potential supply problems, Avista advised customers Sunday morning that they could resume regular energy use.\nAvista asked customers Friday evening to conserve energy during a regional cold snap: lowering the thermostat, turning off heat in empty rooms, taking shorter or colder showers. The request was the result of a mechanical issue with natural gas compressors belonging to TC Energy, a natural gas supplier to the utilities company.\nAvista announced Saturday night TC Energy repaired the problem, but the utility asked that customers consider conserving natural gas as well as electricity.\nAvista spokesperson Jared Webley declined Sunday to comment on the cause of the mechanical issue, deferring to TC Energy. TC Energy could not be reached Sunday.\nSaturday night, with temperatures near or below zero, more than 450 Avista customers, nearly 600 Northern Lights customers and 80 Inland Power and Light customers were without power.\nAvista spokesperson David Vowels said the 450 without power were unrelated to the mechanical issue or conservation requests.\nSunday morning, 30 Avista customers were experiencing outages, according to the company’s outage map. Over 130 customers at Inland Power and Light were without power Sunday morning in Spokane and surrounding counties, restored by Sunday afternoon. Largely surrounding Priest Lake, 275 Northern Lights customers still were without power Sunday afternoon.\nAvista engineers noticed a reduction in natural gas usage during the period of requested conservation, Webley said. Businesses, industrial and residential customers dramatically reduced energy usage, he said.\nAvista’s natural gas pipelines have incurred problems twice in the past few months. On Nov. 9, a landowner ruptured a pipeline between Colfax and Pullman, leaving nearly 37,000 customers without natural gas services.\nWebley said he doesn’t expect the issues to persist.\n“It just so happens we had two once-in-a-lifetime events in the last three months,” Webley said. “This was an emergency, one-of-a-kind situation.”\nInland Power and Light Co. asked similar conservation efforts of their customers; a post on Facebook from the company said “extreme energy use” risked overloading electrical systems.\n“If everyone reduces their energy use a little bit, it will have a massive positive impact,” the post read.\nThe utilities company recommended unplugging unused electronics, reducing use of appliances like dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers, and turning off unused lights.\nWebley said Avista’s power grid is not at risk of being overloaded.\nSpokane and surrounding areas are in the midst of a cold snap; some weekend temperatures set records for the area, according to the National Weather Service.\nOn Friday, the high was 13 degrees and the low minus-7, tying the 1949 record for lowest low for that day. The record for lowest high temperature for Jan. 12 was set in 1909 at 3 degrees.\nSaturday set a record for the lowest high for that day at 2 degrees, edging out Jan. 13, 1950’s 4-degree high. Saturday’s minus-10 low ranks among the top-three lowest for the day, a spot currently held by 1909’s low of 13 degrees below zero.\nSunday’s low was minus-4, the high was 10 degrees. The record lows for Jan. 14 are a minus-7 high set in 1888 and minus-28 for the lowest low in the same year.",

    "text": "With war raging in Gaza, Christmas is effectively cancelled in Bethlehem maxItemsPerPage: 10 totalITemsFound: maxPaginationLinks: 10 maxPossiblePages: startIndex: endIndex: Bethlehem, West Bank (CNN) — Church bells echo through the labyrinth-like streets of Bethlehem. With Christmas approaching, the city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank should be teeming with visitors. But this year, it is almost deserted. Local leaders made the decision last month to scale back festivities in solidarity with the Palestinian population, as heavy fighting raged between Israel and Hamas in the devastated Gaza Strip. More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel’s air and ground offensive, according to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza and nearly 85% of the strip’s total population has been displaced. The war was sparked by Hamas’ terror attack on October 7 on southern Israel in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage. Many here have ties to Gaza through loved ones and friends, and a sense of misery has fallen upon the city revered by Christians as the birthplace of Jesus Christ. Decorations that once adorned neighborhoods have been removed. The parades and religious celebrations have been canceled. In the city center, the traditional enormous Christmas tree of Manger Square is conspicuously absent. Traveling into Bethlehem, about eight kilometers south of Jerusalem, isn’t ordinarily an easy journey. The Israeli-built West Bank barrier restricts movement, as do the various checkpoints leading in and out of the city. It’s only got worse since Hamas’ brazen attack. Since October 7, Israel has restricted movement in Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the West Bank, with military checkpoints allowing access in and out, impacting Palestinians trying to get to work. The occupied territory has also experienced a surge in violence, with at least 300 Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks, according to the Palestinian health ministry. “My son asked me why there’s no Christmas tree this year, I don’t know how to explain it,” Ali Thabet tells CNN. He and his family live in Al Shawawra, a Palestinian village near Bethlehem, and visit each Christmas “because our relationship with our Christian brothers is a strong relationship He and his family live in Bethlehem and visit each Christmas “because our relationship with our Christian brothers is a strong relationship.” He explains: “We join them in their celebrations, and they also join us in our celebrations. But this year’s holiday season is very bad.” Walking down the cobble-stone streets, the impact of the conflict is evident. Businesses were banking on a busy festive period after suffering through the hardships and travel restrictions of the coronavirus pandemic. But without the usual crowds of tourists and the faithful, many of the hotels, shops and restaurants have shuttered. Bethlehem’s economy depends on pilgrims and tourism, explains third-generation shop owner Rony Tabash, who stands outside his store waiting for customers who will never arrive. Souvenirs and intricately carved olive wood carvings of the nativity scene sit on shelves gathering dust. Tabash’s store is one of the handful to remain open, out of a wish to support the skilled artisans that delicately make his merchandise. Tabash brings his father with him to the shop each day to get him out of the house. His grandfather opened the store back in 1927 and this place, along with the square and its famous church, have become “part of our heart.” “We’ve never seen Christmas like this,” he continues. “Since three months, honestly, we don’t have one sale. I don’t want to keep my father at home. I don’t want to give up hope.” Even the Church of the Nativity – which became the first World Heritage site in the Palestinian territories in 2012 – is largely empty. In a normal year, queues of hundreds would snake around the car park outside with pilgrims patiently waiting to enter its grotto, considered since the 2nd Century to be the exact location of Christ’s birth. A 14-pointed silver star set into the marble floor marks the precise spot where Jesus is said to have been born. In the 4th Century, Emperor Constantine founded a church on the site, which was destroyed in the year 529, only to be replaced by larger structures, which form the basis of the church today. Inside, it would usually be standing room only. But this year, the fighting in Gaza has changed everything. Now, you can practically hear a pin drop. “I have never seen it like this,” says Father Spiridon Sammour, a Greek Orthodox priest at the Church of the Nativity. “Christmas is joy, love and peace. We have no peace. We have no joy,” he says solemnly. “It is out of our hands, and we pray for the leaders who will make the decisions [all] over the world to God to help them, give them his light to make peace here and all over the world.

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of China Resources Power Holdings Company Limited (HKG:836).\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n Check out our latest analysis for China Resources Power Holdings\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for China Resources Power Holdings is:\n13% = HK$15b ÷ HK$111b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each HK$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made HK$0.13 in profit.\nDoes China Resources Power Holdings Have A Good Return On Equity?\nArguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, China Resources Power Holdings has a superior ROE than the average (7.8%) in the Renewable Energy industry.\nThat's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for China Resources Power Holdings.\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\nCombining China Resources Power Holdings' Debt And Its 13% Return On Equity\nChina Resources Power Holdings clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.66. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\nConclusion\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\nIf you're looking to trade China Resources Power Holdings, open an account with the lowest-cost platform trusted by professionals, Interactive Brokers.\nWith clients in over 200 countries and territories, and access to 160 markets, IBKR lets you trade stocks, options, futures, forex, bonds and funds from a single integrated account.\nEnjoy no hidden fees, no account minimums, and FX conversion rates as low as 0.03%, far better than what most brokers offer.\nSponsored ContentNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts\nOur new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities.\n• Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n• Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n• High growth Tech and AI Companies\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.\nExplore Now for Free\nHave feedback on this article?

This thorough article delves into the efficacy of Semaglutide and Tirzepatide , detailing their mechanisms of action, benefits, and real-world request in obesity management. We’ll integrate insights derived from sources like the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) to provide a well-rounded perspective on these obesity medications .\nUnderstanding Semaglutide and Tirzepatide Both semaglutide and tirzepatide represent significant advancements in the pharmacotherapy of obesity. They offer distinct approaches to tackling the complexities of weight management. Understanding their specifics is crucial for clinicians and patients alike.\nSemaglutide: The GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Semaglutide , a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, mimics the action of the GLP-1 hormone.This hormone plays a pivotal role in regulating blood sugar levels, slowing gastric emptying, and promoting feelings of fullness. Semaglutide, through its action on the GLP-1 receptor , can lead to ample weight loss. It’s availability frequently enough comes by injection,but oral formulations exist as well. The primary function of semaglutide is to reduce caloric intake and increase energy expenditure.\nTirzepatide: The Dual GIP/GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Tirzepatide stands out due to its unique dual mechanism of action. It acts as an agonist at both the GLP-1 receptor and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor. The GIP receptor activation contributes to enhanced insulin secretion and improved insulin sensitivity. The dual action of Tirzepatide is thought to give it improved weight loss outcomes compared to some single-receptor agonists. This weight loss medication works through multiple pathways, including appetite suppression and improved metabolic control.\nComparing Effectiveness and Efficacy The efficacy of semaglutide and tirzepatide in weight loss and the treatment of related conditions forms the centerpiece of recent research. Clinical trials and real-world data consistently highlight their effectiveness.\nWeight Loss Outcomes: A Head-to-Head Perspective Studies comparing semaglutide and tirzepatide for obesity management reveal notable differences. While both medications facilitate significant weight reduction, Tirzepatide frequently demonstrates superior results. The dual agonistic approach provides an edge in curbing hunger and improving metabolic function.\nfeature Semaglutide Tirzepatide Mechanism GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Dual GLP-1 and GIP Receptor Agonist Typical Weight Loss 5-15% of body weight Up to 25% of body weight Primary Benefit Appetite suppression, Glucose Control Increased insulin sensitivity, enhanced weight loss Side Effects, Risks and Potential Problems As with all medications, the side effects of semaglutide and tirzepatide are an crucial consideration.
