    "text": "Bia Haddad 2 x 0 Erika Andreeva | Melhores momentos | Australian Open\nBia Haddad Maia atingiu uma marca importante com a vitória sobre a russa Erika Andreeva nesta quinta-feira . Ao chegar à terceira rodada do Australian Open, a tenista igualou os melhores resultados do país na história do torneio, considerando apenas as edições da Era Aberta - quando foi liberada a participação de atletas profissionais nos eventos, a partir de 1968.\nApenas quatro tenistas brasileiros haviam atingido a terceira rodada das disputas de simples do Australian Open anteriormente, incluindo a própria Bia Haddad, que também chegou nesta fase no ano passado . Além dela, incluem-se na lista: Marcos Hocevar (1983), Jaime Oncins (1991) e Gustavo Kuerten (2004).\n1 de 1 Bia Haddad no Aberto da Austrália — Foto: REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon Bia Haddad no Aberto da Austrália — Foto: REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\nTradicionalmente, o Australian Open é o Grand Slam de pior desempenho dos tenistas brasileiros . De 1969, primeira edição do torneio na Era Aberta, até 2024, o Brasil conquistou somente 31 vitórias nas chaves individuais.\nNem mesmo Guga se dava bem em terras oceânicas. O ex-número 1 do mundo, que foi tricampeão de Roland Garros, disputou o Grand Slam australiano oito vezes e só chegou à terceira rodada em sua última participação, em 2004.\nConsiderando apenas os resultados femininos, Bia Haddad é a única brasileira com vitórias na chave de simples do Australian Open. A paulista de 28 anos chegou à segunda rodada em 2018, 2019 e 2022, além de ir até a terceira em 2024. Em 2023, caiu na estreia.\nBia Haddad Maia 2 x 1 Julia Riera | melhores momentos | Australian Open\nVale destacar que Maria Esther Bueno , o maior nome da história do tênis brasileiro com sete títulos individuais de Grand Slam, chegou a disputar o Australian Open em edições anteriores à Era Aberta. Ela parou nas quartas de final em 1960 e foi vice-campeã em 1965. Portanto, levando em conta todas o histórico, Maria Esther é a brasileira com os melhores resultados no Major australiano.\nBuscando se isolar como a única brasileira a chegar nas oitavas de final do Australian Open na Era Aberta, Bia Haddad enfrentará a russa Veronika Kudermetova em seu próximo desafio, que deve acontecer entre a noite de sexta-feira (17) e a manhã de sábado (18). A brasileira é a 17ª colocada do ranking da WTA, enquanto a adversária é a número 75 do mundo.",

    "title": "B.C. First Nation, Catholic Church announce 'sacred covenant' to be signed on Easter - Prince George Citizen",
    "text": "KAMLOOPS, B.C. — Vancouver's Catholic archdiocese is marking Easter with a commitment towards reconciliation with First Nations in B.C., Archbishop J. Michael Miller says. The church and the chief of the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc announced Thursday that a \"Sacred Covenant\" agreement has been reached between the church and the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C. The covenant comes three years after the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C., announced the discovery of what it believed were the remains of more than 200 children at the site of a former residential school. Miller said the agreement with the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc will open a \"new chapter\" in the relationship between the church and First Nations in B.C. \"Unquestionably, the church was wrong in implementing a government colonialist policy which resulted in devastation for many children, families and communities. We recognize as Catholics, as the Catholic Church, our part in the resulting tragedies,\" Miller said. The covenant is set to be signed on Easter Sunday, \"a special time of hope and renewal,\" Miller said. \"Easter Sunday is the ideal time to help start a new chapter in First Nation and Catholic relations in our province,\" he said. \"Our hope and our prayer is that by taking this next step, we will build on our relationship, a relationship already established but still young, and be an example to Canadian society of respecting the identity and the experience of Indigenous Peoples.\" Chief Rosanne Casimir of Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc said the covenant will see the church share records and information as the nation continues to investigate the site of a former Kamloops Indian Residential School where hundreds of children went missing. Casimir said the agreement is crucial to learning the truth about what happened to the missing children, and access to the church's historical records will help \"bring justice to the children who never made it home.\" \"We seek to memorialize the missing children. We also seek meaningful ways to support survivors and intergenerational survivors on their healing journey so that they and their future generations may thrive,\" she said. The nation announced in May 2021 that a search around the former school site using ground-penetrating radar found 200 potential unmarked burial sites. Since then, First Nations across the country have conducted searches and made similar discoveries. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission identified at least 6,000 deaths at residential schools during their time in operation in Canada between the late 1800s and 1996. In many of the deaths, schools didn’t record the children's names, genders or cause of death. The children in the schools were separated from their families and forbidden to speak their own language. They were undernourished and often experienced physical and sexual abuse. The agreement includes commitments from the church on how to properly memorialize residential school survivors, information sharing about missing children and offering \"healing services\" to family members of those who attended the school. Casimir said the possible excavation of the Kamloops school site has not begun as it's a \"very sensitive step moving forward,\" that involves work with other nations, survivors and their families. This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 28, 2024. The Canadian Press",

Unless STEM stands for “sleeping, tequila, eating, and memes,\" then you're not going to catch me doing a math problem with a letter in it. So, yes, my embarrassing confession is that I don't quite understand many of the memes below. But I am a girls girl. I support women in STEM, I support women any chance I can get! So let me first applaud you for not letting the patriarchy dumb you down. And second, present you with some memes I hope you find funny as a show of my appreciation!

    "text": "Eine Reduzierung der US-Militärhilfe für die Ukraine werde weder zu einem dauerhaften Frieden in der Ukraine führen noch den russischen Präsidenten Wladimir Putin dazu zwingen, seine Siegtheorie zu überdenken, schreibt die Washingtoner Denkfabrik \"Institute for the Study of War\". Vielmehr berge dies das Risiko von größeren Vorteilen für Russland auf dem Schlachtfeld und würde Putin wahrscheinlich in seiner Überzeugung stärken, dass Russland die Ukraine besiegen kann, schreibt das ISW . Am Dienstag hatte Pentagon-Chef Pete Hegseth erklärt, dass die USA beabsichtigten, ihre Mittel für den Kauf von Waffen für die Ukraine im Jahr 2026 zu kürzen. Angaben zum Umfang der geplanten Kürzungen machte Hegseth nicht. Dem ISW zufolge sagte Hegseth vor einem Ausschuss des US-Repräsentantenhauses, dass \"eine verhandelte, friedliche Lösung\" im besten Interesse der Ukraine, Russlands und der Vereinigten Staaten liege, dass jedoch \"der Begriff Sieg\" sowie der Weg zum Sieg und zum Frieden nicht klar definiert seien.\n+++ 08:17 Weichert zu Reaktion in Ukraine: \"SPD-Vorstoß erntet Kopfschütteln statt Empörung\" +++\nProminente SPD-Politiker wie Miersch und Stegner fordern Gespräche mit Russland. Führende Mitglieder der Bundestagsfraktion distanzieren sich von diesem Vorstoß. In der Ukraine wiederum wird das Papier laut ntv-Reporter Jürgen Weichert positiv, aber auch mit Skepsis aufgenommen.\n+++ 07:50 Bericht: EU schlägt Sanktionen gegen zwei kleine chinesische Banken vor +++\nNach Informationen von Bloomberg schlägt die Europäische Union Sanktionen gegen zwei kleine chinesische Banken vor, weil diese Russland dabei geholfen haben sollen, die bestehenden Handelsbeschränkungen der EU zu umgehen. Durch die vorgeschlagenen Sanktionen würde es Finanzinstituten mit Sitz in der EU verboten, Transaktionen mit den beiden regionalen Kreditinstituten durchzuführen, die in der Nähe der chinesischen Grenze zu Russland ansässig seien, meldet Bloomberg und verweist auf eingesehene Dokumente. Die Namen der Banken nennt Bloomberg nicht, da die Maßnahmen noch nicht offiziell sind. Die EU-Mitgliedsländer müssen den von der EU-Kommission vorgeschlagenen Sanktionen zustimmen. Zuletzt hatte die Regierung der Slowakei Widerstand gegen das 18. Sanktionspaket der EU angekündigt. Bratislava stört sich am geplanten Aus für den Import von Gas, Öl und Kernbrennstoffen.\n+++ 07:30 Pistorius: Moskau derzeit nicht an friedlicher Lösung interessiert +++\nBei seinem Besuch in der Ukraine verurteilt Verteidigungsminister Boris Pistorius die verstärkten russischen Luftangriffe auf das Land, die \"außerordentlich heftig und bedrohlich mit der großen Zahl von Marschflugkörpern und Drohnenangriffen\" seien. \"Das setzt ein klares Zeichen aus Moskau: Es gibt kein Interesse an einer friedlichen Lösung derzeit, sondern es werden mit unverminderter Härte und vor allen Dingen auch wieder zunehmend zivile Bereiche in der Ukraine angegriffen\", sagt Pistorius auf dem Bahnhof in Kiew. Seine Reise zeige, dass auch die neue Bundesregierung weiter an der Seite der Ukraine stehe. \"Natürlich wird es darum gehen, wie die Unterstützung Deutschlands und auch der anderen Europäer in Zukunft aussehen wird. Was wir tun können, beispielsweise im Bereich der Industriekooperation, aber auch der sonstigen Unterstützung.\"\n+++ 07:08 Selenskyj: \"Trump sieht, dass die russische Seite nicht ehrlich ist\" +++\nDer ukrainische Präsident Wolodymyr Selenskyj ist überzeugt, dass Kremlchef Wladimir Putin keinen Frieden will und Verhandlungen mit der Ukraine führt, um Sanktionen zu vermeiden. Für die Russen sei es wichtig, US-Präsident Donald Trump zu zeigen, \"dass es eine diplomatische Brücke zwischen der Ukraine und Russland gibt\", sagt Selenskyj der \"Bild\"-Zeitung. \"Damit keine Sanktionen gegen Russland eingeführt werden\", solange verhandelt werde, wird der ukrainische Präsident weiter zitiert. Seinen Worten zufolge ist ein weiteres Ziel der Russen, die Ukraine zu isolieren. Sie wollten \"einen Dialog ohne Europäer und ohne Amerikaner\", so Selenskyj. Trump habe Putin durchschaut, glaubt er: \"Präsident Trump sieht, dass die russische Seite nicht ganz offen und ehrlich ist, was den Krieg betrifft\", sagt Selenskyj. \"Ich denke, dass Russland Trump einfach anlügt.\"\n+++ 06:40 Grünen-Chefin bezeichnet \"Manifest\" als \"höchst irritierend\" +++\nDie Vorsitzende der Grünen, Franziska Brantner, kritisiert das jüngste \"Manifest\" prominenter SPD-Politiker für eine Abkehr von der Aufrüstungspolitik und direkte diplomatische Gespräche mit Russland. \"Dass führende SPD-Politiker eine Kehrtwende in der Außenpolitik und im Umgang mit Russland fordern, ist höchst irritierend\", sagt sie dem Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland. \"Niemand sehnt sich mehr nach Frieden als die Ukrainerinnen und Ukrainer. Und das sogenannte Manifest lässt unerwähnt, dass es seit Jahren immer wieder diplomatische Initiativen für Frieden mit Russland gibt. Die von den USA initiierten Gespräche in Riad und Istanbul sind nur die jüngsten Beispiele. Bisher ist Putins Antwort auf diese Bemühungen immer mehr Gewalt.\"\n+++ 06:06 Pistorius ist in Kiew +++\nVerteidigungsminister Boris Pistorius ist zu politischen Gesprächen in der ukrainischen Hauptstadt Kiew eingetroffen. Der SPD-Politiker sagt, er wolle sich über die Lage in der Ukraine informieren und mit Regierungsvertretern über weitere Militärhilfe für das von Russland angegriffene Land sprechen. Vor seiner Reise hatte er erklärt: \"Wir setzen alles daran, die Ukraine so zu unterstützen, dass sie sich verteidigen kann und in eine Position kommt, in der Russland zu ernsthaften Verhandlungen bereit ist.\" Mehr dazu lesen Sie hier.\nVerteidigungsminister Boris Pistorius (l), kommt am Morgen mit einem Sonderzug in Kiew an und wird vom deutschen Botschafter in der Ukraine, Martin Jäger, begrüßt.\n(Foto: dpa)\n+++ 04:42 Zwölf Verletzte bei Angriff auf Charkiw +++\nCharkiw wird in der Nacht erneut von russischen Drohnen angegriffen. Laut Bürgermeister Ihor Techerow gab es bei den elf Detonationen zwölf Verletzte, davon vier Kinder. \"Wohngebiete, Bildungseinrichtungen, Kindergärten und die Infrastruktur wurden durch Beschuss getroffen. Dutzende von Autos wurden beschädigt, Fenster in Schulen und Häusern gingen zu Bruch\", schreibt er auf Telegram. In der Nacht zuvor starben bei einem massiven Angriff auf die Stadt zwei Menschen.\n+++ 02:48 Walter-Borjans: \"Putin lässt sich nicht kaputtrüsten\" +++\nDer frühere SPD-Chef Norbert Walter-Borjans verteidigt das von ihm unterschriebene \"Friedensmanifest\". \"So wünschenswert es wäre, einem Narzissten ohne jedes Entgegenkommen eine stabile Weltordnung abzuringen - es ist leider nicht nur in diesem Fall illusorisch. (...) Wir plädierten einfach nur für Gespräche mit Russland\", sagt Walter-Borjans dem \"Stern\". Namentlich nannte er den CDU-Politiker Roderich Kiesewetter, der das Manifest auf X als \"ungeheuerlich\" bezeichnet hatte. \"Was Herr Kiesewetter da loslässt, könnte man mit dem ebenso hanebüchenen Vorwurf kontern, da wolle jemand Krieg. Abrüstung nach innen scheint mir fast ebenso wichtig wie nach außen\", so der SPD-Politiker. Es gehe nicht darum, eine Wahrheit gegen eine andere zu stellen, sondern es gehe um das Eingeständnis, dass ein Menschenverächter wie Putin nicht kaputtzurüsten sei.\n+++ 01:13 Sicherheitspolitiker: Deutschland unterschätzt Einsatz russischer \"Einweg-Agenten\" +++\nSicherheitspolitiker aus Regierung und Opposition warnen vor dem verstärkten Einsatz russischer Agenten in Deutschland. \"Längst spielen sogenannte \"Wegwerf- oder auch Single-Use-Agenten\" bei ganz verschiedenen russischen Operationen eine entscheidende Rolle\", sagt Grünen-Fraktionsvize Konstantin von Notz der \"Rheinischen Post\". Geheimdienste werben dabei Menschen ohne geheimdienstliche Ausbildung gegen Bezahlung etwa für Sabotageaktionen an. Dass diese oft dabei auffliegen, ist Teil des Kalküls. \"Leider nehmen viele noch immer nicht wahr, wie ernst die Lage ist\", so von Notz. Auch CDU-Sicherheitsexperte Roderich Kiesewetter hält die Gefahr für unterschätzt: \"Da bislang keine nennenswerten Maßnahmen oder Reaktionen aus Deutschland erfolgt sind, hat Russland bislang nichts zu befürchten, sondern stärkt sich de facto durch unsere Schwäche\", sagt er der \"Rheinischen Post\".\n+++ 00:02 Trotz Widerstands aus der Slowakei: Merz rechnet mit Konsens über Russland-Sanktionen +++\nBundeskanzler Friedrich Merz geht trotz Widerstands aus der Slowakei davon aus, dass sich die EU auf neue Sanktionen gegen Russland einigen wird. Er sei und bleibe zuversichtlich, dass es auch mit dem 18. Sanktionspakt einen Konsens in der Europäischen Union gebe. Der Ausschuss der Ständigen Vertreter werde das Thema nächste Woche zum ersten Mal auf der Tagesordnung haben. \"Gegebenenfalls müssen wir dann noch mal im Europäischen Rat darüber sprechen, aber vielleicht gibt es bereits in der nächsten Woche dazu eine Übereinkunft.\" Die Slowakei droht, geplante neue EU-Sanktionen gegen Russland mit einem Veto zu blockieren, weil sie keine Ausnahmegenehmigung für russische Energieimporte bekommen soll.\n+++ 22:56 Selenskyj: Entzug der US-Hilfe wäre \"eine Mine oder Bombe\" +++\nDer ukrainische Präsident Selenskyj warnt vor massiven Auswirkungen, falls die USA die Unterstützung für sein Land kürzen oder ganz einstellen sollten. \"Wenn sie wirklich die Hilfe kürzen, werden wir das spüren. Das wird die Ukraine spüren, aber auch andere Staaten. Das ist eine Welle der Risiken für andere Staaten, für alle Staaten und vor allem für Europa\", sagt Selenskyj in einem Interview mit Medien des Axel-Springer-Verlags. \"Das ist eine Bombe oder eine Mine, wenn die Hilfe der Ukraine entzogen würde\", so Selenskyj in dem Gespräch weiter. \"Das kann die Sicherheit in jedem Land sprengen.\" Derzeit laufe die Militärhilfe aus den USA für sein Land zwar ohne Verzögerungen weiter es gebe aber keine neuen Zusagen.\n+++ 22:00 Wadephul berät in Rom mit europäischen Außenministern über Unterstützung für Ukraine +++\nBundesaußenminister Johann Wadephul reist am Donnerstag nach Italien. Zunächst wird er Gespräche mit Vertretern des Vatikans führen, wie sein Ministerium mitteilt. Anschließend nimmt Wadephul an einem Treffen im Format Weimar plus mit den Außenministern Frankreichs, Polens, Italiens, Großbritanniens und Spaniens teil, bei dem über die weitere Unterstützung der Ukraine sowie die Stärkung der europäischen Verteidigung beraten werden soll. Der ukrainische Außenminister Andrij Sybiha, die EU-Außenbeauftragten Kaja Kallas und Nato-Generalsekretär Mark Rutte werden ebenfalls in Rom erwartet.\n+++ 21:30 Selenskyj: Kreml will Korridor bis nach Rumänien erobern +++\nDer ukrainische Präsident Wolodymyr Selenskyj hat Russland vorgeworfen, weitreichendere Eroberungspläne zu verfolgen, als offiziell bekannt. \"Die russischen Militärpläne zielen auf diese Region - Odessa - und dann auf die Grenzen zu Moldawien und Rumänien\", sagt Selenskyj bei einem Gipfel mit den Staats- und Regierungschefs aus Südosteuropa in Odessa. Russland strebe danach, in der Region Chaos zu säen, um Europa insgesamt zu schwächen. Kurz nach Beginn des russischen Angriffskriegs hatte Rustam Minnekajew, ein ranghoher General in Moskau, die Kontrolle über den Süden der Ukraine und den Landweg zu der von Moldau abtrünnigen Region Transnistrien zu den Kriegszielen erklärt. Offiziell hatte sich der Kreml dazu allerdings nicht bekannt.\n+++ 21:05 Russland signalisiert Gelassenheit angesichts womöglich niedrigerem Ölpreis-Deckel +++\nRussland hat gelassen auf Sanktionspläne der EU für einen noch niedrigeren Preisdeckel für sein Öl reagiert. \"Russland lebt nicht den ersten Tag unter verschiedenen Einschränkungen, die wir vor allem für illegal halten\", sagte Kremlsprecher Dmitri Peskow der russischen Nachrichtenagentur Interfax zufolge. \"Und Russland hat bereits einige sehr nützliche Erfahrungen gesammelt, um die Folgen solcher Entscheidungen zu minimieren.\" Die EU will den Preisdeckel für russisches Öl von derzeit 60 US-Dollar je Barrel auf 45 US-Dollar je Barrel senken. Ziel ist es, dass die Energiegroßmacht, die seit mehr als drei Jahren Krieg gegen die Ukraine führt, weniger Geld aus dem Rohstoffverkauf einnimmt.\n+++ 20:21 Südosteuropäische Staaten verurteilen russischen Angriffskrieg gegen Ukraine +++\nDie Regierungschefs mehrerer südosteuropäischer Staaten haben auf einem Gipfel in der ukrainischen Hafenstadt Odessa in einer gemeinsamen Erklärung die russische Invasion der Ukraine verurteilt. \"Wir verurteilen den brutalen Angriffskrieg Russlands gegen die Ukraine auf das Schärfste\", heißt es in dem veröffentlichten Dokument. Unterzeichner waren unter anderem der neu gewählte rumänische Präsident Nicusor Dan, seine moldauische Kollegin Maia Sandu sowie die Regierungschefs Bulgarien, Griechenlands, Kroatiens und weiterer Balkanstaaten. Weiter heißt es in der Erklärung, die unterzeichnenden Staatenlenker bekräftigten ihre \"Verpflichtung, der Ukraine und ihrem Volk so lange wie nötig umfassende und nachhaltige Unterstützung zu gewähren\" und forderten \"alle Nationen auf, von jeglicher Art materieller oder sonstiger Hilfe für die Kriegsanstrengungen Russlands abzusehen\". Der \"vollständige Rückzug russischer Truppen und russischen Militärgeräts vom gesamten ukrainischen Staatsgebiet\" seien \"zentrale und nicht verhandelbare Bedingungen für einen Frieden\".\nAlle früheren Entwicklungen können Sie hier nachverfolgen.\nQuelle: ntv.de, ino/hul/dpa/rts/AFP",

Their disruptive actions are not conductive to the site, and discussion is needed to deal with both of them. --It's-a me, [Lefty](/wiki/User:LeftyGreenMario) [Green](/wiki/User_talk:LeftyGreenMario) [Mario](/wiki/Special:Contributions/LeftyGreenMario)!( [Mod](/wiki/RationalWiki:Moderators)) 03:09, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- The reason I kept talking to GC is because from my end it looks like people like to turn a blind eye to the way he talks to other people. I have been called out for flaming in the past (playful language, like \"dingledorf\"), which I have ceased when I was. This guy routinely does it in bad faith, with much harsher language, and does not even cease when asked to stop, and assumes everyone is out to get him in the occasions he realizes he might have to face consequences, like now. A banned user has given me a theory of why he gets away with it and to say the least it's one I do not agree with at all. I've already mentioned on ATIM I'm ok with an iban. Generally speaking a couple of people on here I wont mention by name have been hostile to me in the past which might explain the rocky history, but yes I have blood on my hands so to speak.--\n[2friedeggs](/wiki/User:2friedeggs)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:2friedeggs)) 03:16, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- I would support an interaction ban as well.

I'm tired, I've had multiple anxiety attacks (unrelated to this drama), I'm depressed, I'm annoyed, and I really don't have the energy to fight over this crap, on this site, any further. I left of my own volition, and honestly, I don't know why I even responded to LGM's comments, since in hindsight they were just... I don't even know what. 2friedeggs can go fuck himself though, given he started this crap. Do what you feel needs to be done.

Not to mention his swipes at the community at large. One example: Block logon Let Them Eat Cake while I was going through the ATIM process because that's how we normally handle trolls on the wiki, through getting opinion of the mob: (\"You people are idiots.\"). Second example: [[6]]https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Special:Log/GrammarCommie(\"I quit. Rot in hell\".) Third example: unwarranted attack on the moderators while also regularly contributing to disruption [[7]]https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vortex&diff=prev&oldid=2455474\"Obviously someone needs to keep some level of order around here, and it sure as shit isn't the Mods or yourself.\" It's going to continue. It doesn't matter to me \"who started\", they're both problems.\n- I'm not particularly sympathetic to your personal issues either, GC, not much anymore, especially after your graphic all-caps remarks in spite of my pleas to stop through discord dms and block logs, and your horrible personal attacks on me, but you're letting it spill over on this site a few too many times and I'm still going to say you need a ton of self-control and improvement on your end. I don't like how this all soured, I don't like cooping you at all, but I care about the community too. --It's-a me,\n[Lefty](/wiki/User:LeftyGreenMario) [Green](/wiki/User_talk:LeftyGreenMario) [Mario](/wiki/Special:Contributions/LeftyGreenMario)!( [Mod](/wiki/RationalWiki:Moderators)) 04:07, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- GrammarCommie has been complained about multiple recent times at ATIM, and was nearly blocked recently\n[[8]]https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/RationalWiki_talk:All_things_in_moderation/Archive54but Plutocow and 2friedeggs were recently ibanned, suggesting it could be more on Eggs then GC, as weird as that feels to say [[9]]https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/RationalWiki_talk:All_things_in_moderation/Archive57#Votes_for_Plutocow_and_2friedeggs, where GC was also being hyper-aggressive.

Since GC already quit, it's just a matter of giving infractions like anyone else if they're in clear violation of site rules. I haven't been paying enough attention to eggs to say much. Basically, if you stop to think for a minute whether your comment is actually worth posting over going for a walk or playing a game and saying \"okay fuck that noise\" for a while, avoiding the conflict tends to work out better. It also tends to work out better for you because the person you are pissed at will tend to get themselves in trouble more when you don't respond. Basically, just don't fight people.

Also re-sysop for 2fried if GC or a Discord buddy of them once again desysopped 2fried. GC is also not an active or contributing member, and has stated, for multiple reasons, he will no longer want to be contribing to various talk pages and saloon bar discussions, so an iban makes no sense. His only presence is on a Discord room that appears to be totally defunct, and so the only people who will defend him are fellow Discord mods. I have not encountered any issues from 2fried but once shared with him that I experienced similar issues with GC. 2fried also seems to be a very active contributing member to mainspace, and with a lack of history of incivility on his end, I see no reason to have this ATIM blow back on him. Now leftygreen is also experiencing unecessary drama from GC. Basta, it's enough\n[Neiltyson1fan](/wiki/User:Neiltyson1fan)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Neiltyson1fan)) 11:51, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- Should the topic of GC's incivility, goading, editing of other people's comments, threatening behaviour, and inability to get along with bread and butter editors once again grace the coop, where they try to resign or bow out before more comments, and who's only contributions to the wiki have been spam cleaning and talk page drama over years now, would propose an idef ban on GC.\n[Neiltyson1fan](/wiki/User:Neiltyson1fan)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Neiltyson1fan)) 12:24, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- If a recent iban of all things makes it more on me fine just end this, resysop me, and iban me from him so that I don't enable his stage-like drama any longer, it'll be good for both of us.--\n- GrammarCommie has been complained about multiple recent times at ATIM, and was nearly blocked recently\n- Nope but I do also call attention to their history.

I support a sysoprevoke on GC.\n[Andrew5 mobile](/wiki/User:Andrew5_mobile) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Andrew5_mobile)) 13:41, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- Someone informed me GC desysopped 2fried against sysop rules, and without consultation with the community. I have resysopped 2fried as it was not in consultation with the community. I don't know much about 2fried's talk page history, but I have not seen any abusive behaviour from him, including misuse of sysop, and his mainspace edits are good. Should this coop vote to desysop 2fried I'd respect the decision, but right now the coop is leaning in favor of dysopping GC and perhaps an iban btw 2\n[Neiltyson1fan](/wiki/User:Neiltyson1fan)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Neiltyson1fan)) 14:04, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- Current thoughts: I wondered for awhile how my little comment on GC's page, a little critique spiralled into a coop issue and really he sysoprevoke me because I banned him and disabled talk page privileges for harassment. That right there was not cool in hind sight and was because he kept reverting my criticism of him while name-calling me at the same time. But I probably should have been patient. The mods sure seem to be and perhaps they know something about GC that makes them try to be patient with him. GC is not shy from bringing his mental health up. I don't know GC well.\n- I wanna make one thing clear: GC has likely stopped many a spammer. He's a wonder at that, that's for sure.

If so, stop accusing anyone of bias.\nTime for cooler heads to prevail\nPreface: Because of the sheer amounts of HCM on display, I will not put up with any slapfighting in the replies to this section. That is to say, I am throwing a mod fiat and any slapfighting will be moved under a collapse. If you don't like it, further complaining\nwill result in beatings until the morale improves may lead to short term blocks.\nOkay so first. Let's unpack this situation instead of just commenting on it during work breaks (me). For some reason everyone is exploring the full range of potential that HCM holds and isn't posting any logs until GC did so a bit earlier. Let's walk through those and try to build a timeline.\nTimeline of events (timestamps are in my timezone - they're still chronological, which is what matters):\n- 16 June 2022: GC bans himself from the wiki alongside temporarily banning 2friedeggs. Events prior to this and the leadup to this LANCB will not be considered for this timeline, mostly because we need to cap this timeline off somewhere.\n- 1 July 2022: GC shortly unbans himself to remove an old essay made on the site. He reblocks himself immediately after.\n- 3 July 2022:\n- Let Them Eat Cake (LETC) is reported to All Things In Moderation by LeftyGreenMario for transphobic trolling.\n- 16:20 GC unbans himself, indefinitely blocks LTEC (16:30), and blocks himself again immediately after (16:31).\n- 20:59 LGM makes\nthis commenton GCs talkpage, to attempt to resolve the initial events that led to LANCB of GC (afaict).\n- 4 July 2022:\n- 00:24 GC replies\nwith this commentand LGM replies again(00:26).\n- 01:30 2friedeggs replies\nwith this inflammatory comment.\n- 13:54\nGC reverts 2friedeggs commentand responds to LGM(13:54-14:10, 3 edits, cut down for brevity's sake).\n- 00:24 GC replies\n- 5 July 2022:\n- 02:35 2friedeggs and GC edit war over the aforementioned inflammatory comment (edit war is at 03:05, 03:08).\n- 03:08 2friedeggs blocks GC with talkpage access disabled (this is the first instance of user rights being abused).\n- 03:20 GC unblocks himself, blocks 2friedeggs and strips him of rights (alongside two alts of 2friedeggs).\n- 03:22 2friedeggs files an\nATIM case against GC, citing privilege abuse. This slaps back and forth until this coop case is opened.\n- 03:23 2friedeggs reports to GC that he's been posted on ATIM\nwith a new inflammatory comment.\n- 03:49 LGM replies to the resolution thread\nhttps://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GrammarCommie&diff=2467368&oldid=2467341. GC responds again telling LGM to not interact with him anymore.\n- 05:01 LGM gives GC a 9 hour block (talkpage access enabled)\n- 05:07 LGM tells GC that he's\nin the coop.\n- 05:11 LGM unblocks GC.\n- 05:58 GC blocks himself.\n- 16:46 GC unblocks himself to respond to the coop.\nI've omitted the details of the ATIM case, you can observe the last revision of that\nhttps://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki_talk:All_things_in_moderation&oldid=2467428.\nThese are the facts of the current coop.\nNow for some opinions of mine:\nFirst, while I prior softly threw up boomeranging 2friedeggs' sysop abuse for gross incompetence, I think this should be acted upon even further. 2friedeggs is blatantly incapable of acting with any responsibility whatsoever and I frankly think that he should be permanently banned for excessive inflammatory behavior (he has a history of this, see\narchive 53, archive 55 and archive 57, plus he has an outstanding interaction ban with Plutocow for similar inflammatory/straight up annoying behavior when it comes to disagreements with others).\nSecondly there is the matter of GC. It's... not exactly a secret that GC responds poorly to people badgering him or when he gets aggravated (which happens easily) and because he's a prolific editor, he attracts a lot of people that badger him. We've slapped GC on the wrist before for crossing the lines into what he's said and as far as I can currently assume, the self-exile was a decision made to prevent this from getting out of hand. That being said, having a lot of cases made against you is not necessarily grounds in and of itself for removal from the site. While frustrating the entire site on a regular basis is a good way to get shorttracked into a ban, GC largely doesn't do this; it's invariably editors who themselves have issues. That isn't to say GC is entirely clean, but for this case, I cannot in good conscience recommend punishing GC. Outside of the timeline, it should be noted that GCs original LANCB\n[was triggered over a conflict with 2friedeggs](/wiki/User_talk:2friedeggs#Inciting_incident).\nThirdly, we need to address neiltyson1fan and like... actually do it properly. He really almost warrants his own section for how much he's climbed on the chair to accuse GC of being a bad faith actor. For some history; neiltyson1fan originally ragequit the site because of attempted ownership of the\n[Incel](/wiki/Incel) page, which he kept whitewashed to promote a wiki which he has a COI with for several years. You can read this pretty much entirely on [the first archive for that page](/wiki/Talk:Incel/Archive1#Neiltyson1fan_promotes_his_own_wiki_and_websites_here_while_deleting_competing_websites). There's a lot of other problems with neiltyson1fan as well, such as attempting ownership of the [MMT](/wiki/MMT) page (which he got so annoyed with that he copy-pasted the entire page into his [userspace](/w/index.php?title=User:Neiltyson1fan/Nice_version_of_MMT_page&action=edit&redlink=1)), and mind you that this is all over a mere disagreement on page content. He eventually completely ragequit the site after GC crossed a line when it came to being aggravated (which got handled appropriately at the time by on-site staff and led to some words about GC not posting about self-harm in the bar anymore).\nI will also note that, and this is frankly far more disgusting (although I had forgotten about this), neiltyson1fan's disagreements with me being a \"bad moderator\" come from the fact that he tried to go sysop shopping off-site to get GC banned during that event where he (neiltyson1fan) ragequit (or in his phrasing: \"make friends\"), part of which involved sending me and some other users some frankly really creepy messages in retrospect (amongst other things telling me that \"i want to connect with you on a personal level\", when I told him that I was a mod and was doing my duties as a mod). I'd not follow up too much on this at the time as I had IRL issues that largely prevented me from interacting with the site.\nBecause of all this, as well as his current inflammatory behavior in the coup, I am recommending an indefinite ban for neiltyson1fan as well for editor harassment, inability to resolve arguments peacefully and attempting to badger other editors into making bad decisions.\nI would like to remind anyone who made it this far that the previous mod fiat is in effect and slapfighting will all be thrown together under a general collapse. --\n[Techpriest](/wiki/User:Techpriest) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Techpriest)) 17:32, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- You got the\neventsa little wrongthere, he could've unblocked himself to do something else too but he decided to actually permablock me, not temp block me.

LGM blocked both of us so he could coop us then unblocked us for the coop My \"inflammatory comment\" was telling GC he needs a break if he can't find a reason to contribute. When LGM told GC to take it easy he asked LGM to never contact him again. I do suspect some bias due to GC's status on the wiki which I accepted long ago but this is particularly egregious. I don't care about GC anymore since I realized he's likely on edge because of Neilty harassing him for months now. Personally I feel caught up in that now. But if you're going to find a reason to ban me do it right and without omitting things please.

Anyway, I mostly looked into this from the perspective of what actually occured as an inciting incident, hence why I've left some things out. I sorta assumed that was the reason why GC got a short block; LGM usually doesn't block people out of mere anger. I don't really think there's a reason to ban you anymore, sysoprevoke is still something I'd recommend. I consider the comment inflammatory because it's basically telling a person who left the site in an attempt to not get angry at you that he can better stay away.

    "text": "En la madrugada de este jueves, seis hombres armados intimidaron y amordazaron al vigilante de un parqueadero del barrio Laureles, hurtaron cuatro vehículos y emprendieron la huida. Los hechos se registraron exactamente a la 1:00 de la madrugada en este estacionamiento privado, ubicado en la calle 39 con carrera 90. Un par de horas después, la víctima logró desamarrarse y dar aviso por medio de la línea de emergencia 123, momento desde el cual las autoridades adelantaron la búsqueda con los visualizadores de cámaras LPR (las de reconocimiento de placas de vehículos), logrando ubicar los automotores en zona rural en la vía Medellín – Bogotá. Fue allí que uniformados de la Seccional de Tránsito y Transporte Antioquia que estaban desplegados por el corredor vial nacional, interceptaron los vehículos a la altura de Doradal, corregimiento del municipio de Puerto Triunfo. “Inmediatamente se activa el plan candado y un cerco tecnológico que nos permite identificar las placas de los vehículos que fueron hurtados y, en coordinación con la seccional de Tránsito y Transporte, ubicar estas camionetas, capturar a estos seis delincuentes en la vía Medellín-San Luis-Antioquia”, indicó el teniente coronel César Rodríguez, comandante Operativo de la Policía Metropolitana. Las autoridades capturaron a seis personas y recuperaron cuatro vehículos que habían sido robados de un parqueadero del barrio Laureles en Medellín. En los hechos un vigilante fue amarrado. Policías de Tránsito los interceptaron en Doradal, sobre la vía Medellín- Bogotá.— Blu Antioquia (@BLUAntioquia) [pic.twitter.com/qBptjDzypr] [June 13, 2024] Publicidad De acuerdo con la Policía Metropolitana del Valle de Aburrá, durante el megaoperativo con plan candado fueron capturados seis hombres con edades entre los 19 y 32 años, se inmovilizó un vehículo que fue utilizado para cometer los hechos, se incautaron un arma de fuego y ocho celulares, además de los cuatro camionetas recuperadas. “Uno de los vehículos estaba equipado con un sistema de GPS, lo que nos permitió localizarlo en Doradal, donde llegó la policía, logró interceptarlos y capturar a los seis delincuentes implicados en este caso. Estas personas ya se encuentran procesadas y tendrán que responder ante las autoridades competentes”, detalló Manuel Villa, secretario de seguridad de Medellín.",

Fermate il genocidio. Questo avrebbe dovuto essere un momento di gioia e invece stiamo piangendo. Se Gesù dovesse nascere oggi, sarebbe nato sotto le macerie a Gaza ». Dalla basilica della Natività di Betlemme, il reverendo luterano padre Munther Isaac in questi giorni ha collocato la statuetta del Bambinello in un presepe di rovine, avvolto dalla bandiera palestinese e contemporaneamente ha diffuso un durissimo manifesto dai contorni politici. E' rivolto soprattutto ai cristiani del mondo ai quali chiede di smettere di essere idealmente complici con israeliani e Stati Uniti (facilmente individuabili anche se mai citati espressamente). «Il silenzio è complicità». «Se non si riesce a chiamarlo un genocidio è un peccato».\nAPPROFONDIMENTI L'INTERVISTA Betlemme città fantasma",

    "text": "Las mujeres afganas desafían a los talibanes en las calles el 8 de marzo para reclamar 'derechos y libertades'\nNoticias de hoy: Los precios al consumidor en China están aumentando por primera vez en seis meses, impulsados por el Año Nuevo. Punjab, blasfemia: un estudiante de 22 años fue condenado a muerte por mensajes de Whatsapp y otro de 17 años fue condenado a cadena perpetua. Según una investigación de la ONU, Irán es responsable de la \"violencia física\" que mató a Mahsa Amini. Los asentamientos de colonos y los ataques en Cisjordania han alcanzado niveles récord.\nAFGANISTÁN\nDesafiando las prohibiciones y la represión de los talibanes, grupos de mujeres afganas\nse manifestaron ayer (en espacios privados), por el Día Internacional de la Mujer para pedir la abolición de límites y restricciones. Se realizaron manifestaciones en las provincias de Takhar y Balkh, bajo el lema \"Derechos, justicia y libertad\" y al grito de \"salven a las mujeres afganas\".\nCHINA\nPor primera vez en seis meses\nsubieron los precios al consumidor gracias a los gastos por el Año Nuevo chino, ofreciendo un respiro a la segunda economía más grande del mundo que lucha contra la debilidad de los consumidores. El índice de los precios al consumo (IPC) aumentó un 0,7% interanual en febrero, según la Oficina Nacional de Estadísticas (NBS), superando el +0,3% previsto por los economistas. Están aumentando los productos alimenticios clave, como la carne de cerdo y las verduras frescas, así como los viajes.\nPAKISTÁN\nUn tribunal de Lahore, Punjab, condenó a muerte a un estudiante de 22 años\nacusado de blasfemia por unos mensajes que envió a través de Whatsapp porque, según los jueces, ha ofendido los sentimientos de los musulmanes. Otro joven de 17 años deberá cumplir cadena perpetua por el mismo hecho. Ambos niegan los cargos. Supuestamente los mensajes contenían fotografías y vídeos despectivos sobre Mahoma y sus esposas.\nIRÁN - ONU\nIrán es responsable de la \"violencia física\" que provocó la\nmuerte de Mahsa Amini y ha cometido crímenes contra la humanidad en la represión de las protestas callejeras. Así lo estableció una misión de investigación de la ONU, que habla de \"traumatismos en el cuerpo\" de la joven cuando se encontraba \"bajo custodia de la policía moral\". Las autoridades recurrieron a un \"uso innecesario y desproporcionado de fuerza letal\" para sofocar las manifestaciones al grito de \"Mujeres, vida, libertad\".\nISRAEL - PALESTINA\nLos\nasentamientos en Cisjordania se han expandido a una velocidad récord y podrían eliminar cualquier posibilidad de un Estado palestino. Según el Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos, Volker Turk, \"la violencia de los colonos judíos y la expansión de los asentamientos están alcanzando niveles traumatizantes\". Un informe de 16 páginas documenta la construcción de 24.300 nuevas viviendas en un año, la cifra más alta desde 2017. Desde el 7 de octubre, 400 palestinos han sido asesinados por los colonos o el ejército israelí.\nINDIA - MYANMAR\nDelhi inició ayer las\ndeportaciones de miles de ciudadanos de Myanmar que huyeron del país debido a la ola de violentos enfrentamientos entre la Junta Militar y los rebeldes. Los refugiados habían cruzado la frontera nororiental de la India e ingresaron en Manipur. La repatriación comienza un mes después de la suspensión del acuerdo de libre circulación y la construcción de un muro en la frontera.\nRUSIA\nEl metropolitano ortodoxo ruso Ignatiy de Saratov, en el sur de Rusia, ha decidido demoler la Iglesia de la Pasión de la ciudad, que estuvo cerrada durante el período soviético, fue devuelta en 2012 y todavía no se ha restaurado. En su lugar, se construirá un edificio dedicado a la educación patriótica y militar de la juventud, de acuerdo con las autoridades civiles y militares locales.\nKIRGUISTÁN\nEn Kirguistán se ha derrumbado otra pirámide financiera, la empresa Charge Fast ha dejado a cientos de ciudadanos en la quiebra debido a la manipulación de sumas que oscilaban entre 10.000 y 1,5 millones de som. El dinero se presentaba como una apuesta de lotería. La magnitud de las protestas obligaron a intervenir a la policía y ponen en evidencia la amplia difusión del fenómeno.\nLa OMS sobre Gaza: nivel \"extremo\" de desnutrición infantil en el norte de la Franja\n06/03/2024 10:09",
