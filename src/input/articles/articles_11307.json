    "text": "The signs of life shown by the initial public offering (IPO) market in the U.S., especially in the second half of the year, are giving analysts hope that more companies will be enticed to go public in 2024. Overall, 108 initial public offerings raised proceeds of about $19.4 billion in 2023, according to Renaissance Capital. That’s up from a dismal 71 IPOs for proceeds of $7.7 billion in 2022, when high inflation and rising interest rates discouraged companies from hitting the market. This year’s big IPOs included health-care products company Kenvue in May, U.K. chip designer Arm Holdings in September and footwear company Birkenstock in October. They accounted for over half of the total IPO proceeds, according to Renaissance Capital. Instacart also had a splashy IPO in late summer. A post-pandemic surge for IPOs was stifled by the highest inflation in four decades in 2022, raising concerns about the economy buckling under the pressure. The Federal Reserve then embarked on a historic round of rate hikes to tame inflation, which made borrowing more expensive and increased caution in the IPO market. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the monthly personal consumption and expenditures report, has cooled to a pace of 2.6% from a high of 7.1% in the middle of 2022. Other measures of inflation, such as the consumer price index, reached a peak of 9.1% in 2022. The central bank fought inflation by raising its benchmark rate from near zero to a range of 5.25% to 5.50%. The Fed has held that range steady for several months and has signaled that it could start cutting rates in 2024. Wall Street is betting that could happen early in the year. Cooling inflation and falling interest rates could push the IPO market back toward a more normal level of activity, which averaged about 170 IPOs with average proceeds of about $43 billion from 2017 to 2019. “While the IPO market’s recovery is still somewhat tenuous, all signs point to a solid pickup in 2024,” said Renaissance Capital in its recent IPO review for 2023. The IPO market is expected to grow along with an economy. Corporate profits are expected to rise after shaking off an earnings recession. Earnings gains of just under 2% during the fourth quarter of 2023 could be followed by a gain of more than 8% in the first quarter of 2024 and 10% during the second quarter of 2024 for companies in the S&P 500, analysts forecast. The S&P 500 index is on track to close the year with a gain of more than 20%. Wall Street is increasingly expecting the Fed to achieve its so-called soft landing goal by trimming inflation to the central bank’s 2% target without an ensuing recession. IPO activity could speed up as CEOs gain more confidence that the “soft landing” will happen, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis.",

    "text": "The AI Readiness Index in 2024 of Cisco reveals that only 22 per cent of organisations in Việt Nam are fully prepared to deploy and leverage AI-powered technologies. Photo courtesy of Cisco This decline underscores the challenges companies face in adopting, deploying, and fully leveraging AI. Given the rapid market evolution and the significant impact AI is anticipated to have on business operations, this readiness gap is especially critical.\nThis information was released by Cisco, a worldwide leader in networking and security, in its 2024 AI Readiness Index on Thursday.\nThe Index is based on a double-blind survey of 3,660 senior business leaders from organisations with 500 or more employees across 14 markets in the Asia-Pacific, Japan and China. These leaders are responsible for AI integration and deployment within their organisations. The AI readiness index is measured across six pillars: strategy, infrastructure, data, governance, talent and culture.\nAI has become a cornerstone for business strategy, with increasing urgency among companies to adopt and deploy AI technologies. In Việt Nam, enterprises report an increased urgency to deploy AI in the past year, driven primarily by leadership. Additionally, companies are committing a significant number of resources towards AI, with 48 per cent reporting that as much as 10 to 30 per cent of their IT budget is being allocated to AI deployment.\nDespite significant AI investments in strategic areas like cybersecurity, IT infrastructure, and data analytics and management, many companies report that returns on these investments are not meeting their expectations.\n“As companies accelerate their AI journeys, it's critical they adopt a comprehensive approach to implementation and connect the dots to link AI ambition with readiness,\" said Dzung Nguyen Nhu, Managing Director at Cisco Việt Nam, Cambodia, and Laos. “This year's AI Readiness Index reveals that to fully leverage the potential of AI, companies need a modern digital infrastructure capable of meeting evolving power needs and network latency requirements from growing AI workloads. This must be supported with the right visibility to achieve their business objectives.”\nCompanies recognise they need to do more to be better prepared to leverage AI effectively. Across Việt Nam, 63 per cent rated improving scalability, flexibility, and manageability of their IT infrastructure as their top priority, highlighting an awareness of the gaps that must be addressed to improve overall AI readiness.\nAddressing skills and talent gaps\nDespite unique challenges within each pillar, there is a common theme that has emerged across the board – that of lack of skilled workers. Companies highlighted this as the top challenge across infrastructure, data, and governance, underscoring the critical need for skilled professionals to drive AI initiatives.\nAnupam Trehan, VP of People and Communities APJC at Cisco, said: “As the race to adopt AI picks up pace, talent will be a key differentiator for companies. There is already a shortage of skilled talent across various aspects of AI. This means companies will need to invest in their existing talent pool to meet growing demand. At the same time, it is crucial that all stakeholders – the private and public sectors, educational institutions, and governments – work together to develop local talent so that the entire ecosystem can benefit from the immense potential that AI offers.” — VNS",
