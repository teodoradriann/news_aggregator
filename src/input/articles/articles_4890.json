    "text": "BEXAR COUNTY, Texas – An evacuation warning for the Calaveras Fire on Tuesday spread further than emergency officials intended.\nIn the face of the low humidity, high winds, a lack of air support and quickly moving flames on Tuesday, the Bexar County Office of Emergency Management issued a notice for people nearby the brush fire in southeast Bexar County to evacuate.\nThough the evacuation message was supposed to be aimed at people within a specific, geofenced area, BCOEM Deputy Chief Michael Morlan said it went out as a weather alert, which meant it reached more people than intended.\n>> SAFD fire chief says at least 5 structures affected by south Bexar County fire; residents can return home\nMorlan was unable to say how many people got the notification, but at least one KSAT viewer who was in Las Vegas at the time reported receiving an evacuation notice through a third-party weather app.\nAlthough the notification contained latitude and longitude coordinates at the bottom, the map in the notification display showed the entire county.\nMorlan said BCOEM would work with its vendor to make sure the incident didn’t happen again.\n“I mean, we’re ... the ones who clicked to send, right? So ultimately, we’re taking that responsibility that we did that,” he said.\nOnce the county realized the notification was going out further than the evacuation area, Morlan said it was canceled.\nThe City of San Antonio also sent out its own warning, which directed people to a nearby shelter.\nRelated coverage on KSAT.com:",

It's about getting into a protocol that's building something practical: a fully decentralized system for borrowing, lending, and generating passive income through blockchain infrastructure.\nThe project combines real usability with token mechanics that align closely with how DeFi is evolving in 2025.\nWhat makes Mutuum Finance different?\nCopy link to section\nMutuum Finance is a non-custodial lending protocol that enables users to either supply or borrow digital assets through smart contracts.\nIts dual lending structure allows both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending, giving users greater flexibility.\nFor those looking for predictable yield, supplying assets into liquidity pools through peer-to-contract lending is simple and automated.\nOn the flip side, peer-to-peer lending enables tailored agreements between users—particularly helpful for tokens not supported by liquidity pools, like meme coins or volatile altcoins.\nEvery asset deposited into the protocol mints an mtToken at a 1:1 nominal ratio.\nFor example, supplying USDT results in receiving mtUSDT.…\nCollaborations",

The second, which bestows a green card on those with advanced STEM degrees, governs a subset of an EB-2 (employment-based) visa.\" From the report: The USCIS data, reported exclusively by ScienceInsider, show that the number of O-1A visas awarded in the first year of the revised guidance jumped by almost 30%, to 4570, and held steady in fiscal year 2023, which ended on 30 September. Similarly, the number of STEM EB-2 visas approved in 2022 after a \" [national interest\" waiver](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-updates-guidance-on-national-interest-waivers)shot up by 55% over 2021, to 70,240, and stayed at that level this year. \"I'm seeing more aspiring and early-stage startup founders believe there's a way forward for them,\" says Silicon Valley immigration attorney Sophie Alcorn. She predicts the policy changes will result in \"new technology startups that would not have otherwise been created.\" President Joe Biden has long sought to make it easier for foreign-born STEM workers to remain in the country and use their talent to spur the U.S. economy. But under the terms of a 1990 law, only 140,000 employment-based green cards may be issued annually, and no more than 7% of those can go to citizens of any one country. The ceiling is well below the demand. And the country quotas have created decades-long queues for scientists and high-tech entrepreneurs born in India and China. The 2022 guidance doesn't alter those limits on employment-based green cards but clarifies the visa process for foreign-born scientists pending any significant changes to the 1990 law. The O-1A work visa, which can be renewed indefinitely, was designed to accelerate the path to a green card for foreign-born high-tech entrepreneurs. Although there is no cap on the number of O-1A visas awarded, foreign-born scientists have largely ignored this option because it wasn't clear what metrics USCIS would use to assess their application. The 2022 guidance on O-1As removed that uncertainty by listing eight criteria -- including awards, peer-reviewed publications, and reviewing the work of other scientistsâ\"and stipulating that applicants need to satisfy at least three of them. The second visa policy change affects those with advanced STEM degrees seeking the national interest waiver for an EB-2. Under the normal process of obtaining such a visa, the Department of Labor requires employers to first satisfy rules meant to protect U.S. workers from foreign competition, for example, by showing that the company has failed to find a qualified domestic worker and that the job will pay the prevailing wage. That time-consuming exercise can be waived if visa applicants can prove they are doing \"exceptional\" work of \"substantial merit and national importance.\" But once again, the standard for determining whether the labor-force requirements can be waived was vague, so relatively few STEM workers chose that route. The 2022 USCIS guidance not only specifies criteria, which closely track those for the nonimmigrant, O-1A visa, but also allows scientists to sponsor themselves.",

    "text": "Heavy wind and rain led to more than 22,000 potholes needing to be repaired An extra £4.8m is set to be spent repairing Nottinghamshire&#039;s roads following one of the wettest winters in recent memory. Highways across the county were badly damaged in the wake of flooding caused by Storm Babet in October and Storm Henk in January. More than 22,000 potholes had to be repaired in the county between October 2023 and March 2024 – three times the number for the same period the previous winter. Insurance claims against the county council also doubled to more than 2,300. &#039;Severely tested&#039; Storm Babet in October 2023 saw 124mm of rain fall on Nottinghamshire in just three days, while another 75mm fell during Storm Henk in December. Rainfall between 1 October and 4 January was 170% more than the long term average. Both storms caused widespread disruption, with dozens of roads closed and more than 1,600 homes and businesses flooded. Under the new proposals two extra teams would be set up to deal with serious potholes and road problems, along with seven large-scale patching schemes to target problem areas, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The money is in addition to the council’s approved £33m highways budget for this financial year. The work will be carried out by Via, the council-owned company responsible for highway maintenance. “Via’s capacity to both respond to the storm events and also tackle the damage to the network was severely tested,” a report going before Nottinghamshire County Council&#039;s cabinet said. “Whilst extra resources were put in place at the beginning of the winter to continue with follow up repairs to Category 1 defects [the most serious non-emergency potholes], there was a need to temporarily increase the amount of safety repairs with follow-up repairs being planned for 24/25.” The council&#039;s cabinet will consider the plans on 25 July.

    "text": "Southern University, the alma mater of such jazz greats as Alvin Batiste, Branford Marsalis and Donald Harrison, has launched a new recording studio centered around a Solid State Logic Duality Pro-Station SuperAnalogue™ 48-channel mixing console. The new facility will support two new Bachelor of Music and Bachelor of Digital Media Arts programs that focus on music technology and recording arts, starting in fall 2024 and fall 2025, respectively.\nRick Camp, owner of Las Vegas-based RC1 Productions & Designs, notes that the project, conceived as a stereo studio, was delayed by the pandemic. He was never in doubt about the choice of console, he says: “The Duality is the most common and widely used console in professional studios around the world.” But by the time construction began, Apple Music’s Spatial Audio platform had launched and demand for Dolby Atmos music was exploding. “So I went back to Southern University and said, ‘You'll be behind the times if I just make this a stereo studio. We really need to bump this up and make it a 7.1.4 studio.”\nTo that end, Camp designed and integrated a custom immersive production and mixing solution for the Duality Pro-Station that combines the console’s functionality with a Pro Tools system and third-party, Dante-enabled converters, speaker optimization and monitor management hardware components. Camp’s technical design for the room includes a Genelec 7.1.4 speaker system plus George Augspurger-designed and manufactured soffited main monitors. A credenza is well stocked with high-end compressor, limiter, reverb and microphone preamp options. WSDG Walters-Storyk Design Group provided the control room’s acoustic design and construction.",
