Unfortunately for one family living north of Atlanta, that’s not the case. Their daughter’s 2022 Honda Civic is melting, WSB-TV reports .\nAccording to Charles Goldberg, his daughter’s side-view mirrors, bumper and other trim pieces began to warp, and bubbles appeared in the paint. “It’s as if someone shot a ray gun at our car,” he told the news outlet, adding, “I’d never seen anything like it. It was also warped and started melting and disintegrating.”\nRead more\nADVERTISEMENT Rebel Moon's Ed Skrein on Co-Starring With His Game of Thrones Replacement\nThe Best RPGs Of 2023\nThe State Of The Nintendo Switch In 2023\nGypsy Rose Blanchard has been released from prison and hopes to meet Taylor Swift\nChinese Chess Champ Stripped Of Title After Taking A Dump In A Bathtub\nThe Goldbergs, however, don’t sound particularly happy with that explanation and have reportedly filed a complaint with Honda corporate. Unfortunately for them, while a quick search for “melting Honda” turns up a number of forum results, if you dig a little deeper, Honda owners aren’t the only ones dealing with similar issues. Still, considering how many complaints there are about melting Hondas, you have to wonder if it could change the type of exterior plastics it uses to make melting less likely to happen.\nMore from Jalopnik\nThe Best Movies You May Have Missed in 2023, and Where to Stream Them\nResearchers Uncover the ‘Most Sophisticated’ iPhone Exploit Ever\nXbox Slammed For AI-Generated Art Promoting Indie Games\nWegovy and Other New Weight Loss Drugs Actually Work—so What's Next?\nIDIOT OF THE YEAR: It's the final countdown (Nos. 10-1)\nSign up for Jalopnik's Newsletter.

    "text": "Secciones\nServicios\nDestacamos\nEdición\n«Recordemos que Satanás a los primeros en atacar son a nuestros amados y queridos sacerdotes y religiosos», justifican los defensores de la orden religiosa ... el Instituto del Verbo Encarnado, que opera desde 2010 en la parroquia del Santo Ángel Custodio del Zaidín. Esta congregación, tal y como adelantó IDEAL, está siendo investigada por el Vaticano, al igual que por el Arzobispado de Granada por presuntas irregularidades. El caso está bajo secreto y el expediente ya se ha remitido a la Santa Sede. Los feligreses denuncian presuntos exorcismos, ritos esotéricos y manejo indebido del dinero de los fieles, entre otras cuestiones.\nSin embargo, que los medios de comunicación y la misma iglesia haya puesto el foco en el IVE no ha sentado bien a sus defensores mas acérrimos. La parroquia está dividida y algunas de las personas que han denunciado estos hechos se sienten atacadas. Los devotos que defienden al IVE han mandado por redes sociales un comunicado donde defienden al vicario parroquial, trasladado en julio por la propia orden y sobre el que recaen la mayoría de las denuncias, y a otros sacerdotes. «Nunca se debe censurar al sacerdote; aún, cuando se piense que es culpable de algún error», «cuando un Sacerdote cae, se le debe extender la mano a través de la oración» o «si ves a un Sacerdote celebrar la Santa Misa indignamente, nunca debes decir nada a nadie», son algunas de las frases que acunan sus defensores. Por ahora, la investigación se queda en el seno de la Santa Sede. Fiscalía no ha registrado denuncias por la via judicial.\n¿Ya eres suscriptor/a?

Cornbread is blind due to a double merle gene, which can cause blindness and hearing impairment, but that hasn't stopped him from exploring and playing. Cornbread enjoys chewing things and likes having toys to play with. He can be unsure of new places at first, but with the help of treats and patience, he adjusts to his surroundings well. He would do best in a home that has had blind dogs before or one that is willing to work with him on verbal commands.

    "title": "Cummins takes 10 wickets to lead Australia to Pakistan series triumph - Top World News Today",
    "text": "A fired-up Pat Cummins bagged five wickets and 10 in the match to earn Australia a nail-biting 79-run win in the second Test. Australia captain Pat Cummins took 10 wickets in a masterclass of clutch bowling to end stout Pakistan resistance and lead his side to a 79-run victory on the fourth day of the second test, locking up the three-match series 2-0. Just when it looked like the Boxing Day test would go down to the wire on the final day, the paceman stepped in to remove Mohammad Rizwan, Pakistan’s last recognised batsman, and claim his 250th test wicket on Friday. Cummins (5-49) followed that up with the wicket of Aamer Jamal for a duck to trigger an extra half an hour of play, during which he claimed his fifth wicket of the innings and 10th of the match to help mop up the tail. It was his second 10-wicket match haul in 57 tests and concluded a glorious year in which he led Australia to the World Test Championship, a 50-overs World Cup triumph and the retention of the Ashes in England. “Crazy year. Lots of cricket, lots of success on the field,” said Cummins, who was named Man of the Match. “I think we’re going to look back and remember 2023 as one of the special ones.” Set an imposing victory target of 317 runs after bowling Australia out for 262 before lunch, the tourists had put together a series of partnerships that frustrated the potent Australian attack. There were some home nerves when the last substantial stand of 57 between Rizwan (35) and Agha Salman (50) got the target under 100 runs but the match turned for good when Cummins separated the pair. Pakistan had threatened to take control of the match on several occasions over the first four days only to let the Australians off the hook. Fired by an innings of 96 from Mitchell Marsh, Australia had dragged themselves back from 16-4 after lunch on Thursday and resumed on 187-6 on a sunny morning at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Wicketkeeper Alex Carey scored 52 to help extend the lead before he was trapped leg before by seamer Mir Hamza (4-32) to bring an end to the innings. Pakistan were always going to be up against it given the fact that only one team had successfully chased more than 300 runs in the fourth innings in 146 years of test matches at the MCG. The tourists were dismissed for 89 in the fourth innings when Australia won the first test by 360 runs in Perth and the early indications were that Melbourne would witness something similar. Abdullah Shafique, whose dropped slip catches in both innings proved so costly to Pakistan, departed for four before lunch when he lunged at a Mitchell Starc delivery and Usman Khawaja took the catch in the cordon. Cummins trapped Imam-Ul-Haq in front for 12 soon after the resumption but a 61-run partnership between Shan Masood and Babar Azam stalled Australia’s progress. Again, Cummins made the breakthrough by inducing Masood into an edge which Steve Smith claimed in the slips with the Pakistan captain on 60. Azam continued to keep the scoreboard ticking over but Australia’s bowlers remained patient as they targeted the top of his off stump and Josh Hazlewood got the reward when he nipped one back to bowl the Pakistan danger man for 41. Pakistan started putting together another partnership but it was worth only 16 runs when Starc (4-55) sent down a delivery that grew big on Saud Shakeel, who top-edged it behind to Carey for 24 with Pakistan still 155 runs from their target. Masood was remarkably upbeat considering his team came so close to ending a 15-match losing streak in Australia going back to 1995. “In terms of the bigger picture, this is the way we want to play test cricket,” said the 34-year-old, whose team will get another chance to snap that streak in the third test in Sydney next week. “Playing test cricket in these conditions, fighting until the end and where a result is possible for us. I think that’s something we have to take forward as a team.” Indian cricket in 2023 scaled new heights as the domestic system continued to find talent across the country. There were several firsts and records broken as we MOUNT MAUNGANUI: Heavy rain forced the second of three Twenty20 internationals between hosts New Zealand and Bangladesh to be called off Friday, with the home t Pakistan coach Mohammad Hafeez has blown up and accused technology of “putting a curse on this beautiful game” following a match-defining DRS decision in th “When teams I’ve been a part of are at their best, you find a way to win,” Cummins said afterwards.“You can play poorly for a lot of it or a lot of guys",

    "text": "Les températures mondiales se maintiennent toujours au-dessus d'1,5°C de réchauffement\nParis (AFP) - Les températures mondiales sont restées à des niveaux historiquement élevés en avril, poursuivant une série de près de deux ans de chaleur inédite sur la planète qui agite le milieu scientifique sur la vitesse du réchauffement climatique.\nAu niveau mondial, avril 2025 se classe deuxième plus chaud derrière avril 2024, selon l'observatoire européen Copernicus, qui se fonde sur des milliards de mesures issues de satellites, stations météo et autres outils.\nLe mois dernier prolonge ainsi une série ininterrompue de records ou quasi-records de températures qui dure depuis juillet 2023, soit bientôt deux ans.\nDepuis lors, à une exception près, tous les mois ont été au moins 1,5°C plus chauds que la moyenne de l'ère préindustrielle (1850-1900).\nDe nombreux scientifiques s'attendaient pourtant à ce que la période 2023-2024 -- les deux années les plus chaudes jamais mesurées dans le monde -- soit suivie d'un répit, lorsque les conditions plus chaudes du phénomène El Nino s'estomperaient.\n\"Avec 2025, cela aurait dû se tasser, mais au lieu de cela, nous restons dans cette phase de réchauffement accéléré\", a déclaré Johan Rockström, directeur en Allemagne de l'Institut de Potsdam sur l'impact du climat.\n\"Il semble que nous y soyons coincés\" et \"ce qui l'explique n'est pas entièrement résolu, mais c'est un signe très inquiétant\", a-t-il déclaré à l'AFP.\nLes deux dernières années \"ont été exceptionnelles\", dit à l'AFP Samantha Burgess, du centre européen qui opère Copernicus.\"Elles restent dans la fourchette de ce que les modèles climatiques prédisaient pour aujourd'hui, mais on est dans le haut de la fourchette\".\nUne des explications repose sur le fait que le phénomène La Nina, inverse d'El Nino et synonyme d'influence rafraîchissante, n'est finalement que de \"faible intensité\" depuis décembre, selon l'Organisation météorologique mondiale, et pourrait déjà décliner dans les prochains mois.\n- Déjà presque 1,4°C -\nUne cinquantaine de climatologues réputés, conduits par le britannique Piers Forster, estiment que le climat était déjà réchauffé en moyenne de 1,36°C en 2024.C'est la conclusion d'une version préliminaire de leur étude qui actualise chaque année les chiffres clés du Giec, les experts du climat mandatés par l'ONU.Copernicus a une estimation actuelle très proche, de 1,39°C.\nLe seuil de 1,5°C de réchauffement, le plus ambitieux de l'accord de Paris, est sur le point d'être atteint de façon stabilisée, calculée sur plusieurs décennies, estiment nombre de scientifiques.Copernicus pense que cela pourra être le cas d'ici 2029.\n\"C'est dans quatre ans.La réalité est que nous allons dépasser 1,5°C\", dit Samantha Burgess.\n\"Au rythme actuel, le 1.5°C sera battu avant 2030\", estime aussi Julien Cattiaux, climatologue du CNRS joint par l'AFP.\"On dit que chaque dixième de degré compte\", car il multiplie les sécheresses, canicules et autres catastrophes météorologiques \"mais actuellement, ils défilent vite\", s'alarme le scientifique.\nMais \"maintenant, ce qu'il faut essayer de faire, c'est d'avoir un réchauffement climatique le plus proche possible\" de la cible initiale car \"ce n'est pas pareil si on vise un climat réchauffé de 2°C en fin de siècle ou de 4°C\", rappelle-t-il.\nQue la combustion des énergies fossiles - charbon, pétrole et gaz - soit responsable de l'essentiel du réchauffement ne fait pas débat parmi les climatologues.\nMais les discussions et les études se multiplient pour quantifier l'influence climatique de l'évolution des nuages, d'une baisse de la pollution atmosphérique ou de celle des capacités de la Terre à stocker le carbone dans des puits naturels tels que les forêts et les océans.\nLes relevés annuels de températures mondiales remontent jusqu'en 1850.Mais les carottes de glace, les sédiments au fond de l'océan et d'autres \"archives climatiques\" permettent d'établir que le climat actuel est sans précédent depuis au moins 120.000 ans.",

    "text": "News PressBee .. News room odisha Watch the post from Delhi enveloped in thick fog as temperatures plunge; air quality deteriorates, Now to the details\nNew Delhi: Delhi woke up to a thick blanket of fog on Friday, with temperatures dropping to a minimum of 8 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality deteriorated further, recording an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 318 in the “very poor” category, as the Central Pollution Control Board resumed data updates after a day-long pause.\nThe maximum and minimum temperatures are forecasted to be 17 degrees Celsius and 8 degrees Celsius, respectively.\nVisibility conditions worsened significantly at 6 am, leading authorities to take action to ensure safety. Flights that lack the necessary equipment for low-visibility landings, especially those not adhering to CAT III standards, are expected to experience delays or cancellations.\nThe Safdarjung weather station considered the benchmark for Delhi’s climate, recorded a maximum temperature of 16.2 degrees Celcius earlier on Thursday, slightly up from 15 degrees Celcius the previous day but still three degrees below the normal mark.\nAccording to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), “cold day” conditions are declared when the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees Celcius or more below normal, provided the minimum temperature is below 10 degrees Celcius. While Safdarjung didn’t meet the criteria, the Palam, Najafgarh, Pusa, and Narela weather stations reported “cold day” conditions.\nRelief, however, appears to be on the horizon as the IMD predicts a slight increase in temperatures over the coming days due to the influence of a fresh western disturbance. The maximum temperature in Delhi is expected to hover around 17 degrees Celcius on Friday and rise to 18 degrees Celcius by Saturday. “A marginal increase of about one degree in maximum temperatures is anticipated across most parts of the region,” an IMD official noted.\nEarlier on Thursday, Delhi witnessed dense fog, with temperatures plunging to 10 degrees Celcius at 5:30 a.m. Reduced visibility caused potential disruptions at the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport.\nRunway visibility ranged between 200 to 500 meters, while general visibility dropped to zero around 6 a.m. Flights equipped with low-visibility systems managed to land, but others faced delays and diversions.\n–IANS\nDelhi enveloped in thick fog as temperatures plunge; air quality deteriorates News Room Odisha.\ndelhi enveloped in thick fog as temperatures plunge air quality deteriorates\nPlease note that the original topic has been published and is available on News room odisha the editing team at PressBee have verified it and it may have been partially modified or quoted from it.

    "text": "12 человек утонули с начала купального сезона в Акмолинской области\n12 человек утонули с начала купального сезона в Акмолинской области. Такую печальную статистику озвучил начальник управления гражданской обороны ДЧС Акмолинской области Бахыт Абланов, передает корреспондент агентства Kazinfom.\nПо словам спикера, ежегодно на водоемах области фиксируется гибель до 20 человек, наибольшее количество несчастных случаев приходится именно на период купального сезона.\n— За последние три года в купальный период погиб 51 человек, из которых 19 несовершеннолетних. В этом году с начала купального сезона уже погибли по области 12 человек, среди которых был один несовершеннолетний. Основными причинами гибели людей является купание в состоянии алкогольного опьянения, оставление детей без присмотра взрослых, недооценка собственных сил и неумение плавать, а также купание в несанкционированных и необорудованных местах, — отметил Бахыт Абланов.\nМежду тем, на территории области официально функционируют 69 пляжей. Кроме того, для обучения детей организованы специальные места на акваториях, так называемые лягушатники, где детей учат навыкам плаванья.\nСпасатель отметил, что за безопасностью на водоемах региона следят 99 спасателей. В их распоряжении находятся 20 единиц техники и 32 плавательных средства. Совместно с местными исполнительными органами и правоохранительными структурами регулярно проводятся профилактические рейды. Их было проведено уже около 500. При этом к административной ответственности привлечены 47 жителей области за нарушение или невыполнение правил безопасности на водоемах.\nСпасатель напомнил акмолинцам основные правила безопасности на воде и призвал соблюдать меры предосторожности.\nРанее сообщалось, что в Туркестанской области утонули 5 человек, трое из них — дети.",
