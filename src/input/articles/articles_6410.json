    "text": "A mum-of-two is one step closer to being Australia's first female astronaut. [Australian Space Agency](/story/8449301/) employee Katherine Bennell-Pegg announced she was halfway through her year-long training at the European Astronaut Centre in Germany. While other Australian women have trained to go to space, they've always done so under the flags of other countries. Ms Bennell-Beg and her family relocated to Europe for the intensive training process. More than 22,000 people applied to the coveted position in hopes of becoming an astronaut candidate. The job requires rigorous physical training, as well as a year of intensive study. \"I have always dreamed of being an astronaut,\" she said. \"When I was young, it was for the adventure but after more than a decade working in space it's now because I know the role it plays in tackling real-world problems.\" The next six months are expected to include intense exercise, sea survival, studying space station robotic arm simulations and centrifuge training. \"We need to know the basics around medical procedures - not just in case something goes wrong, but because astronauts are basically medical guinea pigs,\" she told the [ Australian Space Agency](/story/8338233/). \"In space, as your body adapts to weightlessness any medical issues you may have on Earth - such as osteoporosis, or muscle degradation - are put on fast forward and we can support research on that.\" The Adelaide-born astronaut candidate previously served as Director of Space Technology at the Australian Space Agency, and as part of the space robotics and automation team. In early December, Ms Bennell-Pegg travelled to the United States where she underwent specialised training with NASA in Houston and met with Australian Ambassador to the United States Kevin Rudd in Washington DC. \"I'm excited - not just for me - but for what my training and experience can unlock for Australian scientists, engineers and operators, and all the value that can bring,\" she said.

    "title": "\"Don't Be Ashamed Of Negotiating\": Pope Appeals Ukraine To End War With Russia",
    "text": "Pope Francis said: \"Negotiating is never a surrender\" (File) Pope Francis has said in an interview that Ukraine should have what he called the courage of the \"white flag\" and negotiate an end to the war with Russia that followed Moscow's full-scale invasion two years ago and that has killed tens of thousands. Francis made his comments in an interview recorded last month with Swiss broadcaster RSI, well before Friday's latest offer by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to host a summit between Ukraine and Russia to end the war. Erdogan made the fresh offer after a meeting in Istanbul with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy has said while he wants peace he will not give up any territory. The Ukrainian leader's own peace plan calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops from all of Ukraine and the restoration of its state borders. The Kremlin has ruled out engaging in peace talks on terms set by Kyiv. A spokesman for Zelenskiy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the pope's remarks. In the interview Francis was asked for his position on a debate between those who say Ukraine should give up as it has not been able to repel Russian forces, and those who say doing so would legitimise actions by the strongest party. The interviewer used the term \"white flag\" in the question. \"It is one interpretation, that is true,\" Francis said, according to an advance transcript of the interview and a partial video made available to Reuters on Saturday. It is due to be broadcast on March 20 as part of a new cultural programme. \"But I think that the strongest one is the one who looks at the situation, thinks about the people and has the courage of the white flag, and negotiates,\" Francis said, adding that talks should take place with the help of international powers. \"The word negotiate is a courageous word. When you see that you are defeated, that things are not going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate,\" Francis said. It was believed to be the first time Francis has used terms such as \"white flag\" or \"defeated\" in discussing the Ukraine war, although he has spoken in the past about the need for negotiations. Last year the 87-year-old pope sent a peace envoy, Italian Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, to Kyiv, Moscow and Washington to sound out leaders in those countries. \"One may feel shame,\" Francis said about negotiating, \"but how many dead will it (the war) end up with? (One should) negotiate in time, find a country that can be a mediator,\" Francis said, mentioning Turkey among the countries that had offered. \"Do not be ashamed of negotiating, before things get worse,\" said Francis, who has made hundreds of appeals for what he calls \"martyred Ukraine\". Asked if he was willing to mediate, Francis said \"I am here\". In another part of the interview, speaking of the war between Israel and Hamas, Francis said: \"Negotiating is never a surrender\". Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Last month Zelenskiy said that 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the Russian invasion in February 2022 and that tens of thousands of civilians had been killed in the occupied areas of the country.

    "title": "\"Non ci sarà il diritto al suicidio: la vita è sacra\"",
    "text": "Mariastella Gelmini, senatrice di Noi Moderati, è iniziato l'iter della legge sul fine vita. Quali sono i punti chiave e cosa la distingue dalla sentenza della Corte del 2019?\n\"Il testo della maggioranza è aderente alla sentenza della Corte e vuole anche porre fine alla legislazione arlecchino di alcune regioni. Le critiche sono in larga parte strumentali. Si chiarisce che non esiste un diritto al suicidio e si ribadisce il principio dell'indisponibilità della vita, ma c'è una casistica - precisa e limitata - entro la quale la collaborazione al suicidio è depenalizzata. E le condizioni previste sono coerenti con le indicazioni della Consulta. Bisogna aver cura e rispetto della vita, sacra e inviolabile. Come diceva Papa Francesco, no alla cultura dello scarto\".\nUno dei passaggi più controversi riguarda il ruolo del Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, che non potrà impiegare mezzi o personale per agevolare il fine vita. Qual è il motivo di questa scelta?\n\"Il Ssn è vocato alla tutela della vita, all'assistenza dei pazienti e alle cure palliative nei casi più gravi. Stiamo parlando di una procedura eccezionale che verrà depenalizzata in casi specifici che non può essere richiesta a un medico del servizio nazionale che, peraltro, potrebbe ricorrere all'obiezione di coscienza: nessuno può essere costretto a un atto che potrebbe essere valutato reato\".\nNel testo si parla di cure palliative obbligatoriamente offerte prima dell'accesso al suicidio assistito, ma in molte Regioni sono ancora carenti.\n\"È un punto cruciale. Le cure palliative sono nel nostro ordinamento dal 2010, ma alcune regioni sono in ritardo. Con questa norma abbiamo chiarito che, se le regioni non provvedono, si nomina un commissario ad acta\".\nL'introduzione del Comitato nazionale di valutazione con tempi di ricorso fino a 180 giorni non rischia di allungare molto il percorso per chi chiede l'accesso al suicidio assistito?\n\"I tempi ordinari previsti sono di sessanta giorni, un periodo congruo per una decisione di grande delicatezza. Ci possono essere casi che richiedono approfondimenti e mi sembra doveroso che siano fatti: non siamo di fronte a una formalità burocratica\".\nChe tempi di approvazione prevede?\n\"Ci sono le condizioni perché\nal Senato si possa concludere l'iter prima della pausa estiva. Poi alla Camera spero che i tempi possano essere contenuti e, come ha sottolineato anche Maurizio Lupi, l'importante è arrivare in fondo con una buona legge\".\nnetiquette.\nQuile norme di comportamento per esteso.",
