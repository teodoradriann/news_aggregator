    "text": "[United Kingdom](../)\nMarco Silva: Fulham manager’s reputation enhanced by historic Chelsea win\nHe has been the beneficiary of finally putting down roots at a club, allowing his coaching prowess – recognised throughout his career – the time to take effect.\nHe was highly-regarded at Hull City, even though his five-month spell from January to May 2017 ended in relegation.\nSilva made an impressive start after being appointed Watford manager, but his head was turned when approached by Everton in November, following the sacking of Ronald Koeman. The advances were rejected amid acrimony but Watford’s form went into decline.\nBefore Everton’s approach, Watford only lost four out of 11 games but afterwards they suffered defeat in eight of the next 13. Silva was sacked in January.\nWatford pointed the finger of blame firmly in Everton’s direction in their statement, at the time, saying: “The catalyst is that approach, something which the board believes has seen a significant deterioration in both focus and results to the point where the long-term future of Watford has been jeopardised.”\nEverton eventually got their man in summer 2018, but cast him aside 18 months later before Silva’s managerial journey took him to Craven Cottage.\nSilva now looks and sounds like a different man.\nAnd this win at Chelsea was a coaching masterclass as he revealed how it was planned.\nHe said: “We knew Neto would push up on Chelsea’s right so we wanted to expose those spaces. This was our plan and we did it better in the second half with Antonee Robinson and pushing on.\n“We wanted to expose that area in the way we prepared then get more bodies in the box in the second half, which we did and got our goals. If people think we deserved to win this match then I would agree with them.”\nFulham’s fans have come to idolise their manager, as proved by the wild outpouring of joy at the final whistle – and the feeling is mutual.\nHe said: “Football is about connections. Connections between fans, players and staff, means something really big. The most important thing is for the fans. It’s not about me at all.\n“Some of the speeches before the game were about the fans. It’s been a long time [not winning at their neighbours]. We deserved it. We controlled more of the game. We didn’t give them chances.\n“In the second half we started to make better decisions. All the good actions of the game give us confidence.”\nSilva’s connection with Fulham and the club’s fans looks unbreakable – and he appears to be a manager who has finally found a home.\n[World News](/)||\n[Latest News](/news)||\n[U.S. News](../../us-news)\n[Source link](//www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn54gpv6wz1o)",

    "text": "(AOF) - L’Association française de la gestion financière et le cabinet ELABE ont mené une enquête sur les connaissances financières des Français, leur épargne et leurs attentes en matière d’investissement. Parmi les enseignements à tirer de cette étude : une faible connaissance financière est un facteur d’inégalité et un frein à l’investissement à long terme. En effet, 70 % des sondés estiment avoir une faible éducation financière qui entraîne une limitation dans leur capacité à optimiser leurs placements et à adopter une stratégie d’investissement adaptée à leurs besoins.\nÀ l'inverse, ils sont peu nombreux (13 % des Français) à adopter tous les bons réflexes pour limiter les risques et optimiser leurs placements.\nEn revanche, plus de la moitié (60 %) pense qu'il est utile ou prioritaire que leur épargne contribue au financement des entreprises françaises et européennes, une manière de soutenir l'économie et l'emploi. Toutefois, ils estiment que ce soutien à l'économie européenne devrait leur permettre de bénéficier d'une fiscalité plus avantageuse.\nEnfin, s'ils sont nombreux à penser que leurs connaissances sont limitées, 65 % des Français, et même 80 % des 18-24 ans, sont favorables à la diffusion de l'éducation financière à l'école. Pour chercher de l'information, ils souhaitent profiter d'outils numériques pédagogiques, notamment pour les plus jeunes générations. Ainsi, 66 % des 18-24 ans plébiscitent les formats modernes et interactifs (vidéos, tutoriels, applications mobiles…). La confiance des Français va à leur banque ou aux professionnels agréés, à leur entourage familial ou amical, ou encore aux autorités publiques.",

Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: \"This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I'm grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.\" You may also like Read more from UK News National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a \"localised tornado\" in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours' houses \"are an absolute disaster\" with missing roofs and \"squished\" cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: \"Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.\"",
