    "text": "Sarah Richards and staff Locals have gathered across the country to mark Good Friday this Easter long weekend. From special church services, to family days out in the sun, and seafood-rich dishes — here's how you're spending the public holiday. 'Blessed' churchgoers gather in Brisbane In Brisbane, dozens of churchgoers at EFKS Southwest Brisbane dressed in white and gathered at the Samoan Church to celebrate Good Friday. In Samoan culture, traditionally, white is worn during the Easter period. \"For us, white represents a new life in our culture; it's such a significant day, so we wear white clothes,\" churchgoer Vao said. The Queensland service consisted of hymns, singing and prayer. Rosie Alaalatoa, who attended the service, said it was a \"blessing\" to embrace culture and language. \"It's a special day for all of us in the Samoan community; we come together and worship, and we're able to see each other,\" she said. \"This is a beautiful day for the islanders.\" Anglican Church Southern Queensland Archbishop Jeremy Greaves said in his Good Friday message, \"no matter how desperate things seem, it does get better\". \"Love will endure. Hope will win out,\" he said. Archbishop Greaves said he hoped people could use the Easter break to find strength, hope and courage to \"sing alleluia\" in the face of \"the darkness of the world\". Calls for harmony in Sydney At the St Patrick's Cathedral in Western Sydney, hundreds gathered to pray through the Stations of the Cross, marking the different phases of Jesus's life and death. Bishop Vincent Long led the procession. He began with an Easter message calling for harmony in the Israel-Gaza war, which has been front-of-mind for many in the local community. Pilgrimage across Melbourne Melbourne Christians also marked Good Friday, by participated in the annual Way of the Cross walk. Hundreds began the walk at one of Melbourne's oldest churches, St Francis on Lonsdale Street, and concluded at St Paul's Cathedral on Flinders Street. The walk takes Christians of different denominations on a journey through Melbourne's city centre, stopping at many of the city's historic churches to share reflections, songs, and prayers. The annual pilgrimage has been running since 1998. It passes from church to church, commemorating Jesus's journey from the Last Supper to the crucifixion and resurrection. Followers were invited to continue the walk when it resumed early on Easter Sunday. Easter egg hunt in Hobart Meanwhile, Tasmanians marked Good Friday with an Easter egg hunt for the kids. Around 2,000 children and their parents took part in the annual egg hunt and family picnic at the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens. Clues to find a special chocolate Easter egg surprise were hidden throughout the gardens. It is the 12th year the event has been hosted, which raises funds for medical research across Tasmania. Seafood spreads in Perth Over in Western Australia, many are eagerly lining up at the fish markets to score a fresh catch for their Good Friday feast. Richard Karagania's religious background means it's important to him and his wife — who is Catholic — to avoid red meat on Good Friday, so he was at the fish market bright and early on Friday. \"It's all very nice, a tomatoey fish stew,\" he said of the fish fillet and extra-large prawns he was picking up. \"But also it's a nice time of the year to sit outside and have a seafood meal.\" Third-generation fishmonger Matt Kailis said the most important thing is to look for this Good Friday is local produce. \"We've got all variety of fish to suit basically any budget and any cooking style,\" he said. \"Traditionally people might have just bought their snapper, but they're trying a lot of different species of fish, they're more adventurous in their cooking.\"",

    "text": "Tennessee Aquarium IMAX Theater Hosts Sensory-Friendly Screenings This Spring\nChattanooga, TN – (WDEF)The Tennessee Aquarium IMAX Theater is making movie magic more inclusive this spring with special sensory-friendly screenings designed for guests with sensory processing needs.\nThe first film, Call of the Dolphins, will be shown on Saturday, April 26. The second, Elephants: Giants of the Desert, follows on Saturday, May 31. Both screenings begin at 10:30 a.m.\nThese screenings offer a welcoming environment for anyone who may benefit from sensory accommodations. The theater will lower the volume, dim the lights, and reduce overall capacity to create a more relaxed, judgment-free experience.\n“Anyone who can benefit from accommodations for sensory sensitivity is welcome,” said Mara-Lynne Payne, Director of Inclusion, Equity and Diversity. “A lot of times, theaters can feel overwhelming. So we make adjustments—lowering the lights, turning down the volume, and limiting capacity so people can move around freely or vocalize if they need to, without any judgment.”\nSensory support items like noise-canceling headphones, weighted lap pads, and fidget tools will be available for guests. For those needing a break during the film, quiet areas—including the IMAX Theater’s peaceful garden—will also be open.\nSensory-friendly screenings are set for April 26 and May 31.\nTo learn more or reserve tickets, visit the Tennessee\nAquarium’s website.",

    "text": "Woodside has signed LNG sale and purchase agreements with Uniper for the supply of 1.0 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) from Louisiana LNG LLC and up to 1.0 Mtpa from its global portfolio (Woodside Energy Trading Singapore Pty. Ltd.), demonstrating ongoing strong demand for LNG globally.\nWoodside CEO Meg O’Neill said these agreements represent another important milestone to move Louisiana LNG towards a final investment decision.\n“We are delighted to advance our longstanding relationship with Uniper through these milestone supply agreements. Uniper’s commitment speaks volumes about Woodside’s track record as a trusted LNG provider, built on decades of delivering reliable and flexible supply solutions for our global partners.\n“Louisiana LNG is Woodside’s largest growth project. It leverages the robust US gas resource, an outstanding site, best-in-class EPC and technology partners and Woodside’s track record of successful project delivery. The addition of Atlantic Basin LNG supply to our established position in the Pacific strengthens Woodside’s portfolio and allows us to tailor contract structures based on various price indices and tenures to better meet our customers’ diverse needs.\n“As we continue to progress sell-down opportunities for Louisiana LNG, these agreements reinforce the project’s unique advantages and its economic competitiveness.\n“Uniper’s leadership in European energy markets make them an ideal counterparty, and this builds on Woodside’s existing offtake arrangements, underscoring our shared commitment to delivering value for all companies and the economies in which each operate.\n“In an environment of increasing demand for dependable sources of LNG, particularly in Europe, we remain focused on delivering reliable energy supply that will benefit our partners and stakeholders for years to come,” she said.\nMichael Lewis, Uniper CEO said, “We are very pleased to secure additional LNG supplies for our customers in Europe from a reliable LNG supplier like Woodside. This deal will support our security of supply and flexible generation strategy together with the potential development of additional gas-fired power plants in Germany to complement the renewable build-up. Woodside is one of our biggest LNG suppliers globally with a solid track record of deliveries of LNG to us from their existing projects.\n“With this new project in Louisiana, we are further extending the cooperation with Woodside. Long-term LNG contracts like this contribute directly to the competitiveness of European industry. Reliable and cost-effective energy supply is a cornerstone of a strong industrial base, and deals like this help ensure our customers can count on both.”\nLouisiana LNG LLC will supply 1.0 Mtpa of LNG on a free-on-board basis for up to thirteen years from the commercial operations date (COD) of Louisiana LNG.\nIn addition, Woodside Energy Trading Singapore Pty. Ltd. will supply up to 1.0 Mtpa of LNG on a delivered ex-ship basis from Woodside’s global portfolio into Europe commencing with Louisiana LNG’s COD over a term until 2039.\nThe sale and purchase agreements are subject to Woodside’s final investment decision on the three train 16.5 Mtpa foundation development of Louisiana LNG.\nAbout Woodside\nWoodside is a global energy company providing reliable and affordable energy to help people lead better lives. We leverage our track record of world-class project execution and operational excellence as we build a diverse global portfolio to meet the world’s growing energy needs.\nWe have over 35 years of experience in the LNG industry including pioneering Australia's LNG industry as operator of the North West Shelf Project where we shipped our first LNG cargo to Japan in 1989. We are executing major projects today, while pursuing growth opportunities that will deliver long-term value for our shareholders.

    "text": "Baseball has no shortage of unwritten rules, but among the most important is “don’t give the opposing team extra outs.” The Philadelphia Phillies are a championship contender, but Wednesday they broke that rule and paid for it dearly. Leading the Red Sox by five runs in the top of the fifth, the Phillies should have gotten out of the inning unscathed when Rob Refsnyder hit a sky high pop-up behind home plate for what would have been the third out of the inning. But Phillies catcher J.T. Realmuto lost the ball in the twilight, allowing it to fall harmlessly to the ground, and giving the Red Sox a second chance to capitalize on a bases-loaded opportunity. Within minutes, the Red Sox scored six runs to take the lead. The stunning rally and eventual 9-8 win over the Phillies in 11 innings on Wednesday began with two bases-loaded walks after the missed pop-up before Romy Gonzalez delivered a grand slam. Then, after Philadelphia tied the game in the eighth and 10th innings, Carlos Narvaez came through with a go-ahead two-run home run in the top of the 11th to help Boston pull out its first extra-innings win on the road this season. “Just stayed on top of the ball and the ball found barrel,” Narvaez told ESPN following the game. “Super happy that it was out of the ballpark.” In doing so, the Red Sox also averted what at one point was looking like a sure three-game sweep. Prior to the fifth-inning rally, the Phillies were in complete command. The top National League contenders had hit four home runs off Red Sox starting pitcher Lucas Giolito in the first four innings, including back-to-back jacks by Kyle Schwarber and Bryce Harper in the bottom of the first that put Philadelphia ahead 3-0 before the Red Sox had recorded an out. Harper’s home run was the 350th of his career, and Nick Castellanos and Bryson Stott followed up with solo shots in the third and fourth innings, respectively. Meanwhile, Phillies starter Jesus Luzardo was cruising and didn’t allow a hit until Masataka Yoshida came through with a double to start the fifth. Luzardo then walked Ceddanne Rafaela before getting a strikeout and a flyout, but walked Marcelo Mayer to load the bases. That’s when Refsnyder stepped to the plate, and when Realmuto lost his pop-up in the sky, everything fell apart for the Phillies. Refsnyder wound up walking to drive in Boston’s first run of the game, and Jarren Duran subsequently drew a four-pitch walk to make it 5-2. At that point Luzardo had walked three straight and four in the inning overall, but Phillies manager Rob Thomson left his starter in to face Gonzalez, who was 0 for his last 20 entering the at bat. It didn’t work out, as Gonzalez smoked a 1-1 change-up 415 feet into the left-field stands. Once they had the lead the Red Sox looked as if they were primed to close the deal. The club turned a double play to end the sixth and after Trea Turner doubled to put the tying run in scoring position with two outs in the seventh, Aroldis Chapman was summoned to face Schwarber and drew a flyout to end the threat on three pitches. But after returning for the eighth and making quick work of Harper and Castellanos, Chapman faced Realmuto and the catcher atoned for his earlier miscue by hitting a game-tying solo homer to straightaway center field. It was the first home run allowed by Chapman since May 7 and just the third he’d surrendered all season. Garrett Whitlock threw a scoreless ninth to force extras, and once in the 10th Story pulled a curveball down the left-field line to score the ghost runner, Duran. But the Phillies quickly answered in the bottom of the frame when Turner moved the ghost runner Stott to third on a flyout and Schwarber tied the game at 7-7 with an RBI single off Greg Weissert. The Red Sox got out of the inning without further incident after Narvaez caught pinch runner Weston Wilson stealing second, and the catcher came through again in the top of the 11th with his go-ahead two-run home run to left field. The Phillies got one run back against Jorge Alcala on a Johan Rojas RBI single, but Brennan Bernardino finished the job by striking out Max Kepler. Now the Red Sox return home after going 2-4 on the road trip coming out of the All-Star break, a gauntlet that saw the club measure themselves against two of baseball’s best teams. Things aren’t going to get any easier, as the Red Sox now welcome the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers to Fenway Park for a huge three-game series this weekend. “This one was big for us, we’re facing really good teams, postseason teams, so we’ve got to play good baseball,” Narvaez said. “The Dodgers are another good team, probably Shohei (Ohtani) is going to be on the mound, so we’ve got to be ready and that’s the kind of baseball we’re going to play going forward so if we want to play in October we’re going to face those guys.” Mayer leaves game Red Sox rookie Mayer was removed from the game in the bottom of the fifth, and shortly afterwards the club announced that he was dealing with right wrist discomfort. ©2025 The Boston Herald.

    "text": "En el Colegio Cabrillo, cerca de Santa Cruz, destaca Nikia Chaney. Puedes ver su cabello rosa brillante desde la distancia. También es la única profesora negra entre los 165 profesores titulares o titulares del colegio comunitario.\n“Cuando me contrataron por primera vez en 2019, no busqué la demografía de la escuela ni nada por el estilo. Estaba muy feliz de tener un trabajo de tiempo completo”, dijo. Pero después de llegar al campus, empezó a sentirse aislada. “No tienes profesores que se parezcan a ti”, dijo.\nLa Oficina del Canciller de los Colegios Comunitarios de California, la agencia que representa a los 116 colegios comunitarios del estado, quiere “que la composición de nuestro cuerpo docente y personal refleje la población estudiantil a la que servimos”, dijo la portavoz Melissa Villarin. Durante años, la oficina ha tratado de aumentar la diversidad mientras los legisladores estatales invertían dinero en intentos de soluciones.\nLa diversidad del profesorado ha aumentado ligeramente en los últimos 15 años, pero un informe que la oficina del canciller emitió en noviembre reconoció que “el progreso sigue siendo lento”.\nVillarín dijo que no hay una única explicación del por qué, pero que el problema muchas veces radica en el reclutamiento, la contratación y la retención. Por ejemplo, el sitio web de solicitud de empleo en colegios comunitarios está “obsoleto” y los paneles que seleccionan candidatos a menudo necesitan ser más diversos y estar mejor capacitados, dijo.\nEn una auditoría estatal separada publicada esta primavera, algunos distritos universitarios dijeron que es difícil encontrar profesores calificados cuando hay pocas personas en sus comunidades con los títulos de posgrado necesarios. En otros casos, según el informe, los profesores encuentran “puestos mejor remunerados en otros lugares”.\n“Este es un problema a nivel nacional. Cuando todo el mundo se concentra en tratar de diversificar su facultad, serán las universidades de Harvard y Yales las que le pagarán más”, dijo Olivia Cheche, asociada del programa de educación superior en el grupo de expertos sin fines de lucro New America.\nLa mayor discrepancia entre los colegios comunitarios de California se da entre los profesores latinos. Los estudiantes latinos representan casi la mitad de los estudiantes de los colegios comunitarios, pero menos del 20 por ciento de los profesores titulares o titulares son latinos. La misma disparidad se aplica a los administradores latinos.\nPara ayudar, los legisladores estatales y la oficina del canciller han introducido nuevas iniciativas de contratación y han invertido un estimado de 90 millones de dólares en reformas en los últimos 20 años. La mitad de ese dinero ha llegado en los últimos tres años. Pero la auditoría dijo que los distritos universitarios todavía tienen mucho camino por recorrer.\nHOSTILIDAD\nEn su primera reunión del departamento de inglés, una compañera de trabajo le entregó a Chaney un informe de 2018 sobre la diversidad en la universidad. “Los estudiantes afroamericanos experimentan Cabrillo College como un ambiente hostil y poco acogedor”, dice el informe, citando interacciones con otros estudiantes, profesores y administradores. Estos estudiantes también notaron una falta de representación en toda la escuela.\n“Hizo que mi corazón se hundiera”, dijo Chaney.\nNumerosos estudios muestran que un cuerpo docente más diverso beneficia a los estudiantes e incluso puede ayudar a cerrar las brechas de rendimiento entre los estudiantes blancos y los estudiantes de color. Utilizando años de datos de DeAnza College, un colegio comunitario en Cupertino, un estudio encontró que los estudiantes negros, latinos y nativos americanos/isleños del Pacífico obtienen mejores calificaciones, tenían más probabilidades de aprobar un curso y menos probabilidades de abandonar las clases cuando tenían un profesor que se parecía a ellos.\n“Es esa idea de tener un modelo a seguir que se parece a ti. Ese podría ser el estímulo que un estudiante necesita para seguir una educación superior”, dijo Cheche.\nA nivel estatal, el informe de la oficina del canciller muestra que el porcentaje de profesores titulares o titulares de colegios comunitarios que se identifican como negros es aproximadamente el mismo que el porcentaje de estudiantes negros: entre el 5 y el 6 por ciento en 2022, los datos más recientes disponibles. El porcentaje de administradores de colegios comunitarios que se identifican como negros es aún mayor.\nPero la representación es desigual. En Lassen Community College en Susanville, no hay profesores negros de tiempo completo, a pesar de que más de 1 de cada 10 estudiantes son negros. En San Luis Obispo y en otras universidades rurales de todo el estado persisten disparidades similares.\nEl año pasado, poco más del 1 por ciento de los estudiantes de Cabrillo College se identificaron como negros, según datos de la oficina del canciller. Chaney está comprometido a ayudar a esos estudiantes.\n“Me conozco como educador. No voy a poder estar en un lugar y no hacer nada. Es lo que me mantiene aquí, pero también me encanta”, dijo mientras preparaba un salón de clases para una celebración de fin de año para estudiantes en Umoja, un programa académico financiado por el estado para apoyar a los estudiantes negros, aunque cualquiera puede participar. Umoja existe en otros campus desde hace años, pero Chaney ayudó a lanzar la primera versión en Cabrillo College el otoño pasado.\nDe pie debajo de un cartel del Mes de la Historia Afroamericana, puso la música al son de un círculo de tambores. “¿Tengo algunos voluntarios que se levantarán y bailarán conmigo?” dijo mientras la gente iba llegando lentamente. Alrededor de 15 estudiantes y personal asistieron al evento, la mayoría de los cuales no eran negros.\nKyla Kientzel, birracial y estudiante de Umoja, dijo que aprecia los esfuerzos que Chaney está haciendo por estudiantes como ella. “En cierto modo me hace sentir más cómodo cuando hay gente que se parece a mí alrededor. Nunca antes había tenido un maestro negro”, dijo. Una vez, en la clase de inglés de Chaney, Kientzel escribió sobre su nombre, que le dio su padre, que es negro. “Puedo escribir sobre mis experiencias y ella entiende”, dijo Kientzel.\nVUELOS, EMPLEO\nCabrillo College tiene dos campus, uno en la rica comunidad costera de Aptos y otro, a sólo 20 minutos, en la ciudad agrícola del interior de Watsonville. Alrededor del 80 por ciento de los residentes de Watsonville se identifican como latinos, y los estudiantes latinos dijeron que había un clima “acogedor” y “muy comunitario” en el informe de diversidad del campus de 2018. En Aptos, que es 75 por ciento blanco, ese espíritu acogedor se desvanece, según el informe.\nEn ambos campus, alrededor del 18 por ciento de los profesores se identifican como latinos, en comparación con aproximadamente el 46 por ciento de los estudiantes de Cabrillo.\nEl distrito es muy consciente de la falta de diversidad, particularmente cuando se trata de profesores negros.\n“Mi corazón realmente está ahí para Nikia (Chaney). No está bien y es algo que debemos abordar”, dijo Adam Spickler, miembro del consejo del distrito de colegios comunitarios. “Siento que nos ha ido bastante bien aumentando la diversidad de otras maneras. Pero debemos centrar esa atención en el profesorado afroamericano, sin duda”.\nComo ejemplo de mejoras, Spickler señaló una mayor diversidad entre la administración de la universidad. De los 23 administradores, tres son negros y cuatro latinos este año.\nSpickler dijo que la falta general de diversidad no es sorprendente dada la demografía del condado de Santa Cruz. Si bien la región tiene comunidades latinas y asiáticas grandes y en crecimiento, alrededor del 1.5 por ciento son negros, según los datos del censo más reciente.\nAl crecer en la zona y ahora como estudiante, Kientzel no siempre se siente seguro. “Cuando estoy solo, me tratan bien, pero cuando estoy con mis hermanos, nos siguen en las tiendas. Siempre nos aseguramos de tener las manos fuera de los bolsillos, para que no piensen que estamos tratando de robar nada”, dijo.\nMikias Abesha es el presidente del club Umoja y estudiante de tercer semestre en Cabrillo College. Pero como estudiante internacional de Etiopía, descubre que la falta de diversidad no es el único desafío.\n“Todo es diferente”, dijo. “En mi primer semestre no entendía a ninguno de mis profesores”.\nSu primer idioma es el amárico. Dijo que Umoja fue un respiro para él, donde conoció a asesores que lo hicieron sentir como en casa. Ahora, su objetivo es trasladarse a UCLA. “Los Ángeles será mucho más diversa”, dijo.\nPara Chaney, la experiencia fue insostenible. Dijo que su hija era una de los pocos estudiantes negros en su escuela primaria y que a menudo otros estudiantes la intimidaban. Después de vivir intermitentemente en el condado de Santa Cruz durante dos años, decidió regresar cerca de amigos y familiares cerca de San Bernardino, donde la comunidad negra también es mucho más grande.\n“Necesito estar en una ciudad donde la gente se parezca a mí”, dijo. Ahora, vuela una vez por semana para asistir a clases y programas en el campus.\nMILLONES GASTADOS\nLegalmente, las universidades públicas no pueden considerar la raza o el origen étnico de un candidato a un puesto debido a una enmienda constitucional que los votantes de California aprobaron en 1996 que prohibía la acción afirmativa. Los votantes reafirmaron la prohibición en 2020. Pero la oficina del canciller y los auditores estatales coinciden en que las universidades pueden utilizar otros medios para lograr el mismo objetivo, como brindar capacitación sobre diversidad a todos los miembros del personal involucrados en la contratación, para que puedan reconocer y corregir mejor sus propias diferencias.\nEn 2021, la oficina del canciller exigió a los distritos universitarios que desarrollaran un plan para promover la diversidad en la contratación. Villarín dijo que 68 de 73 distritos han presentado un plan a la oficina del canciller a partir del 1 de octubre, la fecha límite final. Dijo que los distritos restantes incluyen Los Ángeles y Glendale, así como los distritos que representan universidades en Eureka, Stockton, Cupertino y Los Altos. Presentarán sus planes en “los próximos días”, dijo.\nLas universidades también deben analizar la demografía de sus solicitantes de empleo, pero la auditoría estatal encontró que sólo uno de los cuatro distritos de colegios comunitarios encuestados lo había hecho. Fermín Villegas, abogado adjunto de la cancillería, dijo que su equipo brindaría “más supervisión y seguimiento” en el futuro.\nDe los millones de dólares que la Legislatura destina cada año a esfuerzos para diversificar la contratación, la mayor parte se envía a los 73 distritos de colegios comunitarios del estado, que luego los distribuyen a los 116 colegios comunitarios. El año pasado, la mayoría de los distritos recibieron alrededor de 139 mil dólares, dijo Villarín. Los informes muestran que los distritos utilizaron el dinero para orientar y capacitar a profesores actuales y potenciales, entre otros esfuerzos.\nSiguiendo las recomendaciones de la oficina del rector, Cabrillo College está probando un modelo de “grupo”: contratación para ocho nuevos puestos, simultáneamente, centrados en las calificaciones de los candidatos en sus campos académicos y su compromiso de servir a los estudiantes marginados.\nUna ventaja de la contratación grupal es que puede ayudar a evitar escenarios en los que un miembro de la facultad se convierte en la persona simbólica de color, según un memorando del Senado Académico de los Colegios Comunitarios de California.\nChaney dijo que no es la única defensora de los estudiantes negros en el campus y destacó el trabajo de algunos administradores y personal negros y latinos que apoyan a los estudiantes de otras maneras. Muchos llegaron a la universidad en el último año o dos y viven en el condado.\nChaney dijo que es valioso tener mentores que vivan en la comunidad, pero también es importante tener profesores que conozcan la cultura negra, incluso si, como en su caso, esas dos no son iguales.\nDespués de que terminó el evento de Umoja, Chaney no tuvo tiempo de limpiar, por lo que sus colegas llevaron los restos de comida y suministros a sus autos. “Tengo que correr”, dijo, abrazando a cada persona mientras se despedía. Tuvo que conducir hasta San José para tomar un vuelo a casa esa tarde.\nCalMatters.org es una organización de medios de comunicación sin fines de lucro, no partidista, que explica las políticas públicas y los temas políticos de California.\nEl artículo fue publicado originalmente en\nhttps://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2024/01/faculty-diversity/\nLea más en\nhttps://www.facebook.com/calmatters y www.calmatters.org.",
