    "text": "The University of Toledo has appointed Dr. Connor Whelan as its new Deputy Athletic Director and Chief Revenue Officer (CRO), Vice President and Director of Athletics Bryan B. Blair announced Tuesday.\nWhelan brings a wealth of experience in athletic administration, fan experience, student engagement and revenue generation, most recently serving as Associate Athletic Director for Fan Experience and Sales at Mississippi State University.\nIn his role at Toledo, Whelan will oversee all external operations, including corporate partnerships, revenue strategy, development, premium seating, marketing, brand strategy, ticket sales and fan engagement, playing a key leadership role in the department’s financial growth initiatives.\n“We are thrilled to welcome Dr. Connor Whelan to Team Toledo,” Blair said. “Connor is a rising star and one of the most highly recommended young leaders in college athletics — his name came up repeatedly from some of the brightest minds in our industry. What stood out throughout the process was his elite energy, relentless work ethic and genuine hunger — not just to be at Toledo, but to grow, to lead and to help take the Rockets to new heights.\n“He’s a gritty competitor with an entrepreneurial mindset. His extensive experience in revenue generation, fan experience and student engagement — from the Sun Belt to the ACC and SEC — combined with his background as a Division I student-athlete, makes him uniquely equipped to elevate our people, our brand and our impact.”\nDuring his tenure at Mississippi State from 2022-25, Whelan spearheaded record-breaking ticket sales, innovative marketing campaigns and historic attendance milestones. He led the rollout of a new outbound ticket sales program that generated more than $5 million in revenue and set all-time football ticket revenue records ($27.1 million in 2023).\nAdditionally, he led the strategy for “Super Bulldog Weekend,” which set an NCAA on-campus baseball attendance record (16,423 fans), generated more than $1 million in revenue and included the first ever major concert production following a college baseball game featuring country singer Brett Eldredge.\n“I am thrilled to have the opportunity to join the Toledo Rockets and Bryan Blair’s team,” Whelan said. “Toledo is a premier program within the Group of 5 and routinely stands out nationally for its accomplishments in both athletic and academic pursuits. I cannot wait to help guide the department and campus to even greater heights. As a Western Pennsylvania native, this area of the country is home to me and I couldn’t be more excited to be back. Big things are ahead and I am excited to be able to play a part in the future success of Toledo Athletics.”\nPrior to his tenure at Mississippi State, Whelan served as Assistant Athletic Director for Fan Experience and Sales at Wake Forest University where he guided football marketing efforts to three sellouts and set record-breaking ticket revenue numbers in 2021.\nWhelan also held positions at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and the University of Arkansas. At Louisiana Lafayette, he led a marketing team that produced dramatic increases in sales revenue and guided efforts that resulted in No. 1 attendance marks in the Sun Belt Conference in men’s basketball, baseball and softball.\nWhelan holds a Ph.D. in Sports Management from Troy University, an MBA from the University of Arkansas and a bachelor’s degree in Sports Administration from Kent State University, where he was also a two-time Academic All-MAC cross country/track student-athlete.\nWhelan will begin his role at Toledo on Monday, June 23.",

    "title": "An annual pilgrimage during Holy Week brings thousands of believers to Santuario de Chimayó in New Mexico",
    "text": "(The Conversation) — For decades, the people of northern New Mexico have marked the Christian observance of Good Friday with a walking pilgrimage to the Santuario de Chimayó in the village of Chimayó, New Mexico.\nReferring to themselves as\nHispanos, or Nuevomexicanos, they have lived in the region for generations, tracing their descent from Spanish colonists who arrived to New Mexico in the 17th and 18th centuries. Nuevomexicanos’ Catholicism developed at the far northern frontier of the Spanish Empire; a scarcity of priests led to the flourishing of many popular devotions in New Mexico, including the pilgrimage to Chimayó.\nBuilt in the early 1800s, the santuario is a small church, built of adobe bricks, with a unique feature: In a little room adjacent to the church’s central worship space, there is a hole in the floor, the “pocito,” filled with the sandy earth of the area.\nFor at least 200 years, Nuevomexicano Catholics have used dirt from the pocito for its purported miraculous healing qualities. They rub it on their aches and pains, they hold it to focus their prayers, and, historically, ingested it.\nIn 2015, I participated in the annual pilgrimage as part of the research for\nmy book, “The Healing Power of the Santuario de Chimayó: America’s Miraculous Church.” The santuario’s story is not merely a curiosity but also a significant part of the shifting identity of the U.S. Catholic Church, which is on the verge of becoming majority-Latino.\nLegendary origins of santuario’s holy dirt\nThe source of the pocito dirt’s power for Hispano pilgrims is linked to two images of Christ.\nThe first is a large crucifix called the Señor de Esquipulas, or Lord of Esquipulas. Named for a famous and much older\nGuatemalan Christ figure also known as the Señor de Esquipulas, the crucifix lies at the heart of the most common origin story for the santuario’s holy dirt.\nThe legend goes that in 1810, a Chimayó community leader and landowner named Bernardo Abeyta witnessed light coming out of the ground in one of his fields. Upon examination, he is said to have discovered the crucifix partially buried in the soil. He dug it up and brought it to the nearest church at the time, some 8 miles away.\nThe crucifix, however, is believed to have returned on its own to the hole in Abeyta’s field. Given this sign, Abeyta sought and received permission to build a chapel around the hole, a chapel today known as the Santuario de Chimayó.\nThe Señor de Esquipulas crucifix hangs on the main altar screen in the santuario, and the Archdiocese of Santa Fe has promoted the story of its miraculous provenance.\nA second Christ image, however, is by far the more popular among Hispano pilgrims. The\nSanto Niño de Atocha is a depiction of the Christ child dressed as a medieval pilgrim and is popular throughout northern Mexico and the U.S.-Mexico border region. A statue of the Holy Child is ensconced in the santuario in a room adjacent to the pocito.\nFor pilgrims, a visit to the santuario typically includes time in prayer in front of the Holy Child, where they ask for healing and protection for themselves, their children and other loved ones. They take home dirt from the pocito as a reminder and vehicle of Christ’s power to answer their prayers.\nThe annual pilgrimage\nHispano residents in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado made pilgrimages to the santuario for healing throughout the 19th century, but the massive walking pilgrimage during Holy Week, culminating on Good Friday, did not begin until after World War II.\nHundreds of members of New Mexico’s 200th Coast Artillery had endured the 1942\nBataan Death March, in which thousands of U.S. and Filipino prisoners of war were forced by the Japanese Imperial Army to walk for miles through the Philippines. Many died from either torture or exhaustion.\nUpon returning home, Nuevomexicano survivors organized a walking pilgrimage to the santuario in 1946 to commemorate their suffering and to mourn their lost comrades.\nThis pilgrimage soon evolved into an annual observance not only for veterans but also for Hispano Catholics in general.\nToday, hundreds of thousands of visitors come to the santuario throughout the year, but the pilgrimage during Holy Week – the week before the celebration of Easter – is the high point. Good Friday, the day on which Christians believe that Jesus was crucified and died, attracts approximately\n30,000 walking pilgrims, some coming from as far away as Albuquerque, 90 miles away. Others choose shorter routes, including a popular 9-mile walk from the nearby town of Española.\nLatino Catholics\nThe santuario’s popularity continues to rise along with the numbers of Latino Catholics in the U.S.\nThe demographic shift in the U.S. Catholic Church toward a\nLatino majority is well underway. Timothy Matovina, a professor at the University of Notre Dame, writes in his book, “Latino Catholicism: Tranformation in America’s Largest Church,” that Latinos represent one-third of all U.S. Catholics and make up more than half of the U.S. Catholic population under the age of 25.\nHe also notes that, because of Latino population growth, the proportion of Catholics in California and Texas has increased since 1990, while the proportion in Massachusetts and New York has dropped. This demographic shift means devotional sites, like the santuario, that have Latino Catholic origins and immense popularity can expect to grow in importance.\n(Brett Hendrickson, Professor of Religious Studies, Lafayette College .

    "title": "Here's what will happen when Pope Francis dies",
    "text": "With Pope Francis in hospital with pneumonia in both lungs, the world is on high alert for an extraordinary news event: The death of a pontiff.\nFrancis, who lost part of a lung to a respiratory infection in his youth and has been plagued by ailing health recently,\nlast year approved a stripped-down funeral for himself, eschewing some of the more arcane rites and rituals that take place when a pope passes away.\nBut his death, whenever it happens, is still set to immediately kick off a tightly choreographed series of events, refined over centuries and hundreds of dead popes. Some Vatican traditions date back to Ancient Rome.\nAt the end of the spectacle, a new leader of the Catholic church will be selected in a high-stakes election dramatized in the Oscar-nominated thriller “Conclave,” with progressive and conservative cardinals vying for control of an institution with a billion followers globally.\nThe death\nIt is traditionally the job of the camerlengo (a senior Vatican official) to confirm the death of a pope. Currently, that position is held by Irish-born Cardinal Kevin Farrell.\nIf tradition stands, it will be Farrell who visits Pope Francis’ body in his private chapel and calls out his name to rouse him. Nowadays, this is largely ceremonial, as doctors will have confirmed the pontiff’s death through more standard medical means. (An oft-repeated myth holds that the camerlengo also gently taps the pope’s head with a silver hammer; the Vatican has\nlong denied this.)\nWhen the pontiff does not respond, according to tradition, his signet ring that acts as the seal for official papal documents is\ndefaced or destroyed, signifying the end of his reign, and the papal apartments are sealed off. The camerlengo informs the College of Cardinals, a governing body of senior church officials, that the pope has died, before his death is announced to the world in a Vatican statement to the media.\nThe mourning period\nThe pope’s death will trigger nine days of mourning known as the Novendiale, originally an Ancient Roman custom. Italy also typically declares a period of national mourning.\nHis body will be blessed, dressed in papal vestments and exhibited in St. Peter’s Basilica for public viewing, where hundreds of thousands will line up to pay their respects, including foreign dignitaries and world leaders. In the past, the pope’s corpse was displayed on a raised platform called a catafalque, but Francis’ simplified funeral rites will see him lying in an open coffin without so much pomp and pageantry.\nHistorically, popes were often embalmed and some had their organs removed prior to burial — a church near the Trevi Fountain in Rome\nholds the hearts of more than 20 popes in marble urns, preserved as holy relics — but these practices have fallen out of favor.\nAs Pope Francis lies in state, daily prayer services and Requiem Masses will be held at St. Peter’s Basilica and throughout the Catholic world.\nMeanwhile, the Vatican will enter a transitional period called sede vacante, meaning “the seat is vacant,” during which the rule of the church is temporarily handed over to the College of Cardinals — though no major decisions can be made until a new pope is elected.\nThe burial\nThe pope’s funeral will most likely be held in St. Peter’s Square, with mourners packing into the Vatican for the service. It will be led by the dean of the College of Cardinals, currently 91-year-old Italian Giovanni Battista Re.\nTraditionally, the pope is then buried in the Vatican Grottoes, the crypts beneath St. Peter’s Basilica. Almost 100 popes are entombed there, including Pope Benedict XVI, Francis’ predecessor, who resigned in 2013 and died in 2022.\nBut Francis said in an interview in 2023 that he had picked the Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome, one of his favorite and most-frequented churches, as his final resting place, making him the first pope in a century to be interred outside the Vatican.\nPast popes were\nentombed in three coffins: one made out of cypress, one of zinc and one of elm, nested inside each other, but Francis has ordered that he be buried in a single coffin, made of wood and zinc.\nWhen Benedict XVI was buried, his coffin also contained coins minted during his reign, as well as a metal tube enclosing a rolled-up paper scroll, called a rogito — a 1,000-word document retelling his life and reign. Francis will likely be buried with his own rogito detailing his unique papacy.\nThe election\nTwo to three weeks after the pope’s funeral, the College of Cardinals will convene in the Sistine Chapel to hold a conclave, the highly secretive process of electing a new pope. In theory, any baptized male Roman Catholic is eligible for the papacy, but for the past 700 years, the pope has always been chosen from the College of Cardinals.\nThe vast majority of the 266 pontiffs elected throughout history have been European. Pope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Argentina, is the first non-European pontiff in 1,300 years.\nUnlike in regular politics, candidates for pope do not openly campaign for the position. Vatican watchers have deemed cardinals who have a good shot at becoming pope papabile, meaning “popeable.”\nOn the day of voting, the Sistine Chapel, with its famed ceiling painted by Michelangelo, is physically sealed off and the cardinals, who have taken an oath of secrecy, are locked inside.\nOnly cardinals under the age of 80 are eligible to cast ballots. Around 120 will vote in secret for their chosen candidate, writing their name on a ballot and placing it in a chalice atop the altar.\nIf no candidate receives the required two-thirds majority, another round of voting takes place. There can be up to four rounds per day. The conclave that elected Pope Francis in 2013 took about 24 hours and five ballots, but the process can run longer; a conclave in the 13th century took about three years, while another in the 18th century took four months.\nOnce ballots are counted, they are burned in a stove inside the Sistine Chapel, installed ahead of time by Vatican firefighters. A second stove burns a chemical sending up a smoke signal through a chimney to the outside world: Black smoke means a new pope has not been selected, white smoke means one has.\nThe new pope\nOnce a pope is chosen, a representative from the College of Cardinals reads out the Latin announcement Habemus papam, meaning “We have a pope,” from the main balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica overlooking thousands of eager faithful.\nThen the freshly elected pope, having chosen a papal name (most likely one honoring a saint or predecessor) and donned a white cassock, steps out onto the balcony to give his first address to the public. And with that, the Catholic world has a new leader.\nAlong with setting the church’s teachings and morals, the pope wields significant diplomatic and political power in world politics, acting as a mediator in global conflicts and guiding humanitarian efforts.\nMost popes serve until the day they die. Pope Benedict XVI, who resigned in 2013, aged 85, because of declining health, was the first pontiff to step down in 600 years.\nBen Munster contributed to this report.\nThe post\nHere’s what will happen when Pope Francis dies appeared first on Politico.",
