A transit visa is a document that indicates that a traveler has been granted permission by the government to transit through but not remain in a country. A transit visa permits the visa holder to travel to their final destination through India. Foreign nationals who want to visit India are normally allowed to travel in transit. If the applicant is a permanent resident, a transit visa is all that is required. Even if they are passing through on their way to another country, most travelers visiting India require a visa. Citizens are not permitted to change their minds. If the applicant is not a permanent resident, a non-immigrant (a foreign citizen) can apply for an immigrant or transit visa. Some nationalities are required to apply for a transit visa for India at an embassy or consulate in advance. However, most foreign passport holders can now obtain an electronic transit visa for India via a simple online application. If they already have a valid India e-Visa For example, if they have an approved business visa or medical visa, they do not need to apply for a transit visa if they are transiting through India for more than 24 hours. This is because these types of visas are multiple entry visas for India which allow the holder to enter India multiple times during their validity. Eligible applicants for a Transit Visa to India can complete the online e-Visa Application Form which includes minutes to enter basic passport, passport, and travel information.

    "text": "The six-bedroom house was demolished early Thursday morning. The house where four [University of Idaho students were murdered](https://www.insideedition.com/tag/university-of-idaho-murders) has been torn down. Demolition of the six-bedroom house began as dawn broke over the college campus, which had emptied out due to the winter holiday break. Cable news channels captured the destruction live. NewsNation’s Nancy Loo was at the scene. “Sanitation crews are being followed by law enforcement. Law enforcement will actually guard the debris. They didn’t say for how long, but, yes, they are concerned about morbid souvenir hunters,” Loo says. Students Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapin were stabbed to death in November 2022 in a case that shocked the country. Twenty-eight-year-old defendant criminology PhD student [Bryan Kohberger](https://www.insideedition.com/tag/bryan-kohberger) has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. The house cost the university $700 a day for round-the-clock security guards. The university says demolishing the house is the first step in the community’s healing from the trauma. However, the demolition has divided the victims’ families. Ethan Chapin’s family supports it, but Kaylee Goncalves and Xana Kernodle’s loved ones expressed strong opposition. “They’re pretty upset. I mean, it's one of those things when you don’t really think it's gonna happen until it happens. And so watching the demo on the television was pretty hard for the victims’ families,” Shannon Gray, the Goncalves family attorney, says. After 90 minutes, the house was gone, but the horror of what happened there remains. The University says they plan on building what they call a healing garden where the house once stood.",

    "text": "Lando Norris, who found himself inadvertently overshadowing team-mate Oscar Piastri’s first Formula 1 win in Hungary, expressed deep regret over the circumstances.\nNorris, who had leapfrogged ahead of Piastri due to a strategic pit stop decision by McLaren, held onto the lead for 20 tension-filled laps. This delay in swapping positions, according to Norris, marred what should have been a jubilant celebration for Piastri. He explained to Sky Sports F1 :\n“Could it have been handled slightly differently from both the team side and a personal side? Yes, absolutely, and I think we wouldn’t have been having this conversation now in some ways.\n“Whether people on the outside think and [are] going to come up with their own stories of what happened and what I would and wouldn’t have done, I don’t mind about that.\n“The things that I could have done, the fact that I kind of clouded over Oscar’s first race win in Formula 1 is something I’ve not felt too proud about.\n“The fact we had a one-two and that was barely a headline after the race. The fact we had a one-two and nothing was really spoken about it from that side, that’s the bits I felt worse about.\n“Apart from that we discussed it, we have spoken abut it. Both sides could have done things a little bit better, a little bit differently. It’s almost not good that we had it, but a good moment we’ve had it [at the same time], we’ve learned from it and hopefully it’s done better next time.”\nNorris felt that the overshadowing of the team’s one-two finish, a significant achievement, was the most regrettable aspect. He expressed disappointment that “the fact we had a one-two and that was barely a headline after the race” left the whole team underappreciated.\nThe championship standings added another layer of complexity to Norris’s decision at the Hungarian GP. Despite being closer to the championship leader in points, Norris dismissed any bias within team decisions, vehemently stating:\n“That had nothing to do with last week. I shouldn’t have led the race, that’s the end of it.\n“Oscar got me off the line, he controlled it well, that was it. I shouldn’t have led the race and so people should then never have had the perception of ‘ah, the team are not biasing towards Lando’. If Oscar was leading the whole race there is absolutely zero reason why they should ask him to let me past.\n“If you are thinking of it from a championship point of view, I don’t know when the point is of like if I’m 10 points behind, 15 points behind, whatever, at what point then do you go ‘can you help out a bit more’ or can you do this or do that?\n“I don’t know when that point is and that’s not my decision. But when Oscar has led the whole race, controlled it well, and just from a strategy side they have boxed me first just to be safe, that’s just given the perception of something completely different.\n“It shouldn’t do, internally we know it doesn’t. Oscar deserved to win and he did, as simple as that.”\nUncommon Knowledge Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nThe post F1 News: Lando Norris Regrets ‘Clouding Over’ Oscar Piastri’s Maiden Formula One Victory appeared first on Newsweek .",

    "text": "It took nine days for the blaze in Conakry to be fully extinguished after a blast rocked the state oil company's main depot - Copyright GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP/File SPENCER PLATT Mouctar BAH Almost two weeks after a huge fire in Guinea’s main fuel depot brought death and destruction, anger is growing as the economy is reeling, with inflation rising, petrol rationed and no trucks moving merchandise.\nIt took nine days for the blaze to be fully extinguished after a blast rocked the state oil company’s main depot on December 18 in the capital Conakry, where 24 people died and another 454 were injured.\nBut Guinea will likely feel the aftereffects for the foreseeable future.\nThe west African nation remains one of the least developed countries in the world despite being rich in minerals, including gold and bauxite.\nAt Conakry’s main market, Madina, most stores are closed. Merchandise trucks sit idled at the foot of buildings.\nTraffic has also come to a standstill at the port of Conakry, near the epicentre of the fire.\nThe streets of the capital have fewer vehicles than usual — except for the massive lines at petrol stations.\nWith little fuel available, fishermen stay close to the coast where there are fewer fish to catch.\nThe government — led since September 2021 by a military junta that deposed the country’s first democratically-elected president — announced on Saturday that petrol distribution would resume.\nBut fuel is rationed, limited to 25 litres per vehicle, and five litres per motorcycle and three-wheeled tuk-tuk. The use of jerrycans was banned to prevent a black market from emerging.\n“There is suffering,” said Mamadou Yaya Bah, a tuk-tuk taxi driver who sat for hours waiting for his turn at a service station in Conakry.\nHe said his fares have tripled or quadrupled due to the rationing.\nTaxi drivers are not venturing out of the capital.\n“We are never sure to find fuel in the interior of the country,” said taxi driver Mamadou Saliou Balde.\n– ‘Too much hassle’ –\nGoods are not reaching areas outside of the capital, either, where roads are constantly in bad shape.\nAlpha Kabine Doumbouya, a trader who has three delivery trucks and five taxis in Kankan, 600 kilometres east of Conakry, said all of the vehicles have stopped service.\n“If Conakry coughs, the rest of the country catches a cold,” he said.\n“The drivers are out of work. We are getting by here at my wife’s restaurant while waiting for better days,” he said.\nA customs officer at Guinea’s border with Sierra Leone told AFP that the vehicles that used to go and get goods in Conakry are no longer coming.\n“No fuel, no security, too much hassle,” he said on condition of anonymity.\nNeighbouring countries are helping out.\nSierra Leone has given Guinea permission to use its depots to store its petroleum products. On Wednesday, Ivory Coast said it would deliver 50 million litres of petrol a month to Guinea.\n– ‘Tipping point’ –\nThe crisis is expected to cut economic growth by 0.7 percentage points this year, according to the National Statistics Institute.\nTransport costs have jumped by 60 percent nationally, said Guinean economist Tidiane Barry.\nPublic finances will also take a hit as revenue from the energy and transport sectors fall, Barry said.\nInflation is expected to top 10 percent in December, and more than 15 percent in Conakry alone, the economist added.\nAt the Taouyah market, Hawa Toure’s grocery bag was empty.\n“I have nothing to put in my bag because prices at the market have suddenly become so high,” she said.\nVegetable seller Aminata Camara was falling asleep in his stall.\n“I’m still waiting for the first customer,” he said. “I don’t know what Guinea did to god to deserve this punishment.”\nBarry said the disaster is a “tipping point” for Guinea as it has exposed the vulnerabilities of its economy, including its reliance on oil.\nBut it is also a chance to rethink Guinea’s economic strategy.\n“Investing in safe infrastructure, diversifying the economy and strengthening regional cooperation are key steps towards sustainable and resilient economic development,” Barry said.",

El último miércoles 26 de junio, [Alianza Lima perdió 3-2 ante Bolívar en un partido amistoso](https://larepublica.pe/deportes/2024/06/25/ver-alianza-lima-vs-bolivar-en-vivo-copa-ciudad-de-los-reyes-via-zapping-tv-amistoso-2024-1263325) por la Copa Ciudad de los Reyes 2024.

El cuadro victoriano empezó ganando con tantos de Ricardo Lagos y Jeriel De Santi, pero después el conjunto visitante lo dio vuelta con goles de Henry Vaca y Bruno Sávio (doblete). Uno de los protagonistas de este cotejo fue el portero de Alianza Lima Ángel de la Cruz, quien fue cómplice de dos de los tres goles del equipo boliviano. El comentarista deportivo Mr. Peet criticó el bajo nivel mostrado por el guardameta juvenil no solo en este encuentro, sino a lo largo de la temporada cuando le ha tocado ingresar al campo, y contó algunos impases que vivió en el último duelo ante Bolívar. PUEDES VER: [Revelan la charla que tuvo Fossati con sus jugadores luego de la dura derrota ante Canadá por la Copa América] ¿Qué pasó con Ángel de la Cruz durante el Alianza Lima vs. Bolívar? En la última edición del programa 'Madrugol', el narrador de fútbol contó que Alejandro Restrepo, Juan Pablo Freytes y Adrián Arregui le llamaron la atención a Ángel de la Cruz porque no entraba del todo en el juego con el equipo. \"Hay un momento en el que el chico entró en trompo. Que 3 jugadores y el técnico (Alejandro Restrepo) te llamen la atención es porque algo pasó. No sé si se aturdió, no lo sé, pero hay una que Arregui le dice: 'Oye, juega que acá estoy'. Freytes también lo miraba, la gente gritaba y todo, pero él seguía como si nada\", narró. Luego, precisó que el estratega colombiano fue el que más veces habló con él durante el partido para preguntarle qué pasaba, pues no seguía el mismo ritmo de sus compañeros. \"Restrepo le decía: 'Oye, ¿qué pasa?, juega, ¿qué pasa?'. Hay otra que agarra la pelota, Sabbag le marca el pase para que se la tire y Restrepo le vuelve a decir: '¿Qué pasa?, juega', pero no reaccionaba\", detalló.
