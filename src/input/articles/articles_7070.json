    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "- Significant blood pressure reductions among patients with uncontrolled or resistant hypertension treated with lorundrostat reinforce key role of dysregulated aldosterone in disease onset and progression -\n- Detailed results from the second pivotal Phase 3 Launch-HTN trial to be presented at an upcoming medical conference and published in a peer-reviewed publication -\nRADNOR, Pa., April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mineralys Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MLYS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing medicines to target hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other diseases driven by dysregulated aldosterone, today announced that the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published the detailed results from the Company's pivotal Phase 2 Advance-HTN trial, the first of two pivotal trials evaluating lorundrostat in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (uHTN) or resistant hypertension (rHTN). The full manuscript is titled, \"Lorundrostat Efficacy and Safety in Patients with Uncontrolled Hypertension,” and is featured in the April 23, 2025 issue of NEJM .\nThe key data from the publication showed that lorundrostat 50 mg demonstrated a 15.4 mmHg absolute reduction and a 7.9 mmHg placebo-adjusted reduction (p=0.001), in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure at week 12. Lorundrostat worked equally well in those taking two baseline medications and those taking three or more, and in both men and women as well as in white and black patients. Lorundrostat demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile, with modest changes in potassium, sodium and eGFR.\n\"The publication of our Advance-HTN trial results in the New England Journal of Medicine is a significant milestone that underscores both the strength of our clinical data and the potentially transformative nature of this new class of medicines that could help address dysregulated aldosterone, an unaddressed, key driver of hypertension,” stated Jon Congleton, Chief Executive Officer of Mineralys Therapeutics. \"Prior studies have shown that even modest reductions in systolic blood pressure can lead to a substantial decrease in the incidence of major cardiovascular events. The blood pressure reductions with lorundrostat observed in the Advance-HTN trial are particularly meaningful given the well-established correlation between elevated blood pressure, dysregulated aldosterone production and cardiovascular risk.”",

    "text": "FORT BEND COUNTY, Texas — If you live or drive in Fort Bend County, officials say vehicle burglaries are on the rise. On Christmas morning, Missouri City resident Alex Bergeron said she was enjoying the day inside with her family until her sister came over. \"My sister came in the house and said, 'Why is your back window rolled down?' And I was like, 'Well it shouldn't be,'\" Bergeron said. When she went outside, she learned an unwanted visitor had been in her car. \"The glass even got to the front. I was just in shock, honestly. So, I went back inside and said, 'Hey, my car got broken into,'\" she said. Her doors were locked and all the thieves could see in the back were some jackets. \"They didn't take anything, my glove compartments weren't gone through so I'm not sure if someone startled them away,\" Bergeron said.\" Fort Bend County Sheriff Eric Fagan said car break-ins are up 9% this month compared to the previous. He recommends simply locking doors and removing every item inside. \"It's the holiday season. Thieves want to come out even more because they know individuals are shopping, leaving things in their cars. Let's not make it easy for them,\" he said. Luckily for Bergeron, she avoids the costly headache of replacing her window. \"You never know how it really feels until it happens to you,\" she said. \"It was just a bad feeling and it felt very personal.\" Other tips from the sheriff include tinting your windows and getting an alarm for window breaks. He said 25% of vehicles that were stolen in the county were left unlocked.",

    "text": "Capt. Anuj Nayyar and the men of 17 Jat fought relentlessly in a gruesome battle for two nights in July to secure Pimple 2, the peak, which helped rid Tiger Hill of threats from its western flanks. It also helped resume traffic on NH1A from Ghumri to Zoji La, with trucks bringing on-time supply of ammunition and ration to military bases. During the entire battle, 46 regular members of the Pakistan Army, an unknown number of Pakistani paramilitary troopers, militants were killed and 11 Indian Army troops, including Capt.Captain Anuj Nayyar was in a different state that day. Subedar Man Singh recalls him saying, ‘I’m going to live very long, there’s no bullet in Pakistan that could do me any harm today.’ His jumps and leaps would resemble that of a young tiger. Soon, he would need all his might for the attack on the third bunker of Pimple 2.The third bunker tested Anuj both mentally and physically. The shelling escalated the moment the Charlie Company started moving towards it. Subedar Vinod Kumar narrates, ‘We were done with the second bunker by 0348 hours and the morning light had started to surface. It was then that the hiding sniper on Point 4875 started hitting our men. For 15 whole minutes, we had no natural defence against him. In a series of assaults by artillery, auto-fire and sniper fire, the Charlie Company lost three more men and two soldiers were badly wounded.’One of the men who died at that hour was the radio operator, who was hit by a mortar shell splinter. Anuj carried his lifeless body to a safe corner and lifted the radio set on to his back. It did not bother him that the radio set weighed almost twenty kilos. The other soldiers followed Capt. Nayyar without a word. He decided to attack the third bunker despite the natural disadvantage of the rising sun. It was the only way to be safe from sniper fire. They had barely moved from the spot where the radio operator had fallen when the infiltrators on nearby peaks started artillery shelling on Pimple 2 to back up their men trapped there. In the next two to three minutes, a barrage of continuous shelling by both NLI firebase and artillery unit descended on the men of 17 Jat Battalion. By then the silence of the operation had already been disrupted. And thus started the chants of the war cry: Jat Balwan, Jai Bhagwan! 109788450Havildar Hari Om interrupted his captain, looking for confirmation that they were moving in for the kill. But to expect an ounce of doubt from Anuj was like finding a safe spot in the face of enemy fire. Subedar Vinod Kumar exclaims, ‘When the tiger had his prey in sight, how could he have stopped!’ Subedar Man Singh recalls that the enemy had started pelting the Indian soldiers with just about anything they could lay their hands on, from empty shells to stones. ‘At that height, even a ten-gram stone pellet could hit us at 50 miles an hour, but we carried on. Anuj sahab led the team from the front. As we reached the firing location for the third bunker, Maj. Punia wanted to talk to Anuj about the status of the operation,’ the subedar says.While he was on the call with Maj. Punia, a mortar shell landed just inches away from the platoon position. And then the deadly firing from the third bunker began. The enemy knew that Anuj’s team was close. Continued firing from both sides was proving futile. No one was able to move an inch forward and daylight was blowing the cover of the Indian troops.In a swift decision, one of the men tried to take a direct shot at the bunker with a rocket launcher. However, owing to the intricate make of the bunker and the distance to it, an accurate shot was very difficult. After a failed attempt, Capt. Nayyar took over the weapon and launched another shot which went through a small opening and inflicted serious damage on the target.The company continued crawling towards the third bunker through mud and smoke. It was then that Naib Subedar Virendar Singh’s SLR got stuck. Anuj noticed this and wasted no time in throwing his AK-47 to Singh. ‘He knew that the AK-47 was a better assault weapon in his hands, much more than mine. Still, he gave me his weapon in the blink of an eye,’ recalls the soldier. Anuj had no time to judge the qualities of the gun; it was time to trust in the qualities of the men at his side. 109788470Anuj continued to support the team with his calls, instructions and war cries. Simultaneously, the Pakistani sniper which the Indian forward troops had missed in a battle on another peak was taking potshots at Indian soldiers while they were busy fighting. Minutes later, Havildar Kumar fell to the bullets of this sniper. Capt. Nayyar then decided to ditch an organized approach towards the enemy.Incidentally, the sniper in question was later killed in action by the mopping up party of 2 Naga, following the operations at Point 4875. Continuing their assault, to silence the MMG post at this bunker, Anuj crawled ahead of the unit and sneaked right below it. Then with his bare hands he held the barrel of the enemy MMG and pulled it out to neutralise the post for good.After beating an MMG post, Anuj tried throwing in a couple of hand grenades, which went in vain. The sangar was too strong. Anuj went ahead with one more soldier and dropped a grenade right inside the bunker. That was the end of it. Now all that was between Anuj and total victory was the final bunker of Pimple 2.The men in the fourth bunker may have bitten their tongue on seeing a boyish-looking soldier at their threshold. Seeing Anuj race towards the final bunker, Subedar Man Singh thought of the young officer’s upcoming marriage. ‘He was moving so fast and fearlessly, it seemed his marriage was scheduled for the next day,’ he laughs drily.But Anuj had a deadline to keep: deliver Pimple 2 to his seniors by 0500 hrs. ‘Anuj sir gathered the remaining soldiers and motivated them to launch the attack on the last bunker. We would be remembered for the service to our country and we would be remembered as people who stoked fear in the hearts of Pakistanis. So, Anuj sir told us that he was sure each one of us would be there standing in those bunkers, proudly hoisting the Indian flag.’ After the pep talk, the Jats rose as a pack with the war cry of their regiment.With a limited yet motivated unit, Anuj led the teams to the fourth bunker. Under the instructions of Col. Bawa, he was not to disrupt the mission at any point for repeated intel and was to only make contact for any emergency, evaluation, support or suggestion.At the fourth bunker shelling from the Indian firebase had stopped. Anuj began with the regular approach of targeted firing and periodic shelling combined with grenades and rocket launchers. But that did not even scratch the bunker.Anuj decided that they needed a breakthrough and went straight for the loopholes of the enemy bunker. He tried to throw live grenades inside. It almost felt like he was back in the academy where life was competition and defeat was something he could not afford.Anything that had even a small chance of diluting the enemy’s advantage was important. He also reverse-threw hand grenades but none made it inside the bunker. The loophole was cut to the size of a gun barrel and nothing more.Anuj then launched the last of his rockets with the assistance of Sepoy Virender Kumar. But the rocket bounced off the structure. It was almost like the sangar was damage repellent. There was constant altercation, too, between the enemy and Anuj. He asked his men to sever two communication lines belonging to the opponent, in order to prevent any calls for enemy reinforcements and the possibility of artillery shelling from the other side. 109788560It was getting closer to the reporting time and efforts were not bearing fruit. Some men suggested that Anuj call for back-up while they held their positions. Anuj knew that staying at their positions in broad daylight would not only expose them to the enemy units at Pimple 2 but also the enemy sniper on another peak. He knew he had to rely on stealth and risky ascent for a breakthrough.But before he could start, he waited a moment at the side of a rock. He probably remembered his father reading the names of war heroes and award winners at the IMA hall and saying, ‘Yaar, Anuj, iss mein ek bhi Nayyar nahin hain?’ He must have felt like looking at his family once more. As he slid his hand in his pocket to pull out his wallet, he remembered that he had left it with Col. Bawa.He then took out a cigarette and lit it up. He smiled as he took a long drag of the cigarette. Mani did not know that he smoked and probably more times in a day than she could accept. Subedar Subhash Singh, who was next to him, says, ‘I saw him smiling with a faraway look on his face, like he was deep in thought. He broke from his thoughts and knew that it was time for the final assault. He made the decision to let go of his safety if he had to end this battle.He was now fiercer than ever. Taking shelter and the original scoot-and-shoot plan was no longer an option. He stood as a single line of defence between his men and the enemy. His was the stand of a tiger amidst the barrage of bullets and grenades.Subedar Subhash realised the risk his commander was taking to ensure the end of the battle. He urged him to take shelter for his own safety. Capt. Anuj’s immediate response was, ‘Subhash, yeh dekh mera haath, yeh lifeline dekh. Dad kehte hain ki yeh bahut lambi hain. Mujhe kuchh nahin ho sakta hain.’ (Subhash, look at my hand, look at this lifeline. My father says that it’s very long. Nothing can harm me.)Still, Subedar Subhash pulled his captain’s hand to make sure that he took shelter from enemy fire. Anuj took this moment to reassess the situation with his team. His radio set buzzed, and it was Col. Bawa on the other side. Anuj straightened up a bit and told his commanding officer about the attack mounted on the last bunker and how they were left with little ammunition. But at no point did he ask for more support.Brig. Bawa remembers telling him that reinforcements were not an option. Anuj replied, ‘Sir, three down, one to go. Don’t you worry, sir, I’ll have that peak for you in just some time. I’ll myself …’ and the line went dead.It was 0520 hours. Brig. Bawa kept calling Anuj to see if there had been a disruption in the line. He had heard a loud noise but got no response from the other end. He kept asking for a situation report, but received no reply. There in the peaks of Drass, at some 16,000 feet, Subedar Subhash and the other men could not believe what had just happened. ‘We remember an RPG coming towards us. We remember the explosion. For a moment we thought that we had lost our lives,’ narrates the survivor. As the men recovered from the explosion they realised that their commander had saved their lives. A rocket-propelled grenade had gone straight through his neck and pierced him through the length of his chest and torso – ending the life but not the spirit of the young captain. The soldiers still believe that Anuj saved fifteen lives by taking on that RPG. It took but a moment of the war to turn the tide with his sacrifice. He was motivating his men in life, and he was motivating them even more in his death.Excerpted with permission from ‘Tiger of Drass: Capt. Anuj Nayyar, 23, Kargil Hero’ (published by Harper Collins India)",

    "text": "TOKYO - Japan sweltered through its hottest July since records began 126 years ago, the weather agency said, as extreme heatwaves fuelled by climate change engulfed many parts of the globe. Temperatures in the country were 2.16 degrees Celsius higher than average, breaking last year's record for July of 1.91 degrees Celsius above average. \"It was the highest since statistics began in 1898,\" the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said Thursday, noting that the figures were \"considerably higher\" nationwide. Of 153 observation posts across Japan, 62 broke their average temperature record in July. Contributing factors included a high-pressure system over the Pacific and \"warm air from the south\" that shrouded northern parts of the archipelago, the JMA said. Since April, heatstroke has killed 59 people in Japan, according to the disaster management agency. Parasols and chunky necklaces that can be stored in the freezer have been a common sight around Tokyo, where street performer Jiro Kan, 56, told AFP he was feeling the heat. \"After spending two hours standing here, I get so sweaty I can literally squeeze it all out from my shirt. I'm drenched,\" said Kan, dressed in an all-yellow suit. \"People who are used to a more dry type of heat like in the United States find the heat and humidity in Japan more difficult to handle,\" he said in tourist hotspot Asakusa. Last month, Shizuoka west of Tokyo became the first Japanese region to see the mercury reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) this year -- far surpassing the 35-degree threshold deemed \"extremely hot\" by authorities. Heatwaves are becoming increasingly common across the globe, with the European Union's climate monitor saying in July that the Earth experienced its warmest day in recorded history. AFP",

    "text": "Orsi: \"De Laurentiis ha fatto una prodezza di dimensioni bibliche\"\nNando Orsi, ex portiere, ha toccato diversi argomenti nel corso della trasmissione sportiva Giochiamo d'Anticipo, programma in onda su Televomero.\nL'ex portiere, ora opinionista, Ferdinando Orsi, nel corso del suo intervento ai microfoni di Giochiamo d'Anticipo, programma in onda sulla emittente televisiva campana Televomero. Diversi gli argomenti trattati: dal mercato, con l’ormai vicinissimo addio di Kvara, alla corsa Scudetto.\nDi seguito il pensiero dell'attuale opinionista: \"Kvaratskhelia? Il Napoli nella sua storia ha avuto grandi giocatori: penso a Mertens, a Cavani… Una città intera, che io rispetto e ci mancherebbe altro, è dispiaciuta per un anno che ha fatto un giocatore come Kvara, dove tutti gli altri sono stati eccezionali. Nell’anno e mezzo dopo non mi ha entusiasmato tanto, De Laurentiis ha fatto una prodezza di dimensioni bibliche, per non averlo rinnovato prima ed averlo venduto a più di 70 milioni poi. Diciamo anche che Conte è stato bravo a tenere qualcuno, perché a giugno tutti volevano andare via. Ndoye possibile sostituto? Non capisco perché il Bologna se ne voglia privare, ma come riserva andrebbe bene. Io Chiesa non lo prenderei, secondo me non sta ancora bene fisicamente. Garnacho se viene fa il titolare al posto di Neres, secondo me\".\n\"Scudetto? L’Inter non ha due squadre come ha detto Conte, come organico è il più lungo di tutti ma, se giocano le seconde linee, va in difficoltà. Secondo me, se il Napoli riesce a non perdere a Bergamo con l’Atalanta, certifica che il campionato sarà una lotta a due tra Inter e Napoli. Il Napoli ha perso un anno dopo lo Scudetto, De Laurentiis ha pensato che il Napoli potesse fare meglio. Se avesse preso Conte l’anno scorso, avrebbe potuto continuare il ciclo\", ha sottolineato Orsi.\nRedazione\nTestata giornalistica iscritta al tribunale di Napoli, tra i principali punti di riferimento sul Calcio Napoli, sulla città e sullo sport in generale, stabilmente tra i principali siti di informazione in Italia.\nAreaNapoli.it ti offre tutte le news sul Calcio Napoli in tempo reale.
