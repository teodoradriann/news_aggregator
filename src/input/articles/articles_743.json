A través de Instagram Massiel Taveras mostró fotografías de ella con el vestido que culminaba con la capa, la cual fue realizada por dominicanos. El rostro de Jesucristo con espinas en la capa fue diseño de Giannina Azar y plasmado por el pintor Yan Páez, ambos de República Dominicana. La obra de arte bautizada como “El Cristo” lució por la alfombra roja del Festival de Cannes; sin embargo, un par de personas -posiblemente seguridad del evento- intentó tapar la imagen religiosa. En redes sociales se viralizó el video en el que los detractores querían impedir que luciera “El Cristo”.

Asimismo agradeció el trabajo de sus connacionales dominicanos Giannina Azar y Yan Páez por lograr este trabajo artístico. La también productora Taveras compartió un escrito en su cuenta de Instagram, en el que se detalla que la capa mide 15 pies de largo (unos 4 metros con 57 centímetros). Si bien no se determinó el valor económico de la prenda, en el escrito compartido por Massiel Taveras se menciona que pudiera ser vendido en hasta 450 mil dólares.",

    "text": "Christmas 2023: Christ’s vulnerable heart can bring peace to all Christmas Message of Bishop William McGrattan Bishop of Calgary and President of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops Dear Sisters and Brothers in Christ, The birth of Jesus into human history was the fulfilment of the hopes and longings, dreams, and desires of the people of ancient Israel. Luke’s version of the Nativity of the Lord is Mary’s Nativity of joy. We know the story so well, but we often forget what lies at the heart of its very simple message. It is a story of poverty and simplicity, excitement and surprises, sadness and joy; a story of military occupation and oppression, a light in the darkness. Luke's message is clear: no event in our shadow-filled history of the world is alien to the coming of the Savior. No power, however violent and oppressive, escapes the reach of God's purposes. Matthew’s story of Jesus’ origins is about the scriptures being fulfilled in the child born in Bethlehem. In Matthew 1:23 we have the evocative word “Emmanuel” – “God is with us.” In the name “Emmanuel,” we find the answer to humanity’s deepest longings for God throughout the ages. Emmanuel is both a prayer and plea on our behalf and a promise and declaration on God’s part. When we pronounce the word, we are really praying and pleading: “God, be with us!” And when God speaks it, the Almighty, eternal Creator of the world is telling us: “I am with you” in this Child. That first Christmas reminds us of truths of which we can never hear enough. The Gospel stories of Jesus’ birth invite us to become pilgrims and follow shepherds and kings, saints and sinners, and that long procession of witnesses of all generations as they seek the light in the darkness and share their message of good news with a world steeped in darkness. The birth of this child in Bethlehem is extremely powerful as a source of consolation and hope in an age so concerned with the questions of peace, justice, and the future of the human race. The child of Bethlehem is for us \"Wonderful Counsellor\", deeply concerned with the ultimate good and wholeness of others. His gentle advice to us never leads us into destruction but only into the fullness of life. He is \"Mighty God\", directing our human history, but also living it with us. He is more powerful than any military force, war or occupation, and yet his force and might are revealed in hearts and eyes meeting. He is \"Everlasting Father\", teaching us what it means to be constantly present to others, giving life, blessing life, and celebrating life. He is unable to abandon us, as so many human beings are capable of doing. He is \"Prince of Peace\", the bringer of reconciliation, wholeness, harmony, and completion to the human family. Against the reality of armed conflict beyond our capacity to imagine in many parts of the world, the naming of this child as Prince of Peace is also extremely significant for the survival of the whole human family. Pope Francis has reminded us: “…as we contemplate Jesus, God made man, small, poor, defenceless, we cannot but think of the tragedy that the inhabitants of the Holy Land are living, expressing to those brothers and sisters of ours, especially the children and their parents, our closeness and our spiritual support. They are the ones who pay the true price of war.” If we allow the Christ child to truly dwell within us this year, then we shall know that in the midst of our own deep darkness and fears, from a crib in Bethlehem and a cross in Jerusalem, God's vulnerable heart can bring light, healing, wonderment, salvation, and peace to each of us, and to the whole world. On behalf of the Bishops of Canada and the Church in our vast land from sea to sea to sea, I wish you a blessed, joyful, and peaceful Christmas.",

    "text": "- Bitcoin, Ripple, and Solana show strong signs of growth, with the potential to double in value amid improving market signals.\n- Solana upgrade and ETF hopes for XRP boost investor optimism as BTC eyes key technical breakouts above resistance.\nThe cryptocurrency market has faced significant volatility recently. Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $81,100 after climbing to $88,000.The global crypto market cap also dropped from $3 trillion to $2.8 trillion in March.\nEthereum (ETH) also maintained a slight edge over Bitcoin, trading at $1,876 as of Wednesday. However, these three cryptocurrencies are now positioned for a possible 2x move in the coming weeks.\n1. Bitcoin (BTC): Is a Breakout Rally on the Horizon?\nBitcoin has seen a 22.7% drop from its all-time high of $108,786, yet market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. According to ETHNews, some analysts predict a long-term rise to $150,000, with even higher targets like a $100 trillion market cap for the crypto.\nOn Wednesday, Bitcoin remained mostly flat as markets awaited U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement. The event, set for April 2 at 4 p.m. Eastern Time, has been dubbed “Liberation Day” by the White House. The expected announcement has caused unease across global markets, with European stocks trending lower and Wall Street firms bracing for volatility, according to Bloomberg.\n— The White House (@WhiteHouse)\n[March 25, 2025]\nEarlier this week, Bitcoin briefly touched $85,000 before dipping to $81,188, later rebounding and gaining 3.19% in 24 hours. This price movement, while volatile, has highlighted the bulls’ defense of key support levels.\nAli Martinez, a well-known crypto analyst, noted that BTC is approaching two critical moving averages. A breakout above the 200-day MA at $86,200 and the 50-day MA at $88,300 could signal renewed bullish momentum.\nMeanwhile, large holders have been accumulating BTC. Transfers from retail wallets to long-term custodians suggest growing confidence in holding rather than selling.\nMoreover, on-chain data has offered some reassurance. Bitcoin’s hashrate recently hit a new all-time high, signaling that miners remain committed and confident in the network’s future\n2. Ripple (XRP): The Crypto Poised for a Rally\nRipple’s XRP is gaining attention as one of the top crypto with strong growth potential in the coming months. As discussed by ETHNews, following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropping its lawsuit against Ripple, market sentiment turned positive\nAnalysts are also watching the possibility of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). The odds for a spot ETF approval on Polymarket hit 85% this week, boosting optimism among traders. Multiple analysts have echoed this projection, fueling a renewed bullish outlook.\nXRP’s price was last seen trading at $2.34, reflecting a slight 0.2% gain in the past 24 hours. Traders believe this consolidation could be the start of a broader rally. One crypto analyst, known as Dark Defender, has given a bullish forecast on X.\nBased on wave analysis, the analyst predicts XRP’s third wave will range between $5.85 and $8.076. The fifth wave, expected to follow later, could push prices even higher—possibly between $18.22 and $23.20.\nOn-chain data shows increased activity among XRP holders as Q1 closes, supporting these projections. Traders are preparing for a possible market-wide recovery, and many expect XRP to lead the altcoin sector.\n3. Solana (SOL): A Strong Contender for Growth\nSolana (SOL) has shown strong signs of recovery despite past setbacks. After reaching an all-time high of $293.31, SOL dropped over 57%, especially after the FTX collapse in 2022. The coin fell below $10 but has bounced back, showing resilience in recent months.\nIn the past 24 hours, Solana’s stablecoin supply jumped by $106.8 million. This signals rising investor interest and potential new capital flowing into the ecosystem. On-chain data shows over $100 million in SOL was bought in the last five days, with a major $89 million transaction on March 28.\nAt the same time, Solana’s network activity is growing, according to Artemis data. Between March 24 and now, the number of daily transactions rose from 87.6 million to 92.7 million, showing strong user engagement.\nIn a recent update, we covered, a proposed network upgrade is also gaining attention. The community is considering raising the per-block capacity from 48 million to 60 million compute units (CUs). If approved, this upgrade could boost scalability and potentially drive a 150% price surge in Q2 2025, with a breakout toward the $300 level.",
