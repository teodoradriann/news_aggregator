    "title": "Meritorious deeds as Dhul-Hijjah 1445AH beckons",
    "text": "“That they might witness that which are of benefit to them and remember the name of the Almighty on the appointed days, over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them (for sacrifice).” (Quran 22:28)\nBrethren, today being Dhul-Qidah 23, 1445AH, the probability that next week Friday may either be Dhul-Qidah 30 or Dhul-Hijjah 1 is 50:50. Thus, the focus of our sermon today will be on some meritorious deeds Muslims (particularly those who are not performing Hajj) are encouraged to embark upon especially in the first 10 days of Dhul-Hijjah which is the 12th month of Muslim lunar calendar.\nFirst and foremost, it should be noted that Dhul Hijjah is one of the four sacred months ordained by Allah (SWT) during which hostility and profanity are forbidden (Q9V36).\nIndeed, there are numerous reports from the Prophet (SAW) that emphasise the importance and virtues of the first 10 days of the 12th month. For example, he is reported to have said: “There are no days in which righteous deeds are more beloved to the Almighty than these ten days.” His companions consequently asked him: “Not even jihad for the sake of the Almighty?” He said: “Not even jihad for the sake of the Almighty, except in the case of a man who went out to fight giving himself and his wealth up for the cause, and came back with nothing.” He says again: “There are no days that are greater in the sight of Almighty and in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Him than these ten days, so during this time recite a great deal of Tahleel (glorifications of the Almighty).\nIn other words, one of the virtuous acts of worship expected of every believer during the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah is remembrance of Allah (SWT) through constant repetition of His name with full concentration and contemplation. The evidence to support this lies in the eternal injunction that in every statement or utterance of glorification, there is great reward for the believer here on earth and in the hereafter.\nAside from the above, there are reports credited to the Prophet to the effect that Muslims who are not on Hajj and are desirous of sacrificing animals on the day of Eid are required to observe some rituals including abstinence from cutting the hair on the body and the nails on the fingers and foot till after the day of sacrifice.\nProphet (upon him be peace and blessings of the Almighty) once said: “When you see the new moon of Dhul-Hijjah, if any one of you wants to offer a sacrifice, then he should not cut his hair and nails until he has offered his sacrifice. In fact, some jurists have gone further to posit that whoever does this deliberately has committed an infraction and shall be required to seek forgiveness though his sacrifice on the Eid shall remain valid.\nScholars of Islam including Imam al-Shafi, al-Nawawi, al-Suyuti among others, have explored different perspectives to this ruling. While some have suggested that the reason for the prohibition is the necessity for the believer to enter into a spiritual realm as if he is on hajj where the totality of his being and essence become consecrated to the service of the Almighty, others have posited that it suffices for the believer not to go against any injunction of the Prophet no matter how insignificant they may appear. Once he commands an action or forbids something, the touchstone of faithfulness for the believer would be in his compliance with same without question.\nThe above ruling, it has been argued, relates to all Muslims no matter their gender. Now if a believer has cut his hair or nails during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah because he was not planning to offer a sacrifice, then he decides later, during the ten days, to offer a sacrifice, then the ruling becomes effective. He must refrain from cutting his hair and nails from the moment he makes this decision.\nThe Almighty says: “So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it, and whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it.”\n(Quran 99:7-8).\nApart from the acts or actions that are forbidden during the month, it is highly recommended for believers to dedicate the first nine days of the month for Fasting.\nFasting during the days comes under the category of what is known in Islamic Jurisprudence as Mustahabb particularly for those who are not performing Hajj.\nThe Prophet used to fast on the ninth of Dhul-Hijjah. Hunaydah ibn Khaalid reported from his wife that some of the wives of the Prophet said: “The Prophet used to fast on the ninth of Dhul-Hijjah, on the day of ‘Ashura’, on three days of each month, and on the first two Mondays and Thursdays of each month.”\nBrethren, it is common knowledge in our faith that all the above acts of worship stand greater chance of being accepted when they are capped with acts of benevolence, when the believer remembers the poor and the needy, when we go out of our way to put smiles on the faces of those living on the margin of life. Indeed, these days, the days of Hajj are meant to remind us all of these – that the real meaning of Islam lies in the extent to which value is added to people’s life. These are some of the latent meanings in these days; it is to their celebration we must dedicate our lives.",

    "text": "Israel rejects Lebanon ceasefire plan, defying US pressure Israel has defied the U.S. and global calls, including from Australia, rejecting a ceasefire with Hezbollah while continuing strikes that have resulted in hundreds of deaths in Lebanon, raising fears of a regional war, [ News.Az ](https://news.az/) reports citing [ The New Daily. ](https://www.thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/middle-east-news/2024/09/27/israel-lebanon-war) That took deaths from hits overnight and during Thursday to 28. The strike killed the head of one of Hezbollah’s air force units, Mohammad Surur, two security sources said, the latest senior Hezbollah commander to be targeted in days of assassinations hitting the group’s top ranks. Smoke was seen rising after the hit near an area where several Hezbollah facilities are located and many civilians also live and work. Hezbollah’s al-Manar TV broadcast images of a damaged upper floor of a building. On the Israeli side of the border with Lebanon, the army staged an exercise simulating a ground invasion – a potential next stage after relentless air strikes and explosions of communications devices. Israel’s air force is planning to assist troops in the event of a ground operation and will stop any arms transfers from Iran, Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar said. “We are preparing shoulder to shoulder with Northern Command for a ground maneuver. Prepared, if activated. This is a decision to be made above us,” he told soldiers, in a video distributed by the Israeli military. Israel has vowed to secure its north and return thousands of citizens to communities there who have fled since Hezbollah launched a campaign of cross-border strikes last year in solidarity with Palestinian militants fighting in Gaza.",

    "text": "Odisha: Calls for OPCC Chief’s Resignation Grow After Poll Debacle News Akshaya Kumar Sahoo 27 Jun 2024 4:55 PM GMT x OPCC president Sarat Pattanayak. (Image: DC) Bhubaneswar: The cracks in the state unit of Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) are visible once again with the demand for the resignation of the OPCC president Sarat Pattanayak growing louder following the party’s poll debacle in the assembly and Lok Sabha polls.\nSenior Congress leader Panchanan Kanungo on Thursday said the OPCC chief should resign for the party’s bad performance in the general elections.\n“I don’t know whether the OPCC chief has resigned or not. In my opinion, since the party suffered a poll debacle and he himself lost the election, he should resign. I have written a letter to him asking him to hold a meeting to find out where we went wrong,” said Kanungo.\nFormer OPCC president Jayadev Jena also took an indirect dig at the current OPCC chief.\n“The All India Congress Committee (AICC) had given me the responsibility to do well in the assembly polls and form the government in Odisha. As I failed, I announced my resignation before the media on the very day the results were out, owning moral responsibility for the party’s poor performance. That was my own conscience. I can’t give comments on something else,” said Jena.\nThe OPCC chief Sarat Pattanayak, on the other hand, appears unmoved. He said the party had performed better in the 2024 polls.\n“The Congress has performed better this time compared to its 2019 tally when it won only nine of the 147 assembly seats. In 2024, with our alliance which won one seat this time, we managed to get 15 seats this time. I have already discussed with the party high command all these matters. I would like to appeal to all our leaders and workers not to cause any harm to the party by raising non-issues. We should prepare how to fight and win 2029 elections,” said Pattanayak.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",

    "title": "Trump Outlines Stark Contrast With Biden On Middle East Policy, Says Iran Got Rich ‘Because Joe Biden Allowed Them To’ | The Daily Wire",
    "text": "Streaming Now The decade's most triggering comedy Former President Donald Trump laid out his foreign policy differences with President Joe Biden Wednesday, blasting his political rival for allowing Iran to “get rich” under his watch. Trump spoke with [Just the News](https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/all-things-trump/newsmaker-interview-trump-puts-iran-europeans-and-antisemites) in a wide-ranging interview that touched on the increasingly unstable Middle East and Iran’s involvement with terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas. During his interview, Trump focused on his foreign policy record, saying that Biden’s strategy has created chaos in the Middle East and put the U.S. in an undesirable position. “Iran was allowed to get rich because Joe Biden allowed them to,” Trump said. “So he could say whatever he wants. But he’s the reason for this. He’s an incompetent president. He’s a compromised president, totally compromised. But he allowed them to get rich.” “But worse than being rich, because of the money, because of what they have, they will have within a short period of time nuclear weapons. And that is never something that can be allowed to happen,” Trump added. Under the Trump administration, the U.S. pulled out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, which [gave](https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-nuclear-deal-explained-11610564572) Iran access to over $100 billion in oil revenues that were previously frozen by U.S. sanctions. Trump had sought to restrict Iran’s missile program and push the Tehran regime to sever its ties to terrorism, but Iran refused to negotiate. Shortly after Biden won back the White House for Democrats, however, the administration began working out a new Iran Nuclear Deal. Iran backs terrorist groups such as Hamas and the Houthis, which are actively warring against Israel. The Houthis have also recently targeted ships in the Middle East, and the U.S. has [shot down](https://www.timesofisrael.com/witnesses-report-2-explosions-off-sinai-coast-strange-object-falling-into-water/) at least 12 drones and five missiles launched by the terrorist group. Earlier this week, Iran appeared to [claim responsibility](https://www.dailywire.com/news/iran-and-hamas-feud-over-what-fueled-oct-7-massacre-of-israelis) for Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, during which terrorists brutally murdered at least 1,200 people. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps reportedly said the terrorist attack on Israel was a response to the assassination of top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani by the U.S. in 2020, which was carried out under the orders of Trump. “Iran was broke. They didn’t have any money to get around. I put sanctions on. I put everything on, and told countries, China, many countries, India, France, ‘don’t buy oil … you buy any oil, we’re not going to do business with you. And we’re going to put tariffs on all the products that do get through, We’re not going to do business,’” said Trump, the frontrunner in the Republican presidential primary.
