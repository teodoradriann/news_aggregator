    "text": "NAIROBI, Kenya ( [Morning Star News](https://morningstarnews.org/)) – Before Sawuba Naigaga succumbed to injuries her 25-year-old son inflicted on her in Uganda this month, she described the assault to a friend from her hospital bed. The friend said Naigaga’s son, Ashirafu Basalirwa, returned home to Busia town, Busia District from four years of working in Saudi Arabia on Dec. 15 and found his mother mentioning the name of Jesus as she prayed. “As I was praying with my eyes closed, my son called me, saying ‘Mum, Mum – you are becoming a disgrace to the family and the religion of Allah,’” the 46-year-old Naigaga told her friend before she died on Dec. 17. “I kept quiet, and he pushed me hard to the wall, then I fell down. He then took a blunt object and hit me at the head. Since then, I lost all my consciousness, only to find myself in the hospital bed.” The friend said she had told Naigaga the gospel and led her to Christ. “I preached the Good News of Jesus to Sawuba, who gave her life to Christ in 2022,” said the friend, whose name is withheld for security reasons. “We had been attending church. One thing which I know is that she kept her faith silent from her family members, including her son.” Basalirwa had gone to Saudi Arabia to look for employment after graduating from an Islamic university in Uganda, the friend said. She found Naigaga the day of the assault. “I ran to Sawuba’s home after hearing wailing from her house and an alarm from neighbors,” the friend recalled. “I dashed quickly to the scene, and I found her in a pool of blood but in an unconscious state. We rushed her to a nearby hospital, but she breathed her last breath after two days on Dec. 17 due to internal bleeding.” Basalirwa has fled and is in hiding, sources said. Besides her son, Naigaga is survived by a daughter. The killing was the latest of [many](https://morningstarnews.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7ec6d7eb2533a90581f839110&id=95cd8d3618&e=d656281a7e) instances of persecution of Christians in Uganda that Morning Star News has documented.

    "text": "Research/Study Right-wing media attack Tim Walz for his support of gun safety, ignoring the horrific mass shootings that affected his stance Conservatives accused Walz, a longtime gun owner and hunter, of being a “political chameleon” and “flip-flopping” because he supports “common-sense solutions to end gun violence” Published After Vice President Kamala Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her 2024 running mate, right-wing media lobbed a range of attacks at Walz, including calling him “radical” for his current stance on gun control — despite Walz being a longtime gun owner and reiterating his commitment to both the Second Amendment and “common-sense solutions to end gun violence” during his first speech after joining the ticket. As right-wing media and conservative organizations attack Walz, they have left out vital context about how mass shootings contributed to his embrace of gun safety reforms, or claimed that he arbitrarily “flipped on guns” for political gain. - Tim Walz publicly changed his stance on gun control after the mass shootings in Parkland and Las Vegas - - Walz — a longtime gun owner, soldier, and hunter who was “one of the best shots in Congress” — began publicly distancing himself from his prior pro-gun policies after the 2017 Las Vegas concert mass shooting by publicly advocating for universal background checks, opposing concealed carry, and calling for the restriction of silencers. Running for governor in 2017, Walz also answered Minnesota state Rep. Erin Murphy’s call to return the campaign contributions he received from the NRA, which he instead donated to a charity supporting the families of fallen military service members. Prior to the Las Vegas shooting — which left 59 dead and over 500 people wounded — Walz supported several laws that would have expanded firearm access in Washington, D.C.; voted in favor of allowing military veterans deemed “mentally incompetent” to own a weapon to purchase firearms; and was involved in the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, which aims to protect hunting and fishing rights.

[The Star Tribune, [2/23/18](https://www.startribune.com/tim-walz-please-understand-my-full-record-on-guns/475013423); CBS News, [8/7/24](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tim-walz-on-gun-control/)] - After being named Harris’ running mate on August 6, Walz noted that “he was one of the best shots in Congress” and “believes in the Second Amendment,” but also reaffirmed his commitment to “common sense gun violence laws.” Echoing his reaction to the Parkland school shooting, Walz also stated that part of the Harris campaign’s vision includes the freedom “for our children to be free to go to school without worrying they’ll be shot dead in their classrooms.” [The Washington Post, [8/6/24](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/06/harris-walz-vp/); MSNBC, Decision 2024, [8/6/24](https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4022824)] - Right-wing media figures have since lobbed flailing attacks against Walz’s record as governor, his military service, and even his hugs in an attempt to undermine the Democratic vice presidential candidate and falsely brand him as “radical.” False accusations coming from the right that Walz committed “stolen valor” have been used to discredit his stated positions on gun control and gun safety policy.

McLaughlin also claimed that Walz “banked hard to the left” on other issues after becoming governor of Minnesota, adding, “There’s a lot for him to answer for.” [New York Post, [8/6/24](https://nypost.com/2024/08/06/opinion/tim-walz-is-a-far-left-progressive-whom-harris-and-the-media-will-lie-to-make-a-moderate/)] - Newsmax host Carl Higbie scoffed that Walz had “an involved, let's call it, record on gun legislation,” and later said that “it’s important to note the inconsistency in his record.” While contrasting Walz’s current position with his previous “A” ratings from the NRA, Higbie again joked that “Democrats call it ‘evolving,’ or whatever they like to call it.” [Newsmax, Carl Higbie Frontline, [8/6/24](https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4022804)] - On Newsmax, NRA President Bob Barr claimed Walz’s record on gun policies changed when he ran for statewide office, adding: “This is not a man who is rooted in strong principles, but he very clearly based on his record as governor is anti-Second Amendment, anti-freedom.” The right-wing network promoted Barr’s comments on its website under the headline “NRA Pres. to Newsmax: Walz Is No Friend of the Second Amendment.” [Newsmax, Carl Higbie Frontline, [8/6/24](https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4022804), Newsmax, [8/6/24](https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/bob-barr-nra-tim-walz/2024/08/06/id/1175499/)] - In an op-ed for The Daily Caller, Barr dismissed the idea that Walz’s views on guns had “evolved” between his time in Congress and as governor, with Barr calling it “the language du jure for what previously was known quite accurately as ‘flip-flopping.’” [The Daily Caller, [8/8/24](https://dailycaller.com/2024/08/08/barr-kamala-harris-tim-walz-second-amendment-ar-15-ban-weapon-war/)] - In an article for The Daily Caller titled “Tim Walz Once Received ‘A’ Grade From NRA — Then He Shot Left,” Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus’ Rob Doar was quoted calling Walz “a political shapeshifter,” claiming that the governor was only ever a pro-gun advocate “because that’s what he had to be to win.” Doar said “the problem with Walz is you can’t trust what he says,” and that he “touts that he’s a gun owner and a hunter but will fully sign on and endorse extreme gun control proposals that anti-gun politicians will put forward. I just don’t think he can be trusted to protect Second Amendment rights.” [The Daily Caller, [8/6/24](https://dailycaller.com/2024/08/06/tim-walz-received-a-grade-from-nra-shot-left/)] - A Fox News headline highlighted a statement from the NRA calling Walz a “political chameleon” on guns. Following the announcement that Harris had chosen Walz to be her running mate in the 2024 presidential election, the NRA issued a statement dismissing the Minnesota governor as a “political chameleon” on guns and claiming he changed his views to further his career.

    "title": "E' scontro tra Musolino e Messina Social City su \"Fratelli Tutti\". L'azienda replica: \"Solo speculazioni\"",
    "text": "Il cenone della discordia. L'attacco è della senatrice Dafne Musolino che dopo aver lasciato il gruppo De Luca ha preso a picconare l'Amministrazione comunale e i suoi derivati (verrebbe da chiedersi se i problemi sono nati tutti oggi, dopo l'addio). E così questa volta è toccato alla Messina Social City, finire nel mirino. L'attacco della senatrice di Italia Viva è pesante e riguarda il cenone di Natale servito agli ospiti del \"Fratelli tutti\" la casa d'accoglienza gestita dall'amministrazione comunale.: \"Sono le 22:00 del 24 dicembre e nella struttura comunale di Collereale viene servito il cenone di Natale, che è quello che vedete nella foto. Pasta fredda, pomodori e mozzarella tutto regolarmente imbustato come sempre. Che tristezza vero? Sicuramente molti di voi penseranno che non può essere vero, ma si sa, la società moderna dichiara di volere combattere la povertà ma più spesso combatte i poveri! Nel silenzio indifferente delle istituzioni cittadine, che non provano neppure a chiedere scusa per questa cena fredda e soprattutto arida, abbiamo assistito alla inaugurazione della fontana danzante dal costo astronomico di oltre duecentomila euro\". Sin qui il primo affondo, poi seguito da altri: \"A pochi giorni infatti dal “ricco cenone natalizio di Collereale”, l’Amministrazione si è superata: prolungamento degli orari del tram e dello Shuttle fino a tarda sera e richiamo in servizio della Polizia Municipale con revoca delle ferie già concesse, oltre al giusto compenso per uno dei gruppi musicali più longevi d’Italia. Perché apparire al giorno d’oggi per certa politica è immensamente meglio che essere e i poveri, forse, nemmeno votano, dovendo pensare a sopravvivere... I romani, grandi conquistatori e amministratori, ammansivano il popolo con il famoso panem et circenses. Ma qui vi siete dimenticati il panem, che è di gran lunga più importante di qualsiasi spettacolo circense\".\nLa replica di Messina Social City\nImmediata la risposta della Messina Social City che fornisce la sua ricostruzione: \"Fratelli Tutti è un posto sicuro, un luogo che la Messina Social City ha fortemente voluto e trasformato in una vera dimora per molti fragili, un luogo in cui quotidianamente vengono tradotti in realtà percorsi di autodeterminazione per permettere a uomini e donne di riappropriarsi della loro vita, un luogo in cui 13 nazionalità convivono in armonia con un costante scambio culturale e umano che fa della diversità un valore aggiunto, un luogo che accoglie 60 ospiti invece di 25, un luogo aperto 24 ore su 24, un luogo che eroga pasti a colazione, pranzo e cena, un luogo in cui l’equipe multidisciplinare dell’azienda si interfaccia con operatori di diverse realtà territoriali. Fratelli tutti custodisce gelosamente centinaia di storie di vita vissuta di chi per un giorno, una settimana o solo qualche ora vive i nostri spazi. L’attacco di oggi alla Messina Social City non colpisce la Presidente, il Consiglio d’Amministrazione, colpisce tutta l’azienda, l’Amministrazione Comunale! Colpisce ogni area dei nostri servizi, colpisce il personale tutto, colpisce chi giornalmente beneficia di un servizio. L’impegno quotidiano dei tanti operatori che si spendono con professionalità, amore e dedizione per migliorare la qualità di vita degli ospiti non può essere minato da una polemica strumentale, cavalcata incomprensibilmente anche da esponenti politici che non hanno mai mostrato interesse nel conoscere e vivere le nostre strutture. Le notizie vanno riferite per quelle che sono e non strumentalizzarle a beneficio di chi vuol far apparire la Messina Social City poco trasparente e poco presente sul territorio. Che tristezza leggere, o meglio definire i poveri un “comparto”!",

    "title": "Purdue Fort Wayne ceramics students raise money with Empty Bowls",
    "text": "Purdue University Fort Wayne student Nicole Pitcher could only guess Thursday how many ceramic bowls she contributed to an annual fundraiser benefiting the campus food pantry.\n\"I think I made 25 bowls,\" Pitcher said as people browsed the handcrafted items during the Empty Bowls event at Walb Student Union.\nHer uncertainty was understandable. She and her advanced ceramics classmates described themselves as \"production potters\" as they prepared for the fundraiser, which provided a soup lunch and one-of-a-kind bowl for a $30 donation.\nThe final inventory totaled about 250 bowls, including some from area high schools, said Seth Green, associate professor of ceramics.\nA video showcasing the bowl-making process played on repeat, highlighting such steps as throwing and shaping clay on pottery wheels and dipping the dishes in glaze.\n\"The making of the bowls takes all semester,\" Green said.\nThat wasn't his students' only responsibility for the seventh annual event. His advanced ceramics class, which typically has about 12 to 15 students per semester, also wrote grants to pay for the materials, handled the marketing and sought donations for the lunch, which also included bread, cookies and bottled water.\n\"The students plan everything,\" Green said.\nHe described Empty Bowls as a service-learning project that teaches students how to plan, prepare and run a big event with community partners – something they will likely encounter after graduation.\n\"It's an effort that takes a lot of people,\" Green said, noting former students were also invited to bowl-making opportunities.\nProceeds will benefit the university's Ceramics Club and the Friends of the University Pantry at Purdue Fort Wayne, which last year provided frozen, packaged and canned food to nearly 9,000 people.\nThe pantry's website,\nwww.pfw.edu/the-pantry, indicates it accepts donations of nonperishable food including pasta, peanut butter and granola bars along with such personal care items as shampoo, soap and toothpaste.\nIt is open to everyone from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Thursdays in Room G36 of Walb Union. Student-only hours are 4 to 7 p.m. Mondays and Tuesdays at the student housing clubhouse, according to its website.\nEmpty Bowls last year raised $7,184 last year, according to the university.\nPitcher didn't risk waiting until the end of the four-hour event to purchase one of Green's bowls, which played with texture.\n\"I made sure to get a bowl while I could,\" she said.",
