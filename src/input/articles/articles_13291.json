My love and adoration for him only grows.\" Video above: Emma Heming Willis 'not good' amid husband Bruce Willis' dementia battle The couple wed in 2009 and share two daughters together, Mabel and Evelyn. Heming also posted a vulnerable message to her [\"Die Hard\"](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/24/entertainment/peter-billingsley-die-hard-christmas/index.html) actor's [health issues](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/12/entertainment/bruce-willis-moonlighting-creator/index.html), sharing in the video that she \"was able to have a good cry\" with a close friend. \"It is really important to be able to have someone that you can trust with your feelings instead of just bottling them up and putting your best foot forward and just kind of soldiering through stuff, which I have a tendency to do,\" Heming said in the video. In February, Willis's family – including Heming, ex-wife Demi Moore and his daughters – [announced](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/16/entertainment/bruce-willis-dementia/index.html) that the actor has been diagnosed with a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia, or [FTD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354737) for short. Heming, who has been open about her journey as Willis's primary caretaker on her social media ever since, said in her video this week that \"holidays are hard, anniversaries are hard.\" She added that \"building a community and connection\" has helped her get through it this year. \"That has been my lifeline and I just want to thank you for that,\" she said. Heming wrote in the caption to her Instagram video about receiving \"countless messages of love and support because Bruce is so beloved,\" and that these messages help her feel \"less alone.\" \"I wish I could answer all the messages because they are deep, raw and poetic but please know that I appreciate them so very much,\" she wrote. \"I am grateful to you.\"",

    "text": "( MENAFN - Live Mint) \"The United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA)'s pro-talks faction on Friday has signed a peace accord with the central and Assam governments agreeing to shun violence and join the mainstream.A 29-member delegation of the ULFA's pro-talks delegation, including 16 ULFA members and 13 from civil society, signed the agreement agreement between the ULFA pro-talks faction and the authorities is a significant step, as now the banned ULFA-Independent is the only major insurgent outfit remaining in the state.“It is a matter of joy for me that today is a bright day for the future of Assam. For a long time, Assam, Northeast faced violence and after Prime Minister Narendra Modi became PM in 2014, efforts were made to reduce the gap between Delhi and Northeast,” said Union Home Minister Amit Shah Shah said the ULFA, the oldest insurgent group of Assam, agreed to abjure violence, disband the organisation and join the democratic process. \\\"Assam has suffered for long due to the violence of the ULFA and 10,000 people lost their lives in this violence since 1979,\\\" he said.“Today is a historic day for Assam. During PM Modi's tenure, under the guidance of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, work for Assam's peace was always underway...three accords have been signed and with three accords tribal militancy has come to an end in Assam”, CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said separatist ULFA was formed in April 1979 in the aftermath of an agitation against undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan).The ULFA was formed with the demand for a \\\"sovereign Assam\\\". Since then, it has been involved in subversive activities that led to the central government declaring it a banned outfit in 1990 split into two groups in February 2011 with the Arabinda Rajkhowa-led faction giving up violence and agreeing to unconditional talks with the government.\nThe Rajkhowa faction joined peace talks with the government on September 3, 2011, after an agreement for Suspension of Operations (SoO) was signed between the ULFA and central and state governments Baruah, who leads the other rebranded ULFA-Independent faction, is against the talks. Baruah is believed to be residing at a place along the China-Myanmar border pro-talks faction has sought constitutional and political reforms for the protection of the identity and resources of Assam's indigenous people including their right to land. The Union government in April sent it a draft agreement. An earlier round of talks between the two sides was held in Delhi in August.A series of talks with officials concerned in the Central government has taken place since the delegation arrived in Delhi on December 26 before the signing of the pact Union government has signed peace deals with rebel Bodo, Dimasa, Karbi, and Adivasi outfits in Assam over the last three years.(With agency inputs)\nMENAFN29122023007365015876ID1107668755\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "The book of [Joe Flacco](/nfl/players/b1a509f3/joe-flacco) could have easily ended with the New York Jets last season. In other words, on a whimper. But the veteran quarterback has seized the pen supposedly used to write the NFL scripts and crafted a [thrilling and unexpected chapter](https://clutchpoints.com/browns-news-joe-flacco-comeback-player-of-the-year-after-damar-hamlin) with the [Cleveland Browns](/nfl/cleveland-browns) this season. Flacco, the protagonist this worn down fan base didn't know it needed, produced arguably biggest triumph since joining the team's practice squad on Nov. 20. He [thwacked the Jets](https://clutchpoints.com/5-ways-jets-embarrasse-joe-flacco-browns-thursday-night-football) on Thursday Night Football, throwing for 309 yards and three touchdowns in a 37-20 home victory that clinched at least an AFC Wild Card slot in the playoffs. The Super Bowl 47 MVP added another robust outing to a five-game sample size that stunningly includes 1,616 passing yards and 13 touchdowns. His 60.3 completion percentage and eight interceptions are issues that need to be fixed if the Browns are to go on a deep run, but Flacco is unlocking the full powers of this offense. Browns QB Joe Flacco is making most out of magical run Coach of the Year contender [Kevin Stefanski](/tag/kevin-stefanski) [touched on how important](https://twitter.com/ScottPetrak/status/1740594697586835823) the TNF, postseason-clinching win was to the 38-year-old QB. “Joe's, I think, very excited to have his family here watching him. It's a special moment for them,” he said, per The Chronicle-Telegram's Scott Petrak. “It's a great story, I know you guys love the story, but I'm just happy for Joe…He's got something left in the tank.” [No one expected](https://clutchpoints.com/jets-news-sauce-gardner-eye-opening-admission-browns-joe-flacco-torching-team) that tank to look so vigorous in year 16 of his NFL career, especially after a lackluster end with the Baltimore Ravens and unsuccessful runs with the Denver Broncos and Jets. His durability mirrors that of this Cleveland team, which is somehow still in contention for the AFC North after suffering so many injuries. Joe Flacco will try to sprinkle some more pixie dust on this entire community in Week 18, when the Browns visit the Cincinnati Bengals in their last game of the regular season. We now for sure, though, that it will not be the final chapter for him or this resilient group.",
