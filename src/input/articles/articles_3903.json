    "title": "Mysterious morel mushrooms at center of food poisoning outbreak",
    "text": "A food poisoning outbreak that killed two people and sickened 51, stemming from a Montana restaurant, has highlighted just how little is known about morel mushrooms and the risks in preparing the popular and expensive delicacy.\nThe FDA conducted an investigation into morel mushrooms after the severe illness outbreak linked to Dave’s Sushi in Bozeman in late March and April. The investigation found that undercooked or raw morels were the likely culprit, and it led the agency to issue its first guidelines on preparing morels.\n“The toxins in morel mushrooms that may cause illness are not fully understood; however, using proper preparation procedures, such as cooking, can help to reduce toxin levels,” according to the FDA guidance.\nEven then, a risk remains, according to the FDA: “Properly preparing and cooking morel mushrooms can reduce risk of illness, however there is no guarantee of safety even if cooking steps are taken prior to consumption.”\nPeople are also reading…\nJon Ebelt, spokesperson for Montana’s health department, said there is limited public health information or medical literature on morels. And samples of the morels taken from Dave’s Sushi detected no specific toxin, pathogen, pesticide, or volatile or nonvolatile organic compound in the mushrooms.\nAaron Parker, the owner of Dave’s Sushi, said morels are a “boutique item.” In season, generally during the spring and fall, morels can cost him $40 per pound, while morels purchased out of season are close to $80 per pound, he said.\nMany highly regarded recipe books describe sauteing morels to preserve the sought-after, earthy flavor. At Dave’s, a marinade, sometimes boiling, was poured over the raw mushrooms before they were served, Parker said. After his own investigation, Parker said he found boiling them between 10 and 30 minutes is the safest way to prepare morel mushrooms.\nParker said he reached out to chefs across the country and found that many, like him, were surprised to learn about the toxicity of morels.\n“They had no idea that morel mushrooms had this sort of inherent risk factor regardless of preparation,” Parker said.\nAccording to the FDA’s Food Code, the vast majority of the more than 5,000 fleshy mushroom species that grow naturally in North America have not been tested for toxicity. Of those that have, 15 species are deadly, 60 are toxic whether raw or cooked — including “false” morels, which look like spongy edible morels — and at least 40 are poisonous if eaten raw, but safer when cooked.\nThe North American Mycological Association, a national nonprofit whose members are mushroom experts, recorded 1,641 cases of mushroom poisonings and 17 deaths from 1985 to 2006. One hundred and twenty-nine of those poisonings were attributed to morels, but no deaths were reported.\nMarian Maxwell, the outreach chairperson for the Puget Sound Mycological Society, based in Seattle, said cooking breaks down the chitin in mushrooms, the same compound found in the exoskeletons of shellfish, and helps destroy toxins. Maxwell said morels may naturally contain a type of hydrazine — a chemical often used in pesticides or rocket fuel that can cause cancer— which can affect people differently. Cooking does boil off the hydrazine, she said, “but some people still have reactions even though it’s cooked and most of that hydrazine is gone.”\nHeather Hallen-Adams, chair of the toxicology committee of the North American Mycological Association, said hydrazine has been shown to exist in false morels, but it’s not as “clear-cut” in true morels, which were the mushrooms used at Dave’s Sushi.\nMushroom-caused food poisonings in restaurant settings are rare — the Montana outbreak is believed to be one of the first in the U.S. related to morels — but they have happened infrequently abroad. In 2019, a morel food poisoning outbreak at a Michelin-star-rated restaurant in Spain sickened about 30 customers. One woman who ate the morels died, but her death was determined to be from natural causes. Raw morels were served on a pasta salad in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2019 and poisoned 77 consumers, though none died.\nBefore the new guidelines were issued, the FDA’s Food Code guidance to states was only that serving wild mushrooms must be approved by a “regulatory authority.”\nThe FDA’s Food Code bans the sale of wild-picked mushrooms in a restaurant or other food establishment unless it’s been approved to do so, though cultivated wild mushrooms can be sold if the cultivation operations are overseen by a regulatory agency, as was the case with the morels at Dave’s Sushi. States’ regulations vary, according to a 2021 study by the Georgia Department of Public Health and included in the Association of Food and Drug Officials’ regulatory guidelines. For example, Montana and a half-dozen other states allow restaurants to sell wild mushrooms if they come from a licensed seller, according to the study. Seventeen other states allow the sale of wild mushrooms that have been identified by a state-credentialed expert.\nThe study found that the varied resources states use to identify safe wild mushrooms — including mycological associations, academics, and the food service industry — may suggest a need for better communication.\nThe study recognized a “guidance document” as the “single most important step forward” given the variety in regulations and the demand for wild mushrooms.\nHallen-Adams said raw morels are known to be poisonous by “mushroom people,” but that’s not common knowledge among chefs.\nIn the Dave’s Sushi case, Hallen-Adams said, it was obvious that safety information didn’t get to the people who needed it. “And this could be something that could be addressed by labeling,” she said.\nThere hasn’t been much emphasis placed on making sure consumers know how to properly prepare the mushrooms, Hallen-Adams said, “and that’s something we need to start doing.”",

    "title": "Don Kusler: Democrats dominated 2023 with victories for reproductive rights, labor",
    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box.\nVirginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office.\nThat's a victory for Democrats.\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate.\nThat's another victory for the left.\nTwo ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state.\nPeople are also reading…\nThen on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin.\nThese electoral victories make a difference.\nJust look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize.\nLabor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts.\nWorkers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers.\nSometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans.\nIt was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes.\nThe Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business.\nLeadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people.\nThe one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job.\nDid the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker.\nThe sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats.\nSo a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories.\nYes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats.\nKusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action:\nadaction.org.

    "text": "There are multiple instances where the Supreme manifests itself I was watching ‘pran pratistha’ of Lord Rama’s Deity in the new temple constructed at the birthplace of the Lord. As the ceremony progressed, I began to notice subtle changes in the Lord’s expression; He was coming alive. I was amazed, but I couldn’t fail to notice the change as it happened. My experience was corroborated by the sculptor, who made this idol. He admitted that what he had sculpted was a lot different, meaning that the expression he had given was quite sober. By the way, pran pratistha is a transformative act of bringing the idol to life. This manifestation is nothing amazing. God appears even in person. The following five true life stories will exemplify this. The first one chosen is when Lord Krishna appeared as Draupadi was being attempted to be disrobed in the royal court of Dhrtarashtra. Draupadi in desperation prayed for help by chanting — “Krishna, Krishna, Krishna”. The Lord appeared and provided endless sarees to save Draupadi from humiliation. The second incident chosen is when Surdasa falls into a ditch, him being blind. He attempted to get out but failed. He called for help, but no one came. The place was deserted. His worshipable Lord knew that His true devotee needed help. He came and saw Surdasa sitting down and singing bhajan completely oblivious of the sorry situation he was in. Lord asked him, “Why are you not trying to get out?” Surdasa replied, “I did and failed. I realised that only you could help me.” The Lord gave Surdasa His hand and helped him to come out. There is a famous bhajan when Surdasa implores the Lord not to leave him. The third incident happened a few years back. A close relative of mine was sitting in a temple near her home deeply engrossed in thought. A babaji appeared in front of her. He spoke to her, “You are greatly troubled by the behaviour of your in-laws. Don’t worry. You will suffer a certain disease, he named it, due to the stress caused by it. But it will be cured; will not make you suffer much. Before this relative could react, this person had gone away. That disease did trouble her but came under control soon. This relative is a sincere devotee of God. The fourth example is related to a friend of mine. He is a staunch devotee of God. Over the last five decades, he has made enormous spiritual progress. He is in his late nineties and still going strong. His wife passed away recently after a brief illness. He tried to prevent it by chanting a mantra. He also hoped that she would get an excellent birth next time. As he was overdoing it, God arranged for an aged lady to come to his house. She informed him that his wife would pass away on the fifteenth day. He was shocked. By the time he gathered his wits, she was gone. Was she God Himself or a person chosen by God? The last example is of an American. He had become very rich, but he was neither peaceful nor happy. Intrigued, he had to find the reason. Was material wealth not the solution to all our problems and he had plenty of it? He started visiting various churches but got no satisfactory answer. Disappointed, he decided to come to India - the spiritual capital of the world. Same result here also with bogus gurus trying to manipulate him. Highly frustrated, he was sitting down on a bench on the bank of the Ganges in Haridwar. He was in deep thought when someone tapped him on his shoulder. He opened his eyes and saw a saintly person standing in front of him. He said, “Don’t be so sad. Take shelter of God. And the best way is to follow God’s instructions as detailed in the bona fide scriptures. Buy a copy of the Bhagavad-Geeta.” When he opened his eyes, the saintly person was not to be seen. Can we have similar experiences with God? Yes, we can. God is always quite forthcoming. We just have to qualify for it. How do you do that? It is simpler than what you can imagine. Do spiritual practices, which suit your nature. For example, I do ‘darshan’ and ‘naman’, chanting, thanking and praying regularly. Once a certain amount of spiritual credits has been accumulated, God gets active in our lives, (The writer is a spiritual guide; views are personal)",

    "title": "Inundaciones, incendios forestales y sequías: expertos advierten que los fenómenos climáticos extremos serán más frecuentes en Brasil",
    "text": "Luego de las inundaciones históricas que azotaron a Porto Alegre , los expertos advirtieron que los fenómenos climáticos extremos tales como los récord de incendios forestales, las olas de calor sin precedentes y las sequías no solo se están multiplicando en Brasil, sino que serán más frecuentes en el futuro. El gigante sudamericano atravesó distintos eventos sin precedentes en los últimos años. En ese sentido, el más reciente tuvo lugar con las inundaciones en Rio Grande do Sul. Considerado el peor desastre climático en la historia de ese estado, el fenómeno se cobró al menos un centenar de vidas y arrasó con la economía del estado agropecuario, el cual demorará meses e incluso años en recuperarse, según las autoridades, que hablan de la necesidad de \"un plan Marshall\" de asistencia. Inundaciones en Brasil: continúa la evacuación y hay riesgo de desabastecimiento tras las inundaciones Suscribite Otras tragedias golpearon recientemente a Brasil , un país de dimensiones continentales. Tan solo el año pasado fue escenario de 1.161 desastres naturales, más de tres por día en promedio. Ese es un récord desde que comenzaron los registros, en 2011, según el Centro Nacional de Monitoreo y Alertas de Desastres Naturales (Cemaden). La propia geografía brasileña explica en parte esa vulnerabilidad, con regiones que se inundan en el sur y otras que sufren reiterados períodos de sequía, como la semiárida del este. También incide el fenómeno natural de El Niño . Sin embargo, debido al progresivo calentamiento del planeta, los acontecimientos extremos o raros \"son cada vez más frecuentes y más extremos, y es de esperar que eso continúe\", explicó a la AFP José Marengo, coordinador de investigación del Cemaden. Es que el cambio climático \"ya no es más un tema de discusión científica: salió de los libros y se hizo realidad\", alertó a dicha agencia Marcio Astrini, secretario ejecutivo del Observatorio del Clima, que integran más de un centenar de organizaciones ambientalistas y de investigación. Las inundaciones y lluvias extremas Las precipitaciones extremas en Brasil causaron el año pasado al menos 132 muertos y más de 9.000 heridos, mientras unas 74.000 personas perdieron sus hogares, según el Cemaden. Los daños materiales se estimaron en más de 5.000 millones de reales (alrededor de 1.000 millones de dólares). En Rio Grande do Sul , el balance probablemente será peor que en todo 2023: el saldo preliminar de las inundaciones reporta 107 muertos y 130 desaparecidos. El número de damnificados y de pérdidas económicas aún son incalculables. En años recientes, inundaciones golpearon también la ciudad de Recife (Pernambuco, noreste) y los estados de Minas Gerais (sureste) y Bahía (noreste). Estas lluvias extremas en el sur de Sudamérica son una predicción recurrente de los modelos climáticos desde hace décadas, según el Observatorio. A pesar de ello, esa información es \"ignorada por los sucesivos gobiernos estatales\", lamentó Suely Araújo, coordinadora de políticas públicas de la plataforma. \"Mientras no se comprenda la relevancia de la adaptación [al cambio climático], estas tragedias seguirán ocurriendo, cada vez peores\", subrayó Araújo. La inundación de Porto Alegre de 1941: la peor en la historia del estado, hasta la del 2024 Hasta la semana pasada, la peor inundación que afectó a la ciudad de Porto Alegre se produjo entre los meses de abril y mayo de 1941. Según registros de la época, recopilados por el museo Joaquim Felizardo, la capital de Rio Grande do Sul recibió 24 días de lluvia ininterrumpida . De esa manera, el agua había alcanzado una altura de 4,75 metros. Como consecuencia del fenómeno, 70.000 personas quedaron sin electricidad ni acceso a agua potable. Luego de ese hecho, el tiempo de ocurrencia (es decir, la probabilidad, en años, de que un evento de ese calibre vuelva a ocurrir) era de 370 años, según los cálculos del Gobierno, a partir de datos históricos de inundaciones del rio Guaíba. Sin embargo, la inundación de este mes alcanzó su máximo histórico el pasado domingo, con un nivel de 5,31 metros. Los incendios y la deforestación Las emisiones de dióxido de carbono al medioambiente son las principales responsables del calentamiento global . En ese sentido, la reducción de los bosques debido a la deforestación para la ampliación de actividades agropecuarias merma la capacidad de absorción de esos gases de efecto invernadero, por lo que el fuego continúa haciendo estragos. Entre enero y abril se registraron más de 17.000 incendios forestales, más de la mitad de ellos en la región amazónica, donde aumentaron 153% en un año, según el Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Espaciales brasileño (INPE). La Amazonía, la mayor selva tropical del planeta, sufrió además el año pasado una sequía histórica. Sin embargo, en su primer año de mandato, en 2023, el gobierno del izquierdista Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva redujo a la mitad la deforestación en la Amazonía , luego de que se disparara durante la gestión de su predecesor, el ultraderechista Jair Bolsonaro. La falta de alerta de los gobiernos Según los expertos, para evitar nuevas tragedias como la de Rio Grande do Sul, la población y los gobiernos deben primeramente tomarse en serio las alertas que emiten. \"Ya que no tenemos cómo parar la lluvia , hay que prepararnos previendo los desastres asociados, que las poblaciones no construyan escenarios de riesgo y que los gobiernos trabajen todo el tiempo, porque para los desastres hay que estar preparado siempre, no solamente cuando suceden\", explicó Marengo. Los videos más dramáticos de la inundación en Brasil, la peor en la historia del país Por su parte, Astrini abogó por implementar un plan de respuesta temprana para las áreas más vulnerables de Brasil, aunque consideró que \"estamos muy lejos de eso\". En esa línea, mencionó la falta de presupuesto para políticas de prevención o la aprobación de leyes que fomentan la ocupación cada vez mayor de zonas de riesgo por parte de la población o la deforestación. \"Brasil es un país que sufre mucho por el https://www.perfil.com/noticias/sociedad/el-cambio-climatico-afecta-la-laguna-de-gomez-un-destino-turistico-en-junin.phtml, que trae perjuicios sociales y económicos: gente que muere y gente que lo pierde todo\", lamentó el secretario ejecutivo del Observatorio del Clima.

    "text": "Madrid. En la recta final de la campaña electoral en el País Vasco, que este domingo elegirá nuevo Parlamento y gobierno autonómico, el candidato de la coalición de la izquierda independentista vasca, Pello Otxandiano, decidió “perdón” a las víctimas de la violencia ejercida por la organización armada ETA durante las casi cuatro décadas de existencia. Ante la presión política y mediática para que se desmarcara de forma nítida del entorno de ETA, el líder de EH-Bildu instó a la ciudadanía a la que aspira a gobernar “a avanzar hacia la reconciliación”. En una entrevista televisiva y después de que la postura de la izquierda abertzale en torno a ETA se convirtiera en el principal asunto de la campaña, Otxandiano explicó que su formación va “hacia la reconciliación y en la construcción de una memoria plural y en el respeto, en la reparación, en el reconocimiento, en la reparación de todas las víctimas sin excepción”. Y pidió al resto de partidos “sacar este tema del contexto electoral”. Otxandiano señaló que “si soy lehendakari asumo en primera persona la labor de llevar este proceso hasta el final”. El candidato de EH Bildu expresó además su “respeto absoluto y cercanía al dolor de todas las víctimas y en especial a las víctimas de ETA. Nosotros tenemos una postura muy contundente y muy asertiva en el camino hacia la reconciliación y en la construcción de una memoria plural y en el respeto, en la reparación, en el reconocimiento, en la reparación de todas las víctimas sin excepción”. El líder de la izquierda independentista vasca además reconoció que “una de las tradiciones políticas que hoy pertenece a EH Bildu fue agente de dolor en el pasado (en referencia a Sortu, antes Batasuna), después fue parte de la solución y hoy creo que EH Bildu está en disposición de ser agente de la reconciliación; y prueba de ello es que en mis listas hay gente amenazada por ETA en su día”. Según las últimas encuestas, la plataforma de EH-Bildu podría convertirse en el partido más votada en la región, lo que supondría un hito histórica para la izquierda independentista, que por primera vez superaría al históricamente hegemónico Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV).",
