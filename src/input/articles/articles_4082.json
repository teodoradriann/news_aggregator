    "title": "No, Elon Musk Didn't Say 'I Just Officially Bought Amazon'",
    "text": "A rumor claiming tech entrepreneur Elon Musk said he bought Amazon — the retail, media and technology company founded by fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos — circulated online in late 2024. According to social media posts and YouTube videos, Musk supposedly said, \"I just officially bought Amazon.\"\nFor example, on Nov. 15, 2024, a manager of the Elon Musk Rewind YouTube channel — a long-running channel with over 366,000 subscribers frequently publishing content about Musk — uploaded a video displaying the title, \"Elon Musk Just BOUGHT Amazon & Ends All Competition!\" As of Nov. 18, the clip had received numerous shares on X and at least tens of thousands of views, according to information provided by the Nepal-based Gazette Direct website.\nAs of Nov. 21, the link for the video showed the message, \"This video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated.\" Google or YouTube suspended the Elon Musk Rewind channel sometime between Nov. 18 and Nov. 21. We contacted Google to ask for more details about the alleged violations of the owner or owners of the channel and will update this story if we learn more.\nA user generated the video's thumbnail image — one purportedly showing Musk holding a contract for his Amazon deal — with an artificial-intelligence (AI) tool.\nThis thumbnail image did not display an authentic picture of Musk.\nAnother YouTube video initially shared on Facebook also was no longer available. That clip's title showed in a Facebook post (archived) as, \"Elon Musk: 'I Just Officially Bought Amazon!'\" The https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ska-93bdLCo for that video also displayed the same message about account termination. We inquired with Google about the removal of that yet-unidentified channel, as well.\nThis AI-generated picture also did not show a genuine photo of Musk.\nOne user asked Musk on X (https://archive.is/yPNGU) about the Amazon rumor, \"@elonmusk is this true? Good for you [and] congratulations if it is.\" Another person posted (https://archive.is/TZKY8), \"I'm hearing a rumor that Elon Musk just bought Amazon.\" Facebook users also inquired about the matter, including one person who said (https://archive.is/tsfmI), \"I'm watching a news report that Elon Musk just bought AMAZON. Is this true or is it AI?\" Other Facebook and YouTube users also shared the same claim.\nHowever, the rumor claiming Musk said he bought Amazon was false. We located no news reports or other credible information confirming anything about Musk buying the company.\nFurther, the users who created these clips used AI tools to generate not just their fake thumbnail images but also the audio narration. Additionally, they used AI to manage the clip selection and editing. Those users simply entered a text prompt as an order to one or more generative-AI tools to fully create the videos and thumbnail images.\nFor additional reading, we previously reported on other rumors claiming Musk bought various companies, including McDonald's, CNN, Ford and others.",

    "title": "Hatching of 60 Siamese crocodiles raises hopes for species recovery - Newspaper - DAWN.COM",
    "text": "PHNOM PENH: A group of 60 rare Siamese crocodiles have hatched in Cambodia, boosting hopes for one of the world’s most endangered reptiles, conservationists said on Thursday. Five Siamese crocodile nests were discovered in Cambodia’s Cardamom National Park in mid-May, the country’s environment and agriculture ministry said in a joint statement with conservation group Fauna and Flora. The nests contained 106 eggs, of which 66 were fertilised, and a total of 60 Siamese crocodile eggs successfully hatched between June 27 and 30, the ministry said. “This discovery indicates that the area is a key habitat for natural crocodiles, providing hope for the species’ recovery,” they said in the statement. Researchers say there are approximately 1,000 Siamese crocodiles worldwide, including around 300 individuals in the wild in Cambodia. Their survival is threatened by poachers who supply eggs and adult reptiles to crocodile farms around the region, where their skins are turned into luxury belts, shoes and handbags. Cambodian environment minister Eang Sophalleth said it was a source of “pride” that the country is home to some of the world’s rarest species, pledging continued efforts to “preserve biodiversity.” Deforestation and poaching have devastated many species in Cambodia, one of Asia’s poorest and most corrupt nations. In its haste to develop, the government has been criticised for allowing firms to clear hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest land — including in protected zones — for everything from rubber and sugar cane plantations to hydropower dams.

    "title": "This Pacific Northwest Gem Is A Quiet, Underrated Beach Town Full Of Charm And Art",
    "text": "This Pacific Northwest Gem Is A Quiet, Underrated Beach Town Full Of Charm And Art\nWhen imagining quiet beach towns for a quick getaway, you may be picturing white sand, palm trees, and warm, tropical breezes. While you can find\nsome spectacular beaches in states like Florida, there are many quaint beach towns in other parts of the country, too ( like the Midwest, for example).\nHowever, what if there was a small beach town on the northwest corner of the U.S. map, next to the Canadian border? What if this town had its own semi-enclosed bay that allowed you to enjoy calm waters and spectacular views of nature? If all that sounds appealing, Blaine, Washington may be the best choice for your next beach vacation.\nWhile you may not be sipping on Mai Tais as you bask in the shadow of a massive resort building, Blaine has plenty of activities and amenities to offer the discerning traveler. Just be aware that you might have to dress warmly for the beach, so the bikini and flip-flops may be better off left at home.\nWhat makes Blaine, Washington so special?\nWith a population of only around 5,000, Blaine may not seem like much on the map. It's somewhat close to Seattle, Washington (just under a two-hour drive), and it's right next to Canada. Yet, if you take a closer look, Blaine reveals a marvelous town steeped in history, tradition, and natural beauty. Many of the parks in the city also feature local artwork and sculptures that capture the spirit of the region.\nOne of several nicknames bestowed upon Blaine is the \"Gateway to the Pacific Northwest.\" However, this name is both literal and figurative. Yes, Blaine is the first stop if you're coming into the U.S. from Canada, but there's also an archway crossing both nations. The Peace Arch was constructed and dedicated in 1921, and it represents the longest undefended border in the world. The idea behind it was to commemorate the ending of the War of 1812, with one foot planted in Surrey, Canada, and the other in Blaine.\nAnother notable aspect of Blaine is\nSemiahmoo Park. The park juts out into the water, forming a natural barrier that almost turns the bay into a lake. At the tip of the park sits a resort, a fishing pier, and several restaurants. As you peer over the water, you can even catch a glimpse of Canada.\nWhat to do when visiting this underrated Pacific Northwest gem\nOnce you're in Blaine, you'll be captivated by its raw beauty and quiet atmosphere. There aren't throngs of tourists staking spots on the beach, and there are no lines to get a close-up view of the Peace Arch. Instead, you can take your vacation as slow as you like and do things on your schedule.\nBut what exactly is there to do in the Gateway to the Pacific Northwest? When you're in Blaine proper, the best attractions include Semiahmoo Park, which features the\nPlover Ferry, the oldest foot passenger ferry in Washington, which operates from Memorial Day to Labor Day. If you're hungry, you can get lunch at Alaska Wild Fish & Chips Co or get some pub food at Gateway 1890 Taphouse & Grill. However, if it's beer you're after, you should make a trek to Downtime Taps in Ferndale (about a 15-minute drive). Downtime has over 20 taps that you can pour yourself, making it the ultimate pub experience.\nStrolling the beach at Blaine is also a favorite pastime of locals and visitors alike. Much of the sand is covered in rocks and shells, so make sure to wear the right shoes. Also, while you may be tempted to take a few \"souvenir\" shells home,\ndoing so could actually harm the local ecosystem. It's also worth noting that, according to the Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife, clams, oysters, and mussels harvested from the area are not currently safe for human consumption, so it's best to enjoy these shellfishes at a restaurant.",
