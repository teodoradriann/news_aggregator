    "title": "Reduce Your Risk Of Dengue This Monsoon By Following These Precautionary Tips",
    "text": "By diligently following these precautionary tips, you can greatly reduce the risk of contracting dengue Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by the dengue virus, transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Symptoms include high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, rash, and mild bleeding. The risk of dengue increases during the monsoon season due to the abundance of stagnant water, which creates ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes. This heightened risk can be mitigated through preventive measures. These precautions significantly reduce mosquito populations and the likelihood of mosquito bites, thereby lowering the risk of dengue transmission. Keep reading as we share a list of effective precautionary tips you should follow to reduce risk of dengue. Mosquitoes, especially the ones which carries the dengue virus, breed in stagnant water. Regularly inspect areas around your home for any water collection, such as plant saucers, buckets, and old tires. Empty these containers frequently and ensure that drains are not clogged. Cover any water storage containers to prevent mosquitoes from laying eggs. Mosquito repellents are effective in preventing mosquito bites, thereby reducing the risk of dengue. Apply repellents on exposed skin and clothing. Follow the product instructions for reapplication, especially if you are sweating or after swimming. For additional protection, use indoor repellents like mosquito coils or electric vapour mats. Wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants, socks, and shoes minimises skin exposure to mosquito bites. When outdoors, especially during peak mosquito activity times (early morning and late afternoon), ensure that you are adequately covered. This simple measure can greatly reduce the number of bites you receive. Installing screens on windows and doors helps keep mosquitoes out of your living spaces. This barrier method is particularly effective when combined with other preventive measures. In addition to window and door screens, consider using bed nets, especially if you sleep during the day when mosquitoes are most active. Sleeping under mosquito nets provides a physical barrier against mosquito bites. Ensure the net is properly tucked under the mattress to prevent mosquitoes from entering. Insecticide-treated nets offer additional protection by killing mosquitoes that come into contact with the netting. Keeping your surroundings clean reduces mosquito breeding grounds. Dispose of garbage properly and regularly clean gutters to prevent water accumulation. Maintaining a tidy environment around your home and neighbourhood can significantly reduce the risk of dengue. Mosquito traps can help reduce the mosquito population in your vicinity. Place these traps in areas where mosquitoes are most active. There are various types of traps available, including those that use light, heat, or attractants to lure mosquitoes. Changing the water in flower vases, bird baths, and pet bowls at least once a week prevents mosquito breeding. Scrubbing the insides of these containers ensures that any mosquito eggs or larvae are removed, further reducing the risk of dengue. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com By diligently following these precautionary measures, you can greatly reduce the risk of contracting dengue during the monsoon season.

Friday 29 December 2023 07:13, UK Thousands of homes are still without power after Storm Gerrit wreaked havoc across northern England and Scotland. The chaotic weather [has delivered everything from heavy snow to a damaging tornado](https://news.sky.com/story/uk-weather-tornado-hits-greater-manchester-and-thousands-still-without-power-in-scotland-in-wake-of-storm-gerrit-13038743), ruining many people's journeys home from Christmas festivities. Around 1,500 properties in [Scotland](https://news.sky.com/topic/scotland-5866) are still suffering electricity outages, with people in the northeast and Shetland among the worst affected. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) hopes to restore power to the remaining households on Friday and welfare vans serving hot food and drink will be open to customers in the meantime. 'Absolute disaster' The storm is also still being felt in northern England and Wales. Stalybridge, Tameside, and Carrbrook in [Greater Manchester](https://news.sky.com/topic/greater-manchester-6937) are in a \"recovery phase\", local authorities have said, after they were hit by a rare tornado that toppled trees and damaged homes. The freak whirlwind was thought to have been caused by a supercell thunderstorm, and residents said it had left some homes looking like \"an absolute disaster\". Elsewhere, three men died after their 4x4 vehicle [was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale](https://news.sky.com/story/yorkshire-three-men-die-after-4x4-plunges-into-river-13038772). In Wales, 36,000 properties were left without power after lightning struck in Ceredigion. Travel disruption set to continue Storm Gerrit brought chaos to roads, railway lines, airports, and ferry services nationwide earlier in the week - and the disruption isn't over as the weekend beckons. The Met Office has said the final days of 2023 will see more strong wind, rain, and snow, though there are no weather warnings in place. But the Environment Agency has 33 active flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected, covering rivers including the Severn and Ouse.

While many lines have reopened since the storm blew through, services could still be suspended or cancelled due to system faults and damage. The London Euston and Watford Junction lines are not expected to be fully online until the end of Friday, while Welsh train services are expected to be hampered until Monday.

    "text": "Read full article Yahoo Sports Canada Soccer suspends coach Bev Priestman amid drone investigation, sends her home from Paris Olympics Canada beat New Zealand 2-1 on Thursday to kick off the Olympics in France ryan young Staff writer Fri, Jul 26, 2024, 7:40 AM · 2 min read Link Copied 303\nThe Canada women's soccer team will now be without head coach Bev Priestman for the rest of the Paris Olympics .\nCanada Soccer announced Thursday that, after their 2-1 win over New Zealand to kick off the Games earlier in the day, Priestman was being suspended and sent home from the Olympics in the wake of their drone spying scandal . Assistant coach Andy Spence will serve as the team's interim coach throughout the rest of the Olympics.\nThough a Canada Soccer staffer was caught flying a drone over New Zealand training earlier this week in France , which is what sparked the scandal in the first place, the issue has apparently been going on for quite some time. According to TSN , both the men's and women's national teams have \"relied on drones and spying for years.\" They even apparently used them to film closed-door training sessions of opponents during the women's team's gold medal run in the 2021 Olympics in Tokyo, and the following summer as they were attempting to qualify for the Women's World Cup.\n\"Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,\" Canada Soccer CEO Kevin Blue said in a statement . \"In light of these new revelations, Canada Soccer has made the decision to suspend women's national team head coach Bev Priestman for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, and until the completion of our recently announced independent external review.\"\nA Canadian soccer staffer, Joseph Lombardi, was detained by French police earlier this week after he was caught flying a drone over New Zealand practices multiple times ahead of their group stage game on Thursday. French police searched his hotel room and found drone footage from two closed training sessions, which he told police \"had helped him to learn the tactics of the opposing team.\" Lombardi was charged with flying an unmanned aircraft over a prohibited area, and he accepted an eight-month suspended sentence.\nThe incident prompted multiple investigations. Lombardi and assistant coach Jasmine Mander, who is Lombardi's boss, were both removed from the Canadian delegation and sent home as punishment. Priestman self-imposed a one-game suspension, and she was not on the sidelines for Thursday's win over New Zealand.\n\"I am ultimately responsible for the conduct in our program,\" Priestman said in a statement earlier this week while saying that she didn't have knowledge of the drone operation.\nNow, Priestman is on her way home early.\nCanada won the gold medal in Tokyo with a win over Sweden in the final. The United States women's national team finished in third after they beat Australia in the bronze medal game. Canada will take on France next in group play on Sunday.",
