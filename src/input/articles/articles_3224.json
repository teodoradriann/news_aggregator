    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. — The VoLo Foundation's 2025 Climate Correction Conference is back for its seventh year this week at the Celeste Hotel at the University of Central Florida to bring individuals of all ages, organizations and leading experts together to explore innovative climate solutions, with the goal of a more resilient and sustainable future.\nWhat You Need To Know The VoLo Foundation's Climate Correction Conference began Wednesday at UCF's Celeste Hotel\nThe event will continue Thursday with speaker presentations and workshops\nExperts and members of the community will work to come up with ways to help make the climate more sustainable in the future The conference is an opportunity for top climate experts, policymakers and industry leaders and the community to discuss solutions for climate change that can have real impacts in Central Florida and beyond, through workshops, training sessions and interactive events.\n\"The concept of climate correction comes from the financial meaning of when the market the prices go too high,\" said Thais Lopez Vogel, co-founder and trustee of the VoLo Foundation. \"You want to correct them before it crashes. (With climate corrections, it's) the same. The emissions are too high right now, so we want to correct them before it's too late.\n\"We know the planet is going to survive. It's the quality of life for future generations that we're trying to preserve here.\"\nWednesday's events focused on small-group activities and workshops, in which attendees could collaborate with community leaders and those who are active in the environmental sciences and sustainability fields to share ideas and come up with solutions. The sessions focus on topics like climate advocacy training.\nFilm screenings on the topics will be shown in English and Spanish and will feature discussions with the directors.\nAn art expo, where artwork will be created and be on display, also provides an opportunity to showcase the power of art in climate action. Booths and artists feature pieces with climate themes, and an art contest will reward the best work.\nWednesday wraps up with a “Trash 2 Trends” fashion show. The VIP event is a partnership with the city of Orlando that focuses on the importance of upcycling, which involves recycling to create a product of higher value than the discarded object.\nThe community events and workshops on Wednesday were free, but if anyone who wants to attend Thursday will have to pay a $100 registration fee or a $50 student registration. The agenda is available on the VoLo Foundation website .",

    "text": "What better place to strike in the nuclear family than at its very core: the husband and wife. The relationship that is symbolic of Jesus Christ and His church that is responsible for raising future generations into Godly living and lifestyles. Fox News recently interviewed the chief strategy officer of the now infamous cheating and adultery website Ashley Madison, Paul Keable, and his revelations are shocking to say the least. The interview highlights the website’s “hot spots for non-monogamy,” aka adultery, across the nation. The discussion already revealed something more, an ongoing pattern occurring in the Midwest, and it is not good for marriages or families. Breaking News . Spirit-Filled Stories . Subscribe to Charisma on YouTube now! “We saw that Columbus, Ohio, had the No. 1 most signups per capita for any city across America, which was fascinating because they weren’t even in the top 20 of our list last year,” reveals Keable. “Clearly, something is going on in Ohio because, in fact, there are two other cities in the top 20 from Ohio.” It is not just Ohio that is seeing this surge in infidelity, but across swathes of the Bible Belt. “Something is going on in the Midwest,” Keable says. These “somethings” he keeps mentioning reveal the spiritual warfare taking place across the world trying to get people of all backgrounds, especially Christians, to give in to their sin nature and abandon the principles of God. People often attribute living away from major urban areas as a safety net from these type of “big city problems,” but as the data show, this couldn’t be further from the truth. Get your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up-to-date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more! “We have red states and blue states and purple states represented really, really well. We have tourist destinations—Sin City, Las Vegas drops in at No. 4, which probably isn’t too surprising,” Keable says. “But then when you have Buffalo, Baton Rouge, Tucson, Arizona, what does that really tell you about America? It tells me that infidelity is ubiquitous against your income, against your industry and your location.” Americans are making the same mistake that Jonah made when he tried to run from God. You can’t change your geographic location and think that the spiritual realm will just let you go. It doesn’t. This is where spiritual warfare comes into play, as the Bible warns us many, many times within its holy pages. Thank you for visiting CharismaNews.com.
