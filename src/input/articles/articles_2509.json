    "text": "\nSt John the Evangelist, Palmers Green, was set on fire on New Year’s Day\nFORENSICS have confirmed that arson caused the fire that extensively damaged St John the Evangelist, Palmers Green, in north London, on New Year’s Day. The police are also investigating a seven-month campaign of misogyny and hate crime directed at the Vicar, the Revd Julie Coleman. A person has been escorted from the church on several occasions.\nThe church is known for its community outreach, notably its foodbank and the work with refugees that it runs from The Ark, in its parish centre (News, 5 November 2021). Ms Coleman says that she implemented a “zero-tolerance” approach to the anti-social behaviour that was rife in the area when she arrived three years ago, and works closely with the local council and police to build relationships.\nThe fire, started by the high altar, damaged stained-glass windows and artefacts, was hot enough to melt the candles, and had been nurtured like a barbecue, forensics found. Police told Ms Coleman that, had she gone into the church when it was ablaze, she would have been asphyxiated. “What’s sad is that it was started in the most sacred part of the church,” she told the Church Times last week.\n“We’re hanging on to hope at the moment: it might only be tiny sparks of hope, but the encouragement we’ve had has given us the strength to dust ourselves off from the haters and to keep going while praying for peace in the world we’re all part of.\n“I’m aware that people are fighting through their own personal protective challenges after the fire; others have had to cancel things like weddings and baptisms. We’re working really closely with our architects and with Ecclesiastical Insurance and our builders. The Bishop of London has been great, coming out to see me and my children; and the police and fire services have been so supportive.”\nThe church is likely to be closed for six months, while work and worship are transferred to the parish centre and The Ark. Ms Coleman has received support from other faiths and denominations: Muslim women from Afghanistan have made her a new chasuble to replace the one damaged by smoke; and a Roman Catholic priest has brought her new altar linen. Others have ensured that the family has groceries and hot meals.\n“Refugees know what it is to have pain. It gives us a common denominator, a bond. People who have been war-torn are now supporting me. I haven’t experienced as much hate as they have, but I’ve been on the receiving end of it,” she said.\nAdversity brings resilience, but misogyny in the church and community isn’t talked about enough, she concludes. “I’m shocked that there isn’t support in the Church, and I’m hoping this draws awareness to it. I believe we can grow from this challenge.”\n13 Oct 2023\n21 Apr 2023\n02 Feb 2024\n24 Dec 2022\n19 Dec 2022\n29 Sep 2023\n19 Feb 2024\n23 Feb 2024\n21 Feb 2024\n22 Feb 2024\nSneering at a new Live Aid show has political repercussions, argues Paul Vallely\nThe College of Bishops of the Scottish Episcopal Church seeks to appoint a full-time Provincial Director of Ordinands, to oversee the processes and nationwide\nteam that delivers recruitment and selection for authorised ministry (ordinands & lay readers) in the SEC.\nThe Diocese of Guildford has an exciting opportunity for two dynamic and vibrant Hub Leaders to join our Youth Catalyst Programme Team.

    "text": "By Colin Kellaher\nMerck & Co. on Thursday reported further positive results from a late-stage study of its proposed clesrovimab vaccine aimed at protecting infants from respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, disease.\nMerck said the Phase 2b/3 pivotal study evaluating a single dose of clesrovimab administered to healthy preterm and full-term infants met all prespecified endpoints, with consistent results through both the five-month and six-month time points.\nThe Rahway, N.J., drugmaker said clesrovimab reduced the incidence of RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory infections as well as RSV-associated hospitalizations.\nRSV, a contagious virus that is the leading cause of hospitalization for healthy infants, can cause inflammation in the airways, leading to difficulty breathing.\nMerck in July reported that the study had met its primary safety and efficacy through 150 days.\nMerck said clesrovimab has the potential to become the first and only approved immunization designed to protect infants with the same single dose regardless of weight for the duration of their first RSV season. The company said it aims to make clesrovimab available for infants as early as the 2025-26 RSV season.\nWrite to Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n10-17-24 1814ET\nShare © Dow Jones - 2024",

    "text": "BHB: Sterile Processing Dept To Be Upgraded The Bermuda Hospitals Board today announced that it is “starting a major renovation project for its sterile processing department that will run from February to July 2025.” A spokesperson said, “Sterile processing is the sanitisation of equipment and items used in clinical care. The highly specialised cleaning process ensures items are completely safe for use. All surgical tools are cleaned and packaged in this area to support the over 9,000 surgeries undertaken at KEMH per year. Any items that are re-used across the hospitals are also processed through this department.” Chief Operating Officer Preston Swan comments: “This is a long overdue upgrade project that will remedy the issues that have impacted SPD over the last few years, such as equipment failure and floods. The equipment is over 14 years old and the area is in the older part of the General Wing so the infrastructure is in urgent need of work. A failure in SPD could impact our ability to deliver life saving procedures and deliver safe care across our inpatient and outpatient service. This is a priority project for us that will enable us to deliver the safest, most efficient sterile processing service in the support of patient care.” The spokesperson said, “The project will cost about $4.5 million in total and will include the replacement of equipment, furniture and the floor as well as an upgrade of the infrastructure.” Mr Swan continues: “We anticipate the upgrade work in SPD will start in February and be completed by July 2025. While the department is upgraded, we will use a temporary sterile processing area that is currently being constructed in the old surgical area of the General Wing, just opposite the existing location. “The capacity of the temporary area will be enough to meet most of our needs during the upgrade, but there will be some patient impact. We anticipate there will be a reduction in the number of major elective surgeries undertaken in any one day, such as hips and knee replacements, as these are very instrument intensive. I would stress, however, that we will be able to complete all emergency and time-sensitive surgical needs, for example trauma, emergency caesarians or cancer surgeries, and there will be less impact on procedures that don’t need much instrumentation, such as pain management, some cardiology procedures, endoscopy and urology procedures.” The spokesperson said, “Once complete, the upgrade will ensure a much more consistent sterile processing service, optimising safety, quality and efficiency.” “We apologise that there will likely be fewer major elective surgeries during the first half of year,” Mr Swan says. “We will continue to do all we can to minimise the patient impact across all our services. Certainly the upgrade of this critical area is required to ensure that the sterile processing service is as robust and efficient as possible to meet the long term needs of Bermuda patients for the years ahead.”",

    "text": "The Primate of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) Archbishop Henry Ndukuba has charged practitioners in media and entertainment industry to project Nigeria in good light.\nArchbishop Ndukuba who made the call while parleying with the media in his residence, enumerated the need to emulate practitioners who portray tourism and investment potentials of their countries in movies and in the news.\nThe religious leader said most practitioners in Nigeria project things that do not speak well of the country and do not attract foreign investment.\nHe said rather than engaging in things that we bring those bad names, the press should always present Nigeria in a good light.\n“I think that the journalism of the pre-independence I believe, is the type of journalism we need now to redeem the image of our country.\n“Go for the things that we make for the building up and unity and progress and prosperity of our nation,” he said.\nFurthermore, the Clergyman acknowledged that the celebration of the 2023 Christmas is being done in the context of much anxiety, stress, and challenges.\nHe, however, observed that the prices of commodities are so high including the cost of transport saying that ordinary things that were hitherto, easily affordable are gradually getting out of the reach of the common man.\nThe Anglican primate expressed displeasure over the security situation in the country, as he also expressed concern over bad roads in the country and the state of infrastructure in general that we have.\nHe expressed hope in President Bola Tinubu’s administration saying that with the 2024 budget being considered by the National Assembly, there is hope for the country.\nArchbishop Ndukuba warned against “weaponisation of religious identity” which he said is responsible for the inclusion or exclusion of some sections of the country.\nAccording to him, weaponisation of religious identity leads to attacks, discrimination, to subdue and to control people.\n“As the scripture says, perfect love casts out fear. If the love of God is shared among us as human persons, I believe God that I will treat my brother or my sister no matter where he or she is coming from with respect and with love; love is to seek the best be done for him or her.\n“And if there is anything, especially in our country in this season of lack, in this time of stress, is the need for us to care for one another, bear one another’s burden, and help each other both as citizens and as leaders, whether religious or political in all our communities.\n“Let us pursue the things that make for peace, because we are celebrating the best of the Prince of Peace for He has come to reconcile us with one another and with God and to make peace reign on earth,” he said.\nREAD ALSO FROM\n NIGERIAN TRIBUNE",

    "text": "Palermo 12 settembre 2024 – Stato di agitazione alla Newcoop Don Milani, azienda di Carini che gestisce la logistica per Conad.\nA proclamarlo, a far data da domani, con interruzione dello straordinario e del lavoro nei festivi, l’assemblea dei lavoratori, riunita per discutere di argomenti come la salute e la sicurezza, l’organizzazione del lavoro, il licenziamento scattato ad agosto nei confronti di un lavoratore, rappresentante della Filt Cgil Palermo, e le sanzioni nei confronti di altri 5 lavoratori.\nL’assemblea, molto partecipata, ha unitariamente varato un pacchetto di 24 ore di sciopero. Le prime 8 ore per turno si terranno lunedì mattina, con un presidio ai cancelli dalle 6 alle 13.\nLa vertenza, che va avanti dall’inizio di agosto, è stata seguita dal segretario generale Filt Cgil Palermo Fabio lo Monaco. Oggi all’assemblea hanno preso parte anche il segretario generale Cgil Palermo Mario Ridulfo e il segretario generale Filt Cgil Sicilia Alessandro Grasso.\nLe prime crepe nei rapporti tra l’azienda e i lavoratori si sono aperte dopo la richiesta ai lavoratori di effettuare ulteriori turni aggiuntivi di lavoro. I lavoratori, già provati dalle alte temperature di lavoro nei capannoni aziendali durante il periodo estivo, hanno posto dei problemi di tutela in ordine alla loro salute e alla sicurezza. Di questo tenore le obiezioni poste dall’ Rsa della Filt Cgil Palermo. Per tutta risposta, l’azienda ha contestato un atteggiamento aggressivo da parte del rappresentante sindacale della Filt nei confronti del datore di lavoro. E ha licenziato il lavoratore. Oltre al licenziamento dell’rsa, in 5 sono stati sospesi per un giorno. A un altro lavoratore è stato contestato un quarto d’ora ritardo.\nFilt Cgil e Cgil Palermo hanno inizialmente provato a ricucire il rapporto con la Newcoop, associata a Legacoop, chiedendo il ritiro del licenziamento del delegato aziendale, intervenuto a nome dei 200 lavoratori. Lunedì scorso il tentativo di mediazione pacifico si era conclusa con la valutazione della possibilità di ritirare la sospensione, per ripristinare le relazioni sindacali. Il sindacato si era impegnato a non proseguire con azioni di sciopero manifestando comunque la volontà di impugnare in ogni caso il provvedimento, in linea con il diritto del lavoratore licenziato. La trattativa, che sembrava a un passo dalla conclusione, è invece proseguita con la richiesta al sindacato di non procedere con l’impugnativa, e con la richiesta di scuse da parte del lavoratore.\nA questo punto è arrivato il no da parte della Cgil, che più volte aveva chiesto in questi mesi all’azienda di discutere di sicurezza sul lavoro, ottenendo in cambio solo silenzio.\n “L’obiettivo della nostra iniziativa è il ritiro dei provvedimenti disciplinari col reintegro del lavoratore licenziato, condizione per il ripristino di corrette relazioni sindacali – dichiarano per la Filt Cgil Palermo il segretario generale Fabio Lo Monaco e il segretario Domenico Seminara e per la Cgil Palermo il segretario generale Mario Ridulfo e il segretario Dario Fazzese – Chiediamo all’azienda di tornare sui propri passi e di ritirare i provvedimenti, al fine di riaprire un confronto sindacale. Se l’azienda pensa di essersi liberata da questo lavoratore, sappia che continuerà a svolgere attività sindacale sia dentro che fuori l’azienda”.",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",
