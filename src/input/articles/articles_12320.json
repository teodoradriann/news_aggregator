    "text": "UCLA men’s tennis readies for Friday season opener against UC Irvine\nJunior Aadarsh Tripathi prepares to return a ball at the Los Angeles Tennis Center (Daily Bruin file photo)\nMen's Tennis\nUC Irvine\nFriday, 1 p.m.\nAnteater Tennis Stadium – Irvine, CA\nNo TV info\nBy Badri Viswanathan\nJan. 16, 2025 12:03 p.m.\nCoach Billy Martin’s Bruins have their sights set on the mountaintop.\n“We’re going to chase this national championship,” said junior Aadarsh Tripathi.\nThe first step towards the precipice begins Friday afternoon when No. 20 UCLA men’s tennis opens its season against UC Irvine at Anteater Tennis Stadium in Irvine. Originally scheduled at the Los Angeles Tennis Center, the match was relocated south due to ongoing fires in the surrounding area.\nComing off a second-round NCAA tournament appearance in 2024, the Bruins said they don’t see their high ambitions as a bold proclamation. It’s merely the culmination of months of endless work.\n“I’ve never had more players spend the holidays here in LA instead of going back home,” Martin said. “Everybody was really, really in touch with not letting the month long break cause them to take a step backward from how much they were improving over the fall.”\nPlayers like senior Alexander Hoogmartens continued to train in Westwood over winter break instead of returning to his home of Beersel, Belgium.\nAs Martin enters his 32nd year at the helm, he appears to exude a palpable optimism about this team.\n“We’ve started with a really fresh slate this year,” Martin said. “Everybody on this team this year is really committed. We’ve got some great young talent, some good senior leadership. I’m very excited about this year. … I have high expectations for this team.”\nThese expectations are fueled in large part by the team’s camaraderie, which has only grown stronger in the wake of the LA county fires.\nIn the midst of these difficult times, the Bruins, who have been one of the few teams still practicing on campus during a week of remote learning at UCLA, have leaned on each other.\n“My coach said, ‘I’m going to have my ringer on, so if you need … to evacuate, I will be right there,’” Tripathi said. “We all trust each other and know that we have each other’s back.”\nOn the court, UCLA’s success could start with ITA regional-winning, All-American Spencer Johnson – the sophomore aspiring to compete in the professional ranks after his UCLA tenure.\nFresh off a singles quarterfinal berth at the NCAA individual championships in November, Johnson has shown continued improvement in every facet of his game, his coach said.\n“His forehand is getting more reliable,” Martin said. “(He) has gotten better at backhand, … improved in the backcourt. … He’s working hard on his mobility.”\nThe 2023-2024 Big West Freshman of the Year headlines the Bruins’ foes across the court. Spearheaded by Andy Nguyen, the Anteaters finished last season with their first trip back to the NCAA tournament since 2022.\nThis Anteaters’ team is led by the reigning Big West Coach of the Year Mike Saunders and also boasts three other All-Big West players, including Noah Zamora, Hiroki Sakagawa and Rithvik Krishna.\n“They’ve got solid players at every spot in their lineup,” Martin said. “We’ve seen these players individually all fall and battled a lot of them multiple times. (There’s) mutual respect for each other.”\nBut for the Bruins, this season centers on an even-keeled and joyous mentality.\n“Just keep focusing (on) that same mindset. … Calm and composed and keeping (our) level the same,” Tripathi said. “It’s definitely a surreal experience playing as a team, because in tennis, you really never play as a team other than college. This is great. I’m ready to go fight alongside my brothers.”",

    "text": "Gallatin County Sheriff Search & Rescue made its first rescue of a backcountry skier this winter season this past Friday, when volunteers aided a skier out of Beehive Basin.\nThe skier had hit a rock and injured her ankle, which left her unable to ski out of the popular backcountry skiing area northwest of Big Sky Resort, according to a press release . Volunteers for GCSSAR found the skier, administered first aid and packaged the injured skier for safe transport to the trailhead. From there, the skier drove off on her own to receive further medical care.\nGallatin County Sheriff Dan Springer commended the skier and her backcountry partner in the release for the pair’s emergency communication plan. The two also brought equipment that would have allowed them to make an extended stay in the backcountry if needed.\nThe level of preparedness the two displayed is not the norm, said Jason Revisky, management duty officer.\n“People often plan for the best day as opposed to planning for the worst day,” he said.\nRevisky said GCSSAR recommends people bring enough warm clothes and supplies to survive at least one night in the backcountry, including fire-starting materials and emergency shelter. He also emphasized the importance of communications devices that function outside of cell service, such Garmin InReach or SPOT device. Many of Montana’s popular recreation areas are out of service.\nAlthough incidents can happen at any time, under any conditions, Revisky said GCSSAR worries most when avalanche danger is high, or temperatures are particularly cold. Neither is the case in current regional conditions with low avalanche danger across the board and temperatures hovering in the double-digits.\nAvalanche danger is low due to the sheer lack of snow, said Doug Chabot, director of the Gallatin National Forest Avalanche Center. The currently snowpack is very weak, faceted and sugary, but not unstable — but Chabot said this is only because there’s no slab layer on top of the facets.\nThe last known slab avalanche in the region occurred on Dec. 25 in the Bridger Range.\nHowever, Chabot said, because the existing layer of snow currently is so weak, avalanche danger will rise very quickly with any new snow.\nThe mountains around Bozeman can expect 1 to 3 inches over the weekend, with the lower elevation areas to receive one inch, if any, according to Amanda Wilson, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Great Falls. Wilson said the coming snow doesn’t appear to be a robust storm system.\n“Normally 3 inches of snow is nothing like we don’t even worry about that in a lot of cases,” Chabot said. “But in this case, it’s been so long since it’s snowed that any snow that falls is a concern for us right now.”\nIn the meantime, Chabot said skiers, snowboarders and snowmobilers should be aware of the thin snowpack and hazards that it brings such as more prominent rocks and trees.\nAdditionally, Revisky and Chabot encourage adventure-goers to look at the GNFAC website ( mtavalanche.com ) for all the information needed to plan ahead and stay safe in the backcountry.\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters Lorea Zabaleta can be reached at lzabaleta@dailychronicle.com .",
