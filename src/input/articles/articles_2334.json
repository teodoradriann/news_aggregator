    "text": "LAS VEGAS ( KVVU /Gray News) - A Las Vegas family spent 13 hours in triple-digit heat to rescue kittens and their mother from a storm drain. And after the hourslong ordeal, they were able to reunite the mother cat with her babies. The situation happened near a neighborhood park in the northwest part of town this week. Dana Hernandez said her daughter and husband were on an early morning walk when they heard crying coming from a storm drain. “They saw the mama cat jump into the sewer. That caught my child’s attention, and my husband came over and saw the kittens,” she said. Hernandez and her mother, Julie Woodward, said they called Las Vegas Animal Control several times, as well as the police department and the fire department. As temperatures soared to 108 degrees Fahrenheit, the family members said they yanked off the storm drain to drop down water and food for the kittens and the mother. “The mommy was very emaciated. We gave her two cans of food and she ate all of it. She was starving,” Woodward said. Hernandez managed to crawl down the storm drain and pull out several of the kittens. The family took them to an emergency veterinarian, who said they were dehydrated and malnourished. Animal control arrived that afternoon and with a small trap, they tried to retrieve the other cats still inside the drain. Volunteers also stepped in to help and were able to pull out the additional kittens, but then the mother cat could not be found. Late Friday night, Animal control officers dropped off another trap to help find the mother. “They were probably in there for a couple of days. They’re very, very small,” Woodward said. The family didn’t give up their efforts, either, and during the overnight hours, their mission was complete by locating the mother cat and reuniting her with her five kittens. “She was very scared, but she is safe with all five of her kittens rescued. The babies cried all night long, but when we added momma into the room with them, they all stopped and started nursing,” Hernandez said. The family said they plan to adopt all of the kittens.

    "text": "European Union Finalizes 50 Billion Euro Aid Package for Ukraine\nWidespread Religious Persecution in Ukraine Following Russian Invasion\nReports emerging from the International Religious Freedom Summit in Washington, D.C., paint a chilling picture of religious persecution in Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February 2022. A host of Ukrainian officials and church sources have detailed an extensive campaign of persecution perpetrated by Russian soldiers and occupation officials.\nVerified Acts of Persecution\nAccording to Ukrainian Human Rights Commissioner Dmytro Lubinets, there have been 76 verified acts of religious persecution, including the killing or capture of at least 29 clerics or religious leaders. However, the real numbers are feared to be much higher. The persecution has targeted a wide range of religious communities, including Evangelical Christians from Baptist, Pentecostal, and Seventh-day Adventist denominations.\nTactics of Persecution\nThe tactics employed by Russian forces are horrifying and range from arbitrary detentions to rape, torture, and threats of execution. Russian forces have also reportedly destroyed over 600 religious buildings. The aim, it appears, is to destroy the Ukrainian national identity by eliminating its religious and democratic values.\nThe Role of the Russian Orthodox Church\nThe Russian Orthodox Church, under the leadership of Patriarch Kirill, has been implicated in supporting these aggressive persecutions. Religious figures outside the church are deemed enemy agents by the occupation forces. The Ukrainian officials insist that restoration of religious freedom can only be achieved with the liberation of the occupied territories and the end of the Russian occupation.\nUkrainian security agents have been conducting counterintelligence operations at cathedrals and monasteries of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, suspecting them of pro-Russian activities. The Security Service of Ukraine alleges the religious institutions were being used as instruments of Russian influence and conducted raids to exclude the use of religious communities as cells of the Russian world. Despite these allegations being protested by the UOC as unfounded, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has affirmed his government’s commitment to measures ensuring Ukraine’s spiritual independence from Russia.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.",

    "text": "“He Wanted to Assault Someone”: Udonis Haslem Throws Shaquille O’Neal Under the Bus After Dropping ‘Awkward’ Confession NBA players and teams tend to have a charged up atmosphere. Due to the spirit of the competition and pressure to win, tensions are usually running high. Especially, for an organization as intense as the Miami Heat with their Heat Culture. But, in some cases, those emotions reached a boiling point with your teammates itself. That is how Shaquille O’Neal found himself ready to fight someone in the shower. America’s Favorite Video Today However, to his surprise, the team’s enforcer and voice of reason Udonis Haslem was unwilling to step in. Even though most altercations involve an incident on the court, this was their own locker room with a fight brewing. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “So, a rookie was talking smack to me in the shower and I’m getting ready to go off and you [Udonis Haslem] was like, ‘Shaq, I love you and respect you. I ain’t going to let you fight this rookie. But, if y’all start fighting, I ain’t about to break this s**t up man. He in this motherf***er b*tt-a** n**ed.'” Then, Mr. Heat Culture as he fashions himself would give an explanation as to why he was hesitant to join and/or stop the fight. “This man was in the shower. Like, he was that mad that he wanted to assault somebody in the shower.” Despite taking on the role of team leader, Haslem wasn’t about to join the frankly ‘awkward’ situation. “But, I’m the connector and our protector. But, that’s just an awkward time to connect or anybody. So now, I ain’t want no parts of that.” However, despite this scenario, the Los Angeles Lakers legend does hold Haslem in the highest of regards. This is a developing story.

    "title": "The promise of mycelium bricks",
    "text": "In the light of climate change, the construction industry like many others is considering how it can reduce its carbon footprint and become more sustainable.\nOne opportunity is concerned with bricks. Fired clay bricks have been the mainstay of the construction industry but their production also emits nearly 300 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, which could increase with more urbanisation.\nA new advance on this front is mycelium bricks. Mycelia are the branching filaments of fungi that make up its vegetative part. Researchers have them harnessed to create biodegradable, fire-resistant, and insulative bricks. They are made by combining husk, sawdust, and fungal spores to create a fibrous network that solidifies into a lightweight material. Within a few days, these materials become a hardier structure.\nMycelium bricks have the potential to reduce the building sector’s carbon footprint, its proponents have said. They are relatively more lightweight and good insulators of heat. Aside from potential use as panelling material in interior designs, researchers believe mycelium-based components can be used in liquid filters, sports equipment, and printed circuit boards.\nBut before they can find wider use, mycelium materials need to improve in many ways. At present they can’t bear heavier loads for longer periods. One 2020 review found that while mycelium composites have a high strength to weight ratio, it is two orders of magnitude lower than concrete. They are also susceptible to moisture, biodegrade in a few years, and can’t be produced en masse .\n“The cost of growing and treating fungi for construction purposes is currently higher due to lack of infrastructure,” Rakesh Jha, a civil engineer and the founder of Patna-based Veritech Infrastructure, said.\nIndia’s tropical weather exacerbates these problems. “Mycelium-based materials are not as strong as conventional materials like concrete or brick or steel. Due to mycelium being highly absorbent, it … vulnerable to moisture and fungal decay in India’s climate,” Jha added.\nWhile mycelium is naturally fire-resistant, prolonged exposure to heat could cause structural failure. Mycelium composites also absorb more moisture than synthetic foams and plywood, which is inimical for damp environments with leaking walls or roofs. They also don’t resist termites.\nBut these are problems to be solved rather than reasons to discard mycelium bricks. For example: “Mycelium can be treated with non-toxic flame retardants that can enhance fire resistance, followed by a UV-protective coating that can prevent photo-degradation in outdoor applications,” Jha said.\nThe biggest challenge is consumers’ attitude, which experts have said will require more investment in research and development, to make mycelium bricks more competitive with clay bricks, and awareness campaigns to shift.\nBut thanks to climate change and the advent of concepts like high-performance buildings , interest is already growing in alternative and sustainable materials. “This shift along with policy pushes can drive demand for sustainable alternatives and help in growing the market for mycelium,” Aditya Srinivas Kandaala, founder of Roha Biotech, a startup incubated at IIT Madras, said.\nAditya Ansh is an independent media journalist based in New Delhi.\nPublished - March 13, 2025 06:00 am IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

If you were in places with heavy light pollution and missed the solar show, the Des Moines Register can catch you up on all the aurora shots taken around Iowa. How can I see the northern lights again? There is a chance to see the aurora again. On Friday, the aurora borealis could be visible from northern Iowa, but the likelihood isn't as strong as Thursday, according to the [NOAA](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-viewline-tonight-and-tomorrow-night-experimental). Historically, the best time to see the lights is between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. How to take photos of the aurora The best way to take photos of the northern lights on a smartphone is by adjusting the exposure time and enabling night mode, according to [USA TODAY](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/11/northern-lights-photos-smartphone-tips/73657106007/).

    "text": "Por Kathleen Magramo, CNN\nTreinta y una personas que trabajaban en un enorme túnel subterráneo en Los Ángeles fueron rescatadas el miércoles por la noche después de que una parte de la estructura se derrumbara, dijeron las autoridades.\nLos rescatados no tenían lesiones visibles, dijo el Departamento de Bomberos de Los Ángeles en un comunicado , poco después de una operación en la que varios de los atrapados en el túnel industrial fueron sacados a un lugar seguro con una grúa.\nMás de 100 bomberos del Departamento de Bomberos de Los Ángeles acudieron rápidamente a la escena en el vecindario de Wilmington de la ciudad para ayudar en la operación, incluidos los equipos de búsqueda y rescate urbano, dijo la alcaldesa de Los Ángeles, Karen Bass, en X.\nEl derrumbe se produjo aproximadamente a 8 a 10 punto de entrada y salida del túnel y a unos 121 metros bajo tierra, según informaron las autoridades. El túnel forma parte de un proyecto municipal de aguas residuales.\nLos trabajadores atrapados lograron trepar un montón de tierra suelta de entre 3,6 y 4,5 metros de altura para alcanzar a sus compañeros al otro lado, según informes preliminares. Desde allí, fueron transportados en un vehículo de túnel hasta el punto de acceso, según el departamento de bomberos.\nLos bomberos utilizaron grúas y jaulas de rescate para sacar a varios trabajadores, según un video de la afiliada de CNN, KCBS/KCAL .\nLa alcaldesa de Los Ángeles, Karen Bass, se reunió con los trabajadores rescatados y los servicios de emergencia en el lugar, según un video publicado en su cuenta X. “Gracias nuevamente a todos nuestros socorristas que trabajan para poner a salvo a los angelinos”, dijo Bass.\nLa falla ocurrió cuando los trabajadores estaban operando la tuneladora y una sección que ya habían construido se derrumbó debido al “apretamiento del suelo”, dijo Robert Ferrante, ingeniero jefe y gerente general de los Distritos de Saneamiento del Condado de Los Ángeles, en una conferencia de prensa el miércoles por la noche.\nEl aplastamiento del suelo se produce cuando el suelo o la tierra se deforma significativamente durante una excavación.\nLos trabajos en el lugar se detendrán y serán inspeccionados, agregó Ferrante, pero no dio detalles sobre cuánto tiempo tomará.\nLa supervisora ​​​​de la Junta del Condado de Los Ángeles, Janice Hahn, dijo que el incidente sirve como recordatorio de los riesgos que implican estos proyectos y que los distritos de saneamiento “investigarían” qué causó el incidente.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
