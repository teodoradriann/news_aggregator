    "text": "Notfall\nTunneleinsturz in Los Angeles: 31 Arbeiter gerettet\nLos Angeles / Lesedauer: 1 min\nAufatmen in Kalifornien: Nach dem Einsturz eines Tunnels im Großraum der US-Metropole Los Angeles hat die Feuerwehr alle Eingeschlossenen bergen können. 31 Menschen, wohl alle Tunnelarbeiter, seien am Mittwochabend (Ortszeit) lebend und ohne sichtbare Verletzungen gerettet worden, teilte die Feuerwehr mit. Der Unglücksort befindet etwa 30 Kilometer südlich des Zentrums von Los Angeles.\nErsten Berichten der Feuerwehr zufolge gelang es einigen Arbeitern nach dem Einsturz, über einen Berg loser Erde zu klettern. Auf der anderen Seite trafen sie demnach auf Kollegen. Anschließend seien die Eingeschlossenen mit einem Tunneltransportmittel zum Ausgang gebracht worden. Sanitäter versorgten daraufhin die Geretteten und untersuchten sie genauer, hieß es.\nEin großer Rettungseinsatz\nMehr als 100 Einsatzkräfte waren nach Angaben der Feuerwehr zum Unglücksort geeilt, darunter spezialisierte Rettungsteams. Der Einsturz passierte demnach mehr als acht Kilometer vom einzigen Tunneleingang entfernt. Es handele sich um einen im Bau befindlichen Tunnel für die kommunale Abwasserentsorgung, hieß es weiter. Die Ermittlungen zur Ursache des Einsturzes dauern an.\nEtwa eine Stunde waren die Arbeiter in dem Tunnel eingeschlossen, meldete CBS News. Der Tunnel sei insgesamt mehr als 11 Kilometer lang und etwas mehr als fünf Meter breit, schrieb der US-Sender unter Berufung auf den Betreiber.",

    "text": "He has been officially served — controversial church leader Apollo Quiboloy, that is, with the subpoena issued by the Senate.\nA photo shared by the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations and Gender Equality showed the subpoena was received by Marie Dinah Tolentino Fuentes, the counsel for the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, which Quiboloy founded and heads.\nThe subpoena ad testificandum (compelling his attendance) was received by Quiboloy’s camp on Thursday, 22 February.\nThe Senate panel, led by Senator Risa Hontiveros, issued the subpoena in connection with its ongoing investigation into the alleged physical and sexual abuse of women church members allegedly by Quiboloy and other KOJC members.\nThe Senate panel kicked off its probe last month without Quiboloy.\nHouse warns Quiboloy\nThe House of Representatives, meanwhile, warned Quiboloy to physically appear before a congressional hearing on 12 March or face arrest.\nThe ultimatum followed Quiboloy’s continued no-show at numerous hearings of the House Committee on Legislative Franchises since December on alleged franchise violations by Sonshine Media Network International Network, of which lawmakers believe the religious leader is the “beneficial owner.”\nSenior Deputy Speaker Aurelio Gonzales Jr. warned Quiboloy on Friday that he is not “exempt from the law,” therefore, the House will be compelled to impose the necessary sanctions should he snub their summons anew.\n“We remind Pastor Quiboloy that he must comply with the subpoena, or we will have no choice but to hold him in contempt and proceed with his arrest,” Gonzales said.\nDeputy Majority Leader Jude Acidre said Quiboloy cannot spare himself from legal penalties despite his “exalted view of himself.”\n“I don’t think being an ‘appointed son of God’ puts you above the law, and I’m sure no one is above the law,” Acidre said in a press conference.\n“In the House, we will implement the law. If he does not appear, then we will be constrained to execute the subpoena and make sure that he is here to answer the questions and issues raised against him,” he said.\nFranchise violations\nThe House Committee on Legislative Franchises on Monday issued a subpoena to Quiboloy to appear at its next hearing on 12 March to testify on the SMNI’s alleged violation of its franchise under Republic Act 1142, which granted the network a 25-year franchise renewal in 2019.\nThe panel is currently deliberating a bill seeking to revoke the congressional franchise of SMNI for purported violations of Sections 10 and 11, especially 4 of RA 1142.\nAssassination threat\nQuiboloy, in an audio statement on 21 February, admitted he was in hiding for fear of his life owing to a supposed assassination threat against him by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos, whom he accused of colluding with the United States to carry out the plot.\nQuiboloy has been indicted on several criminal charges in the US, including conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking by force, sex trafficking of children, fraud and coercion, conspiracy, and bulk cash smuggling.\nSMNI, legally operating as Swara Sug Media Corporation, is facing an administrative case for alleged breach of the terms and conditions of its franchise, such as deliberately disseminating false information and willful misrepresentation against government officials and other entities.\nAmong these was the airing of a “false” report about Speaker Martin Romualdez, alleged to have incurred P1.8 billion in travel expenses, which House Secretary General Reginald Velasco debunked.\nIn January, the National Telecommunications Commission ordered the indefinite suspension of SMNI radio and television stations pending a hearing and final consideration of its administrative case in the agency.\nVirtual appearance\nHontiveros previously said Quiboloy may request to attend the hearing virtually, however, on one condition.\n“He must show us first his readiness to honor the subpoena and appear before the committee before he tries to ask for this kind of arrangement,” she said.\nShe warned Quiboloy that failure to show up at the Senate hearing despite the issuance of a subpoena would lead to his arrest.\nQuiboloy, who served as the spiritual adviser of former president Rodrigo Duterte, has been declared one of the most wanted suspected sex traffickers by the United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nIn 2021, a Federal Grand Jury in California indicted the religious leader and other officials of KOJC over the sex trafficking of “pastorals” — young women in the KOJC selected to work as personal assistants to Quiboloy.",

    "text": "Full Bio\nsell offits Chrome browser in an antitrust action against the company. In August, a judge\nruledthe tech giant held an illegal search monopoly in the US – the same judge the Justice Department is now asking to mandate that Google ditch Chrome, which is valued at roughly\n$2o billion. The Chrome browser pushes users into the Google ecosystem, using the company’s search, ad, and data-hoovering operations to dominate the market.\nThe Justice Department play comes as the government is suing Apple (for a third time in a decade and a half), alleging it has built a monopoly around its iPhone and app ecosystem. The government is also suing Google over its domination of the online ad market. There are several other stateside tech lawsuits, too.\nCanada is pursuing its own investigation into Google’s ad practices. Earlier this spring, four large school boards in the country launched a class action suit against Meta, Snap Inc. and ByteDance (which operates TikTok), alleging the companies harm students and their capacity to learn.\nThe suits are part of a growing anti-big tech push aimed at restraining the giants and sorting out their position in the marketplace — and both the media and democratic ecosystems. The process is slow-going, but legal precedents — such as what may come from the current Justice Department cases – could have major national and perhaps even international consequences for tech users and companies looking to break into the market.",
