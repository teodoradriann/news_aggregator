    "text": "By Jesse Sarles ,\n12 hours ago\nCoyote that attacked a 4-year-old has been captured and killed 00:25\nOfficials from Colorado Parks and Wildlife say they have captured and put down a coyote that attacked a 4 year old. The attack happened in the Colorado Springs area last month in a neighborhood east of Monument Creek and Interstate 25 near the U.S. Air Force Academy.\nWitnesses say that on Thanksgiving day, a group of children were playing and under adult supervision when a 4-year-old girl and another child saw what they thought was a dog behind a tree and approached it. The coyote then attacked the girl, grabbing her by the back of her head, before an adult could scare it off.\nThe girl had to be rushed to the hospital and had to undergo multiple surgeries.\nWildlife officers say they trapped the animal and found human DNA in its paws and also say:\n- It had human food in its stomach.\n- It likely had been fed by someone.\n- It had lost fear of humans.\nFollowing the attack, wildlife officers said they were planning to trap and kill all of the coyotes in the area as a precautionary measure. That effort has now stopped.\n\"The pursuit of coyotes in the north Colorado Springs neighborhood has ended,\" CPW officials wrote in a news release.\nAn investigation into who may have been feeding coyotes is ongoing.\n\"A 4-year-old child suffered serious injuries and her family was traumatized because someone was feeding wildlife,\" said Tim Kroening, CPW's wildlife manager for the Pikes Peak area, in a prepared statement. \"Since we began our search, we routinely saw three coyotes that boldly approached houses and clearly had lost their fear of humans. This tells us they were searching for food. As a result, we continue to investigate the source of the feeding.\"\n4",

    "title": "IHOPKC cuts ties with Mike Bickle over ‘inappropriate conduct’",
    "text": "(RNS) — Leaders of the International House of Prayer, an influential charismatic evangelical prayer and mission group based in Kansas City,\nannounced Friday (Dec. 22) that they have cut ties with founder Mike Bickle.\nIn late October a group of former IHOPKC leaders accused Bickle of a pattern of alleged clergy sexual misconduct. Earlier in December, Bickle\nadmitted some past misconduct, but said that many of the allegations against him were false.\n“With a very heavy heart I want to express how deeply grieved I am that my past sins have led to so much pain, confusion, and division in the body of Christ in this hour,” Bickle said in an\nonline statement. “I sadly admit that 20+ years ago, I sinned by engaging in inappropriate behavior—my moral failures were real.”\nOn Friday, IHOPKC announced that Bickle was no longer part of the group.\n“Since taking over management of the crisis, the Executive Committee has received new information to now confirm a level of inappropriate behavior on the part of Mike Bickle that requires IHOPKC to immediately formally and permanently separate from him,” said spokesman and crisis management consultant Eric Volz in a video\nposted on YouTube.\nVolz said that IHOPKC leaders did not have permission to share details about Bickle’s alleged misconduct, only saying an investigation into allegations against him is in process.\nThe spokesman also announced that Stuart Greaves, executive director of IHOPKC had resigned, without giving any reason for why he had done so.\nBickle has long been an influential figure in charismatic Christian circles. An early leader in the Vineyard movement, he\nsplit with the group in the 1990s over theology and clashes with its founder, John Wimber, and other leaders. He is perhaps best known for founding IHOP, which began holding round-the-clock prayer 7 days a week in 1999 and later became a missionary movement.\nBickle has also been a leader in the New Apostolic Reformation, which stresses the idea the church should be led by modern-day prophets and apostles.\nIHOPKC leaders\n released an initial report in November casting doubt on the allegations against Bickle, based on an internal review, but Volz announced earlier this month that IHOPKC had hired the Lathrop Group to investigate further. IHOPKC, which is paying for the review and signed the contract with the Lathrop Group, says the investigation is independent.\nVolz said the decision to cut ties wth Bickle shows why an independent investigation is needed. He also said IHOPKC leaders have pledged to “implement any and all changes necessary to church policies, procedures and culture to ensure that IIHOPKC does not traveled down this difficult road again.”\nAdvocates for alleged survivors of abuse, including attorney Boz Tchividjian, say they want the truth about the allegations, but are skeptical that the Lathrop Group investigation will be independent. They cite a statement on the firm’s website that boasts of its work to defend religious groups dealing with abuse allegations.",

    "text": "These are the exciting space missions slated for launch in 2024 From the Moon’s south pole to an ice-covered ocean world. This article was originally featured in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/from-the-moons-south-pole-to-an-ice-covered-ocean-world-several-exciting-space-missions-are-slated-for-launch-in-2024-218000). The year 2023 proved to be an important one for space missions, with NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission [returning a sample from an asteroid](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/watch-live-ancient-asteroid-sample-lands-on-earth-in-last-leg-of-nasa-osiris-rex-mission) and India’s Chandrayaan-3 mission [exploring the lunar south pole](https://www.space.com/chandrayaan-3-moon-temperature-lunar-south-pole-first-time), and 2024 is shaping up to be another exciting year for space exploration. Several new missions under NASA’s [Artemis plan](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/) and [Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative](https://www.nasa.gov/commercial-lunar-payload-services/) will target the Moon. The latter half of the year will feature several exciting launches, with the launch of the Martian Moons eXploration mission in September, Europa Clipper and Hera in October and Artemis II and VIPER to the Moon in November–if everything goes as planned. [I’m a planetary scientist](https://www.eaps.purdue.edu/people/profile/bramsona.html), and here are six of the space missions I’m most excited to follow in 2024. 1. Europa Clipper NASA will launch [Europa Clipper](https://europa.nasa.gov/), which will explore [one of Jupiter’s largest moons, Europa](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/moons/europa/). Europa is slightly smaller than Earth’s Moon, with a surface made of ice. Beneath its icy shell, Europa likely harbors a saltwater ocean, which scientists expect contains over twice as much water as all the [oceans here on Earth combined](https://europa.nasa.gov/why-europa/ingredients-for-life). With Europa Clipper, scientists want to investigate whether Europa’s ocean could be [a suitable habitat for extraterrestrial life](https://europa.nasa.gov/mission/about/#pre-project-planning-pre-phase-a). The mission plans to do this by flying past Europa [nearly 50 times](https://www.astronomy.com/science/ask-astro-why-will-europa-clipper-orbit-jupiter-instead-of-europa/) to study the moon’s icy shell, its surface’s geology [and its subsurface ocean](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15160-9). The mission will also look for [active geysers](https://europa.nasa.gov/news/40/are-water-plumes-spraying-from-europa-nasas-europa-clipper-is-on-the-case/) spewing out from Europa. This mission will change the game for [scientists hoping to understand ocean worlds](https://theconversation.com/jupiters-moons-hide-giant-subsurface-oceans-two-missions-are-sending-spacecraft-to-see-if-these-moons-could-support-life-203207) like Europa. The launch window–the period when the mission could launch and achieve its planned route– [opens Oct. 10, 2024](https://europa.nasa.gov/mission/timeline/), and lasts 21 days. The spacecraft will [launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-awards-launch-services-contract-for-europa-clipper-mission/) and arrive at the Jupiter system in 2030. 2. Artemis II launch The Artemis program, [named after Apollo’s twin sister](https://theconversation.com/who-is-artemis-nasas-latest-mission-to-the-moon-is-named-after-an-ancient-lunar-goddess-turned-feminist-icon-189504) in Greek mythology, is [NASA’s plan to go back to the Moon](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/artemis/). It will send humans to the Moon for the first time since 1972, including the [first woman and the first person of color](https://www.nasa.gov/general/what-is-artemis/). Artemis also includes plans for [a longer-term, sustained presence in space](https://www.space.com/rebooting-moon-nasa-artemis-sustainability) that will prepare NASA for eventually sending people even farther– [to Mars](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/new-program-office-leads-nasas-path-forward-for-moon-mars/). Artemis II is the first crewed step in this plan, with [four astronauts](https://theconversation.com/meet-the-next-four-people-headed-to-the-moon-how-the-diverse-crew-of-artemis-ii-shows-nasas-plan-for-the-future-of-space-exploration-203214) planned to be on board during the 10-day mission. The mission builds upon [Artemis I](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-i/), which sent an uncrewed [capsule](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/orion-spacecraft/) into orbit around the Moon in late 2022. Artemis II will put the astronauts into orbit around the Moon before returning them home. It is currently planned for [launch as early as November 2024](https://phys.org/news/2023-03-nasa-artemis-mission-moon-november.html). But there is a chance it will get pushed back to 2025, depending on whether all the necessary gear, such as spacesuits and oxygen equipment, [is ready](https://www.space.com/artemis-2-humans-moon-orbit). 3. VIPER to search for water on the Moon [VIPER](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/viper/), which stands for Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, is a robot the size of a golf cart that NASA will use to explore the Moon’s [south pole](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasas-artemis-rover-to-land-near-nobile-region-of-moons-south-pole/) in late 2024. [Originally scheduled for launch in 2023](https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/nasa-replans-clps-delivery-of-viper-to-2024-to-reduce-risk-2/), NASA pushed the mission back to complete more tests on the lander system, which [Astrobotic](https://www.astrobotic.com/), a private company, developed as part of the [Commercial Lunar Payload Services](https://www.nasa.gov/commercial-lunar-payload-services/) program. This robotic mission is designed to search for [volatiles](https://www.planetary.org/space-missions/viper), which are molecules that easily vaporize, like water and carbon dioxide, at lunar temperatures. These materials could provide resources for [future human exploration](https://theconversation.com/scientists-suspect-theres-ice-hiding-on-the-moon-and-a-host-of-missions-from-the-us-and-beyond-are-searching-for-it-216060) on the Moon. The VIPER robot will rely on batteries, heat pipes and radiators throughout its [100-day mission](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/viper/in-depth/), as it navigates everything from the extreme heat of lunar daylight–when temperatures can reach 224 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius)–to the Moon’s [frigid shadowed regions](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/five-things-to-know-about-nasas-lunar-rover-viper-180978787/) that can reach a mind-boggling -400 F (-240 C). VIPER’s launch and delivery to the lunar surface is scheduled for [November 2024](https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/nasa-replans-clps-delivery-of-viper-to-2024-to-reduce-risk-2/). 4. Lunar Trailblazer and PRIME-1 missions NASA has recently invested in a class of small, low-cost planetary missions called [SIMPLEx](https://soma.larc.nasa.gov/simplex/), which stands for Small, Innovative Missions for PLanetary Exploration. These missions save costs by tagging along on other launches as what is called a rideshare, or secondary payload. One example is the [Lunar Trailblazer](https://www.planetary.org/space-missions/lunar-trailblazer). Like VIPER, Lunar Trailblazer will look for water on the Moon. But while VIPER will land on the Moon’s surface, studying a specific area near the south pole in detail, Lunar Trailblazer will orbit the Moon, measuring the temperature of the surface and [mapping out the locations of water molecules](https://trailblazer.caltech.edu/objectives.html) across the globe. Currently, Lunar Trailblazer is on track [to be ready by early 2024](https://trailblazer.caltech.edu/index.html). However, because it is a secondary payload, Lunar Trailblazer’s launch timing depends on the primary payload’s launch readiness. The [PRIME-1](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/polar-resources-ice-mining-experiment-1-prime-1) mission, [scheduled for a mid-2024 launch](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/details/6828), is Lunar Trailblazer’s ride. PRIME-1 will drill into the Moon–it’s a test run for the kind of drill [that VIPER will use](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/kennedy/apollo-to-artemis-drilling-on-the-moon/). But its launch date will likely depend on whether earlier launches go on time. An earlier Commercial Lunar Payload Services mission with the [same landing partner](https://www.space.com/intuitive-machines) was [pushed back to February 2024 at the earliest](https://www.intuitivemachines.com/post/intuitive-machines-im-1-lunar-mission-launch-update), and further delays could push back PRIME-1 and Lunar Trailblazer. 5. JAXA’s Martian Moon eXploration mission While Earth’s Moon has many visitors–big and small, robotic and crewed–planned for 2024, Mars’ moons Phobos and Deimos will soon be getting a visitor as well. The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, has a robotic mission in development called the [Martian Moon eXploration, or MMX,](https://www.mmx.jaxa.jp/en/) planned for launch around September 2024. The mission’s main science objective is to determine the origin of Mars’ moons. Scientists aren’t sure whether Phobos and Deimos are [former asteroids that Mars captured into orbit with its gravity](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.199.4324.64) or if they [formed out of debris](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00159-011-0044-6) that was already in orbit around Mars. The spacecraft will spend three years around Mars conducting [science operations](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40623-021-01546-6) to observe Phobos and Deimos. MMX will also land on Phobos’ surface and [collect a sample](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40623-021-01545-7) before returning to Earth. 6. ESA’s Hera mission [Hera](https://www.heramission.space/) is a mission by the European Space Agency to return to the Didymos-Dimorphos asteroid system that NASA’s [DART mission](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/dart/) visited in 2022. But DART didn’t just visit these asteroids, [it collided with one of them](https://theconversation.com/in-a-world-first-nasas-dart-mission-is-about-to-smash-into-an-asteroid-what-will-we-learn-189391) to test a [planetary defense](https://www.space.com/planetary-defense-explained) technique called “kinetic impact.” DART hit Dimorphos with such force that [it actually changed its orbit](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-confirms-dart-mission-impact-changed-asteroids-motion-in-space/). The kinetic impact technique smashes something into an object in order to alter its path. This could prove useful if humanity ever finds a [potentially hazardous object](https://www.livescience.com/what-are-potentially-hazardous-asteroids) on a collision course with Earth and needs to redirect it. Hera will launch in [October 2024](https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Hera), making its way in late 2026 to Didymos and Dimorphos, where it will study [physical properties of the asteroids](https://doi.org/10.3847/PSJ/ac6f52).

    "text": "When Mahesh Bhatts protege Vinay Bhardwaj offered Pehchaan to him, the filmmaker viewed it as a golden chance to expand his knowledge about Sikhism. The SonyLIV talk show features him having conversations with 12 eminent Sikhs as they reflect on their value of serving humanity and the influence of their faith on their lives. I havent been a religious person, but I was always fascinated by Guru Nanak Dev. Hed use the word ‘spiritual action. One day, Vinay came to me with this stunning idea of putting me face-to-face with these eminent Sikhs, who have been through the terrain of life and have practised Sikhism, not indulging in rituals, but as a way of life. When I spoke to them, they left me staggered by what they have gone through and the concept of seva, says the director. He counts it as one of his most moving experiences. Besides being a sharp director, Bhatt has been known for his articulate and intelligent conversations. What does he think about todays artistes, who are reluctant to speak their mind in the fear of being trolled? The human need for a person courting optimum fame is the need to be accepted. For that, you take the path often taken instead of the path youre actually treading on. A few years ago, Dharmendra told me, ‘Its a weird world today, where people want to be seen as good, but dont want to be good. Its all about appearances. Thats why the higher your position is, the more closed you are.",

    "text": "Tensions Escalate along Lebanon-Israel Border\nShelling along the Lebanon-Israel border continued Thursday, as Lebanese officials spent the day in meetings with foreign counterparts from France and Britain about the growing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed paramilitary group.\nHezbollah claimed it carried out simultaneous attacks around 4 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) — targeting multiple “barracks” across northern Israel.\nThe Israel Defense Forces told CNN that approximately 20 launches were detected on Thursday that were aimed at Kiryat Shmona, a northern Israeli municipality that has been the target of Hezbollah strikes over the last several days. The municipality claimed two anti-tank missiles were fired at the town earlier in the day. Hezbollah made six direct missile hits on Kiryat Shmona on Wednesday.\nLebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati met with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron in Beirut on Thursday and also spoke with French Foreign and European Affairs Minister Catherine Colonna on a call to discuss the growing clashes in southern Lebanon and northern Israel. Mikati called for “maximum pressure to stop the Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon” during his meeting with Cameron, according to a social media post from the Lebanese government.\nCameron said in a post on X that an “escalation of the conflict in Gaza to Lebanon, the Red Sea or across the wider region, would add to the extremely high level of danger and insecurity in the world.” The fighting is among various incidents involving Iran and its proxies that have raised global concerns that Israel’s war in Gaza could widen into a greater regional conflict.\nREAD Also: US President Biden to Meet with Israeli Officials, Emphasizes Friendship and Tough Questions\nAs the threat of greater violence between Hezbollah and Israel rises, evidence of the growing tensions on the ground in Lebanon is appearing. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNFIL) on Thursday called on Lebanese authorities to investigate after an attack on a patrol unit. The UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon says the attack “by a group of young men” in the southern city of Taybeh left a peacekeeper wounded and a vehicle damaged, according to an X account run by UNIFIL.",

    "text": "FIRENZE (ITALPRESS) - La Fiorentina si caccia in un incubo, neesce e alla fine rovina tutto. Il film della gara di andata deiplay-off di Conference League racconta di una formazione viola che va sotto di due gol, rimonta, ribalta il punteggio e nei minuti finali si vede pareggiare dalla Puskas Akademia che così potrà dire di aver portato a casa la pelle contro un avversario tanto prestigioso. Per il passaggio del turno deciderà la gara di andata in Ungheria di giovedì prossimo. L'inizio partita è shock per i padroni di casa che nel giro di 2' si ritrovano sotto di due reti. All'8' Kayode commette un ingenuo fallo in area su Nagy, rigore che proprio il numero 25 ungherese realizza con un destro molto angolato. Il raddoppio nasce su un assist di Puljic che serve Soisalo che buca una difesa gigliata completamente in bambola. Ci mettono un pò gli uomini di Palladino a riorganizzarsi. Serve attendere il 42' per registrare la traversa di Bianco con un destro da fuori area, poi Sottil accorcia prima dell'intervallo con una conclusione da dentro l'area. E' il segnale che dà la scossa e la rimonta gigliata al 22' della ripresa è completata quando al tredicesimo angolo della Fiorentina, Martinez Quarta sorprende Pecsi. Sette minuti più tardi il 3-2 di Moise Kean subentrato dopo l'intervallo al posto di uno spento Beltran. Un super intervento di De Gea, titolare a oltre 400 giorni di distanza dall'ultima volta, a 10' dalla fine, su conclusione di testa di Pisek, sembra quello risolutivo per consegnare la vittoria a Quarta e compagni, ma al 90' Golla fa esultare i trecento supporter ungheresi al Franchi, trafiggendo per la terza volta la porta viola.- Foto Ipa Agency -(ITALPRESS).\nIn Breve\ngiovedì 22 agosto\nChe tempo fa\nAccadeva un anno fa\nAttualità\nEventi\nCuriosità\nTI RICORDI COSA È SUCCESSO L’ANNO SCORSO AD AGOSTO?\nAscolta il podcast con le notizie da non dimenticare\nAscolta \"Un anno di notizie da non dimenticare\" su Spreaker.",
