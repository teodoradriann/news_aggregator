    "text": "Debuta México con derrota ante Curazao en Serie del Caribe 2024\nLa Escuadra Tricolor se quedó a una carrera de remontar las cuatro que tenía de desventaja en la novena entrada\nHERMOSILLO .- Los Naranjeros de Hermosillo intentaron revivir con tres carreras en la novena baja, pero el bateo de Curazao estuvo imparable y el representativo de México cayó este jueves por 6-5 en su presentación dentro de la Serie del Caribe Miami 2024.\nJulián Ornelas conectó dos jonrones, Aaron Altherr uno más y produjo tres rayitas; sin embargo Manny Barreda permitió cinco carreras en cinco entradas de labor que los suyos no pudieron reponer.\nFue la escuadra mexicana la que inauguró la pizarra en la segunda baja, cuando Aaron Alther y Julián Ornelas conectaron cuadrangulares solitarios (espalda con espalda) ante el abridor Cody Mincey, para poner las cosas 2-0 hasta ese momento.\nPero la respuesta del conjunto isleño fue inmediata, y en la tercera alta lograron hacerle tres carreras a Barreda; todas producidas por un triplete de Didi Gregorius cuando tenía la casa llena.\nEse no sería todo el daño que permitiría el abridor mexicano, ya que en la sexta entrada fue recibido con estacazos de Jonathan Schoop y Ademar Rifaela, lo que marcó su salida del juego y la entrada de Juan Gámez desde el bullpen.\nFernando Salas entró a lanzar el octavo rollo por los aztecas, pero después de ponchar a Rifaela también le recetaron un bambinazo, obra de Hendrik Clementina; incrementando así la diferencia a 6-2.\nUn gran hit\nDespués de que Luis Márquez sacara la novena alta con solo un hit, los dirigidos por Juan Gabriel Castro pusieron en aprietos al pitcher ganador, Kevin Kelly, una vez que lograron hacerle tres anotaciones; aunque al final Anthony Herrera dominó a Agustín Murillo con un elevado al shortstop y le puso fin al drama.\nEse último ataque incluyó una carrera de Ramiro Peña remolcada con sencillo de Aaron Altherr, así como el segundo tablazo solitario de Julián Ornelas.\nMéxico se medirá mañana viernes a Puerto Rico a partir de las 18:30 horas (tiempo de Sonora), donde el cubano Odrisamer Despaigne fungirá como el pitcher abridor por los aztecas.",

    "text": "Millions in central US face renewed threat of severe storms, flooding starting this weekend\nThe pattern has flipped with the quiet weather over the past few weeks, replaced by an active one featuring days of heavy rain and severe storms.\nThe next threat of severe storms and flooding is taking shape this weekend as a new system of storms is set to rattle the Plains and Midwest.\nThe FOX Forecast Center said days of heavy rain and severe storms have the potential for flash flooding along with strong wind gusts and hail. The threat of tornadoes also cannot be ruled out.\nThe next storm system is already taking shape in the Northwest and will reach the Plains by Saturday.\nSevere storm to light up Plains this weekend\nThe storm system will move into the Desert Southwest on Saturday before spreading over much of the southern and central Plains. The FOX Forecast Center said moderate instability is forecast to develop along the western edge of the moist airmass from eastern New Mexico into West Texas.\nThunderstorms that develop in this region will likely be severe. Supercells could produce large hail and a few severe 60-plus-mph wind gusts.\nDOWNLOAD THE FREE FOX WEATHER APP\nThe FOX Forecast Center said that on Sunday, forecasts are reasonably good for severe thunderstorms to develop from northwest Texas into western and central Oklahoma northward into Kansas.\nModerate wind shear and atmospheric energy should support supercell development, with a potential for some large hail and wind damage. The threat should persist into the evening as scattered severe storms move eastward across the southern and central Plains.\nBUZZ WORDS YOU COULD HEAR DURING SEVERE WEATHER\nThe multi-day run of severe weather will continue right into Monday with thunderstorms expected to develop along a corridor of weak instability from central and north Texas northeastward into the Ozarks. Severe storms could threaten during the afternoon and evening hours, with damaging wind gusts and some large hail as the primary threats.\nHOW PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS NOTIFY YOU DURING SEVERE WEATHER EMERGENCIES\nSevere weather may persist into Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. However, that forecast remains uncertain at this time, according to the FOX Forecast Center.\nMultiple inches of rain to fall across 20-plus states\nAn emerging flooding rain event is expected to develop over the south-central U.S. by the weekend and early next week. Multiple days of widespread and heavy rain will lead to flooding concerns despite dry conditions over the past month.\nA Flood Watch is in effect for portions of southeast New Mexico and western Texas from Friday evening through Saturday morning.\nThe FOX Forecast Center said the flood threat will grow each day, especially if the same areas receive impactful rain for multiple days in a row.\nSunday, in particular, will need to be watched closely across the southern Plains for more widespread flood issues.\nThe multi-day threat will likely continue into early next week while spreading northeastward over the Midwest in this pattern with the deep moisture locked in place.",

    "text": "In the evolving healthcare landscape, there’s a growing need for platforms that streamline access to investigation treatments for patients who no longer respond to standard therapies. One fitting platform is Earlyaccess.com . It represents its purpose of offering timely access to advanced treatments when standard options fall short. By facilitating collaboration between healthcare providers, patients, and biopharmaceutical companies, such a platform would significantly improve patient outcomes while navigating the complexities of regulatory processes and treatment approvals.\nInnovative treatments offer new hope for patients with limited options. Healthcare providers gain access to cutting-edge solutions that improve care. Patients can receive therapies suited to their needs through clinical trials and investigational drugs when standard treatments fail. This leads to earlier interventions and more personalized care. Ultimately, these advancements improve patient outcomes and drive progress in medical research.\nThe Importance of Access Programs Access programs allow patients to obtain investigational medicines that regulatory authorities have not yet approved. These initiatives are designed for individuals with severe or life-threatening conditions who lack satisfactory treatment options. By participating in these programs, patients can access potentially life-saving therapies, offering hope when conventional treatments have failed.\nResearch indicates that patients who have access to investigational therapies experience better outcomes. For example, in oncology, access to new treatments has been linked to improved survival rates and quality of life. This underscores the importance of creating pathways that enable patients to receive these therapies as soon as they become available, rather than waiting for full regulatory approval.\nHow Platforms Facilitate Access Dedicated platforms aim to streamline the process of connecting patients with investigational treatments. These organizations can facilitate regulatory approvals and logistics for accessing therapies by working closely with biopharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers. This collaboration is essential in ensuring patients receive the care they need without unnecessary delays.\nOne significant challenge in accessing investigational treatments is the complexity of the regulatory environment. Each country has its rules and regulations regarding access programs, making navigating the process daunting for patients and healthcare providers. However, organizations facilitating access can provide the necessary expertise and resources to help patients and providers navigate these complexities efficiently.\nPatient-Centric Approach A patient-centric approach is crucial in the development and implementation of access programs. This involves actively engaging patients in discussions about their treatment options , ensuring they are well-informed and can decide about their care. Education is critical, as patients must understand the risks and benefits of participating in these programs.\nPatient advocacy groups are vital in raising awareness of the importance of access to investigational treatments. These organizations work tirelessly to ensure that patients are informed about their options and advocate for policies that support the availability of these therapies.\nThe Role of Healthcare Providers Healthcare providers are integral to the success of access programs. Physicians often serve as the primary point of contact for patients seeking investigational treatment. They are responsible for educating patients about their options, assessing eligibility for these programs, and facilitating the necessary documentation for participation.\nIn addition to providing education and support, healthcare providers must stay informed about the latest developments in investigational therapies. This knowledge enables them to recommend appropriate treatment options and guide patients through the complexities of accessing these therapies. Collaborative relationships between healthcare providers, patients, and access-focused organizations are essential for optimizing patient care.\nEffective communication between healthcare providers and patients is essential for the success of access programs. Providers must ensure that patients fully understand investigational treatments’ risks, benefits, and limitations. Clear communication builds trust and empowers patients to make informed decisions about their care. Additionally, providers must navigate regulatory requirements and maintain transparency throughout the process, ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards. By fostering strong relationships with access-focused organizations, healthcare providers can stay updated on available programs and treatment options.\nFuture Directions As the healthcare landscape evolves, the need for access to investigational treatments will only grow. Technology and data management advances will further streamline the process of obtaining these therapies. Organizations that leverage digital tools to enhance patient engagement and education will play a pivotal role in the future of access initiatives.\nMoreover, regulatory bodies are increasingly recognizing the importance of providing access to investigational treatments. This shift in perspective may lead to more streamlined regulations and support for these programs, ultimately improving patient access to life-saving therapies.\nConclusion The transformation of patient care through innovative treatment access is a crucial step in enhancing healthcare delivery. Access initiatives provide hope for patients facing serious health challenges by connecting them with investigational therapies when standard treatments fall short. As dedicated platforms emerge to facilitate this process, collaboration between patients, healthcare providers, and biopharmaceutical companies will be vital in shaping the future of patient care. By prioritizing access, we can ensure that patients receive the timely and effective care they need, ultimately improving health outcomes and quality of life.",
