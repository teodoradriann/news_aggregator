    "title": "Retirees: 2 Great Canadian Dividend Stocks to Buy for Passive Income in 2024 | The Motley Fool Canada",
    "text": "Canadian seniors are searching for ways to squeeze more passive income out of their savings to help offset rising living costs. One popular strategy to achieve the goal is to own top [TSX](https://www.fool.ca/investing/what-is-the-toronto-stock-exchange/) dividend-growth stocks inside a self-directed [Tax-Free Savings Account](https://www.fool.ca/investing/what-is-a-tax-free-savings-account-tfsa/) (TFSA). Enbridge Enbridge ( [TSX:ENB](https://www.fool.ca/company/tsx-enb-enbridge-inc/346477/)) is a major player in the North American energy infrastructure industry. The company’s networks of oil and natural gas pipelines move 30% of the oil produced in the U.S. and Canada and 20% of the natural gas used in the United States. In recent years, Enbridge has focused its growth investments on other segments, including oil exports, natural gas exports, natural gas utilities, and renewable energy. For example, the company recently announced a US$14 billion deal to buy three natural gas utilities in the United States. Enbridge stock trades below $48 at the time of writing compared to $59 at one point in 2022. The drop looks overdone. Enbridge’s assets have performed well in 2023, and the company expects the new acquisitions and the ongoing capital program to generate revenue and cash flow growth in the next few years. Enbridge raised the dividend by 3.1% for 2024. This is the 29th consecutive annual dividend hike. Investors who buy at the current price can get a 7.7% dividend yield. BCE BCE ( [TSX:BCE](https://www.fool.ca/company/tsx-bce-bce-inc/338760/)) is another top Canadian dividend stock that looks oversold and offers a great yield. The share price is down to about $51.50 at the time of writing compared to $65 earlier this year. High interest rates are driving up borrowing costs for BCE. As with Enbridge, the company has a large capital program and uses debt to finance part of the overall investments. A jump in borrowing expenses will contribute to a small drop in profits in 2023. Weak ad sales in the media business will also put some pressure on earnings. That being said, BCE still expects to generate higher total revenue and better free cash flow in 2023 than it did last year. This should provide support for the dividend in 2024. BCE raised the payout by at least 5% in each of the past 15 years. Investors who buy BCE stock at the current price can get a 7.5% dividend yield. The bottom line on top stocks for passive income Ongoing volatility in the market should be expected, and further downside is possible in the next few months. That being said, Enbridge and BCE are leaders in their respective industries and pay attractive dividends that should continue to grow. If you have some cash to put to work in a TFSA focused on passive income, these stocks already look cheap and deserve to be on your radar.",

    "text": "LAS VEGAS (KTNV) — A Las Vegas casino operator will pay $720,000 to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit, which was filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Last April, the EEOC accused the Downtown Grand Hotel & Casino of interfering with employees' rights and [retaliating](https://www.eeoc.gov/retaliation?utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_name=&utm_source=govdelivery&utm_term=) against those who exercised their rights. Since at least 2018, the agency's lawsuit stated the casino engaged in numerous instances of discrimination against employees, including \"failing to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities and terminating an employee with colon cancer because he wore an ostomy bag.\" This failure to accommodate left some employees with no choice but to quit, the EEOC alleged. According to the EEOC, they attempted to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process before they ended up filing a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada. In addition to monetary relief, EEOC officials said the casino has agreed to put measures in place to address and prevent disability discrimination in the workplace. That includes designing an external equal opportunity monitor to ensure compliance, instituting effective mechanisms for handling reasonable accommodation requests, as well as complaints of disability discrimination, and providing training for managers and employees.",

    "text": "Jaipur, March 8 : \"Dharma Guardian\", the fifth joint military exercise between the Indian Army and the Japan Ground Self Defense Force, ended at the Mahajan Field Firing Ranges in Rajasthan on Friday, a Defence Ministry statement said. The joint exercise aimed to achieve interoperability between the two forces and acquaint each other with their operational procedures and combat drills. A 40-member Indian contingent, drawn from a Rajputana Rifles battalion, and a Japanese contingent of similar strength, participated in the joint exercise, whose primary aim was to foster military cooperation and enhance combined capabilities to execute joint operations in semi-urban environments under the UN mandate. Conducted in two phases, the exercise initially focused on combat conditioning and tactical training, accomplished by both contingents. The acquired skills were then applied in the second phase, featuring a validation exercise. Joint activities encompassed establishing temporary operating bases, creating an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) grid, setting up mobile vehicle checkposts, executing cordon and search operations in a hostile village, heliborne operations, and conducting house intervention drills. The exercise also showcased and actively employed new-generation equipment by both armies. The closing ceremony of the joint exercise was held after the culmination of the validation exercise wherein outstanding soldiers were felicitated and both contingents reflected upon the valuable lessons learnt. A weapon and equipment display and an Industrial Demonstration showcasing \"Atmanirbhar Bharat\" and \"Make in India\" were also organised on the occasion showcasing the ever-growing industrial capability of the nation. Marking a significant milestone in bilateral relationships, the joint training was an undeniable success, promoting understanding, interoperability and strengthening ties between the two nations, Defence PRO, Col Amitabh Sharma, said.",
