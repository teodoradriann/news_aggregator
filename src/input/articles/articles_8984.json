    "text": "Thousands of gray whales are migrating north from Mexico's Baja lagoons in visibly emaciated condition , with some so thin their ribs are protruding. Researchers report record-low calf numbers and fear another mass die-off is underway, per a report published in The Oregonian . Scientists point to the warming Arctic as the root cause of the potential crisis. Melting sea ice disrupts the growth of algae that feeds the seafloor ecosystem, which in turn supports the shrimp-like amphipods gray whales depend on. With less food available, whales are arriving at breeding grounds malnourished and leaving with even less energy to complete their 12,000-mile migration north. \"All the signs are indicating there has been a pretty intensive change in the Arctic,\" said Josh Stewart, an ecologist in Oregon State University's Marine Mammal Institute in Newport. This isn't the gray whale's first crisis. Between 2018 and 2023, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared an \" unusual mortality event \" after nearly 700 gray whales stranded along the West Coast. Though the declaration was lifted in late 2023, spring's alarming reports suggest the threat is far from over. What's more, gray whale calves are nearly nowhere to be found. During the whales' fall southbound journey, not a single calf was spotted — a first in over 40 years of tracking. Now, on their northbound return, only three calves have been observed, compared to 21 just last year. \"The numbers so far are the lowest ever and the whales we are seeing are extremely emaciated,\" said Alisa Schulman-Janiger, a leading whale census worker. \"They have bulging ribs with shoulder blades and vertebrae visible even from shore. It's really just horrific.\" Gray whales are resilient — they've survived commercial whaling and past climate shifts. But their challenges are piling up: warming oceans, shrinking food supplies, and microplastics. A recent study found that nearly 70% of marine mammals sampled had microplastics embedded in their lungs and fat. When whales struggle, it's a warning sign for the rest of the world. These animals help regulate the ocean's carbon cycle and support the food chains that coastal communities rely on for everything from fishing to tourism. A collapse in whale populations signals deeper instability in marine ecosystems, which can threaten livelihoods, local economies, and even our access to affordable, sustainable seafood. The ocean is absorbing 90% of the planet's excess heat, and marine heat waves are now reaching the seafloor, lasting longer and hitting harder than surface events.

    "title": "Florida priest bites woman who grabbed communion wafers | News & Features | ArcaMax Publishing",
    "text": "Florida priest bites woman who grabbed communion wafers Published in [News & Features](/currentnews/newsheadlines/) ORLANDO, Fla. — A Catholic priest saying Mass in St. Cloud bit a woman as she grabbed Holy Communion wafers from him, and the Diocese of Orlando defended his actions Thursday as an attempt “to prevent an act of desecration.” St. Cloud police arrived Sunday afternoon at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church to speak with Father Fidel Rodriguez, who admitted he bit the woman. He told officers the woman, whose name was redacted in the police report, looked unaware of the requirements to receive Communion at the 10 a.m. service. She returned for the second Mass at noon to again demand the sacrament. Body-worn camera video from the St. Cloud Police Department shows footage shown to police by a church representative. It appears to show the woman exchanging words with Rodriguez. It’s not clear from the video what was said. When the priest attempts to place a Communion wafer in her mouth, she aggressively reaches into the bowl. During the struggle, Rodriguez bit her, and the two were broken up by bystanders. “While the Diocese of Orlando does not condone physical altercations such as this, in good faith, Father Rodriguez was simply attempting to prevent an act of desecration of the Holy Communion, which, as a priest, Father Rodriguez is bound by duty to protect,” a statement from the diocese read, adding that priest did not know the woman. “The full video and the police report show the woman initiated physical contact and acted inappropriately. The priest was trying to protect the Holy Communion from this sacrilegious act.” A communion wafer “is not something a person can arbitrarily demand and is certainly not a mere ‘cookie’ as the complainant called it,” the statement continued, referring to how the woman described the wafer to police, according to the report. “… The woman forcefully placed her hand in the vessel and grabbed some sacred Communion hosts, crushing them.” The video apparently came from a live recording posted on the church’s YouTube page that has since been deleted. Another live recording posted that day showed the initial encounter between the woman and Rodriguez, who appeared to explain why she could not receive Communion before she walked away. According to the police report, the woman accused Rodriguez of discriminating against her “based on her sexuality and attire,” which Rodriguez denied. Rather, he added, she was denied because she appeared unfamiliar with the procedure. “You can be gay or homosexual or trans, whatever you want — I’m not judging for appearances,” Rodriguez told police, according to body camera video. “If they know how to do the things, I can give them Communion.” Rodriguez was not arrested, but St. Cloud police forwarded a report accusing him of misdemeanor battery to the Orange-Osceola State Attorney’s Office for review. As of Thursday, no charges were filed. A spokesperson for State Attorney Andrew Bain did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. --",

    "text": "Manchmal sind es die kleinsten, unscheinbarsten Geschöpfe, die eine Krankheit verbreiten können. So nehmen gerade die Infektionen mit einer tödlichen Seuche zu. Die Hintergründe sind erschreckend.\nImmer häufiger brechen gefährliche Krankheiten in Deutschland aus. Verschiedene Gründe sind dafür maßgeblich. Nun nehmen Infektionen mit einer tödlichen Seuche zu, was die Behörden vor Probleme stellt.\nIdyll unter Druck: Sorge nach verhängnisvollem Ausbruch steigt\nIn Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm sorgt ein tragischer Zufall für Rätselraten: Zwei Männer starben binnen kurzer Zeit an Infektionen mit dem seltenen Borna-Virus. Das Virus, bekannt als BoDV‑1, ruft heftige Gehirnentzündungen hervor und endet fast immer tödlich. Gesundheitsbehörden des Freistaats untersuchen nun akribisch, wie es zu den beiden Todesfällen in so kurzer Zeit kommen konnte. Zwei parallel verlaufende Ausbrüche in derselben Region sind alarmierend – obwohl das Virus schon länger im Tierreich existiert.\nDas Virus zirkulierte lange unbemerkt – in Kot, Urin und Speichel von Feldspitzmäusen. Diese Tiere leben häufig in Hecken, Kellern und alten Scheunen. Herbstliche Gartenarbeiten können Staub aufwirbeln, der das Virus enthält. Experten raten deshalb dringend zu Schutzmaßnahmen: FFP2-Masken, Handschuhe und das Meiden toter Kleinsäuger. Solche Hinweise gibt es inzwischen in jedem Amtsblatt, seit das Landratsamt zur Infoveranstaltung lud – weil ländliches Leben jetzt ein Seuchenthema wird.\nVon Einzelfällen zur möglichen Seuche – wenn Infektionen mehr bedeuten\nInfektionen mit BoDV‑1 galten bislang als extrem selten – doch Bayern verzeichnet inzwischen bis zu sechs Fälle pro Jahr. Die meisten Opfer lebten auf dem Land, nahe Feldspitzmaus-Biotopen. Eine Studie bestätigt, dass Menschen am Ortsrand ein bis zu zehnfach höheres Risiko tragen, sich anzustecken – sogar ohne Symptome zu entwickeln. Bislang gab es in betroffenen Regionen keine Hinweise auf asymptomatische Verbreitung, doch das Risiko bleibt unterschätzt.\nMedizinisch gibt es keine sichere Therapie: Antivirale Mittel und Medikamente gegen Überreaktionen des Immunsystems greifen meist zu spät. Dennoch arbeitet die Forschung fieberhaft an Biomarkern, die eine frühzeitige Diagnose ermöglichen. Erste Pilotversuche mit sogenannten Post-Expositions-Prophylaxen (z. B. Interferone) zeigen Hoffnung. Parallel planen Behörden digitale Risikokarten und Frühwarnsysteme für ländliche Gebiete. Denn der Fall Pfaffenhofen spricht eine deutliche Warnung aus: Wo Mensch und Tier nahe beieinander leben, wächst aus seltenen Infektionen potenziell ein größeres Risiko. BoDV‑1 bleibt selten, doch die jüngste Häufung in Pfaffenhofen katapultiert das Virus ins Rampenlicht. Wer in den kommenden Monaten in Garten, Scheune oder Stall aktiv ist, sollte die Schutzmaßnahmen ernst nehmen.",
