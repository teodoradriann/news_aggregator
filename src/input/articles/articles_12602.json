    "text": "El excandidato presidencial por Movimiento Ciudadano, Jorge Álvarez Máynez , informó que se dará la batalla en contra de la sobrerrepresentación en el Congreso por parte de Morena y sus aliados, porque permitirán que se les quiten espacios ganados en ambas Cámaras. En entrevista en el Senado calificó de “fraude monumental” la pretensión de otorgar una mayor sobrerrepresentación en la Cámara de Diputados a Morena y sus aliados, así como recordó que ese tema lo ha combatido y denunciado contra el PRI desde el 2015 “que se da una sobrerrepresentación grotesca”.\n“En 2018 se vuelva a dar una sobrerrepresentación grotesca, ahora con Morena”, recordó.\nLee también Sobrerrepresentación, Un podcast de Ana Paula Ordorica\n“Esto es un fraude, en el singlado, en la sobrerrepresentación que están generando, no debería permitirse, yo hace seis años presente un juicio ante el Tribunal Electoral contra esa sobrerrepresentación”, apuntó.\nDijo que “independientemente del número de legisladores lo que hay que cuidar es que no haya sobrerrepresentación, que haya equilibrio y que los votos deriven posiciones, es increíble que nosotros obtuvimos 6 millones 800 mil votos pues se esté planteando el Instituto Electoral que tengamos menos de la mitad de los legisladores que el Partido Verde, eso no es democrático”.\nPor otra parte, descartó regresar a su curul en la Cámara de Diputados y criticó a quienes hoy alzan la voz acusando fraude electoral , pero ya se reincorporan a sus puestos legislativos, dijo en clara alusión a Xóchitl Gálvez , quien este jueves anunció que se reincorpora al Senado.\nLee también Notifican a candidata de oposición en Morelos, Lucy Meza, de proceso penal en su contra\n“No puedo entender cómo dicen que hay fraude y ya están regresando a sus puestos , pues eso no tiene ninguna lógica, si realmente estuvieran pensando en que se puede dar la vuelta a la contienda, pues no estarían en ese tenor, yo además me siento muy orgulloso del papel que está haciendo Carlos León quien me ha suplido en la Cámara de Diputados”, mencionó.\nEn otros temas, Álvarez Máynez criticó el hecho de que se pretendan realizar reformas como la del Poder Judicial previo a que la Presidenta electa, Claudia Sheinbaum , tome posesión del cargo.\n“Yo creo que deben de tener cortesía política con la Presidenta, que le deben de permitir que la configuración del gobierno de la próxima presidenta de la República se discuta bajo el liderazgo de la presidenta que han electo 35 millones de mexicanos, yo espero que haya sensatez y que le permitan conducir ese proceso”, expresó.\nLee también Sheinbaum obtiene más de 35 millones de votos con el 99.7% de actas computadas\nÚnete a nuestro canal ¡EL UNIVERSAL ya está en Whatsapp!, desde tu dispositivo móvil entérate de las noticias más relevantes del día, artículos de opinión, entretenimiento, tendencias y más.\napr",

    "text": "Facing Linksys Velop Purple Light Issue?\nOn a Linksys Velop node, a purple light usually means that there is an issue with the configuration or connection. This purple light often indicates that the node is experiencing problems connecting to the internet or is unable to successfully connect to the parent node. This can be the result of problems with your internet connection, a weak Wi-Fi signal, or improper node placement.\nThe first step in fixing the purple light problem is to make sure the connection between your modem and the primary node is active and secure. To strengthen the signal, relocate the troublesome Velop node closer to the primary node if the internet connection is operational. After moving, attempt to rejoin after the [reset Linksys Velop](https://linksvelopwifi.com/how-to-reset-linksys-velop/).\nRestarting the node could be necessary if the purple light continues. Wait for the machine to reset after unplugging it for ten or so seconds and then plugging it back in. If the connection is successful, the node will go through the standard boot-up procedure and the light should become blue.\nRemoving and re-adding the node to the network via the Linksys app is an additional option. To reset and reconnect the faulty node, navigate to the \"Device Settings\" area of the app, pick it, and then follow the prompts.\nIt could be worthwhile to restore the node to factory settings and start the system over if the problem persists after attempting these fixes.\nFor more details about [linksys velop purple light](https://linksvelopwifi.com/linksys-velop-purple-light-issue/) issue visit our website.",

    "text": "Getty Images Things are not going well for Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs right now. As the Chiefs' offense sputters, Kelce has taken some criticism, and former NFL tight end Eric Ebron is catching a few shots in the process.\nIn the Chiefs' 20-14 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders on Christmas Eve, Kelce caught five passes for 44 yards. In the aftermath of that defeat, Kelce has been the butt of some jokes online, including cracks about his performance slipping since his relationship with Taylor Swift began.\nOne fan joked on social media that Kelce has essentially been Ebron this season, and the latter tight end saw the post. Ebron had a good sense of humor about it but requested to be left out of the current discourse.\nLeave Me Alone 🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/nGbeFR55L2\n— Ebron85 (@Ebron85) December 28, 2023 To be fair to Ebron, he had a successful eight-year career at the NFL level. While Ebron may not have lived up to the billing of the No. 10 overall pick, he finished his career with 351 catches for 3,837 yards and 33 touchdowns. In 2018, Ebron went to the Pro Bowl as a member of the Indianapolis Colts when he tallied 750 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns.\nDespite his struggles this season, Kelce is still in a position to play for his third Super Bowl ring. The Chiefs can clinch the division this weekend with a win over the Cincinnati Bengals , and Kelce has shown a penchant for making big plays in the postseason.\nOur Latest NFL Stories NFL Week 17 expert picks, best bets, more Jordan Dajani • 16 min read Wilson: Broncos said change contract or get benched Tyler Sullivan • 2 min read NFL Week 17 injury reports: Lawrence, Waddle ruled out Tyler Sullivan • 11 min read Lawrence ruled out for Week 17 with shoulder injury Tyler Sullivan • 2 min read Russ to serve as Broncos backup QB vs. Chargers Week 17 Cody Benjamin • 3 min read Lamb 3 catches from new Cowboys mark; Irvin 'loves it' Garrett Podell • 6 min read Watch Now: Eric Ebron reacts to negative Travis Kelce comparison Austin Nivison 1 min read Week 17 picks, best bets from all of our experts Jordan Dajani 16 min read Bold predictions: Rudolph stays hot Garrett Podell 6 min read Flacco has Browns on improbable run Jonathan Jones 5 min read Playoff projections: Every team's chances John Breech 6 min read Prisco's picks: Ravens edge Dolphins Pete Prisco 6 min read Week 17 injury reports: Lawrence, Waddle ruled out Tyler Sullivan 11 min read Broncos bench Wilson: Landing spots for QB Cody Benjamin 4 min read These six teams can clinch a playoff spot in Week 17 John Breech 3 min read Belichick names his all-time team: Four Pats make list Jared Dubin 2 min read",

    "text": "On December 20th, after submitting proof of MSB registration completion, Enet Crypto Center Limited (hereinafter referred to as Enet) officially obtained the U.S. Fincen MSB license on November 15. This marks a further step in Enet's compliance journey, allowing it to legally conduct currency exchange business in the United States, further expanding its international development space. This establishes a solid foundation for serving global users and enables Enet to provide users with safer, compliant, efficient, and convenient digital economic transaction services\nSince 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission have repeatedly emphasized that MSBs (Money Services Businesses) include virtual currency exchanges and their managers. The regulated entities are businesses and companies related to financial services. The regulatory scope includes international remittances, foreign exchange, currency trading, ICO issuance, and management of prepaid projects. Operating digital asset-related business within the United States requires a license. Hence, Enet’s possession of the license grants it legal status in the U.S., distinguishing it from other irregular platforms.\nEnet Exchange has always sought higher-level and broader development. As a global leader in decentralized exchanges, it is committed to breaking national boundaries and achieving global integration. Based on Enet's public blockchain technology, it aims to realize scenario implementations in various fields, including capital, digital asset management, digital asset payment, blockchain charity, blockchain gaming, blockchain entertainment, blockchain shopping, and blockchain community games, thereby creating a complete decentralized digital asset ecosystem.\nHolding a license is of great significance for current exchanges. Obtaining official permission from the respective countries reflects the strength and credibility of the exchange. For most exchanges, a license also acts as a natural barrier for selection. For users, Enet's compliant operation under regulatory conditions is a major advantage, meaning their investments will receive legal protection. Under official permission, Enet strictly meets local regulatory requirements and user protection regulations.\nEnet will continue to advance its compliance and globalization development, providing safe and convenient digital asset transaction services to more global users. It also calls on other platforms to join the regular development path, contributing to the industry's progress and hoping to achieve industry compliance consensus.\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

    "text": "Leveraging Tech Innovations to Revolutionize Beauty e-Commerce\nPOMPANO BEACH, Fla. , April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- In a world where technology and beauty are increasingly intersecting, eCosmetics stands as a prime example of how to leverage digital advancements and redefine the e-commerce landscape. This innovative platform is not just a beauty retailer; it's a tech-driven powerhouse transforming the way consumers discover, interact with, and purchase beauty products.\nA Tech-Driven Approach\nAt its core, eCosmetics is a testament to the power of technology in enhancing customer experiences and optimizing business operations. Co-founders Alex Irvin and Richard Kirsch , with their rich backgrounds in IT and marketing, integrated cutting-edge technology into every facet of their business model.\nThe eCosmetics website stands out with its user-friendly design, intuitive navigation, and personalized shopping experiences. A Statista insight report from 2024 notes 34 percent of US consumers will \"gladly pay for services that make life more convenient,\" and eCosmetics is aiming for shopping ease by employing advanced algorithms for product recommendations and leveraging AI for customer insights.\n\"When people come to our site, they know we already have all their favorite beauty brands and products,\" says Michelle Chase , eCosmetics' Director of Account Management. \"But we also want them to fall in love with something new they may not have found otherwise. Using AI and learning algorithms, we can ensure every customer experience is tailored to individual preferences and needs.\"\nBehind the scenes, eCosmetics' technological prowess is equally impressive. The company's sophisticated inventory management system, anchored in its South Florida distribution center, allows for efficient handling of thousands of products. This system ensures stock levels are optimized, orders are processed swiftly, and customers receive their purchases promptly – all key factors in building customer trust and loyalty.\nOther tech-driven efforts include the brand's new subscription service. When a customer knows they need consistent refills of their favorite hair or skincare, those go-to products can be sent automatically to their door without needing to place a new order each time.\nData-Driven Marketing\nUnder the leadership of Irvin, eCosmetics' marketing strategies are a blend of creativity and data-driven precision. By harnessing the power of big data, the company gains valuable insights into consumer behavior, market trends, and campaign performance.\nIn a 2023 Statista survey, nearly 58 percent of Millennials consumers and more than 40 percent of Gen X and Baby Boomers wanted personalized product recommendations while shopping online. The eCosmetics team is looking into its own intelligent virtual assistant or sales chatbot for simple customer inquiries as well as individualized recommendations. According to PwC, customers are willing to pay up to 16 percent more for similar services.\nThis data-centric approach enables eCosmetics to craft targeted marketing campaigns, optimize customer acquisition costs, and, ultimately, drive sales and revenue growth.\nFutureproofing Through Innovation\nLooking to the future, eCosmetics shows no signs of complacency. The company is exploring emerging technologies, such as augmented reality (AR) for virtual product try-ons—a market projected to grow through 2028—and even blockchain technology for security and transparency. These forward-thinking initiatives keep eCosmetics ahead of the curve and signal the brand's commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction.\nA shining example of how technology can be harnessed to revolutionize an industry, eCosmetics blends the allure of beauty with the efficiency of technology. It's not just meeting the current demands of the e-commerce world; it's setting new standards for what's possible in online retail. As technology evolves, eCosmetics remains poised at the forefront, ready to embrace the next wave of digital innovations in the beauty industry.\nAbout eCosmetics\neCosmetics is a beauty and fashion online retailer based out of Pompano Beach, FL.

    "text": "Brittany Mahomes Shares ‘Frozen Visuals’ from Arrowhead, While Expressing Delight to See Fans Fill the Stands Despite Harsh Weather [Vasudha Mudgal](/author/vasudhamudgal/) |Published As the [Kansas City Chiefs](https://thesportsrush.com/tag/kansas-city-chiefs/) geared up for their matchup against the [Miami Dolphins](https://thesportsrush.com/tag/miami-dolphins/), [Brittany Mahomes](https://thesportsrush.com/tag/brittany-mahomes/) took to Instagram to share an insider’s view of the wintry conditions at Arrowhead Stadium. Her posts were a vivid portrayal of the freezing weather gripping Kansas City, where even the windows needed a bit of extra attention. Despite the spine-chilling cold, fans filled up the stadium in hordes, making it a vision in red, something Brittany expressed her appreciation for. Advertisement The first story Brittany shared was a lighthearted look at the pre-game window cleaning. Due to the intense cold, the windows had frosted over, turning the stadium’s serene views into a hazy wonderland. In her video, Brittany can be seen saying, “Keep up the hard work, boys,” with fellow suite members sharing a laugh at the situation, highlighting the efforts taken to keep everything in top shape despite the chilly weather.

The stands, she anticipated, might not fill up due to the extreme cold. Yet, to her delight and perhaps surprise, the Chiefs Kingdom showed up in full force. Her story, aptly captioned “Chiefs Kingdom, be showing up,” captured the essence of the fans’ unwavering support for their team. Brittany’s last visual was a stark reminder of the day’s freezing conditions. A window, which she showed in her story, was [jammed due to the cold](https://thesportsrush.com/nfl-news-frozen-opaque-suite-windows-at-arrowhead-forces-fans-to-contemplate-if-swifties-would-riot-in-case-they-cant-see-their-goddess/). This was a day when Arrowhead Stadium, with its open dome, could not escape the grip of winter. The Chiefs and Dolphins braved these “dangerously cold temperatures” for a night of thrilling NFL playoff action. Brittany Mahomes Slays in Red and White Brittany’s Instagram was not just about the cold. It was also a canvas for her personal moments and her support for the team. She was seen donning a striking red jacket emblazoned with Patrick’s number, paired with a white furry beanie. Her smile radiated warmth, even in the icy conditions. The red jacket was a twinning moment with her new bestie and new addition to the Chiefs’ WAGs club, [Taylor Swift](https://thesportsrush.com/nfl-news-adorned-with-custom-travis-kelce-special-jacket-taylor-swift-arrives-at-freezing-arrowhead-to-witness-dolphins-vs-chiefs-game/). One heartwarming picture showed Brittany and Patrick sharing a kiss—a moment of support and luck before the game. Another touching image had Brittany wishing Patrick luck, her hand gently resting on his cheek. These moments, encapsulated in her caption “LETS DO THIS❄️”, drew lots of love and support from the fans in the comment section. Advertisement Loading embed tweet https://twitter.com/Vasudha46198333/status/1746390994986434578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Fans and friends alike chimed in with encouraging words. Designer Kristin, responsible for Brittany and Taylor’s stunning looks, commented, “You look amazing Stay warm and go get that W ” Other comments ranged from admiration for the couple’s bond to enthusiastic cheers for the Chiefs. Another one noted, “That last picture is so cool and so pretty.” A comment read, “GO CHIEFS” A fan wrote praising Brittany and her love for Patrick, “I how you support your man and his team! Way to go girl!.” In the frosty embrace of Arrowhead, Brittany Mahomes’ Instagram stories warmed hearts, showcasing the unshakeable spirit of Chiefs fans and the power of love and support, even on the coldest of game nights. And the Chiefs overcame the cold on their home field to dominate the Dolphins during the spectacular win. Advertisement Share this article",

    "text": "新京報訊（記者孫海光）2025年中關村街道體育嘉年華啟動儀式暨「體育中的力學」科普活動6月12日在中國科學院力學研究所舉行。乒乓球世界冠軍劉國正和中科院力學研究所研究員、博士生導師韓桂來共同帶來一堂「力學課」，通過力學解讀諸如乒乓球由小改大的影響、擊打時旋轉背後的科學原理。\n今年的中關村街道體育嘉年華從6月開啟，一直持續至10月，其間將舉辦五人製足球、乒乓球、羽毛球、三人籃球、定向越野五個項目比賽，不僅為員工提供展示自我風采的平台，還為企業間搭建了促進溝通、增進瞭解的橋樑。\n啟動儀式上，劉國正和韓桂來一同為大家帶來一堂別開生面的「力學課」。劉國正介紹，國際乒聯這些年有過多項改革，其中一項是2000年的「小球變大球」，由之前38毫米的賽璐珞球改為40毫米的塑料球，自己職業生涯也經歷了這次改革。\n劉國正介紹，38毫米的小球旋轉、力量、速度更快。改為40毫米大球後，旋轉偏弱了一些，彈跳也不像小球往前衝得多，反倒是向上的彈跳增加了。劉國正稱小球時代以旋轉為主，大家主要打前三板，水平越高的球員手腕、手指上的活兒越細，旋轉也更強。改為40毫米大球後更看重速度，如今大部分球員都是在中近台，比的是速度上的強對抗，「如果誰往後退一點，第一陣地就沒了，速度沒了，優勢也就弱了。」\n隨後，韓桂來則通過一組數據印證了劉國正的話，當乒乓球從38毫米改為40毫米時，隨著球截面積的增加，40毫米的球所受的空氣阻力較38毫米增加10.8%，為實現旋轉需要付出的轉動慣量則增加30.1%。如果是50毫米的超大球，所受空氣阻力較38毫米增加73.1%，轉動慣量則增加了216.2%。\n不同尺寸乒乓球在空氣阻力、轉動慣量等數據上有很大差別。 主辦方供圖 韓桂來介紹，不同尺寸的球在加速度方面也有很大差距。看上去只有零點零幾牛頓的差距，但它的加速度已經達到了重力加速度，「如果以這個速度踩刹車的話，（駕駛員）臉基本可以撞到擋風玻璃了，還是非常明顯的。」\n在與乒乓球愛好者的對練過程中，劉國正分別使用了38毫米、40毫米和50毫米的球，以此展示不同用球在旋轉、速度等方面的不同。劉國正介紹國際乒聯的每次改革非但沒有縮小世界和國乒的差距，反倒越拉越大，這就是國乒的精神和文化傳承，不僅成績上要穩定，更要保持技術上的優勢。\n劉國正表演指尖轉球，轉速最高可達每秒150圈。 主辦方供圖 活動現場，劉國正還表演了近來在網絡上很火的指尖轉球。韓桂來介紹，指尖轉球原理是通過球拍給出的摩擦力，讓球有一個高速的旋轉。目前，最高紀錄可以達到一秒鍾轉150圈。\n此外，啟動儀式現場還設有互動體驗區域，開展巧取乒乓、碰撞彈力秀、飛羽工坊等小遊戲，巧妙普及了向心力、動量守恒等物理原理，旨在通過多元化的方式展示力學在體育中的獨特作用，吸引大眾參與體育活動的同時，普及力學知識。\n編輯 張牽\n校對 張彥君",
