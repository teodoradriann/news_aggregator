    "text": "According to the Liberian presidency, at least 40 people died in the explosion of a tanker truck late Tuesday, December 26. In a locality in the center of the country, a vehicle overturned on the road, then local residents tried to get gasoline, but an explosion occurred.\nIt is a horror scene already seen in many other countries. On Tuesday, a tanker truck was involved in an accident in the town of Totota located in Bong County. The heavy goods vehicle finally lay down on the roadway, then local residents rushed to siphon off the gasoline.\nWitnesses described people climbing onto the truck, others with containers, trying to collect the fuel, and others hitting the tank with iron bars to release more liquid.\nBut eventually the vehicle exploded, burning dozens of people alive. Several victims were so affected that their bodies were no longer recognizable, dozens of other injured were transported to various hospitals in the region, some were in critical condition, raising fears of an increasingly heavy toll over the years. days.\nThe outgoing Liberian president offered his sincere condolences, speaking about deeply shocking images. George Weah called on Liberians to show solidarity with bereaved families, before assuring\nhealth authorities of his support to release more resources to save as many lives as possible.\nWith PressAfrik",

    "text": "The administration's suggestion that psychotropic drugs pose a 'threat' to children has raised fears that a new presidential commission could recommend limiting medication access. The Trump administration's plans to study the \"threat\" posed by psychiatric medications in children have medical societies and mental health professionals concerned that the administration may be considering restrictions on the use of psychotropic drugs in pediatric patients.\nAn executive order signed last week created the \"Make American Healthy Again Commission\" to investigate the nation's \"escalating health crisis,\" particularly in child health. Recently confirmed Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will chair the effort.\nAs part of its investigation, the executive order directed the commission to assess \"the prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs.\"\nA report on the commission's findings is due in a little less than 100 days. Eighty days later, the commission must submit recommendations for federal action.\nAlthough who the commission members are and the scope of its work is unclear, the language in the executive order — namely the implication that the Trump administration views psychotropic medication as a \"threat\" to children — was enough to prompt psychiatrists from across the country to contact the American Psychiatric Association (APA) about possible limitations on the use of psychotropic medications in pediatric patients.\nMarketa Wills, MD, MBA\n\"It's concerning and surprising that some of our nation's most vulnerable children who need these treatments to participate fully in life would be under scrutiny in this way,\" Marketa Wills, MD, MBA, chief executive officer and medical director for the APA, told Medscape Medical News.\n\"If these medications are under threat and children decompensate that would not be good from a public health perspective, for the health care system or for the families we serve,\" Wills said.\nPast Comments Fuel Distress\nPast comments by the commission chair…\nKelli Whitlock Burton",

    "title": "Opinion: I’m a Christian who underwent IVF in Alabama. The state supreme court decision is devastating | CNN",
    "text": "Having struggled with infertility, I’ve spent nearly all of the past 10 years focusing solely on creating life. Our two children were conceived in Alabama through in-vitro fertilization (IVF), the science of creating, freezing and attempting to implant embryos in my womb. And although IVF is very much a wonder of modern science, as a Christian, I believe it is a gift from God. But last week, a majority of justices on the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos should be considered children, and that those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death. The decision could have wide-reaching ramifications for adults across the country whose only remaining chance of creating a child is IVF, which involves creating and freezing multiple embryos. And it also leaves countless would-be parents in the state right now without a path to conceiving the babies they so desperately want. We first turned to IVF after about a year of a different fertility treatment — intrauterine insemination (IUI) — which took me on a monthly roller coaster from optimism during ovulation to devastation when I menstruated. Unlike some people with infertility, I was relieved when my doctor recommended we move on to IVF, which has a much higher success rate. But my body was not done being cruel to my dream of motherhood. While I was able to give birth to my son, we had to use a surrogate to have another child — my daughter. During our excruciating IVF journey, we transferred a total of 12 embryos into my body, and I mourned the loss of all the ones that did not lead to a viable pregnancy. But if I regarded every one of my lost pregnancies as a living child, I might have permanently surrendered to the darkness and depression that engulfed me every time I miscarried. I have family members in heaven who I believe have embraced these lost babies — but they were never babies here. They were our attempt to create a child. Now the court’s ruling giving them personhood status will ironically make it impossible for others to do the same out of fear of potential consequences. Fertility doctors in Alabama — many of whom have already suspended care in the state — might now wonder whether they can be charged with murder or subject to a wrongful death lawsuit. Women who miscarry an embryo implanted through IVF may wonder if their actions are illegal, and if so, whether they will be prosecuted. We have one embryo remaining in a Birmingham fertility clinic and have considered donating it to be used for scientific research, which could help save lives or increase the chances of parenthood for someone else. But following this court decision, could we be criminally charged for donating a mass of cells, which only exist because we chose to create them? As a Christian who has led a Bible study for women struggling with infertility, I am upset that the court’s chief justice invoked religion to explain his decision. In referring to a 2018 “sanctity of unborn life” amendment to the state constitution, Chief Justice Tom Parker cited the book of Jeremiah, writing, “It is as if the People of Alabama took what was spoken of the prophet Jeremiah and applied it to every unborn person in this state: ‘Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, Before you were born I sanctified you.’” Justice Parker also quoted Genesis, stating, “Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.” I treasure the Bible’s teachings, and for us, creating embryos was the only path to fulfilling the Bible’s command to be fruitful and multiply. But I also know that it’s not my place to impose my religious beliefs on others, and I also know that religious beliefs are not the basis of law in our country. I’d like to know how many of the justices who conferred personhood on embryos know someone who had to create and miscarry multiple embryos in order to finally have a child. Instead of protecting life, the decision to equate frozen embryos with a living, breathing baby could end the practice of IVF and prevent millions of wanted and loved children from ever being created. In its zeal to uphold Christianity, the Alabama Supreme Court may have ended the dream of a family for millions of people who want nothing more than the chance to bring a baby into the world. Our daughter, who just celebrated her first birthday, is named after our fertility doctor and the wonderful woman who carried her for nine months. We, that doctor and her gestational surrogate all used the wonder of science to give her life. How devastating to think that if we were in the midst of IVF transfers right now, the court’s decision would have denied her the life she now lives with us.",

    "text": "\"Hay cosas que no están al alcance de nuestras manos para poder pelear\". [Claudio Bravo](https://www.ole.com.ar/tema/claudio-bravo.html) fue el arquero de Chile durante la última [Copa América](https://www.ole.com.ar/tema/copa-america.html). El futbolista del equipo que dirige [Ricardo Gareca](https://www.ole.com.ar/tema/ricardo-gareca.html) habló a menos de un mes del final del certamen y expuso fuertes sospechas sobre la cuestión arbitral. \"Ya en el primer partido observas cosas raras (contra Perú). Hay cobros, situaciones dentro del juego que cuando te toca estar adentro compitiendo, te dan ganas de agarrar al árbitro del cuello\", aseguró. \"El segundo partido (contra la Selección Argentina) es exactamente igual. Miras cosas que no pasan habitualmente\", argumentó el ex compañero de Lionel Messi en el Barcelona. “El último partido me tocó vivirlo de afuera y cuando estás afuera, estás pendiente de más detalles, puedes ver más cosas, y dices: ‘Hay cosas que no puedes competir’\", contó el arquero. \"En el último partido me dio la sensación que, si no era la expulsión, o si nosotros nos poníamos en ventaja, cobraban un penal luego. Me da esa sensación\", aseguró en diálogo con el canal de Youtube El Legado. Bravo cuestionó al referí colombiano Wilmar Roldán, que dirigió el match contra Canadá: \"Cuando el árbitro a ti te permite que le digas 1.200 a la cara y de esas 1.100 son insultos, y él no te dice nada, tú dices: ‘Mierda, este me está cagando’. Me está permitiendo decirle mil cosas a la cara y que no me diga nada, que no me sancione, no lo ponga en el acta, es obvio. Esas situaciones son raras. Lo del manotazo, que lo vio todo el mundo, cómo no lo van a ver con toda la tecnología\", explicó. La jugada a la que hace referencia Bravo [ es una agresión a Rodrigo Echeverría no sancionada por Roldán](https://www.ole.com.ar/copa-america/chile-canada-var-wilmar-roldan-jugadas-polemicas-copa-america_0_lOW5spUTR2.html).
