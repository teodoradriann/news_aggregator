    "title": "Hajj: The blessed journey (II)",
    "text": "All praise belongs to Allah (SWT) alone. Peace and blessings of Allah be upon the seal of Prophets, Muhammad bin Abdullahi, his family, and companions.\nAllah (SWT) says to His servants who receive salvation and success in this world and the hereafter; “They exhort one another to truth, and exhort one another to patience.” Allah (SWT) further says: “And help one another in goodness and fear of Allah, and do not help one another in sin and transgression.” We ask Allah (SWT) to accept from all of us our striving, and our good deeds towards the course of authentic worship, Al-Islam, including hajj.\nIt is advised that one who intends to embark on pilgrimage to the Sacred House of Allah (SWT) should acquaint himself or herself with the dos and don’ts. It is of great importance that Muslim pilgrims take to the list of advice offered here, to start with. Pilgrims should remember that they are on a blessed journey, a journey based on Tawheed (Islamic monotheism), faithfulness to Allah (SWT), responding to His call, and in obedience to His commands, hoping the reward of the Almighty.\nThe pilgrims should also be prepared to take to the Sunnah of the Prophet (SAW) in all they do on hajj. They should not forget that the reward for a hajj pilgrimage which is acceptable to Allah (SWT) is Jannah (paradise).\nPilgrims must guard against the evils of the accursed Satan who intends to cause dissention among the pilgrims. Satan is an enemy lying in ambush for every spirited Muslim, much more the pilgrims on hajj. Pilgrims should love one another as brothers and sisters. They should avoid disputes and any intransigence which may lead to disobeying the dictates of Allah (SWT). The Prophet (SAW) endeared us to understand that “none of you has truly believed unless he likes for his brother what he likes for himself.”\nPilgrims should not hesitate to find out on issues that may border on Islam, particularly the rites of hajj, by asking questions. They should not shy away from approaching fellow Muslims who are knowledgeable enough to explain these issues with them. This is because Allah (SWT) instructs, “Ask the people of the Reminder if you do not know.” Rossullullahi (SAW) said, “When Allah intends good for someone, He gives him understanding of the religion.” One specific reason for the pilgrims to imbibe this attitude is that Allah (SWT) has made certain acts of worship fard (duty, obligation), whereas others are essentially Sunnah.\nIt is very important for the pilgrims to know that Allah (SWT) does not accept the Sunnah from a Muslim who ignores and violates the fard. During the hajj rites, some pilgrims are found wanting. They cause harm to others, men and women, by being overzealous in their attempt to kiss the Black Stone, or in circumambulating the Ka’aba, or in their bid to observe solat behind the Station of Prophet Ibraheem (A.S.), or to drink from Zamzam and any other similar hajj rites. All of these are hajj rituals which are not fard. They are sunnah. Harming or inflicting injuries on fellow pilgrims is prohibited. Therefore, pilgrims must avoid hurting one another. May Allah (SWT) grant all the pilgrims immense reward for their perseverance and patience.\nTo guarantee safety and ensure a hitch-free hajj exercise, the pilgrims must be schooled on certain misconceived practices during hajj. It is wrong for a male Muslim to perform his solat close to or right behind a female Muslim in the Sacred Mosque, or in other places for whatever reason. It is female Muslims that are expected to pray behind the male Muslims. It is not proper to observe solat on the pathways leading into the Haram, or in the doorways, because doing so is harmful and obstructive to other pilgrims coming into the Sacred Mosque.\nIt is equally not permissible for the pilgrims to block free flow of other pilgrims who are on tawaf around (circumambulating) Ka’aba by standing near the Black Stone or at the Station of Ibraheem when the site is crowded. This is a potential cause of harm to other pilgrims. It is sufficient to point at the Black Stone, saying “Allahu Akbar.” And when leaving the tawaf area, pilgrims should endeavour to leave gently. Safeguarding the dignity of fellow Muslims is fard (obligatory), and kissing the Black Stone is Sunnah (supererogatory). A fard should not be sacrificed for a sunnah.\nIn case a pilgrim undertaking the tawaf is prevented by circumstances, he or she should continue with his tawaf. He should not point at the Ruknul Yamani or utter the takbir (Allahu Akbar), because that has not been reported from the Prophet (SAW). It is mustahab (recommended) to recite the following supplication between the corner of the Ruknul Yamani and the Black Stone: “Rabbana atina fid dunya hasanatan wa fil akhirati hassanatan wa qina adhaban nar” (our Lord, give us good in this world, and good in the hereafter and save us from the torment of the Hellfire).\nPilgrims should always follow the dictates of Allah (SWT) in the Qur’an and the Sunnah of His Messenger (SAW) in all they engage themselves in in Saudi Arabia during the\nhajj rites.\nRead Also:\nTinubu assures intelligence community of conducive working environment",

This study aimed to examine the stability of anterior open bite (AOB) treatment with clear aligners. This retrospective cohort study included 52 adult AOB patients (aged >18 years; 15 males, 37 females) who underwent nonextraction clear aligner treatment and were at least 1 year posttreatment. Eleven cephalometric measurements were evaluated at pretreatment, end of active treatment, and at least 1-year posttreatment. Overbite change, the primary outcome variable, and other cephalometric changes during treatment and retention were calculated, and repeated measures analysis of variance were performed. Stepwise multiple regression was used to make a prediction equation for open bite relapse. Results The mean retention period was 2.1 ± 1.1 years. The mean change in overbite during treatment was 3.3 ± 1.5 mm; 6% of patients presented relapse at least 1 year after treatment completion. The mean change of overbite (0.2 ± 0.5 mm) during the retention period was not statistically significant (P = 0.59). None of the 11 cephalometric measurements showed significant change during the retention period. The prediction model showed that only the coefficient for a tongue posture issue at the initial examination was statistically significant. AOB was successfully corrected in all 52 patients using only clear aligners with no additional adjunctive aids such as microimplants. When retained with maxillary and mandibular fixed retainers and maxillary and mandibular vacuum-formed retainers, there was no significant change in cephalometric measurements during the short-term retention pe Reference: Short-term stability of anterior open bite treatment with clear aligners in adults.

    "title": "Hurricane Helene Brought Nearly Twice The Water Flow Of Niagara Falls To This 111-Year-Old Tennessee Dam—And It Stood Strong",
    "text": "The Nolichucky Dam outside Greenville has been doing its job of holding back The Nolichucky River since 1913. And even when the deadly storm pushed it lightyears past its limit last week, it somehow held strong, saving an untold number of lives. According to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the Nolichucky Dam withstood nearly twice the water flow of the iconic Niagara Falls during Hurricane Helene—an incomprehensible amount of water. By 11pm on the night of September 27, the Nolichucky River was rising at two feet per hour. At this point, approximately 1.3 million gallons of water were pouring over the dam each second. For comparison, the peak daily water flow of Niagara Falls is around 700,000 gallons per second. \"That gives you a sense of how large of a rainfall event that we're looking at dealing with here,\" Will Reid, deputy commissioner and chief engineer of TDOT, said during a virtual news conference a few days later, per the Knoxville News Sentinel. The next day, officials announced that the dam was intact and that river levels were receding at approximately one foot per hour. “We have determined the dam is stable and secure,” TVA wrote on Facebook September 28. At its highest point, the Nolichucky Dam water elevation hit 1266.0’, which is 9.5 feet over the record elevation of 1256.5’ set on November 6, 1977. TVA is calling the rainfall at the Nolichucky River watershed a one-in-5,000-year event. Hurricane Helene Closes Blue Ridge Parkway Indefinitely In North Carolina Was this page helpful?

    "text": "Cronaca locale Tesei: \"Umbria ha superato con forza Covid e guerra\"9 Marzo 2024 - 14:58 \"Quest'accordo ci permetterà di mettere in campo molte risorse per far crescere le nostre imprese, ma anche per investire in sostenibilità e internazionalizzazione: Covid e guerra in Europa hanno messo a dura prova sia il governo sia le singole regioni, ma noi ne siamo usciti con forza e determinazione\". Lo afferma la governatrice regionale dell'Umbria Donatella Tesei, che ha accolto la presidente del Consiglio Giorgia Meloni per la firma dell'Accordo per lo sviluppo e la coesione. \"Oggi l'occupazione in Umbria è ai massimi storici, mentre la disoccupazione è ai minimi - prosegue Tesei - Lo dobbiamo a un grande sforzo del mondo produttivo, per quanto comunque vi siano ancora determinate criticità come ad esempio scarsa natalità, redditi troppo bassi e sanità pubblica. L'attrattività del territorio la vediamo dall'arrivo degli investitori e dalle alte iscrizioni dei giovani alle nostre Università; sul tema delle infrastrutture finora non abbiamo avuto le risposte sperate, ma con questo governo qualcosa sta cambiando\".

In light of the incoming revenue, MISD will be able to add staff positions at Montgomery and Creekside elementary schools, MISD officials said.\nAccording to MISD’s\n[employment hiring page](https://www.applitrack.com/montgomeryisd/onlineapp/default.aspx?Category=Elementary), the positions posted after the Nov. 5 election for both schools include:\n- Two special education paraprofessionals at Montgomery Elementary School\n- One teacher each for first and third grade at Creekside Elementary School\n- One teacher each for fourth and fifth grade at Montgomery Elementary School\nMISD leaders asked teachers at both schools—some of who have up to 28 students per class while most other MISD classes have 22 students per class—whether they want additional staff hired before the end of the 2024-25 school year, Superintendent Mark Ruffin said Dec. 3. Staff asked for additional help as soon as possible, so the new positions will start in January, if employees can be found, he said.\nAngela Bonilla contributed to this report.",
