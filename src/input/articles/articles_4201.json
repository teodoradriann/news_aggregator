    "text": "A Hopland teen is one of two California high school students recently chosen to represent the state in the United States Senate Youth Program, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond announced this week.\nIn a press release, Thurmond introduced the “two extraordinary high school students (chosen) to represent California in the 63rd annual United States Senate Youth Program as Sarah Gao of San Diego, a senior at Canyon Crest Academy, and Bode Gower of Hopland, a senior at Ukiah High School,” describing both teens as having been “selected for their exceptional leadership skills, noteworthy commitments to their schools and communities, and academic and extracurricular achievements as California’s delegates in this highly competitive program.”\nThese “students have demonstrated strong leadership and a passion for making positive changes through advocacy work on issues such as environmental science, rural education, equity, mental health awareness, health education, and social justice,” Thurmond continued. “Their desire to help underserved communities is admirable — they have set a good example and are excellent role models for their peers and adults.”\n“I’m so honored and humbled to be selected to the USSYP,” said Gower, who is Associate Student Body President at Ukiah High and also “serves as student representative to the Ukiah Unified School District Advisory Committee and a member of the Superintendent’s Advisory Committee where he represents the student voice on the district strategic plan/LCAP and various initiatives.”\n“(Bode) has always had this drive to achieve, it’s innate,” said Mendocino County Sheriff Matt Kendall, who knew Gower’s father Marty before marrying one of Gower’s cousins, Melissa.\n“Marty had a small rodeo arena in Hopland where we used to rope back in the 1980s,” said Kendall, explaining that Marty was 10 years older than him, and died several years ago from cancer.\nAfter his father’s death, Bode asked Kendall to escort him to Mass at his church, and Kendall said they try and go together about twice a month.\nKendall described Gower as always having natural leadership qualities and an ability to influence those around him, especially young people.\n“Plus he’s a handsome little stinker,” Kendall said. “He reminds me of his dad.”\nUkiah High senior Bode Gower on a visit to the U.S. Capitol earlier this year. (Contributed – courtesy of Matt Kendall) Kendall added that while he is definitely proud of both Gower’s achievements so far and his future ambitions, he will also be sad if the teen achieves his goal of going to college on the East Coast, as he doesn’t want another young family member to be so far away.\n“Though I told him if he makes it to the presidency, then I get to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom at least once!” Kendall said with a laugh.\nTo qualify for the USSYP, “students must be (junior or seniors) nominated by their high school principals (and) be actively serving in an elected or appointed leadership position where they represent a constituency in organizations related to student government, education, public affairs, and/or community service as well as express an interest in pursuing a career in public service,” the press release explains, adding that “two student leaders from each state, the District of Columbia, and the Department of Defense Education Activity each receive a $10,000 undergraduate scholarship and an all-expenses-paid trip to Washington, D.C. for Washington Week” in March of 2025.\nIn addition, the delegates and their alternates “are scheduled to be recognized by the State Board of Education during its January meeting in Sacramento next month.",

    "text": "Bummed the no collars can't seem to turn the table. Didn't care too much about Hali, but don't want to see Joe and Jenn go next.\nFuck everyone. Other than Sierra & maybe Jenn there isn't a single likable person left. Hopefully that storm washes them all out to sea.\nAm I the only one who thought that was the best made fake idol ever? Shit looked legit Mike should have kept it and saved it for later\nGreat season so far but all the likeable people are getting voted out quickly. Hopefully Mike can pull it out, but the numbers certainly aren't in his favor. Joe gets a nice consolation prize though getting to share the jury house with Jenn and Hali\nMy initial reaction is that I don't like it. Part of the game is being able to figure out where the votes are going and every vote is accountable. That being said, props to the show for adding new wrinkles.\nShereen is a cunt. I guess I'm team Mike now even though he's annoying. He knows everyone is against him. I would have stuck to my guns and not taken the family note.\nNot taking the family note seems like short-term thinking. Might help you get there, but it will lose you jury votes for sure. Edit: I think it would have been fine to just skip the family note altogether. But after Carolyn pointed out all doing it for $20 and they're all still on even footing, it would just be shooting yourself in the foot not to go along. THEN to agree with everyone to get it, go last, then back out to buy the advantage would just be really stupid. I don't think he really \"realized that was against his morals\" or whatever, either. I think he realized that what he just did was dumb and tried to back out of it.\nthats exactly what happened, but the damage was done. If he was smart he plays it cool and never reveals that he overheard them talking about backstabbing him. then when its time to vote, play his idol and flip the game\nYeah and blowing everything up right after the auction was dumb too. After screwing up at the auction, I thought he had a chance to get back in Dan and Sierra's good graces if he just said \"listen, I know that looked bad but it wasn't because of any beef I have with you guys. It's because I know they're coming after me and you're next\". Disappointing because he seemed to be playing pretty well, but I guess he realized how much he screwed up at the auction and kind of panicked and that was how he thought he could fix it. We'll see how it plays out, but my initial impression is I really like the extra vote twist. It's powerful, but nowhere near the Tyler Perry idol from a couple seasons ago. It looks like Dan leaves it lying around like an idiot next week anyway, but I've been having fun thinking about what the best play with it would be between telling no one, telling an alliance member/whole alliance, telling everyone (which seemed like the best move with Tyler Perry idol. Who would ever vote for you, knowing you can't get voted out?).\nthe tyler perry idol could have been good if the holder wasn't allowed to tell anyone he had it. also, I don't think dan leaves it lying around. its in his bag, and the reality is there is no way for him to hide the thing. wish it was a rule in survivor where a player's bag is off limits no matter what. going into a players bag is just bush league imo\nI think it should be off limits, but the facts are that it's not and a self-proclaimed superfan like Dan should know it's not. You never see people finding idols or idol clues (except Keith's, who I'm pretty sure had never watched an episode before being cast) just lying around in someone's bag because the person who found it went and buried it under a rock or whatever. Either way, I really hope Tyler and Mama C (worst nickname ever?) don't spill the beans to everyone so there can really end up being a crazy blindside if it gets used. Kind of a disappointing season overall. Not terrible, but not great considering it really seemed like everyone really knows the game and came to play. Worst part is there's just no one to root for and really hasn't been all season. Joe just kind of took it by default by not being terrible. He wasn't nearly as good as Malcolm, despite them trying to cast him that way. Jenn was funny but not much of a player and super lame once her BFF got voted out. Dan, Rodney, and Will all come across as terrible people. It seems like they're trying to make Shirin seem like a plucky underdog, but I still think she's probably actually annoying as hell since that was everyone's first impression. Sierra is pointless. It seems like everyone's waiting for Tyler and Carolyn to make a move that is never actually going to come. Mike is the newest best-we-have-by-default, and it seems like he's out soon.\nJust caught up. Sucks Joe got voted off. He just didn't seem to politic enough early on, so when he went beast mode at the challenges he didn't have the numbers to protect him when he lost.\nIt did work. Shirin wasn't making it past another week anyway. He completely fractured that alliance. What a beautiful move by him. Best episode all season. Before tonight, I didn't really have rooting interest in anyone, but now Im Team Mike. That was one of the better moves in Survivor history, regardless of if he makes it another week. Another few thoughts : - IF the blue team would have won by doing the barrel roll/walk to the finish line, that would have been one of the coolest comebacks ever. - LOL @ comparing being adopted as being a traumatic upbringing as being verbally/physically abused.\nWell yeah it worked in that sense but i meant as in no one voting for Shirin. I've been rooting for Mike since the beginning. #TexasForever\nI may be over analyzing it - but I think Shirin going home is still the best outcome for Mike. If Dan left, Tyler probably is able to nip it in the bud for the most part. Now Dan is going to stir up shit and crack up that alliance more than Mike would if it were just him and Shirin\nThe \"Shirin will never win\" line that came up a bunch blew my mind. She gets atleast 4 votes (Hali, Jenn, Joe, Mike) if Mike isn't in the final 3. It always amazes me how clueless some people are, especially Sierra.\nIt's like all these players should know what to do but are too scared? That's why those players never win",

    "text": "The Lady Cardinals have won three matches in a row and ended Bauxite’s season opening winning streak.\nHarmony Grove Head Coach Bailey Korte says they were able to win the match in four sets. “We beat them 3-1, winning the first two sets and then dropping the third and coming back to win it in the fourth,” she said. “The girls played great. I am so proud of how they worked as a team and did things that I’ve known they were capable of, they just haven’t really showcased it yet.”\nBauxite Head Coach Dave Carter says he felt the Lady Miners let their mentality get the best of them. \"We did not do what we needed to do in order to beat a quality Cardinal team that continues to improve,” he said. “They were ready, and they did what they needed to. I feel like we went away from our plan too much, and again made unnecessary errors, especially at the wrong times, and in some ways couldn’t get out of our own way. Add that to some very nice play from their middles, and we couldn’t overcome.”\n“We didn’t have our minds where we have to in order to compete at higher levels. We have to learn and correct errors, improve our mindsets, and grow forward. We have some really tough matches coming up, so it’s now we have to step up.”\nAlthough the Lady Miners totaled 41 kills, it would not be enough to overcome the Lady Cardinals.\nCarter says the team will have to improve their serving in order to be successful. “Our serving game was okay, but Harmony Grove successfully broke our serve well, which neutralized our service attack much more than I am happy with,” he said. “We have to serve better, but also serve effectively. After last week’s poor serving, we improved with fewer errors. I am happy about that, but our focus is both in and tough. We were in more on serves, but not tough enough. “\nKorte says the key to their win was focusing on what they know. “They wanted to win and it was obvious,” said Korte. “We stuck with what we knew and made good adjustments each set.”\nCarter says the team will have to improve their serving in order to be successful. “Our serving game was okay, but Harmony Grove successfully broke our serve well, which neutralized our service attack much more than I am happy with,” he said. “We have to serve better, but also serve effectively.

    "text": "2 Dalmatians fight off pack of 4 coyotes to protect their dog walker BOSTON (WBZ) – Two Dalmatians had their instincts kick in when they and their dog walker were surrounded by coyotes Wednesday in Boston. Dog walker Josstin Lantadilla was out for a nighttime walk with two Dalmatians, Deanna and Tasha, near a Brighton apartment complex. “Deanna got very upset, and she looked up, jumped backward, and I said, ‘What’s wrong with her?’” Lantadilla said. Deanna’s barking alerted Lantadilla to look backward. Turns out, a pack of four coyotes was quietly lurking behind them. “So when I look at the back, I just saw them, I never realized there were four coyotes behind me,” he said. The coyotes were bold and lunged at the leashed Dalmatians. Lantadilla said Deanna bit one of the coyotes in the neck, which convinced the pack to run away. Jane Friedlander, the dogs’ owner, said she is not surprised that her dogs acted so bravely. She said this isn’t the first time her dogs have been targeted by coyotes. Lantadilla and the dogs were unharmed, and their owner is crediting their breed. “They’re meant to drive away coyotes, wolves, foxes, rabbits, anything that would bother a stable or horses,” Friedlander said. There’s no doubt in the dog walker’s mind that the two dogs were looking out for him that night. “Of course, they were meant for that,” he said. Copyright 2023 WBZ via CNN Newsource.
