    "text": "It has been a good stretch in the Ramage garden lately—or at least a busy one. Between harvesting greens, picking the season’s first strawberries, watering young tomato plants, and doing battle with proliferating weeds, my family and I have been spending a lot of time outdoors with our hands in the dirt. This season has so far been laborious but rewarding, and it has renewed my conviction that gardening is far more than just a hobby or a frugal strategy to cut the grocery bill. It is those things, to be sure.\nBut, more importantly, it is a spiritual discipline, a school of virtue. In a world often disconnected from the rhythms of creation, gardening offers a living catechesis written in soil, sweat, and sacrifice. Today, with most educational establishments on break for the summer, I want to reflect on how direct contact with the good earth—the “first book” written by God—teaches us lessons that cannot be learned in school.\nTrue stewardship and creation’s inner ordering\nTo appreciate gardening as a form of catechesis, we must begin with a foundational Christian conviction, one not widely shared in today’s culture: the world we inhabit is not mere nature, but a divine gift that we refer to as creation . May 24th marked the tenth anniversary of Pope Francis’s landmark creation encyclical Laudato Si’ , making it a fitting time to recall a key insight from Argentine pontiff: his distinction between nature —in which people tend to view the world as a system to be studied and mastered—and creation , whereby Christians understand the world as a gift to be received in love.\nYet, as with much of his broader environmental vision, this insight was not original to Francis, for a hallmark of Benedict XVI’s legacy is his emphasis that genuine care for creation begins by receiving it as “a gift of the Creator who has given it an inbuilt order.”\nAs our popes see it, authentic ecology begins when we recognize that the world and its laws are ontologically prior to us. So often today, we treat nature (including human nature) as mere matter to be manipulated at will, neglecting the deep consequences such a posture entails. But to follow the Church in recognizing creation as a divine gift is to acknowledge that it is not something we can make for ourselves but rather something that we receive .\nOur task is to retrieve this wisdom and, in its light, discover how to inhabit the world in keeping with what Benedict called “the rhythm and the logic of creation.” Caring for the world rightly means entering into the school of creation as humble apprentices—learning to calibrate the rhythm of our lives to the inner order of the cosmos.\nAgrarian practices and the logic of creation\nWhat, then, does it look like to become attuned to the inner logic of creation in our lives?\nFor some dwellers of this planet, the answer is woven into their very way of life: These are the people blessed with the demanding yet rewarding undertaking of living off the land for their livelihood. Carrying out their work, they embody a way of life that has sustained humanity from time immemorial. In this connection, the disciplines of shepherding, hunting, and gathering hold a certain pride of place, as these were how mankind ensured its survival from the dawn of our species hundreds of thousands of years ago until the comparatively recent rise of agriculture over the past ten thousand years.\nWhile acknowledging the benefits of these ancient ways of life, our popes have focused more intently on the virtues associated with the comparatively new practice of agrarianism, and so this is where I will focus my attention in the limited space I have here.\nThe Church has long looked to agriculturalists as models of virtue and, in more recent times, as exemplars who might inspire a broader ecological conversion in society. Just as St. James urged the faithful of his time to model their eager expectation of the Lord’s coming after the farmer who patiently awaits his harvest (Jas 5:7-8), so too does the Church today invite us to approach creation with a spirit that balances industrious work and humble receptivity. Describing the farmer as a “model of a mentality which unites faith and reason in a balanced way,” Pope Benedict emphasized that working the land requires juggling several things all at once: understanding the inner dynamics of nature essential to success, carrying out one’s work with the utmost diligence, and all the while entrusting the outcome to divine providence—recognizing that “certain fundamental things are not in his hands but in the hands of God.”\nBenedict suggested that the combination of patience and perseverance in the farmer represents “a synthesis between human commitment and confidence in God.” In short, the farmer’s way of life is presented to us as a model for how we might better learn to rely on divine providence and live in the present, trusting that tomorrow will take care of itself and today’s troubles are enough for today (Mt 6:25-34).\nRejoicing when things go according to plan\nAll this may be true, one might concede, but most of us today are not shepherds or farmers. How, then, are the rest of us supposed to align our lives with the logic of creation?\nThankfully, the virtues associated with agriculture are by no means the exclusive domain of those whose entire livelihood depends directly on working the land. To repeat something I have already mentioned, it is accessible through all forms of direct engagement with creation—be it hunting, fishing, or tending even a modest flock of backyard chickens. Indeed, anyone—even an urban apartment dweller—can find ways to share in the goods of those ancient ways of life.\nIn this connection, gardening in particular stands out as a privileged way for nearly anyone in the modern world to enter into the rhythms of creation. Whether tending a single potted herb or cultivating a sprawling rural garden and orchard, horticulture invites us into a discipline of self-giving in service to creatures entrusted to our care.\nOne notable lesson gardening imparts comes from how it attunes us to the predictable rhythm of life, death, and resurrection through which we are taught a quiet lesson in divine generosity, a living metaphor for the abundance of God’s grace. This rhythm is not merely theoretical but plays out tangibly in our own lives as gardeners. For instance, we witness this unfold each year at our Kansas homestead. As winter draws to a close, the anticipation begins when rhubarb and leafy greens emerge in April. Then come the strawberries in May—this is where we are now as I write this—followed by raspberries in June, blackberries in July, and apples and pears in August. When September and October arrive, melons and pumpkins take center stage if they do not get destroyed by pests, and, if providence permits, we may even enjoy figs before the first hard freeze and snow.\nThis consistent cycle affords our family the joy of relishing a taste of the Lord’s abundance through a cornucopia of fresh salads, salsa, chutneys, pies, sorbets, and more throughout the year. And, of course, this is just a humble example derived from my limited personal experience. The harvest naturally varies from person to person and family to family, depending on our locale, what we like to grow, and how kindly mother nature treats us in a given year.\nSubmitting to the rhythm of creation\nYet, it is not all roses, as they say. Those who have regular, meaningful contact with creation learn a pivotal but challenging lesson: plants and animals follow their own schedule . Those entrusted with the care of other creatures are blessed to be freed of the illusion that we humans are autonomous rulers of creation. While humans like to think that we run things, tilling the Lord’s garden reminds us that it is we who must often bow to creatures’ demands and conform to their needs, regardless of whether it is convenient for us.\nIt is in this vein that Pope Benedict spoke of a relationship of reciprocity between man and creation, “in which we serve nature and nature serves us.”\nThe reality of this is made plain in the simple fact that a cow will not patiently wait several days to be milked, chickens are not going to postpone their egg laying to a time convenient for us, and crops are not going to hurry up and mature so that we can go on vacation. Rather, a serious commitment to care for God’s creatures often requires that we arrange our schedules around their needs, not the other way around. Having ignored this truth more than once, I can attest that being away when your fruit reaches peak ripeness is a sure way to invite weeds and pests, resulting in the waste of an entire year’s labor.\nI can likewise confirm that it is tempting to neglect care of one’s outdoor animals when the wind chill hits 20 degrees below zero or the heat index soars to 110, yet it is not difficult to predict what the outcome will be if fail to submit to the rhythms and demands of nature for a single day in the heart of winter or heat of summer. In this way, we begin to understand the wisdom Scripture offers. After passing by the neglected field of a sluggard and seeing it overgrown with thorns, Solomon reflects that he received this “instruction” from the scene:\nA little sleep, a little slumber,\na little folding of the hands to rest,\nand poverty will come upon you like a robber,\nand want like an armed man (Prov 24:30–34).\nSolomon shows us that creation is a teacher for those who observe it carefully, and this allowed him to understand that even a single misstep amid a long journey of careful labor in the garden can end in total failure. In this way, tending the soil trains the soul in the vigilance that is also demanded in the spiritual life, where even a moment’s lapse in watchfulness can result in dire consequences.\nLearning lessons when things go sideways\nThis leads us to another sobering lesson that impresses itself upon us when we garden, which is the fact that we are entirely dependent upon the mercy of God for all that we do. As the Ramage household savors last year’s fruit from the deep freezer at the same time that the next harvest begins to ripen, we must beware of growing complacent about the preciousness of this gift and the immensely complex and delicate processes that must align to make it possible. Yes, one year we may have such an abundance of tomatoes that eating them all becomes a tedious chore. But other years, we enjoy a particular crop only briefly and in very limited supply, or even not at all.\nThis past year, for example, we were only able to harvest a handful of peaches and plums thanks to a late spring freeze. In this, we encounter a living lesson about grace: that we are finite creatures wholly dependent on God, who owes us nothing and often allows us to experience want, even as he so often provides in abundance.\nIt is striking how often things go wrong in our gardens—times when we have done everything right, only to see everything end up falling apart. For example, I can raise poultry for months only to find chickens dead at the mouth of a predator. I can nurse a tomato plant all season long only to see it suddenly die of an unforeseen infection, and I can expectantly watch a fruit tree grow for years only to see its life cut short by a severe storm. Anyone involved in horticulture can testify to the wisdom of Norman Wirzba’s words when he calls this dynamic “a form of catechesis that helps us come to terms with our own need and impotence.”\nGardening brings us face to face with our own ignorance , our inability to plumb the full depths of the complex natural dynamics that undergird a fruitful harvest. It also reveals our impatience , as when the urge to hasten God’s plan backfires, and we end up killing a plant with too much fertilizer (I might have committed that crime a few times). Oftentimes, gardening reveals a complete inability to do anything whatsoever to avert disaster in the form of a flood, drought, storm, or infestation that might decimate days or weeks, if not months or years, of our diligence and hard work.\nSignificantly, this lesson finds a clear parallel in the spiritual life: we may do all that is humanly possible—live virtuously, frequent the sacraments, and remain faithful in prayer—yet still find ourselves in desolation, feeling as though we have failed. Given the unity of body and soul and the inseparable connection between our interior life of prayer and our embodied life in the world, it is therefore no wonder that gardeners, like those who endure chronic suffering, are often especially well disposed to embrace the challenges of faith. They have already been forced to shed the hubristic illusion that we are in full control of nature or free to impose our will upon it. It is hard to think of a better way of putting this than Norman Wirzba has here:\nGardens reveal that we depend on created forces of life over which we have little control…To garden is to unseat oneself as the center of primary importance and to instead turn one’s life into various forms of service that will strengthen and maintain the many memberships that make up the garden. It is to give up the much-trumpeted goal of modern and postmodern life–individual autonomy–and instead live the life of care and responsible interdependence.\nThis, then, is the overarching lesson we discover when we take seriously God’s command to till and keep the earth through gardening and similar practices.\nConclusion\nIn this brief reflection, I have pointed to a paradox at the heart of Christian living that is embodied in a particularly meaningful way through gardening: by getting our hands dirty, we cleanse and heal our souls. As I have discussed, anyone directly involved in the cultivation of the land enjoys access to a particular way of seeing the world that the average modern person does not. The gardener—and even more so the true farmer whose very livelihood depends directly upon the land—possesses a unique understanding of creation thanks to his intimate knowledge of all that goes into creating the conditions for an abundant harvest.\nBut beyond that—and indeed precisely because of it—he is acutely conscious of the non-inevitability of things. This is crucial because, the better we know how quickly and in how many different ways a harvest can go wrong, the less likely we are to take granted ordinary things like a sandwich or a pie—items most of us expect to grab effortlessly from a supermarket without having to give it a second thought.\nAnd if that were the only lesson gardening had to offer, it would be more than enough. Thankfully, however, there is so much more—an abundance of wisdom that I have only begun to touch on here. Through hands-on contact with the good earth that God has given us, gardening teaches us to live more patiently, humbly, and gratefully. If we are willing to pause every so often and truly smell the roses as we till and keep the land, it reveals a path to greater harmony with God, with one another, and with the rest of creation.",

Elle témoigne également du patriotisme, de l'héroïsme révolutionnaire et de l’art militaire vietnamien. Le général de division, professeur agrégé, Dr. Nguyen Hung Oanh, directeur de l'École des officiers politiques (relevant du ministère de la Défense), a estimé que la grande union nationale, l’esprit \"déterminé à se battre, déterminé à gagner\", l’aspiration de la paix, la guerre populaire consistant à mobiliser tout le peuple pour la lutte contre les agresseurs, constituèrent véritablement une grande force spirituelle qui fut transformée en force matérielle pour la victoire éclatante. Dans la campagne de Dien Bien Phu, la guerre populaire a été planifiée de manière proactive par le commandement général et mise en oeuvre en utilisant de nombreuses mesures créatives, adaptées à chaque champ de bataille et à chaque étape. En particulier, la guerre populaire a été largement utilisée, constituant véritablement en « une bataille de huit trigrammes, combattant l'ennemi dans toutes les directions », a-t-il souligné. Dans cette campagne, la voie de résistance juste et créative, dont l'objectif suprême était de reconquérir l'indépendance nationale, d'unifier la Patrie et de construire un régime démocratique populaire, a été concrétisée en se concentrant sur les objectifs, tâches et tactiques, promouvant la force combinée de la guerre populaire, la force de la nation entière, créant un consensus pour réaliser avec succès les objectifs fixés. La force politique et la force spirituelle de l'armée et du peuple vietnamiens proviennent de la nature d'une guerre juste, de l'esprit du Vietnam épris de paix et de sa volonté de rechercher des solutions pacifiques pour mettre fin à la guerre sur la base du principe visant à garantir l'indépendance, la souveraineté, l'unité et l'intégrité territoriale, soutenu par les peuples progressistes et épris de paix du monde entier. Aujourd’hui, après 70 ans, les leçons de la Victoire de Diên Biên Phu gardent toutes leurs valeurs.",

    "text": "社會中心／林昀萱報導\n▲麥當勞少女遭性侵離職，4個月內3度遭詐含恨輕生，引起社會關注。（資料照）\n北市17歲少女控訴在麥當勞打工期間，遭到李姓主管強制猥褻，並在數月後輕生引起社會關注。士林地檢署經過10個月偵辦，對比監視器畫面、少女同事及前男友證詞，確認少女曾經和李姓主管短暫交往，且分手後仍持續聯繫，且根據對話證詞無法證明違反意願性侵證據，因此判定李姓主管涉強制猥褻等罪證據不足，不起訴。\n少女母親去年底透過社群媒體發文，指控少女在住家附近的麥當勞打工期間，遭主管拉進監視器死角性侵多次，時間長達一年，對方還曾嗆「我富二代你告不贏」，並曾傳訊反問少女「要賠多少」，麥當勞當時認定「性騷擾」成案，將涉案主管辭退。相關案件引起社會關注，檢警介入調查，少女母親曾出面受訪，稱少女去年11月4日藉故去超商購物離家，6日被發現從台北市士林區百齡橋墜河，遺體一路漂流，隔天才在淡水雙溪碼頭尋獲。而少女去年2月從麥當勞離職，同年3月向北市警方報案，轄區警局獲報後，同年5月將案件函送士林地檢署，檢察官7日偵查終結，李姓主管涉強制猥褻等罪證據不足，不起訴處分。\n▲17歲少女在麥當勞打工控訴遭前主管性侵，報案還沒等到結果就離世。（圖／翻攝自當事人Threads）\n據《ETtoday新聞雲》報導，李男偵訊時透露曾和少女交往約半年，期間雖有親密互動但「絕對沒發生性行為」，並提出對話紀錄證明兩人親密舉動都是合意，且分手後少女交新男友兩人仍維持聯繫。另外，檢方根據少女身心科就診資料，並未提到被性侵，唯一只有一名男性友人提到少女曾表示自己遭到性侵，但並未說明加害者身分。綜合多方證據難以認定李男涉嫌強制猥褻或妨害性自主，因此予以不起訴處分。\n對於調查偵結，麥當勞也發聲強調尊重檢方偵查結果，案件偵辦過程中均配合檢警偵查，有關這次事件引發各界的討論與賜教均虛心接受。對於該員工的遭遇以及家屬的傷痛感到不捨；目前持續透過管道，對家屬表達關懷，並願意提供必要的協助與支持。麥當勞表示，先前公布的改善作為，包括加強監督機制、增加監視器涵蓋率與強化性平教育，目前均積極推動中；承諾將以此事件為鑑，致力打造安全、尊重與友善的工作環境。\n三立新聞網提醒您：\n保護被害人隱私，避免二度傷害\n尊重身體自主權，請撥打110、113\n性侵害就是犯罪，請撥打110、113\n三立新聞網提醒您：\n勇敢求救並非弱者，生命一定可以找到出路。 透過守門123步驟-1問2應3轉介，你我都可以成為自殺防治守門人。\n※ 安心專線：1925（依舊愛我）\n※ 張老師專線：1980\n※ 生命線專線：1995",

    "text": "--> D onald Trump, premier ex-président des Etats-Unis à avoir été condamné au pénal, fin mai à New York, voudrait que le prononcé de sa peine soit repoussé de mi-septembre à l'après présidentielle du 5 novembre, selon une requête de son avocat.\nLa newsletter international Tous les mardis à 11h\nRecevez le meilleur de l’actualité internationale.\nVotre adresse email Votre adresse email n'est pas valide\nVeuillez renseigner votre adresse email\nMerci !\nVotre inscription a bien été prise en compte avec l'adresse email :\nPour découvrir toutes nos autres newsletters, rendez-vous ici : MonCompte\nEn vous inscrivant, vous acceptez les conditions générales d’utilisations et notre politique de confidentialité .\nLe candidat républicain, qui rêve de retourner à la Maison Blanche, ne cesse depuis des mois d'user d'arguties pour retarder ses procès et surtout faire annuler ce verdict.\nL'affaire de l'actrice de films X Donald Trump a été reconnu coupable de 34 délits de falsifications de documents comptables, destinées à cacher, juste avant sa victoire à la présidentielle de 2016, un paiement de 130.000 dollars à une actrice de films X pour qu'elle taise une relation sexuelle qu'elle dit avoir eue avec lui en 2006, ce que l'intéressé a toujours nié.\nUn avocat de l'ex-président, Todd Blanche, dans un courrier daté de mercredi au juge new-yorkais Juan Merchan, avance qu'il « n'y a aucun fondement légal pour continuer à se précipiter » vers la date de la sentence le 18 septembre, sauf à « poursuivre des objectifs qui sont proprement de l'ingérence politique ».\nÀ LIRE AUSSI Donald Trump accusé d'avoir acheté le silence d'une actrice porno « Le prononcé de la peine est prévu lorsque débutera le vote anticipé à la présidentielle » et « en l'ajournant jusqu'après cette élection, le tribunal règlerait voire éliminerait les interrogations relatives à l'intégrité des procédures », a argumenté Todd Blanche.\nLa question de l'immunité Dans une autre démarche mercredi, des avocats de Donald Trump ont demandé que le juge Merchan se récuse lui-même au motif que sa fille est liée au Parti démocrate, ce qui alimente « la perception d'un conflit d'intérêt ». Le magistrat, qui avait transmis son cas personnel à un comité d'éthique de ses pairs, a rejeté les arguments « sans substance » du milliardaire républicain.\nSa peine - avec un risque infime de prison ferme - aurait dû être prononcée le 11 juillet mais a été reportée au 18 septembre grâce à la Cour suprême des Etats-Unis. A majorité conservatrice, la plus haute juridiction a, le 1er juillet, élargi le champ de l'immunité pénale présidentielle. L'ancien locataire de la Maison Blanche (2017-2021) estime que son procès n'avait pas lieu d'être.\nÀ LIRE AUSSI Comment combattre Donald Trump ? Mais le procureur de Manhattan, Alvin Bragg, qui l'a traîné en justice, a argué fin juillet qu'il n'y avait « pas d'immunité » dans le cas d'« actes non officiels » d'un président américain.\nCette question de l'immunité et donc de l'annulation du procès de New York sera tranchée le 16 septembre par le juge Merchan. S'il la rejette, il prononcera la peine contre Donald Trump deux jours plus tard, le 18.\nLes mots-clés associés à cet article Donald Trump États-Unis À ne pas manquer Donald Trump promet aux électeurs chrétiens qu’ils « n’auront plus à voter » s’il est élu Présidentielle américaine : Trump promet une « passation pacifique » du pouvoir, à une condition Présidentielle américaine : Kamala Harris devance Donald Trump dans des États clés Signaler un contenu abusif\nMerci de nous préciser le motif * 0 / 1200\nVeuillez saisir le code de sécurité ci-dessous * : Code erroné\nEnvoyer Annuler Un avis, un commentaire ?\nPartagez votre opinion avec les autres membres du Point.\nS'abonner Ce service est réservé aux abonnés.
