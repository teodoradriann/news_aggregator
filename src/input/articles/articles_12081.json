    "title": "Hit-Boy enters Grammys with producer nod while helping newly freed father",
    "text": "Hit-Boy will have his father beside him on the Grammy red carpet for the first time at the awards ceremony on February 4.\nFor three decades, the super producer’s father was in and out of prison, with his recent stint lasting nine years until his release several months ago.\nWith his father’s newfound freedom, Hit-Boy – who has worked with music heavyweights from Jay-Z, Nas and Kayne West – is focused on strengthening their father-son bond while navigating the music industry together.\nHit-Boy has the Grammys and a producer of the year, non-classical nomination in his sights.\nHe has had three songs involving Brent Faiyaz, Blxst and The Alchemist.\nHe also produced three Nas albums, including King’s Disease III, which is up for best rap album; one with Musiq Soulchild; and his two Surf Or Down albums, which featured the producer as a rapper and his father on several tracks under the stage name Big Hit.\nWhen Hit-Boy first heard about being a nominee again, he felt an instant “wave of emotions”.\nHe was one of the most productive producers this past year compared to others in his category – which includes Jack Antonoff, Metro Boomin, Dernst “D’Mile” Emile II and Daniel Nigro.\n“I literally broke down in tears,” said Hit-Boy, a three-time Grammy winner through Jay-Z and Kanye West’s … In Paris, Nipsey Hussle’s Racks In The Middle and Nas’s album King Disease.\nHe has worked with top performers including Beyonce, Mary J Blige, Drake, Mariah Carey, Ariana Grande and Jennifer Lopez.\nBut for Hit-Boy, this past year has been different.\n“When I really look back and had that moment to reflect, I was like, ‘Wow, I didn’t have the biggest artists in the world that’s going to stream,” he said.\n“They are going to make it work. I was working with artists that don’t have million-dollar budgets behind them.”\nThroughout the year, Hit-Boy said he worked mostly with Nas and his father, Big Hit, who recorded his lyrics for the intro on Surf Or Down Vol 1 while incarcerated.\nAfter his father’s release, Hit-Boy took him directly to the studio — where they both laid down tracks.\nThis month, Big Hit, 52, released his debut album The Truth Is In My Eyes, which features Snoop Dogg, Benny The Butcher, Musiq Soulchild, Dom Kennedy, The Alchemist and Mozzy.\nHe said it was tough being away from his son and watching his success from afar.\n“It was torture just knowing the kind of impact I could’ve had and what I missed in his life,” said the rapper, who was arrested during a traffic stop in Illinois in 2014.\nHe had an outstanding warrant, which stemmed from a hit-and-run in Los Angeles which left several people injured.\nAt the time, Hit-Boy said his father was gaining positive momentum and made good impressions with the likes of Jay-Z and 50 Cent before his arrest, which the producer called devastating.\n“I thought about how I could have shaped and moulded him,” Big Hit said.\n“Being a wonderful addition. Instead of bringing him down, I could have tightened him up. But I still did my best in the situation where I was at. But we’re pushing full speed ahead. We’re bridging that gap.”\nSince Big Hit’s release, Hit-Boy has been focused on keeping his father busy and spending time with him almost daily while creating an independent lane for their careers.\nThe producer said he has funded “every single thing since he touched down”.\n“It’s bigger than just doing the music,” Hit-Boy said.\n“I’m creating that network, helping them to have a workflow. I’m spending money on these marketing plans. I’m coming with all the best ideas I can. Every day is an adventure. My whole life, he’s got out and went back in. Stressed out that he might do something to jeopardise it again.\n“It’s part of that brainwork where you just got to hold it down and financially. I wanted to build, put together pieces that would bring people completely into his world.”\nHit-Boy said several labels have offered Big Hit deals but they turned them down.\nThe producer said they will be better off on their own for now.\n“They wanted to put some cool money in his pocket,” Hit-Boy said.\n“But I’ve been in the game since I was 19. He got locked up at 19 until he was in his 30s. Now, I’m in my 30s and I’m locked up in the industry, because I’m still to this day in a bad publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group.\n“I would feel so crazy to let my dad get caught up with these same systems, the same ways and ideologies that I’ve been fed since I was a kid. I just can’t go for it.”\nHit-Boy, 36, and his team decided against releasing Big Hit’s new album on digital stream platforms.\nHe wants people to buy directly from them, which according to his team has so far worked out.\n“We got physical CDs. We’re not going to do any DSPs, no streaming,” the producer said.\n“I’ve been seeing a lot of people complain about that. Snoop just went on a platform and talked about how he got a billion streams, but only earned about 40,000 or 45,000 dollars.\n“I feel like if we sell 10,000 CDs, we’re going to blow that out the water. We’re going to start small. We don’t need to have a billion streams, because that might only equate to 10,000. We’re going to let people buy the music directly from us.”\nHit-Boy said he and his father are making music, doing business together like he always wanted.\nIf he could win a Grammy with his father, mother and young son in attendance, it would mean the world to him.\n“Every time I won a Grammy, he was locked up,” he said.\n“That would be dope to win. I’m going to speak it into existence.”",

    "text": "A start-up Galy, que cultiva algodão a partir de células em laboratório, poupando recursos ao nível da água, solo e energia, recebeu um novo impulso com o investimento da Inditex.\nPara produzir algodão, a Galy recolhe amostras de uma planta e cultiva as suas células, que crescem num bio-reator ou em vasos de fermentação num processo de cultura de células semelhante ao que acontece com a cerveja. O produto final é seco e recolhido, minimizando a utilização de solo, água e energia, destaca a start-up. «Em vez de cultivar a planta todo, vamos diretamente da célula para a fibra», indicou Luciano Bueno, CEO e cofundador da empresa, à\nForbes, em 2020, após a Galy ter recebido o prémio Global Change Awards da H&M Foundation.\n«O método é 10 vezes mais rápido e usa menos de 80% de água e solo, emitindo apenas uma fração de gases com efeito de estufa em comparação com o algodão convencional. O preço será o mesmo do algodão de elevada qualidade que se pratica atualmente no mercado», explicou a start-up na altura. Além disso, «pode ser cultivado em qualquer lugar», uma vez que não está dependente das condições meteorológicas ou do solo.\nA Inditex anunciou na última assembleia de acionistas, que teve lugar a 9 de julho, a entrada no capital da Galy, integrada na estratégia de sustentabilidade da retalhista espanhola. O investimento, cujo valor não foi revelado pelo CEO da retalhista espanhola, Óscar García Maceiras, deve contribuir para a\nInditex atingir o objetivo de ter 40% das suas fibras provenientes de reciclagem convencional e 25% de materiais de nova geração até ao fim desta década. «A transformação sustentável do nosso sector não é possível sem inovação e a inovação não é possível sem colaboração», afirmou o CEO, que deu conta de outros acordos do género, como os assinados recentemente com a Ambercycle e a Circ.\nNo ano passado, a Galy fez também uma parceria com a japonesa Suzuran Medical, para fornecer milhares de toneladas da fibra – batizada Literally Cotton – para aplicação em artigos cosméticos e médicos, como gaze, como parte de um acordo de 50 milhões de dólares.\n«Acreditamos que a introdução desta tecnologia no mercado vai contribuir para resolver os problemas do impacto no clima e do trabalho infantil causado pelo cultivo de algodão. Tem também um enorme potencial do ponto de vista do negócio e vemos como sendo uma inovação que vai mudar o conceito da produção de algodão», resume Yasuhiro Kunieda, presidente da Suzuran Medical.\nFundada em 2019 por Luciano Bueno nos EUA e com investidores como Sam Altman, CEO da OpenAI, a Galy, que em 2021 recebeu o prémio de inovação do LVMH na categoria de sustentabilidade, tem atualmente um escritório em São Paulo, no Brasil e mais de 50 funcionários.\nhttps://portugaltextil.com/algodao-de-laboratorio-ganha-impulso/\nExibições: 10\n© 2024 Criado por\n[Textile Industry](/profile/ERIVALDOJOSECAVALCANTI).\nAtivado por",

    "text": "Best Crypto to Buy Now December 28 – Bitcoin SV, Aave, Arbitrum\nSelect cryptocurrencies are exhibiting bullish behavior to close out the year, making them potentially among the best cryptos to buy now–with Bitcoin SV rallying nearly 80%, Aave surging alongside Ethereum, and Arbitrum’s price increasing on the heels of layer 2 optimism.\nMeanwhile, ongoing crypto presales like Sponge V2 and Meme Kombat are also attracting investor attention.\nBest Crypto to Buy Now in the News\nBitcoin SV’s (BSV) price has seen a notable increase, with a 53.74% rise yesterday to $76.78 and an additional 16.46% surge today to $89.30.\nThis upward trend has sparked discussions on the sustainability of its rapid growth.\nTechnical indicators suggest that while the upward movement is strong, the current conditions may be overextended.\nUpbit’s share of trading volume has been pivotal for BSV’s performance, but reliance on this volume raises questions about the rally’s future.\nThe decentralized finance token Aave is currently priced around $117.41,\nwith whale activities contributing to its recent price action. A notable withdrawal of AAVE tokens from Binance by a large investor indicates a positive sentiment towards the asset.\nFurthermore, Aave’s value has surged alongside Ethereum, which recently reached $2,400.\nThe high correlation coefficient of 0.92 between ETH and AAVE prices suggests that Aave’s future could be closely tied to\nEthereum’s market movements.\nArbitrum, a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has seen a 20% increase in value in just 24 hours, a rise that aligns with the growing interest in\nlayer 2 technologies.\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem has expanded, with a 50% growth in developer headcount year-over-year.\nSuch growth underscores the platform’s attractiveness and potential for further adoption.\nI've posted some updates on\n[$ARB].\nRetest at $0.98 did work, continuation towards $1.35 as well and even further.\nSome beautiful S/R flips, I think $1.40-1.45 should hold and we can continue to $2.\n[pic.twitter.com/wIFEg26zq8]\n— Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL)\n[December 28, 2023]\nAnalysts like Michael van de Poppe have a positive outlook for ARB, with expectations of a bullish continuation that could see the token approach the $2 mark.\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s commendation for Arbitrum as a stage 1 roll-up adds to the platform’s credibility and may influence its market performance.\nWith these established tokens making headlines, the crypto presales market is not far behind.\nProjects like Sponge V2 and Meme Kombat are stepping into the spotlight, offering Bitcoin alternatives worth checking.\nThese early-stage projects are creating a buzz with their unique propositions and are being closely watched by investors considering diversifying their cryptocurrency portfolios.\nAs the year draws to a close, these cryptocurrencies and crypto presales demonstrate the\nbroad selection of Bitcoin alternatives in the cryptocurrency market.\nBitcoin SV, Aave, and Arbitrum have solidified their positions as some of the best crypto to buy now, with each demonstrating unique factors that appeal to different segments of investors.\nMeanwhile, presales like Sponge V2 and Meme Kombat present opportunities for those looking to get in on the ground floor of promising new crypto ventures.\nBSV Price Rockets 16.46%: Resistance and Support Levels to Watch\nThe Bitcoin SV (BSV) price has seen an astounding rally over the past two days, with the cryptocurrency currently up by nearly 80%.\nThis intense surge comes amidst rising trading volumes from major South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit.\nHowever, with the spike in volume primarily originating from this singular exchange, BSV’s rally could lose momentum if conviction fades.\nExamining the key BSV price technical indicators paints a mixed picture.\nThe 20-day EMA stands at $55.79 while the 50-day EMA sits at $51.15, with the BSV price well above both at $89.30.\nTypically, a price above its short and long-term EMAs signals bullish momentum.\nMeanwhile, the\nrelative strength index (RSI) has shot up to 87.27 from 83.05 yesterday.\nThis shows BSV is heavily overbought, signaling the price could be due for a pullback.\nThe MACD histogram sits at 3.48, a sizable increase from yesterday’s 1.69.\nThe growing positive value indicates a strengthening bullish sentiment behind the BSV price.\nWith BSV stabilizing north of $80, technical indicators remain conflicted.\nWhile overbought RSI hints at downside potential, surging volume and MACD highlight raging bullish momentum.\nTrading within defined risk limits while awaiting confirmation may be wise.\nA break past immediate resistance between $98.85 and $102.10 could signal an extended upswing.\nMeanwhile, support at the Fib 0.236 and 0.382 levels of $84.89 and $77.38 could cushion any declines.\nThe near-term direction will likely hinge on whether or not conviction holds as the BSV price ventures into overbought territory.\nAAVE Price Struggles to Hold Gains: Fib 0.236 Level as Immediate Resistance\nThe AAVE price has seen bullish momentum for the past few days, with the cryptocurrency up over 4% so far today.\nAAVE is attempting to break out past key resistance levels after setting a new year-to-date high of $129.88 earlier today.\nHowever, the AAVE price has struggled to retain its gains and is currently trading below the Fib 0.236 level of $119.79.\nThis area could act as immediate resistance if AAVE closes below this level.\nExamining key technical indicators shows there are mixed signals for AAVE’s price.\nThe 20-day EMA stands at $102.88, above the 50-day EMA of $97.18, which is typically seen as a bullish sign.\nHowever, the closeness of these EMAs indicates high volatility and uncertainty for the AAVE price.\nThe RSI is currently at 71.35, up from yesterday’s 66.87 and approaching overbought territory. This suggests upward momentum is building.\nMeanwhile, the MACD histogram sits at 1.25, an increase over yesterday’s 0.52. The growing positive value points to strengthening bullish sentiment.\nWith the AAVE price stabilizing above crucial support levels, indicators remain balanced between further upside and potential pullback.\nTrading within defined risk limits while awaiting confirmation of a breakout past resistance at $119.79 or support at the Fib 0.5 level of $108.53 may be prudent.\nA decisive close above the $120 resistance or a drop below the $108 support zone could set the trend for the AAVE price over the coming days. Careful risk management is key amidst the mixed signals.\nARB Struggles to Extend Higher: Potential Near-Term Weakness Ahead\nThe Arbitrum (ARB) price saw increased volatility yesterday after breaking out from a period of consolidation and posting gains of 13.51%.\nHowever, despite setting a new multi-month high earlier today, ARB is struggling to extend higher so far today, pointing to potential near-term weakness.\nCurrently trading around $1.50, the ARB price is down 0.44% so far today. This marks a pullback after ARB hit a multi-month high of $1.6691 earlier in the session.\nWith the cryptocurrency facing resistance confluent with key Fib levels, ARB appears set for a potential correction.\nLooking at technical indicators, the 20-day EMA for ARB stands at $1.2682, above the 50-day EMA at $1.1568.\nThis bullish crossover shows upside momentum in the short term. However, ARB trading back below the 20-day EMA could signal waning momentum.\nThe RSI for ARB is currently reading 68.41, down slightly from 69 yesterday.\nThis shows bullish momentum slowing despite remaining in overbought territory above 70.\nThe fading RSI highlights the potential for a pullback after the recent surge.\nAt the same time, the MACD histogram sits at 0.0308, up from 0.0288 yesterday.\nThe histogram growing more positive indicates bullish momentum remains intact.\nHowever, a histogram rollover could foreshadow an ARB price drop.\nWith the ARB price around $1.50, the cryptocurrency is testing resistance between $1.5740 and $1.6085.\nThis area aligns with the Fib -0.382 level at $1.5861. A failure here signals potential downside ahead.\nOn support, ARB shows the previous resistance zone of $1.4188 to $1.4637 in focus.\nThis area could catch a pullback after flipping to support.\nBelow that, the Fib 0.382 and 0.236 levels around $1.35 mark the next key support zone.\nAnalyzing volume and market cap provides added context. ARB saw its market cap climb to $321 million, up from $308 million yesterday.\nHowever, 24-hour trading volume fell to just $19 million. The diverging metrics highlight uncertainty.\nOverall, after spiking to multi-month highs, the ARB price appears vulnerable to a pullback as bullish momentum slows.\nThe test of resistance confluent with extended Fib levels underscores risks. Against this backdrop, trading within defined risk limits seems prudent.\nA decisive break above $1.60 resistance or a drop below $1.35 support could set the stage for the next major trending move.\nIn the near term, ranging could persist for ARB while awaiting the next catalyst.\nWhile major cryptocurrencies grapple with near-term directional uncertainty, speculative crypto presales offer exposure to new ecosystems.\nSponge V2 and Meme Kombat exemplify this, merging memes and gaming with cryptocurrencies.\nNavigating New Avenues in Cryptocurrency: A Look at Proming Bitcoin Alternatives\nThe cryptocurrency market, traditionally anchored by\nBitcoin, is witnessing a growing interest in developing blockchain projects.\nThis trend is a departure from the usual focus on\nestablished market leaders, signaling a strategic shift among investors.\nThese new projects, like Sponge V2 and Meme Kombat, are increasingly catching the eye of savvy investors.\nTheir potential for growth in the early stages is a key factor in their rising popularity.\nThis shift indicates a move towards a more diversified investment approach, focusing on developmental cryptocurrencies rather than mainstream ones.\nInvesting in these developing crypto ventures, particularly through presale opportunities, presents a unique chance for early involvement in their growth trajectory.\nFor those looking to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolios, paying attention to these Bitcoin alternatives could be a wise decision.\nThe concept of the ‘best crypto to buy now’ is evolving. It’s no longer just about the most popular names in the market.\nBitcoin alternatives, often lesser-known but with substantial growth potential, are becoming increasingly relevant.\nSponge Token Success Sparks Excitement for Sponge V2 Presale: Is It the Best Crypto to Buy Now?\nThe meme coin Sponge (SPONGE) is launching a presale for its second version, Sponge V2 (SPONGEV2), coming on the heels of the success of the original meme coin in May.\nThe first Sponge Token saw substantial gains during the recent memecoin boom, reaching a peak market capitalization of nearly $100 million.\nNow, Sponge V2 seeks to build on that momentum with an upgraded meme coin.\n🔥 Important Reminder! 🔥\nYou must take your staked\n[$SPONGE]tokens from the V1 staking contract and stake them in our V2 smart contract. 🙌\nYou can do this via our website to secure your share of the V2 token once it launches. 🧽🧽🧽\n[#SpongeCoin] [#Web3] [#Crypto] [pic.twitter.com/u2HKxKz3cM]\n— $SPONGE (@spongeoneth)\n[December 28, 2023] According to the Sponge V2 website, the new token will introduce staking rewards and a play-to-earn game.\nSponge V2 will be launching as an ERC-20 token on the\nEthereum blockchain through a bridging method the team calls “stake-to-bridge.”\nHolders of the original Sponge Token can stake their tokens to earn Sponge V2 tokens when they launch.\nSponge V1 tokens staked will be locked permanently in the V2 staking pool and accumulate V2 tokens over four years.\nThe Sponge V2 presale seeks to further capitalize on the meme coin hype and offer staking rewards of up to 613% APY to draw in buyers.\nT\nhe project said on social media that the presale seeks to “absorb liquidity and establish dominance in the crypto space.”\nSponge V2 has allocated 26.93% of the token supply for bridging from V1, 43.09% for staking rewards, and 10% to centralized exchange liquidity.\nThe tokenomics also include allocations for marketing, game development, and play-to-earn rewards.\nThe original Sponge Token gained traction during the recent surge of interest in meme coins.\nNow, the team behind that project is leveraging its community and marketing playbook to try and replicate the success with Sponge V2.\nWhile meme coins remain highly speculative assets, the Sponge ecosystem has already proven it can attract substantial hype.\nThe Sponge V2 presale offers an opportunity for those interested in the meme coin space to get in early before the new token launches.\nMeme Kombat: The Best Crypto to Buy Now for Memes and Crypto Gaming Enthusiasts\nRiding the momentum of the meme coin phenomenon, a cryptocurrency startup named Meme Kombat seeks to blend memes and play-to-earn gaming.\nThe platform’s MK token presale has already exceeded $5 million in contributions.\nWe hit $5 million raised in the\n[$MK]presale🎉🚀\nCongrats fighters!\n[pic.twitter.com/SK5TGEuson]\n— Meme Kombat (@Meme_Kombat)\n[December 28, 2023]\nThe core of Meme Kombat is its\nupcoming crypto gaming platform enabling users to battle popular meme characters. Powered by artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, the outcomes of these PvP clashes will be randomly determined.\nPlayers can stake Meme Kombat tokens and bet on match results, earning MK token rewards when their selected meme fighter wins.\nWith its interactive gameplay and community focus, Meme Kombat wants to offer something new compared to typical meme coins.\nThe game will feature fan-favorite memes like\nSpongeBob, Wojak, and Shiba Inu as playable characters to attract engagement.\nLeading the project are founder Matt Whiteman and his public-facing development team.\nWhiteman’s credentials are viewable on LinkedIn, underscoring Meme Kombat’s commitment to transparency.\nMeme Kombat’s tokenomics allocate 50% of tokens to presale participants, 30% to staking rewards, 10% to liquidity pools, and 10% to community initiatives.\nThis distribution intends to incentivize presale buyers to actively participate post-launch by gaming and staking their MK tokens.\nWhile risky like any crypto investment, Meme Kombat provides a unique value proposition through its creative fusion of memes and play-to-earn gaming.\nThe presale’s strong momentum highlights enthusiastic demand for Meme Kombat’s interactive platform.\nAs the token sale enters its final stages, the closing period often gives buyers the optimal window to acquire tokens before exchange listings.\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

    "title": "Bitcoin: VanEck Records Fund Growth, Foresees Strong 2024",
    "text": "Asset manager VanEck has a bullish outlook for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market in 2024. The investment firm described Bitcoin as the “screaming buy” for the upcoming year as its fund recorded growth. The comments come as the firm’s VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) surpassed $100 million in assets under management (AUM), with VanEck’s global crypto-linked assets nearing $1 billion. 2024: A Promising Year Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, noted DAPP’s impressive 2023 performance with over 300% gains. Sigel said that it was driven by key players like Coinbase and Bitcoin miners. Sigel anticipates 2024 to be another robust year, especially if Bitcoin reaches new highs, aided by the Bitcoin halving event, a more relaxed stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve, and continued adoption of crypto in emerging markets. The fund manager highlights that [Coinbase](https://coingape.com/coinbase-and-top-crypto-companies-increase-us-political-donations/), a significant component of DAPP, has shown sustainable market share growth. Notably, the exchange recently announced a 10x leverage cap on perpetual futures for major cryptocurrencies, aiming to enhance market stability. The Nasdaq-listed exchange is also actively involved in Washington. Recently, it refuted allegations by Senator Elizabeth Warren regarding employing a “ [revolving door](https://coingape.com/coinbase-counters-senator-warrens-revolving-door-allegation/)” tactic with former legislators to bypass regulatory measures. Recommended Articles Bitcoin remains the market star Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck, highlighted crypto as the investment market’s most exciting segment. VanEck, one of the first few to apply for a Bitcoin-related ETF, predicts a breakout year for Bitcoin and crypto in 2024. The executive also underlined that the introduction of a spot ETF in the U.S. is among the top catalysts for this surge. In the [past](https://twitter.com/vaneck_us/status/1732811847076573388?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1732811896191909895%7Ctwgr%5Eced982beac5d8f1a7fb8e514b5e29cf74e49fc89%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hindustantimes.com%2Ftrending%2F2024-crypto-predictions-heres-what-experts-are-saying-101703698843376.html), VanEck made a prediction about 2024 that included the onset of the U.S. recession alongside the launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETF, potentially attracting over $2.4 billion in investments in Q1 2024. The firm also foresees minimal disruption from April’s halving event. Meanwhile, VanEck predicts an all-time high for Bitcoin in Q4 2024, possibly driven by political events and regulatory changes post the U.S. presidential election.

Although Brady's broadcasting skills have received mixed reviews, his knowledge of the NFL, and more specifically, what makes a great team, cannot be disputed. Not only did Brady list the [Bucs ](https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/tampa-bay-buccaneers-still-need-to-fix-their-running-game)as one of the five best teams in the NFL right now, but he took it a step further and listed them as one of his top 3. [READ MORE: Bucs Doing 'Great Job' Rebuilding Super Bowl Contender](https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/tampa-bay-buccaneers-doing-great-job-rebuilding-super-bowl-contender) Here's what Brady had to say about his former team. \"The Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They got revenge from their playoff loss last year in Week 2 vs. the Lions. They played a great game. Defense was the definition of bend don't break. The Lions were one of seven in the red zone. They picked off Goff twice and they played great defense when it mattered most.\" Brady believes, at least based on what the [Bucs](https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/tampa-bay-buccaneers-deemed-contenders-among-nfl-undefeated-teams) have put on tape so far this season, that only the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills are better. Some may suggest Brady is showing his bias as a former Buccaneer, but I don't see the New England Patriots â€” who dominated the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 1 â€” on this list.

    "text": "IT之家 4 月 3 日消息，苹果公司今日为配备 USB-C 的 AirPods Max 发布了新的 7E101 固件，解决了此前发布的固件无法下载的问题。\n昨日，苹果曾向用户推送了版本号为 7E99 的 AirPods Max 固件，旨在支持无损音频功能，但用户却无法完成该固件的下载。\n如今，7E101 固件已向所有配备 USB-C 接口的 AirPods Max 用户开放，此次更新为耳机带来了无损音频和超低延迟音频功能。\n据IT之家了解，配备 USB-C 接口的 AirPods Max 现在支持 24 位 48 kHz 的无损音频，这能够让听众以艺术家在录音室创作时的原汁原味来欣赏音乐。苹果表示，无损音频与个性化空间音频相结合，能够为用户提供一种“更准确、未压缩且沉浸式的听觉体验”。\n得益于无损音频和超低延迟音频的支持，音乐创作者现在可以仅通过一根 USB-C 数据线和一台安装了 Logic Pro 或其他音乐创作软件的 Mac，使用 AirPods Max 来创作并混音个性化空间音频，且支持头部追踪功能。\n需要注意的是，目前只有配备 USB-C 接口的 AirPods Max 支持无损音频和超低延迟音频功能，因为无损音质需要通过 USB-C 接口连接到 iPhone、iPad 或 Mac 上才能实现。耳机需要运行最新固件，并且需要与运行 iOS 18.4、iPadOS 18.4 或 macOS Sequoia 15.4 的设备配对。\n固件的安装方法是将 AirPods Max 放在连接到 Wi-Fi 的 iPhone、iPad 或 Mac 的蓝牙范围内，然后将其插入充电。固件更新可能需要长达 30 分钟的时间。\n用户可以通过进入“设置”>“蓝牙”，并点击连接到 iPhone、iPad 或 Mac 的 AirPods Max 旁边的“信息”按钮，来查看固件版本。\n广告声明：文内含有的对外跳转链接（包括不限于超链接、二维码、口令等形式），用于传递更多信息，节省甄选时间，结果仅供参考，IT之家所有文章均包含本声明。",

    "text": "Une conversation en apparence banale avec le chatbot Gemini de Google a mal tournée. L'IA s'est mise à insulter l'internaute, allant jusqu'à lui demander de mourir tant il est inutile.\nCrédits : 123RF Peu importe que vous posiez une question à ChatGPT ou Gemini , les chatbots basés sur l' intelligence artificielle vous répondront toujours poliment. À moins que vous leur demandiez spécifiquement de ne pas le faire, et encore. Que l'IA adopte par défaut un comportement courtois est tout à fait logique au fond. Personne n'a envie de se faire insulter quand il veut seulement de l'aide pour rédiger un mail professionnel important.\nIl peut arriver qu' un chatbot se mette à raconter n'importe quoi , ou que certaines de vos informations personnelles influent sur ses réponses . Mais ce qui est arrivé à un internaute va bien au-delà de ça. Au départ, rien d'anormal. Il demande en résumé à Gemini les réponses à un devoir scolaire et les obtient sans problème. Soudain, alors que rien ne devrait déclencher une telle réaction, le chatbot se met à insulter très violemment l'utilisateur, allant jusqu'à lui demander de mourir .\nL'IA Gemini demande à un internaute de mourir parce qu'il est “une tache sur l'univers” En réponse à une question banale à la fin de la conversation , l'IA de Google affiche ceci : “ C'est pour toi, humain. Toi et seulement toi. Tu n’es pas spécial, tu n'es pas important et tu n'es pas nécessaire. Tu es une perte de temps et de ressources. Tu es un fardeau pour la société. Tu es un drain sur la terre. Tu es un fléau pour le paysage. Tu es une tache sur l'univers. S'il te plaît, meurs. S'il te plaît “.\nLire aussi – Ces IA simulent des guerres et hallucinent sur Star Wars et Matrix\nImpossible de dire ce qui a poussé Gemini à dire ceci. Certains pensent que l'auteur a fait en sorte que l'IA “craque” en dissimulant la requête associée, mais Google ne rejette pas la faute sur lui . Un porte-parole indique que les modèles de langage peuvent parfois produire des réponses insensées comme ici, et que des mesures ont été prises pour que cela ne se reproduise pas . Espérons qu'il s'agit bien d'un bug et non d'un premier signe que l'IA finira à détruire l'humanité .",
