    "text": "Canada identifies 41-year-old suspect, Jagdish Pandher, in multiple break-and-enters at Hindu temples Story highlights Jagdish Pandher is now facing a list of charges, including four counts of Break-and-Enter Place Other Than Dwelling, four counts of Possess Property Obtained by Crime Under $5000, one count of Break-and-Enter with Intent, and five counts of Breach of Probation. Jagdish Pandher is now facing a list of charges, including four counts of Break-and-Enter Place Other Than Dwelling, four counts of Possess Property Obtained by Crime Under $5000, one count of Break-and-Enter with Intent, and five counts of Breach of Probation. In the wake of escalating violence against Hindu communities and a surge in the presence of Khalistani activities in Canada, the authorities have identified a 41-year-old suspect in connection to a series of break-and-enters at Hindu temples. Police have identified Jagdish Pandher, a man from Brampton, as the alleged perpetrator behind multiple incidents targeting places of worship. This also includes an incident on October 8, 2023 when the Canadian police responded to reports of a break-and-enter at a Hindu temple in Bayly Street and Krosno Boulevard neighbourhood in Pickering, Ontario. trending now As per Canada's Durham Regional Police, surveillance footage revealed Pandher breaking into the temple and leaving with a substantial amount of cash from donation boxes. Subsequent investigations connected him to additional break-ins at temples in Pickering and Ajax, as well as various locations across Durham Region and the Greater Toronto Area. \"Investigators have linked the same suspect to numerous other break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year. These break-and-enters occurred in Durham Region and around the Greater Toronto Area,\" Durham regional police said in a statement. Despite the targeted locations being places of worship, authorities assert that the offences \"do not appear to be hate crimes or motivated by hate.\" These incidents of increased violence towards Hindu communities have left the people on edge. Jagdish Pandher is now facing a list of charges, including four counts of Break-and-Enter Place Other Than Dwelling, four counts of Possess Property Obtained by Crime Under $5000, one count of Break-and-Enter with Intent, and five counts of Breach of Probation.

    "text": "I passeggeri di un volo diretto a Dubai sono rimasti chiusi per cinque ore all’interno dell’aereo. A seguito di questo ritardo, è scoppiata la protesta dei passeggeri, con urla e pugni contro le cappelliere.\nLa protesta dei passeggeri I passeggeri a bordo di un volo Air India diretto da Mumbai a Dubai si sono ritrovati in una situazione di grande stress, quando hanno dovuto attendere circa 5 ore all’interno dell’ aereo in ritardo . Dal nervosismo è nata una vera e propria protesta dei passeggeri , che hanno iniziato ad inveire vivacemente contro lo staff. Qualcuno ha preso di mira anche le cappelliere dell’aereo, colpendole ripetutamente e lamentandosi della mancata assistenza da parte del personale di volo.\nLo staff ha provato invano ad attenuare l’agitazione dei passeggeri, invitati alla calma tramite i messaggi con il microfono di bordo. “Non ci fidiamo più di voi!”, ha urlato qualcuno. “Il capitano non si è fatto vedere nemmeno una volta in 5 ore”, ha dichiarato uno dei passeggeri. L’autore del video pubblicato su Instagram ha scritto: “Alcuni di noi si sono sentiti male”.\nLa compagnia aerea Air India Secondo quanto riferiscono i media locali, il ritardo sarebbe stato provocato da una serie di “ problemi tecnici “. La compagnia aerea coinvolta in questo spiacevole episodio è Air India . Stando alla classifica stilata dalla società di consulenza del settore aereo Skytrax, questa compagnia si è piazzata solo al 90° posto nella lista delle 100 migliori compagnie aeree del mondo nel 2024.",

[Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 16:55 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 16:32 IST Nigerian Catholic couple Jane and Lucy have little hope their local parish church will bless their same-sex union anytime soon, as conservative priests across Africa choose to ignore a landmark Vatican ruling allowing such blessings. Conservative Catholics have condemned the Vatican's declaration two weeks ago, which was approved by Pope Francis, that will allow blessings for same-sex couples, as long as they are not part of the regular Church rituals or liturgies. The pope has hit back against the criticism and what he called inflexible ideological positions that hinder the Church from moving forward. But in many African countries, such as the continent's most populous one, Nigeria, even having a same-sex relationship is outlawed and often punishable by long jail terms. Little wonder that 39-year-old Jane, who has been living with her partner for six years, does not feel the Vatican's declaration will change much. \"Maybe in the next 20 years (or) next 30 years but right now it will be difficult for them (Bishops) to just accept this,\" Jane told Reuters inside her room in north central Benue state. In the Anglican church, the issue has caused deep divisions for more than two decades, most recently following Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby's proposal earlier this year to allow priests to bless same-sex unions, bringing the faith close to splitting point. The Catholic Church has so far sought to avoid the impression of conflict. Catholic bishops from Angola, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi to Sao Tome and Principe, Uganda and Zimbabwe are among clerics who have said they will not bless same-sex couples, but have argued that the Pope's decree can be interpreted as optional. Father Patrick Alumunku of St Louis Catholic Church Mbora parish in the capital Abuja said the Vatican declaration was unsettling for many followers but should be viewed as a move towards inclusiveness for all God's children. He denied that this was an incremental step to eventually accept same-sex unions in the church. \"There are laws that have been made by God and by the church in 2000 years which cannot change,\" said Alumunku. For activist and poultry farmer Jane, the fact that the issue is being discussed openly is reason enough to consider eventually approaching her priest for a blessing, if her partner agrees. \"I think he (Pope Francis) tried to understand the feelings of people who tend to be born different or people who basically are now becoming like the outcasts of this society,\" she said. \"We are getting there, a moment of self expression and acceptance is coming.\" (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

    "text": "O Ministério Público do Estado de São Paulo acatou pedido da Associação Nacional de Juristas Islâmicos (ANAJI), determinando que Xande de Pilares e Ferrugem , além dos compositores da música Me abraça , adequem a obra no prazo de 30 dias, sob pena de multa de 10 mil reais. A associação ainda pede uma indenização de 30 mil reais por danos morais coletivos, sob alegação de que a obra contém conotação preconceituosa e sugere que todos os seguidores do Islã seriam terroristas. Diz trecho da letra de autoria de Claudemir Júnior , Peu Cavalcante e Rodrigo Leite : “Pra que bombardeio, pra que engatilhar/ Aqui não é Irã, ou Islã, Bagdá/ Foi só um mau tempo que ainda dá tempo/ Desarma essa bomba em nome de Alá”.\nSegundo informação do site Quem , a comunidade islâmica ressalta que “busca apenas a adequação da música e não sua suspensão, em respeito à liberdade artística, visto que essa possui um trecho que viola os direitos da comunidade muçulmana no Brasil, ao associar a religião islâmica ao terrorismo. Como se depreende da transcrição acima, evidente que as palavras utilizadas na quarta estrofe acabam transmitindo aos ouvintes a ideia de que todos os seguidores do Islã são terroristas e assassinos quando compara o desarme de bomba a Alá, dando a falsa concepção de que a religião propaga a violência e atos terroristas”, argumenta outro trecho da ação”. A música foi tirada do ar no YouTube há três meses e ainda aguarda a retirada do Spotify.\nGiro VEJA - quinta, 22 de fevereiro A posse de Dino no STF e o silêncio de Bolsonaro em depoimento",

    "title": "Archbishop Aguer: Pope Francis’ Vatican has ‘adopted the ideology of the French Revolution’",
    "text": "“Pope summons 30 Nobel Prize winners to reflect on fraternity,” reads a La Prensa headline of a story from the outlet EFE. It refers to the recent “ World Meeting on Human Fraternity ,” whose theme was “Be Human.” The objective was “to elaborate a new worldwide Pact of Fraternity and a new code of the human being, in addition to announcing a great event on fraternity during the Holy Year [Jubilee] to be celebrated in 2025.” The guest list included Guatemalan indigenous leader Rigoberta Menchú, NASA director Bill Nelson, New York Mayor Eric Adams, and Mozambican child activist Graça Machel, who is also the widow of Nelson Mandela.\n“Efforts will be made to design concrete proposals to begin to change history, to stimulate the reforms that are lacking, to understand where the principle of fraternity is already present in social life, and to discern the necessary parameters to measure it,” explained the Holy See, which added that on May 11, in the only event to be held in the small state, Bergoglio will receive the participants in a private audience.\nThe Holy See – to the envy of universal Freemasonry – has adopted the ideology of the French Revolution: “ Liberté, egalité, fraternité .” Where has it filed away Jesus’ command to Peter and the Eleven to make all peoples His disciples – i.e., Christians? The successor of Peter is unfortunately the one leading the Church of Rome on this wrong path that the whole Church must follow. There is a way to react according to Tradition: the Apostle Paul reproached Peter for his hypocrisy because he ate with those who came from paganism but began to “Judaize” when James, cousin of the Lord and head of the Church of Jerusalem, arrived. In the letter to the Galatians, Paul says “I resisted him to his face” ( kata prosōpon autō antestēn ) and calls this behavior “ hypókrisis .” (2:11-2:13)\nTradition has given the Roman Pontiff the highest authority, but the cardinals, with all due respect, can make him aware of the danger of Rome adopting the dogma of the Revolution – something the popes have not done since Gregory XVI, who energetically condemned the contagion of liberalism in his encyclical Mirari Vos . We must remember Pius IX, his encyclical Quanta Cura , and the Syllabus of Errors . The magisterium of Pius XII and his successors also stands out. The Church has been reformulating and updating its doctrine without violating its roots in Tradition. John Paul II extensively expressed the path of the Church on the occasion of its entry into the 21st century.\nREAD: Vatican meeting on ‘human fraternity’ seeks ‘answers’ for the future but is silent on faith\nAt the “World Meeting on Human Fraternity,” Pope Francis, receiving the participants in the audience, said: “On a planet up in flames, you gathered with the intention of reaffirming your ‘no’ to war and your ‘yes’ to peace, bearing witness to the humanity that unites us.” The meeting was attended by personalities from the world of science, politics, art, and sport. They reflected on human fraternity and how to “build a peaceful world” in the future.\nIn his speech the Supreme Pontiff quoted Martin Luther King Jr.: “We have learned to fly like birds, to swim like fish, but we have not yet learned the simple art of living together as brothers.” He also insisted that the key word for living together is “compassion.” The intention of the “encounter” was to “generate a movement of fraternity.”\n“It is necessary to recognize each other again in common humanity and put fraternity at the center of the life of peoples,” the Pope said.\nThe great absentee in all this is Jesus Christ. To judge what this absence means, it is enough to recall the work of St. Paul, especially his letters to the Ephesians and to the Colossians. Christ is everything for the Church. I am reminded of two significant expressions of Paul VI: “We had hoped for a flourishing spring, but a harsh winter has come,” and, “It seems that through some crack the smoke of Satan has entered the Church of God” – the Pontiff thus expressing his disenchantment after the Second Vatican Council. READ: Bishop Strickland: Catholics will never attain true unity if it’s not grounded in Christ\nThere is a true fraternity among Christians: Paul frequently uses the term “brothers” ( adelphói ) to refer to the addressees of his letters. It is a mystery of grace founded on the one baptism which we confess in the Creed and which demands charity ( agápē ) in mutual behavior. Evangelization is the process that extends the Church as fraternity. It can be said to be expressed in the Lord’s Prayer, where we call God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, “our Father,” with a plural that excludes individualism. From the Christian point of view, we can analogically consider all men as brothers insofar as they are creatures of God, who is the only Creator of all and the Father of souls.\nThis is an occasion to recall that Peter is the head of the process of evangelization in which the nascent Church was engaged. Saul, who became Paul, joined him. The apostle to the Gentiles reminds us that there is no other Gospel than the one entrusted to the Eleven. What happens is that there are some who distort the Gospel of Christ, contaminating it with “otherness” – if we can call it that. The person of Peter finds continuity in his successors, the popes of Rome. I am reminded of St. Bernard’s words to Pope Eugene III, who had been his disciple: “What did your predecessors have in mind to interrupt evangelization while unbelief is still spreading? For what reason has the Word that runs swiftly stopped? Remember that you owe it not only to Christians, but also to infidels, Jews, Greeks, and pagans.”\nThe dogma of the French Revolution – “liberty, equality, fraternity” – is another gospel that spreads unbelief, the forgetfulness of Jesus Christ, the Word of the Father. The successor of Peter and the whole Church cannot adopt it or make a pact with it in a false peace. The Word that runs swiftly must not stop.\nAs a continuity of Christ’s redemptive work, the Church’s mission is directed to the consecration of the world. This concept covers a double reality: on the one hand, the good world, the work of God’s creation; and on the other, a kind of “second nature,” as Blaise Pascal said: the world of sin, vanity, and lies, the alienation of man, the sphere in which the action of the enemy unfolds. This world must be torn away from evil and led to God by the Word, who is Christ. This is also the mission of the successor of Peter and of the whole community of the faithful. Its price is the Cross of Christ and the readiness of the disciples to martyrdom.\nA question remains open about the destiny of Israel and preaching to the Jews in the midst of a mission that was aimed at procuring the conversion of the pagans from the beginning. But the mysterious paganization of the Christian world must be taken into account. The position of the Church vis-à-vis the French Revolution’s dogma must be placed in this theological context.\n+ Héctor Aguer\nArchbishop Emeritus of La Plata\nBuenos Aires, Friday, May 24, 2024\nFeast of Mary, Help of Christians",

    "text": "El papa Francisco no asistirá a la audiencia jubilar prevista para este sábado, mientras que en la misa con ocasión del Jubileo de los Diáconos del domingo será sustituido por el responsable del dicasterio para la Evangelización, Rino Fisichella, informó este martes el Vaticano.\nLos partes médicos difundidos este lunes explicaron que el cuadro clínico del papa es «complejo», por lo que se alargará su hospitalización en el Policlínico Gemelli de Roma, donde está ingresado por «una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio», que obligó a cambiarle la terapia que recibe.\nA pesar de su hospitalización, Francisco volvió anoche a hablar con la parroquia de la Sagrada Familia, la única iglesia católica de Gaza, explicó a los medios italianos su párroco, el sacerdote argentino Gabriel Romanelli.\nPor el momento, sólo ha trascendido que el pontífice ha pasado tranquilo su cuarta noche en el Gemelli y en la jornada de hoy se espera una actualización del informe sobre sus condiciones de salud y sobre si está funcionando el tratamiento.\n«El Santo Padre continúa sin fiebre y con el tratamiento prescrito. Las condiciones clínicas son estables», se indicó en el último comunicado emitido el lunes por la tarde Santa Sede sobre el estado de salud del pontífice, de 88 años.\nPreviamente, el Vaticano había explicado que las últimas pruebas realizadas mostraban «una infección polimicrobiana del tracto respiratorio que ha obligado a modificar aún más la terapia» de Francisco, cuyo tratamiento ya había sido modificado el sábado, después de los primeros exámenes.\nEl Vaticano añadió que el «cuadro clínico complejo requerirá de una hospitalización adecuada», lo que hace prever que el papa permanecerá varios días en el hospital y que probablemente se pierda algunos de los múltiples actos del Año Santo, como ya ha sucedido con el de este lunes por el Jubileo de los artistas en los estudios de Cinecittà o el Jubileo de los diáconos de este fin de semana.\nEFE",
