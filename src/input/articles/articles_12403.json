    "title": "Don Kusler: Democrats dominated 2023 with victories for reproductive rights, labor",
    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box.\nVirginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office.\nThat's a victory for Democrats.\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate.\nThat's another victory for the left.\nTwo ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state.\nPeople are also reading…\nThen on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin.\nThese electoral victories make a difference.\nJust look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize.\nLabor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts.\nWorkers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers.\nSometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans.\nIt was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes.\nThe Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business.\nLeadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people.\nThe one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job.\nDid the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker.\nThe sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats.\nSo a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories.\nYes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats.\nKusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action:\nadaction.org.

    "text": "Utah News Little Lambs gave out over a million diapers last year. It can't keep up with demand Utah Public Radio | By Clarissa Casper Published February 20, 2025 at 4:13 PM MST Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email\nListen • 2:09\nStefanee Chalfant Volunteers for Little Lambs standing in front of one of the nonprofit's delivery trucks. A northern Utah nonprofit that distributed 1.6 million diapers to families last year is running out of space.\nAs need for the nappies and other necessities swells, Logan’s Little Lambs Foundation for Kids is unable to accept large donations in its cramped 2,000-square-foot facility, potentially leaving some Utahns without essential hygiene supplies.\n“We had to turn down an entire semi,” said foundation Executive Director Ted Chalfant, “and that was about a quarter of a million in donations that we weren’t able to accept.”\nChalfant hopes state funding can help his nonprofit create some room to grow while rising costs continue to fuel demand.\nWhen he started Little Lambs out of his Logan basement in 2014, Chalfant had no idea how much of a need there would be in Cache County for his organization, which, at first, provided hygiene kits to kids transitioning into foster care.\nEven more surprising to him is how much the nonprofit has grown — from getting its own building, to becoming one of the only diaper banks in the state, to providing essentials such as feminine hygiene products, wipes and formula to more than 70,000 low-income families throughout Utah in 2024, Chalfant said.\nThe need, Chalfant said, rises drastically each year. In the organization’s first year, about 750 children were served.\n“Diaper insecurity, it’s not an inconvenience; it’s a public health crisis,” he said. “Families should be able to have enough diapers so that they don’t have to choose, ‘Is it diapers or dinner today?’ Every child deserves dignity, respect and love, and they also need to feel secure.”\nChalfant, who grew up in a family that cared for foster children, started the foundation after seeing child after child arrive with only the clothes on their backs, and sometimes, their belongings in a trash bag or paper sack. What began as a program to provide essentials to help kids settle into new homes grew into a statewide distribution center for Division of Child and Family Services offices throughout the state.\nBecause of this, Chalfant has requested $3.1 million in state funding from the Utah Legislature to help build a 16,000-square-foot community resource center in Logan. The new center would not only support these services in Utah, he said, but also create space for additional programs, including a teen resource center to assist teen mothers with care for their children.\n“Populations throughout the state are struggling,” he said. “It is our number one goal to make everyone be able to have access to basic essentials.”\nFormer Logan Republican Rep. Dan Johnson said he supports granting these funds, adding that he saw the demand for Little Lambs’ services grow significantly during his time in the House of Representatives. Lawmakers, he said, should focus on helping those in need.\n“Sometimes, if you could just give a person a leg up,” Johnson said, “if you could just help them with some very basic needs, it’s such a difference-maker in their lives.”\nNibley resident Marilyn Wilson has been volunteering with Little Lambs for nearly a decade, helping create hygiene kits, delivering feminine products to girls at school and making clothing for families in need.\nWilson, who has seen the number of people turning to Little Lambs grow significantly over the years, said there is not enough space for volunteers — who provide nearly all the services — to work efficiently.\nShe said a new building is crucial for continuing these services. She has seen firsthand people facing illness or other difficult circumstances that lead them to ask for help.\n“We give hope to families,” Wilson said. “That’s the biggest thing. We try to break the cycle of poverty. It takes a village.”",

    "text": "„Würden sonst Deutsch sprechen“: Trump gibt bizarre Erklärung für Militärparade\nEine gigantische Militärparade rollt an Trumps Geburtstag durch Washington DC. Die Feier will sich der Präsident auf keinen Fall vermiesen lassen.\nWashington, D.C. – Während Demonstranten an der Westküste gegen die Abschiebepolitik von Donald Trump protestieren, laufen an der Ostküste längst die Vorbereitungen für die Militärparade. Am Samstag (14. Juni 2025) sollen Panzer und Kriegsgerät begleitet von hunderttausenden Soldaten durch Washington DC rollen, um sowohl den 250. Geburtstag der US-Armee als auch den 79. Geburtstag des amtierenden US-Präsidenten zu feiern.\nDoch die Eskalation in Los Angeles macht Donald Trump mit Blick auf die geplanten Feierlichkeiten am Wochenende offenbar nervös. „Haben Sie eine Botschaft an die Kritiker der Feierlichkeiten?“, fragte ein Journalist den US-Präsidenten bei einem Presse-Meeting im Weißen Haus. „Wenn irgendjemand zum Demonstrieren auftaucht, dann werden wir ihm mit sehr großer Gewalt begegnen“, sagte Trump und wiederholte die Drohung sogar noch einmal. „Jeder, der demonstrieren will, wird mit sehr großer Gewalt empfangen“. Ihm seien aber keine geplanten Proteste gegen seine Militärparade bekannt.\nDonald Trump schwärmt von „Panzern“ bei der Militärparade\nDer Plan der US-Regierung für Samstag sieht eine gigantische Show der eigenen Stärke in Washington, DC vor. „Wir haben Panzer, Flugzeuge, wir haben alles mögliche“, schwärmte Donald Trump bereits im Vorfeld über die geplante Militärparade. Nach aktuellen Informationen sollen an dieser mehr als 200.000 Soldatinnen und Soldaten teilnehmen. Daneben werden Panzer, Flugzeuge und Militärgerät aller Art aus verschiedenen Epochen in Washington zu sehen sein.\nDonald Trumps Militärparade: Infos zur Geburtstagsfeier in der Übersicht\nDatum | 14. Juni 2025 |\nBeginn | 18.30 Uhr Ortszeit (0.30 Uhr in Deutschland) |\nThema | Die Kriege der USA |\nUmfang | mehr als 100 Militärfahrzeuge und bis zu 200.000 Soldaten |\nDie US-Armee will mit der Militärparade in Washington DC an alle Konflikte erinnern, die das Land seit seiner Gründung erlebte: vom Revolutionskrieg über die Weltkriege bis zum Vietnam-Krieg. Jeder Krieg wird von 60 Soldaten in historischen Kostümen repräsentiert, gefolgt von 400 Soldaten der gleichen Einheit in ihren modernen Kampfanzügen. Außerdem werden hunderte Militärfahrzeuge in Washington DC erwartet. Die Parade dürfte damit anhand der Bilder, die durch die Welt gehen werden, stark an Russlands jährliche Militärparaden erinnern.\nPanzer und Hubschrauber bei der Militärparade in Washington DC\n- M1A2/Abrams-Panzer\n- Bradley-Kampffahrzeuge\n- Black Hawk-Hubschrauber\n- Apache-Hubschrauber\n- Chinook-Hubschrauber\nDer Prunk zum Doppelgeburtstag kostet die US-Politik offenbar eine Stange Geld. Bis zu 45 Millionen US-Dollar sollen laut US-Medien die geplanten Ausgaben für die Militärparade und die Sicherheitsvorkehrungen in Washington DC betragen. Donald Trump aber hat dafür eine Begründung parat. „Zur Abwechslung werden wir unser Land mal feiern“, sagte Trump. Die USA seien das einzige Land, das seinen Sieg im Zweiten Weltkrieg nicht feiern würde. „Ich habe andere Länder angerufen. Alle feiern es. Dabei sind wir diejenigen, die den Krieg gewonnen haben. Ohne uns würden Sie alle sonst heute Deutsch sprechen. Vielleicht würden Sie auch Japanisch sprechen.“\nDonald Trump bekommt die lang ersehnte Militärparade zum Geburtstag\nDie Militärparade in Washington DC an Donald Trumps Geburtstag ist der Höhepunkt der Feier zu Ehren des US-Militärs, die bereits seit Montag (7. Juni) laufen. Der amtierende US-Präsident hatte bereits nach seinem Sieg bei der US-Wahl 2016 eine Militärparade in der Hauptstadt verlangt. Die Behörden des „District of Colombia“ hatten das aber verhindert, weil Kosten und logistischer Aufwand als zu hoch eingeschätzt wurden. Nun aber bekommt Donald Trump seine Militärparade. Das verdankt der US-Präsident wohl der Tatsache, dass seine zweite Amtszeit den 250. Geburtstag der US-Armee umschließt.\nDoch die anhaltenden Proteste gegen Trumps Abschiebepolitik in Los Angeles dürften dessen Vorfreude auf die Militärparade trüben. Laut einem Bericht der New York Times mache man sich auch innerhalb der Republikaner große Sorgen, die Bilder von Panzern und Soldaten in der US-Hauptstadt könnten im Angesicht der Unruhen in Kalifornien ein falsches Bild erzeugen. Es könne der Eindruck entstehen, die US-Armee würde den Sieg über die eigene Bevölkerung feiern. „Das unglückliche Zusammentreffen der Parade und des Einsatzes der Nationalgarde in Kalifornien wird sich verhängnisvoll anfühlen“, sagte Kori Schake, ehemaliger Verteidigungsbeamter in der Regierung von George W. Bush, gegenüber der US-Zeitung.\nMilitärparade in Washington DC: Trump hält Rede zu Ehren der US-Armee\nDas wiederum dürfte Donald Trump aber nicht abschrecken. Der amtierende US-Präsident ist ein Meister der Selbstinszenierung und wird die Militärparade am 14. Juni vor allem dafür nutzen, um sich und seinen Geburtstag zu feiern. Auch eine Rede Trumps ist geplant. Laut der Website der Veranstaltung will das Staatsoberhaupt „250 Jahre außergewöhnliche Dienste, bedeutende Errungenschaften und ein bleibendes Vermächtnis der US-Armee“ ehren.\nOffiziell sind die Feierlichkeiten und der Soldatenaufmarsch in Washington DC aber nicht für Donald Trumps Geburtstag gedacht. Geehrt wird am „nationalen Flaggentag“ dagegen nur das Militär. Vor 250 Jahren, am 14. Juni 1775, hob der Kontinentalkongress im laufenden Unabhängigkeitskrieg zehn Kompanien aus. Der spätere US-Präsident George Washington wurde zum Oberbefehlshaber der so gebildeten Kontinentalarmee ernannt.\nDamit ist die US-Armee sogar älter als die USA selbst. Die wurde nämlich erst am 4. Juli 1776 mit Unterzeichnung der Unabhängigkeitserklärung ins Leben gerufen. Noch jünger ist Donald Trump. Der feiert am 14. Juni 2025 erst seinen 79. Geburtstag und ist damit nach Joe Biden der zweitälteste amtierende Präsident in der 250 Jahre dauernden Geschichte der USA. Sollte er seine Amtszeit beenden, würde Trump seinen Vorgänger noch überholen, und mit dann 82 Jahren und sieben Monaten zum ältesten US-Staatsoberhaupt der Geschichte werden. (dil)",

    "title": "El nou O3 d'OpenAI pot ser més efectiu que un humà: quina por genera?",
    "text": "A mesura que la tecnologia d'IA generativa es fa més freqüent, el seu paper en la remodelació de les indústries és inevitable. Tot i que alguns temen una disminució dels salaris i les oportunitats laborals, d'altres veuen un món on les tasques mundanes s'automatitzen, cosa que permet als humans centrar-se en activitats més significatives i creatives. De moment, el repte rau a navegar per aquest canvi. La integració d'IA com O3 podria revolucionar les professions de coll blanc, creant rols que es basen molt en la pluja d'idees, l'automatització i la innovació. Tant si aquesta transformació genera esperança com por, una cosa és certa: el lloc de treball del futur tindrà un aspecte molt diferent de l'actual.\nEl 20 de desembre del passat any 2024 es va presentar i, amb els dies posteriors, ja comença a generar certes conclusions. El model o3 d'[OpenAI](https://www.elnacional.cat/oneconomia/ca/on-ia/openai-passara-ser-parcialment-empresa-anim-lucre_1337641_102.html) representa un important salt endavant, redefinint les possibilitats de la intel·ligència artificial (IA), diu Andreas Hassellöf, CEO d'Ombori. \"En el punt de referència Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI), sovint descrit com una prova de coeficient intel·lectual per a IA, o3 ha aconseguit una puntuació de rendiment superior al 87%, superant significativament el seu predecessor, o1 i establint un nou estàndard per a tasques d'intel·ligència general. Aquest resultat reflecteix la seva capacitat per pensar i resoldre problemes que no s'havia trobat abans. En fer-ho, això assenyala una nova era d'adaptabilitat i raonament.\nQuan es tracta de raonament matemàtic, o3 brilla amb el seu rendiment excepcional en els reptes de Frontier Math. Aquests es troben entre els problemes més difícils per a la IA, i o3 ha demostrat una taxa de resolució del 25,2%, eclipsant el punt de referència anterior on cap model superava el 2%. Aquesta capacitat no és només una millora incremental sinó un avenç transformador, amb implicacions per a camps com l'educació, la investigació avançada i les indústries que requereixen una solució complexa de problemes\", afegeix.\nDe programadors a creadors\nEl paper dels desenvolupadors està lluny de desaparèixer, però s'està transformant. En el futur, els desenvolupadors hauran de combinar l'experiència tècnica amb la creativitat i el pensament estratègic. La creació de programari excepcional ja no es tracta només de resoldre problemes de codificació complexos, sinó d'entendre les necessitats dels usuaris, dissenyar interfícies intuïtives i garantir experiències fluides entre plataformes. Amb eines com l'O3 d'OpenAI, fins i tot persones amb poca o cap experiència de codificació poden crear aplicacions sofisticades simplement comunicant les seves idees a un sistema d'IA.\nA mesura que les eines basades en intel·ligència artificial s'encarreguen de l'escriptura i depuració de codi, el valor de les habilitats de codificació tradicionals canviarà. Els desenvolupadors hauran de ser capaços d'entendre com funciona la IA, saber guiar-la en la direcció correcta i perfeccionar la sortida per assolir objectius empresarials específics. Aquest canvi posa èmfasi en la combinació d'habilitats tècniques, creatives i empresarials que són crucials per a la creació de programari modern actual.\nEl paper del disseny, l'UX i l'estratègia empresarial\nEl model o3 d'OpenAI representa la convergència de la IA i el procés creatiu. Els desenvolupadors ja no estan aïllats en el món de la creació de programari, ple de codis. En canvi, el futur és col·laboratiu i multidisciplinari. El disseny, l'experiència d'usuari (UX) i l'estratègia empresarial són tan importants, si no més, que les línies de codi que constitueixen la columna vertebral del programari.\nEl model o3 il·lustra com la IA pot automatitzar tasques tècniques, deixant més espai a la creativitat humana. El focus se centrarà a crear experiències d'usuari excepcionals, garantir que el programari s'alinea amb els objectius empresarials i utilitzar l'experiència en màrqueting per arribar als clients i captar-los. El programari es convertirà en més que un producte tècnic: serà una creació completa impulsada per la passió, la visió i una profunda comprensió de les necessitats del mercat.",
