    "text": "For many years, Australia's Pilbara region has been a symbol of rapid growth and prosperity in the mining industry. Located in Western Australia, it has served as the country's main economic engine for decades, drawing on its rich iron ore reserves. Huge piles of crushed brown rock, up to 200,000 tons each, ready to be shipped to Asian steel mills were a common sight at the port of Parker Point. However, today, according to an expert in the field of metallurgy, Stanislav Kondrashov, the region is facing new challenges: the fading of the Chinese infrastructure boom and the need to transition to more environmentally friendly technologies.\nStanislav Kondrashov: fading Chinese demand for iron ore and its impact on the Pilbara economy\nChina, which consumes about 85% of Australia's iron ore, has a huge impact on the economy of the Pilbara, a region that has long been the main source of this raw material. However, recent trends in the Chinese economy and real estate sector are beginning to put pressure on this traditional export route.\nAccording to Stanislav Kondrashov from Telf AG, demand for steel in China has been stable and high for a long time, but now it is approaching its peak. China's steel production is expected to peak before the end of the current decade. This is largely due to a slowdown in the real estate sector, which is one of the largest consumers of steel in the country.\nThe crisis in China's real estate sector, which traditionally used much of its steel production, has led to a decrease in demand for steel. This in turn impacts Australian iron ore import requirements, inevitably leading to lower export earnings for the Pilbara.\nWith demand for iron ore falling in China, the Pilbara economy faces a number of challenges. Since the region is heavily dependent on iron ore exports, Stanislav Kondrashov from Telf AG is confident that it is necessary to look for alternative markets or develop other sectors of the economy to compensate for possible losses:\nTo overcome these challenges, the region will need to diversify its economic activities. This could include developing other sectors such as tourism or renewable energy, as well as finding new markets for iron ore exports outside China .\nStanislav Kondrashov: environmental challenges and innovations\nModern steel production, which has not changed since the 14th century, is a high-carbon process. In search of a solution to this problem, alternative technologies are being developed, such as electric arc furnaces and direct reduction of iron using natural gas. According to Stanislav Kondrashov, in the long term it is planned to use “green” hydrogen, which will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the steel production process.\nTypical Australian iron ore has an iron content of between 56% and 62%, making it less suitable for new technologies without further processing. This could increase costs by 25%, according to analysts at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. Such changes will inevitably impact the competitiveness of the Australian iron ore industry in the global market.\nIn the face of these challenges, the Australian iron ore industry must adapt, not only technologically but also strategically. This requires innovation, rethinking production processes and possibly diversifying markets. The road ahead is difficult, but it is precisely periods like these that often become an effective catalyst for major industrial and economic transformations, - Kondrashov says. Reimagining the future of Australia's iron ore industry is not just a necessity, but an opportunity for innovation and sustainable development. The Pilbara and the entire Australian iron ore industry now stand on the threshold of a new era that will determine their place in the global economy of the future.\n Telf AG\nContact Person: Media Relations\nEmail: Send Email\nCountry: Switzerland\nWebsite: https://telf.ch/",

The restaurant owners said they've sold their downtown property to a restaurant group.\n\"This is a bittersweet message we are sending today,\" the owners wrote in a social media post. \"We have so enjoyed the past two years of creating an inviting ambiance and menu experience for you to enjoy.\n\"We have made the decision to sell our unique property in Downtown Melbourne to a well-known restaurant group that plans to bring a new dining experience to our area.\"\nNo further details about the restaurant group or what's being planned for the 529 E. New Haven Ave. location were immediately available. The Alligator Reef Club served lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch, craft cocktails and more — they frequently had live music in the backdrop.\nThe restaurant will remain open until February 5, and all patrons are invited to a special celebration from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on February 1, including live music with food and drink specials.\nWe asked readers on FLORIDA TODAY's Facebook page, 321 Flavor: Where Brevard Eats, to weigh in on the news.\nDenise Mackey Cherne wrote, \"I loved it there. They had unique cocktails, good food and a great ambience. I am sad to hear this news.\"\n\"Alligator Reef has one of the coolest locations, in my opinion. Very relaxed atmosphere, great drinks and food too!\" wrote Michelle Hill Allender.\nDana Ott wrote, \"Alligator Reef is a beautiful venue, in and outside. The dining options were a perfect compliment to the tropical surroundings. It was a great place to transport us to the 'Keys.' Alligator Reef will be missed.\"\nAmber Olesen is FLORIDA TODAY's food and dining reporter. Reach her at aolesen@floridatoday.com.",

    "text": "Local government has never been under more financial stress, according to Corangamite Shire chief executive officer David Rae.In the council's submission to the state government's Inquiry into Local Government funding and services, Mr Rae said the ability to fund and maintain services and infrastructure was becoming increasingly difficult.Mr Rae said there were a number of services the state government had provided initial funding for but the burden had then fallen to the council.Mr Rae said regional and rural councils were hit harder by cost shifting than metropolitan councils due to limited revenue opportunities, larger geographical areas, dispersed population and settlement patterns.Mr Rae said local councils were severely impacted by government legislation and policy changes.Mr Rae said local councils needed to be consulted prior to structure or system changes.Mr Rae said the council was also being forced to look into becoming a childcare provider due to the lack of available spots for families.Mr Rae said another challenge for rural and regional councils was offering similar salaries to those in other areas of the state.Mr Rae said the state government should also consider reviewing the rate cap policy.Warrnambool City Council's mayor Ben Blain and chief executive officer Andrew Mason spoke about similar cost shifting issues in the city's submission.The submission said cost shifting had occurred with school crossing supervisors, maternal and child health services and maintenance of Crown land.Despite a better injury rate, Warrnambool City Council's WorkCover premium has increased from $600,000 to more than $1 million, the submission states.It also draws attention to the increased landfill levy and the windfall gains tax.Attracting skilled employees is also an issue for the Warrnambool City Council, the submission states.Moyne Shire Council's submission was prepared by Peter Brown, the council's former acting chief executive officer.He said there were a number of factors that were contributing to this, including cost shifting from other levels of government to local government and rate capping.Mr Brown said rate capping was not equitable.He said rate capping had recently been set at lower levels than inflation and the increases to wages and other costs.He said rural councils were also forced to spend large amount of money on roads.",

    "text": "The New York Landmarks Conservancy has announced 14 Sacred Sites Grants totaling $228,000 awarded to 14 historic religious properties throughout New York State .\nIncluding $7,500 to Ebenezer Gospel Tabernacle Christian Mission of the USA in Harlem to help fund chimney repair.\nArchitect Charles Atwood designed the 1891 Ebenezer Gospel Tabernacle with a mix of Romanesque-revival and Gothic-revival vocabulary. At the time of its construction, the church was known as the Third Unitarian Church in New York City . Since completion, the church has changed ownership twice, reflecting changing neighborhood demographics. First, in 1919, an orthodox Jewish congregation, Congregation Chebra Ukadisha B’nai Israel, Holy Sons of Israel, from Kalwarie, Lithuania bought the building. Then, in 1942, the present, Pentecostal, Caribbean and African-American church congregation assumed ownership. Established in Harlem in 1911, the current building is Ebenezer’s second home.\nThe congregation reaches about 400 people with activities such as clothing distribution and feeding programs. Compassionate Ministries is an effort to provide food, clothing and group counseling to recently arrived migrants.\n“We are delighted that our grants will help these diverse congregations maintain their buildings and continue to serve their communities with social service and cultural programs,” said Peg Breen, President, The New York Landmarks Conservancy . ”These 14 congregations reach a total of 60,000 people beyond their congregations with no-cost or low-cost services. “\nThe Sacred Sites Program provides congregations with matching grants for planning and implementing exterior restoration projects, along with technical assistance, and workshops. Since 1986, the program has pledged nearly 1,700 grants totaling over $13.8 million to more than 850 religious institutions statewide.\nThe New York Landmarks Conservancy , a private non-profit organization, has led the effort to preserve and protect New York City’s architectural legacy for more than 50 years.\n“… revitalizing communities, providing economic stimulus, and supporting local jobs.”\nSince its founding, the Conservancy has loaned and granted more than $62 million, which has leveraged almost $1 billion in nearly 2,000 restoration projects throughout New York, revitalizing communities, providing economic stimulus, and supporting local jobs. The New York Landmarks Conservancy has also offered countless hours of pro bono technical advice to building owners, both nonprofit organizations and individuals.\nThe Conservancy’s work has saved more than a thousand buildings across the City and State, protecting New York’s distinctive architectural heritage for residents and visitors alike today, and for future generations.\nFor more information, please visit www.nylandmarks.org .\nPhoto Credit: 1-2) Courtesy of The New York Landmarks Conservancy",

Ciudad de México.- Una familia fue engañada con la supuesta compra de su auto, todo se trataba de un asalto que fue orquestado por el Marketplace de redes sociales. El Gráfico reportó el hecho violento en calles de la colonia Valentín Gómez Farías, en la alcaldía Venustiano Carranza. Se sabe que los presuntos delincuentes citaron a sus víctimas en la direccióin mencionada y el llegar y fingir interés en la compra de un vehículo compacto de la marca Fiat, los amagaron con un arma de fuego para que les entregaran las llaves. Los dueños del coche se negaron y los agresores les dispararon en repetidas ocasiones para después huir del lugar en un auto. La balacera alertó a vecinos de la zona y que también fueron testigos del ataque, ellos fueron los que solicitaron la ayuda de las autoridades policiacas. Al lugar acudieron paramédicos y policías capitalinos, pero solo atendieron a una mujer que sufrió una crisis de nerviosa al escuchar los disparos en su contra; no se reportaron lesionados pese a que fueron varios balazos. Mediante las cámaras de vigilancia, los policías siguieron la ruta de los ladrones, pero hasta esta mañana no se reportaron personas detenidas, la Fiscalía capitalina ya indaga el caso.

Viernes, 19 de abril 2024, 00:03 Necesitas ser suscriptor para acceder a esta funcionalidad. Compartir Sevillano de nacimiento, vallisoletano de sentimiento y barcelonés de adopción, José Hinojosa Mena-Bernal (1967) es jefe del Servicio de Neurocirugía del hospital San Joan de Déu, ubicado en Esplugues del Llobregat (Barcelona) y especializado en pediatría, donde ha protagonizado toda una hazaña médica. Él ha sido el encargado de dirigir a un equipo multidisciplinar de 22 profesionales en una operación sin precedentes que salvó la vida de Sara, una pequeña de 4 años que [tenía una aguja de un centímetro incrustada en el cerebro](/sociedad/salud/extraen-aguja-cerebro-nina-anos-tras-intervencion-20240415113912-ntrc.html) tras una cita en el dentista para tratar una caries. Hinojosa llegó a Valladolid con tan sólo un año de de edad. Desde su más tierna infancia, tuvo claro que quería dedicarse a la medicina. Su afán era «ayudar a los demás». Estudió en el colegio San José de Valladolid, años de los que guarda muy gratos recuerdos, especialmente de sus compañeros de promoción. En 1991 se licenció en Medicina y Cirugía en la Universidad de Valladolid. Tenía gran vocación quirúrgica y siempre le fascinó el estudio del cerebro, por ello, la neurocirugía pediátrica le cautivó como disciplina desde el comienzo de su carrera. La entiende como un servicio a los niños, sus pacientes, y también a sus familias. Noticia relacionada Completó la especialidad de Neurocirugía en el Hospital Ramón y Cajal de Madrid y obtuvo el doctorado en Medicina en la Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Ha desarrollado su actividad profesional fundamentalmente en el campo de la neurocirugía infantil, inicialmente en el Hospital 12 de Octubre donde estuvo más de 20 años, y más tarde en el Hospital del Niño Jesús, también en Madrid, antes de incorporarse en el 2018 al Hospital Sant Joan de Déu de Esplugues del Llobregat. Es especialista en neurooncología, cirugía craneofacial, médula anclada, hidrocefalia, neuroendoscopia y cirugía mínimamente invasiva. Este doctor vallisoletano, que ha dedicado más de 30 años de su vida a la neurocirugía, reconoce sentirse «muy sorprendido» por la enorme repercusión que ha tenido el caso de la pequeña Sara. Los hechos tuvieron lugar en mayo de 2023, sin embargo ha sido en estos días cuando ha saltado a los medios de comunicación a nivel internacional. «Es un caso muy especial por lo infrecuente de la situación, pero en realidad, en quirófano cada día llevamos a cabo cirugías similares a ésta e incluso más complejas», asegura. Todo comenzó con una visita rutinaria al dentista. Sara acudió acompañada de sus padres Josep María y Monstse para poner solución a una caries. Su carácter inquieto y quizás el miedo a la aguja de la anestesia, le hicieron que se moviera demasiado y la aguja acabó partiéndose. La mala fortuna quiso que quedara alojada dentro de la cavidad bucal y el dentista, tras varios intentos, no pudo extraerla. Éste se puso en contacto con el doctor Josep Rubio, jefe de cirugía maxilofacial del Hospital Sant Joan de Déu. La niña fue desplazada en ambulancia al hospital, donde quedó ingresada. «Eso ocurrió un miércoles por la tarde y la cirugía para extraerla se programó para el viernes por la mañana. Ya con la niña dormida, al hacerle un tac en quirófano con el fin de verificar la posición de la aguja, el doctor Rubio detectó que ésta había migrado hacia el cerebro a través del agujero oval, posiblemente a causa de los movimientos de la masticación», relata el doctor Hinojosa que ese día tenía programada en el quirófano contíguo una cirugía menor. «Afortunadamente teníamos disponible ese quirófoano de alta tecnología que podía garantizar la seguridad durante la intervención. Así que, enseguida, nos reunimos los diferentes especialistas para planear el abordaje de la cirugía», prosigue. Hasta 22 profesionales de distintas especialidades, como neurocirujanos, neurofisiólogos, cirujanos maxilofaciales, anestesistas, radiólogos, técnicos de rayos, celadores, auxiliares y enfermeros se congregaron en un quirófano en el que se ayudaron de neuronavegación. «Fue una cirugía inesperada que requería conocimientos muy específicos y un plan muy complejo», subraya. La mayor dificultad que planteaba este caso, estribaba en que se presentó de forma imprevista y que el equipo médico apenas tuvo tiempo de planificar. «Hubo que improvisar sobre la marcha y había que organizar todo para disponer de toda la información para realizar la extracción sin complicaciones. Si que es cierto que había un punto de emergencia, porque queríamos evitar por todos los medios posibles, que la aguja siguiera migrando y que pudera complicarlo aún más. Una vez que todo estaba en marcha fue mucho más sencillo. Es algo excepcional que esto ocurra pero en el campo que nos movemos estábamos en un entorno habitual. La cirugía en sí misma no fue de las más complicadas», señala con la humildad que caracteriza a los grandes. Al terminar la operación, todos los profesionales que participaron rompieron a aplaudir, fue un momento «muy emocionante» y que sirvió para romper la tensión acumulada. Hinojosa descaca la dedicación y experiencia del equipo como la clave del resultado tan positivo. «Gracias a la implicación de un buen número de especialistas, salió todo a la perfección», señala. Este doctor incide que se trata de un caso «completamente excepcional» y que no debe retraer a nadie de ir al dentista. «La cirugía pediátrica siempre tiene un plus de complejidad por la anestesia, por las reservas de sangre y porque se trata de un cerebro en formación. También el postoperatorio es más complicado en los niños, sin embargo, Sara ha tenido una recuperación fantástica», apunta Hinojosa, quien señala también que al tercer día de la operación, la pequeña ya estaba haciendo el pino. «Su madre me preguntó que si podía hacerlo. Yo le dije que si no le dolía… no había problema», apunta. En la actualidad Sara lleva una vida totalmente normal y no tiene ninguna secuela. «Está totalmente curada y para ella todo esto quedará en una mera anécdota, de la que sólo le quedará la cicatriz quirúrgica que está escondida bajo el pelo», subraya Hinojosa. Este profesional vallisoletano tiene pensado regresar a su tierra en próximas fechas, para participar como ponente en la XLVI Reunión anual de la Sociedad Española de Neurología Pediátrica (SENEP) que se celebrará en Valladolid, entre el 23 y el 25 de mayo, días que aprovechará también para visitar también a los suyos. «Siempre que puedo me acerco a disfrutar de mi ciudad. Me gustaría poder ir más a menudo porque la echo mucho de menos», asegura.

Yahoo Life Shopping 'Makes my poinsettia happy!' This $8 grow light will help your houseplants survive the dark winter Patrick Hearn · Deals Writer, Tech Updated December 29, 2023 at 1:01 AM 2 Link Copied Read full article\nIn theory, plants are easy to grow. They just need heat, light, and water — but two of those three things can be hard to come by in winter, when the short days tell plants it's time to go dormant (sort of like playing dead) and wait for spring. And who wants to look at a bunch of dormant plants all winter? A grow light can help. Specifically, a GYTF Halo Plant Grow Light . It's easy to set up, has a built-in timer, and will help breathe new life into your cold-weary greens until spring rolls back around. Oh, and it's only $8 right now at Amazon.\nGYTF GYTF Halo Plant Grow Light $8 $10 Save $2 with coupon This grow light comes with four different timing options, a sturdy pole that can be extended up to 18 inches and a lot of other features that make it a great buy — especially at this price.\nSave $2 with coupon $8 at Amazon Why is this a good deal? At just $10, this is a steal at full price — but the 15% on-page coupon makes it a no-brainer. One of these will help keep multiple plants happy and healthy.\nWhy do I need this? If you don't get a lot of natural light in your home, it can be tough to keep houseplants alive. This light produces a 6000K light (a neutral, warm temperature similar to sunlight) that plants relate to. It also has red and blue LEDs that help simulate the full spectrum of light, too. It's designed to be placed in the center of a ring of pots so you can provide light for multiple plants at once.\nThe timer can be set to four, eight, 12, or 18 hours, and it has an automatic on/off feature that means no manual intervention is required on your part. As your plants grow, you can increase the height of the light. It ranges from seven to 18 inches and can be rotated 180 degrees to give the best possible angle of light for the plants.\nIt only takes about ten seconds to set up, too!

The light is bright without glare. The lights are supported by just sticking them into the plant pot. I am very pleased with this purchase.\"\n\"I like that the light is very bright for such a small and affordable light. It is enough light to help plants in an 8 foot radius grow. Timer works perfectly; I’m impressed!\" raved another fan.\n\"Used this light for a bonsai that had a very bad summer and I am trying to bring it back over the winter,\" related this amateur botanist . \"The one downside I have had with this light is that it only comes with a soil stake to hold it up so if you are using a loose soil like bonsai soil is it is very difficult to get the light to stay. I ended up 3D printing a small stand that works great but another option in the box would have been great.\"\n\"I was gifted a white poinsettia, and discovered that this light set to 14 hours makes my poinsettia HAPPY. The plant brightens up a dark room in my office, and running the light at night allows me to display it during the day,\" said one reviewer who understands that plants are basically little, green people.\nGYTF GYTF Halo Plant Grow Light $8 $10 Save $2 with coupon This grow light comes with four different timing options, a sturdy pole that can be extended up to 18 inches, and a lot of other features that make it a great buy — especially at this price.\nSave $2 with coupon $8 at Amazon The reviews quoted above reflect the most recent versions at the time of publication.\nIf you have Amazon Prime , you’ll get free shipping, of course.
