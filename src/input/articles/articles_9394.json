online Share via Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Messenger Linkedin Email Post link https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/news/uk/6312295/molly-russells-father-made-mbe-for-services-to-child-safety-online/ Copy Link Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, has been made an MBE in the New Year Honours list (Joshua Bratt/PA)\nMolly Russell’s father said the 14-year-old would have been “very proud” of her legacy of suicide prevention as he was made an MBE in the New Year Honours list.\nIan Russell, 60, has been recognised for services to child safety online after he set up the Molly Rose Foundation suicide prevention charity in her memory and contributed to the establishment of the Online Safety Bill.\nLast September, a coroner ruled schoolgirl Molly, from Harrow, north-west London, died from “an act of self-harm while suffering from depression and the negative effects of online content” in November 2017.\nMr Russell told the PA news agency: “I’m here for the work that not just me but lots of people have done in setting up the Molly Rose Foundation, the charity that we formed after my youngest daughter ended her life in November of 2017, in the hope of preventing such tragedies in the future.”\nMolly Russell took her own life in November 2017 after she had been viewing material on social media linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide On what Molly would have made of his MBE, he said: “Molly was quite content to get on stage and take part in school plays but she was a quiet person, she didn’t like the limelight, so I think she would have found this a bit strange.\n“But because she was such a caring person, I think she would have been tremendously proud of being able to help people who may be struggling with their mental health and may be beginning to have thoughts about suicide.\n“If she thought she could help those people live long and stay strong, she’d be very proud indeed.”\nPlease don’t face your problems alone.Talk to someone you can trust.For support:\nText MRF to 85258Call Papyrus on 0800 068 41 41Call Childline on 0800 1111Call Samaritans on 116 123\nIn an emergency don’t be afraid to dial 999 pic.twitter.com/wH6jGyOedG\n— Molly Rose Foundation (@mollyroseorg) December 23, 2023\nHe said his daughter was “very special” and “emotionally intelligent”, adding: “She had a cheeky sense of humour and above all she was one of the most caring people I’ve ever known even though she died at the age of 14.”\nLast month, the Molly Rose Foundation released a report in the week that would have marked her 21st birthday, which said social media platforms suffer from significant, fundamental system failings in handling self-harm and suicide content.\nIt said it found harmful content at scale and prevalent on Instagram, TikTok and Pinterest – in response to which the firms outlined what they are doing to keep youngsters safe online.\nMr Russell said the foundation has also been sending out help cards with contact details for support services to schools and other organisations involved with children.\nIt also provides suicide prevention training in schools and is “trying to set up a network of support centres across the high streets of the UK”.\nHe added: “Without those conversations, there’s a much greater danger that people will end up ending their own lives, so we’re trying to find ways to start difficult conversations and we’re trying to continue working with the regulators in terms of the Online Safety Act which has past through Parliament and is now law.\n“There’s a period of transition where Ofcom as regulator is working out how it’s actually going to implement the powers it has, that have been given by the Act, and we’re trying to work with them, as are many people, to make sure that the Act does as promised makes the UK the safest place in the world to be online.\n“It’s really important that we don’t shy away from talking about online safety, we don’t shy away from talking about suicide and we don’t shy away from talking about mental health, having conversations is the most important thing and we can all do that on an individual level.\n“It’s also really important that governments regulate to make sure that the tech platforms show more corporate/social responsibility than perhaps they have in the past because the tech platforms, at the end of the day, are the places where improved safety features have to be implemented to keep people safe online, for example, they shouldn’t be algorithmically recommending harmful content, particularly to young people, that has to change.\n“And it’s important for governments around the world to join the list of nations that have introduced regulation to make the online world safer.”\nIan Russell, the father of Molly Russell, said that he was in a ‘state of disbelief’ when he learned he would be receiving an honour (Joshua Bratt/PA) When he discovered he was receiving an honour, Mr Russell said he experienced “almost a state of disbelief, quickly followed by a smile that spread across my face”.\nHe added: “Although honours are individual things, this was for a team of people, this was for hundreds of people in fact that have been involved in making the online world safer and helping to prevent young suicide, and that by accepting it and continuing to raise awareness, it would be a good thing to do and hopefully in the future, there would be far fewer cases like Molly’s.”\nAlice Hendy, founder of R;pple suicide prevention charity, has also been appointed MBE for services to online safety.\nMs Hendy, from Fareham, Hampshire, lost her sibling, Josh, 21, to suicide in November 2020 after he had been searching for techniques to take his own life through harmful internet searches.\nShe subsequently launched R;pple – an online interceptive tool designed to ensure that more help and support is provided to people who are conducting searches relating to self-harm or suicide.\nMr Russell said it’s “fantastic news that all that Alice has achieved has been recognised”.\n“Alice Hendy is one of the most extraordinary people that I’ve met in this space,” he said.\n“Her bravery and her courage after losing her brother Josh is extraordinary and what she’s achieved with the R;pple suicide prevention tool she’s developed is extraordinary, I just can’t quite understand why it hasn’t been adopted more quickly and more widely by platforms and by people.”\nMs Hendy told the PA news agency: “Receiving this MBE is a huge honour.\n“When I first started R;pple, the intention was never to achieve any recognition or gain back slaps in any way, it was a way for me to remember my brother, to continue his legacy and ultimately to stop other people from feeling so low that they believe that taking their own life is their best option.\n“The creation of R;pple has helped a lot of people and it’s all in the name of my brother.\n“So, very humbled, very overwhelmed really to receive the letter through my letterbox in between all of my bills and my mortgage and so on. And, yeah, looking forward to raising a glass to Josh as a result.”\nFor mental health support, call the Samaritans on 116 123, email them at jo@samaritans.org or visit samaritans.org to find your nearest branch.",

    "title": "Republican legislators in North Carolina demand investigation of judge for mentioning reproductive rights",
    "text": "Three Republican state senators in North Carolina have demanded an investigation of state Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs. The state senators, Buck Newton (R), Amy Galey (R), and Danny Britt (R), claim that Riggs has \"blatantly violated\" the North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct. They called for an investigation into Riggs' conduct by the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission.\nWhat was Riggs' transgression? She mentioned reproductive rights in a campaign ad.\nRiggs was appointed to fill a vacancy in the North Carolina Supreme Court in September 2023. It is an elected position, and now Riggs is running for a full eight-year term. She is in a closely contested race against Republican Jefferson Griffin, a current member of the North Carolina Court of Appeals.\nIn a television ad, Riggs says that \"women should be in charge of our own reproductive health care.\" She notes that the Republican nominee for Governor, Mark Robinson, has supported a total abortion ban and that Griffin, if elected to the North Carolina Supreme Court, \"could decide if [Robinson's] ban becomes law.\"\nIn a letter to colleagues announcing their request for an investigation, the Republican Senators claim that the North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct \"prohibits any judicial candidate, regardless of the office they seek, from taking a position on any issue that may appear before the court.\" The letter was posted online this week by Billy Corriher, State Courts Manager at People’s Parity Project Action.\nBut the Republican Senators have mischaracterized the North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct. It does not say that judicial candidates cannot comment on any issue that may appear before the court. The North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct states that judges \"should abstain from public comment about the merits of a pending proceeding in any state or federal court dealing with a case or controversy arising in North Carolina.\" Riggs’ ad does not comment on any pending court proceeding.\nTo the contrary, the North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct says that a judge seeking election may engage in \"constitutionally protected political activity.\" Stating that you believe that women should be in control of their reproductive health care is unquestionably constitutionally protected political speech.\nThe letter from the Republican Senators mirrors criticism of the ad from Griffin during an October 11 debate against Riggs. \"We don’t need to be out there telling people how we’re going to vote on cases,\" Griffin said . \"We don’t need to be out there telling folks how another judge is going to vote on cases.\"\nBut Griffin himself has made his views on abortion very clear . Last year, the North Carolina Court of Appeals heard a case that \"dealt with the termination of a mother’s parental rights because she had committed a crime while she was pregnant.\" Griffin signed onto an opinion that found the woman's \"parental rights could be terminated — even though the child hadn’t yet been born at the time of the mother’s crimes — because 'life begins at conception.'\"\nThe ruling Griffin signed enshrined the notion of \"fetal personhood\" into North Carolina law. There was widespread outrage about the ruling and its broader impact on the state. In response to the criticism, Griffin and the other judges who signed on took the usual step of formally withdrawing the decision . That means \"the potential precedent it had established regarding personhood no longer exists.\"\nNow that he is seeking a promotion to the North Carolina Supreme Court, Griffin and his allies are attempting to make any discussion of reproductive rights off-limits.\nThe politicization of the Judicial Standards Commission\nThis is not the first time Democrats on the court have been targeted with investigations by the Judicial Standards Commission. In August 2023, North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Anita Earls received a letter from the commission informing her that she was under investigation for suspicion of violating the state’s Code of Judicial Conduct . The investigation centered around comments that Earls, the only Black woman on the court, made about the court’s approach to racial and gender discrimination in an interview with legal publication Law360.\nIn the interview, Earls was asked about a study that found that attorneys who argued before the North Carolina Supreme Court were primarily white and male. Earls responded that she sees “gender and race discrepancies” in the court caused by “implicit bias.” Earls noted that she thought the court treated white male attorneys with “more respect,” and that there were certain cases where she believed \"[her] colleagues [were] unfairly cutting off a female advocate.” Earls also criticized the court’s decision to shut down diversity and equity efforts.\nEarls clarified that she did not believe this was “conscious, intentional, racial animus,” but rather “that our court system, like any other court system, is made up of human beings and I believe the research that shows that we all have implicit biases.” Earls did not discuss any cases that had come before the Supreme Court.\nThe Commission’s letter alleged that Earls’ comments “potentially violate[d] Canon 2A of the Code of Judicial Conduct which requires a judge to conduct herself ‘at all times in a manner which promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.’”\nIn response to the investigation, Earls sued the Judicial Standards Commission, arguing that the investigation violated her constitutional right to free speech. Earls asked a federal court “to stop any action against her for simply expressing ‘her right to speak on matters of public concern.’” In November 2023, a federal judge rejected Earls’ request for a preliminary injunction to block the investigation. In January, the commission’s investigation was dropped without any discipline against Earls. In response, Earls dropped the lawsuit.\nThe North Carolina legislature changed the composition of the Judicial Standards Commission in October 2023, increasing the number of members appointed by Republican politicians. Under the new rules, state House and Senate leaders appointed four judges to the commission, replacing four attorneys chosen by the State Bar. The changes gave “ the GOP near-total control over enforcement of judicial ethics rules .”\nThe changes were “criticized by former judges, attorneys, experts and state lawmakers for undermining the independence of the judiciary,” Carolina Public Press reported . North Carolina Representative Marcia Morey (D) denounced the move, stating , “We’re kicking off all the lawyers on the commission, the very ones that are in the courtroom, that know the ethics, that know what judges should do and should not do.” According to a 2023 report , North Carolina is one of only two states to not have any attorney appointments on its judicial conduct commission.\n927\nShare this post\nRepublican legislators in North Carolina demand investigation of judge for mentioning reproductive rights popular.info",

    "title": "Taylor Swift breaks silence 2 weeks after thwarted terror attack at Vienna shows",
    "text": "Exactly two weeks after her Vienna shows were canceled due to a thwarted terrorist attack , Taylor Swift has finally broken her silence on the “devastating” events.\nIn a heartfelt Instagram post on Wednesday , the 34-year-old pop superstar reflected on the entirety of the European leg of her Eras Tour, revealing the plot in Vienna filled her “with a new sense of fear and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows.”\nHowever, she expressed her deepfelt gratitude to local authorities, saying that, “thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives.”\nThree Vienna performances, scheduled to begin on Aug. 8, were canceled just one day before showtime after authorities uncovered a planned terrorist attack by teenagers who pledged their allegiance to the Islamic State .\nThree suspects, 17, 18 and 19 years old, were arrested in connection with the plot . Law enforcement later said they planned to kill as many spectators as possible outside the stadium.\nIn addressing why she had not spoken about the incident sooner, Swift said, “Let me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows.”\n“In cases like this one, ‘silence’ is actually showing restraint, and waiting to express yourself at a time when it’s right to,” she continued, adding that her focus became the safety of the hundreds of thousands of fans coming to her subsequent shows in London.\n“My team and I worked hand in hand with stadium staff and British authorities every day in pursuit of that goal, and I want to thank them for everything they did for us,” she said.\nAs her record-breaking Eras Tour now takes a brief hiatus until it resumes in Miami this October, Swift shared her gratitude for the support and unity shown by her fans during this difficult time.\n“To the fans who have seen us this summer, you’ll always have the most sparkling place in my memories. You were a dream to perform for, dance with, and share those magical moments with,” she said.\nWith News Wire Services",

    "text": "Juba (Agenzia Fides) - In the hope, albeit weak, of finding alive the priest and his driver who disappeared on April 27, the Bishop of Tombura-Yambio, Edward Hiiboro Kussala, announced funeral prayers for the two men. \"It is with deep sadness and heavy hearts that we inform you of official funeral prayers for our priest and colleague Rev Father Luke Yugue and his driver Michael Gbeko who went missing on April 27, 2024 while on their way from Nagero County to Tambura County The Funeral prayers starts Thursday 23 – 25 May 2024, ending with Funeral Holy Mass, Saturday morning\", Bishop Kussala said, but added that they were still looking for answers about their fate. Father Luke and Michael Gbeko have been missing since April 27, the day they left Nagero District in South Sudan on a motorcycle bound for Tombura in Western Equatoria State. They last spoke on the phone to catechist Ngbandua from Maringindo at 1 p.m. local time; they did not reach their destination and could not be located by telephone. The priest was reportedly kidnapped along with his companion following clashes between various factions in the area. Bishop Kussala had repeatedly called for people to look for the priest and his companion. “I ask you, give me information about my Priest; I need my Priest; Give him back to me, please,\" he asked the South Sudanese authorities in this context. The Bishop of Tombura-Yambio describes Father Yugue as a young priest loved by the faithful who dedicated his life to serving vulnerable communities and displaced people affected by the ongoing conflict in Nagero and Tombura counties. Recent intercommunal clashes in Tambura have claimed dozens of lives, including several abductees, and increased instability in the region, forcing thousands to seek refuge in UN refugee camps The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) said it had deployed 76 additional peacekeepers to reinforce its peacekeepers, protect displaced families and increase patrols in the region. According to UNMISS, more than 13,000 people have sought refuge in a refugee camp outside a temporary UN base, and 4,000 came seeking shelter in another camp in the town of Tambura. (L.M.)

    "title": "Las negociaciones para el alto el fuego en Gaza avanzan y se acercan a un principio de acuerdo",
    "text": "El Cairo (EFE).- Las negociaciones para alcanzar un alto el fuego en la Franja de Gaza avanzan positivamente y se acercan a un principio de acuerdo, si bien las partes todavía no han cerrado ningún pacto definitivo, informaron este sábado a EFE fuentes conocedoras de las conversaciones que tienen lugar en El Cairo. Una fuente palestina dijo a EFE, bajo condición de anonimato, que “hay un gran avance en las negociaciones entre el movimiento palestino Hamás e Israel”, y detalló que la delegación egipcia en el proceso negociador “ha alcanzado una formulación acordada en cuanto a los puntos de discrepancia”. Entrega de rehenes y tropas israelíes fuera de Gaza Precisó que el último acuerdo sobre el que discuten actualmente incluye una primera fase de 40 días de tregua en la que se liberarán 33 rehenes del total de unos 128 rehenes israelíes retenidos por Hamás, mientras que el Ejército israelí se retirará de las zonas en las que esté presente en la Franja de Gaza. Según esta misma fuente, la segunda fase continuará por otro periodo de 42 días durante el cual se liberarán todos los rehenes restantes y se extenderá un proceso de “calma permanente en Gaza”, mientras que la tercera y la última fase incluirá intercambiar los cadáveres y durará también 42 días. También apuntó que “(Sinwar) quiere un compromiso estadounidense por escrito para el fin incondicional de los combates” y solicita también que Israel no impida regresar al territorio ocupado de Cisjordania a los palestinos liberados a cambio de los rehenes. Netanyahu: Entraremos en Rafah “con o sin acuerdo” de tregua Según un alto funcionario de Hamás citado por la cadena catarí Al Yazira, el hecho de que [Netanyahu insista en que Israel entrará en la ciudad de Rafah](https://efe.com/mundo/2024-04-30/ofensiva-israel-rafah/) con independencia de un posible acuerdo es un “elemento clave” que también se está discutiendo hoy en las conversaciones. Hasta el momento, en el enclave palestino, al menos 32 personas fallecieron en las últimas 24 horas, lo que elevó a 34.654 el número de víctimas mortales registradas en los hospitales del enclave, además de más de 77.900 heridos, según datos del Ministerio de Sanidad gazatí, dependiente de Hamás. Seis países árabes presentan a EEUU 14 puntos para el día después de la guerra El Comité Ministerial Árabe, formado por Palestina, Egipto, Jordania, Arabia Saudí, Emiratos Árabes Unidos y Baréin, presentó este sábado un documento de 14 puntos al secretario de Estado de Estados Unidos, Antony Blinken, para el día después de la guerra en la Franja de Gaza. El primer punto establece el reconocimiento inmediato del Estado palestino y su aceptación en la ONU como miembro de pleno derecho, mientras que el segundo solicita protección total a la Agencia de la ONU para los Refugiados Palestinos (UNRWA) “al ser el suministrador principal de la ayuda humanitaria en Gaza”. También piden la retirada completa de las fuerzas israelíes de la Franja de Gaza en 21 días desde el anuncio del alto el fuego y trasladar la autoridad gubernamental del enclave palestino a la Autoridad Palestina, además de “la entrada de sus fuerzas a todas las partes de la Franja con ayuda internacional”. El documento incluye, entre sus reclamaciones, “ampliar la ayuda internacional para construir los aparatos de seguridad de la Autoridad Palestina para desplegar las fuerzas de mantener la paz de la ONU, no solo en Gaza, sino también en Cisjordania y Jerusalén Este en base de una decisión del Consejo de Seguridad”. Asimismo, insta a aplicar los acuerdos firmados entre Israel y Palestina, incluso los firmados en Al Aqaba y Sharm El Sheikh, y a celebrar una conferencia internacional para lograr la creación de los dos estados.",
