    "text": "Recovery efforts began in Ruidoso on Wednesday following Tuesday's deadly flash flooding, which decimated the area.At a mobile home park in Gavilan Canyon, many residents returned to homes that had been destroyed - floors caked in a layer of thick mud, doorsteps piled high with debris, and some homes swept clean off their foundations.This was my cousin's house. And we don't know where it is, said resident Darlene Apachito.Many were frightened by the impending floodwaters when warnings were issued on Tuesday, so they moved out of the way.We left like 30 minutes early because I said, 'We better leave. Look what happened in Texas. We don't know this time,' I said. So we left, said Apachito.For others, it was a helpless feeling, knowing they could not do anything to stop the raging waters.I was actually across from the links the golf course and I ended up getting stranded there because the water just came so fast it was all over the road. We didn't know what to do and there was no way we could help, said another resident, Alexx Chavez.Volunteers were also out in full force Wednesday, helping residents pick up the pieces.I'm really happy that the community came out here and started helping people who live in poverty and trailer parks because it's hard, it's hard working from day to day and losing everything all at once, said Gisselle Villareal, a volunteer in Ruidoso.One volunteer described the community's response: We had essentially a search party, going on throughout the whole town, just to see who or what could be possibly in danger.Another volunteer expressed the importance of community support, saying, I'm just trying to take the frowns off of peoples faces by giving them a cold water, a bear hug, and giving back to our community, we always do, and we always will.Rain was not an issue for Ruidoso on Wednesday; however, with chances for storms remaining in the forecast for much of the week, and with much of monsoon season still ahead, the flood threat looms.Many say that because of this impending threat, they do not want to stay.I just feel like the whole trailer park should get rid of-- I don't-- there's no more for us to be living here. Like, we're in danger, said Moraima Aguirre, a Ruidoso resident.We should have moved the first time, but we didn't, but now this one is scary, said Apachito.Sign up to receive the top interesting stories from in and around our community once daily in your inbox.",

    "title": "OLYMPICS WOMEN’S FOOTBALL: Falcons lose 1-0 to Brazil in Group C opener",
    "text": "Nigeria’s return to the Olympics saw the Super Falcons lose to Brazil in their Paris 2024 opener. Nigeria’s Super Falcons made their long-awaited return to Olympic football after a 16-year absence, but their Paris 2024 campaign got off to a disappointing start with a 1-0 loss to Brazil in their opening match. The game’s decisive moment came in the first half when Gabriela Nunes Da Silva unleashed a ferocious strike that proved to be the only goal of the contest. A positive start by Randy Waldrum women which saw Chiwendu Ihezuo miss Nigeria’s best chance of the game, the Super Falcons played second fiddle all through the encounter after plenty of attacking intent. Nigeria had three big chances in quick succession, one of which was led by Rasheedat Ajibade, Nigeria’s best player, beating her marker before crossing for Ihezuo, whose header was saved by Brazil’s goalkeeper. It was the Super Falcons’ best chance and Ihezuo, who was favoured to start by a Nigerian legend, should have scored. However, the Samba Girls took control after those threatening moments, going on to control the game en route to another win against Nigeria. This result extends Brazil’s unbeaten run against Nigeria to four matches, continuing the Super Falcons’ struggles against the Samba Girls. This defeat marks a challenging start for Randy Waldrum’s side, who find themselves in a formidable Group C alongside reigning world champions Spain and Asian powerhouse Japan. The match echoed their previous Olympic meeting in Beijing 2008, which was also Nigeria’s last appearance in the tournament.",

    "text": "Suburban locations, coffee bars: Coworking business model adapts to evolving workforce Walking into the [Industrious](https://www.industriousoffice.com/) coworking space on Dartmouth Street in Boston, guests find themselves in a common area complete with a cafe and front desk. The sound of hushed chatter and keyboard clicking fills the room. Visiting one of Industrious’ other locations — [seven in the Boston area](https://www.industriousoffice.com/locations) and over 160 in over 65 cities — would be a remarkably similar experience. Each identical space is set up in the same way. Founded in 2012, Industrious has grown into the third-largest coworking space provider in the world. The concept, developed in the early 2000s, is modeled on providing workspace and community for freelance and independent workers and people who travel frequently. But as companies adapt to the post-pandemic world of hybrid work, companies are fine-tuning their approaches. Chief Operating Officer Liz Simon attributes Industrious’ success to its [business model](https://www.industriousoffice.com/blog/industrious/video-partnership-business-model-sustainable), where the company partners with landlords to jointly create and run the space, splitting the costs and revenue. The company uses a partnership model with landlords, \"which makes our business a lot more of a sustainable one as compared to WeWork which obviously is having its own challenges at the moment,” she said. WeWork’s business model That is in sharp contrast to WeWork, once a highly publicized player in coworking and valued at nearly $50 billion, [filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy](https://apnews.com/article/wework-bankruptcy-be8c36b9720377334645e37c73d55e6e) protection in November. It has drastically scaled back its footprint as it works through its legal issues. Unlike Industrious, WeWork grew extremely rapidly and signed fixed lease agreements with landlords on large office spaces, leaving the company with high fixed liabilities that use up a large portion of its revenue, according to Simon. WeWork’s model was “unsustainable” from the start, Simon said, but the pandemic exacerbated the company’s economic issues even more. “They were taking on very, very large spaces, which didn't stay occupied during the pandemic,” she said. “The thing about fixed leases is that you're on the hook to pay rent no matter what, no matter what occupies your spaces.” Still, Eric Benvenuti, WeWork’s Boston portfolio director, said he views the bankruptcy as a “tool” that the company can leverage when making its future business decisions. “It gives us clarity into operating a successful, strong business moving forward,” he said. “I know in Boston, there's a great opportunity to be successful.” On Cape Cod: [Office community without office politics. How coworking helps Cape Cod's remote workers](/story/business/2023/10/24/cape-cod-coworking-sharing-office-space-productivity-remote-work/71154741007/) Post-pandemic target audience and consumer benefits WeWork offers [different types of memberships](https://www.wework.com/solutions): a private office, a full-floor office and an individual desk in a shared office space. Similarly, Industrious has [plans](https://www.industriousoffice.com/solutions) for teams, individuals and hybrid workers. [Workbar](https://www.workbar.com/), a coworking company with 11 locations in greater Boston, focuses mainly on providing multiple “open coworking” spaces in each location available to all members. Workbar Content Manager Madison Powers said most members in the downtown location are companies, while the Quincy office houses mainly individuals. “Right now is such a transitional period in the industry as more companies are requiring people to go back to work in the office full time,” she said. “So the trends are evolving.” While Workbar’s target audience has not changed since COVID-19, Powers said interest has increased, especially with mid-sized businesses that moved out of their office during the pandemic and want to work in-person together again. As the workplace landscape changes, Powers said Workbar has emphasized the benefits of coworking as part of the emerging hybrid model. “I think more than traditional office space we're competing with home now,” she said. Powers said coworking spaces can offer companies financial benefits. “These bigger companies can lease office space here and it's significantly less expensive than traditional office space and the benefits and the amenities are so far greater,” she said. Simon said she has seen an increase in larger companies using coworking spaces since the pandemic hit. “Most larger enterprises are building some use of flexible office and other workplace solutions,” she said. “Either because they have a more distributed workforce now than they once did [or] because they have more flexible policies with respect to when and how their employees need to be in the office.” Headquartered in Barcelona, [TravelPerk](https://www.travelperk.com/) is a large startup company with 1,200 employees globally that provides business travel services from its hubs in Europe and the United States and uses coworking spaces for its employees in Boston, Chicago and Miami. Stuart Blake, vice president of North America at TravelPerk, said the company chose to use coworking spaces because of the “flexibility” and “shorter-term commitments.” “Markets have been a little wobbly and people are very anxious about what the future might hold,” Blake said. “Knowing that (startup businesses are) signing a one-year lease versus signing a 10-year lease provides more confidence for those business owners.” Boston’s office real estate Benvenuti said he thinks WeWork can provide a solution for companies that want to downsize. “We've been able to be that stopgap for a lot of people,” he said. “Rather than spending money on 25,000 square feet all the time that you're not using, spend money on 5,000 square feet that you are consistently using with the ability to buy additional conference rooms (and) space networking areas.” Benvenuti said WeWork has been adjusting its business strategy post-pandemic to attract customers back to their offices. “How can we minimize the cost of real estate that you need to maximize the output you get from your people?” he said. “Ideally, you can start working at WeWork and nail those space requirements so you're maximizing your dollar spend on real estate.” With many people still working from home, companies do not need as much real estate as they once did, leaving Boston with an excess of available office space. W. Keith Munsell, head of the real estate concentration in Boston University’s Questrom School of Business, said he attributes the surplus of office space to the “demise of WeWork, the pandemic and the partial back to work culture.” Greater Boston and its inner suburbs have a vacancy rate of over 20%, more than double the 9% range in late 2018, according to Munsell. That could be a drag on growth, Munsell said, because he expects lenders to be hesitant to finance or refinance buildings where coworking space has a large footprint. Expansion into suburbs predicted Simon said commutes have become the “No. 1 driver” for why workers are reluctant to return to the office, and she expects more coworking spaces to pop up in “mixed-use” neighborhoods as opposed to business districts. “Bringing office more closely to where people live I think is definitely a trend that we're gonna see more of,” she said. Benvenuti said he expects coworking spaces to expand more into the suburbs. Workbar has its largest presence in suburban locations outside Boston’s metropolitan area, Powers said, where many Boston employees live. Workbar just expanded its Needham location. “It's an affluent community where most of the people work for companies that would otherwise require them to commute to Boston,” Powers said of the Needham location. “Our suburban locations are the busiest.” Constance Hadley, founder of the [Institute for Life at Work](https://www.institutelifework.org/), said coworking spaces are being used as a “planned intervention to revitalize certain cities and towns.” “Creating a coworking space can attract people to want to move there,” she said. “If you build it, they will come.” Hadley, who has researched the psychology of work and employee well-being, said most people she interviewed were attracted to coworking spaces that felt “local” and embodied the “flavor of the neighborhood.” “What people want is their local coffee shop, they don't want a Starbucks,” Hadley said. “Looking forward, I think the coworking sites that will do best are those that can have that local feel.” Thanks to our subscribers, who help make this coverage possible.

    "text": "Georgia puede ser conocida por sus veranos calurosos y húmedos, pero sus inviernos son bastante suaves, por lo que no pensarías que el sol estaría causando problemas en esta época del año. Desafortunadamente, para una familia que vive al norte de Atlanta, ese no es el caso. Su hija\n2022 Honda Cívico se está derritiendo, WSB-TV informa.\nSegún Charles Goldberg, los espejos laterales, el parachoques y otras molduras de su hija comenzaron a deformarse y aparecieron burbujas en la pintura. “Es como si alguien disparara una pistola de rayos a nuestro auto”, le dijo al medio de comunicación y agregó: “Nunca había visto nada”. Me gusta. También se deformó y comenzó a derretirse y desintegrarse”.\nSin embargo, cuando llevaron el auto al concesionario, recibieron noticias aún peores. Las ventanas energéticamente eficientes están diseñadas para reflejar la energía del sol. , manteniendo el interior de la casa más fresco y, según el distribuidor, a veces el resplandor que sale de una de esas ventanas puede ser suficiente para derretir los plásticos exteriores de un automóvil. Sin embargo, debido a que se considera un daño ambiental, no está cubierto por la garantía del fabricante.\nWSB-TV contactó a Honda para hacerle un comentario y le dijeron:\nEs un hecho establecido desde hace tiempo que la luz solar enfocada puede calentar superficies y causar daños, dependiendo de la intensidad y el tiempo de exposición. Este tipo de daño no está aislado en los automóviles, ni en Honda en particular. En resumen, en las circunstancias adecuadas, aunque es poco frecuente, la luz del sol se refleja puede causar daños y las garantías limitadas de Honda no cubren los daños.\nLos Goldberg, sin embargo, no parecen particularmente contentos con esa explicación y, según se informa, han presentado una queja ante Honda Corporate. Desafortunadamente para ellos, Si bien una búsqueda rápida de “Honda derritiéndose” arroja varios resultados en foros, si profundizas un poco más, los propietarios de Honda no Son los únicos que se ocupan de problemas similares. Aún así, considerando cuántas quejas hay sobre el derretimiento de Hondas, uno debe preguntarse si podría cambiar el tipo de plástico exterior que utiliza para hacer que sea menos probable que se derrita.\nEste contenido ha sido traducido automáticamente del material original.

    "text": "NEEDHAM, Mass. (WHDH) – A woman in Massachusetts is celebrating her 113th birthday. The reason she gave for making it so long may be surprising. At 113 years old, Herlda Senhouse may be the oldest resident in Massachusetts. The centenarian was born the same year as Lucille Ball and Ronald Reagan. The president at the time was William Howard Taft. It was also the year construction began on Fenway Park in Boston. During her birthday celebration, Senhouse was surrounded by loved ones at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in Needham. She was honored with a special cane given to the oldest resident of her hometown in Wellesley. Senhouse’s friend, Margaret Robinson, was there to help celebrate. “She’s a lovely person and very kind, very giving, very inspirational, absolutely a wonderful person,” Robinson said. Senhouse was born in West Virginia before she moved to Massachusetts at a young age. “I’m so happy. It’s awesome,” she said. A fan of the slot machines, Senhouse said she is looking forward to her next trip to the casino. Senhouse said she credits living a more stress-free life as the reason for her longevity. “I didn’t have children,” she said. Copyright 2024 WHDH via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Silence Speaks: A Good Friday Reflection On The Islamic State's Persecution Of African Christians | MEMRI",
    "text": "\"Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\" – Matthew 5:10 Today, Christians the world over will commemorate Good Friday, the occasion of the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. Everywhere the liturgies will be solemn and the faithful will grieve, but nowhere will more Christians mourn than in Africa, where the faith's largest flock [[1]](https://www.memri.org/reports/silence-speaks-good-friday-reflection-islamic-states-persecution-african-christians#_edn1) is also one of its most persecuted. There, the cry of Good Friday [[2]](https://www.memri.org/reports/silence-speaks-good-friday-reflection-islamic-states-persecution-african-christians#_edn2) will resonate with the weary voices of countless Christians who are silently suffering from violence, abuse, and persecution at the hands of the Islamic State (ISIS). But, despite the cacophony of their cries, the world will – unfortunately – remain largely indifferent. The world's attention was last briefly fixated on the continent's persecuted a decade ago, in February 2015. At the time, an ISIS video, entitled \"A Message in Blood to the Nation of the Cross,\" broadcast for all to witness the brutal and shocking beheading of 21 Coptic Orthodox Christians on a beach in Libya – It proved to be but a foreshadowing of the terrors to come. [[3]](https://www.memri.org/reports/silence-speaks-good-friday-reflection-islamic-states-persecution-african-christians#_edn3) Other notorious attacks elsewhere by the Islamic State on Christians have generated even more fleeting attention: the 2010 massacre in the Syriac Catholic Cathedral in Baghdad on All Saints ‘Eve, the twin suicide bombing of Coptic Orthodox churches in Tanta and Alexandria, Egypt on Palm Sunday 2017, and five years ago, the ISIS attacks on three churches (two Catholic and the third Evangelical) on Easter Sunday in Sri Lanka. But nowhere has the ISIS frenzy against Christians been as bloody and as sustained as on the African continent. ISIS fighters behead 21 Coptic Christians in Libya, February 15, 2015. Today, global attention has waned while ISIS's persecution of African Christians has not. In fact, violence against Christian believers has surged as ISIS expands its reach across the continent. ISIS fighters now routinely reenact that harrowing scene on Libya's beach in countries such as Nigeria, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Burkina Faso and Mali – and gleefully publicize the acts online – as part of a continent-wide campaign of terror designed both to intimidate and inspire violence. [[4]](https://www.memri.org/reports/silence-speaks-good-friday-reflection-islamic-states-persecution-african-christians#_edn4) For those of us who daily monitor ISIS, the targeted violence against Christians that has accompanied the group's expansion is unsurprising. Indeed, ISIS has long prioritized the persecution of Christians as being a crucial manhaj, or methodology, for projecting strength and driving recruitment, [[5]](https://www.memri.org/reports/silence-speaks-good-friday-reflection-islamic-states-persecution-african-christians#_edn5) and its supporters regularly boast of \"breaking the crosses\" [[6]](https://www.memri.org/reports/silence-speaks-good-friday-reflection-islamic-states-persecution-african-christians#_edn6) and \"returning the Islamic conquests to Africa.\" SUPPORT OUR WORK ISIS fighters behead two Christians in Mozambique on March 17, 2024. But what is also unsurprising is that Africa's Christians remain resilient to this terror. Even after almost ten years of persecution – and the world's deafening silence – The faithful are thriving on the continent as never before; in fact, African Christians now number over 718 million, the most of any continent. [[7]](https://www.memri.org/reports/silence-speaks-good-friday-reflection-islamic-states-persecution-african-christians#_edn7) Cardinal Robert Sarah, a Guinean and Prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, perhaps offers an explanation. In an interview about his book, The Power of Silence: Against the Dictatorship of Noise, Sarah noted: \"When I traveled to countries that were going through violent, profound crises, sufferings and tragic miseries [...] I observed that silent prayer is the last treasure of those who have nothing left. Silence is the last trench where no one can enter, the one room in which to remain at peace, the place where suffering for a moment lays down its weapons. In suffering, let us hide ourselves in the fortress of prayer.\" [[8]](https://www.memri.org/reports/silence-speaks-good-friday-reflection-islamic-states-persecution-african-christians#_edn8) So today, on this day of silent remembrance, Christians will quietly reflect not only on the suffering of Jesus, but also on the continued suffering of his followers. And they should do so not in the silence of indifference practiced by the world, but in the silence of contemplative prayer practiced by Africa's resilient faithful. For as Cardinal Sarah writes: \"The grace of Easter is a profound silence, an immense peace, and a pure taste in the soul. It is the taste of heaven, away from all disordered excitement.\" [[9]](https://www.memri.org/reports/silence-speaks-good-friday-reflection-islamic-states-persecution-african-christians#_edn9) ISIS fighters topple a cross in Mozambique in February 2024. The cross bears the Portuguese word \"hope.\" *Matt Schierer is a research fellow at MEMRI JTTM Project.
