    "text": "Corpus Christi. Today’s readings:\nExodus 24,3-8; Hebrews 9,11-15; Mark 14,12-16,22-26\nThe Omnivore’s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals, by Michael Pollan, and Resetting the Table: Straight Talk About the Food We Grow and Eat, by Robert L. Paarlberg, are but two books among the many volumes that have been published about food ethics. Over the last decades, consumers have generally shown an increased interest in where their food comes from, how it is produced, and whether all this raises any ethical concerns.\nApart from questions related to sustainability, we want to know what kind of nutritional value our food has, whether it has been genetically modified, and whether the animals from which meat has been procured have been treated with sufficient dignity. There are those who also refuse to eat any meat or animal products for various reasons.\nApart from ethically motivated choices, food brings with it a whole culture of excellence. Long traditions of experimentation and degustation have led to distinctions being made between high quality foods and less sophisticated types. Olive oil may be classified as IGP or DOP, and wines may fall under the IGT, DOC, or even DOCG category.\nThen there are foods associated with particular regions, such as sparkling wine from Champagne, Gorgonzola cheese, Lardo di Colonnata, Aceto Balsamico di Modena, or the Neapolitan pizza. Gourmet lovers know how to select the choicest of foods.\nThis is none other than a DOD – Di Origine Divina (of divine origin) – and it is not meant to stimulate the senses, but to benefit the whole person who partakes of it\nFood has not escaped the domain of religious attention either. Here, the distinction is sometimes made between that which may be eaten and that which is not permissible. Hence, Jews will be careful to eat kosher food, while Muslims look out for the halal certification.\nFollowing their master’s teachings, Christians observe no restrictions when it comes to food consumption – except for the quantities eaten, of course, lest they succumb to indulgence and gluttony. Thanks to Jesus, who declared all food clean (\nMk 7,14-19), Christians may eat and drink to their hearts’ content.\nAs beautiful as this may be, today the Lord surprises us with a generosity and an extravagance that had never been contemplated. Corpus Christi – the Body of Christ – is precisely the celebration of this immeasurable gift of himself that Jesus gave us and which is way beyond the DOCG of wine or the DOP of olive oil or any other human classification that has been invented. This is none other than a DOD – Di Origine Divina (of divine origin) – and it is not meant to stimulate the senses, but to benefit the whole person who partakes of it.\nSadly, the Reformation of the 16th century put this long-held belief into question and our Protestant brothers and sisters chose to discard the hitherto fully accepted belief in the real presence of Jesus in the Eucharistic bread and wine. Hence, his words “Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life… (Jn 6,54)” were read merely figuratively as referring to those receiving help from his death. However, suffice it to say that the Greek term found in John’s Gospel for eating (trogo) means “to crunch”. A sense of real eating is conveyed, one that the Catholic Church has embraced from day one.\nThe fact that certain satanic rituals involve the desecration of the Holy Eucharist constitutes food for thought. Spurred by a diabolical frenzy to denigrate the Lord, the Eucharist is spat at and urinated upon. A small white host will not suffice; it must be consecrated for such an act to be accepted by Satan. Indeed, the Lord was once confronted by a demon who stated: “I know who you are – the Holy One of God!” (Lk 4,34).\nIt is shocking that the devil can recognise the Lord’s holy presence, even in the Eucharist, but that we often fail to stand in awe of this wondrous mystery. Let the real connoisseurs prepare themselves to eat.\nIndependent journalism costs money. Support Times of Malta for the price of a coffee.\n[Support Us](/donate)",

    "text": "- By [Simran Srivastav](/authors/simran-srivastav) - Published: Thu, 18 Apr 2024 08:52 PM (IST) - Source:JND Fashion designer-actor Masaba Gupta and Bollywood actor Satyadeep Misra have announced their first pregnancy. The couple tied the knot on January 27, 2023, in an intimate yet beautiful wedding ceremony. The two announced the news of their pregnancy on social media and posted a beautiful picture of them sitting together. Sharing the pregnancy news, Masaba Gupta wrote, \"In other news - Two little feet are on their way to us! Please send love, blessings and banana chips ( plain salted ONLY) #babyonboard #mom&dad.\" View this post on Instagram On the work front, Masaba Gupta was seen in the web series 'Masaba Masaba', which is the fictionalised version of her life. The series also stars her mother Neena Gupta along with Neil Bhoopalam, Rytasha Rathore, Kusha Kapila, Kareema Barry, Barkha Singh, Ram Kapoor, and Armaan Khera. Talking about 'Masaba Masaba Season 2', director Sonam Nair said, \"When Ashvini Yardi brought Masaba Masaba to me, it was an idea, an idea I fell in love with immediately, and I was sure it was going to bring a host of good feelings with it. Bringing this series to life for me, was an experience I'll never forget. I got to experiment and work with not only a great service like Netflix but also incredibly dedicated, honest and talented actors. Season 2 is a pivot into newer regions but with the same amount of heart and I can't wait for audiences to see it\". Masaba Gupta owns a label called 'House of Masaba' and recently teamed up with Kareena Kapoor for her new collection. She was last seen in the anthology movie 'Modern Love: Mumbai', along with Ritwik Bhowmik.

    "title": "Harris criticizes calls for concessions from Ukraine during joint press conference with Zelensky in Washington",
    "text": "U.S. Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and President Volodymyr Zelensky gave a joint press conference in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 26, ahead of their in-private meeting. Zelensky has been in the U.S. since Sept. 22, where he has held a series of high-level meetings with foreign leaders, as well as a visit to the [Scranton Army Ammunition Plant](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-visits-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-to-thank-workers/) in Pennsylvania and an address to the [U.N. General Assembly](https://kyivindependent.com/there-can-be-no-just-peace-without-ukraine-zelenskys-full-speech-at-the-un-general-assembly/). Zelensky thanked Harris for her commitment to Kyiv and said, \"[we are grateful to America for supporting Ukraine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tifqz17GzBk&ab_channel=TheWhiteHouse).\" In her remarks, Harris reiterated her support for Ukraine and warned that a Russian victory would lead to further aggression and cause other nations with imperialist ambitions to be \"emboldened.\" Harris said that she had \"told world leaders (at the U.N.), nothing about the end of this war can be decided without Ukraine.\" But she added that \"there are some in my country who would instead force Ukraine to give up large parts of its sovereign territory, who would demand that Ukraine accept neutrality, and would require Ukraine to forego security relationships with other nations.\" \"These proposals are the same as those of [(Russian President Vladimir) Putin](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/vladimir-putin/), and let us be clear, these are not proposals for peace. Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable.\" While she did not mention anyone by name, some in the Republican Party, reportedly including presidential nominee Donald Trump, have suggested that Ukraine could cede territory in exchange for peace. At a rally on Sept. 24, Trump vowed to [get the U.S. \"out\"](https://kyivindependent.com/trump-vows-to-get-america-out-of-ukraine-war-blames-biden-for-conflict/) of the war in Ukraine if elected president. Trump's rhetoric against Zelensky and U.S. support for Ukraine has grown harsher in recent days. He has claimed that Zelensky [wants Democrats to win](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-wants-democrats-to-win-us-presidential-election-trump-claims/) the upcoming presidential election and referred to him as \"the greatest salesman on earth.\" Republican Vice Presidential nominee J.D. Vance said in an interview with Shawn Ryan earlier in September that Trump's plan to end Russia's war could include the establishment of a [special demilitarized zone](https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-peace-plan-could-include-creation-of-demilitarized-zone-between-russia-and-ukraine-vance-says/) between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine would retain its sovereignty, but at the same time, it would have to give guarantees to Russia that it would not join NATO or any other allied institutions, Vance added.",
