Ensenada, BC.- El problema de los feminicidios en el Estado ha dejado a una gran cantidad de menores desprotegidos que actualmente no reciben ningún apoyo, denunció Miriam Ayón Castro, integrante de la [Red de Mujeres Unidas por Baja California.](https://www.elimparcial.com/tijuana/tijuana/Ocupa-Baja-California-tercer-lugar-en-muertes-violentas-y-numero-13-en-feminicidios-20230918-0027.html) Recordó que en agosto de este año la red en conjunto con la Comisión Estatal de Derechos Humanos publicó un estudio sobre feminicidios, que arrojó que en el estado hay 51 sentencias de feminicidio que están catalogadas por el poder Judicial como sentencias con perspectiva de género.

Protocolo de orfandad Puntualizó que en los casos en los que las víctimas de feminicidio tuvieron hijos debió aplicarse un protocolo de orfandad donde tenía que haber intervenido la Procuraduría de la Defensa del Menor en el Estado. Hoy en día no hay una autoridad que nos pueda indicar qué ha pasado con los huérfanos del feminicidio, nos percatarnos que no había una reparación integral del daño, la ley establece cuáles son los elementos que se tienen que considerar para determinar la reparación del daño y la cuantía en cuanto al monto que el agresor tendrá que pagar como una indemnización a las víctimas y encontramos que se hizo todo de machote y solo se le puso el precio a la víctima sin considerarse las condiciones”, señaló. La activista dijo que se debe de considerar si el menor estaba en cierto nivel educativo y tenía ciertas necesidades, si el menor tenía alguna discapacidad o enfermedad que requiriera atención especial, las condiciones económicas de la familia que se hizo cargo del menor, entre otros elementos que se deben contemplar para que el menor tenga una vida digna.

Sentencias Refirió que en gran parte de los casos el agresor habría reconocido ser pareja de la víctima y por lo tanto con base en eso fue catalogado como un feminicidio y por consiguiente fue determinada una sentencia a través de un procedimiento abreviado. “No se profundizó y no se llevó un proceso legal ordinario como debió haber sido, hablando de un delito tan grave y más donde hay menores involucrados, fueron definidos por un procedimiento abreviado donde el reconocimiento del agresor donde asumía la culpa fue el elemento que fue considerado para tener una sentencia condenatoria, sin embargo, no se repara el daño ni representa una reparación integral”, enfatizó.

    "title": "If there’s a U.S. economic slowdown, will it be a hard or soft landing?",
    "text": "Global stocks took a hit recently amid fears that the U.S. economy was faltering.\nA weaker than expected jobs report, with a rising unemployment rate, was enough for some investors to come to their own conclusions about a coming recession – even if many economists didn’t share the same concerns .\nGoldman Sachs raised its odds of a recession occurring in the next year from 15 percent to 25 percent. Some economists have theorized that the economy will have a soft landing , or a slowdown that doesn’t bring about an outright recession, or hard landing.\nA complication for economists is that the labor force grew. More Americans entered the job market and looked for work. Those who are on the sidelines and looking for work are officially counted amid the ranks of “unemployed” in federal data, thereby boosting the unemployment rate.\nQ: If there’s a U.S. economic slowdown, will it be a hard or soft landing?\nEconomists Ray Major, economist\nSoft: The recent slowing of the economy evidenced by layoffs, reduction in consumer spending and the correction in the stock market all point to a looming economic correction. The real question is how willing and how quickly the Fed will use monetary policy to correct the economy in order to avoid a hard landing. In the past five years, it has successfully used the tools at their disposal to stave off a recession at any cost and seem to be poised to do it again.\nCaroline Freund, UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy\nSoft: Although the jobs market has weakened, unemployment remains relatively low and consumer confidence is stable. The Fed is poised to lower interest rates if the inflation rate continues to fall. However, risks remain and a recession could become a self-fulfilling prophecy if we keep fretting about the landing. Uncertainty leads consumers to delay purchases and businesses to hold back on investment and hiring. So, I am staying optimistic and focusing on the bright spots.\nKelly Cunningham, San Diego Institute for Economic Research\nHard: Flattening of the yield curve (the difference between long and short-term interest rates of bonds), after being inverted the previous two years, signals looming recession. Overspending fabricated dollars and escalating debt combine to make the recession even more severe. Rising unemployment and falling equity prices signal greater downturn as well. The Fed lowering interest rates will cause the money supply to further increase and result in even more inflation following already significantly risen consumer prices.\nJames Hamilton, UC San Diego\nSoft: There are certainly plenty of worries, including bad commercial real estate loans, weakness in the Chinese economy, and conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East that could easily blow up. The election outcome may bring destabilizing new tariffs or taxes. But based on what has happened so far, if we can avoid a major new disruptive shock, I think the most likely outcome is that we’ll see a slowdown without a recession in 2025.\nNorm Miller, University of San Diego\nSoft: Hard or soft is in the eye of the beholder. The housing/mortgage industry has been in a recession for a few years, but the overall economy has been so gung ho on AI and the promise of higher productivity that the overall GDP stats, next year, should be mildly negative, if at all. Lower interest rates could help some sectors, such as housing and car buying, so let’s hope the Fed lowers rates in September by 50 basis points.\nDavid Ely, San Diego State University\nSoft: The probability of a recession has increased over the past month, but the overall economy remains reasonably healthy. The number of unemployed workers increased in July, but that is in part due to more people entering the labor force. GDP growth over the past eight quarters has been positive. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower Interest rates starting in September, which will encourage greater borrowing and spending.\nAlan Gin, University of San Diego Soft: With the latest inflation report showing the rate of inflation falling, the Federal Reserve now has the leeway to be aggressive with rate cuts, and I expect them to do so. There probably will be three rate cuts by the end of the year. That will help the housing market and with rising consumer debt. Despite the rise in unemployment, the labor market is not in a downturn, as job growth remains positive, albeit at a slower pace.\nExecutives Phil Blair, Manpower\nSoft: The Federal Reserve has a great job monitoring our inflation rate over the last few years. Short any huge calamity, we have survived wars, storms and fires and the U.S. economy and stock market have continued to hum along.\nGary London, London Moeder Advisors\nSoft: The weakening of the key indicators is economic music to my ears. It is the outcome the Feds targeted to produce the soft landing. My sector, real estate, has effectively been in recession. The fact that we are now on the cusp of a cut in the Fed rate will certainly cause a concomitant decrease in long-term mortgage rates, marking the beginning of a resurgence in transaction volume, activating the vital construction market.\nBob Rauch, R.A. Rauch & Associates\nSoft: The economy can avert a recession with a few interest-rate drops soon. However, we are facing record debt and deficit spending. We must start running the country like a business, or the next recession will be profound, long and painful. The lockdowns of 2020 put us into a short but deep recession. If we want a deep, prolonged recession later in this decade, we should continue the mismanagement of our economy.\nAustin Neudecker, Weave Growth\nSoft: While too early to tell, I will vote hopefully that the economy lands softly. Some portion of the recent jobs report is due to new people searching for jobs that were previously considered out of the market. Luckily, the central bank has built space to reduce interest rates. Most economic indicators remain strong and barring large extraneous factors, we should be able to guide the landing.\nChris Van Gorder, Scripps Health\nHard: Not much has changed in the overall economic big picture, but higher interest rates are probably now having their full effect, and we may see slowdowns in parts of the economy. The biggest risk to our economy would be from a shock such as a broader war in the Middle East, a turn in the Ukraine war or other unknown risks. Such shocks have historically had the power to drive slowdowns or outright recessions.\nJamie Moraga, Franklin Revere\nHard: The U.S. economy continues to show mixed signals and increased volatility. While it may experience signs of a soft landing this year, there’s an increased possibility that we could see a recession in 2025. Global strife and uncertainty, rising cost of living, prolonged inflation, and increasing household debt have spooked investors. While the economy currently remains resilient, higher interest rates and a weakening jobs report contribute to an economy that remains unpredictable.\nNot participating this week: Haney Hong, San Diego County Taxpayers Association\nHave an idea for an Econometer question?

    "text": "[Back to top](#skip-link)\nPhoto diffusée par l'agence spatiale russe Roscosmos, le 11 avril 2024, montrant le décollage d'une fusée Angara-A5 depuis le cosmodrome de Vostochny, dans l'Extrême-Orient russe\nLa troisième tentative fut la bonne: après deux reports en deux jours, la Russie a finalement réussi jeudi le lancement de sa fusée de nouvelle génération Angara-A5 depuis le cosmodrome Vostotchny, dans l'Extrême-Orient russe.\nLe lancement a lieu à 9H00 GMT, selon une retransmission en direct sur le site de Roscosmos, l'agence spatiale russe.\nLes images montraient la fusée propulser dans les airs et s'élever dans le ciel.\n\"La fusée a fonctionné normalement, l'étage supérieur s'est séparé du troisième étage de la fusée\", s'est félicité dans un communiqué l'agence Roscosmos quelques minutes plus tard.\nCe lancement réussi intervient toutefois après deux reports en deux jours, mardi et mercredi, pour des raisons \"techniques\", avait expliqué Roscosmos, un nouvel accroc pour le programme spatial russe miné par les difficultés.\nLa fusée Angara-A5 est un engin de nouvelle génération développé dans le cadre d'un programme destiné à remplacer les vieillissants lanceurs Proton, dont la technologie remonte aux années 1960.\nCe programme moderne, dont l'idée remonte aux années 1990, a toutefois pris du retard et le calendrier fixé par les autorités russes au moment du premier essai, dès 2014, n'a pas été respecté.\nSource d'une immense fierté à l'époque soviétique, le secteur spatial russe s'est enlisé depuis la chute de l'URSS à force de scandales de corruption, de coupes budgétaires, de retards en série et de revers embarrassants, comme la perte de la sonde lunaire Luna-25 en août 2023.\nLe secteur reste limité par son manque d'innovation, la plupart de ses systèmes reposant sur des technologies soviétiques, généralement fiables mais vieillissantes.\nIl doit aussi faire face désormais à la concurrence renforcée de sociétés privées, comme l'américaine SpaceX du milliardaire Elon Musk, et de nouvelles puissances spatiales, comme l'Inde.",

The road works will make the road safer for all road users, including drivers, pedestrians and cyclists. The works include: - Coombes Road being widened (with sealed shoulders for cyclists) and resurfaced from Surf Coast Highway to Ghazeepore Road. - Intersection upgrade at Coombes Road and Messmate Road, including the installation of a roundabout. \"We know many locals are eager for these works to happen. I drive Coombes Road regularly so I know what a difference these works will make,\" said Cr Adrian Schonfelder \"As soon as the contractor is appointed, and the works schedule is known, we'll let residents know the timeframes and any temporary traffic impacts,\" he said.

    "text": "Heavy metal rock star condemns Hamas, supports Israel, after receiving gift from young fan\n\"Rape is not resistance. Slaughtering innocents at a music festival that brings together people from all walks of life is not resistance,\" said Draiman.\nDavid Draiman, the lead singer of the heavy metal group Disturbed, expressed strong support for Israel when a young female fan handed him a bracelet with the words “Am Israeli Chai,” which translates to “the people of Israel live.”\nThis occurred at a concert in Orlando, Florida on February 26, where Draiman\nsaid he could no longer stay silent.\nHe said he has family in Israel, according to\nFox News, and that he lost friends at the Nova Music Festival, which was hit hard during the massive terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas on October 7. The attack killed about 1,200 people with another 242 taken hostage, half of whom remain as hostages or are already dead.\n\"I miss people that were slaughtered like animals at the Nova Festival,\" he said onstage. \"Rape is not resistance. Slaughtering innocents at a music festival that brings together people from all walks of life is not resistance.\"\nThe band, Disturbed, is one of the most successful rock bands of the 21st century, according\nto Billboard.\n\"I genuinely feel empathy for the Palestinian people despite what everyone on the other side of the equation likes to claim.\" Draiman added. \"There is not a single Jew on this planet that does not celebrate life. We celebrate life. Hamas celebrates death and they need to be eradicated; not the Palestinians, Hamas. We need to save Gaza from Hamas.\"\nIn an interview with\nBreitbart, Draiman said that he has normally been \"very careful to not infuse Disturbed performances with any kind of political rhetoric,\" but rather \"tries to make concerts an escape from that.\" He added that the gift from the young fan \"seemed like a sign.\"\n\"I couldn’t not acknowledge her very precise, thoughtful gift without being insulting at that point, so I felt compelled to speak about it and I just went completely off the cuff, speaking from my heart and trying to address the elephant in the room, so to speak,\" he told the outlet. \"I just did the best that I could, and I’m glad that it resonated with as many people as it has apparently so far. Who knows? I can only hope that it has a continuing positive effect.\"",

    "text": "È una notte da sogno! L'Atalanta ribalta lo Sporting e vola ai quarti: a Bergamo finisce 2-1 Per Bergamo, con Bergamo. Lo aveva detto Gasperini alla vigilia: Sporting battuto e promessa mantenuta. L'Atalanta è ai quarti di finale grazie al 2-1 arrivato nella ripresa: prima Lookman e poi Scamacca hanno regalato una notte da sogno a tutta la città, un successo fondamentale per continuare la corsa in Europa. Alla fine saltano tutti, anche il Gasp: la Dea è ancora una volta nelle migliori otto dell'Europa League. L'Atalanta gioca, lo Sporting segna Alla fine l'Atalanta ha deciso di seguire la tattica proposta da Gianluca Scamacca, mettere lo Sporting spalle al muro partendo subito forte. Il numero 90 ha avuto una buona occasione dopo tre giri d'orologio, il tiro masticato è stato però intercettato senza troppi problemi da Israel. Interessante la lotta corpo a corpo tra Hien e Gyokeres, lo spauracchio maggiore visti i 33 gol in 37 partite giocate. I nerazzurri ci hanno riprovato al 13' con l'inserimento di Kolasinac, il bosniaco ha recuperato palla a centrocampo per poi chiudere l'azione, il colpo di testa però è terminato di poco sul fondo. I padroni di casa hanno provato a sfondare sia sulle corsie esterne che per vie centrali, ma a passare in vantaggio è stato lo Sporting con un'azione manovrata: Gyokeres ha mandato in porta Pedro Gonçalves - Ederson ha lasciato troppo spazio - per il portoghese è stato semplicissimo superare Musso. Timida la risposta di Holm, il tiro dal limite è stato bloccato senza problemi dall'estremo difensore dei biancoverdi. I nerazzurri nel secondo tempo hanno fatto l'unica cosa concepita, attaccare lo Sporting sin dal calcio d'inizio. Detto-fatto, la banda del Gasp ci ha messo 39 secondi per trovare il gol del pareggio con Lookman, fino a quel momento totalmente fuori dalla partita. La giocata del nigeriano ha ribaltato l'inerzia, da quel momento la Dea ha alzato i ritmi sorprendendo ancora una volta i lusitani sulla corsia destra, Miranchuk ha aperto il piattone per Scamacca, il numero 90 questa volta non ha sbagliato: 2-1 e sorpasso concluso. Lo Sporting ci ha provato due volte nel finale: Musso ha cancellato il pallonetto a Paulinho, Trincao invece ha spedito in curva. A far festa è l'Atalanta, ai quarti di finale d'Europa League.
