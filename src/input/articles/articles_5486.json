    "title": "U-Mary to open child care facility in Bismarck",
    "text": "A child care facility operated by some of the University of Mary's faculty, students and licensed early childhood teachers is set to open in Bismarck next year in an effort to hep alleviate the shortage of licensed facilities in the area.\nThe Center for Early Learning is scheduled to open June 1 on South Seventh Street, replacing the Butler Center near the Kirkwood Mall. Renovations are being funded through a $464,000 grant provided by the North Dakota Department of Commerce.\nIt is anticipated to operate Mondays through Fridays from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.\nThe center is expected to accommodate 70-80 children ranging in age from 2 months to 12 years. Included within the facility will be one infant room, one toddler room, three classrooms for children ages 3-6, and a fenced-in playground.\nUniversity's Education Chair Kim Marman described the center as a place for students to observe and learn behaviors displayed across various children.\nPeople are also reading…\n\"Faculty members (will) mentor our students in creating care plans or behavior plans for children with special needs. This practical experience is invaluable, and our students will also be involved in internships, practicum experiences and student teaching,\" Marman said [in a statement](https://www.umary.edu/about/news/all-stories/university-mary-open-one-kind-early-childhood-facility-central-bismarck).\nThe Liffrig Family School of Education and Behavioral Sciences and the Saint Gianna School of Health Sciences will partner to operate the center. The facility will include a Montessori-inspired curriculum that is rooted in Christian, Catholic and Benedictine values, the statement said.\n\"Our goal is to create a model for what early childhood education can look like,\" Jennifer Barry, director of the center, said in the statement. \"Not only are we addressing a critical community need, but we're also ensuring that our students gain real-world experience that will help them become better educators and caregivers in the future.\"\nThe center also plans to participate in the [North Dakota Child Care Assistance Program](https://www.hhs.nd.gov/applyforhelp/ccap), which helps some families finance child care while parents work or attend school. To qualify, a household's monthly income must fall below the program's income limits. For example, a two-person household -- including adults and children -- can earn up to $5,231 per month, while an eight-person household can have a maximum monthly income of $10,617.\nWhy is child care hard to find and afford?\nOne reason child care is difficult to access for parents is the ongoing struggle to recruit and retain staff at local facilities, the [North Dakota News Cooperative](https://bismarcktribune.com/news/community/mandannews/affordable-accessible-housing-north-dakota-challenge-capable/article_c6b0d722-19e8-11ef-bf53-4bdb95cd821a.html) reported in May.\nThe problem is compounded by a high cost of child care. The U.S. Department of Labor in [January 2023](https://blog.dol.gov/2023/01/24/new-childcare-data-shows-prices-are-untenable-for-families) compared child care costs to paying a second rent, showing just how expensive it is. Depending on the child’s age and type of care, costs can range from around $5,000 to more than $17,000 a year, consuming 8-19% of a typical family’s income, the department said.\nThe state has implemented multiple initiatives to address child care challenges. The North Dakota Development Fund is investing more than $2.4 million in loans to day care facilities to aid in expansions or purchasing buildings, according to a Thursday announcement from the state Department of Commerce. There was also the launch of the Child Care Workforce Benefit in June, which helps parents employed in licensed child care programs pay for their own child care costs for children up to 12 years of age.\nFurther, the [ND Working Parents Child Care Relief Program](https://www.hhs.nd.gov/wpccr/employers) launched in March 2023 allows employers to opt into a cost-sharing initiative aimed at taking away some financial burden of child care for families with children under 3.",

    "title": "12 years on, Roboski families continue to carry traces of massacre",
    "text": "12 years on, Roboski families continue to carry traces of massacre As 12 years have passed since the massacre that killed 34 people, of whom 19 were children, in the Roboski village of the southeastern province of Şırnak, the village continues to carry traces of the massacre, with no suspects brought to justice and wounds kept unhealed. Then-Prime Minister Erdoğan did not keep his promises he gave in the aftermath of the massacre, said Sadık Alma who lost his son in the Turkish army airstrikes. Hacı Bişkin / Gazete Duvar Roboski villagers in the southeastern province of Şırnak and politicians commemorated on Dec. 28 those killed in an airstrike, as the village continues to exhibit pain and suffering 12 years on. A total of 34 people, mostly children, were killed in an airstrike by the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) in Şırnak's border village of Roboski on Dec. 28, 2011. The bombs left bodies dismembered, with families unable to identify their loved ones. The pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy (DEM) Party co-chair Tülay Hatimoğulları also attended the commemoration. Sadık Alma, who lost his son 25-year-old Nadir Alma in the massacre, said that his pain is still fresh. Alma, who was among the delegation that met with the then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said that Erdoğan did not keep his promise he gave after the massacre. Alma said the attitude towards Kurds in Turkey has not changed 12 years on. “They tried to silence us. We did not remain silent. We resisted. Lawsuits were filed against us. But at this point, we, as Roboski families, have given up hope.” Then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan met with the Roboski families for the first time on July 26, 2013. “Erdoğan told us, 'I know about the case. I did not give the (airstrike) instruction. If you want, get the compensation, we will give you some positions from the state. I know everything. I promise to do my best.’ 12 years have passed. He didn't keep his promise. He was implicitly implying that the lawsuit we filed as Roboski families would not yield any results. That’s what happened,” Alma said. “They tried to silence us by offering (public employee) positions. If you are wondering, let me tell you that most of the compensation mentioned was not given either,” he added. Alma lastly noted that Erdoğan was covering up Roboski, but “the world knows what happened in Roboski. This massacre took place in front of the world.” Zeynep Encu, who lost 11 of her relatives in the airstrike, said they had more anger than mourning. “We were detained. Our houses were raided. A mother's son was murdered, one son was taken into custody, and one went to prison. The massacre was covered up. This silence made us very tired. We will not give up on our case. Many parties visited us. We have a request from them. When they go to the parliamentary rostrum, let them say justice to Roboski with one voice. Let them reopen the closed file,” she said. The Roboski families' search for justice both in domestic courts and in the international arena failed. Right after the massacre, the families filed a complaint in order for those responsible to be tried, but after years of waiting, a military prosecutor's office dismissed the case. The families in 2014 took the case to the Constitutional Court, which deemed it inadmissible due to errors in the submission that stemmed from the Şırnak Bar Association's serious mistakes. The latest blow to the Roboski families was dealt by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) when it dismissed their appeal on the grounds that domestic legal means weren't exhausted since the files weren't submitted properly to the Constitutional Court. On the other hand, former main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) deputy Levent Gök had a monument built for Roboski with the proceeds of his book “Roboski: Uludere’s Tears,” Ceren Bayar from Gazete Duvar reported. The monument, which could not be placed due to winter conditions, will be placed in the village when the winter conditions disappear. \"I commemorate with mercy the 34 civilians who were bombed and murdered in Uludere 12 years ago. We will not let this massacre be forgotten until all those responsible, who are protected because of a lack of effective investigation, are tried and the truth is revealed,\" CHP leader Özgür Özel said in a tweet. Uludere'de 12 yıl önce bombalanarak katledilen 34 sivil yurttaşımızı rahmetle anıyorum.— Özgür Özel (@eczozgurozel) Bu katliamı etkili soruşturma yapılamadığı için korunan tüm sorumlular yargılanana ve gerçekler açığa çıkana kadar unutturmayacağız.

    "text": "Brought to you by\nChild Base Ltd\nUp to 50 paid days leave off work in a year has staff at 44-day nurseries in the employee-owned Childbase Partnership celebrating an even better ‘work-life ‘ balance and another boost to workplace happiness.\nA ‘first’ in the Early Years Sector, the ‘Partnership Reward Days’ plan – based on hours worked in the previous three months – means full-timers could get up to five days extra paid leave in each quarter with pro-rata allocations for others.\nThis is in addition to their annual leave entitlement, which was extended last year, Long Service Reward Days and Bank holidays and gives colleagues the opportunity to sell a portion of their extra days if they would prefer a cash reward.\nCheering and applause greeted the announcement at the annual Virtual Roadshow event for over 2,300 employee-owners of Childbase Partnership – a UK ‘Best Company to Work for’ for 14 years – in day nurseries from Nottingham to Swindon.\nNursery Practitioner, Mariama Faal, said:\n“It is exciting to think what is possible with more free time and a brilliant way to support us in giving the best early years care and education to children and parents. As usual Childbase is going the extra mile to support us.”\nPractitioner Emma Kilsby said:\n“This is brilliant as time is precious. I am going to be a grandmother for the first-time next year. It will be lovely to have time to spend with my grandchild and help out.”\nEmma Rooney, Childbase Partnership Chief Executive said:\n“This is quite simply, the right thing to do for colleagues who continue to rise magnificently in these challenging times.”\nThe ‘extra leave’ initiative follows the £8.5 million Financial Support Plan to help colleagues meet cost of living challenges. This includes two meals a day in settings, fresh fruit and refreshments in staff rooms, and free feminine hygiene products in addition to ‘Perkbox’ access to discounted shopping and entertainment.\nJoin our team\nExtraordinary and rewarding careers working in Early Years\nCheck\nhere for latest vacancies.\nComments: Our rules\nWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
