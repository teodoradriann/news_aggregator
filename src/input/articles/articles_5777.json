    "title": "'Pre-existing temple was destroyed during Aurangzeb's rule': What ASI's Gyanvapi survey reveals - The Statesman",
    "text": "The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) report on the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi was made public on Thursday by the lawyers of Hindu petitioners. The report was shared with both Hindu and Muslim petitioners on orders of a Varanasi court. The report concluded that based on the scientific studies carried out in the Gyanvapi complex, it can be said that there existed a Hindu temple prior to construction of the existing structure. “During the survey, a number of inscriptions were noticed on the existing and pre-existing structures. A total of 34 inscriptions were recorded during the present survey and 32 estampages were taken. These are, in fact, inscriptions on the stones of the pre-existing Hindu temples, which have been re-used during the construction/ repair of the existing structure. Advertisement “They include inscriptions in Devanagari, Grantha, Telugu and Kannada scripts. Reuse of earlier inscriptions in the structure, suggest that the earlier structures were destroyed and their parts were reused in construction/repair of the existing structure. Three names of deities such as Janardhana, Rudra, and Umēśvara are found in these inscriptions,” the ASI survey report stated. It further said, “Existing architectural remains, decorated mouldings on the walls, karna-ratha and prati-ratha of central chamber, a large decorated entrance gate with torana on the eastern wall of the western chamber, a small entrance with mutilated image on lalat bimba, birds and animals carved for decoration in and outside suggest that the western wall is remaining part of a Hindu temple. Based on art and architecture, this pre-existing structure can be identified as a Hindu temple.” The ASI survey report said that the Arabic-Persian inscription inside a room mentioned the mosque was built in the 20th regnal year of Aurangzeb and it was during the Mughal ruler’s reign the pre-existing temple was destroyed. “The Arabic-Persian inscription found inside a room mentions that the mosque was built in the 20th regnal year of Aurangzeb (1676-77 CE). Hence, the pre-existing structure appears to have been destroyed in the 17th century, during the reign of Aurangzeb, and part of it was modified and reused in the existing structure,” it added.

    "title": "As Sydney Sweeney Circles Gundam, the Anime Has a Perfect Role For the Hollywood Star",
    "text": "It’s been a long road, but the live-action\nMobile Suit Gundam movie is finally coming together. Originally announced in 2018 as a partnership between Legendary Pictures and Netflix, the Gundam movie was restructured in 2025 as a joint production between Legendary and Bandai Namco after Netflix exited the collaboration. Details about the story and crew for this adaptation of the classic mecha anime franchise remain scarce. What we do know is that Jim Mickle, known for his work on Sweet Tooth, is set to write and direct—but until now, that's been just about all we’ve heard.\nThings changed earlier this week when it was reported that actress Sydney Sweeney—known for her roles in Madame Web and Immaculate—\nis in final talks to star in the Gundam movie. The news has sent shockwaves through the Gundam fandom worldwide, sparking a flurry of speculation about which role she might take on. While no official details about the plot or characters have been revealed, one classic Gundam character seems like a natural fit for Sweeney: Sayla Mass.\nWho Is Sayla Mass? A Classic Character With Deep Roots\nSayla Enjoys An Enduring Popularity Across The Gundam Universe\nSayla Mass is a character who dates all the way back to the very first episode of Mobile Suit Gundam in 1979 and plays a key role in the original One Year War storyline. She serves as both a communications and medical officer aboard the Earth Federation’s assault carrier, White Base. Sayla is also secretly the younger sister of series antagonist Char Aznable, and her family history is deeply entwined with the very conflict she’s fighting in.\nWhile technically a supporting character, Sayla’s arc is rich with drama and emotional moments. Fans have long admired her quiet strength and steady presence amid the chaos of war.\nSayla’s popularity has remained high throughout Gundam’s long history, which now includes nearly 50 official anime productions. Later series and side stories have continued to explore her life both before and after the original series, maintaining strong interest in her character among fans. Notable examples include Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin (2015–2018), which depicts her early years, and Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory (1991–1992), where she briefly appears in a senior Earth Federation role.\nCould Sydney Sweeney Really Be Sayla? Here's Why Some Think So\nSweeney’s Role Is Still A Mystery\nSo why are some betting on Sydney Sweeney stepping into the role of Sayla Mass? For starters, she seems like a strong fit for the character in terms of presence and tone—even if there’s a notable age gap, as Sweeney is 27 while Sayla is canonically 17 when Mobile Suit Gundam begins. Physically, she shares some of Sayla’s key traits, starting with her hair: she’s blonde, much like Sayla herself. And it’s easy to see her in Sayla’s iconic white and pale red Earth Federation uniform.\nRelated\nIf Gundam's Hollywood Movie Wants to Hit, It Needs to Make One Thing Clear\nWith decades of history in the Universal Century, Gundam's live-action film must honor its legacy while reaching new audiences.\nStill, with no confirmed story or setting for the\nLegendary Gundam movie, Sweeney could just as easily be playing a brand-new character. The One Year War might not factor in at all. With so many timelines and stories to draw from, anything’s possible. Either way, fans are curious—and hopeful—to see how Gundam makes the leap to live action and who might join the cast next.\nGundam\nThe Gundam franchise is a cornerstone of mecha anime, featuring giant robots known as \"mobile suits\" in various wartime settings. Originating with Mobile Suit Gundam in 1979, it explores complex themes of war, politics, and humanity through the struggles of pilots who navigate these massive machines. The franchise spans multiple timelines and universes, creating a rich tapestry of interconnected stories and standalone narratives.\n- Created by\n- Yoshiyuki Tomino\n- First TV Show\n-\nMobile Suit Gundam\n- Latest TV Show\n-\nMobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury\n- Character(s)\n-\nAmuro Ray, Char Aznable, Bright Noa, Kamille Bidan, Judau Ashta, Heero Yuy, Kira Yamato, Setsuna F. Seiei\nSummary\nThe Gundam franchise is a cornerstone of mecha anime, featuring giant robots known as \"mobile suits\" in various wartime settings.

    "text": "Key takeaways - Optical computing research aims to produce energy-efficient technologies that use particles of light, called photons, in ways conceptually similar to how electronic computers use electrons. - One obstacle to realizing optical computers is that using photons for nonlinear operations —needed to process information — usually requires high-powered lasers, yet responds slowly or uses photons inefficiently. - A UCLA team has invented a transparent device that offers nonlinear operation under low-power ambient light, and combined it with a smartphone camera for glare reduction — an example of numerous applications this technology could enable. Researchers developing the next generation of computing technology aim to bring some light to the field — literally. Optical computing, which relies on particles of light called photons, is expected to provide alternatives to traditional electronic approaches. Such systems — or light-based components of hybrid systems that also retain electronic parts — could be faster, consume less energy and compute visual information more efficiently through simultaneous, parallel processing. To date, optical computing has faced a limitation in achieving nonlinear responses, which means producing signals not directly proportional to the input. Nonlinearity makes universal computing applications, including artificial intelligence, possible. Nonlinear materials and devices under development need a substantial amount of light to work. Previously, this required high-powered lasers that operate only in a narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum; absorbing light over time, making processing slow; or using energy-inefficient materials that take in lots of light but preclude applications that require light efficiency or transparency. Now, a recent collaborative study from members of the [California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA,](https://cnsi.ucla.edu/) or CNSI, has introduced a device that overcomes these hurdles. In a major step toward optical computing for processing visual information, the CNSI investigators showed that a tiny array of transparent pixels could produce a fast, broadband, nonlinear response from low-power ambient light. The team also demonstrated an application that combines their device with a smartphone camera to reduce glare in images. The study was published in [Nature Communications.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46387-5) \"Optical nonlinearities are far behind what we need for visual computing applications,\" said co-corresponding author Aydogan Ozcan, the Volgenau Professor of Engineering Innovation in the [UCLA Samueli School of Engineering.](https://samueli.ucla.edu/) \"We need low-power, broadband, low-loss and fast nonlinearities for optical systems to meet our visual computing needs. This work helps fill that gap.\" Potential applications for the technology — beyond the glare reduction validated in the study — cross a variety of consumer and industrial uses: improved sensing for autonomous vehicles; cameras that recognize certain objects while hiding others; image encryption; and efficient, effective detection of defects in robotic assembly lines, among many others. The device could offer many advantages. For example, the incoming images could be processed without conversion to a digital signal, speeding results and reducing the amount of data being sent to the cloud for digital processing and storage. The researchers envision linking their technology with cheap cameras and compressing data to produce images with vastly higher resolution than was realized before, and more precisely and accurately capturing useful information about the arrangement of objects in space and the electromagnetic spectra present in the light. \"An inexpensive device measuring a couple of centimeters could make a low-powered camera work like a super-resolution camera,\" said Ozcan, a UCLA professor of electrical and computer engineering and of bioengineering, as well as an associate director at the CNSI. \"That would democratize access to high-resolution imaging and sensing.\" The device in the study is a transparent plane measuring 1 cm square. It uses a 2D semiconductor material — rendered as a film only a few atoms thick — that was developed by co-corresponding author Xiangfeng Duan, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry in the [UCLA College.](https://www.college.ucla.edu/) The thinness of the material makes it transparent, while it retains qualities that enable incoming photons to efficiently regulate electrical conductivity. The research team coupled the 2D semiconductor with a layer of liquid crystal and made it functional with an array of electrodes. The result is a smart filter comprising 10,000 pixels, each able to selectively and quickly darken in a nonlinear way when exposed to broadband ambient light. \"Basically, we want to use a material that does not absorb a lot of light, but still produces sufficient signal that can be used to process the light,\" Duan said. \"Each pixel can change from completely transparent to partially transparent to opaque. It only takes a small number of photons to change the transparency dramatically.\" The research was made possible by the [Elman Family Foundation Innovation Fund](https://cnsi.ucla.edu/elman-fund/) at the CNSI. A grant enabled the recruitment of the study's first author, postdoctoral researcher Dehui Zhang, who advanced the work as part of Ozcan's and Duan's research groups. Zhang, and the project, linked faculty members who had known each other as colleagues for over a decade but hadn't previously explored how they could team up. \"This unique opportunity led to a very, very exciting collaboration,\" Duan said. \"It's really a blast to think outside of our comfort zones. It showed me that, as a material developer, I can benefit from going beyond a fundamental study or proof of concept to explore applications. \"We hope to continue down this road,\" he added. \"This is just the beginning. There's certainly a lot more to do.\" Other co-authors, all affiliated with UCLA, are doctoral students Dong Xu, Yuhang Li, Jingxuan Zhou, Yucheng Zhang, Boxuan Zhou, Peiqi Wang and Ao Zhang; postdoctoral researchers Yi Luo, Jingtian Hu, Xurong Li and Huaying Ren; Bijie Bai, who earned a doctoral degree in 2023; Mona Jarrahi, Northrop Grumman Professor of Electrical Engineering; and Yu Huang, professor and chair of materials science and engineering.
