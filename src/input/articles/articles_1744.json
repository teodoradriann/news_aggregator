    "text": "A Canadian white nationalist who ran over and killed four members of a Muslim family with his pick-up truck was sentenced on Thursday to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years.\nNathaniel Veltman was found guilty of first-degree murder in November. Prosecutors and the presiding judge said the attack was an act of terrorism.\nFive members of the Afzaal family were out for an evening walk in London, Ontario, in June 2021, when Veltman ran them over.\nThe victims were Salman Afzaal, 46, his wife Madiha Salman, 44, their daughter Yumnah, 15, and Mr Afzaal’s mother Talat, 74.\nMr Afzaal and Ms Salman’s nine-year-old son was also seriously wounded in the attack.\nFlag-wrapped coffins are seen outside the Islamic Centre of Southwest Ontario during the funeral for the Afzaal family in June 2021. Reuters\nShortly after the assault, Veltman admitted the killing.\nHe had pleaded not guilty to murder, with his lawyers saying he had mental health challenges. They argued for a lesser charge of manslaughter.\nBut Judge Renee Pomerance said she found the actions “to constitute terrorist activity”, the CBC reported.\nThe attack was the worst against Canadian Muslims since a man shot six people at a Quebec City mosque in 2017.\nAhead of the sentencing, the London Muslim Mosque said the verdict “could be precedent-setting”.\n“If charged, this will be the first time far-right, white nationalism will be treated as and charged with terrorism,” it said in a post on Facebook.\n“It will have large consequences for future trials and is very relevant to the Muslim community across our city and the country.”",

    "title": "Climate Change Increasing Chances Of Temperatures Reaching 40 Degrees Celsius On Holi: Analysis | Climate Change",
    "text": "New Delhi: The probability of temperatures soaring to 40 degrees Celsius around the festival of Holi late March has multiplied due to climate change, according to an analysis of temperature data since 1970. Researchers at the US-based Climate Central, an independent group of scientists, conducted the analysis to place India within the context of global warming trends. In the climate of the early 1970s, it would be exceedingly rare to encounter temperatures in late March above 40 degrees Celsius. Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Bihar had a more than 5 per cent chance of experiencing such temperatures, they said. Also Read: By 2035, Global Warming Could Add Up To 3.2 Percentage Points To Food Inflation Every Year However, the analysis revealed that the chance of reaching 40 degrees Celsius has since expanded to include nine states: Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. Maharashtra now has the highest probability at 14 per cent. To show this change, the researchers calculated the difference between the warming rates in March and April, expressed as the change in average temperature since 1970. The researchers said a total of 37 cities now have at least a 1 per cent chance of experiencing 40 degrees Celsius or warmer temperatures, and 11 cities have a 10 per cent or greater probability. With the exception of Madurai, the 15 cities with the highest risk of experiencing temperatures above 4 degrees Celsius are in central India, the analysis showed. Also Read: Nearly All World’s Population Exposed To Global Warming Over June-September: Study Bilaspur faces the highest risk at 31 per cent, and its chances of reaching 40 degrees Celsius is now 2.5 times higher than in the 1970s. Indore shows the largest change in risk, with an 8 per cent probability, 8.1 times higher than in the past. Madurai and Bhopal also have very large changes (7.1 and 5.5 times higher, respectively) and relatively high overall risk (19 per cent and 12 per cent). Climate Central said March and April are warming across India. Every region considered had net warming during both March and April. During March, the northern and western regions have the fastest warming, with the largest change since 1970 in March occurring in Jammu and Kashmir (2.8 degrees Celsius). Warming is more uniform in April and Mizoram has the largest change since 1970 (1.9 degrees Celsius). Andrew Pershing, VP for Science, Climate Central said, There has been an abrupt transition in the temperatures from cool winter-like temperatures to much warmer conditions now. After the strong warming trend observed in February, March is also likely to follow the same pattern. These warming trends in India are a clear sign of the impacts of human-led climate change. The independent group of scientists and communicators previously said that winters are quickly transitioning into summer-like conditions in north India, shortening the spring season. The average temperatures in states in north India showed either a cooling trend or slight warming in January, followed by strong warming in February. Also Read: Bamboo Cultivation Can Help Madhya Pradesh Tackle Climate Change, Global Warming: Expert This indicates that these regions are now experiencing abrupt transitions from cool winter-like temperatures into much warmer conditions traditionally observed in March, the researchers said. Mahesh Palawat, Vice President- Meteorology and Climate Change, Skymet Weather, said: “There is no denying the fact that climate change is behind the soaring mercury levels. Heatwaves in March were rare but with the increasing global warming, the probability of heatwaves or high temperatures has increased. We will witness similar weather conditions this year as well. This trend will continue in the coming days and we must prepare for an intense summer season ahead.” Global average temperatures have risen by more than 1.1 degrees Celsius since 1850, exacerbating climate impacts, with 2023 being the hottest on record. According to the World Meteorological Organization’s “State of the Global Climate 2023” report, Greenhouse gas levels, surface temperatures, ocean heat and acidification, and sea level rise all reached record highs in 2023. The greenhouse gases spewed into the atmosphere, largely due to the burning of fossil fuels since the start of the Industrial Revolution, is closely tied to it. Climate science says the world needs to slash CO2 emissions by 43 per cent by 2030 to limit the average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the guardrail to prevent worsening of climate impacts. The business-as-usual scenario will take the world to a temperature rise of around 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, scientists have warned. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.) NDTV – Dettol have been working towards a clean and healthy India since 2014 via the Banega Swachh India initiative, which in its Season 10 is helmed by Campaign Ambassador Ayushmann Khurrana. The campaign aims to highlight the inter-dependency of humans and the environment, and of humans on one another with the focus on One Health, One Planet, One Future – Leaving No One Behind. It stresses on the need to take care of, and consider, everyone’s health in India – especially vulnerable communities – the LGBTQ population , indigenous people, India’s different tribes, ethnic and linguistic minorities , people with disabilities, migrants, geographically remote populations, gender and sexual minorities. In a world post COVID-19 pandemic , the need for WASH ( Water , Sanitation and Hygiene ) is reaffirmed as handwashing is one of the ways to prevent Coronavirus infection and other diseases. The campaign will continue to raise awareness on the same along with focussing on the importance of nutrition and healthcare for women and children, fight malnutrition , mental well-being, self-care, science and health, adolescent health & gender awareness . Along with the health of people, the campaign has realised the need to also take care of the health of the eco-system. Our environment is fragile due to human activity, which is not only over-exploiting available resources, but also generating immense pollution as a result of using and extracting those resources. The imbalance has also led to immense biodiversity loss that has caused one of the biggest threats to human survival – climate change. It has now been described as a “ code red for humanity. ” The campaign will continue to cover issues like air pollution , waste management , plastic ban , manual scavenging and sanitation workers and menstrual hygiene . Banega Swasth India will also be taking forward the dream of Swasth Bharat, the campaign feels that only a Swachh or clean India where toilets are used and open defecation free (ODF) status achieved as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014, can eradicate diseases like diahorrea and the country can become a Swasth or healthy India.

    "title": "Las inusuales sanciones a colonos en Cisjordania que agravan el desacuerdo entre EE.UU. e Israel",
    "text": "El presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, ha aprobado sanciones contra cuatro colonos israelíes acusados de atacar a palestinos en la Cisjordania ocupada por Israel. Biden firmó el jueves una orden ejecutiva que autoriza las sanciones y argumenta que la violencia en Cisjordania había alcanzado \"niveles intolerables\". Las sanciones bloquean a las personas señaladas el acceso a toda propiedad y activo en Estados Unidos y al sistema financiero estadounidense. La violencia en Cisjordania ha aumentado desde el ataque de Hamás a Israel el pasado 7 de octubre. Las sanciones marcan un hito en la política de Estados Unidos, que hasta entonces había evitado sancionar a ciudadanos israelíes. La orden ejecutiva establece las bases para la respuesta de Estados Unidos ante posibles ataques en Cisjordania, y va más allá de las restricciones de visas que Washington impuso a varios israelíes el año pasado. La medida se produce mientras Biden Viaja al estado de Michigan, que alberga una gran población árabe-estadounidense crítica con su apoyo a Israel. Según el Instituto Árabe Estadounidense, una asociación proárabe, el respaldo de los árabes estadounidenses al Partido Demócrata ha caído del 59% en 2020 al 17% actual. Y es que el presidente actual ha apoyado la ofensiva militar en Gaza con la que Israel respondió a los ataques de Hamás, lo que podría afectar su popularidad entre los votantes árabes y su intento de ser reelegido en los comicios de noviembre de este año. El jueves, un alto funcionario del Gobierno estadounidense subrayó que el mandatario había expresado constantemente a Israel sus preocupaciones sobre la violencia de los colonos contra los palestinos. \"La situación en Cisjordania, en particular los altos niveles de violencia extremista de los colonos, el desplazamiento forzado de personas y aldeas, y la destrucción de propiedades, ha alcanzado niveles insoportables y constituye una seria amenaza para la paz, la seguridad y la estabilidad\", dijo Biden en la orden. Poco después de que anunciara la medida, Israel expresó su descontento y describió a la mayoría de los colonos de Cisjordania como \"cumplidores de la ley\". \"Israel toma medidas contra todos los infractores en todas partes, y por lo tanto, no hay necesidad de medidas inusuales sobre este tema\", dijo un comunicado de la oficina del primer ministro israelí, Benjamín Netanyahu. La respuesta muestra otro signo de las crecientes diferencias públicas entre Estados Unidos e Israel. Ambos son aliados hace décadas, pero han discrepado en las últimas semanas sobre la idea de crear un estado palestino independiente. Estados Unidos cree que un estado palestino junto a Israel, la conocida como \"solución de dos estados\", es vital para la estabilidad a largo plazo en la región. Netanyahu ha rechazado repetidamente la idea, y la Casa Blanca reconoció el mes pasado que los gobiernos de Estados Unidos e Israel \"ven claramente las cosas de manera diferente\". Estos comentarios han enfriado las esperanzas de que el conflicto en Gaza pudiera empujar de nuevo a los líderes israelíes y palestinos a retomar el camino de la diplomacia y de un nuevo proceso de paz.

    "text": "La plus grande aire marine protégée du Canada voit le jour dans le Pacifique Des Premières Nations et le gouvernement fédéral ont travaillé en collaboration pour concevoir la zone protégée. Photo : Pêches et Océans Canada Des Premières Nations de la Colombie-Britannique et le gouvernement fédéral ont annoncé la création de la plus grande aire marine protégée du Canada, à environ 150 km au large de la côte ouest de l’île de Vancouver. La zone s’étend sur plus de 133 000 kilomètres carrés, une superficie aussi large que celle de la réserve marine des Galapagos. Elle sera cogérée par quatre Premières Nations : Haïda, Nuu-chah-nulth, Pacheedaht et Quatsino. La nouvelle aire marine a d'ailleurs été nommée Tang.ɢwan – ḥačxwiqak – Tsigis, des termes qui renvoient à l’océan profond dans les langues de ces nations. La zone concernée couvre un territoire de plus de 133 000 kilomètres carrés dans l’océan Pacifique. Photo : Pêches et Océans Canada Pêches et Océans Canada indique que le plancher océanique de cette aire marine possède des caractéristiques rares : il renferme au moins 47 monts sous-marins, et la majorité des griffons hydrothermaux connus au Canada. Ces points névralgiques biologiques servent de pouponnière et d’abri à une faune marine remarquablement abondante et diversifiée, selon le ministère fédéral. On fait un pas de géant aujourd’hui pour protéger les océans du Canada, se réjouit la ministre des Pêches, des Océans et de la Garde côtière, Diane Lebouthillier. L'aire marine de Tang.ɢ̱wan - ḥačxwiqak-Tsig̱is est située à environ 150 kilomètres au large de la côte ouest de l’île de Vancouver et à un peu plus de 80 kilomètres au sud‑ouest de Haida Gwaii. Photo : Pêches et Océans Canada Ce secteur a été défini comme zone à protéger en 2017, selon le gouvernement fédéral, et au fur et à mesure, des mesures pour prévenir certaines exploitations de pêche ont été mises en place. C’est en 2023 qu’Ottawa a finalement [signé un protocole d’entente ](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1954383/zone-protection-marine-ile-vancouver-autochtones-entente)avec des Premières Nations de la Colombie-Britannique pour la gestion conjointe de cette nouvelle aire de protection. À lire aussi : Cette désignation conjointe montre que toutes les parties partagent une vision à long terme sur la protection des océans et de conservation de la biodiversité, a écrit le président du conseil de la nation Haïda, dans le communiqué conjoint. Sa communauté a participé à une expédition de recherche sur ces montagnes sous-marines encore peu connues, en 2023, avec le gouvernement fédéral, le réseau de recherche Ocean Networks Canada et l’organisme de protection des océans Oceana Canada. La création de cette nouvelle aire protégée est également saluée par Ocean Networks Canada. Il s'agit d'un élément clef pour s’assurer que les générations futures héritent d’un océan en bonne santé et de communautés côtières prospères, a dit après l'annonce sa présidente, Kate Moran, dans un communiqué. Même son de cloche du côté de l’organisme Oceana Canada. Cette désignation va empêcher la pêche de contact de fond et des déversements dans le secteur, tout en préservant ces forêts sous-marines centenaires, ce qui réjouit l'organisme. Ces monts sous-marins, riches en nutriments, profitent également à des espèces comme des requins et des baleines, à des centaines de mètres au-dessus d'eux, précise-t-il dans une déclaration. Le Canada s’est engagé à protéger 30 % de ses terres et océans d’ici 2030. Grâce à cet ajout, qui représente 2,3 % des eaux canadiennes, ces zones préservées s’étendent désormais à un peu plus de 15 %.

ROMA, Italia.- El Papa Francisco realizó una conmovedora visita este jueves a la cárcel femenina de Roma, donde celebró la misa del Jueves Santo. Desde su silla de ruedas, siguiendo la tradición cristiana, lavó los pies a doce reclusas, emulando el gesto de Jesús con sus discípulos en la Última Cena. Las emociones se desbordaron entre las doce mujeres, muchas de las cuales mostraron signos visibles de emoción y lágrimas al participar en este acto. El Papa, vestido con un mandil blanco, [se desplazó en su silla de ruedas debido a sus problemas de movilidad](https://www.elimparcial.com/mundo/2024/03/16/papa-francisco-renuncia-a-discurso-por-temas-de-salud-utiliza-silla-de-ruedas/) para realizar el lavado y posteriormente besar los pies de las reclusas.
