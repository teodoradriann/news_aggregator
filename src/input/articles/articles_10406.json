    "title": "2024 Ramadan: Joe Biden wishes Muslims ‘Ramzan kareem’, pledges to work non-stop for ceasefire in Gaza | Mint",
    "text": "Greeting Muslims across the world on the start of Ramzan, US President Joe Biden has recognised the suffering of the Palestinian people and pledged to lead international efforts to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza and work non-stop to establish an immediate and sustained ceasefire for at least six weeks there.\nBiden said that more than 30,000 Palestinians were estimated to have been killed during the operation in Gaza, which Israel launched in response to the October 7 attack by Hamas militants that left approximately 1,200 Israelis dead and about 250 taken hostage.\n“Tonight—as the new crescent moon marks the beginning of the Islamic holy month of Ramzan —Jill and I extend our best wishes and prayers to Muslims across our country and around the world,\" Biden wrote in the statement on Sunday.\n“The sacred month is a time for reflection and renewal. This year, it comes at a moment of immense pain. The war in Gaza has inflicted terrible suffering on the Palestinian people,\" he added.\nAs Muslims gather around the world over the coming days and weeks to break their fast, the suffering of the Palestinian people will be front of mind for many, he said.\n\"It is front of mind for me,\" said the US president.\nSome of the Palestinians killed in Gaza “are family members of American Muslims, who are deeply grieving their lost loved ones today,\" Biden said.\nHe also said that nearly 2 million Palestinians are estimated to be displaced and in need of food, water, medicine and shelter.\n“While we get more life-saving aid to Gaza, the United States will continue working non-stop to establish an immediate and sustained ceasefire for at least six weeks as part of a deal that releases hostages.\n\"And we will continue building toward a long-term future of stability, security, and peace. That includes a two-state solution to ensure Palestinians and Israelis share equal measures of freedom, dignity, security, and prosperity. That is the only path toward an enduring peace,\" Biden said.\nThe US will continue to lead international efforts to get more humanitarian assistance into Gaza by land, air, and sea, he said.\n“Earlier this week, I directed our military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments of aid. We are carrying out airdrops of aid, in coordination with our international partners, including Jordan. And we’ll continue to work with Israel to expand deliveries by land, insisting that it facilitate more routes and open more crossings to get more aid to more people,\" Biden said.\nBiden noted that in the US they have seen an \"appalling resurgence\" of hate and violence towards Muslim Americans.\nIslamophobia has absolutely no place in the United States, a country founded on freedom of worship and built on the contributions of immigrants, including Muslim immigrants, Biden said.\n“My administration is developing the first-ever National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination, to take on hate against Muslims, Sikhs, South Asians, and Arab American communities, wherever it occurs. No one should ever fear being targeted at school, at work, on the street, or in their community because of their background or beliefs,\" he said.\n“To Muslims across our country, please know that you are deeply valued members of our American family. To those who are grieving during this time of war, I hear you, I see you, and I pray you find solace in your faith, family, and community. And to all who are marking the beginning of Ramzan tonight, I wish you a safe, healthy, and blessed month. Ramzan kareem,\" Biden said.",

The weather agency has issued 26 flood warnings across the country where the likelihood of residential and commercial properties flooding is considered high. One of those warnings relates to the River Swift in [Rugby](https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/all-about/rugby). It says: \"River levels have risen at the Churchover river gauge as a result of heavy rainfall. Consequently, flooding (of property) remains. Flooding is affecting properties around Leicester Road in Rugby. We expect river levels to remain high until tomorrow afternoon, Saturday, 30/12/23. \"We are closely monitoring the situation. Our incident response staff are actively checking river levels and the weather forecast.

Standing water gathered dangerously on the [Coventry](https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/all-about/coventry) Road between Rugby and Church Lawford. The road underneath the railway bridge close to Church Lawford was said to have been impassable, so deep was the flooding. The Met Office will update its guidance for Rugby at 5pm on Saturday. Storm Gerrit battered the region and the entire country over the last 48 hours, causing a danger to life in parts of Scotland and bringing public transport to a standstill in places. Rugby is not the only [Warwickshire](https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/all-about/warwickshire) town to be affected by the aftermath. The ford in [Kenilworth](https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/all-about/kenilworth), where the B4103 Castle Road crosses Finham Brook, flooded, not for the first time in recent weeks. Water levels there are said to be remain high. Flood alerts have been issued across the county, covering the Gog Brook, near [Warwick](https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/all-about/warwick), the River Alne in Aston Cantlow, the River Arrow and River Alne at Alcester and Oversley Mill. Another alert applied to the River Alne at Bird in Hand, north of Henley-in-Arden, and the River Blythe at nearby Earlswood.

    "text": "Gaza Ceasefire Talks Continue As Hamas Delegation Arrives in Cairo\nGaza Ceasefire Talks Continue As Hamas Delegation Arrives in Cairo Signs of Compromise Emerge in Indirect Talks Hopes of a ceasefire in Gaza rose on Saturday as a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo to continue indirect talks. These talks are believed to be in response to a new proposal to halt fighting for an initial 40 days and exchange hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Sources report signs of compromise in recent days.\nWhile a consensus has been reached on many of the disputed points, both sides remain pessimistic after five months of stop-start talks.\nChallenges Faced in Negotiations The negotiations face challenges as Hamas seeks a lasting ceasefire that would allow the organization to claim victory, while Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, aims to dismantle Hamas, eliminate its leadership, and neutralize its military capabilities.\nIsraeli Official Downplays Prospects for Full Ceasefire An anonymous senior Israeli official played down the prospects for a full end to the war, emphasizing Israel’s commitment to an offensive on Rafah. They stated that Israel would not agree in any circumstance to end the war as part of a hostage-release deal.\nWhile Israel plans to give the truce talks another week, a full-scale offensive in Rafah may be imminent.\nUS Urges Hamas to Accept Ceasefire Deal The United States has been applying pressure on Hamas to accept the latest proposals to avert intensified fighting. Secretary of State Antony Blinken voiced concerns about the potential civilian casualties in the event of a Rafah offensive and stressed the need for a credible protection plan by Israel.\nCalls to Call Off Rafah Attack Increase Various parties, including humanitarian groups, the United Nations, and the WHO director general, have once again urged Israel to call off the planned Rafah attack. Concerns regarding civilian casualties and the impact on an already weakened healthcare system have been expressed.\nDivided Hamas and Israeli Government Hamas, currently divided, is purportedly considering the latest truce proposal. The delegation in Cairo is led by Khalil al-Hayya, the deputy head of the group’s political arm in Gaza, and not a more senior figure. The senior members of Israel’s war cabinet are inclined to secure a ceasefire and free surviving prisoners, while certain far-right ministers advocate for a more forceful continuation of the war.\nAid Efforts Amidst Severe Situations The situation in Gaza remains dire, with the siege pushing its population to famine’s brink. Aid deliveries have slightly improved, with some staple prices approaching pre-war levels. Efforts by organizations like World Central Kitchen and the push for a maritime aid corridor from Cyprus have contributed to addressing the situation. However, the UN’s food program still warns of a full-blown famine in northern Gaza despite the recent improvements.\nPublished on [insert current date]",

    "text": "TULSA, Okla. — Tulsa Police say they have a suspect in custody after the deadly shooting at Woodland Hills Mall on Tuesday. Tulsa Police are looking for the person they say shot and killed someone outside an entrance at Woodland Hills Mall on Tuesday. Deonte Crump was arrested in connection to the homicide, police say. Police said Crump was arrested at a residence he was staying in near 51st and Memorial. They said it took some convincing to get Crump out of the home, where they found \"good evidence.\" Police are investigating this as a homicide after the victim, 21-year-old Kierstan \"KJ\" Love, died at the hospital. FOX23 spoke with Devin Williams who spent several years working in the school system mentoring youth and who says he knew the victim. \"He kind of deescalated problems. He knows how to joke out of them. I know it started with a fight, that's what gets me,\" said Williams. Williams says he can't imagine the pain Love's family is going through as well as anyone who knew him. \"His life has a lot more value than that. All humans have more value than that,\" said Williams. Williams told FOX23 that he is worried about retaliation and is asking anyone close to the situation to keep calm and let police do their work. \"I think about any of his friends or homies who want to retaliate, that hurts me too. Anyone trying to get in trouble for him, he would be the type of kid who would try and make them feel better about the situation,\" said Williams. TPD Capt. Richard Meulenberg says detectives working the case are speaking with witnesses to identify exactly who pulled the trigger. \"There are still things we have to figure out. I cant get too far into suspect information, but we think we might have an apprehension in the near future,\" said Meulenberg. Police said the shooting happened around 6:30 p.m. and several Tulsa Police officers responded to reports of shots in the mall. FOX23 viewers who were in the mall at the time said they were asked to take cover in the stores, and some stores had locked their doors with staff and customers sheltering inside. Tulsa Police said the victim, identified as Love, was taken to the hospital in critical condition. Tulsa Police Lieutenant Brandon Watkins confirmed Love passed away at the hospital around 10:40 p.m. on Tuesday. Police said two people were arguing just outside of the mall, a fight ensued, and the suspect pulled out a gun and shot Love. The suspect ran away from the mall through the parking lot, police said. Police said this was not an active shooter.",

    "title": "Ivar Opens Up About Permanent Nerve Damage In His Hands",
    "text": "WWE World Tag Team Champion Ivar recently appeared on INSIGHT with Chris Van Vliet, where he opened up about his near-career-ending neck injury, the challenging recovery process, and how he’s managing his quality of life today.\nIvar and his tag team partner, Erik, captured the World Tag Team Titles on the December 16th episode of WWE Raw, marking a triumphant return for Ivar after a severe neck injury.\nRecalling the start of his troubles, Ivar explained, “So it started in Brooklyn before WrestleMania. Me and Ricochet had a match. I took a European uppercut and I was like, whoa. Did a system check. I’m like, I’m okay. I’m alright. Then after that, I was doing Main Event, Raw, NXT, NXT Coconut shows. I was doing some SmackDown, Dark stuff. I was just on everything. Then it got to that match with Oba Femi for the North American Championship in NXT. We got to the second half of that match, and I just lost all strength in my right arm. I couldn’t pick him up, so I just started calling audibles in the ring where I wasn’t going to pick him up. We made it through the match, and that was that. The whole time we were checking on medical to see how I was doing.”\nDespite trying to push through, Ivar realized he needed to address the issue. After a break and a concerning MRI, doctors initially delivered devastating news. “They read the results, and like, okay. This is probably the end of your career, to the point where they handed me mental health paperwork to kind of get that rolling because I already had the double fusion of my neck. So if we’re talking about another level fusion, because the MRI showed I had another herniated disc in my neck, the level above. So I had two levels, C5, 6, and 7, they’re all fused together. This was C4 and 5, so the one directly above. Another fusion would probably be the end of my career. So yeah, they were there preparing me for the worst when I went to see my surgeon.”\nWhen his surgeon reviewed the MRI personally, there was a glimmer of hope. “My surgeon had read the result in the MRI, and he pretty much felt the same way that this was it. So for five days, I’m thinking this is it. It’s over with. I flew close to the sun and the wings melted. When I saw him in Birmingham five days later, and he actually had the disc for the MRI, he read the results for the MRI himself. He’s like, ‘Okay, we can work with this.’”\nIvar was able to recover his neck without surgery and has since returned to the ring. He is now the WWE World Tag Team Champion once again.\n“So I’m pretty good now,” Ivar said. “To be fair, I do have permanent nerve damage and nerve pain in my hands, and that will never go away. That’s something I live with, but as far as everything else, I got most of my mobility back to my neck. It’s a little stiff now because I have another herniation, but I still have a very good range of motion. I credit that to yoga, pretty much. All my strength has returned to my arm, so I have no problems there, so it’s really just the nerve pain right now from the original injury that I have that’s permanent. I have good days and bad days. Some days I can really feel it. It goes down my arm a little bit, and some days I can’t feel it. It all kind of all depends, but quality of life, I feel pretty good.”\nIvar’s story is one of resilience and determination, culminating in his triumphant return to WWE and his reclaiming of championship gold.\nYou can check out the complete interview below:",

Instead, they smashed the window and climbed out, grabbing onto a pillar to stay above the torrent.\n“This was our pole right here,” he said, pointing. He said they climbed higher on the pillar as the water and waves rose.\nHis neighbors were also hanging on a pillar as several feet of water surged, sweeping away appliances, trees, vehicles and chunks of debris. At one point, Jones said he saw propane tanks explode nearby.\nThe flooding destroyed Jones’ apartment, but he’s salvaging what little he can. Among the most treasured items he recovered were two photos of him and his daughter, some sports memorabilia, and his Marine Corps flag, which remarkably remained flying on a pillar through the storm.\n“It’s horrible,” he said.\nEven as Jones grieves the loss of his home, he realizes his neighbors and people in nearby communities have lost more, with the death toll continuing to rise in Kerr County.",

    "text": "Big Tech firms are racing to develop custom chips that supercharge the efficiency and cut costs of artificial intelligence (AI). Meta has launched its latest generation of custom computer chips to enhance its AI capabilities and minimize dependency on external suppliers like Nvidia . This announcement follows Intel’s reveal of an improved AI “accelerator” and comes as competitors such as Google also move toward in-house AI chip development. Experts said AI chips could boost commercial applications. “From the business point of view, it lowers the bar for training per-customer, per-task models and moves away from just consuming APIs from providers of large language models for specialized and high-security use cases,” Amrit Jassal , the co-founder and chief technology officer of Egnyte , which makes AI-powered software for businesses, told PYMNTS. Custom chips may reduce AI costs for businesses. The current price of integrating generative AI into a business can vary significantly , from a few hundred dollars a month to several hundred thousand dollars for a custom solution based on a fine-tuned open-source model, according to software development firm Itrex . Last year, Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang said that custom AI chips could reduce the expenses associated with generative AI. Competition is intensifying in the AI chip market as companies vie for a share of this rapidly expanding industry. On Tuesday (April 9), Intel introduced its new AI chip, the Gaudi 3 , amid a competitive rush by chipmakers to develop semiconductors capable of training and deploying large AI models, such as those that power OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Intel said the Gaudi 3 chip offers more than double the power efficiency and can process AI models one-and-a-half times faster than Nvidia’s H100 GPU. It is available in various configurations, including a set of eight Gaudi 3 chips on a single motherboard or as a standalone card that can be integrated into existing systems. The chip was tested on models such as Meta’s open-source Llama. Intel highlighted that the Gaudi 3 is adept at training or deploying models, including Stable Diffusion for image generation and OpenAI’s Whisper for speech recognition. Meta unveiled the latest version of its custom chips designed specifically for artificial intelligence tasks in a Wednesday (April 10) blog post . The new chip iteration shows significant performance enhancements over its predecessor. According to the tech giant, it supports Meta’s algorithms for ranking and recommending ads on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. “For users, I expect the change to appear in better personalization, reduced latency of responses, and in improved local processing in products such as Meta glasses,” Jassal said. PC manufacturers are also starting to use AI-specific chips for their products. According to a Bloomberg report on Thursday (April 11), Apple is close to starting production on its M4 computer processors, which will feature AI processing capabilities. The company plans to equip every Mac model with these new processors. The primary benefit of AI-specific chips is financial, Rodolfo Rosini , CEO of Vaire , a company using reversible computing to create low-energy silicon chips, told PYMNTS. He said that it costs $500 in materials for Nvidia to make chips, which they sell for $30,000, and even then, there is a massive line to get an allocation. “Beyond a certain scale, it makes sense for vendors to make their own chips,” he said. “On top of it, they can be tailored to their specific workloads and algorithms.” Meta is in the unique position that most of their products are free, so in order to roll out powerful tools like large language models to their userbase, they need to drive down the cost of AI, Rosini said. “This is why the other AI tools today are asking $25/month or so to operate,” he added. “Having their own infrastructure could allow Meta to deploy this for free.” Custom AI chips provide significant benefits, such as enhanced privacy and proprietary data control, allowing companies to steer their own AI futures, Michal Oglodek , the chief technology officer and co-founder of the generative AI company Ivy.ai , told PYMNTS. “With the field becoming increasingly crowded, expect a surge of contenders as AI solutions and providers proliferate rapidly,” he added. “While slow and steady typically wins the race, results from Nvidia and soon Intel show that there is little time to lose. The frontrunners are tackling the AI frenzy from all sides.”",
