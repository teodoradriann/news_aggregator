    "text": "A volcanologist says a new artificial intelligence (AI) volcano forecasting tool, with the potential to save lives around the world, is still some way off being rolled out in places like Tonga.\nIt uses data from well-monitored volcanoes and applies it to under-monitored sites.\nAuckland University volcanology professor Shane Cronin, who has worked at the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai disaster site, said there are around 80 major volcanoes in the southwestern Pacific, many of which are not well-monitored.\n\"At the moment...with Tonga developing new senses, developing new network, it's kind of still baby steps,\" he said.\n\"It's still developing the basics, measuring and recording the basics, and then I think a few years down the track, we'll be able to apply these more advanced methods.\"\nHe said in New Zealand, it is set up to monitor seismic activity in real-time pretty well, with seismographs, GPS sensors, and infrasound sensors.\n\"Whereas in the Pacific, the volcanoes that we can monitor in real-time, there's only a handful of them, and they are mainly in Vanuatu.\n\"We have a few new systems set up in Tonga now, but they're still nowhere near as as comprehensive as the monitoring systems we have in New Zealand.\"\nCronin said these kinds of tools \"help us see things that we might not otherwise see\".\nHe said once the AI tool picks something up, they can then bring in a human scientist.\n\"What we can do is then hone in on things and say, hey, there's something strange there, and then put a pair of human eyes on that, and put in the volcanological expertise.\n\"Anything that we can develop in the terms of AI software, types of approaches that are labour-saving approaches, or kind of pre-filtering and pre-screening approaches can be really, really helpful for countries without volcano scientists.\n\"Tonga, for example, where you have a small number of scientists in their group, and not many, one or two have been trained in volcano seismology and there aren't many that have very deep, in-depth training.\n\"We have people trained at masters level, but we don't have that many PhD level trained people in the South West Pacific, around the volcano monitoring.\n\"So any kind of tools that we have that help to automatically process signals and raise awareness about volcanoes that might be pressurizing towards eruption, I think is there's a great deal of assistance.\"\nThe programme was developed in response to Aotearoa's Whakaari/White Island tragedy where 22 people were killed and 45 injured.\nEngineer Dr Alberto Ardid said the system was being developed \"to help us to identify in real time and prevent what happened on Whakaari\".\nArdid said the AI tool was fed 20 years' worth of seismic data recorded from 41 volcanic eruptions across the globe including from Whakaari, Tongariro, and Ruapehu in New Zealand.\nHe said the seismic tools were the same as those used to measure earthquakes, but near a volcano the recorded shaking typically related to subsurface volcanic activity such as magma movement, which could be a precursor to an eruption.",

The paper was launching a monthly regional magazine targeting owners of luxury homes — think Laguna and Newport Beach — and he wanted a column that would be the antidote to potentially pretentious content.\n“So,” I said, “you want a column that is not about rich homeowners and their chichi architects and their museum-quality art collections and the exquisite homes they build on the bluffs overlooking the Pacific and how the whole experience was one giant lovefest, and they had money left over?”\n“Right,” he confirmed, “a reality column.”\nHe’d found the right writer. At that point, I had built two homes from the ground up, had the debt and cortisol levels to prove it, and had an arsenal of frustrations.\nStill disbelieving, I added, “You want me to write about the tile mason with the drinking problem, the neighbors who won’t speak to you because you’ve had an outhouse and a Dumpster parked in your front yard for three months, the dogs who got so fed up with the construction they ran away in search of a rescue, and about how the remodel took three times as long, cost three times as much, and you weren’t speaking to your spouse at the end?”\n“Exactly,” he said. “Sprinkle in some advice. Be the girl next door who has the same problems as everyone else but is two steps ahead, because you’ve made the mistakes and know who to call.”\nEighteen months later, my then-husband and I moved from Southern California to Colorado — just one of my many moves. And soon, I had a syndicated column. That former editor congratulated me, then ominously added: “It’s great to have a weekly column, but one day, you are going to run out of ideas.”\nUntil then, a dry well hadn’t been on my worry list. I flashed back to when I was in kindergarten and got in trouble for talking too much in class. I wound up in the principal’s office with my mother to discuss “the problem.” When the principal asked why I talked so much, the answer was easy. “I just have so many important things to say,” I said, which was unintentionally hilarious.\nSo here we are 20 years and 1,040 columns later, and I still have things to say and no shortage of topics. Because I have never been able to see where home design stops and home life begins, my columns are about both. Here’s a brief look back at some of the moments we’ve been through together:\nThe calamities: You were there when my two custom seven-foot sofas arrived with the upholstery fabric inside out, when the back patio in our new Colorado home fell three feet into a sink hole, and when our rescue dog on his first night with us tested our commitment on the one-day-old living room carpet. (Who gets a new dog and new carpet on the same day?)\nThe many moves: You were there through 10 houses and nine moves, including the move to Florida, where I had a stint as a live-in home stager and moved six times in four years.\nThe life changes: You were there when I sent each of my children off to college, entering some sort of self-imposed dorm-decorating contest in which I was the sole contestant. You were there through my divorce and remarriage, the loss of two parents and the gain of three grown stepchildren.\nThe micro and macro: Together, we’ve covered the minor (how to choose drawer knobs and tea towels) and the major (the meaning of home and belonging and how to leave a meaningful legacy.

    "title": "Wales boss Rob Page backs Tom Lockyer in urging people to learn CPR",
    "text": "Wales boss Rob Page has backed Tom Lockyer’s calls for people to learn CPR after his squad acquired lifesaving skills three months before their team-mate collapsed. Lockyer suffered a cardiac arrest during Luton’s Premier League game at Bournemouth in December and his heart stopped for two minutes and 40 seconds. The 29-year-old was saved as medics rushed to perform CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) and provide early defibrillation. Wales defender Lockyer has since supported the British Heart Foundation’s campaign for people to learn CPR skills, as well as raise funds for lifesaving research. “The medical team came in and we did the class,” Page said of his squad undertaking a CPR and defibrillator training course in September that would take on special significance three months later. “Tom is championing it at the minute, and rightly so. “It just shows that there’s more to life than football.” Lockyer returned to the scene of his on-pitch cardiac arrest on Wednesday for Luton’s re-arranged meeting with Bournemouth. Basic Life Support and AED training could help you save a life one day. Our Cymru squad have done the training. Find out more about how you can get involved 👇 [@savealifecymru]| [#TogetherStronger] — Wales 🏴 (@Cymru) [September 8, 2023] The 16-times capped central defender met medics who helped save his life and admitted that he “got a little bit emotional”, while describing them as “heroes”. Lockyer has since been fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator and conceded it is “out of his hands” if he will ever play again. But he will be part of Wales’ preparations next week as they bid to qualify for Euro 2024 and a third successive European Championship. Wales host Finland in a play-off semi-final in Cardiff next Thursday, with the winners at home to Estonia or Poland five days later to decide a place in Germany this summer. Page said: “I’ve had a good conversation with Locks and he’ll be a part of it. We don’t know what days or for how long yet. Locks and some of his heroes 🧡 [pic.twitter.com/Lrvs96ECc5] — Luton Town FC (@LutonTown) [March 13, 2024] “But he’s keen to come in and we’re keen to have him around the lads. “I can only imagine how hard it was for Meps (Chris Mepham), Kieffer (Moore) and Brooksy (David Brooks) when they played that fixture and saw their mate on the floor like he was. “I can only imagine how hard it would have been for them. “They’ve had contact straight after and they’ve been in touch since, but it’ll be nice to have them all back in the group together. “Forget football, just being together as good mates is powerful for them.”",
