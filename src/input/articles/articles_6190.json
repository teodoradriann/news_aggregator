    "text": "A paramilitary group at war with Sudan's military endorses a cease-fire during holy fasting month [PTI](/pti-stories)| Cairo | Updated: 09-03-2024 22:59 IST | Created: 09-03-2024 22:59 IST - Country: - Egypt A Sudanese paramilitary group battling the country's military in a nearly yearlong ruinous conflict endorsed on Saturday a resolution by the UN Security Council calling for a cease-fire during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The group, known as the Rapid Support Forces, said in a statement that it hopes the resolution, adopted by the UN Security Council on Friday, would help deliver crucially needed humanitarian assistance to millions of Sudanese trapped in the fighting across the Northeastern African country. Ramadan, during which adult Muslims are required to fast from dawn to sunset, is expected to start on or around Monday, depending on the sighting of the crescent moon. The RSF said it views the initiative as a \"crucial opportunity\" for the warring parties to embark on negotiations to find a political settlement to the conflict. \"We view this as a crucial opportunity to initiate earnest discussions that could catalyse a political pathway. This pathway must culminate in a durable ceasefire, foster security and stability, and result in a substantive resolution that addresses the foundational issues of the historical crisis in Sudan,\" it said. Sudan's military has already supported a call by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for a Ramadan cease-fire. In his Thursday appeal, Guterres warned on Thursday that the conflict threatens Sudan's unity and \"could ignite regional instability of dramatic proportions.\" Sudan plunged into chaos in April last year, when long-simmering tensions between its military, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo broke into street battles in the capital, Khartoum. The fighting broke out during Ramadan last year. Fighting spread to other parts of the country, especially urban areas, but in Sudan's western Darfur region it took on a different form, with brutal attacks by the Arab-dominated Rapid Support Forces on ethnic African civilians. Thousands of people have been killed. The 15-member Security Council voted overwhelmingly in favour of the British-drafted cease-fire resolution, with 14 countries in support and only Russia abstaining. The resolution expressed \"grave concern over the spreading violence and the catastrophic and deteriorating humanitarian situation, including crisis levels, or worse, of acute food insecurity, particularly in Darfur.\" The head of the World Food Program, Cindy McCain, said earlier this week that the conflict risks creating the world's largest hunger crisis, with some 18 million people across Sudan facing acute hunger, including 5 million who face starvation. The conflict has uprooted more than 10 million people either to safer areas inside Sudan or to neighbouring countries, according to UN agencies. South Sudan received 600,000 people who fled the fighting in Sudan. (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

    "text": "Craig Mazin Says THE LAST OF US Season 2 is Their EMPIRE STRIKES BACK Story and Talks GAME OF THRONES Influence\nWhen The Last of Us premiered on HBO, it was a carefully crafted gamble that was beautifully made and emotionally resonant. It had every chance to fail and instead became one of the best shows on TV.\nBut according to co-creator Craig Mazin, Season 2 will be different. Sharper. Meaner. Bigger. And more importantly, it’s their Empire Strikes Back story.\nSeason 2 of The Last of Us expands its world dramatically. “There’s a larger main cast, far better special effects, more epic action sequences and so much going on that hasn’t even being hinted at yet,” Mazin explains.\nThe show is only seven episodes this time, but there’s no shortage of story.\nAnd yes, those Empire Strikes Back vibes in the trailer are not a coincidence. When asked about it in an intercview with THR, Mazon said: “It’s true,” Mazin says. “They aren’t getting away with shit.”\nHe continued: “I think about that a lot — because I love The Empire Strikes Back, and I think everybody should. We love that one because the second act is the tough act.\n“That’s when everything is challenged and characters go through these moments where they can’t be who they used to be, but they’re also not ready to be who they’re supposed to be. There’s a sense of feeling lost. And I love that.”\nMazin’s also looking at how the action serves the story, specifically drawing influence from Game of Thrones, and more precisely, one of its most unforgettable episodes.\n“Certainly as a Thrones fanatic, I remember from watching Hardhome and not thinking about how complicated and impressive the action was. What I remembered was how moving and important the things that were happening inside the action were.\n“That Wildling woman [Karsi], seeing her get turned, and seeing The Night King raise the dead and being like, ‘Hey, you and me, Jon Snow, we’re on a collision course, my friend, and the more you fight me, the worse it gets for you.’ The desperation, the total loss.”\nMazin says that kind of emotional gravity is the north star for The Last of Us’ approach to its action sequences this season.\nThat is really our philosophy about action. What’s the point? So in building this sequence, we were very ambitious because we just wanted to show how bad it could get. But always the question was: Why? What is this about, what does this change, and what does this mean for our people moving forward?\n“Jackson is, as we see in episode one, is growing, it’s expanding. There is a certain cockiness. They don’t seem particularly worried about the trouble outside. They’ve gotten a little complacent.\n“They have a New Year’s Eve dance. They’re going to therapy,. They’re refurbishing homes. They’ve got patrols down to a science. On the other hand, you’re like: Guys don’t you know you’re living in a TV show?”\nSeason 1 was a road trip through hell that kept its heart. Season 2 sounds like the gloves are off. The world is colder, the stakes are higher, and no one’s safe, not even the ones who think they’ve figured it all out.\nGeekTyrant Homepage",

    "text": "Hundreds of Jewish people and supporters from “Sussex to Jerusalem” have joined to blow shofars and whistles in a call to free Israeli hostages.\nOne group met at St John’s Wood Synagogue in London on Sunday – led by TV presenter Vanessa Feltz and actress Dame Maureen Lipman.\nIt was said to be the world’s largest ram horn trumpet chorus. Get The Jewish News Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\nThey were there to show solidarity with the more than 100 hostages held in Gaza.\nThe chorus lasted for 1.55 minutes, marking the 155 days they will have been in captivity.\nMarcel Knobil, who organised the chorus, said the shofars and whistles were blown from “Sussex to Jerusalem and from New York to the beaches of Thailand”.\nHe said: “The shofar is such a significant icon. It’s said to symbolise a number of things, some equate it with a sound of crying mothers and how appropriate that is to today’s event, especially being Mother’s Day.\n“It’s also said to represent hope and we are all bursting with hope for the release of the hostages.\nMaureen Lipman and Vanessa Feltz blow their horns – Jews and sympathisers blow shofars (ram’s horns of spiritual significance) and whistles, led by Vanessa Feltz, Mike Freer MP and Dame Maureen Lipman at a Synagogue near Abbey Road, London. “Many of us equate its wailing sound as a wake-up call. Waking us to address ourselves internally and stirring us to mend our way.”\nMr Knobil added that he has spent time with families of hostages and said they are in “total shock”.\nHe said: “They are living in an unreal world. To see this terror and torment to be lifted from all these family members would be just a dream for me and the world Jewish community.”\nFeltz said they were all there to trumpet “this humanitarian urgent message – bring them home now”.\nShe said: “Today, our hearts are joined to the hearts and the souls of the mothers of the hostages, just imagine being there, it’s just unbearable to think about it even one day.\n“Imagine it, the mothers of the hostages who’ve been deprived their precious children now for 155 days.\n“As we celebrate Mother’s Day with our beloved children, our beloved grandchildren, these mothers are in agonising torment.”\nDame Maureen said: “I’m a mother, I’m an actor, I’m an aunt, I’m a grandmother, and since October 7 I’m a hostage like every other Jew in the world.\n“A hostage who shares that pain, that fear, that someone is coming, that childhood fear made real.\n“I want to urge you to write this on your doorposts and tell your children we have to fight back.”\nShe called for people to “fight back professionally” against “the opposition”, who she described as “campus twits” and “marching fools, who don’t know which river or which sea they’re talking about”.\nSpeaking to the PA news agency, Dame Maureen became emotional as she said “right will prevail” if the hostages were released, adding: “Except how many of those girls, how many of those grandmothers, are ever going to face the beauty of life again?”\nConservative MP Mike Freer, for Finchley & Golders Green, spoke before the chorus and said “as a non-Jew, to the Jewish community, you have friends, you are not alone”.\nHe said: “When we see mob rule on the streets of London, remember there are friends in Parliament that are seeking to curtail the hysteria that we see.”\nIt comes after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7 in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 kidnapped before Israel retaliated with months of attacks on the Gaza Strip, killing and wounding thousands.\nSupport your Jewish community.

    "text": "Amazon workers plan to stage strikes and protests in multiple countries across the Asia-Pacific region Nov. 29-Dec. 2, from Black Friday to Cyber Monday. The employees are denouncing low wages and lack of labor union representation. Organizers announced strikes and protests at Amazon facilities in the following locations: Australia: Newcastle, Sydney, Canberra, and Brisbane Bangladesh: Dhaka and Chattogram India: Multiple locations including Mumbai, New Delhi, and Kolkata Japan: Tokyo Malaysia: Kuching Philippines: Manila Additional related strikes and demonstrations are possible in other countries across the region. Gathering sites include outside Amazon offices, government buildings, public venues, and thoroughfares. Authorities will likely monitor any demonstration that occurs, dispersing any disruptive crowds. Localized transport disruptions are likely, especially if demonstrators march or block roads. Isolated scuffles between police and protestors cannot be ruled out. Associated business disruptions are possible. Avoid all demonstrations as a precaution. Plan for extra travel time near protest sites. Heed instructions from authorities.",
