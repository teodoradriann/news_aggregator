    "title": "After a strong Open finish, Billy Horschel unfortunately withdraws from 3M Open",
    "text": "Billy Horschel was one of the many names fans had their eyes on for this week’s 3M Open. He was one of the first players to arrive on Monday after his incredible Open Championship performance in Scotland. However, he withdrew from the event before his tee time on Thursday, allowing Adam Long to enter the field. After his announcement, the former Florida Gator explained why he had to withdraw from the tournament. “I wasn’t feeling great late last night and took some medicine,” Horschel said in an official announcement Thursday. “Decent sleep but woke up and have a fever, the body is just not wanting to respond; every muscle feels like it’s locked up. Tried to do a little warmup in the gym, just didn’t respond.” “Tried to go out to the golf course and hit some balls — the body’s not wanting to cooperate. Disappointing. I was looking forward to playing here at 3M. Played here last year and had a good finish. The event is well run by 3M and Tracy and Hollis, so very disappointed not to be able to play here after coming off a really great finish last week.” He also posted to his X, formerly known as Twitter, why he pulled out. Last year, Horschel finished T13 in his first start at this event. He spoke with the media Wednesday and hinted at feeling a touch different but chalked it up to travel. “I felt pretty good for the last couple of days. This morning I woke up and I was a little tired, body was moving a little bit slower, but that’s expected,” Horschel said Wednesday ahead of his withdrawal. “You travel halfway around the world, and you played the last couple of weeks over in Scotland — Any of the guys coming over from there are going to feel the same thing.” Horschel sits No. 26 in the FedEx Cup standings, so he did not necessarily need the points in Minnesota, but he loves this event. He values the family atmosphere and likes the way the golf course plays. Hopefully, he will feel better for the PGA Tour’s final regular-season event, the Wyndham Championship. However, it is uncertain if Horschel has committed to playing. Savannah Leigh Richardson is a golf staff writer for SB Nation’s Playing Through.

    "text": "Facing deportation or returning to Guatemala\nPreparing to return to Guatemala\nYou and your family may have to return to Guatemala, either voluntarily or due to deportation. If you face this possibility, plan ahead so that the process can be as simple and safe as possible for you and your family.\nBreathe. Know that your family and community are holding you in their thoughts and prayers and it is your own inner strength that will get you through this difficult transition. Take good care.\nBefore you leave the U.S.\nIf you have time:\n1. Contact the Guatemalan Consulate in Denver and make an appointment by phone 303-629-9210 or online at\nhttp://www.consdenver.minex.gob.gt/Home/Home.aspx (if the link does not open, search for “Guatemalan consulate” on the internet) to get passports for you and your family members and other information for reentry.\n2. Sign and give a Power of Attorney to someone you trust in the U.S. so that this person (your representative) can take care of your financial affairs for you after you leave.\n3. Take care of your finances. Sell or transfer your real estate. Use banks to transfer funds from the U.S. to Guatemala.\n4. Make arrangements for where you will go in Guatemala. Let your representative know how to contact you there.\n5. Finish your family preparedness plan\nhttp://coloradoimmigrant.org/preparados. Tell your Power of Attorney where it is. Keep all your documents safe.\n6. Avoid notarios!\n7. Dual citizenship between the U.S. and Guatemala does not exist. Check with the Guatemalan Consulate regarding citizenship questions. Minor U.S. citizen children traveling to Guatemala should have a U.S. passport and a notarized consent form from the other parent or legal guardian permitting their travel.\n8. Read the consulate website so you know what documents to bring.\n9. Collect other documents for you and all children, such as school records and/or diplomas (notarized by school registrar), immunization records, and U.S. birth certificates.\n10. Collect medical records; medications; marriage, divorce, and/or death certificates for every family member.\n11. If family members travel separately, make sure that you sign an authorization letter for the adult caregiver who will be travelling with your minor children.\n12. If a child will remain in the U.S. (even for a short time) in the care of a non-parent, sign a Power of Attorney authorizing the caregiver to care for your child.\nTip: Two last names (father’s last name, mother’s last name) may be required on all official documents. Be consistent in providing names.\nTip: Get more than one original birth certificate for each child because they may be needed.\nWarning: Keep in mind that buying false Guatemalan birth certificates is prohibited.\nImmediate deportation\nConsider using the emergency notification app called Notifica to keep your family informed and aware. Many people use WhatsApp to communicate internationally (you need Wifi to use it).\n- While in GEO ICE Processing Center in Aurora, Colorado:\n- Family/friends may visit you if they have a valid passport or unmarked license. They should call GEO (303-361-6612) to get your visiting days and hours and instructions for visiting.\n- Family/friends can put money on your phone account at\nwww.talton.comor 1-866-348-6231 using the detainee’s A#.\n- Leaving GEO in Aurora, Colorado:\n- You have the right to retrieve any clothing or possessions that you entered GEO with, such as your wallet, credit cards, and phone. Family/friends can also bring you “one of everything,” i.e. one pair of pants, underwear, bra, socks, shoes, one short-sleeve shirt, one long-sleeve shirt, coat, gloves, and hat.\n- If you have medicine approved and given by a GEO doctor, you can take it with you. This includes insulin and inhalers. If you can bring a written prescription from a doctor, that can be helpful.\n- If you can bring a credit card or between $200 to $500 in small bills, it will be helpful. Put the money in different pockets on your person, not in your bag. If you have money on account from the commissary, phone, or work, you will be given up to $500 in cash. If you have more than $500, you will receive a check, which can be hard to cash later.\n- Detainees are not given much advance notice of their departure date to avoid “incidents” during transport.\nNOTE: This is how it is supposed to happen, but be prepared that you may not be able to bring all of these things.\nWHAT TO BRING WITH YOU\nThe following items can often be brought by family/friends to GEO. They must bring a photo ID to drop off items:\n- Phone numbers for friends or family, both in Guatemala and in the U.S. (You should memorize them before leaving the U.S.).\n- Phone card, phone charger, and a backup phone battery.\n- Have an address in Guatemala. Many forms and job applications often ask for an address. Get an address of a family member that you can use.\n- Medications and written prescriptions in your name, such as insulin; what you need to keep it cool; inhalers. If you are diabetic, you may be able to bring a PowerBar or something similar.\n- Driver’s license or ID from any Guatemalan city or institution, like a voting card.\nWhat to expect from ICE transport\n- If you have an ankle monitor, you may have to get it removed prior to departure.\n- You may be handcuffed and shackled at the ankles during transit.\n- Your possessions may not be intact or returned to you at all.\n- You may travel by bus to Florence, Arizona or another location in the U.S. and then be put on a plane to Guatemala City.\n- You may experience dehumanizing behavior from ICE officials. If you can remember their name or get their badge number, it could be helpful in the future or for others.*\n*ICE does not respect your human dignity, but we do. Others you will find in Guatemala through this list will also treat you well and support you as much as they can.\nWhen you arrive in Guatemala\nGeneral Cautions:\n- To stay safe, make a friend on the bus or plane. Stay together to support each other.\n- Be alert and calm. Blend in and comply with authority.\n- Avoid casual street encounters, including eye contact.\n- Don’t look vulnerable, but also don’t look cocky.\n- Be prepared for bribes. Have $40 to $100 in cash in $10s and $20s, and keep them in different pockets.\n- Beware of criminal elements. Don’t use an offered cell phone to call your family. Create a “palabra clave” or code word with family members in case someone calls asking for ransom. You should decide what you want your family to do if you are speaking to them under duress.\n- Keep contact information for your family in El Salvador (and all documents that prove your identity and deportation status) on you, not in your bag.\nCautions for Guatemala\n- Keep your money/valuables as secure as possible.\n- Avoid public ATMs, where credit card scams tend to happen.\n- Conceal valuable items such as smartphones.\n- Be careful when walking in Guatemala City and on buses, which are frequently subject to armed robberies.\n- Understand that members of MS-13 and Calle 18 gangs and Mexican drug trafficking organizations operate throughout Guatemala.\nRepatriation\nPeople are transported to Guatemala from several detention centers in the U.S. Those deported from Denver generally depart on flights from Florence, Arizona. They arrive at the La Aurora Air Force base next to the La Aurora International Airport in Guatemala City.\nWhen deportees, both adults and minors, arrive in the Salón Migratorio at the Air Force Base, they are given refreshments and are officially received by representatives of Dirección General de Migración (General Agency on Migration, DGM).\nADULTS\nAdults get a free phone call and can exchange currency. After, they are taken to the bus terminal and are given a bus ticket to their hometown.\nRepresentatives from the Pastoral de Movilidad Humana may be at the airport to meet returnees. They can arrange transportation to Casa del Migrante, which provides services to returnees. Representatives from the Association of Returned Guatemalans (ARG) may also be at the airport. See descriptions below.\nUNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN\nUnaccompanied children are briefly interviewed by Secretaría de Bienestar (SBS) staff. After, they are taken to Nuestras Raíces in Guatemala City, where they. are given something to eat, a basic medical examination, and a clean change of clothes. A psychologist and social worker are there to conduct interviews to determine if there is a case (of abuse, trafficking, etc.) that needs to be referred to another agency. If this is the case, the case is reported to the Procudaría General de la Nación (PGN) of Guatemala, which contacts the proper agency.\n(Source: “The Realities of Returning Home: Youth Repatriation in Guatemala,” The Wilson Center, June 2015)\nNonprofit organizations providing assistance\nCasa del Migrante—Guatemala\n15 Ave. 1-94 \"A\" Zona 1, Ciudad de Guatemala, Guatemala\n(502) 2230 2781\nPeople can stay at Casa del Migrante for up to two weeks depending upon available space. They welcome returnees from 7 a.m. - 10 p.m.\nGuests cannot stay in the shelter during the day. They need to look for work (even short term) in order to be able to pay for some expenses of the rest of their travels.\nAll guests need to register and provide personal information. A photo is taken. If someone was the victim of abuse by the authorities, delinquents or organized crime, they can denounce this anonymously if they want. The registration is useful if family has lost track of someone and comes to the Casa del Migrante to find out if their family member has stayed there.\nOrientation about:\n- The dangers of vandalism, crime (assaults, beatings, abuse and sexual aggressions), attacks by organized crime including extortion, kidnapping, human trafficking\n- How to protect oneself from criminals and from sexually transmitted diseases\n- The orientation is required as is the completion of specific activities\nTypes of assistance available:\n- Accommodations, meals, access to showers, clean clothing and laundry\n- Personal hygiene products, basic medicines\n- A short long-distance call if needed to communicate with family\nThe Association of Returned Guatemalans (ARG)\nOn Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ARG-ong-257316458010435/\nThe Association of Returned Guatemalans (ARG) meets returnees in the Salón Migratorio at the airport.\nServices offered:\n- Local and international phone calls\n- General orientation for return to their places of origin\n- Help to locate shelters or hotels if required\n- Other services to mitigate the process of return",

    "text": "In the coming months, Long Beach will see a new crop of restaurant expansions by notable LA operators. That includes [Telefèric Barcelona](https://la.eater.com/2023/2/15/23600355/teleferic-spanish-barcelona-brentwood-restaurant-opening-new-photos-inside-menu), [Sonoratown](https://la.eater.com/2022/5/23/23138367/sonoratown-mid-city-new-location-opening-news-tacos-burritos-flour-tortillas-la), and actor Kevin Hart’s plant-based fast-food joint [Hart House](https://la.eater.com/2023/5/22/23733282/hart-house-hollywood-restaurant-opening-kevin-hart-plant-based-vegan-los-angeles). Venice’s [the Window](https://la.eater.com/2023/12/21/24006995/the-window-restaurant-opening-smash-burger-long-beach-los-angeles) started serving its burgers in Belmont Shore in December and sits directly across the street from the new [L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele](https://damicheleusa.com/). The sprawling 8,000-square-foot Italian restaurant and cafe opens Friday, January 5. This isn’t the first group of LA talent seeking out newer territory in Long Beach with [Silverlake Ramen](https://la.eater.com/2018/12/6/18129562/long-beach-exchange-development-silverlake-ramen-expansion) branching into LBC in 2019, Jack Leahy and Jonathan Strader opening [Little Coyote](https://la.eater.com/2021/9/8/22662872/long-beach-pizza-shop-little-coyote-second-location) in 2020, and Felix alum Michael Ryan opening [Marlena](https://la.eater.com/2023/11/2/23943902/marlena-long-beach-michael-ryan-california-cuisine-restaurant-opening) in 2023. Many were drawn by the 467,000 Long Beach residents (slightly fewer than the city of Atlanta) and its loyal diners. L’Antica owner Francesco Zimone’s partner hails from Long Beach, and after seeing the space imagined a piazza, or Italian marketplace for his restaurant. Zimone opened the Hollywood location in early 2019, establishing the first U.S. location for the 153-year-old Naples pizzeria mentioned in the novel Eat, Pray, Love, later adapted into a film starring Julia Roberts. All locations have extensive menus but are known for their Neapolitan-style pizzas made in a customized oven that takes less than a minute to cook. After L’Antica’s Hollywood debut, Zimone opened two locations in 2022 in New York’s [West Village](https://ny.eater.com/2022/12/20/23516782/lantica-pizzeria-da-michele-opening-west-village-nyc) with a third stationed in [Santa Barbara](https://la.eater.com/2022/3/21/22989406/lantica-pizzeria-da-michele-expansion-santa-barbara-news-pizza-coming-los-angeles). Like the other US locations, Zimone designed L’Antica Belmont Shore. He took over the shuttered Papalucci’s and [Babette’s Feast](https://lbpost.com/hi-lo/food/babettes-feast-magic-lamp-close-up-shop-in-belmont-shore/), both longtime businesses that closed in 2019. Zimone adjoined the two spaces to mirror an Italian square (or plaza) and installed a 25-foot-high skylight. The Second Street entrance is lined with olive trees and other plants. Once inside, L’Antica can seat 250 with an additional outdoor area. The patios sport two outdoor fireplaces, plus a green-tiled one indoors. The rest of the design features custom wood tiles, Venetian marble bar, curved banquette seating, and a 10-person chef’s tasting area. The custom pizza oven imported from Positano faces the dining room. The menu includes wide, thin-crust Neapolitan pizzas and other dishes like arancini, beet salad, pappardelle Genovese, chicken Milanese, ribeye steak, and grilled branzino. The smaller cafe menu will include breakfast, coffee, and daytime bites. The cafe and weekend brunch will commence after the restaurant gets more settled with service. L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele Belmont Shores is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. at 4611 Second Street, Long Beach, CA, 90803.",

    "text": "No período de reinado de Momo, a histórica cidade mineira chega a receber cerca de 8 mil pessoas por dia, que se divertem em segurança com animada agenda de atrações\nMuito diferente do que ocorre nas principais capitais do país, em Tiradentes o Carnaval é, tradicionalmente, sinônimo de folia em família ao ritmo de antigas marchinhas e diversão garantida com os blocos que desfilam pelas ruas dessa histórica cidade que completou 300 anos. Em 2019, com a programação oficial começando em 28 de fevereiro com a saída do Bloco ABT (Associação dos Blocos de Tiradentes) do Quatro Cantos e se estendendo até 5 de março, os dias de Momo deverão lotar o pequeno e bucólico munícipio mineiro, que se localiza a 190 km de Belo Horizonte e concentra, na parte urbana, cerca de 3.500 habitantes.\nEsta é a expectativa da empresária Gabriela Barbosa, integrante do Coletivo Tiradentes Mais (associação que reúne empresários e artistas apaixonados por Tiradentes que atuam na área da hospitalidade). De acordo com ela, durante esse período a cidade deverá receber cerca de 8 mil pessoas por dia, em sua maioria casais e famílias de todo o Brasil que buscam segurança e animação.\nA festa carnavalesca também é responsável, segundo Gabriela, pelos altos índices de ocupação previstos para os hotéis e pousadas. “Projetamos uma taxa de ocupação entre 98% e 100%, sobretudo casais e famílias, que identificam em nossa cidade uma atraente opção de lazer para os dias de Carnaval”, diz.\nComplementarmente, a hoteleira Patricia Garcia, da Pousada Ouro de Minas, afirma: “Nosso Carnaval à moda antiga é extremamente alegre, divertido e muito benéfico para a economia do município. Além de centenas de visitantes virem curtir os blocos, as marchinhas, os shows, eles também desfrutam de outros atrativos, como os restaurantes, os museus, as lojas e as atrações turísticas. É um público muito interessante que tem o perfil da cidade”, afirma.\nSobre o Carnaval tiradentino\nNa mais bem conservada das cidades históricas de Minas, as tradições mantêm-se preservadas ao longo do tempo, de geração a geração. Segundo dados de pesquisa do Iphan (Instituto do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional), registros fotográficos dos anos 30 do século passado exemplificam a existência de blocos carnavalescos nas ruas seculares de Tiradentes desde então e de forma comprovada. Uma herança que se mantém e é, hoje, o principal diferencial do município.\nEntre os blocos mais tradicionais e animados de Tiradentes, o Ver-Te Cana é um dos mais populares. Criado em 1986 por Antonio Vicente do Nascimento – o lendário Sheshel –, é extremamente organizado, tem camiseta própria e atrai centenas de foliões vestidos de verde e branco (saída em 3 de março, às 21h30, da Rua Direita).\nOutro grupo muito prestigiado é o Palhaçada. Fundado em 2008 por Leonor Gomes, ex-professora aposentada, é um dos mais alegres e coloridos. Todos os integrantes, inclusive a fundadora e famílias inteiras, vestem-se de palhaços ou recorrem a alegorias que remetam ao look do personagem que é amado pelas crianças e dá nome ao bloco (saída em 4 de março, às 17h30, do Largo das Mercês). Antes do Palhaçada, a turma do Gatos de Botas, que desfila desde 2016 e é conhecido por ter sua própria bateria, arrasta uma multidão ao som de música clássica e o que tem de mais popular na música contemporânea (saída em 4 de março, às 16h, do Bar da Zezé).\nAtração especial da programação carnavalesca, o Bloquinho, que se autoproclama como ‘o menor bloco do mundo’, é encabeçado pelos integrantes do Teatro Casa de Boneco (com 29 anos de atuação em Tiradentes). Seu fundador, Nado Rohrmann, ao lado da mulher e do filho (Renata Franca e André Franca Rohrmann), sai pelas ruas com seus bonecos e marionetes da porta da sede da companhia, que fica na Rua Direita. Juntos, eles seguem até a esquina da Rua Padre Toledo. “É um trajeto curto, mas feito no passo e no tempo do boneco”, diz Nado. O bloco, segundo ele, surgiu de um espetáculo que homenageava e resgatava as tradições do Carnaval local, como o antigo Bloco dos Gatinhos, cujos integrantes vestiam o corpo todo, calçavam luvas na mão e colocavam uma fronha na cabeça com duas pontas amarradas para cima, imitando orelhas, e pinturas de bigodinho que simbolizam o felino.\nEm seu primeiro desfile, o Bloquinho criou bonecos que reproduziam as fantasias do saudoso Bloco dos Gatinhos. Depois, Nado passou a incorporar outros personagens que homenageiam a cultura tiradentina, como o boi. “É muito prazeroso ver as pessoas nos seguirem enquanto caminhamos vagarosamente pela rua manipulando as marionetes. Aliás, quem tiver uma em casa, pode trazer.
