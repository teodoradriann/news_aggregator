    "text": "2023-12-31 15:26:47\nChina will be “surely reunited”declared President Xi Jinping on Sunday, December 31, during his New Year’s speech, state media reported. “All Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should be bound by a common goal and share the glory of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”declared the president, during this speech broadcast on the official CCTV channel.\nDuring his meeting in mid-November with the President of the United States, Xi Jinping had already judged ” inevitable “ the reunification of Taiwan. China considers Taiwan as a province that it has not yet managed to reunify with the rest of its territory since the end of the civil war in 1949.\nBeijing, which has not given up on conquering the island by force, has exerted strong military and economic pressure on Taiwan since the coming to power in 2016 of Tsai Ing-wen, from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), who persists, according to China, in advocating independence. For Taipei, Beijing has increased military pressure around the island in recent months in the run-up to the presidential election in January.\nRead also: Article reserved for our subscribers Taiwanese civil society mobilizes against the “information war” led by China\nA “strengthened” relationship between Beijing and Moscow\nFurthermore, Chinese President Xi Jinping estimated that relations between Beijing and Moscow had strengthened in 2023, during an exchange of greetings on Sunday with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, reported Chinese state media .\nLooking back on the past year with Mr. Putin, the Chinese president estimated that “the material and public bases of our relationship have become stronger”according to state channel CCTV.\n“In the face of changes not seen in a century and a turbulent regional and international situation, China-Russia relations have maintained healthy and stable development and made steady progress in the right direction”Mr. Xi said.\n“Under our joint leadership, the political mutual trust between the two sides has deepened, our strategic coordination has become closer, and the mutually beneficial cooperation has continued to produce new results.”he added.\n#Jinping #China #surely #reunified #Years #speech",

    "title": "Are labour disputes here to stay?",
    "text": "Workers across Europe are increasingly dissatisfied with the increased cost of living which is often not matched by their payslips. 2023 was marked by several significant labour disputes across Europe, even in countries with a low record of disputes. This is especially the case for transport, education, health and social care, and manufacturing workers.\nUnclear trends While data on industrial action are scarce and fragmented, the available data indicate that in the period before the COVID-19 pandemic there was a general decrease in industrial action across EU Member States, disrupted by a few intermittent spikes . Some increase in industrial action was reported during the pandemic, especially in the sectors most affected . Due to the lack of comparable data for 2023, a precise trend in industrial action cannot be estimated.\nNevertheless, in some countries, such as Austria and Germany , the evidence shows that collective bargaining rounds were more conflictual in 2023 than in previous years. In France, the number of individual days not worked due to strikes increased by 71 per cent compared with the previous year. In the Netherland s , the number of strikes in 2023 was the highest in 50 years.\nIn Czechia, Finland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal and Sweden, qualitative assessment by Eurofound’s national correspondents also suggests more labour disputes. In Norway, the first strike since the World War II was recorded in the private sector. However, in other countries for which national data are available, such as Spain,the intensity of strikes and industrial action was lower.\nWages most common strike trigger Somewhat predictably, given the ongoing issue of inflation, the most common subject of the reported labour disputes of national significance was wages, specifically wage failing to meet the higher cost of living due to inflation and higher prices. All EU Member States, except Denmark, saw wage-related industrial action. Conflicts often arose when wage increases were not sufficient to keep up with inflation, with demands in some countries that the costs of inflation should be equally shared among employers and workers. This was notably the case in Spain.\nIn Italy, pressures around inflation culminated in a national general strike involving employees of all sectors, including managerial staff in November 2023. In the Netherlands, the staff of the largest trade union, the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions (FNV), went on strike for the first time in the union’s existence in its current form (since 2013), demanding automatic price compensation in the new collective labour agreement to cope with inflation. In Slovakia, workers in the retail bank UniCredit Bank secured an 8 per cent wage increase after strike action.\nThe public sector in several Member States also experienced industrial action, with turbulent disputes among workers in healthcare in 11 countries, education in 9 countries and public administration, including the police, army and judicial services in 11 countries. Low wages compounded by high inflation and underinvestment in the sectors were the common cause.\nWorking conditions were the second most common subject of labour disputes. This category includes, for instance, demands to reduce class size in the education sector (Lithuania and Hungary), opposition to franchising that might undermine working conditions in the retail sector (Belgium)and cleaning services (Slovenia), and protests against rising work pressure due to low staffing in the aviation industry (Belgium) and fire protection services (Ireland). Several protests addressed pension reforms (France and Romania) and changes to legal regulations (such as the right to strike in Finland).\nOther issues that triggered disputes include restrictions on industrial action and the rights of workers (Greece, Finland, France, Hungary), staff shortages (Belgium Ireland, Portugal), and change in the workplace (such as restructuring in Malta and Slovakia). Platform delivery workers launched actions in Poland against the food-delivery platform Pyszne.pl and in Slovenia against the food-and-product-delivery platforms Wolt and Glovo.\nLarge-scale and lengthy actions The industrial action in several Member States was large scale in terms of the number of participants or duration. A series of strikes against pension reform in well-unionised sectors in France encompassed the public sector, oil refineries, waste collection, public transport and education. According to various estimates, the number of demonstrators on the streets reached a record high, with between 1.3 to 3.5 million people protesting at times.\nCyprus experienced the first national general work stoppage in its history, organised by a coalition of several trade unions, after the negotiations on the Cost-of-Living Allowance agreement reached an impasse.\nWorkers in Czechia, dissatisfied with the government’s economic policy, united under the umbrella of the Czech-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions (ČMKOS), the largest trade union confederation in Czechia, and organised ‘A day of protests for a better future’ which ended up being the largest trade union demonstration since 2013.\nIn Finland, several strikes that started at the end of 2023 under the banner SeriousGrounds have continued in 2024 and are among the largest political strikes in the country’s history. They have disrupted road, railway and underground transport, closed day-care centres and harbours, and brought a large part of Finnish industry to a standstill.\nIn Croatia, an accumulation of issues in the judicial system led to the longest strike ever (two months duration) organised by court officials and state employees demanding a substantial wage increase. In Hungary, despite legislative changes in 2022 restricting the right to strike of certain occupations under rules requiring ‘adequate or minimum services’ to be maintained, a protest started in 2022 by teachers demanding better work conditions and higher wages continued in 2023 and into 2024.\nUnusual suspects It should be noted that labour disputes occurred even in countries with a historical low incidence of industrial action (due to national social partnership systems that provide consensual ways of reconciling interests) such as Austria, Ireland and Luxembourg.\nIn Austria, a protest week demanding capped prices for food, energy and housing took place in May, followed by a large demonstration organised by the Austrian Trade Union Confederation (ÖGB) in September under the slogan ‘Down with prices, up with wages’.\nIn Luxembourg, a country that rarely experiences industrial action, the two strikes in education, health and social care, and in transport (air, road and railways) in 2023 had a national impact, prompting calls for the government to intervene as a mediator in one of them.\nIn Ireland, the legacy of industrial peace in the country normally ensures low levels of industrial action; however, two notable strikes took place in 2023, both connected to insufficient public funding and low pay of workers.\nMixed achievements The demands related to the most disputed topic of 2023 – wage increases – have been addressed in most countries by means of inflation-compensation premiums, one-off payments, increases to the lowest salary scales or general wage increases.\nThe scale of wage increases varied from 5.5% (in the air freight company Cargolux in Luxembourg) to 25% (in the education sector in Romania). In some cases where the social partners were able to work towards a common goal during the collective bargaining rounds, wage settlements reached record highs. However, no clear achievements on wage increases were reported for Belgium, Greece, Finland, France, Hungary Poland, Portugal and Slovenia.\nNot all labour disputes were solved by the end of 2023. The protest by teachers in Hungary yielded no results; instead, the government further restricted teachers’ rights to strike. A conflict in Estonia’s public sector from 2023 continued into early 2024 when an indefinite strike was announced.\nSympathy strikes in 2023 show that the social partners in Norway and Sweden – countries with a long-standing tradition of cooperation between the social partners – were not able to secure a collective bargaining agreement for the foreign workers and/or employers active in their countries.\nIn several countries, despite their efforts, the social partners could not agree on a satisfying outcome for both parties, and additional intervention was required.\nAn uncertain future Data pertaining to industrial action is often fragmented and caution should be exercised before making conclusive predictions of the future. What is certain is that labour disputes and industrial actions are here to stay. Unresolved workers’ discontent can be politicised and used to exacerbate existing tensions. Continuous monitoring of labour disputes and industrial relations across Europe is key to mitigate this risk.\nThis article is sponsored by Eurofound",

    "title": "‘America is rising’: Biden uses State of the Union address to push competition with China but not conflict | South China Morning Post",
    "text": "“We want competition with China, but not conflict,” declared an energetic 81-year-old Joe Biden on Thursday during his last State of the Union address as US president before the country goes to the polls in November.\\n“We’re in a stronger position to win the competition for the 21st century against China, or anyone else for that matter,” he said, presenting a passionate case for a second term in the White House.\\nBiden boasted of low US unemployment rates, controlled inflation and falling imports from China in contending that “America is rising”.\\n“For years, all I’ve heard from my Republican friends and so many others is [that] China’s on the rise and America is falling behind,” he said. “They’ve got it backward.”\\n\\nEliciting a standing ovation from his party colleagues, Biden said his administration was not only “standing up against China’s unfair economic practices” and for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, but also revitalising partnerships and alliances in the Pacific and preventing China from using most advanced American technology.\\n“Frankly for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do that,” he said of former president Donald Trump, who appears most likely to win the Republican Party’s presidential nomination.\\nThe comments followed a year of attempts to reduce friction in the US-China relationship, which was riven by then-House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in 2022, multiple near misses between US and Chinese vessels near the island and the US military’s take-down of a Chinese spy balloon last year.\\nOn Thursday, Biden opened by castigating Republicans for blocking aid to Ukraine and his “predecessor” for saying Russia could attack Nato allies, and then turned at length to domestic issues: lashing out at the January 6, 2021, insurrection, curtailed access to abortion and high prescription-drug prices.\\nHighlights from Biden’s 2024 State of the Union speech\\nHe celebrated legislation that he signed into law, such as the Chips and Science Act that was written to reduce America’s reliance on foreign chips, which are primarily manufactured in Asia.\\nBiden also acknowledged that the US had lost many manufacturing jobs under Republican and Democratic administrations, an issue that Trump blamed on China during his successful bid for the White House in 2016.\\nThe former president brought differences with Beijing to the forefront of Washington’s foreign policy.\\nLauding United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain, who was present as Biden’s invited guest, the president referenced renewed manufacturing in the “rust-belt” state of Ohio, including an EV battery manufacturer.\\n\\n“Thanks to my Chips and Science Act, the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before,” Biden said, citing coronavirus pandemic-era shortages of chips used to make everything from mobile phones to cars.\\n“My policies have attracted US$650 billion in private-sector investment in clean energy, advanced manufacturing creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America,” he said.\\nShannon O’Neil of the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank, said that although the Biden administration had “tried to take the temperature down” on China with his “cooperate-where-we-can-and-compete-where-we-must” approach, the Beijing challenge offered an opening to talk about his domestic agenda.\\n“The theme of this speech is ‘I need another term because I need to finish the job’, then that is [where there is] a lot of the China policy” particularly on actions such as the Chips and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, she observed in a webinar just hours before the president’s appearance at Capitol Hill.\\nState media blasts ‘anti-China show’ as US lawmakers seek to force sale of TikTok\\nBoth of Biden’s signature legislations dole out billions of dollars in federal subsidies to create secure semiconductor and green technology supply chains in competition against China.\\nTensions started to ease in November when Biden met Chinese President Xi Jinping in California ahead of the annual Apec leaders summit, a meeting meant to halt the steep decline in bilateral relations.\\nDuring that encounter, the US side emphasised the need to “responsibly manage competition” to prevent the two nations from escalating into conflict, confrontation or a new cold war. At the same time, they reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to protecting American interests, values and alliances.\\nThe two nations agreed to establish a joint task force to curb the production and trafficking of illicit drugs, with a particular focus on fentanyl, which was responsible for an estimated two-thirds of opioid-related deaths in the US in 2023. The US Drug Enforcement Administration has identified China and Mexico as the primary sources of fentanyl trafficking within American borders.\\n\\nThe Xi-Biden meeting also marked the reopening of channels of communication between the two nations’ militaries, which China had halted in retaliation for Pelosi’s visit.\\nWashington has repeatedly emphasised the need to re-establish bilateral engagement to mitigate risks and avoid potential conflicts, and the record so far has been mixed.\\nFollowing the summit in November, China pledged to host up to 50,000 US students in the next five years to promote people-to-people diplomacy and strengthen relations between the two nations.\\nHowever, US State Department officials said earlier on Thursday that this goal was facing obstacles thrown up by Beijing.\\n\\n\\nOne of the two countries’ longest cooperative frameworks – a 40-year-old scientific collaboration pact that lays out the terms for government-to-government exchange and opens the way for academic and corporate interaction – appears to be proceeding.\\nA spokesperson for the State Department told the Post on Thursday that the US-China Science and Technology Agreement was extended for another six months as negotiations to “amend, extend and strengthen protections” within the pact continue.\\nWashington has expressed concerns regarding the safety of its personnel, intellectual property, and critical data during the three rounds of discussions held so far since August last year, when the agreement was first extended for six months.\\nDaniel Simon of the Institute for China-America Studies, a Washington-based think tank, described the development as “a good sign” that both sides “remain fully engaged in trying to negotiate a mutually acceptable and beneficial agreement”.\\nTime to ‘cut off’ US outbound investment in China biotech firms: House panel\\nHowever, Washington’s efforts to improve relations continue to be hampered by structural disagreements on both sides over how to deal with global challenges.\\nOn Thursday, Biden vowed that the US “will not walk away” and will “not bow down” against Moscow’s assault on Ukraine, warning that freedom and democracy were under assault at home and abroad in a jibe at Trump, who recently said he would let Russians do “whatever hell they want” if he returns to the White House.\\nBesides Chinese opposition to urging Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine, Washington has yet to secure Beijing’s support regarding the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\\nAt a meeting in Bangkok in January, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan asked Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for support in condemning and countering attacks by Houthi militia in Yemen on US ships travelling the Red Sea shipping lanes.\\nThe Houthis, a predominantly Shiite paramilitary group that took control of Yemen in 2015, are supported by Iran. In response to the Israeli attacks on Gaza, they have pledged to attack all ships in the region.\\nChina takes swipes at the US but also makes ‘direct appeal’ for cooperation\\nSullivan hoped that Beijing, given its friendly relations with Tehran, could intervene to prevent Iran from further financing the Houthi attacks.\\nHowever, Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder last month said the Chinese “have neither proposed nor undertaken any operations to protect mariners or international shipping”.\\nBeijing has also been dissatisfied that the White House refused to review tariffs first imposed on Chinese imports during the Trump administration as well as with initiatives in Washington to prevent Chinese access to US microchips.\\nThe White House also praised a bipartisan bill introduced on Tuesday in the House by Representatives Mike Gallagher and Raja Krishnamoorthi, respectively the chairman and ranking member of the House select committee on China, that would classify ByteDance’s TikTok as a “foreign adversary-controlled application” and urge the parent company to divest the platform or face a ban in the US.\\nA National Security Council spokesperson told The Hill website on Wednesday that the bill was a “welcome step” and that the administration intended to work with Congress to strengthen it.\\nAdditional reporting by Igor Patrick in Washington\\n",
