    "text": "Hurricane Milton Man Clinging to Cooler in Ocean Rescued ... Survived 90 MPH Wind, 25-Foot Waves!!! A sailor off the coast of Florida is lucky he packed some drinks for his voyage -- 'cause he was rescued by the Coast Guard after staying afloat ... by clinging to a cooler!!! The man -- who has yet to be identified -- was reportedly onboard a small fishing vessel Wednesday afternoon when he made a panicked mayday call. Due to dangerous conditions created by incoming Hurricane Milton, the USCG couldn't launch an immediate rescue mission Wednesday, but when Thursday morning rolled around, a Coast Guard chopper headed out for a last-ditch attempt. Incredibly, the Coast Guard found the sailor alive ... clinging to an open cooler in the ocean about 30 miles offshore. Check out the video -- you can see the man's arm slung over the top of the cooler, keeping him from sinking under the waves. It's estimated the man survived winds going 75 to 90 mph and waves of up to 25 feet ... conditions that make the word \"miracle\" seem appropriate here. Hurricane Milton did a ton of damage to the Sunshine State ... killing at least 16 people and causing between $30 to $60 billion in damages. While certainly a tragedy, Milton didn't cause as much damage as many experts predicted it would ... very lucky for a region still dealing with the fallout from Hurricane Helene just 2 weeks ago. At least one man's walking away relatively unscathed ... thanking his lucky stars his cooler kept him out of hot water.",

    "title": "New draft UGC rules moot flexibility; UG, PG students can pick any discipline | India News - Times of India",
    "text": "NEW DELHI: Students from any stream in Class 12 can now pursue an UG programme of their choice, and UG students can join any PG discipline, provided they clear a national- or university-level entrance exam, such as CUET, according to a draft of new UGC regulations aiming to bring sweeping reforms in India's higher education.UGC also proposes to offer biannual admissions, flexibility in minimum credit requirements to obtain a degree, and interdisciplinary learning opportunities through an option of pursuing two programmes simultaneously.The draft UGC regulations released Thursday for feedback and suggestions will be applicable to central, state, private and deemed universities. The regulations aim at dismantling “traditional disciplinary rigidities” by allowing students to choose programmes outside their prior streams, provided they meet the entrance exam requirements. “Irrespective of the disciplines taken by a student in level 4/Class XII schooling, a student is eligible for admission in any discipline of UG programme, if the student qualifies national-level or university-level entrance examination in the discipline of UG programme,” according to the regulations. UGC chairperson M Jagadesh Kumar said, “The draft UGC regulations, 2024, aim at transforming higher education by promoting flexibility, inclusivity, and adaptability. By removing rigid disciplinary boundaries, students can now explore diverse learning opportunities, ensuring India’s education system evolves to global standards.” The latest framework also encourages mobility between vocational and general education, and recognition of prior learning — whereby students’ professional experiences can translate into academic credits. Under these regulations, higher education institutions (HEIs) are authorised to conduct admissions twice a year — during July/Aug, and Jan/Feb. The draft further introduces options for multiple entry and exit points, allowing students to transition between academic levels with interim certifications such as diplomas or degrees, depending on their earned credits. Minimum 50% of total credits must be earned in the student’s chosen core subject to obtain a degree, while the remaining can be accumulated through multidisciplinary or skill-based courses. 116020655 The reforms also redefine attendance norms, allowing HEIs to tailor minimum requirements based on the programme structure, in alignment with National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The focus on continuous formative assessment and flexibility in curriculum content reflects a commitment to fostering holistic and multidisciplinary education, UGC said. The regulations also have provisions for three or four year duration for UG degrees, with optional extensions under the extended degree programme or acceleration via accelerated degree programme. For PG, a two-year programme is standard, though graduates from four-year UG courses may qualify for a one-year Master’s programme. The regulations advocate for integration of skilling, internships, and apprenticeships into UG and PG curricula.",
