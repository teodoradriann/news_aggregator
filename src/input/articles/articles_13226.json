    "title": "WhatsApp’s Voice Message Transcript Feature Triggers Data Storage Concerns",
    "text": "\\nWhatsApp will be rolling out a new feature for generating transcripts of voice messages, revealed the company on November 21. This is an opt-in feature that users will have to manually enable in their settings. Once enabled, the feature will automatically generate a written transcript of the voice message, visible only to the recipient. The transcripts are generated on the recipient\\u2019s device and are protected by end-to-end encryption just like the voice messages.\n\\nWhatsApp users can toggle voice message transcripts through the Chats section of the settings menu and select their preferred language for the transcripts. Users can then tap and hold a voice message and select Transcribe. However, WhatsApp warned that the users might encounter errors if their transcript language doesn\\u2019t match the voice message language if words are unclear due to background noise, or if the feature doesn\\u2019t support the language used in the voice message. The system may also produce inaccurate transcriptions.\n\\nThe Android version currently supports only a few languages like English, Portuguese, Spanish, and Russian, but WhatsApp has promised to expand the number of languages. iOS 16+ version supports English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, Chinese, and Arabic. iOS 17+ supports 8 additional languages.\n\\n How Do Transcripts Figure Into WhatsApp\\u2019s Privacy Policy? \\nThese transcripts don\\u2019t find any mention in WhatsApp\\u2019s updated Privacy Policy , which allows the messaging app to share data with other Meta companies. These transcripts, alongside all other messages, are end-to-end encrypted, which means that even WhatsApp cannot see them.\n\\nHowever, the policy does state that they may have to collect additional data if users want to use their features, at which point they would inform the user. An example of this is location data collection when users opt to use the app\\u2019s location-sharing feature. Whether WhatsApp would collect any additional data in order to generate the transcripts is unknown.\n\\nIt is also unknown where WhatsApp would store the transcripts. The platform states that it stores messages on users\\u2019 phones and not its own servers. However, it stores media on WhatsApp servers for 30 days. Hence the question arises: are transcripts \\u2018media\\u2019 or \\u2018messages\\u2019?\n\\nThe Competition Commission of India (CCI) recently imposed \\xa0a Rs 213.14 crore penalty on Meta, over WhatsApp\\u2019s updated privacy policy that mandated data sharing with other Meta companies.\n\\n Also Read:\n\\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n",

    "text": "While I studied at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, our founding dean and senior diplomat Professor Kishore Mahbubani [optimistically told us](https://www.brookings.edu/events/kishore-mahbubani-on-the-great-convergence/), “War, after centuries of being a scourge for humanity, is now becoming a sunset industry.” Unfortunately, nowadays that “sunset industry” is reviving, from the Russia-Ukraine war to the Israel-Hamas war. Christmas is supposed to be a time of peace and joy, but people in Gaza did not have the privilege of enjoying happiness but instead sorrow and silence due to the raging war, while in the West Bank, this year’s Christmas festivities were canceled in Bethlehem. According to United Nations statistics, since February 24, 2022, the Russia-Ukraine war has killed at least 10,000 Ukrainian civilians including more than 560 children and injured more than 18,500 people. And since October 7, 2023, the Israel-Hamas war has caused more than 14,000 deaths, including more than 100 United Nations staff and more than 50 journalists and media workers, and injured more than 33,000 people. For us, the data may be just some cold numbers, but for those who are suffering from the wars, they are a cruel reality. Professor Mahbubani may have been overly optimistic about the ending of war, but as a former president of the United Nations Security Council, he was quite right about the West’s double standards, claiming that “the West will take a moral stand only when its fundamental interest is not involved.” Such double standards have once again been applied by the US on Israel and Russia. US President Joe Biden has defended Israel’s methods in Gaza but condemned Russia’s in Ukraine. White House National Security Council coordinator [John Kirby](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/12/19/7433712/)’s attempt to differentiate between the victims of Russia’s war in Ukraine and Israel’s military operation against Hamas in Gaza has been criticized as a sophistry. For the Biden administration, it seems that human rights in Gaza are not equal to those in Ukraine. It is ironic for the US, which has always claimed to be a beacon of human rights for the world. The such double standards on Israel and Russia are considered to “ [play into a dangerous game](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/26/why-us-double-standards-on-israel-and-russia-play-into-a-dangerous-game),” and the US is gradually losing diplomatic support. When the US and [Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel) rejected a ceasefire resolution for Gaza in December at the UN General Assembly, they were only supported by eight other nations, including Micronesia and Nauru. In fact, more than 130 employees of the US Department of Homeland Security earlier asked the Biden administration to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Any attacks on civilians, no matter by Israeli military or Hamas, should be strongly condemned and punished. An immediate ceasefire in Gaza should be encouraged as soon as possible. However, long-term peace may only be achieved under the two-state solution – Israel and Palestine. Four European Union states proposed convening an international peace conference to implement a decision on the two-state option, and the foreign ministers of the UK and Germany insisted that all sides must move toward the two-state solution after the hot phase of the war. In June, Chinese President [Xi Jinping](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202306/14/content_WS6489bed2c6d0868f4e8dcdb1.html) put forward a three-point proposal for the settlement of the Palestinian question, including the establishment of an independent state of Palestine, ensuring Palestine’s economic and livelihood needs, and keeping peace talks on course. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has remained unresolved for more than half a century, causing great suffering to the people there. The new year is a time for hope and renewal, so let’s pray for a peaceful 2024 in Gaza, Ukraine, and the whole world.",

    "text": "AURORA, Colo. — Aurora City Councilman Curtis Gardner changed his party affiliation from Republican to Unaffiliated on Wednesday night, following the Colorado Republican Party chairman’s homophobic comments on Pride month.\nHe posted a critique of the Colorado GOP and chairman Dave Williams on social media saying, “The Republican Party, and specifically the Colorado GOP, no longer stands for the issues that I care about.”\nHe listed those issues as “individual rights, restraint of government, limited foreign intervention, and encouraging economic mobility.”\nHis social media post did not say he switched party affiliation.\nGardner confirmed in a phone call with 9NEWS political reporter Marshall Zelinger on Thursday that he switched party affiliation.\nEarlier this week, Williams sent out a mass email on behalf of the Colorado GOP, attacking “godless groomers” and in a social media post, called for the burning of all Pride flags .\nThe Colorado GOP’s mass email titled “God Hates Pride,” read, in part, “The month of June has arrived and, once again, the godless groomers in our society want to attack what is decent, holy, and righteous so they can ultimately harm our children.”\nThe message to Colorado Republicans was headlined with an image reading “God Hates Flags,” a nod to the anti-gay slur on the picket signs of the infamous Westboro Baptist Church.\nThe party’s message was signed by Chairman Dave Williams. A post from the Colorado Republican Party on X, formerly Twitter, read simply, “Burn all the #pride flags this June.”\nIn his social media post, Gardner said, “To be clear, God hates no one - not those in the LGBTQ+ community and not Dave Williams. These hateful comments are despicable. I will always choose love - I care less about how you vote than I care about how you treat those who vote differently than you do.”\nRelated Articles LGBTQ+ salon offers free gender affirming haircuts for anyone under 21 Colorado Republican Party issues call to burn all Pride flags Denver PrideFest announces entertainment lineup SUGGESTED VIDEOS: Next with Kyle Clark\nClose Ad",

    "text": "PancakeSwap enables limit orders through Orbs partnership\nOrbs' dLIMIT and dTWAP protocols set a new standard in DeFi trading on PancakeSwap.\nShare this article\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) PancakeSwap has announced the integration of limit orders by applying Orbs’ dLimit and dTWAP protocols into its platform. Users can also utilize the divisible order function, which allows them to divide large orders into smaller trades to mitigate price impact.\n“PancakeSwap’s integration of dLIMIT and dTWAP brings powerful new trading features to millions of DeFi users. In the process, it reinforces the protocol’s status as the preeminent solution for supporting advanced order types,” commented Ran Hammer, Orbs VP of Business Development. “Thanks to dLIMIT and dTWAP, PancakeSwap users will be able to trade more efficiently and enjoy better order execution without compromising on decentralization.”\nThe Orbs network provides an infrastructure through its layer-3 technology, with solutions designed to be fully decentralized, permissionless, and composable, aligning with the ethos of decentralized finance (DeFi). The addition of these features on PancakeSwap is expected to enhance the trading experience by providing more flexibility and efficiency in order execution. At the time of writing, the DEX was handled almost $8 billion in weekly trading volume, according to on-chain data aggregator DefiLlama.\nMoreover, PancakeSwap’s integration follows the successful adoption of dLimit and dTWAP by other prominent DEXs, including QuickSwap, SpookySwap, and Thena. With this expansion, PancakeSwap aims to offer its users a broader range of trading options across multiple Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based chains such as BNB Chain, Ethereum, zkSync, and Arbitrum.\nShare this article",

    "text": "Donald Trump fumes over Kamala Harris' powerful DNC speech as US VP calls for Gaza ceasefire: ‘She hates Israel’ Donald Trump targeted Kamala Harris after she accepted her Democratic nomination for president by calling for an end to the Gaza War. Donald Trump targetted [Kamala Harris](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/democratic-convention-ends-thursday-with-the-party-s-new-standard-bearer-kamala-harris-101724322764085.html) after she accepted her party's nomination for president at Democratic National Convention (DNC) on Thursday by calling for an end to the Gaza War and the fight against tyranny worldwide. Harris accused Trump of embracing tyrants and declared, “I know where I stand and where the United States belongs in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny.” Both anti-Israel and pro-Palestine demonstrators protested this week against the Biden administration's lack of support to ensure Gaza ceasefire. However, Harris has now made a commitment to protect [Israel](https://www.hindustantimes.com/videos/world-news/israel-may-collapse-by-next-year-idf-ex-officers-iran-hezbollah-warning-amid-gaza-war-hamas-101724350833941.html), free the captives from Gaza, and put an end to the war. She also emphasized on the sufferings of Palestinians. “Now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done,” she asserted, vowing to always “stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself”. She underscored that it is “devastating” what has transpired in Gaza throughout the last ten months. Calling the scale of suffering “heartbreaking”, Harris mentioned: “So many innocent lives lost, desperate hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again.” “President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are release, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.” Trump claps back at Harris In a series of disparaging remarks, Harris accused [Trump](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/convicted-drug-dealer-whose-sentence-was-commuted-by-trump-charged-with-domestic-violence-101724367059768.html) of not standing up for the middle class, of preparing to raise taxes through his proposed tariffs, and of having initiated the end of the constitutional right to an abortion through his nominees to the US Supreme Court. Trump, who earlier vowed to react to her speech in real time, shared a number of remarks on Truth Social. Mocking her rival, he said she stands for “incompetence and Weakness”, adding that “Our Country is being laughed at all over the World!” Also Read: [Kamala Harris storms DNC stage to give biggest speech of her career, pays tribute to ‘extraordinary’ Biden](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/kamala-harris-storms-dnc-stage-to-deliver-biggest-speech-of-her-career-pays-tribute-to-extraordinary-joe-biden-101724381431923.html) Reacting on US VP's remarks on Israel, he wrote: “SHE HATES ISRAEL - Wouldn’t even show up to Congress for Netanyahu’s session!” This was in reference to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's last US visit, where he addressed the US Congress in absence of Harris. Trump reminds ‘radical Marxist’ Harris that she has only 4.5 months left In another post, labelled Harris as “radical Marxist”. “She just called to give all Illegals CITIZENSHIP, SAY GOODBYE TO THE U.S.A.! SHE IS A RADICAL MARXIST!” Trump had one question for Harris shortly after her keynote address at the DNC. “Why didn't she do the things she's complaining about?” Trump wondered. On the border issue, he said, “She could do it tonight by leaving the auditorium and going to Washington, DC, and closing the border. She doesn't need a bill. I didn't have a bill. I closed the border.” He further quipped she has 4.5 months left in the office, predicting his win in the November elections.

    "text": "Google’s OSS-Fuzz finds more than twenty vulnerabilities in various open source projects Among them is a vulnerability in OpenSSL that could result in RCE Google considers this an important milestone in automated bug discovery Google found 26 vulnerabilities in various open source code repositories, including a moderate flaw in “the critical OpenSSL library that underpins much of the Internet infrastructure.”\nThis wouldn’t really be news (Google has helped find thousands of bugs over the years) if the method by which the bugs were discovered wasn’t “artificial,” as the bugs were revealed using AI-powered fuzzing technology. tool. OSS Fuzz.\n“These specific vulnerabilities represent a milestone in automated vulnerability finding: they were all found with AI, using AI-generated and enhanced fuzz targets,” Google explained in a blog post.\nMajor improvements with LLMs Among these 26 flaws is an OpenSSL bug tracked as CVE-2024-9143. It has a severity score of 4.3 and is described as an out-of-bounds memory write error that can crash an app or allow scammers to conduct Remote Code Execution (ML) attacks. OpenSSL has since been upgraded to versions 3.3.3, 3.2.4, 3.1.8, 3.0.16, 1.1.1zb and 1.0.2zl to fix the bug.\nTo make matters even more interesting, Google said the vulnerability had most likely been present for 20 years, “and would not have been discovered using existing fuzz targets written by humans.”\nThe discovery of the bug was the result of two major improvements, the company further explained. The first is the ability to automatically generate more relevant context in the prompts, making the LLM “less likely to hallucinate the missing details in its response.” The second revolves around the LLM’s ability to emulate the entire workflow of a typical developer, including writing, testing, and iterating on the fuzz target, as well as reviewing the crashes found.\n“This made it possible to further automate more parts of the fuzzing workflow. This additional iterative feedback, in turn, also resulted in higher quality and a greater number of correct fuzz targets.”\nSign up for the Ny Breaking newsletter and get all the best news, opinions, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nVia The hacker news\nYou might like it too",
