    "text": "Starting in the new year, California employers will be barred from asking workers about their use of cannabis outside of work and from discriminating against them because of it. Two bills signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in the past couple of years aim to strengthen the state’s legal cannabis industry by updating outdated laws. [Assembly Bill 2188](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB2188), which Newsom signed in 2022, will prohibit employers from using the results of hair or urine tests for marijuana — which can detect traces of cannabis for days or weeks — in their decisions to hire, fire or penalize workers. When the governor signed AB 2188 along with other cannabis-related bills in 2022, he said in a press release that “rigid bureaucracy and federal prohibition continue to pose challenges to the industry and consumers.” [SB 700](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB700), which Newsom signed this year, clarifies AB 2188 by amending the state’s Fair Employment and Housing Act to bar employers from asking job applicants about their prior use of cannabis. California NORML, a nonprofit organization that advocates for consumer rights related to cannabis, sponsored AB 2188. In its argument supporting the bill, the organization said hair or urine testing for marijuana does not detect actual impairment, a fact the federal government has [acknowledged](https://books.google.com/books?id=ybkZs0i3ELoC&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=A+positive+test+result,+even+when+confirmed,+only+indicates+that+a+particular+substance+is+present+in+the+test+subject%E2%80%99s+body+tissue.+It+does+not+indicate+abuse+or+addiction;+recency,+frequency,+or+amount+of+use;+or+impairment&source=bl&ots=GiVhuWOQgj&sig=ACfU3U26hndTWloIJYYX_OhrBdiKZ_kfCg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiK3v-Vk_nwAhXdFVkFHZSoDL0Q6AEwAHoECAIQAw#v=onepage&q=A%20positive%20test%20result%2C%20even%20when%20confirmed%2C%20only%20indicates%20that%20a%20particular%20substance%20is%20present%20in%20the%20test%20subject%E2%80%99s%20body%20tissue.%20It%20does%20not%20indicate%20abuse%20or%20addiction%3B%20recency%2C%20frequency%2C%20or%20amount%20of%20use%3B%20or%20impairment&f=false). “Studies indicate that metabolite tests for past use of marijuana are useless in protecting job safety,” the group said.",

    "text": "FDA places its most serious warning on menopause drug due to risk of liver injury\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has placed its most serious warning – a so-called black-box warning – on a drug used to relieve menopausal hot flashes.\nThe FDA says women who are taking Veozah may need more frequent blood testing to check for markers of liver problems.\nIn rare cases, the drug may seriously injure the liver, and patients with symptoms including fatigue, unusual itching, nausea, vomiting, light-colored stools, dark urine, or yellow skin or eyes should tell their doctors and stop taking the medication, the FDA said Tuesday in a drug safety communication.\nAstellas, the drug's manufacturer, said in a statement that patient safety is its top priority.\n\"It's important to note that the overall benefit-risk of Veozah has not changed and remains positive, but we want to further ensure that patients and healthcare providers are aware of the potential side effects,\" as well as recommended lab testing, the company said.\nVeozah was approved in 2023. It works without hormones to reduce hot flashes by blocking a receptor called neurokinin B, which plays a role in the brain's regulation of body temperature.\nSince its approval, use of the medication has steadily increased. In May, nearly 29,000 patients picked up the pills from retail pharmacies in the United States, the FDA said.\nThe FDA first warned in September that the drug could cause liver problems. It escalated that warning after reviewing the case of a person with blood markers of liver injury who had been taking the medication for about 40 days. After they stopped taking the medication, the patient's symptoms gradually went away and their liver values returned to normal.\nEveryone reacts differently to medication depending on their health, genes and other factors. For that reason, the FDA said, it's impossible to know how likely it might be for any individual to develop these liver issues.\nIf you're taking Veozah, it's important to stay alert and check in with your doctor for monitoring.\nThe FDA said patients should have blood tests for liver markers every month for the first three months after starting Veozah and again at months six and nine. They should also stop treatment if it is recommended.",

    "text": "[Europe](../) Argentines protest against Milei’s deregulation and austerity Thousands of people in the country are unhappy with the new president’s controversial proposed changes. Thousands of Argentines have taken to the streets of Buenos Aires to protest a decree of sweeping economic reform and deregulation proposed by newly-elected President Javier Milei. Marching at the behest of labour unions, the protesters demanded the courts intervene to invalidate the mega-decree they say would carve away at worker and consumer protections. Congress is sitting in an extraordinary session this week, at the request of ultra-libertarian Milei – in office since 20 December 10 – to consider the plan. The decree would change or scrap more than 350 economic regulations in a country accustomed to heavy government intervention in the market. Among others, it abolishes a price ceiling on rent, eliminates some worker protections and scraps laws shielding consumers from abusive price increases at a time annual inflation exceeds 160% and the poverty level has surpassed 40%. A number of civic groups have recently filed a judicial motion to have the decree declared unconstitutional. On Wednesday, protesters waved Argentine flags and placards reading: “The homeland is not for sale.” “We do not question the legitimacy of President Milei, but we want him to respect the division of powers. Workers need to defend their rights when there is an unconstitutionality,” construction union leader Gerardo Martinez told reporters at the march. Milei’s “chainsaw plan” to cut state spending has triggered a series of street protests against the government. Other aspects of the decree include an end to automatic pension increases, restrictions on the right to strike – and easing away from price caps for private health services. It also terminates some 7,000 civil service contracts. Unless Congress scraps the plan in its entirety, the decree will enter into force on Friday. Milei’s far-right party, Freedom Advances, has 40 of the 257 deputies in Congress and seven of 72 senators. “The decree is destructive of all labour rights,” 45-year-old teacher Martin Lucero, who took part in the protest, said. “The Argentine people chose Milei as president of the nation, not as emperor,” he added.

    "text": "On Friday at 2:27 p.m. a red flag warning was issued by the National Weather Service in effect until 7 p.m. for Southern Wayne as well as Lackawanna, Luzerne and Pike counties.\nExpect winds to be northwest 10 mph to 20 mph with gusts to 30 mph and humidity as low as 25 percent.\n\"Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly. Outdoor burning is not recommended,\" says the weather service.\nWhat does a red flag warning indicate? A red flag warning indicates that either extreme fire weather conditions are currently happening or will happen soon, as per the weather service. Warm temperatures, very low humidities, and stronger winds are expected to combine to produce an increased risk of fire to spread rapidly.\nSo, what should you do under a red flag warning? During a red flag warning, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution and be prepared to take immediate action in case a fire starts. The weather service offers these steps you can take to lower the risk of fires igniting and ensure your safety:\n1. Secure burn barrels:\nIf burning is authorized in your vicinity, ensure that all burn barrels feature a weighted metal cover with holes no larger than 3/4 of an inch. 2. Mindful handling of smoking materials:\nPrudently discard cigarette butts and avoid flinging cigarettes or matches from a moving vehicle. These seemingly innocuous actions can kindle dry grass, potentially triggering a wildfire. 3. Properly extinguish outdoor fires:\nTo safeguard against accidental fires, diligently extinguish all outdoor fires. Drown them with an ample amount of water and stir to confirm that everything is cold to the touch. Submerge charcoal in water until it's thoroughly cooled. Never dispose of live charcoal on the ground. 4. Never leave fires unattended:\nAvoid abandoning any fire without supervision. Even minor sparks or drifting embers can incite nearby foliage or grass, setting off a rapidly spreading fire. Understanding the gravity of a red flag warning and adhering to these precautions is pivotal in mitigating the risk of wildfires during these perilous conditions. Prioritize safety, stay well-informed, and act responsibly to safeguard lives and property.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

    "title": "OpenAI planea crear un navegador web con IA para competir con Google",
    "text": "Semana de malas noticias para Google. Si el miércoles supo que el Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos quiere obligarla a vender el negocio de Chrome para acabar con su monopolio, el jueves se filtró que OpenAI, su rival y fabricante de ChatGPT, estudia la posibilidad de desarrollar un navegador web propio para desbancarla. Según publica The Information, la start-up de inteligencia artificial financiada por Microsoft se plantea crear un producto de navegación por Internet que combinaría con su chatbot, si bien esa posibilidad está aún lejos de materializarse. Con este movimiento, OpenAI podría tratar de plantar cara a Google. Chrome es el navegador más popular del mundo, pues concentra un 67% de ese mercado, según datos de Statcounter, muy por delante de rivales como Safari, Edge o Firefox. Competir con Google es una misión titánica, pero eso podría cambiar si la justicia estadounidense termina obligando a la compañía a desprenderse de su navegador. Ambas noticias han hecho que la capitalización de Google se resienta en bolsa. En las últimas 24 horas, sus acciones se han devaluado un 4,56%. No es la primera vez que OpenAI reta a Google. A finales de julio, la empresa capitaneada por Sam Altman anunció el lanzamiento de SearchGPT, el prototipo de un motor de búsqueda que se sirve de IA para dar respuesta a las consultas de los usuarios. Un año antes, Microsoft integró esa tecnología en su buscador Bing y en su navegador Edge a través de Copilot, un asistente conversacional que acompaña al usuario durante la navegación web. El dominio de Google en ese campo es aún más abrumador, pues su servicio concentra casi el 90% del mercado mundial de las búsquedas web. Aun así, las maniobras de Microsoft y OpenAI han obligado a Google a mover ficha. A finales de 2023, el gigante tecnológico dirigido por Sundar Pichai lanzó su propio modelo de IA, Gemini, y lo integró a sus servicios para tratar de mejorar las búsquedas y neutralizar a sus rivales. OpenAI también está buscando otras fórmulas para ganar terreno a Google. Según The Information, la firma está estudiando la posibilidad de potenciar las funciones de IA en los móviles y tabletas fabricados por la surcoreana Samsung, tradicional socio comercial de Google. En junio, la creadora de ChatGPT anunció una nueva alianza para alimentar los dispositivos de Apple, que cobra unos 12.000 millones de dólares anuales de Google para que su navegador y su buscador estén instalados por defecto.",

While Hamlin has since expanded his vision to include helping to provide CPR education and AED training and devices to sports facilities and schools among other places, he has never forgotten where it all started and that his dream was to give the kids in his community both a mentor and a hope for a future that could take them anywhere. The weekly NFLPA Community MVP award is a long-enduring honor synonymous with community outreach and philanthropy efforts from NFL players throughout the country, and even around the world. As one of this season’s weekly Community MVP winners, Hamlin is also eligible for the NFLPA Alan Page Community Award — the highest honor bestowed upon a player by the NFLPA. Damar Hamlin was named the 2023 NFLPA Alan Page Community Award winner. Hamlin was honored as part of the overwhelming charitable giving from Bills Mafia and people everywhere who wanted to show their support for Hamlin who suffered a life-threatening emergency that we now understand was commotio cordis in-game last season against the Cincinnati Bengals. Those funds raised benefited Hamlin’s Chasing M’s Foundation, and have allowed him to expand his philanthropic efforts to include CPR training and distribution/training of life-saving AED equipment. Joining Hamlin this season as a Community MVP winner, Bills linebacker Tyrel Dodson received the award in Week 16 for his efforts to make the holidays special and stress-free for four families led by single mothers. Dodson treated each mom to a $500 shopping spree to tackle wish lists, and provided Christmas trees, ornaments, and more to each family. Damar Hamlin was Week 18 NFLPA Community MVP last year as well. He told me at his toy drive: “I feel like ‘That’s So Raven’ a little bit, when she used to have her visions of seeing things. Man, I’ve seen this thing 100 times over, & I just couldn’t wait to get to this moment.”— katherine fitzgerald (@kfitz134) [January 5, 2024]",

    "text": "Estas son las funciones principales de la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, que permite tanto a empresas como a gobiernos financiar proyectos Día bajista para el índice mexicano S&P/BMV IPC, que terminó la jornada del jueves 27 de junio con leves caídas del 0,3% , hasta los 52.310,96 puntos . El índice mexicano S&P/BMV IPC marcó un volumen máximo de 52.470,77 puntos y un mínimo de 52.082,76 puntos . El rango de cotización para el índice mexicano S&P/BMV IPC entre su punto más alto y el más bajo (máximo-mínimo) durante este día se situó en el 0,74% .\nEn la última semana, el índice mexicano S&P/BMV IPC acumula una bajada del 0,9%% , de modo que en términos interanuales acumula aún una disminución del 1,34% . El índice mexicano S&P/BMV IPC se sitúa un 10,9% por debajo de su máximo en lo que va de año (58.711,87 puntos) y un 0,97% por encima de su cotización mínima del año en curso (51.807,55 puntos).\n¿Qué es un índice bursátil y para qué sirve? Un índice bursátil es un indicador que mide la evolución del valor de un conjunto de activos determinado , por lo que toma datos de diversas compañías o sectores de una parte del mercado.\nEstos indicadores son usados principalmente por las bolsas de valores de distintos países del mundo y cada uno de ellos pueden integrarse por firmas con requisitos concretos como podría ser tener una capitalización bursátil similar o pertenecer a la misma industria, además, hay algunos índices que sólo consideran un puño de acciones para determinar su valor u otras que consideran cientos de acciones.\nLos índices bursátiles sirven como indicador de la confianza en el mercado de valores, la confianza empresarial, la salud de la economía nacional y global y el rendimiento de las inversiones en acciones y participaciones de una entidad. Generalmente, si los inversionistas no tienen confianza, los valores de las acciones tienden a caer.\nAsimismo, funcionan para medir el rendimiento de un gestor de activos y permiten a los inversores hacer un cotejo entre la rentabilidad y el riesgo; medir las oportunidades de un activo financiero o crear carteras.\nEste tipo de indicadores comenzaron a usarse a finales del siglo XIX luego de que el periodista Charles H. Dow. observara con detenimiento cómo las acciones de las empresas tendían a subir o bajar juntas de precio, por lo que creó dos índices: uno que contenía a las 20 compañías ferroviarias más importantes (pues era la industria más importante de la época), así como 12 acciones de otros tipos de negocios\nActualmente en la humanidad existen diversos índices y pueden juntarse en función de su geografía, los sectores, el tamaño de las empresas o también el tipo de activo , por ejemplo, el índice estadounidense del Nasdaq está compuesto por las 100 mayores compañías en gran medida relacionadas a la tecnologías como Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOG), Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), PayPal (PYPL), Comcast (CMCSA), Adobe (ADBE).\n¿Cómo leer un índice? Cada índice bursátil posee su propia forma de ser medido , pero el principal factor es la capitalización bursátil de cada empresa que lo integra. Este se saca al multiplicar el valor del día del bono en la bolsa correspondiente por el total de participaciones que están en circulación en el mercado.\nLas empresas que aparecen en la bolsa de valores están obligadas a presentar un balance de su composición. Dicho reporte debe entregarse cada tres o seis meses, según corresponda.\nLeer un índice bursátil también implica observar sus alteraciones en el tiempo. Los nuevos índices siempre abren con un valor fijo basado en los precios de las acciones en su fecha de inicio, pero no todos siguen este método. Por ende, puede confundir.\nSi un índice suma 500 puntos en una jornada, mientras que otro solo adiciona 20, podría parecer que el primero tuvo un rendimiento mejor. No obstante, si el primero comenzó el día en 30.000 puntos y el otro en 300, se puede concluir que, en términos porcentuales, las ganancias para el segundo fueron más destacables.\nLos principales índices bursátiles Entre los principales índices bursátiles en la Unión Americana está el Dow Jones Industrial Average, mejor conocido como Dow Jones , conformado por 30 compañías. De igual manera, el S&P 500 , que incluye a 500 de las mayores empresas de la Bolsa de Nueva York. Por último, hay que mencionar el Nasdaq 100 , que reúne a 100 de las mayores firmas no financieras.\nPor otro lado, los índices más importantes de Europa son el Eurostoxx 50 , que abarca las 50 empresas más importantes de la eurozona. Por otro lado, el DAX 30 , principal índice alemán que contiene a las compañías más descollantes de la Bolsa de Fráncfort; la FTSE 100 de la Bolsa de Londres; el CAC 40 de la Bolsa de París; y el IBEX 35 , de la bolsa española.\nEn Asia , los principales índices bursátiles son el Nikkei 225 , compuesto por las 225 empresas más importantes de la bolsa de valores de Tokio. Asimismo, el SSE Composite Index , es visto como el principal de China, conformado por las compañías más destacadas de la Bolsa de Shanghái. De igual manera, cabe mencionar el Hang Seung Index en Hong Kong y el KOSPI en Corea del Sur.\nEn lo que respecta a la región latinoamericana , se tiene el IPC , que contiene a las 35 firmas más influyentes de la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV) . Al menos un tercio de ellas pertenecen al capital del magnate Carlos Slim.\nOtro es el Bovespa , compuesto por las 50 empresas más importantes de la bolsa de Sao Paulo; el Merval de Argentina; el IPSA de Chile; el MSCI COLCAP de Colombia; el IBC de Caracas, conformado por 6 compañías de Venezuela.\nFinalmente, existen otro tipo de índices bursátiles globales como el MSCI Latin America , que incluye las 137 empresas más importantes de Brasil, Chile, Colombia, México y Perú.\nDe igual forma, está el MSCI World , que incluye a 1600 compañías de 23 países desarrollados; el MSCI Emerging Markets , compuesto por más de 800 empresas de países en desarrollo; y el S&P Global 100 , conformado por las 100 firmas multinacionales más poderosas de todo el planeta.",
