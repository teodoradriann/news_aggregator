    "text": "The Turn Center boosts staffing to serve more patients in Amarillo AMARILLO, Texas (KFDA) - More children in our area now have the opportunity to receive speech therapy through the Turn Center after an increase in staffing. According to the Turn Center, they’ve hired more speech pathologists to increase the amount of families they serve. This has almost eliminated their waitlist for the first time in years. “What can we do to support this family? What do they need to help better their lives,” said Stephanie Wright, outpatient therapy director, Turn Center. “And once we can kind of start digging into that and the parents start taking our recommendations, their lives are forever changed. That kiddo can now meet those milestones.” The Turn Center serves children from infants to 21 years of age with a range of abilities in order to support developmental skills. “In self-play and parallel talk, we‘re talking about what the kid is doing using the language they don’t physically have at that moment, and we‘re modeling for that when the time comes. They know in their tool box what they can use while they’re playing,” said Madasyn Epp, speech language pathologist, Turn Center. The Turn Center also offers occupational and physical therapy, which allows all three disciplines to work with one another to benefit patients. “We have a lot of resources. We have this pool, we have the apartment. We have a sensory room, we have the big gym and a small gym. We have lots of different areas that can work and incorporate daily life activities or just extra support for our kids that need it,” said Epp. If you have any concerns regarding your child’s development, talk to your pediatrician for guidance.

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "National Guard soldiers down Russian cruise missiles using small arms – photo A mobile fire group from the 27th Pechersk Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine shot down a Russian cruise missile using small arms during a large-scale Russian attack on Ukraine on 29 December. Source: [The National Guard of Ukraine](https://www.facebook.com/NGUmainpage/posts/pfbid0UvKXdRf4QYDTGDZZzNL2xHHcnybzXmjbhFEYUspyaEqfPar4EJZ2LanPAo5KXc48l) Details: After detecting a target moving towards Kyiv, the National Guard personnel opened fire from their machine guns. Upon examining the wreckage, it was found that the missile had lost control and crashed due to the detonation of its fuel tanks. The warhead did not explode. For reference: Mobile fire groups of the National Guard are created to counter air strikes, specifically for downing missiles and kamikaze drones. Combined with the effective work of air defence units, this enables an increase in the success rate of intercepting aerial targets, thereby preserving infrastructure and the lives of citizens.

    "title": "Companies grew more confident about initial public offerings in 2023 | Investment Executive",
    "text": "The signs of life shown by the initial public offering (IPO) market in the U.S., especially in the second half of the year, are giving analysts hope that more companies will be enticed to go public in 2024. Overall, 108 initial public offerings raised proceeds of about $19.4 billion in 2023, according to Renaissance Capital. That’s up from a dismal 71 IPOs for proceeds of $7.7 billion in 2022, when high inflation and rising interest rates discouraged companies from hitting the market. This year’s big IPOs included health-care products company Kenvue in May, U.K. chip designer Arm Holdings in September and footwear company Birkenstock in October. They accounted for over half of the total IPO proceeds, according to Renaissance Capital. Instacart also had a splashy IPO in late summer. A post-pandemic surge for IPOs was stifled by the highest inflation in four decades in 2022, raising concerns about the economy buckling under the pressure. The Federal Reserve then embarked on a historic round of rate hikes to tame inflation, which made borrowing more expensive and increased caution in the IPO market. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the monthly personal consumption and expenditures report, has cooled to a pace of 2.6% from a high of 7.1% in the middle of 2022. Other measures of inflation, such as the consumer price index, reached a peak of 9.1% in 2022. The central bank fought inflation by raising its benchmark rate from near zero to a range of 5.25% to 5.50%. The Fed has held that range steady for several months and has signaled that it could start cutting rates in 2024. Wall Street is betting that could happen early in the year. Cooling inflation and falling interest rates could push the IPO market back toward a more normal level of activity, which averaged about 170 IPOs with average proceeds of about $43 billion from 2017 to 2019. “While the IPO market’s recovery is still somewhat tenuous, all signs point to a solid pickup in 2024,” said Renaissance Capital in its recent IPO review for 2023. The IPO market is expected to grow along with an economy. Corporate profits are expected to rise after shaking off an earnings recession. Earnings gains of just under 2% during the fourth quarter of 2023 could be followed by a gain of more than 8% in the first quarter of 2024 and 10% during the second quarter of 2024 for companies in the S&P 500, analysts forecast. The S&P 500 index is on track to close the year with a gain of more than 20%. Wall Street is increasingly expecting the Fed to achieve its so-called soft landing goal by trimming inflation to the central bank’s 2% target without an ensuing recession. IPO activity could speed up as CEOs gain more confidence that the “soft landing” will happen, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis.",

    "title": "Bugatti La Voiture Noire: The Most Overpriced Luxury Car in the World?",
    "text": "Christopher Parr\nChristopher Parr, is the Editor and Chief Content Creator for…\nWhen it comes to luxury cars, there is always a fine balance between exclusivity, performance, and value for money. However, some vehicles lean so heavily toward extravagance that they cross the line into what can only be described as overpriced and overrated.\nOne such car is the Bugatti La Voiture Noire—a vehicle that has been shrouded in mystique since its unveiling. Its name, which translates to “The Black Car”, adds to its aura of exclusivity and elusiveness. But beyond the branding and marketing buzz, does it truly justify its price tag, or is it just an engineering illusion?\nAt The Pursuitist, we’ve analyzed countless luxury vehicles, and few stand out as much as the La Voiture Noire—for all the wrong reasons. Let’s break it down.\nAn Exorbitant Price Tag That Raises Eyebrows\nUnrivaled Cost\nThe Bugatti La Voiture Noire is the world’s most expensive new car, carrying an estimated price tag of $18.7 million, including taxes. This staggering price is more than double that of the previous record-holder, the Rolls-Royce Sweptail ($12.8 million).\nFor context:\n- A Bugatti Chiron, with nearly identical performance specs, costs just $3.3 million.\n- The Pagani Huayra Codalunga, another highly exclusive hypercar, is priced at $7.4 million.\n- Even the Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut, one of the fastest cars in the world, costs around $3.4 million.\nAt this point, one has to ask: Is exclusivity alone worth an additional $15 million?\nLimited Availability\nThe La Voiture Noire was built as a one-off, meaning only a single unit exists. While that certainly increases its rarity, does it justify such an astronomical price?\nOther hypercars, like the Ferrari Monza SP1/SP2 and Lamborghini Veneno, were also produced in limited numbers (less than 20 units each), yet they cost a fraction of La Voiture Noire’s price.\nIn essence, Bugatti is selling a concept, a dream, and a piece of automotive art rather than a car meant for driving. But is that enough?\nPerformance and Specifications: Underwhelming for the Price\nFor an $18.7 million supercar, one would expect groundbreaking performance. However, the La Voiture Noire does not outperform its cheaper counterparts.\nComparable Horsepower\nUnder the hood, the 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged W16 engine produces 1,500 horsepower and 1,180 lb-ft of torque. Impressive? Yes. Unique? Not at all.\n- The Bugatti Chiron has exactly the same engine and power output.\n- The Bugatti Divo, priced at around $6 million, also shares these figures.\n- The Hennessey Venom F5, a $2.1 million hypercar, produces 1,817 horsepower, surpassing the La Voiture Noire.\nAt a price point five to six times higher than other hypercars, shouldn’t it deliver significantly more power?\nUnimpressive Top Speed\nThe La Voiture Noire has a top speed of 261 mph (420 km/h), the same as the Chiron. However:\n- The Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ reaches 304 mph and costs around $3.9 million.\n- The Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut is expected to exceed 330 mph for $3.4 million.\nIn other words, faster and more powerful cars are available for a fraction of the cost.\nFor an $18.7 million price tag, shouldn’t it be the fastest car in the world?\nLuxury and Aesthetics: Is It Just Hype?\nOne-Off Design\nThe La Voiture Noire is inspired by the legendary Bugatti Type 57 SC Atlantic from the 1930s—one of the rarest and most sought-after classic cars. Its design is sleek, sculptural, and undeniably stunning. However, is it revolutionary?\n- Yes: It has a flowing, seamless body with no visible seams, making it appear almost like a single piece of metal.\n- No: It still follows the same general shape and structure as the Chiron. Unlike other special-edition Bugattis like the Divo, which have significantly different aerodynamics, La Voiture Noire is more of a styling exercise than a true engineering marvel.\nInterior: Not That Special\nThe interior, while undoubtedly luxurious, does not significantly differ from other Bugatti models:\n- Premium leather, carbon fiber, and aluminum details? Expected.\n- A high-tech digital instrument cluster and premium sound system? Standard.\n- Any never-before-seen technology? Not really.\nFor a $18.7 million price tag, one would expect some groundbreaking interior features—perhaps a fully customizable digital cockpit, augmented reality windscreen displays, or AI-assisted driving modes. But instead, it’s a slightly refined Chiron interior.\nCost of Ownership: The Hidden Expense\nEven if you can afford to buy La Voiture Noire, can you afford to own it?\n- Maintenance Costs: Bugatti servicing is one of the most expensive in the world. A simple oil change costs around $25,000.\n- Tire Replacement: Special Michelin tires cost $42,000 per set, and Bugatti recommends replacing them every 2,500 miles.\n- Insurance: Expect six-figure premiums annually.\n- Depreciation? Unlike other hypercars, the La Voiture Noire might hold its value due to its one-off status—but that’s still a gamble.\nThe Big Mystery: Who Owns The Bugatti La Voiture Noire?\nSince its unveiling in 2019, rumors have circulated about who purchased the world’s most expensive new car.\nOne of the biggest speculations? Cristiano Ronaldo.\nThe soccer superstar, known for his lavish collection of luxury vehicles, was rumored to have bought the La Voiture Noire as a 35th birthday present to himself for $18.9 million.\nHowever, when asked about the reports, Bugatti’s Communications Manager, Tim Bravo, stated:\n“We don’t comment on rumors, even less when customers are involved. We respect their privacy. It’s on them, not on us, to decide if they want to go public or not. I can’t deny nor confirm the reports.”\nSo, is the “no comment” response an implicit confirmation? The Pursuitist thinks so.\nOther rumored buyers include:\n- Ferdinand Piëch, the late Volkswagen Group Chairman who played a crucial role in Bugatti’s revival.\n- A mystery Middle Eastern billionaire, possibly a member of the Saudi or UAE royal family.\nAs of today, the official owner has never been publicly confirmed.\nFinal Verdict: Is It Worth $18.7 Million?\nThe Bugatti La Voiture Noire is undeniably a work of art—but does that justify the price?\nPros:\n✅ Unparalleled exclusivity (only one in existence)\n✅ A stunning, unique design inspired by the Type 57 SC Atlantic\n✅ A luxurious collector’s item that may appreciate in value\nCons:\n❌ Performance nearly identical to the Chiron, which costs $3.3 million\n❌ Not the fastest, most powerful, or most advanced hypercar available\n❌ Overwhelmingly high ownership and maintenance costs\nAt the end of the day, unless you have an extra $18.7 million to burn, just buy a Bugatti Chiron and save yourself $15 million.\nChristopher Parr\nChristopher Parr, is the Editor and Chief Content Creator for Pursuitist, and a contributing writer to USA Today, Business Insider — and the on-air host of Travel Tuesday on Live at 4 CBS.

    "text": "Zelenskyy believes US can send Ukraine more aid to win President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed his gratitude to the US for its support since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion. However, he believes that more could be done to help Kyiv prevail. Source: Zelenskyy in an interview with the British [Channel 4 News](https://x.com/Channel4News/status/1748430621263757349?s=20), as reported by European Pravda Details: Regarding the likelihood of passing more aid in the US Congress, which is stalled because of disagreements over immigration policy, President Zelenskyy stated that he is not concerned about senators or congressmen. Quote: \"I had meetings with them. When I sit with them, – in any case, bilaterally, we have a dialogue tet-a-tet, or in a team, – mostly, 99.9%, they are on my side,\" he added. When asked whether Zelensky trusts the words of support that he heard from members of the US Congress, he replied that he \"trusts the results.\" Quote: \"During almost five years of my presidency, and during this [full-scale] war, from one side, I saw everything. But when I speak with the politicians, sometimes I think that I saw nothing… Everybody is smiling, everybody is laughing, everybody is crying, hugging you, they say: ‘You are resilient, you are so strong, you are the man, you are the leader of the free world, you saved our democracy… We could have lost half of Europe, and Russia would have attacked the United States and NATO countries, and we have to give you everything that we have.’ And then like ‘cut’,\" the president described his impressions. Commenting on the volume of US military assistance from Ukraine, Zelenskyy added: \"They helped a lot to stay (for Ukraine to survive – ed.). And I think they could help us more to win.\" US President Joe Biden [ met with congressional leaders](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/01/18/7437753/) and members of the House of Representatives on 17 January in order to discuss the urgent need to allocate funds for Ukraine. The Senate is awaiting consideration of a deal on southern border security and funding for Ukraine next week. The package will include more than US$60 billion in aid for Ukraine, US$14 billion for Israel, and US$14 billion to help secure the border and protect it against migrants coming into the country from the south. Earlier, the White House said the US had [ no money](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/eng/news/2024/01/4/7176701/) for further military aid for Ukraine until the adoption of a new package by the US Congress.

    "text": "Former NCAA Player of the Year Turning Heads for Jazz in G-League\nIn a year focused on player development, Utah Jazz rookies Cody Williams, Isaiah Collier, and Kyle Filipowski have garnered most of the attention. However, the best game from Utahâ€™s youth movement this season may be from Jazz two-way player Oscar Tshiebwe.\nOn Tuesday night, Tshiebwe scored 32 points and grabbed 22 rebounds to lead the Salt Lake City Stars over the Stockton Kings. Through 16 games this season, Tshiebwe is averaging 15.3 points and 17.7 rebounds per game.\nThe second-year product from the University of Kentucky is no stranger to success in the G-League. He was the MVP of the G-League as a rookie for the Indiana Mad Ants during the 2022-23 season. This came following a year in which he earned National Player of the Year honors for the University of Kentucky in 2022.\nDespite being an undersized NBA center at 6-foot-8, Tshiebwe has a knack for dominating the boards. He broke a G-League record in his rookie campaign by recording 16.2 rebounds per contest. Tshiebwe recorded 27 double-doubles and broke the single-game Mad Ants rebounding record with 28 rebounds.\nTshiebwe is attempting to crack the rotation of a crowded frontcourt in Salt Lake City. Currently, Utah has three rostered players who can play the center position. Walker Kessler is the starter, and John Collins and Drew Eubanks are the backups. Utah also has some versatility if they want to go small, with Kyle Filipowsk getting minutes at the five. Despite the success in the G-League, Tshiebwe has only logged two games with the Jazz this year, averaging three points and seven rebounds per game.Â\nJazz fans may see more of Tshiebwe, considering the trade deadline is three weeks away. Rumors have been circulating around John Collins being traded, and Drew Eubanks has an expiring contract that could be needed to help facilitate a deal.Â If the deadline is anything like it's been for the past two years, we can anticipate Tshiebwe being a part of the Jazz permanently after February 6.\nEither way, with the numbers Tshiebwe has been putting up, an opportunity should come knocking sooner rather than later. If an Achilles heel does exist in his game, itâ€™s as a long-distance shooter. If Utah is looking for a big one that can space the floor, Tshiebwe isnâ€™t the guy.Â Jazz fans interested in watching Tshiebwe up close can catch him Thursday night versus the Kings at the Maverick Center in West Valley City.\nFollowÂ Utah Jazz On SI onÂ FacebookÂ andÂ Twitter/XÂ andÂ Subscribe on YouTubeÂ for breaking Jazz news videos and live streams.",
