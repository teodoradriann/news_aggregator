    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says. The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "Adobe unveils AI tools to enhance Premiere Pro editing",
    "text": "Adobe has launched Generative Extend in Premiere Pro and announced AI-powered Media Intelligence to enhance video editing capabilities.\nGenerative Extend, utilising the Firefly Video Model, allows editors to extend both video and audio clips in 4K and vertical formats, addressing a common issue of incomplete clips and creating seamless transitions. \"We're so excited to see how the Premiere Pro community uses Generative Extend in 4K and AI-powered Media Intelligence to create stories that capture our imaginations,\" said Ashley Still, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Digital Media at Adobe.\nThe Media Intelligence feature enables editors to swiftly locate specific clips within vast amounts of footage, changing the conventional method of manual searching. \"I'm really excited by the AI products that Adobe is developing for filmmakers — especially new features like Media Intelligence, which helps me get to the edit that much faster,\" remarked Ernie Gilbert, filmmaker and editor of \"Opus\".\nAlongside these updates, Adobe introduced AI-powered Caption Translation, allowing captions to be localised in 27 languages, and improvements in Premiere Pro's Colour Management, which facilitates enhanced high dynamic range and standard dynamic range adjustments.\nThe advancements in Adobe's After Effects software include enhanced performance for preview playback, advanced 3D motion design tools, and HDR monitoring. Justin Barnes, Executive Creative Director at Versus Creative Studio, commented on the impact of these tools: \"Adobe's new Firefly-powered video tools like Generative Extend have been transformative for our creative and post-production workflows.\"\nFrame.io V4 also sees significant upgrades with expanded storage capabilities designed to support large creative teams, improving collaboration by allowing extensive media to be managed within a single platform. The inclusion of transcription tools, watermarking, and enhanced access control features further streamline the content creation process.\nThe system becomes more efficient by offering editors automatic clip recognition based on content such as objects and locations, facilitating quicker access to required footage. Experts in the field recognise how these technological improvements can boost productivity by reducing time spent on mundane tasks.\nAdobe's tools continue to be popular among filmmakers. Recent blockbusters such as \"Anora\" and television series \"The Jinx — Part Two\" used Adobe Creative Cloud tools in their production processes. Sean Baker, writer, director, and editor of \"Anora,\" described Adobe Premiere Pro as a versatile tool ideal for both quick edits and complex sequences.",
