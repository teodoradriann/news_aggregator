    "text": "Major Barren County solar project forges ahead\nBARREN COUNTY, Ky. (WBKO) - North Carolina solar energy company Geenex is forging ahead with a major solar farm project in Barren County.\nHow did the project come to be?\nIn 2019, Geenex came to Glasgow asking for approval for this Wood Duck Solar project.\nPlanning & Zoning Director Kevin Myatt said the state’s Public Service Commission Office and the Department of Energy regulate and authorize solar projects like Geenex’s. Solar energy companies like to get local approval to show the state they have done their due diligence adhering to those rules.\nDue to the city being the only one with zoning ordinances, as long as any company with a plan meets the minimum rules for development, they’re approved.\nMyatt said in addition to Geenex going door-to-door when they first introduced the project, the city has held public hearings and meetings about solar farms and alternative energy since 2018. Despite this, several residents around the affected area feel unheard and uninformed.\n“I can certainly sympathize with maybe some of the angst that’s there. Without having zoning in our county, we cannot dictate any use that takes place,” Myatt said. “So hopefully this spurs some discussion with regards to having countywide zoning because in truth, there is no way to stop any kind of development, or even have a say on it, without having county-wide zoning.”\nWhat is the Wood Duck Solar Project?\nGeenex would maintain and protect the 2,300 acres of leased land until they decide to leave. They currently propose putting solar panels on about 1,100 acres of that land.\nThe lease agreements are private contracts between Geenex and landowners. According to their website, these projects can last up to 40 years. Once done, the land goes back to the owner’s control.\nGeenex expects to deliver enough electricity to power the equivalent of 17,000 homes annually depending on the power grid needs. However, those needs may not be locally, so the company can sell this energy in other places.\nBarren County officials say they are making the best of the situation without a county land ordinance, explaining that the community benefits from the tax revenue and donations the company brings in.\n“They even came to me like, ‘How can we get involved in the community?’” Barren County Judge/Executive Jamie Byrd said. “They’ve joined the Chamber of Commerce, they’ve sponsored some events, they did make a donation to Beautify Barren County.”\nAccording to Geenex, the local jurisdiction would receive about $15 million, $11 million of which would go towards the county school system.\nReaction from nearby and affected landowners\nWhile Geenex moves ahead for further approval, community discussion on the project continues.\nOne landowner, Dr. Troy Robertson, would be directly affected by the solar farm. He’s thankful that the development coming in is Geenex.\n“They’re taking good care of us. This is not eminent domain, this is not some fearful terrible power company coming in to take our property,” he said. “This is actually a really good neighbor moving in, and they have an opportunity to generate income, and they’re sharing that opportunity with us.”\nHe even traveled to North Carolina for an event Geenex was holding, where he and his family learned more about their work. Robertson said he trusts that Geenex will honor their land and will further benefit the community.\nHe and Myatt said that people may see some panels when there isn’t as much growth on the trees but they won’t be a disruption.\nHowever WBKO spoke to some residents who weren’t happy with the thought of looking out their window and potentially seeing solar panels instead of woodlands or grassy fields.\nPaula Pedigo, a resident owner near the affected land, said she’s spoken to people concerned with things like the potential health and fire risks, water contamination, property devaluation and the loss of land that, if not used for farming, might displace wildlife.\n“We like our views, we like our land, we like our lakes and we like our ponds and our cattle and our hills and our crops. That’s what Barren County is known for,” she said. “This project’s destroying that, massively.”\nWhile she supports the personal use of solar energy, she believes this mass project is not fit for Barren County’s residential areas.\nAnother landowner next to the proposed affected land said she’s been upset since Geenex knocked on her door. She’s especially worried that the many animals she sees on her property will leave if solar farms are built around the area.\n“I came here for peace and quiet, nature. I’m a nature lover, the land talks to my heart,” Nancy West said. “I’ve been a farmer the majority of my life and this is breaking my heart.”\nAlthough she had one panel on her ranch back in California and loved it, she doesn’t agree with the Wood Duck solar project’s size and believes the project is “pitting neighbors against neighbors, friends against friends.”\nWhat’s next?\nThe project is still pending approval, with Geenex trying to arrange a public hearing with the Public Service Commission.\nCopyright 2025 WBKO.

    "title": "Cult Mentality: SLU Professor Makes Monumental Discovery In Italy",
    "text": "Cult Mentality: SLU Professor Makes Monumental Discovery In Italy\nDouglas Boin, Ph.D., a professor of history at Saint Louis University, made a major announcement at the annual meeting of the Archeological Institute of America, revealing he and his team discovered an ancient Roman temple that adds significant insights into the social change from pagan gods to Christianity within the Roman Empire.\n“We found three walls of a monumental structure that evidence suggests belonged to a Roman temple that dates to Constantine’s period,” Boin said. “It dates to the fourth century AD and it would be a remarkable addition to the landscape of this corner of Italy. It will significantly aid in the understanding of the ancient town, the ancient townscape and city society in the later Roman Empire because it shows the continuities between the classical pagan world and early Christian Roman world that often get blurred out or written out of the sweeping historical narratives.”\nBoin and his excavation team made the monumental discovery over the summer. Boin, an expert in ancient Roman and its religious transitions, had been digging in the town of Spello, the famous medieval hilltop city about 20 minutes from Assisi and 2.5 hours north of Rome. Boin selected the town based on a rescript of a 4th century letter from Emperor Constantine to the townspeople regarding a religious holiday.\nThis rescript, which was discovered in the 18th century, allowed the people of Spello to celebrate a religious festival in their hometown rather than travel a great distance to another festival. However, in order to do so, the town was told it must erect a temple to Constantine’s divine ancestors, the Flavian family, and worship them, showcasing how multicultural Roman society was at the time.\n“There was a remarkable religious continuity between the Roman world and the early Christian world,” Boin said. “Things didn’t change overnight. Before our find, we never had a sense that there were actual physical, religious sites associated with this late ‘imperial cult practice.’ But because of the inscription and its reference to a temple, Spello offered a very tantalizing potential for a major discovery of an Imperial cult underneath a Christian ruler.”\nBoin traveled to Spello and oversaw underground imaging to determine if there were any potential ruins below the surface that needed to be uncovered. After many weeks, and almost by chance, Boin finally received promising images underneath a parking lot where the temple was suspected to be.\nVery carefully, the team dug into the ground until they found two adjoining walls. More digging unearthed what Boin believes to be the inside walls of the temple. This temple immediately became what Boin calls the largest evidence ever of the Imperial Cult in both fourth-century Italy and the late Roman Empire..\n“There’s evidence from other places throughout the Roman world that Christian rulers supported imperial cult practices,” Boin said. “We’ve known that pagans worshiped at their temples in the fourth century, but those findings have all been small and inconsequential. And we’ve known that Christians supported the imperial cult, and we’ve known that without any sense of where it would have happened. This temple bridges those two landmarks, and in that respect, it is unlike any temple that I know about from the Mediterranean world of the fourth century Roman Empire. Any study of the imperial cult in the fourth century Roman Empire is now going to have to take account of this temple, which is an incredible discovery to make.”\nWith the discovery, Boin now can show how the societal changes of the time moved very slowly. Though Constantine was the first Roman emperor to famously convert to Christianity, it would take almost 70 years for Christianity to become the official religion of the Roman Empire, under the Emperor Theodosius. During that time it still took many convincing and gradual shifts for those who worshiped pagan gods to convert to Christianity.\n“This changes everything about how we perceive the pace of social change and our impression of the impact of social and cultural change,” Boin said. “This building, in a very radical way on its own, shows us the staying power of the pagan traditions that had been on the ground for centuries prior to the rise of Christianity, and it shows us how the Roman emperors continued to negotiate their own values, their own hopes and dreams for the future of the emperor and the Empire without knocking down or burying the past.”\nBoin and his team will return to Spello next summer to completely excavate the area to examine the full temple, where he hopes to make even more significant discoveries.\n“We are on the cusp of giving people a very visible piece of evidence that really upends the neat and tidy ways people think about big moments of cultural change,” Boin said “Cultural changes are never as big as we think they are when living through them, and there’s a lot of gray area in between people’s customs and the broader society and culture. And a lot of those can be left out of the story. So to have this temple potentially be a temple dedicated to Constantice’s divine ancestors as a way to worship the emperor in an increasingly Christian world at the time, it’s so weird and I love that we can bring it to light.”",

    "title": "'Maximum Pressure': Trump Unleashes Fresh Sanctions on Iranian Nuclear Program",
    "text": "The Trump administration unleashed another round of sanctions on Iranian entities fueling the country’s illicit nuclear weapons program, ratcheting up pressure on the hardline regime ahead of major diplomatic talks this weekend.\nThe Wednesday sanctions primarily target \"key entities managing and overseeing Iran’s nuclear program,\" including the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) and a subordinate group, the Iran Centrifuge Technology Company (TESA), which manufactures the machines powering Tehran’s uranium enrichment program.\nThe fresh sanctions are the most biting to date and strike at the heart of Tehran’s nuclear industry, effectively choking off its ability to source the materials required for uranium enrichment and the construction of research facilities. They are certain to get the Iranian leadership’s attention ahead of negotiations with the United States on Saturday.\n\"The Iranian regime’s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons remains a grave threat to the United States and a menace to regional stability and global security,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement . \"Treasury will continue to leverage our tools and authorities to disrupt any attempt by Iran to advance its nuclear program and its broader destabilizing agenda.\"\nIran has spent years perfecting its ability to enrich uranium, the key component in an atomic bomb, through advanced centrifuges, which spin the fuel at high speeds to bring it towards weapons-grade levels. The latest sanctions aim to disrupt this activity by targeting the Iran-based Atbin Ista Technical and Engineering Company (AIT), which helps Tehran’s technology sector secure various components from foreign suppliers.\nIranian national Majid Mosallat, who serves as a managing director at AIT, was also hit with sanctions for his role in overseeing \"the purchase and shipment of items to TESA on behalf of AIT,\" according to information provided by the Treasury Department.\nAnother Iranian company, Pegah Aluminum Arak Company, was also designated for manufacturing aluminum products on TESA’s behalf.\nAdditional sanctions target a constellation of companies that feed Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, the main government body \"responsible for research and development activities in the field of nuclear technology, including Iran’s centrifuge enrichment and experimental laser enrichment of uranium programs,\" according to the Treasury Department.\nAround July 2023, the AEOI formed Thorium Power Company and tasked it with developing \"thorium-fueled reactor technologies,\" which help breed a pivotal fissile material known as uranium-233. The company is now formally under U.S. sanctions and will face great difficulties trying to source weapons technology.\nTwo other Iranian companies—the Pars Reactors Construction and Development Company and Azarab Industries Co.—will also face sanctions. Pars acts as an \"AEOI-subordinate\" engaged in a \"number of nuclear reactor projects.\"\nAzarab, the Treasury Department said, acts as a general contractor for the AEOI, helping it construct \"power plant, refinery, petrochemical, and cement projects.\" It also has a contract to produce \"equipment for nuclear power plants.\" The sanctions, like other similar measures, will stop Azarab from sourcing the materials it needs to complete these projects.\nNick Stewart, who served as chief of staff for the State Department’s Iran Action Group during Trump’s first term, said the latest sanctions send \"a powerful and unmistakable message\" to Tehran ahead of diplomatic talks this weekend.\n\"Beyond the practical impact of today’s designations, their timing—on the eve of potential talks in Oman—sends a powerful and unmistakable message: Iran’s nuclear ambitions will not be tolerated, and those who enable them will face severe consequences,\" said Stewart, who is currently the senior director of government relations at FDD Action, an advocacy arm of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank.\n\"With Iran at its weakest point in decades, the United States must recognize the tremendous leverage it holds and press that advantage,\" Stewart said. \"The complete and verifiable dismantlement of Iran’s nuclear program is the only viable path to protect U.S. national security and promote regional stability.\"\nThe bevy of new punitive measures come ahead of what President Donald Trump described earlier this week as a \"very big meeting\" with Iran over its nuclear weapons program. Tehran’s enrichment activities went into overdrive during the Biden-Harris administration, which failed to enforce sanctions on Iran, helping it secure the cash needed to pursue nuclear technology and fund its regional terror proxies.\nTrump entered office pledging to pursue diplomacy with Iran but promising to take military action if Iran balked at direct negotiations. The country’s hardline leadership still maintains that Saturday’s diplomatic détente will occur indirectly, with the two sides speaking through Oman as a mediator. The White House, meanwhile, insists the negotiations will take place directly with Tehran.\nOn Tuesday, shortly after Trump announced the talks, Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araqchi claimed that Washington had agreed to hold indirect negotiations.\n\"As long as ‘maximum pressure’ and threats exist, there is no ground for fair negotiations, and we will not hold direct negotiations,\" Araqchi said .\nTrump, however, described the upcoming meeting differently during a Tuesday press conference with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\"We have a very big meeting on Saturday, and we're dealing with them directly,\" Trump said. \"We are meeting, very importantly, on Saturday at almost the highest level.\"\nShould the talks fail, \"Iran is going to be in great danger.\"",

    "title": "Latin America and the Caribbean Hit with Record-Breaking Heat and Other Climate Effects in 2023",
    "text": "Latin America and the Caribbean Hit with Record-Breaking Heat and Other Climate Effects in 2023 DOMINICA, May 10 (IPS) - Every year for the last four years, a collaborative effort involving scientists and other experts has assessed the state of the climate in Latin America and the Caribbean. The findings have revealed increasingly alarming trends for the world’s second-most disaster-prone region. [The latest report](https://library.wmo.int/records/item/68891-state-of-the-climate-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean-2023) by the [World Meteorological Organization](https://wmo.int/) published on May 8, confirmed that 2023 was the hottest year on record. The Atlantic region experienced a rapid rise in sea levels, surpassing the global average and threatening the coastlines of several small island developing states. The spike in temperatures hit agriculture hard, worsening food insecurity, while wildlife populations suffered. Meanwhile, heavy rainfall triggered floods and landslides, with significant fatalities and economic losses across the region. “In all types of climatic and environmental variables, records were broken during the year 2023. In terms of the amount of heat in the ocean, sea level rise, ice loss in the Antarctic Sea and the retreat of glaciers, Latin America and the Caribbean have been seriously affected by the effects of El Niño, which are of course added to those of climate change induced by human presence,” said Professor Celeste Saulo, WMO Secretary General. The report highlighted Category 5 Hurricane Otis, which hit near Acapulco, Mexico, as one of the strongest hurricanes on record in the Eastern Pacific. It also underscored the impacts of heavy rainfall, such as the deadly landslide in Sao Sebastiao, Brazil, and noted that the Negro River in the Amazon hit record low levels, while low water levels restricted shop traffic in the Panama Canal. “In 2023, around 11 million people in the region were affected by disasters. Out of all these, climate-related disasters were the majority, resulting in over 20 billion US dollars in economic losses,\" Acting Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction, Paola Albrito, told the report’s launch. “We are unfortunately seeing this play out now in Brazil, where devastating floods have taken almost 100 lives and displaced over 160,000 people to date.” Albrito told the launch that in order to meet their commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals, countries must reduce the burden of disasters. “This starts by accelerating the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, in line with the agreed Regional Action Plan, which was updated last year,” she stated. The UN Disaster risk official is calling for integrated disaster risk reduction into development financing to close funding gaps. Presently, just 1% of official development assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean goes towards disaster prevention. She urged countries in this Region to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the UN Secretary General’s [Early Warnings for All Initiative](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/early-warnings-for-all#:~:text=The%20%22Early%20Warnings%20for%20All,by%20the%20end%20of%202027.&text=If%20playback%20doesn't%20begin%20shortly%2C%20try%20restarting%20your%20device.,-More%20videos%20on) to enhance multi-hazard warning systems and emphasized the importance of [heightened collaboration](https://www.undrr.org/news/latin-america-and-caribbean-will-increase-its-disaster-preparedness-through-strengthened) in disaster preparedness and risk management between the European Union and Latin American and Caribbean intergovernmental organizations to improve response mechanisms and enhance resilience to natural disasters. The report acknowledges progress made in using meteorological data for health surveillance, particularly in disease monitoring, citing it as a \"move towards stronger public health strategies.\" The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of this area and the need to address gaps in disease surveillance. “Climate change is a threat to global health that directly and indirectly affects health, well-being, and health equity. It exacerbates existing public health challenges in the Americas, such as food and water insecurity, air pollution, and the transmission of vector-borne diseases,” said Dr. Jarba Barbosa, Director of the Pan American Health Organization. One of Barbosa’s first actions as PAHO Director was the relaunch of an initiative for the elimination of more than 30 diseases and health conditions from countries in the Americas. He says social and environmental conditions contribute significantly to elimination efforts, but climate change continues to challenge experts’ understanding of the epidemiology of many of those diseases. “This is why member states have asked PAHO to develop a new policy to strengthen action of the health sector to respond to climate change with equity. This will be presented to our governing bodies in 2024, so that the Region of the Americas can have climate resilient and low carbon health systems, adopting a climate justice approach to increase equity in health,” he said. The collaborative effort behind the 4th State of the Climate report involved over 30 national meteorological and hydrological services and regional climate centres, 60 scientists and experts and the support of organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization and the Pan American Health Organization. Partners say the report is a valuable resource to enhance regional risk knowledge and provides critical benchmarks for countries to better understand and address the growing climate risks they face.

    "text": "El pamplonica Urko Berrade colocó el triplete en el casillero del Kern Pharma con una victoria en solitario en la decimoctava etapa de la Vuelta disputada entre Vitoria y Maeztu, de 179,3 kilómetros, en la que resistió con el maillot rojo el australiano Ben O'Connor y Mikel Landa se hundió de la quinta a la décima plaza de la general. No hubo dos sin tres y el Kern Pharma, equipo continental que corre como invitado en la Vuelta y que ya tenía dos triunfos con Pablo Castrillo en Manzaneda y Cuitu Negru, hizo el \"hat trick\" con un chico nacido en Pamplona hace 26 años: Urko Berrade, capaz de atacar a 5 km de meta y de llegar en solitario a la pequeña localidad alavesa de Maeztu para celebrar su primer éxito como profesional. Berrade, en presencia de su pareja y familia, salió el la foto del ganador, entrando en meta solo, con un tiempo de 4h.00.52, a una media de 43,3 km/hora. Dejó a sus compañeros de fuga a 4 segundos, con el suizo Mauro Schmide segundo, y otro Kern Pharma tercero, el esprinter Pau Miquel. Fiesta del cuadro navarro a un paso de su casa. Dentro del 'top ten' de la etapa entraron el local Oier Lazkano, Ion Izagirre y Pablo Castrillo. El grupo principal con los favoritos entró en meta a 6.40. Solo faltaba Mikel Landa, quien se dejó 3.20 minutos y descendió al décimo puesto de la general. El gran derrotado de la jornada en su propia casa. Un día más resistió el australiano O'Connor abrazado al maillot rojo, tal vez por último día ante la llegada de las etapas claves de montaña este fin de semana. Momentos decisivos en los que entrará con 5 segundos de ventaja sobre Primoz Roglic, 1.25 respecto a Enric Mas, con Carapaz a 1.46, Gaudu a 3.48 y Carlos Rodríguez es sexto a 3.53. Luz verde de los favoritos a una fuga multitudinaria Etapa cien por cien alavesa, propicia para la fuga, y con opciones para los velocistas con aptitudes escaladoras. De entrada se impuso la primera opción del guión con una expedición masiva de 42 corredores, idónea para que los hombres de la general reservaran fuerzas para un fin de semana explosivo y decisivo con Moncalvillo, Picón Blanco y la crono de Madrid. Delante se metieron el rey del esprint, Kaden Groves, Lazkano, Soler, Castrillo, Herrada, Izagirre, Vlasov, el mejor clasificado a 24 minutos, Narváez, McNulty... un grupo de calidad que poco a poco fue gestionando la victoria entre ellos. La marabunta coronó el Alto de Rivas de Tereso (2a, 11,1 km al 3,4) con 4 minutos de ventaja. El grupo cabecero se fue alterando entre los dos puertos del día. Los suizos Kung y Schmid y el checo Vacek abrieron las hostilidades adelantándose al resto, pero en el ascenso al Puerto de Herrera (1a, 5,6 km al 8,3) los ataques iban cambiando el decorado en cada curva. De nuevo atacó Marc Soler cerca de la cima. El catalán ganador en Lagos de Covadonga coronó en cabeza y se convirtió en nuevo líder de la montaña. Por detrás, en el sector de la alta jerarquía, Carapaz marcó un ritmo que puso contra las cuerdas al líder O'Connor y a Mikel Landa, ambos descolgados. En la bajada O'Connor logró enlazar con Roglic, Mas, Carapaz y Gaudu, no así Landa, en serios apuros y poniendo en peligro la quinta plaza de la general. El EF, Groupama-FDJ y Movistar unieron voluntades para aumentar la pérdida de Landa, que era de 2.30 minutos respecto a los hombres de las general a 15 de Maeztu. Berrade sorprende y logra el triplete del Kern Pharma, Landa se hunde Doce hombres sin piedad delante por el triunfo de etapa en Maeztu, pequeño enclave en el sur alavés, a las puertas del Parque Natural de Izki. Un hombre de la tierra, Lazkano, entre ellos, y ausencia en el grupo que perseguía a 7 minutos de Landa, hundiéndose en casa de manera inexorable. Tenían que llegar los ataques. Cada uno con su carta marcada. La presencia de un esprinter como Pau Miquel invitaba a la mayoría a decidir la etapa en la recta de llegada. Por eso atacó el veterano neerlandés del Visma a 6,5 de meta, sin ningún éxito, ya que salió a su rueda Urko Berrade. Mientras el resto se quedaba mirando, ya con las fuerzas mermadas, el navarro residente en Barcelona, donde trabaja su pareja, y compañero de entrenamientos de Pau Miquel, se lanzó directo a por su estreno como profesional a 5.000 metros de la localidad alavesa. Ya no miró atrás, sacó todo lo que tenía dentro y atravesó la línea brazos en alto culminando la semana fantástica de su equipo y un sueño de esos que persigue cualquier profesional. Berrade se cayó en Eslovenia, pasó el proceso de recuperación, pero su coraje y una concentración en Sierra Nevada le dieron bríos para llegar en forma a la Vuelta. Sigue la fiesta del Kern Pharma, revelación de la Vuelta 2024. Este viernes se disputa la decimonovena etapa entre Logroño y el Alto de Moncalvillo, de 173,2 km. Penúltimo final en alto de la 79 edición de la Vuelta, con el ascenso al pico riojano (1a, 8,6 km al 8,69). Antes, a mitad de recorrido, el Puerto de Pradilla (3a, 5,2 km al 4,8). Jornada no exenta de la posibilidad de sorpresas. Envía tu noticia a: [participa@andaluciainformacion.es](mailto:participa@andaluciainformacion.es)",
