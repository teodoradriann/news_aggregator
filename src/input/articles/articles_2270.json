    "title": "В мире около 100 человек каждый час умирает от одиночества",
    "text": "Примечательно, что чаще всего одиночество ощущают подростки и молодые люди, а также бедные люди, пишет UNIAN .Ежечасно в мире от одиночества умирают около сотни человек. Об этом говорится в свежем докладе Всемирной организации здравоохранения (ВОЗ).В документе отмечается, что от одиночества страдает каждый шестой человек в мире, что влияет на их здоровье. Связанные с одиночеством проблемы вызывают более 871 тыс. смертей в год - это около 100 человек в час.Эксперты ВОЗ детализировали, что одиночество и социальная изоляция повышают риск инсульта, сердечных заболеваний, диабета, снижения когнитивных функций и преждевременной смерти. В ВОЗ подчеркнули, что помимо этого, одинокие люди вдвое чаще впадают в депрессию. Кроме того, одиночество часто приводит к тревожности и негативных мыслях о себе или суициде. Помимо прочего, одиноким людям сложнее получить качественное образование или найти хорошую работу. Примечательно, что чаще всего одиночество ощущают подростки и молодые люди (до четверти всех случаев), а также люди с низким доходом.Среди причин одиночества эксперты выделяют плохое здоровье, низкий доход и уровень образования, недостаточную инфраструктуру и государственную политику, а также усиление роли цифровых технологий. Другие новости об одиночестве В 2023 году ВОЗ объявила одиночество глобальной угрозой для здоровья человечества. Ее пагубное воздействие на человека равноценно выкуриванию 15 сигарет в день.«Одиночество не знает ни возраста, ни границ и становится глобальной проблемой общественного здравоохранения, влияющей на все аспекты здоровья, благополучия и развития», - еще тогда отмечали в организации.​",

    "text": "Human hands slicing tomatoes over a wooden table for a vegan meal\nNew year, new you? Your nutrition can help you not only look but feel better — and experts point to plant-based diets as a health-forward option for 2024 and beyond.\n“Low carbohydrate diets do tend to promote weight loss, but the nutritional value of the diet still really matters. So what you want to be doing is looking for diets that are high in protein and fiber, but you want to be getting those nutrients from plant-based foods more than meat based foods,” says Dr. Céline Gounder, a CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. “When you make those adjustments to your diet, we do see a greater weight loss.”\nVegan diets aren’t the only way to eat plant-based. The Mediterranean diet, for example — which as made headlines for its health benefits — also focuses on whole, plant ingredients. Patterned on the traditional cuisines of the region, the diet emphasizes fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, legumes, nuts and whole grains.\n“This is basically a low carbohydrate diet that’s also low in animal fats and proteins,” Gounder said. “You’re going to have a lot of fish, beans, lentils, whole grains, fruits and vegetables.” She also noted the foods tend to be healthier when flavored with herbs and spices as opposed to salt.\nIs a plant-based diet healthier than meat? In terms of protein, Gounder suggests looking towards more plant-based proteins like beans and lentils as opposed to red meat.\nAnd she offered a word of caution about some meat alternatives made with processed plant proteins.\n“Things like plant based burgers, for example, are getting more and more popular. They are very high protein, but they may also be high in saturated fats,” she explains. “Some of them do have this long list of ultra-processed ingredients, so they may not always be so great for you.”\nIf you are looking for a meat alternative, she suggests looking at the list of ingredients.\n“Maybe something like a very simple black bean burger as opposed to some of the other alternatives,” she suggests. “If you can’t pronounce the words in the list of ingredients, it’s probably ultra-processed.”\nIn general, ultra-processed foods are better avoided, nutrition experts say.\n“You do see an increased risk in high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, even depression with these ultra-processed foods,” Gounder adds.\nPlant-based eating for gut health Experts also point to plant-based diets as a vital component in supporting gut health.\nDr. Aditya Sreenivasan, a gastroenterologist at Lenox Hill Hospital, said the advice is basically simple: “It’s just a matter of quote-unquote ‘being healthier’ and eating a quote-unquote ‘healthy’ diet,” he recently told CBS News. But he admits that it can be “hard to to meet these criteria, especially living in this country.”\nWhat exactly does this way of eating look like?\nFocus on whole plant foods, Dr. Shilpa Ravella, transplant gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University, previously told CBS News.\n“Whole plant foods are incredibly important for gut health because they provide fiber for our gut microbes, and fiber is the most important nutrient for those gut microbes,” Ravella says.\nDespite the importance of fiber in our diets, only about 5% of Americans meet the recommended daily amounts.\n“In this country we unfortunately have a fiber deficiency,” she says. “We need to go beyond those recommended daily amounts for optimal gut health.”",

    "text": "The S&P 500â€™s ( [SPY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY)) nearly daily march higher since Oct. 30, 2023, frustrated perpetual bears. Investors who bought puts to either bet against the market or hedge its rise are at a disadvantage. Those who earned as much as 5.6% in risk-free money market funds are similarly unhappy. Yields on Schwabbâ€™s Value Advantage Money Fund ( [SNAXX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNAXX)) fell to 5.27%, decreasing its attractiveness. Markets latched onto The Federal Reserveâ€™s rate policy inaction. When the central bank planned another 25 basis point interest rate hike in the summer, interest-sensitive assets fell sharply. In the two previous Fed meetings, the Fedâ€™s rate pause unleashed what looks like a market melt-up. The index added 4.87% in the last month alone and is up 24.75% year-to-date. What are three things that investors should do after the S&P 500 defied bears expecting a â€œmassiveâ€� crash? Index investors also should note that Nasdaq ( [QQQ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ)) returned 54.77% year-to-date, matching a performance not seen since 2003. 1. Look at the Top Performers Among the individual holdings, readers should differentiate trades from investments. Trades are speculations that are generally held for the short term. Stock pickers might want to lock in profits on stocks that returned 100% or more. The trade is not yet a profit until sold. In the magnificent seven section, the large market capitalization of security alone does not justify its immunity to a sell-off. Though valuations are unfavorable, fundamentals for Nvidia ( [NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA)) are rising. On its conference call, Nvidia [said that](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4653575-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript) companies like Meta Platforms ( [META](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META)) are in full production with deep learning, recommender systems, and generative AI. Cloud service providers accounted for nearly the other half of Nvidiaâ€™s Data Center revenue. Looking ahead, its H100 Tensor Core GPU instances enjoy high demand amid its general availability. In the table below [compiled from Stock Rover](https://www.stockrover.com/plans/free/?sa_author=diy_value_investing), NVDA stock more than doubled this year. META stock is close to a double return. | | Rank | | Ticker | | Company | | YTD Return | | Contribution | | No. 1 | | ( | | NVIDIA | | 238.60% | | 10.66% | | No. 2 | | ( | | Meta Platforms | | 198.30% | | 6.55% | | No. 3 | | ( | | Royal Caribbean Gr | | 162.30% | | 0.23% | | No. 4 | | ( | | Carnival | | 132.10% | | 0.13% | | No. 5 | | ( | | PulteGroup | | 130.40% | | 0.16% | | No. 6 | | ( | | Advanced Micro Devices | | 126.90% | | 1.65% | | No. 7 | | ( | | Tesla | | 111.80% | | 4.72% | | No. 8 | | ( | | Palo Alto Networks | | 111.90% | | 0.59% | | No. 9 | | ( | | Salesforce | | 101.10% | | 1.61% | | No. 10 | | ( | | Broadcom | | 105.60% | | 2.88% | | No. 11 | | ( | | General Electric | | 96.40% | | 0.84% | | No. 12 | | ( | | Fair Isaac | | 95.10% | | 0.18% | | No. 13 | | ( | | Arista Networks | | 95.20% | | 0.36% | | No. 14 | | ( | | Intel | | 95.30% | | 1.24% | | No. 15 | | ( | | Lam Research | | 91.40% | | 0.62% Above: contribution to the index discussed below. Export control regulations imposed by the U.S. government on sales to China are Nvidiaâ€™s only headwind. Even after warning that â€œsales to these destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter,â€� the stock bounced back from $450 to around $495.00. NVDA stock scores well on all factors except for valuation: In the tourism sector, Royal Caribbean ( [RCL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RCL)) and Carnival ( [CCL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCL)) are the best post-pandemic trades for 2023. Hilton ( [HLT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HLT)) gets an honorable mention, especially when it scores well on growth and profitability. Investors are ignoring the high levels of debt on Royal Caribbean and Carnivalâ€™s balance sheet. The former said that it used its cash flow from operations to cut its [debt by $775 million](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4643919-royal-caribbean-cruises-ltd-rcl-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript). Royal Caribbean expects to pay off more than $3.5 billion in debt, cutting its leverage to the mid four times by the end of the year. Circling back to the top tech performers, readers would not find Arista ( [ANET](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANET)), Salesforce ( [CRM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM)), Broadcom ( [AVGO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO)), and AMD on the list as a surprise. Conversely, Intelâ€™s 95.3% return is unusual. Despite HP Inc. ( [HPQ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ)) and Dell ( [DELL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DELL)) warning of weak PC sales, Intel still rewarded value investors. The firm refreshed its PC CPUs to the 14th generation Meteor Lake line-up. The chips consume more power and run at higher temperatures. In addition, they cost more than the processors offered in the last two generations. Intel benefits from Israel granting $3.2 billion for the [new $25 billion chip facility](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4050249-intel-to-get-32b-grant-from-israel-for-new-25b-chip-facility).

Value hunters should check the value factor grade first. Without fundamental catalysts, however, the rebound may prove short lived. Here are the ratings on a selection of the [worst-performing S&P 500 stocks](https://seekingalpha.com/comparison/new/MCUyQ3NlZGclMkNwZmUlMkNtcm5hJTJDZGclMkNhbGI=?compare=SEDG,PFE,MRNA,DG,ALB): Pfizer, Moderna, and Dollar General ( [DG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DG)) have varyingly strong quant factor grades, as shown above. Albemarle scores well on profitability and growth. However, Albemarle ( [ALB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALB)) stock has a â€œSellâ€� rating.

Allocation Mattered The S&P 500â€™s return this year is a reminder that allocation mattered. Technology companies accounted for nearly two thirds of the indexâ€™s gains. Investors who did not buy tech stocks after they fell in 2022 likely underperformed the market this year. | | Rank | | Ticker | | Company | | Contribution | | No. 1 | | ( | | Microsoft | | 12.39% | | No. 2 | | ( | | Apple | | 11.64% | | No. 3 | | ( | | NVIDIA | | 10.66% | | No. 4 | | ( | | Amazon.com | | 7.76% | | No. 5 | | ( | | Meta Platforms | | 6.55% | | No. 6 | | ( | | Tesla | | 4.72% | | No. 7 | | GOOGL | | Alphabet | | 3.80% | | No. 8 | | GOOG | | Alphabet | | 3.27% | | No. 9 | | ( | | Broadcom | | 2.88% | | No. 10 | | LLY | | Eli Lilly | | 2.13% Looking ahead, if sentiment reverses for tech, investors may want to rotate out of the sector. Still, if companies keep investing heavily in AI solutions, the winners above will keep running higher. Your Takeaway Investors who expected the bear market of 2022 to continue in 2023 missed out on the rebound. The fear of missing out (or FOMO) will run stronger as markets enter 2024. FOMO is one of the highest risks that investors face today. Hopes led to expectations of a rate cut. This is a primary driver of the positive sentiment. Markets are prone to mood change. This typically happens without warning. Investors cannot time markets but they can take some money off the table. While money markets still pay over 5%, the yield is falling as Treasury bond prices fall.

    "text": "LAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - Bird flu has been detected in a backyard flock in Southwest Louisiana after a person exposed to the flock tested positive for the illness.\nThe SWLA resident was the first person in the state diagnosed with H5N1 and became the first person in the U.S. with a severe case of the disease in the current outbreak. They are hospitalized in Louisiana in critical condition, health officials said Wednesday.\nThe patient had been exposed to sick and dead birds in a non-poultry flock, health officials said. The Louisiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory tested the flock after a report of increased mortality.\nThis is the second backyard flock in the state to test positive for avian influenza. The illness was first detected in Bossier Parish , and that flock was depopulated to prevent the continued spread of the disease.\nThe SWLA patient has the first human case of bird flu connected to a backyard flock, CDC officials said. The majority of people infected during this outbreak have been farmworkers in California.\nThe CDC classifies the virus as having a low immediate risk to public health, but people who are exposed to birds or cows are at higher risk for the disease.\nThe Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry provided the guidance below to avoid catching the illness.\nHow to avoid exposure to bird flu The best way to protect yourself and your family from H5N1 is to avoid sources of exposure. That means avoiding direct contact with wild birds and other animals infected with or suspected to be infected with bird flu viruses.\nAnyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. Visit APHIS’ Defend the Flock Resource Center for materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit.\nAt a minimum, poultry flock owners should follow the biosecurity steps on their farms to prevent the spread of the disease. Those steps include:\nLimit, monitor, and record any movement of people, vehicles or animals on or off your farm. Permit only essential workers and vehicles to enter the farm to limit the chances of bringing the virus from an outside source. Avoid visiting other poultry farms and any unnecessary travel off the farm. Disinfect equipment, vehicles, footwear, and other items that come into contact with flocks. Keep your flock away from wild or migratory birds, especially waterfowl. Isolate any ill animals and contact your veterinarian. In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds. Louisiana bird owners should report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state and federal officials, through USDA’s toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. In Louisiana, poultry owners can report to the USDA number or directly to the LDAF Diagnostic Lab at 1-318-927-3441. Anyone wanting to report concerns regarding wild bird mortality should call the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries at 225-765-2800.\nAdditional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov .\nCopyright 2024 KPLC.

    "text": "US approves plan for strikes on Iranian targets The US has approved plans for a series of strikes on Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, officials have told the BBC's US partner CBS News. The strikes will take place over a number of days, officials said, and weather conditions will likely dictate when they are launched. It comes after a drone attack killed three US soldiers in Jordan, close to the Syrian border, on Sunday. The US blamed an Iranian-backed militia group for that attack. That group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, is believed to contain multiple militias that have been armed, funded and trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guards force. It has said it was responsible for Sunday's strike. Iran, meanwhile, has denied any role in the attack which injured 41 other US troops at the military base, known as Tower 22. Four US officials cited by Reuters have said that US intelligence believes that the drone used to attack the facility was manufactured by Iran. At a news conference on Thursday, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said the US would \"not tolerate attacks on American troops\". \"We will take all necessary actions to defend the United States, our interests and our people,\" he said. \"We will respond where we choose, when we choose and how we choose.\" The officials who spoke to CBS News did not give an exact timeline on the potential strikes. They said the US military could launch them in bad weather, but preferred to have better visibility to reduce the risk of inadvertently hitting civilians. President Joe Biden has been under mounting pressure from Republican lawmakers, including some of Washington's most hawkish voices on Iran, to strike targets on Iranian soil. But while the US has repeatedly pledged to respond to the drone attack, Mr Biden and other defence officials have said Washington is not seeking a wider war with Iran or an escalation of tensions in the region. \"That's not what I'm looking for,\" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House earlier this week. The reportedly approved plans appear to keep the targeting to Iranian targets Syria and Iraq, rather than inside Iran.",

    "text": "Feb. 22 (UPI) — After Beijing on Thursday removed and banned Pray.com from the Apple app store in mainland China, the company behind the digital platform for Christian faith-based content said it will look for alternatives to expanding the app’s global reach. The move is in line with China’s strict regulatory policies governing Internet publishing and information sharing in the highly restrictive country. Removing access to the app — which features faith-inspired content, prayer and spiritual community engagement — significantly affects Pray.com’s mission of spreading faith-based messages globally, the app’s creators said. China’s action also means its citizens will no longer be able to access National Day of Prayer activities, one of Pray.com’s most high-profile events, which has featured U.S. presidents, other prominent politicians, and popular Christian musicians. It has drawn audiences as large as 300 million people, according to Pray.com’s website. Company officials say the event has been a pivotal moment for people around the world to be able to join in collective prayer and worship with who they say are the most influential Christians in the United States. “In response to these limitations, our team is exploring alternative avenues to deliver our content and services to people in mainland China,” said Steve Gatena, founder and CEO of Pray.com. “As we work on a solution, I want to personally extend an invitation to President Xi Jinping to join us for this year’s National Day of Prayer event in Washington, D.C.” The move is a shift in previous Chinese policy, which allowed the app to be available in the Communist nation. “Since starting Pray.com we’ve grown accustomed to positive relations with China. President Xi has allowed for the printing of nearly 150 million Bibles per year,” said Pray.com co-founder Michael Lynn. “We are committed to overcoming these barriers to ensure that our global community remains connected and supported, especially during significant spiritual observances such as the National Day of Prayer,” said Matthew Potter, co-founder of Pray.com. The company said that, while it remains committed to improved relations with China and re-establishing the app online while aligning with regulatory requirements in the country, Pray.com will continue to find ways to maintain its core mission to grow faith and cultivate community worldwide.",
