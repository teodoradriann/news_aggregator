    "text": "Formula One Turbocharges November Gaming Revenue to Record High Posted on: December 28, 2023, 05:01h. Last updated on: December 28, 2023, 05:02h. The inaugural Formula One Las Vegas Grand Prix powered gross gaming revenue (GGR) to new highs in November, as statewide win climbed upwards of $1.37 billion. It’s the [best November ever](https://www.casino.org/news/nevada-casinos-post-best-october-ever/) and the state’s second-best month of all-time behind only July 2023 when casinos won a little more than $1.4 billion. F1 was conceptualized as a way to speed up gaming on the Las Vegas Strip during November, traditionally a slow month in Southern Nevada. Despite some local opposition because of months-long road closures and business [disruptions](https://www.casino.org/news/f1-cancels-las-vegas-grand-prix-practice-due-to-loose-manhole-cover/) in the leadup to the Nov. 16-18 race weekend, Las Vegas’ bet seemingly paid off on the Strip casino floors. GGR on the Strip surged almost 23% from November 2022 to $821 million. That’s a new Strip record for November and its second-best month all-time behind this past July when gaming win totaled $834.9 million. F1 fans fancied table games, as costly minimums didn’t faze the European high-end clientele. Felt win on the Strip jumped 62%, with baccarat most responsible as the player-banker card game won over $178.3 million for the house. Slot win dropped about 1.3%, as the international VIPs with deep pockets didn’t fancy the one-armed bandits nearly as much as the tables. Slot revenue on the Strip totaled $410.9 million. F1 Delivers for Strip Despite [many headaches for locals](https://www.casino.org/news/is-f1-worth-it-to-las-vegas-and-what-does-that-question-even-mean/) and general visitors who were barred from seeing attractions like the Bellagio fountains and were quickly escorted by security when they stopped on Strip overpasses for photos, Michael Lawton, the senior economic analyst for the Nevada Gaming Control Board, says the city’s bet on F1 was a winning gamble. Along with a November to remember on the casino floors, Strip resorts reported strong hotel bookings and subsequent [resort-wide business](https://www.casino.org/news/mgm-cfo-halkyard-says-f1-race-broke-revenue-records/). The four-day period beginning on Nov. 16 was extremely profitable for both gaming and non-gaming activity on the Las Vegas Strip with some properties estimating those days established all-time record levels of revenue,” said Lawton. Lawton conceded that [luxury properties](https://www.casino.org/news/las-vegas-strip-non-gaming-revenue-looks-sturdy/) where F1 fans stayed and gambled were the biggest benefactors. While the Strip was bustling, the downtown area where more budget-conscious travelers tend to stay saw November GGR dip 2% to $81.2 million. Table games downtown reported a nearly 7% drop in win from November 2022, as the lower-minimum games were less busy. Downtown casinos also weren’t as lucky, as the table game win rate was just 7.6% compared to 15% on the Strip. 2023 Record Year Nevada gaming revenue through 11 months in 2023 totaled [more than $14.08 billion](https://www.casino.org/news/nevada-casinos-win-14b-2022-set-all-time-record/). The odds are nearly a sure thing that when December’s numbers come in, 2023 will mark the third consecutive year of record gaming win in the Silver State. Nevada casinos won $14.84 billion in 2022. It followed the $13.42 billion haul gamblers lost in 2021 following the COVID-19 pandemic. The record play in 2021 and last year was partially credited to pent-up demand for leisure travel and many US residents having some extra disposable income from coronavirus stimulus programs. 2023, however, seemingly most demonstrates the resiliency of the US gaming industry, as its marquee and most critical market nears its third record year in a row.

    "text": "unsplash.com\nМедицинские специалисты поделились рекомендациями о том, что не стоит делать людям старше 60 лет, когда они ложатся спать. Некоторые привычки могут негативно сказаться на здоровье, особенно в этом возрасте, когда позвоночник становится более уязвимым, а давление может колебаться.\nПервая вредная привычка — это сон на животе. Такая поза создает дополнительную нагрузку на шею и поясницу, что может привести к болям.\nВторая привычка — использование высокой подушки. Подушка должна поддерживать правильное положение головы и шеи во время сна. Кроме того, если подушке больше трех лет, в ней могут скапливаться пылевые клещи и аллергены.\nТретья привычка — держать телефон в кровати. Если устройство заряжается под головой, это может представлять опасность, превращая вашу постель в потенциально рискованное место.\nЧетвертая привычка — резкие подъемы с кровати. Переход из горизонтального положения в вертикальное может вызвать падение давления, что чревато головокружением и даже падениями.\nПятая привычка — завтрак в постели. Это может привести к нескольким проблемам: риск подавиться, изжога и недостаточное пережевывание пищи.\nСпециалисты рекомендуют людям в возрасте беречь свои силы, включая эмоциональные. Спокойный вечер и качественный сон — это лучший подарок для вашего сердца, памяти и душевного состояния, как сообщает дзен-канал «Просто о жизни и воспитании».\nДанные о правообладателе фото и видеоматериалов взяты с сайта «Наш Крым» , подробнее в Правилах сервиса Источник: Наш Крым Темы: Здоровье , Лайфхак",

    "text": "COLLEGE STATION, Texas – A freshman at Texas A&M is now $50,000 richer after nailing a field goal.\nLucas Dolibois, a first-year business major and lifelong Aggies fan, was picked out of a lottery to take part in ESPN’s ‘College GameDay’ pre-show.\nA segment in the show includes analyst Pat McAfee, a former kicker with the Indianapolis Colts, offering up big time cash if someone in the crowd can make a field goal.\nDolibois did just that.\nThe Houston native played soccer at Bellaire High School, but never had a more important kick in his life.\n“My hands are like, shaking,” he told KPRC 2′s Gage Goulding. “I was more nervous when I got selected than when I was taking the kick.”\nPat McAfee: “Now we got Lucas Doliboi here, who’s a freshman high school soccer player. Have you ever said anything terrible about a kicker before?”\nLucas Doliboi: “Horrible. Like kicking is so easy.”\nPat McAfee: “Why is that? Because you’re a high school soccer player.”\nLucas Doliboi: “Just like I could. I keep thinking I can make this. I can make this. I could go out right now [and] make a 45-yarder.”\nIt was big-time trash talk on national TV, the biggest stage for any kicker.\nPat McAfee: “All right, Lucas. Any final words before you shank one into somebody’s face?”\nLucas Doliboi: “Beat the hell out of Notre Dame.”\nHis kick... Well, it came up short.\nBut Aggieland wasn’t letting that go. And neither was Pat McAfee.\n“This one will be for $50,000,” McAfee said after crowds chated ‘One more time!’\nLucas got one more shot, double or nothing, and he NAILED it.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by College GameDay (@collegegameday)\n“I’m still, like, kind of on the high from it,” Dolibois said. “It’s it’s still crazy. Like, I’ll still have people come up to me and ask me, ‘Hey, are you the kicker?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, that’s me.’”\nNow with $50,000 hanging around in his bank account, the freshman has a plan with the money, and it’s not for college.\nHouston native Lucas Dolibois standing with ESPN's 'College GameDay' host Pat McAfee and comedian Shane Gillis after he kicked a field goal to win $50,000. (Copyright 2024 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.) “I think of what my family and I decided on because we already have college kind of budgeted out,” he said. “Which I’m really blessed to have been able to do. I think what we’re going to do is we’re going to put a lot of the money into a retirement or an investment fund and just kind of let the money grow over time.”\nAs for his future goals in life, this couldn’t be a better start to his college career.\nDolibois says he wants to work in the front office of a professional sports team.\n“I’m hoping that maybe I can parlay some of that into an internship or something at ESPN or something of the sorts, because that would really help me jumpstart that dream to becoming a sports business man and whatnot,” he said.\nCopyright 2024 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.",

    "text": "KALAMAZOO, MI -- Troy Leslie was sitting in his truck not far from the Kalamazoo Gospel Mission when he smelled smoke.\nA few seconds later, his Ford pickup truck was engulfed in flames.\n“I got my license back (reinstated), I got into that truck and now it’s gone,” Leslie said.\nLosing the truck he got four months ago is a massive setback for Leslie. He worked hard to save for the truck and was now saving for an apartment.\nOfficers responded to 448 N. Burdick St. just after 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, April 9, where the truck was fully engulfed in flames. Black smoke and large orange flames could be seen for several blocks.\nAfter the fire was extinguished, the entire front dash was melted. Most of the contents -- aside from a neon yellow pair of towing cables in the bed -- were destroyed.\n“I don’t know why (I should) even bother anymore,” Leslie said, sitting in another truck parked near the remains of his own.\nLeslie was sitting in the front seat of his truck smoking a cigarette when he noticed a smoky smell coming from the hood.\n“It smells like someone’s burning copper wire,” Leslie said he told his friend, Will.\nLeslie opened the hood and was met with bright orange flames. They tried to douse the flames with the sodas they were drinking. Leslie also tried to snuff out the flames with a blanket, he said.\nThe flames spread so fast, Leslie didn’t even have time to grab his wallet, which he’d left on the dash. Officers couldn’t find the wallet, which Leslie said was attached to a silver Harley Davidson keychain.\nLeslie was preparing to move into a new apartment, he said. In the truck’s bed, he had a new TV stand and coffee table as well as clothes he had ordered.\n“I wanted to be comfortable in my apartment when I moved in,” Leslie said. “I haven’t been blowing my money.”\nLeslie had also invested heavily in the truck itself, including installing a $300 stereo, he said.\nHe’s faced numerous setbacks in the process of saving, he said. At one point, his checking account was compromised, he said.\nLeslie said he’d been behind on his telephone bill and insurance payments, but had just paid off two payments for the truck.\nLeslie was taken to the hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation.\n“Every time I try to get ahead,” there’s another setback, Leslie said.",

    "text": "SEOUL, Nov 29 (Bernama-Yonhap) -- The No 3 labour union of Seoul Metro, the operator of subway lines 1-8 in South Korean capital, Seoul, threatened Friday to stage a full-scale strike next week in demand of better pay and new staff hiring, Yonhap news agency reported.\nThe union, made up mostly of employees in their 20s and 30s, announced the plan during a press conference in front of City Hall, raising concerns of simultaneous strikes by two of the company's three labour unions, including the No. 1 union that represents 60 per cent of the work force.\nBoth strikes are set to take place next Friday.\nOther unionised workers have also threatened collective action in recent days, including those of KTX and regular train operator Korea Railroad Corp (KORAIL), who plan to launch an indefinite strike next Thursday.\nSome members of the Cargo Truckers Solidarity, the National Pension Service, and Korea Gas Corp, have also said they are preparing to walk out.\n-- BERNAMA-YONHAP\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial",
