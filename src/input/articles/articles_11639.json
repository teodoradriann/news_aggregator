    "text": "Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra could be more expensive due to higher production costs: What buyers should know\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra might have a higher bill of materials, which could make it significantly more expensive than the current flagship, the Galaxy S24 Ultra\n[Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-price-in-india-P999938661) is expected to be Samsung's next flagship phone and is likely to be released alongside the standard Samsung Galaxy S25 and the [Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-price-in-india-P999938702). While the South Korean giant could be planning big things for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, there could also be a potential price hike. Considering the number of improvements the device will bring, this is expected to increase the bill of materials, which could make it significantly costlier than the current flagship, the Galaxy S24 Ultra.\nGalaxy S25 Ultra Could Be More Expensive To Make\nThe S25 Ultra is expected to cost more to make, based on a post by tipster SetsunaDigital. The bill of materials (BOM) for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will likely be at least $110 (about ₹9,200) more than the [Galaxy S24 Ultra](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-price-in-india-P999937438). What this means, simply put, is that the S25 Ultra will cost Samsung ₹9,200 more to make.\nThis price increase could translate into a higher cost for consumers in select markets. It's worth noting that the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra currently has an MRP of ₹1,29,999, and a price increase would make it even more expensive. In fact, it could approach the price of the iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, the tipster also mentioned that Samsung may not raise the price of the S25 Ultra in China, where the base model is expected to retail for the same price as the S24 Ultra, i.e., CNY 9,699.\nOther Reports Have A Different Story To Tell\nAlternatively, reports from various tipsters have suggested that Samsung may not increase the price of the S25 series at all, thanks to Apple maintaining the same pricing for the iPhone 16. The reports indicate that the Samsung Galaxy S25 could start at $799 for the base model, the S25 Plus could cost $999, and the Samsung S25 Ultra could begin at $1,299.\nThis could also be the case in India, as Samsung previously reduced the prices of the S24 Ultra after the[ iPhone 16 Pro](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/apple-iphone-16-pro-price-in-india-P999938220) launched with a more aggressive price tag. This price cut was aimed at boosting sales and capturing a share of the Apple user base, preventing users from swaying towards Apple’s “walled garden\".\nThis suggests that the price may not increase in regions like India and the US, but it remains to be seen what ultimately Samsung decides. For context, the base model of the Galaxy S24 Ultra is priced ₹10,000 more than the iPhone 16 Pro base model (which retails for ₹1,19,900), although it can be found at a much cheaper price during sales.\n[News](https://www.hindustantimes.com)/\n[Technology](https://www.hindustantimes.com/technology)/ Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra could be more expensive due to higher production costs: What buyers should know",

    "text": "Linda Hamilton Praises Resident Alien Showrunner and Co-Star Alan Tudyk The Terminator and Chuck star is happy to be on board Syfy's weird, silly Alan Tudyk show. [Resident Alien](/category/resident-alien-tvshow/) has become the most recent fan-favorite genre show to recruit legendary sci-fi actor [Linda Hamilton](/category/linda-hamilton/) -- and she seems pretty tickled about that. Speaking with ComicBook.com about the show's currently-ongoing third season, Hamilton praised both showrunner Chris Sheridan and series star Alan Tudyk, suggesting that while she doesn't like to watch her own performances, she can get some fun out of Resident Alien thanks to Tudyk and Sheridan, who keep her on her toes. Hamilton is sometimes worried about her ability to keep up with Alan Tudyk's comic genius, but otherwise, she seems fully on board with the show, in which she plays a general deeply involved with the American response to alien threats. \"Chris Sheridan is a really, really amazing writer. I really do want to just give him a big plug everywhere I go,\" Hamilton said. \"He's just amazing -- that he can write something that is funny and offbeat, and yet cuts right to the quick of deeper, philosophical questions, and what is humanity? Is humanity worth saving? And then, to switch right back into a funny moment. He's very gifted.\" There was a tiny bit of critique in her love for Tudyk -- but only a tiny bit. \"It's a little more complex, working with Alan, for me. I don't really have the comedy chops,\" Hamilton said. \"I'm not the funny girl, I'm the straight man, but comedy is timing, right?\" Hamilton said. \"And he will just improvise, or add something. You don't know when he's done. When are you allowed to talk? It's a subtle dynamic, but it has to work between two actors to make a scene funny. He's fine! He's funny, but I will sit there sort of like...that was so funny that once in a while, I've forgotten to be the General, and this look of 'Oh, he's adorable' will come across my face. My face says everything it feels -- I'm not sure that's a great thing -- so that appreciation for him will flicker across my face while I'm acting and it's like, 'Well, I've got to erase that,' but he's just a pleasure to watch, and to work with.\" Of course, when we pointed out that she's a great straight man who enhances the comedy quite a bit, Hamilton had to admit that since Sheridan agreed with us, and she hasn't watched the show, she basically has to concede the point. In the third season of Resident Alien, Harry (Tudyk) is determined to save the Earth from a coming invasion from a competing alien race. That sets up a fundamentally different dynamic for the former world conqueror, and represents the latest evolution of Harry's character. Resident Alien airs on Wednesday nights at 10 p.m. ET/PT on Syfy. [0comments](#)",
