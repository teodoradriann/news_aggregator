    "text": "Central de Trabajadores rechaza intenciones de Peña de eliminar estabilidad laboral\nLa Central Nacional de Trabajadores (CNT) rechaza las intenciones del gobierno de Santiago Peña de eliminar la estabilidad laboral que rige en Paraguay desde los 10 años de antigüedad. Las centrales obreras convocan a una plenaria para coordinar un posicionamiento conjunto.\nLas declaraciones de Santiago Peña frente a los empresarios en la ExpoNegocios causaron una indignación generalizada de los trabajadores. No solo anunció que presentará un proyecto de ley de reforma laboral, sino que, además, dio a entender que eliminará la estabilidad que rige actualmente a partir de los 10 años de antigüedad.\n“Nosotros tenemos una posición ya definida que es el rechazo a esta propuesta”, advirtió al respecto Ramón Ávalos, representante de la Central Nacional de Trabajadores (CNT) en NPY.\nLea más:\nPara Peña, la estabilidad laboral “condena al trabajador paraguayo a no jubilarse”\nEl dirigente comentó que ya conversó con las demás centrales y se prevé una plenaria el próximo martes para publicar un posicionamiento en conjunto.\nConsidera que hay una visión común de rechazar las intenciones de Peña y convoca a los trabajadores, sean o no sindicalizados, a estar en alerta para salir a las calles.\nÁvalos comentó que la propuesta de eliminar la estabilidad laboral es una discusión que ya planteaban las patronales y que las centrales nunca cedieron, ahora ve con preocupación el anuncio de un proyecto que no fue socializado con el sector.\n“Acá hay una cuestión de fondo, el Gobierno se quiere congraciar con un sector cercano a ellos y busca con esto cercenar el derecho a los trabajadores”, cuestionó.\nPara el dirigente “es un atentado contra el trabajador” y trató al presidente de “infantil” cuando argumenta que la estabilidad va en detrimento de la jubilación porque en general los trabajadores, supuestamente, buscan ser despedidos para cobrar la indemnización.\nLea también:\nSantiago Peña busca modificar el Código Laboral para generar 500.000 empleos\nSobre este punto, el sindicalista refirió que el Código del Trabajo es claro con relación a los derechos y obligaciones. En ese sentido, el empleado tiene las herramientas para desvincular al personal que no está cumpliendo con su contrato, refiriéndose al juicio que se contempla para estos casos.\nAdemás, recordó las prácticas a las que recurren los empleadores al obligar a sus trabajadores a renunciar antes de los 10 años y volver a contratarlos después de tres meses, con el objetivo de no pagarle la indemnización y que tampoco alcancen la estabilidad laboral con todos sus beneficios.\nAsimismo, comentó la responsabilidad que tienen las centrales obreras ante este anuncio. “No podemos dejar pasar esto y ser responsables en la historia de una pérdida de un derecho fundamental, el derecho humano de los trabajadores, que es la estabilidad laboral”, advirtió.\nDe las ocho centrales obreras reconocidas por el Ministerio del Trabajo, cinco mantienen una articulación para coordinar acciones sobre políticas públicas.",

    "text": "You have a friend in Jesus Flat tires are no fun. I had a rash of them ten years ago. Every time I turned around I had to either inflate the tire, get it patched or replaced. I thought about that when I saw a man with his car up on a jack. I was in a hurry with one of my flats. I drove the car to the gas station with the front driver's side tire nearly deflated. That's when I noticed a screw embedded in the tread. When I told my wife about the tire she quickly accused me of driving somewhere I shouldn't have. The truth is that when bad things happen to you, it doesn't mean that you deserve it. Sometimes bad things happen to good people. Rabbi Harold Kushner wrote the book on it. He concluded that bad things are as much a part of our human experience as are the good things. We live in a fallen world. Sometimes we bring things on ourselves by the things we do. The Apostle Paul writes about our tendency to fall into bad habits without even thinking. He says in Romans 7, \"I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but I do what I hate to do...\" Does that sound familiar? I think we can relate to that. Just ask someone who has tried to lose weight about their experience. Speak to someone who has tried to quit smoking. They will tell you how often they end up sabotaging themselves. Trials and temptations are all real and they are everywhere. Put a plate of cookies in front of me and you can guess what happens? So what do you do? You face your trials head on. Too often, we avoid the problems instead of dealing with them. We hope they will go away on their own. The good news is that we don't have to confront them alone. Jesus said he would be with us. When we are feeling overwhelmed we can call on him in prayer. He will stand beside us as we confront our challenges. As we get ready to enter a new year, don't just make some resolutions to try harder. Call on Jesus to give you what you need. I love the James Taylor song, \"You've Got A Friend.\" When I hear that song, I think of Jesus. He is that kind of friend. I know that wherever I am, all I got to do is call his name and he'll be there. The Apostle Paul tells us that we can do all things through Christ who gives us strength. He may not fix a flat tire for you or me. But he will be there to see us through. Praise God! Happy New Year. See you in church.",

    "text": "Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, released a strong\nend-of-year report showing growth in customers despite massive fines being levied against the company in the U.S. and the November resignation of its CEO and co-founder Changpeng Zhao, who pled guilty in the U.S. to a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act and is awaiting trial in February.\nBinance said it saw an influx in 2023 of 40 million users, growing its customer base by 30% to 170 million registered users. Its peer-to-peer platform, where users directly trade crypto with other Binance users, processed 18% more trades than last year, and served 39% more users.\nBinance’s proof-of-reserves system holding crypto in reserve for customers increased the number of supported assets from nine in 2022 to 31 in 2023.\nThe crypto exchange reported spending $213 million in 2023 on compliance technology, processes, and talent, up 35% from last year.\nGovernance Changes\nPutting a positive spin on its legal troubles and chief executive’s woes, Binance wrote, “This year, our organization took responsibility for historical issues and has evolved through leadership change, emerging from it an even stronger business.” The company described changes to its governance, including that “[a] board of at least three independent directors, accountable to all stakeholders, will be the steward and governing body of the organization.”\nFinally, it noted that “U.S. agencies did not allege that Binance misappropriated any user funds, or engaged in any market manipulation.”\nEarlier in December, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ordered Binance and Zhao to pay a combined\n$2.7 billion in fines to the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission for violating the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations.\nThat follows a November settlement in which Binance agreed to a\n$4.3 billion fine to resolve a U.S. Department of Justice criminal investigation, and Zhao agreed to step down as CEO. However, the legal battle between Binance and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) still remains unresolved.",

    "text": "More on KentOnline Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”",

Teammates Amelia Adiutori fired the only shot on goal for the hosts.\n\"We had a slow start, everything that we talked about before the game, that we wanted to execute, did not happen,\" said Head Coach Kristi Huizenga. \"It got better at halftime, but we obviously didn't take care of what we needed to do.\"\nColgate got off to a hot start, scoring in the 6th minute when Paige Foa set up Cate Childers for her first goal of the season. Maya Greenholz was also credited with an assist on the place.\nDuring the next 15 minutes Vermont’s Jill Brody unleashed two shots, while teammate Sydney Remington created a shot of her own. Luckily for Colgate, the scoring bids narrowly missed the target.\nThe Raiders doubled their lead in the 50th minute when Ari Bezanson sent a shot past multiple defenders. The ball landed in the bottom-right corner to give Colgate a two-goal cushion.\nThree minutes later Jordan Juetten made it 3-0 after being fed the ball from Ellie Stokes in front of a wide-open net. Juetten finished the job to make the Cats’ comeback attempts even more difficult.\nIn the 77th minute UVM’s Lauren DeGroot broke free and found herself all alone with just the goalkeeper to beat. But she placed her shot just high of the net, keeping Vermont off the scoreboard.\nAubrey Bough had two opportunities in the 85th and 86th minute to give the Catamounts their first goal, but both shots missed the mark as Colgate (1-2-1) closed out the shutout at Virtue Field.\nEmma Warren played all 90 minuts for the Catamounts, who fall to 1-1-2. The Cats will finish their four-game homestand against Fairleigh Dickinson University on Sunday, The matchup with FDU will serve as the Catamounts’ annual Youth Day. Children 12-and-younger will be granted free admission upon arrival while tickets last. There will be lawn games, face painting, a bounce house, arts and crafts and more activities starting at noon.\nMEN’S SOCCER\nVermont 1, UC Irvine 1\nIRVINE, Calif. – Goalie Lou Liedtka's save on a penalty kick in the 89th minute allowed the Cats to secure a 1-1 tie Thursday night at Anteater Stadium.\nVermont finished the night with a 17-15 edge in shots, with seven directed on goal. The Catamounts tallied 11 of their shots in the second half. UVM took11 corner kicks, compared to UC Irvine’s eight corners. Both teams now stand at 0-1-1.\nCatamounts star Yaniv Bazini recorded a game-high five shots in 78 minutes of action. He directed three shots on goal. Teammates David Ismail, Jeremy Tsang, and Ryan Zellefrow each had two shots.\n\"We played another excellent opponent who was very well-coached,\" Vermont coach Rob Dow said. \"Progress was made from Game 1 to Game 2. To win on the road against top opponents, we must be more relentless in our attack.\"\nLiedtka (seven saves) was tested early by a shot from Francesco Montanile that was directed toward the lower-right corner in the fourth minute. The UVM goalkeeper also denied a long-range shot from Samuel Atiye minutes later.\nVermont’s Nick Lockermann's inswinger in the 11th minute bounced around the UCI box, ending with a Niels Hartman shot that was blocked.\nMax Murray nearly scored his first goal of the season in the 24th minute when Nathan Simeon's cross found the 6-foot-5 forward sprinting toward the front of the goal. Murray's kick while in stride missed over the top of the bar as the game remained scoreless.\nUC Irvine held the edge in shots (3-2) over the remainder of the opening half. Agaton Pourshahid's shot in the 26th minute forced Liedtka to make his third and final save of the first half.\nBazini broke the scoreless tie in the 64th minute when he capitalized on a failed clearance by a UCI defender and quickly found the back of the net. The goal was his second in as many games as Vermont took a 1-0 lead.\nBazini came close to doubling the lead minutes later when he dribbled through traffic and fired a shot toward the upper right corner, but he was denied by UC Irvine goalie Alex Shields (four saves).\nMarcus Lee notched the equalizer for UC Irvine in the 80th minute when he collected a rebound in the 18-yard box, took a touch and fired a shot into the uppe-left corner. Isaac Powell was credited with an assist on the goal that made the score 1-1.\nThe Catamounts had an 18-yard scoring chance a few minutes later, but the shot toward the top shelf was turned away by Shields. The game closed with a chaotic final few minutes, beginning with a red card served to UCI's Nolan DiCenzo in the 88th minute. Less than a minute later, a Vermont foul in its own 18-yard box led to the penalty kick that was denied by Liedtka.\nVermont concludes its West Coast trip at 1o p.m. Monday with a match vs. San Diego State at Snapdragon Stadium.",

    "text": "A luxury cruise ship rescued 68 migrants attempting to reach the Spanish Canary Islands in a fishing boat that had stalled in rough seas, as reported by Spanish authorities and the cruise operator on Thursday, June 20.\nTragically, 6 individuals perished in the incident.\nThe Canary Islands have become a primary entry point for migrants from Africa attempting to reach Spain, with this route being notably perilous. Migration rights group Walking Borders reported last week that ~5,000 migrants died at sea on this route during the first 5 months of 2024.\nThe bulk carrier Philipp Oldendorff initially sighted the adrift boat 440 nautical miles (815 km) south of\nTenerife on Wednesday, June 19, providing initial assistance to the migrants. The Insignia cruise ship was then diverted to the area to rescue the survivors, according to a statement by the Spanish Coast Guard.\nThe Insignia, operated by\nMiami-based Oceania Cruises, also recovered 3 bodies from the boat. Due to adverse weather conditions, the recovery of another two bodies was not possible, so a locating device was left to aid in their retrieval.\nThe Insignia, a small luxury cruise ship with a capacity of 670 passengers, is currently on a 180-day\nworld voyage that commenced in January.\nFor more Oceania Insignia incidents and accidents see the ship's\nCruiseMinus page.",

    "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa — The data is official now: Des Moines experienced unusual warmth and a severe lack of snow in December 2023. The average temperature in December 2023 was 37.4° at Des Moines International Airport, which is a whopping 9.7° above the norm of 27.7°. 37.4° is enough to put December 2023 in second place on the list of warmest Decembers on record in Des Moines. According to the [National Weather Service in Des Moines](https://twitter.com/NWSDesMoines/status/1742193780059758990), this comes up just shy of the warmest December on record, December 1889, which reported an average temperature of 39.5°. Perhaps even more impressive, Des Moines had only one day in December with a high temperature below 32°, which actually occurred on the last day of the month, New Year's Eve. In an average year, Des Moines has at least 10 days of maximum temperatures below freezing each December. It was also the only December on record that Des Moines did not measure a temperature of at least 14° or colder in December. For reference, the coldest temperature all month was just 17°. We hardly had any snow in December, either. Des Moines recorded 0.2 inches of snow all month, which is 7.7 inches below the monthly average. It was the third least snowy December on record, only recording more snow than 1889 and 2002, respectively (there was no snow at all in Des Moines in December 2002). Through Jan. 2, 2024, Des Moines has only measured 2.8\" of snow for the entire winter season. This is close to a foot below average to date. Moving forward, the pattern favors a more active storm track and colder temperatures near the middle of January. Although the exact outlook is still hazy for Des Moines and central Iowa during that timeframe, it seems winter will try to make itself more obvious in the upcoming weeks. Keep in mind, that severe drought is still widespread across central Iowa. Whether you're on \"team snow\" or \"team dry winter,\" there's no denying we are in desperate need of moisture.",
