    "title": "Trabalhadores da Boeing rejeitam proposta de reajuste e aprovam greve",
    "text": "13/09/2024 - 7:33\nFuncionários da Boeing votaram e aprovaram na quinta-feira, 12, a greve e rejeição de contrato com a empresa que agora sofre outro revés. Com a reputação e finanças abaladas, a empresa enfrenta agora a uma paralisação na produção de seus aviões de maior sucesso.\nA Associação Internacional de Maquinistas e Trabalhadores Aeroespaciais disse que 94,6% dos trabalhadores votantes rejeitaram o contrato, que aumentaria os salários em 25% ao longo de quatro anos, e 96% aprovaram a greve – superando facilmente o requisito de dois terços.\nA greve de 33.000 maquinistas estava marcada para começar um minuto depois da meia-noite de sexta-feira, 13. “Isto é sobre respeito, isto é sobre o passado e isto é sobre lutar pelo nosso futuro”, disse o presidente do Distrito 751 do IAM, Jon Holden, ao anunciar a votação.\nA Boeing não comentou imediatamente sobre a votação.\nPouca coisa deu certo para a empresa neste ano, desde um painel que explodiu e deixou um buraco enorme em um de seus jatos de passageiros em janeiro até a Nasa deixar dois astronautas no espaço em vez de mandá-los para casa em uma nave espacial Boeing com problemas.\nEnquanto a greve durar, ela privará a Boeing do dinheiro muito necessário que a fabricante obtém com a entrega de novos aviões para as companhias aéreas. Esse será outro desafio para o novo CEO Kelly Ortberg , que há seis semanas recebeu a tarefa de recuperar uma empresa que perdeu mais de US$ 25 bilhões nos últimos seis anos e ficou atrás da rival europeia Airbus.",

    "text": "Mayotte L'archipel en alerte rouge cyclonique ce soir, des vents de 180 km/h attendus\nEn raison du passage du cyclone Chido, l'archipel est en alerte rouge ce vendredi soir à partir de 22h (20h à Paris). Le préfet appelle les habitants mal-logés à se rendre dans les centres d'hébergement du département.\nL'archipel de Mayotte sera placé en alerte rouge cyclonique ce vendredi à 22h (20h à Paris) en raison du passage du cyclone Chido, a annoncé le préfet de ce département français dans l'océan Indien. « C'est un événement inédit, d'une extrême violence, les vents pourront dépasser 180 km/h », a expliqué François-Xavier Bieuville lors d'une conférence de presse.\nLe préfet a appelé les personnes logées dans des habitations précaires, très nombreuses dans le département le plus pauvre de France, à se confiner dans l'un des 71 centres d'hébergement ouverts par les autorités. Ces centres, situés dans les établissements scolaires et gymnases, « seront ouverts à tous », a-t-il assuré.\nRafales, pluies intenses et vagues submersives\nLe cyclone Chido, qui se situe actuellement à environ 500 km au nord-est de Mayotte, est un « cyclone tropical intense » explique Météo-France, qui prévoit « de violentes rafales de vents, des pluies intenses, des vagues submersives couplées à une surélévation de la mer ». Ces conditions météorologiques fortement dégradées entraînent « un risque de ruissellement et d'inondation, et une houle marine qui peut avoir des effets importants sur le littoral » a ajouté François-Xavier Bieuville, qui a enjoint les bateaux à « impérativement rejoindre la terre ferme ».\nAéroport et écoles fermés\nToute circulation sur la voie publique sera interdite à partir de 22 heures et l'aéroport de Dzaoudzi sera fermé à partir de 20 heures (18h heure de Paris), a précisé le préfet. La dernière barge, qui relie Dzaoudzi à Mamoudzou, partira à 17 h 30. Le ministère de l'Intérieur avait annoncé jeudi l'envoi à Mayotte de 110 professionnels de la sécurité civile depuis l'île de La Réunion. Tous les établissements scolaires de l'archipel sont fermés vendredi et samedi.\nL'archipel de Mayotte, relativement épargné par les cyclones, avait déjà été touché par le cyclone Belna en 2019, qui n'avait cependant pas fait de dégât majeur.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "Owners nowadays treat their pets like children, so it may come as no surprise that one man has allowed his dog to choose his own toy.\nThe heartwarming video shared to a page dedicated to Jack Daniels, the Shiba Inu dog, (@jack_inthemarsh) has racked up 10.2 million views.\nThe footage shows Jack sitting in the Lowes shopping trolley before being asked if he wants a toy by his owner who is behind the camera. The dog then leans forward and carefully carries out a sniff test to find the appropriate stuffed toy.\nAt the time of writing, the video has received over 475,000 likes and over 1,300 comments, with many people saying they aren’t surprised he chose a blue toy.\nOne comment said: “Lol literally the only one he can see.”\nThis is because blue is one of the few colors that dogs can distinguish, according to the American Kennel Club. The AKC website states that scientists believe that a dog’s color vision is similar to that of a person who has red-green color blindness\nDogs can make out yellow and blue, and combinations of those colors. This renders a lot of the world grayish-brown, according to research conducted by Jay Neitz, who runs the Neitz Color Vision Lab in the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Washington.\nOther users have commented on how adorable the video is, which you can watch by clicking here.\n“Adorable he seemed so happy with his choice,” said another user.\nOne person joked: “Descendants of wolves are now sitting in a shopping cart and choosing between a Rudolph and a blue fluffy toy.”\nA third comment said: “Would love to know their thought process. Or what sniff makes the cut.”\nOther users have stated that they will allow their dog to choose their toys, and some have stated that they already do so. Like Doris, a mixed breed, who can’t resist pulling her owner into a grocery store and heading straight to the pet section.\nRecently, Newsweek shared an animal shelter’s tradition whereby the volunteers spread hundreds of toys on the floor and allow their canine residents to choose one for Christmas.\nWe have also spoken to a top veterinarian who revealed the five best enrichment ideas for dogs to ensure they are getting enough mental stimulation.\nKait Hembree, VTS (behavior), CVT, KPA, CTP, and the head of training at Boston-based GoodPup, previously told Newsweek that activities and games that provide mental stimulation are some of the best at-home enrichment options for dogs.\nShe said: “Unfortunately, given the hectic daily schedules most people live, these forms of entertainment are often underutilized. But providing daily at-home mental enrichment opportunities doesn’t have to be hard or time-consuming with a little creativity and fortitude.”\nNewsweek reached out to @jack_inthemarsh for comment via Instagram . We could not verify the details of the case.\nDo you have funny and adorable videos or pictures of your pet you want to share?

    "text": "Disney+ Just Added One of the Best Marvel Movies Ever\nX-Men (2000) is now streaming on Disney+.\nDisney+ has been home to all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe projects for a while now, but it also has some exciting Marvel content outside of the MCU. Marvel's Netflix shows\nwere added in 2022, and various X-Men films have been available to stream on and off. Now, you can finally stream one of the Fox Universe's best movies on DInsey+: the original X-Men from 2000.\n\"Get ready for Marvel Studios' #Echo, more #PercyJackson and the Olympians, #ARealBugsLife, and so much more! How are you kicking off your January?\"\n[Disney+](/category/disney-streaming-service/) shared on Instagram. Their post shows X-Men dropping today, January 5th, and it includes a photo of [Hugh Jackman](/category/hugh-jackman/) as Wolverine. You can check it out below:\nHugh Jackman Returns To Marvel:\n[Deadpool 3](/category/deadpool-3/) is heading to theaters this year, and it's set to feature the long-awaited return of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Deadpool 3 will be helmed by Shawn Levy from a script written by Bob's Burgers' Wendy Molyneaux and Lizzie Molyneaux-Loeglin, with Deadpool and Deadpool 2 writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick reportedly also returning to contribute to the script. Not much is known about the script, but there has been a lot of speculation and exciting teases.\nIn addition to Ryan Reynolds in the titular role and Jackman as Wolverine, Deadpool 3 will also star Morena Baccarin as Vanessa Carlysle, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Karan Soni as Dopinder, Stefan Kapičić as Piotr Rasputin/Colossus, and Emma Corrin and Matthew Macfadyen in currently-unknown roles.\nWill More X-Men Stars Appear in Deadpool 3?\nCurrently, there's no confirmation that other stars from the X-Men franchise will appear in Deadpool 3, but considering Kesley Grammer's r\necent cameo as Beast in The Marvels, it's likely we'll be seeing more stars from the Fox Universe. One person fans are hoping to see in Deadpool 3 is Patrick Stewart as Professor X, the role he first played in X-Men (2000) and continued to play for many years up until his appearance in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Recently, Stewart appeared on the Happy Sad Confused podcast and teased a potential appearance in Deadpool 3.\n\"I have every confidence he's still around,\" Stewart said when Professor X's multiple film deaths came up in the interview. \"It has come up, there's been a process,\" Stewart admitted when asked about appearing in Deadpool 3. \"But the last two-three years have been so difficult with the labor problems and the health problems, COVID, you know...\"\n\"I can't say about what Charles' future might possibly hold,\" Stewart told\nEntertainment Tonight last year. The actor also revealed Ian McKellen's (Magento) reaction to Xavier's return in Doctor Strange 2. \"Actually, it went very well. He did say something like ['Hey, I would've done this!'], yes, that's true,\" Stewart said. \"But we're not done, Sir Ian and myself. We're... we got plans.\"\n\"I've been told to stand by. I know nothing more than that, honest,\" Stewart\ntold ComicBook.com earlier last year when asked about a Deadpool 3 appearance. You can watch that interview at the top of the page.\nX-Men is now streaming on Disney+. Stay tuned for more updates about Deadpool 3.\n[0comments](#)",
