    "text": "2023-12-30 03:52:44\nVirginia Attorney General wins appeal in voter misinformation case\nby Ezra Hercyk\nFriday, Dec 29th 2023\nFILE PHOTO – Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares on Jan. 4, 2023. (7News)\nRICHMOND, Va. (WSET) —\nOn Friday, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected an appeal by Look Ahead America, Inc. This appeal related to Miyares’ legal action against the organization for false political mailers leading up to the 2023 General Elections.\nIn October, Miyares issued a cease and desist letter to Look Ahead America, Inc., also known as Virginia Voter Assistance, aiming to stop the circulation of “false and intimidating flyers” in northern Virginia. Look Ahead America, Inc. sued the Attorney General challenging Virginia’s voter intimidation statutes and seeking to restrain their enforcement. In October, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ruled in favor of the Attorney General, denying Look Ahead America, Inc.’s requested injunction. The Fourth Circuit, on Wednesday, dismissed Look Ahead America, Inc.’s appeal against that denial.\nRead More\n“In Virginia, it should be easy to vote and hard to cheat. I’m proud of my Election Integrity Unit for taking action against voter misinformation and intimidation,” said Attorney General Miyares. “Look Ahead America, Inc’s election mail pieces threatened and misled voters, and I am committed to cracking down on intimidating, threatening, and coercive election tactics like this.”\nAccording to Miyares, Look Ahead America, Inc. distributed misleading flyers in Fauquier, Loudoun, and Prince William counties, alleging that recipients had failed to vote in recent elections. The flyers claimed that such non-participation could result in the loss of Social Security Income, Medicare eligibility, unemployment benefits, child tax credits, child custody rights, and concealed carry permits. These deceptive materials were falsely presented as coming from a governmental organization, lending an air of gravity and a fake appearance of credibility to their threats, according to the attorney general.\nThe Office of Attorney General Election Integrity Unit was established in 2022 as a restructuring of existing attorneys, investigators, and paralegals across the agency in order to increase collaboration and cooperation on election issues.\nLoad more…\n1703909349\n#Virginia #Attorney #General #wins #appeal #voter #misinformation #case",

    "title": "These Are Your Extended Warranty Horror Stories",
    "text": "These Are Your Extended Warranty Horror Stories [Share] Last week I asked if you guys had any extended-warranty horror stories after we brought you this story about CarChex. Most of you guys had avoided buying these products or have had good experiences with them, but a few of you had a rougher go. Take commenter Eve65688363 who said this: \"In 2018 I purchased a 2015 Honda Odyssey and purchased the extended warranty, I used it once for a battery replacement; a couple of years ago the alternator shot craps. I had the van towed to the repair shop, when I called to report the claim, the company asked for the vehicle's milage-it was about 112,000 miles and I was told the warranty expired at 100,000 miles. No more extended warranties for me.\" Only 2,000 miles short and not honored? Oof. Then there's this from Syke, taking me back to my service-desk days: \"I'm retired from (but still work part-time, three mornings a week - retirement is boring) for a Honda/Yamaha/Can-Am/Sea Doo store, handing the warranty and recall paperwork for those lines. Plus, we also carry Kayo motocrossers & ATV's (China) and Hisun ATV's and side by sides (Vietnam). Sales pushes an aftermarket warranty package by McGraw which is both profitable for the company and the bane of my work existence. McGraw isn't a rip-off, they actually cover the repairs. The hoops I have to jump thru, however, is often mind boggling. All claims have to be pre-approved, before the mechanic even takes a wrench to the unit. No pre-approval, no coverage. Period. And McGraw will be demanding prior service receipts. Do your own oil changes? That's tantamount to not servicing the unit at all, is customer abuse, and will almost certainly get the claim refused. They only want to see receipts from a paid repair facility. Next is what's actually covered. Basic rule is: If oil doesn't touch the part, it's not eligible for coverage. A frame piece snaps from metal fatigue (no sign of customer abuse)? Not covered. The list of what they consider 'consumables' is what most of you would think of, plus a whole lot of other stuff. Basically, it's good for handling a major failure in the engine and transmission of the unit, and nothing else. Assuming the customer can prove to them that he takes pristine care of the unit. And in the end, where a Honda/Yamaha, etc. warranty claim is three pages long and usually settled within 48 hours after filing, my McGraw packet is usually 1/4\" thick, has started 2-4 days before the mechanic tears into the unit, and is only settled a couple of weeks after the final filing (done when the customer picks up). If this is what one of the 'honest' outfits does, I can only image what the telemarketer-driven places are like.\" Yeah, that's long, but an in-depth look. And a reminder of headaches I endured. We'll close with this one from Lou_BC: \"My only nightmare warranty claim was with Suzuki Motorcycles. My bike came with a 5 year unlimited mileage warranty. I lost an entire riding season. They wanted proof of servicing. I submitted all of my receipts. They then tried to say that it was insufficient proof. The dealer where I bought the bike (different than where repairs were done) said that all I needed wear receipts and to follow scheduled maintenance. The repairing dealership then said I had screwed up on maintenance. A Suzuki Engineer got involved and said that the oil filter seal or how it seated had zero effect on the engine failure or engine oil pressure. Suzuki then tried to get me to agree to pay for labour and they'd pay for parts. I was so frustrated that I said, okay. A different adjuster took over and process started all over again. Finally Suzuki said they'd pay the full cost of parts and labour. Some of the parts got lost during shipping. The dealer then had to get permission to use aftermarket gaskets. It was finally fixed but the dealer screwed up the carburetor when they decided to do a clean up and adjustment of settings.\" Missed your chance to vent last week? You can do so below.

    "text": "A Conservative MP has been criticised for suggesting most children who struggle in an English town are the “products of crap parents”. James Daly was accused by his Labour rival of “insulting the parenting skills of people in Bury” after the remark was made in a newspaper piece analysing election prospects for the Greater Manchester town. Mr Daly, speaking to the i newspaper, stressed the importance of “stability” offered by the family unit as he outlined what the New Conservatives group of MPs stands for. The Bury North MP said: “I think New Conservatives represent very much working-class conservatism. “We’re not a strange right-wing sect. It’s just people who want to give people the best chance to succeed and thrive in life. “When you think about the family, it’s about stability. “Most of the kids who struggle in Bury are the products of crap parents and so what do we do to try to address that issue? “On the left it would just be we’ll throw money at this and hope something sticks, somebody like me thinks about this more fundamentally.” James Frith, Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate for Bury North, said: “It is revealing to see how little James Daly thinks of his own constituents. “Rather than insulting the parenting skills of people in Bury, he should look closer to home. “Over the last 13 years the Conservatives have failed to grow our economy, protect our public services or provide opportunities for young people in Bury and across the UK.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Информация поступила от заместителя руководителя администрации губернатора и правительства Сергея Нешумова.\nТочные территории, где будет действовать ограничение, не разглашаются. При этом основные виды связи останутся доступными для жителей: голосовая связь, СМС-сообщения и проводной интернет продолжат работать в обычном режиме.\nПо словам Сергея Нешумова, такие меры принимаются для обеспечения безопасности жителей и защиты объектов инфраструктуры. Операторы связи временно ограничат предоставление услуг мобильного интернета в определенных местах.\nМинистерство цифрового развития региона подготовило рекомендации для населения. Жителям советуют всегда иметь при себе наличные деньги, использовать Wi-Fi для оплаты покупок и заранее сохранять необходимую информацию на устройствах.\nМинистр цифрового развития области Сергей Цукарь сообщил, что до конца лета будет создана специальная карта точек доступа к Wi-Fi, которая поможет жителям ориентироваться в местах, где можно подключиться к беспроводному интернету.\nРанее сообщалось, компенсируют ли операторы связи отсутствие интернета.\nСамое важное - в нашем Telegram-канале",
