    "text": "The multi-billion dollar Bitcoin ATM (BTM) industry in the United States is booming again after a retrenchment during the 2022 “crypto winter.” But should this growth obscure concerns about scams and money laundering?\nUnlike online exchanges, BTMs do not require users to share bank account information. They verify identities by asking for a photo ID and phone number.\nInstant Transactions\nSince cryptocurrency transactions are based on blockchain technology, Bitcoin ATMs are often able to complete them instantly. Users simply enter their wallet address or scan a QR code to buy the cryptocurrency of their choice.\nThe increasing prevalence of “\nBitcoin ATM near me” searches reflects the growing integration of cryptocurrencies into everyday life, as people actively seek out accessible and secure avenues for managing their digital assets.\nThe transaction is then recorded in the blockchain and instantly delivered to their digital wallet. This makes it much easier to purchase crypto on the go than using an online exchange, which typically requires a lengthy verification process.\nAdditionally, Bitcoin ATMs often offer more privacy than centralized exchanges by not requiring sensitive information like debit or credit card numbers or bank accounts. While some machines may ask for a cell phone number and four-digit PIN to verify identity, most do not require any personal identification information at all.\nEnhanced Financial Privacy\nBitcoin ATMs don’t require users to connect their bank account or provide identification, which can be beneficial to privacy. However, these machines are still subject to Know Your Customer regulations that protect investors by preventing criminals from using these devices to steal money or identities.\nTypically, the machine will ask for the user’s crypto wallet address and then print a QR code that the user can scan with their smartphone to send the bought cryptocurrency into their wallet. The transaction is then recorded on the blockchain, making it impossible for anyone without the user’s private key to access their wallet and make changes to their balance or ownership.\nThis is a valuable level of security, but users should be sure to follow security best practices when handling their crypto wallet private keys. For example, they should store them in a noncustodial open-source wallet. Ultimately, the trade-off between privacy and convenience is a choice that each individual will have to make based on their personal financial preferences and needs.\nConvenience\nCryptocurrency ATMs are a\nconvenient way to buy Bitcoin by exchanging cash for the digital currency. Once you insert the amount of cash you wish to exchange, the machine will take care of the rest. It will send the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency to your wallet, usually through a QR code.\nThis process is fast, efficient, and easy to use. Most machines also offer a touchscreen to facilitate the transaction. Depending on local regulations, you may need to verify your identity before making a large transaction. This is to prevent money laundering and protect the integrity of the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.\nAdditionally, the user’s privacy is protected since transactions at a crypto ATM are not linked to a bank account. Instead, the ATM will record the purchase on a public blockchain and then transfer the Bitcoin to your wallet. Once the transaction is complete, you will receive a ticket with your transaction ID to track its status.\nInteresting Related Article: “\nWhat Functions Do Bitcoin ATMs Offer?“",

    "text": "Many shops were shut down out of fear of looting and vandalism, as police and protesters played a tense game of cat and mouse throughout the day. The city saw a few civilians caught up in the chaos, with most streets deserted and travellers stranded for hours due to a lack of transport. Riot police set up roadblocks at key roundabouts, including Nyayo Stadium, Roysambu, City Stadium, and Ngara, to prevent suspected protesters from entering the CBD, which was the focal point of the demonstrations. Passengers heading into the city faced major delays, with some being forced to disembark and show their identification cards before continuing their journey. “I came all the way from Naivasha to join my fellow patriots determined to send a strong message of our disappointment with the government,” said Antony Njuguna. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter According to Njuguna, the Cabinet members they want to be dismissed have integrity issues. “We no longer trust them, and bringing them back to the top decision-making table ignores the will of the people,” he said. Sammy Radak, a human rights activist, said Ruto had failed to honour the pledges he made when he dismissed the Cabinet and promised to transform his government. Kitengela town in Kajiado County, which has been the epicentre of the anti-government protests, did not explode yesterday. Unlike the other days, the much-hyped ‘Nane Nane’ protests did not take place as was witnessed before. It emerged that a meeting with the county security committee that ordered all bars and entertainment outlets to close at 11pm helped calm the town. The committee chaired by County Commissioner James Taari banned protests along the Nairobi-Namanga-Arusha Highway. On Wednesday, Governor Joseph Ole Lenku said that Kitengela and Ongata Rongai would remain on high alert. “As much as we respect the right of any Kenyan to demonstrate, Kitengela and, indeed, any urban centre in Kajiado will not be looting grounds,” he said. Guard their properties But there was tension in the town as traders and residents stood by their shops to guard their properties. Police faced a rough time stopping pockets of protestors from accessing the town centre and blocking the highway. Motorists accessing the town were not allowed to pass mounted roadblocks on both entries from Mombasa Road and Namanga. Notably, petrol stations and supermarkets that were targeted before remained shut to prevent further losses. Makueni, Machakos and Kitui also experienced low-key protests. In Kitui, a handful of protesters waving twigs and placards made a procession from Kalundu market through the town centre where they castigated President William Ruto for turning a deaf ear on demands made by Gen-Zs. “Our issues range from lowering the high cost of living, creation of jobs for the youth, and youth representation in government. These have not been addressed. Instead what we have witnessed is the appointment of ODM retirees into government,” said a protester who identified himself as Mathias. The demonstrators took issue with what they called Ruto’s calculated move to marginalise the Kamba community by denying it Cabinet slots. In Machakos town, many businesses remained closed with leading supermarkets forced to close shop at around 3 pm. Hawkers who operate along the Machakos-Wote highway also vacated the area after it turned into a battleground between the police and protesters.

    "title": "Worst winter for 200 years saw Lancashire freeze as rivers and seas turned to ice - LancsLive",
    "text": "Just over 60 years ago, Britain experienced its worst winter in nearly 200 years. Known as the 'Big Freeze', the winter of 1962/63 saw some of the harshest conditions ever recorded, lasting up to 10 weeks. Down in Kent, [the sea froze](https://www.kentlive.news/news/nostalgia/big-freeze-1963-sea-froze-8951663) for nearly a mile, allowing children to play on its surface while ships sat on the ice. While the wintry outbreak began in [December 1962](https://www.lancs.live/news/local-news/nostalgia/), the snows started on Boxing Day with biting temperatures, hitting as low as -20C in some parts, lasting until March. The Arctic conditions meant thousands of schools closed, telephone and power lines came down, and power cuts hit thousands of homes. Just before the New Year, a blizzard swept across South West England and Wales, causing snow drifts more than 20ft in places, driven by gale-force winds. - READ MORE: [The changing face of Blackpool's Golden Mile over 50 years in 43 fascinating photos](https://www.lancs.live/news/local-news/nostalgia/gallery/changing-face-blackpools-golden-mile-28245814) - READ MORE: [Read today's top Lancs Live stories](https://www.lancs.live/) Roads and railways were blocked while residents of remote villages were left stranded and without electricity. Even in Manchester city centre, the snow was six inches deep - even deeper in the suburbs. In Rochdale, then part of [Lancashire](https://www.lancs.live/all-about/lancashire), Hollingworth Lake was frozen over for weeks, in places to depths of two feet. The first weekend in February saw people taking a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to walk across the surface. An account of the 'Big Freeze' written by The Guardian called 'The Long Winter 1962-63' claims the winter was responsible for at least 49 deaths. In Lancashire, two climbers were killed by an avalanche in the Chew Valley, near Oldham, and a man was reportedly found dead in a stranded car near [Blackburn](https://www.lancs.live/all-about/blackburn). Newspapers reported the severe frost had burst pipes in hundreds of homes in Lancashire while police smashed ice on canals and ponds, warning children to keep off the ice. The danger was real; eight years earlier, 21 Lancashire children drowned in ice accidents on one Saturday alone. Sport during this terrible winter was also heavily disrupted. In the days before under-soil heating, frozen pitches saw football and rugby matches cancelled. From December 8 to February 16, Bolton Wanderers played no competitive matches. [Burnley](https://www.lancs.live/all-about/burnley) went 63 days without a league game, stretching from December 29, 1962, until March 2, 1963. Despite the chaos caused by the arctic conditions, there was still the opportunity for fun. Despite warnings, children and adults skated on frozen lakes and rivers. Giant snowmen were built while tobogganing became a national pastime while the snows endured. In early March 1963, the ice began to thaw as temperatures rose, and by March 6, there were no frosts anywhere in the UK. Parts of the country that had just been in the iron grip of a bitter winter were now faced with floods as the ice and snow melted. Do you remember the 'Big Freeze' of 1963?

    "title": "Government sent bleak warning amid fears of raid on pensions",
    "text": "The boss of insurer Aviva has warned the government against tapping into private pensions to plug a £22 billion deficit in the country's finances. Speculation is rife that the Chancellor Rachel Reeves may cut the tax relief available to higher earners on their pension contributions in her October Budget.\nAt present, a basic rate taxpayer receives 20 per cent tax relief on pension contributions, meaning every £100 they invest in a scheme costs them £80. However, those earning between £50,271 to £125,140 and paying 40 percent tax also receive more generous tax relief on pension contributions at this same rate.\nThis means every £100 invested in a pension scheme costs them £60. And individuals earning over £125,140 get tax relief at 45 percent on pension contributions, which means investing £100 into a scheme costs them £55.\nThere are suggestions that the tax relief on pension contributions could be standardised across all workers at 30 percent to make the system fairer. This would mean assisting the vast majority of basic rate taxpayers to increase the value of their pension pots. At the same time, it would take some money away from better paid people.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that such a change could generate a net saving to the government worth around £2.7 billion a year. However, Amanda Blanc, the boss of pensions and insurance giant Aviva, has warned against changes that will discourage higher earners from contributing to pension schemes.\nAs Aviva released its half-year results, the company's CEO warned that Rachel Reeves should reconsider her stance on pension tax relief. She emphasised the importance of encouraging employees to contribute to their pensions a sector in which Aviva is a significant player to reduce their dependence on state support.\nThe CEO also argued that increased pension savings would result in more funds available for investment within the UK. She stated: \"On pensions tax relief I think we would just caution that if you really want people to save for the long-term pensions are a long-term game, they are not something that you do something with today and don't have consequences in five, ten, 15, 20 years' time.\n\"All we would say is that the Government thinks about the long-term impact.\" Investment experts at AJ Bell have suggested that changes to pension tax relief could mean millions of higher-rate taxpayers may need to make an additional four years of pension contributions to compensate for the loss in tax relief.\nMiss Blanc added: \"All we would say about anything that happens is that any government thinks about long-term impacts of policies.\" She made these comments as Aviva reported better than expected first-half results, with operating profits rising by 14 percent year-on-year to £875 million in the six months to the end of June, exceeding the £830 million forecast by City analysts.\nAviva, listed on the FTSE 100 and with significant operations in Canada, has seen a boost attributable in part to a rise in general insurance premiums within Britain and Ireland. These have surged by 18 percent to £3.8 billion.\nInsurers have been steadily increasing prices for motor and home coverage over the past couple of years in response to inflationary pressures. Rising costs associated with handling claims have had a significant impact on the industry's profitability.\n\"This surge in policy prices has brought forth criticism from those who suggest that insurers are exploiting the inflationary climate to unfairly profiteer off customers. Yet Aviva's CEO, Amanda Blanc, counters this view by stating: \"I don't think that the industry can be accused of profiteering.\"\nBlanc also expressed optimism about the UK's prospects, a sentiment likely to be welcomed by the government, which has prioritised economic growth. She added: \"We have spoken to over 200 investors so far this year, we've been all over the world,\" and noted that investor interest in the UK is significantly higher now than it was two years ago.",
