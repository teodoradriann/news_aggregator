    "title": "Defensive deficiencies were magnified on Red Sox road trip - The Boston Globe",
    "text": "The Red Sox went 1-5 on their most recent road trip after being swept by the Dodgers and dropping two of three to the Rockies. The club had Thursday off and will begin a three-game set against the Yankees starting Friday.\nHere are some observations from the two series out of the break:\n▪ Manager Alex Cora inked a new three-year deal Wednesday and before the ink could even dry up, his club had already suffered a 20-7 beatdown at the hands of Colorado.\nIt happens.\nBut in that series, or game, it was clear where the Sox needed to see some improvements: infield defense. Cora always says that when he played he always hated hitting. It was a grind for him, whereas the defensive side came easy. He was a sure-handed infielder who didn’t have any trouble turning the double play. So, one could imagine that the Sox manager might need a little Advil after watching his team’s infield defense from time to time.\nGet Sports Headlines The Globe's most recent sports headlines delivered to your inbox every morning. Enter Email Sign Up The Rockies, despite constantly scraping the bottom of the barrel in the majors, have one of the better defenses in baseball. The way their players moved in the infield, got to balls, and turned and finished double plays was done at an elite level. The numbers back it up. The Rockies are tied for having the seventh-fewest errors in the majors with 49. They are tied for first in double plays turned, anchored by Ezequiel Tovar at second.\nAdvertisement\nOn the contrary, the Sox have made 74 errors, the most in baseball. They are ranked 21st in the majors with just 21 double plays turned. Ceddanne Rafaela has helped to stabilize shortstop and the infield. But when he plays center field, that’s when things seem to become a bit erratic for the Sox defenders in the dirt.\nIn fairness, the Rockies have always had one of the best defenses in baseball. Considering how tough it is for pitchers to pitch there because of the altitude, a sturdy defense is almost a requirement.\nThe Red Sox still have playoff hopes. While stellar defense isn’t mandatory, maintaining solid defensive play is essential.\n▪ It’s tough to judge the Sox’ pitching on just one road trip which included close to a week-long break before resuming action last Friday against the Dodgers, and then visiting a stadium in Coors FIeld that is death row for pitchers.\nAdvertisement\nNevertheless, the numbers are what they are.\nStarters succumbed to a 5.51 ERA, yielding nine homers. Sox starters haven’t offered many free passes, allowing just six in that span.\n▪ The loss of Justin Slaten and Chris Martin has left a gaping hole in the Sox’ bullpen. The Sox have had to patch together the back part of the bullpen in his absence.\nThe bullpen struggled for the first four contests. But, perhaps, the Sox can be optimistic about Greg Weissert , who has tussled to find his footing, last two appearances, going two innings (one in each) in scoreless fashion.\nThe Sox made some adjustments to Weissert’s hands. Initially when he came set, Weissert’s hands were down by his right hip. When he would get into his leg lift, his glove would come up near his ear. The Sox have since modified that latter move. Now, when he gets into his leg lift his glove/hands don’t go any higher than his chest with the hope that it could help him become more consistent in the strike zone.\n“I think he eliminates a lot of stuff,” said Cora. “It’s more simple. Fastball command has been great. [ Jason Varitek ] made a point after the first game at Coors Field, like, finally, he’s been able to get the four-seamer up which is a very good pitch for him.”\n▪ The Sox will continue to hit, led by Jarren Duran and Rafael Devers . They are young , so expect the streakiness.\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "¿UN TROMBO PUEDE SER UN ASESINO? PARA QUIEN EL ERROR ITERA, SÍ El domingo 24 de diciembre, Nochebuena, volví a leer en la página de la programación de EL PAÍS, correspondiente al lunes, 25, Navidad, que Antena 3 volvía a reponer (y este menda, seguramente, a ver, pues le encanta) la película “El juez”. La reseña que aparecía en el periódico global reiteraba la misma información deficiente, falaz, sin enmendar, de siempre. Y a mí me dio por escribir los diez versos de la décima que sigue: El periódico global, Como lo hace gente humana, Marra hoy, y lo hará mañana. Mas, para mí es anormal Que no se corrija el mal: Una, dos, tres, cuatro veces En el mismo error, con creces, Ha incurrido en lo explicado Sobre “El juez”, que ha publicado. ¿No son muchas idioteces? Esto es lo que escribí, hace seis meses largos, y apareció publicado en mi blog al día siguiente, lunes 5 de junio de 2023: EL TIEMPO ES JUEZ QUE DA Y QUITA RAZONES Está, más que claro, cristalino, que en la vida normal, cotidiana, como otro tanto acaece en el juego de las 63 casillas, dispuestas en espiral, de la oca, caer en unas, tras haber lanzado el o los dados, puede llevar a otras, y acarrear, por ende, un beneficio o un perjuicio (de oca a oca, y tiro porque me toca; de puente a puente, y tiro porque se me lleva la corriente; de dados a dados, y tiro porque me ha tocado), adelantando o retrasando la posición en el peregrinaje, trayecto o viaje. Hoy, domingo 4 de junio de 2023, a las cuatro de la tarde, antes de ponerme a redactar a bolígrafo (suelo usar un BIC azul) estas líneas torcidas, he echado un vistazo célere a la página de la programación televisiva del periódico global, siendo más específico, a la 59 del prestigioso diario EL PAÍS, y he leído en un santiamén qué decía la tal sobre la película que había programado emitir La 1 a las 22.05 horas, “El juez”, dirigida en 2014 por David Dobkin, que, si esta noche la vuelvo a ver (por la tarde, aún de día, aunque yo ya había cenado, de regreso de mi “andamiaje”, así llamo a mi paseo raudo, vespertino, tras encontrarme con dos exmaestros —aunque quien lo fue lo será mientras viva y aun después de haber finado sus días en el planeta azul, la Tierra—, Gloria y Alfonso, en la tudelana Avenida Huertas Mayores, eso les he hecho saber), será la tercera vez que mis ojos y mis oídos estén atentísimos a cuanto suceda en la pantalla de mi televisor. Esto es lo que cabía leer en dicho epítome: “Hank Palmer es un abogado distanciado de su padre. La madre de (¿quién?) muere asesinada (falso; lo hace, de manera natural, por culpa de un trombo) y Hank decide ser el abogado de su padre (más justo sería formularlo al revés, que el padre y juez decide que quien lo defienda sea su hijo), el principal sospechoso”. Recuerdo que escribí un texto (puede que fueran dos) en prosa al respecto la segunda vez que la vi en la tele. En dicho filme, por cierto, según mi parecer, tanto Robert Downey Jr. como Robert Duvall están de cine (nunca mejor urdido o más a propósito). Hoy, volver a leer esas palabras del breve resumen erróneo, mendaz, sobre “El juez”, ha propiciado que recordara otras, que cabe leer, a su vez, en el auto inicial de “La Celestina”, que acabó Fernando de Rojas, pero el susodicho, primero, es de autor desconocido, en concreto, las del diálogo que mantienen Calisto y Sempronio (copio, directamente, de la edición de 1502, con las grafías puestas al día), donde amo y criado, respectivamente, intercambian estas sabrosas y sagaces dicciones: SEMPRONIO. —La perseverancia en el mal no es constancia; mas dureza o pertinacia la llaman en mi tierra. Vosotros los filósofos de Cupido llamadla como quisiéredes. CALISTO. —Torpe cosa es mentir el que enseña a otro, pues que tú te precias de loar a tu amiga Elicia. SEMPRONIO. —Haz tú lo que bien digo y no lo que mal hago. La reedición del yerro de marras, pues me temo que el mismo (ella, él o no binario) que marró otrora ha fallado también ahora (por no proceder como debería haber hecho, a la enmienda), me lleva a iterar la misma tesis que me brotó antaño, cuando servidor se dedicó, en cuerpo y alma, a preparar los materiales precisos para culminar ese proceso educativo del binomio enseñanza-aprendizaje, en el que la interacción propició que el profesor también aprendiera de sus alumnos (quien no lo hizo ¿se considera acaso buen docente?): De nada sirve que el maestro tenga la mejor disposición de ánimo para enseñar, si, entre sus alumnos, ninguno muestra un ápice o pizca de ganas en querer aprender. Visto lo visto, lamentándolo sobremanera, no confío, sí deseo, pero no espero (si tengo en cuenta el antecedente) que la enseñanza de Confucio haya arraigado o prendido en quien debía hacerlo (“El hombre que ha cometido un error y no lo corrige comete otro error mayor”), pues tal vez siga sin enmendar el yerro de sus fuentes (manifiestamente mejorables, perfectibles). Es más, me apostaría con quien fuera doble contra sencillo a que, si La 1 u otra cadena repusiese “El juez”, aparecería la misma sinopsis errónea, sin corregir. Demos tiempo al tiempo, ese juez que da y quita razones, y lo comprobaremos (o no; entonces, si es así, admitiré que deduje y/o preví mal). Nota bene Transcribo, a continuación, el último párrafo del texto que titulé “Más que una carabina ferial falla” y apareció publicado en mi bitácora de Periodista Digital, el blog de Otramotro, el martes 8 de febrero de 2022: Nada más llevarme a los ojos el aserto apodíctico de Jodorowski, he barruntado qué le pudo ocurrir a quien escribió la breve sinopsis de la película “El juez”, programada por Antena 3 para las 22.10 horas del sábado, recensión que vio la luz ese mismo día, precisamente, 5 de febrero de 2022, en la página 51 de EL PAÍS, en la que se lee esto: “Hank Palmer es un abogado distanciado de su padre. La madre de Hank muere asesinada (sic) y Hank decide ser el abogado de su padre”. El espectador (hembra o varón) que vio dicho filme reparó, seguramente, en qué le comentó a Hank su hermano menor, autista, Dale, que el corazón de su madre se le paró y él la encontró sin vida junto a las hortensias. El padre, el juez, aduce que su esposa estuvo agachada, de rodillas, se le formó un trombo en la pierna y este le fue al corazón, que se le detuvo. Así que su muerte fue natural; a menos que, poéticamente, consideremos que quienes cometieron el crimen fueron las hortensias; nombre que le puso a dicha flor quien la importó de China, el naturalista francés Philibert de Commerson (conocido por acompañar a Louis Antoine de Bougainville en su viaje de circunnavegación entre 1766 y 1769) para homenajear a la esposa del célebre relojero parisino Jean-André Lepaute, la astrónoma y matemática Nicole-Reine de la Briere, también conocida por Hartense u Hortense Lepaute. Hártense de reírse, si quieren, lectores, pero es la pura y dura verdad. Ángel Sáez García",
