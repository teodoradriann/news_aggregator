    "text": "RICHMOND — The Virginia Department of Health on Thursday announced the first reported pediatric flu death of the 2023-2024 season.\nThe child was between the ages of five and 12, and lived in Virginia’s eastern region, which includes Hampton Roads, according to a news release from the department. No other information about the child’s death was provided in order to protect the family’s privacy, the release said.\n“We at the Virginia Department of Health, are broken hearted and extend our sympathies to the family of this child during this difficult time,” State Health Commissioner Dr. Karen Shelton said in a statement. “Even though the flu is common, it can cause serious illness and even death. I urge everyone who is eligible to receive the flu vaccine to do so not only to protect themselves, but to protect those around them.”\nVirginia’s 2023-24 flu season is expected to be in the usual range of severity, the release said, but even typical seasons can vary widely and result in illness, hospitalizations, and death. Virginia reported five influenza-associated deaths among children during last year’s flu season.\nOnly about a quarter of eligible Virginians are reported to have received the flu vaccine this season, the release said.\nA recent study estimated the vaccine reduced the risk of flu-related emergency department and urgent care visits by almost half, and hospitalization by more than a third among U.S. adults during the 2022-23 season. Health department officials said now is still a good time to get a vaccine if you haven’t already.\nJane Harper, jane.harper@pilotonline.com\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window)",

    "text": "NEW DELHI: In a late night development, the Assam cabinet on Friday took the first big step towards introducing the Uniform Civil Code in the state by scrapping the Assam Muslim Marriage & Divorce Registration Act 1935.The move comes less than three weeks after Uttarakhand became the first state to pass the Uniform Civil Code. Cabinet minister Jayanta Mallabarua termed it as a step towards achieving UCC. He stated that now all matters pertaining to Muslim marriages and divorces would be taken care of under the Special Marriages Act. The decision was taken today in a cabinet meeting which was chaired by chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. \\\"The CM had recently stated that we are moving towards Uniform Civil Code (UCC). In this journey, a very important decision has been taken. The Assam Muslim Marriage & Divorce Registration Act 1935, under which 94 Muslim registrars are still functioning, has been repealed today. The cabinet has today ended this Act and now under this act no Muslim marriage or divorce would be registered. Since we have a Special Marriages Act, hence we want all matters settled through that particular Act,\\\" said Mallabarua. The cabinet minister further said that through this decision they are also trying to curb child marriage in the state.",

    "text": "Armed groups rule in southern Colombia.\nAround 25,000 people have been confined for ten days and risk running out of food in indigenous villages in the Colombian Amazon due to threats from FARC dissidents, the local governor said on Thursday.\nIn the municipalities of Solano and Milan, “a confrontation is imminent” between the Central Staff (EMC) and the “Segunda Marquetalia”, indicated on national radio the governor of the Caqueta Department, Luis Francisco Ruiz.\nThese two rival armed groups are both dissidents of the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), a Marxist guerrilla dismantled since the signing of a historic peace agreement signed in 2016. With leaflets, as well as audios and videos broadcast on social networks, the rebels prohibit residents from moving.\n“We can’t sleep”\n“We feel fear, anguish, anxiety (…) We cannot sleep,” said a local community leader who preferred to remain anonymous by telephone.\n“It is very dangerous to go out.”\nAudio attributed to a suspected guerrilla leader has been circulating since last week.\n“No one is allowed to walk along the river (…) For fear that innocent people fall into it (…) Everyone stay calm,” warns this recording, which AFP was unable to verify. 'authenticity.\n“There is a restriction of mobility on the Orteguaza and Caqueta rivers that mainly harms” two indigenous communities located near the triple border between Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, explained Governor Ruiz.\n“This affects around 25,000 people, isolated by restrictions on rivers in an area where the only access is currently by water.”\nOver the last ten days, only “two barges (…) with non-perishable foodstuffs” have been able to enter this area.\nFor the rest, there is “no commercial transport mobility”, he lamented.\nThe governor joined the call launched Monday by indigenous organizations, who asked President Gustavo Petro for \"immediate solutions to the permanent encirclement, threats and attacks on the free movement of communities\" in the region. .\nSimilar news: Colombia: 25,000 people confined for ten days under threat from armed groups 11 mins",

Le pontife argentin de 88 ans, pour lequel le diagnostic des médecins était « réservé » samedi soir, a toutefois « passé une nuit tranquille et s'est reposé » à l'hôpital Gemelli de Rome, a annoncé le Vatican sur sa chaîne Telegram.\nLe chef de l'Église catholique est hospitalisé depuis le 14 février pour une pneumonie des deux poumons et son état s'est dégradé samedi avec « une crise asthmatique prolongée qui a nécessité l'application d'oxygène à haut débit », selon le dernier bulletin de santé. « Les analyses de sang effectuées aujourd'hui ont également révélé une thrombopénie (baisse du nombre de plaquettes sanguines), associée à une anémie, qui a nécessité l'administration d'une transfusion sanguine.\nProchains jours « déterminants »\nLe Saint-Père reste alerte et a passé la journée dans un fauteuil, bien qu'il souffre davantage qu'hier. Le pronostic est actuellement réservé », a précisé le Vatican dans ce communiqué au ton d'une rare gravité. Dès vendredi après-midi les médecins qui s'occupent du pape avaient mis en garde sur la fragilité de la situation. « Le pape est-il hors de danger ? Non, le pape n'est pas hors de danger », avait affirmé le Pr Sergio Alfieri lors d'une conférence de presse à l'hôpital Gemelli. « Le vrai risque dans ces cas-là est que les germes passent dans le sang », provoquant ainsi une septicémie potentiellement mortelle, avait-il expliqué.\n« La situation est devenue plus préoccupante », a déclaré le virologue Fabrizio Pregliasco, cité dimanche par le quotidien La Stampa. « L'âge du Saint Père, ainsi que les antécédents de santé, comme par exemple la bronchite asthmatique, pourraient avoir compliqué les choses et pas qu'un peu », détaille-t-il. « Il faut espérer que la thérapie antibiotique fonctionne pour éviter le risque d'une septicémie, une infection systémique, qui peut avoir une issue fatale. Le pape est certainement en de bonnes mains mais les prochaines heures et les prochains jours seront déterminants », estime l'expert.\nPrières à travers le monde\nIl sera hospitalisé au moins toute la semaine prochaine et il ne dirigera pas dimanche, pour la deuxième fois d'affilée, la prière de l'Angélus. En début de matinée, une messe se tiendra au Vatican lors de laquelle le pro-préfet du dicastère pour l'Évangélisation lira l'homélie préparée par le pape. Plusieurs responsables religieux et politiques ont dit prier pour le pape. Depuis samedi soir sur les réseaux sociaux, les internautes ont aussi posté des centaines de messages disant prier pour François, beaucoup postant une photo de l'évêque de Rome seul sur la place Saint-Pierre lors de la pandémie de Covid-19.\nFrançois a été hospitalisé initialement pour une bronchite, mais le Saint-Siège a révélé mardi qu'il avait développé une pneumonie dans les deux poumons, une infection du tissu pulmonaire potentiellement mortelle. Cette hospitalisation, la quatrième depuis 2021, suscite de vives inquiétudes alors que le pape a déjà été affaibli par une série de problèmes ces dernières années, allant d'opérations du côlon et de l'abdomen à des difficultés à marcher.\nL'hospitalisation du pape, à la fois chef spirituel des 1,4 milliard de catholiques dans le monde et chef de l'Etat de la Cité du Vatican, a relancé les interrogations autour de sa capacité à assurer sa charge, alors que le droit canonique ne prévoit aucune disposition en cas de problème grave qui altèrerait sa lucidité.",

    "text": "New Mexico has received partial approval for a federal emergency declaration following devastating flash floods in Ruidoso that killed three people and damaged dozens of homes, but the state is still awaiting approval for the bulk of disaster assistance residents desperately need.\nThe emergency declaration approved provides immediate federal personnel for life-saving activities like urban search and rescue teams, but leaves pending the direct financial assistance that would help residents repair or replace flood-damaged homes and cover essential needs.\n“This federal declaration is a critical first step, but it’s not everything Ruidoso needs and deserves,” Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a press release. “We will continue working with the federal government for every dollar and resource necessary to help this resilient community fully recover from these devastating floods.”\nThe Tuesday afternoon flash flooding proved deadly and destructive for the Lincoln County mountain village. Three people — a man in his 40s or 50s, a 4-year-old girl, and a 7-year-old boy — were swept downstream by unprecedented floodwaters when heavy monsoonal rains fell on burn scar areas from last year’s South Fork and Salt fires, according to the Village of Ruidoso. Emergency crews conducted 50-60 swift-water rescues during the event.\nA preliminary assessment found that at least 35-50 homes were damaged or lost in the flooding, with the Rio Ruidoso rising to a record-breaking 20 feet, 5 feet higher than the previous high-water mark.\nWhat’s Still Needed\nThe governor’s original emergency declaration request sought extensive additional assistance that remains pending federal review, including:\nDirect Financial Assistance covering:\n- Repair or replacement of homes destroyed in the disaster\n- Essential needs, including medical, dental, funeral, personal property, and transportation costs\n- Emergency supplies, including water, food, first aid, and infant care items\n- Temporary housing, including hotels and other suitable options for displaced residents\nInfrastructure Recovery for Chaves, Lincoln, Otero, and Valencia counties:\n- Federal reimbursement for emergency work and debris removal\n- Permanent repair of disaster-damaged roads, bridges, water control facilities, public buildings, utilities, and parks\nThe limited emergency declaration highlights the constraints of federal disaster response. Emergency declarations are capped at $5 million total assistance and typically only authorize debris removal and emergency protective measures, while Individual Assistance authorization under emergencies is rare, according to FEMA guidelines.\nThis flooding particularly impacts a state already grappling with disaster recovery costs. More than $34 million in federal assistance has been approved for New Mexicans affected by 2024 disasters, including long-term, low-interest loans and flood insurance claims from previous events.\nThe disaster also underscores New Mexico’s flood insurance gap. Only 1,223 homes carry National Flood Insurance policies in Lincoln and Otero counties, despite Lincoln County ranking among the top three most flood-prone counties in New Mexico. A single inch of floodwater can cause up to $25,000 of damage to a home, according to FEMA.\nNew Mexico residents pay an average of $951 yearly for flood insurance — $184 more than the national average — because the state has more flood-prone areas than most other states.\nThe flooding occurred during New Mexico’s peak flood season. July is the most active month for floods statewide, with 575 flood events (33% of all recorded events) historically occurring during this month. Flash floods represent 93% of all flood events in New Mexico.\nThe Tuesday disaster was exacerbated by conditions created from last year’s wildfires. The South Fork and Salt fires, which killed two people and destroyed hundreds of homes in June 2024, left burn scars that increase flash flooding risks for at least two years.\nThe New Mexico Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management is actively working with FEMA to conduct preliminary damage assessments and provide additional documentation requested by the federal agency.\nA state Disaster Recovery Center operates from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Eastern New Mexico University-Ruidoso, 709 Mecham Dr, Ruidoso, NM 88345. State disaster case managers are on site, along with state agencies helping residents replace documents, ask insurance questions, and find resources.\nResidents can also call the State Disaster Helpline at 1-833-663-4736 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. or visit the New Mexico Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management’s website.",
