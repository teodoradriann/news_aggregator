Staff from the venue took to the streets with speakers, flyers and posters to &apos;embrace and celebrate&apos; the award-winning musical making its Edinburgh debut.\nFootage uploaded on social media by staff at the pub shows hundreds of Hamilton fans leaving the sold out venue and being welcomed by Dropkick Murphy&apos;s staff carrying on the performance. Staff were out in full swing with their microphones to sing some of the hit songs from the musical with some fans dancing along.\nRead More: Police swarm busy Edinburgh street after reports of &apos;concern for a person&apos;\nRead More: West Lothian mum-of-two pregnant with quads pleads for new council house\nOne of the owners at Dropkicks, Donal Hurrell, is hoping that they will be able to continue celebrating the hit musical being in the Scottish capital for the duration of the two month run.\nSpeaking to Edinburgh Live, he said: \"“We were really excited to see Hamilton coming to Edinburgh and to embrace and celebrate this, we organised some PR staff to flyer outside but I also got my son Tommy Hurrell (who busks around the city & is a huge fan of the show), to sing Hamilton songs with the PR staff as well.\n\"Despite the horrible weather it was great fun to see people leaving the theatre, buzzing from the Hamilton performance and even singing along with our buskers. Lots of the audience then went to Dropkicks to continue their night which was great and we hope to see this over the two month run.\n\"We also held a karaoke competition to mark Hamilton&apos;s opening night, where we gave away two tickets to the show. We were blown away by the response and the number of fans that entered, but also on the level of the singing quality.\n\"Have to say that Napier Musical Theatre (one of our sponsored societies) were just amazing and helped create a great show along with students from all other universities\".\nSign up for Edinburgh Live newsletters for more headlines straight to your inbox\nFiona Gibson CEO of Capital Theatres who runs the Festival Theatre previously said: “We’re utterly thrilled to be hosting the Scottish Premiere of Hamilton at the Festival Theatre. It’s even more significant that Alexander Hamilton was of Scottish descent, so in many ways the story is coming home.\nJoin Edinburgh Live&apos;s Whatsapp Community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\"To have this iconic show which has delighted audiences round the world here at the Festival Theatre and in Edinburgh where Lin-Manuel Miranda once busked at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe is really special.\"\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

    "text": "Lenny Leszczynski is a car guy, dating back to his days as a young man who drove a Daytona Blue 1964 Chevy Impala, but his wife was not expecting him to land this job. After all, Lenny had never been a CEO before. He did take advantage of all the free time the pandemic gave us by going back to school to earn an advanced degree. He was in Disneyland with his wife and kids hours after his job interview when he received the call. He got the job. He was the new CEO of the San Diego Automotive Museum located in Balboa Park. That was four years ago. Since then, Lenny and his team have taken several steps to breathe new life into the automotive museum, and they have some ambitious plans for one of the city’s coolest spaces. And Lenny knows a thing or two about cool. Just ask him about that Impala he purchased when he was 17. He discusses all that and more with Tony and Juan in this episode of Dear San Diego. The Dear San Diego podcast with Tony Manolatos and Juan Hernandez is produced by JC Polk of Olas Media at the digital branding company’s studios in Mission Valley.",
