    "text": "(CNN) — It started in Utah, of all places. A whirling tendril of air descended from a roiling sky above a southwest suburb of Salt Lake City, punctuating the horizon. It was a tornado – the first of many over the course of weeks.\nA tornado frenzy is ongoing in the United States. At least one has been reported every day since the morning of April 25 in Salt Lake City – a more than two-week streak – and there have been hundreds.\nApril and May are typically the busiest months for tornadoes in the US, Earth’s tornado epicenter , but the pace since April has been exceptional.\nThe US was behind the typical tornado pace before the streak started, but after more than 300 tornado reports, it is now above it.\nMeteorologists and engineers sifting through the reports and damage to accurately reconstruct one of Mother Nature’s most violent phenomena have confirmed 200 tornadoes so far during the streak.\nA prolific tornado outbreak accelerated matters on April 26. A third of the streak’s reported tornadoes happened on that day in the Plains. Sixty-two have been confirmed, including powerful EF3s that carved a path through entire neighborhoods and businesses in Nebraska and decimated the tiny Iowa town of Minden, killing one person there.\nMore than 100 tornadoes hit the Heartland as the streak began at the end of April, a $1 billion disaster on its own, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It capped off an April with 300 tornadoes that tore into the earth in more than a dozen states east of the Rockies, the second-most ever recorded in the typically tornadic month.\nThere have been so many tornadoes that a handful of places have been hit or threatened to be hit twice, including Minden. Barnsdall, Oklahoma, is the most devastating example of this dangerous déjà vu.\nAn EF1 tornado hit the town on April 1. A month later, an EF4 tornado with winds of 165 to 175 mph cut through the core of the small town, upending homes and livelihoods. At least one person died.\nTornadoes as strong as the one in Barnsdall are exceptionally rare and deadly. Only 2% of tornadoes reach the so-called “violent” status of EF4 or EF5. This streak has had two. The first hit Marietta, Oklahoma, on April 27, killing one person. It was the first EF4 tornado in the US in more than a year.\nMay only brought more of the same: A rare Level 5 of 5 high risk for severe weather on May 6 spawned the Barnsdall EF4 and the first of four tornado emergencies this week, including the first-ever one in Michigan.\nThe streak continued for a 15th consecutive day Thursday when a tornado was spotted in southern Georgia in the early afternoon. A Level 3 of 5 risk for severe thunderstorms stripes more than 21 million people across the South Thursday, presenting more chances for tornadoes.\nTornado chances drop Friday and Saturday, but similar threat levels have still managed to spawn tornadoes during the streak, which carries on.\nCNN Meteorologist Rob Shackelford contributed to this report.\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",

    "title": "Salesforce’s Jackie Chambers De Freitas Details Ways To Prevent Bias In Generative AI And Close The AI Trust Gap",
    "text": "Highlighting bias in artificial intelligence (AI) is essential, but equally important is educating people on ways to prevent it.\nIn 2019, Salesforce established its Trusted AI Principles to address the ethical implications of predictive AI and machine learning. By 2023, with the rapid evolution of generative AI, Salesforce deepened its commitment to responsible AI by participating in the AFROTECH™ Conference, where it discussed strategies for prioritizing ethical and inclusive practices in generative AI.\nDuring the session, “Closing The AI Trust Gap: Battling Bias | Presented by Salesforce,” Jackie Chambers de Freitas, Vice President of Agile Delivery and Coaching at Salesforce, shared how Salesforce’s focus on AI began in 2014, when CEO Marc Benioff declared that the company would become an AI-first company.\nWatch the session here via AFROTECH™ Labs.\nView this post on Instagram\n“The goal was to transform Salesforce into an intelligent CRM, making it easy for every company and employee to harness the power of AI by using technologies like machine learning and natural language processing to deliver AI-powered predictions and insights,” said Chambers de Freitas during the Learning Lab.\nWhile Salesforce aimed to be ahead of the curve when it came to AI, Chambers de Freitas also shed light on a group of individuals who were apprehensive about the technology. As companies increasingly adopt AI to meet increasing customer demands and improve efficiency, 75% of their customers don’t trust that the technology will be used ethically, said Chambers de Freitas.\nDuring the Learning Lab, Chambers de Freitas went on to share that the risks of generative AI include accuracy, bias, toxicity, privacy, and security. To combat these risks, she detailed generative AI principles that companies should strongly consider enforcing.\n- Accuracy: Deliver verifiable results that balance accuracy, precision, and recall.\n- Safety: Mitigate bias, toxicity, and harmful output. Create guardrails to prevent additional harm.\n- Honesty: Ensure consent to use data. Be transparent that an AI has created content when delivered autonomously.\n- Empowerment: Identify the appropriate balance to “supercharge” human capabilities and make these solutions accessible to all.\n- Sustainability: Develop right-sized models where possible to reduce carbon footprint\n“When it comes to being accurate, you’ve got to make sure that things are being done by citing the sources where the model is pulling the information from,” Chambers de Freitas said. “This is really important. We want to make sure it’s safe. Further security assessments can help organizations identify vulnerabilities that may be exploited by bad actors. It’s important that humans are involved. If you only rely on generative AI, it could have catastrophic effects on people’s lives and finances. And so think about a field service agent that’s in electricity or gas or a nuclear power station. If we’re not pairing the AI with a human interaction, it could mean devastation for humankind. And I’m not trying to be dramatic, but it could.”\nDuring the Learning Lab, Chamber de Freitas also stressed the importance of minimizing one’s AI carbon footprint.\n“These large language models (LLMs), they use a lot of energy and water to train them,” she said. “At Salesforce, we make sure we’re training our models on high quality CRM data, which helps maximum maximize accuracy and minimize the size of our models to reduce our carbon footprint.”\nFor additional guidance on how to close the AI trust gap and combat bias, Chamber de Freitas shared the following:\n- Make sure to use zero-party or first-party data. Do not use third-party data.\n- Delete old and inaccurate data and label it properly.\n- Keep a human in the loop when it comes to AI.\n- Make sure you’re testing and checking your outputs for bias and accuracy.\nHaven’t purchased your ticket for AFROTECH™ Conference 2024?

The bill also puts into motion deep cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state program that ensures health coverage for the most needy and those with disabilities.\nThe Indivisible group, which also goes by ORD2, asserts that millions stand to lose basic and preventative care. In Oregon, 1.4 million people receive medical coverage through the Oregon Health Plan, the state’s Medicaid program.\nThe federal legislation changes eligibility requirements for Medicaid and SNAP benefits, which, according to a press release from ORD2, threatens to leave families without food.\nThe theme of Saturday’s protest, according to the press release, is “families first.”\nThe group states that it is mobilizing on Saturday in response to what they believe is the “administration’s cruel choice to trade our health, safety, and basic needs for billionaire tax giveaways.” Donations of non-perishable food items will be donated to the local food bank.\nThe group’s press release was also critical of Oregon’s lone conservative congressman, Cliff Bentz, who voted for the tax and spending bill this month. Bentz’s district includes Southern and Eastern Oregon, including Jackson County.\nFor more information, call 541-601-8120.\nEmail Ashland.news associate editor Steve Mitchell at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).",

    "text": "A. T. Ariyaratne, founder of Sarvodaya, has passed away after a fruitful life of 93 years. He leaves behind an example of life dedicated for universal well-being for us who survive him to continue. In addition to my acquaintance with him running into a little more than four decades, my most recent encounter was being invited to deliver the keynote speech at the inauguration of the curated mobile exhibition on the theme ‘Astounding Vision of a Luminary’ to celebrate the 65th anniversary of Sarvodaya Shramadana movement and the 93rd year of the fruitful life of its founder, Dr. A.T. Ariyaratne. That was the 16th of the last December. At this hour of loss, let me re-reflect on remarks I made that morning.\nMy aim is to reflect on ATA’s vision and activism from a very broad and general outlook, with our endangered common future in perspective, and not to try any academic analysis of his life and work, which has been discussed and debated extensively for the last 5-6 decades by many. I myself referred to Sarvodaya as far back as 1979 in my Minis Getalu Pilibanda Bauddha Vigrahaya- ‘Human Problems in a Buddhist Perspective’ and called it ‘a new experiment’ in ‘Buddhist economics’ worthy to be taken seriously by those who are keen on alternative visions of development. By that time, the attention of academics and activists alike had started taking note of Sarvodaya and viewing it, some with skepticism and many others with hope.\nIt is known that the initial inspiration for ATA for activism came from the Gandhian concept of Sarvodaya, starting from the individual, finally, encompassing and extending to the entire universe. The economic wellbeing particularly of the deprived segments of the society was at the heart of the movement, and it exhibited a will to transcend the narrow social limits such as caste and class, and deep-rooted ideologies motivated by religion and politics, factors that have been powerful in keeping the people separated and opposed to one another. The first-ever ‘shramadana’ organised by Sarvodaya conducted in a marginalised village, Kantholuva, in the Kurunegala district highlighted these orientations of the organisation. What appeared to be a relatively simple act of welfare was, infact, a public statement of a new vision and alternative model of development to the world, which was marked almost exclusively by drive for material abundance and consumption.\nGandhian philosophy\nThe philosophical basis for this new vision was to be articulated gradually. Inspired initially by the Gandhian philosophy and activism, ATA was discovering his own local religious and cultural roots concurrently with his activism. Born and grew up in a village in the Southern Sri Lanka, it is not unusual that ATA’s knowledge of Buddhism was what he gathered from the village temple, village elders and his school, Mahinda College, Galle, a school known for its Buddhist orientation. ATA’s association with Professor Kalupahana, who taught at the University of Hawaii, and lived there, began initially as school mates in the same Mahinda College.\nThey shared an interest in Buddhism, ATA as an activist and Kalupahana as an academic. Kalupahana, being a pragmatist in his own philosophical orientation, i.e. one who looks for ‘cash-value’ in philosophical thoughts, was obviously a good ‘theoretician’ for ATA. I remember, somewhere in the mid-1980s, ATA meeting with Kalupahana at his residence in Hawaii. They discussed, among other things, the Buddhist philosophical foundations of social activism.Being a graduate student of Kalupahana, I happened to be there mostly as a mere on-looker and listener.It was quite obvious that finally the two eminent people were influenced by each other. I know that Professor Kalupahana had a great sense of admiration toward ATA.\nMuch has been discussed on ATA’s Buddhist economics. But the term, ‘Buddhist economics’ was first popularised by E.F. Schumacher in his Small is Beautiful (1973),’ now a classic. Although ATA himself (to my knowledge) did not use the term at the beginning, many others saw ATA’s activism from this perspective. By 1990s, ATA had been identified as a leading practitioner of what came to be known as ‘socially engaged Buddhism.’ It was in fact identified with three of its key exponents -Thich Nhat Han, world famous Buddhist monk from Vietnam, and Sulak Shivaraksa of Thailand, and of course, ATA, its Sri Lankan practitioner.\nEntire human society\nA remarkable feature of ATA’s Buddhist orientation is that he demonstrated in his activism the principle that to be inspired by the great teachings of the Buddha is not tantamount to be drawn into parochial limitations of religious exclusivism. His focus was the entire human society, in fact, all sentient beings, articulated in the ancient Indian wisdom as, ‘udaracaritanamtu- vasudhaivakutumbikam’ – for the great minded, the earth is like his family’ and in Buddhism, ‘sabbesattabhavantusukhitatta’ – may ALL beings be happy.’ Sarvodaya, in ATA’s vision, is flourishing of all, ‘all’ meaning, all.\nAriyaratne’s broad outlook and vision was recognised by people all over the world including this country itself. It may not be out of context here to note that ATA was appointed by Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaranatunga government as a member of the Human Rights Commission of the country. That his impartiality and broad-mindedness has been uncontested is testified by the fact that he was appointed to the Constitutional Assembly and similar other apex bodies by the subsequent governments to represent the society at large. And, it must be said that he served in these institutions without accepting any financial rewards or remunerations.\nHumanism and universalism of ATA can be elaborated on further. The reality, however, is that Sarvodaya has completed 65 years of its functioning and ATA has now passed away, a good enough duration to taking stock and passing a judgment. However, my approach is different. The world is not something that draws to a definitive end the story of which we maybe concluded as – “then all lived happily ever after.” One crucial thing that all the great movements in the world and all great personalities who have lived in the world tell is that nothing or none is final or ultimate. If it were the case, the world would have been morally perfect and peaceful ever since the Buddha taught in the 6th century BCE. Or the world would have been without war ever since Asoka gave up war after having won one decisive war-just two examples from the history of the world. In like manner, neither Sarvodaya nor ATA are concluding chapters of a great book. They will continue to remain as sources of inspiration for the world. They are on-going and continuing chapters of an ever-evolving book which the present and future generations need to continue writing in their own contexts.\nLegendary life\nFinally, all of us know that we have our own physical limitations. The legendary life of ATA has reached an end. For an elderly couple who complained about their physical ailments, the Buddha advised: “It is nothing but naive to expect our bodies to be perfectly and perpetually healthy; but make sure that your mind is healthy”! With his broad humanism and universalism, and the alertness he displayed up to the very last moment of his life,I feel, ATA exemplified what the Buddha said. The Buddhist dictum, manasambhaveyeaparimanam’ – cultivate a boundless mind- reminds us that we can, irrespective of our physical limitations, be limitless in ourattitudes, thoughts, words and deeds. And this seems to be the ultimate way of life to be rationally adopted in a globalised reality as ours today.\nEven those who contest his vision for development would agree that Ariyaratne was nearly a saint. He had a perpetual smile on his face. He continued to believe his philosophy of non-violence–avihimsa–until his last moment. Perhaps, the details of his concept of ‘Buddhist economics’ may need revisiting and re-working. But what could continue and needs to be cherished is compassion and universalism Ariyaratne practiced throughout his life and his commitment to the philosophy of economics based universal loving kindness – metta.\nMay Dr. A. T. Ariyaratne realise the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!",

    "text": "Inspección Judicial confirma investigación contra exfiscal por asumir cargo en Gobierno sin permiso\n- Fiscal subrogante solicitó investigar intentos de “burlar procedimiento” para trabajar en el Micitt\nEsteban Aguilar Vargas, el exfiscal coordinador de Cibercrimen del Ministerio Público, es investigado a nivel disciplinario por la Inspección Judicial, debido a que se asumió un cargo en el gobierno de Rodrigo Chaves Robles sin contar con el permiso del Poder Judicial.\nEl fiscal es hermano de Gabriel Aguilar, el jefe del despacho presidencial de Chaves, y fue escogido personalmente por Paula Bogantes, ministra de Ciencia, Innovación, Tecnología y Telecomunicaciones (Micitt), entre 10 candidatos, para designarlo como subdirector Nacional de Ciberseguridad.\nSin embargo, un oficio del cual CR Hoy tiene copia, demuestra una serie de maniobras de Aguilar para aparentemente evadir el permiso que, por ley, debe obtener el funcionario judicial para poder trabajar en una institución fuera, en otra rama estatal.\nEl Poder Judicial confirmó hoy la apertura de un nuevo expediente por estos hechos en concreto.\n“Sobre su consulta concreta se indica que la Inspección Judicial procedió abrir la causa disciplinaria número 25-001326-0031-DI, la misma se encuentra en investigación sin traslado de cargos”, señalaron ante la consulta de este medio.\nEl cargo que ocupa este exfiscal no existía hasta hace poco, que no había sido ocupado por nadie y que ni siquiera es financiado por la misma cartera, sino por la Promotora de Comercio Exterior (Procomer).\nTal como reveló CR Hoy el pasado viernes, Esteban Aguilar no tiene permiso para haber salido del Ministerio Público hacia otra entidad pública.\nVer más\nFiscalía pide investigar a Esteban Aguilar por \"burlar procedimiento\" para trabajar en el Micitt\nEl Consejo Superior, máximo órgano administrativo judicial, no ha emitido ninguna autorización formal y, según el artículo 44 de la Ley Orgánica del Poder Judicial, cualquier servidor debe contar con un visto bueno explícito para laborar en otra área del sector público.\nLa investigación inició a solicitud de la fiscal subrogante, Karen Valverde, quien señaló tajantemente que Aguilar pretendía “burlar el procedimiento normativo establecido” para conseguir una autorización e irse a trabajar al gobierno chavista.\nDe acuerdo con el documento que motivó la apertura de una causa, Esteban Aguilar actuó de mala fe y de forma desleal, cometiendo lo que parece ser un abuso de derecho, posiblemente para simular que sí tenía el permiso para irse al Micitt.\nPor esa razón, Valverde envió un oficio explicando paso a paso lo que ocurrió, para que el órgano disciplinario pueda actuar.\n“La información facilitada por el señor Aguilar Vargas a la Secretaría de la Corte Suprema de Justicia fue para inducir a error a la institución y que se creyera falsamente que se contaba con un permiso sin goce salarial para trabajar en el sector público.\nAsí burlar el procedimiento normativo establecido para la gestión de interés e iniciar labores en el Poder Ejecutivo sin estar autorizado para ello”, manifestó Valverde en el oficio.\nAsí trató de burlar a superiores\nLa fiscala Karen Valverde ha estado a cargo de tramitar un permiso sin goce salarial que Esteban Aguilar solicitó desde el 3 de marzo, con la intención de ausentarse por un año sin perder la plaza en el Poder Judicial.\nEsto se debe a que el funcionario ha alegado supuesta persecución laboral por parte del fiscal general, Carlo Díaz, quien desmintió las acusaciones tiempo atrás. En esa misma fecha, Aguilar presentó una incapacidad laboral para ausentarse del 3 al 17 de marzo.\nMediante la resolución 27-2025 de la Fiscalía General de la República, el 17 de marzo se concedió el permiso sin goce de salario que regiría a partir del 18 de marzo de 2025 hasta la misma fecha de 2026. Para plantear la solicitud, solo alegó motivos de salud.\nEn ese documento se recordó a Aguilar que, según la ley, existen prohibiciones para los trabajadores judiciales, y que no podía quebrantar el objetivo del permiso ni la causa que lo motivaba. En caso de requerir una autorización para un fin diferente, debía hacer la gestión específica y respectiva.\nAl día siguiente, el fiscal de Cibercrimen presentó una segunda licencia médica para ampliar su ausencia del 18 al 31 de marzo, y además pidió cambiar la fecha del permiso.\nEse mismo día participó en una marcha convocada por el mandatario contra el fiscal general, e incluso se subió a la misma tarima que Chaves y habló contra Carlo Díaz, estando incapacitado. Por esa razón, se abrió una investigación administrativa en su contra.\nEl 24 de marzo comienzan a cambiar las versiones: Esteban Aguilar remitió un nuevo correo electrónico a esta jefatura, así como al Consejo Superior del Poder Judicial, con el fin de solicitar un permiso sin goce de salario del 1.º de abril de 2025 hasta 2026, por haber sido seleccionado para laborar como subdirector de Ciberseguridad del Micitt.\nPor esa razón, la Secretaría General de la Corte inició la gestión y le advirtió al fiscal de Cibercrimen que debía aportar documentación, como una constancia emitida por la Inspección Judicial que indicara que no tenía causas pendientes, el visto bueno escrito por parte de la jefatura y un documento del Micitt que señalara las fechas del nombramiento.\nEl pasado 31 de marzo, la Fiscalía General emitió la resolución n.º 39, en la cual señaló que avalaba el permiso para ausentarse y que no se oponía a su traslado al Gobierno, “sin perjuicio de lo que resuelva el Consejo Superior del Poder Judicial ante la solicitud de permiso”.\nEse mismo día, a tan solo horas de su ingreso al Micitt, Aguilar Vargas respondió un correo indicando que solo faltaba “únicamente ya la autorización del superior”, es decir, su jefe, para que el Consejo Superior tramitara su solicitud al día siguiente, martes 1.º de abril.\nPor esa razón, en la Fiscalía reenviaron la resolución en la que no se oponían al aval, a sabiendas de que se debía valorar el cumplimiento de los requisitos formales y sustanciales que debía revisar el Consejo.\nSin embargo, ese mismo martes, Esteban Aguilar retiró el trámite y desistió de pedir el aval para irse al Micitt, bajo el argumento de que su jefatura le había concedido el permiso sin goce salarial para trabajar en el Poder Ejecutivo.\nDebido a todo este embrollo gestado por el funcionario, la fiscal subrogante emitió una aclaración especificando que nunca autorizó su traslado al Micitt, sino solamente su ausencia, y pidió investigar el actuar de Aguilar.\nNo me atribuí una competencia que no me corresponde, se advirtió al señor Aguilar Vargas de forma reiterada en las resoluciones señaladas y en el correo dirigido al Consejo Superior, encargado del trámite de la gestión.\nDebe observarse que las gestiones presentadas por esta persona a la Fiscalía General se han atendido mediante resoluciones por lo que tampoco es aceptable considerar que sobre el cambio del objetivo del permiso sin goce de salario para trabajar se vaya a omitir la obligación de sustentar formal y sustancialmente tal decisión. (…)\nNo es válido considerar que el visto bueno que se otorga por esta jefatura para el trámite del permiso sin goce de salario, amparado en el artículo 44 de cita, pueda o deba suplir la decisión que le corresponde al Consejo Superior o si fuera del caso a quien este órgano disponga. (…)\nVer más\nInspección Judicial tuvo que recurrir al OIJ para notificar a exfiscal de 3 causas que estaban por prescribir\nEl pasado miércoles, en entrevista con CR Hoy, la jerarca confirmó que el exfiscal empezó a trabajar en el Micitt el martes 1º de abril, fecha de inicio de su nombramiento temporal. “Ya él comenzó el día de ayer”, replicó Bogantes ante una pregunta directa.\nEste funcionario salió del Ministerio Público en medio de acusaciones y polémicas con su superior jerárquico. Allí laboró sin mayores resultados operativos durante los últimos años y acumuló varias investigaciones disciplinarias, múltiples viajes y algunas controversias.\nAlabado por el mandatario Rodrigo Chaves y por la ministra de Ciencia y Tecnología, el exfiscal de Cibercrimen fue nombrado en el Gobierno tras salir de forma controvertida de la Fiscalía, en medio de varios escándalos.\nPese a los halagos, los informes de labores de Esteban Aguilar muestran que durante los últimos años él únicamente destacó por participar en reuniones, viajes, talleres, charlas, capacitaciones y entrevistas, sin mayores resultados operativos.\nEn 2023 y el primer semestre del 2024, no se registró ni un juicio, acusación, operativo o trámite de medidas cautelares por causas penales, a pesar de que la función principal de los fiscales es precisamente la persecución penal.\nSolo se reportó un allanamiento y dos acusaciones hacia la segunda mitad del año pasado.",
