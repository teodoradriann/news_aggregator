The trucks were also spray painted.\nJust a week prior, a Tesla charging station in Littleton was set on fire. Firefighters say seven chargers burned.",

    "text": "‘My hair is breaking really badly. I have relaxed hair that is 4b I think but every time I wash it, I see lots of little hairs. What should I do to stop the breakage??’\nI get clones of this question from naturals and relaxed ladies so often in my inbox and even though I have addressed it many many , many times, it seems I need to provide a refresher course. So here we go:\n1. Moisture – Newbies to the haircare world would be best placed to start off moisturizing more often. By moisture I am talking about H20 water and not any fancy conditioners or moisturizing creams .\nGet your hair wet more often is the best advice I can give to a newbie then we can tweak your regimen from there. Washing your hair weekly will keep your hair’s moisture levels optimal. Use a moisturizing conditioner and also remember to seal the moisture in after the wash with a good coating oil .\n2. Protein – Protein is what our strands are made of and any manipulation however gentle leads to the loss of protein. People don’t usually associate combing, washing , styling with or without heat or your hair rubbing on your clothes as activities that lead to protein loss but they definitely are.\nWe lose billions of skin cells daily so it stands to reason that we are also constantly losing cells from our hair too. But unlike skin, hair cells are not continually replaced so we are left with the responsibility of replenishing that protein ourselves. Make sure you keep up with your hard protein treatments every 6-8 weeks.\n3. Don’t touch it! – Manipulation is the single biggest killer of hair strands . Think dreadlocks. They tend to grow very long because they are the ultimate low manipulation hairstyle.\nWhile you don’t have to grow dreadlocks to have long hair, keeping your length is much easier than growing it out for many people, so an option is to keep your hair in weaves, braids, twists or wigs majority of the time then use a great regimen to maintain the length.\nSome people choose to reduce breakage by transitioning to natural, a technique that has worked a charm for me. Alternatively you may choose to continue relaxing but pay attention to how long you process your hair or deliberately under-process your hair ( texlax or texturize ) to keep some of your natural hair strength.\nIt’s important to point out, even though it may not be what a lot of you want to hear, with over processed relaxed hair or severely heat damaged hair, stopping breakage is not entirely possible. You have to concentrate on getting your hair care practices on point to prevent future breakage on the newer hair growing in.",

    "text": "NBC News Winter storms to bring heavy snow and flash flooding to the Midwest and Northeast Mirna Alsharif and Kathryn Prociv March 22, 2024 at 7:48 PM · 3 min read Link Copied Read full article\nTwo winter storms are expected to bring heavy snow, strong winds, severe thunderstorms and flash flooding to many parts of the northern U.S. starting Friday into next week.\nWinter alerts are up for 32 million people Friday and Saturday from the northern Rocky Mountains and Upper Midwest through the central Great Lakes region and into New England.\nThe first storm will move quickly and bring snow to eastern Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan Friday, and the interior Northeast and New England Saturday. Light to moderate snow is expected in an area stretching from the Upper Midwest to the Great Lakes, where 2 to 7 inches of snow will fall overnight.\nA Winter Storm Watch has been issued for Central MN and NW WI as heavy snow and strong winds are expected to move in Sunday. Our weekend crew will be working hard to keep you updated as details become more clear with hi-res guidance coming in today and tomorrow. #mnwx #wiwx pic.twitter.com/RRp8B0RKJ1\n— NWS Twin Cities (@NWSTwinCities) March 22, 2024\nSnow amounts Saturday and into the night in northern New England will be as high as 12 to 18 inches.\nThe second storm will kick off Sunday and could bring higher accumulations of snow and stronger winds to the Upper Midwest than the first storm. Unlike the first storm, however, it will not bring accumulating snow to New England.\nSunday's snow and wind will impact North and South Dakota, Minnesota and northern Wisconsin. On Monday the storm will slow down and strengthen over the Upper Midwest, bringing continuous snow and strong wind gusts to the Dakotas and Minnesota. The snow will continue until at least midday Tuesday.\nSnow accumulations during the storm could be as high as 12 to 18 inches in parts of Minnesota, including the Minneapolis metro area and Duluth.\nThe area spanning from the Dakotas into western Minnesota is known as \"blizzard alley,\" and this region may live up to its name early next week. Winds are forecasted to be as high as 35 to 40 mph, which could bring blizzard conditions, especially on Monday and Tuesday.\nIn south Florida and southern New England, 53 million people are under flood watches. Cities in the risk zone include Miami, Washington, D.C., New York City and Boston.\nAfter a cool day today with highs in the 40s, rain will develop tonight, with a 6-8 hour period of moderate to heavy rain expected from late Saturday morning into Saturday evening. Flood watches are in effect for Saturday and Saturday night. #NYwx #NJwx #CTwx pic.twitter.com/pdfV0FLuEY\n— NWS New York NY (@NWSNewYorkNY) March 22, 2024\nOn Friday, the flood risk is highest for south Florida, where 6 to 7 inches of rain could fall. Severe thunderstorms capable of high winds and isolated tornadoes will also be possible, especially for the Florida Keys.\nThe flood risk will shift to southern New England Saturday, where a widespread 2 to 4 inches is expected, including for the Interstate 95 corridor. Isolated areas of more than 4 inches cannot be ruled out, especially for coastal areas.\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com\nView comments",

    "text": "Brush Karne Ka Sahi Time Kya Hai: ओरल हाइजीन का ख्याल रखने के लिए रोज दांतों को ब्रश करना बेहद जरूरी है. ब्रश करने से न केवल दांतों की सफाई होती है, बल्कि मुंह में मौजूद बैक्टीरिया भी कम हो जाते हैं. अब, ये बात तो अधिकतर लोग जानते हैं. लेकिन क्या आपको पता है कि ब्रश करने का सही टाइम क्या है? डेंटल एक्सपर्ट्स बताते हैं कि दांतों का ख्याल रखने के लिए दिन में दो बार ब्रश करना और महंगा टूथपेस्ट इस्तेमाल करना काफी नहीं है, इससे अलग सही समय पर ब्रश करना भी बेहद जरूरी है. 90% लोग गलत समय पर ब्रश करते हैं, जिससे दांतों में सड़न बढ़ने लगती है और उम्र से पहले ही दांत गिरने लगते हैं. ऐसे में आइए जानते हैं ओरल हाइजीन और दांतों का ख्याल रखने के लिए ब्रश करने का सही तरीका और सही समय क्या है.\nदही खाने का सही तरीका क्या है? डॉक्टर ने बताया इस तरह खाने से सेहत पर पड़ता है बुरा असर\nक्या कहते हैं एक्सपर्ट?\nदरअसल, हाल ही में डेंटिस्ट मादरी शाह, अनोना अग्रवाल के पॉडकास्ट का हिस्सा बनने पहुंची थीं. यहां उन्हें ओरल हाइजीन को लेकर कई जरूरी जानकारी दीं. इस दौरान डेंटिस्ट ने बताया, अक्सर हम सोचते हैं कि अगर हम दिन में दो बार ब्रश कर रहे हैं और अच्छा टूथपेस्ट इस्तेमाल कर रहे हैं, तो हमारे दांत पूरी तरह सुरक्षित हैं. लेकिन कई लोग रात को खाना खाने के एक घंटे के अंदर ही ब्रश कर लेते हैं और फिर सो जाते हैं. बता दें कि ऐसा करना उल्टा नुकसानदायक हो सकता है.\nडेंटिस्ट बताती हैं, खाने के तुरंत बाद मुंह में एसिड और बैक्टीरिया ज्यादा होते हैं. ऐसे में इस समय दांतों पर टूथब्रश रगड़ने से दांतों का इनेमल (बाहरी परत) कमजोर होने लगता है. इसके चलते दांत जल्दी सड़ने लगते हैं, सेंसिटिविटी बढ़ती है और मसूड़ों की समस्याएं भी शुरू हो जाती हैं. ऐसे में खाने के तुरंत बाद या आधे-एक घंटे बाद ब्रश करने से बचें. इससे अलग अपने खाने और ब्रश करने के समय में अच्छा अंतर रखें.इन बातों का भी रखें ध्यान\nडेंटल एक्सपर्ट ने और भी कई जरूरी बातें बताई हैं, जिन्हें ब्रश करते समय ध्यान में रखना जरूरी है. जैसे-\n- डॉ. मादरी शाह का कहना है कि ब्रश कभी भी हार्ड (कड़ा) नहीं होना चाहिए. दांतों को साफ करते समय हमेशा सॉफ्ट ब्रश का इस्तेमाल करें.\n- ब्रश करते वक्त उसे थोड़ा गीला जरूर कर लें. सूखे ब्रश से दांत साफ करने से इनेमल पर खरोंच आ सकती है.\n- इन सब से अलग डॉ. ब्रश करने के बाद जीभ और मसूड़ों की सफाई को भी जरूरी बताती हैं.\nडेंटिस्ट के मुताबिक, इन कुछ छोटी-छोटी बातों पर ध्यान देकर आप अपने दांतों और ओरल हाइजीन का सही तरीके से ध्यान रख सकते हैं.\nअस्वीकरण: सलाह सहित यह सामग्री केवल सामान्य जानकारी प्रदान करती है. यह किसी भी तरह से योग्य चिकित्सा राय का विकल्प नहीं है. अधिक जानकारी के लिए हमेशा किसी विशेषज्ञ या अपने चिकित्सक से परामर्श करें. एनडीटीवी इस जानकारी के लिए ज़िम्मेदारी का दावा नहीं करता है.\nNDTV.in पर ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों को ट्रैक करें, व देश के कोने-कोने से और दुनियाभर से न्यूज़ अपडेट पाएं",

    "text": "Venezuela anuncia ejercicio militar y acusa al Reino Unido de “provocación hostil” por buque en las costas de Guyana\nmacamilarincon\n(CNN Español) –– El presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, anunció este jueves que ordenó una acción conjunta defensiva en respuesta a lo que señaló como una “provocación del Reino Unido” luego de que inicialmente la BBC reportara, citando al Ministerio de Defensa británico, que se enviaría un buque patrullero a las costas de Guyana.\n¿Cómo es la riqueza del Esequibo y cómo contribuyó al crecimiento exponencial de Guyana?\n“Por eso he ordenado la activación de una acción conjunta de toda la fuerza armada nacional militar bolivariana sobre el caribe oriental de Venezuela, sobre la fachada atlántica, una acción conjunta de carácter defensiva como respuesta a la provocación y a la amenaza del Reino Unido contra la paz y la soberanía de nuestro país”, afirmó Maduro durante la ceremonia de salutación de fin de año a la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana (FANB).\nLa reacción de Venezuela sigue a un reporte de la BBC del domingo en el que indicaba, citando al Ministerio de Defensa, que el Reino Unido se preparaba para “enviar un buque de guerra a Guyana en una muestra de apoyo diplomático y militar a la antigua colonia británica”.\n¿Qué sigue ahora en la disputa entre Venezuela y Guyana por el Esequibo? Puntos claves del acuerdo y posibles escenarios\nEl HMS Trent, un patrullero de la Marina británica, agregó la BBC, visitará Guyana, “aliado regional y socio de la Commonwealth, a finales de este mes como parte de una serie de compromisos en la región durante su despliegue de tareas de patrulla en el Atlántico”. El Ministerio de Defensa del Reino Unido confirmó a CNN en Londres esta declaración.\nMaduró calificó a la respuesta venezolana como “acción conjunta militar general Domingo Sifonte” en honor al general que Maduro considera héroe de la Guyana Esequiba y a quien, además, se le rendirá homenaje en enero “trayendo sus restos a que descanse definitivamente en el panteón de los héroes de Venezuela”.\nVenezuela y Guyana acuerdan seguir con diálogo sobre disputa del Esequibo\nLa Cancillería de Venezuela publicó un comunicado en rechazo a la llegada del buque británico y advirtió a la Comunidad del Caribe (Caricom) y a la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños (Celac) de que las acciones contradicen el entendimiento acordado el 14 de diciembre entre Venezuela y Guyana.\n“La presencia de la nave militar es extremadamente grave, ya que viene acompañada de declaraciones por parte de voceros políticos y militares de quien fungió como despojador de la Guyana Esequiba, el cual insiste en inmiscuirse en dicha controversia”, dice el comunicado.\nEl encuentro que se llevó a cabo el 14 de diciembre entre los mandatarios de Guyana y Venezuela en San Vicente y las Granadinas cerró con el compromiso de mantener la vía diplomática como el único camino para resolver el conflicto, y se estableció el acuerdo de 11 puntos suscrito por las partes y los mediadores de ambos países.\n“Venezuela insta a las autoridades guyanesas a tomar medidas inmediatas para el retiro del buque HMS Trent, y abstenerse de seguir involucrando a potencias militares en la controversia territorial”, afirma el comunicado.\nCNN está intentando comunicarse con el Ministerio de Defensa del Reino Unido por los informes de que personal militar venezolano participará en ejercicios militares en el golfo de Paria en respuesta al despliegue del HMS Trent en Guyana.\nOsmary Hernández colaboró con este reporte.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "Uganda First Lady Janet Museveni tests positive for Coronavirus – Nairobi News",
    "text": "Uganda President Yoweri Museveni says his wife, First Lady Janet, has tested positive for Coronavirus.\nThe long-serving Head of State, aged 79, announced on X, formerly Twitter.\nThe First Lady, referred to as Maama Janet by her husband of five decades, doubles up as the Minister for Education and Sports.\n“On Christmas day, after a family lunch, Maama Janet started feeling kukarakaatwa (sandy feeling) in the throat. We did a Rapid Corona test, which was negative. However, we sent another sample to Mbarara for PCR test and it came back positive,” explained Museveni.\n“Indeed, Maama was feeling weak, with headache sometimes and with the kukarakaatwa. Immediately, on the 26th morning, I had to carry out a test on myself so that we decided to manage the problem. The tests came back negative by afternoon.”\nThe First Lady, 75, is in isolation and has commenced treatment, the President added.\n“We, therefore, decided for Maama to self- isolate in one of the houses at Rwakyitura while I continue with the programmes that we had arranged but not ones where Maama was involved. That is why we could not go to Kyenkwanzi or to Hon. Kaboyo’s function.”\nDespite the setback, Museveni indicated that he will continue to discharge his duties.\n“What is of interest is how I remained negative despite being with Maama all these days- sharing the room, the air-conditioned car to Entebbe and back to Nakasero. Was it because I am emponoka (survivor) of Corona of last May? Maama is now a first-time corona warrior. She is doing well.”\nIn June 2023, Museveni, who has ruled Uganda for 37 years, announced he had contracted Coronavirus and consequently proceeded on ‘forced leave’.\nAt the time, the First Lady tested negative.\nCoronavirus is an infectious disease that causes patients to experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and mainly recover without requiring special treatment. The World Health Organisation (WHO) however explains that some patients can become seriously ill while older people with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, or cancer could suffer complications.\nA coronavirus outbreak in 2020 led to a global shutdown.\nAlso read: DPP consents to release of Sh400 million frozen Rwandan investors money\nKioni alleges plot to ‘illegally’ change the Constitution",

She is then seen crawling behind him on all fours, bringing the report to a halt.\nAksamit later posted the footage to Facebook with the comment: “When you quickly discover the potential pitfalls of bringing your four-year-old daughter with you for a … live snow report.”\nThe video has since been viewed 300,000 times and many viewers rightly delighted by the daughter’s antics.\n“Best news broadcast I have seen today,” wrote one fan to Facebook.\n“Almost made me spew coffee when I saw just the top of (her) hat crawl by!” said another.\n“I’ve watched this at least a dozen times. Please keep taking her to work with you!” penned another\nWhile another added: “When it’s a snow day and it becomes bring your child to work day, this is what happens! Can’t beat that big ole grin on her face!”\nAdvertise with us",
