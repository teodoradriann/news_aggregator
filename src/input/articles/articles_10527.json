    "text": "The coming boom in artificial intelligence represents both a threat and an opportunity for the clean energy transition, market experts suggest.\nNo longer purely in the realm of the tech sector, AI has in recent years become an energy industry issue, The Canadian Press reports . The expected rapid rollout of the energy-hungry data centres needed to power the AI revolution has captured the attention of everyone from gas drillers to electricity grid operators to renewable energy developers.\n“AI is very, very energy-hungry. Anything you do with AI consumes a lot of power,” Ed Crooks, vice-chair for the Americas at analytics firm Wood Mackenzie, told the Energy Disruptors: Unite conference in Calgary Wednesday.\n“If you’re talking about creating an image with AI… that uses about 10,000 times the power of a simple Google search.”\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, the world’s data centres consumed roughly 1.4 to 1.7% of global electricity use in 2022. But the IEA projects data centre energy consumption will double by the end of 2026 as AI workloads become more operationally complex.\nIn the United States, data centre capacity is expected to double within the next five years, said Crooks. He added Wood Mackenzie foresees North American electricity demand increasing by 50% by 2050, in part due to the rapid rollout of data centres but also because of electric vehicle demand, electrification of home heating, and other trends.\nIn Canada—where there are already an estimated 239 data centres operating coast to coast, according to figures released Wednesday by the Canada Energy Regulator—utilities are already incorporating expected AI-related demand growth into their forecasting.\nHydro-Québec, for example, anticipates an increase of 4.1 terawatt-hours in electricity demand from data centres between 2023 and 2032. That’s about 2% of the province’s electricity production in 2022.\nIn many parts of the world, Crooks said the fastest and cheapest way to meet AI’s growing needs for reliable, on-demand electricity is to build new natural gas-fired power plants.\nBut other analyses disagree , and Crooks said any move to increase dependence on gas would be a big problem when countries need to wean themselves off other fossil fuels to meet global climate targets.\n“If in 2050, we are using more natural gas than we’re using now, and if actually demand is still rising, then that has very, very serious implications for the climate,” Crooks said.\nYet many Canadian gas drillers are already expressing optimism about what data centre growth could mean for the future of their industry, which is currently challenged by extremely low commodity prices. Pipeline companies such as Calgary-based Enbridge Inc. and TC Energy Corporation are also eyeing data centre electricity demand as a potential opportunity for revenue growth.\nBut Crooks said Big Tech is well aware of their industry’s growing electricity needs, and is increasingly choosing to invest directly in its own power infrastructure. Last week, Reuters reported that investors with control over hundreds of billions of dollars are looking for more information on future energy demand for AI and advanced computing before deciding whether tech giants like Microsoft and Alphabet should retain their high status in major sustainability funds.\n“If the companies were to loosen current commitments to source renewable energy now and in the future, managers may choose to exclude them from some of the more strictly-defined funds,” the news agency wrote .\n“We are waiting for more details about their AI-related power consumption, the volume of their PPAs [power purchase agreements for renewable electricity], the geographic distribution, the duration,” said Jason Qi, senior ESG research analyst for Calvert Research and Management, a division of Morgan Stanley.\n“What we will do is make the AI angle a central part of our climate-related engagement with tech companies,” said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management, which has €265 billion (US$399 billion) under management and holds €17 billion in companies like Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia. “Where we have committed a proportion to sustainable investments in our internal ESG scoring, you might see it becoming harder for those companies to fulfill that.”\nCrooks said tech behemoths Amazon, Meta, and Google are already among the biggest corporate buyers of wind and solar energy and have played a key role in the growth of the renewable energy industry. CP reports.\nGoogle is also backing a new geothermal project in Nevada to power some of its data centres with clean electricity, and Microsoft recently signed a 20-year power purchase agreement to support the restart of a nuclear power unit at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.\n“The fact that AI is consuming so much energy can accelerate the innovation of the technologies required to decarbonize,” said Ana Domingues, who leads energy and resource AI efforts globally for professional services firm EY.\n“That’s because we are talking about the companies that have deep pockets.”\nDomingues said she is optimistic the growth of AI will prompt large companies to make investments in the clean energy technologies the world needs to meet its climate goals.\nBut she also warned that building these technologies takes time, and in the interim, AI is poised to place a great deal of pressure on electricity grids around the globe.\n“You already have countries—the Netherlands, Germany, the UK—that are facing real congestion problems (on their grids),” Domingues told CP on the sidelines of the Calgary energy conference on Wednesday.\n“You will start having more blackouts from severe weather events and from congestion on the grid—that is, the inability to handle so many things plugged into the grid.”\nEarly last month, analysts at Oslo-based Rystad Energy reported that Germany is on track to exceed its target to produce 80% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The country’s renewable capacity hit 170 gigawatts in 2023, up 12% in just a year, including 81.7 GW of solar and 60.9 GW of wind. Two weeks later, Jennifer Morgan, Germany’s first-ever state secretary and special envoy for international climate action, told media the counry will be looking to Canada for green hydrogen exports, but not so much for natural gas, as the country continues its shift off fossil fuels.\n“All studies show that the market is going to shrink,” she said. “Germany will be driving forward on renewables, and gas demand will decline.”\nThe main body of this report was first published by The Canadian Press on Oct. 2, 2024.",

    "text": "Arizona mail carrier retiring after 53 years on the job; first delivered letters on Navy ship in 1971 PEORIA, AZ (AZFamily) — Sorting mail and organizing deliveries doesn’t sound like a glamorous job, but don’t tell that to Randy McLaughlin, whose dream as a young boy growing up in Gila Bend, Arizona, was to become a mailman. “I was always intrigued by what went on inside, how it all went down and was delivered,” said McLaughlin. “I would always look in back and say this is what I want to do when I’m old enough to do it.” McLaughlin’s love of delivering mail took off when he joined the Navy in 1971 and delivered letters on his ship. He then accepted a position with the U.S. Postal Service. Five decades later, McLaughlin is still doing what he loves. “I thought about retiring five years ago, but the route I have is so nice, and the people are so nice, I just stayed a little longer,” said McLaughlin. The next thing I knew, it has been 53 years.” Arizona’s Family recently followed McLaughlin on his Peoria route. Customers are starting to learn that their long-time beloved mail carrier is retiring at the end of April. “I hate to be the person replacing him,” said homeowner Steve Fernandez. “That’s gonna be a tough one. When you replace somebody as good as he is, for as long as he’s done it, we will have to wait and see if they can live up to that.” One of the things that stands out about the veteran mail carrier is his old-school work ethic and dedication to doing the job right. His relationships with residents and business owners go beyond just delivering the mail. “I think he’s actually gone to lunch with some of his customers before,” said co-worker Carrie Willems. “He really goes that extra mile for personal customer service with his customers. They love him.” McLaughlin said the most challenging part of doing the job over all these years has been the summer heat in Arizona. Driving around in a mail truck with no air conditioning when it’s 110 degrees out is not easy. “This job is not for everyone, you have to have the right mindset to deal with the heat,” said McLaughlin. “People will bring you water, Gatorade, ask if I want something to drink,” said McLaughlin. “I wear towels and soak them in cold water and put them around my neck. It knocks it down about 15 degrees, which helps.” McLaughlin was asked what he’ll miss most when he retires. He said, seeing all the customers he serves every day. “They wave and beep at you when you go by, it makes you feel appreciated,” said McLaughlin. “If you like what you do, its easy to go to work every day.” When he retires, the long-time mail carrier plans to travel with his wife and play golf. While it won’t be the same as not coming to work, after 53 years, he’s earned the time off. See a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

    "text": "Derek Carr threw a season-high four touchdown passes and the host New Orleans Saints defeated the Atlanta Falcons 48-17 to keep their Wild Card hopes alive on Sunday afternoon. Carr passed for 264 yards while Kendre Miller had his biggest workload of the season in the absence of injured Alvin Kamara and rushed for 73 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries. The Saints (9-8) tied Tampa Bay for first place in the NFC South, but the Buccaneers won the division in a tie-breaker. Desmond Ridder, starting in place of injured Taylor Heinicke (ankle), passed for 291 yards with two touchdowns and an interception for the Falcons (7-10). Bijan Robinson rushed for just 28 yards, but he caught seven passes that went for 103 yards and a touchdown. The first possession of the second half ended when Alontae Taylor intercepted Ridder, giving the Saints a first down at the Falcons' 25. Two plays later, Carr threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Chris Olave to give New Orleans a 24-17 lead. The Saints pushed the lead to 31-17 when Carr threw a 39-yard touchdown pass to Rashid Shaheed. Atlanta had a chance to make it a one-score game, but on fourth and goal from the 2, Ridder threw an incompletion, leaving the Saints with a 14-point lead entering the fourth quarter. Blake Grupe kicked a 24-yard field goal after a 92-yard drive, then Carr threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to A.T. Perry and Jamaal Williams rushed 1 yard for a touchdown to close the scoring outburst in the fourth. On the Falcons' first possession of the game, Ridder's 56-yard completion to Scotty Miller set up his 15-yard touchdown pass to Jonnu Smith for a 7-0 lead. The Saints answered on the ensuing possession when Carr threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Perry. Two plays later, Ridder threw a short pass to Robinson, who broke free for a 71-yard touchdown reception and a 14-7 lead at the end of the first quarter. Miller's 3-yard touchdown run tied the score before Grupe kicked a 24-yard field goal and Younghoe Koo kicked a 30-yard field goal at the gun to produce a 17-all tie at halftime. --Field Level Media",

    "text": "Jaishankar calls for deeper cooperation among Bay of Bengal nations External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Thursday called upon the BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) countries to infuse new energies, new resources and a new commitment into cooperation among the seven members of the grouping. ”For India, BIMSTEC represents the intersection of its ‘Neighbourhood First’ outlook, the ‘Act East Policy’ and the ‘SAGAR’ vision,” he said while addressing the BIMSTEC Foreign Ministers’ Retreat. The meeting is being attended by the foreign ministers or senior representatives of the governments of India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Myanmar. Recalling that the BIMSTEC countries had last met in a similar format in Bangkok in July last year, Dr Jaishankar said much has happened since then and this should spur their endeavours to deepen and broaden the activities of BIMSTEC. The BIMSTEC Charter, for a start, has come into effect from 20 May this year. ”Global and regional developments also make it imperative that we find more solutions amongst ourselves,” he said. He said there are longstanding goals such as capacity-building and economic cooperation that have acquired a new urgency. ”And not least, a grouping that is so complementary and so congenial in its membership should surely harbour higher aspirations. Our hope is that these would be expressed as shared and ambitious BIMSTEC Vision.” Dr Jaishankar regretted that collaborative potential of the Bay of Bengal has long remained underrealised. ”Our challenge is to change that for the better, and to do so rapidly. The retreat is meant to exchange ideas openly, candidly and fruitfully. We all benefited from the last such exercise in Bangkok. This one now has a particular importance as it serves to prepare strong outcomes for the Summit to be held later in the year,” he said. The retreat in New Delhi, he said, would revolve around connectivity, institutional building, cooperation in trade and business, collaboration in health and space, digital public infrastructure, capacity building and societal exchanges, as well as weighing on the merits of new mechanisms.",
