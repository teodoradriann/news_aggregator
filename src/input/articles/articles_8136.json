    "text": "Story Highlights - Coinbase International has introduced Pepe (PEPE) perpetual futures, set to launch on April 18. - The launch of these futures has led to a more than 4% increase in PEPE's trading value. - Perpetual futures allow traders to speculate on price movements without an expiration date. Coinbase International, the global branch of a well-established cryptocurrency exchange, has added [ Pepe (PEPE) perpetual futures](https://coingape.com/binance-list-pepe-coin-and-myro-perpetuals-with-50x-leverage/). Scheduled to be put into service on April 18th, this upgrade is an important step in the platform’s development. These funds make it possible for traders to deal with constant price movements without an expiration date. This financial instrument allows trading through speculation based on expectations of price change without bothering about owning the asset. The announcement has positively impacted the trading value of Pepe, a popular meme coin. Following the news, the price of [PEPE increased](https://coingape.com/price/pepe-coin/#:~:text=Live%20Price%20of%20Pepe%20Coin,market%20cap%20stands%20at%20%242%2C901%2C018%2C867.) by over 4%. According to a recent Coingape price list, it is trading at $0. 74291035. Earlier in the day, it reached a peak of $0. 7431. Pepe Coin Reaches $3.1 Billion Market Cap Pepe coin, which was launched in April 2023, sits at the fourth position among all meme coins by market cap. As of the time of writing, it has a market value of $3.1 billion, as reported by CoinGecko. The coin employs the name Pepe the Frog, which is a character in a webcomic widely adopted and known. As a result, its author, Matt Furie, finds himself in the middle of controversies and all the unpleasantness that comes with it. The Forie has taken legal steps to ensure a better picture and avoid the mishandling of the character. There have been prior clashes, such as Coinbase marking Pepe as a “hate symbol.” However, unlike before, the community is not worried about that. Now, they are busy with the latest listing, which is the next step of the ancient disagreement among the states. By listing on the exchange, the currency gains additional legitimacy and increases in trading volume. Coinbase Enhances User Experience In a related development, Coinbase has announced further enhancements for its users. Specifically, UK-based customers can now purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies using [Apple Pay](https://coingape.com/just-in-apple-pay-joins-coinbase-for-secure-uk-cryptocurrency-transactions/). This integration offers a secure and private transaction experience, reflecting Coinbase’s commitment to user security and privacy. Recommended Articles Coinbase states that Apple Pay does not store card numbers on devices or servers. Instead, it uses a unique device account number. This number is encrypted and stored securely, ensuring user data protection. This move underlines Coinbase’s commitment to enhancing user convenience and security, facilitating easier and safer transactions.

    "text": "The four days of severe cold in the plains have worsened people's health. Hospitals are crowded with patients with cold, cough, fever, pneumonia and respiratory diseases. In many hospitals, the number of patients suffering from these cold-related diseases has increased by 45%. The situation is such that sugar and heart patients are being advised to be especially careful. The cold wave has increased the pricking sensation of cold. Headaches are being triggered due to wind on the head. The cold air entering the body through the nose and mouth also increases the problem of sinuses and tonsils. Actually, to tolerate the changing weather, one has to prepare the body and do regular yoga workouts, otherwise the risk of hypothermia also increases as the cold increases.\nThe normal temperature of our body should be 37 degrees Celsius but in this season, the temperature of the body also falls due to the rapid fall in temperature and when it falls below 35 degrees Celsius, it becomes a danger to health. When this condition occurs, the body feels very shivering and tired, and one feels more sleepy but ignoring these symptoms can be dangerous. Because it directly affects the function of the heart and nervous system, sometimes a person even loses his life. But if someone gets 'hypothermia', then how to warm that person's body? What should be given to eat and drink so that he gets immediate energy? And is this danger also there for those soldiers who are ready on the snow-covered border? Everyone is at risk but look at the solution too. You also have to do the same because the cold will go away only with the heat of yoga and if it is your question, then only Swami Ramdev will tell the solution for it.\nSigns of hypothermia\n- Constant sneezing\n- Watery eyes\n- Heaviness in the head\n- Chest tightness\n- Body pain\n- Fast breathing\nThyroid deficiency\n- Diabetes\n- Anemia\n- Lightweight\n- Dehydration\n- Cold Intolerance\n- Poor blood circulation\n- Low vitamin B-12\nIron will increase in the body - and cold intolerance will decrease\n- Parents\n- Beetroot\n- Pea\n- Pomegranate\n- Apple\n- Raisin\nFor Vitamin B-12\n- Dairy Products\n- Soybean\n- Walnut\n- Almond\n- Oats\nSugar will be controlled and cold will stay away\n- Take the juice of cucumber, bitter gourd and tomato\n- Drink decoction of Giloy-Neem\n- Do Mandukasana-Vakrasana Pavanmuktasana\n- Do Kapalabhati for 15 minutes\nSugar will be controlled - what to eat?\n- Eat 1 teaspoon of fenugreek powder daily\n- Eat 2 cloves of garlic in the morning\n- Eat spinach, bathua, cabbage, bitter gourd, gourd\nEffective in thyroid (Ayurvedic treatment)\n- Mulethi (Liquorice) is beneficial\n- Tulsi-Aloe Vera Juice\n- 1 teaspoon of Triphala daily\n- Ashwagandha and warm milk at night\n- Grind coriander seeds and drink them in water\nWhat to eat in the thyroid\n- Flaxseed\n- Coconut\n- Mulethi\n- Mushroom\n- Turmeric Milk\n- Cinnamon\nBP will remain normal if you include dates, cinnamon, raisins, carrots, ginger and tomato in your diet.\nALSO READ: [What to eat and what not to eat during pregnancy?

    "title": "Heat warnings from Environment Canada blanket parts of southwestern Saskatchewan",
    "text": "It might be time to crank up the air conditioning in your house and your car.\nEnvironment Canada has issued heat warnings for southwest Saskatchewan, with temperatures in the area expected to reach 32 C over the next two days, combined with overnight lows near 16 C.\nRead More:\nSwift Current, Moose Jaw, Assiniboia, Coronach, Eastend, Maple Creek and areas as far south as the U.S. border were all included in the warning. Producers in the southwest have already been struggling with dry conditions this season , prompting additional help from the provincial and federal governments .\nEric Dykes, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, said several other parts of the province, including Regina, are coming close to meeting the threshold for a heat warning.\nSwift Current, Moose Jaw, Assiniboia, Coronach, Eastend and Maple Creek were all included in the heat warning on Wednesday. (Environment Canada)\n“If it gets a couple degrees warmer than expected for today, then you might see that heat warning pushed ever so closer to Regina and perhaps areas just around the Swift Current, and Moose Jaw areas,” Dykes said.\nLloydminster is also under a heat warning, as daytime high temperatures are expected to get up to 30 C, combined with overnight lows near 14 C. Dykes said the Battlefords, Meadow Lake and Prince Albert are also getting close to reaching the threshold for a heat warning.\nEnvironment Canada uses a different threshold for heat warnings in those areas. For a warning to be issued, temperatures would need to reach a high of 29 C for two days in a row, combined with an overnight low of at least 16 C.\n“They will be monitoring the temperatures, and if they feel as though some of those temperatures will be a little bit warmer than forecast, they’ll certainly want to expand the heat warnings as necessary throughout the day,” Dykes said.\nWith hot weather in the forecast, the meteorologist said it’s important to wear hats, sunglasses and sunscreen, and to limit your time outside. He said it’s also important to check on seniors and not leave kids or pets out in a vehicle.\n“This is very hot weather, and it gets very hot in the cars with the sun beating down on it as well,” Dykes said. “If it’s too hot for you, it’s definitely going to be too hot for infants and also for your pets.”\nDykes said the heat warning is not going to stick around for too long.\n“We’re not looking at a long period of a heat wave of several days or a week. This will all pass with a cold front that comes through on Thursday night,” said Dykes.\n“We’ll see temperatures drop a few degrees on Thursday across the entirety of southern Saskatchewan, and then fall even further with some rain come the weekend.”\nOn top of the hot weather, Dykes said severe storms could roll through the western parts of the province, close to the Alberta border, on Wednesday evening. He said the storms may move towards Saskatoon and Regina, losing strength as they move east.\nDykes said both Saskatoon and Regina could get strong winds and hail as large as quarters, though no tornadoes are expected to form during the severe storms in the forecast.\nThe latest updates on the heat warnings can be found on Environment Canada’s website .\nRisks of overheating While the warmer temperatures could mean more pool days and patios in your future, it’s also important to take care not to overheat.\nDr. Carla Holinaty explained the spectrum of heat-related illnesses, ranging from mild to serious.\nOn the milder end is heat exhaustion, when people feel sick after spending too much time in the heat.\n“We tend to see things like headaches, nausea, dizziness, weakness. Maybe people are feeling really thirsty, they’re quite sweaty, and their body temperature starts to go up,” Holinaty explained.\nWhile you might develop a fever, Holinaty said the brain is unaffected by heat exhaustion. That changes with heat stroke, though, when overexposure to heat means a person’s body can’t keep up anymore.\n“You see those mental effects, so they’re confused, they’re unco-ordinated, they’re dizzy or they’re fainting, or they might even be unconscious. And this is a medical emergency,” Holinaty said.\nHolinaty said to call 911 when heat stroke occurs, because it compromises the brain and other internal organs.\nTo avoid symptoms progressing from mild to severe, Holinaty recommended drinking lots of water and moving to somewhere cooler while continuing to monitor your body.\nSome people are also more at risk of overheating, including older adults and children.\nHolinaty said if your kid is getting too hot, they might develop a heat rash or a headache.\n“Maybe they’re getting some muscle cramps in their arms or their legs and their belly, and they’re feeling like their muscles are sore. They’re really seeming more thirsty. They’re looking really hot and flushed,” she said.\nIn those cases, Holinaty says they’ve been in the heat too long and need to cool off quickly.\nPack on that SPF Hot and sunny days can also lead to sunburns.\nEven with all the sunscreen options available, Holinaty said she still gets patients coming in with severe sunburns.\n“Sometimes we’ll see people that have, you know, those big blisters, or they’re really sloughing off big chunks of the skin once those blisters have healed,” she said.\nNot only are sunburns painful, but Holinaty said they can also put people at risk of other skin complications, including cancer.\nPrevention is the best medicine for sunburns, but when they happen Holinaty recommended cooling the skin with cold showers or ice packs.\nIf you’ve developed big blisters or are unsure of whether you should seek medical treatment, Holinaty said to call your family doctor.\n–with files from 980 CJME’s Marija Robinson",
