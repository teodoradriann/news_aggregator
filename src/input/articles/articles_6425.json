The\nsalaryincrease will be effective on September 1, 2025, and will cover junior and mid-level staff.\nThe announcement about the wage hike comes just weeks after the\nIT companyrevealed its plans to lay off around 12,000 employees this year. In an email to employees on Wednesday, TCS CHRO Milind Lakkad and CHRO Designate K Sudeep informed that the wage hikes will be effective September 1, reported news agency PTI.\n“We are pleased to announce a compensation revision for all eligible associates in grades upto C3A and equivalent, covering 80 per cent of our workforce. This will be effective 1st September 2025,\" says the email seen by PTI.\nRelated News\n\"We would like to thank each one of you for your dedication and hard work, as we build the future of TCS together,” the mail added.\nHowever, the exact amount of the wage increase has not been disclosed by the company yet,\nAsked for comments, TCS in a statement said, “We can confirm that we will be issuing wage hikes to around 80 per cent of our employees effective 1st September 2025.”\nThe decision to reward and retain talent coincides with the company's decision to lay off over 12,000 or 2 per cent employees of its global workforce, primarily in middle and senior-level roles. TCS has described the\nlayoffsas part of a broader strategic initiative to become a \"future-ready organisation,\" focusing on investments in technologies, AI deployment, market expansion and workforce realignment, according to the company. \"TCS is on a journey to become a future-ready organisation. This includes strategic initiatives on multiple fronts, including investing in new-tech areas, entering new markets, deploying AI at scale for our clients and ourselves, deepening our partnerships, creating next-gen infrastructure, and realigning our workforce model,\" the company had said last month as the news of layoffs shook the IT industry.\n\"Towards this, a number of reskilling and redeployment initiatives have been underway. As part of this journey, we will also be releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible. This will impact about 2 per cent of our global workforce, primarily in the middle and the senior grades, over the course of the year,\" TCS had then said.\nThe layoffs at TCS have infact raised broader questions about the future of the IT industry, especially amid global economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and the growing impact of AI.\nAs it is, India's top IT services companies have delivered single-digit revenue growth in Q1 FY26, capping off a somewhat-sobering June quarter as macroeconomic instability and geopolitical tensions have weighed on global tech demand and delayed client decision-making, reported PTI.\nGet the latest Business News, Stock Markets, IPO Companies News, Breaking News Events on ET Now.

Storm Doncon, an agency nurse in Brisbane, spends $220 a week living in a share house and another $70 on petrol driving to hospitals and nursing homes for work\nThe surging cost of living means Ms Doncon wasn’t be able to fly down to Melbourne this year to spend time with his parents and two brothers.\n‘I always miss them,’ she told Daily Mail Australia.\nThe overall weekly rent on her inner-city Coorparoo share house she lives in with two others this year rose by 15 per cent to $655 a week.\n‘All of my friends rent and live in share houses,’ she said.\nBrisbane’s rental vacancy rate of 1 per cent is even tighter than Melbourne’s 1.3 per cent level and Sydney’s 1.4 per cent mark, SQM Research data showed.\nThis is occurring after Queensland saw 32,255 new residents move from interstate, on a net basis, during the last financial year as overseas immigration hit a record-high of 518,100.\nWhile she likes her housemates, who are also her friends, Ms Doncon is annoyed she can’t rent on her own with enough space for her family to come and stay with her.\n‘All our family are interstate so we can’t really have people here comfortably,’ she said.\nMs Doncon isn’t optimistic about inflation coming down next year, despite Reserve Bank predictions of easing price pressures.\n‘I’ve kind of seen it get higher every year so I just don’t see it going down,’ she said.\n‘I just try and make it work, I try not to get too stressed about money.’\nInflation in October moderated to 4.9 per cent, down from a 32-year high of 7.8 per cent at the end of 2022.\nBut it’s still significantly higher than the Reserve Bank’s two to three per cent target.\nMs Doncon is a casual worker who is regularly on call to fill nursing shortages, which means she isn’t entitled to annual leave or sick leave.\nAs a 28-year-old casual worker who recently graduated from Queensland University of Technology, her $50,000 salary before tax isn’t much more than the $45,906 full-time minimum wage\nDespite having a small hatchback, her weekly petrol bills typically range from $60 to $70, often having to drive an hour away for work in places like Logan and Ipswich in heavy traffic.\nAs for Christmas Day, Ms Doncon won’t be spending big on presents or a lavish meal, despite already cutting back on food spending throughout the year.\n‘Maybe just a quiet one,’ she said.\n‘I’d love to go to the beach or something but I guess it depends on what the weather’s doing up here.’\nRenters in particular are struggling the most with an InfoChoice survey of 1,000 renters showing 59 per cent of them would be spending less this Christmas because of their rising housing costs.\nThe survey also showed 13 per cent of them could not afford Christmas presents and 2.6 per cent did not have enough for a Christmas tree.\nA majority or 58 per cent of renters had changed their holiday plans, with 21 per cent choosing a cheaper Christmas option, and 37 per cent scrapping their Christmas holiday entirely.\nBrisbane’s rental vacancy rate of 1 per cent is even tighter than Melbourne’s 1.3 per cent level and Sydney’s 1.4 per cent mark (Bondi rent queue, pictured), SQM Research data showed\nInfoChoice money analyst Harrison Astbury said renters in particular were cutting back on Christmas spending just so they could pay their bills.\n‘The connection between rental rises and reduced Christmas spending isn’t a fluke,’ he said.\n‘High rents are literally sucking the money out of household budgets and forcing these cutbacks.\n‘Cutting back on food, gifts and travel at Christmas is the last thing that most people want to do but if there is a choice between putting a roof over your head and celebrating, then shelter comes first.’",

    "text": "By Matt Mathias ,\n3 hours ago\nSporadic whiteout conditions highlighted today’s latest batch of snow.\nThose conditions caused delays for travelers on roads throughout the City of Erie and on highways.\nMeals on Wheels back on the road after harsh winter weather At certain points throughout the day, visibility was poor as heavy winds and lake effect snow contributed to delays.\nWhite-out conditions caused by lake effect snow, heavy wind along with slush and packed snow on Erie roadways caused headaches for drivers throughout the day on Thursday.\nBut how has it compared to what’s being called Snowmaggedon 2024?\n“It’s a different dynamic of snow totally from last week. Last week it was two inches an hour of wet, heavy snow starting at the end of Thanksgiving and beginning of Black Friday. . . With cars everywhere, people everywhere, and it just wouldn’t stop snowing,” said Jeff Gibbens, bureau chief of the City of Erie Streets Department.\nCost to clean up 6 feet of snow costing Harborcreek Twp. more than anticipated Crews started salting late Thursday night early into the morning and switched to plowing on main runs around 3 a.m.\nThis type of snow is light and fluffy, city trucks aren’t getting stuck in this snow and it’s not as heavy on their equipment.\nPennDOT last week brought crews in from across the Commonwealth and while the region got some help again, it wasn’t nearly to the level we saw then.\nCrews from Crawford and Warren Counties were called in through a PennDOT plan called Cover 90.\nClose Thanks for signing up!\nWatch for us in your inbox.\nSubscribe Now\nDaily News “That gives then the Erie County the ability to put more crews on I-90 where we typically see the heaviest snow. Cover 90 is what we call it because it gives us the chance to shorten those plow routes, especially in the areas hit the hardest like towards the east end of I-90 near the New York border where we see the snow coming down at a pretty good rate right now,” said Jill Harry, press officer for PennDOT District 1.\nHarry said this is a common lake effect storm that they’ve prepared for since the summer and said it was almost solely isolated to the lake shore region.\nAnd when it’s isolated, it gives them the flexibility to move crews here as needed.\nFor City of Erie crews, they’re still dealing with problems with people not following odd-even parking.\nSisters of St. Joseph begin due diligence on potential sale on local properties “Even today we’re having problems after all of this time. We’ve had constant contact with police moving cars. As of yesterday, we were still towing cars that haven’t moved. You just need to obey odd-even parking, which we go by the date,” said Gibbens. “If you see them just give them the space they need to open the road so everyone can get home safely.”\nHarry said their website, 511PA has the latest updates on road closures and restrictions that might be placed on the roads.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "text": "Gorakhpur: A man who thought he had cremated his wife last week, was reunited with her after she was found alive about 600 kilometres away in Jhansi. Ram Sumer, a 60-year-old resident of Bansgaon in Gorakhpur, reported his wife Phoolmati missing on June 15. Four days later, on June 19, a woman’s body was discovered in the Uruva Bazaar area. Sumer identified the body as his wife and carried out the last rites.However, the case took a surprising turn when the post-mortem revealed that the woman had been strangled to death. This revelation led the police to probe further into the matter. The police then traced Phoolmati’s mobile phone, which showed activity in Jhansi, around 600 kilometres from Gorakhpur. Call records indicated frequent contact between Phoolmati and a man named Shubham from Sultanpur.Upon questioning, Shubham revealed that Phoolmati was alive and he had taken her to Jhansi. The police then located Phoolmati at the address provided by Shubham.Sumer told the police that Phoolmati had left her parental home on June 15 to return to his house but never arrived. After searching extensively, he reported her missing.Superintendent of Police (South) Jitendra Kumar Tomar said that Phoolmati was sent back to her husband on Saturday after recording her statement. The investigation is ongoing to determine the relationships between Sumer, Phoolmati, Shubham, and the unidentified woman who was cremated. The police have also obtained CCTV footage showing a suspicious individual and are re-investigating the case.(With inputs from PTI)",

    "text": "State Watch Lawmakers are condemning a recent defacement of a Hindu temple in Newark, Calif., that local authorities are looking into as a possible hate crime. Authorities are investigating the vandalizing of the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu Temple with graffiti as a possible hate crime, according to a report from The Mercury News. The defacing of the temple was found Friday morning. “I unequivocally condemn this attack on Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu Temple in California. Hatred in all forms cannot be tolerated,” Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, on Saturday. “Those responsible must be held accountable.” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) joined Lee in condemning the defacing in a post as well. “The defacing of the Swaminarayan temple in Newark, CA is despicable, and I strongly condemn it,” Krishnamoorthi said in his X post. “I’m glad the community is rallying to the support of the mandir. We must stand united against bigotry in all its ugly forms. Those who did this vandalism must be held accountable.” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) also said he condemned the defacing of the temple, which he said is in his district. “Freedom to worship is at the heart of American democracy,” Khanna said in a post on X. “Those who committed this act of vandalism must be held accountable.” “As the founder of the Congressional Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and Jain Caucus, I express my profound condemnation of the disgraceful act of vandalism committed against the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Newark, California,” Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.) https://twitter.com/ShriThanedar/status/1738589439432028398 in a statement posted to X. “This desecration, marked by anti-India graffiti, strikes at the very essence of our diverse and inclusive society.” The Newark Police Department said that the temple’s defacement seems to be targeted, according to The Mercury News. “Any acts or threats of violence, property damage, harassment, intimidation, or other crimes motivated by hate or bias are considered very serious and given very high priority,” the Newark Police Department said in a news release, according to The Mercury News. “Officers are investigating, collecting evidence, and reviewing surveillance footage from nearby businesses in order to establish the chain of events and bring those responsible to justice.” The Hill has reached out to the Newark Police Department.
