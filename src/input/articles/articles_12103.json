    "title": "Chiefs celebrate with Chris Jones as he gets a sack to hit a big contract incentive – KIRO 7 News Seattle",
    "text": "While many of the Kansas City Chiefs key players sat out Sunday's regular-season finale, defensive star Chris Jones was still on the field in the second half.\nHe had good reason.\nJones needed one sack to hit a seven-figure bonus. Jones would get a $1.25 million bonus if he hit 10 sacks this season. He came into the final game at 9.5 on the season.\nIn the third quarter, he got his $1.25 million sack. And the Chiefs were well aware. Jones came through the middle and sacked Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Easton Stick. That started a celebration that wasn't just Jones, but most of his teammates. The whole sideline erupted with the sack.\nThe celebration said plenty about what Jones' teammates think of him.\nCHRIS JONES GETS HIS BONUS! The whole @Chiefs sideline was HYPED for him.\n📺: #KCvsLAC on CBS\n📱: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/X0vcyHUoyR pic.twitter.com/lrapGgskaZ\n— NFL (@NFL) January 7, 2024 A similar scene happened in Baltimore on Saturday, when Ravens edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney got a sack for a big bonus and celebrated it . Remember: Players know what stats they need to hit certain incentives, and often their teammates know too.\nJones was given hugs on the sideline from defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo and coach Andy Reid after the sack. Jones' season started with a contract holdout as he sought a large long-term deal. He eventually reported on a new one-year deal after missing the first game of the season. On Sunday, Jones made plenty of money for himself.",

    "text": "Veteran British actor Sir Michael Caine is reportedly set to come out of retirement to star in a new Netflix series.\nThe Sun reports that the icon, 90, has joined a show filming next month of which the details are being kept closely under wraps.\nIt comes two months after Sir Michael announced that he has decided to retire from acting.\nAn source told the publication: ‘He’s been asked to star in a Netflix series. Details are kept closely guarded.’\nA representative for Michael and Netflix have been contacted by MailOnline for further comment.\nVeteran British actor Sir Michael Caine is reportedly set to come out of retirement to star in a new Netflix series\nThe Sun reports that the icon, 90, has joined a show filming next month of which the details are being kept closely under wraps\nSir Michael confirmed his retirement decision in October, following a stellar career spanning seven decades and days after the release of his latest film, The Great Escaper.\nThe talented star – who has starred in over 180 movies – explained his decision came after he concluded that ‘you don’t have leading men at 90.’\nConfirming the news, the beloved thespian told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘I keep saying I’m going to retire. Well I am now.’\n‘I’ve figured, I’ve had a picture where I’ve played the lead and had incredible reviews… What am I going to do that will beat this?’\nThe Oscar, Golden Globe and Bafta-winning actor has an extensive filmography, including classic films ranging from Zulu and The Italian Job to more recently in Interstellar and The Dark Knight franchise, alongside Christian Bale.\nIn his final movie, The Great Escaper which was released on October 6, he plays real-life World War Two veteran Bernie Jordan who escaped from a care home to attend D-Day celebrations in France.\nSpeaking about his decision to hang up his boots, Sir Michael – who has been using a walking stick for five years after a fall on ice and spinal surgery – said: ‘The only parts I’m liable to get now are 90-year-old men. Or maybe 85.\n‘They’re not going to be the lead. You don’t have leading men at 90, you’re going to have young handsome boys and girls. So I thought, I might as well leave with all this.’\nIt comes two months after Sir Michael announced that he has decided to retire from acting (seen in 2018)\nIn his final movie, The Great Escaper which was released on October 6, he plays real-life World War Two veteran Bernie Jordan who escaped from a care home to attend D-Day celebrations\nSir Michael revealed he had turned down appearing in the The Great Escaper three times before accepting the role, because he considered himself retired.\nHe stars alongside Glenda Jackson, who died in June after the completion of the film.\nSir Michael recently revealed the secret to a long, happy life is to marry a younger woman, stop eating between meals – and wear trainers.\nIn an interview with The Mail on Sunday’s You Magazine, Sir Michael said his advice for longevity is ‘younger wives, no snacking and wearing trainers all the time – and you have to be careful not to fall down’.\nHe married model Shakira, 76, in 1973 after seeing her in a TV advert and tracking her down. She was 26 and he was 40.\nThey have a daughter Natasha and three grandchildren he says also help to keep him youthful, adding: ‘You want to live forever to see what they do with their lives.’\nSir Michael confirmed his retirement decision in October, following a stellar career spanning seven decades (pictured in 1996 film Alfie)",

    "text": "Por Rodrigo Viga Gaier\nRIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Com sua estratégia comercial, a Petrobras (BVMF: PETR4 ) tem conseguido proporcionar estabilidade de preços de combustíveis aos brasileiros em ambiente de volatilidade externa diante do conflito no Oriente Médio, disse nesta quinta-feira a presidente da companhia, Magda Chambriard.\nEm entrevista à Reuters, a executiva afirmou que essa estabilidade é possível com estratégia da Petrobras que passou a incorporar \"suas melhores condições de produção e logística para a definição dos preços seus de venda de gasolina e diesel às distribuidoras\".\nEssa política comercial, na visão de executiva, permite à empresa minimizar a volatilidade de preços, especialmente em momentos de alta do barril do petróleo como os registrados recentemente, com o conflito no Oriente Médio fazendo os preços do petróleo dispararem após um período de queda.\n\"Isso nos permite praticar preços competitivos frente a outras alternativas de suprimento e mitigar a volatilidade do mercado internacional\", afirmou ela.\nOs preços do petróleo Brent , uma das variáveis acompanhadas pela Petrobras para definir a valor das vendas de diesel e gasolina, saltaram 5% nesta quinta-feira, para fechar a 77,62 dólares o barril, diante de preocupações de que o conflito regional crescente no Oriente Médio possa interromper fluxos globais de petróleo.\nA Petrobras mexeu no preço da gasolina pela última vez em julho, ao elevar em cerca de 7% o valor para as distribuidoras, no primeiro ajuste em oito meses. No diesel, a companhia não alterou as cotações às distribuidoras este ano.\nEla lembrou, citando o diretor de Logística Comercialização e Mercados, Claudio Schlosser, que no passado a Petrobras já praticou reajustes diários, passando toda a volatilidade das cotações internacionais e do câmbio para os preços internos.\n\"Hoje, isso não ocorre. Nós consideramos nossas melhores condições de produção nacional de petróleo, parque de refino, terminais, dutos, navios etc, para sermos competitivos com as principais alternativas de suprimento dos nossos clientes e, importante frisar, sem repassar o nervosismo diário das cotações internacionais e do câmbio\", destacou.\nEla ressalvou, contudo, que a Petrobras segue observando \"os eventos recentes e eventuais desdobramentos sobre os fundamentos de mercado\", ao comentar o conflito entre Israel e Irã e sua influência nos preços internacionais.\nMas disse que, \"por questões concorrenciais, não pode antecipar suas decisões\".\n(Por Rodrigo Viga Gaier)",

    "text": "Bengaluru, Dec 28 : Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's statement that Rahul Gandhi is leading the country and will become the Prime Minister after the Lok Sabha elections next year is likely to trigger internal fight in state Congress, sources said on Thursday. Siddaramaiah made the statement on Thursday while addressing the 139th Foundation Day of the party at the Bharat Jodo auditorium in Bengaluru. Sources said the remarks might trigger a rift between AICC President Mallikarjun Kharge and Siddaramaiah. It may be noted that Kharge's name was proposed as the PM face by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee during the INDIA bloc meeting held in the national capital recently. Siddaramaiah had distanced himself from giving his opinion on the proposal to make Kharge the PM face. \"Mamta Banerjee had suggested his (Kharge's) name... It is to be seen whom the INDIA bloc makes its PM face,\" Siddaramaiah had stated. Commenting on the Congress President's name being proposed as the PM face, Karnataka minister Priyank Kharge, the son of Mallikarjun Kharge, questioned why discussions always revolve around community and whether efficiency in Dalits is not considered. He made this statement in response to queries as to if the name of a senior Dalit leader like Kharge had been put up to give an advantage to the INDIA bloc in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections. Priyank Kharge maintained that every time there are discussions about a Chief Ministerial or Prime Ministerial candidate, they tend to focus on communities. \"Won't you see efficiency in these communities that you are mentioning? Will they only get elected in the name of the communities they belong to,\" he asked. Sources said that questions are already being raised over Siddaramaiah not supporting the proposal of Kharge's candidature for the PM post whole-heartedly.",

    "text": "[Dibu Martínez](/temas/dibu-martinez) El ‘Dibu’ Martínez manda a silenciar a los fanáticos que lo silbaban con atajada imposible de un penalti en Francia El portero argentino Emiliano ‘El Dibu’ Martínez tuvo una jornada destacada este jueves 18 de abril en el partido que enfrentó a su club, el Aston Villa de Inglaterra, ante el Lille de Francia por los cuartos de final de la Conference League. Martínez, a lo largo del partido en el que cada vez que tocaba el balón era silbado, ejecutó varias atajadas de primer nivel durante el desarrollo del encuentro que tuvo que decidirse desde los penales debido a que la serie quedó empatada 3 a 3. Fue en ese momento en el que los abucheos en contra del Dibu subieron los decibeles en un estadio que le cobraba su papel en la final del Mundial de Qatar 2022 en donde fue clave para que la selección de Argentina se impusiera a Francia. Los silbidos no hicieron más que aumentar la concentración del argentino quien en la serie atajó dos disparos. Sus paradas le permitieron al Aston Villa ganar la tanda de penales por 4 a 3 para así avanzar a las semifinales del campeonato. El ‘Dibu’ después de la primera atajada hizo un gesto con el que evidentemente mandó a callar a los aficionados del Lille. Luego, en la segunda atajada en lo que era el quinto penal, el argentino se giró y bailó enfrente de la tribuna. De esa manera respondió a un público que no tuvo indulgencia con quien fue el gran villano en la final de su país ante Argentina hace poco más de un año. Aston Villa busca en la Conference League ganar su primer título europeo en más de cuatro décadas. El equipo de Unai Emery ganó el partido de ida por 2 a 1 la semana pasada, pero el Lille igualó la eliminatoria con un resultado idéntico a su favor este jueves. El Aston Villa, que marcha cuarto en la Premier League de Inglaterra, jugará las semifinales del torneo europeo el próximo 2 y 9 de mayo.",
