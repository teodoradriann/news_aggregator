Alicia Conjour. Police rendered aid at the scene, and the boy was taken to the hospital.\nThe boy’s injuries do not appear to be life threatening, Conjour said.\nAnyone who witnessed the shooting or has information about it is asked to contact the Allentown police criminal investigation division at 610-437-7721. Tips can also be left anonymously through the Allentown Police Tip411 app.\nState Rep. Josh Siegel, D-Lehigh, whose district includes the neighborhood where the shooting occurred, reacted to the shooting.\n“I’m disappointed in yet another instance of gun violence in our city and one perpetrated against a young person,” Siegel said in a statement. “I hope for a speedy recovery for the victim and peace for their family.\n“Violence is a choice, a choice made by individuals to deprive neighborhoods of security and stability,” he said. “A selfish act of destruction that injures not just the victim, but the entire community. We must do more to prevent these violent acts, our youth should spend their summers riding bikes, not recovering from gunshot wounds.”\n ",

    "title": "Escaping Aging with Cell Annealing: A Model",
    "text": "In a groundbreaking development that promises to revolutionize our understanding of cellular aging and longevity, researchers have unveiled a novel framework termed “Cell Annealing,” offering a phenomenological model that could pave the way for escaping the traditional constraints of aging. This study, led by Memczak, Izpisua Belmonte, and Graepel, has been published in Cell Research, capturing the imagination of gerontologists and biotechnologists alike. By drawing parallels between principles from materials science and biological systems, the model proposes a method of cellular rejuvenation that could potentially reset or reverse age-associated cellular damage, thus extending both lifespan and healthspan.\nThe essence of Cell Annealing builds on the metaphor of annealing—a process widely used in metallurgy where controlled heating and cooling cycles are applied to metals to refine their internal structure and enhance their physical properties. By applying an analogous conceptual framework to living cells, the researchers hypothesize that intermittent and controlled “thermal-like” or stress-related perturbations can induce cells to reconfigure their damaged biomolecules and subcellular structures, effectively “repairing” accumulated molecular lesions that are central to aging. The model provides a robust phenomenological description of how these annealing cycles could alleviate subcellular entropy and restore functions eroded by chronological and replicative aging.\nA key insight from Memczak and colleagues is their integration of biological complexity with thermodynamic principles. Aging is traditionally viewed as a decline in cellular robustness due to the accumulation of damage in DNA, proteins, lipids, and organelles. Their Cell Annealing model reframes this process as one susceptible not only to inevitable degradation but also to cyclical restoration. Controlled perturbations, similar to thermal inputs in metallurgical annealing, prompt cellular quality control mechanisms such as proteostasis networks, DNA repair pathways, and autophagic clearance to enter heightened states of activity. These cyclical activations allow the cells to “prune” away dysfunctional components, promote molecular chaperoning, and rebalance metabolic flux—all of which contribute to sustained cellular functionality.\n.adsslot_Y0OPJKamy1{ width:728px !important; height:90px !important; }\n@media (max-width:1199px) { .adsslot_Y0OPJKamy1{ width:468px !important; height:60px !important; } }\n@media (max-width:767px) { .adsslot_Y0OPJKamy1{ width:320px !important; height:50px !important; } }\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis phenomenological approach offers several advantages. Unlike genetic manipulations or pharmacological interventions that often target singular pathways, Cell Annealing encompasses a holistic cellular rewriting. The model’s predictive power lies in its ability to reconcile disparate age-related molecular pathways within a unifying physical paradigm. It leverages known cellular stress responses including hormesis—a process where mild stress enhances resilience—to propose a systemic cycling that yields net restorative effects rather than cumulative damage.\nThe experimental evidence supporting this model was gathered by mimicking annealing cycles in cultured human cells using controlled pulses of mild oxidative stress and transient metabolic inhibition. These perturbations were carefully tuned to avoid permanent damage but sufficient to trigger endogenous repair machinery. Over repeated cycles, cells demonstrated improved mitochondrial function, enhanced DNA repair kinetics, and reduced senescence markers. Intriguingly, single-cell transcriptomic analyses showed a temporal resetting of age-associated gene expression profiles toward a more youthful state after the annealing regimen.\nAt a molecular level, this restoration appears to be coordinated by oscillations in key signaling nodes such as AMPK, mTOR, and sirtuins, themselves known central regulators of aging and metabolism. The model also underscores the importance of phase separation dynamics—the process by which cells compartmentalize biochemical reactions in membraneless organelles—in mediating the reorganizational events during annealing. By modulating the material states of these condensates, cells dynamically facilitate the segregation and elimination of damaged components.\nBeyond cultured cells, the authors speculate that Cell Annealing could be promoted in vivo by carefully orchestrated interventions such as intermittent fasting, hypoxic conditioning, or controlled thermal therapies. These approaches have been independently associated with anti-aging effects, but the new model provides a mechanistic rationale tying their benefits to cyclical annealing-like cellular reprogramming. If realized therapeutically, such dynamic treatments would mark a paradigm shift, moving aging interventions away from static maintenance and toward actively induced rejuvenation cycles.\nImportantly, Memczak et al. emphasize that while Cell Annealing departs from purely genetic or pharmacological anti-aging solutions, it remains compatible with them. This suggests a future where combined approaches, layering annealing cycles with precision senolytics, epigenetic modulators, or gene therapies, may synergize to achieve unparalleled gains in healthspan and lifespan extension. It also raises profound questions about the limits of biological plasticity and whether such cyclical restoration can ultimately overcome species-specific aging clocks.\nConfronting the intrinsic heterogeneity within tissues and cell populations remains a challenge for practical deployment. The model accounts for this complexity by proposing that the timing, magnitude, and frequency of annealing cycles must be fine-tuned to each cell type’s bioenergetic and stress response profile. For example, stem cells may require different protocols than differentiated somatic cells to maximize rejuvenative outcomes while minimizing oncogenic risks. Understanding these parameters will require interdisciplinary efforts spanning systems biology, physics, and clinical sciences.\nNotably, the Cell Annealing framework also intersects with emerging fields such as systems gerontology and bioinformatics. Integrating multi-omics data with predictive computational models enables the mapping of aging trajectories at individual and population levels. This marriage of data science and phenomenology enhances the capacity to simulate potential annealing protocols before in vivo testing, accelerating translational timelines.\nScience enthusiasts and the general public alike are captivated by the tantalizing possibility that aging could be turned from a one-way descent into a reversible cycle. However, the authors caution that application in humans necessitates rigorous validation, particularly around safety and long-term effects. While early results are promising, biological systems are enormously complex, and the risk of unintended consequences such as dysregulated cell proliferation or immune dysfunction must be carefully managed.\nThis conceptual breakthrough resonates with broader philosophical shifts in aging research—from perceiving aging as an inexorable decline to recognizing it as an amenable process where cellular plasticity can be harnessed. Cell Annealing offers a fresh lens through which to view longevity, where time itself becomes a malleable parameter controlled through intelligent modulation of cellular states.\nFurthermore, the implications of this model extend into regenerative medicine and chronic disease management. Aging is the principal risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular pathologies, and cancer. By reshaping the cellular milieu toward youthful functional states, annealing may open avenues for disease prevention and improved recovery from injury, potentially transforming the healthcare landscape.\nAs the field moves forward, experimentalists will seek to refine the molecular triggers and mechanical forces that underlie annealing cycles, while clinical researchers will explore minimally invasive methods to induce analogous states in patients. Interdisciplinary collaboration will be essential, merging insights from physics, molecular biology, computational modeling, and clinical expertise to realize the full potential of cell annealing as a longevity modality.\nIn sum, the Cell Annealing model proposed by Memczak and colleagues marks a visionary stride in aging biology, blending theoretical elegance with empirical promise. It challenges long-standing dogmas and offers a roadmap to one day escape the frailty of aging through orchestrated cellular rejuvenation. While challenges persist, the horizon of biomedicine is now illuminated by this innovative concept, inspiring hope that aging may no longer be an immutable fate but a challenge to be met with science and ingenuity.\nSubject of Research: Cellular aging and rejuvenation through the phenomenological model of Cell Annealing.\nArticle Title: Escaping ageing through Cell Annealing—a phenomenological model.\nArticle References:\nMemczak, S., Izpisua Belmonte, J.C. & Graepel, T.

    "text": "La llegada inminente de La Niña plantea preocupaciones para una potencialmente peligrosa temporada de huracanes en el Atlántico El impacto de La Niña se extiende a nivel global, afectando patrones de precipitación y condiciones climáticas extremas. A medida que el planeta se prepara para la transición de El Niño a La Niña, la perspectiva climática sigue siendo incierta, especialmente para las regiones vulnerables a eventos climáticos extremos. La Niña, la fase opuesta del patrón climático recurrente, está próxima, y sus implicaciones son profundas, especialmente para aquellos que residen a lo largo de las costas del Atlántico y del Golfo de los Estados Unidos. Pedro DiNezio, un científico de la atmósfera y el océano en la Universidad de Colorado, arroja luz sobre el cambio inminente y sus posibles ramificaciones. La Niña se manifiesta cuando las temperaturas en el océano Pacífico oriental descienden, preparando el escenario para trastornos atmosféricos con consecuencias de largo alcance. Te puede interesar: [¿Cuándo inicia la temporada de huracanes de este año en México?](https://www.elimparcial.com/mexico/2024/05/08/temporada-de-huracanes-en-mexico-2024/) Este fenómeno climático, caracterizado por patrones de circulación atmosférica intensificados como la Circulación de Walker y alteraciones en la trayectoria de la corriente en chorro, ejerce una influencia significativa en los sistemas climáticos globales. Durante La Niña, emergen condiciones más tormentosas en ciertas regiones mientras que otras lidian con una aridez intensificada, estableciendo el escenario para una interacción compleja de extremos climáticos. La Niña y sus consecuencias climáticas: lo que debes saber De particular preocupación es el impacto de La Niña en la actividad de huracanes en la cuenca del Atlántico. Con la disminución del cizallamiento del viento, los huracanes tienen un entorno propicio para su formación e intensificación, lo que representa amenazas inminentes para las comunidades costeras que ya están sufriendo las consecuencias de temporadas de tormentas anteriores. Además, las repercusiones se extienden más allá del ámbito de los ciclones tropicales. La influencia de La Niña en los patrones de precipitación puede exacerbar las condiciones de sequía en el suroeste de Estados Unidos, lo que potencialmente lleva a escasez de agua y aumenta los riesgos de incendios forestales. En el hemisferio sur, se desarrolla un conjunto contrastante de anomalías climáticas, con regiones como Chile y Argentina enfrentando condiciones de sequía mientras que otras, como el Amazonas y partes de Australia, luchan contra el exceso de lluvias e inundaciones. Complicando estos desafíos está la superposición del calentamiento global, que amplifica la intensidad y la frecuencia de eventos climáticos extremos. Si bien La Niña puede mitigar temporalmente el aumento de las temperaturas, el avance inexorable del cambio climático subraya la necesidad urgente de tomar medidas concertadas para mitigar sus impactos. A medida que el mundo se prepara para el inicio de La Niña y sus efectos cascada, la vigilancia, la preparación y las medidas proactivas son imperativas para proteger a las comunidades vulnerables y mitigar la amenaza inminente de desastres inducidos por el clima.

    "text": "BUXTON, N.C. — The black and white paint of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse can be seen from miles on land and sea but not right now. The structure has been stripped of its paint and is surrounded by scaffolding, all part of an almost $20 million multi-year restoration project that began in September 2023. “We started removing all of the beautiful, beautiful paint on the interior and exterior of the lighthouse so we can start doing some brick and metal assessments on the structure, so that way we know our path forward and how to restore the lighthouse,\" said Lindsey Gravel, project manager with Stone and Lime Historic Restoration Services. Right now, the focus is assessing the brick and metal of the structure inside and out. That includes a mix of repairing and replacing it. Watch: Visitors spy scaffolding during $19 million Cape Hatteras Lighthouse restoration \"There's going to be a lot of new brick going in, we're going to try to preserve as much as we can. The brick seems to be in pretty great condition, so we might not have to replace as much as we expected, but there's still some assessments to do, same thing with the metals. The metals could go both ways. Those have to be repaired in place as well. So as far as the restoration goes, we're repainting about 20% of the tower and on the base as well,\" said Gravel. Once these assessments are completed, the hope is to start getting the paint back on the lighthouse by the spring of 2025. Visitors most likely won't see a whole lot of change before then, as much of the work is atop the lighthouse and inside of it. Another focus at the moment is finalizing the plan for putting 11 new windows in place. Though modernizing the lighthouse is a part of this process, the key is preservation. Watch: Cape Hatteras Lighthouse being restored during massive renovation project “These brand-new windows, they need to meet structural and impact resistance according to the code, but historic windows will never meet the structural requirements of modern day. What we're doing is we're trying to figure out some path forward on how to meet in the middle so they can look as historic as possible, because that's really important in preservation, to give it the ornate and original feel.” Progress is being made on the project, some that can be seen are the new and widened walkways work for a better visitor experience, work on restoring the Oil House and the installation of a replica of the Fresnel Lens that will be installed atop the lighthouse, similar to the original light, with an LED bulb. Watch: Brand new 'shell-ebrities' at seashore excavation in Cape Hatteras The main aspects of this restoration project from the Cape Hatteras National Seashore's press release are below: - Rehabilitate the interior and restore the exterior of the lighthouse. - Repaint the interior and exterior of the lighthouse. - Restore important architectural components, including missing pediments over the lighthouse windows and missing interior doors. - Repair and repoint masonry, remove corrosion and repair metal elements. - Remove the metal weight track from the lighthouse. - Install new railing using a non-corrosive metal on the lantern balcony. - Remove existing rotating light beacon and metal platform from the lantern and replace with a replica of the original first-order Fresnel lens. The replica lens will be the same size and overall appearance as the original, but LED lights will be used inside the lens. - Rehabilitate and repair the Oil House. - Remove the existing vinyl perimeter fence around the lighthouse and replace with a replica of the original (pre-1920) decorative metal octagonal fence with granite bases. - Fabricate and install a replica stockade fence around both the Principal Keeper’s Quarters and Double Keepers’ Quarters (Museum of the Sea) to match the look and feel of the original landscape of the early historic period (1870-1890s). - Create a new walkway from the parking lot to improve pedestrian circulation, wayfinding, interpretation and the visitor experience. - Relocate the Keepers of the Light Amphitheater stones to provide interpretation of the lighthouse keeper’s role.

    "title": "at COP29, scientists fear a decline in the place of science in climate negotiations",
    "text": "While COP29 takes place until Sunday in Azerbaijan, several experts deplore the questioning of their work and a politicization of science.\nPublished on 22/11/2024 12:32\nReading time: 2min\nThere remains until Friday, November 22 to reach an agreement at COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan. The aim is in particular to define a financing objective for aid to developing countries to face the climate crisis. The place of scientific knowledge in negotiations is one of the other central themes of this COP. The nearly 200 states gathered under the aegis of the UN base their discussions on the reports of the IPCC, the group of international experts on climate, which is the reference.\nBut in recent days, certain states have tried to minimize their place in future negotiations. Scientists now openly fear that the place of science will decline at the next COPs.\nIn the negotiation rooms, the observing scientists are taken aback. “I have never seen this kind of attack on science”deplores Pamela Peterson, who heads a network of researchers, including glaciologists. The scientist, who has participated in COPs for more than 20 years, sees countries calling into question scientific consensus in their formulations.\n“There is a politicization of science, almost an attempt to water it down. For me, some are trying to take pure science out of negotiations. But if we cannot agree on the very basis of change climate, so how can we confront it?asks Pamela Peterson.\nHowever, States, which are preparing the next assessment of their climate action for the 2028 COP, are pleading not to take into account the IPCC assessment report, expected the same year. According to these countries, this report will arrive too late. A false excuse according to Marine Pouget, from the climate action network: “Saudi Arabia and the Gulf oil countries have every interest in seeing older climate data, since their emissions will continue to increase. For them, it is more useful to have data that has more recent figures. lower than those which will be published in 2028.”\nTo act, she says, we need to update the data. For example, researchers have confirmed an acceleration in the melting of the ice since the previous IPCC report, in 2022.",
