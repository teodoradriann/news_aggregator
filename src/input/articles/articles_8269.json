    "text": "Rain, coastal flooding and waves as tall as 30 feet were expected along parts of the West Coast today, a day after giant waves pummeled the California shoreline and prompted some evacuation warnings.\nMore than 6 million people in coastal areas of California and Oregon were under high surf warnings overnight as breaking waves posed an “especially heightened threat to life and property,” according to the National Weather Service.\n“Dangerously large” waves about 28 to 33 feet tall, and potentially up to 40 feet tall, were forecast overnight in some coastal spots in the San Francisco Bay Area and for some parts of Central California, where a few communities in Santa Cruz County had received evacuation warnings a day earlier.\nPHOTO GALLERY: Large Pacific swell delivers big surf in California\nA high surf warning for the Bay Area and the Central Coast expired at 3 a.m. local time. But a high surf advisory, indicating a lower level of risk, along with a coastal flood advisory, were scheduled to last for several more hours.\nSeparately, a high surf warning was set to remain in effect through Saturday for more than 4 million people along the coasts of Oregon and California. The Weather Service office in Medford, Oregon, said that it expected infrastructure damage and beach erosion from breaking waves up to 30 feet tall.\nIn Southern California, forecasters predicted waves of up to 25 feet and said that the threat of significant coastal flooding would last into Saturday night. For beaches in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties, northwest of Los Angeles, high surf and coastal flood warnings were in effect through 10 p.m. Saturday. (A coastal flood warning is a notch higher than an advisory and indicates an imminent or likely threat to life and property.)\nThe Weather Service office in Los Angeles told surfers and beachgoers that the risk of drowning was high, and the California state parks system warned outdoor enthusiasts to be careful at the ocean. More than a dozen state parks and beaches in California were fully or partially closed because of bad weather.\nThe large waves were part of a storm system that was approaching the West Coast early today. The Weather Service said in a forecast that moderate rainfall, becoming heavy in some places, was likely for much of California later in the day. A foot or two of snow was also possible in the Sierra Nevada by Saturday night.\nSome coastal areas of California, Oregon and Washington state were also under a gale warning until late today, meaning that wind gusts of 39 to 54 mph were imminent or already occurring.\nThere is evidence that the United States can expect more unusual and severe storms as the planet heats up, potentially striking in new places or at unexpected times of year.\nLast winter brought some of the most ferocious weather that California had seen in decades, including many atmospheric rivers — narrow conveyor belts of water vapor in the sky — that dumped wave after wave of precipitation onto already soaking ground.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in October that it expected conditions to be wetter than average across much of California this winter, partly because of the weather phenomenon El Nino.\n———\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.",

    "text": "In sports-car racing, we haven’t seen all-wheel drive in a long time. That changes with the Toyota GR Corolla TC, the newest race car from Toyota Gazoo Racing North America (TGRNA).\nTGRNA made a “special agreement” with SRO Motorsports Group America, the organization that sanctions the TC America series, company representatives told Motor1 . In TC America, SRO will combine the current TC and TCX classes in 2025, allowing for more flexibility in car design.\nThe GR Corolla TC uses the road car’s stock 1.6-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine and newly available eight-speed automatic transmission . Those pair with the GR Corolla road car’s unique “GR-Four” all-wheel drive system , which uses a clutch pack rather than a center differential to send power to the rear wheels. Matt Anderson, TGRNA’s head of electronics and vehicle systems told us the GR Corolla TC will be homologated with a fixed torque split front-to-rear.\nChris Perkins / Motor1\nToyota While all the drivetrain components for the GR Corolla TC come from the road car—plus the front and rear Torsen limited-slip differentials—their controls are unique. TGRNA uses Bosch engine management and ABS systems to allow for more-precise, racing-oriented traction control and ABS. GR Corolla engineers in Japan also collaborated with TGRNA to get the engine, automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive system to work with the Bosch control units.\nThe suspension for the GR Corolla TC uses the same basic geometry as the road car, but with adjustable JRi dampers, and Alcon brakes. There’s a FIA-spec roll cage, naturally, and a fully stripped interior with an OMP bucket seat, six-point harness, Bosch digital dash, and TGRNA control panel for various vehicle functions. The steering wheel is also the same used on Toyota’s Supra GT4 car.\nChris Perkins / Motor1 The GR Corolla TC sports new aero components as well, including a huge wing sprouting from the hatch. On both road and race cars, the hatch is composite, so TGRNA had to develop new brackets to affix to the rear window to support the wing.\nIn the SRO TC America series next year, the GR Corolla TC will race against a ton of different cars, from front-wheel drive Civic Type Rs to rear-drive BMW M2s. Like so many sports-car series, SRO will use Balance of Performance to even out the playing field between such different machines. Pricing hasn’t been announced yet, but you can expect the GR Corolla TC to cost a chunk more than the $132,000 of TGRNA’s other homebrew race car, the GR86 Cup.\nMore on the GR Corolla\nThe GR Corolla Is No Longer Manual-Only\nHere's Why the GR Corolla's AWD System Is Bizarre Get the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily.
