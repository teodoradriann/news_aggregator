    "text": "A video captured by a witness shows when several people stepped in to pull Scheracon Roberts Brown and her son Aarihimis Brown, 5, from the debris that was on fire. On April 8, officers with the Prince George's County Fire Department responded just before 11 a.m. to the outer loop of I-495 SB near Maryland Route 4 for reports o a crash. Once there, they found [fire showing from an overturned dump truck](/article/traffic/6-people-taken-to-hospital-after-multi-vehicle-crash-on-i-495/65-1c2a42a3-9b7a-4fab-8967-6a709ca0d321). Roberts Brown's younger sister, Elaina Nesbitt, said her nephew was accompanying his mother. \"She didn't have anyone to watch the baby,\" Elaina Nesbitt said. \"So she was like, well we still have to go to work. So she put the baby in the seat thinking it was a regular work day.\" The initial investigation shows that the dump truck was traveling north on I-495 when it blew a tire. The dump truck then traveled into the southbound lanes where it overturned and caught fire. At the same time, an SUV traveling south on I-495 tried to avoid the dump truck and overturned. An adult and child travelling in the SUV were also injured, according to Maryland State Police. Emanuel Nesbitt says his daughter took after him and became a truck driver. \"One of those unfortunate things that happen, but we just still say thank you,\" Emanuel Nesbitt said. \"Thank you for saving her life, Jesus Christ. Thank you all for being here and caring for her.\" The family said both mother and son are alert and communicating through gestures after going through several surgeries. Emanuel Nesbit told reporters that doctors have given them a five to eight month recovery timeframe, but he fears healing the emotional scars will take longer. After spending days sedated, Roberts Brown's mother, says her daughter only wanted to know one thing when she awoke. \"Where is my son? She had gotten him out of the seat and was pushing him out of the truck for him to get out of the flames,\" Brenda Roberts Nesbitt said. [The boy's father](/article/news/community/father-thanks-people-saved-5-year-old-fiery-wreck/65-89032623-c200-4d1d-bc40-564a1d300687), Actwood Brown, says abdominal issues have complicated his son's recovery. \"Seeing his mom in the condition that she was in, and her screaming, he's got a long road as well, physically and mentally,\" Brown said. The family says they have seen the video of the rescue. \"It's a life altering situation, that someone had the courage and the heart to say, I'm going to help them,\" Elaina Nesbitt said. In the video , Bishop John Adonteng Boateng is seen carrying and comforting the 5-year-old boy. The family was able to thank the bishop in person outside of the Johns Hopkins Hospital where Aarihimis is still hospitalized. \"I shouldn't be called a hero in these circumstances,\" Adonteng Boateng said as he carried a gift and card for the boy. \"There were other men and women also. A man named Anthony, a truck driver, and another guy and a lady who is a nurse. And a whole lot of people that came in strong who were ready to die just to save the woman and child.\" Roberts Brown said their family's heartfelt thanks go out to all who stepped in. \"Thank you for everything you've done to assist my family so that they can live,\" she said. The family says the boy has a surgery scheduled for April 19. Do you have a news tip on this story or any other story? We want to hear from you.

There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up.\n“You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water.\n“I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.”\nTwo other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help.\nThey said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident.\nMrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions.\nThe area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.”\nA spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous.\n“Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale.\n“There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm.\n“Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety.\n“The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary.\n“Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.”\nWitnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.",

    "title": "These Polish nuns risked their lives resisting the Nazis - U.S. Catholic",
    "text": "Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends (John 15:13). On Palm Sunday in 1942, a traumatized Jewish child knocked on the convent door of the Sisters of St. Joseph in the small Polish village of Trzesowka. The shabbily dressed girl insisted she was Polish and Roman Catholic and said her parents had just been killed by the Germans. The nuns were familiar with all the local children and suspected she might be one of the Jewish refugees hiding in the forests. Their intuition was correct. They later learned that her mother had died of suicide, and her father was missing. That was the year the Nazis began using gas chambers for the mass murder of Jewish people. The punishment for sheltering a Jewish person was execution—of the rescuer and anyone living with them. In Poland at that time, thousands of nuns and priests, along with professors and politicians, were also targeted for execution and imprisonment. Despite knowing these risks, the sisters didn’t hesitate to bring Rachela into the convent. Courage often shines most brightly in the darkest of times. The Sisters of St. Joseph understood that God sometimes asks us to show strength and bravery in helping to defend the vulnerable. Located in Poland’s most impoverished area, Trzesowka was a world apart from the more progressive and cosmopolitan cities of Warsaw and Krakow. The convent, which was established in 1925, faced the same poverty as the villagers. In the years before World War II, the convent sisters were involved in many charitable activities, such as conducting school, and organizing sewing classes and camps for children. They also cared for the ill in the nearby villages and were consulted on all sorts of practical matters. The sisters’ medical services proved invaluable for the villagers as there were no local doctors or clinics. Most sisters were trained as nurses and gained experience in hospitals before the war. They were also known for their knowledge of herbal medicines, often the only locally available remedy. The villages’ houses were far away from each other in the wilderness, so the sisters were forced to travel long distances to treat the ill. During her five years of caring for the sick in Trzesowka, one sister recalled that none of her patients died, even though she performed some dangerous procedures. One night, she was called to treat a seriously ill boy suspected of having encephalitis. A trip to the doctor was impossible because of the long distance. She used her treatments and available medications, and he was much better within a few days. He was soon helping his parents in the fields. In addition to their charitable endeavors, the sisters supported their convent by farming their own lands, an arduous task because of the barren, sandy soil. This part of Poland had no modern services such as electricity, phones, or running water. Early each day, with a sickle in hand, the sisters made the sign of the cross and walked silently to their fieldwork “while the birds sang.” After three hours of work, they attended Mass. Then, they spent the hottest hours doing housework and service projects for the community. In the late afternoon, they again worked the fields by hand without any machinery. Despite their many duties, the sisters found time to grow colorful flowers in their gardens. Convent life was spartan. Each nun had her own room, or cell, equipped with a bed, a small table, and a wardrobe. A simple chapel for daily prayer was furnished with a large crucifix on the wall, two paintings, a pair of kneelers, and a stoup with holy water by the door. On September 1, 1939, the Germans invaded Poland. The occupying forces terminated most of the sisters’ charitable and community efforts. The German military soon took over a massive forested area a few miles from the convent to build Camp Heidelager. This was the largest SS training camp outside of Germany and included a concentration and extermination camp. During the war, Germany began the process of “Lebensraum” to develop Poland as the breadbasket of the occupied countries. They gradually colonized Poland with Germans and used the Poles as forced and slave labor. Germany’s long-term plans included targeting the Polish people for extinction. When Polish soldiers sought shelter in the area, the sisters cared for their wounded. The nuns shared their medicine, food, and medical supplies, even making bandages from bed linen and their clothes. Desperate Jewish refugees, fleeing the Nazis, also sought help from the sisters. Since the Gestapo frequently raided and searched the convent, several sisters fled and found shelter in an empty cottage in the forested wilderness in October 1941. There, they frequently helped both Jewish refugees and partisan soldiers to hide from the Germans. But after the Germans found and shot two people who were hiding next to the house, the sisters decided to return to Trzesowka. Two days after they left, the Germans burned down the cottage. In 1943, Hitler moved his top-secret V missile research project to nearby Blizna. Because of the convent’s close proximity to the launch areas, the sisters frequently heard the whistles of bullets and bombs. Then, in July 1944, the Germans abandoned Camp Heidelager. The convent then became a makeshift hospital serving many injured and those exhausted by hunger and disease from the war. The sisters walked from house to house to tend to the ill, as no one had a horse for transportation. In 1946, with the convent devastated by the Germans and then plundered by the Russians, the sisters set about reorganizing to start an orphanage. Rachela, the little girl who came to the convent door asking for assistance, was only one of the Jewish refugees who turned to the sisters. Though initially she hid the truth about her Jewish identity, eventually, she trusted the sisters enough to tell them her story. One of the nuns, Sister Roberta, raised and educated Rachela until she went to university in Krakow. Sister Roberta’s and Rachela’s testimonies are among a few first-hand accounts from both a Holocaust rescuer and a survivor. Their stories illustrate the profound impact acts of kindness can have in the midst of unimaginable cruelty. Later, Poland was taken over by the Soviet Union, which confiscated most of the convent’s livestock and farmlands. As time progressed, the farm ran a deficit, and the convent could no longer function as a religious order in Trzesowka. The convent closed on November 27, 1986, and the house is now under private ownership. I often reflect on the moral and ethical dilemma these nuns experienced and wonder what I would have done if I lived during WWII in Poland. Would I have sheltered a Jewish refugee, even knowing my children and grandchildren might be killed if the Germans found out? The Sisters of St. Joseph lovingly risked their lives not only serving the terrorized and impoverished villagers of Trzesowka but also assisting the partisan fighters and the Jews whom the occupying forces were targeting. Today, the sisters do not qualify for Yad Vashem’s “Righteous Among the Nations” designation because of the lack of required testimony. However, we can say about them, in the words of Jesus’ parable: “Well done, good and faithful servant!” Header image: Sister Roberta Sutkowska Convent School 1939 (Elzbeita Wilk, permission granted in writing.)",

    "text": "For the first time ever, the NFL heads to Brazil.\nAnd this historic international event features two of the NFL’s top young quarterbacks, who will square off in São Paulo on Friday night in Week 1 action.\nThat’s right, Jordan Love will lead the Green Bay Packers into Neo Quimica Arena against Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles on Friday night, with the Eagles being a 2.5-point favorite.\nIt’s TGIF, NFL style, as FrontPageBets takes a look at its top player props for the Packers vs. Eagles in Brazil.\nBest NFL Betting Sites For Week 1 Friday Night Player Props READ: Best NFL Betting Sites for Eagles vs. Packers People are also reading… Nebraska volleyball loses to unranked team for first time in over 6 years Sexyy Red delivers disappointingly short, but entertaining Lincoln show Malachi Coleman headed for redshirt season, Nebraska coach Matt Rhule says Nebraska high school football rankings, Sept. 2 One Lincoln winner is holding a $280,000 Nebraska Pick 5 ticket Man killed in UTV accident north of Lincoln Tank's Country bar brings love for Huskers, country music to Lincoln Railyard Man who died after falling out of UTV in Lancaster County identified One injured in shooting in downtown Lincoln late Thursday Recalled school board member called unqualified to serve on state library board 5-stars, flips and key 2026 targets: Nebraska football set for major recruiting weekend Colorado taking throwback approach to Nebraska rivalry; Deion Sanders weighs in on Dylan Raiola That photo of people wearing 'Nebraska Walz's for Trump' shirts? They're distant cousins Nebraska to revive balloon touchdown tradition for Colorado game 'This isn't going to shake our faith': Da'Nelle and Kurt Earl fight cancer battle with love, hope Best Packers vs. Eagles Player Props for Week 1: Jalen Hurts, Jordan Love props & more The Eagles enter the 2024 season still smarting from the way they finished last year. After starting 10-1, Philadelphia lost six of its last seven, including a Wild Card playoff loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Not the way the 2022 NFC champs wanted to go out.\nThe Packers, led by Love in his first season as the starter, beat the Dallas Cowboys in the Wild Card round last year only to fall to the NFC champion San Francisco 49ers in the Divisional round.\nHowever, it was a glimpse of things to come for the young Packers as they are favored just behind the Lions to win the NFC North this year.\nJalen Hurts props: Under 280.5 passing + rushing yards on Friday Night Football (-115 or better) Since bursting onto the scene in 2020, Hurts has led the Eagles with both his arm and his legs, racking up, including playoffs, 72 passing touchdowns and 46 rushing scores.\nThe dual-thread quarterback has been Philly’s go-to in short-yardage and goal-line situations, coining and perfecting the “Tush Push.”\nBut Hurts hurts defenses more in the short field than he does in wide-open spaces.\nHe averaged 262.1 combined yards per game in 2023, including the playoffs; and for his career, Hurts has a 232-yard-per-game passing + rushing average.\nEagles vs. Packers props: Jordan Love Under 253.5 passing yards (-115 or better) Love finished last season ranked seventh in the NFL in passing, racking up 4,159 regular-season passing yards.\nIncluding the playoffs, the Packers quarterback averaged just over 243 passing yards per game.\nHe only threw for 250 or more yards in eight of his 19 games last season, including only two games with 300 or more yards through the air.\nIn Week 1 last year, Love threw for 245 yards in a win over the Chicago Bears. But three of his passes went for touchdowns.\nPackers vs. Eagles anytime TD picks: Saquon Barkley (-105 or better) When healthy, Saquon Barkley is one of the best all-purpose backs in the NFL.\nAnd now that he’s got a new team, heading to the Eagles in the offseason from the NFC East rival New York Giants, Barkley has his health and a new offense to showcase his talents – one of which is finding the end zone.\nIn 76 career NFL games, including playoffs, Barkley has scored 49 times – 37 rushing and 12 receiving. His best season was his rookie year in 2018, when he rushed for 11 and caught four TDs.\nBarkley will take a lot of the rushing load off Hurts and provide the Eagles with another red-zone option, as well as a home run threat.\nLook for Barkley to find paydirt a lot this season, including Friday night in São Paulo.\nBest Packers vs. Eagles player props for Friday Night Football Week 1 Jalen Hurts props: Under 280.5 passing + rushing yards (-115 or better) Jordan Love props: Under 253.5 passing yards (-115 or better) Packers vs. Eagles anytime TD picks in Brazil: Saquon Barkley (-105 or better)",
