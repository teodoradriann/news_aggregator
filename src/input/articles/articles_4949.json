    "text": "The history of Afghanistan over the last few decades is marred by continuous conflict, ranging from the Soviet invasion in 1979, the rise of the Taliban, the US-led intervention post-9/11, and the subsequent civil war. These events have had a devastating impact on the Afghan population, leading to one of the largest refugee crises in modern history. Millions of Afghans have been forced to flee their homes, seeking refuge in neighbouring countries, with Pakistan hosting a significant portion of these displaced people. The ongoing war has not only destroyed the social and economic fabric of Afghanistan but has also forced its people into a life of perpetual displacement and uncertainty. Afghanistan’s geographical proximity to Pakistan made it a natural refuge for those fleeing the violence. Over the years, Pakistan has hosted more than 3 million Afghan refugees, making it one of the largest refugee-host countries in the world. These refugees have lived in camps and urban areas, often facing significant challenges in terms of access to basic services, employment, and education. Despite these hardships, Pakistan has played a critical role in providing shelter to Afghans who had nowhere else to turn. However, the political and social dynamics within Pakistan regarding Afghan refugees have always been complex, influenced by security concerns, economic pressures, and shifting public sentiments. While countries like Pakistan have borne a disproportionate share of the burden, the international community has failed to provide adequate support to Afghan refugees. The situation for Afghan refugees in Pakistan took a significant turn in recent years, especially after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban in August 2021. As the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan, a new wave of refugees sought to escape the country, fearing persecution or reprisals. Pakistan, already dealing with a large refugee population, faced renewed pressure. However, this time, the reception was markedly different. With Pakistan’s own political and economic challenges, the government has become increasingly reluctant to accommodate new refugees, leading to stricter border controls and a growing number of deportations. The deportation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan has become a contentious issue, both domestically and internationally. Pakistan’s government argues that it can no longer bear the economic burden of hosting millions of refugees, particularly at a time of rising inflation, unemployment, and social unrest within the country. Moreover, there is a perception that the continued presence of Afghan refugees poses a security threat, particularly in border regions where militant activities have persisted. These concerns have led to a policy shift towards the forced repatriation of Afghans, despite the ongoing instability in Afghanistan. For many Afghan refugees, deportation to Afghanistan is tantamount to a death sentence. The situation in Afghanistan remains precarious, with ongoing conflict, human rights abuses, and a severe humanitarian crisis. Many deportees face persecution upon their return, either because of their ethnic or political affiliations or simply because they are seen as having abandoned the country during its darkest hours. For these individuals, Pakistan’s decision to deport them is a stark reminder of the precariousness of their existence – a life split between two countries, neither of which offers a haven. The international community has expressed concern over Pakistan’s deportation policies, arguing that they violate international human rights norms, particularly the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits the forced return of refugees to a country where they are likely to face persecution. Despite these concerns, Pakistan has continued with its deportation policies, citing national security and economic challenges as overriding priorities. This has led to a growing humanitarian crisis, with thousands of Afghans stranded in limbo, unable to return to a war-torn country but also unwelcome in the country they once sought refuge. The plight of Afghan refugees highlights the broader challenges of the global refugee crisis. While countries like Pakistan have borne a disproportionate share of the burden, the international community has often failed to provide adequate support, either in terms of financial assistance or in offering resettlement opportunities. This has left millions of refugees in a state of perpetual limbo, facing uncertain futures and the constant threat of deportation. The situation underscores the need for a more equitable and comprehensive approach to addressing the refugee crisis, one that recognizes the shared responsibility of the global community. As the situation in Afghanistan continues to evolve, the future of Afghan refugees remains uncertain. While some have managed to integrate into Pakistani society, many more continue to live in precarious conditions, facing the constant threat of deportation. For these individuals, their lives remain split between two worlds – neither of which offers the security or stability they so desperately need. The story of Afghan refugees is not just a tale of displacement; it is a story of resilience and survival in the face of unimaginable adversity. But it is also a stark reminder of the failure of the international community to protect the most vulnerable among us. The writer is a freelance columnist based in Quetta.",

    "title": "Nearly 10 Million Workers to Receive Significant Wage Increases in 22 States in January 2024",
    "text": "As the new year approaches, Nearly 10 million workers in 22 states can expect a significant increase in their wages.\nThe Economic Policy Institute reported what increasing minimum wages will generate an additional $7 billion in annual wages for these workerswhich will mark a substantial economic change and a step towards solving the struggles related to inflation.\nThe states leading the wage increase movement\nStarting January 1, 2024, States like California,\nNew York and Washington will increase their base salary to at least $16 an hour, placing them at the forefront of the wage increase movement.\nThis increase is especially notable in the context of the federal minimum wage, which has stagnated at $7.25 an hour since 2009, despite a more than 40% increase in inflation. Twelve of the states that enacted these increases have tied their base pay to inflation, ensuring an annual adjustment that helps preserve workers’ purchasing power.\nWage increases will disproportionately benefit\nwomen and people of color. Around 60% of those who will benefit from the mandatory salary increase are womenwhile Hispanic and African American workers will also see significant impacts.\nThis change reflects not only economic adjustment, but a move towards greater equality and support for those who are often most vulnerable to exploitation. Beyond the immediate financial improvement, these changes are a victory for advocates pushing for fair and living wages for all workers.\nStates that will increase their minimum wage on January 1, 2024 and their new salary\n- Alaska: $11.73\n- Arizona: $14.35\n- California: $16\n- Colorado: $14.42\n- Connecticut: $15.69\n- Delaware: $13.25\n- Hawaii: $14\n- Illinois: $14\n- Maine: $14.15\n- Maryland: $15\n- Michigan: $10.33\n- Minnesota: $10.85\n- Measures: $12.30\n- Mountain: $10.30\n- Nevada: $12\n- New Jersey: $15.13\n- New York: $16\n- Ohio: $10.45\n- Rhode Island: $14\n- Dakota del Sur: $11.20\n- Vermont: $13.67\n- Washington: $16.28\nBroader implications and future increases\nWhile many employers have already increased their starting wages due to a tight labor market, these state-mandated increases are crucial as they ensure sustained wage gains for workers.\nStarting January 1, workers in six states will enjoy a base wage that is more than double the federal minimum wage. However, the fight for fair wages is not over: 20 states, mostly in the South and Midwest, still adhere to the federal limit of $7.25.\nLooking ahead, states like Florida, Nevada and Oregon will also raise their minimum wages later in 2024, continuing the trend of state-led efforts to financially support workers.\nThe start of 2024 marks a significant moment for workers’ rights and economic policy, as all 22 states implement minimum wage increases.\nThis measure, which is expected to benefit nearly 10 million workers and inject billions into the\neconomy, is a response to the current fight against inflation and the stagnation of the federal minimum wage.\nAs states take the lead in ensuring a fair wage for their workers, the nation watches and waits to see the broader impact of these increases, both economically and socially.\nWhile there is still a long way to go, these increases are a step in the right direction and promise a slightly brighter and more equitable new year for millions of Americans.\nKeep reading:\n· Changes in the minimum wage in\nNew York within 11 days: the agreed values for 2024\n· New minimum wage for New Yorkers starting January 1: What should workers know?\n· Laws will defend privacy in social networks of workers and inclusive hairdressing in\nNew York from 2024\n2023-12-28 22:39:22\n#York #leads #minimum #wage #increase #states #starting #January #Diario",

    "text": "毕业临近，武汉设计工程学院食品与生物科技学院再次传来喜讯，该院食品质量与安全专业邵妍、张腾、万荣誉三名毕业生，成功考取硕士研究生。而他们，均是2020年从该校食品营养与卫生专科入学，2023年通过“专升本”考试后，升入食品质量与安全本科专业，最终实现了考取硕士研究生的精彩跨越。\n毕业前，邵妍、张腾、万荣誉相约在学校荷花池合影。苏黄可昕 摄\n这一次，提升的不仅仅是学历\n“学历与目标岗位存在差距”“个人发展受制约”——谈到继续求学的思考，邵妍、张腾、万荣誉三人不约而同聊到了专科实习期间，深切体会到学历在就业求职中有诸多限制。邵妍内心不甘，认定“专科不能是自己学业的终点”；张腾怀揣梦想，期望“通过更系统学习，为未来职业转型筑牢根基”；万荣誉更是满心期待，渴望“提升学历，赢得更多就业良机”。于是，备考“专升本”，继续在学院深造的念头，如同一颗种子，在他们心底悄然种下。\n张腾（右一）、万荣誉（右二）在湖北省产品质量监督检验研究院与实习指导老师合影。\n与一心投入备考、目标笃定的邵妍、张腾不同，万荣誉内心十分纠结，她既渴望“在学习上往上再冲一冲”，又不想因为备考失去工作机会，增加家庭经济负担。班主任凌洁玉老师敏锐地察觉到她的犹豫不决，主动找她谈心，为她分析利弊。最终，在班主任的肯定和鼓励下，她毅然决定一边工作一边备考“专升本”。自此，“背专业课、记单词、刷练习题 ”成了她下班后的生活常态，每一分每一秒都被她紧紧攥在手中。\n班主任凌洁玉（左一）带领万荣誉（右一）参加第八届全国大学生生命科学竞赛并获奖。\n“我被录取了！”2023年5月底，万荣誉查询到“专升本”录取结果时激动不已，迫不及待地将这个喜讯分享给了凌洁玉老师。\n“研”途鏖战，历经风雨终绽光芒\n进入本科学习阶段，邵妍、张腾、万荣誉成为了同班同学，他们都未因眼前的成绩而停下脚步，而是毅然决然地向着更高的目标——考研，发起挑战。\n“从专科一路走来，我始终跟随凌洁玉老师投身课题研究，并在各类创新创业大赛中屡获佳绩。”谈及过往，万荣誉眼中闪烁着光芒，这些成绩带来的成就感，点燃了她对专业领域深入探索的热情。即便在研究生备考的关键时刻，哪怕面临更换报考学校、专业课程需从头再来的困境，她“焦虑得夜不能寐”，也从未有过丝毫动摇。\n万荣誉（中）与指导老师凌洁玉（右一）在学校第五届创新创业大赛上双双获奖。\n万荣誉（左三）荣获学校第六届创新创业大赛二等奖。\n邵妍的考研征途同样布满荆棘。“起初，面对英语阅读理解真题，我常常五道题错四道，书上满是醒目的红色标记。”她回忆道，那时她发现自己的英语语法体系几乎“崩塌”，那段时间无疑是备考路上的“至暗时刻”。然而，乐观好强的她以“错题是成长的勋章”自我激励，坚持每日限时完成四篇阅读理解，并对错题和语法进行细致梳理，次日晨读时再反复诵读复习。\n邵妍在学校图书馆备考研究生考试。\n“考研，是一场与自我的较量。它带给我的，远不止一纸录取通知书，更是直面压力的勇气和持续学习的能力。”张腾在冲刺复习阶段，曾因压力过大导致学习效率骤降，甚至陷入自我怀疑的深渊。但他咬紧牙关，坚持了下来，感慨道：“人生没有白走的路，每一步都算数。”\n临近毕业，张腾在校园里“打卡”留念。\n学院“加持”，为研考保驾护航\n报考院校的精准抉择、专业课的悉心复习指导、备考经验的深度交流、复试调剂的贴心辅导……从研究生报考的那一刻起，直至专业课学习的每一个环节，从初试的紧张备战到复试的激烈角逐，邵妍、张腾、万荣誉三人所迈出的每一步，都离不开学院强有力的“加持”与助力。当他们分别收到硕士研究生录取通知书时，心中满是对学院给予的帮助以及老师们的谆谆教导的感激之情。\n食品与生物科技学院副院长付晓燕开展分析考研形势讲座。\n食品与生物科技学院举办生涯规划讲座，教授学生面试技巧。\n食品与生物科技学院生物工程系李婵娟教授为考研学生讲解生物化学。\n食品与生物科技学院食品质量与安全系罗帷副教授为考研学生讲解微生物学专题。\n考研前夕，食品与生物科技学院开展“研途有暖，歇起新程”活动，为备考学生送上温暖与关怀。\n“我的选择没有错！”邵妍看着研究生录取通知书激动地说，当初报考“专升本”选择继续“留”在学院，是源于对食品质量与安全专业优势的自信，还有各位老师在学习、生活中无微不至的关怀。\n张腾特别感激学院的栽培以及老师们对他研究生备考的细致指导，他说：“亦师亦友的教师团队、良好的学习氛围、大量的专业实践……为我的成长与成功提供了重要助力。”\n“在校这五年，深受学院领导和老师们的重视与肯定，他们给了我很多帮助与支持。”马上要毕业了，万荣誉说她想要感谢的人很多，尤其是班主任凌洁玉老师，她一直以来的关心照顾、引导鞭策，给了自己一路勇往直前的底气与信心。\n“过去三年，学院的考研录取率均保持在20%以上。今年，我们已经收到了21位同学传来的喜讯，其中原学历是专科的就有4位！”食品与生物科技学院副院长付晓燕介绍道，学院始终将强化学风建设、提升教育教学质量作为人才培养的重中之重，精心打造了“基础认知——综合应用——创新探索”这一循序渐进的教学体系，构建了涵盖学生从专科到本科的综合素养培育梯队，全方位、全过程助力学生专业成长，“不遗余力、全方位地支持学生追逐‘升学梦’”。 （通讯员：陈维）\n 责任编辑：黄薇 点击查看全文(剩余 0 %)",
