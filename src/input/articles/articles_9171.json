    "text": "Sunshine and blue skies again for today MOBILE, Ala. ( [WALA](https://www.fox10tv.com/)) - A frosty start on Saturday will give way to mainly sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-50s during the afternoon. This fair weather pattern will continue into New Year’s Eve, with a small chance of rain coming on Monday. Looking ahead, an active but fast-moving weather pattern will bring a few days of rain interspersed with sunny days. The current forecast indicates that Wednesday and Saturday are likely to be rainy, but we will have a better idea of the timing in the near future. TODAY: Expect another beautiful day with mainly sunny skies and cool temperatures. Afternoon temperatures will reach the mid-50s, making it feel pleasant in the sunshine. If you have plans this evening, be prepared with jackets as temperatures will quickly drop into the 40s after sunset. NEW YEAR’S EVE: Sunday afternoon and evening will bring a few clouds, but no rain is expected. Afternoon temperatures will be slightly higher, reaching the low 60s. By midnight, temperatures will drop into the 40s, so make sure to have your jackets ready to celebrate the arrival of 2024! THE WEEK AHEAD: On the first day of 2024, a few showers are expected in the afternoon and evening. Rain chances for this event are relatively low, with one of the major forecast models indicating minimal rainfall in the area. However, an active weather pattern is setting up in the southern U.S., which will provide us with a few more chances for rain in the coming days. The first significant chance of rain this year will likely occur on Wednesday, as a low-pressure system develops over the area, potentially bringing a decent amount of rainfall. Another opportunity for rain will come next Saturday with another low-pressure system. In between these rain events, temperatures will remain cool in the 50s, and skies will be partly to mostly sunny. Copyright 2023 WALA. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Israel strikes Gaza schools, saying Hamas uses them to plan attacks - The Washington Post",
    "text": "More than a dozen people were killed in Israeli strikes on two schools housing displaced people in Gaza City on Thursday, Palestinian officials said, the latest in a series of attacks on education centers Israel says are being used by Hamas to plan its operations. The Israeli military said in a statement that “the school compounds were used by Hamas terrorists and commanders as command and control centers” from which they planned and carried out attacks. Many Palestinians displaced by the fighting, or whose homes have been destroyed in the war, have sought shelter in schools across the Gaza Strip , crowding into disused classrooms to pool resources and in the hope that the facilities might provide some protection. But in recent weeks, strikes on schools have become much more frequent, with Israel targeting seven schools in the eight days prior to the attacks Thursday, according to the U.N. Human Rights Office. In a report this week, the United Nations said it was “horrified ” by the escalation, which has seen at least 163 Palestinians — including children and women — killed in strikes on at least 17 schools over the past month. Rights groups say there is evidence Israel is not doing enough to distinguish civilians from combatants in Gaza, where the months-long war has killed at least 39,699 people, according to local health officials. The Gaza Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its toll, but says the majority of the dead are women and children. The Israel Defense Forces said that it took “numerous steps” to mitigate harm to civilians in the strikes on the two schools Thursday, “including the use of precise munitions, surveillance, and additional intelligence.” But none of that was enough to safeguard the family of Mazen al-Fayoumi, 49, a father of 13 who had returned to the Abdul Fattah Hamoud school in Gaza City’s al-Daraj neighborhood after his rounds distributing water in the city. He lay down for a nap in the classroom where his family has been sheltering since December, when their house was destroyed. “Suddenly, there was dust,” he said. “We did not know what had happened.” He found his 17-year-old daughter dead at the door, he said, then discovered his son-in-law and niece in the schoolyard — also dead. The strike had targeted a classroom opposite to where his family was staying, according to Fayoumi, who said the room was rumored to have been used by Hamas police and “detectives.” “We do not know who was inside it and we do not know if this is true,” he said. Hamas, which controlled Gaza for 17 years, condemned the strikes as the latest in a string of “brutal massacres against citizens in displacement and shelter centers.” It did not address allegations that its fighters had used the buildings to coordinate attacks. Israel has said that Hamas is regrouping in parts of northern Gaza and has sent troops back multiple times to areas the military previously said were cleared. Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees, said the organization has tracked an increase in strikes on its schools in Gaza in recent weeks. “It’s a pattern,” she said, adding that 70 percent of the agency’s schools have been hit since the beginning of the war. The vast majority were sheltering displaced Palestinians, she said, adding that as U.N. facilities, they should be protected at all times. But the Israeli military, she said, has started to immediately issue statements that say the buildings are being used by Hamas. “These are very serious claims,” she said. “We have no way to confirm or deny these claims, nor do we have the ability to investigate. What we do know is that every time these schools or buildings are hit, we’ve had civilians hit, women and children.” Youssif Saudi, 22, a freelance videographer, was in the nearby al-Ahli Hospital on Thursday when the missiles hit. He rushed first to al-Zahra school, arriving ahead of the ambulances, and found people scrambling to pull survivors from the rubble. He said he saw at least 10 bodies, including those of women and children. Two missiles struck classrooms on the northern side of the building, he said, where around a thousand people were sheltering. “The scene was very difficult,” he said. At the Abdul Fattah Hamoud school, Saudi watched as a man collected body parts. “Here, do you see what this is,” the man said in his footage from the aftermath, holding up mangled flesh. “These are remains,” the man said. “Look, these are human remains!” As Israel continues to fight, it has ordered civilians to evacuate to increasingly smaller strips of land and caused overcrowding at schools, Touma said. “People are everywhere,” she said of the schools, adding that sometimes hundreds are forced to share a single bathroom. On Thursday, the IDF announced new evacuation orders for parts of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. “Hamas and terrorist organizations continue to fire rockets from your areas towards the State of Israel,” IDF spokesman Avichay Adraee posted on X . “The IDF will act forcefully against these elements.” Saed al-Aqqad, 32, a resident of Khan Younis whose house is located in the new evacuation zone, said he wouldn’t be moving after being displaced seven times and finally returning home. “Displacement means that you search for the basic requirements of life, such as water, gas and phone charging, and you do not find it,” he said. “You search for clean food and you do not find what can satisfy your hunger. You search for a safe place and do not feel it.” The fear of death is real, he said. “But we prefer to die in our homes.” Morris reported from Berlin, Balousha from Cairo and Harb from London. Israel-Gaza war The Israel-Gaza war has gone on for months , and tensions have spilled into the surrounding Middle East region .

    "text": "Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Monday informed mediators Qatar and Egypt that his Palestinian militant group had accepted their proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza after nearly seven months of war.\nHaniyeh had spoken on the phone with Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and with Egyptian Intelligence Minister Abbas Kamel, “and informed them of Hamas’s approval of their proposal regarding a ceasefire agreement”, the group said in a statement published on its official website.\nA senior Hamas official however stressed that “this does not mean that the ceasefire has come into effect yet”, pointing out that “the Israeli side has not yet communicated its position”.\n“The ball is now in the court of the Israeli occupation, whether it will agree to the ceasefire agreement or obstruct it,” another senior official told AFP on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorised to speak publicly about the negotiations.\nNigerians ask Interior Ministry to ensure faster processing of passports No plan to establish foreign military base in Nigeria – FG The Hamas announcement came after Israel on Monday called on Palestinians to leave eastern Rafah ahead of a ground invasion of the southern Gaza city, amid increasing global alarm about the consequences of such a move.\nIn Rafah, where civilians had voiced fear and confusion over the evacuation order, crowds cheered and fired in the air in the streets following Hamas’s announcement, an AFP correspondent reported.\nPeople were crying tears of happiness, chanting “Allahu Akbar” (God is Greatest) and shooting in the air in celebration of the news, the correspondent said.\nDespite months of shuttle diplomacy, mediators have failed to broker a new truce like the week-long ceasefire that saw 105 hostages released last November, the Israelis among them in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel.\nPrevious negotiation efforts had stalled in part because of Hamas’s demand for a lasting ceasefire and Netanyahu’s vows to crush its remaining fighters in Rafah.\nGaza’s bloodiest-ever war began following Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\nIsrael estimates that 128 of the hostages abducted by militants on October 7 remain in Gaza, including 35 who the military says are dead.\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has conducted a retaliatory offensive that has killed at least 34,735 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry.",

Despite respect from devotees, they allege discrimination from existing temple Sivacharyas.\nDevdiscourse News Desk| Tiruchirappalli | Updated: 18-02-2025 11:39 IST | Created: 18-02-2025 11:39 IST\n- Country:\n- India\nIn Tiruchirappalli, two priests have raised allegations of being denied entry into the sanctum sanctorum of their temple's presiding deity since their appointment in 2021. They have expressed their grievances to authorities, seeking intervention to ensure their access before the Kumbabishekam ceremony scheduled for February 19, 2025.\nThe priests, Prabhu and Jayapal, part of a group appointed by the government to incorporate aspirants from all Hindu castes into state-run temples, claim they have only been permitted to conduct rituals outside the sanctum, in the shrines of Lord Ganesa and Navagrahas.\nDespite acknowledgment from temple devotees, the priests argue that temple Sivacharyas are hindering their access. They have not yet received comments from the Sivacharyas, highlighting a need for resolution ahead of the landmark consecration event.\n(With inputs from agencies.)",

    "text": "[HOME](/)> [Poder](/poder) Bolsonaro aprofunda guerra contra Pablo Marçal e relembra vídeo com críticas do ex-coach Pablo Marçal tenta colar em Bolsonaro para conquistar o eleitorado bolsonarista de São Paulo ✅ Receba as notícias do Brasil 247 e da TV 247 no [canal do Brasil 247](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va5CrrPD38COKOxDbM1M) e na [comunidade 247](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LnWE97DQIKF4fpwivt0f3h) no WhatsApp. 47 - O ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro (PL) aumentou a ofensiva contra o ex-coach Pablo Marçal (PRTB), candidato à Prefeitura de São Paulo, ao divulgar um vídeo com críticas ao adversário nesta quinta-feira (22). A ação ocorre em meio ao crescimento de Marçal nas pesquisas, o que tem causado preocupação na campanha de Ricardo Nunes (MDB), atual prefeito da capital paulista e apoiado por Bolsonaro. O vídeo, compartilhado no canal oficial de Bolsonaro no WhatsApp, que reúne cerca de 1,2 milhão de seguidores, exibe momentos em que Marçal tece duras críticas tanto a Bolsonaro quanto ao presidente Lula (PT), destaca o jornal [O Estado de S. Paulo](https://www.estadao.com.br/politica/bolsonaro-lanca-ofensiva-contra-pablo-marcal-e-divulga-video-lembrando-criticas-do-ex-coach/?utm_source=twitter:newsfeed&utm_medium=social-organic&utm_campaign=redes-sociais:082024:e&utm_content=:::&utm_term=). Em várias declarações, o ex-coach classifica os dois como \"populistas\" e \"farinha do mesmo saco\", afirmando que ambos representam a mesma coisa, com a diferença de que “um deles não tem um dedo”. Além disso, Marçal critica a ideia de que um “messias” possa ser responsável por toda a nação, em uma clara referência a Bolsonaro. Embora tenha declarado apoio à reeleição de Ricardo Nunes, Bolsonaro já fez observações ambíguas sobre o prefeito, indicando que ele “não é o candidato dos sonhos”. Ao mesmo tempo, Bolsonaro chegou a elogiar Marçal, descrevendo-o como uma pessoa “inteligente e com virtudes”, antes de mudar de postura e acusá-lo de mentir sobre nunca ter pedido votos a ele. Mais cedo, [Bolsonaro deu uma \"patada\" em Marçal](https://www.brasil247.com/regionais/sudeste/bolsonaro-da-patada-em-pablo-marcal-no-instagram-e-eduardo-o-compara-a-mourao). Em uma postagem em que o ex-presidente falava sobre uma suposta \"revolução ferroviária\" que teria sido implementada no Brasil durante seu governo, Pablo Marçal comentou: \"Pra (sic) cima capitão. Como você disse: eles vão sentir saudades de nós\". Bolsonaro, então, respondeu com ironia: \"Nós? Um abraço\". Marçal não gostou da mensagem de Bolsonaro e retrucou, irritado: \"Isso mesmo, presidente. Coloquei 100 mil na sua campanha, te ajudei com os influenciadores, te ajudei no digital, fiz você gravar mais de 800 vídeos. Por te ajudar, entrei para a lista de investigados da PF. Se não existe o nós, seja mais claro\".
