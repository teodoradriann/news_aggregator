    "text": "Motley Fool Why Iovance Biotherapeutics Stock Popped Today Read full article Steve Symington, The Motley Fool December 29, 2023 at 12:59 AM · 2 min read\nShares of Iovance Biotherapeutics (NASDAQ: IOVA) popped 18.7% on Thursday as investors assessed the fallout of a clinical hold placed on a cancer-therapy trial yesterday by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nA setback for a much-needed treatment Today's rebound nearly recouped an almost 20% drop yesterday for Iovance, which came on the heels of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision to place a clinical hold on its IOV-LUN-202 clinical trial following a patient's death. The trial was evaluating Iovance's LN-145 TIL experimental therapy to treat non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nIovance issued a press release explaining that the death was \"potentially related to the non-myeloablative lymphodepletion pre-conditioning regimen\" of the trial. At the same time, Iovance pointed out the dire need for therapies in cases such as these, noting that the patients in the trial \"have a poor prognosis, limited treatment options, and a real-world overall survival of less than six months.\"\nWhat's next for Iovance investors? In any case, Iovance has paused enrollment in the treatment regimen for new patients during the clinical hold, and it will continue to monitor and follow patients previously treated according to the trial protocol. The company says patients who have already undergone tumor resection will continue to receive the LN-145 TIL treatment regimen \"with additional precautions and risk mitigations.\"\nOf note from an investor's standpoint (and potentially contributing to today's rebound): LN-145 TIL isn't Iovance's lead drug candidate. Rather, more important to the company's near-term survival is its lifileucel advanced melanoma treatment, which could generate peak annual sales of as much as $900 million and for which the company expects to receive an FDA-approval decision by Feb. 24, 2024.\nThe potential approval of lifileucel is unrelated to LN-145 TIL's clinical trial. That's a potentially massive revenue stream for a company whose entire market cap sits at just $2.2 billion today. And opportunistic shareholders appear to be taking advantage of yesterday's drop to invest accordingly.\nStory continues Should you invest $1,000 in Iovance Biotherapeutics right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Iovance Biotherapeutics, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Iovance Biotherapeutics wasn't one of them.

    "title": "Arsenal lose to West Ham and miss chance to return to Premier League summit | The Independent",
    "text": "Arsenal missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League as they slipped to a disappointing defeat to West Ham amid more VAR controversy.The Gunners needed victory to replace Liverpool at the summit but lost 2-0 on a night where Hammers boss David Moyes finally landed a victory at the Emirates Stadium.West Ham lost Kurt Zouma ahead of the game and Lucas Paqueta after just over half an hour but hit the front through Tomas Soucek’s strike, awarded after VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build-up.A second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos secured the points and things could have been even better for the visitors had Said Benrahma not seen a last-gasp penalty saved by David Raya.Moyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United, so this was a long time coming for the Scot.Arsenal laboured when they needed to continue their recent winning run in London derbies to go back to the top of the table.Instead, only captain Martin Odegaard could hold his head high on a night where their defence creaked and Gabriel Jesus was guilty of missing a couple of very good chances.Arsenal started well, with some great touches in and around the West Ham box from Odegaard in particular.But at the other end their defending left a lot to be desired, as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Magalhaes failed to deal with a simple ball into the middle.Jarrod Bowen capitalised by latching onto the miscue and teed up Soucek to finish – the goal surviving a lengthy VAR check which could not ultimately make a call on if the ball had not gone out of play before Bowen’s cutback.Arsenal looked to respond although the goal gave West Ham something to defend, although Jesus found a way in behind with a subtle flick into Bukayo Saka, whose header was brilliantly saved by Alphonse Areola.Paqueta had been hurt in the warm-up and lasted just over half an hour, with his fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli curling an effort just wide for Arsenal as they continued in vain to find a leveller.The hosts were getting closer, West Ham gifting possession as two passes saw Arsenal in on goal once more, this time Saka hitting the base of the post from an acute angle.Former West Ham captain Declan Rice fired just over from 25 yards but it was another player coming back to haunt his former club who would find the back of the net soon after.Mavropanos made just seven league starts in three years as an Arsenal player but returned to the Premier League last summer with the Hammers and headed them two goals ahead before the hour.Jesus then headed straight at Areola before sending another fine chance well over the bar moments after Arteta introduced Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson off the bench.Areola was on hand again to keep out a Leandro Trossard effort, with Vladimir Coufal clearing a William Saliba header off the line from the resulting corner.Rice had come off the bench during a 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat on his return to West Ham earlier in the season and endured another night to forget here as he conceded a late penalty for tripping Emerson Palmieri in the box – only for Raya to keep out substitute Benrahma’s tame spot-kick.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

    "text": "（加利福尼亚31日讯）消息透露，Alphabet旗下谷歌（Google）计划斥资60亿美元（约254亿1000万令吉）在印度南部安德拉邦（Andhra Pradesh）开发1吉瓦（GW）规模的数据中心和电力基础设施，料将成为亚洲最大规模的数据中心。\n根据外媒报导，知情人士透露，该数据中心将建于安德拉邦港口城市维沙哈巴南，当中包括20亿美元（约84亿7000万令吉）的再生能源投资，旨在支撑设施所需电力。不过，Alphabet尚未对此投资计划作出回应。\n这笔投资是谷歌在亚太地区多国，包括新加坡、马来西亚与泰国推动数据中心扩张计划的一部分。\nAlphabet曾在4月透露，尽管美国总统特朗普的关税对全球经济带来不确定性，但公司仍计划在今年投入约750亿美元（约3176亿2500万令吉）资金，以扩建数据中心规模。\n不过，安德拉邦的资讯技术部长纳拉洛克什未对谷歌投资作出评论。他在新加坡与当地政府与商界人士会面时曾指出，已有如Sify科技公司计划建设的550兆瓦（MW）数据中心等已公开的专案，还暗示10月将公布更多投资。\n安德拉邦为印度第8大的邦，自2014年分拆失去首府海德拉巴及主要税收来源后，一直寻求大型投资以缓解高负债与社会支出的财政压力。\n纳拉洛克什指出，目前该邦已敲定总计1.6吉瓦的数据中心投资，预计未来5年内将把总容量提升至6吉瓦，远高于目前全印度仅有的1.4吉瓦运行中数据中心规模。\nVIP会员专区！",

    "title": "USPS is considering shifting Cheyenne’s mail processes to Denver. Some Wyoming officials think it’s a bad idea.",
    "text": "CHEYENNE, Wyo. — Several Wyoming government officials, including the governor, are concerned about the future state of Cheyenne’s postal service following a recent public forum.\nGov. Mark Gordon, Sen. Cynthia Lummis and Secretary of State Chuck Gray have recently spoken out against the United States Postal Service’s proposed plan to move some of its mail processing operations from the Cheyenne Processing and Distribution Center to Denver’s P&DC. The officials cite election integrity, mail delays and the closure of Casper’s mailing facility as reasons why they oppose any changes.\nOn Dec. 12, a representative with the Western USPS Mail Processing Division provided a presentation at Laramie County Community College. According to a\nNov. 21 news release from the postal service, the purpose of the event was so USPS could provide the public with results from its Mail Processing Facility Review. Key points of the review include:\n- USPS support keeping the Cheyenne facility open and modernizing the facility as a local processing center.\n- USPS supports transferring some mail processing operations to the Denver P&DC.\nAside from the LCCC presentation, USPS recently gathered written comments from the public via an online survey, which closed on Wednesday.\nOver the past few weeks, though, Wyoming’s elected officials have made their opinions on the mailing process known. The Secretary of State said in a letter dated Dec. 27 that he opposed the mail agency’s proposed changes. Specifically, Gray states in a letter to USPS Postmaster General Louis DeJoy that he believes the changes would compromise Wyoming’s electoral process.\n“Since the Postal Service announced its proposal, our office has been contacted by numerous Wyomingites, concerned that processing Wyoming election mail in Denver would delay delivery of mail-in ballots and impede the integrity of Wyoming elections,” Gray states in the letter. “I have these same concerns.”\nIn her written statement to the postmaster general on Dec. 15, Sen. Lummis expressed her disapproval of the mail processing changes but for differing reasons. She states that moving some of Cheyenne’s mail processes to Denver would result in mailing delays.\n“Following the closure of the Rock Springs sorting facility, I have experienced firsthand unnecessary delays and interruptions in mail service that resulted from forcing Wyoming mail to be processed in another state,” Lummis states in her letter. She also claims that the proposal would lead to the loss of at least seven “craft” jobs at Cheyenne’s facility.\nFinally, Gov. Mark Gordon has weighed in on the subject. In a Dec. 22 letter to the postmaster general, Gordon states he is concerned about mailing delays that could compound for Wyoming residents. The governor states that Wyoming’s only other P&DC, located in Casper, is closing in 2025.\n“Wyoming’s rural residents and small businesses depend greatly upon the U.S. Postal Service,” Gordon states in the letter. “Small businesses in our rural communities cannot afford delays to stay competitive in a global market.”\nUSPS regional spokesperson James Boxrud told Cap City News that the study presented at LCCC is not indicative of any of the agency’s final plans.\n“I can reaffirm that we are not closing our mail processing plant,” Boxrud said via email. “However, we are studying the possibility of moving a portion of our mail processing operations — specifically the outgoing mail.”\nBoxrud states that there won’t be any impact to local mail delivery and that post office hours won’t be affected as a result of potential mail processing changes. He added that jobs won’t be affected, though some bids may change.",

    "text": "Maltempo addio, arriva lunga Ottobrata con sole in tutta Italia: previsioni meteo\nDecisa rimonta dell'alta pressione sulla Penisola\n| [AdnKronos](/archivio/news/giornalista/16145) |\nIl maltempo se ne va. Dopo i primi 10 giorni di Ottobre all'insegna di piogge, allagamenti e allerta anche rossa, è in arrivo tanto sole con una bella Ottobrata su gran parte dell'Italia. Antonio Sanò, fondatore de iLMeteo.it, conferma la decisa rimonta dell’alta pressione sull’Italia con la cessazione delle forti piogge che hanno colpito soprattutto il Centro-Nord nella prima decade di Ottobre.\nNelle prossime ore avremo ancora qualche residuo addensamento specie sul Triveneto orientale, in Toscana e sul Basso Tirreno, accompagnato da locali piovaschi; per il resto il tempo sarà in deciso miglioramento ovunque. Le temperature scenderanno leggermente a causa di venti più freschi dai quadranti settentrionali, specie al Meridione e in Sardegna, ma torneremo a percepire il calore del sole da Nord a Sud; gli ultimi 10 giorni perturbati hanno offuscato la memoria delle belle e serene giornate autunnali di una volta a molti abitanti del Centro-Nord.\nNel weekend rivivremo queste belle giornate con il sole che tornerà ad illuminare il foliage dei boschi; a tratti, il sole sarà disturbato da correnti più umide solo al Nord-Ovest e in montagna con addensamenti comunque non forieri di precipitazioni. Temperature Lungo le coste il sole scalderà quasi ovunque fino a valori gradevoli: sono previste massime di 28°C in Sardegna e Sicilia, fino a 27°C in Puglia e Calabria, 25-26°C in Basilicata con Napoli e Roma a 24°C, Firenze a 22°C e Milano sui 20. La media delle massime di Ottobre a Milano è 18°C, sulla Capitale 22°C; entro il weekend, dunque, saliremo nelle due principali città italiane di 2 gradi oltre i valori climatologici.\nQuanto dura\nAddirittura, le ultime emissioni dei modelli indicano la possibilità della persistenza del bel tempo quasi fino alla fine del mese, con una lunga e mite Ottobrata su buona parte del Paese. In questa proiezione meteo ottimistica non sono esclusi due veloci passaggi un po’ perturbati sia venerdì 18 sia venerdì 25 ottobre; per il resto l’anticiclone dovrebbe dominare e fermarsi a lungo sul nostro Paese. Ovviamente si tratta di una tendenza da confermare.\nNel dettaglio\nVenerdì 11. Al Nord: piovaschi sui monti emiliani, sole altrove. Al Centro: piovaschi sulla Toscana interna. Al Sud: nubi residue con locali piovaschi sulle tirreniche.\nSabato 12. Al Nord: nuvoloso. Al Centro: soleggiato. Al Sud: soleggiato.\nDomenica 13. Al Nord: sole prevalente. Al Centro: soleggiato. Al Sud: bel tempo.\nTendenza: rinforzo dell’anticiclone, un po' penalizzato il Nord.\nIscriviti alla Newsletter di OggiTreviso.
