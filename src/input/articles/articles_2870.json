    "text": "Yellow Brick Games’ action-adventure title Eternal Strands has looked impressive in its pre-launch showings thus far, and at the recent Xbox Partner Preview showcase, the developer once again showed off the title with a new trailer- and yes, it continues to look promising.\nEternal Strands will boast explosive, frantic combat that will see players commanding a variety of different magical abilities, from command over fire and ice elemental attacks to being able to telekinetically throw anything and everything (including yourself). Interactivity also seems to be a huge focal point here, so when the game says you can, for instance, burn or freeze everything, it seems like it means everything .\nOf course, as past trailers have confirmed, boss battles against gigantic enemies towering over you will also be a big part of Eternal Strands , and we see plenty of glimpses of that in this trailer as well, with the game continuing to show shades of Shadow of the Colossus . Check out the trailer below.\nEternal Strands is due out in early 2025 for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. Yellow Brick Games has also announced that the game will be available via Game Pass day one.",

    "text": "\"We are ready to host a peace summit in which Russia will also participate\"\nPresidency Of The Republic Of Turkey\n08.03.2024\nHolding a joint press conference with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, President ErdoÄan said: \"Since the beginning, we have made, and continue to make every contribution in our power for the termination of the war on the basis of negotiations. We are ready to host a peace summit in which Russia will also participate.\"\nPresident Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine held a joint press conference following their meeting in Istanbul.\nExpressing his pleasure to be welcoming President Zelenskyy and his delegation to Istanbul, President ErdoÄan extended his 'get well soon' wishes to Ukraine and Greece over the missile attack that took place close to a site President Zelenskyy and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece were visiting on Wednesday, and stated: \"I offer my condolences for the Ukrainian citizens who lost their lives in the war, which has finished its second year. During today's talks with my treasured friend, we have discussed in detail the developments regarding the war. I expressed to him our findings with all sincerity as a friend.\"\n\"WE CONTINUE TO MAKE EVERY CONTRIBUTION IN OUR POWER FOR THE TERMINATION OF THE WAR\"\nRe-emphasizing TÃ¼rkiye's support for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, Ankara's strategic partner, President ErdoÄan said: \"Unfortunately, the negative repercussions of the war have been increasing on a regional and global scale, particularly in Ukraine. No diplomatic step has been taken of a quality that could come close to the negotiating table we formed for the establishment of peace in Istanbul in March 2022. Since the beginning, we have made, and continue to make every contribution in our power for the termination of the war on the basis of negotiations. We are ready to host a peace summit in which Russia will also participate. During our consultations, we have also exchanged views on issues related to the stability of the Black Sea, such as export corridors and navigational safety. As you remember, the Black Sea Initiative had prevented a global food crisis by enabling nearly 33 million tons of grains to be transported to those in need. That agreement was also inked in this hall. If an intention is expressed for a new agreement between the parties, we stand ready to lend all the support in our power again as we have done previously.\"\n\"WE ARE PLEASED BY THE STABLE COURSE OF OUR BILATERAL TRADE\"\nDrawing attention to the importance TÃ¼rkiye attaches to Ukraine standing on its own feet economically and achieving lasting security, President ErdoÄan stated: \"In this context, our support for Ukraine's goal of integration with Euro-Atlantic organizations is permanent. During today's talks, we have also thoroughly reviewed the issues concerning our bilateral relations. We are pleased by the stable course our bilateral trade follows despite the war. We have agreed to increase our efforts to reach the $10bn target. The Free Trade Agreement's immediate entry into force will undoubtedly add new momentum to our relations. Many of our companies continue their operations, confronting the risks brought about by the war. We will also strongly support Ukraine's reconstruction efforts. In this context, we held the Forum on the Reconstruction of Ukraine last January in Istanbul. I have no doubts whatsoever that our companies will be preferred by the Ukrainian government in order for them to take on more responsibilities in the period ahead.\"\nTouching upon the critical role the Crimean Tatars play in the relations between TÃ¼rkiye and Ukraine, President ErdoÄan said: \"Crimean Tatars' existence in Ukraine is one of the important elements that strengthen the friendship between the two countries. Crimean Tatars, an indispensable part of Ukraine, have been endeavoring tirelessly for the restoration of the country's territorial integrity. I would like to thank Mr. Zelenskyy once again for his efforts aimed at safeguarding the rights of our kinsmen and strengthening their autonomous status. We, for our part, have always supported and will continue to support our Crimean Tatar kinsmen. While maintaining our solidarity with Ukraine in the period ahead, we will also continue our works for the termination of the war with a fair peace through negotiations. I wish that our consultations today may lead to favorable developments for the entire humanity, particularly for our respective countries.\"\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|",

    "title": "Hippo Harvest: Controlled Environment Agriculture Company Raises $21 Million",
    "text": "Hippo Harvest – a controlled environment agriculture (CEA) startup developing advanced greenhouse systems that produce sustainably grown produce – announced the closing of its $21 million Series B funding round led by Standard Investments. And Congruent Ventures, Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Hawthorne Food Ventures, and Energy Impact Partners also joined the round. This funding round will scale the company’s greenhouse operations and expand its product offerings into new categories of leafy greens. Launched in 2019, Hippo Harvest operates a first-of-its-kind repurposed greenhouse facility in Pescadero, CA, that out-competes traditional greenhouses in scalability and unit economics. This is comparable to traditional outdoor-grown produce prices. The company utilizes a closed-loop, non-recirculating, direct-to-root fertilizer system, machine learning, and autonomous mobile robots for calculating and efficiently distributing water, fertilizer, light, and heating on a micro-climate basis throughout its greenhouses. The result is significantly more cost- and resource-efficient production of fresh produce. Consumers and retailers enjoy Hippo greens’ superior quality, consistency, and food safety at competitive prices. Hippo’s farming methods increase food safety and extend shelf life by up to 30% compared to outdoor-grown produce due to several unique factors. The plants are irrigated with purified water and a uniquely customized nutrient blend from below, rather than above, reducing the risk of pathogen and fungus formation caused by water and nutrients touching the leaves. Off-the-shelf robots with customized attachments are used for tening to and harvest the plants, delivering precise water levels and nutrition for healthier plants. And all production is done in a clean, controlled greenhouse, reducing damage and quality variations in conventional outdoor farming. The products are packed on-site immediately after harvesting, using 100% post-consumer recycled plastic. Rather than conventional chemical pesticides, the company uses beneficial insects, natural oils, and other pesticide-free practices. Hippo Harvest’s approach to growing produce in greenhouses addresses a critical need to reduce climate change-related volatility in the fresh-food supply chain. It also offers ecological benefits like significantly reducing water and fertilizer use, even in low-water environments or areas with limited agricultural space, and reducing methane-producing agricultural waste caused by traditional farming without sacrificing accessibility and affordability at a commercial scale. These characteristics increase the availability of locally grown fresh food and provide communities with more accessible water, a cleaner environment, and safer, more stable agricultural jobs without sacrificing accessibility and affordability at a commercial scale. The company has signed The Climate Pledge, a commitment co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism for businesses to reach net-zero carbon by 2040. San Francisco residents can now find Hippo Harvest products on the shelf at their local Gus’s Community Markets or online at Amazon Fresh, with more locations coming soon in Northern California. KEY QUOTES: “We’re excited by the opportunity to scale our production and reach more consumers with high-quality, sustainable produce. Our team’s work over the past twelve months demonstrates our ability to create modular, cost-effective growing systems that can be deployed across the country. We look forward to working with our investors to make it a reality.” - Hippo Harvest CEO Eitan Marder-Eppstein “Since inception, Hippo has delivered superior produce while maintaining cost efficiencies. Standard invests in companies disrupting traditional industry and we are thrilled to partner with Hippo on its journey to scale.” - Logan Ashcraft, Principal at Standard Investments, who joins Hippo’s Board of Directors",
