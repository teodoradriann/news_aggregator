    "text": "60 jobs saved as Purity Brewing Company bought out of administration [Jungmin Seo](https://www.thecaterer.com/authors/jungmin-seo) The new owner of Vinoteca and D&D London has bought Purity Brewing Company and Pure Craft Bars out of administration, saving all 60 staff jobs in the process. Investment firm Breal Capital has acquired Warwickshire-based Purity Brewing Company, which was founded in 2005 and is the parent company of Purecraft, which operates a bar and kitchen in Birmingham. Joint administrators Mike Denny and Mark Firmin of professional services firm Alvarez & Marsal Europe LLP sold both businesses to Breal, which has been on a hospitality acquisition spree since last year. The London-based firm bought Yorkshire's [Black Sheep Brewery](https://www.thecaterer.com/news/black-sheep-brewery-sold-london-investor) in May 2023, as well as London craft brewers Brick Brewery, [Brew by Numbers](https://www.thecaterer.com/news/brew-by-numbers-brewery-collapse-breal-capital) and wine bar [Vinoteca](https://www.thecaterer.com/news/vinoteca-administration-sold-wine-bar) in August. Breal also acquired [D&D London](https://www.thecaterer.com/news/dd-london-sale-restaurant-expansion) in October last year with private investment company Calveton in a deal that reportedly valued the restaurant group at around £60m, including debt. Mike Denny, managing director at Alvarez & Marsal, said: \"Like many operators in the hospitality sector, Purity Brewing and Purecraft have endured tough market conditions. Most recently, the impact of significant cost inflation coupled with reduced discretionary spend has placed significant strain on the companies. \"We're pleased to have preserved the future of both businesses and the Purity brand by delivering the sale to Breal Capital, safeguarding all 60 local jobs.\" Image Credit: Purecraft Bar and Kitchen / Facebook",

    "title": "Washington Healthcare Company Ordered to Pay Workers Almost $100M for Missed Meal Breaks, Unpaid Time",
    "text": "Seyfarth Synopsis: Last week, a Washington healthcare company was ordered to pay 33,000 workers $98.3 million in damages in a class action related to its meal break and timeclock rounding practices. The vast majority of the awarded damages pertain to missed meal breaks, but the award included an offset of about $1 million to account for the fact that some employees signed meal break waivers. This case is a potent reminder of the importance of training managers on meal break requirements, scheduling and providing meal breaks in compliance with Washington law, and clearly documenting employee meal break waivers.\nBackground\nIn September 2021, a class action lawsuit was filed against the healthcare company claiming that the company systematically failed to provide employees with a second 30-minute meal break when employees worked shifts longer than ten hours (Washington law requires employers to provide non-exempt employees with a 30-minute unpaid meal break for every five hours worked).\nPlaintiffs also claimed that the healthcare company’s payroll policy of rounding time worked to the nearest 15-minute increment generally deprived workers of wages due, though plaintiffs conceded that, in some instances, the rounding practice resulted in workers being paid more than they were due.\nIn January 2024, King County Superior Court Judge Averil Rothrock granted partial summary judgment in the plaintiffs’ favor on both claims. Accordingly, the issue remaining for trial was damages: plaintiffs asked the jury to award them approximately $9.3 million in damages related to the rounding system and $90.3 million for missed second 30-minute meal breaks.\nOn April 18, 2024, the jury awarded plaintiffs $98.3 million in damages. Although the jury verdict form reportedly indicated that the jury initially awarded the workers their full request of $99.6 million in damages, the jury ultimately reduced that amount by about $1.3 million, finding that the company had shown some employees had signed written meal break waivers.\nTakeaways\nCertainly a verdict so sizeable puts a spotlight on Washington employers’ wage and hour compliance. Meal break and rounding practices, however, present compliance challenges in other states and under the FLSA, as well. And the size of this Washington verdict will certainly attract plaintiffs’ lawyers’ attention to those challenges nationally.\nSee more »\nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations.\n© Seyfarth Shaw LLP\nRefine your interests »",

    "title": "20 Times MCU fans were positively surprised",
    "text": "The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has expanded its reach far and wide. This series about superhumans trying to save the Earth and humanity from both internal and external threats is loved by the audience. It shows how there is both good and evil residing everywhere, and the survival of humans is constantly challenged with one side trying to dominate the other. The screenplays written for this cinematic universe are always top-notch and are executed with such perfection that it often leads to the creation of such moments that leave the audience awed. Here is a list of 20 times MCU fans were positively surprised.\n20) Thor proving he is worthy\nIn the 2011 movie Thor, we get a heartwarming scene that leaves the audience in a bitter-sweet state of shock. As a way to prove his worth when Thor is facing the Destroyer, he selflessly sacrifices his life. This sacrifice determined his worth as a God of Asgard. It was then that Mjolnir, the magical hammer that Thor uses, which earlier belonged to the God - Odin, flies to him, bringing him back to life and reigning him as the God of Thunder. Whether it was the symbolic power of the scene or the emotional death, it resonated; it left the audience enthralled.\n19) Cameo of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield in Spider-Man: No Way Home\nThroughout the history of the Marvel cinematic universe, we have had a number of Spider-mans. Fans were left shocked and nostalgic when the movie Spiderman: No Way Home was released in 2021, and it featured all three Spidermen (Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield, and Toby Maguire) coming together on the big screen for the first time. Somehow, Marvel managed to keep this cameo a secret, and the theatre was left hooting and crying when the scene took place.\n18) Captain America lifting Thor’s hammer\nIt is a fact well known that only the worthy could lift Thor's hammer. To date, no living entity besides Thor and Odin had managed to pick up the hammer. During the pivotal fight scene in Avengers Endgame, none other than Captain America managed to pick up the hammer and save Thor from Thanos. This scene was truly a chilling surprise that was loved by the audience and was a great inclusion on the part of the screenwriters.\n17) Miley Cyrus’s cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\nGuardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2 featured a cameo from the pop star Miley Cyrus. She is featured as the voice of a robot. This was quite an unexpected cameo, and fans loved it. While it wasn't a grand addition, Miley was quite popular during this period and her unexpected casting, even though for a brief period, left the audience cheering.\n16) Harry Styles' cameo in Eternals\nEternals was released in 2021. While not particularly focusing on the Avengers, this story was an expansion to the cosmic side of the Marvel universe. Although it had a star cast already, in the post-credit scenes in a classic Marvel fashion, a cameo was made by none other than the singer Harry Styles. Harry Styles is a big name in pop culture, and seeing him star as Eros/Star Fox was a very exciting moment for the audience.\n15) Robert Downey Jr.’s return as Doctor Doom\nWhen the Avengers series ended with the movie Avengers Endgame, it was quite a sad ending. This is because the much-loved superhero of the series – Iron Man, sacrificed himself to save humanity. The actor Robert Downey Jr, who portrays Iron Man, is much loved by the fans of the franchise. People were not able to digest the fact that Robert Downey Jr's journey with the series was coming to an end. Thus, when Marvel announced that RDJ would be returning to the MCU as the evil Dr. Doom, fans were quite happy and surprised to hear about it.\n14) Fat Thor\nThor, the God of Thunder, is one of the most powerful Avengers. Chris Hemsworth, the actor who portrays the role of Thor, makes sure that he is in good shape to give the character his powerful personality. He is tall, lean and bulked up, almost oozing strength. Thus, during the events of Avengers: Endgame, after the Avengers lost the war to Thanos, we see Thor trying to deal with the loss and failing to do so. He is now fat, lethargic and lazy, not at all the God-like physique he had previously. This unexpected change shocked the audience but in quite a hilarious manner.\n13) Vision picking up Thor’s Hammer\nWhile we are aware that picking up Thor's hammer is a big deal and only Thor, Odin, and now Captain America have managed to do so, one of the unexpected surprises was when Vision managed to pick up the hammer. Now, vision wasn't human. He was an artificial intelligence-integrated robot, so it wasn't that big of a deal, but still, it was proof of his worthiness and left the audience stunned.\n12) Loki’s savior moment in Thor: Ragnarok\nFans of the MCU often appreciate the love-hate relationship of the brothers, Thor and Loki. While Loki is known for his betraying and selfish nature, a surprise came to the audience when Loki turned into a saviour. To save the people of Asgard, he shows up with Sakaarian Gladiators thus making the audience like him because of his morally grey nature.\n11) Thor’s entry in Avengers: Infinity War\nAvengers: Infinity War features the battle of Wakanda. During this scene, while the Avengers, combined with the Wakandan army, are trying to save the Earth and fight Thanos and his army, they are losing. But when Thor makes his appearance during this moment saving them, his arrival is almost heroic. This time, he also shows up with a new weapon, not his hammer, which was destroyed, but the storm breaker. This scene left the audience with a standing ovation.\n10) Steve Rogers, Natasha, and Sam’s entrance to save Wanda and Vision\nAnother moment in the movie Avengers: Infinity War that left the audience in a state of shock, was during one of the introduction scenes. Set in Edinburgh, Scotland, Wanda Maximoff, also known as the Scarlet Witch, is trying to save Vision from the most trusted members of Thanos's court, as they are trying to kill them. During this scene, we see the Scarlet Witch trying her best, but she is vastly outnumbered. As she prepares to fight one last time, we see an epic return of the Avengers. After Captain America: Civil War, it was a very unexpected move and made the audience cry out in happiness.\n9) Captain Marvel’s return in Avengers: Endgame\nBrie Larson portrays the role of Captain Marvel, the superhuman and super powerful entity in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. During the battle in Avengers: Endgame, her return is a pivotal moment. She has quite a dramatic entry as she destroys Thanos’s massive spaceship - sanctuary II, single-handedly. It is a glimpse of her power and makes the audience shout out in happiness as their faith is restored that the Avengers can win this war, which they were earlier losing.\n8) Teaming up of female Avengers in Avengers: Endgame\nAn ode to the feministic ways was also given during the final battle of the Avengers: Endgame. During this scene, the major female heroes – Captain Marvel, Scarlet Witch, Valkyrie, Gamora, Pepper Potts, Nebula, the Wasp, Shuri, and others teamed up, creating a goosebump-inducing moment. It was a nod to the empowerment of females and left the audience shocked and the scene was greatly applauded in the theatres.\n7) Daredevil’s cameo in Spider-Man: No Way Home\nA standout movement in the Marvel Cinematic Universe was the cameo of Matt Murdock, also known as the Daredevil, played by Charlie Cox in Spiderman: No Way Home. This was quite an unexpected cameo and was loved by the fans. In fact, this was one of the first times that Marvel TV characters were included in their cinematic universe. His entry with the line \"I am a really good lawyer\" left the audience screaming with excitement.\n6) Thor summoning lightning without his hammer\nDuring the events of the movie Thor: Ragnarok, we happened to witness the battle of Asgard. His weapon, Mjolnir, was destroyed, leaving him without his power. But there is a reason why he is called the God of Thunder. He manages to summon a lightning strike without his hammer. This scene, for the first time, gives a preview of the raw power that lies within Thor. It left the audience awestruck and praising the execution of this wonderful move.\n5) Captain America passing on his shield to Sam\nEverybody knows that Captain America's weapon of choice is his shield. In one of the most heartfelt and symbolic moments of the universe, we see Captain America as Steve Rogers, now old and sitting on a bench. Sam Wilson, also known as the Falcon, approaches him, and as both of them have a heart-to-heart, Captain passes on his shield to Sam. This scene is quite pivotal in the history of MCU, as it shows the legacy of Captain America, being carried on through the character of the Falcon.\n4) Every character appearing in Avengers: Endgame\nDuring a goosebump-inducing scene during the battle in Avengers: Endgame, we see Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor getting ready to sacrifice themselves by facing Thanos and his vast army together. But in a truly shocking moment, we see a massive army coming to join Captain America. Through magical portals made by Dr Strange, we see every MCU superhero make their appearance. Black Panther, Spiderman, Guardians of the Galaxy, Scarlet Witch, and a lot of others make their appearances together on the big screen for the first time, leaving a chilling environment in the theatre.\n3)Tony Stark’s cameo in The Incredible Hulk\nTony Stark's cameo in the 2008 movie, The Incredible Hulk was one of the first moments of interconnectedness and formation of the MCU, establishing itself as a franchise. In true Marvel fashion, this scene takes place during the post-credits. When General Ross is sitting at a bar and Tony walks up to him and says, \"We Are putting a team together”, we see the initiation of the Avengers.\n2) Tony Stark’s revelation of being Iron Man\nIt goes without saying in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that every superhero keeps his identity a secret. But during the events of the movie Iron Man, we see Tony Stark, the billionaire, reveal his true identity during a press conference in the post-credit scenes. The simple yet chilling line, \"I am Iron Man,\" leaves the audience shocked. But because this revelation is so in sync with the true nature of Tony Stark, the audience loved this addition and truly appreciated this moment.\n1) Captain America’s ‘Avengers, assemble’ in Avengers: Endgame\nOne of the most awaited lines in the entire MCU was Captain America saying, “Avengers, assemble.” In every film, Marvel builds up this moment with Captain saying - ‘Avengers,’ and then the movie cuts without him completing his sentence. Fans had waited for this moment for a long time. But the screenwriters knew the perfect moment to use this iconic line, and they made the wait worth it. During the battle in Avengers: Endgame, when we have every Avenger, every character, and every superhero on the battlefield together, it is then when Captain America delivers this iconic line, leaving the audience in a state of shock, surprise, and awe.",
