    "title": "Court of Appeal ruling will prevent UK museums from charging reproduction fees—at last",
    "text": "A recent judgement on copyright in the Court of Appeal (20 November) heralds the end of UK museums charging fees to reproduce historic artworks. In fact, it suggests museums have been mis-selling “image licences” for over a decade. For those of us who have been campaigning on the issue for years, it is the news we’ve been waiting for. The judgement is important because it confirms that museums do not have valid copyright in photographs of (two-dimensional) works which are themselves out of copyright. It means these photographs are in the public domain, and free to use. Museums use copyright to restrict the circulation of images, obliging people to buy expensive licences. Any thought of scholars sharing images, or using those available on museum websites, was claimed to be a breach of copyright. Not surprisingly, most people paid up. Copyright is the glue that holds the image fee ecosystem in place. What has now changed? Museums used to rely on the 1988 Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, which placed a low threshold on how copyright was acquired; essentially, if some degree of “skill and labour” was involved in taking a photograph of a painting, then that photograph enjoyed copyright. But subsequent case law has raised the bar, as the new Appeal Court judgement makes clear. In his ruling (THJ v Sheridan, 2023), Lord Justice Arnold wrote that, for copyright to arise: “What is required is that the author was able to express their creative abilities in the production of the work by making free and creative choices so as to stamp the work created with their personal touch”. Importantly, he went on: “This criterion is not satisfied where the content of the work is dictated by technical considerations, rules or other constraints which leave no room for creative freedom”. In other words, if the aim of a museum photograph is to accurately reproduce a painting (which it must be), then it cannot acquire copyright. Copyright bar since 2009 Moreover, Lord Justice Arnold pointed out that the new copyright bar has been in place since 2009. This raises doubts about the basis on which most museums have sold image licences since then. As Eleonora Rosati, professor of intellectual property law at Stockholm University tells me, “technically, this has been wrong for ten-plus years”. In fact, some museums have long been aware of the true status of UK copyright law, despite suggesting otherwise publicly. The Tate has internally accepted the new definition for some years, yet still claims copyright over its historic collection in a number of ways. In a statement to me, the Tate says it charges fees “for supplying high-resolution digital images from our picture library. These are different to copyright fees, which are not applied to images unless they are covered by copyright law.” Of course, the Tate only has to use its picture library to supply high-resolution images because it only shows low-resolution images on its website. But here is the main point: those © symbols on UK museum websites and catalogues are now redundant if the original artwork is itself out of copyright. There is no reason not to use these images for free (and nobody would argue against paying for new images, if needed). The National Gallery marks images “© National Gallery”, and in its terms and conditions forbids reproduction unless “expressly permitted under copyright law”. But since there is no copyright, reproduction is indeed permitted (expressly or otherwise, there is no distinction). No major UK museum has taken anyone to court over copyright of such images, and no sensible trustee will let them now. Surely museums will now change their policies? The National Gallery told me in a statement: “We are aware of this recent Appeal Court ruling and we will be reviewing its guidance.” Since I have also established, through a Freedom of Information request, that the National Gallery has been losing money on its image licensing operation, hopefully it will embrace this chance to abolish image fees altogether. Then the gallery, art historians and the public, will be practically, legally, culturally and financially better off. For art history, this is a judgement where everyone wins.",

    "text": "While Standard Chartered expects the price of Bitcoin to roughly quintuple by the end of 2029, the multinational bank says that there's an altcoin that could substantially outrun it.\nLayer-1 blockchain Avalanche’s utility token AVAX could jump to $250 by the end of the decade—a 1,326% spike as of this writing—according to an April report from the bank.\nBy comparison, Standard Chartered predicts that Bitcoin’s price will rise nearly 500% to $500,000 by the end of 2029.\nAVAX is currently trading at $18, while Bitcoin is hovering near $82,650, CoinGecko data shows.\nAvalanche’s unique approach to scaling its network through sets of dedicated L1 app networks (previously called subnets) will likely drive the predicted price boom, wrote Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered.\n“Avalanche’s current small market cap means that incremental development improvements can have a big impact,” Kendrick said in the report. “As a result, we see AVAX outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of relative price gains.”\nAvalanche is one of several blockchains that have aggressively aimed to improve transaction speeds and costs on its network in a bid to attract more users and developers.\nLong considered the Wild West of the crypto industry, the DeFi or decentralized finance sector courts far fewer users than centralized platforms, leading to fierce competition among protocols.\nLast December, Avalanche completed its Etna Upgrade, increasing support for its scaling solution and making it cheaper to engage with the network. Following the upgrade, the cost of establishing an L1 on Avalanche fell dramatically. Since then, more developers have flocked to Avalanche—and that migration to the network could continue, according to Kendrick.\n“We think the current development momentum is likely to continue, supporting activity growth on Avalanche and driving AVAX price gains,” Kendrick said.\nHe added that “while it is still too early to tell whether the new [L1] approach will work… the fact that one-quarter of active [L1s] are already Etna-compatible is encouraging.”\nStandard Chartered expects positive price action for AVAX as soon as this year, with the bank predicting that the token will hit $55 by the end of 2025, according to the report. The bank's forecast predicts the token's price will hit $100 in 2026, $150 in 2027 and $200 in 2028.\nAVAX peaked at a price of nearly $145 in 2021 and sits nearly 88% below that mark, as of this writing.\nEdited by James Rubin",

ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — Cornerback Riley Moss is set to make his return to game action.\nThe second-year cornerback was a full participant in practice for the third consecutive day, and he was not assigned a game status for Saturday's game against the Bengals.\n\"He'll be ready to go,\" Head Coach Sean Payton said Thursday.\nThe absence of a game status indicates a player is expected to be available for the upcoming game.\nMoss has not played since suffering a knee injury in Week 12 against the Raiders.\nRunning back Jaleel McLaughlin (quad) and wide receiver Troy Franklin (ankle) were also listed as full participants and not assigned game statuses.\nRunning back Tyler Badie, who was designated for return from injured reserve this week, is listed as questionable with a back injury. He was a full participant in all three practices this week, but Denver would need to activate him to the 53-man roster for him to play vs. Cincinnati.\nThe Broncos will face the Bengals at 2:30 p.m. MT on NFL Network on Saturday.\nRelated Content",

    "title": "Adesão dos médicos à greve no Algarve ronda os 60%",
    "text": "Segundo o dirigente sindical, regista-se uma \"boa adesão\" também da parte dos médicos à paralisação convocada para hoje, o que, juntando aos enfermeiros e aos trabalhadores do regime geral, resulta numa participação geral de 70% a 80%.\n\"A saúde no Algarve está hoje paralisada. A nível do hospital de Faro, o serviço de urgência e o bloco operatório estão a funcionar em serviços mínimos. O serviço de urgência até poderia dizer abaixo dos serviços mínimos, que infelizmente é o padrão normal daquilo que se passa no Algarve\" referiu.\nEm Faro, pelo menos duas Unidades de Saúde Familiar aderiram a 100% à greve e outras, não estando encerradas, também têm alguns profissionais em falta, acrescentou.\nSegundo André Gomes, o funcionamento das urgências, no dia em que se cumpre a greve, é semelhante aos dias normais, pois o facto de haver trabalhadores a menos contribui para aumentar a demora na resposta e o prolongamento dos tempos de espera.\n\"Porque há menos trabalhadores do que deveriam existir e isto em tempos normais, não é por causa da greve. Se forem lá amanhã ou para a semana vão encontrar a mesma situação, é o mesmo panorama\", frisou.\nAndré Gomes apontou ainda como exemplo o facto de no Algarve Central, ou seja, em Faro, Albufeira e Loulé, haver apenas uma médica a garantir a assistência em cuidados paliativos durante o ano inteiro.\n\"Portanto, não é pela greve, o Algarve está ligado às máquinas todo o ano e esta greve é esse alerta para que possamos salvar o Algarve, portanto, é o apelo que fazemos ao Governo\", concluiu.\nA greve nos serviços de saúde do Algarve está hoje a afetar os serviços de urgência, consultas externas e o funcionamento do bloco operatório do hospital de Faro, disseram fontes dos sindicatos que convocaram a paralisação.\nNo caso dos enfermeiros, a adesão à greve ronda os 80% e, no bloco operatório, a adesão é de 100%, com o cancelamento de todas as cirurgias programadas e só estando a ser realizadas cirurgias oncológicas, segundo os sindicatos.\nA greve, marcada para entre as 00:00 e as 24:00 de hoje, abrange todos os profissionais da saúde que trabalham no Serviço Nacional de Saúde (SNS) na região (correspondente ao distrito de Faro), que exigem, entre outras reivindicações, a contratação de mais pessoal para travar o desgaste a que dizem estar a ser sujeitos.\nLeia Também: Médicos da Bissaya Barreto entregam escusas de responsabilidade",
