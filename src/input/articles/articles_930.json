    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.

    "title": "Safety first: The potential of autonomous trucks to reduce road accidents",
    "text": "Sharing the road with massive trucks can be intimidating. We’ve all been there. The sheer size and weight of these vehicles mean that accidents involving them are often catastrophic. Imagine a future where these trucks could drive themselves with precision, drastically reducing the likelihood of accidents.\nIn this blog post, we’ll explore how autonomous trucks could transform road safety, making our journeys safer and our roads more reliable.\nThe current state of trucking accidents The reality of truck accidents is sobering. Many of these crashes stem from preventable causes like driver fatigue, distraction, and human error. Truck drivers often face grueling schedules and long hours, leading to dangerous driving conditions. Mechanical failures also play a role, but human error remains the leading cause of these tragic incidents.\nIn addition to fatalities, truck accidents result in significant economic costs. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) estimates that the average cost of a fatal truck crash is $3.6 million . This figure includes medical expenses, property damage, lost productivity, and legal costs. Reducing these accidents would save lives and alleviate substantial financial burdens.\nHow they work So, how do these trucks work? At their core, they use a combination of advanced technologies to navigate roads and traffic. These technologies include sensors, cameras, radar, and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) systems. Together, they create a detailed, 360-degree view of the truck’s surroundings. AI and machine learning algorithms process this data in real time, making split-second decisions to keep the truck on course and out of harm’s way.\nThere are different levels of vehicle automation, ranging from Level 1 (driver assistance) to Level 5 (full automation with no human intervention). Most self-driving trucks in development today are at Level 4, meaning they can handle all driving tasks in certain conditions without human input.\nSafety features Driverless trucks are equipped with a suite of safety features designed to prevent accidents:\nAdvanced sensors and cameras : These detect obstacles, pedestrians, and other vehicles, ensuring the truck can navigate safely. AI and machine learning : These technologies analyze vast amounts of data to improve driving patterns and predict potential hazards. Communication systems : Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication allows trucks to communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure, providing early warnings about road conditions or traffic. These features enable automated trucks to maintain safe following distances, stay within lanes, and make informed decisions about when to change lanes or merge.\nFor instance, if an obstacle is detected ahead, the truck can adjust its speed or change lanes to avoid a collision. This level of precision and foresight is challenging for human drivers, who may be distracted or fatigued.\nPotential safety benefits The potential safety benefits are significant:\nReduction in human error : By eliminating human error, which is responsible for the majority of accidents, computer-operated trucks can drastically reduce the number of crashes. Consistent operation : Unlike human drivers, they don’t suffer from fatigue or distraction. They operate with consistent precision, 24/7. Improved reaction times : Autonomous systems can react to hazards faster than humans, applying brakes or making evasive maneuvers in milliseconds. According to a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), equipping trucks with automated braking and collision warning systems could prevent up to 40% of rear-end collisions.\nAdditionally, automated trucks can maintain optimal speeds and safe distances, reducing the likelihood of accidents caused by speeding or tailgating.\nLegal aspects and support for truck accident victims In the event of an accident involving a truck—whether autonomous or not—understanding your legal rights is crucial. Truck accidents can result in severe injuries, significant medical expenses, and long-term consequences for victims and their families.\nLiability: If an autonomous truck is involved in an accident, determining who is at fault can be complex. Is it the truck manufacturer, the software developer, the trucking company, or another party? Legal frameworks are still evolving to address these questions, and each case may require careful investigation. Seeking compensation: Victims of truck accidents may be entitled to compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other damages. According to one truck accident attorney from Indiana , it’s important to gather as much evidence as possible from the accident scene, including photographs, witness statements, and police reports. This evidence can be crucial in establishing fault and pursuing a successful claim. Importance of legal guidance: Legal guidance is particularly important due to the complex technical and legal issues involved. Attorneys will have the expertise needed to navigate these unique challenges and advocate effectively on behalf of their clients. Challenges and considerations Despite the promising potential, there are challenges to overcome:\nTechnical limitations : These trucks still face technical hurdles, such as navigating adverse weather conditions and complex urban environments. Heavy rain, snow, and fog can interfere with sensor accuracy, posing a risk to safe operation. Regulatory and legal issues : The regulatory landscape for autonomous vehicles is still evolving. Questions about liability in the event of an accident remain unresolved. Different states have different regulations, creating a patchwork of rules that complicates nationwide deployment. Public perception and trust : Gaining public trust is crucial. Many people are understandably wary of sharing the road with driverless trucks. Building confidence in the technology through transparent communication and demonstration of safety records is essential. The road ahead Looking ahead, the future of automated truck safety is bright. Continuous advancements in technology will address current limitations. Collaboration between tech companies, truck manufacturers, and regulatory bodies will be key in creating a safe, efficient system for freight transport.\nAs these trucks become more common, we can expect a significant reduction in road accidents, making travel safer for everyone.\nOngoing research and development efforts are focused on improving sensor accuracy, enhancing AI decision-making capabilities, and ensuring robust cybersecurity measures to protect against hacking and system failures.\nMoreover, as more data is collected, machine learning algorithms will continue to improve, making these vehicles even safer and more reliable.\nFinal words Autonomous trucks hold immense potential to revolutionize road safety. By minimizing human error, operating consistently, and reacting swiftly to hazards, they promise to reduce the number of accidents dramatically.\nWhile challenges do remain, the path forward is clear: with continued innovation and thoughtful regulation, self-driving trucks will make our roads safer for all.\nAs we look to this future, it’s essential to stay informed and prepared. If accidents do occur, knowing your legal options can make a significant difference. Together, we can embrace this technology and work towards a safer, more reliable road network.",

Through this partnership, GP is equipping plywood shipments with Trackonomy's real-time tracking technology to provide precise arrival visibility to major retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's, helping communities prepare for storms with greater speed and confidence.\nWhen a hurricane is projected to make landfall, homeowners often have just a few days to secure their homes. That means demand for plywood spikes nearly overnight, especially in Gulf Coast regions where storm activity is expected to be intense this year. Retailers must respond immediately, often staging materials in advance and moving inventory rapidly from distribution centers to local stores.\nWith Trackonomy's SmartTape technology integrated into hurricane-season plywood shipments, retailers now receive real-time updates on the location and ETA of their deliveries. This allows stores to begin unloading and selling plywood directly off arriving trucks, accelerating product availability during peak demand periods.\n\"Every minute counts when preparing for a hurricane,\" said Zack Steffen , General Manager of Industrials at Trackonomy. \"By using our SmartTape, we're helping to close gaps between GP and their retail partners to keep an open line of communication from plant to customer, when it matters most.\"\nThis just-in-time visibility model helps GP become an even stronger partner to home improvement retailers during times of crisis. It's designed to deliver what many now call the \"Amazon effect\" to the lumber supply chain: minimizing idle time, cutting guesswork, and meeting customer expectations for real-time responsiveness.\n\"This partnership shows how real-time visibility isn't just about efficiency,Â it's about resilience,\" said Matt Wood, Sr Business Logistic Manager at Georgia -Pacific. \"When storms are on the horizon, knowing exactly when materials will arrive can make all the difference for our retail partners and more importantly, for the families and communities they serve.\"\nThe initial rollout of this initiative will focus on hurricane-related shipments of plywood to Home Depot and Lowe's. However, GP and Trackonomy are already exploring expansion into additional materials, including resin shipments, and broader shipment categories throughout the year.\nThis system is now fully operational and already supporting plywood shipments during this year's hurricane season, helping communities across the Gulf Coast and beyond stay one step ahead of the storms.\nTo learn more about SmartTape, visit https://trackonomy.ai/smarttape .\nAbout Georgia -Pacific\nGeorgia -Pacific is one of the world's leading manufacturers and marketers of tissue, pulp, paper, packaging, building products, and related chemicals.

    "text": "CUSTER COUNTY, S.D.- One person has been found dead after a house fire in rural Custer County. At 12:45 a.m. on December 20th, fire departments from Pringle, Argyle, and Custer were called for a report of a structure fire in Custer County between Pringle and Argyle. Custer County Emergency Management says that firefighters found a home with heavy smoke and visible flames, and executed an external attack of the fire. The fire was contained by 5:30 a.m., but an individual reported to be in the home had not been accounted for. An investigator from the South Dakota Fire Marshal’s office was called to the scene, and fire and law enforcement personnel searched the remains of the structure until they located the deceased individual just after noon. An autopsy has been performed, but the Custer County Sheriff's Office has not yet received the results. The individual has not been positively identified. DNA samples have been sent to the State Forensics Lab in Pierre. The investigation is ongoing and is led by the Custer County Sheriff's Office. Responding agencies include Pringle Fire Department, Argyle Fire Department, Custer Fire Department, Custer Ambulance, Custer County Sheriff’s Office, Custer Emergency Management, Custer County Coroner, Black Hills Electric COOP, and the South Dakota Fire Marshal’s Office.",

    "text": "Australian supermarket chain Woolworths has taken the precaution of recalling a batch of its mince pies due to potential metal contamination as families gather in anticipation of their holiday meals.\nThe New South Wales (NSW) Food Authority is urging consumers to check the types and best before dates of any fruit mince pies they may have purchased from Woolworths before they consume them.\nThis problem relates to the six-pack Shortcrust Summer Berry Mince Pies, which have a best-before date of June 13, 2024. Woolworths said the summer berry pies that have that best-before date are not suitable for eating. During the lead-up to Christmas, 560 packets of those recalled pies have been sold in New South Wales only since late November.\nTraditional Shortcrust Mince Pies and Fruit Mince Pies sold by the supermarket, however, are not affected by this potential metal contamination. \"This is one of several varieties of fruit mince pies sold by Woolworths, and no other fruit mince pies are affected,\" a statement said, per The Sydney Morning Herald . \"Woolworths takes product safety seriously and apologises for any inconvenience caused by this recall.\"\nThe supermarket has not received any complaints regarding the product and is recalling it as a precaution. Recall ed packets should be returned to the point of purchase for a full refund, according to Woolworths and the Food Authority.\nAnother popular holiday delicacy was recently pulled from store shelves. Astor Chocolate Corporation recalled more than 1,000 chocolate bars after discovering that Burnt Caramel Candy Bars may contain undeclared coconut, putting consumers at risk.\nApproximately 1,092 Burnt Caramel Candy Bars are affected by the product recall, according to a notice issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Dec. 21. The candy bars affected by the recall have Lot Code 0101614649, a Best By Date of 12/11/2024, and a UPC number 4099100202809.\nAccording to the FDA, no other Lot Codes or Astor Chocolate Corporation products are affected by the recall. These candy bars were distributed through Aldi's Haines City, Florida Distribution Center, which serves select Aldi stores in the state.\nThe Lakewood, New Jersey-based company issued the recall \"after it was discovered that the coconut-containing product was distributed in packaging that did not reveal the presence of coconut,\" per the FDA. Despite no illnesses being reported, coconut-allergic or highly sensitive individuals should avoid the candy bars.\nIn a statement concerning the recall, ALDI said, \"ALDI puts the safety and integrity of the products it sells first. If customers have a product affected by this recall, they are advised to discard it immediately or return it to their local store for a full refund. ALDI sincerely regrets the inconvenience and concern caused as a result of this recall.\"\n0 comments Related:\nUrgent Recall Issued for Children's Playset Amid Christmas Season Check Your Stockings: Candy Bar Recall Issued Honda Recalls More Than 2.5 Million Cars",
