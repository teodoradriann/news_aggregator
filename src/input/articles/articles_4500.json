(Cory Nordstrom/CTV News)\n\"What we're seeing today is, our topics on precision medicine, for example, the future of medicine and where it's going,\" Mudge said.\n\"We're seeing a lot on mobile health clinics, virtual care. We're also seeing topics on employee wellness and burnout and mitigation strategies related to that.\"\nThe three courses involved are health care leadership, health care administration and health informatics.

(Cory Nordstrom/CTV News)\nShe \"always wanted to bring health care and technology together,\" she said. Her group’s project explored artificial intelligence for customized treatment planning.\n\"When I have information like genetics, lifestyle, the past medical history, past surgical history and all the data that has been there,\" Varghese said.\n\"I call it as the big data migrating with all the things with the artificial intelligence that can actually give up a good personalized care.\"\nMeet potential employers The showcase serves as the students' culminating projects, but more importantly, it gives them the opportunity to discuss their ideas with potential employers.\nRepresentatives for Sault Area Hospital, Group Health Centre, and many more health-care organizations and businesses were on hand.\nHealth-care administration student Bolanle Oladipupo said the opportunity to share their projects with people in the industry meant a lot.\n\"One lady came up and she was like, 'This we need,'\" Oladipupo said.\n\"And she actually took our handouts and she was writing down some things. It's so good, and it makes us proud that what we have actually done is reasonable and people can reason with us.\"\n\"Coming here as a team member at Sault Area Hospital and seeing the passion that they have for healthcare, is incredible,\" said Brandy Sharp Young, of SAH.\nDownload the CTV News app now Get local breaking news alerts Daily newsletter with the top local stories emailed to your inbox \"The ideas that they have, lots of hospital staff have been able to come through here today and see what the students are doing, and we look at these ideas and think, 'How can we partner?

    "text": "Luis Carlos Leal 6 junio El superintendente Nacional de Salud, Luis Carlos Leal, ha lanzado una severa advertencia a las diferentes Entidades Promotoras de Salud (EPS) que están solicitando su retiro voluntario del programa de salud. En un pronunciamiento reciente, Leal subrayó que estas decisiones no deben ser tomadas con el fin de evadir intervenciones administrativas por parte de la entidad supervisora. “Espero que las EPS y las aseguradoras sean lo suficientemente responsables y comprometidas con lo que hicieron al vincularse a un sistema de salud y aceptar las reglas establecidas,” indicó Leal. “Porque si efectivamente la necesidad de retiro es por miedo a ser investigados, pues que se sepa la verdad. Yo creo que el país debe saber la verdad antes de presentar cualquier tipo de retiro y los recursos de la salud se verían protegidos”, manifestó. Lea también (José Fernando Cardona, expresidente de Nueva EPS en la mira por ocultar facturas por $5.5 billones) Retiros recientes y proceso de verificación En las últimas horas, la EPS Salud Bolívar presentó una carta de retiro voluntario y definitivo. Esta acción se suma a las solicitudes de retiro por parte de Compensar EPS y Sura EPS. Sin embargo, Leal señaló que Compensar aún no ha completado los requisitos necesarios para iniciar el estudio de su solicitud, mientras que Salud Bolívar apenas presentó su solicitud, que ahora está siendo verificada. En el caso de Sura, se está llevando a cabo un plan de desmonte progresivo, y la Superintendencia de Salud está verificando que todos los documentos necesarios sean entregados de manera completa y en los tiempos reglamentarios. Auditoría a la Fiduprevisora La Superintendencia Nacional de Salud también ha iniciado una auditoría integral al sistema de contratación de la Fiduprevisora, con el objetivo de garantizar la atención en salud de los maestros. Leal destacó que los contratos por evento y los contratos por capital son las áreas de mayor preocupación. “La Superintendencia inició una auditoría integral al interior de la Fiduprevisora para poder verificar que este tiempo de contaros por evento, están existiendo o con alteraciones para garantizar la atención en salud de la población&quot;, añadió Leal.

    "text": "A suspicious motorist who was allegedly switching seats with a passenger while driving on a Montreal highway was stopped with a loaded gun, provincial police say. The Sûreté du Québec (SQ) said patrol officers spotted the vehicle on Highway 15 south at around 4:30 a.m. Thursday. When they pulled over the 27-year-old male driver near Queen Mary Road he was not in his proper seat after officers had noticed he was \"switching places with the passenger while the vehicle was still in motion,\" the SQ said in a news release. He was arrested for breaching conditions and when they searched him they found the loaded weapon, which was later seized. Police said the suspect, who initially provided officers with a fake identity, could face several charges, including obstruction, identity theft, and possession of a restricted firearm. He also had a warrant out for his arrest when he was stopped. The suspect remains in custody pending a court appearance, where he could also face additional traffic violations, police said.

    "text": "US joins International Coalition for Return of Ukrainian Children USA joins coalition for safe return of Ukrainian children, unlawfully deported or handed over by Russia The US State Department [reported](https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-joins-the-international-coalition-for-the-return-of-ukrainian-children/) the information. The United States also confirms its support for the 'Joint Declaration on the Establishment of the International Coalition for the Return of Ukrainian Children,' previously issued by Canada and Ukraine. “We note the report of the UN Secretary-General “Children and Armed Conflict” A/77/895–S/2023/363, in which Russia’s armed forces and affiliated armed groups are included in the list of parties committing grave violations against children in armed conflict. We also note that the immediate release and return of all unlawfully detained, forcibly transferred and illegally deported civilians, including children, have been repeatedly emphasized in the documents of the United Nations, particularly in the UN General Assembly resolution A/RES/ES-11/6 “Principles of the Charter of the United Nations underlying a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine,” the text says. The United States has stated its common adherence to the following principles: - The high importance and priority of ensuring the best interests of a child, and the protection of children’s rights and freedoms, consistent with international law as applicable, in the context of the Russian Federation’s armed aggression; - International humanitarian law and human rights law must be respected in the context of the Russian Federation’s war of aggression against Ukraine, including by addressing the illegal deportation and forced transfer of Ukrainian children by the Russian Federation; - The importance of adherence to international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols thereto, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and Optional Protocols, among others, as applicable. Existing members of the International Coalition are engaged in supporting a just outcome of the situation of illegally deported and forcibly transferred Ukrainian children, including in the following ways: - Expressing support for the principles of point 4 of the Peace Formula of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Action Plan “Bring Kids Back UA”, as well as the continuation of the fruitful consultations of national security and foreign policy advisors that took place in Copenhagen, Jeddah, and Malta in the year 2023 and in Davos in January of 2024; - Exerting all possible efforts to return Ukrainian children, in accordance with international best practices, who have been illegally deported or forcibly transferred by the Russian Federation and supporting the process of their reintegration and reunification with families or placement in family-based care settings, consistent with the best interests of the child; - Facilitating the delivery of all necessary humanitarian, medical, and psychological assistance to children and their families affected by the illegal deportation and forced transfer by the Russian Federation, with the aim of their reintegration, and the restoration of their well-being, health, and welfare; - Supporting efforts to bring those responsible for organizing the illegal deportation and forcible transfer of Ukrainian children to justice consistent with international law. Deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia: what is known In the midst of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine's children are being mass deported from the occupied territories. They are being transported to the occupied Crimea, Russia, or Belarus under the pretext of health retreats or holiday camps. On May 13, 2023, during a briefing in Rome with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that over 19,300 children had been deported by the Russians. On May 29, during an informal meeting of the UN Security Council on Russia's abduction of children from the occupied territories of Ukraine, Ukrainian Human Rights Commissioner Dmytro Lubinets revealed that Russia deliberately changes legislation to prevent the return of Ukrainian children to their homeland, including forcibly changing their citizenship to Russian. Lubinets also noted that Russia provides no information about deported Ukrainian children - it's unknown even where they are located and under what conditions. On June 8, the U.S. Senate Committee [endorsed](https://www.holosameryky.com/a/rezolutsia-resolution-vykradennia-ditey-genitsyd-senat-kongres-golosuvannia-respublikantsi-demokraty/7128891.html) a resolution condemning Russia's abduction of Ukrainian children and labeling the actions of the occupiers as genocide. Later, evidence emerged implicating Belarus in the deportation of Ukrainian children. On June 27, the Belarusian opposition handed evidence of involvement in war crimes by the self-proclaimed leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, and his circle to the International Criminal Court. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called on UN countries to unite efforts and compel Russia to return Ukrainian children to their parents, taken against their will to Russia during the war in Ukraine. On July 29, the British Ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, stated that Russians are abducting Ukrainian children with the aim of eradicating the next generation of defenders of Ukraine. Around the same time, Russian Children's Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova claimed that since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, Russia has 'accepted' around 4.8 million residents of Ukraine, including over 700,000 children. On November 23, the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67488646) reported that Sergei Mironov, the leader of the political party 'A Just Russia,' had adopted a 10-month-old girl who was kidnapped from a children's home in Kherson region.

El motivo: la radiación ultravioleta (UV) es mayor que en otras estaciones del año y una exposición prolongada puede ser perjudicial. Al igual que la temperatura, la radiación no llega de la misma forma a lo largo del territorio nacional, pero tampoco en una misma ciudad. En Lima, hay distritos donde se presentan niveles más altos de radiación, mientras que, al mismo tiempo, estos son más bajos en otros, según los monitoreos del Senamhi. ¿Cuáles son estos lugares y por qué se dan estas diferencias? Durante el verano, la radiación ultravioleta es mayor que en otras estaciones. Foto: Andina Primero, ¿qué es la radiación UV? “El [Sol](https://larepublica.pe/ciencia/2024/01/12/confirmado-por-la-nasa-el-2023-fue-el-ano-mas-caluroso-jamas-registrado-729936) emite diferentes tipos de radiación a la superficie terrestre y la radiación ultravioleta es una parte de todas ellas”, explica el ingeniero Orlando Ccora, especialista en radiación UV del Servicio Nacional de Meteorología e Hidrología del Perú, en diálogo con La República. Las pequeñas cantidades de radiación UV son necesarias para la producción de vitamina D, que permite al cuerpo humano absorber el calcio necesario para el fortalecimiento de los huesos, según la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS). Pero, la exposición excesiva trae problemas a la salud y el riesgo de [cáncer](https://larepublica.pe/ciencia/2024/01/23/la-primera-vacuna-contra-el-cancer-de-piel-mas-agresivo-como-funciona-y-cuando-la-venderan-en-argentina-321402). Para medir la radiación UV, se utiliza la unidad watts por metro cuadrado. Pero, a nivel nacional se reconoce una escala de valores identificada con colores, que va de 1 a 20 y va de “baja” a “extremadamente alta”. Escala del Índice de radiación ultravioleta (IUV).

Otro factor que influye en una mayor recepción de rayos UV es la altitud. A mayor altura, se recibe mayor intensidad de radiación. “En la región andina, la radiación es mayor que en la costa”, precisa Ccora. Mientras tanto, estos valores son parecidos en la costa y en la selva. La cantidad de radiación UV también es condicionada por la concentración de ozono. Si hay poca presencia de este gas, que usualmente suele ocurrir en lugares con mayor altura, hay mayor radiación. ¿Cuáles son los distritos de Lima que reciben más radiación? “Las condiciones meteorológicas de cada distrito inciden en la cantidad de radiación ultravioleta que reciben y esto es muy cambiante”, indica Ccora. Los cielos despejados o nublados pueden incidir en la medición. Por otro lado, pese a ser una región costera, la superficie varía y también influye. “La altura de los distritos cerca al mar es generalmente plana. Pero, por ejemplo, yendo hacia Chosica, va subiendo, aunque no se siente”, detalla. Si bien depende de las condiciones variables, el Senamhi sí ha identificado cuáles son los distritos que reciben mayor radiación y son los ubicados al este y al norte de la capital del Perú. Vitarte, Cieneguilla, Pachacámac, Ancón y Carabayllo son algunos de los distritos que reciben más radiación en Lima. Periodista en la sección Ciencia de La República.

    "title": "Galápagos del Norte, el nuevo modelo de conservación que atrae las miradas de todo el mundo",
    "text": "L a belleza y biodiversidad de sus aguas le han valido el sobrenombre de las “Galápagos del Norte”. Esta región del Pacífico en el oeste de Canadá, también conocida como el Gran Mar del Oso, sueña ahora con servir de modelo para otras áreas marinas protegidas en el mundo.\nTras años de consultas populares, esta zona de unos 133,000 kilómetros cuadrados (más que el tamaño de Nicaragua) y ubicada a 150 kilómetros de la costa de la isla de Vancouver, se convirtió en julio en el área marina protegida (MPA, por su sigla en inglés) más grande del país . Y en un alivio a las poblaciones indígenas locales.\nCon la medida, ahora Canadá busca ser pionero en un nuevo modelo de protección integral de las poblaciones marinas contra actividades nocivas en una gran extensión del océano. Pero detrás del paisaje de ensueño de esta región, la realidad es más sombría: la contaminación, la pesca industrial y el cambio climático ya han alterado el ecosistema.\nLos científicos calculan, por ejemplo, que la ola de calor que azotó la Columbia Británica en 2021 acabó con 1,000 millones de organismos marinos intermareales (especies que viven en el espacio costero que queda al descubierto cuando baja la marea).\nSalmones, ballenas, osos, lobos, así como bosques de algas y cedros milenarios…en total, la reserva marina alberga más de 64 especies de peces, 70 de aves marinas, 30 de mamíferos marinos y 52 de invertebrados como moluscos, erizos de mar y pulpos, entre otras especies.\n“Este es uno de los ecosistemas más ricos y productivos del mundo”, afirma Christine Smith-Martin, directora de la organización que agrupa a las primeras naciones que se asentaron en la costa oeste de América del Norte.\nEl acuerdo para conservar esta vasta zona firmado por una quincena de Primeras Naciones de la costa del Pacífico, el Gobierno canadiense y el de la provincia de Columbia Británica, es un reconocimiento del delicado equilibrio entre la conservación de los ecosistemas y las necesidades de los pueblos indígenas.\nGALÁPAGOS DEL NORTE, UN LOGRO DE CANADÁ “Recientemente, ha habido años en los que hemos tenido que cerrar la pesca a nuestra propia gente”, apunta Danielle Shaw, indígena líder de la nación wuikinuxv, una de las comunidades autóctonas de la región.\nLa pesca es fundamental para muchos de estos pueblos que “no han podido llenar sus estanterías y congeladores para el invierno”, añade. Los pobladores de estas zonas remotas “cuentan con el territorio para alimentarse todo el año”.\n“La esperanza es que, a largo plazo, un ecosistema más fuerte signifique más alimento para los humanos y una economía más fuerte”, explica Shaw.\nPero también es una meta para Canadá, el país con más costa del mundo, que busca llegar a declarar zona protegida 30 por ciento de sus tierras y aguas oceánicas de aquí a 2030.\nEste ambicioso compromiso, asumido a finales de 2022 por los países participantes en la COP15 , en Montreal, será motivo de debates de seguimiento en la Convención de Naciones Unidas sobre la diversidad biológica que comienza el 21 octubre en Cali, Colombia.\nSegún biólogos marinos, las zonas protegidas son claves para ayudar a las especies a restablecerse, pero también para permitirles mejorar su diversidad genética, una forma esencial de adaptarse al cambio climático. Los expertos también creen que esta inmensa área del oeste canadiense que funciona como una red de zonas protegidas se beneficiará de múltiples ventajas acumulativas.\nEn esta área marina protegida, ahora están prohibidas las actividades petroleras y gasíferas, la explotación minera y la pesca de arrastre o de draga, que arruina los corales y los fondos marinos.\n“EL ÁREA MARINA ES UN GRAN AVANCE Y POR ESO SOY OPTIMISTA” Sin embargo, le aguardan grandes retos al ver cómo se intensifica el tráfico marítimo, con los puertos del norte cada vez más solicitados para la exportación de aglomerados de madera, y que pronto verán aumentar los envíos de gas natural licuado.\n“Es deplorable ver a qué punto la degradación de nuestro medioambiente ha sido brutal”, señala Bo Owaldi, una joven de la comunidad wuikinuxv y guardiana de la zona.\nConsiderados como los “ojos y oídos” del mar, estos vigilantes han sido comprometidos por sus naciones para actuar como protectores, administradores y guardianes del océano. “El área marina es un gran avance y por eso soy optimista”, agrega.\nGalápagos del Norte.

    "title": "A slim majority of Mavericks fans ‘expect’ Luka Doncic to win Most Valuable Player - Mavs Moneyball",
    "text": "Earlier this week, we had a poll of three questions to [Dallas Mavericks](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com) fans about the season at hand. I chose to focus the polling wording on expectations. As we all know, expectation is the thief of joy, but looking for what fans are thinking and expecting is important as Mavs Moneyball covers the Dallas Mavericks. The first question focused on where fans expected Luka Doncic to finish in this year’s MVP race. A slight majority EXPECT Luka Doncic to win the Most Valuable Player award. I’m pretty fascinated to determine why. While we here at Mavs Moneyball know he’s among the best players in the NBA, the MVP is a narrative award as much as anything and voters may well hold last season’s tank job against Doncic, even though we know he fought the idea. He’s been on the outside of the conversation the entire year, so that most people EXPECT him to win it is just so very interesting to me. I certainly hope everyone is right, him winning MVP would be awesome. The next question I asked had to do with the center rotation. It was straight forward: who do you want to start at center? This was asked in light of new center Daniel Gafford exploding on to the scene with Derrick Lively II hurt. But a solid majority still prefer Lively to start. It’s great to have the option off the bench in Gafford though. The sickos who asked for Dwight Powell or Maxi Kleber to start, I have more questions. Firstly, why are you the way that you are? The last question was centered around Tim Hardaway: Do you expect Tim Hardaway to work his way out of the rotation? This is a dead split and I rather love it. Hardaway Jr. gets fans so, SO fired up. I think he’ll linger in the lineups for a while. His shooting is enticing even if his defensive play leaves so much to be desired. We’ll see what’s next! Until next week!

It is not widely disputed that the founders wanted separation of church and state, but there is little dispute that America, for many years, has adopted a pseudo-theocratic stance; Congress begins every session with a prayer, and one swears a promise of truth on a religious book of doctrine in court. I was reminded of this Wednesday when an Alabama court declared a petri dish a womb. They further ruled that anyone disturbing the dish is guilty of wrongful death. Reasonable people can disagree, but the disturbing part of the ruling was the words of Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom Parker (his real name), who wrote, “Human life cannot be wrongfully destroyed without incurring the wrath of a holy God,” in his concurring opinion that invoked the Book of Genesis. The conservative members of the Supreme Court—via Justice Samuel Alito—stuck their gavels in the air, gauging the judicial wind, and then leaked their ruling a month before overturning 50 years of precedent in the Roe v. Wade case. Justice Clarence Thomas also tested the climate of change. Under cover of Roe, Thomas wrote in his concurring opinion that the justices “should reconsider” all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell” — referring to three cases having to do with contraception, same-sex relationships, and marriage essentially overturning fundamental privacy, due process, and equal protection rights. Unsurprisingly, after this takeover of family and women’s rights in America, Republicans face- planted over the backlash. For the first time in American jurisprudence, the High Court reversed a right to equal protection, and this astounded Republicans, women particularly, fought back and fought back hard. Hoping to duck and cover behind red states, voters in Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, and Ohio overwhelmingly turned away initiatives to further restrict a woman’s right to choose. Even in Virginia, where rising GOP star Governor Glen Youngkin tried to thread the needle with an adjustment from a 6-week to a 15-week abortion ban, it was roundly rejected. America has rediscovered Maya Angelou and her brilliant but simplistic observation: “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.” The translucent religiosity of the religious right on the Court would have women stay married, stay quiet, and incubate—no matter what. Today, the conservatives added another color to their rancid rainbow: the proposed ban on no-fault divorce. So not only would women and families be forced to procreate, but they must not take any steps to control the size of their families with birth control and stay in a union that may be toxic, violent, and dangerous, maybe until death parts them. All hope abandon, ye who enter here is supposedly the inscription on the gates of hell but perhaps it will be the new inscription on the entrance of the Supreme Court. Vote Against Guns",
