    "title": "Gut microbe imbalances may predict autism and ADHD risk years before symptoms appear",
    "text": "Early screening for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism is important to ensure children have the support they need to gain the essential skills for daily life. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children be screened for developmental delays, with additional screening for those who are preterm or have a low birth weight.\nHowever, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has called for more research into the effectiveness of current autism screening practices. Primarily based on milestone checklists and symptoms, autism diagnoses also currently rely on observations of behavior that often manifests after crucial developmental stages have passed.\nResearchers and clinicians are working to develop simple, reliable tools that could identify early signs or risk factors of a condition before symptoms are obvious. While early screening can lead to the risk of overdiagnosis, understanding a child’s developmental needs can help guide families toward resources that address those needs sooner.\nWe are researchers who study the role the microbiome plays in a variety of conditions, such as mental illness, autoimmunity, obesity, preterm birth and others. In our recently published research on Swedish children, we found that microbes and the metabolites they produce in the guts of infants – both found in poop and cord blood – could help screen for a child’s risk of neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism. And these differences can be detected as early as birth or within the first year of life. These markers were evident, on average, over a decade before the children were diagnosed.\nMicrobes as biomarkers\nBiomarkers are biological indicators – such as genes, proteins or metabolites in blood, stool or other types of samples – that signal the presence of a condition at a certain point in time. There are no known biomarkers for autism. Efforts to find biomarkers have been largely hindered by the fact that autism has many potential pathways that lead to it, and researchers tend to ignore how these causes may work together as a whole.\nOne potential biomarker for neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism are gut microbes. The connection between the gut and brain, or the gut-brain axis, is an area of considerable interest among scientists. Gut microbes play significant roles in health, including in immunity, neurotransmitter balance, digestive health and much more.\nA lot of work has been done around mapping what a “typical” microbiome looks like based on age and organ system. Researchers have shown that the microbiome is personalized enough that it can distinguish two people or two households even better than genetics, with differences in colonization starting very early in life.\nThe microbiome undergoes immense changes during childhood. It shapes and is shaped by the immune system and influenced by life changes and events. It is also influenced by factors like genetics, environment, lifestyle, infection and medications.\nGastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, pain and constipation are common in children with autism and ADHD, with as many as 30% to 70% of autism patients also diagnosed with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Untreated GI issues can also lead to additional sleep and behavioral disorders among these children. A small pilot study found that children with autism showed improvements in gastrointestinal and autism-related symptoms after having healthy microbes transferred into their guts, with some benefits lasting up to two years.\nMost studies on the microbiome and neurodevelopmental conditions, however, are restricted to people who are already diagnosed with ADHD, autism or other conditions, and these studies often show mixed results. These limitations raise an important question: Does the microbiome play a direct role in the development of autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions, or are changes in microbiome composition a consequence of the conditions themselves?\nSome investigations have proposed that the microbiome has little or no association with future autism. However, these studies have a notable limitation: They don’t examine microbial imbalances prior to diagnosis or symptom onset. Instead, these studies focus on children already diagnosed with autism, comparing them to their siblings and unrelated neurotypical children. In most cases, dietary data and samples are collected several years after diagnosis, meaning the study cannot test for whether microbial imbalances cause autism.\nMicrobes matter\nWe wondered whether studying the bacteria residing in small children before they are diagnosed or show symptoms of autism or other conditions could give us a clue into their neurodevelopment. So, we examined the cord blood and stool collected at approximately 1 year of age from participants of an ongoing study called All Babies in Southeast Sweden, which follows the health of approximately 17,000 children born between 1997 and 1999 and their parents. We have followed these children since birth, nearly 1,200 of whom were later diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder by age 23.\nWe found significant differences in bacterial composition and metabolite levels that developed before symptoms of neurodevelopmental conditions – such as gastrointestinal upset, crankiness and sleep problems – as well as formal medical diagnoses. These differences spanned many conditions, including autism, ADHD and speech disorders.\nNext, we linked bacteria to neurotransmitters – chemical signals that help brain cells communicate – and vitamins such as riboflavin and vitamin B in the child’s stool. Given previous research on children and adults already diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder, we expected to find differences in the microbiome composition and health between those with and without neurodevelopmental conditions.\nBut we were surprised to discover just how early these differences emerge. We saw variability in the microbes and metabolites that affect immune and brain health, among others, in the stool collected from the diapers of children around 1 year of age and in umbilical cord blood collected at birth.\nThe imbalance in microbial composition – what microbiologists call dysbiosis – we observed suggests that incomplete recovery from repeated antibiotic use may greatly affect children during this vulnerable period. Similarly, we saw that repeated ear infections were linked to a twofold increased likelihood of developing autism.\nChildren who both repeatedly used antibiotics and had microbial imbalances were significantly more likely to develop autism. More specifically, children with an absence of Coprococcus comes, a bacterium linked to mental health and quality of life, and increased prevalence of Citrobacter, a bacterium known for antimicrobial resistance, along with repeated antibiotic use were two to four times more likely to develop a neurodevelopmental disorder.\nAntibiotics are necessary for treating certain bacterial infections in children, and we emphasize that our findings do not suggest avoiding their use altogether. Parents should use antibiotics if they are prescribed and deemed necessary by their pediatrician. Rather, our study suggests that repeated antibiotic use during early childhood may signal underlying immune dysfunction or disrupted brain development, which can be influenced by the gut microbiome. In any case, it is important to consider whether children could benefit from treatments to restore their gut microbes after taking antibiotics, an area we are actively studying.\nAnother microbial imbalance in children who later were diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders was a decrease in Akkermansia muciniphila, a bacterium that reinforces the lining of the gut and is linked to neurotransmitters important to neurological health.\nEven after we accounted for factors that could influence gut microbe composition, such as how the baby was delivered and breastfeeding, the relationship between imbalanced bacteria and future diagnosis persisted. And these imbalances preceded diagnosis of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability by 13 to 14 years on average, refuting the assumption that gut microbe imbalances arise from diet.\nWe found that lipids and bile acids were depleted in the cord blood of newborns with future autism. These compounds provide nutrients for beneficial bacteria, help maintain immune balance and influence neurotransmitter systems and signaling pathways in the brain.\nMicrobiome screening at well-child visits\nMicrobiome screening is not a common practice in well-child visits. But our findings suggest that detecting imbalances in beneficial and harmful bacteria, especially during critical periods of early childhood development, can provide essential insights for clinicians and families.\nThere is a long way to go before such screening becomes a standard part of pediatric care. Researchers still need validated methods to analyze and interpret microbiome data in the clinic. It’s also unclear how bacterial differences change across time in children around the world – not just which bacteria are present or absent, but also how they may be shaping immune responses and metabolism. But our findings reaffirm the growing body of evidence that the early gut microbiome plays a key role in shaping neurodevelopment.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

    "text": "“L’amore per la vita in tutte le sue espressioni è più forte delle minacce di morte che sembrano talvolta prevalere ed è un bel segno concreto di speranza e di contributo alla pace. Le stesse comunità cristiane, messe alla prova di fronte a cambiamenti epocali profondi, sono chiamate a rinnovare la disponibilità a mettersi a servizio del Regno di Dio”. Lo ha scritto il vescovo di Forlì-Bertinoro, mons. Livio Corazza, nell’editoriale “Il duello tra morte e vita” pubblicato sull’ultimo numero del settimanale diocesano “Il Momento”. Il presule apre la sua riflessione riproponendo due appelli: “L’Europa si deve preparare alla guerra” dall’Alto Rappresentante Ue, Josep Borrell, e “Possiamo ancora accettare che solo la guerra sia la soluzione dei contrasti? Ripudiarla non significa arrestarne la progressione o dobbiamo aspettare l’irreparabile per capire e scegliere?” del card. Matteo Maria Zuppi, all’inizio del Consiglio permanente della Cei. “Due appelli – commenta mons. Corazza – che segnalano il momento drammatico che stiamo vivendo”. “La ‘Settimana santa’ – osserva il vescovo – non si conclude con la vittoria della morte ma della vita, non solo di Cristo. Gesù sulla croce sembra sconfitto e, invece, rifiorirà il suo corpo e il corpo di tutti coloro che condividevano il suo Vangelo. I cristiani non possono arrendersi di fronte ai messaggi di morte. Il duello continua, ma è un duello che si può vincere già qui e ora”. Per mons. Corazza, “fatti di risurrezione, nella nostra comunità forlivese, ringraziando Dio, ci sono. Sono semi concreti e veri di speranza che favoriscono il dialogo fra culture, confessioni cristiane, religioni e nazionalità diverse”. “Alle tante emergenze di questi anni, la società civile ed ecclesiale – riconosce il vescovo – ha risposto con grande impegno e prontezza, in coerenza con una storia di accoglienza delle persone fragili che caratterizza il nostro territorio”. “Siamo consapevoli che – conclude mons. Corazza – nel Vangelo c’è la chiave per aprire le porte dei cuori alla pace. Una via non facile, ma che termina davanti ad un sepolcro vuoto e non sul calvario! Cristo è risorto, è veramente Risorto! Buona Pasqua”. Pasqua: mons. Corazza (Forlì), “l’amore per la vita è più forte delle minacce di morte che sembrano prevalere, è segno concreto di speranza e di contributo alla pace” “L’amore per la vita in tutte le sue espressioni è più forte delle minacce di morte che sembrano talvolta prevalere ed è un bel segno concreto di speranza e di contributo alla pace.

    "title": "The Color Or The Fruit: Which Word \"Orange\" Came First? | IFLScience",
    "text": "What came first, oranges – the plump citrus fruit – or orange – the name of the juicy red-yellow color? Perhaps surprisingly, the fruit came first. The first time the word “orange” was documented in the English language was around the late 14th century CE, when it was used to refer to the fruit, according to the [Online Etymology Dictionary](https://www.etymonline.com/word/orange). It was not until over a century later that “orange” was used to describe a color. The word entered Middle English from Old French and Anglo-Norman “orenge.” However, it’s also apparent that the word has some clear phonic similarities to the Spanish and Portuguese names for the fruit, “naranja\" and \"laranja\", which are linked back to Sanskrit, Persian, and Arabic words for the fruit tree. A bunch of other languages use the same word for the color orange and the fruit, including French, German, and Hungarian. However, plenty of languages [have separate words](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/orange). For instance, in Scandinavian languages like Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian, the fruit is called “apelsin” or “appelsin”, which means something like \"Chinese apple\". Meanwhile, they describe the color as \"orange\" or \"oransje\". As you can see, many European languages have a word for the fruit that links back to the [geographic origin of oranges,](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/3209219/oranges-origins-how-it-travelled-east-west-and-its-name-evolved) among the southeast foothills of the Himalayas in a region that encompasses part of India, northern Myanmar, and China. Around the time the word emerged in Europe, the fruit was starting to be brought over from Asia by traders and appearing in local markets. Before the introduction of this word, [it’s likely](https://www.etymologynerd.com/blog/orange-oranges) that speakers of Middle English would have referred to the color as geolurēad, literally yellow-red. You might be wondering, why didn’t English speakers name the color “orange” after another fruit or vegetable, like pumpkins or carrots? Well, pumpkins weren’t introduced to Europe until the colonization of the Americas by Christopher Columbus in 1492, while carrots weren’t widely orange-colored [until the 16th century](https://www.iflscience.com/carrot-genome-may-explain-how-vegetable-got-its-orange-hue-35621) (before selective breeding, they were pale and white like parsnips). It seems that medieval Europe would be a very un-orangey place. Let’s not even get into how the ancient Greeks [didn’t have a word for blue](https://www.iflscience.com/did-ancient-people-really-not-see-the-color-blue-51837) and described the sky as the color of “copper\".",

    "text": "Digitalising real wardrobes to share with friends Whering Social is about personalising sustainable fashion by giving consumers a smart stylist.\nEve Thomas July 3, Focused On Personalisation And Sustainability, The Whering App Allows Users To Share Their Wardrobes With Friends, And “shop” Their Own Outfits. Credit: Whering. Designed to enable a sustainable and circular journey, Whering is allowing its 4m users to “shop their own wardrobe” by offering a digitalised version of the real thing. It’s somewhat reminiscent of Clueless, but with AI insights, personal statistics, moodboards, wishlists and – as of this week – a social element.\nThe app recently launched its new iteration – Whering Social, which CEO and self-proclaimed “recovering hypocrite” Bianca Rangecroft hopes will “build out” a rapidly growing community.\nGo deeper with GlobalData Reports Innovation in Internet of Things: Sensor-integrated wearables GlobalData Reports AWM Smart Shelf - Tech Innovator Profile GlobalData\nPremium Insights The gold standard of business intelligence.\nFind out more\nUsers can browse each other’s wardrobes, submit style suggestions, view moodboards and wishlists, and compete on leaderboards. It’s all part of Whering’s vision, in which sustainability meets personalisation.\nA personalised tech stylist Personalised style has long been a staple of apparel’s offerings, and brands able to offer products that match customers’ personal preferences see conversions and retention. The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new doors for personalised fashion, offering analysis of purchasing habits and – in Whering’s case – wardrobe preferences.\nRangecroft explains AI’s role in Whering is to use “manual user input to calculate what a user is wearing every day, how they are styling themselves, what pieces are most worn, what their cost per wear is.”\nIt’s been popular, and she adds that “users want that to become fully personalised, so they want the AI to say: ‘here is your plan of attack, this is what you are going to be working with in the next couple of weeks, we want you to be wearing this and that because we know that these are low utilisation items.’ Our AI is going to be saying, ‘these things are currently trending for X amount on resale, you should resell them, give them a new life, you’re not wearing them’. Personalisation here sort of comes in the form of almost like a smart stylist, almost like a banking app that tells you how you are spending money here or there.”\n “We can absolutely say for certain that Gen Z and our millennial audience are starved for inspiration. They want to see different outfit combinations at the click of a button. They want personalised outfits for specific occasions and specific moods or destinations. So, from an R&D perspective we’re focusing on training our styling algorithm and personalisation capabilities in the app to be able to do that.”\nAside from inspiring, informing and nudging users, the app also offers a statistical breakdown of personal habits. Users can see how many items are in their wardrobe, what percentage of these they wear, what they have worn frequently, what their wardrobe costs, what they regularly pair, and which items they are neglecting.\nIt speaks to sustainable practices too, as Whering users can see what percentage of their wardrobe is new, preloved, rental and handmade. “It’s just a really nice snapshot of who you are as a person,” says Rangecroft.\nThis breakdown has been popular with users, and it’s the area Whering has put most R&D into, “because it is for that smart, savvy consumer that wants to know more about where they are spending their money, and they want to put their money where their mouth is.”\nThese insights marry Whering’s two key principles: personalisation and sustainability. Earth.org reports that 92m tonnes of textiles waste is produced every year, with much of the problem coming from the ‘throwaway’ culture cultivated by fast fashion brands. The change in consumer behaviour has resulted in the number of wears per garment declining around 36% since 2008.\n“That is the big vision: to start thinking about the whole user journey, and the whole lifecycle from pre-purchase to purchase, then increasing utilisation,” she shares.\n“For me, that is the holy trifecta, and I think when Whering is able to productise its existing tech to serve the pre-purchase and the purchase touch points from a retailer perspective, that’s when we will start to unlock huge value for the personalisation angle.”\nShe talks also about Whering’s “gamification” of sustainable wardrobes through technological solutions. Just as Cher Horowitz shuffled her outfits in Clueless in 1995, so users can discover inspiration in their own wardrobes.\n“I have got a quite a large wardrobe. When I started Whering, I think my utilisation was around 34%. It’s now at 71%. Using the styling functionalities, I make all of these different outfits and wear a lot more of what I own, rather than just gravitating towards the typical things that you always pull out.”\nThe gamification goes beyond a mix-and-match style approach, however. With the launch of Whering Social, the app is taking a new path, and merging the circular solution with the sharing economy.\n“It’s about gamification, and how we can use leaderboards and challenges with your friends, in order to educate around sustainability, but also to motivate users to look at their wardrobe insights, and start to bring some fun competition,” explains Rangecroft.\nWhering Social allows friends to style outfits for each other and to view wardrobes, wishlists and moodboards. Credit: Whering. A social wardrobe The new iteration of Whering is focused on making its current offerings sociable, and bringing a community element to sustainable, personalised fashion through open wardrobes, wishlists and moodboards.\nRangecroft explains: “The genesis is really to democratise access to people’s wardrobes, similarly to the day-to-day angle and our approach at the beginning of the product, which was about helping users shop their own wardrobes to find what they have and make the most of it through a digital inventory.\n“Now it’s translating that into being able to go into friends’ wardrobes, to change users’ relationship with consumption, but also to offer the ability to style friends, and derive pleasure from that, and excitement and emotional connection with clothes.”\nThe role of social media in the apparel sector has ballooned in recent years. The RetailX Global Fashion 2023 report found that 52.4% of global fashion eshoppers used Instagram, 51.6% used Facebook, 41.2% used YouTube and 28.1% used TikTok.\nFrom ‘outfit of the day’ and ‘what I would wear to…’ trends, to Pinterest boards and fashion pages, consumers have built communities dedicated to discussing apparel and Rangecroft recognises potential in this.\n“People are chatting about what they are wearing to a specific event: what are they packing? What are their inspirations for an upcoming dinner party? We want to bring all of that back into the Whering app. It’s all about leveraging social in order to create a much more intimate community.\n“We want interoperability with your top five apps, like WhatsApp, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. The social focus is really to make sure that you can use those apps and bring content into Whering, but also that we’re the home for most of the discussions and Direct Messages (DMs), around fashion and around consumption.”\nShe also notes the potential of the social iteration to further enhance Whering’s sustainability objectives.\nAlthough not apparel-specific, Unilever conducted its own study to assess the impact of social media on sustainable living, and found that 83% of the 6,000 participants thought TikTok and Instagram were good places to get advice on sustainable living, and 78% believed that social media was the platform most likely to encourage them to act more sustainably, above TV documentaries (48%), news articles (37%) and government campaigns (20%).\nWhering hopes to supercharge this in the apparel sector. “What are your friends doing? How are they buying better? What are they making by hand? What are they reselling? All of that is a really good way to bring people into your journey and bring them along with you,” explains Rangecroft. “We really like that angle: it’s not only about fostering engagement and retention in the app, but it’s also about education, to make our community the next generation of more sustainable users.”\n“The social leaderboard challenges, and viewing what consumers’ friends are doing, are really good ways to push a sustainability agenda, because it means that users are able to see what other people are doing. It’s like when you go to someone’s house, and you go into the kitchen to wash your hands, and you can see what kind of products they have. Are they on an eco friendly journey? Are they not? It’s a sort of similar thing here, and it can be very motivating to see friends do better.”\nEnjoying conscious consumerism Above all, Rangecroft is eager to express that Whering’s sustainability message is intertwined through the colourful and gamified experience which comes from consumers’ shopping their own clothes. However, she also notes that Whering’s unique insights into the habits and wardrobes of its users translates into huge potential for businesses ready to embrace sustainable apparel.\n“I suppose for me, the big insight here is how environmentally damaging returns are. It is such a huge issue. It is just absolutely incredible that we still operate in this system, without smart analytics and without a personal stylist in the pocket. We are trawling websites for hours and hours to buy things that we don’t need.\n“We need to leverage the unprecedented data segment that we have built through Whering, which is an AI into people’s wardrobes, into what they are really wearing, and what they’re doing with the brands and the items that they’re buying, to be able to productise that into a real time solution that we can implement with retailers to start to tackle that side of fashion waste, because it is huge.”\nSign up for our daily news round-up!

Malas para aquellos aficionados a la Semana Santa, que han aguardado durante todo el año, y que podrían ver afectada al menos una jornada de la sacra celebración en la provincia almeriense. Esto se debe a que la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología, Aemet ha pronosticado la posibilidad de lluvia para el Domingo de Ramos, así como el Lunes, el Martes y el Miércoles Santo en determinados puntos de Almería.\nDe este modo, en la capital almeriense, a partir del mediodía del domingo, habrá un 55% de probabilidad de precipitaciones. El lunes, la lluvia estará prácticamente asegurada con un 95% de previsión, mientras que, actualmente, hay un 80% de probabilidad de lluvia el martes 26 de marzo.\nEn el Poniente almeriense, tomando El Ejido como referencia, lloverá sí o sí el Lunes Santo, con un 100 % de previsión de lluvia para ese día. El martes se sitúa en un 80 %, mientras que el miércoles también podría llover con un 60 % probabilidad.\nViajando al interior, en Cuevas del Almanzora también se prevé un 100 % el lunes, aunque el martes hay menos posibilidades, con un 70 %.\nPasado por agua será también el Lunes Santo en Vélez Rubio, con un 100 % de lluvia para Aemet. El martes, habrá un 85 %, y el miércoles puede que caigan cotas, con un 55 % de probabilidad.\nEn el Levante, en Huércal-Overa, se espera el mismo lunes que en toda la provincia, lluvioso, con un 100 % de probabilidad. El martes podría no llover, aunque hay un 65 % actualmente de previsión. En la costa, en Garrucha, ya desde el Domingo de Ramos por la tarde, hay un 55 % de probabilidad. El lunes, un 95 % y el martes, un 75 %.\nPor último, en Níjar solo se esperan dos días de lluvia: el lunes, con un 95 %, y el martes, con un 80 % de posibilidades.\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nTe puede interesar\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nTe puede interesar\n<a href=\"https://www.ideal.es/culturas/gastronomia/listado-restaurantes-estrella-michelin-provincias-20231128222445-ntrc.html\">\nEl mapa de los restaurantes con estrella Michelin por provincias\n</a>\nSara I.
