    "title": "Nicaragua arrests two high-ranking Catholic priests with close ties to cardinal | The Star",
    "text": "SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Nicaraguan police detained on Thursday two senior Catholic priests who are close to the country's top church leader, a person with knowledge of the matter said, raising to at least six the number of clergymen detained this week.\nThe source, who declined to be named for fear of arrest, said the two priests were detained for publicly praying for jailed Bishop Rolando Alvarez, the most prominent critic of President Daniel Ortega.\nLocal media outlet Confidencial named the priests as Carlos Aviles and Hector Treminio, and noted that their arrest brings to at least six the number of priests detained over the past week, adding that two of the clerics had already been released.\nThe government's press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOver the past few years, Ortega's government has targeted members of the Catholic church, a crackdown officials have in the past said was needed to punish treasonous behavior or other alleged crimes.\nAviles is the second-highest ranking cleric in the Archdiocese of Managua, led by Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes, while Treminio is its treasurer.\nAlvarez, the bishop of Matagalpa, forcefully criticized the government's deadly response to mass protests that broke out in 2018, and was convicted of treason and sentenced to a 26-year prison term earlier this year.\nLast week, police arrested Bishop Isidro Mora of the Siuna diocese, making him the second bishop to be detained after Alvarez's detention in 2022.\nMany of the latest clergymen detained were arrested because they publicly offered prayers for Alvarez, according to the source and local media, but the government has not issued any statements explaining the priests' alleged crimes.\nNicaraguan Bishop Silvio Baez, who has been living in exile in Florida since 2019 and is the second-ranking leader of the archdiocese, called for the priests to be released.\n\"I ask God to protect them and that they be freed immediately!\" wrote in a post on X on Thursday.\nAccording to exiled Nicaraguan researcher Martha Patricia Molina, who publishes records of what she describes as the persecution of the Catholic Church under Ortega, the number of bishops, priests and seminarians behind bars in the country currently stands at nine.\n(Reporting by Ismael Lopez; Writing by David Alire Garcia and Miral Fahmy)\nOpen Modal ×",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Ocean County, New Jersey from 1901-2000 was 34.6. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Ocean County, New Jersey experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Ocean County, New Jersey history.",

    "text": "First look: Universal Orlando's new Stella Nova Resort is 'out of this world'\nUniversal Stella Nova Resort\nadvertising policyand\nproduct review methodologyfor more information.\nEditor's Note\n- Universal Stella Nova Resort is the first of three new hotels opening at Universal Orlando this year.\n- All three are located near the all-new Universal Epic Universe, which opens in May 2025.\n- Stella Nova has 750 guest rooms and an affordable $147 starting price.\nIt's no secret that 2025 is going to be an \"epic\" year for Universal Orlando Resort. The resort's third park, Universal Epic Universe, is scheduled to open on May 22. But you don't have to wait until then to explore some of the park's other exciting new developments.\nIn addition to Epic Universe, Universal is opening three new hotels and adding 2,000 guest rooms to its portfolio this year. The first of these, Universal Stella Nova Resort, opened on Jan. 21, 2025, and TPG was among the first to stay at this galactically cool property.\nThe hotel's design is inspired by the vast and beautiful wonders of outer space, which you can see reflected throughout the property starting with the exterior. The facade of the hotel is covered by more than 140,000 colorful dichroic tiles that change color based on the lighting and time of day. When I arrived around midday, they were shimmering in an entire rainbow of hues, but in the evening they take on darker blues and purples.\nUpon entering the lobby, you'll see space-themed artwork inspired by NASA photographs. The cosmic aura continues through to the nebulalike purple, blue and white color scheme and the spaceport windows in the guest rooms.\nHere's a first look at Universal Stella Nova Resort, including cost, amenities, dining and theme park perks.\nWhat does it cost to stay at Stella Nova Resort?\nStella Nova Resort is part of Universal's Prime Value lodging category (Universal Aventura Hotel and the soon-to-open Universal Terra Luna Resort also belong to this collection).\nPrices start at $147 per night (plus tax), but this price is only available for stays of four nights or longer. On average, we found pricing to be closer to $200 to $230 per night for a one-night stay. Every room at Stella Nova is a standard two-queen room, so the only price difference you will find is if you choose a pool-view room over a standard view. You'll pay between $10 and $20 more for a pool view.\nThe parking cost for overnight guests is $30 plus tax per vehicle per night.\nStella Nova Resort is bookable via the Capital One Travel portal. Eligible Capital One cardholders can book this resort via Capital One Travel and pay in cash with their Capital One card or redeem Capital One miles. When you pay using your card, you can earn up to 10 miles per dollar spent, depending on the Capital One card you carry.\nAmong the Capital One cards you should consider using if booking this way are:\nCapital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card: Earn 10 miles per dollar on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Capital One Venture X Business: Earn 10 miles per dollar on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card: Earn 5 miles per dollar on hotels, vacation rentals and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card: Earn 5 miles per dollar on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card: Earn 5% cash back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card: Earn 5% cash back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Capital One Spark Cash Plus: Earn 5% cash back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Capital One Spark Miles for Business: Earn 5 miles per dollar on hotels, vacation rentals and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.\nStella Nova Resort location\nStella Nova, along with Universal's other two upcoming hotels, is located adjacent to Epic Universe. Epic Universe itself is about three miles from the rest of Universal Orlando, but there is a complimentary shuttle service between the new park (and its hotels) and the rest of Universal Orlando Resort. From Stella Nova, it is about a 12-minute bus ride to Universal Orlando's main security area that leads to Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure and CityWalk (bus transfer is available to Volcano Bay water park).\nFrom Orlando International Airport (MCO), it's about a 20-minute drive to Stella Nova Resort. Universal does offer a paid shuttle service called the SuperstarStar Shuttle, but ride-hailing services and rental cars are also readily available.\nInside Stella Nova Resort guest rooms\nAll 750 rooms at Stella Nova Resort are double queen rooms that sleep up to four guests, so the layouts are similar in every guest room, though you can choose from standard-view and pool-view categories. ADA-compliant rooms are available. A standard-view room looks over the back of Epic Universe. You can see portions of the park peeking out, which builds the excitement for your vacation.\nInside the rooms, the color scheme is similar to that of the hotel's public areas, with space-inspired art. A few fun details, like a galactic mural behind the beds, Creamsicle-colored accent pillows and sleek, curved furnishings add to the futuristic feel.\nThe beds are soft and comfortable, with a thin coverlet that isn't necessarily a bad thing when you consider the typical outside temperatures in Orlando. I also appreciated that there was a QR code on the TV that I could scan to use my phone as a remote control (there is a standard remote, as well).\nSimilar to many other Universal Orlando hotels, the bathroom is split-style, with a sink and vanity in the center and a door that separates it from the toilet and tub. This not only allows for privacy but also makes it easier for multiple guests to get ready simultaneously.\nThe specialty Cosmic Ember bath products had a fresh scent, and I loved the continuity of the branding even for the shampoo, conditioner and soap.\nGuest rooms are also equipped with standard amenities like a coffee and tea maker, mini refrigerator, hair dryer and iron. Standard Wi-Fi is complimentary, or you can upgrade to premium Wi-Fi for $9.95 per day.\nStella Nova Resort amenities\nStella Nova offers similar amenities to Universal's other Prime Value properties. It has a resort-style pool complex with a 10,000-square-foot pool, a hot tub, a kid's splash pad and lawn games like hula hoops and table tennis. The resort shows poolside movies on select nights (check at the front desk for a weekly schedule).\nThe hotel also has a 24-hour fitness center, an arcade, laundry facilities, an Avis car rental desk, a ticket desk to assist with theme park planning needs and a gift shop so special (for now, at least) that it is one of the first hotels to feature a large collection of Epic Universe merchandise. I saw shirts, toys and collectibles representing all of the lands coming to the new park and some general Epic Universe-branded merchandise.\nUniversal Creative turned an unused portion of the third floor with no guest rooms into a \"sky bridge\" with starry lights in the ceiling, which is already proving to be a popular spot after being open only a couple of days.\nIf you can't resist getting that perfect Instagram photo in this trippy space, try to do so quietly so as not to disturb the guests staying on this floor.\nStella Nova Resort dining\nStella Nova Resort has several dining options to keep you fueled up for your theme park adventures.\nCosmos Cafe and Market\nLocated in the hotel lobby, Cosmos Cafe and Market is a quick-service outlet that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner daily. It also offers a selection of grab-and-go items like ice cream, snacks, prepackaged salads and sandwiches and coffee drinks.\nThe menu is comprised mostly of American classics like burgers, fries, pizza and pasta, but there are some specialty items as well. I stopped by for lunch during my stay (which was too brief to make time for breakfast).\nI tried the hot honey pizza ($15.50), which was topped with cheese, garlic cream sauce, buffalo chicken and, of course, hot honey. It was tasty — and spicy. I had the Mexican street corn ($7) on the side, which was by far my favorite dish and a huge portion for being a side item. My dining companion had the Stella burger ($15.50), which was a delicious classic burger.\nAll in all, the food was good and filling, but there are so many good dining options inside the park and at CityWalk, I think I would save my Stella Nova meals for when I needed something before heading out for the day or when I was starving after a long day at the parks.\nNova Bar\nNova Bar is also located in the lobby and is open daily from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. In addition to classic beer, wine and cocktails, you'll find space-themed drinks like the Black Hole ($16), which is basically an espresso martini, and the Super Nova (also $16), a whiskey-based cocktail with cherry-infused Campari and tart cherry syrup served smoked over a large ice cube.\nGalaxy Bar and Galaxy Grill\nGalaxy Bar and Galaxy Grill are the hotel's poolside drink and dining options. Starters include things like chips and salsa, hummus and veggies and a Mexican shrimp cocktail. For your meal, you can choose from a selection of salads, burgers, sandwiches and wraps.\nGalaxy Bar has a lengthy beer list with a mix of cans and drafts and a handful of hard ciders and seltzers.\nPizza delivery\nDirect-to-room pizza delivery is also available daily between 5 p.m. and midnight. You can place your order via phone or the [online order form](https://dag-snr.constantcontactsites.com/pizza-delivery-menu).\nStella Nova Resort theme park perks\nLike all Universal Orlando hotels, guests enjoy certain perks that only onsite hotel guests enjoy. These include early access to select theme parks and attractions each morning. Which park(s) and attractions you get access to can vary by day, but you'll get a 30-minute head start at Volcano Bay and a full hour at Islands of Adventure or Universal Studios.\nStella Nova guests also get park-to-hotel package delivery, resort-wide charging privileges using their room key and complimentary shuttle service to and from Universal's theme parks and CityWalk. Even if you drive, I recommend using the shuttle service because Universal does not offer free theme park parking to hotel guests.\nStella Nova (like its sister property, Terra Luna) has a walking path that will lead to Epic Universe when the park opens in May. It's about a 10-minute walk, but you can also take the shuttle if you choose.\nThings I loved about Stella Nova Resort\n- I am a sucker for good theming, so I was all-in on the chic spaceship vibes Stella Nova was giving off. Everything from the futuristic lobby seating to the artwork felt upscale and ultramodern. With theme parks leaning more and more toward immersing guests in the worlds they create, it only makes sense that Universal would extend this sentiment to its hotels.\n- The excitement for Epic Universe's grand opening this year is palpable among theme park fans. Stella Nova offers the first and only way for Universal guests to stay so close to this groundbreaking new park and get a glimpse inside even while they are still putting the finishing touches on the attractions. Aside from adding to the anticipation, once the park does open, guests staying at Stella Nova Resort will be only a short walk or bus ride away from Epic Universe.\n- Especially while everything in the hotel is shiny and new, you cannot beat this resort's level of theming and amenities at such an affordable price point. Universal has hotel rooms that range from the $150 range all the way up to as much as $800 per night. Obviously, you get what you pay for, and Stella Nova appears to be a great value for the nightly rate.\nThings to consider before staying at Stella Nova Resort\n- Though you are a stone's throw from Epic Universe when you stay at Stella Nova, you are a few miles away from the rest of Universal Orlando Resort. If you prefer the convenience of taking a boat, bus or short walk to Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure and CityWalk, that will not be an option when you stay here.\n- Unlike Universal's Signature Collection properties (like the upcoming\n[Universal Helios Grand Hotel](https://thepointsguy.com/news/epic-universe-helios-grand-hotel/)), you won't find amenities like multiple pools, waterslides, formal sit-down dining, 24-hour room service or luggage delivery. If those are luxuries you are acclimated to, you need to consider whether you can do without them at Stella Nova.\nBottom line\nUniversal Stella Nova Resort is the first of three new hotels opening near Epic Universe this year and it sets a high bar. Universal Terra Luna Resort opens on March 25, 2025, and should be similar in all but its theming, while Universal Helios Grand Hotel will become Epic Universe's flagship hotel when it opens along with the new park on May 22, 2025.\nThe reasons for staying at this particular hotel will be obvious once the park opens, but it offers a rare opportunity to be among the first guests on Epic Universe property for those who choose to stay here now even before May. I can confidently say I was not ready to come back down to Earth after my out-of-this-world visit to Universal Stella Nova Resort.\nRelated reading:",

    "title": "How To Harness The Power Of Feng Shui For An Auspicious 2024",
    "text": "Taoism has five principle elements that are culled from the cycles of nature (shown by the yin and yang), namely: fire, earth, metal, water and wood, and Feng Shui in traditional Chinese literally means ‘wind-water’ signifying good health and good fortune. Key principles of this metaphysical practice include inviting positive energy, creating spaces of balance and harmony in life by understanding our roots and our place in the world. Modern Chinese apply the principles of Feng Shui not only to decorate their houses, but let it resonate in every area of their personal and public lives like communication, health, city planning or corporate design among others.\nThe focus in this article is on applying Feng Shui for auspicious beginnings in outer spaces and inner spaces.\nDividing outer spaces\nSpace is assigned eight directions and given elemental representation. Wind and water are two Chinese triagrams from the eight-sided octagonal Bagua/Pa Gua figure made up of eight natural sub-elements depicted through triagrams namely Sky, Earth, Thunder, Wind, Water, Fire Mountain and Marsh. Each element has associated areas of life and interaction, seasons, colours, shapes and qualities.\nSpace is the Gua and Ba means eight and Chen, Xhen or Zhen is on the east of the Bagua dominated by the Chinese element of wood, depicting green, blue and teal colours. It is mainly associated with family, health and beginnings. The new year according to the Chinese begins on January 22, 2024. Keep the following tips in mind to begin on an auspicious note.\nAuspicious directions\nTo achieve Zhen in Feng Shui focus on spaces in the east for stability; south-east for harmony; south for prosperity and north for health. Earth and metal rule the north-east, southwest and northwest, so energising these would help tap personal energy reservoirs.\nPurify and invigorate external areas.\nCleanse\nDeclutter and cleanse every area physically to remove negative torpid, stuck and stale energy\nPut up positive motion in images like flowing water, fishes in motion, running horses to enhance your movement in time, space and life (gati)\nWash your home with salt or keep salt in a glass in different corners of the house and throw out after a few days to cleanse the aura of the space\nEnergise\nChoose a no-disturbance time and space and sit on a mat to centre yourself (Keep a small bell, some water and fragrance like incense or dhoop nearby)\nClose your eyes and focus on the brow and imagine a ball of white light\nFocus on the various directions of the home filling them with that ball of light, love and energy- affirm your choice of affirmations depending upon the directions provided in the Ba Gua. For instance in the east focus on family and health affirming that all is well with my family and my health. Empower the thought by taking that ball of light in your mind to the east corner of your home in your mind’s eye. This would entail subtle cleansing of auras through the universal life force energy\nAll the above has to be done much before the New Year as during the New Year cleansing even your hair is considered as loss of prosperity by principles of Feng Shui!\nCleansing inner spaces\nWhen we look at space, ‘cleanliness converts to godliness’ when spaces are dedicated to deities; so if the principles of Feng Shui and Ba Gua are spoken in relation to the human body, one could interpret them as balancing the ‘vaat-pitta’ in the body house or the spaces dedicated to the nava graha in the body temple. Raja Ravi Varma’s painting amply reflects the Masters of Spaces held by the nine ruling deities.\nEach deity controls one aspect of wellness in the human body considering the overlap of naturopathy, ayurveda and astrology. Similarly, in the Chinese concept of wellness and Feng Shui of time rules certain parts of the body’s function. Just as we start the new year, we start each day with the knowledge of internal spaces and irregularities withing those spaces and flowing waters, fluids also called bodily humours in olden texts.\nHow to apply this?\nSleep and wake cycles point out to auspicious times for beginning new ventures, depending upon your Chinese zodiac animal, feelings of joy or unhappiness\nYin rules the night and yang the day. Find out your most comfortable time zone. That is your space of strength and wellness in the body. Begin new assignments during that time\nFind your most uncomfortable time zone when your energy slumps. That time points to your internal organ that needs cleansing and healing energy. Avoid any new start ups related to those times",

    "text": "Boeing Workers Strike After Rejecting Contract Boeing aircraft assembly workers went on strike early Friday after union members rejected a proposed contract that would have increased wages by 25% over four years. The walkout involves 33,000 machinists in Washington state, affecting production of bestselling airplane models and marking another setback for Boeing. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Seattle | Updated: 13-09-2024 13:39 IST | Created: 13-09-2024 13:39 IST - Country: - United States In a major labor move, Boeing's aircraft assembly workers launched a strike early Friday, walking off the job at Boeing factories in the Seattle area. This action follows an overwhelming majority union vote rejecting a tentative contract offering a 25% wage hike over four years. The strike began at 12:01 a.m. PDT, shortly after the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers announced that 94.6% of voting members had rejected the proposed contract, with 96% voting to strike. The labor action includes 33,000 Boeing machinists, primarily based in Washington state, and is expected to halt production of Boeing's top-selling airline planes. While the strike is not expected to disrupt commercial flights, it represents another significant challenge for Boeing, already grappling with manufacturing issues and multiple federal investigations. Boeing responded, expressing readiness to return to negotiations to achieve a new agreement, emphasizing their commitment to improving relations with their employees and the union.
