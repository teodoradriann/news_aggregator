    "text": "| |\nSupport\nContact\nAce:\naceofspadeshq at gee mail.com\nCBD:\ncbd.aoshq at gee mail.com\nBuck:\nbuck.throckmorton at protonmail.com\njoe mannix:\nmannix2024 at proton.me\nMisHum:\npetmorons at gee mail.com\nPowered by\n|\n|\nTrump Trade Advisor Peter Navarro Sentenced to Four Months in Prison, for Stiffarming the Fake J6 Committee's Fake Subpoenas\nSentenced by an Obama judge.\nNavarro was convicted of contempt of Congress in September for not complying with a subpoena issued by the January 6th House Select Committee. Navarro's team argued during the sentencing hearing on Thursday that he believed he could not comply with the committee's subpoena due to executive privilege. \"When I received that congressional subpoena...I had an honest belief that the privilege had been invoked,\" Navarro said to US District Judge Amit Mehta, according to The Hill. Mehta scolded Navarro and his legal team during the hearing for blaming the prosecution on politics. \"It's unfortunate that the statements mislead. They mislead,\" Mehta said. \"Nancy Pelosi is not responsible for this prosecution; Joe Biden isn't responsible for the prosecution. It's those kinds of statements from someone who knows better... that contributes to why our politics are so divisive.\"Meanwhile, Merrick's Marauders are demanding 17 years in prison for a J6 hostage who\narah McAbee's husband, a former sheriff's deputy in Tennessee, was incarcerated for 26 months before he was given a trial for his role in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. \"And clearly it wasn't a jury of his peers,\" McAbee said on the \"Vicki McKenna Show,\" a radio program in Madison, Wisconsin. Ronald McAbee now awaits sentencing after being convicted of five felonies in a D.C. district court. Mr. McAbee had already pled guilty to another felony and a misdemeanor related to the riot, and prosecutors are now asking the judge to give him 14 to 17 years behind bars. Sarah McAbee, however, says her family has become victims of politically weaponized prosecutions of those involved in the Jan. 6 demonstrations. When asked by the radio show's guest host, Federalist Senior Elections Correspondent Matt Kittle, why her husband remains behind bars 29 months later, Sarah blamed the lengthy incarceration on what her husband saw at the riot. \"I truly believe it is because he was a law enforcement officer, and he witnessed a murder happen right in front of his eyes,\" Sarah said. \"I believe that's why he was held without bond. He was held 26 months before he even stepped foot in a trial.\"The left has been beating the shit out of police and lasing them in the eyes for decades. Although I never agreed with the refusal to prosecute these \"protesters,\" I accepted the claim that their violence was associated with free speech, and thus we have to treat it with extreme latitude, otherwise we chill the right to free speech itself. I did accept that. And then some righties engaged in hooligan behavior that was 5% of what antifa and BLM do every riot and the government went after them like the Gestapo. So are we supposed to nod along as BLM and antifa thugs get sentenced to \"time served\" -- the two days they spent in jail over the weekend -- for throwing bottles filled with their filthy piss at cops? And what about Hunter Biden? What about Eric Holder and the many Democrats who have defied subpeonas? Should they be allowed to breathe free air? No. It is time for actual vengeance. The future of the country depends on it. For we will either have a civil compact, or we will have a civil war. It is necessary to go as hard after the left, throwing them in jail for months and decades at a clip, to insist that this is not a two-tiered society. Because when the left succeeds in making this country a two-tiered society, people go to war. People will not allow themselves to be made into slaves and prisoners by a hostile alien regime.\nPosted by: Disinformation Expert Ace at\nComments\nPosted by:\nI did accept that.\nAnd then some righties engaged in hooligan behavior that was 5% of what antifa and BLM do every riot and the government went after them like the Gestapo.\n-\nWhen only government approved free speech exists...\nPosted by:\nPosted by: JT at January 25, 2024 01:23 PM (T4tVD)\n========\nBiden's administration arresting Texas State Troopers in Eagle Pass in order to allow the breaking of federal law by illegal immigrants may do it first, though.\nPosted by:\nAndrew Breitbart said it best: \"War.\"\nPosted by: jmel at January 25, 2024 01:23 PM (RWHIh)\nBecause when the left succeeds in making this country a two-tiered society, people go to war.

There won't be a widespread CW2, because the unrest will start in the inner cities and that will be so consuming of resources that the Leftists will never have the opportunity to come out for us.\nIt is, of course, related to economics. The fiscal collapse is inevitable and, again, will probably happen in one or more blue states before it happens in DC. If there were to be another Biden term, it would likely happen sooner; ironically, the economic growth that will occur under Trump may forestall Washington having to make some hard choices. But inevitably, it cannot go on forever.

    "text": "ANA POMPEU BRASÍLIA, DF (FOLHAPRESS) Os estados de São Paulo e do Rio de Janeiro podem sofrer com inundamentos por chuvas severas nos próximos dias em decorrência de uma frente fria. Os alertas são de volume alto de chuva especialmente no litoral norte de São Paulo, e na costa verde e na região serrana do Rio de Janeiro. A Defesa Civil Nacional fez o alerta nesta quinta-feira (21) por meio de coletiva de imprensa no Ministério da Integração e do Desenvolvimento Regional, em Brasília, sobre as fortes chuvas que devem atingir a região Sudeste a partir desta quinta-feira (21) O aviso vermelho vale até a manhã do próximo domingo (24). Até lá, as autoridades e especialistas pedem que a população dessas áreas esteja atenta às informações pelos canais oficiais da Defesa Civil Nacional e estaduais, Inmet (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia) e Inpe (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais). Segundo o diretor do Cenad (Centro Nacional de Gerenciamento de Riscos e Desastres), Armin Braun, o ministério está em contato com os governos dos quatro estados do Sudeste e alguns municípios. “Todo o sistema de comunicação já foi feito e as medidas são de preparação. Amanhã, quando devemos ter uma previsão mais apurada, se for necessário sairmos da condição de sobreaviso”, afirmou. Os temporais esperados decorrem de uma grande frente fria que já começou a causar chuvas e ventos no Rio Grande do Sul. Desde a madrugada, foram registrados ventos de até 140 km/h no RS. Cerca de 1 milhão de pessoas ficaram sem energia. As regiões com maiores possibilidades de desastres em São Paulo estão no litoral norte, como em São Sebastião, Ubatuba, Caraguatatuba e Ilhabela, e no Guarujá. No Rio de Janeiro, a chamada costa verde, que engloba as cidades de Mangaratiba, Angra dos Reis, Ilha Grande (distrito de Angra dos Reis), Paraty, Itaguaí e Rio Claro; além de região metropolitana e região serrana do Rio podem ter enchentes, enxurradas, deslizamentos. “Especialmente em Paraty e em Angra dos Reis o acúmulo de chuva que pode ultrapassar 200mm, especialmente sexta e sábado. É uma condição grave”, pontua a climatologista do Inmet Márcia Seabra. Marcelo Cerutti, do Cemaden (Centro Nacional de Monitoramento e Alertas de Desastres Naturais), ressalta que a situação demanda atenção, ainda que a previsão não se confirme. “É muito provável termos problemas e todos devemos ficar atentos e preparados para isso. Mesmo que a situação final seja menos grave do que estamos prevendo, pode ser menos grave do que estamos prevendo”, disse.",

    "title": "Selection Of New Hamas Leader Further Dampens Expectations Of Gaza Cease-Fire – Analysis",
    "text": "By VOA By Dale Gavlak\nHamas leader Yahya Sinwar, believed to be the architect of the October 7 attacks on Israel, is now the Palestinian terror group’s new political chief as well as its military leader based in Gaza. Analysts say Sinwar is unlikely to conclude a cease-fire deal with Israel to end fighting in Gaza and return hostages, but a Hamas spokesman says Sinwar will continue negotiations.\nNicholas Heras of Washington’s New Lines Institute told VOA Yahya Sinwar’s unanimous appointment as Hamas’ new political chief shows that Gaza is now center stage, and not Qatar, where the political leadership has been based.\n“Now, Hamas is making a very clear statement to the world, not just to Israel, the United States, Qatar and Egypt that the path for Hamas runs through Gaza and fundamentally Hamas is willing to fight until the very bitter end, not only for its own survival as an organization, but from its point of view for the future of the Palestinian people. Hamas is signaling to the Israelis and whoever works with them that there is no way to separate Gaza and the future of Gaza from Hamas,” said Heras.\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it’s now up to Yahya Sinwar to clinch a ceasefire deal in the 10-month Gaza conflict because he “has been and remains the primary decider.” This indicates that was the case even when top Hamas negotiator Ismail Haniyeh, considered relatively more moderate, was still alive.\nKhaled Hroub, a Hamas specialist at Northwestern University in Qatar, told France’s Le Monde newspaper that “if Israel, the United States and their allies in the region and beyond were hoping to subdue Hamas by force, the response will be a more radical Hamas.”\nHe said he does not see a softening of the group’s position as Washington and Qatar try to reach a deal in hopes of reducing the current escalation between Israel and Iran.\nCinzia Bianco, a Gulf specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations told VOA that Qatar has tried for eight months to see a deal happen, but Hamas really takes its cues from Iran.\n“They only respond to Iran and perhaps to other external backers to some extent, Russia and China as well. The political cause and the military cause are now one. That means that Qatar’s leverage is now less,” said Bianco.\nIsraeli and U.S. intelligence officers told The New York Times that Sinwar’s strategy is “to keep the war in Gaza going for as long as it takes to shred Israel’s international reputation and to damage its relationship with its primary ally, the United States.”\nNicholas Heras said he sees Sinwar both influenced by slain Iranian Republican Guard Corps General Qassem Soleimani and using his Israel playbook. Heras said “Soleimani developed an entire strategy to create a network of proxies and partners that surround Israel,” including Hamas, to seek its destruction.\n“Over time a series of attritional conflicts with Israel will undermine the foundation of Israel economically, socially, politically and then geopolitically. All those elements have been present in this current conflict that Hamas initiated on October 7, 2023. And we see this Soleimani playbook continue to be enacted,” he said.\nObservers say they see both Sinwar and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as unwilling to reach a cease-fire agreement for their own political reasons.",
