    "text": "Cologne police acting on indications of a possible attack searched Germany’s landmark cathedral with sniffer dogs on Saturday and said worshippers attending Christmas Eve Mass would undergo security screening before being allowed in. In Austria, police in Vienna also said they were taking heightened security measures around churches and Christmas markets, deploying both uniformed and plainclothes officers. Neither police agency specified the threat, but the German news agency dpa said authorities were responding to signs of a possible attack by Islamic extremists, without citing a specific source. Michael Esser, head of the criminal investigation department of the Cologne police, said in a news release that the threat indications pointed to New Year’s Eve rather than Christmas, but added that “we are putting everything possible in motion for the security of cathedral visitors on Christmas Eve”. Cologne’s towering cathedral, whose twin spires are 157 metres (515 feet) tall, is a major tourist destination visited by some six million people a year. Police and cathedral officials urged those attending Mass on Sunday evening to arrive early and not bring bags or purses. The European Union’s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, warned on December 5 that Europe faces a “huge risk of terrorist attacks” over the Christmas holidays due to fall-out from the war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

A pesar de la situación de violencia que prevalece en los municipios de Chicomuselo y Pantelhó, hasta este jueves no se habían suspendido las elecciones extraordinarias programadas para realizarse el domingo, informaron fuentes oficiales.\nAgregaron que los consejos distritales del Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE) tienen hasta este viernes para sesionar y valorar el ajuste de casillas en las comunidades en las que eventualmente no haya condiciones de seguridad para que la población salga a votar.\nExplicaron que primero sesionarán los consejos distritales este viernes para reajustar las casillas y valorar las condiciones y luego el Instituto de Elecciones y Participación Ciudadana (IEPC) sesionará para acatar el reajuste de casillas, si es parcial o total la baja de casillas en los municipios en los que hay más problemas que son Chicomuselo y Pantelhó, donde se suspendieron las elecciones del 2 de junio debido a la situación de violencia.\nAdemás de los dos municipios citados también se prevé realizar votaciones extraordinarias del domingo en Capitán Luis A. Vidal, donde se anularon los comicios por la destrucción de urnas.\nEn tanto, pobladores de Chicomuselo informaron que se estima que más del 70 por ciento de habitantes se han desplazado paulatinamente de comunidades y barrios desde el año pasado como consecuencia de la violencia que impera en ese lugar, donde grupos del narcotráfico se disputan el territorio, al igual que en otros municipios de la sierra y la frontera de Chiapas.\nComentaron que el jueves había en la cabecera de Chicomuselo algunas personas de un partido político con un aparato de sonido llamando a votar el próximo domingo, pero “en cuanto vieron que se acercaban algunas camionetas y se retiraron de prisa.",

    "title": "Imperatives after OFW deaths",
    "text": "Hardly have we rejoiced over the 15-year prison term given the man behind Jullebee Ranara’s murder in Kuwait last year, when comes news about the suspicious death of two more overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Saudi Arabia.\nOn Monday, Sen. Raffy Tulfo told the Senate committee on migrant workers that the families of Jelyn Arguzon and Riolyn Sayson have approached him for help after the two OFWs were reported dead by their recruitment agencies. Tulfo said Arguzon’s husband, Jerriel Amatorio, had lost contact in June with his wife whose passport was reportedly taken by her employer. The OFW, Tulfo said, had previously informed her family that she was having trouble with the child of her employer who also allegedly limited contact between Arguzon and her family. Saudi officials eventually informed the family that Arguzon had died of natural causes in July.\nMeanwhile, Sayson’s death was due to cardiac arrest, Saudi officials said, although Tulfo noted that she had passed all local health screenings prior to deployment. He also quoted her husband, Edilberto Sayson, as saying that his wife’s employer had limited her access to Wi-Fi, kept her locked in her room, and fed her only one meal a day. Riolyn reportedly feared her employers would harm her so she did not complain formally. While his wife’s main worry was her limited food provision, Edilberto said Riolyn had also complained of back pains and shortness of breath prior to her death.\nTraditionally patriarchal Arguzon and Sayson are the latest in the long list of OFWs who have suffered abuse, maltreatment, and death, often at the hands of their Middle East employers and family members. In 2020, nearly 5,000 cases of maltreatment of OFWs had been reported, majority of which came from the Middle East with 4,302 cases.\nFEATURED STORIES OPINION Fitting finale to felon’s fairy tale OPINION Ghost to golden August OPINION ‘Mansanas sa kili-kili This is hardly surprising. Most countries in the Middle East are still traditionally patriarchal, where women are considered part of the household and thus subject to male guardianship and its rules. Inequalities in law have also led to women being treated as second-class citizens, with little or no protection from violence.\nDespite the risk of abuse, however, Saudi Arabia remains the top destination country among OFWs, with 419,776 Filipinos deployed, according to 2023 data from the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW). The Philippine Statistics Authority meanwhile noted that of the estimated 1.96 million OFWs in 2022, 57.8 percent or 1.13 million are women, most of whom are engaged in domestic work.\nWith the safety of other OFWs at stake, Arguzon’s and Sayson’s tragic cases should prompt a deeper probe from both the Saudi government and the DMW. A good start would be an independent autopsy of their remains.\nLapses in protocol Recruitment agencies that profit from OFW deployment must be held accountable as well especially since, as DMW Undersecretary Bernard Olalia noted, there were lapses in protocol in how Arguzon’s agency handled the situation. Tulfo also noted that the agency should have seen the red flags when Arguzon and her employer could no longer be contacted. These companies also have the responsibility to make sure that OFWs leave in good shape, and that no shortcuts are taken in their health screenings, the senator added. While the agencies involved in the death of the two OFWs have been suspended, sanctions against their negligence should include hefty fines and the cancellation of their license should abuses against OFWs occur repeatedly under their watch.\nADVERTISEMENT And how about a review of our bilateral agreements with host countries that, as pointed out earlier by OFW party list Rep. Marissa Magsino, are often “lacking explicit provisions relating to social security, equality of treatment, repatriation, and most importantly, on protocols governing the investigation and prosecution of criminal offenses committed against OFWs, and on legal remedies available to them and their families …”\nBetter mechanisms Under the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipino Act, the government must ensure the protection of OFWs through agreements with host countries, she added. The DMW should consider sending OFWs only to countries where we have strong bilateral relations.\nADVERTISEMENT Given Saudi Arabia’s less than exemplary record in treating migrant workers, the Philippines should pressure its government to come up with better mechanisms to protect OFWs, with the possibility of again suspending their deployment should such reforms be withheld. Recall that DMW had imposed a ban on sending OFWs to Saudi in 2021 because of the abuses and the reported billions of pesos worth of unpaid wages to Filipino construction workers who had lost their jobs in 2015 and 2016 when their companies declared bankruptcy. The ban was lifted in November 2022, but as of July 2024, some 2,000 of the 10,000 OFWs still have to collect on their claims.\nWith OFWs sending some $15 billion from January to May this year—a hefty sum propping up the economy—can our government afford to do any less for our modern day heroes?\nYour subscription could not be saved.

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",
