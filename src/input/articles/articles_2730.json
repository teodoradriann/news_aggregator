    "title": "SOUN Earnings: SoundHound AI Jumps after Strong Q4 Results",
    "text": "Shares of SoundHound AI (SOUN) jumped in after-hours trading after the voice AI software company reported earnings for its fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. Earnings per share came in at -$0.05, which beat analysts’ consensus estimate of -$0.10 per share. In addition, sales increased by 101% year-over-year, with revenue hitting $34.5 million. This also beat analysts’ expectations of $33.7 million.\nCEO and Co-Founder of SoundHound AI, Keyvan Mohajer, attributed the company’s success to major customer wins and expanding partnerships. Indeed, some major customers include Burger King UK and Lucid Motors (LCID).\nSoundHound Updates Guidance\nLooking forward, management has provided the following updated guidance for 2025:\n- FY25 revenue between $157 million to $177 million versus estimates of $165.3 million\nAs you can see, guidance was better than expected, with the midpoint figure of $167 million surpassing consensus estimates. This, combined with the firm’s solid Q4 results, led to the after-hours gain.\nInvestor Sentiment for SOUN Stock\nThe sentiment among TipRanks investors is currently very negative. Out of the 789,147 portfolios tracked by TipRanks, 2.2% hold SOUN stock. In addition, the average portfolio weighting allocated towards SOUN among those who do have a position is 5.14%. This suggests that investors in the company are fairly confident about its future. However, in the past 30 days, the percentage change in the number of portfolios holding the stock fell by 1.2%.\nIs SOUN Stock a Good Investment?\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on SOUN stock based on two Buys, two Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 45% rally in its share price over the past year, the average SOUN price target of $16.50 per share implies 79.1% upside potential. However, it’s worth noting that estimates will likely change following today’s earnings report.",

    "title": "Felon Trump: Milwaukee Is A Horrible City | Crooks and Liars",
    "text": "On Tuesday morning, when the felonious Trump returned to the [scene of the crime](https://crooksandliars.com/2024/06/dems-give-felon-45-reality-check-he), Capitol Hill, to meet with his top bootlickers and co-conspirators, he took a minute to do some trash talking about Milwaukee, where the RNC will be holding their convention next month: And then all hilarity broke loose as his aides and state Republicans fell over themselves trying to spin the insult away. Trump spokesman, Steven Cheung, called it \"Total bullshit,\" but did not deny Trump said it. Meanwhile, a RNC spokesperson said that Trump's comments were in regard to the fact that Milwaukee [won't push protesters](https://crooksandliars.com/2024/05/johnsons-latest-fauxrage-security-rnc) into Lake Michigan. The Wisconsin GOP claimed that the issue was election integrity, citing the election clerk who proved the system worked by trying to cheat and getting [caught and convicted](https://crooksandliars.com/2024/03/former-milwaukee-election-official). When the Wisconsin GOP delegation was asked about it, they were all over the map [in their excuses](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2024/06/13/trump-calls-milwaukee-host-for-the-2024-rnc-a-horrible-city/74083831007/): U.S. Reps. Glenn Grothman of the 6th Congressional District, Scott Fitzgerald of the 5th Congressional District and Tom Tiffany of the 7th Congressional District all told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Trump made the comments when speaking about the upcoming election.Grothman said Trump “was concerned about the election in Milwaukee” and said he thought Trump “felt we need to do better in urban centers around the country.” He suggested Trump had concerns that Republicans “didn’t do very well in Milwaukee.” An aide to Fitzgerald also told the Journal Sentinel that Trump’s comments “were about election integrity.” Trump has repeatedly falsely claimed he won Wisconsin in 2020 and has at times blamed Milwaukee's election officials for the election outcome, baselessly claiming absentee voting in the state's largest city was rife with fraud. U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, a freshman Republican who represents Wisconsin's 3rd Congressional District in western Wisconsin, blasted Punchbowl's reporting, however, saying in a post on the social media platform X that the former president was \"specifically referring to the CRIME RATE in Milwaukee.\" And Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, who represents the state's 1st Congressional District, said: \"I was in the room. President Trump did not say this. There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\" And here I was hoping he hated my hometown so much because of me. Oh, well. Grothman then came back with a rare moment of lucidity and honesty: Grothman later said he was confused by the mixed messages from Wisconsin's delegation and reiterated Trump was referring to election issues. “I guess you can take it however you wanna take it,” he said of Trump’s comments. The Democrats weren't about to take a felon trash talking Wisconsin's biggest city, with Representative Gwen Moore and Senator Tammy Baldwin giving him a one-two that will leave a mark: Ironically, Trump is all excited to come to Racine, Wisconsin next week, which means his plane will be landing and taking off from Milwaukee. Maybe, if Milwaukee is so horrible, he could spare himself - and us - from that experience by staying home. And Felonious Don, we'll let you know the feeling is mutual in November.",

    "text": "© Reuters. Independence activist Tony Chung is pictured in a street in Hong Kong, China January 8, 2019. Picture taken January 8, 2019. REUTERS/James Pomfret/File Photo (Reuters) - The former leader of a Hong Kong pro-independence group says he received up to HK$3,000 ($384) from security officers per meeting to become an informant when he was released from jail in June, before he fled to Britain and sought political asylum.\nIn November 2021, Tony Chung, who was then 20, was sentenced to 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering. Chung was charged with secession under a sweeping national security law imposed by China in 2020 and denied bail. He pleaded guilty.\nHe said on Thursday he fled to Britain after he was freed and had formally applied for political asylum.\nReuters couldn't independently confirm key aspects of Chung's version of events, including whether the financial transaction took place, what Chung disclosed to authorities and whether any other activists were also allegedly offered money to be informants.\nThe Correctional Services Department and Hong Kong Security Bureau did not respond to a request for comment.\nAt a regular press briefing on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing, in response to a question on Chung, said that those who try to evade legal responsibility will be pursued. The Hong Kong Correctional Services Department said at a press conference they will liaise with relevant authorities to put Chung on a \"wanted list\".\nBeijing imposed the national security law on the Asian financial hub in 2020 after months of anti-government protests. The law punishes acts including subversion, secession and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.\nChung told Reuters in a video call he was offered between HK$500 and HK$3,000 by national security officers to become an informant and was closely monitored and visited by authorities after his release from Tai Lam Correctional Institution.\n\"They basically didn't give me a choice. I feel like they wanted to test whether I am willing to cooperate and surrender to them,\" Chung said.\nHe said he accepted money, in cash, because he felt he had no choice but to become an informant, adding that he provided insignificant information. As a result of being paid in cash he said there was no bank documentation of the transaction.\nThe activist said he told authorities he didn't meet any special people, showed them his stories on the social media platform Instagram and informed them that he was busy with his studies and work.\nChung said officers demanded that he sign a document related to the National Security Law, prohibiting him from disclosing their communication to anyone or to seek legal advice. He said he signed the agreement.\nIn response to questions about Chung's case, the Hong Kong Police Public Relations Branch said in an email that \"one of the responsibilities of the National Security Department (NSD) is to collect and analyse intelligence and information concerning national security,\" citing Article 17 of the security law. The police email did not address Chung's allegation of having acted as an informant.\nThe police email said \"recently some individuals who have committed crimes endangering national security openly violated supervision orders or bail conditions and fled Hong Kong, completely betraying trust and integrity\" and that police \"strongly condemn such behaviour\".\nMENTAL STRESS\nThe activist said he had \"intermittently fallen ill\" since October and that his doctor diagnosed him as having significant mental stress and psychological factors which had led to a weakened immune system.\nThe trauma, continued surveillance and the impending legislation of a local national security law, also known as Article 23, made him leave Hong Kong, he said.\nChung also told Reuters that he was forced to take part in a \"deradicalization\" talk in detention where he was taught about Chinese history, parts of which he said glorified China's achievements.\nChung said he was released in June 2023, with his time reduced for good behaviour.\nChung is the former leader of Hong Kong pro-independence group Studentlocalism that dissolved in 2020 before the security law came into effect.\nProsecutors had said at the time he was charged that he acted as an administrator for the Facebook (NASDAQ: META ) pages of the U.S. branch of Studentlocalism and an organization called the Initiative Independence Party. They also said pro-independence T-shirts, flags and books were seized from his home.\nChung had entered a plea bargain, admitting guilt on the charge of secession and one count of money laundering and pleading not guilty to a sedition charge and another money laundering charge.\nChung told Reuters that he plans to pursue a university degree and contribute to international advocacy work for Hong Kong.\n\"I want to try my best to push for freedom and democracy in Hong Kong,\" Chung said.\nThe former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy. Democracy activists and some Western governments say China broke that promise, an allegation that Beijing denies.\n($1 = 7.8145 Hong Kong dollars)\nHong Kong exiled activist says he was paid by authorities to be informant",
