    "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo has set yet another astonishing record by scoring his 900th career goal, a milestone that solidifies his status as one of the greatest footballers the world has ever seen. It's nearly impossible to imagine any other male player ever reaching this incredible feat. From his early days at Sporting CP to his stints with Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus, and currently Al Nassr, Ronaldo's career has been nothing short of legendary. His accolades include five Ballon d'Or awards, numerous titles across three of Europe's top five leagues, and five UEFA Champions League trophies.

On September 5, 2024, Ronaldo struck his historic 900th goal, meeting a pinpoint cross from the left from Nuno Mendes before turning the ball home from close range, doubling Portugal's lead against Croatia in the UEFA Nations League.

While some neighbors had safety concerns learning about the caves inches away from the waters of the Tuolumne River, others asked where else the homeless would go.\n“I know it’s dangerous, but they’re also out in the elements,\" said Brandenburg. \"What’s (more) dangerous? Freezing or starving, or living in a cave that I’m sure they know how they built and they know how sturdy it’s going to be?\"...\nIn a Facebook post, Modesto police said that officials offered resources to transition the homeless from the caves into shelter or housing over the weekend.\nHowever, for some neighbors like Brandenburg, the caves aren't a problem.\n\"Let them have their peace, they’re out of everybody’s way,\" said Brandenburg. “I mean, it’s getting them out of the weather, it’s not hindering anybody and I thought it was a good idea they did it.”",

    "text": "GREENVILLE, Pitt County — A new traffic signal could help prevent pedestrian crashes. NCDOT wants to bring to Greenville in the area of 10th Street near ECU. [That's where a car hit two people just this week.](https://wcti12.com/news/local/two-pedestrians-hit-by-car-in-greenville-investigation-underway#) News 12 spent the day talking with students and officials about crosswalk safety. ECU students use these crosswalks everyday with systems already in place to help them cross streets safely. Some think it's not enough, but change is already on the way. \"I do think they need to either police it more or put in different signs, I'm not really sure,\" said ECU Senior BraddockRhodenhiser. On Monday, a car hit two women while they crossed 10th Street, next to ECU's campus. Both were taken to ECU Health Medical, and one has since been released. It's a pattern students have become familiar with and even experienced themselves. Especially on 10th, crossing the crosswalk, I've almost been hit multiple times, and I think they need to change something to do with that because either people don't see the flashing lights or people don't think to slow down. Now, change is coming. Due to the numerous accidents involving pedestrians over the years NCDOT has decided to step in with a new traffic signal. It's called the Hawk System. \"The vehicles aren't stopping like they're supposed to with the RFB systems...we submitted a request in September of 2023 for the Hawk System,\" said Division Traffic Engineer, Jim Evans. This new system works a bit differently...when the button is pressed, drivers will see a flashing yellow light warning drivers to slow down. Then, the light turns a solid yellow, which means prepare to stop. Lastly, the light turns a solid red. That's when pedestrians can cross the street as a countdown starts. Near the end, the light will start flashing red. There's going to be some education about this once we get it installed in the area, I've already brought it up to the Greenville Task Force and ECU that we're going to have to get some information out on how the system works because it works different than a signal. Evans tells us they are waiting for approval for design plans but hopes construction will start next August.",

American Honda rider Ricky Brabec won the motorcycling category for the second time in the 46th edition of the gruelling two-week race. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 19-01-2024 15:30 IST | Created: 19-01-2024 15:29 IST Spaniard Carlos Sainz, 61-year-old father of the namesake Ferrari Formula One driver, won the Dakar Rally for the fourth time in Saudi Arabia on Friday with Audi taking a first title in the car category. American Honda rider Ricky Brabec won the motorcycling category for the second time in the 46th edition of the gruelling two-week race. Sainz finished the 12th and final stage in Yanbu, on the Red Sea coast, with a lead of one hour 20 minutes and 25 seconds over Belgian Guillaume de Mevius for Overdrive Toyota with France's Sebastien Loeb third. Loeb, a nine times world rally champion who had been Sainz's biggest rival until mechanical problems ended his challenge on Thursday, won the final stage in a Prodrive Hunter for the Bahrain Raid Xtreme team. Sainz has now won the Dakar with four different manufacturers -- Volkswagen in 2010, Peugeot in 2018 and Mini in 2020 -- and he did it this time without winning any of the individual stages. Audi, who have been targeting the Dakar since 2022 and are widely expected to now focus on their new Formula One project, are the first to win with a car powered by an electric drive train. The Audi RS Q e-tron uses an energy converter, featuring a 2.0 litre four cylinder turbo engine, to charge the car's high-voltage battery while driving. The rally began in 1978 as a race from Paris across the Sahara to the Senegalese capital but switched to South America in 2009 for security reasons. It moved to Saudi Arabia in 2020 and is now the flagship of the FIA world rally-raid championship. (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
