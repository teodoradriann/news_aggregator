    "text": "The Allan Labor Government is helping Beaufort businesses to better attract and retain workers across local industries, with work starting on 10 new worker houses to help boost local service delivery and economic growth.\nMember for Ripon Martha Haylett today joined local builders Hotondo Homes Ararat and GJ Gardner Homes Ballarat to officially launch construction at the site, which is being supported by the Labor Government's Regional Worker Accommodation Fund.\nConfigured in two or three-bedroom layouts, the completed homes will offer rental options for both long-term and seasonal workers and their families, especially those in agriculture, healthcare, construction and manufacturing.\nThe houses will also reduce reliance on workers from Ballarat and beyond to fill local jobs, providing employment opportunities that are not as reliant on access to transport. As part of this project, water, electricity, gas, sewerage and internet connections will also be installed at the Burke Street site and the adjacent building lot.\nThese important works, along with funding from the Australian Government, will enable Pyrenees Shire Council to further pursue the development of even more housing and laying the groundwork for future economic development in the town.\nThe Beaufort worker houses are another example of the Regional Worker Accommodation Fund backing regional suppliers to deliver solutions to worker housing shortages. The development will support local jobs across Hotondo Homes and GJ Gardner Homes, ensuring the project is delivered by and for regional workers.\nThis locally led approach is a key feature of projects being supported by the Labor Government across the regions and ensures regional communities have access to the skills and workforces they need to thrive.\nThe Government's support for the project is part of a record $47 billion investment in just over a decade to drive economic growth and make Victoria's regions even better places to live, work, stay, experience, invest and study. For more information, visit rdv.vic.gov.au.\nAs stated by Minister for Regional Development Jaclyn Symes\n\"I'm pleased to see the start of construction for these houses, which will bring more seasonal and long-term workers to Beaufort and help local businesses and community members to thrive.\"\nAs stated by Member for Ripon Martha Haylett\n\"We know that a strong economy is one where jobs are created and supported where they're needed most. That's what we're doing for Beaufort and other communities through our Regional Worker Accommodation Fund.\"\nAs stated by Pyrenees Shire Council CEO Jim Nolan\n\"By helping to increase our housing stock, the Victorian Government's Regional Worker Accommodation Fund provides opportunities for employees to live and work in our community, which will have positive flow-on effects for our population and economy.\"\nAs stated by Hotondo Homes Ararat Manager Russell Pearse\n\"Hotondo Homes is looking forward to helping complete the Beaufort Key Worker Accommodation Project, funded by the Victorian Government's Regional Worker Accommodation Fund - this will be a fantastic boost for Pyrenees Shire, and we are proud to be associated with its creation.\"\nAs stated by GJ Gardner Homes Ballarat Director Nathan Cavanagh\n\"We're excited to partner with the Pyrenees Shire and the Victorian Government to deliver new dwellings in Beaufort that will provide much-needed worker accommodation. This collaboration supports local employment and strengthens the region's capacity to attract and retain essential workers.\"\nhere.",

    "text": "Victims of sexual assault and harassment in the Coast Guard call for major changes after Senate committee’s new report\nBy Morgan Rimmer, CNN\n(CNN) — Five former and current members of the US Coast Guard testified before a subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Thursday about their experiences with sexual assault and harassment while serving and called for major changes to how the Coast Guard handles reports.\nAfter months of investigation across both chambers, the Senate Homeland Security Committee’s subcommittee on investigations released a 48-page majority staff report on Wednesday, detailing the decades of abuse and cover-ups. It’s the first to be released out of a string of ongoing government inquiries triggered by\nCNN’s reporting on a secret Coast Guard probe into sexual abuse at its prestigious Coast Guard Academy. That investigation, dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor, was kept secret from the public and even Congress despite substantiating dozens of past assaults.\nMeghan Lori Klement, a former Seaman, told the committee Thursday that she had felt like she was in a “nightmare” after she was harassed and assaulted for months by a retired senior chief who was contracted to her base.\nKlement noted that she was pulled aside and told to “think about the life and career” of the perpetrator. “I was a young girl, and I was really scared,” she said. “When he said those words to me, I lost all hope, felt ashamed and embarrassed. I felt completely discredited, and that has followed me around for 11 years.”\nShe said a turning point was when someone with a higher rank finally committed to supporting her. “When I realized that I had somebody who held some sort of rank and position standing behind me, that is when I became really brave,” Klement said. “There’s a lot of power in that.”\nKlement also said that she has not been given access to the documents around her own case, while she was active duty or afterward. “We’ll see if I ever get (them) back,” she said.\nJulian Bell, a Chief Warrant Officer 4, too said he received “absolutely nothing” about his own case, and that his requests through the Freedom of Information Act have been denied.\nCrystal Van Den Heuvel, a Yeoman Petty Officer First Class, recounted how a man she worked with told her that he had thought about stealing her underwear on multiple occasions, and that while she was in a car with him, he kept trying to reach into her bag and saying he wanted to smell her underwear. Van Den Heuvel said the man did not stop until she threatened to leave him on the side of the road and have his wife pick him up.\nDuring the hearing, Van Den Heuvel pushed for the idea that command should not be able to evaluate victims for a year after they come forward about assault, so that they don’t face retaliation. Instead, Van Den Heuvel said that victims need an outside agency to evaluate their cases “so that there is no conflict of interest” within command. Several other witnesses agreed, as Van Den Heuvel noted that commanding officers often are friendly with each other, and even went to the Coast Guard Academy together.\nShawna Christine Ward, a retired Chief Warrant Officer 4, was one of the witnesses who said that there should be a third party to evaluate victim statements and investigations.\n“It’s the exact same story, and the Coast Guard is just saying, ‘It’s OK.’ I’m tired of the words,” Ward said. “I’m tired of the word ‘commitment.’ There is no commitment. Words are not enough to fix it. Action actually has to be taken in order to do it.”\nIn closing, Ward told the committee, “I loved the Coast Guard. I still do. But there is a certain part of the Coast Guard that is completely broken.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "A New Patriotic Party (NPP) stalwart, Gabby Otchere-Darko has strongly criticised those who believe in the authenticity of the “Agyapadeɛ” document, describing such belief as irrational and questioning the intelligence of its proponents. In an interview on Channel One TV on Tuesday (13 August), Otchere-Darko addressed the claims surrounding the document, which some allege contains predictions of current political events. He dismissed these claims, asserting that they stem from a lack of critical analysis. “If any intelligent person or a person who considers him or herself intelligent, believes that a family that has one of their leaders being offered the opportunity to lead the country would sit down and conspire evil against the nation and put the picture of the overlord or the head of the family on that document, you must have your head examined if you believe that—you must have your head examined,” Otchere-Darko said. “When I hear people try to say that things in the book are happening, let me explain to you and it’s a very imbecilic statement to even hear because it comes from a non-analytical appreciation of what is in that fiction,” he added. “Agyapadeɛ” is a 38-page document alleged to outline a plot for state capture orchestrated by influential figures of Akyem descent. The document, which lacks an identifiable author, portrays the Okyenhene, Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin, on its cover. Inside, it features images of President Nana Akufo-Addo alongside his father, former President Edward Akufo-Addo. The text is purported to lay out a strategy to establish the Akyem kingdom as the most powerful in the country.
