    "title": "Dancing on Ice 2025 star reveals she had miscarriage during time on show - NewsBreak",
    "text": "By Maira Butt ,\n1 hours ago Dancing on Ice star Chelsee Healey has revealed that she experienced a tragedy during her time on the show.\nThe 36-year-old Hollyoaks star and mother-of-two joined the programme earlier this year and was partnered with professional dancer Andy Buchanan. She suffered a fall that left her unconscious, and was the first to be eliminated from the contest after a week . In a tearful video shortly after her elimination, she had hinted: “I have had a lot to deal with”.\nAs the competition gets underway, Healey has now revealed that she suffered a miscarriage, and was left grieving during her brief experience. She thanked her loved ones, ITV and Buchanan for their support as she detailed her experience in an emotional statement.\n“I haven’t been able to talk about this until now, because it’s been too painful,” she began in a post on Instagram on Thursday (30 Jan).\n”Whilst committed to Dancing on Ice and the busy training schedule, to our shock we discovered that I was pregnant.\n“Within weeks of finding out this news, before me and my family could allow this news to sink in and digest it, I suffered a miscarriage .”\nSpeaking about the effect the experience had on her, Healey laid bare her emotions as she shared: “Understandably this really did devastate me and hit me deeply, finding out this news and then having it taken in such a short [space] of time is an awful lot to deal with.\nHealey was eliminated first and had hinted she had had personal circumstances affecting her performance (ITV) “I know I am beyond blessed to have two beautiful daughters but the grief still feels enormous. I am grieving for the little soul I carried momentarily who I’ll never get to meet, the sibling that my girls will never get to have.”\nThe Waterloo Road star, who has previously competed in the ninth series of Strictly Come Dancing too, added: “The child that will forever leave my heart curious with the ‘what ifs’. And it is painful. I thought I could just carry on but anyone who knows me, knew I wasn’t right. Some feelings you can park, put in a box and move on.\nStar shared an emotional post on Instagram (Instagram/Chelsee Healey) “This hurts differently and I can’t just move on, not yet anyway. I think that my little baby deserves to be honoured by me allowing myself to feel all the emotions, all the sadness for what will not be. There is no shame in that.”\nShe shared a message for other women going through a similar experience as she wrote: “I am truly sorry for your loss and I hope you are allowed to express and feel your emotions. Our heavenly children deserve a place in our hearts.”\nShe added: “A gentle reminder that we never know what someone else is going through or how their pain maybe hurting them.”\nBuchanan shared a supportive message under the post as he commented: “You’re a special person and I can’t express how much I respect you as a friend and a partner.\n“Knowing what you were going through, you always impressed me with how you put on a brave face and treated everyone around you with such kindness, even on you most difficult days. You’re brave for sharing this”.",

    "text": "by Alex Berenson, Unreported Truths :\nAnd what – if anything – can be done to undo the damage is not clear (aside from a Trump landslide, followed by a Trump promise to forswear lawfare, both very unlikely)\nWhat exactly did Democrats think would happen?\nFor a year, Democratic prosecutors in one of the bluest states in the nation have worked overtime to bankrupt and imprison Donald Trump.\nThe civil fraud case against Trump, over loans he repaid in full, was bad. The felony indictment for misclassifying accounting records was worse , built on bizarre legal theories and the testimony of an admitted liar .\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\nWith the help of friendly judges, the prosecutors won both. Trump, the Republican leader and the favorite to beat the incumbent Democratic president in November, now faces nearly $500 million in fines and four years in prison – for “crimes” that can barely be explained.\nThis may be the law, but is not justice.\nAs a X post now viewed 73 million times put it :\nThe first felony conviction of a former US President wasn’t for the Iraq or Afghanistan wars, illegal CIA coups, drone striking weddings, or spying on Americans… It was because Trump misclassified a $130,000 payment for a porn star’s NDA [non-disclosure agreement].\nRepublicans are furious. Rightly.\nNow they are openly threatening to strike back. As the New York Times wrote [paywalled] this morning:\nRepublican allies of Donald J. Trump are calling for revenge prosecutions and other retaliatory measures against Democrats in response to his felony conviction in New York…\nG.O.P. leaders in and out of government have demanded that elected Republicans use every available instrument of power against Democrats, including targeted investigations and prosecutions.\nLike the Times or not, it has accurately summarized where we stand.\n—\nI understand the desire to escalate – for retribution, and theoretically deterrence too.\nBut this way lies madness.\nMore than madness. This way lies serious risks to the future of the United States.\nI don’t think I’m exaggerating.\nTrump was uniquely vulnerable. Even though he now lives in Florida, he was a New York resident for most of his life.\nBut what if local prosecutors find ways around the jurisdictional hurdles and succeed in hanging criminal indictments on out-of-state politicians from the other party? What if they succeed in winning convictions in front of friendly juries? (Mega-donors may be even more vulnerable, because of their second homes. Think of Californians with ranches in Wyoming, New Yorkers with Florida mansions. )\nThe logical next step will be for the defendants – now felons – to appeal to their home states for help in nullifying or refusing to recognize those convictions.\nWhen states will not even recognize each other’s basic legal authority, they are hardly part of a more perfect union.\n—\n(Turn that flag upside down)\n—\nThe law and politics have always been intertwined.\nPoliticians become lawmakers when they win, after all. And Republicans are at least partly to blame for escalating these games by impeaching Bill Clinton in 1998.\nBut no one can doubt what has happened to Donald Trump in New York represents a major escalation of what people on both sides are now calling lawfare.\nSo what happens now?\nIf Biden wins, Democrats and Republicans may well see the Democratic strategy as successful. Trump was leading before the verdict, after all. Republicans will be furious, Democrats triumphant. How will either side back down?\nAnd if Trump wins, he has already said he may use the Department of Justice aggressively against his opponents, potentially including Hillary Clinton and the Biden family.\nRead More @ alexberenson.substack.com",

Der Einsatz war minimal, der Gewinn überwältigend.\nMünchen – Als einziger deutschlandweit hatte ein Spieler am 9. Juli den Jackpot in der Gewinnklasse eins in der Zusatzlotterie Spiel 77 gewonnen. Mittlerweile hat sich der frisch gebackene Millionär bei der Lotterie- und Spielbankverwaltung gemeldet. Er kommt aus Oberbayern.\nMann aus Oberbayern knackt Jackpot – mit nur wenigen Euro Einsatz\nMit einem Einsatz von nur 6,25 Euro hatte der Mann aus Oberbayern einen Gewinn von 5.277.777 Euro gemacht, wie die Staatliche Lotterie- und Spielbankverwaltung in einer Mitteilung berichtete. Auf die Frage, wie es ihm gehe, antwortete er: „Mittlerweile wieder gut. Am Anfang war ich ziemlich überwältigt.“ Er spiele zwar regelmäßig Lotto 6aus49 oder Eurojackpot und kreuze auch oft die Zusatzlotterien an, aber dass er damit tatsächlich mal einen Millionengewinn erzielen würde, hätte er nie gedacht. Und lachend fügt er hinzu: „Meine Frau glaubt es immer noch nicht.“\n(Übrigens: Unser Bayern-Newsletter informiert Sie täglich über alle wichtigen Geschichten aus Bayern. Jetzt nach einer kurzen Registrierung bei unserem Medien-Login USER.ID anmelden.)\nAls nächstes steht natürlich die große Frage an, was er mit seinem Millionengewinn anfangen wird. „Da lassen wir uns jetzt ganz viel Zeit, nehmen Beratungen in Anspruch und überlegen gut, wie wir das Geld anlegen und welche Wünsche wir uns vielleicht erfüllen“, sagte der Glückspilz zu seinen Zukunftsplänen.",

    "text": "La Policía Federal Argentina (PFA) desplegó un total de 33 allanamientos en diferentes puntos del país, en el marco de la causa que investiga la transferencia de fondos públicos del ex Ministerio de Desarrollo de la Nación a distintas organizaciones sociales, por un valor de cinco mil millones de pesos, que fueron destinados a la confección de un millón y medio de guardapolvos. Se secuestró gran volumen de documentación. Entre las ciudades en donde hubo operativos, estuvo La Plata.\nEn la provincia de Buenos Aires, se hicieron procedimientos en Avellaneda, Dock Sud, Quilmes, Berazategui, Glew, Isidro Casanova, Matheu, Laferrere, Haedo, La Plata, Berisso, San Justo, José C. Paz, Los Toldos y Tandil.\nLas tareas investigativas fueron impulsadas por la Fiscalía Nacional en lo Criminal y Correccional N° 6 a cargo de Carlos Rívolo y encomendadas a la División Lavados de Activos, tras detectar que la mayoría de las cooperativas beneficiadas, no poseían capacidad operativa, recursos humanos, logística, ni espacio edilicio para la fabricación de las prendas.\nAsimismo, se estableció que en varios casos no se había efectuado la compra de materia prima para la confección y entrega de la indumentaria escolar en cuestión.\nCon la información obtenida por la PFA, el Juzgado Nacional en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal N° 11 a cargo de Julián Ercolini, Secretaría N° 22 de María Laura Charnis, ordenó un total 33 allanamientos en las provincias de Buenos Aires, Misiones y Entre Ríos, donde se logró secuestrar gran cantidad de documentación de interés vinculada con la causa.\nLos elementos secuestrados, quedaron a disposición del magistrado interventor, en actuaciones caratuladas “Defraudación contra la administración pública, Abuso de autoridad y Violación de los deberes de funcionario público”.\nLE PUEDE INTERESAR\nEntrevista | Mano a mano con el intendente de Magdalena Lisandro Hourcade\nLE PUEDE INTERESAR\n\"Una patada en la panza sabiendo que puedo estar embarazada\": se conocieron más chats de Fabiola Yañez\nLas noticias locales nunca fueron tan importantes\nSUSCRIBITE",
