    "text": "By Mike Rizzo ,\n2 hours ago\n\"\nStorm Watch Team Meteorologist Mike Rizzo says there are numerous heat advisories and heat warnings in effect across the state today for high heat and humidity creating feel like temperatures that exceed 100 degrees. It's another scorcher of a day with high temperatures pushing beyond 100 degrees. There's a better chance for thunderstorms today and Saturday with a piece of upper atmospheric energy aligning itself with the ground-level heat and humidity. Some thunderstorms may produce strong gusts upwards of 40 mph with lightning and downpours capable of producing brief flooding. The storms today arrive by 3 p.m. and move from northwest to southeast across the state. It will cross over the New Jersey Turnpike by 5 p.m. and reach the beaches by 6:30/7 p.m. The storms will exit and dissipate with the sunset by 9 p.m. Saturday is a repeat of today with the same chances for afternoon and evening storms. Sunday looks a bit better, with fewer storms and slightly cooler weather, but still very warm with highs in the upper 80s. Weather early next week looks good but the forecast for the late week is subject to change based on how a tropical disturbance develops over Florida this weekend. \" Expand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "The warmest December in Columbia County history",
    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Columbia County, Pennsylvania from 1901-2000 was 28.2. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Columbia County, Pennsylvania experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Columbia County, Pennsylvania history.",

    "text": "The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday filed a chargesheet against alleged Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) members Manpreet Singh alias Peeta and Mandeep Singh, who were recently deported from the Philippines at its instance.\nThe NIA has named the two as associates of Canada-based “listed individual terrorist” Arshdeep Singh alias Arsh Dalla, in its second supplementary chargesheet. “Dalla had recruited Peeta and Mandeep Singh, who were operating from the Philippines on his directions,” the NIA has said.\nThe NIA alleged that the two were actively involved in recruiting the youth into Dalla’s terror and crime syndicate. “They were playing a vital role in the larger terror conspiracy against India by raising funds for the proscribed terrorist organisation, KTF, through large-scale extortions in India, and channelling that money into drug and other businesses and trades and to various countries through the ‘hawala’ network. They were involved in smuggling arms and ammunition from Pakistan into the Indian territory,” said the NIA.\nThe agency said that Dalla, in collusion with Peeta, had recruited criminal elements and terror operatives and formed a full-fledged syndicate in Punjab. They targeted businessmen, high net-worth individuals and professionals, terrorised them by opening fire in front of their houses and extorted protection money from them. The extortion money was sent to various foreign countries through banking and non-banking channels, it is alleged.\nIn July and November last year, the NIA had filed chargesheets against 13 accused persons. The probe against 10 other accused and their aides, who are associates with Babbar Khalsa International and KTF, is in progress.\nCOMMents\nSHARE\nCopy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",
