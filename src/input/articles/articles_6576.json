    "text": "When an Indonesian mother dropped off her daughter at school in May, she did not expect her to become violently sick after eating lunch from the government's new billion-dollar free meal programme.\"My daughter had a stomachache, diarrhoea, and a headache,\" the woman told AFP on condition of anonymity about the incident in the Javan city of Bandung.\"She also couldn't stop vomiting until three in the morning.\"Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto touted the populist scheme as a solution to the high rates of stunted growth among children, as he carved his way to a landslide election victory last year.But its rollout since January has stumbled from crisis to crisis, including accusations of nepotism, funding delays, protests and a spate of food poisonings.It was slated to reach as many as 17.5 million children this year to the tune of $4.3 billion.But so far it has only served five million students nationwide from January to mid-June, according to the finance ministry.The poisoning issues were not isolated to that girl's school -- five others reported similar incidents.But Prabowo has lauded the number of illnesses as a positive.\"Indeed there was a poisoning today, around 200 people out of three million,\" he said in May.\"Over five were hospitalised, so that means the success rate is 99.99 percent. A 99.99 percent success rate in any field is a good thing.\"Large-scale aid programmes in Indonesia have a history of allegations of graft at both the regional and national levels.Experts say this programme is particularly vulnerable, with little in the way of accountability.\"A big budget means the possibility of corruption is wide open, and with lax monitoring, corruption can happen,\" said Egi Primayogha, a researcher at Indonesia Corruption Watch.\"Since the beginning, the programme was rushed, without any good planning. There is no transparency.\"The programme was rolled out soon after Prabowo took office in October and local investigative magazine Tempo reported that \"several partners appointed\" were Prabowo supporters in the election.Agus Pambagio, a Jakarta-based public policy expert, said Prabowo rushed the plan, with critics saying there was little public consultation.\"Japan and India have been doing it for decades. If we want to do it just like them within a few months, it's suicide,\" he said.\"We can't let fatalities happen.\"The plan's stated aim is to combat stunting, which affects more than 20 percent of the country's children, and reduce that rate to five percent by 2045.Prabowo's administration has allocated $0.62 per meal and initially set a budget of 71 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion) for this year.But authorities have been accused of delays and under-funding the programme.A catering business in capital Jakarta had to temporarily shut down in March because the government had not paid the $60,000 it was owed. The case went viral and it eventually got its money back.The government announced a $6.2 billion budget boost recently but revised it by half as problems mounted in its ambitious quest to deliver meals to almost 83 million people by 2029.Widespread cuts to fund the programme's large budget also sparked protests across Indonesian cities in February.Yet some say the programme has benefited their child.\"It's quite helpful. I still give my son pocket money, but since he got free lunch, he could save that money,\" Reni Parlina, 46, told AFP.However a May survey by research institute Populix found more than 83 percent of 4,000 respondents think the policy should be reviewed.\"If necessary, the programme should be suspended until a thorough evaluation is carried out,\" said Egi.The National Nutrition Agency, tasked with overseeing free meal distribution, did not respond to an AFP request for comment.The agency has said it will evaluate the scheme and has trained thousands of kitchen staff.Kitchen partners say they are taking extra precautions too.\"We keep reminding our members to follow food safety protocols,\" said Sam Hartoto of the Indonesian Catering Entrepreneurs Association, which has 100 members working with the government.While they seek to provide assurances, the debacles have spooked parents who doubt Prabowo's government can deliver.\"I don't find this programme useful. It poses more risks than benefits,\" said the mother of the sick girl.\"I don't think this programme is running well.\"© Copyright AFP 2024. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Pakistan: Hardliners Take To Streets Against 'Blasphemy' By Nation's Chief Justice",
    "text": "- By Reuters - Published: Fri, 23 Feb 2024 04:27 PM (IST) - Source:REUTERS Hundreds of supporters from Pakistani Islamist parties on Friday rallied to protest against what they say were blasphemous remarks by the country's chief justice. The protest call, by various religious and political groups led by hardline Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) whose rallying cry is \"death to blasphemers\", said that remarks by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa in a case against a member of the minority Ahmadi community were blasphemous. The court had granted bail to an Ahmadi community member earlier this week, ruling that blasphemy charges against him did not stand. The man, accused of blasphemy for distributing Islamic literature, had been in jail for 13 months. \"We (will) monitor the sermons and protests outside mosques,\" said police official Abrar Hussain in southern city of Karahci, warning the protesters to remain peaceful. Hundreds of the protesters took to streets in the northwestern city of Peshawar, chanting slogans against the chief justice, said police official Mubarak Khan. The top court on Thursday issued a statement after the Islamist parties and some political groups launched a campaign accusing the chief justice of deviating in his ruling from the constitutional definition of a Muslim, which excludes Ahmadis. \"This impression is absolutely wrong,\" the court statement said, deploring what it called a \"vicious campaign\" against Isa. The campaign against Isa was also joined by some supporters and aides of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who think a ruling by the chief justice stripping Khan's party of its symbol on ballots cost them votes in an election on February 8. Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party's information secretary Rauf Hasan did not respond to a request for a comment. Human rights groups say Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores, and just accusing someone of such a crime could lead to mob justice. Judges hesitate to take up such cases for fear of retribution, which leaves accused languishing in jail for years without cases being heard. Blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan. No one has been executed by the state for it, but numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs.
