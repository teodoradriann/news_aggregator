    "title": "Vietnam veteran’s Medal of Honor to be permanently displayed at Veterans Memorial Museum in Chehalis",
    "text": "Franklin D. Miller, or “Dean,” as he was known to his unit during the Vietnam War, was a U.S. Army command sergeant major who was awarded the Medal of Honor on June 5, 1971, by former President Richard Nixon. He was given the Medal of Honor for his actions during a battle on Jan. 5, 1970, while deployed in Vietnam, Veterans Memorial Museum Executive Director Chip Duncan said. Now, 54 years to the day after the battle, Miller’s Medal of Honor will be delivered by his daughter, Danielle Keller, of Portland, during a ceremony to the Veterans Memorial Museum in Chehalis, where it will be permanently displayed. The ceremony will begin at 1 p.m. on Jan. 5, 2024, at the museum, located at 100 SW Veterans Way in Chehalis. Along with Keller, the ceremony will also feature Skip Ettinger, a lifelong friend of Miller’s; retired U.S. Army Colonel Rick Thomas, former commander of the 1st Special Forces Group at Fort Lewis; and U.S. Army Master Sergeant Earl Plumlee, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for actions while deployed in Afghanistan in 2013. “Skip is here in Washington state, and he learned that Danielle was, instead of leaving it in a closet or a box, looking for a place to display the Medal of Honor,“ Duncan told The Chronicle on Dec. 28. Duncan has been working with Keller and Ettinger for three years in an effort to get a display set up for Miller’s Medal of Honor. Miller, a staff sergeant and a member of the U.S. Army’s 5th Special Forces Group at the time, specialized in reconnaissance patrols. On Jan. 5, 1970, he was a team leader for a joint American-Vietnamese unit on a long-range reconnaissance patrol deep within enemy territory. After leaving a helicopter intersection point on the patrol, one of Miller’s unit members tripped an explosive enemy booby trap, wounding four members of his patrol. Miller quickly administered first aid and moved his unit into a defensible position, as he knew the explosion alerted nearby Vietcong fighters. Once his unit was secure in a defensible position, Miller went out alone to face what he estimated to be a platoon-sized enemy force — between 20 and 50 soldiers — approaching his unit’s position. He single-handedly repulsed two initial enemy attacks before rejoining his unit and calling for a helicopter extraction for his men. However, the only suitable extraction point was a bomb crater some 150 meters from his unit’s position. Miller scouted a route to the crater and led his men through the jungle to it, but as the helicopter hovered over the crater to extract them, the Vietcong launched another attack against Miller’s unit, causing the helicopter to leave. The enemy’s attack continued, leaving Miller heavily wounded. Only two other men in his patrol survived. Despite the Vietcong’s persistence, Miller continued to repel enemy advances until a friendly relief force reached their position to provide assistance. “Miller's gallantry, intrepidity in action, and selfless devotion to the welfare of his comrades are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the U.S. Army,” reads Miller’s Medal of Honor citation. Miller died June 30, 2000, in Florida. Those looking to learn more about Miller can read his book, “Reflections of a Warrior: Six Years as a Green Beret in Vietnam,” available from Amazon and other online retailers.

O Mais Querido enfrenta o Volta Redonda neste sábado (25), pela quinta rodada do Campeonato Carioca. O Rubro-Negro, inclusive, pode ter um reforço de peso para o duelo do final de semana.\nIsso porque Arrascaeta treinou normalmente nos últimos dias no Centro de Treinamento Ninho do Urubu. O meio campista fez atividades ao lado do elenco rubro-negro e tem grandes chances de estrear no sábado (25), contra o Volta Redonda, pelo Carioca.\nARRASCAETA NÃO JOGOU CONTRA O SÃO PAULO Vale lembrar que Arrascaeta não participou do amistoso entre Flamengo e São Paulo nos Estados Unidos, pela FC Series. O atleta acompanhou a partida do camarote, visto que ainda não tinha condições físicas de estar em campo.\nNa ocasião, inclusive, Arrascaeta assistiu ao jogo do Flamengo contra o São Paulo ao lado de um dos grandes atacantes do século. Trata-se de Luis Suárez. O centroavante uruguaio atua pelo Inter Miami (EUA) e aproveitou para ir ao estádio acompanhar o clássico interestadual.\nNOVO CAMISA 10 Um ponto importante a ser destacado é que Arrascaeta é o novo camisa 10 do Flamengo . O número ficou vago após Gabigol ser punido pela antiga gestão e, agora, pertence ao meio campista uruguaio. Ou seja, o atleta pode estrear a nova numeração neste sábado (25).",

    "title": "NTSB Urges Boeing and FAA to Address Potential Rudder System Jam on 737NG and MAX Aircraft",
    "text": "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has issued urgent safety recommendations to The Boeing Company and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after discovering a potential rudder control system malfunction on Boeing 737NG and 737MAX aircraft. The issue stems from faulty Collins Aerospace SVO-730 rudder rollout guidance actuators , which could lead to rudder system jams or restrictions during critical flight phases.\nThe investigation was initiated after a February 6, 2024, incident involving a United Airlines 737-8 (MAX) at Newark Liberty International Airport . During the landing rollout, the rudder pedals became stuck in the neutral position, forcing the flight crew to use nosewheel steering to maintain control. Although no injuries or damage occurred, subsequent testing of the actuator revealed that moisture inside the unit could freeze and impair rudder movement.\nOver 350 Boeing Aircraft Affected Tests conducted by the NTSB and Collins Aerospace found that 353 actuators , delivered to Boeing since 2017, had a manufacturing flaw in the assembly of a sealed bearing. This flaw makes the actuators susceptible to moisture ingress, which can freeze in cold temperatures, limiting the rudder’s functionality. The malfunction is particularly concerning for Category IIIB approach and landing operations , where precise rudder control is essential.\nThe current Boeing flight manual instructs pilots to apply maximum force to overcome a rudder jam. However, the NTSB warns that this could result in undesired rudder deflection , potentially leading to runway departure or loss of control during landing. The NTSB has called on Boeing to revise these procedures and provide alternate methods to handle such situations.\nFAA Urged to Act In its recommendations, the NTSB urged the FAA to determine whether affected actuators should be removed from service and replaced with compliant units. The NTSB also called on the FAA to notify international aviation regulators about the issue, encouraging them to take similar action to ensure the safety of Boeing 737NG and 737MAX operators worldwide.\nThe NTSB Aviation Investigation Report AIR-24-06 provides further details on the findings and recommendations. As the investigation continues, the NTSB may issue additional updates.\nBoeing and the FAA have yet to provide a timeline for the replacement of affected actuators, but the NTSB’s recommendations are considered urgent due to the potential safety risks posed by the malfunctioning rudder control system.",

    "text": "Former acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal unleashed on the\nSupreme Court for helping out Donald Trump by delaying his immunity case as long as possible.\n\"We will have opinions tomorrow, and we will have opinions next week, and in particular, we're waiting on, I think, two really important opinions,\" Katyal explained on MSNBC after Thursday's rulings were released.\n\"One is one that we've all been talking about: is Donald Trump absolutely\nimmune from the criminal laws, something I wouldn't think you would need a Supreme Court to answer, but nonetheless, here we are,\" Katyal said. \"The second is this case about so-called deference, two cases which is about the rules that govern you and me and everything from climate regulation to food and drug rules to tobacco and the like.\" Read Also: 8 ways convicted felon Donald Trump doesn't become president\nHe fears that the Court will \"radically reshape the law\" in that case that will dilute the government's power to regulate corporations.\nAnthony Coley, former chief spokesperson for Attorney General Merrick Garland, called the delay \"really unusual\" but explained, \"The delay is the decision we've been waiting for.\"\n\"We can have an honest conversation about whether or not the delay is intentional or not. I happen to think it is intentional, but the effect is the same, and that is keeping Donald Trump from facing criminal accountability before this election, and not just the Supreme Court election interference case but also the classified documents case down in Florida,\" Coley continued.\nHe went on to say that prosecutors win over 90 percent of the cases having to do with classified documents because evidence is generally overwhelming. That is the case with Trump, Coley said.\n\"I mean, we know that Donald Trump told his attorney general to just say that the election was stolen and let him and the GOP congressmen just handle the rest,\" Coley recalled. \"We know that there are audio recordings of this president on the phone with the Republican secretary of state just saying just find one more vote than would be needed so that Donald Trump could declare victory in the state of Georgia.\"\nYet, the Supreme Court is shielding Trump from \"facing criminal accountability in both [cases] because the Supreme Court and the federal district court and the southern district of Florida are dragging their feet, and I happen to think that's intentional.\"\nSee the full discussion in the\nvideo below or at the link here.\nLegal expert blasts Supreme Court for intentionally delaying longer just to help Trump\nwww.youtube.com",

Picurelli - jueves, 17 de julio de 2025 En el segundo trimestre de 2025 en comparación con 2024, también se produce una caída de oferta de vivienda a nivel provincial de un 28% Imagen de archivo de dos operarios trabajando en una obra en la capital albacetense. - Foto: Rubén Serrallé Un informe del portal idealista muestra que la oferta de viviendas en venta se ha reducido un 20% durante el segundo trimestre de 2025, en comparación con el mismo trimestre de 2024, a nivel nacional.Todas las capitales tienen ahora menos viviendas en venta que hace un año y Albacete es la cuarta capital con mayor descenso con un 41% menos de viviendas en venta. Sólo están por encima Segovia y Ciudad Real, con un desplome de la oferta en ambos casos del 45% y Oviedo con una caída del 44%. A nivel provincial la caída de oferta es de un 28%.Juan Pedro Delicado, presidente de Apeca señala al respecto que «no sólo se está construyendo menos, se va a construir menos aún. No hay mano de obra para realizar lo que se quiere construir, es imposible y de ahí que sigan subiendo los precios».Mejorar la oferta de vivienda es complicado según el presidente de Apeca, pues el sector de la construcción «desde que hubo la crisis tan importante mucha mano de obra salió de la construcción y se dedicó a hostelería u otras cosas. Esos trabajadores ya no han vuelto al gremio». Además narra que en la actualidad «la gente joven no nos ve como el sector en el que quieren empezar a trabajar. La construcción ha evolucionado mucho por el tema de maquinaria, condiciones de trabajo, horarios, incluso el salario creo que está bien para poder vivir. Ya no se suele trabajar sábados y domingos, las jornadas han pasado de lunes a viernes, también a jueves en algunos sitios. Aún así el sector para la gente joven no es atractivo».Delicado avisa de que pueden venir tiempos peores, ya que «como no se potencie el tema de la mano de obra joven, la construcción se ve abocada a un problema enorme, porque generación actual se está jubilando, es la última que tenemos y no hay renovación de plantilla». Desde Apeca se trabaja con planes de formación, estudios y convenios con empresas para intentar revitalizar el sector.

    "text": "Illustrative photo (Photo: Getty Images)\nThe Russian Federation is preparing another powerful information-psychological campaign. It will be using the theme of presidential elections, according to the press service of the Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.\nIn mid-December 2023, a meeting of the so-called Institute of CIS Countries took place in Moscow. The institute, in turn, is under the control of the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and is financed from the budget of the terrorist country. The topic of the gathering was the war against Ukraine.\nDuring the discussion, experts concluded that Ukrainian military command supposedly shifted to a positional defense with the aim of:\ndisrupting the Russian advance in winter and spring of 2024; strengthening defensive lines; enhancing the air defense system; accumulating ammunition; forming a combat-ready reserve.\nRussian experts are convinced that this scenario will prevent further occupation of Ukraine by forceful means.\n“As a result, in Kremlin circles, emphasis was placed on the inadmissibility of any cessation of hostilities, Ukraine retaining access to the Black Sea, and the existence of a ‘pro-Western regime’ in Kyiv,” wrote the Ukrainian military intelligence.\nDuring the meeting, calls for another psychological campaign against the top military-political leadership of Ukraine regarding the presidential elections were echoed.\n“The goal of the campaign is to undermine the legitimacy of the President of Ukraine and the leadership of our state among countries that supposedly are allies and partners of Russia, and – if successful – among Ukrainian citizens,” explained the intelligence.\nPresidential elections in Ukraine\nPresidential elections in Ukraine were scheduled for late March 2024, but due to martial law, their conduct is prohibited by law.\nAs early as August, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy admitted that the government could change legislation on this issue, but only if the U.S. and Europe agreed to meet several conditions.\nAt the same time, the advisor to the head of the Presidential Office, Mykhailo Podolyak, explained the reasons why holding elections in Ukraine was impossible.",

    "text": "In fact, taking Wegovy and Ozempic resulted in reduced risk of suicide ideation, compared to non-semaglutide drugs, researchers from Case Western Reserve University found.\nResearchers examined electronic health data on 240,258 U.S. patients prescribed Wegovy or other drugs for weight loss and about 1.6 million people taking Ozempic or other drugs for type 2 diabetes.\nAt 6 months, people taking Wegovy had a 73% lower risk of first-time suicidal ideation and a 56% lower risk of recurrent suicidal ideation, compared to users of other weight loss drugs, the study said.\nPeople taking Ozempic had a 64% and a 49% lower risk of first-time and recurrent suicide ideation, respectively, compared to people taking other drugs.\nThe study is significant because the FDA said this week that it is investigating reports that people who took those drugs had suicidal thoughts or two other health problems.\n“These findings provide evidence that semaglutide, which helps regulate appetite and insulin levels by targeting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors (GLP1R) in the body, does not appear to increase the risk of suicidal ideation, contrary to the claims of some anecdotal reports,” the National Institutes of Health said in a media advisory published Friday. “Outside of anecdotal and case reports, this association had not yet been explored by comprehensive studies.”\nThe National Institutes of Health backed the study done by Case Western researchers.\nCase Western researchers said they launched their study after European health regulators announced last summer that they were studying reports linking semaglutide and suicidal ideation.\n“The exploding popularity of this drug makes it imperative to understand all its potential complications,” study co-author Pamela Davis, MD, PhD, of Case Western Reserve School of Medicine said in a statement. “It’s important to know that prior suggestions that the drug might trigger suicidal thoughts is not borne out in this very large and diverse population in the U.S.”",
