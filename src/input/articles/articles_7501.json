    "text": "Spirit Halloween's Charitable Foundation Donates Over $46,000 to Shriners Children's Hospital On Thursday, Spirit Halloween's charitable foundation, Spirit of Children, presented $46,702 to Shriners Children's Erie. Stores in Erie, Pennsylvania, Ashtabula, Ohio and Lakewood, New York contributed their donations to benefit the Shriners Child Life Department. In addition, the donations help supply some of the toys that are used in the hospital. They are used to make children's visits less stressful and more enjoyable. The foundation also donates costumes for the hospital's trunk-or-treat event. Kristin Maguire, Child Life Specialist, says, \"at our trunk-or-treat event, and it allows us to see kids, just being kids, without the disability or without the injury, and it's just a great event for everyone.\" Next year, Spirit of Children hopes to raise over $50,000. \"We have an amazing team here in this market, and they really put everything they have into this program, it's the heart of our company, and it's the best part of our job,\" says Ashleigh Lang, Spirit Halloween's Regional Zone Manager.",

READ: [Defense chief says PH 'not stirring up trouble' in WPS](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2023/9/27/teodoro-trouble-wps.html) Wu also called the country's resupply mission to Ayungin Shoal a \"deliberate move to create an incident, play victim and make a show,\" adding that the supply vessels carried many journalists and propagated disinformation regarding the geopolitical conflict. Earlier this month, the China Coast Guard (CCG) once again blasted with water cannon a Philippine commissioned vessel on its way for a resupply mission.

China also continued to deny pointing a military-grade laser at a Philippine vessel in February this year. \"This is [an] entirely groundless accusation. China has no intention or necessity to use such devices,\" the spokesperson said.

    "text": "India News\nOperation Jal Rahat 2: Indian Army Launches Massive Relief Ops Amid Rains In Himachal, North East\nAs torrential rains trigger floods and landslides across Himachal Pradesh and the North East, the Indian Army has launched massive relief and rescue operations, emerging as the nation's first responder in the crisis.\nAs torrential rains trigger floods and landslides across Himachal Pradesh and the North East, the Indian Army has launched massive relief and rescue operations, emerging as the nation's first responder in the crisis.\nAs relentless monsoon rains continue to batter parts of Himachal Pradesh and the North Eastern states, the Indian Army has stepped up as the nation's first responder, launching large-scale relief and rescue operations across multiple disaster-hit zones. From the flood-ravaged villages of Mandi district in Himachal to submerged localities in Nagaland, Assam and Manipur, Army columns are working day and night to deliver critical humanitarian aid and ensure no one is left behind.\nIn Himachal Pradesh, the Army has mobilised relief teams in the worst-affected areas of Mandi district, where landslides and flash floods have cut off entire villages. Army columns are currently active in Thunag, Bagsiad, and Pandoh, coordinating closely with the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and local authorities. On July 6, a vital mule track between Bagsiad and Thunag—essential for reaching stranded communities—was successfully cleared by Army personnel. This has enabled the steady delivery of food, medical aid, and relief kits to families in need.\nMedical assistance camps have been set up in Thunag, where Army medical teams are providing first aid and essential healthcare services to affected locals. Relief materials are also being distributed to remote villages such as Degi, Rushad, and Chapad, which had remained inaccessible for days following the disaster. Aid reached Degi on July 7, Rushad on July 8, and Chapad on July 9, marking significant milestones in the outreach effort.\nCommunication remains a challenge in some of these remote pockets, especially in Thunag, where mobile networks are weak or absent. To ensure operational coordination is not disrupted, the Army has deployed high-reliability satellite communication systems, including ISAT phones and HX terminals, enabling real-time updates and rapid coordination with civil authorities.\nIn a major development today, the Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh is scheduled to visit Thunag to personally assess the situation and interact with relief workers and affected families. Simultaneously, the Brigade Commander leading Army operations in the region will visit Mandi to review the ground situation, meet with relief teams, and hold strategic discussions with the Chief Minister and Deputy Commissioner to further streamline relief efforts.\nMeanwhile, in India’s North East, the Army has activated ‘Operation Jal Rahat 2’ following widespread flooding caused by heavy rains. The operation is being spearheaded by Headquarters Inspector General Assam Rifles (North), with coordinated deployment in Nagaland, Assam, and Manipur. In Dimapur, Nagaland, the Deputy Commissioner formally requisitioned Army assistance on July 10 after floods inundated Singrijan Colony, one of the worst-hit areas. The Army promptly deployed an Engineer Task Force, which began relief work immediately. Although a verbal de-requisition was later communicated by civil authorities, Army teams remain on high alert, with resources fully mobilised and on standby.\nIn Assam’s Golaghat district, the Dhansiri River breached its danger mark earlier this week, prompting heightened vigilance. Although water levels are now slowly receding, the Army continues to monitor the situation closely and is prepared to launch rescue operations at short notice. In Manipur, rising water levels in the Nambol River have impacted several parts of Imphal West and Bishnupur districts. Army relief teams have been working in close coordination with local officials to evacuate affected residents and provide medical assistance and food supplies.\nAs of July 10, the Army has deployed 40 relief columns across the North East—24 primary columns and 16 in reserve. These teams have already rescued over 3,820 individuals, distributed more than 1,361 food packets, delivered medical assistance to over 2,000 people, and supplied nearly 15,500 bottles of drinking water.\nIn both Himachal and the North East, the Indian Army’s efforts have proven vital in preventing further loss of life and bringing relief to thousands. The swift deployment, logistical coordination, and unwavering commitment shown by the Army reflect its indispensable role not only as the nation’s military force but also as a pillar of humanitarian support during natural disasters.\nSenior defence officials have reiterated the Army’s resolve to stand with the people during times of crisis. “We are here to serve, always—whether in war or in disaster,” one officer said. “From mountain passes to floodplains, our mission remains the same: to protect and assist our fellow citizens.”\nAs climate-related disasters become more frequent and severe, the Indian Army’s capacity for rapid humanitarian response continues to set a benchmark for efficiency, discipline, and national service.\nRishabh Madhavendra Pratap author\nRishabh Madhavendra Pratap is Principal Correspondent for diplomatic, foreign and defence developments at Times Network.

    "title": "Why the UK is set to fully ban disposable vapes",
    "text": "ALBAWABA - The government of the United Kingdom has declared that it intends to prohibit the sale of single-use vapes in England and Wales beginning in June of the next year, with Scotland delaying its earlier announced ban to align with them, BBC reports. Vape use in England has increased by more than 400% between the years 2012 and 2023, according to the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra). Currently, 9% of the general population in the United Kingdom is purchasing and using vape items. The sale of single-use vapes will be prohibited as part of the British government's efforts to curb the negative impact that vaping has on the environment and the increasing prevalence of vaping among minors. While it is against the law to offer electronic cigarettes that contain nicotine to anyone who is younger than 18 years old. A poll conducted in 2024 by the health organization ASH found that around one in five youngsters between the ages of 11 and 17 had experimented with vaping. Over the last several years, there has been a significant rise in the number of individuals who vape without ever having smoked, with young adults being the primary drivers of this upward trend. The effect that disposable vapes have on the environment has also been a significant factor in the decision to prohibit them. It is estimated by the UK government that approximately 5 million single-use vapes are thrown away on the ground or discarded under general garbage every single week, Reuters reports. Vapes that contained a total of more than forty tons of lithium were wasted in the year 2022, according to Dafra. This amount of lithium was sufficient to power five thousand electric automobiles. In addition, the Labour administration intends to impose a complete smoking bill as part of what it has referred to as \"the biggest public health intervention in a generation\" in order to prevent young people from developing a dependency on nicotine. Andrew Gwynne, minister for public health and prevention said “Banning disposable vapes will not only protect the environment, but importantly reduce the appeal of vapes to children and keep them out of the hands of vulnerable young people.”",
