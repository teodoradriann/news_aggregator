    "title": "Krasser Wandel: So sah Melanie Müller ohne Schönheits-Operationen aus",
    "text": "Krasser Wandel: So sah Melanie Müller vor ihren Schönheits-OP's aus\nMelanie Müller gehört zu den Reality-Stars, die kaum jemand übersehen kann. Doch wer sie heute sieht, erkennt die einst natürliche Blondine kaum wieder. Ihr Weg vom „Bachelor“-Girl zur polarisierenden Ballermann-Sängerin ist gespickt mit TV-Erfolgen, Schlagzeilen – und zahlreichen Beauty-Eingriffen.\nSo mauserte sich Melanie Müller vom Mauerblümchen ins Rampenlicht\nGeboren 1988 in Oschatz, absolvierte Melanie Müller zunächst eine Ausbildung zur Restaurantfachfrau. Doch schnell zog es sie in die Öffentlichkeit. Erste Erfahrungen sammelte sie als Erotikmodell und unter Pseudonym auch in Pornofilmen. 2013 wagte sie den Schritt ins Fernsehen – in der RTL-Kuppelshow „Der Bachelor“ kämpfte sie um das Herz von Jan Kralitschka und schaffte es bis ins Finale. Diese Auftritte öffneten ihr die Tür in die Welt der Reality-Shows.\nKarriere-Boost durch das Dschungelcamp\nNur ein Jahr später folgte der große Durchbruch: Melanie Müller zog ins Dschungelcamp – und holte sich 2014 die Krone. Seitdem gehört sie fest zum deutschen Reality-Kosmos. Melanie Müller startete eine Karriere als Schlagersängerin auf Mallorca, eröffnete kurzzeitig eine Boutique und betrieb einen Online-Shop für Erotikartikel. 2021 krönte sie ihre TV-Laufbahn mit dem Sieg bei „Promi Big Brother“. Privat wurde sie Mutter von zwei Kindern, trennte sich 2021 von Ehemann Mike Blümer und lebt heute mit neuem Partner Andreas Kunz.\nBeauty-Transformation von Melanie Müller: Was hat sich verändert?\nWer alte Fotos von Melanie Müller sieht, erkennt ein völlig anderes Gesicht: natürliche Konturen, kaum Make-up. Heute präsentiert sie sich mit markanten Wangenknochen, voluminösen Lippen und straffem Look. Grund dafür sind zahlreiche Beauty-Eingriffe, zu denen sie offen steht. Neben mehreren Brustvergrößerungen ließ sie ihre Nase korrigieren, Filler und Botox anwenden, eine Augenlidstraffung durchführen und unterzog sich sogar Vampir-Liftings. Auf Social Media zeigt sie stolz die Ergebnisse, bezeichnete ihren „wachen Blick“ als Erfolg.\nHeute: Schlagzeilen, Ballermann und Skandale\nMelanie Müller ist nach wie vor auf Mallorca und in deutschen TV-Formaten präsent. Neben ihrer Musik sorgt sie immer wieder für Aufsehen – etwa mit dem Skandal um einen Hitlergruß bei einem Konzert, der zu einem hohen Bußgeld für Melanie Müller führte. Zudem machte sie 2022 einen Schlaganfall öffentlich. Trotz Kritik an ihrem veränderten Aussehen bleibt sie sich treu: polarisierend, laut und ein fester Bestandteil der Reality-Szene.",

    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.

Mediante un video publicado en sus redes sociales, Fernández González aprovechó la fecha para señalar que la administración del emecista comete una “inocentada” contra la ciudadanía, ya que, lejos de aprovechar la reducción en la movilidad, propia de los últimos días del año, los trabajadores que llevan a cabo los proyectos optaron por no presentarse a laborar. Parece una inocentada lo que pasa en el Centro de [#Monterrey]con las obras del Centro. Un alcalde ausente, un gobierno ausente y funcionarios ausentes. Ahí les encargo la saturación de la vialidad.

Fernández afirmó que la administración del alcalde, así cómo el resto de las autoridades municipales, se encuentran ausentes y sin rendir cuentas a la ciudadanía, quienes son los verdaderos afectados por el retraso en los proyectos. “Y eso sí, después del 2 (de enero), vamos a ver la saturación de la vialidad porque, simple y sencillamente, se abandonaron las obras que por anécdota se pusieron a hacer, muy mal lo que está sucediendo en Monterrey”, concluyó el morenista.

En la zona también pueden apreciarse montañas de escombro, zanjas abiertas (cubiertas apenas por trozos de madera) y aditamentos de construcción que pudieran provocar una caída a quien pase por el rumbo sin prestar atención, especialmente por la noche. El proyecto cuenta ya con tres meses de retraso y, de acuerdo con el propio alcalde, las obras no han podido ser concluidas debido al retraso de constructores que realizan adecuaciones de tubería para suministro de agua.",

    "title": "Alabama Set To Execute Kenneth Eugene Smith By Nitrogen Hypoxia In January",
    "text": "The state of Alabama will execute an inmate using a gas chamber in January, the first time such a method will be used in decades for execution in the United States. Kenneth Eugene Smith was convicted in 1988 of murdering Elizabeth Sennett as part of a murder-for-hire scheme ordered by her husband, Pastor Charles Sennett, according to NBC News. After an attempt to execute him by lethal injection in November 2022 failed due to the absence of a suitable vein, the state announced that it would execute him by use of a gas chamber, where he would die by inhalation of nitrogen hypoxia amid a lack of oxygen, with such a method being employed for the first time in the state’s history. Read: Florida Death Row Inmate Michael Duane Zack’s Last Words Before Execution “I Love You All” “The fact that they’ve got me lined up to be the first with gas is really terrifying,” Smith told NBC News via telephone from prison. “Yeah, it’s surreal to be in this position.” Nitrogen hypoxia was first approved by Alabama for executions in 2018, joining the states of Oklahoma and Mississippi, though neither has ever employed the method to execute death row inmates, NBC reported. A gas chamber was last used for an execution in the United States in 1999, where German national Walter LaGrand was executed by state authorities in Arizona. “I mean, you can’t really test it on nobody, but I just hope they get it right this time,” said Michael Sennett, the son of Elizabeth Sennett, who supports Smith’s execution, to NBC News. “It doesn’t matter to me how he goes out, so long as he goes.” Smith has told reporters that he does not know the protocol for his execution, though his lawyers and medical team toured the gas chamber where he will die earlier in December. His spiritual adviser, Reverend Jeff Hood, meanwhile, filed a lawsuit against the state challenging the procedure on First Amendment grounds, claiming that the gas chamber’s prevention of his presence within three feet of Smith violates his religious liberty. Read: Darryl Barwick Becomes 3rd Florida Death Row Inmate Executed This Year Some physicians have expressed concerns about the use of gas, which may threaten others witnessing the execution. Joel Zivot, an anesthesiologist and intensive care physician at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, told NBC News that “[t]here is no room for error … gas will go wherever it wants to go, wherever there are places for it to go.” Smith and two other persons were paid $1,000 by Charles Sennett to kill his wife, Elizabeth, so he could collect a life insurance policy in her name, and she was stabbed and beaten to death in her home, NBC reported. In 1996, he was sentenced to death by the trial judge in his case, even as the jury voted 11-1 to impose a life sentence. Android Users, Click To Download The Free Press App And Never Miss A Story.

    "text": "La Asamblea Legislativa aprobó en su plenaria del miércoles una ley especial y transitoria para compensar económicamente a los trabajadores del Ministerio de Cultura que perderán su trabajo por el traspaso de administración de dos parques para el rubro de Turismo.\nActualmente es el ministerio de Cultura quien administra el Parque Infantil de Diversiones y el Parque Saburo Hirao, pero aprobaron que sean administrados por las carteras del gobierno a cargo de los espacios turísticos como el Ministerio de Turismo (MITUR), el Instituto Salvadoreño del Turismo (ISTU) y la Corporación Salvadoreña de Turismo.\nLEA: Dirección dentro de la Presidencia autorizará intervenciones en bienes culturales\nEl monto de la prestación será fijado en relación con la antigüedad y al último salario devengado por el trabajador despedido, en el mes inmediato anterior al que entre en vigencia el decreto legislativo.\nLas personas que recibirán la prestación por su despido, no podrán reingresar a laborar en el sector público.\n“El personal permanente cuya plaza sea suprimida, recibirá una indemnización económica equivalente al cien por ciento de su salario, por cada año laborado o fracción que exceda de seis meses, cualquiera que sea el tiempo de servicio que tengan, siendo el monto máximo a pagar en concepto de indemnización veinte mil dólares, salvo los casos en que deba pagarse al trabajador lo correspondiente a la garantía sindical”, establece el decreto.\nAdemás, el decreto establece que el monto estará exento del descuento del Impuesto sobre la Renta, así como de cualquier otro tipo de descuento, excepto el referido a cuota alimenticia (en caso estuviera vigente).\nLa compensación deberá ser cancelada en un máximo de seis pagos, iniciando el primer pago a los 30 días hábiles posteriores a la entrada en vigencia del decreto.\n“Será indispensable para realizar el pago de esta compensación, que el beneficiario haya presentado informe total de finalización de sus funciones a más tardar el quince de julio del corriente año”, establece el decreto.\nLa compensación económica a la que se refiere este decreto será financiada mediante refuerzo presupuestario, pero no se especificó el origen de los fondos para dicho refuerzo.\nCambio de las Casas de la Cultura y CUBOS\nSegún el oficialismo existe la necesidad de generar un nuevo modelo con “presencia eficiente y eficaz” de manera que se cumpla con el acceso a bienes y servicios culturales a la población.\n“Debe transitar del modelo actual de las Casas de la Cultura a un modelo dinámico que tome en cuenta a los Centros Urbanos de Bienestar y Oportunidades (CUBO), centros culturales, bibliotecas, galerías urbanas, centros comunitarios locales que atiendan a la realidad de El Salvador”, señala la propuesta.\nTras ello, derogaron las funciones de las Casas de la Cultura.\nPara diciembre de 2023 el gobierno ya había cerrado 60 Casas de la Cultura (según el investigador Carlos Cañas Dinarte), a lo que el para entonces viceministro Erick Doradea aseguró que era necesaria la descentralización de la cultura, por lo que “venían” proyectos nuevos y fortalecimientos de los espacios para poder generar la cultura local.\nDinarte explicó que las casas de la Cultura vienen desde los 70 y que su intención es proporcionar, tanto a los sectores urbanos como rurales, acceder a una biblioteca y a talleres de formación en diferentes áreas culturales.\nCon la medida aprobada Dinarte considera que se le está dando énfasis al área urbana del país.\n“Hay que buscar un equilibrio en todo esto, se visualizó de una manera y fue creciendo de una manera bastante desordenada, pero lo que están haciendo es una falsa actualización del proyecto, porque los CUBO son zonas de divertimento, se ha confundido la función de una biblioteca con la de un espacio lúdico”, explicó.\n“Hay un complejo sumamente arraigado, que es el ‘Complejo del Conquistador’, siempre que llega a un territorio, o cargo público, se dedica a destruir todo lo que han hecho anteriormente, ahí se sintetiza lo que está haciendo este gobierno”, reaccionó el artista salvadoreño Renacho Melgar.\nLas medidas fueron aprobadas de manera exprés, es decir, ninguna comisión discutió la propuesta de los diputados Sharon Salazar, Lorena Fuentes y Claudia Toledo. Nadie de quienes la propusieron la explicó en el pleno.\nEl 19 de junio, el presidente Nayib Bukele nombró al diputado de Nuevas Ideas, Raúl Castillo, como nuevo ministro de Cultura, sin embargo, al cierre de esta nota no había una reacción en redes sociales de su parte.\nKEYWORDS\nAsamblea Cultura Legislación Cultural Ley De Cultura Ministerio De Cultura Política Política CulturalVer Comentarios",

    "text": "Il presidente del Burundi propone di lapidare gli omosessuali NAIROBI, 29 DIC - Matrimonio omosessuale \"pratica abominevole\", coppie gay da \"lapidare\" perché hanno \"scelto il diavolo\" e attirano la \"maledizione\" divina. E' la virulenta invettiva del presidente del Burundi Evariste Ndayishimiye pronunciata oggi contro l'omosessualità. Il capo dello Stato di questo Paese cristiano e conservatore - dove le relazioni omosessuali sono punibili fino a due anni di carcere -, è intervenuto nel corso di una conferenza nella provincia di Cankuzo (est), trasmessa dalla radio e dalla televisione, rispondendo alle domande della stampa e della popolazione. \"Mi avete posto una domanda su questa pratica abominevole che porta un uomo a sposare un altro uomo e una donna a sposare un'altra donna\", ha dichiarato, prima di evocare la Bibbia. \"Vi dico la verità, se volete portare una maledizione su un Paese, dovete far sposare persone dello stesso sesso. Vi ricordate cosa è successo a Sodoma e Gomorra? Dio allora disse che si pentiva di aver creato l'uomo\", ha aggiunto. - [Leggi qui](https://edicola.giornaledibrescia.it/giornalebrescia/newsstand?int_source=leggiqui&int_medium=link&int_campaing=linkinterno&int_content=leggi_qui_il_gdb_in_edicola_oggi)il GdB in edicola oggi - [Iscriviti alle newsletter del GdB](/newsletter/iscriviti).

    "text": "Legisladores de diversas bancadas durante la sesión de la Comisión Permanente. (ARCHIVO) [FABIOLA P. CANEDO](https://www.google.com/search?as_sitesearch=elsiglodetorreon.com.mx&q=FABIOLA+P.+CANEDO) El Frente Cívico Nacional, Poder Ciudadano, Sí por México, Sociedad Civil México, UNE México, Unidos por México y la Marea Rosa entregarán el próximo lunes 26 de agosto el Amicus Curiae al Tribunal Electoral del Poder Judicial de la Federación para decir No a la Sobrerrepresentación. Las organizaciones informaron que, tras las elecciones del pasado 2 de junio, los votos de la ciudadanía ya fueron contabilizados. Sin embargo, mediante un presunto fraude a la Ley, se quiere minimizar a la oposición y eliminar la representación real de las minorías en el Congreso de la Unión, dándole a Morena, PT y PVEM más lugares en la Cámara de Diputados de los que les corresponden. En este sentido, se busca decirle al Tribunal Electoral, a través de un Amicus Curiae, que se debe realizar una interpretación histórica, sistemática, teleológica y garantista de lo dispuesto en el artículo 54 Constitucional para considerar que los techos de sobrerrepresentación son aplicables para toda fuerza política; esto es, es aplicable a partidos y coaliciones. Además, el sistema es claro en cuanto al objetivo de impedir que cualquier fuerza política tenga una mayoría de dos terceras partes en el Congreso; es decir, se establece claramente que ninguna fuerza política, por sí sola no puede reformar la Constitución. El Amicus Curiae es una expresión latina que se traduce al español como \"amigo de la Corte\" y es una forma de intervención en una causa como tercero con interés. Esta figura permite la intervención de la sociedad civil, se puede así contribuir al debate del proceso constitucional con argumentos, en tanto estén comprometidas cuestiones de interés general o de trascendencia nacional. Gabriela Sterling, representante de Poder Ciudadano Mx X Mx, planteó la preocupación ciudadana sobre la asignación de diputaciones y senadurías por el principio de representación proporcional. Señaló que la conformación del Congreso debe ser reflejo del resultado de la elección, por lo que los límites a la sobre y subrepresentación deben considerarse a partir de las coaliciones, a fin de salvaguardar la pluralidad y los equilibrios que dieron origen al principio de representación proporcional en la legislación electoral. Según argumenta Poder Ciudadano, es preciso apegarse a la razón del artículo 54 constitucional, el cual indica que ningún partido político podrá contar con más de 300 diputados por los principios de mayoría relativa y representación proporcional. Y que ningún partido podrá tener un número total de diputados, elegidos por ambos principios, que exceda del 8% del total de votos recibidos, a menos que el partido haya obtenido triunfos en distritos uninominales, superiores a la votación nacional emitida, más un 8%. En el caso de la reciente elección, la coalición integrada por los partidos Morena, Verde y del Trabajo obtuvo el 54.9% de la votación. Por lo que, es claro que no existe un mandato para que partido o coalición alguna cuente con una mayoría calificada en la cámara de diputados. A decir de Poder Ciudadano, el principio de representación proporcional tiene como esencia salvaguardar los derechos de las minorías, y reconocer la pluralidad política para que ésta se vea expresada en la conformación del Congreso.",
