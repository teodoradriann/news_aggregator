    "text": "On April 9, 2025, ADOR took legal measures to protect NewJeans from rising online abuse. In a statement titled “Legal Action Status Regarding Artist Rights Infringement,” the agency seeks to crack down on malicious rumors and personal attacks aimed at the group. ADOR believes the hate was sparked by the contract feud, which began in late 2024 and intensified after NewJeans challenged the agency’s management by changing their name and creating separate social media accounts.\nToday is the hearing\nWe do not expect Njz to win it however this time it will be private which might mean confidential information is being shared such as contract details audio or recordings\nHybe could exploit this by spreading misinformation through journalists be aware\n[pic.twitter.com/lDPyMhLMmp]— Lia ✮ (@Liasshy)\n[April 8, 2025]\nThe timing of this announcement coincides with a tense legal battle. In March 2025, the Seoul Central District Court upheld ADOR as NewJeans’ official management, banning any independent activities. On March 21, the members, now calling themselves MHDHH, formally objected, citing a complete loss of trust. Despite court drama, ADOR insists nothing has changed since the court’s initial ruling.\nIt has been reported that\n[#NewJeans]' injunction appeal hearing lasted 10 minutes. When questioned by press, ADOR stated the situation remains unchanged since the initial injunction ruling, while NewJeans' side declined to comment.[https://t.co/xT1gXG5cdt]— Sniper22 (@Snper22)\n[April 9, 2025]\nFans feel ADOR’s move is a joke, accusing the agency of covering deeper issues while clinging to control. NewJeans then declared an indefinite hiatus on March 23, making their fans feel intrigued due to the secretive nature of the hearings. On April 9, both NewJeans’ and ADOR’s legal teams had a closed-door session in court, which the five members didn’t attend, and information was kept under wraps.",

    "text": "Palantir has won a US Army contract worth $178.4 million to house a battlefield intelligence system inside a big truck.\nIn what purports to be the Army’s first AI-defined vehicle, Palantir will provide systems for the TITAN \"ground station,\" which is designed to access space, high altitude, aerial, and terrestrial sensors to \"provide actionable targeting information for enhanced mission command and long range precision fires\", according to a Palantir statement.\nTITAN stands for Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node, which might sound harmless enough. Who was ever killed by a node?\nThe TITAN solution is built to \"maximize usability for soldiers, incorporating tangible feedback and insights from soldier touchpoints at every step of the development and configuration process,\" the statement said.\nThe aim of the TITAN project is to bring together military software and hardware providers in a new way. These include \"traditional and non-traditional partners\" of the US armed forces, such as Northrop Grumman, Anduril Industries, L3Harris Technologies, Pacific Defense, SNC, Strategic Technology Consulting, and World Wide Technology, as well as Palantir.\nSpeaking to Bloomberg, Alex Karp, Palantir’s motor-mouth CEO, said TITAN was the logical extension of Maven, a controversial project for using machine learning and engineering to tell people and objects apart in drone footage in which Palantir is a partner and from which Google famously pulled out after employees protested.\nKarp said TITAN was a partnership between \"people who’ve built software products that have been used on the battlefield and used commercially.\"\n\"That simple insight which you see in the battlefield in Ukraine, which you see in Israel is something that is hard for institutions to internalize. [For] the Pentagon this step is one of the most historic steps ever because what it basically says is, ‘We’re going to fight for real, we’re going to put the best on the battlefield and the best is not just one company.’ It’s a team of people led by the most prominent software provider in defense in the world: Palantir,\" he said.\nIn December last year, the news site of non-profit Armed Forces Communications & Electronics Association International described TITAN as Army’s first intelligence ground station enabled by artificial intelligence and machine learning.\nGeneral Ed Barker, the Army’s program executive officer for intelligence, electronic warfare and sensors, told the publication Titan would create a scalable, and expeditionary intelligence ground station to provide fused sensor data that \"enables long-range precision fires.\"\nPalantir’s connections with the US and other military has raised concerns in the UK, as the company is the winning bidder for the NHS Federated Data Platform, the controversial project which the government hopes will help recover the care backlog stemming from the pandemic. ®\n{Categories} *ALL*,_Category: Implications{/Categories}\n{URL}https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/08/palantir_wins_us_army_contract/{/URL}\n{Author}unknown{/Author}\n{Image}https://regmedia.co.uk/2021/04/30/shutterstock_palantir.jpg{/Image}\n{Keywords}{/Keywords}\n{Source}The Register{/Source}\n{Thumb}{/Thumb}",

    "text": "[](https://www.cheknews.ca/warm-weather-wreaks-havoc-on-some-b-c-ski-hills-as-lack-of-snow-leaves-trails-barren-1183776/) British Columbia’s abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb’s trails are open, while Vancouver’s Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has [ pushed temperatures to record highs](https://www.cheknews.ca/century-old-heat-records-fall-in-b-c-as-weather-system-brings-warmth-and-wind-1183652/) in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. SEE ALSO: [Mount Washington internet and cell service restored](https://www.cheknews.ca/mount-washington-internet-and-cell-service-restored-1183541/) On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver’s three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are “definitely behind the 8-ball” because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. “All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,” Shalman said. “This is not something where you can make up what you’re down during Christmas break. You won’t make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.” Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. “I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,” he says. “We’re Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.” At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of “thin snow coverage” for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. “Rain’s the star of the show today,” Cypress Mountain’s update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a “blocking pattern” across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like “a wall.” He said Environment Canada’s long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. “We may see potential for some snowfall,” Proctor says. “But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.",

    "text": "In the realm of sustainable design and green building practices, the term ‘biophilia hypothesis’ resonates with our fundamental connection to the natural world. Most professionals in the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) or eco-conscious design sphere know that this hypothesis, pioneered by Edward O. Wilson in his 1984 book Biophilia , says that humans possess an innate affinity towards nature.\nAt its core, the idea has gone through various fields of study, finding particular resonance with green designs, material reuse, and eco-friendly architecture. While Wilson’s initial theory might have seemed more aspirational than grounded, researchers are increasingly looking for health benefits associated with deep human involvement in natural surroundings.\nThe concept has profound implications on real estate, driving a paradigm shift towards biophilic designs — an approach that integrates natural elements into built environments. It further signifies that biophilia hypothesis is far-reaching, influencing not only the aesthetics but also the well-being and productivity of occupants.\nInspired by the outdoors Commercial real estate firms are proactively adopting green design principles to incorporate nature-inspired elements into their office spaces. Here are several strategies they employ:\nHerb garden | Photo Credit: Getty Images/istock\nButterfly gardens : Various commercial real estate (CRE) firms are carving out dedicated spaces for butterfly gardens, carefully selecting plants that facilitate butterfly breeding and sustain their life cycle. Recognising the value of holistic well-being and the therapeutic influence of nature, companies are also integrating medicinal herb gardens into their landscapes. These spaces, including the organic farming, butterfly garden, and medicinal herb gardens, lead to an environment that embraces sustainability.\nLayout with skylights : Green designs, centred on maximising natural light, is a strategic focus for commercial real estate companies. While crafting office spaces, grade-A developers strategically position windows, skylights, and adopt open layouts to optimise the infusion of natural light. They incorporate roof-mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) technology, which facilitates a 30% reduction in power consumption.\nPlants for purifiers : Developers are choosing materials such as reclaimed wood, stone, and bamboo for flooring, wall coverings, and furniture. Green facades as a central element featuring plants on vertical surfaces, not only enhance aesthetics but also play a vital role in countering the urban heat island effect. They contribute to cooling structures, retaining rainwater, and purifying indoor air, fostering a healthier and more environmentally conscious work environment.\nAccent on common areas : Beyond individual workspaces, biophilic designs are also seamlessly integrated into common areas such as lobbies, meeting rooms, and break spaces. These communal zones often have elements like water features, greenery, and natural materials, fostering collaborative environments that inspire creativity and a sense of community among occupants. Furthermore, the incorporation of lush landscape podiums not only adheres to biophilic principles but also actively supports a healthier work-life balance for occupants.\nWater-saving fixtures : Leading CRE developers are embracing the concept of resilient structures as an integral part of their ethos. They are leveraging renewable energy sources and cutting-edge systems to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. They are also incorporating state-of-the-art water-saving fixtures and using advanced wastewater treatment technologies to divert waste from the landfills.\nThe writer is Sr. VP Head Project Management, TATA Realty & Infrastructure Ltd.\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",
