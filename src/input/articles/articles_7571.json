    "text": "利潤創新高卻裁員！美企掀起「AI時代瘦身潮」寶僑、雅詩蘭黛、微軟接連淪陷\n鉅亨網編譯陳韋廷 綜合報導\n最新數據顯示，美國企業界正經歷一場前所未有的裁員潮，即便企業利潤在去年底創下歷史新高，但過去被視為成長象徵的人才擴張，如今成了企業眼中負擔。\n《華爾街日報》周三 (18 日) 報導，寶僑 (P&G) 日前宣布裁減 15% 非產線員工，雅詩蘭黛、Match(MTCH-US) 削減 20% 管理者，美國銀行 (BAC-US) 管理階層從 13 級壓至 7 級，微軟 (MSFT-US) 也打算裁員數千人。這場裁員潮的獨特之處在於，它並非源自於業績下滑的被迫之舉，而是在 AI 時代，越來越多的企業推崇效率至上、「少人多產」。\n過去三年美國上市公司白領職缺縮減 3.5%，標普 500 成分股中每五家就有一家在過去十年持續瘦身。裁員潮罕見脫離經濟週期，伴隨去年底美企利潤創紀錄成長，亞馬遜、美銀等巨頭藉 AI 與組織扁平化推行「人效改革」，普通員工與管理層同時淪為優化目標。\n寶潔本月宣布將裁減 7000 個職位，佔其非製造業員工的 15%，目標是創造「更廣泛的角色和更小的團隊」，雅詩蘭黛和約會應用業者 Match Group 近來均稱已裁減約 20% 的管理階層，微軟也打算未來幾周裁減銷售部門和其他團隊的數千名員工。\n「人多力量大」在 AI 時代正被「精兵強將」取代，對於這個現象，美銀執行長 Brian Moynihan 直言，更少的人力和更低的成本造就更高產出。\n在 Moynihan 領導下，美銀人力從 2010 年的 28.5 萬員工縮減至約 21.3 萬人，同時收入較十年前增長 18%。該行將管理層級從 13 層減少到約 7 層。\n生成式 AI 正讓美企主管們想像一個員工更少的未來。亞馬遜執行長 Andy Jassy 在周二 (17 日) 寫給員工的備忘錄中直言，AI 崛起將在未來幾年內消除某些工作職缺的需求。最優秀的領導者能夠「用完成工作所需的最少資源獲得最大成效」。\n電商平台 Shopify 和語言學習應用程式 Duolingo 執行長都表示，未來徵才前提是先證明該工作無法自動化完成，新創企業 Jolie Skin 創辦人兼執行長 Ryan Babenzien 說：「十年前，5 人或是更少員工建立 5000 萬美元的業務會非常困難。如今，我認為這將變得非常普遍。」\n越來越多美國企業正在專注於效率而不是規模，人多反而成了發展的阻礙。報導指出，從西雅圖的大型企業到北卡羅來納州夏洛特的美國銀行，以及介於兩者之間的大大小小的公司，越來越多企業認為員工人數過多本身就是一個障礙，許多老闆傳達的訊息是「任何仍在領薪水的員工都可以更努力工作」。\n管理人員成為這輪裁員潮的重點目標。根據 Live Data Technologies 數據，從 2022 年 5 月到 2025 年 5 月，美企管理人員數量下降 6.1%，高階主管職位減少了 4.6%。\n惠普企業財務長 Marie Myers 告訴投資人：「更扁平意味著更快速。」該公司員工目前不到 5.9 萬人，是十年前獨立以來的最小規模。\n不過，哈佛商學院管理學教授 Joseph Fuller 警告說：「過度扁平化令組織機能失調，員工被迫承擔三人工作量。」\n關稅降息夾殺！免費講座教你如何布局- 掌握全球財經資訊\n點我下載APP\n下一篇",

    "text": "The following is an epistle from the Mt. Athos Grigoriou Monastery that has been circulated amongst Greek believers after the passing of the “same-sex marriage” law in Greece on February 15, 2024.\n“The princes of men gathered against the Lord and against His Christ” (Matins on Great Saturday).\nIn the Greek parliament, Christ is again being crucified.\nHe Who rules the entire universe endures revilement from lawless judges, with the exception of a few, who deserve praise.\nThe “anointed of the Lord”, our baptized people, is under attack. The powers of darkness from without and within the country are co-conspirators in this initiative. “The dragon was wroth” against those who “have testimony of Jesus Christ” (Rev. 12:17). Those who do not enter into compromise with the orders of the globalists are entering into a great temptation. This is the beginning of tribulations.\nThe Church, the Synod, the clergy, and the people have said their word, and raised their voices to heaven: “This is a crime!” But the ears of the rulers did not hear it.\nO evil day! The fall of Constantinople and the Asia Minor catastrophe pale before it.\n[1](#sdfootnote1sym) But there is also the eye of justice.\nSerious consequences are falling upon our shoulders and the shoulders of our children. The aged, the young, and the yet unborn are all experiencing them. Especially innocent children, for whom the most shameful “blood tax”\n[2](#sdfootnote2sym) is being prepared.\nAll this theomachy that has been legalized has put down roots as supposed “social progress”. Fornication, abortion, and no-fault divorce. Now “same-sex marriage” will speed up “progress”. We are falling lower and lower. We are sinking into man-centeredness, into idol worship. All for the sake of ease, and with ease. Ionesco with his song, “Rhinoceroses” was absolutely right. In Paris, one after another were becoming rhinoceroses. Only one opposed it, saying, “I’ll remain a man.”\nWe knew and survived the calamity of soviet godlessness. Now we are experiencing the horrors of “white demonism” (St. Nikolai [Velimirovich]).\nBut we shall be courageous. Christ said, I have overcome the world (Jn. 16:33). The Church will live throughout the ages.\nWe are left with only one option: to revoke this law in practice. We will strengthen our children in virtues and chastity. And this will be a great deed. We will remain with Christ. Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will call upon the name of the Lord (Ps. 19:8). Our strength is prayer. The Church must hide in the “desert”, no matter what this prophetic desert may be. In any case, it is far from consent to sinful laws and lawless legislators. We will not be afraid of poverty, or social and psychological isolation. We are accompanied by the Light of the Resurrection. In similar instances our holy fathers were victorious through their courage. They preferred the labor of virtues, and when necessary, exile, sorrow, and deprivation—whether it came to heretical dogmas or morals that contradicted the Gospels. In Babylon the three youths preferred endurance in the furnace over the good life.\nUnder Julian the Apostate, the Patriarch of Constantinople preferred boiled wheat instead the food that had been offered to idols, which was being forced upon Christians at the market. It is a symbol of voluntary poverty for Christ’s sake, so that our conscience would remain pure, and not subject to the influence of temptations.\nVictory belongs to the Sacrificial Lamb. In the end, Christ Crucified, and those who will be of Christ, crucified together with Him, will be victorious. He expects us to follow Him. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing (2 Cor. 6:17), so that He would remain in our lives.\nSoon the Lenten Triodion period will begin, and Great Lent is approaching. The life of repentance is not folklore and not an appearance of piety. It is the departure from all iniquity, manifested in deed and pain of heart. For the Resurrection awaits us!\n[1](#sdfootnote1anc) Two events that Greeks consider the most grievous day in their Christian history: the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, and the exile of the Greek population from Asia Minor that began in 1922. [2](#sdfootnote2anc) Here is meant the so-called devshirme—a practice in the Ottoman Empire, when Christian boys were forcefully taken from their families and given over to the Sultan’s complete disposal. Many of them ended up in harems. This is a reference to the possibility presented by the new law of the legal adoption of children by same-sex couples.",

    "text": "Newswise — The number of people treated with anti-VEGF medication s has grown exponentially since these sight-saving medications were first approved in 2006. Many of these people, treated for conditions such as macular degeneration and diabetic eye disease, will inevitably develop a cataract, a common condition among aging adults. Based on current research, it’s unclear if a history of multiple past eye injections complicates future cataract surgery. In the largest study to date, researchers in Canada analyzed data from a universal healthcare system and found that patients are at higher risk of multiple possible complications following cataract sugery. They will present their study this week at AAO 2024, the 128th annual meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology . Using physician billing and diagnostic from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan, the researchers identified 10 visually significant complication events due to cataract surgery and evaluated their associations with patients who had a history of treatment with intravitreal injections. A majority were treated with anti-VEGF medications. Researchers identified 163,663 patients with retinal conditions who had undergone cataract surgery between 2009 and 2018. Of this group, 3,243 received anti-VEGF eye injections prior to cataract surgery. Compared with patients who never received anti-VEGF treatments, treated patients had a higher risk of non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage, retained lens fragments, retinal detachment, retinal tear, intraocular lens (IOL) dislocation, anterior vitrectomy and glaucoma surgery. - Non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage (aHR 3.37, 95% CI 2.57–4.43) - Retained lens fragments (aHR 2.00, 95% CI 1.02–3.91) - Retinal detachment (aHR 3.63, 95% CI 2.47–5.35) - Retinal tear (aHR 3.24, 95% CI 2.36- 4.45) - IOL dislocation (aHR 1.97, 95% CI 1.31–2.97) - Anterior vitrectomy (aHR 1.67, 95% CI 1.17–2.38) and - Glaucoma surgery (aHR 4.03, 95% CI 2.86–5.70) Researchers did not find an increased risk of corneal transplants, IOL exchange, or IOL repositioning in patients who had a history of treatment with anti-VEGF medications. “Findings of this study highlight the importance of preoperative and intraoperative surgical planning in the prevention and management of these possible complications in patients receiving cataract surgery,” said lead researcher Winnie Yu of the University of Toronto Temerty Faculty of Medicine in Toronto, Ontario. “Patients with prior intravitreal injection history should be counselled on the potential risks of cataract surgery to ensure appropriate informed surgical decision-making.” About the American Academy of Ophthalmology The American Academy of Ophthalmology is the world’s largest association of eye physicians and surgeons.

    "text": "Bengaluru : Cartosat-2, ISRO ‘s first satellite in the second generation of high-resolution imaging satellites launched 17 years ago, has been brought down from space to the earth’s atmosphere, an official of the space agency said on Friday.\n“The satellite entered the earth’s atmosphere at 3.48 pm IST on February 14 over the Indian ocean. Either it would have burnt out or its leftovers might have fallen in the sea, which we may not be able to find,” the official said.\nAlso Read New drone port likely to come up in Telangana According to ISRO, the satellite was launched on January 10, 2007. It weighed 680 kg at launch and operated in a sun-synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 635 km.\nUntil 2019, it provided high-resolution imagery for urban planning, ISRO said in a statement.\n“Initially, Cartosat-2 was expected to take about 30 years to naturally de-orbit. However, ISRO opted to lower its perigee using leftover fuel to comply with international guidelines on space debris mitigation,” it said.\n“This exercise involved reducing collision risks and ensuring safe end-of-life disposal, following recommendations from organisations like the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN-COPOUS) and the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC),” ISRO said.\nISRO said its System for Safe and Sustainable Space Operations (IS4OM) team at ISRO Telemetry Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) predicted Cartosat-2’s atmospheric re-entry for February 14.\n“Electrical passivation was completed on February 14th, and tracking continued until re-entry. The final telemetry frames confirmed successful passivation, with the satellite reaching about 130 km altitude,” ISRO said.\nThis exercise provided an opportunity to assess indigenous tracking capabilities, with the multi-object tracking radar at the spaceport of Sriharikota utilised for tracking.\n“The final prediction placed Cartosat-2’s re-entry over the Indian Ocean at 10:18 UTC / 3:48 pm IST on February 14, 2024. Analysis indicated that all major spacecraft components would demise (sic) during atmospheric re-entry,” ISRO said.\nAccording to the space agency, Cartosat-2’s successful de-orbiting at its end-of-life represents a significant step for ISRO in ensuring the long-term sustainability of outer space activities.",

    "text": "The Trump administration marks a radical change in food policies, eliminating all synthetic additives derived from petroleum.\nIn an unprecedented decision, the Trump Administration announced, according to AFP, its intention to completely eliminate artificial colorings from foods sold in the United States. The measure, welcomed by both the scientific community and civil society, targets a category of food additives long accused of negative effects on public health, especially on children.\n• FDA: \"A radical change for public health\"\n\"We are effectively eliminating all petroleum-derived food colorings in the United States,\" said Marty Makary, the new head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), during a press conference held in Washington. In total, eight synthetic additives will be removed from the market by the end of 2026 at the latest. According to the FDA, the decision comes in the wake of a wave of scientific evidence linking the use of these substances to problems such as hyperactivity in children, diabetes and even cancer. \"For the past 50 years, American children have lived in a veritable toxic soup of artificial chemicals,\" said Makary, emphasizing the need for strong intervention to protect public health.\n• A rare political consensus\nThe decision comes a few months after the former Democratic administration proposed a ban on the dye Red 3 (E127 in Europe), already known for decades for its carcinogenic potential in animal studies. Unlike many other legislative measures, the FDA initiative generated bipartisan consensus in the US Congress, a rarity in the current political climate. This harmony is explained by the growing pressure from consumer rights organizations, which for years have warned about the risks of these additives and called for stricter regulation.\n• Popular dyes, but lacking nutritional value\nAmong the substances to be banned are Red 40 (E129), Yellow 5 (E102) and Yellow 6 (E110) - dyes that are extremely widespread in the American food industry. They can be found in products such as sweets, juices, cereals, sauces and snacks.\nPeter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), says that these additives do not bring any real nutritional benefit: \"They only serve commercial purposes - to make foods look redder, bluer, more appetizing than they actually are.\"\n• What's next for the industry and consumers?\nThe US food industry will have a transition period of almost two years, until the end of 2026, to adapt to the new regulations. During this time, manufacturers will be forced to find natural alternatives, such as beetroot extracts, curcumin or spirulina, already widely used in Europe and in the organic segment. For consumers, the measure could lead to cleaner and safer products, but also to a possible increase in prices, at least temporarily, due to the adaptation of recipes and supply chains.\nThe ban marked by the FDA positions the US closer to European standards, where many of these dyes are either banned or conditioned by clear warnings on the packaging. Thus, the measure could also influence other countries, which often look to the US as a model in terms of food regulations. It is also a clear signal that consumer protection is gaining ground over commercial interests, especially when it comes to children's health.",
