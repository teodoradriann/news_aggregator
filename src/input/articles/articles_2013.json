    "text": "MHI Demonstrates Transport of Relief Supplies in the Event of a Disaster Using Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles Currently in Development\n- 29\nParticipation in Practical Training Exercise Conducted by JGSDF Eastern Army in Cooperation with Local Governments\nTOKYO, July 31, 2025 - (JCN Newswire) - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI) participated in a practical training exercise held on July 17 at the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) Asaka Garrison (Nerima-ku, Tokyo), aimed at improving response capabilities in the event of an earthquake centered on the Tokyo metropolitan area. The training was conducted by the JGSDF Eastern Army in cooperation with local governments, with MHI joining at the request of the Japan UAS Industrial Development Association (JUIDA). MHI conducted training to transport relief supplies to isolated disaster victims using its medium-sized multirotor uncrewed aerial vehicle (hereinafter \"medium-sized UAV\") currently being developed by its Commercial Aviation Systems division, and the VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) UAV being developed by the Integrated Defense & Space Systems division.\nThe medium-sized UAV is being developed for a variety of purposes, such as transporting relief supplies in the event of a disaster, providing logistics support to remote islands and mountainous areas, and conveying materials for construction work on power transmission towers.

    "text": "PA Media: Sport Mikel Arteta bemoans Arsenal’s display in both boxes after home loss to West Ham Read full article Mark Mann-Bryans, PA 29 December 2023 at 6:09 am · 3-min read\nMikel Arteta admitted his side came up short in both boxes as Arsenal slumped to defeat to West Ham to miss out on regaining top spot in the Premier League.\nThe Gunners remain behind Liverpool as they lost 2-0 at the Emirates Stadium on what Arteta conceded was one of the most frustrating nights of his four-year tenure as Arsenal boss.\nTomas Soucek’s opener – awarded after the VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build up – and a second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos earned the visitors a deserved win.\nThings could have been even better had Said Benrahma not had a stoppage-time penalty saved by David Raya on a night where Arteta applauded the performances of the opposition.\n“I congratulate West Ham and praise my players. That’s what I can tell you,” he said.\n“This is football. When you look at how much we generated in the game, to see the result is very disappointing. But they were better than us in both boxes. They had two shots, with the penalty three. We had 30.\n“If we don’t score with 30 shots, then we have to do 50 or 60 to try to score. That’s the only thing. I can’t imagine a game where we have more touches in the box, more dominance and less situations for the opponent against a really good West Ham side. Today though, it wasn’t enough to win the game.”\nAsked if it was among the most frustrating nights of his managerial career, Arteta replied: “It is. But it’s football. Normally when the team generates so much it’s going to win games.\n“That’s the way we’ve done it. Against Brighton , we generated so much and against Liverpool as well, but we score goals in different ways.\n“We have to make another step in that area to win games more comfortably, that’s for sure, because today the team deserves to win the game. There’s no question about that.”\nArteta successfully fought a Football Association charge after he criticised the officiating and VAR in defeat at Newcastle last month and was less vocal this time.\nStory continues He did, however, suggest technology needs to be further advanced to make close calls, adding: “They’re saying it’s not conclusive. It’s a shame that with the technology that we have, that it’s not that clear so that we can say whether it’s out or in. It’s done. It’s gone. There’s nothing we can do about it now.\n“If the technology we have at the moment is not good enough to give us that answer, what we have to do is without that win the game. With the number of situations we generated in the game, that should have been more than enough.”\nFor West Ham and manager David Moyes, this was a rare taste of victory at the Emirates Stadium – Moyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea , Liverpool or Manchester United .\nWest Ham were 17th at the turn of the year but went on to win the Europa Conference League and now sit just four points off the top four after this hard-fought and deserved win.\nDavid Moyes and his team had a good night (Adam Davy/PA) Moyes is out of contract in the summer but, on the four-year anniversary of his reappointment as West Ham boss, feels a new deal will soon be ironed out.\n“We’re getting ready to talk,” he told Amazon Prime.\n“I don’t think any of us are jumping to get it done too quickly, I think we are just happy to make sure we get it done. We will do, I don’t see any problems with that at all.\n“We are not one of the top teams. We are trying to get up and grow the team. For West Ham to be in Europe is a great period.”\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "[Health Care](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/) Chlamydia vaccine shows promising results in early-stage trial The Chlamydia vaccine showed promising results in an early-stage clinical trial conducted by researchers in the U.K. and Denmark. The early phase of the research found the experimental vaccine to be safe. The study was conducted from 2020 through 2022 with individuals split between non-pregnant women and men, while none had chlamydia. The researchers examined and tested various dosages of the vaccine, they noted [reported](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00147-6/abstract) in The Lancet Infectious Diseases on Thursday. Participants got the vaccine or a placebo during the four-month period of testing. Researchers noted that 154 participants were screened, 65 randomly assigned while 60 finished the trial. Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can cause infections among men and women. The disease can permanently damage women’s reproductive system and make pregnancies difficult or sometimes impossible, [according](https://www.cdc.gov/std/chlamydia/stdfact-chlamydia.htm#:~:text=Chlamydia%20is%20a%20common%20STD,that%20occurs%20outside%20the%20womb).) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). No vaccine is currently available to protect against the disease, an infection reported in over 1,6 million cases in the country in 2022, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2022/overview.htm#Chlamydia). During the trial, participants also got the vaccine through eye drops a part of getting the shot in the arm. Phase 2 trial will look at the effectiveness of the shot. The next phase still has to answer questions, especially with the research being in its infancy. “Does it confer the ability to hold off infection with chlamydia?” Dr. Hilary Reno, a professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/sexual-health/chlamydia-vaccine-shows-promise-early-trial-rcna147479). “If you do have an infection, does it mean you’re more likely to have an asymptomatic infection,” Reno, who is also a medical director of the St. Louis County Sexual Health Clinic, said. “We don’t know that and that’s what the next phase of studies would be,” Reno said.

    "text": "I don't like how scrolling makes me feel these days. Every headline, meme, and take I scroll past leaves me feeling worse about the world. It isn't entirely unwarranted—there's a lot of bad happening—but marinating in that feeling doesn't help.\nScrolling isn't always detrimental, of course. It can be relaxing, for one thing, and it can be a way to keep up with what's happening with your friends. But I think we all know there are diminishing returns when it comes to scrolling—the overall quality goes down the longer you keep going. And that's why reading is possibly more important now than its ever been: There aren't diminishing returns. Scrolling is briefly thinking about lots of things; reading is taking the time to think about one thing.\nThat's why I'm trying to do more reading and less scrolling. Seeing hundreds of memes about the latest dumb thing that one billionaire said doesn't help me reach any of my goals. Taking the time to get context on the issues I care about—and thinking deeply about them—might. So I've been taking active steps to nudge myself toward scrolling less and reading more. I hope these tips will help you achieve the same.\nHide (or uninstall) social media apps\nAre there social media icons on your phone's home screen? The simplest thing you can do in order to scroll less is to get those icons off of there. You can do this by removing the icons from the home screen or by uninstalling the application entirely. Either way, the process is easy: tap and hold on the icon. Both Android and iOS will give you the option to either remove the application from your home screen or delete it.\nI, personally, tend to just remove the apps from my home screen. This reduces the number of times I turn on my phone and reflexively open an app to scroll in, but leaves the applications available when I actively want them.\nThat might not be enough for you, though. You might find yourself going out of your way to scroll even if it means pulling up the app outside the home screen, or sucked in when there's a notification. If that's you, I recommend just uninstalling the application entirely, if only while you're trying to create the habit of scrolling less. It will cut off the problem entirely.\nPut books on your phone\nGetting books onto your phone isn't hard. There are the big apps, including Kindle and Kobo, if you want to purchase current titles. (Apple has its own proprietary \"Books\" app as well.) You can access millions of books in the public domain with a little bit of searching. And there's also a good chance your local library offers free e-books: Libby is a common app for this.\nSet up one or multiple of these applications and put them right on the home screen of your phone. Ideally, you'll put the icon right where the social application you used to open constantly lives. The idea is to trick yourself into opening books. This isn't magic—you're going to need to force yourself to actually read. Over time, though, the habit may begin to form.\nAnother thing to consider: audiobooks. Some people can't get into reading no matter how hard they try. Others can't find the time. In either case, I think audiobooks can be a great alternative. Listening to a book while driving, cleaning the house, or just hanging out at home is a great way to take in and reflect on books. Some people get elitist about this—ignore them. Listening to books is great. Most local libraries offer audiobooks, whether in the Libby app or as physical CDs. Otherwise, there are services like Audible and even Spotify to get your audiobook fix.\nMake reading articles easy for yourself\nIf you don't want to read entire books on your phone (I personally don't), you'll likely find its the perfect device for reading articles, and there are plenty of ways to do that without the need to scroll.\nI like having read-it-later apps on my phone's home screen. These let you save articles you find on the web for future reading. I tend to clip articles during my work day, when I shouldn't be reading, and come back to them in the evening. I personally use FlyLeaf, which is a great option for Apple users, but Instapaper is also a very good tool for the job.\nBut it's also a good idea to have a few publications that you browse regularly. There are all kinds of ways to do this. The simplest is to bookmark the homepages of a few of your favorite websites and blogs so that they show up every time you open your browser. The more techie solution is to find an RSS reader, which shows you the headlines from as many websites as you like. That way, you can keep up with everything in one place.\nOr, you could look into apps that let you read entire print publications. I recently discovered Press Reader, which offers full versions of magazines and newspapers. It's offered for free by some libraries and lets you read the entire print version of all sorts of publications. Odds are your local library has something similar, or you could physically go there and read the magazine they have on the shelf. (I love doing this.)\nMange your notifications\nNothing disrupts reading faster than being pulled into something else. If you're actually going to read, take advantage of your phone's Do Not Disturb (DND) functionality. We've talked a bit about how to customize your Android notifications and your iOS notifications, so dig into those articles for more details. But the gist is you don't want notifications popping up when you're trying to read. You can turn DND modes on or off manually, if you want, but can also schedule them. For example, if you read before bed, you could set up your phone to never buzz during your usual nighttime routine.\nYou can get fancy about this: Newer Apple devices can use AI to filter out all but the most important notifications. I've tried this feature and so far it's a great way to unplug without missing the important stuff.\nSwap out your phone for something else\nI've been talking about phones a lot in this article because that's where the bulk of scrolling happens. If you really want to read more, though, it's probably a good idea to do it on something other than your phone. E-ink devices work, but so do paper books and magazines. It's literally impossible to scroll Reddit on a book.\nDepending on how your brain works, though, a new gadget might help. My colleague Joel Cunningham wrote about how the Boox Portable helped him stop doomscrolling, and I can can understand why. This is basically an e-ink Android device, roughly the size of a phone. If you want something bigger, you can look into an e-ink tablet. These are great for both reading and jotting down ideas. I personally use a Remarkable for reading papers and researching articles. Getting away from my colorful and animated computing devices for a bit is helpful. There are all kinds of e-ink devices out there that can give you the best of both paper and electronics. Look into them—they might be what you need to trick your brain into reading more.",

    "text": "El delantero argentino de 29 años jugó un partido por el primer equipo de Universidad de Chile en 2014 tras arribar como apuesta a las juveniles del Chuncho, pero se fue en 2015.\nQuizás no muchos recuerden al delantero argentino, Nazareno Solís. El extremo izquierdo fue parte de Universidad de Chile hace algunos años como apuesta desde las juveniles del Chuncho. Hoy con 29 años, cerca de cumplir 30 en abril, el atacante vive un calvario como jugador de los registros de Boca Juniors.\nSolís arribó a las juveniles azules en agosto de 2014 proveniente de Villa Dálmine. Incluso debutó en los azules alcanzando a jugar un duelo por Copa Chile contra Magallanes, pero comenzando 2015 rescindió su contrato y regresó al club que lo formó en el fútbol argentino.\nPrevio paso por Talleres de Córdoba, el ex azul fichó por Boca Juniors a mediados de 2016, pero desde entonces ha deambulado por varios clubes a préstamo.\nTodos los años ha regresado al xeneize, pero vuelve a partir registrando apenas cuatro partidos con el club de La Bombonera… el último en abril de 2017.\nHuracán, San Martín, Aldosivi, OFICreta, Alvarado y Patronato han sido los clubes de Nazareno Solís desde entonces. Y con contrato renovado hace poco, este 2024 debe presentarse otra vez en Boca. ¿Su futuro? Totalmente incierto.\nEl caso Nazareno Solís en Boca “El extraño récord de Nazareno Solís, el delantero que debe volver a Boca”, titula Olé agregando que “desde mediados de 2017 ha sido prestado a diferentes clubes y genera un interrogante para su futuro en el Xeneize. ¿Tendrá un lugar asegurado para Diego Martínez o el Consejo de Fútbol le buscará un lugar fuera del equipo?”.\nNazareno Solís alcanzó a jugar un partido con el primer equipo de la U.\nAñaden que “su rendimiento en Patronato ha sido bueno, hasta el punto de sumar 37 encuentros, repartidos entre Primera Nacional, Copa Argentina y Copa Libertadores y Sudamericana, con tres goles y cinco asistencia”.\n“Por lo pronto, y luego de un año en donde se dio el lujo de competir a nivel internacional, el delantero de 29 años deberá estar presente en Ezeiza a las órdenes de Martínez. Eso sí, su futuro con el Xeneize podría apuntar hacia otro lado. ¿Le darán la chance de quedarse esta vez?”, sentencia Olé.\nToda la actualidad del fútbol y deporte nacional e internacional en la palma de tu mano.

    "text": "For years, Montana has had one of the highest rates of military participation and veterans per capita in the nation. The 2023 Legislature took many steps to both help our men and women in uniform protect our state and country going forward, as well as recognize and honor their service.\nFirst, we passed a new law that prohibits foreign adversaries from owning critical infrastructure and agricultural land in Montana. This is crucial to national defense, making it illegal for hostile competitors like China to buy land near our nuclear missiles at Malmstrom Air Force Base, or purchase influence over telecommunications and energy production systems. Some in Congress keep talking about taking similar steps (while nothing actually happens in D.C.), but we already got it done in Montana thanks to Sen. Ken Bogner.\nSen. John Fuller passed a bill that exempts 50% of military veterans’ retirement income from the state income tax, giving a welcome financial boost to Montanans who’ve served our nation, and encouraging more veterans to make Montana their home after military service.\nPeople are also reading…\nWe also reformed various licensing and educational certifications so that military members, their spouses, and veterans can work in Montana if they’ve already achieved certification in another state. Rep. Brad Barker passed that bill. Similarly, Rep. Ed Buttrey sponsored a bill that grants state authorization to daycare providers that have already been licensed by the U.S. Armed Forces. Both of these bills make it easier for the men and women stationed in Montana, and their families, to work and raise a family in Big Sky Country.\nAdditionally, we passed three bills to help the Montana National Guard, which were sponsored by Sen. Mike Cuffe and Rep. Scot Kerns. Those bills increase pay for National Guard pilots fighting wildfires, provide better workers compensation benefits, and limit liability for care rendered at the scene of an emergency.\nFinally, Rep. Braxton Mitchell passed a bill allowing a state veterans cemetery to be created in the Flathead Valley, and Sen. Barry Usher passed a bill to allow crew members of the USS Montana to have Montana license plates, even if they don’t live in the state while serving on the submarine.\nThese new laws all demonstrate the Legislature’s commitment to doing what we can at the state level to protect our national security and make life better for those who serve our nation.\nAs we approach a new year that is likely to feature more military tension abroad and more political conflict at home, it’s important that we as Montanans redouble our support for our military service members and veterans. We condemn the shameful actions of government officials like the Missoula city councilors who refuse to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.\nLet’s make 2024 a year of patriotism in Montana. The new laws passed by the Legislature that are going into effect are a great start.\nSen. Ken Bogner, R-Miles City, is the president pro tempore of the Montana Senate and a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq. Sen. John Fuller, R-Kalispell, is an Army veteran who served in Vietnam. Sen. Russ Tempel, R-Chester, is an Army veteran. Sen. Barry Usher, R-Yellowstone/Musselshell, is a Senate majority whip and Coast Guard veteran.",

[Ignition](https://hudsonreporter.com/go/ignition-cas-wel-en/?!86a0nbkdp) – Best Jackpot Slot Machines of All AR Online Casinos Pros: - Above-average RTP rates - $3,000 welcome bonus with just 25x wagering - Poker tourneys with over $10m GTD - Includes a built-in forum - Also offers virtual online sports betting markets Cons: - No card withdrawal options - Could expand the selection of online slots Ignition holds the top position for fans of slot games at online casinos in Arkansas. It offers a vast range of premium virtual machines and a lucrative welcome bonus of up to $3,000 with reasonable playthrough requirements. Casino Games & Payout Rates: 4.8/5 Ignition’s catalog includes over 300 games. It’s a mix of progressive jackpot games, hot drop jackpots, Bonus Buy slots, Megaways, and Double Chance games. Ignition offers a variety of high RTP games, like Gemhalla (97.17% RTP), Cat Kingdom (96.05% RTP), and Fury of Zeus (96% RTP). Poker aficionados will undoubtedly be excited about the opportunity to take part in Ignition’s poker tournaments, which cumulatively offer over $10 million in monthly prizes. Bonuses and Free Spins: 4.75/5 With a low minimum deposit of $20 and a 25x wagering requirement, newcomers to Ignition Casino are greeted with a generous welcome package. This includes [a 300% bonus up to $3,000,](https://hudsonreporter.com/go/ignition-cas-wel-en/?!86a0nbkdp) split evenly between poker and slot games. If you opt for fiat deposits, the welcome deal is a 200% match worth up to $2,000. Ignition Casino’s loyal players can also receive exclusive benefits as part of its Ignition Miles rewards program. Banking Experience: 4.85/5 Ignition Casino provides various deposit options, encompassing major bank cards and MatchPay. Additionally, the casino is open to an array of cryptocurrencies for both deposit and withdrawal processes, including but not limited to Bitcoin, Tether (USDT), and Ethereum. Despite this, it’s important to note that Ignition Casino mandates fiat currency withdrawals to be executed through either a bank transfer or a courier check, with no possibility of credit card withdrawals. 3. [Lucky Red Casino](https://hudsonreporter.com/go/luckyred-cas-wel-en/?!86a0nbkdp) – Best Online Casino in Arkansas for Mobile Pros: - Perfect mobile experience on all devices - $4,000 welcome deal at 400% rate - 400+ mobile casino games - $75 extra chip for crypto players - $1.4m jackpots on some slots Cons: - Payout limits don’t suit low-stake players - Lackluster table games and live dealers Lucky Red is our No. 1 recommendation for mobile casino players in Arkansas. The gaming experience on all iOS and Android devices is perfect, and you can score up to $4,000 in bonus cash on your first deposit. Casino Games & Payout Rates: 4.7/5 Mobile gaming aficionados will find Lucky Red Casino a goldmine, with its impressive selection of 400 premium slot games, various table game alternatives, and an exclusive assortment of specialty titles, all optimized for instant play on mobile devices. High-stakes players will find the game Aztec’s Millions irresistible, as it regularly features jackpot pools that exceed $1,000,000. While the slot game portfolio at Lucky Red provides all the thrills you need, there is potential for improvement in their range of table games and live dealer offerings. Bonuses and Free Spins: 4.6/5 An enticing [400% match bonus ](https://hudsonreporter.com/go/luckyred-cas-wel-en/?!86a0nbkdp)awaits new players at Lucky Red, scaling up to $4,000. Remember to apply the LUCKYRED400 code while making your cryptocurrency deposit to secure your $75 casino chip.

Banking Experience: 4.7/5 Whether you like transacting with Visa and MasterCard or prefer digital currencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin, Lucky Red Casino has got you covered. A minimum deposit of $35 applies to standard currencies, while it’s set at $20 for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin users are subject to a minimum withdrawal limit of $50 per transaction, which is not ideal for lower-stake players. But it’s still better than the $200 minimum payout for bank transfers or courier checks. We believe these thresholds could be slightly lower across the board. 4. [Highway Casino](https://hudsonreporter.com/go/highway-cas-wel-en/?!86a0nbkdp) – Biggest AR Online Casino Welcome Bonus Pros: - $7,000 in welcome bonuses - 300% reload bonus - About a dozen regular deals - Top-notch VIP program - Neosurf banking is available Cons: - Could use lower minimum deposits - Slower loading time Nothing excites a casino player like a welcome bonus, and it’s pretty tricky to beat the $7,000 welcome bonus offer available at Highway Casino! Casino Games & Payout Rates: 4.65/5 The jackpots provided by Highway Casino are pretty impressive, although their slot games might not match up to the likes of Ignition of Slots.lv. Take, for instance, the famous jackpot slot from Nucleus Gaming, Sherlock and The Mystic Compass. Its popularity is largely due to the Bonus Round, which requires no less than five scatter symbols to trigger. The gaming collection primarily comes from RealTime Gaming (RTG), one of the most prominent software providers in the industry. Bonuses and Free Spins: 4.9/5 With a generous [$7,000 welcome package](https://hudsonreporter.com/go/highway-cas-wel-en/?!86a0nbkdp) and a range of distinctive promotions tailored for online slot games, Highway Casino warmly welcomes all newcomers. We are particularly fond of several offers, including an exclusive bonus of $2,850 on the initial cryptocurrency deposit, a substantial 300% increase on reload deposit matches, and special advantages for those who play with high stakes. Banking Experience: 4.55/5 Highway Casino players have the flexibility to use both traditional money and a variety of cryptocurrencies. The platform allows immediate deposits through credit and debit cards, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even the not-so-common Neosurf – a unique feature among many online casino sites. When it comes to withdrawals, options include bank cards, Bitcoin, or wire transfers. The casino sets a base payout limit of $100, which escalates to $300 when using bank transfers. 5.

    "text": "BROOKINGS, Ore. — An Oregon church has won its court battle to allow it to [keep feeding homeless people. ](/article/news/local/homeless/church-sues-restricting-homeless-meal-services/283-6d20ada9-3ea5-4fb5-bf6e-7705370299c5)It's something they've been doing for more than a decade, but the city of Brookings tried to limit their work. This long legal battle all started back in October 2021 when Brookings City Council approved an ordinance stopping churches from giving out free food in residential areas without a permit. This quickly upset Rev. Lindley from St. Timothy's Episcopal Church, who said feeding people is an essential part of their faith. \"That's the way we express our faith: by caring for people who are on the margins, especially people who are hungry,\" he said. [St. Timothy's Episcopal Church](https://www.sttimothyepiscopal.org/) has been a staple for those in need in Brookings, Oregon, serving free meals since 2009. During the pandemic, they upped services to meet demand, serving meals 6 days a week, but neighbors began to complain to the city about the gathering of homeless people. Some added that the homeless residents were bringing crime to the area and camping at the church. The city gave in, and in October 2021, it [approved an ordinance](/article/news/local/the-story/brookings-ordinance-churches-food-homeless/283-7f42c94d-2b63-48db-94a3-b0858e75656e) banning churches from giving out free food in residential areas without a permit. It also stopped the church from serving food more than two days a week. St. Timothy Episcopal Church ended up suing the city of Brookings, stating the ordinance violated their right to practice their religion freely. \"We knew that we weren't going to be able to comply with their ordinance,\" said Lindley. \"We knew that it was unconstitutional, so we reluctantly filed a lawsuit.\" On Wednesday, Judge Mark Clarke officially agreed with Lindley, siding with St. Timothy's in his ruling. The federal judge said the city has not provided a good enough reason to limit the days they can serve free meals. Lindley said all of this legal back-and-forth is a distraction. \"When we are involved in a lawsuit, we can't talk,\" said Lindley. \"We have to talk through our lawyers, which is not an official way to make our community a better place.\" The legal battle for St. Timothy's Episcopal Church isn't over yet: Right now, the city of Brookings has an abatement in place. The city is currently asking the church to stop shower and advocacy services also bringing in homeless people into the neighborhood. St. Timothy's has appealed the abatement.",
