    "title": "Così l'islam femminicida elogia la donna",
    "text": "Così l’islam femminicida elogia la donna\n«La questione femminile rappresenta una delle forze dell’islamÃ‚Â»: parola di ayatollah. E non un ayatollah qualsiasi, ma Ali Khamenei, Guida Suprema della Repubblica islamica dell’Iran. Il quale rimane serenamente indifferente (…)\n(…) al fatto che da anni – ma in particolare dalla fine del 2022, quando la giovane Mahsa Amini fu uccisa dalla «polizia morale» perché non indossava a norma di legge il velo obbligatorio – le giovani donne iraniane sfidano a rischio della morte l’oscurantismo del suo regime. Le donne iraniane, secondo Khamenei, sono le più fortunate del mondo. Perché se fossero per disgrazia nate invece in Occidente, sarebbero state trasformate soltanto in «uno strumento per guadagnare profitto o piacere».\nInsomma, invece di diventare donnine o donnacce come succede qui da noi, in Iran chi nasce femmina può godere appieno «della forte logica e delle basi razionali che l’islam possiede in tutte le aree che riguardano le donne». Ed ecco di seguito il pistolotto propagandistico che il capo del regime teocratico di Teheran ha rifilato alle delegazioni femminili giunte nella capitale iraniana per celebrare con lui l’anniversario della nascita della figlia del Profeta Maometto: «Non esistono restrizioni per le donne riguardo al lavoro o all’attivismo in politica, o in campo sociale e culturale. E perfino riguardo a questioni internazionali come l’attuale guerra a Gaza. A condizione però (eccolo, il però… nda) che queste attività non ostacolino i loro principali ed esclusivi doveri, ovvero prendersi cura della casa e della famiglia oltre che di crescere i bambini». Tutte queste attività, non va dimenticato, in Iran si possono svolgere in un solo modo: condividendo la linea del regime, ossia trasformandosi in un’attivista del regime stesso. Ogni altra manifestazione trasforma la donna in un nemico di Allah, degna quindi di persecuzione che può arrivare alla morte per mano dello Stato.\nLa donna dunque parola di Guida Suprema può e deve lavorare (se il marito è d’accordo), può occuparsi di politica, società e cultura solo secondo i dettami della religione di Stato, può manifestare la sua collera contro Israele e l’Occidente. Soprattutto, deve stare al suo posto: in casa a fare la moglie (sottomessa, come da Corano) e la madre. E, quando esce di casa, chiedere prima il permesso del marito: se lui non vuole che lei viaggi, niente. Anche sull’eventuale diritto al divorzio o alla custodia dei figli, dovrà rassegnarsi a leggi che sanciscono l’ineguaglianza dei sessi. Se finisce in carcere, poi, dovrà aspettarsi torture e stupri impuniti.\nMeno che mai dovrà sognarsi di contestare il dovere alla «moralità dei costumi»: «Massima attenzione a non suscitare attrazione sessuale sul posto di lavoro», velo in testa e vestiti castigati, pena le giuste aggressioni della polizia morale, che possono anche rivelarsi fatali, come è accaduto di recente a una ragazza di 16 anni nel metrò di Teheran. E, in caso di manifestazioni di piazza, sapere che i cecchini del regime mirano agli occhi delle donne che si tolgono il velo: tanto, in Occidente, quasi nessuno le difenderà. Abbiamo ben altro di cui indignarci, noi, qui c’è il patriarcato!",

    "title": "Lyme’s open space cheerleader says future is ‘set in stone’",
    "text": "Lyme’s open space cheerleader says future is ‘set in stone’ Lyme ― On a winter walk in the Pleasant Valley Preserve, Anthony Irving pointed to rocks rounded by a long-gone glacial river and to a white oak tree sitting out in the open where livestock once shaded themselves amid uniquely sweet acorns. Irving, president of the Lyme Land Trust and chairman of the Eightmile River Wild & Scenic coordinating committee, came upon his love of woods and rivers naturally. But his knowledge of the science behind it was honed through a master’s degree in conservation biology and ecology from Yale University. Until then, he was like the masses who appreciate the outdoors without realizing it holds so many clues to the past and so much hope for a green future. Irving is an advocate who has played no small role in the preservation of 12,000 acres of open space in town, a figure that represents half of its land mass. He was integral in the designation of the Eightmile River watershed as a resource worthy of federal protection. “You enjoy being there, relating to it,” he said of the town’s interconnected swath of protected land and the trails that wind through it. “You know it’s good for you physically. You know it’s good for you mentally. But you don’t know the science of it.” He showed off indentations in the land carved in some places by glacial melt and in other places by plodding cattle. He gestured to red cedar trees that grow out of pastures and remain as evidence of forgotten farms. The preserve covers woods, meadows and 3,500 feet of frontage along both sides of Eightmile River, which spills down from Chapman Falls at Devil’s Hopyard State Park and empties into the Connecticut River at Hamburg Cove. Born and raised in Wilton, he said he was drawn to land conservation because of the growth he saw in the suburban Fairfield County town. He cited a population of 1,500 when his mother was born in 1918 compared to almost 18,000 when she died in 2005. In that time, Lyme grew from 674 residents to 2,016. He attributed the slower growth to a preponderance of preserved land and to roads that “aren’t on the way to anywhere.” He noted the relatively small number of residents is a contrast to the town’s more populous agrarian roots, which were fed by proximity to the Connecticut River until depleting natural resources and the forces of industrialization reversed population trends in the rural town. Now, he said, “it’s hard for the town to change if the land isn’t there for it to change on.” Lyme Land Trust executive director Kristina White credited Irving with building relationships necessary to ensure undeveloped land stays that way, from his work with private landowners to town leaders to other nonprofit organizations like the Nature Conservancy for which the land trust oversees numerous preserves. “When you have that symbiosis, you’re going to get a lot of protected land,” she said. She said the clearest manifestation of the town’s focus on open space can be seen by those traveling by boat up the Connecticut River. She described Lyme on the right as being dominated by trees; on the left, “it’s one million-dollar house after another.” For Irving, open space is the bedrock of Lyme. It’s different from East Lyme, where concerns about the pace and extent of construction have revealed fissures in the town’s overall plan for what should be developed and what should be conserved. “Lyme is much more set in stone, so to speak, in terms of what it is and what it is going to be in the future,” he said. e.regan@theday.com Comments are limited to 200 words in length.

    "text": "Landing a job at a FAANG company (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) is a dream for many in tech. However, as more employees share their experiences, the glittering facade of these tech giants is starting to crack. Recently, an Amazon employee placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) took to social media to reveal their relief and newfound resolve to steer clear of any FAANG company in the future.\nThe Amazon employee recently shared their experience on social media after being placed on a PIP. They expressed relief at leaving the company with a tier-1 severance package, which amounts to 3.5 months of base pay.\nGot Piped from amazon , Yay - No more free bananas\nby u/DragZealousideal8287 in developersIndia\nIn their post, they candidly mentioned their decision to avoid FAANG companies in the future, opting instead for mid-sized, stable firms in less glamorous industries that offer more manageable workloads, even if the pay is only 40-50% of what FAANGs provide.\n\"I don't need money at the expense of my health deteriorating everyday,\" they noted.\nHow did people respond? This sparked a debate on how FAANG companies offer no work-life balance.\nOne person questioned why so many Amazon employees seem to be burnt out, leading to a flood of responses.\nAn employee shared their struggle, recounting a period of intense work: \"I was also doing excellent my first 2 years with close to promo. even after working 70 hrs per week - I was positive and excited. Last 6 months were disaster - reorgs, manager change, project shutdown, promo delayed - new manager too toxic and i am became scapegoat as newcomer is.\"\nCredit: Pixabay | Representational image\n\"Three years at Amazon is an achievement in itself,\" remarked another, highlighting the company's notorious work culture.\nSome suggested alternative options, with one commenter advocating for BISCO (Baidu, IBM, SAP, Cisco, Oracle) as preferable to the FAANG giants, citing better pay and a less stressful environment.\nThe debate underscores a growing sentiment that the high-stakes, high-pressure culture at the much sought-after FAANG companies might not be worth the toll on personal well-being.\nTo stay updated on the stories that are going viral, follow Indiatimes Trending .",

    "text": "Saint Augustine’s University is set to revolutionize its introductory biology education through participation in the Science Education Alliance program. The initiative aims to enrich students’ academic experience in the scientific disciplines. This transformative program will replace the traditional year-long biology laboratory curriculum with a hands-on research project, allowing students to engage in meaningful scientific exploration that culminates in potential presentations at academic meetings and publications in peer-reviewed journals.\nThe initiative is spearheaded by Dr. Sarah Straud, the biology program coordinator, alongside Dr. Tyrell Carr, associate dean of the School of Sciences, Mathematics, and Allied Health.\n“This opportunity expands the ability of Saint Augustine’s University to offer scholars cutting-edge and relevant experiences for competitive entry and matriculation in the scientific workforce, graduate school, and/or professional school centered on the life sciences,” said Dr. Carr. “In addition, this opportunity will strengthen and expand our program offerings in the biological and biomedical sciences as it relates to integrative and interdisciplinary science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) education and research.”\nThe SEA program is an initiative of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a prominent philanthropic organization dedicated to advancing biological research and fostering inclusive environments within the scientific community.\nCentral to this initiative is the SEA-PHAGES program, which involves student-led research aimed at isolating and characterizing new viruses that infect bacteria. Dr. Carr and Dr. Straud represented SAU at an informational meeting regarding the SEA program on Nov. 21, held at North Carolina Central University in Durham.\nChanging Biology Education among the NC10 While SEA-PHAGES has been operational since 2008, the current phase focuses on ten historically Black colleges and universities in North Carolina, collectively referred to as NC10.\nThe NC10 consortium includes N.C. Central University, Shaw University, Winston-Salem State University, North Carolina A&T University, Johnson C. Smith University, Fayetteville State University, Bennett College, Livingstone College, and Elizabeth City State University.\nThe program features several key experiences for participating students:\n1. In the first phase, selected undergraduates from each NC10 institution will receive a stipend of $7,000 and housing for an eight-week summer research experience at North Carolina Central University in 2025.\n2. The second phase, pending approval, would allow students trained in SEA-PHAGES to engage in a year-long research project at their home institution, supported by stipends and funding from HHMI.\n3. The final experience, also tentative, offers students an additional eight-week summer research opportunity in 2026 within the laboratory of an HHMI Investigator, complete with financial support for both stipend and housing.\nAt SAU, Dr. Straud will incorporate the SEA-PHAGES project into the BIOL 133L – Principles of Biology Part 1 Lab and BIOL 134L – Principles of Biology Part 2 ab courses, with implementation expected to start in Fall 2025. Dr. Straud will take on the role of faculty lead for this initiative and serve as a research mentor for the second phase alongside Dr. Carr.",

    "text": "JANESVILLE — Fair Share America brought its “Stop the Billionaire Giveaways” national bus tour to Janesville Friday to rally with the United Auto Workers Local 95 healthcare workers. The workers have been on strike from the Mercyhealth East clinic to receive what they say would be fairer wages and safer working conditions. “Safety isn’t a luxury, it isn’t a bargaining chip. It isn’t a maybe. It’s a necessity. It is the foundation of good care. This company has shown that they have enough money…to give you a fair agreement. You can look at these bloated salaries…of the CEO, of the executives here. It’s a runaway train and it’s absolutely disgusting,” said Andrew Stark, UAW Region 4 servicing representative and the workers’ lead negotiator. “We are being told by Mercy Health that they cannot afford security, yet they can afford to pay themselves millions of dollars.” The 45-foot tour bus was wrapped in a giant “trillion-dollar bill” with a message saying “a fair share for Americans,” pulled up to a picket line of at least 100 workers,” Fair Share America said in a statement. “What you’re doing for your patients and for the broader Janesville community should be celebrated,” said Fair Share America Executive Director Kristen Crowell, who spoke to the picket line alongside the union workers. “The CEOs are stealing from us. Government is taking our tax dollars to give away to rich people. It’s all a scam. And unless we stand up and we say ‘no’ and we organize something radically different in this country, we’re going back to the status quo.” In July, Mercyhealth Vice President of Operations Jenni Hallat told The Gazette that her organization has treated its 137 partners at Mercyhealth East “fairly,” which has been consistent with its other 8,000-plus employees and partners. UAW 95 has since opened a food pantry and a strike fund for the workers.",

    "text": "Este verano llega con toda su energía y con él, esa necesidad de renovar el clóset con piezas frescas, cómodas y llenas de estilo. Este 2025, los trajes de baño no solo están pensados para la playa o la piscina, sino que se convierten en prendas versátiles que se combinan con pareos, pantalones fluidos o camisas abiertas para crear looks que van más allá del agua.\nDesde opciones clásicas reinventadas hasta propuestas audaces que celebran la individualidad, esta temporada ofrece un traje de baño para cada tipo de cuerpo, estilo y plan veraniego. A continuación, descubre las tendencias más populares en bikinis y trajes de baño con lo último del verano 2025.\nPUBLICIDAD\nColores ácidos: vive el verano en technicolor\nLos tonos vibrantes y neón invaden la pasarela playera y esta tendencia, “bright and bold” predomina, haciendo que los bañadores en color lima, magenta o naranja sean la elección perfecta para aportar energía y alegría al look veraniego.\nDetalles metálicos: resplandor sin esfuerzo\nLos acabados metálicos y brillo líquido serán una de las grandes sensaciones del verano. Ya sea en tejidos brillantes o en hardware: cadenas, hebillas o broches, este toque dorado o plateado aporta glamour sin renunciar a la sofisticación.\nDark florals: romántico con actitud\nFlores oscuras y contrastes dramáticos marcan la tendencia en trajes de baño. El estampado floral en tonos intensos como azul noche, negro o borgoña profundo añade elegancia y un aire nostálgico, con acabados texturizados que elevan el clásico motivo floral a una propuesta moderna y sofisticada.\nCopas fruncidas (ruched cups): volumen favorecedor\nEl ruche y acolchado en las copas es tendencia imprescindible. No solo añade textura y dimensión, sino que realza la figura con un estilo femenino y favorecedor. Este detalle de volumen y movimiento aparece tanto en tops de bikini como en bañadores completos.\nAdornos florales\nLos apliques florales 3D, como rosetones o pétalos, son la máxima expresión femenina para la playa. Colocados en tirantes, escotes o costados, estos adornos elevan el bañador a una prenda estrella, llena de romanticismo.\nPUBLICIDAD\nEn definitiva, los trajes de baño de verano 2025 no solo son una invitación a lucir bien, sino una forma de expresar quién eres y cómo te relacionas con el mundo que te rodea.\nCada color, cada detalle metálico, cada flor o textura cuenta una historia de confianza, autenticidad y creatividad. Este verano, más que seguir una moda, se trata de celebrar tu esencia con piezas que te hagan sentir poderosa, cómoda y libre.",
