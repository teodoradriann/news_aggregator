    "text": "Director of Field Hospitals at the Ministry of Health in Gaza, Dr Marwan Al Hams, said that the health sector is being subjected to a systematic Israeli aggression through preventing the entry of medicines, besieging and targeting hospitals and medical staff.\nIn a statement to Qatar News Agency (QNA) Al Hams confirmed that the Israeli occupation forces aim to destroy what remains of the health infrastructure in Gaza, after destroying 75 percent of it. He pointed to the ongoing aggression on Kamal Adwan Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip, and the killing and arrest of doctors and their families.\nHe explained that patients suffer greatly due to the lack of medicines, food and blankets for them, and the depletion of medicines for those with chronic diseases, which caused them serious complications and some of them lost their lives.\nThe Director of Field Hospitals pointed out the increasing number of patients suffering from dehydration, malnutrition and death from hunger, in a precedent that doctors had not experienced before the genocidal war waged by the Israeli occupation forces on the Gaza Strip.\nHe stated that the deteriorating situation has reached a severe shortage in medical laboratory supplies and materials, and that the occupation is preventing the entry of devices for conducting medical examinations after most of them have broken down. He called for the need to pressure the occupation to stop its war on Gaza, so that the health sector can provide services to Palestinian citizens. (QNA)",

    "text": "Slipknot turntablist Sid Wilson found himself in the hospital after he suffered burns across most of his body earlier this month. However, the injuries weren’t due to malfunctioning stage pyrotechnics. Instead, Wilson suffered burns while dealing with a burn pile on his Iowa farm.\nWilson shared how the incident happened online. “A few nights ago, I lit it and let it burn down,” he said of the burn pile. “So, the next day, I went to check and see, you know, how much was left, if anything. There was a certain amount of debris around the side still left. So I, like a dummy, did what I’m not supposed to do and I added some gas to it,” he explained.\nIn a recent interview with Fox News , Wilson gave an update on his physical and mental health after the burns.\n[RELATED: Slipknot’s Sid Wilson Hospitalized After Suffering Burns on Face and Arms]\nSlipknot’s Sid Wilson Gives an Update on His Injuries Sid Wilson spent the night in the hospital before returning home to heal. “My whole right arm is bandaged up, half of my left arm,” he said. “My face is basically melted from the nose down. But the swelling’s gone down, and they said the face is kind of amazing that it’s regenerative, it happens real fast, seems to heal quickly,” Wilson added. “I’ve had better days, I guess, but I’m alive, so I’m doing good.”\nWilson is healing and seems to be in good spirits for the most part. “I’m not going to let it get me depressed,” he said of the incident. “The hardest part is just feeling stupid for doing it. It’s not even the physical part. It’s thinking, ‘Oh, man, I really learned that the hard way. I’ve got to make sure I just slow down sometimes and really examine the situation before I just dive in headfirst,” he added.\nAccording to a statement from the band, Wilson will join Slipknot when their Here Comes the Pain Tour resumes on September 1 at the Rocklahoma Festival in Pryor, Oklahoma.\nWilson walked away from the incident with a piece of advice for everyone. “Don’t f—k with fire. It’s going to win every time.”\nFeatured Image by Daniel DeSlover/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock",

    "title": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard shares first selfie following her release from prison | The Independent",
    "text": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard has shared her first selfie following her release from prison , after pleading guilty in 2016 to the second-degree murder of her mother, Clauddine “Dee Dee” Blanchard.The 32-year-old took to Instagram on 29 December to share the mirror selfie, one day after her release from Chillicothe Correctional Center in Missouri. Blanchard had served 85 per cent of her sentence, eight years after confessing that she and her online boyfriend - Nicholas Godejohn - plotted to kill her mother. Following Blanchard’s arrest, an investigation found that she was abused by her mother Dee Dee, who forced her to pretend she was disabled since childhood.In the new mirror selfie, Blanchard could be seen posing in a pair of jeans and an ombre blue and white long-sleeved shirt, as she smiled for the camera. She appeared to have taken the picture in a hotel room, as two of her suitcases were opened on the floor.She commemorated the new picture in the caption, writing: “First selfie of freedom!”Back in 2015, Godejohn stabbed Dee Dee at least 17 times at her home in Springfield, Missouri, as Blanchard hid in a bathroom during the assault . Following the assault, Godejohn and Blanchard reportedly stole money from Dee Dee, before travelling to Wisconsin by bus.After authorities were alerted of a post on Dee Dee’s Facebook page - which read, “That B*** is dead!” - her body was found on 14 June 2015. While Blanchard’s community was initially concerned about her disappearance, Blanchard and Godejohn were later arrested and charged with murder.Blanchard pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 2016, while Godejohn was eventually found guilty and sentenced to life in prison for murder and 25 years for armed criminal action.Until the age of 24, Blanchard was psychologically and physically abused by her mother, who forced her to pretend she was disabled. Dee Dee reportedly had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, forcing her daughter to pass herself off as chronically ill. In the aftermath of Blanchard’s arrest, her neighbours told the media that she always used a wheelchair and that Dee Dee had claimed her daughter had leukaemia, muscular dystrophy, and several other chronic conditions.Investigations later determined that Dee Dee may have made up the claims to obtain financial gain and sympathy. Among those claims, Dee Dee had also alleged that she and her daughter were victims of Hurricane Katrina and were displaced by the disaster in 2005. As a result, the charity Habitat for Humanity built a small home with a wheelchair ramp in Springfield for the Blanchards.In a 2019 interview with ABC News , Blanchard said that she realised her mother was lying about many of her conditions. She also claimed that her mother forced her to take medication that she didn’t need, with some of the medication causing her teeth to fall out “There are certain illnesses that I know I didn’t have, I know I didn’t need the feeding tube,” Blanchard said. “I knew that I could eat and I knew that I could walk, but I believed my mother when she said I had leukaemia.”In a recent interview with People published on the day of her release, Blanchard opened up about what’s next in her future. She told the outlet that she’s remaining focused on her loved ones, including her husband Ryan Scott Anderson - a special education teacher she met in 2020 after he sent her letters while in prison. In July 2022, the couple tied the knot during a small ceremony at the Missouri correctional facility.\"My husband Ryan has been an emotional backbone for the last three years,” she said. “We met when the pandemic was really, really strong and I had a lot of emotional ups and downs because of Covid.”Blanchard noted that following her release, she and her husband are planning on starting a family of their own. However, she discussed some of the difficult conversations she may have with her children about DeDe one day.“We’re in love,” she said, before adding: “It’s hard because I’m going into a new life and I’m newly married, and I’m going to have kids one day, and I’m going to have to explain to my kids why their grandmother on mommy’s side isn’t around. And that’s going to be a really hard conversation.”Weeks before her release from prison, Blanchard told TMZ that she wants to meet pop star Taylor Swift. She revealed that she and her husband have tickets for the Kansas City Chiefs game at Arrowhead Stadium on 31 December, in hopes of seeing NFL star Travis Kelce’s girlfriend there. Swift has made multiple appearances at his games since September.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later? Start your Independent Premium subscription today.",

The policy will provide athletes a cover of Rs 25 lakh, announced state finance minister Diya Kumari here on Wednesday.An amount of Rs 50 crore has also been proposed for Khelo Rajasthan.Former international and Indian squash team coach Surbhi Misra called it a 'great vision'. \\\"The welfare of sport and sportspersons is very clearly reflected in the sports budget. CM Bhajan Lal Sharma, deputy CM Diya Kumari and sports minister RS Rathore have spelled out a great vision for promoting sports in Rajasthan. I'm sure this step will put Rajasthan on the sporting map of India,\\\" she said.The budget also includes an increase in mess allowance to Rs 4,000, one district one sport scheme, an academy for popular sports in each district and Rs 250 crore to establish Maharana Pratap Sports University.National handball player Prachi Gurjar pointed out that an increase in the amount will help athletes improve their diet, 'an important factor in the performance'. \\\"Most athletes struggle to get a proper diet.

    "title": "This Afeela EV by Sony and Honda May Be Both Too Old And Too New To Be Viable",
    "text": "Sony has been showcasing an EV prototype car at CES for several years, but it looks like they are close to production this year. Apple considered making EVs but pulled the plug after investing around $1B in the project. Sony moved into a partnership with Honda and now appears ready to release its first car in 2026.\nHowever, the design of the Sony Afeela hasn’t aged well and looks outdated. At the same time, the signature interior capabilities of the car are problematic before Level 4 autonomous driving, and this car is a Level 2+ offering.\nLet’s talk about why this car is too old and new for the market.\nThe BYD Problem\nBYD and other Chinese manufacturers are bringing ever-more-affordable, great EVs that vastly undercut Teslas, with the same features. Chinese car companies also seem to be cycling their designs far more quickly than traditional car makers, suggesting that designs in this segment must move to market quickly or be outdated at launch.\nSony has been working on this car for years. While the design resembles a blend of Lucid and Tesla, both car makers have had stable designs for years, making the design language rather dated.\nAt the high end, BYD cars sell for well under $100K, but this Sony Afeela car will initially be offered for over $100K, effectively pricing it above the Chinese competition it will face in most markets. China is changing the EV game, and Sony appears to be operating off data years out of date.\nDesign\nThe Afeela (I'm not a fan of the name) is designed as a rolling living room. Many displays and entertainment opportunities will be critical when we finally have Level 4/5 cars entering the market. However, Level 2+ cars, and the Afeela is expected to be Level 2+, require the driver to stay engaged and not be distracted while driving. Thus, the multiple screens in the Afeela can’t legally be used to their full entertainment potential until the car is parked.\nSony lost to Apple because it embraced Digital Rights Management (DRM) while Apple didn’t, and Apple took the market for MP3 players from Sony. Sony and many Japanese firms have had this problem historically; they feel they need to parent their customers so that they will conform to legal behavior.\nThis means Sony tends to overprotect the drivers and passengers, which could be great if you have kids but not so much if you want the freedom to make your own choices. The resulting rigid rules and hard-wired protections will likely upset the initial buyers, making it difficult for Sony to build advocacy for its brand in cars.\nThe Sony Brand\nThe Sony brand was robust in quality from the 60s to the 90s. However, it fell sharply this century, mainly due to a lack of focus on technology and user experience. They still build good products but don’t seem to have the halo of quality and exclusiveness they enjoyed in the days of the Sony receivers, tape players, and Trinitron TVs. Sony still makes car stereos, but they are no longer considered a leading brand, and the aftermarket car stereo business has declined over the years because too many car stereos are designed into cars these days and nearly impossible to replace with anything but another unit from the carmaker.\nThus, the Sony brand will likely not play that well with cars since the brand's connection has always been weak (they just aren’t in the car business) and has gotten weaker over the last several decades.\nPerformance\nThe performance of the Sony car in terms of range and power would be decent if the car had come out last decade. Still, now 300 miles of range is on the low side for cars coming in 2026, and Sony doesn’t appear to be pushing for a lot of power, suggesting acceleration will be towards the middle back of the pack for cars in the Afeela price range.\nAnd even if they upped the performance, Sony isn’t a performance brand; it is a quality brand but quality concerning entertainment, not transportation. One interesting aspect of the car is that many of the features are supported through paid subscriptions, initially prepaid, but eventually needing to charge monthly after the first 3 years of ownership, and car buyers have largely rejected this subscription model for anything other than connectivity, which is the one exception.\nIn the end this car feels like the car itself was designed for the market as it existed around a decade ago in terms of performance and appearance, but with an interior that won’t be viable until around a decade from now when we get Level 4 autonomous driving at scale.\nWrapping Up:\nThe exterior design is about a decade out of date, the interior features are about a decade too early to be fully appreciated, and Sony’s brand isn’t yet connected to automobiles. This means this car will either need to be redesigned so it better fits today’s market, or it will need a ton of marketing to get people to see the car for its potential and get over the problem of the wave of subscriptions you’ll need if you keep the car over 3 years.\nI don’t yet see this as a formula for success. Instead, it feels a bit like how they lost the MP3 player market to Apple. They don’t seem to get that EV drivers will want better performance and will not be able to use all of the screens in this car very well until the self-driving technology matures.\nI think Sony and Honda need to rethink this effort if they don’t want another embarrassing failure or to prove Apple’s decision to abandon this market was right.\nRob Enderle is a technology analyst at Torque News who covers automotive technology and battery developments.
