    "title": "Our Robot Harvests Cotton by Reaching Out and Plucking It, Like a Lizard`s Tongue Snatching Flies | Farms.com",
    "text": "By Hussein Gharakhani Cotton is one of the most valuable crops grown in the U.S., with a harvest value of some US$7 billion yearly. It is cultivated across a crescent of 17 states stretching from Virginia to California and is used in virtually every type of clothing, as well as in medical supplies and home goods such as upholstery. Cotton grows inside a hard, fibrous case called a boll. About 100 days after planting, the bolls mature and split open, revealing thousands of fluffy white fibers inside. Each boll contains 20 to 40 seeds with fibers attached to them, which is why the cotton plant's fruit is called seed cotton. Picking cotton manually, as is still done in some major producing countries, is a meticulous task. Workers have to bend to reach the bolls and can hurt their hands on hard, dry parts of the plants. To harvest the seed cotton, they have to grab and twist it to separate it from the boll without leaving fiber behind. Starting in the 1930s, cotton farmers in the U.S. shifted from manual labor to large, heavy harvesters. Now the industry is entering a new stage that promises to be more efficient and precise. I am an engineer and have nearly 20 years of research experience working on agricultural machinery. My current focus is on agricultural robotics and automation. During my Ph.D. program at Mississippi State University, I worked with Alex Thomasson, who heads the agricultural and biological engineering department and the Agricultural Autonomy Institute, to develop a robotic cotton harvester that picks cotton with less damage to the product and the soil where it grows. Cotton farmers have economic, environmental and agricultural reasons to want a better option for harvesting. Traditional mechanical harvesters can be up to 14 feet long and weigh more than 30 tons. They remove cotton effectively without damaging the plants but also can cause problems. One issue is prolonged fiber exposure. Cotton bolls don't all mature at the same time; the first open bolls in a field may wait for up to 50 days to be picked, until more bolls around them ripen. Another challenge is that harvesting machines compact the soil as they roll over it. This makes it harder for water and fertilizer to penetrate down to plant roots. And the machines cost roughly US$1 million apiece but are used for only two to three months each year. Robotics is a potential solution that farmers are already using for other crops, such as fruits and vegetables. Harvesting robots use cameras and sensors to detect when crops are ready to pick and can remove them without damaging the plant. For cotton, robotics offers more targeted picking of bolls that are ready to harvest. It produces better-quality cotton fiber by picking seed cotton as soon as the bolls open, without leaving it exposed to the weather. The robot targets the seed cotton and avoids touching other parts of the plant. With robotic picking, cotton farmers don't need to use defoliants to remove leaves from the plants prior to harvesting, which is a common practice now. And small, nimble robots don't compress the soil as they move over it, so they help maintain soil health. Our work focuses on designing an end-effector for robotic cotton harvesting. An end-effector is a robotic hand that enables the robot to interact with other objects. Ours is a three-fingered version designed for delicate and efficient cotton picking. It draws inspiration from nature, mimicking the hunting prowess of a lizard. Each finger is a 3D-printed structure that contains a moving belt with pins attached to it. The pins help the hand grasp and pull in the seed cotton. Like a lizard snatching prey with its sticky tongue, our end-effector's three fingers approach the seed cotton delicately. On contact, the cotton fibers stick to the machine's fingers, much as an insect sticks to a lizard's tongue. Next, the hand retracts quickly, like the lizard's tongue. The end-effector keeps working to \"swallow\" the seed cotton, transferring it out of the plant. As the harvester picks and transfers seed cotton out of the plant, the end-effector touches parts of the cotton boll with remaining seed cotton multiple times to pick as much as possible. To pick cotton efficiently, our robot has to do three things: detect bolls that are ready for harvest, determine exactly where they are located in a three-dimensional space and pick the cotton. The robot uses a deep-learning algorithm that we have trained to recognize open bolls on cotton plants. It uses a stereovision camera to calculate their 3D spatial coordinates, which it transfers to the robotic arm. A control algorithm monitors each cotton boll to ensure that the robot picks as much seed cotton as possible. So far, we have tested the robotic cotton harvester in the laboratory and in cotton fields. The detection system found 78% of ripe cotton bolls; the localization system calculated 3D coordinates for 70% of the detected bolls; and the picking system successfully harvested 83% of these bolls. Overall, the robot picked about 50% of the cotton bolls that were within its reach. Our harvester picked cotton at a speed of 8.8 seconds per boll. If we can decrease this required time to 0.3 seconds and increase the robot's efficiency to pick at least 90% of the cotton bolls it can reach, by optimizing the system and adding more arms on a robot, a fleet of 50 robots could harvest a cotton field as quickly as a mechanical harvester, with a comparable yield. To improve the robot's overall performance, we plan to adopt better artificial intelligence algorithms, improve our system's camera and add another degree of movement to the robotic arm - for example, enabling the end-effector to rotate - to increase its dexterity. We see great potential for our robot in major cotton-producing countries such as China, India, Pakistan and Uzbekistan, where cotton is currently picked by hand, often by women and children and sometimes under abusive conditions. One way to make this technology available for small farmers in low-income countries would be to make smaller, semi-autonomous robots that would require fewer sensors. Producing higher-value cotton with less damage to plants and soil could improve life for millions of people who earn their livings raising this global crop.",

    "text": "Nikki Haley didn't say slavery caused the Civil War. Now she's facing major backlash Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is facing significant backlash after failing to mention slavery as a driving force behind the Civil War during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. At an event on Wednesday, a voter asked Haley: \"what was the cause of the United States Civil War?\" She replied that the cause \"was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn't do.\" \"I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,\" Haley continued. \"And I will always stand by the fact that, I think, government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people.\" After Haley gave her answer, the voter told her that it was \"astonishing\" that she gave an answer \"without mentioning the word 'slavery.'\" Last night, [President Biden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1740221284284256645?) said on X in response to a video of this exchange that the Civil War was indeed \"about slavery.\" It was about slavery.— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) [https://t.co/q9bTDvtPne] [December 28, 2023] During an interview with a local radio station on Thursday, Haley addressed what happened. \"Of course the Civil War was about slavery,\" she said. \"We know that. That's the easy part of it.\" Haley explained that she was interested in talking about what lessons should be drawn from the Civil War and defended her answer to the voter. \"I know it's about slavery,\" she said. \"I am from the South.\" Haley has a [complicated history](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/15/1157122486/nikki-haley-confederate-flag-race-president-2024) when it comes to issues of race. As a woman of color, her campaign was angling to strike a different tone on issues of race and identity – especially in comparison to her chief rival in the GOP primary, former President Donald Trump. As South Carolina's governor, Haley ordered the confederate flag be removed from the grounds of the state capitol following the 2015 shooting of Black parishioners at a church in Charleston in 2015. Haley also [condemned Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/25/haley-trump-charlottesville-comments-401587) following the racist and antisemitic gathering in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. (She also served as U.N. ambassador to Trump from 2017 to 2018.) The Republican Party, though, has been striking an overall different tone when it comes to issues of race and the country's history with slavery and white supremacy. Republican governors, including some of Haley's rivals in the race, have been [eliminating](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/15/1176210007/florida-ron-desantis-dei-ban-diversity) diversity and inclusion efforts in higher education, as well as [banning books](https://www.wusf.org/education/2023-06-01/politifact-fl-desantis-said-not-a-single-book-was-banned-districts-have-removed-dozens) that are about race. Backlash to Haley's comments comes less than three weeks before Republican voters start voting in early primary states. The Iowa caucus, the first primary contest, is Jan. 15. Haley's campaign, in particular, has had a surprising amount of momentum in the last several months. The once crowded field of presidential hopefuls has been shrinking ahead of early state elections but Haley has been one of the few candidates actually gaining more support. Just this week, there have been reports that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' campaign is [struggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/politics/desantis.html) and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy has [cut TV ad spending](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/27/1221828944/vivek-ramaswamys-campaign-has-slowed-tv-ad-spending-ahead-of-the-iowa-caucus). Trump has had a commanding lead in the polls in early states and nationally. Haley, however, has been the only candidate in the primary that has presented any sort of challenge for the former president. Haley routinely polls second or third in early state polling and performs well when in head-to-head polling with Biden. Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

    "text": "(CTN News) – At least ten members of a minority Christian community were rescued on Saturday when a Muslim crowd attacked their hamlet in eastern Pakistan on blasphemy charges, according to police and a community leader.\nAccording to Shariq Kamal, the police chief of Sargodha district, the crowd accused the Christian group of blasphemy and threw stones and bricks at the police.\nProtesters set fire to at least one house and a small shoe business after neighbors claimed that a minority community member had desecrated the Muslim holy book, the Koran, according to a police official and Christian leader Akmal Bhatti.\n“They burned one house” and severely battered several Christians, Bhatti stated.\nAccording to Kamal, a strong presence of police walled off the community and pushed the crowd back. One member of the Christian community who was transported to the hospital was later reported to be in stable condition.\nAccording to police official Assad Malhi, approximately 25 demonstrators have been arrested, and 11 police officers were injured during the operation to rescue Christian community members from the crowd.\nBackground on Blasphemy Laws and the Christian Community Police said the situation had cooled by late evening, and leaders from both sides had asked for peace.\nMinority Rights March, a Christian rights organization, reported that the crowd battered and dragged a 70-year-old man convicted of blasphemy.\nIt stated that camera footage indicated that the police did not interfere. The cops have disputed the accusation.\nSocial media videos showed demonstrators looting stuff from burning buildings. Others were observed setting fire to the things in a pile on the roadway.\nBhatti stated that the tapes showed photos from the scene.\nReuters could not independently authenticate the images.\nAccording to Pakistan’s independent Human Rights Commission, the Christian community is “at grave risk to their lives at the hands of the charged mobs”.\nBlasphemy is a delicate issue in conservative Muslim-majority Pakistan, where even an accusation might result in a street lynching.\nHuman rights groups claim that Pakistan’s draconian blasphemy laws are frequently used to settle personal scores.\nWhile blasphemy is punished by death in Pakistan, no one has been executed by the state despite countless lynchings by enraged mobs.\nLast year, a Muslim mob stormed a Christian community in eastern Pakistan, vandalizing numerous churches and setting fire to scores of homes after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Koran.",

    "text": "9-year-old Utah girl becomes investing whiz\nClick here for updates on this story\nOGDEN, Utah (\nKSTU) — Cold hard cash gifted to kids for Christmas may have a better use than being spent on the newest video game or stylish new sneakers.\nJust ask 9-year-old Elsa Kate Dees in Ogden who is already earning awards for her stellar saving.\nHigh-yield savings accounts offer about a 5% annual return and dabbling in the stock market can be even more lucrative. The S&P 500 averages about a 10% gain every year.\nWhile investing was once reserved for adults, it’s now accessible to kids under their parent’s supervision.\nElsa doesn’t complain about doing chores as she knows each completed task will earn her a little money from her parents.\nBut instead of running out the door to spend her cash, Elsa has bigger goals in mind.\n“Make sure you save your money instead of just spending it all the time,” she explained to FOX 13 News.\nThe fourth grader saves her money in an app called “Busy Kid.” She did so well with her savings this year that the developers honored her with their “Best of the Best” award for 2023.\n“In a world where finances are in a mess this is exactly what we are trying to do,” explained Gregg Murset, CEO of Busy Kid. “Change the next generation in how they think about this stuff.”\nMurset said the app allows kids to invest their money and use their very own debit card to make purchases with parental approval.\nHe believes that children as young as 5 years old, kindergartners, can learn smart financial habits.\n“If they can learn it early in life, it changes how they think about money, how they deal with their own money and it sets them up for success in the future,” Murset said.\nElsa’s parents have the same mindset, encouraging their daughter to categorize her money into savings, spending and charitable contributions.\n“I hope these principles set in and they stick she can take these her whole life,” reflected Matt Dees, Elsa’s father. “It gives her this great foundation of financial achievements we want to instill in our kids.\nElsa is saving up with her sights set on a trip to Harry Potter’s Wizarding World in Florida.\n“I have been trying to save everything,” she explained. “It’s easy to save money because then you’ll have more money that you can get other things that you want instead of just spending it really fast.”\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "text": "Actress and artist Tommi Rose. Photo Credit: Paul Smith Actress and artist Tommi Rose chatted about starring in “Sweet Magnolias” and the western “A Gunfighter’s Deal.”\n‘Sweet Magnolias’ On being a part of “Sweet Magnolias,” she said, “It was just lovely. The whole cast is so kind and welcoming. They are just wonderful people. My character, Olivia, was in the last few episodes of Season 3, and they are about to film Season 4, so I am ready for it.”\nShe had great words about working with such actors as Carson Rowland and Logan Allen. “I love them both, they are so great,” she said, prior to adding that she is looking forward to start filming Season 4 this February. “We are all so excited to film Season 4. We are excited to see what the writers of the show have in store for us,” she admitted.\n‘A Gunfighter’s Deal’ She enjoyed filming the western “A Gunfighter’s Deal,” where she stars opposite Jesse Kove (“Cobra Kai”). “This western was absolutely lovely,” she said. “Jesse Kove is an incredible scene partner, I play his love interest., and he is just wonderful. Jesse treats everyone with love and respect. It really was the best project. The set was beautiful and the cast was great, it was an amazing combination.”\n“The script is so cool,” she admitted. “I feel it is every actor’s dream to do a western and to work with horses. On the first day when I arrived on set and saw two horses, I knew that I was in the right place, and I love that. It’s so great. The costumes are beautiful and the whole production is insane.”\n“There is a romance going on, and there is a darker aspect going on. It really is exciting from start to finish because you don’t know where it’s going,” she added.\nThe digital age On being an artist and actress in the digital age, she said, “There are pros and cons to it. Everybody misses the good ole days, where you are not taking pictures all the time.”\n“At the same time, I love the aspect that you can preserve things forever,” she said. “You can post about things that excite you and you can stay connected with people. I am grateful for the positive side of that.”\n‘A Savannah Haunting’ She had a starring role as Lilath in the horror movie “A Savannah Haunting,” which was written and directed by William Mark McCullough . “That was a very scary film… Honestly, you might be scared of me by the end of it,” she said with a sweet laugh.\n“I’ve had a few people messaging me saying that I scared them in that movie, so I guess I did my job,” she added.\nAmbition to go into screenwriting and directing Her goal is to venture more into screenwriting and directing. “My brother, Maxim Rose, encouraged me to start writing my own screenplays and my own series. This past summer, during the strike, I wrote this mocumentary comedy series and I produced and directed a concept pilot for it and it was amazing. I also wrote a feature film. I’ve been very busy but I love it,” she elaborated.\nAdvice for young and aspiring artists For young and aspiring actors and artists, she said, “Follow your gut. I’m a very big believer in following your instincts, and trusting your creative intuition. Obviously, never give up and keep pushing and keep doing what your heart is telling you to do, and eventually, people will resonate with that.”\nShe also expressed that she loves pop music artist and actress Nicole Michelle , especially since they did a Lionsgate movie together.\nStage of her life On the title of the current chapter of her life, she said, “Good changes are happening.” “I wrote a song recently, and one of the lines was ‘I feel it in my bones I’ve changed’ so I feel like that’s it. I feel like many good changes are happening,” she said.\nIf she were to have any superpower, it would be to “change the size of things.” “First of all, you can immediately solve world hunger and there are so many things you can do. You can make any clothes fit you, you can make houses for people, you can shrink wounds, and you can literally solve every problem with that superpower,” she explained.\nSuccess Regarding her definition of the word success, she said, “Success is happiness to me. Whatever makes you happy. If you are doing something that truly feels right in your soul and you feel content, that is success. It is being happy with where you are.”\nTo learn more about Tommi Rose, follow her on Instagram .",

    "title": "How Greenland’s meltwater gets retained in its thawing ice sheet",
    "text": "Greenland’s sprawling mile-thick ice sheet is shedding water at an alarming rate as the planet warms, causing sea levels to rise, but the how this glacial meltwater behaves has not been well understood.\nNew research conducted by an international team of geologists has developed a way to characterize how it moves through the ice and the timing of the meltwater’s exit into the ocean. The ice sheet temporarily holds a surprisingly large amount of meltwater during the Arctic summer before it reaches the sea, the researchers discovered.\nThe team’s novel methodology, based on satellite positioning data gathered by a network of geodetic stations along Greenland’s ice-free coast, will help improve the models scientists use to predict changes in sea level in response to climate change, said\nTonie van Dam, a University of Utah geology professor who contributed to the research led by Denmark’s Delft University of Technology. Using this data, scientists may be able to better forecast sea levels as far out as a century into the future.\n“We could start planning for that before we had this simple picture of what was happening. It was getting warmer, the snow was melting and going into the oceans, but then we learned that’s not quite how it is,” said van Dam, who co-authored\nthe study published in Nature along with U colleague Lin Liu, a visiting scholar from the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n“The surface is melting, but it’s also greasing the bottom of glaciers, so our glaciers are moving faster as well,” van Dam continued. “So every time we learn something like this, it helps us and fine-tune the simple model so that we can have better predictions about what sea level is going to do.”\nAnd just as important is the team’s insights into interpreting data from the Greenland GPS Network (\nGN ET) in new ways that illuminate the thawing of Greenland’s vast collection of glaciers.\n“Understanding how water is stored and released within the ice sheet has always been a challenge,” said team leader\nPavel Ditmar in a news release Delft University issued.\nAbout 55% of global sea level rise since 2000 can be attributed to meltwater, and Greenland’s shrinking ice sheet is the largest contributor. It is melting faster than the larger ice sheet covering Antarctica.\nGreenland’s ice sheet is shaped like an upside bowl, thickest at the middle and tapering around the sides.\n“Most melting is not occurring at the top because it’s very cold and dry,” Liu said. “Most melting occurs near the edge of the ice.”\nThe ice sheet averages a mile in thickness, covering 660,000 square miles, or 80% of Greenland, the world’s largest island. It is currently losing ice at the fastest rate in at least 12,000 years. Today it holds 700,000 cubic miles of ice. Were it all to melt, sea levels would rise about 7 meters, rendering coastal areas around the world uninhabitable and reordering ecosystems on a massive scale.\nMeanwhile, meltwater’s journey from the ice sheet to the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans is not straightforward. Much of it forms lakes on the ice then flows into layers of compressed snow, known as firn, glacial cavities or lingers at ice-bedrock interface. How much water is stored in these places and for how long has been an open question that should be answered to enable scientists to accurate predict how Greenland meltwater will affect global sea levels, according to van Dam.\nThe study describes an innovative way to track this water’s movement using positioning data generated by a network of geodetic stations that have been deployed along the Greenland coast for years.\nVan Dam herself helped install some of the first stations on the island back in the 1990s, and the network has since grown to 58 GNET stations, now maintained by the Danish government after years of U.S. National Science Foundation support.\nThe equipment measures the minute movements of the bedrock, both vertically and horizontally, as water moves around the ice sheet and out to sea. In other words, the ground rises and falls ever so slightly in response to the loss and return of ice.\n“This paper reported a residual of an observation after making many corrections and removing many signals. After doing that, we’re talking about five millimeters, which is very small, and that’s on the seasonal scale, from May to July,” Liu said. “We can show how much water has been temporarily retained or stored and how that is expressed in terms of the time evolution over a season from May to July to October, and how that retention varies across the peripheral region of Greenland.”\nThe study was published on Oct. 30, 2024, in Nature under the title,\nVertical bedrocks shifts reveal summer water storage in Greenland ice sheet. Other institutions involved with this research include the Southern University of Science and Technology in China; Utrecht University in the Netherlands; and Technical University of Denmark. Funding came from myriad sources, including National Natural Science Foundation of China and Netherlands Earth System Science Centre.\nMEDIA & PR CONTACTS\n-\nBrian Maffly\nScience writer, University of Utah Communications\n801-573-2382",
