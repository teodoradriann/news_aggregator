    "text": "Corinthians é acusado de calote por não pagar Cuiabá: “Já previa”\nO Cuiabá cobra o Corinthians por uma das parcelas referente à compra do volante Raniele, cujo valor chega a cerca de R$ 2,4 milhões\natualizado\nCompartilhar notícia\nO Cuiabá acionou a Câmara Nacional de Resolução de Disputas (CNRD) da\nConfederação Brasileira de Futebol (CBF) para receber do Corinthians. O clube mato-grossense alega ter sofrido calote do time paulista.\nO Corinthians não pagou uma das parcelas pela contratação do\nvolante Raniele, que estava no Cuiabá até o fim de 2023. O Timão dividiu a compra em quatro prestações, mas não quitou uma delas no valor 400 mil euros (R$ 2,4 milhões).\nAs prestações pela compra de Raniele:\n- entrada de 800 mil euros (paga em janeiro);\n- 400 mil euros até 1º de agosto;\n- 400 mil euros até 30 de novembro;\n- 900 mil euros em julho de 2025.\n“A prestação de janeiro foi paga dias antes do início do Campeonato Paulista porque senão o Cuiabá não liberaria o registro no Boletim Informativo Diário (BID) da CBF. Infelizmente, a gente já previa que teria problemas com o Corinthians, até por isso colocamos uma cláusula com multa de 30% do valor total se houvesse atraso, além da antecipação de todas as parcelas a vencer”, destaca Cristiano Dresch,\n[presidente do Cuiabá].\nO mandatário do time mato-grossense lamenta a falta de fair play financeiro no futebol brasileiro e acrescenta que foi procurado pelo Corinthians apenas depois de tornar o calote público. O Timão, por sua vez, reconhece o atraso no pagamento e busca a quitação o quanto antes.",

    "text": "ROME, Dec. 28 (Xinhua) -- Italy has experienced a record-setting number of extreme weather events in 2023, a year that is set to be the warmest in more than 150 years, reports said on Thursday.\nAccording to the climate observatory run by the environmental lobby group Legambiente, Italy reported 378 severe weather events in 2023, an increase of 22 percent compared to last year -- ranging from heatwaves to drought and from hailstorms to floods and extreme winds, which were directly responsible for at least 31 deaths.\nOn the other hand, the agriculture sector union Coldiretti said there were more than nine harsh weather events per day this year across Italy's boot-shaped peninsula.\nIn its report, Coldiretti estimated that extreme weather caused a record 6 billion euros (6.6 billion U.S. dollars) of damages to crops and agricultural infrastructure, leading to shortfalls in the country's production of olive oil, peaches, nectarines and wheat.\nLegambiente said its calculations showed that the northern part of the country was hit the hardest, with 210 separate extreme weather events, followed by 98 in the central regions and 70 in the south which includes the island regions of Sicily and Sardinia.\nAmong the extreme weather events were floods, record high temperatures, rain-triggered landslides and hailstorms, it said.\nMuch of Europe suffered a long and dry summer and multiple severe weather events this year, but Italy is often hit harder due to its long coastline and exposure to the sea on two coasts. Meteorological data indicate that this year is set to be the warmest in more than 150 years of record-keeping in Italy.\nMeanwhile, weather agencies predict the year will end with an unusually warm spell, with high daytime temperatures across much of the Italian peninsula, assuring that 2024 will start out on the warm side. ■",

    "title": "Aussie O'Connor can win Tour of the Alps despite crash",
    "text": "Ben O&apos;Connor has delivered a remarkable comeback ride after a crash at the Tour of the Alps to keep himself in contention to win the prestigious week-long race. But his fellow Australian Chris Harper, who took a tumble at the same spot on a descent from the Passo del Vetriolo in northern Italy on Thursday&apos;s fourth stage was not so fortunate, with his injuries forcing the Team Jayco AlUla stalwart to abandon the race. O&apos;Connor, spearhead of French team Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale, was left bamboozled by the strange crash about 25km from the finish in Borgo Valsugana. He said the spill happened when he couldn&apos;t distinguish between a kerb and the road on a high-speed bend because \"they were the same colour\". Harper took the first fall, crashing on his right shoulder and ploughing head-first into a lamp post which forced him to pull out of the race. He was conscious when treated by team medics. O&apos;Connor, though, was able to remount and rejoined the leading pack while suffering a cut to his face and hand. He still had enough strength at the finish to launch an attack, coming third behind Britain&apos;s Simon Carr (EF Education-EasyPost) and his Australian compatriot Michael Storer (Tudor). \"The road looks the same, you couldn&apos;t see the kerb. It is the same colour and I just took it,\" O&apos;Connor said of his spill. \"It wasn&apos;t until I got to the barrier that I was like &apos;f***&apos; and jumped. \"I&apos;m fine, I just made an error in this fast descent. I really didn&apos;t see the end of the corner. \"It&apos;s a bit annoying but I was still third today and took some more seconds in the general classification. \"I can be pleased with how it went, the legs were really good all day, just in the end after the crash my body was a bit shaken, but I&apos;m OK.\" O&apos;Connor&apos;s display pushed him to second overall, just 38 seconds behind Lidl-Trek&apos;s Spanish star Juan Pedro Lopez, who hailed the fighting spirit of the Australian. The West Australian, a stage winner in the Tour de France and the Giro d&apos;Italia in recent years, has been in great form in 2024, having missed out on victory in the UAE Tour by just two seconds. It would, though, be a tall order for a beaten-up rider to prevail on Friday&apos;s final stage around Levico Terme, which features two category one ascents of the Palu del Fersina.",

    "text": "Fortune Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami drops XBTO in latest example of sports world fleeing crypto deals Read full article Niamh Rowe January 25, 2024 at 9:43 PM · 4 min read Megan Briggs—Getty Images\nInter Miami CF is searching for sponsorship money in calmer seas.\nThe team, including captain Lionel Messi, will be kicking off the 2024 season with their shirts sporting the logo of Royal Caribbean Cruises instead of the crypto investment firm XBTO, according to a statement . Financial details weren't disclosed.\nSince the FTX implosion in 2022 rocked the industry, sports sponsorships have been dwindling for crypto firms. XBTO had signed a multiyear partnership with the team in 2021 that's now ending just three years later. XBTO didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Fortune .\nMeanwhile, the cruise industry, with its admittedly less controversial branding, has been booming. Thanks to post-pandemic travel rebounds last year, cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean (112%), Carnival (130%), and Norwegian (64%) all saw major gains in their stock prices before retreating in early 2024.\nThe Miami-based soccer team's deal with Royal Caribbean highlights the sporting world's wider pivot away from crypto money and back toward safer, more traditional industries.\nHot off the press: @InterMiamiCF is suiting up with a new front-of-jersey partner, @RoyalCaribbean . The partnership was revealed in an exciting celebration today on #IconoftheSeas . | Release: https://t.co/mn4tGFzqdE 🚢⚽️ pic.twitter.com/BCDPFs1Frk\n— Royal Caribbean Public Relations (@RoyalCaribPR) January 24, 2024\nBoom and bust Like beer in the late 1990s, airlines in the early 2000s, and then telecom firms in the mid-2000s, crypto and sports, at least a few years ago, seemed like a perfect marriage.\nStory continues For crypto firms, sports deals promised large audiences, plus the brand association gave credibility to a new sector many consumers likely perceived as risky, said Francis Dumais, cofounder of the sponsorship marketing agency Elevent.\n\"It was a way to project a lower sense of risk,\" Dumais told Fortune . And in return, the industry could offer lucrative deals. \"It's not so much that crypto made sense, as much as it was the new gold rush that sport properties could not ignore.\"\nConrad Wiacek, head of sport analysis and consulting at GlobalData, added via email: \"Sports fans are typically male, and the appeal of crypto to this group meant that sports partnerships were a great way to generate interest.\"\nIn 2021, Crypto.com signed a 20-year, $700 million deal for the naming rights to the Los Angeles arena that's home to the Lakers, Kings, and Sparks, formerly known as the Staples Center. Meanwhile, Coinbase signed a wide-ranging four-year, $192 million deal with the NBA; and NFL quarterback Tom Brady agreed to be paid $55 million by FTX for just 20 hours of his time yearly.\nMiami became home to FTX Arena, home of the NBA's Heat. The facility was inaugurated in 1999 as American Airlines Arena, but in 2021, the county ended its deal with the airline, exchanging it for an agreement with FTX that paid significantly more than the $2.1 million annually the airline had agreed to pay. The arena was renamed as part of a 19-year, $135 million deal.\nBut following FTX’s collapse, a federal bankruptcy judge agreed to end the agreement between the exchange and Miami-Dade County, according to a court filing . The arena was last year renamed the Kaseya Center, after the IT and security software company Kaseya purchased the rights.\nThe FTX arena deal had been part of a local rebranding effort after, in January 2021, Miami mayor Francis Suarez took to Twitter to declare his city America’s crypto capital. “The City of Miami believes in #Bitcoin,” he tweeted , “and I'm working day and night to turn Miami into a hub for crypto innovation.”\nFurther disentanglements Last January, Scuderia Ferrari, the racing division of luxury carmaker Ferrari, departed its multiyear partnership deals with Velas Blockchain and chip manufacturing giant Snapdragon, resulting in a $55 million loss for the Italian team. The Ferrari-Velas partnership from 2021—set at $30 million a year—was aimed at increasing fan engagement through NFTs.\nIn November, Mercedes lost $15 million after suspending its partnership with FTX as the exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy . Formula One team Red Bull Racing also ended its partnership with the blockchain platform Tezos Foundation early and suffered similar losses, as Tezos reportedly decided not to renew its agreement, citing strategy misalignment.\nUnderpinning the shift away from crypto sponsorships, in addition to the bankruptcies and failed firms, is the industry's penchant for splashy headlines, among them FTX CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraud conviction and Binance CEO and cofounder Changpeng Zhao's plea deal . Moreover, lawsuits against exchanges Binance and Coinbase , accused of operating as unregistered brokerages, are currently being litigated.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nTRENDING 1.
