    "text": "No. 7 LSU holds off Ole Miss 84-73 in road SEC win\nOXFORD, Miss. — The LSU women’s basketball team won its 15th game in a row after a fourth quarter push gave the Tigers an 84-73 win over the Ole Miss Rebels and improved to 2-0 in conference play. Sunday afternoon’s attendance of 9,074 set an SBJ pavilion record.\nLSU had all five starters in double figures to total for 83 of the Tigers’ 84 points. The Tiger’s 8 three-pointers matched a season high, LSU had 8 against Jacksonville in December.\nWilliams was hot all afternoon with 20 points on 7-12 from the field and 4-5 from the three-point line. The freshman’s performance marked the 12th time this season she has reached double figures.\nThe duo down low of Angel Reese and Aneesah Morrow combined for 34 points and 17 rebounds. Reese finished with 21 points, 4 assists, and 9 boards while Morrow scored 13 and hauled in 8 rebounds.\nHailey Van Lith and Flau’Jae Johns rounded out the five to break double digits. Johnson dropped 16 as she also continued to improve on defense. Van Lith found success shooting the ball with 13 points on 5-11 from the field, the transfer also added 43 assists and a pair of triples.\nThe Rebels’ Marquesha Davis led all players with 24 points on 10-14 from the field and 7 rebounds. Madison Scott and Snudda Collins were the only other scorers to reach double figures scoring 13 and 12, respectively.\nLSU ended the afternoon 47-percent from the field compared to Ole Miss’ 40-percent. The Tigers won the rebound battle 44-36 despite being outscored 36-28 inside the paint. LSU went 8-13 for 62-percent from deep and Ole Miss went 3-11 for 27-percent. There were 4 lead changes and Ole Miss held the lead for just 2:38.\nThe Tigers will return home on Thursday to face the Aggies of Texas A&M at 7 p.m. inside the PMAC. LSU will then travel to Auburn on Sunday for a 2:00 p.m. tip on ESPN.\nWilliams capped off a 6-0 run with a triple to give LSU the early lead over the rebels. Ole Miss responded with a 6-0 run of its own before Morrow hit her first three-pointer to put LSU back up by three. LSU held a 14-12 lead at the first media timeout after going 3-4 from deep to start the game. Tyia Singleton gave the Rebels their first lead of the afternoon as her layup finished a 6-0 run and made it 18-16. With the game tied at 23, Van Lith hit her first three of the night as the buzzer sounded to regain the lead for LSU.\nA Davis three-point play tied things back up at 26 early in the second. LSU responded well as it went on an 11-4 run to gain its largest lead of the night, 37-30. Van Lith kept the Tigers momentum as she scored 4 unanswered to force an Ole Miss timeout with 2:39 left before the break. With just over a minute to go, Williams shook a defender to the floor as she stepped back beyond the arch and proceeded to hit LSU’s 7th three-pointer of the half. The Tigers looked comfortable in the second as LSU took a 13-point lead into halftime, 50-37.\nLSU’s 7 first half three-pointers was the most scored in one half by the Tigers this season. LSU only out-rebounded the rebels 18-15, but shot 57-percent from the field compared to Ole Miss’ 45-percent. After the first 20 minutes, Davis led all scorers with 14 points and Williams followed closely with 13.\nThe Tigers struggled to get back into rhythm early in the third as Ole Miss went on a 7-0 run to move the margin within six. Williams stopped the run with a pull-up from midrange but the Tiger offense didn’t last long before Ole Miss held them scoreless on a 10-0 run to take the lead, 53-52. LSU responded to the run quickly as it went on a 9-0 run to move the Tiger lead back to eight and force a Rebel timeout. Ole Miss continued to gain on LSU behind Davis who had reached 22 points by the end of the third quarter. Scott closed out the third with two made free throws to put the Rebels within striking distance, 67-62.\nLSU started the final quarter on a 12-2 run ahead of the media timeout and gave the Tigers a 15-point lead with 5:39 left in regulation. Ole Miss was only able to score from the foul line in the opening six minutes of the quarter. LSU’s lead would be enough to hold off the late effort and secure its first road conference win of the season.",

    "text": "The pound hit its highest level against the dollar in nearly five months amid gathering hopes that the UK will avoid a recession. Sterling climbed to $1.2827, its strongest since August 1, before giving up the gains later in the session. It comes as analysts see further gains for sterling against the dollar next year, with experts at US investment bank Goldman Sachs predicting it could hit $1.35. That would be a far cry from the aftermath of last year’s mini-Budget when sterling hit a record low of less than $1.04. The pound is being buoyed versus the greenback on bets that the US Federal Reserve looks closer to pulling the trigger on interest rate cuts next year. On the charge: The pound is being buoyed versus the greenback on bets that the US Federal Reserve will pull the trigger on interest rate cuts next year Markets are also looking ahead to next year’s Budget after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced it would take place on March 6. And a survey of 52 economists by Bloomberg suggested that the UK was heading for a so-called ‘soft landing’ in which inflation is brought down without causing a downturn. They predicted that after a bumpy start to next year, GDP would grow by 0.3 per cent as consumers enjoy lower inflation, bringing an end to the cost of living crisis. But the Bank of England predicts that growth will flatline in 2024. The report was not entirely positive, with a third forecasting that the economy will have shrunk in the fourth quarter of this year. That would imply a recession – defined as two quarters in a row of contraction – as GDP has already shrunk by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter. Dan Hanson, at Bloomberg Economics, said the economy will ‘tread a fine line between stagnation and contraction in the first half’ of 2024. *** [Read more at DailyMail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-12907557/Pound-five-month-high-against-dollar-amid-hopes-UK-avoid-recession-year.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)",

    "text": "Remembering Manmohan Singh : A Legacy of Reform and Compassion India mourns the passing of former Prime⁢ Minister manmohan Singh at the age of 92. His death,‌ announced Thursday, prompted seven days⁤ of national mourning. Singh’s life was a‍ testament to decades of service, marked by his instrumental role in India’s economic conversion and his unwavering commitment to social justice.\nSenior Congress leader P. Chidambaram, who served as Finance Minister under Singh, offered a poignant reflection: “The period from 1991 to 2014 will be a golden chapter in the history ⁣of India.” Chidambaram, visibly emotional, added, “It is a very emotional time for me⁢ to talk about ‌Manmohan Singh.”\nSingh’s career ​extended beyond his time as Prime Minister . He served as the Reserve Bank of India Governor⁤ and Chief Economic Advisor, showcasing a deep understanding of‌ India’s economic landscape. His tenure as Finance Minister under Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao (1991-1996) saw⁢ the launch‍ of landmark economic reforms that steered India away from the brink of bankruptcy and ushered in ⁢an era of liberalization.\nChidambaram highlighted Singh’s impact, stating, “Dr. Singh’s policies were dedicated to the poor. ‍The story of India changed after ‍Singh became ⁢the ​finance Minister. ⁤And today’s middle class is a result of his policies when​ he was Finance Minister and Prime Minister.”\nWhile lauded for his liberal and progressive economic policies, Singh’s legacy also includes a profound commitment to social welfare. Chidambaram emphasized this ⁣aspect, noting that Singh “never⁤ forgot the poor.” He cited the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ⁢(MNREGA) and the restructuring of the Public Distribution System (PDS) as key examples of Singh’s dedication to uplifting the moast vulnerable.\nChidambaram further elaborated, “During his tenure, he showed great compassion for‍ the poor. He did not hide the fact that there⁢ are several crore poor people in⁢ India and reminded us⁣ that government policies should be ⁣for the poor.Examples of his sympathies ‍are​ MNREGA, restructuring of PDS ⁢and expansion of mid-day meal scheme.” He concluded by saying, “Their story has ‌not been fully told. His achievements are ​not ‌fully recorded. I am sure that when we look ⁤back on Dr.⁢ Singh’s 23 years ⁢of active politics,we ⁢will realize what⁤ he ​really did.”\nManmohan Singh’s passing marks⁢ the end ‌of an era. His contributions to India’s⁣ economic and social progress will continue to be studied and debated for years to ‍come, leaving an enduring legacy for future generations.\nFormer Indian Finance ‍Minister Sounds Alarm on Economic Policies Veteran Indian politician and former Finance Minister ⁣P. Chidambaram recently issued a stark warning regarding the nation’s economic trajectory, criticizing current policies and raising concerns about potential long-term consequences. His comments, delivered ​during a high-profile address, have ignited a heated debate among economists and political analysts alike.\nChidambaram’s critique ​focused on several key areas, highlighting what he perceives as a failure to adequately address rising inflation and sluggish economic growth. He argued that ‍the government’s approach lacks the necessary foresight and decisive action to ‌prevent ⁣a potential economic ⁤downturn.The ⁢former minister’s concerns resonate with anxieties felt globally, particularly in the wake of recent international economic instability.\n“The government needs to take immediate and decisive action to address the current economic challenges,” Chidambaram stated emphatically. He⁤ further emphasized the urgency of the situation, warning that inaction could lead​ to a more severe crisis. While he ‌didn’t offer specific policy prescriptions in his public address, his comments clearly ​signal a deep concern about ‌the current path.\nP.

The coming months will be crucial in determining whether the government will⁣ heed Chidambaram’s warnings and ‌implement necessary changes.\nThe situation underscores​ the complexities of managing a large and rapidly developing economy. Balancing growth with stability is a constant challenge, and Chidambaram’s critique ⁣serves as a reminder of the potential pitfalls and the ‍importance of proactive economic management. The international community will⁤ be watching closely to see how India navigates these challenges.\nPublished: december 27,2024\nremembering Manmohan Singh:⁣ A Legacy of Reform and Compassion\nIndia mourns the recent passing of former Prime‌ minister Manmohan Singh, leading many ‍to reflect on his lasting ⁣legacy of economic reform and dedication to social justice. singh’s tenure as Prime Minister, ‌Finance minister, and economist left a deep impact on the nation’s⁢ advancement.To further understand⁢ Singh’s contributions, we spoke ‍with Dr. amita Gupta, Professor of‌ Economics at ‍the ⁢University​ of Delhi‌ and an expert on Indian economic policy.\nThe Early Years: Academic scholarship and ⁣Economic Vision\nSenior Editor: Dr.Gupta,manmohan Singh’s background is rich with academic achievement‌ and economic expertise.

The S&P 500 averages about a 10% gain every year.\nWhile investing was once reserved for adults, it’s now accessible to kids under their parent’s supervision.\nElsa doesn’t complain about doing chores as she knows each completed task will earn her a little money from her parents.\nBut instead of running out the door to spend her cash, Elsa has bigger goals in mind.\n“Make sure you save your money instead of just spending it all the time,” she explained to FOX 13 News.\nThe fourth grader saves her money in an app called “Busy Kid.” She did so well with her savings this year that the developers honored her with their “Best of the Best” award for 2023.\n“In a world where finances are in a mess this is exactly what we are trying to do,” explained Gregg Murset, CEO of Busy Kid. “Change the next generation in how they think about this stuff.”\nMurset said the app allows kids to invest their money and use their very own debit card to make purchases with parental approval.\nHe believes that children as young as 5 years old, kindergartners, can learn smart financial habits.\n“If they can learn it early in life, it changes how they think about money, how they deal with their own money and it sets them up for success in the future,” Murset said.\nElsa’s parents have the same mindset, encouraging their daughter to categorize her money into savings, spending and charitable contributions.\n“I hope these principles set in and they stick she can take these her whole life,” reflected Matt Dees, Elsa’s father. “It gives her this great foundation of financial achievements we want to instill in our kids.\nElsa is saving up with her sights set on a trip to Harry Potter’s Wizarding World in Florida.\n“I have been trying to save everything,” she explained. “It’s easy to save money because then you’ll have more money that you can get other things that you want instead of just spending it really fast.”\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.
