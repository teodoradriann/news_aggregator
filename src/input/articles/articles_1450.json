    "text": "As heat waves intensify, more public housing residents may get help with AC bills The summer has already been a scorcher and heat alerts across the country could lead to more records broken. Public housing residents, many elderly, children or sick, are [disproportionately vulnerable](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/01/1190885287/extreme-heat-public-housing-air-conditioning-hud) to heat illness, yet there’s no federal mandate to provide them air conditioning. In fact, until last month the Department of Housing and Urban Development allowed local housing agencies to subsidize tenants’ heating bills, but — with some exceptions — explicitly said they could not pay for cooling bills. New [guidance](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_24_145) changes that, though critics say it still [falls short](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/27/nx-s1-5021537/public-housing-buildings-can-now-pay-for-residents-acs-providing-relief-to-many). “We must protect the health and safety of our families during increasingly severe weather events, like extreme heat, that can cause grave harm and even death to any member of our community,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman in a [statement](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_24_145) announcing the change last month. Several public housing residents were among the hundreds who died when a [heat wave struck](https://www.npr.org/2022/07/27/1114075017/heat-wave-lessons-learned-in-pacific-northwest) the Pacific Northwest in 2021. Last year, Portland public housing resident Beth Vansmith [told NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/01/1190885287/extreme-heat-public-housing-air-conditioning-hud) she remembers how awful she felt at that time, with no air conditioner and temperatures soaring up to 116. \"I would get dizzy. I would get nauseous. You know, I'd lose my appetite completely, and it was just so miserably hot,\" she said. Much public housing was built before central air was common, and at a time when it was not necessary in many parts of the country. Yet even as [climate-fueled heat waves](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/10/nx-s1-4842299/climate-disasters-death-tolls) grow more intense and frequent, public housing residents who want an AC unit must buy it themselves. And some who do often hesitate to use it because of the added cost to their electric bill. Now, local housing agencies will be allowed to subsidize cooling costs during a severe heat period. HUD has spelled out its own definition of that: two to three days of intense heat and humidity, with temperatures reaching at least 90 degrees. But local agencies can decide on their own definition of what will trigger cooling subsidies. “We are providing maximum local control and decision-making for an issue that impacts more and more communities across the country each year,” said Richard Monocchio, with HUD’s Office of Public and Indian Housing. Still, the change comes with other caveats that critics say could limit its impact. Paying for cooling costs is not required, and tenants must ask for the help “This is a very small step,” says Daniel Carpenter-Gold, a staff attorney with the Public Health Law Center in St. Paul, Minn. “It doesn't do anything if the resident doesn't have air conditioning or some other form of cooling.” For those who do have their own AC, Carpenter-Gold says there’s still no mandate to subsidize cooling costs. Local agencies will simply have the option to do that. And — crucially — the burden is on a tenant to ask for the help. Carpenter-Gold says a public housing agency is functionally a landlord, inherently a tricky relationship, and that could make this a hard ask for some people. What’s more, he says it’s not clear how the message of this new option will be put out to people. “They might not get the notice in the first place that this is a thing,” he says. “And the residents might not apply in time for them to actually feel like they can turn on their AC … when the heat strikes.” Even agencies eager to help will need to come up with a whole new system to approve and organize payments, he says, but many of them are cash-strapped and understaffed. In 2022, the Public Health Law Center and other groups [petitioned](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/sites/default/files/resources/public-housing-petition.pdf) HUD to subsidize cooling costs for all tenants, just as it does for heating. Carpenter-Gold says HUD could make that change on its own, but it would be a long, bureaucratic process to get done. In the meantime, a growing number of local housing agencies have scrambled to find [funding](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/infrastructure/2023/08/08/459053/public-housing-will-receive-air-conditioning-from-houston-housing-authoritys-heat-relief-initiative/) on their own to [provide](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/climate-change/article280348599.html) air-conditioning for tenants. And some are tapping into funding for clean energy retrofits that President [Biden pushed Congress](https://www.npr.org/2022/07/29/1114216967/climate-experts-experience-an-odd-sensation-after-the-manchin-budget-deal-optimi) to pass. HUD is encouraging agencies to switch to solar or heat pumps, which can reduce not only carbon emissions but also tenants’ bills. And its new heat guide also touts painting roofs and sidewalks white and constructing shady areas around buildings. Those things can help bring down overall temperatures, even if residents don’t have AC in their apartments. Copyright 2024 NPR",

    "text": "Consensys Files Lawsuit Against the SEC Over Ethereum Regulation Ethereum developer firm Consensys, managed by Joe Lubin, filed a lawsuit on April 25 against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over its “overzealous regulation” around the Ethereum blockchain. [In an announcement](https://twitter.com/ethereumJoseph/status/1783562422571192695) on social media platform X, Lubin said Consensys has taken an important step towards “preserving access to ether and, by extension, the Ethereum blockchain in the U.S. We are suing the SEC and fighting back against its overzealous regulatory overreach.” Today, Consensys took an important step towards preserving access to ether and by extension the Ethereum blockchain in the U.S. We are suing the SEC and fighting back against its overzealous regulatory overreach. You can find more of my thoughts here: [https://t.co/VmvOsrCxjw]… [https://t.co/5IubZo69FW] — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) [April 25, 2024] SEC’s Reckless Approach Brings Chaos [In a blog post](https://t.co/VmvOsrCxjw), the firm said the SEC’s reckless approach is causing chaos to developers, market participants, institutions, and nations that are building or already managing critical systems running on Ethereum, the world’s largest platform for decentralized applications. The firm went on to add that the SEC only has jurisdiction over securities and, until recently, has declared that ether is not and should not be treated as a security. Consensys stressed that the SEC should not be allowed to arbitrarily expand its jurisdiction to include regulating the future of the Internet. Ether is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. It can be traded as a commodity (like oil), but it is also essential to the technological development of applications built on Ethereum – including applications that have clear, non-financial utility for vital sectors like healthcare, energy, transport, media, agriculture, and beyond.”, the post read. “The SEC’s approach would make it impossible for developers to innovate and build, because it would classify non-financial platforms as financial applications thus requiring the SEC’s oversight and approval.” Coinbase Lawsuit Against SEC This latest lawsuit by Consensys mirrors a recent Coinbase filing. In March, [it emerged that Coinbase had filed a lawsuit](https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-sues-sec-for-crypto-rulemaking-refusal.htm) against the SEC, seeking a court directive for the regulatory authority to establish clear guidelines for the cryptocurrency sector. In the lawsuit detailed in their March 11 [court submission](https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/4k2YQLr5PQcDksJwda4yid/7e458652c5c696e886d16faa9a65a154/Coinbase_v._SEC_Brief_for_Petitioner.pdf), Coinbase challenged the SEC’s lack of formal rulemaking for the crypto sector, asserting that the agency’s actions hindered the industry’s development and clarity. SEC’s Absence of Digital Asset Rulemaking The filing criticized the SEC for its passive stance on crypto regulation, [arguing that the absence of specific rules](https://cryptonews.com/news/two-commissioners-criticize-sec-following-shapeshift-settlement.htm) has left the sector navigating a regulatory grey area. Most recently, SEC Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda have publicly criticized the agency’s unclear cryptocurrency enforcement policies following a recent settlement with ShapeShift.

    "text": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 22 (APP): As temperatures rise during the spring season in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, the concentration of pollen has begun to rapidly escalate, posing challenges for residents with allergies.\nMeteorological experts warn that pollen levels are expected to continue rising in the coming days, with the peak concentration anticipated during the last week of March 2024, reported a private news channel.\nDuring the existing weather conditions over the next two weeks, the intensity of pollen concentration is projected to spike significantly. Individuals suffering from pollen allergies are strongly advised to take precautionary measures to mitigate symptoms and minimize exposure.\nResidents in Islamabad are expressing growing concerns as the pollen season sets in, reporting allergic reactions such as coughing, flu, irritated throats, and mild headaches.\nThe most prevalent pollen types in Islamabad include Paper Mulberry, Acacia, Eucalyptus, Pines, Grasses, Cannabis, Dandelion, and Alternaria. Among these species, Paper Mulberry accounts for approximately 97% of the total pollen count. During the peak of the blossom season, its concentration can reach extreme levels of around 45,000 particles per cubic meter of air.\nResidents are urged to stay informed about pollen forecasts and take necessary precautions to protect their health during this period of heightened pollen activity.",

    "text": "Después de varios días con cielos parcialmente nublados, temperaturas moderadas y desastres por la lluvia, la “perla tapatía” se prepara para una jornada marcada por intensas precipitaciones. El Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) ha advertido que este jueves 17 de julio continuará la caída de agua en el occidente del país, siendo Jalisco uno de los estados más afectados.\nEste fenómeno provocará lluvias significativas durante la tarde y noche, acompañadas de actividad eléctrica, vientos moderados y posible caída de granizo, principalmente en el sur y suroeste del estado, incluyendo el área metropolitana de Guadalajara, por lo que hay que mantenerse informado de cualquier alerta.\n¿Cómo estará el clima en Guadalajara hoy?\nEl día comienza con temperaturas frescas y cielo parcialmente nublado. A partir del mediodía se prevé un incremento en la nubosidad y en la probabilidad de lluvia. Según el pronóstico por hora, los primeros chubascos podrían presentarse entre las 13:00 y 15:00 horas, aunque será entre las 16:00 y las 19:00 cuando se espera la mayor intensidad de tormentas, con probabilidades de precipitación de hasta el 90% y acumulados cercanos a los 3 mm por hora.\nLa temperatura máxima alcanzará los 24 °C cerca del mediodía, mientras que durante la noche se mantendrá entre los 17 y 18 °C. La sensación térmica será agradable en general, aunque podría descender momentáneamente durante las lluvias intensas o lloviznas cual sea el caso.\nTras las fuertes lluvias que azotaron y causaron destrozos en zonas del Área Metropolitana de Guadalajara, tal y como lo son colonias como Tabachines y La Martinica, ahpra el SMN indica que las lluvias podrían superar los 75 mm en algunas zonas del sur de Jalisco, lo que representa un riesgo potencial de encharcamientos e incluso inundaciones en zonas vulnerables.\n¿Qué hacer en caso de lluvias fuertes?\nLa combinación de humedad tropical, inestabilidad atmosférica y circulación ciclónica seguirá generando condiciones lluviosas en los próximos días, por lo que se sugiere precaución continua. Las autoridades exhortan a la población a extremar medidas de prevención, ya que las lluvias pueden generar desbordamientos de ríos menores, deslaves en zonas de ladera y tránsito complicado durante las horas pico.\n- Llevar paraguas o impermeable si vas a salir después del mediodía.\n- Evitar circular en moto o bicicleta entre las 16:00 y 19:00 horas, cuando se espera mayor intensidad de lluvia.\n- No te resguardes bajo árboles durante una tormenta eléctrica.\n- Mantente atento a canales oficiales como el SMN o Protección Civil Jalisco para avisos actualizados.\n- Revisar coladeras cercanas a tu domicilio y repórtalas si están obstruidas, para prevenir encharcamientos.\n- Si vives en zona de riesgo, ten lista una mochila de emergencia y define rutas seguras de evacuación.",

    "title": "Tony Khan uses WWE numbers to explain why AEW deserves ‘a big pay raise’ on next TV deal - Cageside Seats",
    "text": "AEW is negotiating terms for a new TV deal right now with its broadcast partner Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), at the same time that WWE is rumored to be seeking $400 million per year on its next TV deal for Raw. There’s actually a scenario where WWE Raw ends up on WBD, which [could spell disaster](https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2023/12/14/24001238/report-wwe-raw-tv-deal-negotiations-wbd-warner-bros-cm-punk-return-zaslav-aew-forced-out-tony-khan) for All Elite Wrestling. On a call with the media today ahead of the Worlds End pay-per-view on Saturday night, AEW President Tony Khan was confident about continuing his current business relationship with WBD in 2024 and beyond, but also asserted there are “a lot of suitors” interested in AEW programming. When Khan was specifically asked by [Wrestlenomics’ Brandon Thurston](https://twitter.com/BrandonThurston) to explain AEW’s drop in TV ratings year-over-year, he focused on ratings for WWE Raw and AEW Dynamite being down a similar amount in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022: “You say Raw is down 8% and Dynamite’s down 10%...that’s very similar, and both of those are ahead of the decline in cable television. Cable television is down a lot more than 10% year-over-year. And both of us, Raw is down 8% and Dynamite down 10%, are beating the hell out of gravity. And both of us are looking at a big pay raise this year, for Dynamite and Raw. And Raw having made 265 million dollars a year last year, for them to get a pay raise, that’s gonna be a really big number for them. And for us, it’s a lot of money too.” ...Both shows are probably due for a big rights fee increase, and frankly percentage-wise, especially Dynamite because of where we started and how we performed...I think that both shows have done really well to, frankly defy gravity, and stay ahead of the drop, which as I understand is closer to 20%.” That’s a pretty sly move by Tony, anwering a question about AEW’s ratings drop to explain why AEW deserves a significant pay increase on its next TV deal. And he did so by putting AEW Dynamite in the same boat as WWE Raw, which most people understand will see a big money increase on its next TV deal. Does Tony Khan’s argument make sense to you, or is there a lot more to the story than just looking at Q4 numbers year-over-year? Let us know what you think in the comments below, Cagesiders.",
