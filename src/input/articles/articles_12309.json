    "title": "US revitalised partnership with allies and nations like India amidst China’s rise: President Biden-Telangana Today",
    "text": "Washington: The US has revitalised its partnership with its allies and countries like India, Australia and Japan, amidst the rise of China , President Joe Biden has said, as he accused Beijing of indulging in unfair economic practices and endangering peace across the Taiwan Strait.\nBiden, 81, in his final State of the Union Address before a joint session of the US Congress on Thursday, said the US wants competition with China, but not conflict.\nAlso Read Editorial: Fear in foreign land Biden, seeking re-election in November, said America is in a stronger position to win the competition for the 21st Century against China.\n“We are standing up against China’s unfair economic practice, standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. We revitalised our partnership with allies and the Pacific, India. Australia, Japan, South and South Korea,” Biden, a Democrat, said.\nChina considers Taiwan as its breakaway province and insists it should be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary. Taiwan, however, sees itself as completely distinct from China.\nChina has been ramping up its military offensive against the self-ruled island of more than 23 million people, triggering global concerns including from the US.\nHe said he several times found his Republican fellow members saying that China is on the rise and America is falling behind.\n“They’ve got it backwards. America is rising,” Biden said.\nBiden’s China comments came a day after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi escalated Beijing’s verbal attacks on the United States.\nOn the sidelines of an annual meeting of China’s Parliament, Wang accused the United States of trying to contain China through sanctions and insisted that Washington has “wrong perceptions” about Beijing.\n“The means to suppress China are constantly updated, the list of unilateral sanctions is constantly extended, and the desire to inflict punishment on China has reached an unimaginable level,” said Wang during an interaction with local and foreign media in Beijing.\nThe US has imposed sanctions against China on a range of issues, from human rights abuses to its growing military relations with Russia.\nChina is expected to get more public attention as the US presidential election campaign intensifies in the coming weeks.\nIn his address, Biden claimed that the US has the best economy in the world.\n“Since I’ve come to office, our GDP is up. And our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade,” he said “I’ve made sure that the most advanced American technologies can’t be used in China’s weapons. Frankly, for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do that,” Biden said.\n“And we’re in a stronger position to win the competition for the 21st Century against China or anyone else for that matter,” said the president.\nFollowing Super Tuesday contests, decks have become clear for a rematch between Biden and Trump in the November 5 presidential elections.\nBiden, who is the oldest president of the US, also slammed his Republican rival and predecessor Donald Trump, 77, on several issues ranging from his recent comment on Russian President Vladimir Putin, immigration, the January 6 insurrection, abortion, and gun control.",

    "text": "The newest major in UC Merced's School of Engineering is one of the most exciting subjects in - and out of - this world. [Aerospace engineering](https://ae.ucmerced.edu/), one of the fastest-growing industries in the state, will be available as a major area of study at the university in fall 2025. The adoption of an aerospace engineering major at UC Merced is exciting for all the romantic reasons you might expect - visions of alumni working on satellites and spacecraft and taking part in missions to explore the vast frontier. \"As the quest for expanding our footprint to other habitable worlds in the solar system continues, aerospace engineering knowledge will be the important link that contributes to faster, cleaner, efficient vehicles to achieve our goals,\" according to the proposal for the major. \"The same aerospace engineer will also be able to improve our air transportation between different parts of the world. Reduced emissions, noise, and fuel consumption are some of the important near-future objectives that will revolutionize air transport and a degree in aerospace engineering is crucial to achieving all of these.\" It also makes great sense from a financial perspective. The global space economy is growing at a furious pace. It hit $469 billion in 2021, according to the nonprofit [ Space Foundation](https://cie.spacefoundation.org/space-industry-growth-where-are-the-opportunities-in-2022/). In the first six months of 2022 alone, a record-setting 1,022 spacecraft were placed in orbit - more than in the first 52 years of the Space Age, the foundation said. Investment bank Morgan Stanley estimates the economic potential of space commerce business at $1 trillion by 2040. This rapid expansion of the space industry has been driven by increased private sector investment, rising demand for space data and, especially, advances in technology such as reusable launch vehicles and miniature satellites. \"Technology for space missions is evolving rapidly and we will prepare the next generation of engineers to be part of this evolution,\" said Professor Ashlie Martini, chair of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, which developed the aerospace engineering major. \"The incredible growth of the global space economy is a testament to the talented professionals who innovate new ideas for space every day to help humanity and the ever-growing reliance on those benefits from space for all the people of Earth,\" Space Foundation CEO Tom Zelibor said in a news release. \"The booming space industry will need to expand its workforce to sustain this kind of growth. That means delivering the message to everyone, from kindergarten on up, that they have a place in space at one of the most exciting times since we first reached for the stars.\" California is among the leaders in the sector, with the number of jobs projected to grow 8.5 percent in the next decade. There is quite a bit of enthusiasm on campus for the new major. \"We are incredibly excited about the new aerospace engineering major. We already have an optional emphasis in aerospace engineering as part of the mechanical engineering major and many UC Merced alumni are working in the space and aerospace industries,\" Martini said. \"The new dedicated major will be of interest to students who want to focus on these industries in their careers.\" The aerospace engineering major will prepare engineers to design, construct and test aircraft, missiles and spacecraft. Already, UC Merced students and alumni have successfully obtained full-time employment and internship experiences with aerospace employers including Collins Aerospace, Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Boeing, SpaceX, Blue Origin, Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), NASA and Raytheon, said Manny Machado, career specialist for the School of Engineering. The major includes a variety of skills outside of engineering, including physical sciences, mathematics, computing, technology, critical reasoning, technological expertise and communication skills. And the opportunities are nearly as endless as space itself. The United States [ Chamber of Commerce](https://www.uschamber.com/space/space-economy-4-trends-to-watch-in-2022) points out that \"private sector business leaders and government agencies have transformed what was once merely a dream of travel among the stars into a fully functioning global market there's already a fully functioning global market - forming private aerospace companies, launching rockets and satellites, and even creating opportunities for space travel.\" Duval Johnson, UC Merced alumnus and mechanical engineering department external advisory board member, works at JPL and has firsthand experience with the rapid growth of the aerospace industry. \"It is a thrilling time to be an engineer working in aerospace and I am pleased that more UC Merced students will be able to shape the future of the field,\" Johnson said.",

    "title": "2024 Budget: Abass, 10th House Have Delivered on Promise, Says Agbese - THISDAYLIVE",
    "text": "The deputy spokesperson, House of Representatives, Hon. Philip Agbese, has congratulated the Speaker, Tajudeen Abbas; Deputy Speaker, Benjamin Kalu; Chairman of Appropriation Committee, Hon. Abubakar Bichi and the entire members of the 10th House for delivering on the promise on the 2024 budget. The legislators had, during a special plenary on Saturday, passed a record N28.7 trillion as the budget for 2024, with the appropriation increasing by N1.27 trillion — from the N27.5 trillion proposed by President Bola Tinubu. Out of the N28.7 trillion, the sum of N1,742,786,788,150 was allocated for statutory transfers; recurrent expenditure amounts to N8,768,513,380,852; capital expenditure stands at N9,995,143,298,028 and debt service was set at N8,270,960,606,831. The Chairman of the House Committee on Appropriation, Bichi, had, while presenting the report at Saturday’s plenary, explained the rationale behind increasing the estimates of the appropriation bill, saying revenue-generating agencies and government-owned enterprises (GOEs) had a meeting with the committee and have pledged a substantial revenue increase in 2024 to support the budget. While reacting Saturday night, Agbese lauded the painstaking efforts of his colleagues, especially the leadership of the House and the Appropriation Committee, in ensuring the 2024 Appropriation Bill was passed as promised. As a result of this sacrifice, Agbese said: “Nigerians will not take this for granted. The 10th House is known for creating discomfort for its members in order to make Nigerians comfortable. This is the people’s House and I’m glad the people are better off with the kind of leadership being provided here.” The deputy spokesperson recalled how the House adjourned its plenary for three weeks to enable its various committees interface with relevant agencies and scrutinized the 2024 budget estimates. He said: “At a point, we were almost going to spend our Christmas celebrations in the office. We had to suspend the House rules and were coming to the National Assembly on non-working days (weekends) and many times staying back at non-office hours. “Today that is Saturday and at a time when everyone is out of his station preparing for new year celebration with his family, we came all out for the budget to be passed. I thank God we fulfilled our promise. The 10th House under His Excellency, Hon. Tajudeen Abbas, must be commended for this. “I’m sure too that the executive would be glad that the legislative arm lived up to its mandate and expectations. We are in alignment with the manifestos contained in the ‘Renewed Hope Agenda’ of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and with the resolve of all of us to sustain Nigeria on the pedestal of January-December budget circle.” Agbese, who represents Ado/Okpokwu/Ogbadibo Federal Constituency of Benue State, also hailed the decision of the Bichi-led Appropriation Committee for allocating the differential N1.27 trillion to the capital component rather than recurrent expenditure. “This is a good decision. This is the first time the capital component of the nation’s budget is bigger than recurrent,” he added. President Tinubu had presented a budget of N27.5 trillion to a joint section of the National Assembly on November 29 in Abuja. Abbas had, during the budget presentation, said President Tinubu’s government could not afford to fail Nigerians by changing the rots and charting a new course for the masses. According to the Speaker, it is well-known that millions of citizens are living through difficult times. “For this reason, they also look to the Tinubu-led government to provide quick and sustainable solutions. The antecedents of the president and your track record in governance inspire a lot of hope in Nigerians, and it is for this reason that we cannot afford to fail Nigerians,” Abbas stated. Also during a resumed plenary session Tuesday, 19th December, 2023, following the resumption of the green chamber after a brief recess to allow committees to scrutinise the budget estimates submitted by the president, Abbas had assured Nigerians that the 2024 budget would be passed on Saturday, December 30, 2023.",

    "text": "Il weekend ha avuto inizio, con un venerdì piovoso soprattutto nella parte orientale della Sicilia : ma che tempo farà per il resto del fine settimana? I prossimi giorni saranno caratterizzati da tempo variabile , con alternanza di fasi più instabili con rovesci associati a pause asciutte.\nUna saccatura atlantica, attualmente presente sulla parte settentrionale della penisola iberica, sarà agganciata dal flusso zonale e si sposterà sull’Italia tra sabato e domenica. La Sicilia si troverà un po’ ai margini ma saranno comunque possibili rovesci tra la serata di venerdì e la prima parte della giornata di sabato e poi durante la giornata di domenica, quando la saccatura affonderà maggiormente verso sud. Dal punto di vista termico nella prima fase si avranno temperature oltre le medie del periodo, a causa del richiamo mite imposto dalla saccatura ad ovest poi, a partire dalla serata di sabato, è atteso un sensibile calo termico con valori che si porteranno qualche grado sotto media.\nSabato 14 dicembre Nella notte e al mattino cielo nuvoloso su gran parte dell’isola, specie sui settori centro settentrionali e occidentali, dove saranno possibili rovesci di debole o moderata intensità.

    "text": "Independiente de Avellaneda tomó una decisión drástica con el delantero juvenil Santiago López y le comunicó que no será parte de la pretemporada en Miami, Estados Unidos, por no renovar su vínculo con el club. La decisión fue tomada por la Comisión Directiva del club, y es exclusivamente porque el joven que supo brillar en el Mundial Sub-17 con la Selección Argentina aún no extendió su vínculo con la entidad de Avellaneda que finaliza en diciembre de 2024. Si bien las partes venían hablando desde hace varios días para evitar este conflicto, no hubo acuerdo, ya que la idea de la directiva era que López firme un nuevo contrato con el club por tres temporadas más, hasta diciembre de 2027, con una suba de su cláusula de recisión que por ahora es de 15 millones de dólares. Pero el problema radica en que a mediados de 2024, con solo seis meses de contrato por delante, podrá negociar con cualquier club que lo quiera, y en las últimas horas se filtro que su entorno manejaría una oferta desde el exterior de 1.5 millones de dólares. Lo cierto es que, mientras no haya acuerdo entre la representación del jugador e Independiente, López no entrenará más con el primer equipo, más allá de que el entrenador, Carlos Tevez, manifestó en más de una ocasión que lo tendría en cuenta.",

El 14 de mayo, los vientos se debilitan.\nDe acuerdo con el Inmet, esta condición ocurre debido a la inestabilidad que regresa con más fuerza a Rio Grande do Sul, al final de esta semana. Inicialmente, como frente caliente, una vez que el frío retrocede de Santa Catarina para el estado gaucho.\nEl fin de semana esta onda glacial permanecerá en Rio Grande do Sul, causando áreas de inestabilidad y un gradual ingreso de aire gélido.\nA partir del lunes, cuando el frío gana fuerza y podría provocar heladas a partir del martes, el amplio refuerzo de aire seco, de origen polar, deberá alejar la inestabilidad.\nMeteorólogos apuntan que los volúmenes de lluvia previstos pueden causar nuevos trastornos en zonas afectadas anteriormente.\nPor este motivo, el Inmet alerta y recomienda seguir las directrices de la Defensa Civil.\nDe acuerdo con el más reciente boletín de ese órgano de socorro, se mantiene en 107 el número de muertos, en razón de los temporales, y hay un óbito bajo investigación.\nEl estado registra hasta el momento 134 desaparecidos y 754 heridos.\nTambién se notifican 327 mil 105 mil personas fuera de casa.

    "text": "Maduro ordena una \"acción conjunta defensiva\" en respuesta al envío de un barco de guerra británico a Guyana El presidente venezolano dijo que el envío de un barco militar británico a Guyana es una \"ruptura de los acuerdos\" alcanzados con su homólogo guyanés. El presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, dijo este jueves que ordenó \"la activación de una acción conjunta defensiva de la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana\" frente a las costas del Esequibo, región que su país se disputa con la vecina Guyana. La noticia se conoce pocos días después de que el gobierno británico anunciara que enviará un barco de guerra a Guyana en un gesto de apoyo diplomático y militar a su antigua colonia. En una reunión con el alto mando militar transmitida por la televisión estatal, Maduro aseguró que el envío del patrullero británico HMS Trent supone una “ruptura” del espíritu del acuerdo que alcanzó con el presidente guyanés, Irfan Ali, para no usar la fuerza en la resolución de las diferencias entre ambos países en la reunión que ambos líderes mantuvieron en San Vicente y las Granadinas el pasado 14 de diciembre. Maduro dijo que el despliegue del buque británico \"es prácticamente una amenaza militar de Londres contra nuestro país\". Añadió que ambas partes acordaron evitar la presencia de “fuerzas militares extra regionales en el Caribe” y concluyó que “esto es una ruptura de los acuerdos”. El presidente venezolano no dio detalles de en qué consistirá la acción militar que ha ordenado, pero algunos de los mandos militares que participaron en la reunión televisada indicaron que había 5.600 efectivos listos para el operativo. El Esequibo y la disputa entre Venezuela y Guyana La acción militar anunciada por Maduro supone el último episodio del litigio entre Venezuela y Guyana por la región del Esequibo, un territorio de unos 160.000 kilómetros cuadrados, la mayoría de selva impenetrable que Caracas reclama como suyos desde que en 1899 un laudo internacional dictaminara que pertenecía a Reino Unido, entonces la potencia colonial que poseía lo que luego fue la Guyana independiente. El contencioso se ha venido arrastrando con diferente intensidad desde entonces y se ha agravado en los últimos años, después de que se descubrieran en la zona importantes yacimientos de crudo y gas, y el gobierno guyanés concediera licencias para su explotación a la energética estadounidense ExxonMobil. El asunto está en manos de la Corte Internacional de Justicia, cuya autoridad sobre el caso Venezuela no reconoce. El pasado 4 de diciembre el gobierno venezolano celebró un [referéndum en que la mayoría de votantes se mostraron a favor de incorporar el Esequibo como un nuevo estado de la República Bolivariana](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/articles/cpwp6zz89l6o?xtor=AL-73-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Belimparcial.com%5D-%5Blink%5D-%5Bmundo%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D). En un intento por rebajar la tensión, Maduro se vio el 14 de diciembre con su homólogo guyanés en un encuentro facilitado por la diplomacia brasileña y ambos acordaron rebajar la tensión y descartaron el uso de la fuerza. Pero la entrada en escena del gobierno británico y el envío de un buque militar a la zona ha provocado la reacción de Venezuela Casi en simultáneo con la aparición televisiva de Maduro, la Cancillería venezolana afirmó en un comunicado que Caracas se “reserva todas las acciones, en el marco de la Constitución y el derecho internacional, para defender su integridad marítima y territorial”. El buque británico El Ministerio de Defensa británico confirmó el pasado fin de semana que el buque HMS Trent participará en ejercicios conjuntos con Guyana después de la Navidad. Guyana, un miembro de la Mancomunidad Británica, es el único país de habla inglesa en Sudamérica. El HMS Trent cuenta con 65 tripulantes, una velocidad máxima de 24 nudos y un alcance de 5.000 millas náuticas. El barco está armado con cañones de 30 mm y un contingente de cadetes de la Marina Real. También puede desplegar helicópteros tipo Merlin y aeronaves no tripuladas. El HMS Trent zarpó de su puerto base en Gibraltar a comienzos de diciembre y actualmente se encuentra atracado en Bridgetown, la capital de Barbados, durante la Navidad. Se anticipa que el barco de guerra eche ancla frente a la capital de Guyana, Georgetown, y realice visitas, actividades conjuntas y entrenamiento con la marina de ese país y otros aliados. No puede atracar en el puerto por que este no es suficientemente profundo. El ministro de Defensa de Venezuela, Vladimir Padrino, se pronunció el domingo sobre el anuncio a través de la red social X (antes Twitter): “¿Un buque de guerra en aguas por delimitar? ¿Y entonces? ¿Y el compromiso con la buena vecindad y la convivencia pacífica? ¿Y el acuerdo de no amenazarse y utilizar la fuerza mutuamente en ninguna circunstancia? ¡Seguimos alertas ante estas provocaciones que ponen en riesgo la paz y la estabilidad del Caribe y nuestra América!”, señaló el funcionario.
