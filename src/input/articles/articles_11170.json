    "text": "| | PARIS — When Xi Jinping sits down for a state banquet with Emmanuel Macron on Monday, the flowing champagne and glittering chandeliers at the Elysée Palace won't be able to outshine one glaring truth: These two emperors are shaping up to fight. First, Xi — the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong — stands accused by Western governments of helping Vladimir Putin wage war in Ukraine by supplying technology and equipment for the Russian military. Second, the European Union and Beijing are on the brink of [a full-blown trade war](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-china-trade-war-nuctech-xi-jinping-von-der-leyen-ev/). Macron has been pushing Brussels to get tough with China over flooding the market with cheap electric vehicles. In return, Xi is threatening to slap tariffs on cognac, a painful gesture that’s left the French president and his homegrown liquor industry with a nasty headache.",

    "text": "Tampa General Hospital ( TGH ) has successfully weathered Hurricane Milton, with an assist from its AquaFence. It’s the second time in two weeks the innovative flood prevention device has protected the Tampa Bay region’s only Level 1 Trauma Center.\nThe water-impermeable barrier was installed to protect vulnerable areas of TGH’s campus against storm surge up to 15 feet above sea level.\n“Preparing for Hurricane Milton was an incredible effort by the entire team and a true test of our resources, but it ensured we could continue to provide exceptional care for our patients in a high-quality, safe and uninterrupted environment before, during and after the storm,” TGH President and CEO John Couris said. “Tampa General is open to support communities impacted and particularly our first responders. Working together, we will come back from Milton stronger than ever.”\nThe hospital also used the AquaFence during Hurricane Helene , which caused widespread flooding in coastal and low-lying areas throughout the Tampa Bay area, despite not taking a direct hit from the storm.\nTGH implements a comprehensive mitigation plan ahead of severe weather.\nThe hospital has an on-site energy source. Completed in 2022, a 16,000-square-foot Central Energy Plant is positioned 33 feet above sea level, providing a reliable, protected power supply in the event of power disruption. It is built to withstand the impact and flooding of a Category 5 hurricane. The plant houses generators and boilers that can create steam and hot water.\nLikewise, TGH also has an on-site water resource, a well that can provide more than 5,000 gallons of water to support patients and team members.\nThe hospital also took storm precautions, including stocking more than five days of supplies, such as food and linens, to support patient care and team member needs.\nThe hospital also staffed its facility with professionals trained in emergency management who remained on-site throughout the storm to ensure patient care. Additional providers have returned to work to relieve those teams and continue supporting response and recovery efforts.\nWhile Hurricane Milton did not cause the catastrophic levels of storm surge and flooding that had been predicted as a possibility, due to the storm’s landfall south of Tampa Bay, the AquaFence was still able to protect the hospital from hurricane-force winds and effectively prevent any flooding that would have occurred.\nTGH did not experience any major power outages, but still proactively activated its on-site power plant to ensure there were no interruptions to operations in the event of an outage.\nBy Thursday morning, TGH was fully open and supporting emergency response efforts to help the community recover and begin rebuilding.",

    "title": "Delight in Douglas Golf club after Senior Cup and Curtis Cup wins",
    "text": "Cork golfer Sara Byrne had a fairytale end to her amateur career, going unbeaten in five sessions and helping GB&I to win the Curtis Cup for the first time since 2016.\nThe Douglas golfer may have missed out on her club’s AIG Senior Cup win, but she made a lifetime of memories in Sunningdale.\nByrne played in all five sessions and she was the only player to undefeated over the three days.\nShe had a win and three halves in the opening two days alongside Lottie Woad, and closed out her final round as an amateur with a decisive win.\nTeam captain Catriona Matthew kept her faith in Byrne and Woad on the final day, putting them out first and second in a bid to close out the match.\nAlthough Sara needed to concentrate on her own match, she was aware that the momentum was starting to move towards the Americans.\n“I was very aware of it” said Byrne.\n“I was one of the starters; I was second out but by the time I had reached 13, there just seemed to be a bit too much red on that board.\n\"I think that's when I kind of locked in and was like, okay, we definitely need my point out here. I knew I backed my team this whole way.\n\"I knew we were going to flip it around come the end, and that's exactly what happened.”\nThe 23 year old was also happy to go through the week undefeated, especially with a crucial win on the final day.\n“Honestly, I don't think that has settled in yet, it kind of hit me on 15 when I went 3up. I kind of had in my head for a split second, I was like, oh, I think I've just gone undefeated here no matter what.\n\"I knew I needed that crucial point, not half point, so I was really able to lock back in and make a stress-free par on 16, which was really, really nice.”\n“But honestly, coming into this week, if I was told I was going to go undefeated, I probably wouldn't have believed you, to be honest.\n\"It's a really special feeling to end my amateur career just like that. So yeah, it was pretty special. This is a week of dreams.\n\"This is why we practice and why we want to play golf. Nine-year-old me wouldn't be able to believe this moment, that's for sure.”\nIt was an incredible way to finish an impressive amateur career, and Byrne can move to the professional ranks with confidence that she can compete and win at the highest levels. She is back in action this week at the Rose Series in Brocket Hall.\nThere was also delight in Douglas last week when they banished the memories of their 2022 Senior Cup Final defeat when they beat holders Royal Portrush to win the title.\nDouglas came through their quarter final with ease, but only booked their place in the final after a heroic semi-final performance.\nClodagh Coughlan was the first to tee off for Douglas and having come in with a point to prove after suffering defeat the previous day, Coughlan landed an early win on the 16th.\nShannon Burke had been in fantastic form both days, taking three points from three matches. Once again, Burke took her win comfortably, defeating Judith Allen 6&5 to see Douglas two in front early in the tie.\nRoyal Portrush picked up a vital point in match five before Lucy Simpson and Aoife Ní Thuama were set to play their first play-off hole after finishing all square through 18.\nIn the end, the extra holes were not required, with match four deciding the destination of the famous pennant. Like Coughlan, Karen O’Neill came into the final having lost her semi-final match but she took the 1up result and the title for Douglas.\nTeam Captain Davey Barry was delighted with the performance of his team.\n“This is just such an honour to be accepting these things for such a great team, we have been through a bit of heartache in the last couple of years, we had a few close calls, a few non-starts but to be here now it feels brilliant and to be going back to Douglas with the trophy it’s an awesome, awesome feeling.”",

Serra ha agradecido a los cuatro, con los que ha cruzado la frontera de La Jonquera (Girona) este mismo viernes, la \"piscina de amistad\" que le han brindado durante los meses que ha residido en Suiza. También ha dado las gracias a Òmnium, a su junta y a su presidente, Xavier Antich, por el apoyo, y ha reivindicado que se fueron \"para convertir el exilio en una lucha\" contra una causa que quería silenciarlos, ha dicho. Tras ser recibidos este viernes en Cantallops, donde se han encontrado con otros investigados por la causa de 'Tsunami Democràtic', seguirán con sus respectivas agendas, como la asistencia de algunos al acto de recibimiento de Òmnium Cultural en Barcelona a las 13 horas.",

    "text": "CIUDAD DE MÉXICO.— Erik Rubín ha generado la preocupación luego de que él mismo revelará que su estado de salud se ha visto afectado por una fuerte enfermedad. La expareja sentimental de Andrea Legarreta también desató los comentarios tras confesar que no la está pasando nada bien en temas de salud, que mostrarse en una cama. Aunado a ello, compartió una foto con la que comprobó que no se encuentra atravesando su mejor momento. ¿Qué enfermedad tiene Erik Rubín ? Mediante su cuenta de Instagram, el también exintegrante de Timbiriche preocupó a sus seguidores al compartir una fotografía en la que se mostró en una cama. Asimismo, su semblante evidenció que no la está pasando nada bien, por lo que podría finalizar el 2023 de la peor manera. No obstante sin afán de alarmar a sus fans, el intérprete de como “Con todos menos conmigo” y “Cuando mueres por alguien”, reveló que se encuentra luchando contra una infección estomacal que lo ha llevado a pasar varios días en reposo. Y, aunque el también protagonista de la obra de teatro “Vaselina”, no reveló su verdadero estado de salud, o qué fue lo que le causó que su salud se viera afectada, tras difundirse la foto de él en cama, varios internautas señalaron que Erik Rubin luce bastante enfermo. De igual modo, luego de que el cantante informara que enfermó, muchos cuestionaron si Andrea Legarreta lo está cuidando. Pero de acuerdo con sus historias de Instagram, [la conductora de TV ](https://www.yucatan.com.mx/espectaculos/2023/12/20/famosos-que-se-separaron-en-2023-las-rupturas-mas-impactantes.html)se encuentra en Disney con sus hijas y su yerno.",

Message volumes increased to ‘extremely high’ zone.\nIn November, its board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share, payable on December 4, 2024, to its shareholders of record as of November 18, 2024.\nFor its third quarter, the firm reported net income of $73.7 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $146.3 million, or $2.28 loss per share, for the third quarter of 2023.\nKemper provides specialized insurance services, including life and health insurance, operating through its specialty property and casualty insurance and life insurance segments. With approximately $13 billion in assets, its Kemper Auto and Kemper Life brands, serve over 4.8 million policies, represented by 22,200 agents and brokers, and 7,500 associates.\nKemper stock is up 32% year-to-date.\nFor updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com.<\nFor more reliable and latest news subscribe to Asianet Newsable WhatsApp channel by clicking here.

O jogo foi válido pela 18ª rodada do\n[Campeonato Inglês](https://www.gazetaesportiva.com/campeonatos/premier-league/)e contou com gols de Ayew, para os visitantes, e de Gakpo, Curtis Jones e Salah, a favor dos donos da casa.\nDesta maneira, o Liverpool, agora com 42 pontos, viu sua vantagem na ponta do Campeonato Inglês aumentar. Isso porque, mais cedo, o Chelsea (2º com 35 unidades)\n[foi derrotado pelo Fulham](https://www.gazetaesportiva.com/campeonatos/premier-league/vice-lider-chelsea-cede-empate-ao-fulham-mas-chega-a-decima-partida-seguida-sem-perder-no-ingles/), em pleno Stamford Bridge. O Arsenal ainda entra em campo na rodada e pode assumir a vice-liderança, ao atingir 36 pontos em caso de triunfo diante do Ipswich Town.\nPor sua vez, o Leicester seguiu na zona de rebaixamento e com alerta ligado. O time, atualmente na 18ª posição, tem 14 pontos, um a menos que o Wolverhampton, primeira equipe fora da degola.\nPara finalizar o ano de 2024, os dois times entram em campo pela 19ª rodada do Inglês. No próximo domingo (29), o Liverpool visita o West Ham, às 14h15 (de Brasília). Já o Leicester, no mesmo dia, às 11h30, recebe o irregular Manchester City, de Pep Guardiola.\nOS GOLS\nO Leicester inaugurou o marcador aos 6 minutos do primeiro tempo, quando conseguiu subir ao ataque pela primeira vez. Pela esquerda, Mavididi avançou e cruzou rasteiro para Ayew, que estava dentro da grande área. Ao receber, o jogador girou para cima de Robertson e finalizou, de perna direita, no canto inferior direito de Alisson, que não alcançou.\nO empate do Liverpool saiu nos acréscimos da etapa inicial, aos 46 minutos. Mac Allister passou para Cody Gakpo, que, de fora da área, finalizou de perna direita, colocado, no canto esquerdo de Stolarczyk, goleiro dos visitantes.\nNo início da etapa complementar, aos 3 minutos, os Reds viraram. A equipe mandante rapidamente recuperou a posse de bola dentro da área do Leicester e Salah passou para Mac Allister. O argentino, camisa 10, cruzou rasteiro e Curtis Jones, livre de marcação, completou para o fundo das redes.\nPara fechar a conta, aos 37 minutos o Liverpool anotou seu terceiro gol na partida. Gakpo lançou para Salah, que avançou pela esquerda, invadiu a área e finalizou de canhota no canto inferior direito de Stolarczyk.\n🇪🇬👑\n[pic.twitter.com/wN7evjy4vq]\n— Liverpool FC (@LFC)[December 26, 2024]",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#3](c3#c-3) [#2](c2#c-2) no se qué veis de incomprensible\nNo sólo se ha facilitado y propiciado durante siglos, sino que en los últimos años, aún se les ha dado más manga ancha.\nPor lo visto, con eso de que toda la gente le pide tanto a su dios continuamente, se debe de amortizar de algún modo.\nEn fin, magufadas, lo normal.. mientras formen parte del adn político-socio-cultural.\n[#2](c2#c-2) El PSOE de antes de la guerra civil participó en la Constitución española que incluyó el siguiente artículo:\nArtículo 26.\nTodas las confesiones religiosas serán consideradas como Asociaciones sometidas a una ley especial.\nEl Estado, las regiones, las provincias y los Municipios, no mantendrán, favorecerán, ni auxiliarán económicamente a las Iglesias, Asociaciones e Instituciones religiosas.\nUna ley especial regulará la total extinción, en un plazo máximo de dos años, del presupuesto del Clero.\nQuedan disueltas aquellas Órdenes religiosas que estatutariamente impongan, además de los tres votos canónicos, otro especial de obediencia a autoridad distinta de la legítima del Estado. Sus bienes serán nacionalizados y afectados a fines benéficos y docentes.\nLas demás Órdenes religiosas se someterán a una ley especial votada por estas Cortes Constituyentes y ajustada a las siguientes bases:\n1ª. Disolución de las que, por sus actividades, constituyan un peligro para la seguridad del Estado.\n2ª. Inscripción de las que deban subsistir, en un Registro especial dependientes del Ministerio de Justicia.\n3ª. Incapacidad de adquirir y conservar, por sí o por persona interpuesta, más bienes que los que, previa justificación, se destinen a su vivienda o al cumplimiento directo de sus fines privativos.\n4ª. Prohibición de ejercer la industria, el comercio o la enseñanza.\n5ª. Sumisión a todas las leyes tributarias del país.\n6ª. Obligación de rendir anualmente cuentas al Estado de la inversión de sus bienes en relación con los fines de la Asociación.\nLos bienes de las Órdenes religiosas podrán ser nacionalizados.\nhttps://www.congreso.es/constitucion/ficheros/historicas/cons_1931.pdf\nLuego en pleno franquismo, en 1974, se compró a base de talonario al PSOE en el congreso de Suresnes. Y desde entonces el PSOE \"actual\" pasó a ser pseudofranquista, dado que a pesar de haber tenido una mayoría absoluta en el 82, mantiene privilegios y protege con uñas y dientes a tooooooda la herencia del franquismo: ejército, judicatura, monarquía, FFCCSE, grandes fortunas nacidas del latrocinio franquista, iglesia, etc.. Ha tardado décadas en quitar parte (que no todos) de los monumentos que glorificaban a Franco y al franquismo.\nEspecialmente a la iglesia le aumentó el % que se llevan de la \"X\" de la renta, y le han dejado carta blanca para expandirse por servicios esenciales como educación, residencias, sanidad, etc, a la vez que se ha permitido el pago con dinero público para los negocios privados de la multinacional vaticana.\nPor un Concordato fullero prorrogado del franquismo se ha librado la iglesia de ser juzgada por todos los casos de abusos sexuales a menores que lleva perpetrando \"desde siempre\" y hasta nuestros días, y está exenta de pagar la mayoría de impuestos que sí pagamos el resto de los súbditos. ¡Con la excusa de que no tienen dinero! Luego te enteras de que a raíz de inmatricularse a su nombre la Mezquita de Córdoba por 30€ están sacando un beneficio EN NEGRO (sin tributar por ello) de hasta 18 millones de euros al año. Y tienen 99.999 propiedades más dedicadas a su dios verdadero: EL DINERO\n[#4](c4#c-4) Primero hay que derogar el Concordato y luego establecer un sistema de financiación como el alemán, cortando cualquier atisbo de dinero público para la secta y donde sean los fieles los que paguen y mantengan a la secta con un 8-9% de su dinero.\nDespués, si se ve que ya casi no hay adeptos a la secta, desamortización con la restauración del artículo 26 de la anterior Constitución española (ver\n[#33](c33#c-33)). Que dicho artículo se redactó así por algo, todos sus puntos tienen un sentido recogido de un porqué histórico, menudos problemas ha dado la iglesia en España desde siempre, conspirando, adoctrinando, abusando y trincando todo lo público que les ha venido en gana sin pagar por ello.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Estas sectas siempre están disponibles para entrar en los negocios de verdad: nadie mejor que ellos para legitimizar y glorificar golpes de estado y dictadores genocidas como los que han propiciado el expolio en España o la religión que alimenta con su irracionalidad la invasión de Palestina.\n[#32](c32#c-32) ya se hace, en la catedral de Pamplona podías organizar la comida de la boda, previo pago generoso\n[#11](c11#c-11) No se donde leí que la desamortización de Mendizabal fue quitarle tierras a la iglesia para repartírselas luego 4 señoritos ricos.\nAdenda (De la susodicha desamortización de Mendizabal en la wikipedia) :\nLos pequeños labradores no pudieron entrar en las pujas y las tierras fueron compradas por nobles y burgueses urbanos adinerados, de forma que no pudo crearse una verdadera burguesía o clase media en España que sacase al país de su marasmo.\n[#28](c28#c-28) Añádele que, según alguinos cálculos, suposu la deforestación de entre el cinco y el 7% de todo el país, una ruina para el partrimionio artístico y una ruina fatal para los aparceros que pasaron de estar en \"renta antigua\" a no poder vivir de sus tierras.\nUn desastre.\nA mi me hace bastante gracia, ( por decirlo suavemente) cada vez que paso por la calle Almagro de Madrid por la puerta de un conjunto de edificios de la Iglesia que abarcan toda una enorme manzana y que probablemente este en el podium de los terrenos más caros de todo Madrid. ¿sabeis como se llama la congregación que vive allí? Hermanitas de los pobres. Con dos ovarios.\nY empezaron con un establo!\nHay que desamortizar todos los bienes cuyo uso no sea el de templo para oficios reliosos o monasterios.\nLas residencias de los curas, obispos y demás deben estar a su nombre y pagar los impuestos correspondientes como persona física.\n[#0](c0#c-0) Es curioso que en la entradilla del artículo (copiado a la de aquí) pongan equivocadamente \"100,000\" y que luego en el texto salga correctamente \"100.000\". Ya he visto este error en la entradilla de dos medios más, por ahora.\nLuego espero que los del medio de comunicación se den cuenta de un error garrafal: \"En cumplimiento de lo establecido en la Ley Orgánica de Protección de Datos de Carácter Personal 15/1999 (...)\" (esta Ley es obsoleta, se cumple el RGPD de 2016).\n[#18](c18#c-18)\nNo me hagas reír.\nInmuebles para caridad ?\nPor eso no pagan IBI ,ni IVA y muy probablemente esas monjas cobraban en negro.\nDecía Saramago que la Iglesia solo ha servido para separar, quemar y torturar\nNunca para unir a la gente.\nLa Iglesia es el Gran Parásito de nuestra sociedad..",
