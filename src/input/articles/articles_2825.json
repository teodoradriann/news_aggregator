    "text": "The move comes after Hybe, which manages K-Pop sensation BTS, opened an audit into ADOR on April 22 over allegations that CEO Min Hee-jin sought to take the sublabel independent. ADOR CEO Min denied the allegations and accused Hybe of copying the concept of ADOR’s girl group NewJeans for another girl group under a different Hybe subsidiary.\nThe Hybe Co. headquarters in Seoul, South Korea on Feb. 19, 2023.\nSouth Korea’s largest entertainment agency Hybe is set to file an official police complaint against executives of its sublabel ADOR on charges of breach of trust and other offenses.\nThe move comes after Hybe, which manages K-pop sensation BTS, opened an audit into ADOR on April 22 over allegations that CEO Min Hee-jin was aiming to take the sublabel independent. A Hybe statement sent to CNBC said the company also called for Min to step down.\nMin denied the allegations and accused Hybe of copying the concept of ADOR’s girl group, NewJeans, for another girl group under a different Hybe subsidiary.\nHybe also told CNBC that it has substantial evidence that Min sought to seize control of the sublabel, stating that “the evidence included detailed discussions that Min has ordered the ADOR management to find ways to pressure HYBE into ultimately selling ADOR’s shares.”\nA screenshot was also provided by Hybe of a message between Min and ADOR’s vice CEO. In the message, the vice CEO outlined various methods to take the label independent, including approaching other investors and convincing Hybe to sell its stake in the sublabel.\nHybe added that one of the audited parties “submitted information assets to seize the management of ADOR and to attempt to contact external investors. The auditee also admitted to creating the documents to attack Hybe.”\nWhen the announcement of the audit broke Monday, shares of Hybe slid 8%, marking its largest fall in seven months. The stock was little changed Thursday.\nHybe holds an 80% stake in ADOR, with Min holding 18% and other executives splitting the remaining 2%.\nThe development also comes as NewJeans is poised to come back with a new single on May 24.\nHybe said it will continue to provide care for the group and support its upcoming comeback, as well as meet the members’ legal representatives to discuss how to protect the group.\nMulti-label The development is a blow to Hybe’s “multi-label strategy,” where the agency houses multiple independent labels to “ensure that a wide variety of music and content are created.”\nThis is in contrast to traditional K-pop agencies, which hold all their artists in the same stable and rely on a few major names for growth.\nIn a 2022 release, Hybe said that “we look forward to their growth through mutual cooperation and, at times, even healthy competition.”\nLast year, Bernstein also identified this as one of Hybe’s strengths in an investor note. The revenue and growth from other sublabels allowed the company to make up for BTS’ hiatus due to South Korea’s mandatory military service, the firm said.\nIn contrast, shares of rival YG Entertainment fluctuated wildly after members of Blackpink did not re-sign their individual contracts with the agency.\n— CNBC’s Chery Kang contributed to this report.",

    "text": "TEL AVIV, Israel — A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz on Thursday announced the death of Judith Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza.\nThe news came six days after Weinstein's husband, Gad Haggai, was also pronounced dead.\nWeinstein, 70, and Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of Oct. 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others.\nIn the early hours of the morning, Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family.\nWeinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Haggai was killed Oct. 7 and his body was taken to Gaza.\nOn Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Weinstein was also killed on Oct. 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza.\nIt was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths.\nThe couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbut said.\nPresident Joe Biden said he was ''devastated'' to learn of Weinstein's death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter.\nThe families \"have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal,'' he said in a statement.\nWeinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician.\n''Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,'' her family said in a statement.\nAl Haggai, one of the couple's sons, told Israel's Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother's multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children.\nHe said that when his mother's name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something happened to her.\nAccording to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity.\nNir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on Oct. 7, with roughly one- quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped.\nThe families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new cease-fire deal to bring home their loved-ones.\nNetanyahu met Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office.\n''I can't elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,'' he said.",

    "text": "C’est un moment fort de la paroisse de Muret que ce temps de Pâques…\nLe point du Triduum commence le Jeudi-Saint pour s’achever le soir de Pâques, fête de la résurrection du Christ. Mais dès lundi, nous étions, nous les prêtres, près de notre évêque, Guy de Kerimel, pour le renouvellement de notre engagement sacerdotal.\nQuelle est la symbolique de la fête religieuse de Pâques ?\nVu le contexte d’aujourd’hui, Pâques pourrait signifier faire triompher la vie face au nombre si élevé de morts partout dans le monde, des morts physiques bien sûr, mais aussi des morts spirituelles.\nSans compter les morts de ceux qui prétendent agir sous le commandement d’une religion…\nOn ne peut tuer au nom d’une religion. Vous faites peut-être allusion aux Musulmans, mais l’islam n’est pas une religion de mort, la vie y est sacrée. Toute religion poussée à l’extrême n’est jamais bonne. Il faut trouver le juste milieu et vivre sa foi dans le Christ animé par la vie, la fraternité et le pardon.\nLa fréquentation des offices, l’implication de vos paroissiens dans les projets liturgiques, la foi muretaine dans son ensemble vous satisfont-ils ?\nOui, bien sûr. Nous constatons de plus en plus d’adultes qui demandent le baptême, encore 8 pour cette Pâques. Nous avons les équipes pour les accompagner. Nous-mêmes ne sommes pas là que pour dire les messes, mais pour dynamiser la vie de la paroisse. On travaille déjà sur la Lettre pastorale de l’évêque qui fera l’objet de propositions lors de la prochaine assemblée générale paroissiale en juin. Et en termes de fréquentation, c’est toujours aussi dynamique à Muret, un peu moins dans les villages.\nCe Vendredi-Saint sera aussi particulier…\nOui, nous renouvelons l’opération Chemin de Croix engagée l’an passé et qui avait connu un joli succès. Nous donnons rendez-vous à 18 heures place de la République, et l’office de la Passion suivra à l’église Saint-Jacques à 19 heures.\nRecueilli par Xavier Hurtevent",

    "text": "BEAUMONT, Texas — With freezing temperatures on their way, it's important to keep your pets out of the elements. \"You really want to be prepared to accommodate those elements with them inside your house. The wind chills are going to be single digit, talking about having a wintery mix it's just best to have them inside even if it's temporary,\" said [Southeast Texas Humane Society](https://humanesocietyofsoutheasttexas.org/) Manager Taylor Westphal. Animal experts say if you must leave a pet outside, providing a proper shelter with hay, blankets and more to keep them warm is essential. Some dogs are built to endure freezing temperatures, while others should be kept inside. \"We had a husky named Arnold who during the last cold temps refused to come inside, so of course you are going to have dogs like that. But also, like your chiweenie needs to come inside,\" Westphal said. Some of the other local shelters, like Beaumont Animal Care are taking steps to get their dogs fostered so they can be out of the cold. It's not too late to foster a dog in need before the freezing temperatures hit. \"To get the same response and find these animals a foster. It's not a long period of time, maybe three to four days at the most. Once the freeze is over the fosters can bring them back,\" said Beaumont Animal Care Foster and Adoption Coordinator Viviana Lopez. The main push is to keep your animals safe and healthy, but also keeping an eye out for animals left outside. Knowing who to call if an animal is in danger is important. \"If you live in the city of Beaumont you can call 311, which is Beaumont Animal Care or animal control. They can issue citations,\" said Westphal.",

Más contenido a continuación TSLA XIACF CHHL WB 1211.HK\nLei Jun , cofundador y consejero delegado de Xiaomi , presentó el jueves el primer vehículo eléctrico de la empresa, lo que supone la entrada del fabricante chino de smartphones en el competitivo mercado de los vehículos eléctricos.\nEl multimillonario se abstuvo de revelar la fecha exacta de lanzamiento o el precio del SU7 , abreviatura de Speed Ultra , pero sí afirmó que Xiaomi pretende convertirse en uno de los principales actores del sector a escala mundial. La compañía había dicho anteriormente que planeaba lanzar el coche en la primera mitad de 2024.\n\"Después de tres años fabricando coches, me di cuenta de lo difícil que es esta empresa\", dijo Lei . \"Pero después de 15 a 20 años de duro trabajo, nuestro objetivo es convertir a Xiaomi en una de las cinco principales empresas de vehículos eléctricos del mundo\".\nComo uno de los lanzamientos de producto más esperados del año, Lei se dirigió a un público repleto en el Centro Nacional de Convenciones de China en Pekín, donde describió algunas de las características del nuevo vehículo.\nCoche eléctrico de Xiaomi: fecha de lanzamiento, precios, motores y últimas noticias Lei no reveló la autonomía de los vehículos eléctricos de Xiaomi , pero sí dijo que funcionarán con baterías fabricadas en colaboración con las empresas chinas BYD y Contemporary Amperex Technologies . También se dice que los vehículos son capaces de mantener su autonomía en condiciones de frío extremo, cuando normalmente consumen más energía para calentar el compartimento.\nXiaomi afirma que el SU7 superará a los vehículos eléctricos de gama alta de Tesla o Porsche gracias a los avances de la empresa tecnológica en el motor del vehículo, la conducción autónoma y los sistemas de gestión de la batería.\nEl lunes, Lei escribió en la red social china Weibo que el SU7 podría parecer \"un poco caro\". El modelo rivalizará en prestaciones con el deportivo totalmente eléctrico Taycan Turbo de Porsche , que puede recorrer hasta 627 kilómetros con una sola carga. También se fabricará con funciones de conducción inteligente similares a las del Model S de Tesla , según la publicación de Lei en las redes sociales.\nContinuar leyendo la historia \"Sin duda superaremos las expectativas de la gente\", escribió el ejecutivo de 54 años en Weibo .\nEl coche eléctrico de Xiaomi podría costar desde 12.500 euros, según el CEO de la compañía El vehículo eléctrico de Xiaomi será probablemente una berlina de cinco plazas con techo panorámico de cristal, según un informe publicado en noviembre por el Ministerio de Industria y Tecnología de la Información chino. Un post publicado el jueves en la cuenta oficial de la empresa en Weibo también muestra un coche azul brillante con techo de cristal oscuro. Hoy ha desvelado otros dos colores, verde y gris.\nMientras tanto, se espera que el mercado chino de vehículos de nueva energía crezca alrededor de un 20% el año que viene, hasta alcanzar los 11 millones de unidades, lo que significa que aproximadamente uno de cada tres coches vendidos en el país funcionará con electricidad, según estimaciones de la Asociación China de Turismos . La competencia entre los fabricantes de vehículos eléctricos, como Tesla y BYD , de Wang Chuanfu , ya es muy intensa y han recurrido a agresivos recortes de precios para arrebatarse cuota de mercado unos a otros.\nLei dice que la competencia no le disuade, al menos en lo que respecta a la conducción autónoma. \"Las tecnologías de conducción autónoma cambian muy deprisa, y empezar tarde tiene sus ventajas\", afirma. \"Significa que podemos trabajar desde un umbral más alto y construir a partir de ahí\".\nNota realizada por Forbes US\n ",
