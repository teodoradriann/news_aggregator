    "title": "Oregon lawmakers vote to limit rent increases for manufactured home owners",
    "text": "The debate in the Oregon House on Wednesday over whether to cap rent increases on manufactured homes fell along familiar dividing lines; Republicans called for fewer regulations and a focus on housing supply, while Democrats cautioned the measure was necessary to keep vulnerable seniors housed.\nDemocrats won.\nRep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat from Ashland and an architect of the bill, House Bill 3054, said when she first ran for office her legislative district had the most manufactured homes in the state. Then the 2020 Almeda fire tore through the Rogue Valley, wiping out 1,500 manufactured homes in the span of a day.\nThe measure, she said, was crafted to help “Oregonians in our (manufactured) parks grow old in the homes and neighborhoods that provide comfort and support.”\nOregon has about 62,000 manufactured homes and more than 1,000 manufactured home parks throughout the state, Marsh said on the House floor. Residents often own their own home and pay rent to the landowner on which their home sits. They are often fixed to the site and therefore more vulnerable if rent is increased, since it’s costly to move their home.\n“Unlike other renters, a manufactured home resident cannot pick up and move when the rents escalate,” Marsh said on the House floor. “Their only choice is to slash other expenditures in the household budget or to sell or even abandon the home.”\nSimilar debates are being waged nationwide, as investors have been scooping up manufactured homes and raising rents.\n“These out-of-state corporate entities have little interest in the parks other than to exploit residents for as much profit as possible,” Marsh said.\nRelated: Oregon and Washington are preparing for fights over rent increases in manufactured home parks\nThe measure does try to account for local owners, the Democratic lawmaker noted. The bill lowers the allowable annual rent increase on manufactured home parks and marinas to 6%. That doesn’t apply to parks and marinas with 30 or fewer spaces, exempting them from the cap.\nThe measure also only applies to park residents who own their homes, if a person is renting the cap does not apply. It would also allow park owners who have more than 30 spaces to increase the rent by 12% to account for major infrastructure updates.\nThe current limit that can be charged is about 10%.\nRepublicans showed up to the House floor prepared to fight.\n“It seems like this body is passing bills that make housing more expensive and then we see expensive housing,” said Republican Ed Diehl, of Scio. “Then we say, ‘Oh we need to respond to that.’” And so we do rate caps. It’s like we are in this housing doom loop.”\nDiehl said he wants to see vulnerable seniors remain in their manufactured homes, but the solution, he said, is to build more houses, not add more constraints.\nIt was a refrain echoed by many Republicans.\n“If our goal is to help those at the very lowest income levels, especially in manufactured home parks, there are better ways to do it. We can offer tax credits or targeted subsidies to park owners who voluntarily keep rents lower for those residents,” Diehl said. “That’s a solution that helps those in need without disrupting the broader housing market.”\nHouse Bill 3054 now heads to the state Senate for consideration.",

    "text": "Meghan Markles „magische Blumenstreusel“ bieten Steilvorlage für lustige Parodien\nMit ihren fragwürdigen Lifestyle-Tipps sorgte Meghan Markle zuletzt für hämische Kommentare. Während eines Auftritts verteidigte die Herzogin jetzt unter anderem ihre vielfach kritisierte Blumendeko.\nNew York – Ihre Netflix-Show „With Love, Meghan“ sollte Meghan Markle (43) eigentlich als Expertin in Lifestyle-Fragen etablieren. Der Versuch ging jedoch ziemlich nach hinten los, denn die Ehefrau von Prinz Harry (40) machte sich mit ihren seltsam anmutenden Küchentipps in den sozialen Netzwerken zum Gespött der Zuschauer. Insbesondere die essbaren getrockneten Blüten, die laut Meghan selbst den einfachsten Gerichten einen Gourmet-Anstrich verleihen, führten im Netz zu zahlreichen Parodien.\nMeghans „magische Blumenstreusel“ sorgen für Lacher auf Social Media\nEines steht fest: „With Love, Meghan“ hat die Herzogin von Sussex zweifelsohne wieder einmal ins Gespräch gebracht. Seit der Veröffentlichung der Netflix-Produktion häufen sich die Satire-Posts auf Instagram, TikTok und Co., wobei vor allem die „magischen Blumenstreusel“ der zweifachen Mutter für Kopfschütteln sorgen. Bei der fraglichen Essensdeko handelt es sich um getrocknete Blüten, die Meghan liebend gerne über Rührei, Salate und Joghurtspeisen streut.\nDass sie selbst ganz und gar überzeugt von der beeindruckenden Wirkung ihrer essbaren Blumen ist, veranlasste seitdem zahlreiche Social-Media-Nutzer zu Parodien von „With Love, Meghan“. Kurzerhand werden Blütenblätter jetzt über alles gestreut – auch auf das Butterbrot. Während eines öffentlichen Auftritts in New York verteidigte Meghan ihre „magischen Blumenstreusel“ jetzt jedoch vehement.\nLaut Meghan sind die getrockneten Blüten mehr als nur Deko auf dem Teller\nBeim „Time100“-Gipfel bezeichnete Meghan Markle ihre vielfach kritisierten Blütenstreusel als eine Art „Analogie“, denn laut der Herzogin stehen die essbaren Blumen für mehr als nur Deko. „Lasst uns über die Blumenstreusel reden“, erklärte Meghan „The Daily Beast“-Berichten zufolge im Gespräch mit „Time“-CEO Jessica Sibley, „denn ich glaube es geht um die kleinen Momente der Freude, die so mühelos sind und einfach das kleine bisschen Magie erschaffen, nach dem wir uns alle in unserem Alltag sehnen.“\nOffenbar scheint Meghan also eine regelrechte Philosophie in ihren Blumenstreuseln zu sehen. Dass zahlreiche Social-Media-User anderer Meinung sind, interessiert die Ex-Schauspielerin dagegen nur wenig. Angesprochen auf die Parodien im Netz, entgegnete sie amüsiert mit einem Zitat der Komikerin Tina Fey (54): „Wenn du jemals anfängst zufrieden mit dir zu sein, gibt es dieses Ding namens Internet, da kannst du viele Menschen finden, die dich nicht mögen.“ In Zukunft könnten Meghan Markle und Prinz Harry übrigens ihre Titel verlieren.

    "text": "A Greek crude tanker adrift in the southern Red Sea was targeted by a sea drone as crew members were evacuated, according to the EU naval force and UK Maritime Trade Operations, as the most destructive attack on Red Sea shipping continued for a second day.\nNot registered? Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience.\nRegister Now In a statement on X Aug. 22, Eunavor Aspides, the EU military operation in the Red Sea, said it had destroyed an unmanned surface vehicle, otherwise known as a sea drone, on a rescue mission to the Sounion, a ship managed by Greek operator Delta Tankers that was struck by four missiles while carrying Iraqi crude to Greece via the Red Sea.\n\"Carrying 150,000 tons of crude oil, the MV SOUNION now represents a navigational and environmental hazard. It is essential that everyone in the area exercises caution and refrains from any actions that could lead to a deterioration of the current situation,\" it said.\nThe ship's 25 crew members were picked up by a rescue ship after the drone was destroyed and were being transported to safety at the port of Djibouti, according to the EU naval force.\nS&P Global Commodities at Sea data showed the Sounion was laden with 1 million barrels of Basrah Heavy crude from Iraq, which it had loaded Aug. 12. The Greek shipping ministry separately confirmed the ship was on a voyage to Agioi Theodoroi, where Motor Oil has a 200,000 b/d refinery.\n\"The attacks will likely further shut down Red Sea traffic,\" said Rick Joswick, head of S&P Global Commodity Insights near-term oil research, warning of a \"temporary tightening effect\" on the broader oil complex as deliveries are delayed and refiners seek prompt backfills. However, an expected oversupply in global crude markets in the coming months could mitigate upside, Joswick said.\nFreight rates proved unshaken by the attacks Aug. 22, when Platts, a part of Commodity Insights, assessed freight on the 140,000 mt dirty Arab Gulf - UKC route unchanged on the day at $21.2/mt and down from $21.58/mt Aug. 20.\nIn a statement Aug. 22, Delta Tankers said plans were in place to move the Sounion to a safer destination, while the UKMTO confirmed at 16:10 UTC that the vessel had been anchored. Delta Tankers had not received reports of pollution as of Aug. 21, a company spokesperson said.\nDry bulk vessel south of Aden damaged by drone\nAnother vessel south of Aden, Yemen, was also targeted by a sea drone and sustained \"minor damage\" Aug. 22, according to the UKMTO and Ambrey, after emerging unscathed from five attacks strikes Aug. 21.\nThe vessel, which sources identified as the bulk carrier SW North Wind I, continues to proceed to its next port of call, with crew members reported safe, according to the UKMTO.\nCAS data showed the Panama-flagged vessel is operated by Sea World Management SAM.\nThe drone-stricken ship had stopped transmitting an AIS signal prior to entering the western Gulf of Aden, Ambrey said Aug. 22, advising merchant shipping to maintain a safe distance from vessels transiting the Red Sea without emitting an identification signal.\nPrevious attacks\nThe show of force marks the most destructive attacks on the troubled Red Sea shipping route after recent attempts on the trade lane have failed to inflict damage on passing vessels. Delta Tankers appeared to proceed undeterred despite three attacks on its vessels this month, most recently on the Delta Blue, which emerged unscathed after four attacks Aug. 9.\nPreviously, the 82,400-dwt Greek-owned bulk carrier Tutor was the last vessel to sink after a drone attack June 12.\nUKMTO records and media reports suggest that eight ships have been attacked by the Iran-backed militants in August, though shipping routes have stayed broadly resilient as the majority of vessels continue to sail around the Cape of Good Hope to avoid disruption.\nMajor energy and shipping companies, including BP, Maersk, QatarEnergy and Frontline, have altered their routes to sail around Africa to avoid Houthi attacks, while the latest IMF PortWatch data showed the average daily ship transits via the Bab al-Mandab Strait stood at 23 in the week ended Aug. 11, down by over a third from a year-ago level of 70.\nShipping sources said that the attacks were yet to support freight rates from the Arab Gulf, but cautioned that the incidents could support prices heading into a period of seasonal demand strength.\n\"VLCC [rates are] coming off in AG at least, plus [Red Sea] attacks will make owners rather trade in West or go via COGH which will put pressure on opening tonnage,\" said one broker.",

    "text": "On February 3, 2024, Almirsaad website, which publishes reports and essays favoring the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA, i.e., the Afghan Taliban), published an article, saying that Jews promote Satanic thoughts and war and that Islam is their primary target. The Pashtu-language article, titled \"Jews And The Goals Of The Jews,\" is written by one Maher Bilal, who says the Jews are the friends of Dajjal, a figure in Islamic eschatology who resembles the anti-Christ in Christianity, and says that Dajjal will emerge from their community and that they will fight Islam first and then Christianity. The author goes on to argue that according to Islamic traditions, Allah will punish the Jews both in this world and the hereafter, adding: \"[Jews] assured themselves that [Hamas] no longer have jihadi tendencies, but those people [Hamas] were imposed on them by Allah.\" Following is the text of the article, as translated from Pashtu: \"The Jews Hate All Religions, But They Hate Islam The Most; From The Beginning Of Islam Until Now, The Mission Of The Jews Has Been To Uproot Islam And Replace It With A Global Zionist-Jewish System\" SUPPORT OUR WORK \"The Jews, Israel, and the Zionist regime are considered to be the worst people in the world. The Jews have made everything dependent on themselves, saying, 'we will be the only ones in heaven.' Judaism is basically considered an ethnic religion. If a Christian or a person of any other religion wants to adopt Judaism, they will not be accepted until they trace their lineage to Jacob, peace be upon him, because they believe that Jews and only Jews will go to heaven. This is absolutely false; Jews have no destiny other than hell. \"The main occupation of the Jews is magic; they often do their work through witchcraft and magic and promote their Satanic thought. Moreover, Jews are very cruel, oppressive, and arrogant; their oppression is not limited to the younger generation. Women, children, and older men have been and are victims of the oppression of the Jews, most of the time children in the wombs of pregnant women have not been exempt from their oppression and have been victims of oppression. \"The Jews hate all religions, but they hate Islam the most. From the beginning of Islam until now, the mission of the Jews is to remove the roots of Islam and replace it with a global Zionist/Jewish system so that only Jews remain in the world. This is their work and mission that has not yet succeeded and will not succeed in the future, Lillahil-Hamd [Praise be to Allah].\" \"From Hadiths [Traditions Of Muhammad], It Is Known That Dajjal Will Be From Their Tribe And His Supporters Will Be Jews; [Dajjal's] Battle Will Be First With Muslims And Lastly With Christians\" \"From the hadiths [traditions of Muhammad], it is known that Dajjal will be from their tribe and his supporters will be Jews; his battle will be first with Muslims and lastly with Christians. The followers of the Christian religion will also be collaborators and soldiers of the Dajjal at first, but in the end this Dajjal and the Jews will fight with them because [Dajjal and Jews] want to establish a global Dajjali system in which all the people will be Jews. \"I have already mentioned that the Jews' hatred is against all religions, but most of all against Islam because the Jews will fight first with the Momineen [believers] and then with others. It is clear from hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, that the Dajjal will appear among the Jews; so, the Jews have been preparing for everything for centuries and are waiting for it. \"Some scholars believe that the Jews meet Dajjal and take advice from him, but they are unable to free him from the strong prison of Allah. The work of the Jews is Satanism, deception, and entangling people in war. Therefore, in the present era, the Jews have involved the whole world in wars, and everyone dances to their signs. Even Adolf Hitler believed that 'If there are two fish and they are fighting each other in the deep sea, the hand of the Jews is also there.' And there is no doubt about it.\" \"The Jews First Trick The Kings Of All Places With Beautiful Girls And Take All The Secrets From Them\"; \"And Despite All Their Efforts, There Are Youth Fighting With The Jews Like The Youth Of Palestine\" \"I saw in a book that the Jews first trick the kings of all places with beautiful girls and take all the secrets from them until they turn them into slaves. If girls do not work, then they trick them through alcohol; and if that does not work, their last trick is witchcraft and magic. Once these oppressors did magic on the beloved Prophet Muhammad, but Allah did not leave His beloved prophet under their magic and revealed a chapter of the Quran for salvation. \"Despite all these plans, deceptions, and tricks of the Jews, Muslims still exist in the world today. In a small geographical area [Afghanistan], the real Islamic system rules, and despite all their effort, there are youths fighting the Jews like the youths of Palestine. This is the reason that Allah is the protector of his religion. Even if they try hard and deny Allah's divinity, Allah will punish them in this world and in the hereafter. A clear proof for worldly punishment [of the Jews by Allah] is the killing of Jews by the mujahideen of Hamas. \"The Jews did not expect those people [of Hamas] to fight, but they are being severely harmed today by them [Hamas]. [They are] A group that [Jews] had worked on and assured themselves that [Hamas] no longer have jihadi tendencies; Allah imposed those people [Hamas] on them. Finally, I call on all Muslims to help their Palestinian brothers in any way, whether financially or physically. Never forget them in your good prayers. The Palestinian mujahideen do not need financial help as much as they need physical help; so, try to help them physically.\" Source: Almirsaad.com (Afghanistan), February 3, 2024.",

    "title": "A New Type of Seismic Sensor to Detect Moonquakes",
    "text": "During the Apollo missions of the 1970s, several seismometers were flown to the Moon, where they collected data on lunar seismic trembling for eight years. The data showed some lunar quakes were as powerful as a magnitude 5. Unlike the Earth, the Moon is not tectonically active. Lunar quakes have different origins: Some are caused by day-to-night [thermal differences](/about/news/the-lunar-alarm-clock-new-study-characterizes-regular-moonquakes) as the surface varies in temperature, others that occur deeper may be caused by Earth's gravitational pull, and still others are caused by the Moon slowly cooling and contracting over time. Understanding how, when, and where these quakes occur is critical for planning missions to the Moon, especially if permanent structures like a lunar base are to be built on its surface. A new study demonstrates that an emerging new seismological technology called distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) would be able to [measure](https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/earthquakes/earthquakes-measured) lunar quakes with unprecedented precision. As NASA's upcoming Artemis missions plan to return to the Moon to, among other research aims, deploy new seismic sensors, the study makes a case for using DAS rather than conventional seismometers. A paper describing the research appears on April 10 in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters. For the past decade, Professor of Geophysics [Zhongwen Zhan](https://www.gps.caltech.edu/people/zhongwen-zhan?back_url=%2Fpeople%3Fcategory%3D17) (PhD '13) has been developing DAS, which involves sending lasers through a fiber optic cable and measuring how the laser light changes throughout the cable as it experiences shaking or tremors. In this way, the cable acts as a sequence of hundreds of [individual seismometers](/about/news), allowing researchers to measure quakes very precisely. A [recent study](/about/news/california-supervolcano-is-cooling-off-but-may-still-cause-quakes) showed that a 100-kilometer stretch of cable could function as the equivalent of 10,000 seismometers. With only a few individual seismometers far apart from each other on the Moon, the seismic signals of lunar quakes are quite fuzzy, or \"noisy,\" like listening to a radio full of static. This is due to a phenomenon called scattering, where seismic waves become less clear when traveling through the powdery upper layer of the Moon's surface. Having multiple sensors—indeed, having thousands, as a fiber optic cable could provide—would help clarify a noisy signal. In the new study, led by Qiushi Zhai, postdoctoral scholar research associate in geophysics, the researchers deployed a fiber optic cable equipped with DAS technology in Antarctica. The South Pole's freezing, dry environment, far away from human activities, is the closest analog on Earth to the Moon. The DAS sensors were sensitive enough to measure the small shaking caused by the ice cracking and moving, suggesting that they would be able to measure moonquakes. \"Another advantage of using DAS on the Moon is that a fiber optic cable is physically quite resilient to the harsh lunar environment: high radiation, extreme temperatures, and heavy dust,\" says Zhai. The next steps are to demonstrate that DAS can operate with the limited power resources available on the Moon and to conduct more modeling and analysis to understand how small and distant quakes can be and still be detectable. The paper is titled \" [Assessing the feasibility of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) for moonquake detection.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2024.118695)\" Zhai is the study's first author. In addition to Zhai and Zhan, co-authors are Research Professor of Geophysics [Allen Husker](https://www.gps.caltech.edu/people/allen-l-husker?back_url=%2Fpeople%3Fcategory%3D29), DAS Scientist Ettore Biondi, former Caltech postdoctoral scholar Jiuxun Yin, former Caltech postdoctoral scholar Francesco Civilini, and Luis Costa of JPL. Funding was provided by the National Science Foundation, the USGS, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and the Braun Trust. Caltech manages JPL for NASA. Distributed Acoustic Sensing: How Does It Work? To use a fiber optic cable as a dense array of seismic sensors, laser emitters are stationed at one end of the cable and shoot beams of light through the long, thin glass strands that make up the cable's core. The glass has tiny imperfections that reflect back a minuscule portion of the light to the source, where it is recorded. In this manner, each imperfection acts as a trackable waypoint along the fiber optic cable, which is typically buried just below ground level. Seismic waves moving through the ground cause the cable to wiggle slightly, which changes the travel time of light to and from these waypoints. Thus, the imperfections along the cable's length act like thousands of individual seismometers that allow seismologists to observe the motion of seismic waves. Utilizing telecommunication fiber optic cables throughout the state of California, for example, could be equivalent to blanketing it with millions of seismometers, enabling researchers to create detailed observations of crustal dynamics anywhere fiber optic cables are nearby.
