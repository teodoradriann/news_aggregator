    "text": "O cofundador e CEO da Meta, Mark Zuckerberg, decidiu defender na rede social Threads a decisão de deixar de contar com ‘fact checkers’ nas redes sociais e também adotar políticas de moderação semelhantes às do X de Elon Musk - nomeadamente as Notas da Comunidade.\nA resposta de Zuckerberg chegou por via de uma publicação da autora (e autoproclamada médium) Mary-Frances Makichen, onde era acusado de estar a aproveitar o facto de ser difícil para as pessoas deixarem tanto o Instagram como a Threads.\n“Ganham dinheiro com a nossa presença para continuarem no mercado e, ainda assim, é muito difícil as pessoas irem embora”, pode ler-se na publicação. “Isto não é um bom ciclo. A Meta é um sistema baseado num ciclo de ‘feedback’ negativo e que continua a reforçar-se a si mesmo”.\nZuckerberg respondeu a esta publicação, afirmando que estas mudanças têm o intuito de melhorar as redes sociais da empresa e que as Notas da Comunidade serão “mais eficazes” do que os ‘fact checkers’ que têm sido usados até então.\nO líder da Meta considera que esta solução ajudará a “reduzir o número de pessoas cujas contas são banidas por engano” e também a garantir que “as pessoas possam discutir tópicos cívicos e falar com argumentos que estejam no discurso político ‘mainstream’”. Mais ainda, Zuckerberg admite que algumas pessoas possam decidir abandonar o Facebook, Instagram e Threads e afirma que, caso o façam, estarão apenas a “sinalizar virtude”.\n“Algumas pessoas podem abandonar as nossas plataformas para sinalizarem a própria virtude, mas penso que a grande maioria e muitos novos utilizadores perceberão que estas mudanças tornam estes produtos melhores”, escreveu Musk.\nVer no Threads\nLeia Também: [Instagram e Threads vão passar a mostrar mais conteúdo político](https://www.noticiasaominuto.com/tech/2703849/instagram-e-threads-vao-passar-a-mostrar-mais-conteudo-politico)",

    "text": "Recommended Stories A few days after season’s first Cyclone Dana battered Odisha after making landfall between Bhitarkanika in Kendrapara and Dhamra in Bhadrak with a wind speed of 110kmph, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday predicted the formation of another cyclonic storm over Bay of Bengal. “Most of the deterministic models are indicating likely formation of an upper air cyclonic circulation over southwest BoB around 5th November with gradual westwards movement towards Tamil Nadu coast till 9th November with no significant intensification,” the IMD said in a press release. It further said, “Considering guidance from various numerical models and environmental features it is inferred that there is likelihood of formation of a trough of low over south BoB during week 1 with formation of a Low Pressure Area over southwest BoB towards the end of week 1. There is also low probability of its intensification into a depression over southwest BoB off Tamil Nadu coast during first half of week 2.\" However, ECMM is indicating moderate (40-60%) probability of formation of depression over south BoB around 7th November. 850 hPa wind field of IMD ERF model is indicating a trough over south BoB during week 1 and an upper air cyclonic circulation over southwest BoB off southeast Sri Lanka coast in the first half of week 2, it continued. \"Cyclogenesis probability forecast based on IMD’s dynamical statistical model indicates 30-40% probability of cyclogenesis over southwest BoB off Tamil Nadu-Sri Lanka coasts/Comorin area during week 1. During week 2, 20-30% (low) probability of cyclogenesis over southwest BoB off Tamil Nadu-Sri Lanka coasts and 30-40% probability of cyclogenesis over southeast BoB & adjoining south Andaman sea,\" it added.",

А экс-замгоссекретарь, госпожа Нуланд, прямо заявила: мы потратили 5 миллиардов долларов и не собираемся больше уходить оттуда. На переворот было истрачено 5 миллиардов долларов!

    "title": "Encrypted app 'built for cops, by cops' based in Las Vegas, but no valley police agencies use it",
    "text": "LAS VEGAS (KTNV) — Since we first reported about Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officers using the encrypted messaging app Signal and setting the messages to automatically delete, many of you reached out with concerns about transparency within our local law enforcement.\nOne man offered a possible solution. His name is Jeff Halstead and he has a wealth of experience in law enforcement.\n\"I started my career at Phoenix Police Department in 1988, served there for over 20 years and rose to the rank of commander,\" said Halstead. \"I got the job as Chief of Police in Fort Worth, Texas in 2008 and served there until January of 2015.\"\nHalstead has since hung up his badge and now resides in Las Vegas.\nHe founded the company Evertel Technologies, which has since been acquired by Genasys. The company launched an encrypted messaging app called Connect, which promises to comply with public records laws.\nHalstead said the idea for the app came from his own experience in law enforcement.\n\"Actually when I was a public information officer for Phoenix PD, we had a horrific line of duty death,\" said Halstead. \"It was really an assassination by the cartel on one of our officers in West Phoenix. And after the funeral, I learned that the intelligence that officer needed was actually being handed out in person by gang intelligence detectives.\"\nLaw enforcement and public officials often use encrypted messaging apps to send sensitive information, believing the method is secure. But as Halstead explains, consumer apps don't offer that level of protection.\n\"Consumer apps were built for people that want to share information and it never be uncovered,\" said Halstead. \"So, migrating to the apps like Signal and GroupMe and WhatsApp are organized criminal syndicates. Drug trafficking, sex trafficking, the cartels use it.\"\nBack in November when we reported on Metro officers using the Signal app, we found proof of their text messages exists only because an officer admitted to taking screenshots.\nThose screenshots proved officers were communicating about arrest tactics. Not only going against public records laws, but making it impossible to recover and use those messages in the court of law.\nHalstead said users on the Connect app can be rest assured their communications follow the Freedom of Information Act.\n\"It was built for cops, by cops,\" said Halstead. \"We wanted a unilateral, non-siloed approach to intelligence distribution. In that model, we wanted to make sure that they owned every keystroke of data, not us as a company.\"\nThat means messages using Connect, even if deleted, are recoverable.\nThe Connect app has a \"retract\" option which Halstead explains, doesn't mean the message is gone.\n\"Here's why we retract messages. We make mistakes. We may send out the wrong address,\" said Halstead. \"But retraction just means it's removed from view, but stored in my account.\"\nThat's the difference between consumer apps and Connect.\nHalstead said currently about 450 agencies in 38 states use the app, including Phoenix Police Department.\nChannel 13 reached out to Metro to see if the department might consider using it as well. A spokesperson said the department has not heard of the app and does not plan on using it.\nHalstead said the use of consumer apps among law enforcement agencies across the country is widespread, but he believes it goes against the foundation of what policing is all about.\n\"This profession has strived to be the most transparent and self-accountable they have ever been in the history of policing in America,\" said Halstead. \"We cannot revert back to having these closed conversations that are secretive and not transparent. Simply cannot do it.\"\nThe cost of the Connect app is 5 dollars per employee, per month. Halstead said there is unlimited data sharing and cloud storage.\nThis year, Halstead said the platform is expanding to support even federal law enforcement.",

    "text": "BEIJING: Former Chinese defence minister Li Shangfu has been expelled from the ruling Communist Party for causing “great damage to (its) cause” through offences including suspected bribery, state media said on Thursday. Li was ousted last October after only seven months in the role following a lengthy absence from public view, one of the most prominent examples in a series of high-level disappearances from China´s military establishment and political class. State broadcaster CCTV said in a separate report on Thursday that Li´s predecessor, Wei Fenghe, had also been expelled from the party and passed on to prosecutors over alleged corruption. Chinese President Xi Jinping has waged an unrelenting campaign against official graft since coming to power more than a decade ago. Proponents say the drive ensures clean governance, but critics argue it also serves as a means for Xi to purge political rivals. The Communist Party´s powerful Politburo of senior leaders ruled on Thursday Li had “betrayed his original mission and lost his party spirit and principles”, according to CCTV. He “seriously polluted the political environment and industrial ethos in the field of military equipment, and caused great damage to the party´s cause, national defence and the construction of the armed forces”, it said. Li is suspected of bribery, accused of abusing his position to take “huge sums of money” in return for favours and of bribing others. He also “illegally sought personnel benefits for himself and others”, CCTV said, adding “the nature (of his offences) is extremely severe, their impact was particularly egregious, and the harm from them was particularly huge”.

The choice is yours. If you want to know the truth about our flat world, watch these videos in order and there will be no turning back.\nhttps://tinyurl.com/FECrashCourse-B\nWe live in a world of lies pushed on us by the upper levels of the world controllers. It is easier to lie to someone than to convince them they have been lied to especially when they are unknowingly addicted to the fear. If the FOUNDATION of your world belief is that you are on a spinning water globe pear rocket flying through an infinite space vacuum, then you will not know WHO you are, WHERE you are and WHAT you truly are. You will be lost and feel insignificant not KNOWING that you are at the center of creation rather than on a speck of dust in an ever expanding universe.\nWith that belief you can be convince of anything. To wake up you MUST start with the foundation of your world and from there you can see beyond the imaginary curve.\nThe FLAT EARTH SUN, MOON & ZODIAC CLOCK app is the best tool for discovering flat earth and introducing it to friends and family. It visually shows how the sky is a perfect clock and brings you the latest google censored flat earth content.\nThe FAQ page will answer all your questions on how and why flat earth is hidden. Got a reason you think Flat Earth is impossible, we have an answer that you haven't thought of yet.\nTake the FE Clock challenge. Watch the featured video every day for 2 weeks and see what happens. Just search \"Flat Earth Clock\" by Blue Water Bay in Google Play or the Apple App Store. It will be the best $2.99 you've ever invested. Avoid the knock off apps on Google Play, they are FREE and still NOT worth the price.
