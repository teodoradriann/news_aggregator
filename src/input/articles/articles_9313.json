    "title": "RSCA: New twist in the Eriksen case",
    "text": "RSC Anderlecht failed to attract a new playmaker during the summer transfer window. The CEO of Sports, however, dreamed of securing the services of Christian Eriksen, but this ultimately proved impossible. The RSCA can, however, hope for a second chance for the Danish star. The first priority of the summer transfer window was to strengthen the defense. It’s done, even if we didn’t spend a lot of money. In midfield, Leander Dendoncker was recovered. Finally, an additional corridor attacker was found in the person of Samuel Edozie. On paper, this is a good list of reinforcements. But the much-desired new playmaker ultimately did not materialize. On a football level, the RSCA started the season in a disappointing way. In recent weeks, the team clearly needed some extra creativity, someone capable of turning the team around. A dream transfer But this player ultimately did not come. “They probably didn’t find the perfect profiles because the main target couldn’t be recruited,” explained owner Marc Coucke via Instagram. With this “main target”, Coucke is in all likelihood pointing towards Eriksen. The Danish international was Fredberg’s dream and Anderlecht also seemed to have the assets to land him. Despite this, his arrival did not materialize. Perhaps due to a combination of sporting and especially financial factors. But Fredberg and his teammates must not despair, a great revenge is possible. Sale in January After all, Eriksen’s contract at United is coming to an end. And there has been no question of an extension for some time. TEAMTalk went further. According to the media outlet, United want to create space in midfield and in the salary budget in January. So they would consider letting Eriksen go for a small fee. The RSCA could then try its luck again, even if the matter remains particularly delicate for the Brussels team.",

    "text": "La noche en ‘Supervivientes 2024’ ha comenzado de lo más intensa. El presentador Jorge Javier Vázquez (53 años) informaba que nada más dar comienzo la gala íbamos a conocer el nombre del primer salvado de la expulsión . Esta no ha sido otra que Arantxa del Sol (51 años), la cual va a continuar en el concurso por el momento. Tanto ha sido así que su marido, Finito de Córdoba (52 años), ha realizado una preciosa declaración de amor. El inicio de la aventura para la asturiana está siendo cuanto menos complejo. El líder de su grupo decidía nominarla por tratarse de la persona con menor afinidad. Además, la presentadora se veía envuelta en alguna que otra polémica , ya que sus compañeros la tachan de no interferir en las decisiones y no posicionarse en los conflictos que están teniendo lugar en estos primeros días de convivencia. Finito de Córdoba defiende a Arantxa del Sol en ‘Supervivientes 2024’ El debate que está teniendo lugar en la isla se ha trasladado al plató de Telecinco, donde algunos de los colaboradores han querido hablar sobre ello. Sin embargo, el defensor de la presentadora en el plató ha querido hablar de ello y defender a su mujer tras el vídeo donde los compañeros critican su actitud. De hecho, el torero considera que es el principal motivo por el que ha sido nominada. “ No dejan de presionarla porque se posicione . Lo que pase entre ellos dos es cosa de ellos no, ella no tiene porqué entrar en el conflicto”, exponía el andaluz. Además, hacía referencia al conflicto que tienen los compañeros con Ángel Cristo Jr, algo por lo cual Arantxa no ha querido entrar a debatir, tal y como demostró cuando fue preguntada directamente por el tema en cuestión. Finito de Córdoba se declara a Arantxa del Sol en ‘Supervivientes 2024’ Tras ello ha sido el presentador de la gala el que ha querido conocer los sentimientos del diestro, algo que Finito no ha dudado en responder. “Siempre el que solía marcharse temporadas largas a América era yo y ahora es ella. Es increíble el vacío que encuentro al llegar a casa ”, manifestaba. A este respecto, Jorge Javier le preguntaba al torero si lloraba. “Yo sí, yo soy un hombre que lloro”, respondía el torero sin ningún tipo de pudor. De esta manera, el torero se deshacía en halagos hacia su mujer , demostrando que la echa mucho de menos y que está notando su ausencia. Tras ello, el presentador de la gala ha querido hablar de la profesión de Finito de Córdoba, manteniendo un debate sobre la felicidad que tiene porque esté en el plató defendiendo a su mujer y no realizando su labor profesional. Por otro lado, ha sido la propia Arantxa la que también ha revelado algunos detalles de su vida sentimental y de la importancia que tiene el diestro en su vida. “Divertirte mucho, estar unidos en los problemas cuando vienen y ser muy cómplices en todo ” decía con relación a la clave de su matrimonio para llevar tantos años juntos. Por tanto, los dos se hacen declaraciones de amor mutuas, algo que denota el buen momento sentimental por el que están atravesando.",

    "text": "Latest Weather Blog LA GATOR bill facing opposition from some parish school boards LIVINGSTON PARISH - On day one of the legislative session, Governor Jeff Landry insisted he would put parents' choice first in their child's education track. Now, two bills allowing parents to send their children to private school with taxpayer money are moving through the capitol. Sen. Rick Edmonds (R) says his bill aims to give parents access to higher performing private schools, but education leaders worry it could cost public schools millions. \"We want parents to be making the choice for their children,\" Edmonds said. The bill creates the [LA GATOR program.](https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=24RS&b=SB313&sbi=y) It's an education savings account or ESA for parents to put $5,100 to $15,000 per year towards tuition or other education expenses. Over time, every student in Louisiana would become eligible. Edmonds says the change would push Louisiana from the nation’s worst state in education. \"For years we've been in 47th, 48th, 49, and that's just not acceptable,\" Edmonds said. Critics like Dannie Garrett, executive counsel for the Louisiana School Boards Association, worries money will be pulled away from public schools in need of help. Trending News \"This proposal doesn't actually make any public schools better, and we think that really ought to be the focus,\" Garrett said. A voucher program which allows low income students to attend higher rated schools already exists. LA GATOR would replace the existing program. Garrett says the average score for schools in the existing voucher program is a 52, just above an \"F\", whereas the average score for school districts in Louisiana is 78.5, a \"B\". Unlike the existing voucher program, if the bill passes students accepted to the private schools will not be required to take the same standardized tests as public school students. \"Which means we won't be able to know if our dollars are being well spent,\" Garrett said. That's part of the reason school boards across the state have came out opposed to the bill, but lawmaker Rick Edmonds says the choice should remain with the parents.

    "title": "Are the Pope’s allies funding people smugglers in Africa? - The Spectator World",
    "text": "Some of Pope Francis’s closest allies in the Catholic Church are alleged to have secretly given more than €2 million to an Italian migrant rescue charity whose senior staff are charged with people smuggling. They include Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, archbishop of Bologna, who is among other things the papal peace envoy to Ukraine, and Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich, archbishop of Luxembourg. These senior figures in the Church organized payment of the money, it is claimed, at the bequest of the Pope who had established a special rapport with the far-left founder of the charity. The payments were kept secret for fear of adverse publicity. The disclosure has been made in internet chatroom conversations between members of the charity’s staff, recorded on the orders of prosecuting magistrates in the Sicilian city of Ragusa, as well as in seized documents. Transcripts of the intercepted conversations and copies of the documents were subsequently leaked to the Italian weekly, [Panorama](https://www.panorama.it/news/cosi-i-vescovi-finanziano-casarini-esclusivo-migranti-panorama-in-edicola), which has since published them. The Church allegedly continued to make the payments, which began in August 2020, even after the news in March 2021 that the Ragusa magistrates had placed senior staff at the charity, Mediterranea Saving Humans, and the company that owns its rescue vessel Mare Jonio under formal investigation for people smuggling. On Wednesday December 20, the Pope [responded ](https://www.ansa.it/vaticano/notizie/2023/12/20/ansa-box-il-papa-loda-e-incoraggia-casarini-tornate-in-mare_3f0fa597-b3e8-4a2b-99cf-90e12f04538c.html)to the media storm the Panorama story has unleashed in Italy with a remarkable show of defiance. Luca Casarini, the founder of Mediterranea, was joined by his colleagues in the crowd at the Pope’s final weekly general audience before Christmas at the Vatican. The Pope did not mention the money the Church has given Mediterranea but at the end of his speech on the significance of the nativity scene he singled out the charity for a special mention. He added: “I also salute the group from Mediterranea Saving Humans, who are present, and who go to sea to save the poor people who are fleeing slavery in Africa. They do great work: they save so many people.” After the audience, Casarini went on stage to shake the Pope’s hand. That is not exactly true. This year its rescue vessel Mare Jonio has [carried out ](https://mediterranearescue.org/it/missioni/mediterraneo-14)just two rescue missions both in the same week in October. Regardless of the Mare Jonio’s inactivity, the Church has given the charity, it is claimed, about €1 million in 2023 — four times the sum paid in 2021. Much of the money is said to have come from donations given by the faithful at Mass, or to their dioceses, or else directly to Peter’s Pence — the Pope’s fund for worthy causes. Casarini and five others are charged with using Mare Jonio to bring twenty-seven illegal migrants to Italy in September 2020 in return for €125,000 ($138,000). The money was paid to them by the Danish owners of a merchant ship that had rescued the migrants and then handed them over to Mare Jonio. In an [intercepted conversation](https://www.ilgazzettino.it/nordest/padova/mediterranea_luca_casarini_intercettazioni-5862979.html) just before the deal was struck, Casarini tells colleagues: “This time tomorrow we can break out the Champagne because we’ll have the reply from the Danes.” That the payment was made is not in dispute — but the accused say it was to cover expenses. The opening hearing of the case was due to take place earlier this month but has been adjourned until February. It was only thanks to the Ragusa people smuggling investigation that details of the payments by the Church to Mediterranea came to light. But the payments are not being treated as penally relevant — at the moment. They are nevertheless deeply embarrassing for the Pope, as well as the cardinals and the dozen or so archbishops involved. It was only thanks to the Ragusa people smuggling investigation that details of the payments by the Church to Mediterranea came to light. Casarini, fifty-six, is a former leader of violent protests against global capitalism. He has an impressive criminal record as he [proudly posted](https://www.giornalettismo.com/luca-casarini-reati/) online in 2016. Until recently, he was a strident atheist or “mangiaprete” (priest-eater) as the Italians call them. But in 2019 — one year after founding Mediterranea — Casarini miraculously found God and installed a chaplain on board the Mare Jonio, don Mattia Ferrari. The ship’s chaplain used his contacts to get Casarini a vital audience with Pope Francis in December 2019 at the Vatican. He presented the Pope with a life jacket nailed to a cross which is now on display at the Apostolic Palace. Casarini then wrote the Pope a [letter](https://www.avvenire.it/attualita/pagine/papa-francesco-scrive-a-mediterranea) in April 2020, published in the bishops’s daily, Avvenire, full of passionate talk about his efforts to save migrants in the Mediterranean to which the Pope replied in the same newspaper: “Luca, dear brother… Thank you for all that you are doing… You can count on me.” This October, Casarini was one of just three special lay guests invited by the Pope to participate in the latest session of his cherished Synod of Bishops, of which Cardinal Hollerich is Relator General. There are [many references ](https://www.dagospia.com/rubrica-29/cronache/ldquo-papa-non-sapeva-soldi-rdquo-scandalo-milioni-376492.htm)to the Pope’s involvement in the operation to give money to Mediterranea in the internet chatroom intercepts. Of Casarini’s audience with the Pope, the chaplain don Mattia who was also present reportedly tells the others that “the Catholic Church is becoming our Soros” and “I am still recovering from the effort that I made to find the balls to tell the Pope to hand over the money.” He’s also quoted as reminding the group: “Don’t forget that at the private audience… Pope Francis openly said that he would support Mediterranea.” In a telephone conversation, recorded by don Mattia and posted in the chatroom, Cardinal Zuppi tells him that Cardinal Konrad Krajewskij, Papal Almoner in charge of dispensing charity money on behalf of the Pope such as that from Peter’s Pence, is doubtful about donating to Mediterranea. “We must find a way to convince Krajewskij. He needs to receive the mandate directly from the Pope,” Cardinal Zuppi, who is considered Papabile (a possible future Pope), reportedly tells don Mattia. Casarini was only able to launch Mediterranea in 2018 thanks to a [€460,000 overdraft](https://www.dagospia.com/rubrica-29/cronache/fare-buoni-soldi-altri-ndash-banca-etica-ha-dato-460mila-198913.htm) facility granted by the Banca Etica that was guaranteed by a number of left-wing and far left Members of Parliament. But he soon ran out of money. That Pope Francis should want the Church to back NGOs that bring migrants across the Mediterranean to Europe is hardly surprising — however fast and loose they and their rescue boats play with the law. This September, for instance, the Pope was in Marseille to attend an international [meeting](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/pope-faces-down-growing-backlash-against-migrants-in-europe-390ad042) on the migrant crisis where, during a ceremony at the city’s memorial to migrants who have died at sea, he said that they “must be saved” because it is “a duty of humanity.” Casarini was present and embraced the Pope who was in his wheel-chair before kneeling in front of him. This was just days after the tiny Italian island of [Lampedusa](https://thespectator.com/topic/among-migrants-islanders-lampedusa-gateway-europe/) was [overwhelmed](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/italy-cant-prevent-the-migrant-crisis-alone/) by the arrival of 12,000 migrants in less than a week. But to back someone like Casarini would surely be just asking for trouble. I [discover](https://mediterranearescue.org/it/missioni/filtro:Mare)ed that Mare Jonio has only done five rescue operations in the three and a bit years that it has received the backing of the Church. They include the mission in 2020 that led to the people smuggling charges. That the Church has given hundreds of thousands of euros to Mediterranea cannot be denied as the charity’s own accounts, [published ](https://mediterranearescue.org/it/bilancio)on its website, reveal that “enti ecclesiastici” (ecclesistrical bodies) gave it an unspecified sum in 2020, €219,000 in 2021 and €275,736 in 2022. The only dispute is over how many hundreds of thousands it was and who authorized it. In a [brief statement](https://www.famigliacristiana.it/articolo/la-cei-e-il-caso-mediterranea-nessun-finanziamento-diretto-a-mediterranea-solo-400mila-a-due-diocesi-impegnate-nellaccoglienza.aspx), the Italian Episcopal Conference (IEC) – of which Cardinal Zuppi is president — admitted that the Catholic Church had given money to Mediterranea. But the IEC denied that it has been “directly” involved in doing so, though it had “agreed” requests to give money to the charity from “two dioceses” which it declined to name. These had given the charity €100,000 each, it added, “in 2022 and likewise in 2023.” It described the intercepted chat-room conversations as “defamatory” of “ecclesiastical people and institutions.” But that hasn’t stopped the story buzzing around the Italian media in recent days.

    "text": "Uno de los productos clave para la construcción en España, en peligro por el conflicto del mar Rojo Las grandes navieras van a aplicar una subida de entre el 30% y el 40% en los precios de los portes. Graves problemas en la exportación española de pizarra. El [conflicto en el mar Rojo](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/global/los-huties-reclaman-autoria-ataque-directo-buque-britanico-golfo-aden.html) está provocando que los envíos del producto queden retenidos y, además, que se encarezcan los portes a Asia. Así lo ha señalado el presidente de la Asociación de Pizarristas de Castilla y León (APICAL), Eliseo López, en declaraciones a la [Cadena SER](https://cadenaser.com/castillayleon/2024/01/31/el-conflicto-del-mar-rojo-y-la-huelga-francesa-complican-las-exportaciones-de-pizarra-radio-bierzo/). Según informa el responsable de la patronal, las grandes navieras les han comunicado que van a aplicar una subida de entre el 30% y el 40% en los precios. La medida no solo afectará a los envíos que crucen el canal de Suez, sino también a “los fletes convencionales destinados a los Estados Unidos”. Para Eliseo López, se trata de algo sorprendente teniendo en cuenta que esos portes al país norteamericano “no están afectados directamente por el conflicto”. En ese sentido, el presidente de APICAL subraya que la patronal va a trabajar junto a los organismos competentes y a las administraciones para tratar de frenar una postura de las navieras que “carece de sentido”. López lamenta que este considerable encarecimiento de los fletes de pizarra tanto a Asia como a Estados Unidos “va a complicar la situación de las empresas porque son sobrecostes en el transporte inesperados y sin previsión”.",

    "text": "Quejas por colas de más de media hora para bañarse\nLargas esperas de los usuarios para sacar el ticket o el abono a casi 40 grados\nSalamanca\nJueves, 3 de julio 2025, 07:00\nLa amenaza de tormenta de estas últimas tardes no ha impedido que cientos de salmantinos hayan acudido a las piscinas municipales de la capital para intentar paliar el sofocante calor del que Salamanca no ha quedado al margen.\nEs el caso de Rosa Colorado, el recinto de tres vasos situado en la Avenida de la Merced, donde los bañistas se han acercado estas tórridas jornadas para darse un chapuzón.\nPero antes de refrescarse, había que pagar el precio de esperar media hora en una cola de varios metros en la que se juntaban las personas que querían una entrada y aquellas que iban a hacerse el abono, lo que retrasaba el momento de llegar al agua.\n«El martes había una cola de media hora con gente esperando a 40 grados al sol», señalaba Tomás Hernández, un bañista habitual que acudía ayer a pasar una tarde en familia.\nLos usuarios explicaban que, a media tarde, la cola llegó a extenderse incluso escaleras abajo , por lo que la línea de personas que esperaba frente a la taquilla de la entrada de la piscina municipal fue de varias decenas de metros.\nUna taquilla en la que se encuentra solo un trabajador, lo que parece ser el motivo principal de esta ralentización en el servicio para acceder al recinto.\nAunque esta situación puede parecer puntual al haberse unido las altas temperaturas con el inicio del verano, período en el que los usuarios asiduos a las instalaciones acuden para obtener su abono para la temporada estival, lo cierto es que hay quejas también por la falta de personal para supervisar los tres vasos.\nY es que según el testimonio de otros usuarios que acudían ayer a Rosa Colorado, cuando hay algún tipo de altercado en el recinto, es uno de los dos socorristas disponibles quien se encarga de controlar la situación, y solo en algunas ocasiones aparece una patrulla de la Policía Local a calmar los ánimos.\nDe este modo, desatienden su verdadera ocupación: vigilar a las personas que se encuentran dentro del agua. Esto se une al descontento por el agua turbia cuando la afluencia de bañistas es mayor o el mobiliario antiguo.\nEn LA GACETA DE SALAMANCA, tu opinión nos importa. ¿Quieres opinar sobre esta noticia?
