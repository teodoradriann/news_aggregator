    "title": "Temple police officer turns drone hobby into on-duty job, program",
    "text": "Matt Wittman dreamed of being a pilot. The 16-year Temple Police Department veteran fulfilled that dream a few years ago. He doesn’t even leave the ground when performing his pilot duties. Wittman is a certified drone pilot. He has helped Temple Police start a drone program. “I’ve always had an interest in flying,” Wittman said. “My goal in life was to be a pilot and I wanted to go to pilot school, but I realized that it was too expensive. The next best thing was to fly things through remote control.” Wittman, a father of three, said he always wanted a remote control helicopter. He received a drone for Christmas one year that had a short life before he received a drone with more quality. “I finally convinced some ‘higher-ups’ in the household to get me a drone for Fathers Day, and I’ve been flying it ever since,” Wittman said. “I love being able to see things from the sky.” Wittman said he has flown drones since 2019. He has a YouTube channel called Machine Gun Droner. The link to his YouTube channel is [http://www.youtube.com/](http://www.youtube.com/)@machinegundroner9411. Shortly after Wittman started this channel, Temple Police took interest. “I personally didn’t have to convince the department to start using drones,” Wittman said. “In the process of getting this program started, they finally realized that I had a YouTube channel for flying drones, so they wanted me to start flying them for the PD.” Eventually, flying drones evolved into a position, Wittman said. It was also decided Temple Police needed more than just one drone pilot within the department. “I put together a training protocol to train more drone pilots,” Wittman said. “In my first class, we had 10 people spread across the Temple Police and Fire & Rescue departments. It was a lot of fun.” Wittman said there are 10 certified drone pilots in the Temple Police Department. Temple Fire & Rescue has two certified drone pilots. Wittman said drones have plenty of benefits in police work. “We get closer to dangerous situations without endangering the officers,” Wittman said. “It also makes us reach a lot of places in quicker amounts of time for search and rescue situations. Instead of spending hours walking the trails, we put the drone up and get a bird’s eye view.” Wittman believes drones help save lives. He does not condone the use of drones as weapons. “We’re in the business of saving lives. The last thing we want to do is take lives,” Wittman said. “I don’t agree with using drones as weapons in any way, form or fashion.” Drones are commonly known as unmanned aerial vehicles. However, Wittman said the term can apply to any vehicle that is unmanned and remote-control operated. Wittman believes drones will help revolutionize law enforcement. He mentioned that some police forces, such as the Arlington, Burlington, N.C., and Fremont, Calif., police departments, already use drones as emergency responders. Another example of drones being used in police work is the Bee Cave Police Department, southwest of Austin. Bee Cave Police have AV8 drones across their jurisdiction that wait for orders to dispatch to a scene. “If you get a 911 call for shots fired or a disturbance or something of that nature, they’ll send a drone out to that location to scout the area,” Wittman said. “By doing that, it can either prevent officers from going into a dangerous situation or it can say there’s nothing there and no need to send anybody there.”",

Stay off of jetties, piers, and other waterside infrastructure,’ urged the NWS.\nAdditionally, in Aptos on the north end of Monterey Bay, surf overran the beach on Thursday and swept into a parking lot, leaving the area strewn with debris.\n‘Mother Nature’s angry,’ said Eve Krammer, an Aptos resident for several years. ‘I mean these waves are gnarly. They’re huge.’\n‘I feel for the people that are down low here,’ added Jeff Howard, another Aptod resident.\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com",
