    "text": "Virat Kohli flops on Ranji Trophy return - WATCH\nVirat Kohli’s much-anticipated return to red-ball domestic cricket after more than 12 years ended in disappointment as he was dismissed for just six runs in Delhi’s\nRanji Trophymatch against Railways at the\nArun Jaitley Stadiumon Friday. Kohli walked in to bat at No. 4 on the second day of the match, with thousands of fans braving the chilly morning to witness the modern-day great in action. However, his stay at the crease was short-lived, lasting only 15 balls before he was clean-bowled by Railways pacer\nHimanshu Sangwanin the 28th over.\nGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.\nSUBSCRIBE NOW!\nWATCH:\nA visibly disappointed Kohli walked back as some fans, equally dejected, exited the stands prematurely. Delhi, who had started steadily, were reduced to 86 for 3 in 27.4 overs following his dismissal.\nEarlier on Day 1, Railways posted 241 in their first innings, with wicketkeeper-batter\nUpendra Yadavanchoring the innings with a fighting 95 off 177 balls, including 10 fours and a six. Delhi’s bowlers had done well to restrict Railways, but their batting lineup now faced a stern test.\nKohli’s return to domestic cricket was expected to be a boost for Delhi, but his early exit came as a major disappointment.

    "text": "As much as hockey and ice rinks seem to go hand-in-hand, it is a liability when Canada’s game is played on Penticton’s outdoor ice rink, says the volunteer group Activate Penticton who operate the facility. “I hate to be the Hockey Grinch, but the Penticton outdoor rink is not the right place for hockey and the repeat offenders who keep coming to play there are making us consider shutting it down,” said Drew Barnes, president of Activate Penticton. The volunteers at Activate Penticton said they are getting close to melting the ice and closing the rink down after parents, kids and many adults continued to break the rules over the Christmas break and play hockey on the outdoor rink situated beside Gyro Park. This comes after Activate Penticton issued a warning on Dec. 20, saying that hockey is not allowed on the rink except for private booking from 8 a.m. to noon each day. If the stick and puck continued they would consider closing the rink. The issue is liability, said Barnes. “The rink was built for public skating. It doesn’t have enough netting or glass for hockey and it’s a liability issue for us,” said Barnes. “We all love hockey but this isn’t the right place.” Barnes said he was at the rink at least 10 times over Christmas break and the ice was ‘dominated’ by hockey. “There are repeat hockey players that come that are very disrespectful. Even parents who are being aggressive. Our volunteers don’t feel safe enforcing the rules. This isn’t a city-owned facility so bylaws can’t issue tickets. We can’t issue tickets. We have no way to enforce the rules except to ask people to not play hockey,” said Barnes. “Sadly, we are getting close to shutting it down. It’s the last thing we want to do.” Barnes said they are getting calls and emails from people saying they came there to skate or take their grandchild or child skating but the ice was taken up by hockey. Activate Penticton will not consider setting aside times just for hockey during public skate hours. Barnes said that wasn’t an option and that wasn’t the intended use of the rink. Barnes and all of Activate Penticton are begging hockey players to stay off the ice or make a private booking or else their actions will ruin it for everyone.

    "text": "Following the arrest of its CEO Pavel Durov in August 2024, Telegram has significantly increased its sharing of user data with law enforcement. This move comes amid ongoing investigations into criminal activities facilitated through the platform.\nTelegram’s data sharing with law enforcement spikes after CEO’s arrest Researchers have reported a dramatic increase in government requests for user data from Telegram, particularly in the last quarter of 2024. Data collected illustrates a steep rise, with a 6,000% increase in requests in the United States, where Telegram fulfilled 900 requests affecting over 2,200 users. Until September 2024, Telegram had only responded to 14 requests in the U.S., sharing information of 108 users.\nIn the United Kingdom, government requests surged from 3 between Q1 and Q3 to 139 in Q4, representing an increase of over 4,500%. India’s data requests peaked at 14,641 for the year, impacting 23,535 users, with 7,649 requests filed in Q4 alone. The first three quarters of 2024 each saw around 2,000 requests in India.\nThe increase in data sharing follows a change in Telegram’s privacy policy announced in September 2024. The revised policy permits the disclosure of user phone numbers and IP addresses if they are suspects in criminal activities violating Telegram’s Terms of Service. This decision came in the wake of Durov’s arrest, which stemmed from his alleged complicity in enabling organized crime and other charges, including refusal to assist lawful interceptions for investigations.\n“If Telegram receives a valid order from the relevant judicial authorities that confirms you’re a suspect in a case involving criminal activities that violate the Telegram Terms of Service, we will perform a legal analysis of the request and may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities,” the updated policy states.\nFollowing Durov’s arrest, Telegram attempted to distance itself from cybercrime activities by adopting stricter compliance measures. While some cybercrime groups announced their exit from the platform, intelligence firm KELA noted that the overall cybercrime landscape on Telegram has remained largely unchanged as of December 2024.\nData reveals approximately 2,000 users across the United States, Germany, and France have been targeted by law enforcement. Several hundred users were also affected in the United Kingdom, Spain, Belgium, and the Netherlands.\nTelegram provides a ‘Transparency Reports’ bot that shares user-specific data regarding law enforcement requests for IP and phone numbers and the number of affected users by country. The company plans to publish its annual Digital Services Act (DSA) transparency report for 2024 later this month. The DSA aims to address illegal and harmful activities online.\nResearchers associated with Human Rights Watch have initiated a crowdsourced project to track and share Telegram’s user data handling on a public GitHub page . This effort aims to shed further light on the platform’s engagement with law enforcement and the degree of privacy being offered to users amidst these changes.",

    "text": "More monster waves will collide with the California coast after injuring onlookers and causing serious flooding CNN, KCAL, KCBS By Elizabeth Wolfe, Robert Shackelford, Mary Gilbert and Cindy Von Quednow, CNN (CNN) — A series of powerful storms in the Pacific Ocean are [driving towering waves](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/28/weather/high-surf-ventura-san-diego/index.html) into the California coastline, triggering flooding and posing a significant risk to people and structures along the coast. Monstrous, 20-foot-plus waves on Thursday crashed over seawalls and swept away and injured several people, forced rescues and sent a damaging surge of water through coastal California streets. A brief dip in wave heights may occur in some locations along the California coast during the daytime Friday as one storm pushes ashore, but the danger will quickly ramp back up later Friday and Saturday as another system develops behind it. “Overall, this is expected to be an exceptional high-surf and coastal flooding event that has not occurred in many years,” the weather service in Los Angeles warned. [Sea levels have risen](https://oehha.ca.gov/climate-change/epic-2022/impacts-physical-systems/sea-level-rise#:~:text=*%20Sea%20levels%20have%20increased%20over%20the,about%200.8%20mm%20or%200.03%E2%80%B3%20each%20year) along most of the California coastline over the past century, NOAA data shows, as global temperature climbs and melts glaciers and ice sheets. Higher sea levels are making [coastal flooding events worse](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/02/us/sea-level-rise-impact-california-climate/index.html) and will continue to do so in the future. Waves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen- to 20-foot waves are expected along the central and Southern California coasts through Saturday evening. The first round of dangerous waves hit alongside high tide Thursday morning. Several people were injured by a huge wave that slammed into Ventura Beach. The wave crashed over a barrier along the Southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away. Nearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said. High water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the US-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said. The dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said. The dangerous wave risk will lessen on Saturday for Northern California, but continue in southern Oregon and rival Thursday’s impact in Southern California. The Ventura County coast, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches face the most extreme surf and are at risk for significant coastal flooding. One of the storms helping to drive the waves will also bring rain and wind to California through Saturday. High wind alerts are in effect for California’s central coast and the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected. These strong wind gusts will churn up waters even further. The spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby. “Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned. At least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard Thursday and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said. The conditions caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities Thursday and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast. Crews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about 7 feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities. Hoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution. In central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office [issued ](https://www.facebook.com/SantaCruzSheriffsOffice/)an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, which included areas of Rio Del Mar, where seawater filled beachside roadways and pushed against some homes, CNN affiliate KION reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day. Massive waves attract surfers to Mavericks Despite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco. Pro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having [some of the biggest waves](https://www.visithalfmoonbay.org/articles/mavericks-biggest-surf-west-coast) in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Local resident Ion Banner [told the affiliate](https://abc7news.com/mavericks-surf-ca-storm-waves-at-today-weather-half-moon-bay/14235785/) that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said. “The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.” Mavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells. The legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen. On Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco. “If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.” CNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.

    "text": "On les imagine bons pour la santé, et pourtant ces aliments sont bourrés de sucres, les voici\nDans notre quête perpétuelle d’une alimentation saine, nous avons cette tendance à nous tourner vers des produits ou des aliments étiquetés comme naturels ou sains. Cependant, parmi ces aliments, certains sont trompeurs, car ils cachent des quantités importantes de sucres ajoutés. Selon Alexandra Murcier, diététicienne-nutritionniste, voici 10 aliments couramment perçus comme sans risques, mais qui, en réalité, peuvent contenir plus de sucre que vous ne l’imaginez. Rappelons que la consommation excessive des aliments contenant des sucres ajoutés fait partie des mauvaises habitudes qui accélèrent le vieillissement.\nCes aliments qu’on pense bons pour la santé qu’il faut éviter\nLe maïs n’est pas un légume\nContrairement à ce que disent de nombreuses personnes, le maïs n’est pas un légume. Selon la spécialiste Alexandra Murcier, nombreux sont ceux qui considèrent le maïs comme un légume. La diététicienne explique que \"C’est en réalité un féculent qui est de plus riche en sucres. C’est pourquoi les produits sans gluten, qui ont pour base le maïs, sont également très sucrés\". Elle recommande donc des céréales comme le sarrasin, le quinoa ou encore le riz.\nLe coulis de tomates\nAutre aliment qu’on pense sain, pourtant rempli de sucre : les sauces tomate vendues dans les supermarchés. D’après Alexandra Murcier, \"C’est en raison de l’ajout de sucre pour casser l’acidité de ces sauces\". Pour limiter la consommation de sucre, l’experte conseille de bien lire les étiquettes ou de réaliser soi-même sa sauce tomate. Elle recommande aussi de limiter les sauces de type barbecue ou ketchup, l’un des aliments industriels contenant plus de sucres cachés.\nLes plats préparés et le vinaigre balsamique\nPour ne pas avoir à préparer régulièrement ou pour gagner du temps, certains optent pour les plats préparés, car pour eux c’est la solution de facilité. \"En plus des additifs et autres conservateurs qu’ils peuvent contenir, les plats préparés sont également riches en sucres, donc à éviter autant que possible\", explique la spécialiste. Alexandra conseille de remplacer le vinaigre balsamique par le vinaigre de cidre ou de vin, car beaucoup l’ignorent, mais le velours balsamique et le vinaigre balsamique contiennent une grande quantité de sucres.\nLe pain de mie et les yaourts hyperprotéinés\nLe marché propose une très grande variété de pain de mie. Selon Alexandra Murcier, \"C’est un produit transformé et sucré, il est préférable de manger du pain complet à la place\". D’un autre côté, nous avons les yaourts hyperprotéinés qui sont également très riches en sucres. \"Ils contiennent également des additifs qu’il vaut mieux éviter, à la place, mieux vaut privilégier le Skyr ou du fromage blanc, tout simplement\", affirme l’experte. Si vous aimez les petites douceurs, vous pouvez opter pour des pâtisseries moins caloriques.\nLe riz à sushi\nAlexandra Murcier, diététicienne et nutritionniste libérale, révèle que le riz à sushi est un aliment piège parce que plusieurs personnes pensent que les sushis sont sains. Elle explique que \"En réalité, ils contiennent un riz très sucré, donc pour équilibrer son assiette, mieux vaut aussi manger des sashimis, plus riches en poissons comme le thon ou le saumon, mais sans en abuser non plus car ils sont riches en métaux lourds\".\nLes galettes de riz\nCelles-ci, comme le pain de mie, sont à écarter de l’alimentation. En effet, d’après la spécialiste, \"Elles ont un index glycémique très élevé, elles font donc grimper le taux de sucre de manière très importante dans le sang, une fois consommées\". Si vous avez l’habitude de les manger au goûter, vous pouvez les remplacer par une poignée d’oléagineux. L’experte assure que les oléagineux auront de nombreux avantages, rapporte Doctissimo.\nLes mueslis\nLorsqu’il est temps de prendre son petit-déjeuner, certaines personnes préfèrent un bol de mueslis, pensant opter pour un aliment sain. \"Il faut surtout faire attention à ce qui accompagne les céréales. Les fruits séchés comme les raisins secs ou les abricots secs vont alourdir le produit en sucres, mieux vaut partir sur un muesli aux noix ou aux noisettes, les oléagineux étant une meilleure alternative\", recommande Alexandra Murcier.\nLe lait d’avoine\nDe tous les laits végétaux, le lait d’avoine est le plus sucré et peu sont ceux qui le savent. De façon inconsciente, on l’associe aux flocons d’avoine, qui par contre, sont très bons pour la santé. Pour la spécialiste, si vous aimez les laits végétaux, privilégiez le lait d’amande ou de soja, car ils contiennent une faible quantité de sucre.",
