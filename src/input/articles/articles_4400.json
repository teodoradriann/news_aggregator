    "text": "[according](https://www.kold.com/2024/12/16/13-news-remembers-ana-orsini/)to a news report by the station on Dec. 16.\nCo-anchors Tyler Butler and Carsyn Currier announced her death during a Monday broadcast wearing pink to honor her and shared a video compilation of the fellow newscasters’ “favorite moments” of Orsini with viewers.\n“Ana had been at 13 News since June 2023 and we are devastated by her unexpected passing,” KOLD 13 wrote on the station’s website.\nOrsini’s colleagues remember her in the report as “someone with bottomless empathy who always stood up for ’the little guy.'”\n“She was a smiling face most especially for all her newest and youngest coworkers, and she is known in all the newsrooms where she worked for taking them under her wing and being a strong mentor for both work and life,” the station wrote.\n“Rescue animals were her passion, and if she wasn’t celebrating Fur Baby Friday, she'd be trying to find a new home for a cutie in need. She was a peanut-butter-M&M-loving, platform-Ugg-wearing, pink-or-purple-Stanley-toting ray of sunshine, even at 4:00 in the morning.”\n[According](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16800-brain-aneurysm)to the Cleveland Clinic, a brain aneurysm is a bulge in a weak area of a blood vessel in or around your brain that can be life-threatening if ruptured.\nOrsini, born in Denver, Colorado, started her professional career in 2018 after graduating from Texas A&M University in College Station with a degree in journalism and a double minor in communication and sports management, her bio at the station stated.\nShe worked as an anchor and reporter at an unnamed station in Lubbock, Texas, covering topics including “Texas Tech basketball to a months-long investigative series on a bridal shop scam,” according to her bio.\n[former workplace](https://www.kdrv.com/news/newswatch-12-remembers-ana-orsini/article_666f5330-bbc2-11ef-94e1-6b1dc31bd908.html)NewsWatch 12, where she spent three years as a morning and midday anchor covering topics from wildfires to helping shelter pets find their forever homes, described her as a “force to be reckoned with.”\n“She was courageous, and fearless, and knew how to lead a newsroom with a look alone,” Ashe Hajek, former NewsWatch 12 “This Morning” producer, wrote in a news report from NewsWatch 12. “Ana was one of the most compassionate people I have ever met, and that can be felt in every aspect of her life. She led with a truthful heart full of love for people in her newsroom, in her community, and for people, she hadn’t met yet.”\n[shared](https://www.facebook.com/tylerbutlernews/posts/pfbid0wBnHkUVzx2bPQogpCidQw7MWEySywFVXrcnRv67XQtL5sp9qRt1BxHyEzLzhrKnwl?rdid=doja6BP4pf6KOhrE#)a Facebook post on Monday remembering Orsini as someone who was “crazy passionate about helping animals” with a “great and sarcastic sense of humor, and was so dedicated to her family.”\n[wrote](https://www.facebook.com/DanMarries/posts/pfbid02c4eHPRnvg1Sh2sCBS35PNExARFPFxzV4uyopKbu5fWSK6NM6cya9u19KpP9Y78xTl)in a post on Facebook.\n“Our thoughts and prayers are with the Orsini family during this incredibly tragic time. As a parent, I can’t even begin to imagine their pain and anguish with the sudden, unexpected, and tragic loss of Ana. Her positive impact on those around her will last a lifetime. Ana, you are, and will, be missed so much.”\n[wrote](https://x.com/cory_kowitz/status/1868685445623623735)on X that Orsini was “our anchor, a leader of the morning team, and most importantly a great friend to so many at the station.”\n“I had the pleasure of working with her during the morning show, even though it was for too short of a time,” he said.\nOrsini’s family told KOLD 13 News that they want her to be remembered “for the bright, sunny person she was.”\nHer family asked people who want to honor Orsini’s memory to “please donate to your local animal shelter — Ana never met a dog she didn’t love!”",

    "text": "Karnataka Congress slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for opposing ‘The Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Bill 2024’ which was passed in the state assembly on Thursday, and called the BJP an actual ‘anti-Hindu’ party. The congress ministers stressed that the new bill will benefit small temples and poor priests.Also Read - Karnataka Legislative Council passes FAR Amendment Bill amid boycott by BJPSpeaking to reporters, Karnataka Muzrai minister Ramalinga Reddy said, “When they made amendments in 2011, they did not give any money for Dharmika Prishad. There were 34,000 temples at that time, which were generating up to ₹5 lakh revenue. There were about 193 'B grade' temples that were generating revenue of ₹5L to ₹10L, which were supposed to give 5%. More than ₹10 Lakhs, there were about 205 temples. They approved this amendment when they were in power. BJP is actually an ‘anti Hindu’ party. We are trying to develop the temples and uplift poor priests.”The latest amendment proposes the establishment of a ‘Common Pool Fund’ under the Hindu religious institutions and charitable endowments department, enabling the government to collect taxes from temples based on their revenues. As per the bill, the government will levy a 10% tax on temples with revenues exceeding ₹1 crore, and a 5% tax on those generating revenues between ₹10 lakh and ₹1 crore.Another minister Dinesh Gundu Rao also said that the Congress is working to the benefit of Hindu temples. “The new tax slabs will help the smaller temples to get financial aid which will ultimately be used for their benefits. This will also help in implementing special welfare schemes to the families of temple priests. In all possible ways, the Congress government is trying to help the Hindu temples, and BJP is unable to digest it,” Rao added.Meanwhile, the BJP said that Congress is only taxing the Hindu temples and asked why such tax slabs do not apply for other worship places of other religions.",
