(Image: PTI) New Delhi: Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, met a delegation of the Right to Food campaign and another of fishermen from across the country at the Parliament House reception and they apprised him about their concerns and issues. The Congress claimed that the two delegations were not given a pass to enter Parliament and that is why Gandhi went to the reception area of the Parliament House to meet them.\nAfter the meeting, Gandhi told reporters, “It is our right to meet anyone but they (government) are not allowing us. I had spoken about farmers, the speaker said in the House that they are not being stopped. Now, these people have been stopped again. There is the issue of fishermen and also, people from child welfare (the Right to Food campaign) had come.”\nWhen pointed out that he is constantly meeting such delegations, Gandhi said it is his work and he will keep doing it.\nEarlier in the day, Gandhi met members of the Safai Karamchari Andolan and people involved in the practice of manual scavenging. They apprised the Congress leader of their problems and issues.\nHe also held a meeting with Congress MPs on Thursday to address a range of critical issues, including the situations in Bangladesh and China. The meeting, held at the Parliament House Annexe, also involved Congress Deputy Leader Gaurav Gogoi and general secretary K.C. Venugopal.\nGandhi emphasised the importance of raising people-centric issues and ensuring active parliamentary engagement. In a social media post, he noted that the meeting covered several important topics with his fellow MPs.\nGogoi confirmed that discussions included the ongoing situations in Bangladesh and China, recent Supreme Court judgments, and the day’s Parliamentary business.\nCongress insiders revealed plans to implement a mechanism to track MPs' performance, focusing on the number of questions posed, notices given, and attention motions submitted. The aim is to enhance productivity and ensure that Congress members effectively utilise their time in Parliament to address key issues.\nThe Congress is keen to see its members actively participate in debates and hold the government accountable, reflecting their strengthened position in the Opposition.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",

    "text": "Nearly two dozen pesticides are associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer in the United States, researchers report November 4 in Cancer . Four of those, the study finds, are also linked to prostate cancer deaths .\nThe findings can’t say for certain that these pesticides caused prostate cancer, says John Leppert, a urologist at Stanford University School of Medicine. It’s unknown whether the people who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in Leppert’s data were exposed to the pesticides.\nScience News headlines, in your inbox Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your email inbox every Thursday.\n“This study is really best at finding the potential pesticides that may be linked with prostate cancer,” Leppert says, “so that we could narrow down the list of things that need to be further studied.”\nDespite being the second most common cancer in the United States, some risk factors of prostate cancer remain elusive ( SN: 10/16/19) . “Your risk of developing prostate cancer or other cancers varies in the United States depending on where you live, and we don’t have good explanations for that geographic variation yet,” Leppert says.\nA few pesticides are thought to increase prostate cancer risk, but prior studies have been patchy: They’ve focused on small geographic areas or just a few pesticides. So Leppert and colleagues looked at data on prostate cancer incidence and the use of nearly 300 pesticides in more than 3,100 U.S. counties.\nCounties with a higher use of 22 particular pesticides, after adjustment for characteristics such as age distribution, were more likely to have more prostate cancer cases or deaths several years after the pesticides were used.\nThe team analyzed pesticide use and cancer outcomes in two different time periods. The first period focused on pesticide use from 1997 to 2001 and cancer outcomes from 2011 to 2015. The second period looked at pesticide use from 2002 to 2006 and cancer incidence from 2016 to 2020.\nThe long lag between pesticide use and cancer discovery exists because prostate cancer takes time to progress, Leppert says. The 22 pesticides showed links to prostate cancer incidence in both time periods. This included commonly known pesticides such as 2,4-D, an herbicide frequently used to treat weeds.\n“As a clinician, I hope that as we understand [environmental exposures] better, then we can be better doctors to our patients,” says Leppert. “Hopefully, our understanding of a patient’s environment will help us to catch prostate cancer early and, if needed, to treat it better.”",

    "text": "Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum\nVice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum’s launch of the Dubai Social Agenda 33 for the decade until 2033 highlighting the theme of ‘Family: The Foundation of Our Nation’ is truly praiseworthy.\nSheikh Mohammed said: “As has become our custom to unveil promising national programmes and projects on the 4th of January of every year, today we announce the launch of the Dubai Social Agenda 33: our plan for the Dubai community over the next decade. Its theme is ‘Family: The Foundation of Our Nation’, and its budget is Dhs208 billion until 2033. Its target is our Emirati families in Dubai and all aspects of their lives, in terms of housing, quality of life, identity and values, social cohesion and healthcare, as well as equipping the new generation with future skills.”\nClearly, the overarching importance of the family stands out and how much attention the benevolent UAE leadership pays to it is very noteworthy. “We aim to double the number of Emirati families within a decade, provide residential neighbourhoods that offer the world’s highest standard of living and safeguard our young generation against negative ideas that threaten the stability of our families,” His Highness added.\n“The Dubai Social Agenda outlines clear objectives and programmes based on the allocated budget, and will be overseen by my sons Hamdan, Maktoum, Ahmed and their brothers who grew up as part of the larger Dubai family and will care about its wellbeing more than anyone else. “Our nation is not merely buildings and figures; it is made up of families and people. My message to everyone in charge is that our priority for the next stage is to protect, empower and support our families,” Sheikh Mohammed said.\nThe family is not just the cornerstone of society, it is also the foundation of the nation. Healthy stable families are the need of the hour. Family is also at the root of enterprise. The Ministry of Economy has launched a unified registry for family businesses, highlighting four new cabinet resolutions that will enhance the governance of family companies and support the competitiveness of the legislation governing the sector in the country.\nTwenty-seven years ago, all member-states of the United Nations (UN) at the 1993 General Assembly through resolution A/RES/47/237 voted that May 15 each year be observed as the “International Day of Families,” the official celebration of which began two years later or in 1995. Research studies have demonstrated that families gain more social-economic support from each and one another as there are shared expenditures and division of labour. While younger members are oriented and trained to do domestic chores apart from child and elder care, the working age are given more opportunities to earn a living and become responsible stewards leading to increased chances for going beyond the hand-to-mouth subsistence and better education among the younger generations and even those who want to go for further studies.\nEveryone knows the stellar role of the family. It has an image unlike any other social entity. The family plays a key role in the development of the society and the affection that ties the members of a family with the country and the world. Truly, tight-knit families form the basic unit of a tolerant society.\nInterestingly, there is also a family-friendy garden in the UAE. The Ajman Chamber garden is a 27,000-square metre family-friendly recreational destination that includes 20,000 seasonal flowers and thousands of flowering shrubs. It also should be highlighted that Her Highness Sheikha Fatima Bint Mubarak, President of the General Women’s Union, Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation, and Chairwoman of Motherhood and Childhood Supreme Council has set an example to the world in the goodness, unlimited giving and the sincere efforts to support the UAE families in all areas.",
