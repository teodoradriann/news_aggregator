    "title": "Outrage follows hospital's elimination of labor, delivery service - NBC Chicago",
    "text": "As a suburban hospital aims to eliminate labor and delivery services, a community is reacting with shock and outrage at the news.\nAscension Alexian Brothers Hospital in Elk Grove Village made the announcement this week, confirming that it will consolidate birthing services and establish a “dedicated labor and delivery center” approximately 10 miles away.\nStream NBC 5 for free, 24/7, wherever you are.\n WATCH HERE\nThat news was met with anger and frustration from the community, including one former staff member at the hospital.\n“It’s angering. It’s very angering,” Angela Filipi, a former nurse for Ascension, said. “Maternal mortality and morbidity is high regardless, especially high in Hispanic and Black populations. What are we doing to address that? We’re taking another resource away.”\nIn a statement, Ascension Illinois said it is being led by what is “best for its patients” and that this move would increase efficiency.\n“We are excited to establish Ascension Saint Alexius Women and Children’s Hospital in Hoffman Estates as a dedicated labor and delivery center of excellence for our northwest region as we work to ensure optimal patient outcomes, efficiency of resources and alignment with the needs of the communities we serve,” the group said in a statement.\nFilipi disputed that statement, arguing that the move would exacerbate disparities in health care.\n“What happens is when you close a unit like a labor and delivery unit you’re going to create further disparities,” she said. “You’re going to create bigger gaps in access to health care, especially for the underserved populations.”\nThe closure requires final approval from the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board. To that end, a protest is being planned Saturday expressing disagreement with the closure, according to organizers.\nFeeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the news you need to know with the Chicago Catch-Up newsletter.\n SIGN UP\nAccording to Ascension Alexian Brothers Hospital's website, the hospital's birthing center includes labor and delivery, pre and postpartum care, lactation and breastfeeding support, and 24/7 emergency OB care, along with perinatal services, maternal-fetal medicine and neonatal specialty care.\nIt wasn't immediately clear if all birthing services at the hospital were being eliminated. Ascension Illinois did not immediately respond to NBC Chicago's request for clarification.\nEarlier this year, Prime Healthcare acquired eight Ascension Hospitals in Illinois. Ascension Saint Alexius and Ascension Alexian Brothers were not part of the deal and remain owned by Ascension, a non-profit Catholic health system.",

    "text": "Nearly 4,000 violent assaults were reported on trains in Britain in the past year, figures obtained by the Liberal Democrats show. The party called for “a serious strategy” to tackle crime on the railways as it accused the Conservatives of being “all bark and no bite”. British Transport Police (BTP) statistics show 3,991 incidents of violence against the person were reported on trains in the year to the end of November. That is up 12% from the previous 12 months. The figures also show 699 robberies were reported on trains in the year to the end of November, up 18% year on year, while sexual offences rose by 2.3% to 1,419. Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney, who obtained the data through a Freedom of Information request, said: “People deserve to feel safe when on public transport, yet these alarming figures tell a different story. “Far too often our train carriages are being turned into crime scenes as violent criminals are allowed to terrorise other passengers with impunity. “This Conservative Government is all bark and no bite. Rather than yet more rhetoric, we need a serious strategy to tackle this rise in crime on our railways. “The public deserves better – which is why the Liberal Democrats are calling for a return to local community policing which will help keep us safe.” BTP head of crime and public protection Detective Chief Superintendent Paul Furnell said: “Tackling crimes such as robbery and sexual offences are a force priority and we have dedicated taskforces as a result. “We are committed to making the network a hostile place for those who seek to commit such offences. “We are aware the data might not represent a true increase, with travel numbers only recently returning to pre-Covid levels. “Additionally, we continue to campaign to encourage victims and witnesses to report to us as a priority – particularly for sexual offences which we know are under-reported – and with this we expect the number of reports to continue to increase. “As a result of this, we continue our work to make reporting as accessible as possible for the travelling public, with our discreet text 61016 service turning 10 this year and the introduction of the free Railway Guardian app in 2022.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are providing police forces with the tools they need to deliver for the public and since 2010, our communities are safer. “Neighbourhood crimes including burglary, robbery and theft are down 50% and violent crime is down 52%. “There are also now 149,500 police officers keeping the public safe in England and Wales – the highest number on record.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "text": "BEDFORD – About 220 people attended the 2024 Bedford Lion’s Club Annual Youth Appreciation Program at the First Baptist Church Christian Life Center.\nThe photo shows the Youth Appreciation Program setup with kids and presenters in front and families and Lions seated in the back of the room. The honored youths, ranging in age from middle school to high school, were introduced by a representative from the organization from which they had been nominated and cited for each of their accomplishments, such as having high moral character, unselfishness, being aware of the feelings and needs of others, being the first to volunteer, being a good leader, serving as role models for other youth, and being a good solid citizen of whom our community can be proud of now and in the future. The nominating organizations were schools, youth groups, churches, and clubs.\nTheir families were also introduced, and their efforts to raise these outstanding kids were applauded.\nFor the past 29 years, the Bedford Lions Club has conducted this outstanding community project honoring 676 local youths, praising the kids for their many accomplishments, thanking the families for supporting such great children, and challenging the kids to set high goals, always do their best, and continue to help others throughout their entire lives.\nThe Youth Appreciation Project is an excellent way for the Lions to highlight the fine work done by the youth of our community. It is greatly needed since these dedicated kids rarely get any publicity for their outstanding deeds in our community.\nBedford Lions Club President Heather Wessell gave each youth a certificate stating they are “An Outstanding Youth Who Has Unselfishly Given Time and Talent for the Betterment of Our Community,” along with complimentary Pancake Festival tickets.\nEach recipient is eligible to apply for the recently established “Lion Bill Morris Memorial Youth Appreciation Award Scholarship” awarded through the BNL Scholarship Foundation. Lion Morris was in charge of the Youth Appreciation Program for 50 years, first in the Optimist Club and then in the Lions Club until he died in 2020, when the Lions started contributing to this scholarship fund in his honor.\nThe photo shows the great kids honored by the Bedford Lions Club. The following youths were honored:\nSierra England and Ruby Riley from JC’s Christian Academy, presented by Chris Perry Irelande Michaud from Girl Scout Troop 03220 presented by Tiffany Ridge and Tiffany Todd Jaymee Reed, Isaiah Conner, and Jorj Filler from Between the Crowd, presented by Nick Mullis, Katarina Kwakye from Bedford First United Methodist Church, presented by Judi Early Dean Hillenburg and Caris Armstrong from Springville Community Academy, presented by Ashlie Kimmel, Emma Voris Asher Thompson from Bedford Middle School, presented by Kathy Tyree Grant Stephenson and Glorianna Roll from St Vincent de Paul School, presented by Spencer Wardlow Christopher Carroll and Macey Lambrecht from Lawrence County 4-H, presented by Lesley Lodmell Sydney Wykoff from BNL Renaissance, presented by Michelle Hurst Eezekial Allen and Raylin Ridge from Lawrence County Independent School, presented by Greg Baugh Jacob Hubbard and Temperance Thompson from Boy Scout Troop 332, presented by Anita Moore and Anne West Abby Keith and Josh Peek from Donica Church of God, presented by Angie McCullough Maddox Ray from North Lawrence Career Center, presented by Kristina Baker Innes Owens and Kandyn Rood from Tabernacle of Praise Church, presented by Charlie Tidd and Angie Tidd Kalandra Sears and Thomas Chiasson from Boys & Girls Club of Lawrence County, presented by Alex Smith Maddie Simmerman from PRD Inc, presented by Barb Morris, Claire Edwards Ben Voigtschild from Free Methodist Church, presented by Anita Moore Allie Mosier from Fayetteville Baptist Church, presented by Nathan Bailey. To finish this great evening, the guest speaker, Nick Mullis from Between the Crowd, praised the parents and grandparents for raising these youth and thanked the youth for all they do to help others. He also thanked the members of the Bedford Lions Club for conducting this fine program for the community. He then challenged the youth to continue helping others for the rest of their lives.\nPhotos were taken during each presentation, and a group photo was taken at the end. They are accessible online at the Bedford Lions Club Facebook page .\nThe program concluded with a big group, ”Thank You,” led by the Lions Program Chair, Lion Barb Morris (Lion Bill Morris’s daughter). Then, everyone in attendance enjoyed some of the many tasty desserts served by the Lions.\nThe Lions Club’s motto is “We Serve.”",

    "text": "By Eliza Noe, The Virginian-Pilot ,\n7 hours ago Snow accumulates along the top of a fence the morning of Jan. 29, 2022 in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Hampton Roads is expected to get 2 to 4 inches of snow from a winter storm moving up the coast. L. Todd Spencer/The Virginian-Pilot/TNS Bitter cold temperatures are making their way to Hampton Roads, bringing the potential for wintery precipitation.\nJeff Orrock, meteorologist-in-charge at the National Weather Service in Wakefield, said a cold front is moving into the area in the coming days, and people should be aware of the potential effects on travel.\n“One of the things we’re going to be a little more concerned about is the fact that Friday night and Saturday morning does get pretty cold, and temperatures do get down into the mid 20s,” Orrock said. “So any surfaces that are wet, especially Saturday morning, are probably going to try to flash freeze on us a little bit. It could be kind of icy Saturday morning, if they don’t dry out fast enough, so that’s probably one of the things we’re going to have to watch out for.”\nAs the weekend progresses, Orrock said the chances for snow or freezing rain increase. Sunday night and the early hours of Monday will have the highest chances for winter weather. Current estimates show that there is between 5% and 20% chance that Hampton Roads will have “minor impacts” on driving conditions caused by winter weather. Areas toward Richmond and Northern Virginia will have stronger impacts and higher chances for snow accumulation.\n“Behind this weather system, it does get bitterly cold, and it’s going to stay cold for a while, probably even into next weekend,” Orrock said. “That’s something to keep in mind as we get through this. If we do see some areas that pick up, let’s say anywhere from 4-6 inches of snow, especially north of Richmond, it may be around for a while. Every night it’s going to be refreezing, and it might be tough to get rid of this stuff.”\nIt is still too early to make accurate snow total estimates, Orrock said, but over the next couple of days, it will be more clear as to what cities will get measurable snow.\nEliza Noe, eliza.noe@virginiamedia.com\nFor more stories, Subscribe to Virginian-Pilot.\n©2025 The Virginian-Pilot.
