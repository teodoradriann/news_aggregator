    "title": "Eric Adams Gets Brutally Booed at New York Liberty Championship Parade",
    "text": "Mayor Eric Adams was welcomed at the New York Liberty’s championship parade with a rain of boos so intense it supposedly had to be drowned out with music. The Liberty on Thursday celebrated the franchise’s first-ever WNBA championship in its 27-year history. Although the decisive Game 5 on Sunday was the subject of great debate — mainly from Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve — that all went away amid the celebratory atmosphere of the parade. The parade route ended at the steps of New York City Hall, where a number of people gave remarks to the crowd. In addition to a dance routine from the Liberty mascot Ellie the Elephant, fans also heard from New York governor Kathy Hochul. While Hochul was met with a relatively positive reception, Adams was not so lucky. Multiple videos from the crowd captured clear boos as soon as Adams was introduced and his entrance music — Jay-Z’s song “Empire State of Mind” — started playing. According to at least one attendee, the volume of the music was actually raised in an effort to conceal the booing. Adams’ appearance at the parade is part of his continued effort to maintain some semblance of normalcy as he’s facing corruption charges. Have a tip for us?

    "title": "OPINION: Alaska’s electric grid transformation is great for jobs - Anchorage Daily News",
    "text": "Our federal congressional delegation recently worked with the Biden administration to secure $206 million in electric grid investments for Alaska. This investment, along with additional energy investments, protects consumers from cost increases that would result from imported natural gas. Grid modernization and more energy generation also creates opportunities to drive down energy costs, making all businesses more competitive while creating major opportunities to strengthen our mining industry and other energy-intensive industries. Federal investment in our grid is just the latest good news for Alaska’s construction, oil and gas industries. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and the late Congressman Don Young were instrumental in working with President Joe Biden to pass the Bipartisan Energy Law, which is driving construction investment and has created the best job market in Alaska in a decade. Rep. Mary Peltola has continued Congressman Young’s long tradition of fighting to bring home these investments, including strong advocacy to bring home grid modernization funds. Why does this grid investment matter? Right now, the Golden Valley Electric Association (GVEA) is working to deploy a 130MW wind farm that will protect Interior customers from higher energy prices. It is difficult or impossible to build out this generation without modernizing our transmission to the Mat-Su, Anchorage and Kenai. By modernizing the Railbelt grid, we can deploy lower-cost clean energy in the Interior and help drive down energy prices. Utilities from Anchorage and the Mat-Su also are working on major new energy generation projects to drive down costs. Improved transmission is part of a broader effort to secure Alaska’s energy future. The Biden administration, following strong advocacy from our congressional delegation, has awarded a major grant to build out a huge energy storage facility near Healy. This innovative energy storage facility will help integrate low-cost clean energy and protect Interior consumers. Since it will be built by a union contractor, construction will mean great jobs with good benefits for Interior residents. Looking beyond electric generation, we have an incredibly bright future with energy production from Alaska. The Willow and Pikka projects on the North Slope are creating hundreds of good union jobs in construction. Many of our Alaska Native corporations and union contractors are working on additional energy generation, storage and carbon sequestration projects from the North Slope to the Railbelt. Taken together, these investments mean we will be generating more energy and creating more construction jobs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It all starts with a modern electric grid. Alaska-based energy production isn’t just important for jobs and opportunities in our state. We need to be an energy powerhouse to defend our democracy and support our allies who face threats from China and Russia. Fortunately, we’re moving in the right direction with more investment, more jobs, and more energy production. Thanks to the broad range of companies, electric cooperatives, and our Congressional delegation for working together on Alaska energy production. Jacob Howdeshell is business manager of Laborers Local 942, which represents construction, oil and gas workers throughout the Interior, North Slope and Southeast Alaska.

    "text": "The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) signed a free trade agreement with South Korea on Thursday, its second trade deal this year, as the six-member bloc intensifies efforts to boost investment ties with major economic partners in Asia.\nSouth Korea will remove tariffs on almost 90% of all items, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), and other petroleum products, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, while the Gulf states will scrap tariffs on 76.4% of traded products and 4% of traded goods.\nThe FTA will also cover trade in goods, services, government procurement, as well as cooperation among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), customs procedures, intellectual property, among others, a GCC statement said.\nThe GCC has signed few FTAs due to the complications of navigating competing priorities within the bloc, and talks such as those with China, which began in 2004, can take years.\nTrade talks have, however, gathered momentum as Gulf states – largely dependent on oil and gas for revenue – seek to diversify their economies and develop new sources of income.\nTrade between the Gulf and South Korea jumped to $78 billion from $50 billion between 2021 and 2022, according to data from London-based think tank Asia House, while the bloc’s trade with emerging Asia, which includes China, surged to $516 billion last year from $383 billion in 2021.\nThe GCC-South Korea talks, which began in 2007, were put on hold for almost 13 years before being revived last year.\nGCC Secretary General Jasem al-Budaiwi, in the statement, called the agreement “a historic step towards achieving Gulf economic integration and towards strengthening economic and trade relations between the two sides”.\nSouth Korea’s Trade Minister Ahn Duk-geun also welcomed the deal, saying it would “maximise synergy effects between trade, industry and energy”.\nEarlier this year, the GCC – comprising Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain – signed a free trade agreement with Pakistan, advanced negotiations with China, and restarted talks with Japan. FTA talks with Britain are also underway.\nThe UAE has also initiated a raft of bilateral trade deals since 2021, part of a strategy to advance its economic and political priorities amid growing regional competition, particularly with Saudi Arabia. In October, the UAE and South Korea concluded negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement.\nSource: Reuters (Additional reporting by Hyonhee Shin in Seoul; Editing by Tom Hogue and Muralikumar Anantharaman and Miral Fahmy)\n2023-12-29 hellenicshippingnews...",

The show paid tribute to Flores in a heartfelt statement:\n\"LATINXL came from an idea over late night pre-pandemic convos and backyard covid shows to do something together — to break Latinos into opportunities that would usually be hard to land… while also getting our own stage to refine our comedy and enjoy our friendship while chasing our dreams. We were so proud of Ken when he made it in his dream as a kid from Aurora.\"\nThe statement continued: \"We were always rooting for him and continued to share stages to present day. LATINXL WOULD NOT exist without Ken. The XL was a nod to Ken for having an 'XTRA large personality' and being such a force… which crowds all over the country would inevitably love.\"\nOur thoughts are with Flores' loved ones at this time.",

    "title": "Exclusive | Tom Cruise can rest easy after Florida penthouse survives Hurricane Milton unscathed",
    "text": "Tom Cruise can breathe a sigh of relief after his luxury Clearwater, Florida, penthouse stood tall against the potentially devastating Hurricane Milton. The mega-storm, which meteorologists initially warned could reach a catastrophic Category 5, ended up sparing Cruise’s prized multimillion-dollar property. The hurricane had been predicted to wreak havoc on the city, raising fears of a deadly storm surge and intense flooding. But according to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the storm weakened just before landfall, easing concerns. “The storm was significant, but thankfully this was not the worst-case scenario,” DeSantis said in a Thursday briefing. He noted that Tampa even experienced a rare reverse storm surge, which pushed water away from the city rather than flooding it. Photos obtained by The Post show Cruise’s Clearwater penthouse, located just blocks away from the Church of Scientology’s international headquarters, appeared untouched after the storm passed. The sprawling 20,000-square-foot condo, which Cruise has called home since 2018, features two floors of luxury, complete with a 39-foot rooftop lap pool, a private car elevator and a flight simulator. The actor, known for his high-octane roles, even has an infinity pool, a hot tub and an outdoor dining area — all of which came through the storm unscathed. Cruise was in London when the hurricane hit. He was spotted arriving in the UK looking concerned just a day before Milton made landfall. The “Top Gun” star bought the lavish Clearwater pad in 2016 after selling his Beverly Hills mansion for a cool $39 million. Cruise’s penthouse was the brainchild of millionaire Scientologist Moises Agami, who initially planned to offer more affordable units in the building. However, as development progressed, those plans shifted, and the SkyView became home to Cruise’s deluxe penthouse. His Florida retreat, part of the SkyView complex, is not only luxurious, but also close to the Scientology headquarters — a major draw for the actor, who is one of the church’s most prominent members. The church’s headquarters, much like Cruise’s penthouse, emerged from the hurricane without damage. In a statement to The Post, the Church of Scientology emphasized their preparedness: “We are taking Hurricane Milton very seriously and have completed all preparations to secure our staff, parishioners and neighbors,” the organization said before the hurricane hit. “This includes boarding up all windows and vulnerable access to our properties and those of all the shops in the downtown area.” Cruise’s move to Clearwater was part of a significant shift in his real estate portfolio. In the years leading up to his relocation, he offloaded several high-profile properties, including a New York City townhouse and his sprawling Colorado estate.",

    "text": "Envoy calls for harmony in China-US relationship Beijing has no intention to challenge or unseat Washington, a Chinese diplomat has said on the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, calling for mutual trust and cooperation between the two sides. \"China never intends to challenge or unseat the US,\" said Chinese Consul General in New York Huang Ping. \"Instead, we will be glad to see a confident, open, ever-growing and prosperous US. Likewise, the US should welcome a peaceful, stable and prosperous China. \"It is hoped that the US side can work with China to enhance mutual trust and cooperation, properly manage differences and sensitive issues, and implement 'San Francisco Vision' in the interest of the two countries and the two peoples,\" Huang said. He made the remarks at a reception held by the Chinese Consulate General in New York on Wednesday to commemorate the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the US. About 150 guests, including diplomatic and policy experts, and religious and social leaders, attended the reception. Expressing a welcoming attitude, Huang urged US companies to continue investing in China. Chinese market is not only big, but also highly profitable and full of talented innovators, he said, adding that it is a testing ground for international businesses to improve their competitiveness. \"We also welcome more American people to China to see Chinese culture with their own eyes, hear Chinese stories with their own ears and feel the Chinese people with their own hearts.\" Given the two countries' significant global influence, Huang said only by taking a big and long view on China-US relations can we make the right decision serving the interests of both countries and peoples. Peaceful coexistence China and the US account for more than one-third of the global GDP and nearly one-fourth of the global population. \"Turning our back on each other is not an option; for one side to change the other is not realistic; the consequences of conflict and confrontation will not be bearable. So, peaceful coexistence is a baseline that our two countries must hold on to,\" Huang said. In the past 45 years, the rise in two-way investment and bilateral trade has created millions of jobs in the US, generated substantial revenue for US companies, and provided benefits to households in both countries. What remains unchanged is \"the fact that the shared interests of the two countries are much larger than differences\", Huang said. Susan Elliott, president of National Committee on American Foreign Policy and former US ambassador to Tajikistan, said: \"We've had relations for 45 years and… we've had ups and downs, but what family members haven't had ups and downs? So I look forward to another 45 years.\" minluzhang@chinadailyusa.com",
