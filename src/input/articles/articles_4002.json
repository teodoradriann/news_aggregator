    "title": "Is a Torn ACL a Season-Ending Injury For Hikers?",
    "text": "If you haven’t torn your anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), chances are you know someone who has. About 1 in every 3,500 people—about two to eight times more commonly, women —tear their ACL every year, and almost half of all knee injuries are ACL tears. That leaves thousands of people each year asking: “Can you walk with a torn ACL?”\nThe knee joint is a network of bones, ligaments, tendons, and other tissues that help the knee bend, bear weight, and pivot the body. The ACL is a ligament in charge of stabilizing the joint: a strong band of tissue running diagonally in the middle of the knee and connecting the thigh bone to the shin bone.\nSome motions that commonly trigger tears include sudden direction changes, jumping and landing awkwardly, and knee hyperextension. These injuries most commonly occur in soccer, skiing , or basketball, where there are a lot of quick-pivot movements that stress the knee joint. Those aren’t typically motions found in hiking, but plenty of cross-training hikers find themselves with an ACL tear.\nKnees are famously a hiker’s weak link. If you’ve ever heard a “pop” followed by knee joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and instability, you might think that your uphill or downhill hiking career is completely over . However, that’s far from true.\nWhat’s the difference between torn ACL and strained ACL? ACL injuries include a spectrum of partial and complete tears, your treatment and prognosis depend on where you fall on it. Between 10 and 30 percent of ACL injuries are partial tears. A partial tear means the ligament has been loosened or overstretched, and only one of the two fiber bundles that make up the ACL have been torn. There’s still pain and swelling, but the recovery is a bit easier compared to a full tear.\nA complete tear is obviously more severe—and, also, more common. This type of injury tears the ligament completely in half or pulls it directly off the bone, making the knee joint pretty unstable. These likely need surgery.\nCan you fully bend your knee with a torn ACL? Likely not. A torn ACL can cause restricted range of motion, so bending and straightening your knee won’t be as easy as it was before. With a torn ACL, walking or hiking up and down hills or steps is a no-go until the pain and swelling goes down.\nCan you move normally with a torn ACL? It all depends on the severity of the injury. Some can walk—sometimes, even jog—with a torn ACL. It’s frowned upon to hike with a torn ACL; putting more stress on it, through inclines, long walks, or unstable terrain, can make a small tear even worse.\nYou can move normally in the sense that you can putter around the house and take yourself from room to room. In fact, two common goals many ACL patients need to achieve before getting surgery is being able to fully straighten the injured leg and being able to walk normally.\nHow can a hiker manage with an ACL injury? Because you can technically walk before getting surgery, there’s certainly an allure to sneak in an easy, flat hike. But, you have to wait until well after surgery and avoid leg-balancing movements that put a lot of stress on a torn ACL, like stepping over a fallen log or hiking on a technical trail.\nMost people choose to have an ACL tear surgically repaired, especially if they want to return to the same level of pre-injury physical activity. About a month or two after surgery, you can start to explore short, flat trails. You can’t push it here: Typically, the ACL graft is most delicate during the first 6 to 8 weeks after surgery, so you certainly should use trekking poles and knee braces for stability. Knee braces keep the knee joint secure, while preventing re-injury and supporting the rest of the leg throughout the hike.\nWith the guidance of your doctor, gradually increase the difficulty of your hikes throughout the course of several months. But, generally, it will be nine to 10 months after surgery before you can return to intense hikes.",

    "text": "An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for.During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" Spirals: Hot Dogs & More ,\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral.\"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\"The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down.Hosek wouldn't hear of it.\"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance.Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\"\"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said.In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners.Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit.\"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\"Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so.The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of.The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact.Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family.\"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "I NUMERI\nSicilia tra le prime cinque regioni italiane per numero di controversie lavorative\nSono quasi 10mila i lavoratori siciliani coinvolti in contenziosi con i propri datori di lavoro\nLa Sicilia è tra le prime cinque regioni italiane per numero di controversie lavorative, insieme a Lombardia, Lazio, Campania e Puglia, e sono in aumento le controversie per licenziamenti nel settore turismo e agricoltura. Sono quasi 10mila i lavoratori siciliani coinvolti in contenziosi con i propri datori di lavoro. Un dato che evidenzia come lo strumento della conciliazione sindacale sia utile e fondamentale per dirimere le controversie lavorative che vedono al primo posto i licenziamenti (40%), seguono le controversie su straordinari e ferie (25%) e le controversie su discriminazioni e mobbing (15%).\nI numeri sono stati diffusi in una nota dal Sinalp Sicilia, il sindacato nazionale autonomo dei lavoratori e dei pensionati che domani, venerdì 28 marzo alle 9,30, ha organizzato allo Steri, a Palermo, il convegno «La conciliazione sindacale: un’opportunità per le imprese e per i lavoratori».\nIn Sicilia, la conciliazione sindacale ha un tasso di conflittualità lavorativa più alto rispetto alla media nazionale, soprattutto per lavoro irregolare, mancato pagamento di retribuzioni, licenziamenti illegittimi, controversie su ferie, permessi e straordinari non retribuiti. Tra il 2019 e il 2023 le conciliazioni avviate in media 8.400 (si passa da 8.500 nel 2019 a 9.500 nel 2023), con una media di circa il 10% in più rispetto ai dati nazionali.\n«L’obiettivo di questo convegno – dice Andrea Monteleone, segretario regionale del Sinalp – è quello di approfondire il ruolo e le potenzialità della conciliazione sindacale, analizzando le opportunità che essa offre sia alle imprese, in termini di miglioramento delle relazioni industriali e della produttività, sia ai lavoratori, garantendo la tutela dei diritti e una maggiore partecipazione al processo decisionale. Inoltre – conclude il segretario – diventa un supporto essenziale di aiuto allo snellimento delle cause nei tribunali, che in questo modo non dovranno gravarsi di ulteriori contenziosi».COPYRIGHT LASICILIA.IT © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",

    "title": "Visual Perception Toys",
    "text": "Let’s talk visual perception toys. These games, toys, and play are designed to promote visual perceptual skills: a complex combination of various visual processing skills. These visual perceptual skills are necessary together and in coordination with one another in order for use to see information. Occupational therapy toys that visual information to create responses support functional abilities like movement or processing.\nAmazon affiliate links are included in this blog post. As an Amazon Influencer, I earn from qualifying purchases.\nVisual perception Toys Visual perception is our ability to make sense of what we see. Visual perceptual skills are essential for everything from navigating our world to reading, writing, and manipulating items.\nHere is more information about strategies to address visual perceptual skills and handwriting . Also, be sure to check out our blog post on types of eye specialists . and this resource on behavioral optometrists .\nWhat are Visual Perceptual Skills? This post contains affiliate links.\nVisual Perceptual Skills and how they are used to complete tasks like reading, writing, manipulating items, and functioning in everyday tasks:\nVisual Memory – This is one’s ability to store visual information in short term memory. This skill allows us to recall visual information. When completing hidden picture puzzles, kids visually store images of items they are looking for when scanning to locate a specific shape or image. This skill is necessary for handwriting tasks when copying information from a source, such as lists of words, homework lists, and copying sentences.\nVisual Closure – This visual perceptual skill allows us to see part of an object and visualize in our “mind’s eye” to determine the whole object. When we see part of an item we use visual closure to know what the whole item is. This skill requires the cognitive process of problem solving to identify items. Visual Closure is used to locate and recognize items in a hidden picture puzzle. In written work, we use visual closure to recognize parts of words and letters when reading and copying work.\nForm Constancy – This skill allows us to visually recognize objects no matter their orientation. When completing a hidden picture puzzle, children can recognize the missing object whether it is upside down or sideways. In handwriting skills, we use this ability to read and know letters and numbers no matter which direction we see them.\nVisual Spatial Relationships- This visual perceptual skill allows us to recognize and understand the relationships of objects within the environment and how they relate to one another.\nVisual Discrimination – This visual perception skill enables us to determine slight differences in objects. In hidden picture activities, this skill is needed to determine and locate different hidden objects. When writing and reading, visual discrimination allows us to perceive the difference between “p” and “d”. Puzzles including ones like the wooden letter puzzle described below address visual discrimination. There are many puzzles on the market that meet different age and grade levels. Here are a variety of puzzles (affiliate link) to consider.\nVisual Attention- This visual perceptual skill allows us to focus on the important pieces or parts of what we see. When we “take in” a scene or image in front of us, we are able to filter out the unimportant information. In this way, a student is able to focus our eyes on the teacher when she teaches. Driving down a road requires visual attention to take in the road so we can drive safely. Visual attention is important in copy work as students copy information from a Smart Board or book onto a piece of paper. As they visually scan from one point to another, they attend to the place they left off. Visual attention is also important and very needed in reading.\nVisual Sequential Memory- This visual perceptual skill is the ability to visually take in and then later recall the sequence or order of items in the correct order. This skill is important in reading and writing. Visual sequential memory is important in spelling words correctly and recognizing that words are not spelled correctly.\nVisual Figure-Ground – This skill enables us to locate items in a busy background. Finding hidden items in a hidden pictures puzzle works on this skill by visually scanning and identifying items within a busy scene. In handwriting, visual figure ground is necessary for copying written work from a model and locating the place left off when shifting vision.\nToys to Improve Visual Perception Highlights Hidden Pictures book set – (affiliate link) Hidden pictures are a fantastic tool for helping kids develop and strengthen visual perceptual skills like figure ground, visual attention, visual discrimination, form constancy, and visual memory. This set of hidden pictures is a nice stocking stuffer that disguises “work” as a rainy day activity.\nSelf-Correcting Heads & Tails Animal Match Puzzle – (affiliate link) Puzzles like this one helps kids address visual perceptual skills like visual discrimination, figure-ground, visual attention, form constancy, and visual memory. These are easy puzzles that can be used with younger children. Add this game to an older child’s visual perceptual activities by asking them to write stories or sentences based on the puzzle pieces while sneaking in visual perceptual skill work.\nSelf-Correcting Counting Puzzle – (affiliate link) This puzzle is very similar to the previous match puzzle, only it uses math concept to match. Work on visual perceptual skills with a math component.\nUppercase & Lowercase Alphabet (affiliate link) Help kids develop skills in upper/lowercase letter matching by addressing visual discrimination, form constancy, spatial discrimination, form constancy, visual memory, and visual discrimination.\nPreschool Alphabet Animal Wooden Puzzle (affiliate link) Visual discrimination is a skill needed for noticing differences in letters like letters b and d. It’s a skill that carries over to reading and noticing the differences between words like can and car. visual discrimination skills enable the eyes to notice differences between the orientation and parts of letters and can promote a more fluent reading ability. This skill is also important in math and spelling. Puzzles like this one also help with form constancy, visual figure ground, among other visual perceptual skills.\nPixy Cubes -(affiliate link) Noticing small differences in colors and direction is an important part of visual discrimination and reading, writing, math, and spelling. These skills are important for fluency as children age and need to complete reading and math skills at faster levels appropriate for grade advances. Matching and figuring out visual puzzles like this one address skills like visual attention, visual memory, visual sequencing, spatial relationships, and visual sequencing.\nLearning Resources iTrax Critical Thinking Game – (affiliate link) This visual perceptual toy allows children to copy and build designs using blocks of different sizes. Children can develop and boost visual perceptual skills such as visual figure-ground, visual attention, visual memory, visual sequencing, and spatial relationships in order to create the mazes that they see on the cards. There are various levels of mazes, allowing for development of skills.\nLearning Resources Dive into Shapes! “Sea” and Build Geometry Set – (affiliate link) This building set is a visual perception activity that develops various visual perceptual skills needed for skills such as handwriting and reading. Using double-sided activity cards, children can develop skills such as visual figure-ground, visual attention, visual memory, visual sequencing, and spatial relationships while they copy the three-dimensional figures they see on the cards. This activity is a powerhouse therapy tool as children can strengthen fine motor skills while building with the pieces.\nTumble Trax Magnetic Marble Run – (affiliate link) This marble run building set is a visual perception activity that develops various visual perceptual skills needed for skills such as handwriting and reading. Children can copy different levels of marble run forms using activity cards while developing skills such as visual figure-ground, visual attention, visual memory, visual sequencing, and spatial relationships. The magnetic pieces can be used on surfaces such as a refrigerator or large magnetic sheet on the wall. It’s a great tool for strengthening the upper body, developing balance and core stability, and shoulder stability while working on a vertical surface.\nCode & Go Robot Mouse Activity Set – (affiliate link) Use the activity cards to copy maze forms while developing visual perceptual skills such as visual figure-ground, visual attention, visual memory, visual sequencing, and spatial relationships. The maze is a great self-confidence booster for children as they complete mazes for the battery operated mouse. This game provides an opportunity for developing and introducing coding skills. When watching the mouse as it travels through the mouse, children can enhance visual scanning skills.\nLet’s Go Code! Activity Set – (affiliate link) This visual perception game requires children to hop, turn, step, and move through a gross motor maze of directions. Children can develop visual perceptual skills such as visual attention, visual memory, visual sequencing, and spatial relationships. Directionality is enhanced with movement activities such as this one and is much needed in tasks such as writing and identifying direction of letters and numbers.\nSpot It – (affiliate link) This game is a fun way to help children develop and strengthen visual perceptual skills like figure ground, visual attention, visual discrimination, form constancy, and visual memory. The game is small enough to be used as a busy activity while waiting at restaurants and appointments. It’s a game that boosts skills and can be used during family game night, too.\nQ-bitz Jr. – (affiliate link) Noticing differences in colors, forms, and directions are important skills needed in visual discrimination for reading, writing, math, and spelling. These skills are important for fluency as children age and need to complete reading and math skills at faster levels appropriate for grade advances. This game is a fun way to address skills like visual attention, visual memory, visual sequencing, spatial relationships, and visual sequencing.\nWooden Pattern Blocks Set – (affiliate link) These copying puzzle activities is a great way to develop skills like form constancy and visual discrimination. Children can look at the picture card and recreate the form using three dimensional blocks. It’s a nice way to develop visual perceptual skills like visual attention, visual memory, visual sequencing, spatial relationships, and visual sequencing.\nClassic Tangoes – (affiliate link) Similar to the tangrams above, children can view the image on a card and use tangrams to re-create the picture in this classic game. This activity develops visual perceptual skills like visual attention, visual memory, visual sequencing, spatial relationships, and visual sequencing, form constancy, and visual discrimination, all needed for handwriting and reading. Read more about using tangrams in visual perception and handwriting .\nEquilibrio Game – (affiliate link) This building activity requires players to copy forms from a puzzle book while re-creating buildings that challenge balance and gravity! When copying and building the forms, kids develop and build eye-hand coordination skills and visual perceptual skills like visual attention, visual memory, visual sequencing, spatial relationships, and visual sequencing, form constancy, and visual discrimination.\nMore Therapy Toys Looking for more toys to address specific skill areas?

He appeared to realize that I victimised to be really struggling, so we in agreement that we’d pick out a while asunder. As I flipped by substance of the pages of my journal, I started to government note this reflection wasn’t a bit or one-third clock thing.

És fonamental que les escoles assumeixin un paper clau, integrant-la de manera destacada en els currículums i promovent activitats que despertin l’interès dels estudiants. A més, el govern hauria d’intensificar el seu suport amb polítiques que fomentin la creació i difusió de literatura en català, així com el seu accés fàcil i atractiu a través de biblioteques, plataformes digitals i programes culturals. Només amb un compromís conjunt de les institucions educatives, les famílies i el govern assegurarem la llengua i la cultura.\n[Identificar-me](/registre/compte/verificat.html?return=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lbHB1bnRhdnVpLmNhdC9vcGluaW8vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMy1sZWN0b3Jlc2NyaXUvMjQ4NTUzNS1mb21lbnRhci1sYS1saXRlcmF0dXJhLWNhdGFsYW5hLWVudHJlLWVscy1qb3Zlcy5odG1sI2NvbW1lbnRz&msg=34bd8f3599cdc6f6308d40855bdb2a1b).
