    "text": "foto: é•¿æ˜¥è¥¿é—¨å¤§å®˜äºº/Weibo\nBrilio.net - Wearing makeup every day has become a routine for many people, but what if for more than two decades, someone has never really cleaned it off? That's what happened to a woman from Jilin, China, who recently went viral after revealing her extreme habits.\nHis face is now severely inflamed, thickened like a monkey. Even his facial skin has changed color to bright red like a lobster.\nThe 37-year-old woman admitted that she had never completely removed her makeup for the past 22 years. As a result, her facial skin condition is now very concerning and is said to resemble the god Guan Gong who is known in Chinese culture because of his bright red face.\nThe news surfaced through a video showing the woman's face swollen, red, and looking like an overripe tomato. In the video, she was also seen having difficulty opening her eyes because of the thick red rash covering her face.\nIn a video widely circulated on Weibo, the woman named Gao described how terrible the itching she constantly felt. She even felt unable to live her social life as before.\nphoto: /Weibo\n\"The itching was unbearable. I locked myself in the house every day. I didn't dare go out,\" Gao said while holding back tears, quoted from 8days.sg, Wednesday (2/7).\nShe described how her face felt burning, stiff, and itchy to the point of interfering with her daily activities. The drastic changes to her face also made her feel less confident.\n\"My whole face is now full of wrinkles and ugly. I don't dare to go out of the house, meet people, or make friends,\" she said again.\nGao said her love for makeup began at the age of 15, when she secretly tried on her mother's lipstick. Since then, she has found removing makeup a hassle.\nShe started to get used to not cleaning her face because she thought she would wear makeup again the next day. This habit lasted for decades without realizing the long-term impact.\n\"Why should I clean it if I'm going to wear it again tomorrow?\" he said innocently.\nFor 22 years, Gao had been washing her face with only water, without soap or any other facial cleanser. Although she had occasional acne, she didnt think it was a big dealuntil one day her face became so swollen that it was unrecognizable.\nphoto: /Weibo\nWhen the condition worsened, instead of going to a dermatologist, she sought a solution at a beauty clinic. She decided to undergo a skin booster injection procedure which actually made the condition worse.\nInstead of getting better, her skin became dull, stiff, and even turned purple-black. This made her appearance even more deviant from normal conditions.\nSome dermatologists have responded skeptically to the case, doubting that the main cause of Gao's facial disfigurement was simply failure to remove makeup.\nSome suspect her condition was exacerbated by botched cosmetic procedures, use of steroid-containing facial creams, or over-cleansing. Her symptoms are said to be similar to rosacea or steroid-induced dermatitis.\n(brl/ola)",

    "text": "Il Regno Unito sarà il primo Paese nel continente europeo a vendere carne coltivata, per l’esattezza, pollo. L’azienda Meatly, startup britannica, ha ricevuto il via libera dalle autorità di regolamentazione dello Stato, ma la sua carne sarà destinata solo al cibo per gli animali domestici . Meatly diventa così anche la prima azienda al mondo a ottenere l'autorizzazione per gli alimenti coltivati in laboratorio per animali domestici.\nI cani i primi ad assaggiarla\nIn particolare, i primi animali a nutrirsi con la carne di pollo coltivata di Meatly saranno i cani . I primi lotti saranno in vendita entro l’anno dopo aver condotto prove di gusto tra i quattro zampe.\nMeatly ha comunicato che “ la carne è conforme a tutte le normative necessarie e ha superato il rigoroso processo di ispezione dell'APHA (Animal and Plant Health Agency) ”. Le altre agenzie ad averla approvata sono state la Food Standards Agency (FSA) e il Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).\nL'azienda ha spiegato inoltre che i test per l’approvazione hanno dimostrato che il pollo coltivato è privo di batteri e virus, che i nutrienti utilizzati per la crescita delle cellule sono sicuri e che il prodotto finale è sicuro, nutriente, privo di OGM, antibiotici, agenti patogeni dannosi, metalli pesanti e altre impurità.\nI primi lotti di pollo coltivato avranno un costo più alto di quello che l’azienda punta a raggiungere nei prossimi tre anni, scalando il livello di produzione.\nL’amministratore delegato di Meatly, Owen Ensor, ha dichiarato : “ Sono incredibilmente orgoglioso che Meatly sia la prima azienda in Europa ad aver ottenuto il via libera alla vendita di carne coltivata. Stiamo dimostrando che esiste un modo sicuro e a basso capitale per portare rapidamente la carne coltivata sul mercato ”.\nMa in un'intervista al The Telegraph ha avuto qualcosa da dire nei confronti dell’Unione Europea e degli Stati Uniti: “ L'Unione Europea è tradizionalmente un'autorità di regolamentazione più conservatrice e gli Stati Uniti si stanno invischiando nella politica alimentare - inutilmente, a mio avviso. Quindi il Regno Unito può davvero fare un passo avanti. ”\nLa polpetta di carne di mammut sintetica esiste, ma nessuno ha avuto il coraggio di mangiarla Vai all'approfondimento\nA dicembre del 2023 l’Italia aveva provato a imporre il divieto di produzione e immissione sul mercato della carne coltivata, ma a febbraio l’UE ha stabilito che il disegno di legge italiano non è in linea con il mercato unico europeo. Tuttavia, nell’Unione Europea la carne coltivata non può essere venduta perché non c’è ancora una legislazione comunitaria in materia.\nNegli Stati Uniti le aziende Upside Food e Good Meat hanno ricevuto il permesso di vendere carne coltivata anche per il consumo umano, ma non per l’acquisto nei negozi, solo per la distribuzione nei ristoranti. Nel 2024, tuttavia, gli Stati di Alabama, Arizona, Florida e Tennessee hanno considerato una legge per vietarne la produzione, la vendita e la distribuzione.\nDavvero la carne sintetica può aiutare a salvare il mondo? Vai all'approfondimento",

    "text": "Molly-Mae Hague has revealed the “hardest part” of her split from fiancé Tommy Fury in a new YouTube video. Just two weeks after ending their engagement, the former Love Island sensation and the professional boxer, both 25, are navigating the waves of a very public split.\nMolly-Mae and Tommy have been a couple since their time on Love Island, and the news of their split has sent ripples through their fanbase.\nThe internet has been rife with accusations aimed at Tommy. These include an alleged cheating incident with 20-year-old Danish Milla Corfixen during a holiday trip to North Macedonia.\nMolly-Mae Hague addressed the split in a YouTube video. (Credit: Molly-Mae Hague via YouTube) Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury split In her first video post-split, Molly-Mae addressed her viewers from the floor of her lavish £4 million Cheshire mansion.\nShe revealed her intentions to move forward.\n“You might be clicking on this video hoping I’ll spill the tea or speak about what’s been happening the past few weeks, but to be honest with you that was never something that was going to happen,” she said, expressing her desire for privacy during this challenging time.\nThe young mother maintained that her strength comes from her loved ones and the virtual support from her followers.\n“My coping mechanism has been talking to those who I love… then coming on here and pushing forward.”\nWhile the rumour mill has been active with claims of Tommy’s infidelities, Molly refused to fan the flames.\n“Out of respect for Tommy, I don’t want to talk about it because the last two weeks has been a lot and it has blown out of proportion and the last thing I want to do is fuel the fire and stir the pot when it doesn’t need to be,” she shared.\n‘Very, very sad’ Despite the media circus, Molly emphasised that it’s “not drama, it’s not a publicity stunt, it’s actually really sad and deep and I don’t feel right to talk about it”.\n“Tommy is Bambi’s dad and I will always value him and respect him and will always have a lot of love for him. We were together for five years and it is very very sad,” she also said.\nMolly-Mae and Tommy Fury separated after 5 years together. (Credit: Cover Images) Molly-Mae video She also took a moment to thank her fans, saying: “I have been so overwhelmed from the support.”\nMoving forward, while acknowledging the sadness, the star also shared her optimism: “Let’s hope we can move forward because I have so many exciting things coming up.”\nAmong the most poignant moments in her video, Molly-Mae described the weekends as the “hardest part” of the break-up.\n“When you are going through a break-up weekends are the worst,” she confessed.\n“Weekends are something I look forward to, it is family time and memory-making time and now I feel like weekends are the hardest time because it’s lonely and sad. I’m not looking forward to them but I think every weekend that past it should get easier.\n“In break-ups there are parts of the days that are worse and better than others, morning and evenings are horrendous and weekends for me horrendous. In the middle of the day when your busy you’re not thinking about it and then when things slow down you think about it.\n“I was so used to how life was for so long and had a routine and everything is done with your person and there is a lot of change and it is really crap.”\n‘It’s going to be a journey’ The influencer confirmed that she will always have respect and love for Tommy, especially as he is the father of her child, Bambi, but she also recognises the need to press forward.\nShe concluded the video on a hopeful note. “It’s going to be a journey and process but I’m glad I have an online family for support.”\nRead more: Tommy Fury ruthlessly mocked as he issues new statement hitting back at ‘horrendous allegations’ about Molly-Mae split\nWho do you stand with?

    "title": "Hamas announces it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari ceasefire proposal",
    "text": "Hamas has announced it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari proposal for a ceasefire to halt the seven-month war with\nIsrael in Gaza.\nIt came hours after Israel ordered about 100,000 Palestinians to begin evacuating the southern city of Rafah, signalling that a long-promised ground invasion could be imminent.\nThere was no immediate comment from Israel on the deal, and details of the proposal have not been released.\nIn recent days, Egyptian and Hamas officials said the ceasefire would take place in stages during which Hamas would release hostages it is holding in exchange for Israeli troop pullbacks from Gaza.\nIt is not clear whether the deal will meet Hamas’s key demand of bringing about an end to the war and complete Israeli withdrawal.\nHamas said in a statement that its top leader, Ismail Haniyeh, had delivered the news in a phone call with Qatar’s prime minister and Egypt’s intelligence minister.\nAfter the release of the statement, Palestinians erupted in cheers in the sprawling tent camps around Rafah, hoping the deal meant an Israeli attack had been averted.\nIsrael’s closest allies, including the US, have repeatedly said that Israel should not attack Rafah, and the looming operation has raised global alarm over the fate of around 1.4 million Palestinians sheltering there.\nAid agencies have warned that an offensive would worsen Gaza’s humanitarian catastrophe and bring a surge of more civilian deaths in an Israeli campaign that has killed 34,000 people and devastated the territory.\nUS President Joe Biden spoke on Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and reiterated US concerns about an invasion of Rafah.\nHe said a ceasefire is the best way to protect the lives of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, a National Security Council spokesperson said.\nHamas and Qatar said invading Rafah would derail efforts by international mediators to broker a ceasefire.\nDays earlier, Hamas had been discussing a US-backed proposal that reportedly raised the possibility of an end to the war and a withdrawal of Israeli troops in return for the release of all hostages held by the group.\nIsraeli officials have rejected that trade-off, vowing to continue their campaign until Hamas is destroyed.\nMr Netanyahu said on Monday that seizing Rafah, which Israel says is the last significant Hamas stronghold in Gaza, is vital to ensure the militants cannot rebuild their military capabilities and repeat the attack on Israel that triggered the war.\nLieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani, an army spokesman, said about 100,000 people were being ordered to move from parts of Rafah to a nearby Israel-declared humanitarian zone called Muwasi, a makeshift camp on the coast.\nHe said Israel has expanded the size of the zone and that it included tents, food, water and field hospitals.\nAround 450,000 displaced Palestinians are already sheltering in Muwasi. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said it has been providing them with aid but conditions are squalid, with few toilets or sanitation facilities in the largely rural area.\nIsraeli military leaflets were dropped with maps detailing a number of eastern neighbourhoods of Rafah to evacuate, warning that an attack was imminent and anyone who stays “puts themselves and their family members in danger”.\nUNRWA will not evacuate from Rafah so it can continue to provide aid to those who stay behind, said Scott Anderson, the agency’s director in Gaza.\n“We will provide aid to people wherever they choose to be,” he said.\nThe UN says an attack on Rafah could disrupt the distribution of aid keeping Palestinians alive across Gaza. The Rafah crossing into Egypt, a main entry point for aid to Gaza, lies in the evacuation zone. The crossing remained open on Monday after the Israeli order.\nJan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, condemned the “forced, unlawful” evacuation order and the idea that people should go to Muwasi.\n“The area is already overstretched and devoid of vital services,” he said, adding that an Israeli assault could lead to “the deadliest phase of this war”.\nIsrael’s bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 34,700 Palestinians, around two-thirds of them children and women, according to Gaza health officials.\nMore than 80% of the population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, and hundreds of thousands in the north are on the brink of famine, according to the UN.",

    "text": "В России в рамках борьбы с мошенниками введены частичные запреты на осуществление звонков через мессенджеры WhatsApp* и Telegram.\nЭто решение действительно может повысить уровень безопасности россиян, которые нередко становятся жертвами обмана именно на этих платформах, считает Александр Дворянский, директор по информационной безопасности Группы компаний «Элемент» и специалист в области кибербезопасности. В интервью 360.ru он рекомендовал не пытаться обходить ограничения.\nАудио- и видеозвонки в мессенджерах служат основными средствами работы злоумышленников, и поэтому ограничение этих функций было реализовано в нужный момент, отметил эксперт. Он пояснил, что подобная блокировка осуществляется на уровне операторов связи: трафик передаётся через интернет, используемый мессенджером, и если оператор выявляет нежелательные звонки, он их блокирует.\nПо мнению Дворянского, попытки обойти установленные меры не приведут к успеху, поэтому лучше от них воздержаться.\n«Не стоит пытаться обмануть систему, которая направлена на обеспечение вашей безопасности в общении и повседневной жизни. Это полезная инициатива, которая не повлияет на пользователей мессенджеров», — подытожил киберэксперт.\nО введении блокировок звонков ранее заявил Роскомнадзор. Представители Госдумы отметили, что владельцы мессенджеров фактически стали пособниками преступников, а число пострадавших только в WhatsApp с 2024 года увеличилось в 3,5 раза. При этом Минцифры России не исключает возможности восстановления доступа, но только после того, как мессенджеры «приземлятся» в России.\nWhatsApp* принадлежит экстремистской Meta, запрещенной в России.",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

The snow is piling up across New Mexico, and many people see it as a beneficial factor. \"I think the snow provides most of the moisture and rainfall that we need for the summer, so it's really good to have it,\" Tabitha Martinez said. Martinez and her family are taking advantage of the snow and making the most out of what's in front of them. From sledding to strolling downtown and enjoying the atmosphere, there is no shortage of powder in the New Mexico state capitol. Three to four inches could be seen across town. Road conditions are mostly cleared, but residents are still advising others to drive with care as conditions may vary across the area. \"If you don't know how to drive in the snow, just stay home,\" Martinez said. Santa Fe is expected to see more winter weather conditions on Sunday with a 50 percent chance of precipitation.",
