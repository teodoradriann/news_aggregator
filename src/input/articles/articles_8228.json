    "text": "India's disaster management moving forward with 'zero casualty' approach: Amit Shah The Home Minister also reviewed long-term measures to formulate a comprehensive and far-reaching policy to mitigate the menace of floods in the country. While making an appeal to all the states and the union territories to timely implement the advisories issued by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) for flood management, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Sunday that India's disaster management is moving forward with a 'zero casualty' approach under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. HM Shah made the remarks while chairing a high-level meeting in Delhi to review the preparedness of flood management in the country. The Home Minister also reviewed long-term measures to formulate a comprehensive and far-reaching policy to mitigate the menace of floods in the country. The Home Minister directed the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Central Water Commission (CWC) to complete the process of recalibrating all the equipment used in flood forecasts at the earliest. New technologies being adopted by all the agencies and the expansion of their network for flood management were also discussed during the meeting. HM Shah reviewed the action taken on the decisions made in the meeting held last year, and also reviewed the preparations to deal with the Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF). He emphasised on optimum use of satellite imagery provided by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) by various agencies for flood and water management. Instructing concerned departments to conduct a detailed study of the recent floods in Sikkim and Manipur and submit a report to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Home Minister also directed to ensure that floodgates of all the major dams are in good condition. He mentioned during the meeting that the flood monitoring centres of the CWC should be in accordance with the country's requirements and of international standards. It was mentioned during the meeting that the non-perennial rivers are prone to more soil erosion and siltation, resulting in floods. The Home Minister directed that efforts should be made to upgrade the forecast system of water level of rivers for better flood management. He said that a natural drainage system should be an integral part of the designs of road construction to deal with inundation of roads, in case of floods. HM Shah said that at least 50 large ponds in the Northeast should be constructed so that the water of the Brahmaputra River could be diverted and stored in those ponds. This will help in developing agriculture, irrigation and tourism in those areas at a low cost and also help in tackling the floods, and will eventually benefit the local economy. HM Shah also instructed the NDMA and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) to take appropriate precautionary measures to prevent incidents of forest fire. For this, he stressed the need to regularly create fire lines, remove dry leaves and conduct mock drills from time to time with local residents and forest personnel. Along with this, he also asked to analyse the incidents of repeated forest fires at the same place. The Home Minister also asked the NDMA to prepare a detailed manual to deal with incidents of forest fires. The Home Minister directed that the IMD's alerts regarding lightning strikes should be disseminated to the public on time through SMS, TV, FM radio and other mediums. He emphasised on the need to integrate weather, rainfall and flood warning related apps developed by various departments so that their benefits could reach the targeted population. The MHA detailed that during the meeting, IMD, CWC, NDRF and NDMA made detailed presentations. The departments also apprised about their preparedness for the current monsoon season and future action plan. Union Minister for Jal Shakti C.R. Paatil, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, Home Secretary, Secretaries of Ministries and Departments of River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Earth Sciences, Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Road Transport and Highways, Chairperson Railway Board, Members and Heads of Departments of NDMA, Directors General of NDRF and IMD, Chairman NHAI and senior officers from other concerned departments including CWC were present in the meeting.

    "text": "[News](https://ijr.com/news/) Franklin Graham Scorches Christianity Today Article Claiming Jesus Was Asian Franklin Graham, the son of late evangelist Billy Graham, scorched the Christian media magazine Christianity Today for claiming Jesus Christ was Asian. On Dec. 27, Graham, 71, responded to the article from Christianity Today on X, formerly known as Twitter. “[Christianity Today Magazine] is being criticized for their article about artists depicting Jesus as Asian—and I also have to ask why they would publish something so far off base. We don’t have to wonder or speculate about this—the Bible gives us very specific details about Jesus’ earthly lineage and where He was born and grew up,” he wrote. Additionally, Graham stated, “We know that Jesus was Jewish” and noted that not believing or accepting the Bible as “the Word of God” puts everything “in question.” “Guess what—we don’t get to make God in our own image. He is Who He is! We must be on guard against anything or anyone who attempts to undermine the authority of the Word of God,” he concluded. This came after Christianity Today promoted the article Christmas Eve on X. “Jesus was born in Asia. He was Asian. The artists in this photo essay bring him back to Asia—but not to ancient Israel,” the magazine wrote. The magazine added, “These nine artworks proclaim the expansiveness of Christ’s kingdom.” In the [article](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2023/december-web-only/nativity-art-asian-jesus-birth-china-india-middle-east.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=article), written by art curator Victoria Emily Jones on Dec. 18, titled “How Asian Artists Picture Jesus’ Birth From 1240 to Today” she stated, “Some may object to depicting Jesus as anything other than a brown male born into a Jewish family in Bethlehem of Judea in the first century, believing that doing so undermines his historicity.” However, she claimed that “Christian artists who tackle the subject of the Incarnation are often aiming not at historical realism but at theological meaning.” “By representing Jesus as Japanese, Indonesian, or Indian, “convey a sense of God’s immanence, his “with-us–ness,” for their own communities—and for everyone else, the universality of Christ’s birth,” she shared.

    "title": "Americans Agree with the Student Protests: The War in Gaza Must End",
    "text": "A reckoning is happening on college campuses across the country. In the last few weeks, students at dozens of colleges and universities have camped out to protest Israel’s U.S.-backed war on Gaza—and often their schools’ investments in companies that profit from that war. These students have been met with incredible repression. As of this writing, police had arrested more than 2,000 protesters, sometimes violently . Schools have suspended, expelled and evicted student activists even as Congress grills school presidents for not going further. College administrators, lawmakers and even President Joe Biden have repeatedly claimed that these protests are “antisemitic.” But with basic context, that claim falls flat. Since the start of Israel’s assault on Gaza (and long before that ), there have been Jewish communities advocating for Palestinian rights. While grieving losses in Israel, Jewish-led groups like Jewish Voice for Peace and If Not Now have called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Similarly, many campus protests have included Jewish students celebrating Shabbat alongside Muslim students observing Friday prayers. Young Jews are reporting that their faith motivated them to join the encampments. “To be Jewish in a time of genocide means that you have a duty and a responsibility to speak up,” one organizer told Teen Vogue. In Philadelphia, where I live, students from the University of Pennsylvania’s Gaza Solidarity Encampment invited two Israeli Holocaust scholars to speak about antisemitism. Afterward, the scholars wrote a letter urging the university not to disband the encampment. “This misguided attempt to shut down speech under the guise of protecting Jews is all the more insidious,” they wrote, “because it diverts attention from the real sources of antisemitism.” Those “real sources,” they clarify, are political forces on the far right that mingle openly with white supremacists and Nazis—including some of the same figures now calling to bring in troops to shut down these anti-war encampments. Being Jewish myself, I recently joined a Passover Seder at the UPenn encampment. The sunny, vibrant service—led by multiple generations of Jewish faith leaders—deepened the meaning of the liberation-themed holiday by connecting it to the struggle for Palestinian liberation. That struggle, as students keep reminding us , should be the true focus of the media right now. So far the Israeli military has indiscriminately killed more than 34,000 Palestinians — 14,000 of them children. Another child is killed or wounded in Gaza every ten minutes . Israel’s blockade of humanitarian aid now threatens the entire population of Gaza with starvation. Mothers surviving on animal feed are watching their infants waste away in their arms, while parents struggle to identify their children by their clothing in newly unearthed mass graves . You don’t have to be one of the hundreds of scholars warning that this is genocide to know that it’s wrong. In fact, most Americans agree strongly that this must end. Polling shows that the majority of U.S. voters of all political parties disapprove of Israel’s military actions in Gaza, oppose sending more military aid to Israel and support the U.S. calling for a permanent ceasefire. But policy makers have yet to listen to us. Biden just signed the largest-ever U.S. aid package for Israel. His administration continues to supply Israel with U.S.-made weapons, which are being used in violation of our own laws protecting human rights. It’s no wonder people are demanding accountability. As they have always done , the younger generation is making it clear that if their leaders ignore them—especially in cases of life or death for innocent people—then they will become unignorable. In these encampments, students are overcoming their differences in order to care for each other and live their values. They’re modeling what a better world could look like at a time when we need it most. Instead of joining the powerful who are silencing our speech, we should join the students protecting it.

    "title": "Meghan Markle Shows Up (Online) For Her Jam Pal’s Parenting Charity",
    "text": "One good turn on Instagram deserves another. After Meghan Markle’s friend Kelly McKee Zajfen posted a glowing review of her pal’s new American Riviera Orchard strawberry jam earlier this week, Meghan on Thursday posed with McKee Zafjen, the pair sporting branded T-shirts supporting her charity, Alliance of Moms. Meghan, 42, was photographed wearing the shirt bearing the slogan, “Love like a mother.” In an accompanying post, McKee Zajfen said the T-shirts were for a Mother’s Day campaign for her charity, which supports pregnant teenagers and young parents in the foster care system in Los Angeles. McKee Zajfen, 44, wrote that Meghan was one of the people in her life who lifted her up “with undeniable force of pure love.” McKee Zafjen was struck by tragedy in July 2022 when her nine-year-old son, George, died suddenly at the family home. Speaking of Meghan, she added: “You inspire me. You pick me up when I need it and you Love Like A Mother! Thank you for continuing to support the @allianceofmoms. For supporting this campaign and our youth. In doing so, you are supporting the mission to build bright futures for young parents who have experienced foster care.” Earlier this week Zajfen received one of Meghan’s limited edition American Riviera Orchard strawberry jam pots. She posted online, writing: “Oh Just a taste of what’s to come! So proud of you M @americanrivieraorchard.” Meghan and Kelly went skiing in Utah together last month, with their friend Heather Dorak, a Pilates instructor. Zajfen posted pictures of the trio from the slopes, writing: “Beyond grateful for the best of friends! What a trip! Thank you doesn’t even begin to express what my heart is feeling after this trip. “The love of family time and adventure and belly laughs made this trip one for the books! “Here’s to many more adventures with friends that feel like family and appreciating each day.”",

    "title": "Cleveland Browns get unfortunate Amari Cooper injury update ahead of Thursday night",
    "text": "Cleveland Browns Pro Bowl wide receiver Amari Cooper is in the midst of a career-best season. He is also coming off a Week 16 outing in which the veteran broke Cleveland’s single-game record with 265 yards in a win over the Houston Texans. Unfortunately, Cooper will not be able to duplicate that Thursday night to open NFL Week 17 against the New York Jets. The 29-year-old wide receiver was surprisingly listed as inactive for the big game . Cooper had been dealing with a heel injury since last week’s win over the Texans. While there was optimism that he’d be able to go, that’s not going to be the case. This comes with the 10-5 Browns attempting to clinch as spot in the NFL Playoffs at home against the Jets on Thursday Night Football . A Pro Bowler with the then-Oakland Raiders and Dallas Cowboys earlier in his career, Cooper has returned to elite form this season. It has been needed with the Browns being forced to start four quarterbacks on the season. With Cooper sidelined, Browns quarterback Joe Flacco is going to be behind the proverbial eight-ball against a Jets pass defense that ranks second in the NFL behind Cleveland. The expectation is that tight end David Njoku will see an uptick in targets. Njoku caught six passes for 44 yards with a touchdown against Houston last week. As for the wide receiver position, Elijah Moore should see more balls thrown his way. More must-reads:",

    "text": "La Casa Blanca afirmó este jueves que no está considerando otorgar un perdón presidencial al fundador de WikiLeaks , Julian Assange, como solicitan sus abogados. La portavoz de la Casa Blanca, Karine Jean-Pierre , respondió con un escueto \"no\" cuando los periodistas a bordo del avión presidencial Air Force One le preguntaron si se estaba considerando esa opción.\nLa pregunta surgió a raíz de las declaraciones de los abogados de Assange y de su esposa, Stella Assange , quienes en las últimas horas anunciaron que pedirán al presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden , un perdón presidencial con el objetivo de limpiar el historial delictivo de Assange.\nLee también Julian Assange \"maravillado\" con la libertad en Australia\nEsta semana, Assange selló con el Departamento de Justicia norteamericano un acuerdo judicial por el que se declaró culpable de un cargo penal relacionado con la mayor filtración de documentos clasificados de la historia de Estados Unidos, ocurrida en 2010 y que cuestionó el papel de ese país en el mundo al revelar atrocidades en las guerras de Irak y Afganistán .\nA cambio de reconocer su responsabilidad, Assange fue condenado formalmente a 62 meses de cárcel, pero se le dio crédito por el tiempo que ya había cumplido en una prisión de alta seguridad en el Reino Unido . De esta manera, pudo salir en libertad y regresar a su Australia natal.\nJulian Assange, cerca de reunir los 9 millones de pesos que costó el vuelo a su libertad\nÚnete a nuestro canal ¡EL UNIVERSAL ya está en Whatsapp!, desde tu dispositivo móvil entérate de las noticias más relevantes del día, artículos de opinión, entretenimiento, tendencias y más.\njf/mgm",
