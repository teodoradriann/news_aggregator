    "text": "[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.] \\nThe IAB Hong Kong Digital Awards 2024 celebrated excellence in digital marketing, bringing together over 300 industry leaders at Hotel ICON on March 18. The prestigious ceremony, now in its third consecutive year, honored strategy, creativity, innovation, and measurable results across multiple competitive categories. The elegant venue provided the perfect backdrop for recognizing the region&apos;s most outstanding digital campaigns of the past year. DigiSalad and Bupa&apos;s AI-powered Blua Health Mobile App emerged as the standout winner, claiming the prestigious \"Best Digital Campaign of the Year\" award after an intensive selection process. The revolutionary healthcare application impressed both users and industry experts with its cutting-edge functionality and innovative go-to-market approach. Judges commended the campaign for its strategic use of technology and flawless execution.\\n\\n\"This year&apos;s entries reflect the wisdom and creativity of the industry, showcasing the unlimited potential of digital marketing,\" said Janet Lee, Advisor to the Committee.

    "title": "James Bond star Pierce Brosnan in hot water over ‘trespass at Yellowstone’ | This Is Local London",
    "text": "James Bond star Pierce Brosnan has been charged with stepping out of bounds in a thermal area during a recent trip to Yellowstone National Park in the US. The Irish actor walked in an off-limits area at Mammoth Terraces, in the northern part of Yellowstone near the Wyoming-Montana border, on November 1, according to two federal citations issued on Tuesday. Brosnan, 70, who played Bond on the big screen four times before Daniel Craig took on the role, is set to make a mandatory appearance on January 23 in the courtroom of the world’s oldest national park. The 007 star, from Drogheda in County Louth, was in the park on a personal visit and not for film work, the US Attorney’s Office for Wyoming said. Mammoth Terraces is a scenic spot of mineral-encrusted hot springs bubbling from a hillside. They are just some of the park’s hundreds of thermal features, which range from spouting geysers to gurgling mud pots, with water at or near boiling point. Going out-of-bounds in such areas can be dangerous – some of the millions of people who visit Yellowstone each year get badly burned by ignoring warnings not to stray off the trail. Getting caught can bring legal peril too, with jail time, hefty fines and bans from the park handed down to trespassers regularly. In addition to his Bond films, Brosnan starred in the 1980s TV series Remington Steele and is known for starring roles in the films Mrs Doubtfire and The Thomas Crown Affair.

    "text": "6月9日，广西桂林灌阳县第二高级中学的刘同学在高考结束后，自己挑着行李回家。视频中她穿着朴素，用一根木棍当扁担，独自挑着两个大包。这段视频发布后感动了许多网友，有人留言说：“虽然没有掌声，没有鲜花，没有拥抱，但步伐却无比坚定。骨子里透着一股韧劲！这份自信和坦然令人佩服。”\n6月11日，刘同学接受了采访，讲述了当时的情况。她表示拍摄时并不知情，后来通过同学和朋友才知道这件事。实际上，她的母亲当时来接她回家，因为东西较多，两人一起分担。视频只拍到了走在前面的她。\n刘同学解释说，包里主要是被子，因为她怕冷，所以带了三床厚厚的被子。母亲则在后面帮她拖行李箱，拎着桶。每次放寒假和暑假，母亲都会来接她。\n关于家庭情况，刘同学提到她有一个哥哥，父亲和哥哥都在外面打工，家里只有她和母亲。母亲快60岁了，在她出生时年纪已经比较大。高考前，母亲问她是否需要陪考，她回答说可以独自应对，让母亲在家做自己的事情。她非常感激父母，尽管家庭条件一般，但她和哥哥得到了平等对待，家人在一起就是最大的幸福。\n对于高考，刘同学觉得英语听力有些难度，但作文写完了。她特别感谢英语老师，认为老师的帮助让她提高了分数。关于未来，刘同学表示大学还在考虑中，希望学习教育专业，成为一名教师。高考结束后，她计划在当地找一份工作，如果没有合适的暑期工，她打算摆摊卖凉粉，邀请大家到灌阳县游玩。",

    "text": "The upcoming year will be filled with blessings, at least that is what the numerical sequence of this New Year’s Eve date suggests.\nIf you take a closer look at the date, written as 12/31/23 or even 123123, you might see an angel number, which are repeating number sequence s, often used as a guide for deeper spiritual exploration. The numerical sequences can range anywhere from 000 to 999 , with each number having a distinct meaning and energy, USA Today previously reported.\nThe once-in-a-century date, which won’t be seen again on our calenders until Dec. 31, 2123, marks a new beginning. One, that asks us to “transform and evolve with the times and in the right place to embrace what is coming to us,” according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website.\nThe date has also sparked an online trend, with TikTok users creating videos on the significance of the number and merchandise commemorating the date selling online, including on platforms like Amazon , eBay and Etsy , the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA Today Network reported.\nHere’s what we know about the date.\nWhat does 12/31/23 signify within numerology? Numerology is an ancient esoteric science that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist Novalee Wilder shared with USA Today earlier this month.\n\"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\"\nThe numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number.\nProfessional astrologer Narayana Montúfar told Farmer’s Almanac that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.”\nIf you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12.\nThe number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated.\nFYI: How to keep your pets calm during New Year's Eve fireworks\nWhat are some dates to keep in mind in 2024? If you are an angel number enthusiast, there are a few key dates you might want to keep in mind as 2024 rapidly approaches.\nA palindrome, not unlike an angel number, is a term typically reserved for words or phrases that are spelled the same way backward as they are forward. Words like level, kayak, civic, and radar are among some of the most common palindromes, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.\nNumerical sequences seen in dates or times can also be palindromes, the most well-recognized ones being 3/20/23 or 11:11 , the website stated.\nHere are all palindrome dates that will occur in 2024, courtesy of the Farmer’s Almanac :\n4/2/24 4/20/24 4/21/24 4/22/24 4/23/24 4/24/24 4/25/24 4/26/24 4/27/24 4/28/24 4/29/24 Contributing: Olivia Munson, USA Today\n30 famous Capricorns you should know: These celebrities belong to the winter Zodiac sign",

    "title": "William & Mary receives grant to enhance internships – W&M News",
    "text": "Thanks to a new [grant](https://www.schev.edu/Home/Components/News/News/551/263), William & Mary will enhance the internship experience for undergraduates by pairing them with faculty mentors.\nThe $150,000 grant from the State Council for Higher Education for Virginia and the Virginia Talent + Opportunity Partnership will also help reduce the cost of credit-bearing courses associated with internships.\n“We know the value of internships and how important the relationships between faculty and students are in terms of professional growth,” said Philip D. Heavilin II, director of internships and applied learning in the Office of Career Development & Professional Engagement. “Classroom learning lays the foundation with knowledge and theory, while internships bring those lessons to life, offering real-world challenges that sharpen skills, build confidence, and bridge the gap between education and career.”\nSCHEV is the state’s coordinating agency for higher education. In total, this round of grant funding awarded $3.9 million to increase internship opportunities at 20 Virginia colleges and universities. This is the third grant W&M has received from SCHEV to amplify [internship programs](https://www.wm.edu/offices/career/students/applied-learning/internships-and-externships/) in the last 14 months.\nThe grants support W&M’s commitment to [Careers](https://www.wm.edu/about/administration/strategicplanning/vision2026/initiative-careers/), one of four cornerstone initiatives of the [Vision 2026](https://www.wm.edu/about/administration/strategicplanning/vision2026/) strategic plan. One of the goals of the initiative is to provide a funded internship or other applied learning experience for every undergraduate by 2026. In the latest Princeton Review report, William & Mary ranks among the top 10 public universities for internships. In 2023, Princeton Review named William & Mary the best public institution for internships for the third consecutive year.\nRemoving barriers to work experience\nIn summer 2023, leaders with the [Charles Center](https://www.wm.edu/as/charlescenter/) and the [Office of Career Development and Professional Engagement](https://www.wm.edu/offices/career/) collaborated with [Arts & Sciences](https://www.wm.edu/as/) faculty to develop a three-credit course for student interns.\n“The goal was to make sure each intern got the most possible out of their work experience by having faculty help students see the connection between a liberal arts education and what they’d be asked to do in a workplace,” said Elizabeth Harbron, director of the Charles Center.\nThe course solved one challenge – keeping track of who was doing what and how it went.\n“Having interns enroll in the course benefited them but also the overall internship effort,” Heavilin said. “Our students go off in so many directions, and it’s important to have a way of tracking them. The course becomes part of the student’s transcript, providing a means of tracking student participation in an applied learning experience.”\nOne of the goals of W&M’s internship program is to decrease financial and structural barriers to internships, prioritizing paid opportunities so students who need a summer job don’t have to choose between a valuable professional experience or seasonal work that will provide wages.\nRequiring students to enroll in a for-credit class as part of an internship meant costs for the student, including summer school fees.\n“It was hard to say you won this internship and you will be paid, but you’re going to have to pay summer school fees to do it,” Harbron said. The SCHEV grant will now allow the university to offer a one-credit course in summer 2025 that keeps the internship on a student’s record without making it a financial burden.\nThe grant will also provide a stipend for faculty who take on 10 to 15 interns as mentees during their summer internships. Heavilin estimates the additional funding will enable W&M to offer the one-credit course to up to 120 students.\nThe real value of internships\nWilliam & Mary has long been working to provide students with internship funding through such opportunities as the [Funding for Unpaid and Underfunded Student Experiences (F.U.S.E.) program](https://www.wm.edu/offices/career/students/funding-scholarship/fuse/).\nThe university saw an 86% increase in the number of students who received funding for unpaid and underfunded internship offerings between 2023 and 2024. This new SCHEV grant will allow W&M to expand those efforts and continue seeking ways to make internships equally accessible, reaching the Vision 2026 goal of funding an internship for every qualified undergraduate student by 2026.\nInternships offered to students run the gamut from art-related projects to scientific research to journalism and democracy initiatives. In total, about 24,878 internships are posted for W&M students each year.\nHeavilin notes that research continually shows that undergraduates who participate in internships have a higher rate of success finding jobs once they graduate, even if they choose a different career path than the one in the field of their internship.\n“We want students to try things,” he said. “Some things are going to work out and some are not. Each is equally valuable because it helps a student figure out what the next steps are. It’s difficult to make decisions when you’re not trying anything.”\nHarbron said she considers an internship a success even if it makes a student realize it’s “time to pivot.”\n“You want to discover that in time to tweak your coursework or change direction,” she said.\nSCHEV is particularly interested in exposing undergraduates to career paths in Virginia. “That’s a priority for them,” Heavilin said. “They want to help students engage in opportunities that are here, so students have a chance to see what the regional economy looks like.”\n[Susan Corbett](https://news.wm.edu/author/sacorbett/), Communications Specialist",

    "title": "CFMEU under administration jeopardises workers’ safety",
    "text": "The dangerous impacts of Labor’s forcible administration of the Construction Forestry and Maritime Employees Union (CFMEU) are being revealed. Construction workers are dying because some bosses believe they can now get away with flouting workplace safety procedures in a more reckless way. Just this month, two workers were killed at Vestas Wind Farm. One died at Golden Plans in Victoria and the other at Wambo in Queensland. Vestas, the largest wind turbine manufacturer in the world, regularly confronts the CFMEU over safety on the job. Zach Smith, CFMEU national secretary, said Vestas routinely ignores CFMEU Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) concerns and denies union access to sites. This is despite WorkSafe Victoria issuing 22 compliance notices to Vestas since March last year. Tim Gooden, spokesperson for Victorian Defend the Unions – Defend the CFMEU, said on November 24 that Vestas’ response to the tragic death of CFMEU member Jess Patience at Golden Plains on November 11 was an outrage. Patience’s body was left in full view, while police conducted interviews from a car boot and workers were drug and alcohol tested. Gooden thought this might be “so the company could try to blame other workers rather than its own procedures” for the tragedy. “It was only once the CFMEU was allowed on site that surviving workers were led from the scene and offered counselling to limit PTSD reactions,” Gooden said. “I’ve been a construction worker and CFMEU shop steward for 42 years and this is about the worst response by a company I’ve ever heard of.” Gooden said that the CFMEU, over decades, has been critical in improving OHS on construction sites. “We never allow the bosses to get away with lax responses to OHS issues. This is one of the reasons why we are under attack — over trumped-up charges of corruption and intimidation. “People have to realise that this is a tough industry, involving billions of dollars’ worth of profit,” Gooden continued. “Do you think the bosses would stop cutting corners and creating safety hazards, if we politely asked them to stop? No. “It’s the unity of our members, their readiness to stop working if there’s a problem and the commitment of our shop stewards and officials that has been decisive. “The media keeps vilifying us as ‘thugs’, who are overpaid and unproductive. But if we don’t go hard on safety, who will? What is a life worth?” International studies support Gooden’s view of the union’s important role. Editor of the British-based Hazards Magazine , Rory O’Neil said: “When it comes to challenging workplace harm, hygienists might have a measure of it and doctors a diagnosis for it, but only workers with collective power have much chance of doing anything about it. “And there is no shortage of up-to-the-minute evidence illustrating this ‘union safety effect’.” The newly-elected David Crisafulli Liberal National Party government in Queensland also thinks it can get away with more recklessly flouting workplace safety procedures. Construction workers rallied on November 27 in Magan-djin to oppose the LNP’s announcement it was suspending the Best Practice Industry Conditions (BPIC) agreement and reintroducing the 24-hour notice periods for union officials before they can enter a site over a suspected safety contravention. BPIC, which covers state government projects, includes a heat policy which says work must stop once the temperature reaches 35°C, or 29°C with 75% humidity. Gooden said workers are under a lot of heat stress in Queensland. “In 2023, construction worker Daniel Sa’u died and 25 workers were hospitalised from heat stress.” Glenn Newport died, in 2013, on a site near Roma, after working in more than 40°C heat. Newport’s mother, who led the November 27 rally, said if a heat policy had been followed, her son would still be alive. “These decisions are made by politicians who don’t know what it’s like to work in extreme conditions, who put workers in harm’s way from the comfort of an air-conditioned office. Heat stress kills and those in power have a responsibility to put people before profits,” she said . The Labor-appointed CFMEU administrator Mark Irving is also jeopardising safety by sacking CFMEU officials. On November 25, he dismissed Victorian CFMEU Health and Safety Organiser Esther Van Arend for alleged “menacing conduct”. Van Arend was allegedly involved in an altercation with journalist Nick McKenzie at a Coburg Cinema the previous weekend. McKenzie is widely known for his sensationalist reporting of the CFMEU on Channel 9’s 60 Minutes program, “Building Bad”. It was his unsubstantiated claims that precipitated Labor’s new law to put the CFMEU into administration. Social media posts supporting Van Arend indicate that her criticism of Irving at a recent CFMEU organisers’ meeting for denigrating the CFMEU in the media, may have triggered her sacking. They argue that there has been no procedural fairness, or natural justice, in her abrupt termination given that Irving allegedly did not ask her what had happened before acting. Green Left believes Van Arend will challenge her dismissal. The Defend the Unions – Defend the CFMEU is organising a public meeting titled “[Why we stand with the CFMEU – Your Rights under Attack ” on December 5 at 6.30pm at Coburg Town Hall, 90 Bell Street, Coburg. Speakers are: Independent Senator Fatima Payman; Jade Ingham, sacked former National President of the CFMEU (Construction) and Queensland Assistant State Secretary; and industrial lawyer, David Waters from Peacock and Waters Associates. Merri-Bek councillor Sue Bolton will be the chair.]",

    "title": "Holiday hopes, changing traditions — People share what means the most this holiday season and for 2024 - CBS New York",
    "text": "Bethlehem's public Christmas events for 2023 are canceled.\nThe birthplace of Jesus dimmed is perhaps a symbol. The message from local officials: There's less to celebrate this year.\nPeople of a variety of backgrounds and across faith traditions who spoke with CBS News about the holidays shared the many different ways they observe the holiday season. They all reflected on a few themes: unity, family, faith and hope, even as many noted conflict and issues causing deep divisions in the U.S. and across the globe that are casting a cloud over the normally joyful season.\nRenan Marinho, a pastor who most recently preached in Madison, Wisconsin, is focused on taking faith into 2024 as he prepares for Christmas celebrations at his new nondenominational Christian church in Florida.\n\"This holiday season, first of all, is having the manifestation of celebrating Jesus' birth,\" Marinho said.\n\"But the biggest reflection actually starts to happen when you go into New Year's Eve, into the New Year — because this is the moment where Christians get into a sense of being able to bring into the new season God with them in their side.\"\n\"Every aspect of my life this holiday is different,\" said Shai Mizrahi Nessim. The 26-year-old artist wore a metal decal around her neck for this interview with \"bring them back home\" edged onto it.\n\"We never appreciated so much having Hanukkah, so we can have the opportunity to long for miracles to have our hostages back home.\"\nNessim is keeping three things in mind during the holiday season: honoring her religion, creating unity and leading with empathy.\n\"It's something that maybe I'm going to have it more present than always because we never know what people are going through. This has been a very rough year for everybody,\" Nessim said.\n\"The Jewish Panamanian community, we stand strong with Israel, we stand strong with the IDF. We stand strong with all the families that are mourning around the world, and of innocent civilians, Palestinians too.\"\nOn this global holiday, Ruben Garcia, draws parallels to the Nativity story, alluding to Mary and Joseph's plight to find shelter before Jesus' birth.\nNow 75, Garcia, the director of Annunciation House, in El Paso, Texas, has helped immigrants since 1978.\n\"This time of Christmas, of the New Year, for them, it is an acknowledgment that God has allowed them to reach the border to arrive at the United States,\" Garcia said.\nAnnunciation House will continue to arrange some rarities on Christmas for people crossing the border in search of a brighter future: A meal with chicken, gifts for the children and blankets for the adults.\n\"You can't imagine how special that is for refugees who, as they cross through Mexico, oftentimes slept on the ground with literally nothing to cover themselves,\" Garcia said.\n\"It can be very, very moving to receive a gift.\"\nRoza Tawil, a lawyer with roots in Chicago, is one of many who put gifts in stark perspective this year.\n\"The people in Gaza are gonna tell you, 'My wish list is water,'\" Tawil said. \"My wish list is antibiotics, my wish list is food because they're starving.\"\nTawil, whose family is Palestinian and lives in the West Bank, says she feels like she lost a tooth – a hollow void she can't stop rubbing her tongue over.\nThe unfathomable loss of property, life, memories — \"It's just, it's so completely dystopian,\" Tawil said.\n\"When you can't see yourself in that person anymore, because their tragedy is just so extreme. It's beyond recognition to you, you start to think of it as fiction almost, and you no longer resonate with them.\"\nTawil's family in the West Bank is Muslim and usually volunteers with the Christmas festivities in the Holy Land, as do Palestinians of different religions. There's camaraderie among the Palestinian Muslims and Christians in Bethlehem, she said — during Ramadan, Christians will wake up their Muslim neighbors to eat before sunup and the fast begins.\n\"You bring both together to create a full circle of what it really means to be in the holy place,\" she said.\nBut this year, with public Christmas celebrations canceled because of the conflict in Gaza and in solidarity, they won't be volunteering.\nTo many, unity during the holidays means connecting with family.\nSeph MacAndrew, 26, was raised in a nondenominational church, but now honors Christmas traditions outside of religion, seeing as holy the holiday moments shared — laughter, watching movies together and distributing their father's holiday tips from his job as a postal carrier, which the family calls \"second Christmas.\"\n\"We always look forward to that because everyone loves cash,\" MacAndrew said.\nIt's those little things that bring Christmas and the growing family together — MacAndrew has 11 nieces and nephews, and a sister who is pregnant — and \"Every Christmas, that builds into the junk drawer of traditions that we have.\"\nThose kinds of small happenings can help people in the LGBTQ+ community move Christmas from a more capitalist, heteronormative, religious celebration to a more individually meaningful one, says MacAndrew, who identifies as queer.\n\"Renew and regroup what Christmas means to you,\" McAndrew said about holiday traditions. \"Which sounds so Hallmark and corny, but having that meaning for yourself individually, whether it's new traditions or even just like, you know, finding new ways to celebrate.\"\nMacAndrew's holiday celebrations keep changing, and in 2024, so will the tips: \"My dad's gonna be retiring next year.\"\nFor Roni Mosakowski, this holiday will not be huge.\n\"I'm not physically with most of my family, whether it's to distance or loss,\" the New York resident told CBS News.\nShe will celebrate with her daughters, finding ways to incorporate their memories of her husband Sam, who died in 2015.\n\"We tend to make it special by acknowledging the people that aren't there to decorate and celebrate with us,\" Mosakowski said. \"So we have ornaments with pictures of my late husband.\"\nSammy, Mosakowski's oldest daughter, takes the lead on memorializing her dad during the holidays. She still hangs his stocking, which is filled with new Christmas cards, in her bedroom.\n\"We've started to kind of add in things that are less painful for me,\" her mother said. \"Not as much of the old things that trigger my memories, but more of the new things that we now do to celebrate and incorporate him.\"\nNew additions — and new traditions — remain constant for many during the holidays.\nThis year, Leela Harpur Heyder and Gunther Heyder became parents to now-7-month-old Zahara. On Christmas, they wanted to turn a gift into an experience and a memory, Harpur Hayder said.\n\"We're basically taking a pause for the three of us to be together in a van and travel around New Zealand, North Island and South Island, getting out in nature as much as we can and just being together,\" Harpur Heyder said.\nThe Heyders, together for 10 years, don't want to grow old waiting for moments that make for lasting memories.\n\"The main focus of this trip is just to spend time with each other, be present and just hopefully surf away, catch some fish and hike some beautiful sceneries,\" Heyder said.\nAnd for many people, coming together for the holidays means around the table, over traditional foods. For Francisco Treviño, who runs a Hispanic cultural center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that's tamales, buñuelos — sweet fried treats — and champurrado, a type of hot chocolate.\nThe holiday treats take him back to when he was a child in Mexico, he said — and are part of the traditions he's trying to pass on to his community's children, which include the posadas celebrations.\n\"We sit them down and explain to them why we do las posadas and of course, without missing the true significance of celebrating las posadas.\"\nPosadas celebrates Mary and Joseph's journey to Bethlehem during December. The massive events ignite the holiday season for families across Latin America, which lasts through Jan. 6 for some, known as Epiphany or Dia de los Reyes, the day of the three wise men, known as Los Tres Reyes Magos.\nIn Mexico, Spain and many other countries, families exchange presents then, commemorating the gifts given to Jesus in the Nativity story.",

    "title": "Fome de electricidade leva Google, Amazon e Microsoft à energia atómica",
    "text": "Grandes empresas tecnológicas investem no nuclear para ter energia para alimentar o crescimento dos centros de dados e da inteligência artificial. EUA apoiam renascimento da indústria do átomo. Os “tech bros” estão a apostar em força na energia do átomo, para alimentar a fome voraz de electricidade dos centros de dados usados para treinar a inteligência artificial: a Google e, agora, a Amazon anunciaram ter assinado acordos com outras empresas para desenvolver a tecnologia dos pequenos reactores nucleares – muito falada como o futuro do nuclear civil, mas que ainda não existe. A primeira a anunciar os seus planos foi a Microsoft, que investiu na empresa que desenhou o ChatGPT, a OpenAI. Anunciou já em Setembro ter assinado um contrato de duas décadas com a Constellation Energy, para reabrir a central nuclear de Three Mile Island – onde houve o pior acidente nuclear civil nos Estados Unidos, em 1979 –, para obter energia nuclear para os centros de dados . Como resultado de todo este interesse dos patrões da tecnologia, as acções da Oklo, uma startup nuclear participada pelo patrão da OpenAI , Sam Altman , subiram 100%. O mesmo aconteceu com outras empresas da área, como a NuScale, uma empresa do Oregon que tem autorização da Comissão Reguladora Nuclear dos Estados Unidos para desenvolver projectos de pequenos reactores modulares – SMR, na sigla em inglês, que, além de menor dimensão, deveriam ser mais seguros do que os actuais –, embora não espere concretizar nenhum projecto até ao final da década. Na segunda-feira, foi a vez de a Google revelar um acordo firmado com a Kairos Power para ter SMR a funcionar a partir de 2030, sintetiza a Reuters. Por fim, a Amazon anunciou na quarta-feira ter assinado acordos com as empresas X-Energy e Dominion Energy para explorar o desenvolvimento de SMR. Estes investimentos surgem porque as grandes empresas tecnológicas procuram electricidade produzida sem emissões de dióxido de carbono (que aumentam o efeito de estufa e causam as alterações climáticas) para alimentar a expansão dos negócios da inteligência artificial e outras áreas. Precisam de electricidade para pôr a funcionar os https://www.publico.pt/2023/04/26/azul/noticia/data-centers-podem-problema-ponto-vista-ambiental-2047493 e também para refrigerar estas imensas instalações de servidores. Depois de investirem em energias renováveis, estão agora a virar-se para o nuclear – alimentando mais uma vez a expectativa de um renascimento da indústria do átomo, marcada por vários acidentes que reduziram a sua aceitação: Three Mile Island, Tc hernobil , Fukushima . Limpa? De \"baixo carbono\" A electricidade nuclear é “limpa”, se falarmos de emissões de carbono, embora seja “suja” em vários outros sentidos: produz resíduos radioactivos (para os quais ainda não há uma solução definitiva), os riscos de uma indústria cuja origem é militar e, além do potencial catastrófico de um acidente , acarreta ainda o de proliferação de armas nucleares. Por isso, é referida como uma tecnologia \" sustentável \", de “baixo carbono”, em vez de “verde” ou “renovável”, como a energia solar ou do vento. A procura global por electricidade deve crescer, em média, 3,4% por ano até 2026, segundo um relatório da Agência Internacional de Energia (AIE). Mas o consumo de energia eléctrica pelos centros de dados , inteligência artificial e sector das criptomoedas pode duplicar até 2026. Vejamos: ao nível global, o consumo de electricidade dos centros de dados atingiu um valor estimado de 460 terawatt-horas (TWh) em 2022, segundo a AIE. Mas, em 2026, pode chegar a 1000TWh. “Esta procura é mais ou menos o equivalente a todo o consumo de electricidade do Japão”, diz o relatório, que faz apelo à modernização tecnológica, eficiência e regulamentação para moderar esta forme eléctrica. As grandes empresas tecnológicas comprometeram-se a usar só energias limpas até 2030 – mas isso foi antes da explosão da inteligência artificial, que exige cada vez mais energia, recorda o New York Times. Um relatório da empresa de serviços financeiros Morgan Stanley de Setembro estimava que a indústria dos centros de dados vai emitir 2500 milhões de toneladas de gases de estufa a mais até ao fim da década, o que é três vezes mais do que seria se a inteligência artificial generativa não tivesse sido inventada. Outro relatório, da consultora IDC, estima que o consumo de energia vai aumentar 44,7% durante o mesmo período até 2027, por causa da procura de serviços da inteligência artificial. A Administração de Joe Biden tem apoiado o investimento na energia nuclear como uma alternativa livre de emissões de carbono. Em Março, o Congresso dos EUA aprovou legislação destinada a apoiar o desenvolvimento de uma nova geração de reactores nucleares. Hoje, a energia nuclear fornece 18% da electricidade nos EUA. Mas apenas três reactores entraram em funcionamento desde 1996 – o maior problema, além das preocupações sobre a segurança, é o custo da construção de centrais nucleares. Frequentemente, os projectos que têm sido edificados demoram o dobro do tempo previsto a serem construídos, e a factura aumenta na mesma proporção.",

    "text": "El español Carlos Sainz alzó este viernes su cuarto Dakar en una jornada en la que se citó con el olimpo del automovilismo, ese que forman nombres como el alemán Michael Schumacher, el brasileño Ayrton Senna o el francés Stéphane Peterhansel, y se convirtió, más si cabe, en leyenda de este deporte. Sainz y su infatigable compañero de sufrimiento, el catalán Lucas Cruz, copiloto del madrileño, hicieron historia al convertirse en los primeros corredores en convertir un coche híbrido en campeón del Dakar, un hito inimaginable a la altura de que un piloto de 61 años, como los que tiene Sainz, alce su cuarto Touareg. Lo hizo, además, con contundencia, pues tras la avería del francés Sébastien Loeb durante la jornada de este jueves, el español terminó la prueba con más de una hora y veinte minutos sobre el belga Guillaume de Mevius (Toyota), segundo clasificado por delante de Loeb, que acabó en el tercer escalón del podio. A pesar de no ganar ninguna etapa, el piloto madrileño y el copiloto catalán se exhibieron durante buena parte del Dakar y, en las tres etapas más complicadas, fueron los grandes protagonistas. Quedaron segundos de una primera jornada llena de piedras y pinchazos, segundos en la sexta, una crono de 48 horas por el mayor desierto de arena del último y terceros en la penúltima, otra maratón de piedras en la que Sainz bajó el ritmo tras ver la avería de Loeb, consciente de que ya nadie podría acercarse a sus tiempos de la general.

    "text": "The body of missing college student Riley Strain was recovered from the Cumberland River in Tennessee on Friday. BOISE, Idaho — It should be a cloudy day around the region. Conditions should remain dry for most, if not all of southwest Idaho. Highs will warm a few degrees ahead of tomorrow's front. Look for highs in the mid to upper 60s today. Saturday's storm will bring widespread rain to the area. Models show the heaviest rain will fall in the first half of the day. After the period of heavy rain, look for scattered showers to continue into Saturday night. We may see some spotty showers continue into the early hours on Sunday morning. After that, look for a mix of sun and clouds for the rest of the day. Highs will cool in the upper 50s tomorrow. Highs should stay in the low to mid-50s into early next week. The pattern will remain unsettled as we enter next week. We could see some more showers on Monday and Tuesday, but models show that widespread rain will likely hold on until Wednesday. Stay tuned!",
