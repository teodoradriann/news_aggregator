Affected workers include business analysts, data engineers, designers, lawyers and software engineers.\nBlock shed its San Francisco headquarters designation but has its biggest office in Oakland. It is cutting 391 workers for “strategy” reasons and 460 for “performance,” according to the memo by Dorsey. Another 80 managers are being laid off, while 193 managers are becoming individual contributors.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nAnother 748 job listings are being scrapped.\nDorsey denied that the layoffs were due to financial reasons or artificial intelligence, instead citing “our needs around strategy, raising the bar and acting faster on performance, and flattening our org.“\nBlock did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its products include Cash App, Square and Tidal. The company also laid off around 1,000 workers in January 2024.\nBlock’s stock is down almost 32% this year and fell another 3.7% on Wednesday. The company’s fourth quarter earnings missed analyst expectations.\nIn other local tech layoffs, Niantic said it was laying off 68 workers in San Francisco after agreeing to a $3.5 billion sale of its games division to Scopely. The deal requires regulatory approval.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nAppLovin Corp. also said it was laying off 97 workers in Palo Alto, according to a state filing.\nReach Roland Li: roland.li@sfchronicle.com; X: @rolandlisf",

    "text": "Forgot Username or Password Date (MENAFN- Jordan Times) DUBAI - A record 2.5 million jobs were created in the renewable energy sector in 2023, most of them in China, the International Renewable Energy Agency and International Labour Organisation (ILO) said on Tuesday. Nearly two-thirds of the world's new solar and wind power capacity was installed in China, which added a total of 1.84 million renewable energy jobs, they said. Global employment in the industry rose 18 per cent from 13.7 million to 16.2 million, Abu Dhabi-based IRENA and the ILO, a United Nations agency, said in a joint report. But the report raised concerns about an \"uneven global picture\" with China accounting for 7.4 million jobs or 46 per cent of the total. The sector employs 1.8 million people in the European Union, 1.56 million in Brazil and nearly a million in the United States and India. However, \"despite immense resource potential\", Africa had only 324,000 renewable energy jobs as of last year, the report said. \"The story of the energy transition and its socio-economic gains should not be about one or two regions,\" IRENA director-general Francesco La Camera was quoted as saying. \"If we are all to fulfil our collective pledge to triple renewable power capacity by 2030, the world must step up its game and support marginalised regions in addressing barriers impeding their transitions progress.\" The goal of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 was set at last year's COP28 UN climate talks in Dubai. The report said solar panels, or solar photovoltaics, are the biggest employer with 7.2 million jobs globally, including 4.6 million in China. Liquid biofuels employ 2.8 million, one-third of them in Brazil, while hydropower jobs shrank slightly from 2.5 million in 2022 to 2.3 million last year. China and Europe accounted for 52 and 21 per cent respectively of the world's 1.5 million wind-power jobs, the report said.
