    "text": "Nelliyampathy, often known as the 'Poor Man's Ooty' for its cool climate, is experiencing a significant decline in tourist footfall due to scorching temperatures. With a recorded high of 34 degrees celsius on Wednesday, it marked the peak of this year's heatwave. Nelliyampathy, which generally has cooler nights, has seen a rise in temperature during the nights this season. The months of November and December, which usually show a temperature of 10-12 degrees celsius, now jumped to 14-16 degrees. Currently Nelliyampathy’s daily temperature at night is 19 degree celsius. It is pointed out that, the shedding of leaves of the trees in the forest regions which causes the rocks and soil getting hot under the scorching son, is another reason for the nights getting hotter. Wild animals like elephants are also moving out of their habitat due to the dried up streams and waterfalls. They are reaching out to check dams and Karappara river near farm areas to drink water. Farmers and other land owners have started complaining that the changed climate has already affected the crops. Since the days have become hotter, many farm owners have started irrigating their farms. Resorts and hotels in that area have also started installing fans due to the heat. Their business too have got affected as there is a significant decline in the number of tourists visiting Nelliyampathy this season.",

    "text": "Reform UK leader and Clacton candidate Nigel Farage has said he is “dismayed by the reported comments,” ITV News Political Correspondent Harry Horton reports A Reform UK campaigner has been filmed saying migrants crossing the Channel should be used as “target practice”. The same campaigner, out in the Essex seaside constituency of Clacton, used a racial slur against Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in footage recorded by a Channel 4 undercover reporter. Another campaigner was filmed describing the LGBT Pride flag as a “degenerate” ensign. Reform UK leader and Clacton candidate Nigel Farage has said he is “dismayed by the reported comments” and confirmed the individuals would no longer campaign with him. An undercover reporter for Channel 4 News captured canvasser Andrew Parker talking about people coming ashore at Deal in Kent, at the eastern end of the English Channel.Mr Parker said: “Army recruitment – get the young recruits there, with guns, on the f beach, target practice. F just shoot them.” The canvasser also used a racial slur against Mr Sunak and labelled Islam a “disgusting cult”.Responding to the report, Mr Farage said in a statement: “I am dismayed by the reported comments of a handful of people associated with my local campaign, particularly those who are volunteers. They will no longer be with the campaign.“The appalling sentiments expressed by some in these exchanges bear no relation to my own views, those of the vast majority of our supporters or Reform UK policy. Some of the language used was reprehensible. “Reform UK is a party for everybody who believes in Britain. I am proud that our supporters, candidates and national campaign team come from all backgrounds and identities.“I would be interested to know whether Channel 4 is subjecting the grassroots volunteers of all the political parties to similar subterfuges, or whether Reform UK has been singled out for special attention.”Mr Parker said in a statement, sent to Channel 4 News: “I would like to make it clear that neither Nigel Farage personally or the Reform Party are aware of my personal views on immigration.” He added: “I have never discussed immigration with either Nigel Farage or the Reform Party and that any comments made by me during those recordings are my own personal views on any subject I commented on. At no time before I was sent out to canvass did I discuss my personal views with any representative of the Reform Party UK or Nigel Farage. “I would therefore like to apologise profusely to Nigel Farage and the Reform Party if my personal views have reflected badly on them and brought them into disrepute as this was not my intention. “I offered to help the Reform Party on their canvassing as I believe that they are the only party that offer the UK voter a practical solution to the illegal immigration problem that we have in the UK.” Have you heard our new podcast Talking Politics?

By the end of the quarter, F-series truck sales totaled 573,370, surpassing General Motors Co ‘s Silverado by a substantial margin of 169,949 trucks.\nThis positive trend in F-series sales is pivotal, marking the first instance of year-on-year growth since 2018. F-series sales have been dropping rapidly over the last few years.\nHowever, this success comes amid challenges, including a historic six-week labor union strike that impacted all of Detroit’s “Big Three” automakers. Ford, despite reaching an agreement, incurred significant costs.\nFurthermore, Ford’s decision to slash production of the F-150 Lightning, despite record sales in November, underscores the challenges in navigating changing market demands.\nAdditionally, reports indicate that about 400 Ford dealers, who initially joined the EV program announced last year, are now opting out due to stringent investment criteria and other membership conditions.\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.\nRead More: ‘Wrong Frame Of Reference:' Elon Musk Rebuts Tesla Bear For Saying EV Stock Is ‘Egregiously Overvalued' Through Toyota Lens\n© 2023 Benzinga.com.

    "title": "NATO's 2023 Year in Review: Strengthened Defense and Expansion Efforts | NewsTrack English 1",
    "text": "BRUSSELS:In a year marked by dynamic shifts, the 31-nation military alliance, NATO, dedicated significant efforts to fortify defense measures and reinforce deterrence, particularly in support of Ukraine against Russia. Notably, NATO welcomed Finland as its 31st member, marking its ninth expansion. The year began with a clear focus on Ukraine, following the strained relations with Russia in the preceding year. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO's Secretary-General since 2014, had his term extended to October 2024 due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, highlighting the evolving security landscape in Europe. Stoltenberg emphasized the need for increased defense investment among NATO allies, with multiple meetings throughout the year prioritizing defense and readiness levels of NATO forces. NATO and its allies remained steadfast in supporting Ukraine, providing essential aid such as air defense systems, heavy weaponry, and crucial supplies like fuel and communication devices. Tanks, including Abrams from the US, Challenger 2 from the UK, and Leopard 2 from Germany, were delivered to Ukraine, bolstering its defense capabilities. The alliance also facilitated F-16 training for Ukrainian pilots in allied countries, paving the way for the delivery of fighter jets in the upcoming year. In efforts to strengthen relations, the NATO-Ukraine Council held meetings at both leader and foreign minister levels, signaling NATO's commitment to Ukraine's future inclusion once specific conditions are met and the conflict resolves. Collaboration with the European Union (EU) received particular attention, with joint efforts against shared threats from Russia and China highlighted in a joint statement. Discussions centered on increasing ammunition production and supporting Ukraine through combined procurement strategies. Amid the conflict, NATO restructured its defense plans, expanding combat groups in eight countries along its eastern flank and increasing troop deployment to 40,000. Additionally, large-scale military exercises like \"Air Defender 2023\" involved over 250 aircraft and 10,000 personnel from 25 countries, showcasing NATO's preparedness. Key changes to NATO's defense plans, including the approval of deploying 300,000 troops to its eastern flank within 30 days, were endorsed during the NATO summit in Vilnius. Emphasis was placed on urging member countries to boost defense spending and industry production to implement these plans effectively. The summit held in Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, underscored the significance of NATO's presence in a region historically close to Russia, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joining NATO leaders. Moreover, the year witnessed Finland's accession as the 31st NATO member, while Sweden's membership discussions continued with technical meetings and the signing of the Accession Protocol, further bolstering the alliance. In response to escalating tensions, NATO sent additional troops to Kosovo, highlighting its commitment to stability in the Western Balkans. The emergence of China as a focal point in NATO's discussions was notable, with concerns raised about its actions and cooperation with Russia. Discussions involving nations like Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea emphasized the need to address China's evolving military capabilities and its alignment with Russian interests. NATO's focus on strengthening defense, expanding membership, and addressing emerging global challenges characterized its actions in 2023, marking a year of significant developments and strategic initiatives for the alliance.
