    "text": "Here is a list of the number of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime offences recorded by police forces from October 7 to November 7 2023 inclusive, together with totals for the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021.\nThe figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests sent to all forces in the UK.\nThe data is a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and may be subject to change.\nAll figures are for crimes recorded by police forces, not incidents.\nSystems and methods of recording and collating hate crime are not consistent across all forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the volume of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nSome forces provided notes and responses to the data and these are included where appropriate.\nNot all forces are included in the list and reasons for omissions are given at the end.\n– Avon & Somerset\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5\nThe force said that completion of the “hate type” field on its records is not mandatory. Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed.\n– Bedfordshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3\n– British Transport Police\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22\n– Cambridgeshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5\nThe force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime.\n– Dorset\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1\n– Durham\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1\nThe force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam.\n– Gloucestershire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nThe force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”.\n– Greater Manchester\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34\nThe force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish. Islamophobic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Muslim. More than one perceived religion can be recorded for an offence. Four crimes within the data had both Jewish and Muslim recorded as the perceived targeted religion.\n– Gwent\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3\nThe force said that to obtain the data a filter was applied to identify racial and religious strands and a manual trawl was conducted on the crime summaries.\n– Hampshire & Isle of Wight\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 5, 2023 – 6\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 4\n– Hertfordshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 17\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nThe force said the figures are for crimes that have a “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” (or both) flag attributed to the investigation record.\n– Humberside\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 2\n– Kent\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 6\nThe force said the figures are for crime reports with either the “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” prejudice marker attached. Markers are optional and added at the discretion of the inputting officer.\n– Lancashire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 4\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3\nThe force said the figures had been compiled by searching for hate crimes marked as religious, followed by a manual review of each recorded crime to extract only those that were antisemitic and Islamophobic.\n– Leicestershire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 17, 2023 – 6\n– Merseyside\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 20\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 10\nThe force said 18 of the 20 antisemitic offences in 2023 are conflict related and one of the 10 Islamophobic offences in 2023 is conflict related.\n– Norfolk\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 0\n– North Wales\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3\n– North Yorkshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 2\nThe force said the numbers are for offences “reported” to the police.\n– Northamptonshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 1\nThe force said the figures show crimes with a racial or religious flag against them, where the search was for the words “Jewish” “Hebrew” “Judaistic”, “Hasidic”, “Islam” and “Muslim”. The search only returned exact matches and does not account for differences in terminology and/or spelling used. The force added that keyword searches are problematic and in no way provide accurate results or figures.\n– Northumbria\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 10, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 9\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 7, 2023 – 5\nThe force said the figures were for offences flagged as “Judaism” and “Islam” and that hate crimes are based on the perception of the victim.\n– Nottinghamshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – under 5, 2023 – 19\nThe force said all crimes have a religious and/or belief marker.\n– South Wales\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 8\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 7, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 9\nThe force said the figures are for occurrences with the qualifier of “Hate/prejudice – anti-Jewish” and “Hate/prejudice anti-Muslim”.\n– Suffolk\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 0\n– Surrey\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 10\nThe force noted that offences are flagged as hate crimes at the discretion of the police officer or staff member.\n– Thames Valley\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 21\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 12, 2022 – 14, 2023 – 20\n– Warwickshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nIslamophobic: No information held\nThe force said the figures were obtained by searching for all crimes with a marker of “Hate Motivated – Religion – Jewish” and “Hate Motivated – Religion – Muslim” during the stated periods.\n– West Mercia\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 4\n– West Midlands\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 22\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 23, 2022 – 33, 2023 – 25\nThe force said the figures were obtained by searching for the hate strands “Religion – Judaism” and “Religion – Islam”.\n– West Yorkshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 10, 2023 – 53\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 38, 2022 – 29, 2023 – 49\nThe force said the figures represent the number of faith hate crimes recorded where Islam or Judaism was identified as the religion targeted. The force added: “We continue to work to better improve the investigation of hate crime and the outcomes for victims. The force has specialist hate crime co-ordinators who assist investigating officers in identifying perpetrators, providing after-care support for victims and working with communities to increase awareness of hate crime and reporting mechanisms. They also engage in joint working with partners such as local authorities, Victim Support and third-party Hate Incident Reporting Centres.”\n– Wiltshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5\nSome 15 forces are not included in this list.

    "title": "Purple States Take Note: Youngkin Saves Virginia From the Tyranny of California’s Gas Car Ban",
    "text": "July 02, 2024\nGovernor Glenn Youngkin announced recently that Virginia would decouple from California’s onerous mandate requiring all new vehicles sold in the Commonwealth to be electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles (EVs) by 2035. This regulation—a ban on sales of new gas, diesel and traditional hybrid vehicles—promulgated by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), would have taken effect as soon as next year when 35% of all model year 2026 cars sold would be required to meet California’s definition of “zero emission.”\nThis all stems from a 2021 bill championed by then-Governor Northam and his allies in the General Assembly. They enacted policy directing the Virginia Air Pollution Control Board (APCB) to adopt regulations tying Virginia law to California’s vehicle emission standards. And if you can believe it, the law was intentionally exempted from the Administrative Process Act, denying Virginians any opportunity to give input on the regulatory process and dodging larger economic review for the policy.\nIt sounds brazen, but that’s exactly what happened: the previous administration in Richmond put Virginia vehicle policy in the hands of Californians.\nIn November 2022, California finalized entirely new regulations at the direction of their Governor Gavin Newsom. Under the new California policy, selling any new gas, diesel, flex-fuel or traditional hybrid cars and trucks would be unlawful and subject to severe penalties, whether in California or in states aligned with California.\nCalifornia’s gas car ban would have been devastating for Virginia drivers and small businesses and damaging to U.S. national security. Consumers would have paid dearly under the ban, facing higher costs in both the new and used car markets and finding more and more vehicles simply priced out of reach for families. Any compliance penalties levied on automakers—roughly $20,000 per vehicle—would also likely be passed on to Virginia consumers.\nThe absurd and un-American mandate to “go electric” on California’s timeline would also have increased Virginia’s and the U.S. dependence on China, since China controls the global EV battery and mineral supply chain.\nMake no mistake: criticism of California’s gas car ban and EV mandate policies—and fervent opposition to the spread of those policies in the Commonwealth of Virginia and to any other state—should not be construed as an indictment of EVs themselves. EVs are a good choice for many Americans, and if those cars and trucks work for a family’s needs and fit within their budgets, that’s wonderful. Families have every right to make the choice to buy an EV, but no government mandate should compel them toward that purchase or restrict their access to other vehicle options.\nWhen the stakes are absolutely clear and the choice is between government mandates and consumer freedom, the right move is to err on the side of consumers. And that’s exactly what Governor Youngkin did when he chose to end California’s control over the vehicles that can and cannot be sold in Virginia. Virginia drivers, not California regulators 3,000 miles away, should be able to choose for themselves which vehicles to purchase. When people are free to choose, they make decisions that work best for them, their businesses and their families.\nOther states tethered to California’s EV mandate should follow Governor Youngkin’s bold and necessary leadership and free their residents, too, from the tyranny of California’s gas car ban.\nChet Thompson is president and CEO of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM). He previously served as deputy general counsel for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency during the George W. Bush administration and was a partner at Crowell and Moring, where he chaired the Environment and Natural Resources Group.\nThis article was originally published by RealClearEnergy and made available via RealClearWire.",

    "title": "How Dan James became the 'main man' for Leeds United and Wales - BBC Sport",
    "text": "How James became the 'main man' for Leeds and Wales\n- Published\n2026 World Cup qualifying: Wales v Kazakhstan\nVenue: Cardiff City Stadium Date: Saturday, 22 March Kick-off: 19:45 GMT\nCoverage: Watch on BBC One Wales, iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app, plus S4C via iPlayer. Text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app. Listen live on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Sport Extra.\nEight games from winning promotion to the Premier League. Eight fixtures standing in-between Wales and the 2026 World Cup.\nLeeds United's Dan James knows he could about to have the year of his life.\nFortunately for club and country, he's having the season of his life.\nOnce widely criticised for lacking end product, he is now on track for a career-best tally of goals and assists in a single campaign.\n\"Outstanding,\" Daniel Farke has said of someone who has become integral to Championship leaders Leeds' bid to return to the top-flight, a player happy to carry the weighty Elland Road expectations of success.\nCraig Bellamy will be hoping for just as much attacking influence on the international stage as Wales plot their path to north America.\nAnd James is not shying away from it.\n\"I'm not a young player anymore,\" he says. \"I want to try and be that main man.\"\nBut, even for a player of electrifying pace, getting to that stage has taken some time.\n- Published10 hours ago\n- Published2 days ago\n- Published2 days ago\n'Too good for the Championship'\nMaybe because he still appears somewhat fresh-faced, it's easy to forget how much 27-year-old James has already packed into his career.\nFrom his acceleration onto the scene as a teenager at Swansea City, there have been two major finals, 55 caps, and two £20m-plus moves since.\nBut there have also been crushing disappointments to deal with. From losing his father Kevan just weeks before completing a dream move to Manchester United in 2019, to the missed penalty that denied Wales shoot-out qualification for Euro 2024.\nThere was even the fact Leeds – who he joined for £25m in 2021 - had seemingly washed their hands of him, sending him out on loan to Fulham a year later.\nIt added to questions of whether the winger could cut it at the top level, something he was denied at answering when – back at Leeds – he was part of a side that lost last year's play-off final to Southampton.\n\"It would have been quite easy for him to have come back and think he was not wanted, that his days were numbered, and it was all against him,\" says Jon Newsome, a title-winner at Leeds.\n\"But he got his head down and become a better player. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better performer for Leeds. He's too good for the Championship.\"\nTen goals and nine assists – already just one goal contribution shy of last year's total - suggests he is right.\nFlourishing in the \"heavy\" Leeds shirt\nJames' frightening speed has always made him a dangerous player.\nOr \"menacing\" as Bellamy once described him, having been without him for the first four games of his unbeaten start to life as Wales manager in the successful Nations League campaign.\nBut there is more to James' game now. A hardened mindset has seemingly brought a sharper edge – and, to use an adjective James repeatedly used about his improvements – a more \"ruthless\" player.\n\"As a winger I want to be as direct as possible, not turning things down,\" he says of what's changed, besides staying injury-free.\n\"Sometimes I look back at games and I've been quite safe. That might look good from the outside, keeping the ball, but ultimately I'm in the team to try and create things. That constant mindset of 'can I get a goal or an assist?' – and believing that.\n\"And when you do give the ball away, it's so important the reaction is to want it again.\n\"You might get tackled nine times out of ten but it's about that tenth time where something will happen, and I'm trying to keep that mindset.\"\nIt's been noticed. Leeds fans have found a new hero, James stepping into the space left when Crysencio Summerville moved to West Ham United last summer.\n\"There's definitely a difference this season,\" says Newsome, a co-commentator with BBC Radio Leeds.\n\"His final ball and end product is a lot better. He realises his assets - like that pace - and uses them to their best at every opportunity, but there's a maturity to his play.\n\"There's the responsibility of being an older player now, and suddenly the main man and coping with the expectation.\n\"The Leeds shirt can be heavy to wear at times, and it's too much for some. He's flourished.\"\nAn unlikely leader\nThat comfort in being the go-to attacking hope has seen James' confidence levels rocket, as well as new leadership qualities shine.\nFarke says it's less about speeches but about work-rate, setting standards – music to the ears of Bellamy whose Wales team have similar pass, press and pace-filled principles.\n\"When you start the press off you can get the boys up for it on the pitch rather than off it,\" says James, who adds he's happy with the added responsibility at club and country.\n\"It doesn't add any pressure. There's games where things you try maybe don't go right, but you just continue to try and do the right stuff and keep trying to be that main man.\"\nIt's a trait James says he looked up to in Bellamy when the manager was himself an explosive attacker in the red of Wales.\nHaving only just shaken off a hamstring injury when he met up with the new-look Wales for the first time in November, James is eager to show he has soaked up the advice of an individual he takes inspiration from.\n\"He had that work-rate and he always wanted the ball, demanded the ball,\" he says.\n\"He wants the same from us, but the biggest thing I've tried to take into my game is to always get at your man.\n\"It's easy to get the ball, pass backwards when things aren't going right - and much tougher when it hasn't gone right to have the mindset of going again.\n\"Sometimes there's a risk of players or the crowd getting on you – but not here and the manager has your back.\"\nA manager and a player of 'ruthless mentality'\nIt all suggests Wales' adrenaline-fuelled style that saw them top their Nations League group is going to carry on into the World Cup campaign.\nAnd with James ready to embody the ethos when the World Cup campaign kicks off against Kazakhstan in Cardiff – and prepared be the main man, just as Bellamy once was.\n\"Exactly, that was him as a player; he had that ruthless mentality, he believed he was going to win the game for the team,\" he says, perhaps conscious that Wales will be missing another key and in-form attacker in the injured Harry Wilson.\n\"To have that person behind you, to put you in the situations to go and effect games and show your attributes, that's brilliant to know as a player.\"\nAnd a knowledge that could see James' impressive improvements continue in what could be a memorable year for club and country.",
