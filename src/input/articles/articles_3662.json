    "title": "'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' Star Teddi Mellencamp Gives Emotional Update on Cancer Journey",
    "text": "Reality TV star Teddi Mellencamp shared an emotional update in her ongoing cancer journey Wednesday, revealing that all of her tumors have either shrunk or disappeared.\n“Honestly, the crying is already done, but I just finished with all of my scans and my tumors have significantly shrunk, which doctors believe means that this all will work and that I will be back to myself and feeling good,” Mellencamp, 43, said in a video posted to her Instagram.\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum initially revealed her cancer diagnosis in February, disclosing that she had been experiencing “severe and debilitating” headaches for weeks before going to the hospital for a scan.\n“After a CT scan and MRI, doctors found multiple tumors on my brain, which they believe have been growing for at least 6 months,” Mellencamp shared in another Instagram post at the time, adding that two of her tumors would be immediately surgically removed while others would be treated with radiation.\nThe media personality frequently gave updates on her cancer journey on social media and shared in March that her melanoma had also metastasized, or spread, to her lungs.\nIn her update Wednesday, Mellencamp, who is also the daughter of singer-songwriter John Mellencamp, said that she still has two more sessions of immunotherapy remaining and then “hopefully I am done, and I will be cancer-free.”\n“I’m going to keep a positive outlook because that’s the way my doctor just spoke to me. He’s like, ‘You did this, you got this,’” she continued. “‘You got that Mellencamp blood, so you’re good.’”\nMellencamp is a mom to three children, Slate, Cruz, and Dove, whom she welcomed with her husband Edwin Arroyave. She’s widely known for being a main cast member on Real Housewives between 2017 and 2020, before appearing as a guest from 2021 and onward.",

    "text": "Partager: Le mouvement libanais Hezbollah a déclaré avoir lancé jeudi plusieurs dizaines de missiles sur la ville israélienne de Safed, en réponse aux attaques israéliennes sur le Liban. Le même jour, Israël a lancé 115 assauts aériens au total, qui ont causé la mort d'une soixantaine de personnes, selon le ministre libanais de l'Environnement, Nasser Yassine. \"En défense du Liban et de son peuple\" et \"en réponse\" aux attaques \"barbares israéliennes sur des villes, des villages et des civils\", les combattants du Hezbollah ont visé \"la ville de Safed\" avec \"80 roquettes\", a déclaré la puissante formation pro-iranienne dans un communiqué. D'après l'armée israélienne, une maison a été touchée par un missile à Rosh Pinna, une localité toute proche de Safed. Les autorités n'ont pas fait état de blessé. De son côté, Nasser Yassine a dénombré \"environ 115 attaques dans différentes zones du Liban, qui ont provoqué la mort de 60 martyrs et fait 81 blessés\" et forcé des dizaines de milliers de personnes à fuir, dont au moins 77.000 qui se sont enregistrés dans des centres d'accueil du gouvernement. D'autres ont trouvé refuge chez des proches, dans des résidences de location, des hôtels ou d'autres lieux publics ou privés, a-t-il ajouté. Jeudi soir, l'armée israélienne menait \"des frappes sur des cibles terroristes du Hezbollah dans le sud du Liban\", a-t-elle indiqué dans un communiqué. L'offensive israélienne a fait environ 700 morts depuis lundi, soit le bilan le plus lourd depuis la guerre civile libanaise (1975-1990). La communauté internationale a multiplié les appels au cessez-le-feu.",

    "title": "How can Israel preserve unity? - opinion - The Jerusalem Post",
    "text": "Fearing entombment in Egypt, Jacob begs his son Joseph to bury him in the Land of Israel. Worried that he will become an Egyptian shrine, he forces Joseph to take an oath. Realizing that his son’s political commitments may obstruct the mission, he demands that Joseph swear to bury him in the Land of Israel.\nSurprisingly, after his final audience with his 12 children, Jacob lodges this burial request a second time. Evidently, in repeating this petition, Jacob has an ulterior motive.\nThroughout his tumultuous life, he had struggled to unify a splintered family. His 12 children were too different to be effortlessly forged into one cohesive group. Some children were born from pedigreed stock, while others were born from maidservants. Some of his sons had committed serious sins, while others had a more impeccable past. Some had large families, some small, while Dan had only one child. The family could only morph into a nation once these disparate elements were fused into one interconnected and indivisible nation. Building unity\nTheir frightening ordeal in Egypt had already begun to unify the brothers. False charges of espionage forced them to rally together for survival. Facing the capricious wrath of an impulsive tyrant, their escape depended upon a coordinated response.\nSubsequently, the family’s relocation to Egypt further endowed solidarity. Immersed in a foreign country, they could only counter cultural pressures and preserve their common heritage through a united effort. Couple holding hands (illustrative) (credit: PEXELS)\nHaving tasted initial solidarity, the family assembled together to meet their father for one last time. Instead of affording each child a private audience, Jacob gathered his children into one room, addressing them jointly, thereby fostering an air of camaraderie and solidarity.\nIn his final attempt to unify his family, Jacob assigns a shared family project. Though he realizes that Joseph alone is more than capable of supervising his burial, Jacob allocated mutual responsibility for his burial to all his children. This joint historical project of returning their father’s body to its rightful resting place in their common homeland, hopefully, will grant lasting unity. Despite their differences and despite the tensions that had splintered the family, they will now be united, primed to develop into one nation. Jacob’s lasting legacy is the unity he fought so hard to achieve. Advertisement The day after\nAfter the burial procession to the Land of Israel, an urgent question emerges: How can this newfound unity be preserved? Previously, a crisis had produced unity, but the crisis had long ago been resolved. Likewise, their joint project of burying Jacob was completed. No more threats, no more wars, no more joint historical projects. What comes after unity?\nThe answer is, of course, communication and mutual understanding. Potentially, unity opens channels of healthy communication. Disharmony and isolation hinder communication and lead to greater divide. In the aftermath of unity, can healthy communication follow? Will Joseph and his brothers appreciate their different viewpoints and preserve solidarity? Suspicions and lies\nIt appears as if this solidarity deteriorated. Suspicious of Joseph and fearful of his retaliation, the brothers fabricated their father’s request for Joseph to forgive them. Lying corrodes trust and wrecks relationships.\nThe midrash describes the root of the brothers’ suspicions. While traveling to his father’s burial in the Land of Israel, Joseph visited the city of Shechem, which was the site of his abduction. Presumably, he sought closure for the greatest trauma of his life. Witnessing this detour back to the scene of the crime, the brothers, though, assumed that Joseph was plotting his revenge. Had they just communicated with one another, their suspicions would have been allayed and the relationship would have thrived.\nUnity enables healthy communication. Healthy communication builds trust. Trust is the lifeblood of healthy relationships. Sadly, after they had achieved unity, the brothers and Joseph could not shift into respectful communication, and their short-lived unity vanished. By the end of his life, Joseph and his brothers seem as far apart as ever. The day after the war\nOur people now face a similar challenge. After a year of destructive social discord and malicious and spiteful national discourse, tragedy has united us like never before. In this battle for survival, every sector of our people has rallied against a common enemy. Jews around the world have lent their support, their hearts, and their wallets to the struggle for Jewish future. We all hear the echo of history calling out to us. We know that future generations will retell our story. We stand shoulder to shoulder, building the wall of Jewish destiny.\nThe question on everyone’s mind, though, is how to maintain this solidarity. At some point, we will triumph, the war will conclude, and we will all return to our normal routine. In the absence of a crisis or of a joint historical project, what can preserve unity and prevent us from sinking back into petty divisiveness?\nOur unity can be sustained only if we segue into frank and honest communication. We are together like never before: on the battlefields, in the hospitals, in the cemeteries, at volunteer centers, at rallies, and in our prayers. Now is the perfect time to learn how to communicate across the ideological divide. To communicate, we must learn how to listen. To really listen, we must better appreciate the perspectives of different communities. Each community has proven its commitment to Jewish identity and future. Now let’s listen to how they each define that future.\nSecular Israel has proven its commitment to Jewish heritage. Their patriotism and sacrifice have been unwavering and inspiring. Let us listen to their needs and wishes. Their desire for robust democracy and religious freedom reflects their noble aspirations for a Jewish state founded upon equality and dignity. Religious Jews may not concur with all their positions nor identify with their progressive secular society, but let us listen to their dreams and realize that these values don’t betray our common Jewish destiny.\nHaredi society has proven that they are deeply invested in our country and its well-being. Their society is perfectly suited for the volunteer networks and charity organizations which have proved indispensable during this war. Their commitment to Torah study and their concerns about cultural assimilation make them hesitant to serve in the IDF. Not everyone agrees with this policy, but it isn’t an abandonment of our people. As we stand together, let us listen to their perspective for our common future, and let us build it together.\nReligious Zionists are disproportionately represented in elite IDF combat units and have displayed greater loyalty to reserve duty. This dedication has come at a steep cost as, tragically, this community has suffered a high fatality rate. Their fervor and devotion should help us admire their staunch commitment to settling our homeland – a commitment manifested in higher rates of both aliyah and lone soldiers . Settling this land is a deeply spiritual and historic project.\nThe response of the international Jewish community across the religious spectrum should help us admire their deep allegiance for Jewish peoplehood and Jewish homeland. They may not live in Israel, but they live with us, and our country is deeply embedded in their hearts. As we build our future country, their needs and their hopes must also be factored in.\nThis is a watershed moment. Tragically, unity has been involuntarily thrust upon us. Can we maintain it? Can we discover healthy communication? Can we listen and can we appreciate values which aren’t our own but part of our joint future? Will we revert to suspicion and animosity? Or does this war have a silver lining of trust and healthy communication? This unity is ours to preserve or ours to dismantle.\nThe writer is a rabbi at Yeshivat Har Etzion/Gush, a hesder yeshiva.

    "text": "(KIMT) -- Temperatures are forecast to climb above zero Friday, reaching for the mid to upper teens. Some locations in North Iowa could see the low 20s Friday afternoon.\nOur next weather maker is ejecting out of the southern Rockies early Friday morning and is tracking northeastward to the Upper Midwest.\nIn lieu of the system's arrival, Winter Weather Advisories have been issued for all of southeast Minnesota and North Iowa. Advisories will initiate as early as 4 PM Friday afternoon in some of our North Iowa counties with our southeast Minnesota counties following suit at 12 AM Saturday morning. All advisories are slated to expire, at the latest, 6 PM Saturday evening.\nA major driver of the precipitation type with this storm will be the southeast winds that will be strengthening throughout the day Friday. These winds will be pulling in warmer, above-freezing air, to around 5,000 feet up in the atmosphere.\nThis shallow warm layer will force any snow that is falling out of the cloud base at around 10,000 feet to melt at around 5,000 feet as it continues the journey to the surface.\nThis atmospheric profile is the perfect example of freezing rain. Any liquid precipitation that falls out of the shallow warm layer at 5,000 feet will freeze on contact at the surface due to well below freezing temperatures.\nAn initial thump of freezing rain is looking to arrive to our far western counties in North Iowa as early as 10 PM Friday. Precipitation will overspread the region into early Saturday morning.\nDry air could be working into the system, allowing for a brief lull in precipitation for most locations early Saturday morning.\nAs moist air pulls back into the storm, a second burst of freezing rain is looking possible into Saturday evening. A changeover to snow remains possible as the atmospheric column lowers below freezing from the surface up to 10,000 feet due to radiational cooling Saturday evening.\nOn a general scale, there is a high chance of seeing at least 0.10\" of ice accretion in our North Iowa counties with lower chances into southeast Minnesota.\nPer model guidance, some locations could see up to 0.25\" of ice accumulations, although a low chance, with lighter totals in southeast Minnesota. Snow accumulations look to remain around one inch or less.\nStay tuned to the forecast with KIMT StormTeam Three for the latest and most up-to-date information.",

    "text": "Yeison Jiménez comenzó con pie derecho 2024 en su carrera musical. En primer lugar, muy emocionado contó que logró hacer sold out en las dos fechas en las que se presentará en el Movistar Arena de Bogotá. El intérprete de música popular presentará su gira 17/31 Invicto Tour en el que cantará sus mejores éxitos musicales.\n[Te puede interesar: Greeicy Rendón respondió a quienes calificaron su concierto en Costa Rica de “vulgar”](/colombia/2024/02/28/greeicy-rendon-respondio-a-quienes-calificaron-su-concierto-en-costa-rica-de-vulgar/)\nPor otro lado, el artista confirmó junto a su esposa, Sonia Restrepo, que están en la dulce espera de un nuevo integrante de la familia. Esta información ya había sido revelada en el programa La Red, pero no fue hasta el 29 de febrero con una publicación en su cuenta de Instagram en la que entregó otros detalles sobre el género del bebé, cómo se enteraron y otros aspectos.\nAhora puede seguirnos en\n WhatsApp Channel.\nPor otro lado, en la reciente publicación de la revista 15 Minutos, Jiménez confesó que semanas antes de enterarse del embarazo —durante un viaje que realizó con su pareja a Nueva York—, tuvo un sueño revelador en el que se veía jugando con un bebé. Pero esto no fue lo único que vivió el intérprete de Aventurero y Hasta la madre, pues comenzó a sentirse extraño, al igual que su esposa.\n[Te puede interesar: El artista colombiano hizo historia con presentación en la Casa Blanca en el Mes de la Historia Afroamericana](/colombia/2024/02/23/el-artista-colombiano-hizo-historia-con-presentacion-en-la-casa-blanca-en-el-mes-de-la-historia-afroamericana/)\n“Nos fuimos de viaje a Nueva York y lo más raro de todo es que unos 15 días antes soñé que Sonia tenía un bebé y yo jugaba con él. Luego ella empezó con los malestares y a mí también me dieron náuseas y otros síntomas. ‘Creo que estamos en embarazo’, le dije a mi mánager”, mencionó en entrevista con Revista 15 Minutos.\nLa pareja llegó a pensar que estaba enferma, por lo que decidió acudir al médico y practicarse algunos exámenes, que confirmaron la noticia.

    "text": "Former India head coach Ravi Shastri tore into bowling all-rounder Shardul Thakur as India collapsed to a horrendous defeat in the 1st IND vs SA Test. The Proteas clinched a comprehensive win by an innings and 32 runs to prevent India from winning a Test series on South African soil.\nIND vs SA: Shastri says India missed Shami big time\nSpeaking after the loss, Shastri noted that India lacked experience in their bowling attack. Barring experienced pacers Siraj and Bumrah, Shastri feels that India missed Shami big time. As for Shardul Thakur, the former head coach believes that he isn’t a ‘baby’ and that he is only the 4th seamer while the Men in Blue need a strong 3rd pacer.\n“India lacked experience in their bowling attack. They’ve got two of them who are reasonable experienced – Bumrah and Siraj – but they missed Shami big time. Shardul Thakur is not a baby, but he is the 4th seamer. You need a proper third seamer and that makes a massive difference overseas,” Shastri said.\n‘Go play Ranji, first class cricket’\nFurther, Shastri adviced young pacer Arshdeep Singh to play first-class games and Ranji Trophy matches. The ex-coach added that it would allow the pacer to find out if he can bowl long spells and would keep him in the mix of things.\n“The thing is you want to see his First-Class record. Can he bowl long spells? Has he played a lot of Ranji Trophy cricket? I would in fact go and make him play a lot of it, Ranji and First-Class cricket and keep him in the mix because if someone can swing it like he did with the white ball in South Africa, he could be a handy customer,” Shastri added.\nAlso Read:\nFinal Frontier remains unconquered Ajinkya Rahane & Cheteshwar Pujara could have been game-changers in South Africa SKY out, Hardik out, Rohit not interested, Who will lead India in Afghanistan T20Is?

    "text": "Dos monjas denuncian que un sacerdote de alto rango les exigía sexo grupal para \"crecer espiritualmente\" Han surgido nuevos detalles en la investigación contra un artista y sacerdote jesuita de alto rango acusado de abusar psicológica y sexualmente de monjas, después de que dos presuntas víctimas hablaran públicamente por primera vez en una rueda de prensa en Roma este miércoles, informó Vatican News. Dos exmonjas denunciaron que el artista esloveno de mosaicos Marko Rupnik, de 69 años, que presuntamente abusó de al menos 20 mujeres durante casi 30 años en una comunidad religiosa de Eslovenia, las obligaba a mantener sexo con él en trío y a ver porno para \"crecer espiritualmente\". \"Me llevaba a cines pornográficos para ayudarme a 'crecer espiritualmente'\", apuntó a los periodistas Gloria Branciani, que fue miembro de esta comunidad hasta 1994. \"Decía que no crecería espiritualmente si no satisfacía sus necesidades sexuales\", dijo. También relató que tuvo que practicar un trío con Rupnik y otra monja porque el clérigo dijo que \"era como la Trinidad\", refiriéndose a la Santísima Trinidad, principio central del cristianismo. Asimismo, añadió que Rupnik \"siempre fue protegido por todos, y todo aquello de lo que se le podía acusar era minimizado o negado\". Por eso pidió que se hagan públicos todos los detalles del escándalo y del encubrimiento de estos delitos. \"Todas éramos chicas jóvenes, llenas de ideales\", explicó otra mujer, Mirjiam Kovac. \"Pero estos mismos ideales, junto con nuestra formación en la obediencia fueron explotados para cometer abusos de diversa índole: de conciencia, de poder, espirituales, psíquicos, físicos y a menudo sexuales\", señaló. Rupnik fue excomulgado en 2020 por absolver a una mujer con la que había tenido relaciones sexuales, uno de los delitos más graves para la Iglesia católica. No obstante, fue reintegrado dos semanas después, después de arrepentirse. En 2022, las acusaciones contra Rupnik formuladas por nueve mujeres fueron desestimadas por el Dicasterio para la Doctrina de la Fe, citando el plazo de prescripción canónico. Solo más tarde ese año, después de la aparición de los informes en la prensa, los jesuitas hicieron un llamado público a las víctimas para que se presentaran. Rupnik fue finalmente expulsado de la orden en junio de 2023, pero sigue siendo sacerdote y fue aceptado en la diócesis de Koper, en su Eslovenia natal, en octubre de 2023. Tras la aparición de nuevos detalles, el papa Francisco decidió el pasado mes de octubre reabrir el caso.",

    "text": "Feinsinger column: Maybe it’s not a good idea to remove a woman’s uterus or ovaries Columns | Dec 19, 2024\nDr. Greg Feinsinger\nDoctor's Tip Dr. Greg Feinsinger.\nMedical science has improved human health markedly in modern times. However, the history of medical practice in the U.S. has a dark side.\nFollowing are a few examples: 1) A few decades ago patients were placed at bedrest for several days or weeks for illnesses, and after procedures such giving birth; eventually, it became apparent that active recovery was better. 2) At one time the treatment for a torn knee meniscus was to remove the whole meniscus, which changed the mechanics of the joint, resulting in severe arthritis. 3) For a long time, the treatment for breast cancer was radical mastectomy, a disfiguring operation that eventually was found to be unnecessary.\nThese harmful practices were based on tradition, rather than good science. It should also be noted that the time lag between when medical science tells us we should change the way we practice and when practice actually changes is 17 years.\nIn the Dec. 3 science section of the New York Times there was an eye-opening, 2-page article detailing new information about hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) and oophorectomy (removal of ovaries). The uterus is a pear-shaped female organ with 2 upper openings to the fallopian tubes, which surround the ovaries. A larger, lower opening called the cervix) connects to the vagina. The main function of the uterus is to allow implantation of a fertilized egg and to carry a developing fetus for 9 months. The ovaries are responsible for releasing eggs once a month; and they also produce estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and other hormones.\nFor years, doctors have recommended hysterectomies for women for conditions such as heavy or irregular bleeding, and fibroid tumors (which are benign and are common). The thinking was that if woman didn’t want to have more children, there was no reason for her to keep her uterus. Hysterectomy is the second most common surgery in women, next to c-section; in 2020, 500,000 of them were done in the U.S.\nIt turns out that there are downsides to removing the uterus: 1) First of all, it involves surgery, which can result in complications such as infection, bleeding, and injury to the bowel. 2) The procedure involves some vaginal shortening. 3) It can adversely affect a woman’s sexual response. 4) It can also cause some of the same health problems mentioned below that oophorectomy causes, thought to be due to damage to the arteries to the ovaries when the uterus is removed.\nBy the 1990s, doctors were trained to take the ovaries out when a hysterectomy was done, the rational being that this would prevent cancer of the ovaries, which is relatively rare but difficult to diagnose and often fatal. However, it turns out that even after menopause the ovaries produce needed hormones. Recently, Dr. William Parker, an OB-GYN professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, reviewed data from the 30,000 women in the national Nurses’ Health Study and found that women who had their ovaries removed were at significantly higher risk for heart disease, strokes, osteoporosis, lung cancer, Parkinson’s disease, dementia, loss of skin elasticity, and early menopause. Those who lost their ovaries before menopause lived shorter lives. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends against oophorectomy, which, and the procedure is now less common. When a hysterectomy is done these days, the fallopian tubes are often removed—thought to be where ovarian cancer usually starts.\nInterestingly, around half of patients who have had gynecologic surgery don’t know exactly what was done. Partly this is due to confusing nomenclature. A partial hysterectomy means removal of the uterus, leaving the cervix in place (in which case a Pap smear is still necessary). A total hysterectomy means removal of the uterus and cervix. Oophorectomy means removal of the ovaries, and salpingectomy refers to removal of the fallopian tubes.\nPart of the problem, though, is that gyn doctors (often male in the old days) fail to adequately explain what surgery is planned, the possible downsides, and other available options (e.g. for fibroids there are options other than hysterectomy).\nOf course, there are some cases, such as cancer of the uterus, where hysterectomy is necessary. And if a woman is at extremely high risk for ovarian cancer, oophorectomy might be the best choice. But ask questions and consider second opinions if you are advised to have a one of these operations.\nDr. Greg Feinsinger is a retired family physician who started the non-profit Center For Prevention and Treatment of Disease Through Nutrition.
