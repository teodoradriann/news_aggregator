    "text": "Table of Contents\nToggle\nMcCullum’s Vision for English Cricket New Leadership Structure McCullum’s Trust in Stokes Future Expectations Stokes’ Aspirations McCullum’s Confidence in Team Performance Support for Buttler Looking Ahead Debut for Hull McCullum’s Vision for English Cricket\nBrendon McCullum has voiced his expectation that Ben Stokes will be completely dedicated to the England cricket team following the New Zealander’s contract extension, which now includes the management of both Test and limited-overs formats.\nNew Leadership Structure After taking the helm as head coach two years ago, McCullum, 42, has made significant changes to England’s Test cricket approach. He will now also lead the white-ball teams starting in January.\nStokes, 33, who serves as the Test captain, had previously come out of retirement to participate in the one-day international setup during last year’s World Cup, although he has not been part of England’s white-ball squad since then.\nMcCullum’s Trust in Stokes Regarding their working relationship, McCullum stated, “He’s been incredible and our relationship is fantastic. You never know where the game’s going globally and what sort of opportunities will pop up for him, but I know how invested he is in English cricket and how determined he is to drive this team forward.”\nFuture Expectations Before McCullum’s recent extension of his contract, there were speculations about both he and Stokes potentially stepping down after the upcoming Ashes series in Australia planned for the winter of 2025-26. However, under the new agreement, McCullum will retain leadership until the home Ashes in the summer of 2027 along with the 50-over World Cup scheduled for later that year.\nHis tenure will see him involved in the Champions Trophy early in the coming year and a T20 World Cup in 2026.\nStokes’ Aspirations In a recent interview with the Telegraph, Stokes expressed that “in an ideal world” he would still hold the position of Test captain in 2027, indicating that he finds it challenging to decline participation in global tournaments.\nMcCullum’s Confidence in Team Performance In anticipation of the upcoming Test match against Sri Lanka at the Kia Oval, McCullum remarked, “The skipper and I haven’t spoken, but I’m assuming he’s all in. He seems like that sort of bloke.” He further expressed confidence in Stokes’ ability to thrive in high-pressure situations.\nSupport for Buttler McCullum also affirmed his support for Jos Buttler as England’s white-ball captain, despite a tough year that culminated in the departure of coach Matthew Mott. Despite England’s recent struggles, having lost significantly in the 50-over World Cup and semi-finals of the T20 World Cup, McCullum remains optimistic about Buttler’s contributions.\nHe described Buttler’s demeanor as occasionally “a little bit miserable at times,” urging him to enjoy the forthcoming years and seize the opportunity to lead a talented group of players.\nLooking Ahead With the packed schedule for England’s cricket team, McCullum indicated that he would miss some series, delegating responsibilities to assistant coaches while balancing time with his family in New Zealand.\nHaving achieved victories in all five Tests this summer, England is aiming for a clean sweep against Sri Lanka this week—a feat they haven’t accomplished since 2004.\nDebut for Hull The team is set to introduce Leicestershire’s left-arm bowler Josh Hull, selecting him based on potential despite a challenging domestic record. McCullum noted, “What we are trying to achieve is bringing in some of these guys who we see as rough diamonds with incredibly high ceilings.”\nDespite uncertainty regarding the schedule for their upcoming Tests in Pakistan, McCullum expressed hope for clarity soon so that team selections can proceed smoothly.",

    "title": "Archbishop Ole Sapit condemns deployment of Kenyan troops to Haiti",
    "text": "By Boniface Barasa, Anglican Archbishop Jackson Ole Sapit has faulted President William Ruto's push to send Kenya's police officers to Haiti.\nThe Archbishop says the move is ill-informed as residents of the northern parts of the country continue to grapple with insecurity.\n\"It doesn't make sense to send troops to Haiti when we have insecurity problems across the country and especially in the North Rift. Our request is that as the government send troops to Haiti, they should also better security across Kenya.,\" said Ole Sapit.\nThe majority of the residents in the area who fled their homes for safety continue to grapple with a deplorable state at IDP camps in Lolmolog, Longewan, and Ang'ata Nanyekie.\nThe archbishop, who is on a working tour of Samburu County, and local leaders from the area want the insecurity in the North Rift region put to an end before the government commits the country's security personnel to Haiti.\nPhilip Lerno, Loosuk area chief of Samburu West Sub County, says there's still tension, with bandits spotted in the area from time to time.\nBandits are still active in the area. It's the National Police Reservists (NPR) who are keeping them at bay but tension is still high in the region since they can decide to strike at any time,\" Lerno said.\nOn Friday, President William Ruto once again defended Kenya's commitment to deploy 1,000 police officers to Port-au-Prince as part of the U.N. Security Council-backed security mission to troubled Haiti.\nAddressing the press alongside U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House in Washington D.C. on Thursday, Citizen TV's Ayub Abdikadir pressed Ruto to explain Kenya's decision to dispatch the officers to Haiti, a distance of 12,078 kilometres from Kenya, amidst ongoing banditry attacks in the North Rift region.\nIn response, Ruto highlighted that despite dispatching troops to Haiti, Kenya has remained steadfast in addressing the issue of banditry back home, adding that the government has deployed 3,000 military personnel and 2,000 police officers to the North Rift to combat and eliminate the banditry menace.\n\"I made a commitment to the people of Kenya to sort out insecurity in the North Rift. I have followed that with action. As we speak there are 3,000 military officers and 2,000 police officers in the North Rift,\" said Ruto.\n\"We have also renovated 15 schools and reopened 20 schools that were closed. The exercise is still ongoing.\"\nRuto subsequently emphasised Kenya's role in enhancing security within its borders while affirming the country's broader responsibility to do the same beyond its borders.\n\"We have made tremendous progress in making sure that we create security at home but that does not take away our responsibility. Even as we deployed troops and police to sort out the banditry problem we still deployed 1,000 troops to DRC Congo because that is our neighbour,\" he said.\n\"We have deployed 5,000 troops in Somalia because that is equally our responsibility and Haiti should not be an exception. Deploying 1,000 troops to Haiti speaks of the same belief and commitment.\"\nTags: Citizen Digital Haiti William Ruto Banditry Archbishop Jackson Ole Sapit Want to send us a story?

    "text": "10/12/23 – People walk through a city centre during rain showers\nA deluge of wet and windy weather is set to be unleashed across Ireland, as the New Year’s celebrations get off to a stormy start.\nMiserable conditions loom as powerful systems from the Atlantic barrel towards Ireland, ready to make landfall and sweep the country in the coming days.\nMet EIreann has issued multiple weather warnings ahead of a double blast of wind and rain.\nA Status Yellow rainfall warning is in place until 9pm Friday for Donegal, Leitrim, North Mayo and Sligo. It warns that “heavy rainfall may lead to localised flooding”.\nA few hours later, another Status Yellow warning for both wind and rain kicks in for Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Mayo and Wexford. The alert, which is in place from 2am until 11pm on Saturday, states: “Southwest winds will be strong and gusty at times coupled with heavy rain and thundery showers.Potential impacts include surface flooding, wave overtopping, loose debris, objects displaced and difficult travelling conditions.”\nAfter that, a third Status Yellow warning for wind has been issued from 11pm Saturday until 5pm Sunday (New Year’s Eve) for Clare, Cork, Kerry and Limerick. The alert reads: “Westerly winds veering northwesterly will be strong and gusty at times. Potential Impacts include loose debris, objects displaced, difficult travelling conditions, waving overtopping.”\nThe weather is expected to continue unsettled with rain or showers most days.\nGiving the forecast for the final days of 2023, Met Eireann said: “Cloudy periods and some sunny spells Friday along with some scattered showers, some of which will be heavy with hail, especially in the north. Some localised flooding possible in northern counties. Highest temperatures of 5C to 8C in fresh and gusty westerly breezes.\n“Some clear spells at first tonight with just isolated showers. Lowest temperatures of -1C to 3C with some frost and icy stretches forming with light breezes. However, cloud will build from the southwest, turning milder as the rain follows, extending northeastwards over much of the country by morning, accompanied by fresh to strong and gusty southeasterly winds. There is a chance of transient falls of sleet on the leading edge of the rain.\n“A wet and windy start to Saturday with widespread rain, heavy or thundery at times with some localised flooding possible. The rain will clear from the west to sunny spells and showers from the western half of the country through the morning, extending to all areas in the afternoon. Some showers will be heavy with a chance of isolated thunderstorms and hail. Highest afternoon temperatures of 5C to 9C, coolest in the northwest. Fresh to strong and gusty southerly winds, with onshore gales, will mean there is a chance of coastal flooding in the south and southwest.\n“Clear spells and squally showers overnight Saturday, most frequent in the west and southwest. Lowest temperatures of 3 to 6 degrees in fresh to strong and gusty southerly or cyclonic variable winds.”\nLooking ahead to New Year’s Eve, the national forecaster said: “Breezy or windy with sunny spells and scattered showers and a chance of hail on Sunday. Fresh to strong and gusty westerly or cyclonic variable winds will gradually decrease moderate to fresh and gusty through the day. Highest temperatures of 5C to 8C generally.\n“Showers will continue overnight, mainly for Atlantic counties with longer spells of rain possible in the northwest. Some frost or ice will form with lowest temperatures of -1C to 3C degrees in mostly moderate westerly winds.”\nThe forecast for New Year’s Day reads: “Sunny spells and scattered showers at first Monday, becoming more isolated through the morning and early afternoon. Cloud will build from the southwest with rain following, extending northeastwards over much of the country by night-time. Highest afternoon temperatures of 5C to 8C in light to moderate southwesterly winds, backing southeasterly and increasing moderate to fresh with the rain.\n“Outbreaks of rain will clear northwards from most areas overnight Monday, with clear spells and scattered showers following from the west. Lowest temperatures over the northern half of the country of -2C to 0C, milder further south.”\nLooking further ahead, the meteorological agency said: “Current indications suggest that on Tuesday there will be further showers or showery outbreaks of rain. Highest temperatures of 6C to 9C generally.\n“The rest of next week looks generally cool and unsettled with rain or showers expected.

    "text": "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has received enough petitions to meet the congressionally established H-2B cap for the second half of FY 2025. March 5, 2025, was the final receipt date for new cap-subject H-2B worker petitions requesting an employment start date on or after April 1, 2025, and before October 1, 2025.\nAll the new cap-subject H-2B petitions received after March 5, 2025, that request an employment start date on or after April 1, 2025, and before October 1, 2025, will be rejected by USCIS.\nHowever, the filing dates for supplemental H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2025 are now available. Currently, Congress has set the H-2B cap at 66,000 per fiscal year, with 33,000 for workers who begin employment in the first half of the fiscal year (Oct. 1 – Mar. 31) and 33,000 for workers who begin employment in the second half of the fiscal year (Apr. 1—Sep. 30).\nIn November 2024, the US announced that it expects to make an additional 64,716 H-2B temporary nonagricultural worker visas available for Fiscal Year (FY) 2025. The additional H-2B visas will be in addition to the congressionally mandated 66,000 H-2B visas that are available each fiscal year.\nOn December 2, 2024, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) jointly published a temporary final rule increasing the numerical limit (or cap) on H-2B nonimmigrant visas by up to 64,716 additional visas for all of fiscal year 2025.\nThese supplemental visas are available only to U.S. businesses that are suffering irreparable harm or will suffer impending irreparable harm without the ability to employ all the H-2B workers requested in their petition, as attested by the employer on a new attestation form.\nIn January 2025, USCIS announced that it has received enough petitions to reach the cap for the additional 20,716 H-2B visas made available for returning workers for the first half of fiscal year 2025 with start dates on or before March 31, 2025, under the H-2B supplemental cap temporary final rule for financial year 2025.\nThe H-2B program allows U.S. employers who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary nonagricultural jobs.\nCongress created the H-2B non-agricultural temporary worker program to allow U.S. employers to bring foreign workers to the United States to fill temporary non-agricultural jobs.\nThe maximum period of stay in the H-2B classification is three years. A person who has held H-2B nonimmigrant status for a total of three years must depart and remain outside of the United States for an uninterrupted period of three months before seeking readmission as an H-2B nonimmigrant.\nThe new regulation simplifies the H-2B program worker stay restrictions by eliminating “interrupted” stay provisions and establishing a consistent 60-day absence time to reset the 3-year clock. This implies that an H-2 worker can now seek new eligible employment or prepare to leave the United States for up to 60 days after their employment ends without violating their H-2 status or accruing unlawful presence.\nThe regulation would divide the supplemental visas for returning workers between the first and second halves of the fiscal year to account for the need for additional seasonal and other temporary workers throughout the year, with a portion of the second half allocation set aside to meet demand during the peak summer season.",

    "text": "[Guayaquil] No todos los padres están conformes con el regreso a las aulas en Guayaquil Algunos padres piden repetir el contenido impartido incluso estas semanas, puesto que alegan que se han reportado vacíos en el aprendizaje Era una situación que no deseaban volver a vivir los padres, maestros ni estudiantes. La virtualidad, debido a la violencia que experimenta el país, golpeó nuevamente sin avisar. Y aunque hay planteles que en Guayaquil ya han vuelto al aula, 77 según anunció el Ministerio de Educación; hay otros que desconocen cuándo lo harán o si lo harán, generando incertidumbre sobre todo a los alumnos que están a solo tres semanas de terminar el año escolar. En Playas unos 12.000 estudiantes retornaron a clase presenciales [Leer más](/guayaquil/playas-12-000-estudiantes-retornaron-clase-presenciales-187218) Ellos, como publicó EXPRESO el pasado 25 de enero, quieren volver para reencontrarse con sus compañeros. Un acción que los padres no aprueban en su totalidad, al preferir que en las tres semanas que resta para culminar el año lectivo 2023, terminen de estudiar en casa, aun cuando este escenario complica, en algunos casos, su cotidianidad (Le puede interesar leer: [Un emotivo regreso al aula, entre abrazos y medidas de seguridad](https://www.expreso.ec/guayaquil/emotivo-regreso-aula-abrazos-medidas-seguridad-violencia-187248.html)) Andrés Lucero, docente y padre de dos menores, habla con EXPRESO sobre los avatares que han surgido a raíz de la virtualidad. “Es difícil, tengo dos hijos y estar pendiente de que se conecten a sus clases y realicen actividades, aumenta mis labores ya que cuando ellos están en sus estudios, no puedo usar la laptop para desarrollar las actividades de la institución donde imparto clases y que no regresará a la presencialidad. Tengo que esperar a que terminen para poder utilizarla, pero mis clases se ven también afectadas”, afirma. Al final del día esta incertidumbre de si volvemos o no, nos hace adaptarnos a una modalidad para luego volver a otra. Creo, que lo mejor que puede hacer el Gobierno es tomar una decisión final y ahora. Lucero mantiene la postura de que todos deberían regresar al aula, sin embargo, eso debería suceder cuando el Gobierno, y las instituciones den las debidas garantías de seguridad. Situación que, a decir de los miembros de la Unión Nacional de Educadores no se cumple. Que la vida de los maestros y alumnos, en algunos puntos del Puerto Principal, están en riesgo, han dicho en reiteradas ocasiones, al argumentar que Educación no ve la realidad que enfrentan ni escucha las súplicas de los educadores que han sido víctimas ya de las extorsiones. ¿Hasta cuándo habrá clases en Guayaquil y la Costa? [Leer más](/guayaquil/habra-clases-costa-187186) Teniendo en cuenta esta situación y la ola de violencia que en general se vive en Guayaquil, para el economista Carlos Cevallos, este regreso progresivo que se ha dado no es la medida más idónea, ya que los estudiantes, además, se ven afectados por el cambio constante de ambientes. “Lo que queda del año debió terminar de forma virtual. Realmente a mí no me gustaría que regresen porque no hay muchas garantías de protección. Es evidente que los grupos armados podrían atacar los colegios y es innecesario retornar y hacer que muchos jóvenes corran peligro. Además, falta dos o tres semanas para terminar, ya tienen el 90 % de cumplimiento del nivel en curso. Es absurdo”, piensa. Realmente no me gustaría que vuelvan al aula porque no hay mucha seguridad. Si les toca a mis hijos regresar y no le dan seguridad, voy a estar muy preocupado y esperando que terminen las clases del año lectivo. Asimismo piensa Andrea Ramírez, abogada y docente particular de Lengua. “El Gobierno debería tomar una decisión clara para no vivir en incertidumbre. Sobre todo porque eso afecta el cronograma de estudios de los jóvenes y también de los profesionales que vivimos bajo ese calendario. Si ya falta poco debimos haber terminado en la modalidad virtual”, alega. El retorno a la presencialidad atemoriza a los universitarios [Leer más](/guayaquil/retorno-presencialidad-atemoriza-universitarios-186899) Carolina Espinoza recibió vía WhatsApp un mensaje en el que se le informó que sus hijos retornarían a la presencialidad, y notó disgusto en el grupo de padres. “Creo que tocará repetir el contenido impartido en estas semanas. Mis hijos, pese a ser corto el tiempo que estudiaron a través de una computadora, entran a exámenes con los vacíos de las clases virtuales que fueron irregulares. Estoy algo decepcionada porque regresamos y no hubo cambio en los estudios”, concluye. Es necesario el regreso a la presencialidad, pero solo si el Gobierno y las instituciones nos dan garantías de seguridad. Igualmente, ya faltan pocas semanas para que termine el año lectivo y seguiríamos igual que en lo virtual. - La necesidad de evaluar las necesidades educativas Clases en Ecuador: la presencialidad se retomará de forma progresiva y focalizada [Leer más](/actualidad/clases-ecuador-presencialidad-retomara-forma-progresiva-focalizada-186596) Desde un punto de vista psicológico, la presencialidad es generalmente mejor que la educación a distancia en sus diferentes modalidades, aseguran expertos en psicología consultados por este Diario. Luiggi Sáenz de Viteri, educador y psicólogo, manifiesta que “la presencialidad ofrece una serie de ventajas para el bienestar psicológico como mayor interacción social, sentido de pertenencia y más motivación por las respuestas más rápidas a estímulos”. Sin embargo, también alude que por la situación que vive el país, la virtualidad también tiene ventajas en la salud mental. “En casos como el conflicto interno armado en Ecuador, la virtualidad es una opción con mayor flexibilidad que disminuye la exposición a riesgos y el estrés. No todos los casos son iguales, por eso se necesita evaluar las necesidades de la población y los estudiantes”, señaló.
