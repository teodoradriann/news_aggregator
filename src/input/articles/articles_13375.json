    "title": "Kanye West 'Relapsed' on Laughing Gas After Dental Appointment, Sources Claim: 'The Medication Leads to This Meltdown' - NewsBreak",
    "text": "Kanye West 's recent erratic behavior may have been exacerbated by his alleged use of laughing gas, sources claimed. The \"Gold Digger\" rapper, 47, faced backlash for his offensive and often antisemitic social media tirades attacking the Jewish community and many others earlier this month. His Yeezy website was even taken down after he put up a t-shirt with a swastika on it for sale. Now, a friend has alleged West may have \"relapsed\" on nitrous oxide when he returned to L.A. at the end of January and had dental work done. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) , abuse of nitrous oxide can cause personality changes such as anxiety, depression and mania, as well as \"impulsive and aggressive behaviors, hallucination, delusions and other psychotic symptoms.\" A second source also claimed the \"nitrous took over\" when West was back in Los Angeles. \"After the Grammy party [on Feb. 2], he met people and it kind of escalated to things that he never does anymore when he’s in Japan,\" the source noted. A third insider agreed there was \"an issue with nitrous and his dentist, and the medication leads to this meltdown.\" \"When he comes off the nitrous he’s crazy, he just wants to be able to do anything he wants,\" the insider added. \"It’s as if thoughts are coming to him and he speaks his mind . It’s like a cultural Tourette's experience, his entire life is a video game.\" An employee who used to work for Yeezy also told the outlet that the \"Flashing Lights\" artist was \" very easily influenced \" by others and reportedly suffered from memory problems. \"His memory is so messed up this point,\" the ex-employee claimed. \"You can kind of just convince [West] of things and he doesn’t really fact check them. You can just say something that is not true, but if you say it with enough conviction at the right time he’ll believe it.\" As OK! previously reported, West bizarrely claimed he was a \"Nazi\" and said \"Hitler was s fresh\" in a series of shocking social media posts shared to X. His account seemingly went offline earlier this month after the wild rants, but last week, it was reactivated with a \"sensitive content\" warning. Shopify also removed West's Yeezy website for violating terms of service after he attempted to sell shirts with a swastika on them. \"All merchants are responsible for following the rules of our platform,\" a spokesperson for Shopify said at the time. \"This merchant did not engage in authentic commerce practices and violated our terms, so we removed them from Shopify.\" The New York Post reported the sources' comments on West's alleged relapse.",

    "text": "Julie Rovner, David Hilzenrath | (TNS) KFF Health News\nNew technologies are making it easier for companies to fix prices and discriminate against individual consumers, the Biden administration’s top consumer watchdog said Tuesday.\nAlgorithms make it possible for companies to fix prices without explicitly coordinating with one another, posing a new test for regulators policing the market, said Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, during a media event hosted by KFF.\n“I think we could be entering a somewhat novel era of pricing,” Khan told reporters.\nKhan is regarded as one of the most aggressive antitrust regulators in recent U.S. history, and she has paid particular attention to the harm that technological advances can pose to consumers. Antitrust regulators at the FTC and the Justice Department set a record for merger challenges in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2022, according to Bloomberg News.\nLast year, the FTC successfully blocked biotech company Illumina’s over $7 billion acquisition of cancer-screening company Grail. The FTC, Justice Department, and Health and Human Services Department launched a website on April 18, healthycompetition.gov , to make it easier for people to report suspected anticompetitive behavior in the health care industry.\nThe American Hospital Association, the industry’s largest trade group, has often criticized the Biden administration’s approach to antitrust enforcement. In comments in September on proposed guidance the FTC and Justice Department published for companies, the AHA said that “the guidelines reflect a fundamental hostility to mergers.”\nPrice fixing removes competition from the market and generally makes goods and services more expensive. The agency has argued in court filings that price fixing “is still illegal even if you are achieving it through an algorithm,” Khan said. “There’s no kind of algorithmic exemption to the antitrust laws.”\nBy simply using the same algorithms to set prices, companies can effectively charge the same “even if they’re not, you know, getting in a back room and kind of shaking hands and setting a price,” Khan said, using the example of residential property managers.\nKhan said the commission is also scrutinizing the use of artificial intelligence and algorithms to set prices for individual consumers “based on all of this particular behavioral data about you: the websites you visited, you know, who you had lunch with, where you live.”\nAnd as health care companies change the way they structure their businesses to maximize profits, the FTC is changing the way it analyzes behavior that could hurt consumers, Khan said.\nHiring people who can “help us look under the hood” of some inscrutable algorithms was a priority, Khan said. She said it’s already paid off in the form of legal actions “that are only possible because we had technologists on the team helping us figure out what are these algorithms doing.”\nTraditionally, the FTC has policed health care by challenging local or regional hospital mergers that have the potential to reduce competition and raise prices. But consolidation in health care has evolved, Khan said.\nMergers of systems that don’t overlap geographically are increasing, she said. In addition, hospitals now often buy doctor practices, while pharmacy benefit managers start their own insurance companies or mail-order pharmacies — or vice versa — pursuing “vertical integration” that can hurt consumers, she said.\nThe FTC is hearing increasing complaints “about how these firms are using their monopoly power” and “exercising it in ways that’s resulting in higher prices for patients, less service, as well as worse conditions for health care workers,” Khan said.\nPolicing Noncompetes Khan said she was surprised at how many health care workers responded to the commission’s recent proposal to ban “noncompete” clauses — agreements that can prevent employees from moving to new jobs. The FTC issued its final rule banning the practice on Tuesday. She said the ban was aimed at low-wage industries like fast food but that many of the comments in favor of the FTC’s plan came from health professions.\nHealth workers say noncompete agreements are “both personally devastating and also impeded patient care,” Khan said.\nIn some cases, doctors wrote that their patients “got really upset because they wanted to stick with me, but my hospital was saying I couldn’t,” Khan said. Some doctors ended up commuting long distances to prevent the rest of their families from having to move after they changed jobs, she said.\n___\n( KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs of KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling and journalism.)\n©2024 KFF Health News.

    "text": "The indefinite strike launched by Haryana doctors on Friday morning was put off for three days after an assurance from the government later in the day to look into their demands. Their demand includes better pay packages and greater promotion opportunities.\nHaryana Civil Medical Services Association president Rajesh Khyalia met the Director General, Health Services, Randeep Poonia, in Panchkula. He said the government had promised to look into their demands and convene a meeting with Health Minister Anil Vij and Additional Chief Secretaries of Health and Finance on January 1.\n“In the wake of the assurance, the association has decided to put off the strike till January 1. A decision on resumption of the strike will be taken after the meeting,” said Mr. Khyalia.\nStaff shortages The four major demands of the doctors are: addressing a shortage of specialists, dynamic Assured Career Progression (ACP) increment, halt to direct recruitment of Senior Medical Officer, and reduction of bond amount for Post-graduate courses. The Haryana doctors have been demanding four ACP increments in the fourth, ninth, thirteenth and twentieth year of service. That would bring them on par with doctors in central government service and in states like Bihar.\nDoctors are currently paid three ACP increments in the fifth, tenth and fifteenth year of their service. The proposal has been approved, but is pending at the finance department. Similarly, doctors are demanding that direct appointment of Senior Medical Officer be scrapped to provide more promotion opportunities as most of them get only one promotion in their entire careers. They are also seeking revision of the policy which makes it mandatory for in-service doctors to submit two bonds of Rs.1 crore each to pursue Post-graduate courses.\nEarlier health services in government hospitals across the state were disrupted through the day after around 2,500 doctors went on strike in the morning. However, teams of volunteer doctors were constituted for life-saving interventions in the public interest.\nCOMMents\nSHARE\nCopy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

    "text": "Ain Météo : avec le verglas, plusieurs cols fermés à la circulation\nAvec les conditions météo actuelles, des accès routiers sont fermés à la circulation. En cause : le verglas, arrivé avec le froid. Les secteurs routiers concernés sont en cours de traitement.\nCe n’est pas un secret, il fait froid !\nDes routes d'ores et déjà fermées\nLe ciel est déjà bien chargé ce vendredi matin, avec quelques brumes sur les plaines de l’ouest du département. En cours de journée, les nuages vont persister et cacheront le ciel étoilé. Le vent, faible, ne creuse pas l’écart entre les températures réelles et ressenties.\nMais qui dit froid, dit aussi routes bloquées. Et dans le département, quelques accès sont d’ores et déjà fermés.\nDes conditions délicates\nLes conditions de circulation sont délicates en raison de verglas localisé sur les secteurs d’Arbent, Montréal-la-Cluse, Hauteville, Brenod et Saint-Rambert. Les chaussées sont en cours de traitement.\nPar ailleurs, le col de Cuvillat (RD 57a), le col de Belleroche (RD 39), le col de la Biche, le Col du Grand Colombier, la Route de la Pesse et la D55C à Haut-Valromey sont actuellement fermés. Le col de Colliard (RD 39) est également fermé, pour cause d’éboulements rocheux.\nPour d’autres raisons, la RD 11, entre les carrefours des RD 12 et RD 11, est fermée. En effet, un trou d’un mètre de diamètre ainsi qu’une cavité d’une profondeur de deux mètres se sont formés.\nSuite à un glissement de terrain au niveau de la RD 214, un alternat est mis en place sur la RD 72a à proximité du barrage de Génissiat en direction de Franclens.",

    "text": "一文详解任天堂Switch 2\n) 任天堂;)在周三公布了备受期待的任天堂 Switch 2 游戏主机的新细节，这将是该公司自 2017 年推出任天堂 Switch 以来的首款新主机。\n任天堂 Switch 2 将于 6 月 5 日发售，售价 450 美元。\n在首发时，该主机将单独发售，也会作为包含《马里奥赛车世界》（Mario Kart World）的捆绑套装的一部分发售，《马里奥赛车世界》是一款为 Switch 2 打造的新游戏。\n任天堂 Switch 2 会是什么样子呢？\n顾名思义，Switch 2 是任天堂 Switch 的升级版。它在现有的 Switch 设计基础上进行了改进，Switch 既可以在外出时游玩，也可以在家连接电视屏幕游玩。\n)\nSwitch 2 将是一个更大的主机，屏幕更大（尽管边缘仍有边框），Joy-Con 手柄更重，它们也会通过磁力吸附在屏幕两侧。该设备配备一块 1080p 的液晶屏幕，支持最高 120 帧每秒的帧率，还支持高动态范围（HDR）—— 这对于已经习惯了升级版 OLED 任天堂 Switch 的用户来说可能会有些失望。不过，底座将支持 4K 分辨率。\n任天堂 Switch 2 将拥有 256GB 的存储空间，是上一代的 8 倍，在上一代中，即使是休闲玩家通常也得购买一张 microSD 卡来获得更多存储空间。不过，它将只支持 microSD express 卡来扩展存储，这是一种新型的 microSD 卡。\n设备背面有一个更结实的支架，可以将设备直立放置。机身顶部和底部都有 USB-C 充电接口。（顶部似乎是为任天堂 Switch 摄像头准备的，但它也是一个位置更合适的充电接口。）\n任天堂 Switch 2 的经典配色是哑光黑色，每个 Joy-Con 手柄上分别有浅红色和蓝色的装饰，这呼应了之前的设计，但形式更加时尚。任天堂可能会让你购买任意数量、各种颜色的 Joy-Con 手柄 —— 希望这次不会再有摇杆漂移的问题。\nJoy-Con 手柄还可以在兼容的游戏中当作电脑鼠标使用。借助陀螺仪功能，玩家可以更好地控制体感操作。\n为了让用户熟悉新的任天堂 Switch 2 的功能，将会推出一款名为《欢迎之旅》（Welcome Tour）的游戏来介绍该设备，而且它是需要花钱购买的，这笔钱可能花在《马里奥赛车世界》上会更值。\n为了让这个交易更有吸引力，除了现有的任天堂 64 和 Game Boy 游戏移植版之外，任天堂在线服务现在还将允许玩家重温 GameCube 游戏，其中包括《火焰纹章：苍炎之轨迹》《超级马里奥前锋》《路易吉洋楼》《宝可梦 XD》等。一些游戏会在 Switch 2 发售当天推出，同时还会推出一款重新制作的 GameCube 手柄 —— 别担心，它带有 C 键。\n)\n任天堂 Switch 2 上的 C 键是什么？\n很多粉丝猜测 Joy-Con 手柄上出现的 C 键的功能，任天堂今天证实它是 “游戏聊天”（GameChat）功能，该功能允许你在玩游戏时与朋友交流。\n系统中的麦克风可以识别你的声音，据说这样即使在嘈杂的房间里也能听到对方的声音。用户还可以在主机内分享自己的游戏屏幕，即使他们玩的是不同的游戏。（小心了，Discord。）不过，在演示中，另一位玩家的游戏屏幕画面看起来有点卡顿。\n右侧的 Joy-Con 手柄还有另一个 C 键，可以用于其他聊天功能，包括在你需要做其他事情时静音麦克风。\n“游戏聊天” 功能在 2026 年 3 月 31 日之前对所有用户免费开放，但在那之后，你需要有付费的在线会员才能使用。任天堂简要提到 “游戏聊天” 功能将提供家长控制，但没有提供更多细节。\n任天堂 Switch 2 首发的硬件有哪些？\n任天堂发布了任天堂 Switch 摄像头，它可以连接到主机上，并将你的脸叠加在游戏画面上，非常适合 “游戏聊天” 功能。\n任天堂展示了一个使用该摄像头的例子，人们一起玩《马里奥派对》，玩家的脸会出现在他们角色旁边的对话框中，显示他们对游戏的反应。这些新功能将与某些游戏向后兼容，包括《马里奥派对大狂欢》。\n当然，还会有一款任天堂 Switch 2 Pro 手柄，它也包含新的 C 键。\n)\n任天堂 Switch 2 将有哪些可用的游戏？\n一开始，任天堂已经确认一款新的独占马里奥赛车游戏将与 Switch 2 在同一天发售，这款游戏名为《马里奥赛车世界》。\n《马里奥赛车世界》似乎是任天堂对开放世界马里奥游戏的诠释。游戏中有一个包含多个不同区域和赛道的大地图，而且在自由驾驶模式下，你可以随心所欲地驾驶 —— 无论是单人还是多人模式 —— 不用担心每个角落都潜伏着红色龟壳。\nSwitch 2 将支持其他开发商的游戏，有些正在开发中，有些已经发布。这些游戏包括《哈迪斯 2》《艾尔登法环：褪色者版》《街头霸王》《EA Sports FC》《麦登橄榄球》《托尼霍克职业滑板 3+4》《如龙 0》《无主之地 4》《挺进地牢 2》《赛博朋克 2077：终极版》《最终幻想 7 重制版》《丝之歌》等。《三角符文》的新章节 3 和 4 将在 Switch 2 发售当天推出。\n还会有一款塞尔达系列的新游戏，名为《塞尔达无双：囚禁时代》（Hyrule Warriors： Age of Imprisonment），它是《塞尔达传说：王国之泪》的前传，预计今年冬天推出。\n星之卡比的粉丝们听到《星之卡比：空中骑手》（Kirby AirRiders）的消息会很高兴，这款游戏预计在 2025 年推出，它是对 20 年前原版 GameCube 游戏《星之卡比：空中滑车》的重制。新的 Switch 2 游戏《大金刚狂欢》（Donkey Kong Bananza）将于 2025 年 7 月 17 日发售。\nFromSoftware 公司的《暮血者》（The Duskbloods）正在为任天堂 Switch 2 开发中，将于 2026 年独家在该平台上发售。\n任天堂 Switch 2 将允许玩家为他们现有的 Switch 游戏购买升级，也可以为那些有特别的 Switch 2 版本的游戏购买升级，这些游戏包括《塞尔达传说：旷野之息》《塞尔达传说：王国之泪》《银河战士 Prime 4：超越》《宝可梦传说：Z-A》《星之卡比：探索发现》和《马里奥派对大狂欢》。不过，这些升级都需要付费。",
