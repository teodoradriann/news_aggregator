    "title": "Three States Sue to Block Illegal Abortion Pills: \"Shut These Murderers Down\" - LifeNews.com",
    "text": "Three pro-life states have asked a federal court to protect women — and teenage girls — from the potentially deadly effects of the abortion pill, overturning years of “dangerous” executive actions imposed by the Obama and Biden-Harris administrations.\nThe states of Missouri, Kansas, and Idaho have sued the administration to reinstate the original protocols the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enacted when it approved the abortion pill, mifepristone, in 2000, rolling back a decade of deregulation of chemical abortion that they contend has hurt or killed women. The lawsuit names the FDA, the Department of Health and Human Services, and HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n“Women face severe, even life-threatening, harm because the federal government has disregarded their health and safety,” says the states’ 199-page legal brief .\nREACH PRO-LIFE PEOPLE WORLDWIDE! Advertise with LifeNews to reach hundreds of thousands of pro-life readers every week. Contact us today .\nThe Clinton administration’s FDA originally approved mifepristone (known at the time as RU-486) for only the first seven weeks of pregnancy; mandated that medical personnel must dispense the two-drug chemical abortion cocktail in-person; and required three in-person visits (to confirm pregnancy, to administer the drug, and to assure the mother’s health after dispensing it). The abortion industry largely ignored legal norms and dispensed the drug far later. The Obama administration unilaterally legalized their practice by extending the date to 10 weeks , reduced the in-person visits to one, and eliminated reporting of all adverse effects except death. The Biden-Harris administration removed all in-person visits and allowed pharmacies to dispense the life-taking drugs.\nThe states contend this puts women’s and girls’ health at risk.\n“Abortion drugs are dangerous — the FDA’s own label says that an estimated roughly one in 25 women who take abortion drugs will visit the emergency room,” it states. “[T]he FDA has failed in this responsibility by removing many of the safety standards it once provided to women using abortion drugs. … These dangerous drugs are now flooding states like Missouri and Idaho and sending women in these States to the emergency room.”\nThe parties filed the lawsuit with U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk of Texas. Last April, Judge Kacsmaryk ruled in favor of a previous lawsuit contending that the FDA illegally expedited its approval of the abortion pill, mifepristone, at the end of the Clinton administration in 2000. The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld much of his decision, but the U.S. Supreme Court later ruled the pro-life physicians who filed suit lacked standing to sue the FDA. Kacsmaryk served as deputy general counsel at the pro-life First Liberty Institute before his appointment to the court by President Donald Trump.\nThe laxer chemical abortion procedure also endangers teenage girls, contends the lawsuit filed by Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach (R), Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey (R), and Idaho Attorney General Rau?l Labrador (R). “In 2016, the agency also ignored the potential impacts that the removal of commonsense safeguards would have on adolescent girls, a violation of the Pediatric Research and Equity Act (PREA). It improperly relied on extrapolation in lieu of any safety assessment of the new regimen’s safety and effectiveness on pediatric populations,” says the lawsuit.\n“And the FDA needed to classify pregnancy as a ‘disease’ to avoid such a safety assessment. But pregnancy is not a disease,” states the complaint. The focus on adolescent health sets it apart from the previous Supreme Court case.\nThe action has won praise from the pro-life movement. The “American Life League applauds the attorney generals of Missouri, Kansas, and Idaho for filling a suit against the FDA for its recklessness in allowing the deadly abortion pill regimen to be sent through the mail,” Katie Brown, national director of the American Life League (ALL), told The Washington Stand.\nShe continued, “We are hopeful that this lawsuit will put a stop to the deadly abortion pill drug cartel, which illegally traffics these unregulated drugs across our border, into states with abortion restrictions. Thanks to the FDA, we have no idea of how many women and babies have paid the ultimate price due to unfettered access to chemical abortion. The cases that we do know about are heartbreaking, and only scratch the surface of the demonic attempt to make these pills so accessible. It is our hope and prayer that this suit will expose the abortion pill for what it is, a barbaric practice that takes an innocent life every single time.”\nALL issued a report titled “ Beneath the Surface: Exposing the Abortion Pill Drug Cartel ,” which argued the abortion “pill network is modeled after the drug cartel, creating an abortion pill crisis similar to our nation’s narcotics crisis.”\n“Every state in America should sue the FDA, along with Planned Parenthood, the facilitator and referral agent, and hold them accountable,” ALL Vice President Hugh Brown told TWS. “Shut these murderers down.”\nLifeNews Note: Ben Johnson is senior reporter and editor at The Washington Stand.",

    "text": "Per un dipendente su dodici del settore privato in Nuova Aquitania, avere un lavoro non garantisce una vita dignitosa. Basandosi su una definizione di “salario basso” inferiore a 1.394 euro mensili (1), in equivalente tempo pieno, l'INSEE regionale è arrivato a questa cifra dell'8%. Questo è quanto rivela uno studio pubblicato giovedì 28 novembre 2024.\nLa povertà salariale varia in modo significativo da un dipartimento all’altro. Deux-Sèvres ottiene così un risultato decisamente migliore con un tasso salariale basso nel settore privato inferiore al 6,5%. Vienna si colloca esattamente nella media regionale.\nArtigiani in difficoltà\nIl profilo tipico del lavoratore a basso salario è quello dell'operaio o impiegato con scarsa o nessuna qualifica (43% del totale), molto spesso a tempo parziale, con contratto a tempo determinato.\nSono i lavori del settore terziario a pagare di meno, mentre i salari nell’industria e nell’edilizia sono molto più ragionevoli. Se la maggior parte dei lavoratori mal pagati opera nel settore delle pulizie e dell’aiuto domestico, sono gli artigiani non qualificati che faticano di più per guadagnarsi da vivere: oltre il 60% sono sottoccupati.\nDonne e giovani sono particolarmente colpiti dai bassi salari\nPoi vengono i lavoratori non qualificati nell’industria, i lavoratori domestici nelle case private, gli impiegati nell’orticoltura, ecc. Le donne sono particolarmente preoccupate: sebbene rappresentino meno della metà dei dipendenti del settore privato (46%), ad esse spetta il 54% dei bassi salari, a causa particolare al gran numero di lavoratori a tempo parziale (il doppio degli uomini).\nLa percentuale di giovani (sotto i 26 anni), che rappresentano il 20% dei dipendenti del settore privato, sale al 30% dei dipendenti scarsamente retribuiti. Questa situazione particolare si spiega con la mancanza di formazione all'inizio della carriera e con i frequenti periodi in cui questi giovani lavoratori sono disoccupati.\n(1) Dati 2022, poco più del salario minimo mensile.",

    "text": "Methodist Healthcare Ministries Commits $3 Million to Central Texas Flood Relief Efforts\nLisa Valadez |\n7/10/2025, 1:26 p.m.\nIn the wake of catastrophic flooding that struck Central Texas over the past weekend, Methodist Healthcare Ministries (MHM) has committed $3 million to support relief and recovery efforts across affected communities.\nThe flooding, triggered by days of intense rainfall, inundated homes, damaged infrastructure, and displaced hundreds of residents throughout the Texas Hill Country and surrounding areas. Emergency crews and local organizations have been working around the clock to provide shelter, supplies, and medical assistance to those in need.\nMHM's $3 million pledge aims to bolster these efforts by providing both immediate relief and long-term recovery support. Of the total commitment, $1.15 million has already been allocated to eight nonprofit and community-based organizations working on the ground. These funds will assist with emergency housing, shelter operations, mental health services, grief counseling, and other urgent needs.\nInitial Fund Allocations:\n- Light on the Hill at Mount Wesley: $300,000\n- LiftFund: $500,000\n- Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country: $100,000\n- United Way of San Antonio: $50,000\n- Rio Texas Conference of the United Methodist Church: $50,000\n- Concho Valley Regional Food Bank: $50,000\n- McCulloch County Resource Center: $50,000\n- New Hope Counseling Center: $50,000\nMethodist Healthcare Ministries has a longstanding presence in the region through its network of Wesley Nurses and community health workers. As recovery efforts evolve, MHM plans to expand its regional footprint by deploying additional funding, partnerships, and resources tailored to long-term community support and resilience.\nThe remaining $1.85 million of MHM’s commitment will be distributed in phases as more needs are identified by local partners and residents impacted by the disaster.\nThis initiative continues MHM’s tradition of supporting vulnerable populations across South and Central Texas, particularly in times of crisis. As communities begin the difficult process of rebuilding, MHM’s ongoing involvement is expected to provide both practical assistance and a foundation for long-term recovery.",
