    "text": "RESTAURANT ROUNDUP: Roaches and rodent poison contribute to failed health inspection\nEL PASO COUNTY, Colo. (KRDO) - Feb. 10-14 was not great stretch of days for restaurants in El Paso County, with a nine not passing their health inspections.\nWith a total of 12 violations, the Arabian Nights Cafe on North Academy didn't have the most violations for the week, but its violations seemed to be the most troubling.\nThe problems there include not having a certified food protection manager.\nThe inspector also found food contact surfaces that were unclean.\nIn addition, the owner was also storing and using something called \"tracking powder,\" a type of poison for rodents that is not allowed inside restaurants at all.\nDead cockroaches were also found in several areas of the facility, and \"several traps were located on food preparation surfaces.\"\nAccording to the inspection report, the owners were advised to address the infestation.\nWhen confronted about the problems by KRDO13 Investigates, owner Kareem Alshami said the roaches were from a long time ago, and blamed his neighbor at the shopping center for the insects.\nHowever, workers at the barber shop next door later told KRDO13 Investigates the only roaches they had seen came from the wall adjacent to the cafe.\nRegarding the tracking powder, Alshami admitted he didn't know it wasn't supposed to be used in restaurants.\nHe told KRDO13 Investigates it was a preventative measure, not a means to get rid of rodents, claiming he doesn't have any rodent problems.\nTo prove it, he showed us a report from a pest control company on Monday that stated, \"no activity seen.\"\nAlshami said he was working on his food safety certification, but a language barrier was making that challenging.\nThe 92 Chicken on Centennial near Garden of the Gods had 13 violations.\nAmong them, the person in charge failed to wash their hands before putting on gloves to prepare food.\nAccording to the inspector, the restaurant was also using unapproved methods of holding fried chicken, by leaving it out and then reheating it before serving it.\n92 Chicken also lost points for having \"dust and other accumulations of debris on the floor throughout the facility\" as well as a buildup of grease on the ventilation hood.\nWhen asked about the violations, the owner told KRDO13 Investigates the inspector came the day after a busy Superbowl Sunday, when they were still cleaning up parts of the restaurant.\nThe owner added that his method of \"double frying\" chicken Korean style is perfectly safe and didn't understand why it was labeled an unapproved method.\n92 Chicken was re-inspected on Wednesday, and only two violations were found.\nThe Mama Fang inside Chapel Hills Mall also had 13 violations.\nThey include a worker not washing hands between tasks, and not having soap at the handwashing sink.\nThe inspector also found raw beef was stored above ready-to-eat food in the cooler.\nWhen reached by phone on Tuesday, the manager on duty said they were in the process of training a new employee and described the inspection as a \"great lesson\" that the staff would learn from.\nSeveral restaurants also earned high marks from inspectors last week.\nJust one violation was found at the Gyro Express at Avenue 19 on Tejon, as well as the Wendy's at North Academy and Voyager, and the Whataburger and North Academy and Montebello.\nTwo other Whataburgers, however, were perfect.\nThey include the location on Dublin near Powers, and also the location on Constitution near Powers.\n\"What a burger,\" says Operating Partner Avery McCoy, \"We try to get that across to every customer as soon as they bite it, what a burger.\"\nWith a massive kitchen, 60 workers, and roughly 500 orders a day, managing the location at Constitution and Powers is no small order.\nOften times an unannounced health inspection can upset the balance and create delays for customers or errors by the staff, but McCoy says it's not a problem at this restaurant.\n\"Yeah, people get nervous when there's a health inspector in there,\" he explained, \"but just do what you normally do on a daily basis, do what you know, and you'll be good in the end.\"\nKeep an eye out for the Top Score and Perfect Score stickers at your favorite restaurants to know that the kitchen inside is clean.\nClick here and select \"Retail Food\" from the pulldown menu to see the most recent restaurant inspections in El Paso County.",

    "text": "Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) said the number of overseas employment certificates (OECs) it issued in 2023 increased by 17% compared to the record in 2022.\n“Parehong umakyat—608,000 sea-based this year, 554,000 last year; land-based this year, 491,000, last year 411,000,” DMW officer-in-charge Hans Leo Cacdac said in a press conference.\n(Both increased—for sea-based, 608,000 OECs were issued this year compared to 554,000 last year; for land-based, 491,000 this year compared to 411,000 last year.)\n“On both fronts tumaas pero mas notable iyong 608,000 because first time tayo nag-issue ng 608,000 for the sea-based sector,” Cacdac added.\n(On both fronts, they increased but the number of OECs for the sea-based sector is more notable because it is the first time that we have issued 608,000 for the sea-based sector.)\nCacdac attributed the increase to the opening up of the economy in recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWith this development, the DMW said they anticipated that the number of OEC issuances in 2023 would breach the all-time high record.\nCiting an estimate from the World Bank, the DMW said OFW remittances already reached around $40 billion in 2023, compared to the $32 billion record in 2022.\nMeanwhile, the DMW reported that for this year it had assisted 382 victims of human trafficking in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, as well as 372 illegal recruitment victims in Italy.\nAmid the Israel-Hamas war, a total of 555 OFWs were repatriated. In connection with the Sudan civil war, 700 OFWs were also sent back to the Philippines. — DVM, GMA Integrated News",

    "text": "Superbells Coral Sun made its debut in 2020 and has been racking up awards from north to south. By that I mean Top Performer from Michigan State to Mississippi State, and you can add Perfect Score at University of Tennessee and Director’s Select at Penn State. Now that I have grown it for a few years, The Garden Guy can give it a \"Holy wow,\" too!\nLike most of the Superbells, it can reach 12 inches tall with a spread of 24 inches, though I can give it one exception to that rule. I planted one in the spring of 2022, and it was mega-big one year later. I am clueless as to how it made it a whole year other than its temperature tolerances staying within the threshold. I say that, but I love planting them in October if I can get them. They seem perfect for my Georgia zone 8 garden. I really believe growers and gardeners alike are missing a real opportunity.\nSuperbells Coral Sun has proven itself, as have most of the rest in the series, at having a natural attraction for bees, butterflies and hummingbirds. You have to admit there is nothing quite like seeing Spicebush swallowtails feeding on the Coral Sun blossoms.\nPeople are also reading…\nThough spring is around 50 days away, I am already sensing a little anxiety in the garden world centered around the orange-flowered Supertunia Persimmon. The flaming orange and yellow blossoms seem to have taken the garden world by storm. The anxiety, however, is centered on the ability to find them in the marketplace.\nWell, enter the Superbells Coral Sun calibrachoa. It looks for all the world to be the younger sister, if you will, to Supertunia Persimmon petunia. Petunias and calibrachoas are related, so to be a little more scientifically correct, they would not be sisters but cousins.\nFor the sake of this experiment, we were able to get a large bowl with great potting spoil planted with Supertunia Persimmon petunia, August Lavender heliotrope, Supertunia Vista Snowdrift petunia, Whirlwind Blue scaevola and the star of this column, the Superbells Coral Sun calibrachoa.\nThe colors and patterns of Supertunia Persimmon and Superbells Coral Sun seemed almost identical and were breathtakingly beautiful. As you would expect, the Supertunia Persimmon was larger in both stature and blooms. The Superbells Coral Sun, however, was no slouch in either attractiveness or the sheer number of blooms.\nSo, the point being is, either one will fit your desire for that dazzling show of color. As you probably already know, partnerships with blue seem to create those goosebump-type feelings and the desire to do something similar at your house. I’ve grown mine with Supertunia Mini Vista Indigo and in another combination with Superbena verbenas.\nAt the Young’s Plant Farm Annual Garden Tour in Auburn, Alabama, they featured Superbells Coral Sun calibrachoa in a raised bed with Superbells Double calibrachoas that seemed to have light blue flowers. The Coral Sun shocked with an almost uncountable number of flowers.\nThis raised bed soil had the best organic amendments, which is what you will need, too. Or plant in containers with a high-grade potting soil. You do this, feed with a water-soluble fertilizer every two to three weeks and water as needed; you'll have garnered the green-thumb award. Most of us in the South will also cut back by about a third sometime in August to set up for a great fall bloom.\nIf you are like everyone else and you want Supertunia Persimmon petunia, just remember that if you can't find it, try the award-winning Superbells Coral Sun calibrachoa. Your designs will be just as riveting.",

In his latest tweet, he gave opinions about the\nAtlanta Falcons acquiring pass rusher Matthew Judon, and many online joked and showed support for the situation.\n“can you break ur firing??” said one commenter.\n“Bro got fired and posted this,” said another about Griffin\n“Bro, you are undervalued at ESPN. Can’t wait to see unfettered and independent RGIII or see you go to Fox,” said another in support.\n“One of the few times I’ll ever say this- but espn screwed up.

    "title": "Pope Francis Authorizes WEF To Rewrite ‘Fact Checked’ Holy Bible",
    "text": "The World Economic Forum has been granted authorization by Pope Francis to rewrite the Holy Bible, according to a WEF insider who reveals the pope wants the new “fact-checked” version of the Bible to be far more political, with a central place for the primacy of nature, and far less about God. Pope Francis has already declared that Klaus Schwab is more important than Jesus Christ and now he is determined to dismantle Christianity from the inside and replace God’s word with the demonic vision of the global elite. BYPASS THE CENSORS Sign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox. You can unsubscribe any time. By subscribing you agree to our [Terms of Use](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/website-terms-of-use/) Pope Francis’ decision has caused a storm in the Vatican, but should we really be surprised by his support for the elite’s New World Order? As an [Agenda Contributor](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/authors/popefrancis) at the WEF, Pope Francis is fluent in blasphemy and is actively working to subvert the church and Christianity across the world. Before we dive in, [subscribe to the channel](https://rumble.com/c/THEPEOPLESVOICE) if you haven’t already, and [join the People’s Voice Locals community](https://peoplesvoice.locals.com/support) to support the channel and gain access to uncensored content. Pope Francis’ inverted version of Christianity is confusing for many, however the picture becomes clear when you understand who the pontiff is really serving. This is the pope who joined forces [with Bill Clinton](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/bill-clinton-and-pope-francis-call-for-urgent-depopulation-to-save-the-planet/) in September to announce that humanity must be urgently depopulated to save the planet. And this is the pope who informed his flock that “relationships with Jesus are dangerous and harmful.” Breaking with centuries of Christian tradition, Francis sparked fears that he is an illegitimate pope with a sinister agenda when he told a crowd of 33,000 pilgrims in St. Peter’s Square that “a personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ” must be avoided at all costs. As though that wasn’t disturbing enough, Francis followed up by [ordering](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/pope-francis-orders-christians-stop-proselytizing-dont-attract-more-people) Christians to stop bringing people from other faiths to Jesus and Christianity. Pope Francis is a Satanist hiding in plain sight. And then he ordered his lackeys in the Vatican to proclaim that Lucifer is the God of the Catholic Church. That’s right, according to Pope Francis’ twisted mind, Lucifer is Jesus Christ’s father and the God of the Catholic Church. Obviously the new globalist Bible must be rejected out of hand by all self-respecting and god-fearing Christians. But what can we expect from this demonic text? Yuval Noah Harari, who serves as Klaus Schwab’s right hand man at the WEF, went on record stating that the Bible is “fake news” and full of hate speech, and the elites can use AI to replace the Bible and create a unified “religion that is actually correct.” Harari, who is known as ‘The Prophet’ in Davos circles, made the statement while giving a speech on the “future of humanity.” According to Harari, the power of AI can be harnessed and used to reshape spirituality to accept the WEF’s globalist vision. The people at The Economist know things that most people don’t and their magazine covers have a long history of telling us in advance about the political, economic and cultural developments that the elite have in store for us. Just one month before Harari’s speech, the Economist appeared to be signing from the same hymn sheet. Klaus Schwab famously boasted about how his Young Global Leaders have taken over the world and the WEF has penetrated cabinets in all of the leading democracies. But it’s not just the cabinets. The global elite understand their dark spirituality can only succeed in a world devoid of religion. So they decided to destroy the world’s major religions from the inside. WikiLeaks [emails](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/wikileaks-soros-vatican-coup) taught us that Francis was installed in the Vatican in a globalist coup orchestrated by George Soros, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. And the globalist bulldog wasted no time repaying his globalist masters by repeating disturbing globalist rhetoric at every opportunity. In 2017, Pope Francis called for a [“one world government”](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/pope-francis-one-world-government/) and “political authority”, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat issues such as “climate change.” Speaking with Ecuador’s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations does not have enough power and must be granted full governmental control “for the good of humanity.” Disturbingly, world religious leaders are also beginning to come together as one to preach from the same hymn sheet, instructing their sheep to accept the components of the New World Order’s one world government. Now, Pope Francis is actively defying Biblical scripture by working to rewrite the Bible along globalist principles and create a “one world religion.” First Francis shocked the Christian world by hosting Islamic prayers and Quran recitals in the Vatican. Then he took off his shoes in Istanbul’s Blue Mosque, faced Mecca, and prayed to Allah. Then came the pagan ceremony and brazen idol worship on Vatican grounds. Somebody needs to remind Francis that the Bible says “You shall have no other gods before me.” This is expressed in Exodus 20:3, Matthew 4:10, Luke 4:8 and elsewhere. But it’s unlikely Francis would be interested. He is more interested in overruling God’s word and eradicating Christianity in favor of what he calls “Chrislam.” The world is now at a tipping point, with a fierce battle raging for the soul of humanity. The globalists and their technocratic dreams of totalitarian rule threaten to consume humanity and destroy civilisation as we know it. It’s clear whose side Francis is on. And we haven’t even covered the pedophilia scandal that is rotting the Catholic church from the inside out. We should keep a very close eye on this Jesuit pope during these pivotal years. Here at the People’s Voice we are determined to continue exposing the crimes of the globalist elite but we need your help.

    "text": "HOUSTON, Texas – When CenterPoint announced it was withdrawing its rate case last week , most customers assumed it was a good thing that the utility company wasn’t asking to raise rates again. But several cities, including Houston, say Centerpoint should be lowering rates.\nIn a filing to the Public Utility Commission on August 8, The Gulf Coast Coalition of Cities, the Texas Coast Utilities Coalition , the Houston Coalition of Cities, and the Texas Consumer Association asked the PUC not to allow CenterPoint to drop the case.\nRecommended Videos\nThey say doing so deprives them of the chance to explain why they say CenterPoint is overcharging ratepayers by as much as $100 million every year.\nIn a rate case, the PUC can raise rates, lower rates, or not change them at all.\nPart of the filing reads:\n“In this case, dismissal would prevent ratepayers from receiving the benefit of a significant rate decrease and would enable CenterPoint to avoid a required filing only to impose substantial costs on ratepayers in a future proceeding.”\nFiling to the PUC says dismissal would deprive ratepayers of the benefit of a rate decrease. (Copyright 2024 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.) A judge has given CenterPoint until August 14, 2024 to respond.\nIn a statement released by the company last week, CenterPoint said the decision to withdraw a previous rate increase request was centered around rebuilding trust with the community and wanting to focus on improving resiliency around Houston as the hurricane season continues.\nThursday evening, CenterPoint sent the following statement to KPRC 2:\nOur collective focus is taking action to be better prepared this hurricane season. That is our singular focus and why we launched the Greater Houston Resilience Initiative this week. Withdrawing our base rate case with the PUCT will support our commitments to strengthen our resiliency, improve our communications and enhance our emergency coordination. We look forward to providing more information on August 14th as part of our overall commitment to become the most resilient coastal utility in the country.\nCopyright 2024 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Total, i crimini di guerra in Mozambico e quel progetto fossile garantito dall’italiana SACE",
    "text": "La multinazionale energetica francese TotalEnergies sarebbe stata a conoscenza di atrocità che potrebbero configurarsi come crimini di guerra, compiute dall’esercito mozambicano tra giugno e luglio del 2021 sul perimetro del suo impianto Mozambique Lng, come riportato da un’ inchiesta del giornalista indipendente Alex Perry pubblicata il 26 settembre dal sito di informazione Politico . Le forze di sicurezza mozambicane erano presenti nell’area espressamente per proteggere le infrastrutture di TotalEnergies.\nMozambique Lng vede un consistente coinvolgimento italiano, dal momento che per il progetto estrattivo l’assicuratore pubblico SACE dovrebbe emettere una garanzia di 950 milioni di euro, con cui coprire i prestiti per le operazioni di Saipem, tra cui quello di Cassa depositi e prestiti del valore di 650 milioni di euro. SACE ha già supportato finanziariamente un altro progetto in Mozambico, con una garanzia di 700 milioni di euro: si tratta di Coral South Flng, progetto offshore di Eni, multinazionale energetica occidentale più attiva in Mozambico insieme proprio a Total.\nCome segnalato anche nell’articolo di Perry, proprio grazie a una richiesta di accesso agli atti inoltrata da ReCommon a Cassa depositi e prestiti, si è appreso che TotalEnergies avesse tutti gli elementi a disposizione per essere a conoscenza degli abusi commessi dai militari mozambicani già prima dell’estate del 2021.\nNella valutazione sugli impatti ambientali e sociali del progetto, la stessa Cdp confermava l’esistenza di rischi legati a “diversi atti di violenza di gruppi armati”. D’altra parte, la valutazione di Cdp sui rischi ambientali e sociali per Mozambique Lng si basa su quella eseguita da SACE, che “ha comunicato a Cdp che il documento non è suscettibile di ostensione”.\n“Da più di un anno il Tar e il Consiglio di Stato hanno sancito il diritto di ReCommon di entrare in possesso delle informazioni ambientali e sociali su cui si basa la valutazione di SACE per le garanzie in favore di Mozambique Lng, diritto a cui SACE continua a opporsi”, afferma Simone Ogno di ReCommon. “E alla luce dell’inchiesta pubblicata su Politico , abbiamo ragione di credere che voglia nascondere il fatto di aver condotto una scarsa due diligence sul progetto”.\n“Due interrogazioni parlamentari chiedono conto a SACE su questa vicenda, fino al momento senza alcuna risposta. È arrivato il momento che l’agenzia faccia chiarezza, e che si tiri fuori dal progetto nel caso non abbia ancora finalizzato l’emissione della garanzia”, aggiunge il campaigner .\nAll’indomani degli attacchi di fine marzo e inizio aprile 2021 da parte degli insorti di Ahl al-Sunnah wa al Jamma’ah alla città mozambicana di Palma, l’autore dell’articolo apparso su Politico ha condotto una ricerca approfondita per scoprire il numero di vittime del cosiddetto “massacro dei container ”.\nSecondo Perry, le truppe mozambicane hanno assalito centinaia di civili che cercavano sicurezza dagli insorti e hanno imprigionato gli uomini in container metallici senza finestre all’ingresso del sito di Mozambique Lng. L’articolo riporta che gli uomini -da 180 a 250- sono stati detenuti per tre mesi, privati dell’acqua, costretti alla fame, picchiati, soffocati, torturati, accoltellati e, infine, la maggior parte di loro è “scomparsa”. Solo 26 sono sopravvissuti e rilasciati solo nel settembre 2021.\nLe donne sono state sottoposte a umiliazioni e ripetute violenze sessuali per uno o due giorni prima di essere rilasciate. Maxime Rabilloud, direttore generale di Mozambique Lng, sussidiaria di TotalEnergies, afferma che la società non sia “a conoscenza dei presunti eventi descritti” né di essere in possesso di “alcuna informazione che indichi che tali eventi abbiano avuto luogo”.\nGli attacchi di aprile 2021 hanno portato alla dichiarazione di forza maggiore da parte di TotalEnergies e alla sospensione del progetto, tuttora in vigore, anche se di recente il colosso francese ha rilasciato numerose dichiarazioni che ventilerebbero la possibilità di riprendere a breve le operazioni di estrazione e liquefazione del gas.\nNel 2023 i familiari delle vittime e i sopravvissuti agli attacchi hanno presentato una denuncia legale, accusando la società energetica francese di non aver protetto i suoi subappaltatori e di non aver fornito il carburante necessario per l’evacuazione dei civili durante l’attacco di Palma. In seguito alla denuncia, il pubblico ministero francese ha chiesto a TotalEnergies di commentare la denuncia per poi decidere se proseguire il caso, archiviarlo o svolgere ulteriori indagini.\nNel 2021, Amnesty International ha accusato le forze di sicurezza mozambicane di crimini di guerra, eppure TotalEnergies, almeno fino a poco tempo fa, forniva direttamente alla Joint Task Force (Jtf) mozambicana cibo, attrezzature e compensi finanziari.\nIn un rapporto commissionato da TotalEnergies nel 2023 sulla situazione umanitaria a Cabo Delgado, l’autore del rapporto, Jean-Christophe Rufin, è stato molto critico sull’accordo firmato tra TotalEnergies e l’esercito mozambicano. Ha concluso che quel rapporto diretto potrebbe far apparire TotalEnergies come parte del conflitto ai sensi della Convenzione di Ginevra.\nNumerose organizzazioni della società civile internazionale, tra cui Justiça Ambiental/Friends of the Earth Mozambique, Milieudefensie/Friends of the Earth Netherlands e Reclaim Finance chiedono “un’indagine ufficiale sull’accaduto e per verificare la posizione di TotalEnergies, alla luce della sua cooperazione con le forze di sicurezza mozambicane accusate di gravi crimini, tra cui stupri, omicidi e torture, configurabili come crimini di guerra”.\n“Gli ultimi sviluppi di questa vicenda sollevano molte domande anche sull’operato di Eni, che proprio in Mozambico vorrebbe espandere il suo business con i progetti Coral North Flng e Rovuma Lng, e di istituzioni finanziarie come Intesa Sanpaolo e Unicredit, pronte a finanziarli -conclude Ogno-. È giunto il momento di interrompere la corsa al gas mozambicano”.\n© riproduzione riservata",
