    "text": "NATO base near Germany's Geilenkirchen raises security level over 'potential threat' Story highlights Speaking to the news agency Reuters, a spokesperson for the base in Geilenkirchen said that the threat level had been raised to Charlie, the second-highest of four states of alert. The NATO (National Atlantic Treaty Organization) airbase near Germany's Geilenkirchen raised its security level due to a potential threat late Thursday (Aug 22). In a post on X, the base said that the security level was raised based on intelligence information indicating a potential threat. \"All non-mission essential staff have been sent home as a precautionary measure. The safety of our staff is our top priority. Operations continue as planned,\" the base added. Threat level raised to Charlie Speaking to the news agency Reuters, a spokesperson for the base in Geilenkirchen said that the threat level had been raised to Charlie, the second-highest of four states of alert. The Charlie alert is defined as \"an incident (that) has occurred or intelligence has been received indicating that some form of terrorist action against NATO organisations or personnel is highly likely.\" It was the second time the base housing NATO's fleet of AWACS surveillance planes raised the security level after an incident last week when a military base in nearby Cologne was temporarily sealed off as authorities investigated possible sabotage of the water supply. The same day, the base in Geilenkirchen also reported an attempted trespassing incident. Reuters reported that about the suspected sabotage at the base in Cologne, the German military later gave the all-clear, saying test results had shown that the tap water was not contaminated. Germany on high alert Germany, an important ally of Ukraine, has been on high alert for sabotage and attacks on military facilities in the country in the wake of Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In April this year, investigators arrested two German-Russian men on suspicion of spying for Russia and planning attacks in Germany -- including on US army facilities -- to undermine military support for Ukraine.
