    "text": "Asim Jones’ first text from Jesse Bopp made the difference.\nInitial contact occurred after College of Southern Idaho’s first game.\nThe interest increased with each game. Other offers piled in but Jones noticed the genuine nature of it all and honored Bopp’s Florida International University squad with a commitment.\nCSI standout guard Jones signed his National Letter of Intent on Thursday with the NCAA Division I Panthers.\n“It means a lot,” Jones told the Times-News. “I definitely worked really hard to get here. Had a setback last year. Had a good experience to learn from other players. Got a chance this year. I took the role to be one of the best players on the team. Definitely feel good.”\nJones, a 2024 NJCAA Honorable Mention All-American and First Team Region 18 selection, transitioned from a role player to a key starter.\nPeople are also reading…\nCSI men’s basketball guard Asim Jones earned NJCAA Division I Honorable Mention All-American honors, announced Tuesday.\nJones, with timely speed and flashy handles, led the Golden Eagles with 17.5 points and 4.3 assists per game.\nThe Golden Eagles finished as Region 18 runners-up.\n“It is a good place for him,” CSI head coach Jeff Reinert said. “He likes that. We want all of our players to sign.”\nJones joined Kasen Carpenter (NAIA Carroll College) as CSI’s signees so far from the 2023-24 team.\nMinico alumnus Kasen Carpenter is trying to work his way back into the rotation after breaking his right hand earlier this season.\nJones waited his turn as a freshman on a squad who occupied the top national ranking for a chunk of the season and recorded the second undefeated regular season in program history.\nHe sat behind a roster full of six Division I signees, including First Team All-American guard Isaiah Moses and Honorable Mention All-American forward Rob Whaley Jr, observed their tendencies and applied those to his game as a sophomore.\n“Just being a good person,” Jones said. “If I wasn’t good, I wouldn’t be here so it wasn’t the talent. It was just me being a better person… Last year, I had a lot of talks with the coaches. I was childish. Just watching them and growing. I definitely improved.”\nJones, a Paterson, New Jersey, native, chose the Panthers from a top three which included Middle Tennessee State University and Rider University.\nFIU, based in Miami, competes in the Conference USA.\n“I can’t wait to get on the court out there, for sure,” Jones said. “Finally put on a Florida International jersey so it definitely feels good.”",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#4](c4#c-4) Es una manera de verlo. Otra es que unos cuantos españoles se han marchado a países menos corruptos, han visto que se vive mejor así y evitan votar a los partidos que mantienen aquí niveles indecentes de corrupción.\nPero hay de todo…\n[#4](c4#c-4) te recomiendo algo más de fibra en tu dieta, parece que aún no has digerido el que no ganaran los tuyos\n[#4](c4#c-4) que yo conozca la gente que emigra a EEUU normalmente son gente con títulos superiores donde irse a América es muy buena opción laboral, y ya esta, si votan a la izquierda española sera porque ven desde fuera que es mejor opción.\nQue pasa con los que votan a la derecha?\nQue significaria?\nPor cierto a mayor nivel de estudios el votante de izquierda aumenta, tampoco dices nada de eso?\n[#37](c37#c-37) Ay pobres comunistas que el problema que tienen es que son dependientes de importar todo de EEUU.\nPues que sepas que la mayoría del pollo en Cuba viene de Miami, el embargo está hoy en día muy limitado.\nAh, y en la guerra fría había más gente en el bloque comunista que en el bloque capitalista.. y aun así al bloque capitalista le iba mil veces mejor y no necesitaban para nada a los comunistas.\n[#1](c1#c-1) No veo relación entre el fanatismo religioso cristiano y los problemas político sociales en latinoamérica.\nEl Salvador es de los países más evangélicos, junto a Brasil, y las cosas les han empezado a ir bien.\nArgentina y Venezuela no son países de corte religioso evangélico y están comiendo mierda.\nEn Cuba ni religiosos son, y no tienen ni para comer mierda.\n[#33](c33#c-33) derecha y diosito van siempre juntitos, si te convenzo que estás en la tierra para sufrir a cambio de una recompensa cuando te mueras, aguantas mejor que te pisen, porque a mayor sufrimiento mayor recompensa\n[#33](c33#c-33) Simple, estos tipos se oponen al planamiento familiar.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4449999/\n[#1](c1#c-1) por no hablar de que sus antepasados se arrancarían los pelos de desesperación por ver como han abrazado la religión que los masacró\nY los testigos de Jehová. Antes estaban a la salida de los hospitales con sus plafones. Ahora los veo en: la salida del metro, de los parques y en cualquier esquina o paseo. De 3 en 3. Si no les miras no te molestan, al menos en mi experiencia, pero me parece preocupante cómo van invadiendo el espacio público para su negocio de proselitismo religioso. ¿Puedo plantar un plafón con folletos de mi empresa 7 u 8 horas allá dónde me apetezca y abordar a los transeúntes?\n[#3](c3#c-3) al igual que llevan toda la vida ocupando espacio publico los mendigos, los que reparten folletos, los grupos de turistas guiados.... mientras la ocupacion no sea permanente, no hay problema\n[#3](c3#c-3) En mi pequeña ciudad de 40k habitantes el otro día me crucé a cuatro así, todos eran latinos. Les dije con palabras poco amables que se fueran con sus historias a su templo, que la calle no era lugar para ello. Eran muy ridículos, hablaban con una grandiosidad típica de pastor evangélico y que si la gloria de dios y mierdas así. Llamé a la policía. Me parece sumamente preocupante esto. Uno de ellos aún venía con ese falso buen rollo a \"debatir\" conmigo y me hacía preguntas de lo más ridículas. Largo de la calle por favor.\n[#21](c21#c-21) y que pasó cuando llamaste a la policía? Que te dijeron los guardias? conseguiste que se fueran?\n[#42](c42#c-42) Se fueron a la hora aproximadamente, pero no sé si por su propio pie o por la policía, ya que yo volví donde ellos media hora larga después y ahí seguían. La poli dijo que iba a mandar una patrulla y vi un coche una hora después de llamarles, pero capaz que iban a otro sitio, así que no puedo confirmar. Me olía que estos predicadores eran evangélicos pagados por alguien de aquí o de allá para hacer la ruta, porque el brasileño tenía un acento increíble y hablaba español justo.\n[#3](c3#c-3) pero esos, \"por fortuna\", son tan radicales que no van a ser mayoría nunca y hasta la fecha no se meten en política. Por lo demás, totalmente de acuerdo.\nYo lo llamaría \"fe seudocristiana\", porque muchas veces esto no está movido por una fe religiosa, sino que la fe religiosa es solo el medio para mover otra cosa, por ejemplo, mantener a la gente distraída odiando el aborto o a los homosexuales mientras no se dan cuenta de que otros se están quedando con la mayor parte de su esfuerzo al trabajar.\nLo peor es que muchos de esos nuevos templos se construyen en base a la necesidad de las gentes que acuden a ellos, aportan \"lo que no tienen\" y cuatro vividores y sus comparsas se hacen de oro. Para colmo, les adoctrinan con ideología neoliberal envuelta en el evangelio de \"san saduceo\" , que les promete la \"prosperidad\", sobre todo la material, demonizando todo sentido crítico que les haga pensar que ese sistema económico es el que les mantiene en la servidumbre y la desigualdad y del que muy pocos saldrán , que siempre son los que les piden el diezmo y lo que haga falta \"para el culto\", que no es otro que el que zarandea un libro con dorso dorado y una cruz desde el atril...\nLa religión era prácticamente la única cosa de LATAM que EEUU no controlaba, pero con el evangelismo es probable que en una década o dos reemplace al catolicismo en cantidad de seguidores.\nLas personas más insoportables del mundo son los conversos en cualquier modo. Religión, pelo blanco, deporte, vegetariano..., debe ser como ves que tu vida es una mierda y te has equivocado quieres imponer a los demás tu vida de p... Mierda",
