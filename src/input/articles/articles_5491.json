    "title": "Lottie Markwell of Mt. Zion first baby of 2024 at Sarah Bush Lincoln",
    "text": "MATTOON — Lottie Taylor Markwell of Mount Zion has become the first baby to be born in 2024 at Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center, arriving early Wednesday morning three days into the new year. Lottie, who weighed 6 pounds, 8 ounces and measured 21 inches tall at birth, is the daughter of Adam and Maggie Markwell. Her father grew in Greenup in Cumberland County and her mother was raised in Mattoon in Coles County. Adam Markwell said they moved to Mount Zion in May so that he could take a job with the Illinois State Police in Decatur, but they opted to seek pregnancy care from Sarah Bush Lincoln in his wife's hometown due to the proximity to extended family there. \"We thought it would be easier with childcare,\" Adam Markwell. The couple also has another child, 2-year-old Charles. That proximity was particularly helpful after Maggie Markwell's contractions started overnight Tuesday. Adam said they were able to drop off Charles with her parents, Jeff and Melissa Price in Mattoon, on the way to the health center. In addition, Adam Markwell said they arranged ahead of time for his parents, Dennis and Jennifer Markwell, to pick up the family dog, a Golden Retriever named Chester, in Mount Zion and watch after him while they were in the hospital. Adam Markwell said the staff at Sarah Bush Lincoln's Women & Children's Center had prepared them for the possibility of a crowded labor and delivery wing, but his wife ended up being the only patient there that night. They had the medical staff to themselves for a while. \"Everyone was wonderful. We are glad to have a healthy baby,\" said Maggie Markwell, who worked as a nurse at the St. Louis Children's Hospital and is now focusing on being a stay-at-home mother. She and her husband said they knew Lottie might be the first baby of 2024 at Sarah Bush Lincoln but were pleasantly surprised when this was the case. Maggie Markwell said Lottie was born with \"dark hair, lots of it.\" Her husband said in regard to the color of the sleepy baby's eyes that, \"We have not seen too much of them, but they are blue.\" Adam Markwell said they had to \"warm (Charles) up to the idea of having a little sister,\" but he seemed to have an emotional connection to Lottie as soon as he saw her in the hospital room. Maggie said Charles kissed the newborn on the head, gave her a light hug, and later cried when she cried. \"(Charles) seems like he is going to be a good big brother for her,\" Adam Markwell said.

Grishaver, the current chair of the committee, spoke out regarding research by Parool published on Saturday based on personal files that were transferred to the National Archives in The Hague last year. Amsterdam Jews who survived the war and returned from the Nazi camps were spied on for decades, viewed by the State as extremists and a threat to democracy, [Parool reported](https://nltimes.nl/2023/12/23/netherlands-spent-years-spying-jews-involved-dutch-auschwitz-committee-wwii). The former domestic security service, BVD, compiled reports on meetings, commemorations, and memorials abroad. In a response, the AIVD, the successor to the BVD, refuted the assertion that Jews were specifically the subject of the spying operation, and said more context was needed. This is \"bizarre and shocking,\" the Sobibor Foundation said. \"This is beyond imagination.\" Their opinion was shared by Ronny Naftaniel, the former director of Israel and Jewish association CIDI, who said it was sickening. Grishaver was astonished by the research compiled by Parool. \"That a group of destitute Jews, who had all lost their families, were seen as extremists after returning to the Netherlands. And that reports were made about commemorations and trips made to the camps. It's just incomprehensible,\" he responded on Saturday afternoon. He wants more documents about the matter to be made public. He wants to know who would order such an investigation. Grishaver's Committee was formed to commemorate the Holocaust, and to share knowledge about the persecution, deportation, and mass murder of Jews during the War. But immediately after the War, there was very little interest in the lives of Jews, he said. They had to fight for any recognition at all. According to the AIVD, the BVD conducted investigations into communism during the Cold War. \"That was the greatest threat to national security at the time,\" the AIVD said. \"Possible investigations into persons associated with the National Auschwitz Committee should be viewed in that light.\" Security services suspected that the Committee was a front for the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN). “This is very bizarre,” said NSC party leader Pieter Omtzigt on X about the news. Omtzigt is a strong advocate for religious freedom in the Netherlands. \"I would like an explanation about it.\" Reporting by ANP",

Demnach könnte jedoch im Herbst 2025 Bewegung in den Markt kommen, da neue Prozessoren der Anbieter MediaTek und Qualcomm erwartet werden. Diese könnten maßgebliche Auswirkungen beim Thema Schnelligkeit der Geräte haben.\nÜber die Plattform\nAnTuTu (chinesisch: 安兔兔) ist laut eigenen Angaben eine weit verbreitete Benchmark-Software zur Leistungsmessung von Smartphones und anderen Geräten. Die Plattform wurde im Januar 2011 als Android-Benchmark-Anwendung gestartet.\nDie Rangliste des Anbieters basiert auf Durchschnittswerten von Benchmarks, die wiederum nützliche Nutzerstatistiken mit mindestens 1000 gültigen Ergebnissen im jeweiligen Monaten abbilden – im aktuellen Fall aus dem Juli 2025.\nInwiefern die Ergebnisse des Rankings zum chinesischen Markt auf den deutschen Markt übertragbar sind, muss allerdings kritisch hinterfragt werden.\nTipps und Tricks: Wird Ihr Android-Smartphone langsamer?\nMit der Nutzungszeit nimmt die Geschwindigkeit vieler Smartphones, die Android als Betriebssystem nutzen, ab – völlig unabhängig vom Gerät. Vielfach kann dieser Entwicklung jedoch entgegengewirkt werden. Folgende Tipps können laut dem Portal giga.de offenbar helfen:\n- Deaktivieren Sie Animationen: Unter dem Puntk „Eingabehilfen“ können im Menü Animationen ausgeschaltet werden. Auf diese Weise wird Rechenleistung gespart, vor allem beim Wechseln und Öffnen von Fenstern.\n- Leeren Sie Ihren Cache: Der Cache von Apps kann demnach problemlos geleert werden, um Speicherplatz freizugeben – ganz im Gegenteil zum Cache von Browsern, die wichtige Daten für Websites, die alltäglich angesteuert werden, liefern.\n- Schränken Sie Hintergrundprozesse ein: Apps, die dauerhaft im Hintergrund laufen, können problemlos entfernt werden.\n- Entfernen Sie Bloatware: Sogenannte Bloatware ist meist vorinstalliert und belegt Speicherplatz. Vielfach ist sie aber nicht notwendig und kann deinstalliert werden.\n(tu) Verwendete Quellen: antutu.com, chip.de, schmidtisblog.de, giga.de",

    "title": "Venezia, chiude il Fondaco dei Tedeschi: luci spente nel polo del lusso",
    "text": "VENEZIA - Luci spente. Da oggi il Fondaco dei Tedeschi, polo del lusso a Venezia gestito da Dfs del gruppo Lvmh (Louis Vuitton), è chiuso. Niente più vociare tra i quattro piani del palazzo che fu “fontego”, cuore del commercio, poi diventato sede delle Poste centrali in campo San Bartolomeo, a Rialto. Ieri si è definitivamente conclusa l'attività commerciale. Una chiusura del tutto inaspettata che ha spiazzato amministrazione, cittadini e dipendenti. Soprattutto per quest’ultimi ieri si è aperta una nuova parentesi: quella della disoccupazione. Ora ci sarà un mese di tempo per disallestire lo spazio, un mese per lasciare soltanto lo scheletro di uno dei più prestigiosi palazzi veneziani. Quando riaprirà e chi sarà il successore, è ancora da definire: certo è che il passaggio delle redini dovrà garantire una continuità con gli ultimi nove anni.\nL'inizio\nTutto è iniziato il primo ottobre del 2016, quando gli addetti alla sicurezza hanno aperto per la prima volta ai clienti le lucenti porte in vetro del Fondaco dei Tedeschi. Una sfida che partiva anche dall'idea che i visitatori sarebbero arrivati per osservare da vicino il lavoro di restauro fatto dall'archistar Rem Koolhaas con lo studio Oma e per godere della vista privilegiata sulla città dalla terrazza panoramica all'ultimo piano. Dopotutto era un bel cambiamento per quella struttura che un tempo ospitava le Poste e che, poi, con un restauro costato 35 milioni alla holding immobiliare del gruppo Benetton, è diventato uno degli “shopping mall” più ambiti di Venezia: fruito, desiderato e sognato, a seconda della disponibilità economica del visitatore. Ma il Fondaco ha guardato oltre, cercando di affermarsi anche come punto di riferimento sociale organizzando eventi, mostre e iniziative di varia natura.\nDa quel primo giorno a ieri, sono circa 18mila i visitatori che hanno varcato le porte del magazzino per vivere l’esperienza “fondaco”: camminare tra i più prestigiosi marchi di lusso, farsi abbagliare dai gioielli, coccolarsi con profumi e gusti di alta qualità, e per concludere, salire sulla terrazza mozzafiato per ricordarsi che la magia è proprio quella di trovarsi a Venezia. Sono state 1.500 le persone che ieri, per l’ultima volta, hanno prenotato la visita in terrazza. In 9 anni sono 216 gli eventi organizzati che hanno attirato 7.500 persone, 14 le mostre, 138 le visite guidate. Numeri che ribadiscono il fatto che il Fondaco dei Tedeschi, per molti, non era un semplice polo dello shopping. Era cultura, architettura e storia. La parentesi veneziana di Dfs al Fondaco ha iniziato a subire i primi colpi a causa del Covid, poi è interferita la geopolitica: fatti che hanno cambiato il pubblico, ma soprattutto il bilancio annuale del fondaco. Con la chiusura sono stati licenziati i primi 20 dipendenti. Per il 50% dei restanti 207 lavoratori, dichiarati in esubero, è iniziato l’iter di ricollocamento e il percorso di formazione (reskilling e upskilling) in coordinamento con il Centro di lavoro della Regione per agevolare la ricerca di un nuovo posto di lavoro in conformità alle esperienze lavorative maturate. Nel frattempo, lavoreranno un altro mese per le operazioni di disallestimento. Mobilio che, fa sapere il gruppo, verrà donato a scuole e teatri nel veneziano, tra cui il Teatro Goldoni. Alcuni verranno ricollocati in altri negozi e altri ancora messi all’asta per poi devolvere il ricavato ad associazioni come Avapo, Make a Wish e Agmen. Poi sul Fondaco dei Tedeschi marcato Dfs calerà il buio in attesa di un nuovo inizio.\nLe visite\n«Sono venuta per dire addio – racconta una signora all’uscita del negozio - Sono francese, ma vivo qua da 50 anni e ho frequentato spesso questo posto per partecipare agli eventi letterari. Provo molto dispiacere, tanto per i lavoratori». «Abbiamo visto l’apertura del “Fontego” e ora ne seguiamo anche la chiusura», sospira una coppia del trevigiano. Turisti, italiani e veneziani uniti da una speranza: quella di poter un giorno tornare al Fondaco, attraversarne di nuovo le porte e riscoprirne la bellezza.",

    "text": "Cenone di Capodanno: 10 cibi portafortuna da mettere in tavola Tradizioni antiche dal forte potere simbolico che richiamano non solo la ricchezza economica ma anche la fertilità e la buona sorte\ndi Laura De Benedetti\nIl Capodanno è un momento di festa e, soprattutto, di speranza . Il Cenone è il momento in cui, messo da parte il bilancio del 2023, si cerca di vivere con allegria e spensieratezza gli ultimi momenti dell’anno, con un grande brindisi affinché il 2024 porti buone cose .\nCosa c’è di meglio dunque che iniziare il nuovo anno con piatti che portano fortuna, colore, sapore e che nella maggior parte dei casi sono alla portata di tutte le tasche? Ecco dunque i cibi tradizionali italiani che, spesso secondo una lunga tradizione popolare, si crede portino prosperità . Non è necessario essere scaramantici per effettuare questo viaggio culinario attraverso le tradizioni del Capodanno in Italia e di imbandire la tavola con questi elementi della tradizione gastronomica\n1. Lenticchie, le ‘monete’ che indicano ricchezza\nLe lenticchie sono da secoli il cibo portafortuna per eccellenza\nLe lenticchie, con la loro forma simile a monete , sono considerate, sin dai tempi dei romani, vere e proprie gemme di prosperità durante il Capodanno. Mangiarle al cenone è un gesto simbolico , che ha lo scopo di augurare ai commensali un anno nuovo ricco di prosperità, soprattutto finanziaria. Le lenticchie, cucinate in zuppa o accompagnate da un soffritto, rappresentano un inizio abbondante e prosperoso: si tratta di una tradizione alquanto diffusa in molte parti del mondo.\n2. Maiale, simbolo di abbondanza Il maiale è un’ icona di abbondanza in molte culture: ovviamente, sin dall’antichità, chi lo possedeva, poteva ricavarne piatti succulenti e insaccati. Metterlo in tavola, dunque, che sia arrosto, stufato o preparato in altri modi, è simbolo di fortuna e buona salute, nel senso forse meno moderno che non si stava a bocca asciutta. In Italia, soprattutto al Nord, è consuetudine prepararlo sotto forma di cotechino , insaccato nella cotica, la cotenna del maiale, cotta, accompagnato da un buon ‘letto’ di abbondanti lenticchie .\n3. Uva: dodici chicci, dodici desideri\nUva\nUna tradizione affascinante è quella di mangiare dodici acini d’uva a mezzanotte. Ogni chicco rappresenta un desiderio per ogni mese dell’anno. Questo rituale, originario dalla Spagna e introdotto in Italia nel XIX secolo e poi divenuto una pratica diffusa, è diventato popolare in molte famiglie italiane, aggiungendo un tocco di dolcezza e speranza al nuovo anno.\nLeggi anche: Martini, i cocktail caldi delle feste: tre ricette per brindare con e senza alcol\n4. Melograno, fertilità e ricchezza\nI chicchi di melograno sono considerati simboli di fertilità\nIl rosso melograno è associato alla fertilità e all’abbondanza secondo le più antiche credenze. Mangiarlo al cenone del 31 dicembre è un augurio per un anno ricco di opportunità e successi. Il succo di melograno o i chicchi aggiunti alle insalate portano freschezza e prosperità ad ogni tavola imbandita per il Capodanno.\n5. Pesce, per una pesca della fortuna\nPesce, un alimento considerato segno di abbondanza sulla tavola di Capodanno\nIl pesce , alla pari del maiale nell’entroterra, è simbolo di abbondanza e prosperità per un’ Italia peninsulare ricca di sbocchi sul mare . Il frutto del pescato, da cui dipende la vita di molte genti, non può dunque mancare al Cenone. Si portano in tavola pesce spada, branzino ma anche altre prelibatezze che oggi è sempre più facile trovare in pescheria o nei banconi specializzati dei supermercati.\n6. Verdure a foglia verde, il colore della fortuna\nCavolo verde\nLe verdure a foglia verde, come cavolo e spinaci , sono spesso associate alla fortuna e al denaro . Aggiungerle ai piatti del Capodanno è un modo per avere un contorno sano, fatto di superfood , i cibi stagionali della salute , e augurarsi un anno di benessere anche economico. Il verde, secondo la tradizione del Feng Shui , indica l’equilibrio tra momenti di riposo, lavoro e benessere quotidiano.\n7. Riso, granelli di prosperità\nI granelli di riso sono nutrienti e indice di un raccolto prosperoso\nIl riso è un altro elemento simbolico di prosperità, grazie ai suoi granelli. Inoltre è un piatto versatile, che si presta ad essere preparato in svariate ricette, come primo, anche col pesce, ma sempre più anche come contorno. La sua associazione con la fortuna si basa sulla sua natura ricca di carboidrati , che lo rende un alimento prezioso, e sulla diffusione delle risaie in molte parti del mondo tra cui l’Italia.\n8. Mandarini, auspicio di lunga vita\nMandarino\nI mandarini , sono simbolo di fortuna in alcune tradizioni cinesi : la forma tonda è simbolo di eternità e di buon auspicio per una lunga vita. E si sa: gli agrumi fanno molto bene alla salute. Dunque perché non portarli a tavola a Capodanno, col loro colore, profumo e sapore leggermente agrodolce?\n8. Frutta secca a volontà, un buon destino\nFrutta secca\nLa frutta secca è da sempre considerata un simbolo di abbondanza e fortuna, e durante il Capodanno italiano è tradizione mettere in tavola un mix di frutta secca da sgranocchiare, magari in attesa del countdown di mezzanotte , con lo spumante. Ma mandorle, noci, nocciole, pistacchi, pinoli, uvette , sono anche spesso ingredienti principali (come il croccante di mandorle , appunto) o che rendono gustoso un dolce o dei biscotti tradizionali festivi, abbinati, perché no, al cioccolato. Mentre datteri, prugne e fichi secchi vengono di frequente gustati a sé.\n10. Pandoro e panettone: che fortuna!\nPanettone con uvette e canditi, dolce tipico italiano delle feste\nSulle tavole italiane, ovunque si festeggi, in casa o fuori, non possono mancare, come dolci, una fetta di panettone o di pandoro . In fondo si tratta di prelibatezze tipiche della festosa tradizione italiana natalizia e di Capodanno : dunque, anche se non vantano particolari auspici, perché farsi scappare la fortunata occasione di gustarli, sorseggiando lo spumante con le bollicine?\nTags: capodanno , cenone",
