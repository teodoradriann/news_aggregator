    "text": "El prodigio francés Victor Wembanyama se perderá el resto de la temporada 2024-2025 de la NBA debido a una trombosis venosa profunda en el hombro derecho, anunció este jueves su equipo, San Antonio Spurs.\nWembanyama, de 21 años, principal figura del equipo texano, fue diagnosticado con la dolencia, que puso fin a la carrera del histórico Chris Bosh (dos veces ganador de la NBA con el Heat) después de su participación en el Juego de las Estrellas de la NBA el fin de semana.\n\"Brindaremos actualizaciones (sobre su estado de salud) cuando sea apropiado\", añade el comunicado publicado en redes sociales por los Spurs.\nEn la 2024-2025, su segunda temporada en la NBA, 'Wemby' ha disputado 46 partidos con promedio de 24,3 puntos, 11 rebotes y 3,7 asistencias por encuentro.\nSu último partido de la presente temporada fue la derrota 116-113 de los Spurs ante los Boston Celtics el 12 de febrero, en el que Wembanyama anotó 17 puntos y 13 rebotes.\nEl francés, ganador de la medalla de plata en los Juegos Olímpicos de París-2024, fue nombrado Novato del Año de la NBA la pasada temporada.\n'Wemby', para muchos considerado el \"futuro de la NBA\", participó por primera vez en el Juego de las Estrellas el fin de semana pasado.\nUn reporte de la cadena ESPN indica que la expectativa de los Spurs es que pueda estar en condiciones de regresar a la competencia para la próxima campaña de la NBA.\n— San Antonio Spurs (@spurs)[February 20, 2025]\n\"Perdemos parte importante\": Chris Paul\n\"Sabemos que perdemos parte importante de nuestro equipo\", dijo Chris Paul. \"Fuera de su talento, su carisma y lo que brinda al vestuario es lo que más vamos a entrañar\".\n\"Entendemos que tenemos un trabajo por hacer pero nos preocupamos por nuestra gente\", agregó el base; la Federación Francesa de Basquetbol dijo estar al tanto de la situación y en contacto con el cuerpo médico de los Spurs\n\"Sé cuánto ama jugar y lo difícil que será estar fuera por mucho tiempo\", expresó Boris Diaw, quien se coronó campeón de la NBA con los Spurs y ahora es director general del seleccionado francés.\nA la ausencia de Wembanyama en los Spurs se suma la de su entrenador, Gregg Popovich, quien sufrió un derrame cerebral el 2 de noviembre del 2024 y desde entonces se mantiene en recuperación.\nCon la llegada de De'Aaron Fox previo en el mercado de pases invernal, los Spurs completaron un trío junto al experimentado Chris Paul y Wembanyama con el que tenían la esperanza de clasificar a los playoffs.\nActualmente, los Spurs marchan en el puesto doce de la Conferencia Oeste con una diferencia de cuatro juegos con respecto al último cupo de clasificación a la postemporada.",

    "text": "More monster waves will collide with the California coast after injuring onlookers and causing serious flooding\nCNN, KCAL, KCBS\nBy Elizabeth Wolfe, Robert Shackelford, Mary Gilbert and Cindy Von Quednow, CNN\n(CNN) — A series of powerful storms in the Pacific Ocean are\ndriving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and posing a significant risk to people and structures along the coast.\nMonstrous, 20-foot-plus waves on Thursday crashed over seawalls and swept away and injured several people, forced rescues and sent a damaging surge of water through coastal California streets.\nA brief dip in wave heights may occur in some locations along the California coast during the daytime Friday as one storm pushes ashore, but the danger will quickly ramp back up later Friday and Saturday as another system develops behind it.\n“Overall, this is expected to be an exceptional high-surf and coastal flooding event that has not occurred in many years,” the weather service in Los Angeles warned.\nSea levels have risen along most of the California coastline over the past century, NOAA data shows, as global temperature climbs and melts glaciers and ice sheets. Higher sea levels are making coastal flooding events worse and will continue to do so in the future.\nWaves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen- to 20-foot waves are expected along the central and Southern California coasts through Saturday evening.\nThe first round of dangerous waves hit alongside high tide Thursday morning. Several people were injured by a huge wave that slammed into Ventura Beach.\nThe wave crashed over a barrier along the Southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away.\nNearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said.\nHigh water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the US-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said.\nThe dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said.\nThe dangerous wave risk will lessen on Saturday for Northern California, but continue in southern Oregon and rival Thursday’s impact in Southern California. The Ventura County coast, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches face the most extreme surf and are at risk for significant coastal flooding.\nOne of the storms helping to drive the waves will also bring rain and wind to California through Saturday. High wind alerts are in effect for California’s central coast and the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected. These strong wind gusts will churn up waters even further.\nThe spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby.\n“Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned.\nAt least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard Thursday and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said.\nThe conditions caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities Thursday and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast.\nCrews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about 7 feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities.\nHoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution.\nIn central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office\nissued an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, which included areas of Rio Del Mar, where seawater filled beachside roadways and pushed against some homes, CNN affiliate KION reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day.\nMassive waves attract surfers to Mavericks\nDespite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco.\nPro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having\nsome of the biggest waves in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported.\nLocal resident Ion Banner\ntold the affiliate that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said.\n“The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.”\nMavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells.\nThe legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen.\nOn Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco.\n“If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.”\nCNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "How Berliners are fighting to preserve their vast utopian park | The Star",
    "text": "First-time visitors to the vast open area in the middle of Berlin often need a minute to take it all in.Stretching out before their eyes is a disused airfield that was constructed by the Nazis in the German capital's Tempelhof district long ago. After the former airport was shut down in 2008, the site was converted into the city's largest public park.\nWhere once planes took off, skaters and cyclists now speed along the two runways. Due to its vastness, Tempelholfer Feld (Tempelhofer Field) as the locals call it, is a popular spot for flying kites. Designated areas for barbecuing, which is prohibited on balconies and in many parks in Berlin, are crowded with families and groups of friends, especially on the weekends.\nTempelhofer Feld, which covers a total area of 300ha, is also a popular spot to watch the sunset and is home to an urban gardening collective, a beer garden and a theatre.\nThe only downside – the park gates are closed every day at sundown and visitors are shooed away by security guards once dusk has settled in.\nIn a city like Berlin, where rent and property prices have seen a massive surge over the last decade, a utopian space like this is bound to be contested.\nSome 10 years ago, Berliners were asked to decide on the future of the area in a referendum. Some 64% voted in favour of a law preserving Tempelhofer Feld as a place of recreation. That also ruled out development in favour of housing.\nOpponents of the law argued at the time that it would be irresponsible not to develop such a vast space in a city where finding an affordable flat is becoming more and more impossible.\nA man doing a hand stand on a repurposed runway at Tempelholfer Feld.\nSupporters of preserving Tempelhofer Feld in its original state pointed to other areas that they said should be developed first. Plus, they said, there was no guarantee the city government would build affordable social housing, fearing luxury apartments would sprout up instead.\nA decade later, rent prices in Berlin have gone up even further and more and more people are calling for flats to be built on at least parts of the site.\nBerlin's new state government, a coalition of the conservative Christian Democrats and the central-left Social Democrats, is looking to explore possibilities for \"careful peripheral development in limited parts of the area\", according to its coalition agreement.\nActivists from the 100% Tempelhofer Feld citizens' initiative, which spearheaded the 2014 referendum, are alarmed at the prospect.\n\"It's never been as serious as it is now,\" Mareike Witt from the initiative said.\n\"The Tempelhofer Feld Act is practically the only law in force that was written directly by the people of Berlin,\" she says. The government plans to reconsider how the site is used in an attempt to torpedo the democratic process and undermine the law step by step, the activist believes.\nThe state parliament recently passed an amendment which allows the temporary expansion of an existing container village housing refugees next to the former airport terminal building.\nSkaters and cyclists now speed along the two runways of Tempelholfer Feld.\nAccording to the activists, expanding the accommodation is only a pretext for more far-reaching measures.\nTo prevent the development of the site, Witt and her fellow campaigners are currently gathering signatures for a petition to have Tempelhofer Feld added to the Unesco World Heritage List.\n\"An average of 200,000 visitors come to the park every week,\" Witt notes. On a Sunday with pleasant weather, visitors can sometimes reach up to 80,000, she adds.\n\"Tempelhofer Feld is becoming increasingly popular and has blossomed into a Berlin landmark.\"\nThe site's recreational value cannot be overestimated, Witt says.\nMeanwhile, there is still enough available wasteland in Berlin to build the approximately 200,000 flats Berlin needs to combat its housing shortage by 2040, according to official estimates, the activist says.\nGermany's Federation for the Environment and Nature Conservation (Bund) takes a similar view while pointing to the site's crucial role in the fight against climate change and nature protection.\nTemperatures on Tempelhofer Feld drop to lower levels overnight than in the densely developed neighbourhoods surrounding it, Tilmann Heuser, managing director at Bund, says, a phenomenon that you will experience even cycling past the site at night.\nTempelhofer Feld allows for the formation of cold air flows which are immensely important for the climate of cities in times of global warming, allowing them to cool down again overnight, the expert says.\nThe vast area, which Heuser says is \"atypical\" for a metropolis the size of Berlin, is also home to several species, including the skylark.\nHeuser says when it comes to plans to partially develop the site, an overall concept is missing.\nPrevious studies by urban planners, for example, have shown that residential development does not make sense on any of the site's edges due to existing infrastructure and conservation considerations.\nThe area is framed by its large former terminal building, which regularly hosts events and has long been designated as a monument to be preserved, Heuser says.\nBerlin's minister for housing, Christian Gaebler, on the other hand, argues that \"Tempelhofer Feld is one of the few areas in Berlin that is owned by the state and therefore offers an opportunity to build affordable housing for the common good of all sections of the population\".\nGaebler advocates a mixed development of the area that includes both housing and social infrastructure as well as leisure and recreational areas.\nLegally, the city parliament could simply amend the Tempelhofer Feld Act passed by the referendum to pave the way for the site's development.\nPolitically, such a step could be seen as a disregard for the democratic vote, which could be fatal for the two governing parties, especially at a time when the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has been making huge gains amid discontent with the establishment.\nInstead, the city government has initiated a process criticised by the citizens' initiative and Bund as \"sham-citizen participation\".\nInitially, up to 275 people will be selected at random from 20,000 Berliners to take part in so-called dialogue workshops on the future of Tempelhofer Feld. They are to work out a blueprint for the future development of the site – without any predetermined ideas.\nThe results will later be used for a call for an international competition to present ideas for the use of the area.\nOnly then will politicians decide on potential housing on the site, though that is likely to come after the current term. – dpa\nOpen Modal × $(document).ready(function(){ var freeBoxShow = false; $(window).scroll(function() { var scrollPercent = 100 * $(window).scrollTop() / ($(document).height() - $(window).height()); window.setTimeout(function () { //scroll to page length 35% then show the pop-up if (scrollPercent >= 35 && !freeBoxShow) { freeBoxShow = true; $('#freeHTMLBoxBtn').click(); } }, 500); }); var freeModal = document.getElementById(\"freeModal\"); $(\"#freeHTMLBoxBtn\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"block\"; //$('body').addClass('free-modal-open'); }); $(\".free-close\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"none\"; //$('body').removeClass('free-modal-open'); }); var freeBox = '",

Salt Lake City’s Mayor, Erin Mendenhall, believes e-bikes offer a multitude of benefits beyond environmental advantages. They can be a more affordable transportation option, especially as gas prices soar, and can provide a healthy and enjoyable way to get around for people with varying physical abilities. The Pilot Program This initial program is a pilot, funded with $200,000 from the city’s 2024 budget. Salt Lake City residents can apply online for a chance to win a rebate voucher worth $300 to $1,300. The specific amount depends on the applicant’s income and the type of e-bike they choose. Cargo and utility e-bikes are eligible for higher rebates due to their higher cost. Winners can redeem their vouchers at five participating bike shops within Salt Lake City. Looking to the Future The city is committed to improving cycling infrastructure in anticipation of a potential surge in e-bike ridership. Mendenhall highlighted the city’s ongoing efforts to build new bike lanes and improve existing ones. The program’s future iterations will depend on its success in this first round. However, the initial enthusiasm suggests a bright future for e-bikes in Salt Lake City. Businesses like Rad Power Bikes are eager to participate and hope the program will be expanded in the coming year.",
