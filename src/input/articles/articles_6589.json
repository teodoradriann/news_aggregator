    "title": "Watch as kangaroo rescued by ‘legend’ surfer at Bawley beach",
    "text": "A surfer leapt into action, dragging a distressed kangaroo from pounding waves at a Bawley Point beach yesterday (15 January).\nBrendan Riddick was walking up the beach following a surf at about 1 pm when he spotted the kangaroo struggling to keep its head above water about 30 metres offshore at a popular swimming spot at Gannet Beach.\nStill wearing his wetsuit and with his surfboard in tow, he swam out to the roo and managed to pull it into the shallows before dragging it up the beach by its tail.\n“It looked like it was swimming OK in the calm rock pool area, but then it started drifting out into current and was getting taken out to the point. I thought, geez, if I don’t go in there, that poor thing is going to drown,” Brendan said.\n“I got to it and realised it was really tired and it wasn’t keeping its head above water. I was wary about it lashing out with its claws, so I started pushing from behind.\n“There was one moment there when we both got hit by a shore dumper and I fell onto it, which is when I realised there was not much movement coming from it.\n“When I got to where I could stand I just dragged it in by the tail. I thought it was going to die because it had taken in so much salt water.”\nBrendan, who said he was allergic to and therefore fearful of many animals, was joined by other beachgoers who watched the weary roo foaming at the mouth before calling WIRES for help.\n“After about 10 minutes it lifted its head, then around 10 minutes later, it stood up,” he said.\n“Then it took off into the bush.”\nThe incredible rescue was filmed by Canberra’s Natalie Cannon, who was on holiday with family members when they saw the kangaroo come out of the bush and jump off the rocks into the ocean.\nShe believes the animal was being chased.\n“We were sitting on the rocks at the southern end of Gannet Beach watching my husband catch a few waves surfing when the roo bounded from behind us, clearly spooked. Unsure, but I think it might have been bolting from a dog. It was definitely fleeing and frantic with panic,” Natalie said.\n“It jumped directly into the high tide rock pool and was washed against the rocks then out into the open swell.\n“It ended up 30 metres from the beach and 20 metres out from the rocks. And was smashed against the rocks by a wave. It was a big swell with powerful sets of waves knocking it around.\n“It looked like it was swimming well until it was hit by multiple waves. It started struggling to keep its head above the water; that’s when Brendan took action.\n“Without a doubt it would have drowned without Brendan’s assistance. It was an epic rescue.”\nWhile kangaroos are often spotted sunbaking and swimming at South Coast beaches and waterways, Brendan, who lives at Bawley Point, said it was the first time he had seen one out in the waves.\nWIRES member and local resident Zora Brown later located the kangaroo in the bush near the beach and said it “ran off super fast, which was an excellent sign it is OK”.\nBrendan has been hailed a “hero” and a “legend” by onlookers who watched the scene unfold and, after Natalie posted her video on the Bawley Point Facebook page, local residents have been quick to congratulate the Ulladulla High School teacher on the amazing roo rescue.\n“Not all heroes wear capes; some don a wetsuit,” Natalie said.\nOriginal Article published by Katrina Condie on\nAbout Regional.",

    "text": "Oracle Corp. is cutting jobs in its closely watched cloud unit, the latest company taking steps to control costs amid heavy spending on AI infrastructure. Impacted workers were told this week that their roles were eliminated, according to people familiar with the matter.\nSome of the reductions were related to performance issues, and the unit continues to hire, two of the people said. An Oracle spokesperson didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.\nThe full scope of reductions couldn’t be determined. The cuts were first reported by DatacenterDynamics, an industry news publication.\nMany tech giants have sought to deal with the surging costs of AI by reducing expenses in other parts of the business. Microsoft Corp. has cut some 15,000 roles this year. Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have also axed jobs.\nOracle’s stock is near an all-time high on momentum in its cloud unit. Last month it inked an unprecedented deal with OpenAI for about 4.5 gigawatts of data center power in the US. Still, the company is on the hook for tens of billions of dollars to build out increasingly large server farms to meet demand. Its free cash flow was negative in the fiscal year that ended in May.\nIn a June filing, Oracle said that it periodically makes changes to its workforce due to strategy changes, reorganizations or performance issues. “These types of restructurings have resulted, and may in the future result, in increased restructuring costs and temporarily reduced productivity while employees adjust to the restructuring.” NDTV Profit",

    "text": "By Ethan Holesha ,\n1 hours ago\nCHICAGO, Ill. (WCIA) — Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s Office has issued cease and desist letters to five med spas in the Chicagoland area for misleading marketing of weight loss medications.\nRaoul is warning Illinois residents seeking to purchase GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound to be aware that many sellers advertising these name brand medications are instead offering unapproved versions of these products that might put people’s health at risk.\nNew IL pay stub requirement will begin in 2025 He is strongly urging people to obtain prescriptions for weight loss medications from a trusted health care provider and to fill those prescriptions at an appropriately licensed pharmacy.\nRaoul is warning consumers of misleading advertising by med spas, wellness centers, online retailers and social media sellers that states or implies they are offering name brand GLP-1 medications or generic versions of name brand medications, when in reality they are offering compounded drugs.\nThese compounded drugs are not the same as generic drugs because they are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as they are often produced on site and by prescription for individual patients who aren’t able to take a drug in its FDA-approved form.\nHowever, when a drug is in short supply, the FDA allows certain larger pharmacies to use the active ingredient in that drug to produce compounded versions of the drug in order to meet the public demand. The FDA doesn’t review compounded drugs for safety, quality or effectiveness, however, and these drugs may pose health risks.\n“Millions of Americans are looking for help losing weight, and for reasons ranging from the costs to the availability of prescription drugs, they are looking for alternate means of buying what can be lifesaving medications,” Raoul said.\nAccording to Raoul, unscrupulous sellers are also making misleading health claims and promoting GLP-1 products in formulations that haven’t been evaluated by regulatory agencies or tested in humans at all, such as drops, skin patches and nasal sprays.\nIL community colleges join forces to feed needy during holidays The FDA has issued warnings to try to stop the distribution of illegal versions of weight loss products. Some GLP-1 medications are being sold directly to consumers without prescriptions or are research-only products that should never be used by humans.\nThe office said before purchasing products advertised as GLP-1 medications, consider the following questions. If the answer to any of them is yes, avoid purchasing the medication to protect yourself from serious health consequences that may be associated with compounded or fake products. Raoul is urging consumers to ask:\nDoes the seller offer GLP-1 medications without a prescription or without the supervision of a licensed health care provider? Does the seller offer research-grade, research-only or GLP-1 medications for research purposes? Are consumers encouraged to reconstitute GLP-1 medications, break apart Mounjaro and Zepbound pens or vials to use as separate doses, or to water down doses? Is the GLP-1 medication mixed with other medications or chemicals? Is the GLP-1 medication offered as drops, sprays, skin patches or in under-the-tongue form? Is the seller promoting GLP-1 medication to consumers under the age of 18? Is the GLP-1 medication sold without disclosing the potential side effects or safety risks? Is the compounding pharmacy, med spa, wellness center or online retailer making claims about the GLP-1 medication’s safety and efficacy? Is the seller offering to sell more than three months of GLP-1 medications at once? Is the GLP-1 medication being sold or shipped from another country? Is the GLP-1 medication sold by an individual person, including by someone on social media? Are consumers being encouraged to lie to obtain the GLP-1 medication, including by misrepresenting their weight or BMI? Raoul is urging consumers considering taking a GLP-1 medication for weight loss to first consult a trusted physician and fill any prescriptions at state-licensed pharmacies. To find out whether a medication shortage exists before taking that drug, check the FDA’s drug shortage database .\nFirearm deer season harvests 82,000 deer across Illinois, up from last year Knowing whether a medication shortage exists can be a sign that the drug you are contemplating is potentially being compounded. Ask questions about what exactly is being offered, including active and other ingredients.\nConsumers should avoid obtaining or filling prescriptions from unknown sources. If filling prescriptions from an online pharmacy, visit the FDA’s online pharmacy information page for resources about safely obtaining prescription medicines online.\nRaoul encourages Illinois residents to report deceptive marketing or the sale of unsafe products on the Attorney General’s website or by calling one of the Attorney General’s Consumer Fraud Hotlines:\n800-386-5438 (Chicago) 800-243-0618 (Springfield) 800-243-0607 (Carbondale) 866-310-8398 (Spanish-language hotline) Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "title": "Surgen preocupaciones sobre el futuro de seis cautivos en Gaza tras el descubrimiento de lesiones de disparos por parte de las FDI.",
    "text": "Las preocupaciones se intensifican con respecto a la situación de seis cautivos en Gaza, después del descubrimiento de heridas de bala por las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel. El lamentable suceso ha generado preocupaciones de que más cautivos israelíes no puedan regresar con vida, según mencionó un manifestante. \"Necesitamos traer de vuelta a aquellos que sabemos que aún estaban vivos\", compartió Daniel con CNN. Él expresó que continuar el conflicto mientras las negociaciones para un alto el fuego y un intercambio de rehenes tropiezan solo llevará a más funerales, tanto para ellos como para nosotros, agregó, con 48 años de edad. No se ha proporcionado ninguna explicación formal sobre cómo fallecieron los seis cautivos. El IDF declaró el jueves que los exámenes iniciales indican que todos los seis cautivos habían sido disparados, pero la causa exacta de su fallecimiento aún no se ha determinado. También señaló que los hallazgos son provisionales. El IDF informó haber descubierto cuatro cuerpos adicionales cerca de los cuerpos de los seis cautivos, creyendo que eran milicianos de Hamas que los retenían. Sin embargo, no se encontraron signos de balas en sus cuerpos. El IDF no atribuyó la responsabilidad a nadie. Fuera del Ministerio de Defensa de Israel, Daniel destacó que el anuncio del IDF que sugiere que todos los seis cautivos fueron disparados subraya los riesgos involucrados en las operaciones de rescate con fuerza. El martes, el medio israelí Ynet informó que las primeras evaluaciones sugerían que los cautivos podrían haber muerto por inhalación de dióxido de carbono, después de que el IDF atacara un objetivo de Hamas cercano. Durante una sesión informativa el martes, el portavoz del IDF, el almirante de la Marina Daniel Hagari, se negó a confirmar si los cautivos habían muerto debido a las acciones militares israelíes. En cambio, se refirió a una declaración que hizo en junio, stating that the hostages perished while IDF forces were operating in Khan Younis. Los lamentables incidentes reinstauraron los llamamientos a un alto el fuego entre los manifestantes en Tel Aviv el jueves. Omer, de 46 años, que asistió a la manifestación con sus dos hijas, creía que \"podrían haber sido rescatados mucho antes\". Acusó al gobierno israelí de retrasar el acuerdo con Hamas, lo que, advirtió, llevaría a un acuerdo más caro que podría haberse asegurado antes. Un alto el fuego también aliviaría a decenas de miles de palestinos en el enclave bloqueado mientras Israel continúa con su campaña militar. La ONU estimó en julio que aproximadamente 1,9 millones de personas en la franja habían sido desplazadas, lo que casi iguala la población total de Gaza. Sin embargo, hay dudas sobre la intención del primer ministro israelí Benjamin Netanyahu de llegar a un acuerdo debido a la feroz oposición de los ministros de derecha dentro de su coalición. El destino político de Netanyahu depende de sus socios de la coalición de derecha, con algunos ya amenazando con abandonar el gobierno si acepta el acuerdo, lo que podría llevar a su colapso. \"Quizás Hamas los capturó (a los rehenes), pero al que podemos culpar por su asesinato es a Benjamin Netanyahu\", afirmó Omer, agregando que el primer ministro es \"únicamente responsable\". Un grupo que representa a las familias de los rehenes israelíes, el Foro de Familias de Rehenes y Desaparecidos, criticó a las autoridades israelíes en un comunicado el jueves, afirmando que los resultados de las pruebas forenses que sugieren heridas de bala son \"pruebas adicionales de la crueldad de los terroristas\" que los mantuvieron cautivos. El Foro también reiteró su crítica a las autoridades israelíes, stating that the recovery of bodies was \"no achievement\". \"It is a testament to the complete failure to strike a deal in time, as six hostages who were expected to return alive instead returned in coffins\", said the Forum. Las autoridades israelíes identificaron los cuerpos recuperados como pertenecientes a Yoram Metzger, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder, Chaim Peri, Nadav Popplewell, and Yagev Buchshtab on Tuesday. Except for Munder, all the deceased had been previously declared dead by the Israeli military. Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that IDF and ISA had entered Hamas tunnels in a \"complicated operation\" to retrieve their remains. Munder was taken captive along with his wife, daughter, and grandson, who were later released during a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas in November. Munder's son, Roee, was killed during the attack. Nine-year-old Ohad Munder conveyed his feelings to Israel's public broadcast channel Kan 11, stating that the demise of his grandfather and the other captives \"shouldn't have happened\". \"There have been numerous opportunities for a deal... but then they say no, only to regret it at the last moment. All the hostages could have returned alive from the start. They could have brought back my grandfather and all the other hostages\", said Ohad. Currently, there are 109 Israeli captives still in Gaza, including 36 thought to be deceased, according to data from the Israeli Government Press Office. The world has expressed sympathy and concern over the tragic loss of the captives, with many calling for a peaceful resolution in the Middle East. Despite the conflicting reports about the cause of death, the discovery of gunshot wounds on some bodies has raised concerns about the role of Hamas militants and the Israeli military in this unfortunate incident.",

    "text": "This post was originally published on here\nNEED TO KNOW Pamela Anderson tells PEOPLE about the advice Priscilla Presley gave her before filming The Naked Gun remake Anderson plays the love interest of Liam Neeson’s Lt. Frank Drebin Jr. in the new film Presley played Jane Spencer, the love interest of Leslie Nielsen’s Frank Drebin, in the three original films Pamela Anderson is following in some famous footsteps.\nAnderson, 58, stars in this summer’s The Naked Gun remake alongside Liam Neeson . Neeson, 72, plays Lt. Frank Drebin Jr., the son of Leslie Nielsen’s Frank Drebin from the original The Naked Gun films. Anderson plays his love interest, Beth.\nIn the three original films — 1988’s The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! , 1991’s The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear and 1994’s Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult — Drebin’s love interest, Jane Spencer, was played by Priscilla Presley . Speaking with PEOPLE at The Naked Gun ’s UK premiere on July 22 at Cineworld Leicester Square, London, Anderson revealed that she was in touch with Presley, 80, before filming.\nPamela Anderson (left) and Liam Neeson in ‘The Naked Gun’.\nFrank Masi/Paramount Pictures\n“She reached out to me,” Anderson revealed, “And she said, ‘Have fun with it. Don’t be afraid to be silly.’ It’s good advice.”\nThough Presley was not considered a comic actress before she was cast in the films, she received great reviews for her work in the original Naked Gun films. The New York Times wrote of her performance in The Naked Gun 2½ , “Miss Presley is a winsome Juliet to [Nielsen’s] clumsy Romeo, a willing Ginger to his ardent Fred, a worldly Jane to his Tarzan.”\nAt the Tuesday night event, Anderson said she had “so much fun” working with Neeson on the new The Naked Gun . She said, “He’s so silly and goofy, and so am I, so we got along great on and off camera.” She teased that when fans see the movie, it will be “very clear” what her “favorite part” of it was.\nPriscilla Presley in ‘The Naked Gun’.\nMoviestore/Shutterstock\nBack in October, Neeson praised Anderson to PEOPLE , explaining, “With Pamela, first off, I’m madly in love with her. She’s just terrific to work with.”\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE’s free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n“I can’t compliment her enough, I’ll be honest with you,” he continued. “No huge ego. She just comes in to do the work. She’s funny and so easy to work with. She’s going to be terrific in the film.”\nRelated Stories This year, Anderson received Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for her starring role in The Last Showgirl . And though she had plenty of acting credits — including Baywatch and Scary Movie — the actress told PEOPLE , “I feel like I’ve just started my career now, so I’m just really excited to be such a part of this and to play a real character.” This summer, Anderson is also starring in the Tennessee Williams play Camino Real at the Williamstown Theatre Festival.\nThe Naked Gun hits theaters Friday, Aug. 1.",

    "text": "[Michigan Government](/topics/michigan-government) How Michigan pork spending rose tenfold to $1B under Whitmer (with GOP help) [](/) [Michigan Government](/topics/michigan-government) - Lawmakers have approved $2 billion in pet project grants in the past two years, far more than in the previous four years combined - Despite approving new transparency rules, lawmakers have still not disclosed which legislator backed each grants - Some of the grants have created controversies but lawmakers defend them as overdue investments When Michigan lawmakers went on a spending spree in the final days of a Republican administration in December 2018, newly elected [Gov. Gretchen Whitmer](https: government/gov-gretchen-whitmer-rips-michigan-republican-pork-deals-says-she-cant-block) was one of the loudest critics. Before relenting, she threatened to veto projects like $1 million for the Lowell Showboat, a floating event space run by a nonprofit in west Michigan that sponsors cruises and other events on the Flat River. “The current governor doesn’t like it, but we’ve (concluded) we need to live up to the letter of the law,” her budget director at the time, Kurt Weiss, told Bridge in February 2019. Related: [Michigan budget has $950M in no-bid pork projects, some transparency reforms](https: government/michigan-budget-has-950m-no-bid-pork-projects-some-transparency-reforms) [How Michigan Gov.

The [$113 million in grants](https: government/lawmakers-michigan-gov-snyder-swapped-pork-projects-votes-lame-duck) — handpicked by lawmakers, often late at night — approved in the final days of Republican Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration have grown nearly tenfold. In each of the past two years, lawmakers have taken a budget surplus swollen by billions in federal pandemic aid and carved up over $1 billion in for more than 200 pet projects, from parks and museums and pools to fire stations, housing developments and skilled trades centers. Republicans controlled the Legislature in all but one of the past six years. Democrats who took over last year changed rules they said would add transparency to a process that Whitmer and others have criticized as secretive. But last week was the deadline to announce sponsorships on 2023 grants, and the state has still not released any information about them, leaving residents in the dark about who championed what project. The next deadline: Sept. 30, over a year after the money was approved, when the state is [required to post updates on the grants](https://legislature.mi.gov/documents/2023-2024/publicact/pdf/2023-PA-0119.pdf#page=46) and how much money has been spent. “It’s not optimal transparency,” said Bob Schneider, a former director within the State Budget Office who served under both Snyder and Whitmer. He said Democrats’ [new disclosure requirements](https://legislature.mi.gov/documents/2023-2024/publicact/pdf/2023-PA-0119.pdf#page=46) are an improvement, but that’s a low bar. Asked by Bridge Michigan about the spending (which she approved), Whitmer’s spokesperson lauded her record and attacked Republicans. \"Gov. Whitmer is proud to have signed five balanced, bipartisan budgets that pay down billions in debt and invest in Michigan schools, roads, public safety, and economic development,” said Whitmer spokesperson Stacey LaRouche. “The fact is, this process was abused by the previous Republican Legislature, and the governor believes there is more we can do to bring greater transparency and accountability to the enhancement grant process. She looks forward to working with the new Legislature to get it done.\" GOP loves pork too Before Whitmer, no-bid pork projects picked by lawmakers were constrained by Michigan’s fiscal woes. Snyder faced a [billion-dollar deficit](https://www.michigan.gov/formergovernors/recent/snyder/press-releases/2011/05/26/balanced-and-early-wow) upon taking office in 2011 and was budget conscious for his eight years in office. “The reason Rick Snyder got elected in the first place was our budget was in a shambles,” said Republican Beau LaFave, a former state representative who ran for secretary of state in 2022. “We were in a financial disaster.” Snyder and the Legislature made sweeping changes, [rewriting the tax code](https://www.mlive.com/politics/2011/05/gov_rick_snyder_signs_michigan.html) and fixing the budget. In 2017, lawmakers approved nearly $39 million in grants. The next year, they grew to $113 million, led by Republicans like LaFave. A champion of tax cuts, LaFave said he was proud to secure $500,000 in 2018 for the [U.P. Military Museum](https://visitescanaba.com/things-to-see-and-do/member/up-military-museum) in Delta County. “That was some of the pork I brought home,” LaFave said. He said the facility, which contains military memorabilia from families across the region, also secured another $1 million in private donations. Often, lawmakers approve pots of money for competitive grants, with state administrators establishing criteria and accepting applications from municipalities, school districts, nonprofits and others. The decisions are then made by administrators who determine which applicants best fit the criteria. But with the one-time grants, lawmakers make the call. ‘They had all the power’ The state’s finances turned around amid the COVID-19 pandemic, bolstered by federal relief grants and an unexpected increase in tax revenues. In 2022, when Republicans still controlled the Legislature, the state spent $1 billion in one-time grants. That included [$2 million for the Traverse City Curling Club](https: government/michigan-pork-includes-another-15-million-ex-gop-chairs-company), which has 130 members, and larger ones, including another [ $15 million grant](https: government/michigan-pork-includes-another-15-million-ex-gop-chairs-company) to help develop the land owned by the company where Robert Schostak, the former state GOP chair is a director, and $40 million to develop a “greenway” around Detroit. The following year, Democrats took control of the Legislature for the first time in 40 years. Lawmakers approved another $1.3 billion in onetime pet projects, according to estimates from Schneider, the former budget official. “They had all the power to do with what they felt was in (Democrats’) best interest,” said former state Rep. Rodney Wakeman, a Saginaw area Republican. “It was being spent at historic levels.” Wakeman left office in 2023 just as Democrats were taking over. He said he wondered how they would allocate the money after so many years “in the desert.” But by the next summer, he said he had his answer. An estimated 90 percent of the money went [to projects in Democrats’ districts.](https://www.mlive.com/politics/2023/08/areas-represented-by-democrats-received-90-of-pork-projects-in-michigans-budget.html) Former Rep. David LaGrand, D-Grand Rapids, said the surge in spending is an investment in Michigan after years of neglect. “One person’s pork is another person’s virtuous need,” he said. LaGrand lauded the 2023 grants, like a $35 million one for two new fire stations near him, that help communities across the state. But he acknowledged that a “win” for Grand Rapids might mean less money for projects in another city that’s just as deserving, like Flint or Saginaw. “That’s the messiness of how we do politics in America,” he said. State Rep. Kristian Grant, D- Grand Rapids, said Democratic leaders solicited advice from representatives and senators early in the year to develop priorities to help communities in need. “We had a ton of requests pour in,” she said. “We were able to find some really awesome projects.” She said she secured a $35 million grant to build two new fire stations in her part of the city, where LaGrand is the former state representative, which she said had the slowest response times because of the proximity of existing stations. And she backed a [$6 million grant to renovate the Martin Luther King Lodge](https://www.grandrapidsmi.gov/Government/Programs-and-Initiatives/Improvements-to-Martin-Luther-King-Park-Lodge) into community space in Grand Rapids. Grant said she looked for projects to help young people and one that reduce violence. She also backed grants for the John Ball Zoo ($14 million) in Grand Rapids and a $5 million grant for the city’s children’s museum. ‘Voters have right to know’ Grant and LaFave, the former state representative, agree there should be more disclosure and more transparency. “I think that the voters have a right to know,” LaFave said. The money, after all, is taxpayer money, Grant said. “These belong to the people of Michigan. It’s always prudent to ask questions about what dollars are being used for,” Grant said. “It helps keep the system working as it should.” But that’s not how it has worked, at least so far. Lawmakers decide in private what to put on the big budget wish lists, [drafting vague spending descriptions](https: government/michigan-lawmakers-use-word-games-skirt-law-spend-billions-pet-projects). The better way, former state budget administrator Schneider said, would be to create pots of money and use competitive grants, with set guidelines and objective decisions. Should state dollars go to one community’s park because its playground equipment is worse than another applicant? Or does it go to the community with the more powerful lawmaker? “From a good budgeting perspective, that’s (competitive grants), the best way to do it,” he said. But he acknowledged that even state administrators could favor the powerful to ensure their own budgets are protected by key lawmakers. “(It’s) not perfect.” ",

    "text": "Diario PUBLICIDAD Juárez jueves, 06 junio 2024 | 15:39 PUBLICIDAD De las dos mil 196 que hubo en el municipio de Juárez, al menos 870 casillas de votación entre básicas, contiguas y especiales presentaron irregularidades tales como actas de escrutinio dentro del paquete electoral (y no afuera, como se indica en la capacitación), y diferencias en los conteos realizados entre funcionarios y representantes partidistas, de acuerdo con Luis Flores Santillán, representante del PAN en la Asamblea Estatal Electoral. Aquellas que no presentaron el acta de escrutinio en el interior del paquete fueron llevadas a mesas de reconteo supervisadas por consejeros y representantes de los distintos partidos. Al corte de esta edición el IEE no informó con precisión cuántas estuvieron en esta condición, aunque sólo en los primeros cinco paquetes abiertos, dos se fueron a dichas mesas. La sesión de la Asamblea para iniciar con el cómputo de los votos inició ayer a las 9:00 de la mañana, aunque se decretó un receso hasta las 9:45 que se extendió hasta las 10:10 horas en las instalaciones.
