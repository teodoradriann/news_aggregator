    "text": "The third time wasn’t the charm for [Texas Southern](https://www.texasfootball.com/team/texas-southern-tigers?ref=search) fans hoping for its next head football coach. The school’s Board of Regents met in a special meeting for the [third time in two weeks](https://www.texasfootball.com/article/2023/12/21/whats-going-on-at-texas-southern-and-is-there-a-solution?ref=article_preview_title), with one time repeatedly on the agenda, to approve the contract for a head coach. After three attempts, it appears the search for a new head coach is back to square one. Who could be a candidate at this point? A couple of names have emerged during the process, which will be discussed after catching up on the timeline of events. November 14 - Word leaks that some [players have been informed McKinney would not return](https://www.texasfootball.com/article/2023/11/21/five-potential-candidates-for-next-texas-southern-head-coach?ref=article_preview_img). TSU Vice President of Intercollegiate Athletics, Dr. Kevin Granger, [denied the report](https://defendernetwork.com/sports/college-sports/no-official-decision-on-texas-southern-coach-clarence-mckinney-until-season-ends/). November 20 - News is confirmed that [Clarence McKinney’s contract will not be renewed](https://www.texasfootball.com/article/2023/11/19/texas-southern-will-not-renew-clarence-mckinneys-contract?ref=article_preview_title). McKinney’s contract is set to expire on Dec. 15. This date will be mentioned again soon. November 28 - The [Houston Chronicle publishes a story](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/texas-sports-nation/jerome-solomon/article/andre-johnson-texas-southern-coaching-job-18519215.php) on why former Houston Texans wide receiver Andre Johnson would be the right fit for TSU. This story will come into play again later. December 7 - [Sources indicate TSU has narrowed its search to two candidates](https://www.texasfootball.com/article/2023/12/07/update-on-texas-southern-coaching-search?ref=article_preview_title), former Nebraska coach Mickey Joseph and former Colorado defensive backs coach Brett Maxie. Notably, our sources had stated the search was already a mess. December 13 - Sources confirmed [Texas Southern was set to name Fred McNair head coach](https://www.texasfootball.com/article/2023/12/15/texas-southern-to-name-fred-mcnair-head-coach?ref=article_preview_img) within the next two days. McNair spent the last eight seasons at SWAC rival Alcorn State. December 15 - A [virtual special meeting is called](https://meetings.boardbook.org/Public/Agenda/2066?meeting=614573) to “Request Approval to Appoint and Negotiate Employment Contract for Head Football Coach.” This was when the dysfunction began to show as the Board of Regents could not reach a quorum. December 19 - Another [virtual special meeting is called](https://meetings.boardbook.org/Public/Agenda/2066?meeting=614350) to seek approval to appoint and negotiate a contract with the head football coach. Again, no decision was reached. [HBCU Legends reports](https://www.si.com/college/hbcu/football/texas-southerns-head-coach-search-drama-2023) that two members either failed to attend or disagreed with the selection because some preferred Andre Johnson to be head coach. December 19 - [Alcorn State releases a statement](https://x.com/BRAVESSPORTS/status/1737172815835533678?s=20) mentioning an inability to reach an agreement on a new contract. The Braves quickly [promoted defensive coordinator Cedric Thomas to head coach](https://alcornsports.com/news/2023/12/19/general-cedric-thomas-named-head-football-coach-of-alcorn-state-university-braves.aspx). December 28 - TSU’s Board of Regents meet and again [defer on approving a head coach](https://x.com/HBCUSports/status/1740474665821446612?s=20). “The hiring of a head football coach is a strategic decision that cannot be taken lightly,” Dr. Granger said in a statement released. “I will be taking a few additional days to consider candidates for the coaching vacancy and will work closely with Interim President Dr. Mary Sias and the Board to announce a hiring decision shortly.” In other words, McNair will not be the head coach, and their coaching search is beginning anew. The question is whether they will work together to try and convince Andre Johnson to be head coach or restart the search from scratch. If they are seeking to make headlines, Johnson will be the choice. But I wonder whether that strategy will work. Johnson is not Deion Sanders. If the administration chooses to find someone with at least head coaching experience, if not extensive coaching experience, then who are the choices now? Sources have indicated former Tennessee State coach Rod Reed is an option. The Marshall, Texas native worked at Prairie View A&M and East Texas Baptist before spending 18 seasons at Tennessee State, including the final 11 years as head coach. Another possible name to watch is long-time NFL assistant coach Alvin Reynolds. The Indiana State alum spent time with the Denver Broncos, Baltimore Ravens, Carolina Panthers, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Atlanta Falcons before coaching at NCAA Division II Bentley for two seasons. Reynolds led Bentley to a 7-3 overall record in his only season as head coach in 2022. Remarkably, all three organizational bodies did not work together to find a head coach from the beginning. Although it was apparent teamwork needed to be included before three meetings were called for the same agenda item. However, Dr. Granger’s statement indicates this new search will be conducted differently. Texas Southern faithful hope the administration fixes the issues made public during the first search. This is an embarrassing episode in TSU history, and they’ve lost valuable time during this recruiting cycle and transfer window to improve the roster. It’s time for Texas Southern’s administration to mitigate the damage to its reputation over the last few weeks and work together to find a head coach.

    "text": "O senador Jorge Kajuru (PSB-GO) questionou nesta 5ª feira (6.jun.2024), em tom irônico, que “não pode dar bom dia para mulher que é assédio sexual” . Ao Poder360 , o congressista disse que não vai se retratar por ter dito, durante a audiência da CPI das Apostas com a presidente do Palmeiras, Leila Pereira, que “mulher vai ao estádio e pergunta quem é a bola” .\n“Isso é bom humor. Se eu não puder ter bom humor na vida hoje, é melhor levar um tiro na cabeça. Estamos em uma situação que você não pode dar um bom dia para uma mulher no elevador, que ela pode achar que é assédio sexual” , declarou o senador.\nFormulário de cadastro receba alertas grátis do Poder360 quero receber por e-mail concordo com os termos da LGPD . quero receber no WhatsApp Inscreva-se quero receber no Telegram Inscreva-se A declaração de Kajuru se deu no início da audiência com Leila Pereira. Foi dada a palavra à senadora Margareth Buzetti (PSD-MT), única congressista presente na comissão.\nLeila respondeu ao senador que “hoje tem presidente de clube mulher” .\nQuando questionado sobre a natureza pública de sua declaração, por ter sido feita no Congresso, Kajuru disse ser só uma “brincadeira” dirigida à colega senadora.\n“Não tem retratação nenhuma a fazer (…) porque eu me dirigi à senadora, minha amiga pessoal Margareth Buzetti. Ela sempre me fala que não sabe nada de futebol, mas que ela está encantada hoje de ver o amor dos netos dela para com o futebol” , afirmou o senador.\nJOHN TEXTOR Kajuru foi questionado pelo Poder360 se John Textor, dono da SAF (Sociedade Anônima do Futebol) do Botafogo, teria desmoralizado a CPI.\nO senador disse que o empresário norte-americano não apresentou provas de que o Palmeiras teria sido supostamente beneficiado no Campeonato Brasileiro. Textor tem feito inúmeras acusações de corrupção na arbitragem do torneio, envolvendo também outros times, como o São Paulo.\nKajuru disse que o empresário “não tem moral” e “nem brasileiro ele é. Se fosse honrado, já teria apresentado as provas. Fez uma bagunça, todos os dias diz algo que não pode provar. Ele tem que ser banido do futebol” .\nAs declarações de Kajuru vão ao encontro com as de Leila Pereira à CPI. A presidente do Palmeiras afirmou que Textor deveria ser “banido do futebol” .",

    "text": "Divisive Medicaid reform bill heads to the Idaho Senate\nBOISE, Idaho (KIFI) - A bill adding requirements to Medicaid expansion is now in the hands of the Senate after passing the House in a 38 to 32 vote Wednesday.\nHouse Bill 138 cleared the floor after nearly ninety minutes of debate.\nMedicaid expansion became law in 2018 with more than 60 percent of voters approving the measure.\nIntroduced by Rep. Jordan Redman, R-District 3, House Bill 138 would place 11 additional requirements or policy changes to Medicaid, a federal and state program that assists in covering medical costs for people with lower income and resources.\n\"House Bill 138, is a bill that restores integrity, financial responsibility, and self-sufficiency back into our Medicaid expansion program,\" Redman told members of the House.\nFor the full text and explanation of the bill, click HERE.\nCritics warn the bill could repeal Medicaid expansion\nIf the bill becomes law, voter-approved Medicaid expansion could be repealed if the additional requirements are not met.\nRepresentatives opposed to the bill have argued that the federal government is unlikely to implement all 11 waivers the bill requires.\n\"I have never seen so much faith placed in our federal government. If we have so much faith that they're going to approve these 11 waivers, I don't understand why we need the trigger. \" Rep. Dori Healey, Boise. \"...I understand that we need fiscal responsibility, and I think many of these waivers would provide that. [But] I've heard in this body so many times state sovereignty. But here we are just handing it back to our federal government.\"\nHealy argued that the bill was only a convenient way to shift the blame for Medicaid expansion repeal on the federal government, who she says are more than likely not going to approve the additional requirements.\nRepresentatives have also sponsored a separate bill looking to repeal Medicaid expansion directly. Healy argued supporting the alternative bill would be much more honest.\n\"If we wanted to run a repeal bill, there's a repeal bill in Health and Welfare right now that we could all vote on it,\" argued Redman. \"That's not the intention of this. The intention of this bill is to put accountability back into this program so that we can keep it for the folks who truly need it.\"\n\"This is a runaway budget\"\nThe proposed budget for 2026 calls for $1.36 billion for Idaho Medicaid expansion.\n\"That's almost $1 billion over the projection of what folks voted on when expansion passed,\" Redman told members of the House. \"Medicaid is eating up about 30% of our state budget currently. It's grown, significantly since the early 2000.\"\nRepresentative Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls and co-chair of the House's powerful budget-setting committee argued in favor of the bill. Horman told members of the House that voting \"yes\" was worth the risk because continuing in the current course leaves the state in a vulnerable position.\n\"This is a runaway budget,\" Horman told the House. \"It is not sustainable and nothing we have tried so far has worked. I'm willing to take the risk because I think the risk of not acting leaves us in a very vulnerable position to provide essential services to our state, including those most vulnerable who do need medical attention and have no capacity to obtain it for themselves.\"\nPsychologist and former health program manager, Rep. Marco Erickson, R-Idaho Falls, reminded members of the House how Medicaid has impacted the scope of his work and local health providers. He debated that the House needs to focus on the patient's Medicaid impacts first.\n\"We need to focus on patient outcomes first because the people who are consuming the product are your number one priority,\" Erickson told members of the House. \"These people on the ground in Idaho should always be our top priority, not our state budget.\"",

Tras una semana marcada por la llegada de los restos del huracán Kirk, que provocaron múltiples incidencias, precipitaciones y vientos, A Coruña y su área vivirán un fin de semana en el que poder disfrutar del aire libre. De esta forma, A Coruña amanecerá este sábado con cielos nublados, aunque sin precipitaciones que sí que serán probables más al sur de la Costa Ártabra. Las temperaturas experimentarán un moderado ascenso, con vientos que soplarán del sur-suroeste, moderados, con intervalos fuertes en la Costa da Morte. Precisamente estos vientos del sur serán los que hagan que suban las temperaturas, que aunque las mínimas serán las normales para esta época del año, las máximas sí que ascenderán moderamente. Las mínimas en A Coruña serán de 13ºC este sábado y las máximas llegarán hasta los 24ºC.

    "text": "Oggi l'Italia è interessata da uno sciopero generale indetto da Cgil e Uil, che coinvolge numerosi settori pubblici e privati, tra cui sanità, scuola, giustizia, commercio, ministeri e vigili del fuoco. L'astensione dal lavoro è prevista per otto ore o per l'intero turno lavorativo. Tuttavia, per il trasporto pubblico locale, aereo e marittimo, la durata dello sciopero è stata ridotta a quattro ore, dalle 9:00 alle 13:00, a seguito di una precettazione del Ministero delle Infrastrutture e dei Trasporti. Il trasporto ferroviario è escluso dalla mobilitazione, garantendo la regolare circolazione dei treni. Il ministro Matteo Salvini ha dichiarato: \"Lo sciopero è un diritto sacrosanto, come sacrosanto è il diritto alla salute e alla mobilità\". La Commissione di garanzia ha richiesto la limitazione dello sciopero a quattro ore; di fronte al rifiuto dei sindacati, il ministro ha esercitato il suo diritto e dovere con la precettazione. Il Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale ha respinto un ricorso d'urgenza presentato da alcuni sindacati contro la precettazione, decisione accolta con soddisfazione dal ministro Salvini. Cgil e Uil, in una nota congiunta, hanno precisato che il ricorso rigettato non è quello da loro presentato. La protesta è rivolta contro la manovra di bilancio, ritenuta inadeguata a risolvere i problemi del Paese. I sindacati chiedono l'aumento del potere d'acquisto di salari e pensioni, oltre al finanziamento di sanità, istruzione, servizi pubblici e politiche industriali. Sono previste manifestazioni, comizi e cortei in tutta Italia. Il segretario generale della Cgil, Maurizio Landini, parteciperà a Bologna, mentre il segretario generale della Uil, Pierpaolo Bombardieri, sarà a Napoli. A Roma, un corteo partirà alle 9:30 da piazza Indipendenza per raggiungere piazza Barberini. A Milano sono previsti due cortei nel centro cittadino: Cgil e Uil si ritroveranno alle 9:30 in largo 11 Settembre, con arrivo in piazza San Babila per il comizio finale. Parallelamente, sindacati di base, movimenti sociali, collettivi studenteschi e comitati per il diritto all'abitare, all'istruzione e alla sanità pubblica si incontreranno alle 9:30 in piazza Fontana, dove deporranno una corona in ricordo di Licia e Pino Pinelli e realizzeranno un murale per riaffermare la lotta per la giustizia sociale; il corteo proseguirà fino a piazza della Scala. In Toscana è prevista una manifestazione regionale a Firenze, con partenza del corteo alle 9:30 da piazza Santa Maria Novella e interventi conclusivi in piazza Poggi. Per quanto riguarda il trasporto aereo, lo sciopero dalle 10:00 alle 14:00 coinvolge il personale di diverse compagnie, tra cui Sea Aeroporti di Milano Linate e Malpensa, Aviapartner Handling a Linate e Malpensa, e Wizz Air Malta Limited. I passeggeri sono invitati a verificare lo stato dei propri voli con le rispettive compagnie aeree. Nel trasporto pubblico locale, le modalità dello sciopero variano da città a città; a Roma, Atac ha comunicato che il servizio sarà garantito fino alle 8:59 e dalle 13:00 in poi, mentre a Milano, Atm prevede possibili disagi dalle 9:00 alle 13:00. Per il trasporto marittimo, i collegamenti da e verso le isole maggiori potrebbero subire variazioni; si consiglia di consultare gli operatori per informazioni aggiornate. Sciopero generale del 29 novembre: trasporti, scuola e sanità a rischio, treni garantiti - Domani, venerdì 29 novembre 2024, l'Italia sarà interessata da uno sciopero generale proclamato da Cgil e Uil, coinvolgendo numerosi settori pubblici e privati. La mobilitazione, indetta per protestare contro la manovra economica del governo, mira a tutelare il potere d'acquisto e a sollecitare il rinnovo dei contratti. Sciopero Generale del 29 Novembre: Cgil e Uil Confermano lo Stop di 8 Ore nei Trasporti - Cgil e Uil hanno confermato lo sciopero generale di 8 ore previsto per venerdì 29 novembre, estendendo la mobilitazione anche ai settori del trasporto pubblico locale (Tpl) e del trasporto aereo. L'unica eccezione riguarda il trasporto ferroviario, escluso dallo sciopero a causa di un precedente sciopero avvenuto domenica 24 novembre, in conformità con la normativa che prevede un intervallo di dieci giorni tra scioperi nel medesimo settore. Sciopero Nazionale dei Treni: Disagi Previsti per il Weekend del 23 e 24 Novembre 2024 - A partire dalle ore 21:00 di sabato 23 novembre 2024 e fino alle 20:59 di domenica 24 novembre 2024, è stato proclamato uno sciopero nazionale del personale del Gruppo FS Italiane, inclusi Trenitalia, Trenord e Trenitalia Tper. L'agitazione sindacale, indetta da alcune sigle sindacali autonome, potrebbe causare significativi disagi alla circolazione ferroviaria, con possibili cancellazioni totali e parziali dei treni, comprese le Frecce, gli Intercity e i treni regionali.",
