    "title": "Sindicatos celebran aumento del salario mínimo, y lanzan fuerte pulla a los empresarios",
    "text": "La ministra del Trabajo, Gloria Inés Ramírez, anunció que el salario mínimo tendrá un incremento del 12 % para el año 2024, lo que implica que los trabajadores recibirán $ 140.000 adicionales, pasando de ganar $ 1.160.000 a devengar ahora $ 1.300.000.En cuanto al auxilio de transporte, destinado a cubrir este gasto mensual, ahora se fijará en $ 162.000, lo que eleva el total que un trabajador recibirá en 2024 a $ 1.462.000 .Luego del anuncio de la jefa de la cartera del Trabajo, habló el presidente de la República, Gustavo Petro, quien les envió un mensaje a los empresarios y les propuso plantear una nueva reforma tributaria, para “elevar la actividad productiva”.Al respecto, la Central Unitaria de Trabajadores (CUT) celebró la cifra de incremento salarial para 2024, anunciada por el presidente de la República, lo que contribuirá al mejoramiento del poder adquisitivo de los trabajadores colombianos.“No es lo que estábamos pensando, pero es positivo, porque recupera en algo el poder adquisitivo; sin embargo, registramos de forma negativa la actitud del empresariado, que no quiere reconocer el esfuerzo de los trabajadores en cuanto a sus salarios y los ingresos de los trabajadores, (y) desafortunadamente se mantuvieron en posiciones supremamente bajas”, aseguró Fabio Arias, presidente de la CUT.Así mismo, la CUT recoge los anuncios del presidente en cuanto a exigir la baja en las tasas de interés al Banco de la República; buscar el mecanismo para reducir las tarifas de los servicios públicos, especialmente la energía eléctrica; revisar los impuestos para las energías limpias y el turismo, y hacer revisión de la reforma tributaria, pero especialmente buscar un contexto económico y hacia el futuro que mejore la productividad y la situación del aparato productivo nacional.La CUT acompañará la mesa nacional de acuerdo para la productividad propuesta por el Gobierno nacional, que se trabajará en mesas informales de concertación, a través de sus propuestas y debates, para el mejoramiento de las condiciones de vida de los trabajadores colombianos.Fenalco también se pronunció sobre el salario mínimoComo un error para la reactivación de la economía calificó Jaime Alberto Cabal, presidente de Fenalco, la decisión unilateral del Gobierno nacional en el sentido de aumentar el salario mínimo por decreto en un 12 %.“ Es un aumento exagerado teniendo en cuenta la productividad negativa y la inflación esperada del 9,4 %. El incremento generará más informalidad y le impedirá al Banco de la República continuar bajando las tasas de interés, por los efectos inflacionarios que una decisión de esta magnitud traerá”, afirmó el vocero de los comerciantes.El sector del comercio será el primero en resentirse. De hecho, así lo han demostrado las cifras negativas registradas durante todo 2023.“El comercio es un sector, por regla general, formalizado y el que más empleos con salario mínimo genera en el país, situación que lo hace más vulnerable frente al tipo de decisiones como la tomada hoy respecto del salario mínimo”. Hemos advertido, a partir de un estudio del Banco de la República, que cada aumento porcentual del salario mínimo, por encima de la inflación y de la productividad –en el caso del año pasado, negativa–, implica la pérdida de cerca de 72.000 empleos.“También es evidente que el aumento del salario mínimo implicará mayores costos para el Gobierno. Por cada punto porcentual de aumento, por encima de la inflación, se calcula que los costos correspondientes a nómina en el sector oficial aumentarán en 800.000 millones de pesos. Estos recursos provienen de los impuestos que pagamos todos los colombianos”, concluyó Cabal Sanclemente.",

    "text": "Technology is stronger when Black women and girls are included\nOPINION: If we are going to be serious about increasing representation in tech then we have to take a more proactive approach to making tech a field where girls of color can see themselves represented.\nEditor’s note: The following article is an op-ed, and the views expressed are the author’s own. Read more\nopinions on theGrio.\nThere was nothing that I was a part of or experienced as a little girl that told me I could have a career in tech.\nI had supportive parents who exposed me to a range of activities. I did well in school – I was especially good at math and joined the math club and competed in math competitions on top of being a cheerleader, dancer, and athlete. But everything I learned about technology, I learned from just exploring on my own. Like many girls of my generation, my first foray into coding and technology was via designing the perfect Myspace page.\nWhen I saw myself in the future, I saw a successful dancer. Even though I was really intelligent, I didn’t care about being smart; I wanted to be seen as a cool, fun person. And it wasn’t until my dad realized I was serious about majoring in dance in college that he intervened and began to help me explore career paths that built on my academic strengths — and gave him the peace of mind of career stability. No one in my family had ever been a computer engineer, but my dad suggested I look into the field because I was good at math and science and, more importantly, because he saw it as a more viable career path than a professional dancer.\nI can look back now and see that there was something inside that would move me in the direction of tech, engineering or problem-solving, but I also realized we have a lot more work to do to get girls of color interested in tech fields.\nIf we are going to be serious about increasing representation in tech — and we should be, not just because it is the right thing to do, but because technology works better when its programming considers a diverse set of perspectives and experiences — then we have to take a more proactive approach to inclusion and making tech a field where girls of color can see themselves and their experiences represented.\nWhen we think about tech, it matters that you can create technologies for consumers that can be consumed by all of us. Having a diverse group of engineers working on the product also ensures that the programs that you release are created ethically and are accessible to everyone. Remember when filters first came out on Snapchat and Instagram, and they didn’t recognize dark faces? That’s a prime example of how diversity in engineering matters; those developers had not even considered the need for test cases that included darker-skinned people in the initial stages of development. It was eventually corrected but was an embarrassing omission that would have been corrected naturally if they’d just had darker-skinned engineers involved from the beginning.\nA good developer team understands the importance of having as many informed inputs and data points as possible and going through a broad testing phase during research and development. But it is still the case that people bring their own experiences, perspectives, world outlooks, and even biases into the code they write.\nLarge companies have made efforts to diversify their workforces, only for us to witness a large exodus of those same individuals years later. This signifies that it’s not enough to simply recruit more people of color and more women into the field; there needs to be a cultural shift within tech to support those individuals. When I was actively working as an engineer, it didn’t matter what project I was on, what city I was in, who the project was for what the work was, I was always the only Black girl. I never had a female manager, and I was overwhelmed by this feeling that my job only served the purpose of making money, and it didn’t matter what microaggressions I or other women – especially Black women or other women of color – faced, the bottom line was the bottom line.\nTechnology\nI once left a job, and my all-male team took me to a strip club after dinner as my going away party. This event was indicative of every experience I’d had, and every reason I was leaving the field — the idea that I was supposed to be thankful for this awkward, extremely uncomfortable strip club surprise with my male colleagues who all looked the same, were all members of their own boys network, and either didn’t notice or didn’t care how completely inappropriate and uncomfortable this outing was for the supposed guest of honor.\nWhen I founded\nHYPE, my primary goal was to introduce more girls of color to tech and build the supportive community around them that I wished I had. As a very sociable, outgoing engineer, the social component was just as important to me as the career development piece. It was also important to me that we built in an international experience for girls who had gone through our program, to expose them to worlds beyond their own community while encouraging them to make an impact by teaching other girls around the world. There is so much growth that comes from stepping outside of yourself and learning about other cultures, and I wanted that experience for other Black and brown girls.\nToday, I am very proud of the work we are doing, but I still see a need for a seismic shift in the tech industry overall. There is more visibility into the shortcomings of tech and the workforce, and I am encouraged that these conversations are at least being had today. People are trying to understand more about what they can do within the culture of their workforce to make it a more inclusive space that is more proactive about fostering a sense of belonging and community.\nWe see ourselves represented more in the big picture — in movies. When “Hidden Figures” came out, that was such a huge moment for Black girls and Black women in tech. I had never seen anything like that growing up, and I would love to see more of that for our girls who are growing up today.\nBut the industry also has to continue to put our money where our mouth is. When it’s no longer sexy or the popular thing to do to invest in Black women, people stop doing it, and we’ve seen that recently. We had this moment after George Floyd where it seemed the whole country felt very hopeful about where the future was moving, but now things have shifted back. And that is concerning. Not only are people being silent about what’s right, but they are proactively attacking Black women and any attempt to right-size what we have endured for so long.\nI never felt like I could speak up about the things I was experiencing, so we need to foster more courageous conversations about race and representation in tech and make a demonstrated investment in what we say we want to do. One of the things I never saw was women in leadership; if there were people who looked like me in the places where I worked, they were skilled laborers, never managers. There must be an intentional effort to identify and put into place opportunities for those women, especially women of color, who may be entry-level or middle-management to be intentionally placed on a path where they can see senior-level leadership in their future. We have to fund professional development opportunities and support organizations on the ground that are working to build the talent pipeline.\nBut beyond all of that, we have to care and we have to understand that while many people view technology as supplanting the human element of the workforce, it is actually powered by the human element. We have to get back to caring about people on a human level and understanding that our work product is stronger and we are stronger when women and girls of color are included.\nKristina Newton is the founder and CEO of HYPE, a nonprofit that empowers historically underrepresented girls with technology skills and prepares them to become future leaders in tech careers.

    "title": "Moose For The Masses: Remembering \"Moostletoe\"",
    "text": "Once upon a time, Christmas shoppers — including many in the Kirkwood and Webster Groves areas — would line up to buy a cuddly critter with soft antlers, a festive scarf and a stocking cap.\nIt was a moose for the masses.\n“Other stores offered teddy bears for their Christmas promotions. We wanted something different to set us apart,” said Lonnie Tapia, former point-of-sale marketing manager for the now-defunct St. Louis-based discount retailer, Venture Stores.\nTapia and his team created the dapper “Moostletoe” and his friends, “Holly” and “Snowball,” to sell in Venture Stores all over the Midwest — including the one at South Lindbergh Boulevard and Interstate 44 in Kirkwood, and the onemon Laclede Station Road in Maplewood.\nThe cuddly critters were ticketed for $19.99 each, but people who spent more than $30 got them for $10.\nPhotos and TV commercials shot in New York with elaborate winter backdrops helped make “Moostletoe” and “Holly” household names in cities where Venture had a strong presence, especially St. Louis, Chicago and Kansas City.\nVenture was founded in 1970 as a division of the St. Louis-based May Department Stores Company, which owned Famous-Barr and Lord & Taylor, among numerous other traditional department stores across the country.\nWith “Save with Style” as its slogan, Venture appealed to shoppers who were image conscious, but budget minded.\n“We tried to upgrade ourselves, rather than being simply price-point-driven,” said Tapia. “Everything we did was with that in mind. You’re always looking for that ‘Ooooooh moment,’ and ‘Moostletoe’ turned out to be a big part of that.”\nArtists, designers, copywriters and other members of Venture’s collaborative creative team had a hand in developing the legend of “Moostletoe,” “Holly” and “Snowball.”\n“We created this wonderful fantasy winter wonderland for ‘Moostletoe’ and his friends,” Tapia recalled.\nCreative & Versatile\nTapia was born in and grew up in and out of Columbia, Missouri. Out of a tumultuous childhood, he discovered his talent for creating art and set about mastering the fundamentals of painting, sculpture and graphic design, along with a healthy dose of salesmanship.\nHe has produced hundreds of artwork in various forms and styles.\nHe’s a widely-recognized pioneer in the realm of Instinctivism, a mode of artistic expression that involves laying down and connecting lines and shapes drawn from memory and the artist’s imagination.\nWhen Tapia was a young husband and father looking for work, a friend encouraged him to apply for an opening in Venture’s creative department in 1986.\n“They needed someone who does a lot of different things,” Tapia said.\nHis third interview with the company was with Ann Armbruster, senior vice president in charge of marketing. She closed his portfolio after looking through half of it and offered him a job.\n“I was thinking I was only going to get some freelance work,” he recalled. “I said, ‘I don’t know much about retail.’ She told me, ‘We can show you all of that. We need someone who’s creative and versatile.’”\nThe ‘Ooooh’ Factor\nTapia remembers the day the first “Moostletoe” plush toys arrived at the company’s headquarters.\n“They threw them out on one of conference tables,” he said.\nArmbruster was the first to grab one and hug it.\n“The concept of a moose was different,” Tapia said. “Everyone could see it was going to go over really well.”\nThe creative team took the concept into overdrive.\nLife-size “Moostletoe” and “Holly” costumes that were made for TV commercials were sent to several Venture locations for employees to wear for in-store promotions and local Christmas parades.\nTapia created festive air-brush illustrations of the moose brigade to be painted on decorative popcorn containers.\n“That was the first time they had four-color processing on popcorn tins,” he said. “They were going to order 10,000 of them, and I said, ‘You’re gonna need a lot more than that!’”\nThe company increased the order, “and they still sold out right away,” he added.\nTapia worked with company copywriters to create an illustrated storybook to attach to each “Moostletoe” character, along with packaging and coloring books for the “Moose Meals” that were served at Christmas time at the snack bars located in Venture Stores.\n“I’d go back into work in the middle of the night and was staying until 2 or 3 in the morning,” he said. “I’d work on things like backdrops and photography that would be difficult to do during the day, because you get a ton of distractions.”\nTapia enjoyed learning about retail while helping members of the 18-person creative team focus on their individual passions.\n“Teaching each of them the perks they wanted to learn and exposing them to techniques, marketing, advertising and photography — we all had a lot of fun,” he said.\nAll of this fueled Tapia’s zest for teaching and mentoring, which he would pursue full force later in his career.\nBack then, he would visit Venture locations throughout the St. Louis area, incognito, observing customers and trying to figure out their motivations.\n“You appeal primarily to women,” he said. “Then as now, they are the primary purchasers out there. So, when you’re creating something for children, you think about how it will resonate with children and their moms.\n“Again, that’s where the ‘Ooooh factor’ comes in,” he said. “That’s the effect we tried to get when we shot those commercials in New York, with the kids hugging ‘Moostletoe’ and ‘Holly.’”\nVenture’s moose promotion was originally slated to last for two years, but the company kept “Moostletoe” and “Holly” at the top of its Christmas list for several years beyond that.\nFor many who lived within Venture’s sphere of influence at that time, the characters became icons of Christmas time and childhood, well past when the company went out of business in 1998.\nVenture provided valuable experience for Tapia, who wound up doing similar work for larger retailers in New York.\n“I got to dabble in a lot of areas, which made it a good trying ground for me,” he said.\nNostalgia Trip\nTapia interviewed a few years later for a job with the creative team at Brooks Brothers in New York.\n“When I started showing the ‘Moostletoe’ drawings, all the people in the interview recognized him,” Tapia recalled. “They said, ‘I know this! I know this!’ They had purchased him for their nieces and nephews.”\nTapia thrived for a while in NewYork, securing a comfortable lifestyle for himself and his young family. But he came to realize that all of this was taking a toll on his soul.\nIn 1995, Tapia and his wife decided to move their family back to Missouri, where he started his own business, TapiaConcepts.\nIn 2013, he accepted the role of an art teacher at the recently established Fr. Tolton Regional Catholic High School in Columbia, where he continues to teach.\nPinned to the art room wall there is a photo of one of Tapia’s colleagues, Tolton Catholic music teacher Brian Parks, seated next to a brand new “Moostletoe” toy.\nThe child in the picture is no bigger than the moose.\n“I look at that picture all the time and show it to my students,” said Tapia. “It puts a smile on my face. It puts things into perspective. Mr. Parks and I have had this hidden connection since he was little.”\nTapia also keeps the original “Moose Meal” prototype box in his art room, along with a vintage “Moostletoe” and “Holly.”\nHe said they’re just a few emblems of his life’s mission to help his students vanquish fear of failure and embrace their innate creativity.\nA visitor recently asked Tapia why he had a “Moostletoe” and “Holly” in his classroom.\n“I created them,” he answered.\nThe visitor, who had worked at Venture and sold hundreds of the popular stuffed animals, was astounded.\n“We probably passed each other and said hello to each other in the store all those years ago,” said Tapia. “That’s just the way the world is. You never know who you’re going to run into.”\nJay Nies, a former staff member of the Webster-Kirkwood Times, is now editor of The Catholic Missourian in Jefferson City. He previously worked in customer service at a Venture store for eight years.",

    "title": "¿Por qué Brasil descartó la pasta dental Colgate Total Clean Mint para el uso humano? #2Jul",
    "text": "La pasta dental Colgate Total Clean Mint ha sido objeto de controversia tras ser clasificada como «no apta para el uso humano» en ciertas regiones. La Dra. Mercedes Flores , odontólogo de la Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV) , magister en medicina estomatológica y profesora de farmacología y terapéutica en la UCV , explicó que esta línea de pasta dental contiene elevadas concentraciones de aceites esenciales que son reconocidos por su potencial alergénico.\nLea también: Colegio de Odontólogos de Lara: Sin estudio científico, no se puede determinar si una crema dental es apta o no para usarla\nAunque el fluoruro de estaño es un componente común en diversas pastas dentales y ha estado en el mercado por más de 50 años, la Dra. Flores señaló en una entrevista para Unión Radio que la diferencia con la línea Clean Mint radica en una mayor concentración de esta sustancia, así como en un incremento en los niveles de saborizantes a base de aceites esenciales, aditivos y colorantes. Estos últimos, según la especialista, podrían ser los responsables de las reacciones alérgicas observadas en algunos usuarios.\nCasos reportados en Brasil y Colombia La alerta sobre la Colgate Total Clean Mint no es un caso aislado. En la nota difundida, la doctora Flores detalló que en Brasil, aproximadamente 1200 personas presentaron síntomas como úlceras bucales, inflamación e irritaciones diversas. Esta situación, indicó la especialista, llevó a la Ag encia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria (Anvisa) de Brasil a determinar que la línea dental debía ser retirada del mercado. Indicó que adicionalmente, se han reportado casos similares de reacciones adversas en Colombia .\nEn la entrevista para el programa Shirley Radio, Flores aclaró que hasta el momento no existen pruebas científicas concluyentes que avalen que el producto es nocivo para todos los usuarios. « Faltan estudios «, enfatizó.\nRecomendación de la especialista A pesar de la ausencia de estudios científicos definitivos, Flores sugirió que el uso de la pasta dental Colgate Total Clean Mint sea descartado como medida preventiva. « Si ya hay un preaviso, se debería tomar cartas en el asunto «, afirmó.\nResaltó que, mientras algunas personas no han presentado manifestaciones, otras sí. La especialista compartió que en su propio consultorio ya ha atendido a dos pacientes con irritación e inflamación de la mucosa bucal, lo que refuerza la necesidad de precaución.",
