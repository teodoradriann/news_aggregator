    "text": "Man killed in deputy-involved shooting at Elizabeth City hospital identified\nELIZABETH CITY, N.C. (WITN) - The man killed in a deputy-involved shooting Tuesday morning in Elizabeth City has been identified.\nThe Pasquotank County Sheriff’s the suspect has been identified as 51-year-old Michael Clarke.\nDeputies say they and Elizabeth City police officers were called to the Sentara Albemarle Medical Center emergency room around 1:15 Tuesday morning after getting reports of a man armed with a gun.\nThe State Bureau of Investigation says he was a patient at the hospital.\nLaw enforcement found the man holding a gun in the ER triage room when they got to the hospital.\nAccording to deputies, Clarke pointed the gun at law enforcement, who then exchanged gunfire with the suspect.\nThe Elizabeth City man was hit by gunfire.\nOfficials say it took 15 to 20 seconds for deputies to enter the hospital, confront the armed suspect and fatally shoot him. It’s something they say was quick but unfortunate.\n“While it was great no officer, deputy, or hospital official was injured, loss of life is never something that we want,” Pasquotank County Sheriff Tommy Wooten said.\nClarke received medical attention immediately, but he was pronounced dead at the scene.\n“We are a safe place to give and receive care, and I’d like to say this incident is unusual in our community and in our nation, but it’s not,” said Teresa Watson, hospital president. “This is just one of many unfortunate shootings that take place and as a hospital we really struggle to provide a welcoming, calm environment.”\nDeputies say before they got there, the suspect entered the ER and pointed the gun at multiple ER personnel.\nAn unarmed security guard with Sentara tried to stop the suspect while waiting for authorities to arrive.\nAccording to deputies, the security guard, who’s a Navy veteran and former New York City police officer, was injured after Clarke assaulted them, causing the guard to need surgery. Watson is hailing him as a hero.\n“It could have been a much worse outcome,” Watson said.\nNo members of law enforcement were hurt.\nThe hospital said that even though a nurse was held hostage by the man, that nurse elected to stay at the hospital and finish her shift after the shooting.\n“And this is a hospital, right? Where you come for respite, for care, for reassurance,” said Watson. “And we’re yet met with the violence that takes place by having a gun pulled on you and being held hostage, if you will.”\nWatson said in the next few weeks, the medical center will install a weapons detection system to stop something like this from happening again.\n“I would love not to have a weapon detection system in a place that you’re offering care but that’s just not the world we live in,” Watson said.\nSheriff Wooten said the three deputies who shot Clarke are currently on administrative leave with pay pending investigation.\nThe SBI is investigating the deputy-involved shooting.\nCopyright 2025 WITN.

    "text": "Family\nA study has been following 'gifted' kids for 45 years. Here's what we've learned.\nSome of what we used to think about gifted kids turned out to be wrong.\nWhat can we learn from letting seventh graders take the SAT?\nIn the 1960s, psychologist Julian Stanley realized that if you took the best-testing seventh graders from around the country and gave them standard college entry exams, those kids would score, on average, about as well as the typical college-bound high school senior.\nHowever, the seventh graders who scored as well or better than high schoolers, Stanley found, had off-the-charts aptitude in quantitative, logical, and spatial reasoning.\nIn other words, they were gifted.\nIn the 1970s, Stanley and his team launched a\nfull-scale study, identifying many of America's gifted kids and tracking them throughout their lives.\nThe study, called the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth never ended and is now nearly 45 years in the making. It has followed countless kids from middle school into their careers as some of America's top politicians, scientists, CEOs, engineers, and military leaders.\nStanley passed away in the mid-2000s, but psychologist David Lubinski helped bring the study to Vanderbilt University in the 1990s, where he now co-directs it with Camilla P. Benhow.\nIt's not a stretch to call this the biggest and most in-depth study on intellectual \"precociousness.\" The results of the study thus far are equal parts fascinating and genuinely surprising — a deeply insightful look into the minds and lives of brilliant children.\n1. Some of what we used to think about gifted kids turned out to be wrong.\nEver heard the saying \"early to ripe, early to rot\"? It basically means doing \"too much\" to foster a kid's special talents and abilities at too young an age could actually cause harm in the long term.\nThat's not even remotely true, at least not according to Lubinski.\nThat might be an outdated example. But Lubinksi says there are plenty of other misconceptions still alive today, like the idea that gifted kids are so smart that they'll \"find a way\" to excel even if those smarts aren't nurtured and developed.\nNot so fast. \"They're kids,\" he explains. \"They need guidance. We all need guidance.\"\n2. Intelligence is not the same as passion.\nQuick, what's the \"smartest\" career you can think of. Doctor? Scientist?\nWhile you do have to be pretty brilliant to work in medicine or science, those are far from the only career paths gifted kids choose later in life.\n\"Quantitatively, gifted people vary widely in their passions,\" Lubinski says. Many of the students in the study did end up pursuing medicine, but others went into fields like economics or engineering. Others still were more gifted in areas like logical or verbal reasoning, making them excellent lawyers and writers.\n\"There are all kinds of ways to express intellectual talent,\" Lubinski explains.\nWhen it comes to doing what's best for a gifted student, it's just as important for parents and educators to know what the student is passionate about rather than pigeonholing them in traditionally \"smart\" fields and registering them in a bunch of STEM courses.\n3. Hard work definitely still matters.\nMeasuring a student's aptitude, their natural abilities, is only one part of the equation when it comes to determining how successful they'll be in life. Aptitude scores can identify a particularly strong natural skill set but tell us very little about how hard that person might work to excel in that field.\nEffort, Lubinski says, is a critical factor in determining how far someone's going to go in life. \"If you look at exceptional performers in politics, science, music, and literature, they're working many, many hours,\" he says.\n(And for the record, there are a lot more important things in life than just career achievement, like family, friends, and overall happiness.)\n4. Regardless of aptitude, every kid deserves to be treated as though they were gifted.\nThe study's focus is specifically on kids within a certain range of intellectual ability, but Lubinski is careful to note that many of its findings can and should be applied to all students.\nFor example, the kids in the study who were given an opportunity to take more challenging courses that aligned with their skills and interests ultimately went on to accomplish more than the students who were not afforded the same opportunity.\n\"You have to find out where your child's development is, how fast they learn, what are their strengths and relative weaknesses and tailor the curriculum accordingly,\" Lubinski says. \"It's what you would want for all kids.\"\nIt may sound a bit like a pipe dream, but it's a great starting point for how we should be thinking about the future of education in America.\nIf you'd like to learn more about the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth, check out this short film on the project created by Vanderbilt University:\nQuick Learners; High Achievers: Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth\nThis article originally appeared on 09.22.17",

This program will allow people to hear from many city departments firsthand about what they do.\nSome areas include the Pittsfield Fire and Police departments, the Department of Public Service and Utilities, the City Council and School Committee, and an overview of municipal government.\n“They get to learn about all the aspects of the city, I think that there’s really no department left unturned within the city,\" Pittsfield Mayor Peter Marchetti said. \"Some get a deeper dive than others based on the amount of work that a department does.”\nThe sessions are once a week for two hours and the deadline for the applications is Friday, July 26. You must be 18 years or older and live or work in Pittsfield.\nYou can get more information on their website and the application can be found here . Paper copies can also be found at the mayor's office and turned in there.",
