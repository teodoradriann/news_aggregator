    "text": "El presidente Petro respondió al expresidente Duque, quien propuso una “gran alianza nacional” y una consulta para definir un candidato único para enfrentar al petrismo en 2026. El presidente de Colombia, Gustavo Petro, y el expresidente Iván Duque / Foto: Presidencia y EFE. El presidente Gustavo Petro respondió al expresidente Iván Duque, quien propuso este jueves, desde Cartagena, que se conforme una coalición de varios sectores, “una gran fuerza ciudadana amplia, que no esté anclada en ideologismos, sino que tenga como premisa fundamental la protección de nuestra democracia”. El exmandatario lanzó la propuesta desde el Congreso de Asobancaria, en referencia al llamado que también ha hecho el expresidente y jefe del Partido Liberal, César Gaviria, para conformar una coalición para defender la Constitución de 1991. (Lea: “‘Yo no voy a pedirle al Consejo de Seguridad que avale una constituyente’: Petro”) “Yo creo que lo que se requiere hoy es que todos aquellos que quieren ser presidente en el 2026 salgan ya de una vez a la palestra y que se empiece a concertar la posibilidad de que Colombia tenga una gran alianza nacional republicana donde, a través de un mecanismo de consulta, pueda darse la unificación de quien puede representar una verdadera alternativa”, fue la idea que lanzó Duque. Al respecto, el presidente Gustavo Petro se manifestó y le respondió directamente a Duque a través de su cuenta de Twitter: “Están asustados”, fueron sus palabras frente a la “gran alianza nacional” que sugirió Duque y quien habló de una propuesta que sea viable para el 2026. De otro lado, Duque expresó este jueves que el gobierno Petro estaría detrás de una estrategia para “tomarse la Corte Constitucional”. “Si eso llega a ocurrir y no tenemos ahí personas que salvaguarden la Carta del 91, sino que sean estafetas del Gobierno, nuestra democracia y nuestra institucionalidad están en crisis”, afirmó. 👁‍🗨 Conozca cómo votan los senadores y representantes a la Cámara en ‘Congreso a la mano’. 👉 Lea más sobre el Congreso, el gobierno Petro y otras noticias del mundo político. ✉️ Si tiene interés en los temas políticos o información que considere oportuno compartirnos, por favor, escríbanos a cualquiera de estos correos: hvalero@elespectador.com; aosorio@elespectador.com; dortega@elespectador.com; dcristancho@elespectador.com; lduarte@elespectador.com; o lperalta@elespectador.com.",

    "text": "[ASAP Rocky](https://www.nme.com/artists/asap-rocky) has starred in a new advert for his partner [Rihanna](https://www.nme.com/artists/rihanna)’s new lip balm product – check out the clip below. - READ MORE: [Rihanna: every album ranked and rated](https://www.nme.com/features/rihanna-every-album-ranked-and-rated-2921163) The rapper appears in the promotional video for the Fenty Skin product Lux Balm, which the post describes as “juicy, Barbados Cherry-powered lip balm packed with vitamin E and shea butter”. The footage included in the Instagram post is clipped from the video for Rocky’s 2023 single ‘ [Riot (Rowdy Pipe’n)](https://www.nme.com/news/music/asap-rocky-reignites-wedding-rumours-after-calling-rihanna-his-wife-on-latest-single-riot-roddy-pipen-3471049)’. Rocky directly references the lip balm in the lyrics to ‘Riot (Rowdy Pipe’n)’. “Nah bitch, this ain’t lip gloss / Lux Balm up in my palm / New collab with my baby mom,” he raps. It later transpired that the song shared its name with Rihanna and Rocky’s second son, Riot Rose Mayers. The song, which was produced by [Pharrell Williams](https://www.nme.com/artists/pharrell-williams), is set to be included on his upcoming fourth studio album ‘Don’t Be Dumb’, which still does not have a release date. In January 2023, [Rocky said that the album was “finished”](https://www.nme.com/news/music/aap-rocky-releases-new-single-same-problems-says-fourth-album-is-finished-listen-3383510) when he shared his single ‘Same Problems?’. Rocky’s last studio album was 2018’s ‘ [Testing](https://www.nme.com/news/music/asap-rocky-drops-new-album-testing-featuring-frank-ocean-skepta-lauryn-hill-2324944)’, which included the singles ‘ASAP Forever’ and ‘Praise the Lord (Da Shine)’. [Reports emerged last August that Rihanna and Rocky had welcomed their second child together](https://www.nme.com/news/music/rihanna-and-aap-rocky-reportedly-welcome-second-child-together-3486394). It was later confirmed that Riot had been born on August 1. [Rihanna had previously announced she was expecting another baby during her Super Bowl Halftime Show performance](https://www.nme.com/news/music/fans-speculate-rihanna-pregnant-again-super-bowl-halftime-show-3397165) in Glendale, Arizona back in February. Also last year, [Wu-Tang Clan](https://www.nme.com/artists/wu-tang-clan) rapper [RZA](https://www.nme.com/artists/rza) responded to [Rihanna and ASAP Rocky naming their firstborn after him](https://www.nme.com/news/music/rza-reacts-to-rihanna-and-aap-rocky-naming-their-baby-after-him-its-a-great-honour-3466335).

    "text": "Les Forces combattantes, avec l’appui des vecteurs aériens, ont décimé plusieurs terroristes ce jeudi, dans la forêt de Tia (Boucle du Mouhoun) et à Tialboanga (Est), a appris l’AIB auprès de sources sécuritaires. Grâce aux vols de reconnaissance, une base terroriste nichée dans la forêt de Tia, à 12 km de Bondoukuy (Mouhoun, Boucle du Mouhoun), a été découverte le jeudi 28 décembre 2023. Les pilotes ont repéré un nombre important de criminels se rassemblant sous un arbre touffu. Au moment opportun, les veilleurs du ciel ont envoyé des frappes ciblées sur les assaillants, qui ont brûlé avec leurs équipements. Les unités terrestres du 10e bataillon d’intervention rapide sont intervenues immédiatement pour encercler la forêt. Tous les rescapés ont été éliminés, et la base ainsi que toute la logistique ont été détruites. Outre la forêt de Tia, plusieurs terroristes ont été signalés dans la matinée du jeudi 28 décembre 2023 aux environs de Tialboanga, à 7 km de Sakoani dans la zone de Matiacoali (Gourma, Est). Pendant qu’ils prenaient le thé et discutaient certainement de leurs prochaines cibles, ces malfaiteurs ignoraient que c’était leur dernière réunion de planification. Un missile lâché depuis le ciel les a consumés avec leurs logistiques. Selon nos sources, les opérations de reconquête de l’intégrité territoriale se poursuivent.

    "text": "Niman Ranch has recognized the Hundling family of Breda, Iowa, as the 2024 Sustainable Farm of the Year.\nThis accolade honors the Hundlings for their land stewardship and ongoing commitment to the principles of regenerative agriculture.\nFor Brice and Melanie Hundling, sustainability isn’t just a buzzword. Their multi-species, biodiverse farm is a model of sustainable practices, from cover crops and rotational grazing to no-till crop farming and edible windbreaks that build soil health and provide sustenance for humans and wildlife alike. The Hundlings regularly experiment with new regenerative practices and share what they’ve learned with other farmers in the Niman Ranch farmer network and the broader agricultural community through field days and case studies.\nHundling Family Farm The Hundlings have been producing hogs for Niman Ranch since 2005 and began selling Angus cattle to Niman Ranch in 2019. The family appreciates the economic sustainability of knowing who will be buying their livestock and at what price. That security allows them to continue improving their land and soil by raising other livestock and poultry species, including goats, sheep, laying hens and broilers, turkeys, ducks, geese, peacocks and guinea fowl.\nThey also farm alfalfa, corn, soybeans and oats, which provide feed and bedding for the animals. They seed rye for cover crops each year, of which they harvest some for seed and straw; the rest is grazed by their ruminants. It’s all one system of grazing livestock in rotation with the crops that keeps the soil fertile, the animals healthy, the water clean, the ecosystem thriving and the farm successful.\n[ RELATED: 2022 Sustainable Farm Of The Year Recognized By Niman Ranch ]\nThe farm is currently part of a pilot program with Nofence , the first virtual fencing system for multispecies livestock operations. The technology allows for the rotational grazing of goats, sheep and cattle on cover crops with reduced costs for labor and fencing.\nThe Hundlings also live as sustainably as possible, feeding their family of five kids from the farm with their garden, dairy cows, eggs, fruit trees and meats. They are raising their children to appreciate the importance of stewardship of the land and humane treatment of the animals they raise, and they hope that one or more of them will someday want to continue their work on the farm.\n“We congratulate the Hundling family for this well-deserved award,” said Chris Oliviero, Niman Ranch’s general manager. “Their commitment to diversity on the farm, integrating livestock on the land and combining traditional and innovative practices to build resilience are notable. We’re proud to have the Hundlings a part of the Niman Ranch farmer network.”",

    "title": "Fairstead, Will Blodgett Both Declare Win in Ongoing Legal Fight",
    "text": "Affordable housing giant Fairstead and partner-turned-competitor Will Blodgett have been locked in a messy divorce for over three years. Who won arbitration? It depends on who you ask.\nAn April 2 decision says affordable housing giant Fairstead “substantially prevailed,” and agreed with claims that the firm’s former co-founder Blodgett plotted to take over the company before he was fired and launched competitor Tredway. But after the decision, Blodgett expects to walk away with tens of millions of dollars.\nBlodgett’s legal team sees the decision, along with an earlier one out of a Delaware court, as a decisive win related to his claim that Fairstead is wrongfully denying him a portion of the firm’s profits.\nFairstead, however, argues that a court in Delaware will make that determination — and that the arbitration decision is a resounding victory for the company. The arbiter, after all, agreed that Blodgett misused the company’s proprietary information and enlisted other employees in a plan to take control of the company.\nOne point of agreement: The fight between Blodgett and Fairstead is far from over.\nFairstead, which was founded in 2013 by Jefrey Goldberg, Stuart Feldman and Blodgett, now has $7.8 billion in assets and projects in the pipeline and more than 25,000 housing units across 28 states. As the company rapidly grew over the years, Blodgett and other employees grew increasingly frustrated that they couldn’t share directly in the company’s success through equity stakes.\nMost of Blodgett’s compensation consisted of carried interest, or a portion of the profits from the company’s special-purpose property ownership subsidiaries. Frustration over the compensation schema led to discussions about restructuring the company, which the arbitrator characterized as Blodgett’s attempts to take control of the firm.\nBy September 2021, Blodgett was terminated, and Fairstead indicated that his interest in the subsidiaries would be canceled. Blodgett filed a lawsuit in response, alleging that Fairstead wrongfully deprived him of tens of millions of dollars in profits after he left and started a new firm, Tredway. In a countersuit, Fairstead accused Blodgett of a conspiracy to drive out the other two leaders at Fairstead and downloading a trove of the company’s documents with the intent to take control of Fairstead or form his own firm.\nThe company cited these activities as its reasons for firing Blodgett and depriving him of carried interest.\nThe April 2 decision shot down Blodgett’s argument that he was fired from Fairstead in September 2021 without reason. Arbitrator Kathleen Roberts found that, in his quest to control Fairstead or create a spinoff firm, Blodgett violated the firm’s confidentiality terms and his fiduciary duties as an employee. She pointed to the fact that Blodgett forwarded internal Fairstead documents to the family offices of his in-laws, the Tisch and Sussman families, “for the purposes of aiding his takeover plans, or if that failed, his new venture efforts.”\nRoberts described Blodgett as “determined if not obsessed” with taking control of Fairstead, minimizing the role of Feldman and Goldberg or alternatively, forming a separate entity funded by “the family offices of his billionaire in-laws.”\nThe decision also, however, stated that “Blodgett is entitled to a declaration… that the Employment Agreement does not entitle any Respondent to cancel Blodgett’s entire interests.” Instead, his violation of the employment agreement means he must “forfeit his interests in pending transactions.”\nA February decision out of a Delaware court found that provisions of operating agreements governing the special-purpose property ownership subsidiaries “[do] not provide an affirmative termination or forfeiture right” related to Blodgett’s interests.\n“The core issue in this case is straightforward: Did Fairstead have the right to take Mr. Blodgett’s equity? The legal system has answered with a resounding no,” Jacob Buchdal, an attorney for Blodgett, said in a statement. “Mr. Blodgett won, as both the Arbitrator and the Delaware Chancery Court have ruled in his favor and made it clear that Fairstead had no right to appropriate tens of millions of dollars of his equity. That fact is indisputable.”\nFairstead does dispute it, pointing to the fact that the Delaware decision did not address two other ongoing claims related to the operating agreements. It expects the forfeiture of Blodgett’s interests to be addressed later in court.\n“We are pleased that the arbitrator found that Mr. Blodgett engaged in widespread misconduct including outright theft of Fairstead’s property and breaches of his fiduciary duties,” Michael Carlinksy, an attorney for Fairstead, said in a statement. “The Arbitrator forfeited his pending interests and further consequences of his conduct, including forfeiture of his other interests, will be addressed in subsequent court proceedings.”\nThe arbitrator indicated that while Fairstead did not prevail on all of its claims, it should be awarded attorneys’ fees because it “substantially prevailed on the critical claims and issues presented in arbitration.” The fees will be calculated according to attorney services related to Fairstead’s successful claims.\nStill, the arbitrator rejected Fairstaid’s claim that Blodgett owed the company more than $34 million for failing to disclose a business opportunity in the form of an off-market transaction in March 2022. The decision also found that Fairstead did not prove that Blodgett “used Fairstead’s information to obtain an advantage over competitor,” or tried to usurp the company’s business opportunities.",

    "text": "Large waves will continue to pound the Southern California coast Friday and into the weekend, raising the risk of flooding while creating dangerous conditions for anyone entering the ocean water.\nNational Weather Service forecasters said there were reports of waves reaching 16 feet in Los Angeles County Thursday. As a result, a high surf advisory that had been issued for L.A. County beaches until 10 p.m. Saturday was upgraded to a high surf warning, with waves of 8 to 13 feet anticipated, and some isolated sets possibly reaching 20 feet.\n“These are forecast to be extremely dangerous conditions, as powerful waves and life-threatening rip currents pose an exceptional risk of ocean drowning and damage to coastal structures such as piers and jetties,” according to the NWS. “Impacts will only slightly lessen into Friday — before an additional strong wave front arrives from the NW, reinforcing extremely dangerous conditions at the beaches again on Saturday.”\nForecasters said the highest surf is anticipated at west-facing beaches such as Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes.\nA coastal flooding advisory will also be in effect until 10 p.m. Saturday for Los Angeles County beaches, including the Malibu coast and Catalina Island.\n“Flooding of sea water is likely, around the time of high tide, over vulnerable low-lying coastal areas such as parking lots, beaches, and walkways,” according to the NWS. “Significant damage to roads or structures is NOT expected. There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.”\nIn Orange County, a high surf warning and coastal flood advisory will be in effect until 2 a.m. Monday. Forecasters said Orange County beaches will see waves of 6 to 12 feet, with sets of up to 15 feet in northern Orange County.\nForecasters said the area could receive some light to moderate rain Friday night into Saturday, and there’s a chance of some light rain Sunday. According to the NWS, there is a “slight chance of light rain in Pasadena on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day,” when the Rose Parade will make its way along Colorado Boulevard.",
