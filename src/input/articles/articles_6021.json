In addition to this match relocated in the good atmosphere of Castres, the attacking festival of the Parisians, the masterful collective action of the fourth goal, the tasty exchange between the coaches Luis Enrique and Nicolas Giné... Maxime Zahil, number 10 of US Revel, also had his own moment of happiness.\nThe Revelois midfielder, who faced Kylian Mbappé three times during his younger years, was able to reclaim the Parisian star's jersey. \"I've talked about it before. Our paths had already crossed. At half-time, we talked about it a little bit. He gave it to me of his own accord. I thought it was a very nice and classy gesture,\" he told BeIn Sports.\n😁 The lucky winner of Mbappé's jersey. pic.twitter.com/WnjrDq1m4k\n— RMC Sport (@RMCsport) January 7, 2024\nThe vice-captain of US Revel had even warned his teammates of his experience during his previous confrontations. \"It was already going very, very fast. It was explosive. Precisely, I played on his side to defend a little more on him,\" he said in a press conference. Advice that was clearly not enough as the PSG number 7 scored a hat-trick, including a headed goal from a pigeon-wing cross from Marco Asensio.\nBut the main thing was elsewhere for the Haut-Garonne people. \"It was the game of a lifetime. The result is anecdotal. For three weeks, we went through something crazy. The most important thing is that we left a good image to all of France because that's the magic of the Coupe de France. We're savouring these last moments and, after that, it's back to reality in the league,\" regrets Maxime Zahil. The end of an enchanted interlude.",

    "title": "Retired Wyoming Sailor Turns His Midwest Home Into Navy Museum | Your Wyoming News Source",
    "text": "Visit Gene Dickerson on Peake Street and enter one man’s heartfelt salute to the service he spent 22 years in as a Navy electrician. A mannequin named “Jimmy” in a sailor outfit stands on a porch turned “quarterdeck” with a bosun’s whistle around his neck. When Cowboy State Daily showed up this past week, Dickerson pulled the rope off to the side of the porch to ring the bell to welcome a visitor into his home. The bell once sounded on the deck of the USS Currituck, a seaplane tender — Dickerson’s first Navy ship. The 77-year-old has made his two-lot Wyoming retirement haven into an unofficial but artifact-filled U.S. Navy museum. While Dickerson officially left the Navy in 1985, it is clear the Navy has not left him. His cellphone ringtone sounds “General Quarters.” “Once I got out (of the service), I moved to Colorado. Unfortunately, 14 years ago they taxed me out of existence there,” he said. “My son had moved up here and so had my brother, so they were the smart ones and I just followed. That’s when the museum came into existence. “It was a joke at first, but it keeps growing. I had enough stuff to fill a couple of rooms, so now I keep getting more.” Shells, Uniforms, Ship Replicas Outside Dickerson’s home are tents filled with shells from weapons once used on naval ships, mannequins in uniforms and a replica bunk room of a ship with Dickerson’s original locker from the Currituck. In a trailer are his original service uniforms with a porthole installed from that same ship. A separate tent displays handmade radio-controlled detailed replicas of all the ships Dickerson served on, and others. And outside on the street sits a vintage a Model A Ford truck with “United States Naval Petroleum Reserve 3” stenciled on it. The truck is a nod to the former oil reserve region just 15 miles south of town that was to serve U.S. Navy ships in case of war as they converted from steam to diesel power. The reserve became the center of the Teapot Dome scandal in the 1920s. Dickerson’s naval career started at age 19. His stepfather was in the U.S. Army and stationed in France, where Dickerson completed high school. He wanted to join the Navy and was told a recruiting office was in Germany. He went to Germany and was told that the U.S. naval recruiter had left long ago and he would have to go to London. He made the trip to London, and so ended up joining the Navy from an office off Piccadilly Square. Two weeks later he was flown to the United States for boot camp at Great Lakes, Illinois. Seven weeks after that he was in San Diego to prepare for Vietnam. Then, in less than a month, he found himself in a war zone. “We did a tour down Cam Ranh Bay and did some shore bombardment,” he said. After more than a year doing various operations in the war zone, the ship was sent back to California for decommissioning. During that time, Dickerson had the opportunity to collect the first artifacts for his future museum — the locker, the porthole and the bell. Shipboard Career Dickerson’s career would see him trained as an electrician and serve on several ships, including the hospital ship USS Sanctuary, an oiler, a tugboat, a troop transport ship, a submarine tender and to end his career an aircraft carrier. Dickerson’s role as an electrician came on the whim of a U.S. Navy petty officer who assigned career fields. “I wanted to be a carpenter,” Dickerson said. “The guy in front of me became a boiler tech and the guy behind me became a machinist mate and I ended up becoming an electrician.” He initially learned through books and hands-on training, but when he re-enlisted for a career, he went to an official electrician’s mate school. By the end of his career he had served stints teaching the trade at naval schools. “I did everything from small craft, boats and electrical systems on boats and last but not least, missile components,” he said. “We did flight deck lighting, elevators and cranes. We generated (the electricity), we distributed it and we repaired it. On the carrier we even got to work on a three-story escalator for officers to go from the hangar bay up to the flight deck.” Radio-Controlled Hobby Dickerson’s hobby starting while he was on his first ship was making detailed model radio-controlled boats. His first was a replica of the USS Missouri battleship. It sits in his living room. He said the first time he put it in the water was in Vietnam. He ran it around his ship in Da Nang where the Vietcong were known to mine waters. Since then, he’s made many more models and several are on display in the museum. He is currently working an exact model of the Currituck. “My executive officer on the Currituck, we got together on the phone, he actually went down to the D.C. (naval) archives and got me the original navy blueprints of the Currituck,” Dickerson said. “I had them enlarged to the 1/23rd scale so I could build it.” He uses cardboard to do a pattern of the decks and rooms, and then goes to making the wooden model. Varied Visitors From Around World Visitors to the museum are varied and have come from all over the world. “I’ve had people from Holland and I’ve had people from Texas,” he said. “I had one U.S. Navy captain who was on a bicycle who was touring from New Mexico heading to Montana and stopped here.” The former captain ended up sending Dickerson a new flame-safety lamp that the Navy used in rooms where explosives were kept. It’s in the museum. A U.S. Border Patrol official stopped by another time, and he sent Dickerson back a ship’s compass. Other artifacts have come from people in the community. A neighbor found an old World War 1 helmet in a box when he was cleaning out a shed, another called with a box of newspapers that had a Detroit Free Press front page the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed. Still other artifacts come from the region. A ship’s anchor in Dickerson’s yard came from a Mills gunshop, some naval ordinance shells from another gunshop. He also has anchor chains from the USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier that he acquired during a tour of the vessel in Boston. “They said, ‘Here is our junk pallet, got anything there you need?’ So, I got three links of anchor chain off the USS Kennedy sitting out there,” he said. Going through security to get on the airplane with that chain in his bag required some extra explanations. Model A ‘Daily Driver’ The shiny red Model A Ford 1931 hardtop truck came from Casper. “It runs, it’s a daily driver for me,” he said. “A couple of months ago when the weather was nice, we actually drove it up to Kaycee because we go to the buffet on Sundays. She’ll do a whole 45 mph.” The “we” means Dickerson and wife Eunice, 75, who he met at a U.S. Army base in Denver. They were married in 1971. She was a U.S. Army medic, and they wed after her enlistment ended. “I let her finish her sentence, and then I took her away from all that,” Dickerson said. The museum keeps no set hours. If he’s home, it’s open. The potential for new artifacts means Dickerson’s job is never done. “Stuff just keeps coming in,” he said.

    "text": "Para evitar en la medida de lo posible el trasvase de usuarios que están migrando de X (antes Twitter) a Bluesky , para que incluso medios como The Guardian abandonen la red social de Elon Musk al convertirse en un 'espacio digital de desinformación', ahora ha anunciado que se etiquetarán las cuentas parodia para diferenciarlas de otras.\nEste tipo de cuentas han generado mucha confusión al ser algunas prácticamente idénticas a las originales de los perfiles públicos, por lo que ha sido bien fácil tomar sus tuits como las palabras mismas de las cuentas originales a las que parodian.\nEn un momento bien complicado para X frente a Bluesky que está recibiendo miles y miles de usuarios cada día después que Elon Musk formase parte del gobierno de Donald Trump, esta novedad puede hacer frente a esa consigna que está quedando en el aire y no es otra que X se está convirtiendo en un espacio para la desinformación.\nY lo interesante de esta novedad anunciada hace horas por X es que la etiqueta que denominará un perfil como sátira o parodia aparecerá tanto en las publicaciones o tuits hechos como en las cuentas .\nEs decir, que será bien fácil identificar si una cuenta que es similar a la de un personaje público es una de parodia. X menciona que se está desplegando los perfiles para cuentas parodia para que sea bien fácil verificarlas y así incrementar la transparencia para garantizar que los usuarios no sean engañados.\nWe’re rolling out profile labels for parody accounts to clearly distinguish these types of accounts and their content on our platform. We designed these labels to increase transparency and to ensure that users are not deceived into thinking such accounts belong to the entity…\n— Safety (@Safety) January 10, 2025 Ya en noviembre, según TechCrunch , se supo que X estaba trabajando en esta etiqueta para denominar esas cuentas tanto en sus tuits como en el perfil. Lo único que esta etiqueta ha de aplicarse manualmente desde la cuenta parodia desde un nuevo ajuste que aparece desde las opciones de cuenta y luego en información de cuenta.\nSe podrá ver la opción para etiquetar la cuenta apropiadamente si hace sátira o parodia a un personaje público o una marca. Y el objetivo de X es acabar con la confusión que estas cuentas han ocasionado ya desde hace años, y aunque tenía que haberse hecho antes, no está mal que lo haga ahora, y más en el momento que vive con Bluesky recogiendo a los usuarios desencantados con el devenir de la red social propiedad de Elon Musk.\nManuel Ramírez. El Androide Libre.\n[Esta es la mejor alternativa a X (Twitter): un millón de usuarios abandonan a Elon Musk tras los fallos continuados] La red social ha mencionado que dará pronto los detalles sobre la fecha en la que esta etiqueta será obligatoria para este tipo de cuentas. Lo curioso de X es que desde sus notas de la política de autenticidad mantiene que no se permite la suplantación de cuentas, aunque la plataforma sí que da pie a parodiar perfiles mientras se mantengan bajo las reglas de X (antes Twitter).\nX Elon Musk España Twitter NEWSLETTER - TECNOLOGÍA Recibe de lunes a viernes las noticias clave sobre tecnología Apuntarme De conformidad con el RGPD y la LOPDGDD, EL LEÓN DE EL ESPAÑOL PUBLICACIONES, S.A. tratará los datos facilitados con la finalidad de remitirle noticias de actualidad.",

However, its slender form factor and rather small size makes it easy to lose the remote, especially when it slips down in between the seat cushions.\nIn this how-to article, I’ll show you how you can quickly find your lost 2nd generation Siri Remote by using the Control Center on your iPhone running iOS 17.\n- Swipe down from the top-right on your iPhone to display the Control Center.\n- Tap the icon for the Apple TV Remote, as shown above.\n- Select your Apple TV from the Remote app, then press the “Find” button for your lost Siri Remote. You should then see a notification confirming its location. You may be required to walk around the room a bit to connect with the remote.\n- Once the Siri Remote has been detected, you’ll see a white dot appear on your iPhone’s screen, which will increase in size as you near the remote’s location. The display will also indicate whether you are close to, far from, or right next to the remote. To add a bit of fun, think of it as a game of Marco Polo between you and your remote.\n- Once you’ve found the remote, tap “Found It” on your iPhone, or if you need to keep looking, tap “Keep Looking.”",
