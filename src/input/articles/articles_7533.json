    "title": "Canadians across country celebrate New Year's Day with polar bear swims",
    "text": "Thousands of people across Canada shrieked, shivered and smiled their way into a new year on Monday as they took part in the long-standing tradition of Jan. 1 polar bear dips. Canadians have been marking New Year's Day with plunges into lakes, oceans and rivers made frigid by typical January conditions since at least 1920, and scheduled events in cities spanning Halifax to Vancouver were poised to maintain the ritual. Joanie McNally, from Sackville, N.S., lost no time in kicking off this year's polar dips when she ran into the icy ocean water at Queensland Beach on Nova Scotia's South Shore at 9 a.m. Monday morning. In doing so, she also fulfilled a long-standing personal goal. “We’re always at this beach, but this is the first time (swimming) when it’s on the more frigid side,” she said moments before taking the plunge. “It’s a bit of a challenge to start the new year on the right track.” The temperature sat around -5 C as McNally and 11 other swimmers stripped off their winter jackets, mittens and hats and went off into the icy waves. McNally’s husband and daughter, along with a handful of other spectators, cheered and hollered for the group as they ran from the frozen sand to the chilly water. Dave Morash, also from the Sackville area, said it was the coldest polar plunge he’s done in at least six years. Morash and a small group of fellow high school teachers have been doing the plunge together since 2018, but he says this was the first time since then that the temperature has been below zero on New Year's Day. “It’s invigorating, it’s like all of your nerve endings start tingling,” he said immediately after the dip. “I always refer to it as a reboot, you sort of reboot your system like a computer. So here we go, here comes 2024,” he said with a laugh as he dried off. Monday's swim, while launching new traditions for some, also marked a departure from New Year's Days past in Halifax. For many years, swimmers jumped into the ocean from a city wharf as part of the Herring Cove Polar Bear Dip. The non-profit organization that put on the event since 1994 cancelled the 2021 dip due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it has not resumed since. A recent social media post from the Herring Cove Polar Dip organization said it is “hoping to look at options going forward” for future events and asked for volunteer support. When Halifax resident Darrell Robert found out there would not be an organized dip yet again this year, he suggested in comments on social media that people meet at Queensland Beach for an impromptu swim. “It's nice to corral people and motivate each other to do something new on a new year,” he said, adding he was pleased to see so many faces show up at the beach Monday morning. “I like to see people get together as a community, I think it’s great and it's a great start to the new year.” Small groups of cold-water swimmers were expected to do their own polar plunges throughout Nova Scotia. More than 20 swimmers in Halifax took an icy plunge into the Northwest Arm at Sir Sandford Fleming Park. The weather was warmer and the crowds were substantially larger on the other side of the country where thousands of people plunged into Vancouver's English Bay. Outside temperatures for the city's 104th event sat at 6 C and organizers said the water was about two degrees warmer, as participants, some dressed as Elvis or wearing hats shaped like rubber ducks, took the plunge. This year was Anne Rainbow's 20th polar bear swim. She said past New Year's dips have come with snow on the ground. \"That's when I learned to wear shoes,\" she joked, noting the red, bare feet of other participants who had just exited the water. She said the relatively warm weather this year meant she was able to go in for a second dip. \"I'm addicted to it. I love it,\" she said. \"Just the energy, the cleansing. The feeling of making you feel like you're ready to start a new year.\" Rainbow's friend Cindy Wells has watched the event in the past but decided to participate for the first time this year. \"I needed to start new for 2024. It was a crazy 2023,\" she said. Similar events, many of which were intended to raise money for charity, were set to take place in locations including Charlottetown and Saint John, N.B. In Oakville, Ont., a city just west of Toronto, the return of sub-zero temperatures following days of unseasonably mild conditions proved no deterrent for the roughly 850 people who took part in a plunge at Coronation Park. The swim in Lake Ontario was intended to raise money for charity World Vision Canada. CEO Michael Messenger said this year’s dip has so far raised $100,000 towards projects that help provide clean water in developing countries. The 39th annual Oakville plunge marked the first such dip for 11-year-old Luca Tarabokia. “I’m pretty excited for it because the waves look awesome and I like the waves,” Tarabokia said. “It’s my first time. I want to do it again next year if it goes well.\" His mother, Jane Moran, called Tarabokia the \"cold water representative\" for their family. “You’ve got to have a certain fortitude to be able to do this and I really, really admire those who are able to do it, but I’m not one of them,\" she said with a laugh. -- With files from Ashley Joannou in Vancouver This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 1, 2024.

    "title": "Oregon's in store for a bad wildfire season. But state officials aren't worried about federal staffing",
    "text": "Oregon is expected to have an extremely hot and dry summer, setting the state up for a potentially devastating wildfire season ahead.\nThat was the message from Gov. Tina Kotek during a press conference on Wednesday.\nWhile parts of the state benefited from decent snowpack and rainfall this winter, Kotek said, that could actually make wildfires even worse. More precipitation could mean more grasses, brush and other vegetation that can dry out in the dead of summer, becoming wildfire fuel.\nThat’s bad news for a state that had one of its worst wildfire seasons on record last year when almost 2 million acres burned, mostly affecting rangeland in Eastern Oregon.\n“In summary, we are preparing for what is likely to be even more aggressive and increasingly difficult-to-control wildfire season this year,” Kotek said.\nWhile there may be chilly days ahead this spring, Kotek warned: “Fire season is here.”\n“We are already hearing callouts for debris burns on private property that have gotten out of control,” Kotek said. “People need to understand the fire season has begun.”\nLast week, the Oregon Department of Forestry announced an uptick in escaped debris burn piles, with multiple fires burning up to 30 acres this spring.\nMeanwhile, the federal government has slashed staffing nationwide, including employees who help fight fires on federal lands — which make up over half of Oregon’s land base. Democratic U.S. Sens. Jeff Merkley and Patty Murray, from Oregon and Washington, are convening a conference Thursday to highlight how federal staffing cuts “are seriously undermining wildfire preparedness and response” in the Pacific Northwest.\nBut during Wednesday’s conference, Kotek didn’t seem too concerned about firefighting resources.\n“The consistency across the region, in terms of our partnerships, is solid, and we’re not anticipating any reduction in the staff that are needed at this coming fire season,” Kotek said.\nOregon Department of Forestry’s Deputy Director of Fire Operations, Kyle Williams, chimed in.\n“What might not show up on the fire line has still yet to be determined,” Williams said. “But we’re going to be as prepared as possible.”\nWilliams added that Oregon can still seek firefighting assistance from other states, as well as Canadian provinces that are part of the Northwest Wildland Firefighting Compact.\nA reporter at Wednesday’s press conference asked if there was any concern about Canadian firefighters being reluctant to cross the U.S. border, as the Trump administration’s anti-immigration crackdown has scared away many international travelers. Canada has had the biggest tourism drop-off: Trips made from Canada into the U.S. fell by nearly a million in March compared with the same time last year, reports the Toronto Star.\nBut Oregon officials don’t think that will be an issue.\n“It’s business as usual,” Williams said.\nOregon’s forestry department will have around 400 seasonal staff to help fight fires, on top of its 700 permanent staff. That’s about how many people it had on hand last year, Williams said. The department wouldn’t be able to hire many more without legislative approval.",

    "text": "Hyderabad: Raising strong objection against the proposed move to demolish 150-year-old Sunheri Masjid, which is located near the secretariate in New Delhi, Hyderabad MP and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi has shot a letter to the Chief Architect of New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC). In the letter, Owaisi has expressing his concerns regarding the demolition of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid at Central Secretariat, days after the urban body issued a public notice seeking Delhi residents’ suggestions or objections on the matter until January 1. Owaisi stressed the historical and architectural importance of Sunehri Masjid, and said its removal would constitute an ‘irredeemable loss to India’s heritage’. “It is not only unfortunate but astounding that the council thinks that a mosque that has been there for nearly past 200 years is an ‘obstruction.’ It is also unfortunate that the council has ignored its own duty to conserve the heritage and beauty of the capital city,” he wrote. By choosing to remove a heritage site that is also a place of worship, the NDMC is violating the right of freedom of religion of Muslims under Article 25, he said. “This notification violates Article 25 of the constitution which guarantees freedom of religion which is a fundamental right… It also violates Article 29 which ensures the protection of culture,” he added. Owaisi further accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of showing hostility towards Muslims, mosques, and the Azaan.",

    "text": "New York governor promises a floating pool in city waterways New York Governor Kathy Hochul has announced support for a plan to build a floating swimming pool in New York City's waterways NEW YORK -- A plan for a floating swimming pool in New York City’s waterways moved one step closer to reality Friday after Gov. Kathy Hochul announced her support — and $12 million in public funding — for the unusual venture. The commitment breathed new life into an idea first proposed over a decade ago and dismissed by some as an urban fantasy: a self-filtering swimming pool shaped like a plus sign in the murky currents of the East River. In the years since it first drew media attention, private backers of the project, known as +Pool, have seen fitful progress collide with regulatory barriers. But as rising summer heat sends more New Yorkers to beaches and pools, Gov. Hochul vowed to fast-track the “long-stalled, much-debated innovative floating pool concept.” She said a “demonstration” version would be tested this summer, with an actual, swimmable pool scheduled to open to the public by summer 2025. Hochul also announced a proposal to build new swimming pools and hire more lifeguards across the state, framing that initiative as a public health investment that will lead to more kids learning how to swim. If approved by state lawmakers, a $60 million grant program would build 10 new pools in underserved communities, and an additional $30 million would pay for pop-up pools during heat waves. A spokesperson for Hochul said the funding for +Pool will come from existing grants and does not need to be approved by lawmakers. Mayor Eric Adams, who also has backed the concept, said the city would chip in $4 million. Like much of the country, New York City has seen a shortage of lifeguards that have led to beach and pool closures and swim lesson cancellations. Budget cuts ordered late last year by Adams have also impacted funding for swim programs. Officials offered few details about the floating pool, including where it would be located or who would be responsible for its operation. A spokesperson for Adams said the city’s Parks Department, which oversees public pools, would be involved in some capacity. Kara Meyer, the managing director of +Pool, said it would be run by the nonprofit Friends of +Pool. Meyer compared the project to the High Line, a privately funded public park on an abandoned freight line that took years to complete. She said the “intent is to be free and open to the public” but there could be special events or activities in the pool that cost money. She declined to say where it would be located. The project’s backers have previously described an Olympic-length pool attached to the riverbed off Manhattan's Lower East Side, with a unique filtration system capable of cleaning 1 million gallons of water per day. Though New York's waters have become cleaner in recent years, millions of gallons of sewage-contaminated water drain into the rivers during heavy rainstorms. Meyer said the floating pool would “change the way New Yorkers experience the water,” recalling an earlier era when residents frequently bathed in the rivers to cool off. “A community of people came together to say we want public access to our waters, and that’s a beautiful thing,” she said. “In the next decade, New York’s waterfronts are going to look very different.”",

    "title": "A new lens into Trump’s legacy of adding to the federal debt - The Washington Post",
    "text": "On the campaign trail in 2016, Donald Trump often criticized President Barack Obama and Washington more broadly by invoking a very large number: the scale of the federal debt. There were a few reasons for him to raise this issue (which, unlike other assertions he made during that campaign, was essentially true). One, of course, was that it was a way to seize upon the broad distaste Americans have for paying taxes — and specifically, the lingering anger among Republicans about taxation and spending. The other was that this was still an issue on which Republican candidates focused — though, once in office, not much was generally done to address it. So it was with Trump. When he came into office, the debt was just a tick under $20 trillion. By the time he left — in only four years, half the duration of Obama’s White House tenure — it had grown to just under $28 trillion. It remains the single largest four-year increase in history, though President Biden (who has seen the debt increase $6.4 trillion so far in his presidency) may give him a run for his money. Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley , who is running against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, has at times criticized Trump for allowing the debt to increase so rapidly. This, too, isn’t a mystery; while there wasn’t a great deal of Republican criticism while Trump was overseeing the increase, it is still an issue on which Republicans in particular have strong feelings. A Washington Post-538-Ipsos poll conducted this month found that 3 in 10 Republicans viewed the federal debt as one of the most important issues facing the country. Only inflation and immigration came in higher. Trump’s response to such criticism is simple: The economy was humming, and then the coronavirus pandemic hit. That’s why the debt surged so much. This was an argument used in defense of Obama, too, that the exogenous financial crash meant that enormous spending was suddenly needed. (Not that Trump often acknowledged that argument in 2016.) New analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, though, undermines Trump’s argument. It considered several policies signed into law by Trump and found that, on a 10-year time span (as such legislation usually operates), Trump’s administration added more than $8 trillion to the debt. Importantly, less than half of that was a function of the pandemic. The CRFB analysis indicates that when Trump came into office, the government was projected to add at least $3 trillion in debt over four years — an estimate that derives from commitments made by previous presidents. Trump exceeded that (largely thanks to covid) but then also pushed up the debt for the presidents that followed him (including, should he win in November, himself). While Americans like to complain about taxes, and the debt is a perennial source of performative frustration — the old “leaving debt for our grandkids” line is about a century old — they often don’t really care that much if the spending is on things they like. This very much fits into Trumpian politics, of course. Say the thing that people expect to hear, and then don’t worry much about doing something else.",

Par Belga Publié le 13/09/2024 à 06:50 Temps de lecture: 1 min L a Stib prévoit de fortes perturbations sur son réseau le lundi 16 septembre à l’occasion de la journée d’action syndicale en soutien aux travailleurs d’Audi Brussels, indique-t-elle jeudi. Elle n’est pas encore en mesure de préciser leur ampleur mais invite les personnes qui en ont la possibilité à prévoir des solutions alternatives pour se déplacer à Bruxelles ce jour-là. La SNCB ne s’attend par contre à aucun problème sur le rail.\nEnviron 10.000 personnes sont attendues lundi dans la capitale pour une manifestation nationale en soutien aux travailleurs et sous-traitants d’Audi Brussels, dont l’avenir est en suspens. Cet appel du front commun syndical s’érige également en cri d’alarme face aux difficultés que traverse l’ensemble du secteur industriel européen.\nLes syndicats de la Stib ont invité leurs affiliés à participer à l’action et la société bruxelloise de transport public prévoit donc de fortes perturbations sur le réseau métro, tram et bus.\nLa Stib tentera néanmoins d’assurer au moins une partie du service et informera les voyageurs de la situation sur le réseau en temps réel via ses différents canaux (site internet, application mobile, écrans aux arrêts et en stations, réseaux sociaux).",
