    "text": "Alexa ha simplificado la vida de los usuarios al permitirles realizar diversas tareas con solo activar comandos de voz simples. Desde reproducir música y revisar calendarios hasta realizar búsquedas, jugar y establecer recordatorios.Es bien sabido que para aprovechar todas las funciones del asistente inteligente de Amazon, se necesita tener acceso a Internet. Sin embargo, ¿sabías que es posible utilizar Alexa sin estar conectado a Wi-Fi o datos móviles? Te explicamos cómo hacerlo.Los problemas de conexión a Internet pueden surgir en ocasiones, lo que puede dificultar el uso del asistente inteligente de Amazon.Aunque la mayoría de las funciones de Alexa requieren una conexión a una red, ya sea Wi-Fi o de datos móviles, existe una alternativa para utilizar Alexa cuando no tienes acceso a ninguna de esas opciones. Sin embargo, esta alternativa tiene sus propias limitaciones.En ese sentido, lo que puedes hacer es configurar tu Alexa para que funcione como bocina a través de una conexión bluetooth sin internet.Cabe destacar que otras funciones del asistente inteligente, como los comandos, no podrán funcionar si no cuentas con wifi o datos móviles. Por lo que lo único que podrás hacer es reproducir música o cualquier otro tipo de sonidos a través de la bocina.\"Recuerda que sin conexión a internet, no será posible dar comandos a tu dispositivo, para esto y otras funciones es necesaria la conexión\", advierte el staff de Amazon en una publicación en su foro oficial.De acuerdo al Centro de ayuda de Amazon, estos son los pasos que debes de seguir para vincular tu dispositivo con Alexa:Debes saber que sólo podrás vincular tu dispositivo con Alexa mientras ambos estén conectados a internet, por lo que es un paso que debes asegurar hacer antes de perder el acceso a una red.El Centro de ayuda de Amazon señala que una vez que completes esta configuración inicial, es posible que no necesites volver a hacerlo, pues algunos dispositivos se conectan automáticamente cuando están cerca.MF",

    "text": "Bible study behind bars with ‘Pastor Bob’\nClick here for updates on this story\nSALT LAKE CITY, Utah (\nKSTU) — Prison can be a dark, cold and lonely place.\nIt’s a place most people want to avoid.\nBut for more than 30 years, Robert Aguilar walked through the gates of the Utah State Prison willingly in an effort to deliver hope.\n“God has listened and heard my voice in prayer,” Aguilar reads from scripture.\nThe tools of the trade are simple. A kind voice, an open heart, and a Bible.\n“There is a dark area of the prison system and some get tired of it,” Aguilar said. “They want to change and that means it’s from the heart.”\nAguilar began taking his Bible to the Utah State Prison in 1983. It was a way for him to turn his life around.\n“I had a sense of worthlessness because of the life I had been leading previously,” Aguilar said. “I was a heavy drinker. My wife mentioned that she was going to leave me.”\nFaith, Aguilar says, changed his life.\n“I felt like I had something more. We all have something in our lives that calls to that. There is something more important that we can do than just living.”\nIt was that faith that led Aguilar to devote his Sunday mornings as a christian minister — volunteering with prisoners willing to listen.\n“When I walk in they call me ‘Pastor Bob,’ they all know me as Pastor Bob here.\nBryan Taylor is a deputy warden for the prison who oversees volunteers.\n“I actually reached out and talked to some of the inmates out of the prison and they just love him,” Taylor said.\nThe deputy warden says the service provided by Aguilar and prison volunteers is life changing.\n“Individuals when they are locked away and they are contemplating their life – having someone to talk to – that one-on-one communication face-to-face can not be replicated by anything else than doing it,” Taylor said.\nNow 88 years old, Aguilar likes to be with his family, work in his garden, or enjoy a meal at Ogies, his favorite restaurant in West Valley City. It’s a place where he’s reconnected with some former prisoners.\n“I had fellows come in and they tapped me on the back and they say ‘Pastor Bob, you don’t know me, I was in your services and I took on what you told me, what was in scripture that my life could be changed. My life has changed I go to church and I am a happy man and I want to thank you for what you did.’”\nThose moments bring Aguilar joy, knowing his change for the good has helped others find a similar path and bring good to the world.\n“Praise be to God who has not rejected my prayer or has not held his love from me.”\nAguilar says he would have liked to keep going, but the walk in the new prison parking lot is just too much compared to the old facility. He estimates the walk is about a quarter of a mile and he’s afraid he’d fall down and hurt himself.\nStill though, prisoners call him on the phone to maintain communication.\nIf you’re interested in being a volunteer at the Utah State Prison, here is a link:\ncorrections.utah.gov/volunteer/volunteer-programs\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

The company is conducting a recruitment drive next month at 10 locations in Assam. It was confirmed by Assam cabinet minister Jayanta Mallabaruah on X on 30 December. “Proud to announce that after our first recruitment drive where we selected 541 female candidates, we are going to hold another recruitment drive. TATA Electronics, through Assam Skill Development Mission, will conduct a recruitment test from January 3 to 8, 2024 across 8 districts in the state to hire 1000 female candidates for FATP facility at Narasapura (near Bangalore)”, he tweeted.

The tests will be held at ITIs and other institutions at Kamrup Rural, Morigaon, Udalguri, Baksa, Lakhimpur, Biswanath and East & West Karbi Anglong districts. The notification issued by Assam Skill Development Mission states that 1000 female technicians will be recruited by Tata Electronics for its Final Assembly Testing and Packaging (FATP) facility at Narasapur near Bengaluru in Karnataka. The selected candidates will be recruited under the Apprenticeship Act, 1965. The apprentices will get a stipend of ₹12,000 per month, apart from free food, transportation and accommodation. It is expected that after completing the training, the youths will join Tata’s upcoming semiconductor plant in Assam. Tata Electronics is investing ₹200 crore in the semiconductor assembly, testing and packing unit at Narasapura in Kolar district, which is around 65 km from Bengaluru. Assembly, Testing and Packing is a major step in semiconductor manufacturing, where wafers are processed into individual chips, packaged, and then tested to prepare them to use in electronic devices. Notably, the company has also acquired Wistron’s iPhone manufacturing unit in Kolar. Tata Electronics is venturing into the semiconductor industry with a Final Assembly Testing and Packaging (FATP) facility before [setting ](https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/karti-chidambaram-mocks-tata-groups-plan-for-a-semiconductor-plant-in-assam-receives-backlash/)up a much larger semiconductor processing plant in Assam. The company is [investing](https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/tata-group-planning-40000-crore-semiconductor-unit-in-assam-cm-18527091.htm) ₹40,000 crore to set up a semiconductor processing plant in Jagiroad near Guwahati in Assam. The state govt has already approved the plant, and now the company is waiting for clearance from the centre to go ahead with the plant. The company’s decision to set up the plant in Assam came after the state govt introduced a productivity-linked incentive [scheme ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/assam-government-approves-semiconductor-pli-policy-to-attract-investments/articleshow/103070861.cms)for the semiconductor industry.

The semiconductor industry [requires ](https://www.wired.com/story/want-to-win-a-chip-war-youre-gonna-need-a-lot-of-water/)a large quantity of ultra-pure water during processing, and Assam has an abundant supply of water from Brahmaputra and its numerous tributaries.",
