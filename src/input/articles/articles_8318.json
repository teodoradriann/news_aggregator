    "text": "ORONO — The University of Maine celebrated a milestone Wednesday with the opening of its new robotic cow milking facility.\nLocated at Witter Farm on the university’s Orono campus, the facility is only the third of its kind in Maine.\nAccording to a study conducted by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, the rising cost of labor and supplies—combined with flatlining revenue—has forced many dairy farms across the state to close.\nWitter Farm Superintendent Patricia Henderson said robotic milking machines could help address this issue.\n“Do we pay our grain bill or do we pay our employees this month? And this is really going to help those farms understand the investment in robotics and how to help bridge that gap in their challenges,” said Henderson.\nHenderson said the machine works by allowing cows to choose when they’re milked.\n“She walks into the stanchion. It will ID her by her ear tag. And it will know exactly who it is, how much milk she’s making, what she did, you know, six hours before, and exactly where the teat placement is on her udder,” said Henderson.\nMary Castonguay, an Organic Valley dairy farmer and board member of the Maine Dairy Industry Association, agrees the new technology will help address the labor shortage.\n“It’s hard to find good, reliable help. And a lot of farms are turning to robots for milking,” said Castonguay.\nThe new facility also benefits students involved in the program, who were previously tasked with milking the university’s 35 cows twice a day. Now, they can focus on skills that will be more beneficial for their careers.\n“Rather than our students doing actual milking and all the labor-intensive parts of the dairy farm, now they get to learn the robotics side of it, which is going to help them for future careers and stuff because, obviously, the industry is going robotic. So we’re going to need to train people who know and understand robotics if this is the industry they want to go into,” said Henderson.\nHenderson said they anticipate giving the cows 24-hour access to the machine will increase milk productivity by about 15 percent.\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Alex Schley Reporter\nAuthor email Follow Alex Schley Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

    "text": "Stock Story -\nWellness products company Nature’s Sunshine Products (NASDAQ:NATR) reported Q3 CY2024 results beating Wall Street’s revenue expectations, with sales up 3.1% year on year to $114.6 million. The company’s full-year revenue guidance of $445.5 million at the midpoint came in 1.4% above analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.23 per share was also 64.3% above analysts’ consensus estimates.\nIs now the time to buy Nature's Sunshine? Find out by reading the original article on StockStory, it’s free .\nNature's Sunshine (NATR) Q3 CY2024 Highlights:\nRevenue: $114.6 million vs analyst estimates of $108.9 million (5.2% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.23 vs analyst estimates of $0.14 ($0.09 beat) EBITDA: $10.73 million vs analyst estimates of $9.36 million (14.7% beat) The company lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $445.5 million at the midpoint from $440.5 million, a 1.1% increase EBITDA guidance for the full year is $41 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $39.56 million Gross Margin (GAAP): 71.3%, down from 73.1% in the same quarter last year Operating Margin: 4.6%, in line with the same quarter last year EBITDA Margin: 9.4%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 6.9%, down from 8.9% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $263.2 million “The third quarter delivered the highest sales volume this year, with $114.6 million in sales, up 4% versus prior year on a local currency basis. The strong performance was driven by robust customer growth in Japan and Taiwan, continued progress in Korea, and strong execution and customer activation in Central Europe.” said Terrence Moorehead, CEO of Nature’s Sunshine.Company OverviewStarted on a kitchen table in Utah, Nature’s Sunshine Products (NASDAQ:NATR) manufactures and sells nutritional and personal care products.\nPersonal Care While personal care products products may seem more discretionary than food, consumers tend to maintain or even boost their spending on the category during tough times. This phenomenon is known as \"the lipstick effect\" by economists, which states that consumers still want some semblance of affordable luxuries like beauty and wellness when the economy is sputtering.Consumer tastes are constantly changing, and personal care companies are currently responding to the public’s increased desire for ethically produced goods by featuring natural ingredients in their products.\nSales Growth A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall business quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for multiple years.Nature's Sunshine is a small consumer staples company, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefitting from economies of scale.\nAs you can see below, Nature's Sunshine’s sales grew at a weak 1.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last three years. This shows it failed to generate demand in any major way and is a rough starting point for our analysis.\nThis quarter, Nature's Sunshine reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 3.1% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 5.2%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 1.9% over the next 12 months, similar to its three-year rate. This projection is underwhelming and shows the market believes its newer products will not lead to better top-line performance yet.\nCash Is King Although earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can’t use accounting profits to pay the bills.Nature's Sunshine has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last two years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 4%, subpar for a consumer staples business.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Nature's Sunshine’s margin dropped by 2.4 percentage points during that time. If this trend continues, it could signal it’s becoming a more capital-intensive business.\nNature's Sunshine’s free cash flow clocked in at $7.88 million in Q3, equivalent to a 6.9% margin. The company’s cash profitability regressed as it was 2 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, but it’s still above its two-year average. We wouldn’t read too much into this quarter’s decline because investment needs can be seasonal, leading to short-term swings. Long-term trends trump temporary fluctuations.\nKey Takeaways from Nature's Sunshine’s Q3 Results We were impressed by how significantly Nature's Sunshine blew past analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its EBITDA outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its gross margin missed analysts’ expectations. Zooming out, we think this was a good quarter with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 1.9% to $14.06 immediately following the results.",

    "text": "ROME, Dec. 28 (Xinhua) -- Italy has experienced a record-setting number of extreme weather events in 2023, a year that is set to be the warmest in more than 150 years, reports said on Thursday.\nAccording to the climate observatory run by the environmental lobby group Legambiente, Italy reported 378 severe weather events in 2023, an increase of 22 percent compared to last year -- ranging from heatwaves to drought and from hailstorms to floods and extreme winds, which were directly responsible for at least 31 deaths.\nOn the other hand, the agriculture sector union Coldiretti said there were more than nine harsh weather events per day this year across Italy's boot-shaped peninsula.\nIn its report, Coldiretti estimated that extreme weather caused a record 6 billion euros (6.6 billion U.S. dollars) of damages to crops and agricultural infrastructure, leading to shortfalls in the country's production of olive oil, peaches, nectarines and wheat.\nLegambiente said its calculations showed that the northern part of the country was hit the hardest, with 210 separate extreme weather events, followed by 98 in the central regions and 70 in the south which includes the island regions of Sicily and Sardinia.\nAmong the extreme weather events were floods, record high temperatures, rain-triggered landslides and hailstorms, it said.\nMuch of Europe suffered a long and dry summer and multiple severe weather events this year, but Italy is often hit harder due to its long coastline and exposure to the sea on two coasts. Meteorological data indicate that this year is set to be the warmest in more than 150 years of record-keeping in Italy.\nMeanwhile, weather agencies predict the year will end with an unusually warm spell, with high daytime temperatures across much of the Italian peninsula, assuring that 2024 will start out on the warm side.\nOpen Modal ×",

Catecismo da Igreja Católica, n. 2290);\nCONSIDERANDO o Documento CNBB\n100, n. 286 (Paróquia,\nComunidade de comunidades), em que se indica: \"Especialmente nas festas de padroeiros e outros eventos religiosos, a venda de bebidas alcoólicas contrasta com os programas de defesa da vida e combate à drogadição que a Igreja promove.\nUma das drogas mais ameaçadoras da sociedade é o\nálcool. (...) E urgente a conversão das comunidades paroquiais para evitar o contratestemunho de promover o consumo de álcool em quermesses ou outras atividades recreativas da comunidade\";\nCONSIDERANDO a reflexão feita no dia 26 de outubro de 2024, por ocasião da primeira sessão do nosso Sínodo Arquidiocesano, e no dia 11 de fevereiro de 2025, na reunião do clero.\nDETERMINAMOS, por este nosso decreto, que ficam proibidos a venda e o consumo de bebidas alcoólicas nas quermesses e outros eventos organizados e promovidos pelas igrejas, movimentos, pastorais ou serviços no território da Arquidiocese de Olinda e Recife.",

The family discovered the animal and buggy were missing after finishing their shopping at the Sturgis, Mich., store Saturday, according to a Sturgis Police Department release posted on Facebook. A truck driver who was parked at Walmart told police that a woman had stolen the buggy and gave officials a description of her. Police said they had contact with the woman earlier that day at the same Walmart location. Later that night, police said they found the stolen horse and buggy and made contact with the 31-year-old woman at a nearby motel where she was arrested without incident. She was booked at the St. Joseph County Jail on charges of larceny and larceny of livestock pending an arraignment, according to police. The horse was not harmed and the buggy was returned, police said. Sturgis is just over 50 miles northwest of South Bend, Ind.",

Lo ha detto la deputata Maria Chiara Gadda , vicepresidente dei deputati di Italia Viva, illustrando un ordine del giorno al decreto Milleproroghe. “Questa situazione ha reso complesso per le aziende, ad esempio, del Distretto del Cibo dei Salumi DOP Piacentini, l’ottenimento della documentazione richiesta per l’accesso alle agevolazioni e ai finanziamenti previsti dai contratti.

    "title": "Wild crash: Driver arrested after fleeing traffic stop, slamming into truck",
    "text": "A construction crew narrowly escaped the path of a reckless driver, highlighting the tough balance law enforcement faces when deciding whether or not to pursue a fleeing suspect. Cody Nance, 33, of Arkansas was arrested this week in Martin County after deputies said he fled law enforcement at speeds exceeding 100 mph, later crashing near a nighttime construction crew. A video posted on the Martin County Sheriff's Office's Facebook page showed the dramatic end of the pursuit of the driver. \"We had probably as horrific a car chase as you could have, the kind that keeps you up at night in fear that fleeing car would kill an innocent bystander,\" Martin County Sheriff William Snyder said. Chief Deputy John Budensiek said the incident started when a deputy tried to pull over Nance in the Jensen Beach area for a tag issue. Budensiek said Nance took off toward Port St. Lucie driving recklessly at more than 100 mph, leading the deputy on a brief chase, before the deputy was forced to stop pursuing to protect public safety. \"Our deputy, because of our pursuit policy, was forced to terminate the ground pursuit,\" Budensiek said. Budensiek said the sheriff's office helicopter kept following Nance from the sky. Aerial video showed the car getting on the northbound lanes of Interstate 95 near Becker Road going the wrong way, narrowly missing another driver. The car then continued speeding back toward Martin County and headed directly toward the intersection of Martin Highway and Citrus Boulevard in Palm City, where CWR contracting crews were paving the road. \"Our deputies had to reengage in order to stop the vehicle from careening into the construction crews,\" Budensiek said. Budensiek said deputies tried to intercept the car by putting up stop sticks to pop the car's tires before it reached the construction site. Trevor Pearson, a safety specialist with CWR Construction, said he received a call from a deputy warning him to clear out his crews. \"We’re really thankful for the sheriff's department,\" Pearson said. Four minutes after Pearson said crews cleared out, aerial video showed Nance's car hit Stop Sticks, careen off the road and slam into a rented water truck. \"Due to his excessive speed, Nance overcorrected when he hit the stingers and slammed into a water truck while construction workers watched from the side of the road,\" the sheriff's office said. Pearson said multiple workers could have been hit. \"There were probably 10-12 guys working that got to go home that night,\" Pearson told WPTV reporter Kate Hussey. \"Without their response, that might not have been the outcome?\" Hussey asked. \"That's very well possible,\" answered Pearson. Nance got out of the vehicle and was taken into custody by deputies. He was then taken to the hospital with injuries described as not life-threatening. The sheriff's office said he faces charges of fleeing and eluding, driving with a suspended license, petit theft, failure to register a motor vehicle, aggravated fleeing and eluding, and breaking and entering parole violation. None of the work crews or other drivers were injured during the incident. It's perhaps a happy ending to a chase at a time when high-speed police pursuits are a hot topic on the Treasure Coast. In the past year, three high-speed police responses led to the deaths of innocent bystanders. The most recent happened in Stuart last week when a fleeing suspect led a Stuart police officer on a pursuit on U.S. Highway 1. The suspect hit a MARTY Bus, which slammed into another car and killed an innocent driver. Police Chief Joseph Tuminelli told WPTV the officer, so far, appears to have been following protocol, but sat down with Hussey on Tuesday to talk about whether police pursuits are always necessary or appropriate. \"This [latest incident] kind of highlights how, when we follow our pursuit policies, that doesn't mean these criminals are just shutting it down also,\" Budensiek said. \"And had your deputies not re-engaged, this could have been a different scenario,\" Hussey said. \"They're still running at 100 plus mph through our county, continuing to endanger our community,\" agreed Budensiek. Budensiek said it's a tough balance to strike, deciding whether or not to pursue a fleeing suspect. He said while police pursuits often end badly, and always have, with more growth on the Treasure Coast, comes more cars on the road and more opportunity for an innocent bystander to get caught in the crosshairs of a car chase. However, he said letting a fleeing suspect go often isn't the right option either. \"Our No. 1 goal is public safety, however, that looks,\" Budensiek said. \"We have seen that not pursuing suspects only creates more people running here in the county.\" \"Is it safe to say you guys are looking at alternate methods of striking that balance, like your aviation unit?\" Hussey asked. \"We have to strike a balance. We can't just let these guys run from us all the time, but we're also going to be extremely thoughtful in how we catch them,\" Budensiek said. \"We've had enough bad outcomes where we're constantly reminded that this could happen here in Martin County to one of our citizens, one of our family members.\" Budensiek said some of the alternatives the agency is looking at include pursuing with aviation units instead of with patrol cars. He also said using trucks to block the paths of fleeing vehicles is another alternative the agency is now utilizing. Tuminelli told Hussey on Tuesday his department is also looking at potentially utilizing Stop Sticks in the future. Scripps Only Content 2024",

    "text": "OCIO\n'Más tormentas fuertes': Jorge Rey avisa de que la DANA 'no ha terminado'\nLa situación de inestabilidad persiste en varias regiones, y las tormentas aún no han terminado, según las Cabañuelas\nLa borrasca DANA continúa su impacto en España, y, como apunta Jorge Rey, el clima inestable seguirá afectando a diversas zonas del país en los próximos días. Pese a los esfuerzos de los servicios meteorológicos y de emergencia, en muchas áreas se experimenta ya un fuerte desgaste:\n\"Desesperación en Valencia, absoluto caos.\" Los efectos del fenómeno atmosférico se han sentido especialmente en el Levante. Donde las fuertes lluvias han desbordado calles, saturado los sistemas de drenaje y generado situaciones de emergencia en ciudades y poblaciones pequeñas.\nA lo largo de esta semana, las bajas presiones se mantendrán activas en todo el país. Especialmente en las zonas de Valencia, Castellón, Tarragona y otros puntos de la costa mediterránea.\nEsta DANA, bautizada como Orestes, \"no ha terminado\", afirma Jorge Rey. Traerá consigo más lluvias intensas y \"tormentas fuertes\", especialmente en las áreas de Levante y Extremadura.\nJorge Rey pone bajo aviso a varios puntos\nLas previsiones de Jorge Rey señalan que estos días todavía serán complicados. A lo largo de la tarde de hoy, las tormentas y lluvias fuertes se expandirán hacia el sur y el suroeste. Tocando incluso partes de Huelva y Sevilla.\n🔴NO HA TERMINADO: + fuertes tormentas por llegar [DANA ORESTES] ⛈️⛈️⛈️\nA partir del sábado, las precipitaciones se concentrarán en las islas Baleares, alcanzando avisos naranjas en algunas áreas por la intensidad de los chubascos. Mientras tanto, el fenómeno de bajas presiones avanza hacia Aragón y Levante. Dejando avisos naranjas y lluvias que persistirán a lo largo del fin de semana.\nLluvias y avisos para el fin de semana en todo el Levante\nEn el Levante, localidades como Valencia, Castellón y Tarragona seguirán siendo las más afectadas por esta ola lluviosa y tormentosa. El fenómeno ha generado lluvias de hasta 120 litros por metro cuadrado en algunas áreas de Tarragona. Lo cual ha derivado en acumulaciones de agua y serios problemas para el tráfico y la movilidad en estas zonas.\nJorge Rey recomienda mantenerse al tanto de la previsión meteorológica, ya que el riesgo puede aumentar en intervalos de pocas horas.\nQué nos espera en los próximos días: Jorge Rey lo dice\nDe acuerdo con Jorge Rey, las lluvias continuarán moderadamente en algunas partes del sur de Cataluña, el valle del Ebro y Murcia a inicios de la próxima semana. Aunque la DANA perderá fuerza a medida que avanzan los días.\nEl lunes, la DANA se presentará más desgastada. Lo que permitirá ver un clima más estable y menos lluvias en comparación con los días previos. Sin embargo, se esperan algunos chubascos débiles en el valle del Ebro y en partes del suroeste español.\nPara aquellos que residen en los lugares más afectados, el pronóstico sugiere que el tiempo no se calmará de inmediato.
