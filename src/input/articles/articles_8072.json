    "text": " Notícias > Brasil > Praça Santa Suzana, no Morumbi, sofre com abandono Praça Santa Suzana, no Morumbi, sofre com abandono Subprefeitura do Butantã afirma que local recebe os serviços de zeladoria sempre que necessário e que uma vistoria constatou que, no momento, não há necessidade de novos reparos\nPor Jovem Pan 06/06/2024 18h30 - Atualizado em 06/06/2024 18h35 Reprodução/Jovem Pan News\nFrequentadores reclamaram das condições da Praça Santa Suzana, que fica no bairro do Morumbi\nMoradores e frequentadores da Praça Santa Suzana, situada na região nobre do Morumbi , em São Paulo, estão levantando a voz contra o abandono do espaço público. A praça, que serve como local de lazer para uma diversa gama de pessoas, incluindo idosos, donos de pets, crianças e jovens atletas, encontra-se em um estado lamentável de manutenção e limpeza. A situação chegou ao conhecimento público através de uma denúncia enviada por um telespectador ao e-mail da Jovem Pan , motivando uma investigação jornalística sobre as condições do local. Ao visitar a praça , a reportagem se deparou com uma cena de descaso. As quadras esportivas, um dos principais atrativos do local, apresentavam-se em condições precárias, necessitando urgentemente de reparos. Além disso, o mato alto, as telas de proteção danificadas e até mesmo uma cesta de basquete quebrada compunham o cenário de negligência. Um jovem entrevistado pela equipe expressou sua frustração com a falta de infraestrutura adequada para a prática de esportes, ressaltando a dificuldade de utilizar o espaço devido ao estado de abandono.\nSiga o canal da Jovem Pan News e receba as principais notícias no seu WhatsApp! WhatsApp Em resposta às reclamações dos moradores, a Subprefeitura do Butantã informou que a Praça Santa Suzana recebe os serviços de zeladoria sempre que necessário, seguindo o cronograma de trabalho da administração regional. Na manhã da última terça-feira (4), foi realizada uma vistoria e constatado que, no momento, não há necessidade de novos serviços de zeladoria. A administração regional também destacou que será feita uma análise de projeto para a reforma dos equipamentos da praça. A população tem sempre à disposição o Portal 156, para solicitação dos serviços municipais, por meio de site , aplicativo SP156 e via central de atendimento telefônico no número 156.\n*Com informações do repórter e produtor Luiz Guerra\nLeia também Blocos de carnaval se manifestam neste domingo contra privatização da Sabesp Maior parada LGBTQIA+ do mundo convida participantes a usarem verde e amarelo na Avenida Paulista",

    "title": "Maximize Early Game Success in No Man's Sky: Inventory and Resource Guide",
    "text": "Quick Links\nKey Takeaways\n- Repair your ship on a hospitable planet with ample resources to thrive.\n- Stockpile essentials like Carbon and Ferrite Dust for a smoother early game.\n- Enhance your exosuit, seek upgrades, and maximize inventory efficiency.\nEmbarking on your journey in\nNo Man's Sky can be a daunting yet exhilarating experience. The vast universe filled with uncharted planets and diverse ecosystems is your playground. But before you can traverse the stars in your spaceship, you have some groundwork to lay— literally. This guide is tailored to help you navigate the initial stages of the game, focusing on essential resource gathering, upgrading your exosuit for better inventory management, and ensuring a smoother gameplay experience.\nGetting Off the Ground\nAs you embark on your journey, you find yourself stranded on an unknown planet with a damaged spaceship. Your first challenge is to repair the ship so that you can continue your adventure. This initial phase of the game is meant to teach you the basics of gathering resources and crafting items. However, the actual game begins once you have successfully fixed your ship and taken off towards the unknown.\nIt is important to note that not all planets are hospitable. Therefore, it's essential to prioritize finding a more temperate world within the same system. Be careful to avoid planets with aggressive sentinels at all costs, as they will make your early game much more complicated than necessary. With your survival skills put to the test on this random planet, it's time to gear up and take on the universe!\nResource Round-Up\nOn your chosen planet, your primary focus should be accumulating a hefty resource stash. Aim for over 5000 units of Carbon and Ferrite Dust and around 2000 units of Oxygen and Sodium. Here's where to find them:\n- Carbon is abundant in plant life. Use your scanner to identify carbon-rich flora.\n- Ferrite Dust is common in rocks scattered across the landscape.\n- Oxygen is found in distinctive red or bulbous plants that release oxygen pods when approached.\n- Sodium is found in yellow plants and a secondary element in many resources.\nNot all planets have equal amounts of plant life, so you can always find another planet if the one you found isn't cutting it.\n[\n](/no-mans-sky-best-ways-to-get-nanites/)\nWhere can you find the elusive secondary currency?\n[\nNo Man’s Sky: Best Ways to Get Nanites\n](/no-mans-sky-best-ways-to-get-nanites/)\nThe Art of Exploration\nAs you embark on your journey across the vast planet, stay vigilant and look for any structures that might interest you. However, it is critical to approach them with caution, especially if they are heavily guarded by sentinels or surrounded by ominous features like tentacles. These are usually clear signs that the area may be dangerous or off-limits.\nThat said, there are still plenty of opportunities to discover valuable resources and upgrades by exploring safer buildings and interacting with the machinery you find along the way. Encrypted navigation charts are also worth seeking out, as they can provide you with vital information on the planet's geography and help you navigate your way to new locations with ease.\nSo, as you continue to explore the planet, remember to keep an open mind, stay alert to potential dangers, and take advantage of any opportunities that come your way. With a little bit of caution and a lot of curiosity, you are sure to uncover some truly amazing discoveries on your journey (like ancient relics and knowledge stones, which are incredibly beneficial when you want to trade with the locals).\nA Detour to the Anomaly\nAfter completing the initial tasks, you will come across a place called the Anomaly. The Anomaly serves as a hub for upgrades and essential purchases. It is crucial to unlock the Carbon Nanotube blueprint to be able to make future upgrades. You may need to search for more Nanites either within the Anomaly or on the surfaces of different planets to unlock the blueprint.\nRefining and Upgrading\nYou will need to use your refiner to convert the sodium you have collected into sodium nitrate. This process will prove quite helpful later on. Once you have completed this task, return to the space station and trade in your encrypted charts for exosuit upgrade maps. These maps will be your key to unlocking a significant expansion of your inventory slots through drop pods located across the various planets. This will allow you to carry more items and resources as you explore the universe.\nThe Drop Pod Grind\nTo make the most of your planetary exploration, locating and traveling to the drop pods on your chosen planet is important. These pods contain valuable inventory slot upgrades but require unlocking repairs. You can use the maps available to find the drop pods and plan your route accordingly.\nTo maximize your inventory space, we recommend that you focus on unlocking four rows of upgrades. This will significantly alleviate the notorious inventory constraints that hamper your exploration and resource gathering. By having more inventory slots available, you'll be able to carry more resources, artifacts, and other items that you come across on your journey.\nInventory Management: A Key to Success\nExpanding your exosuit's inventory in the early stages of the game might seem like a tedious task, but it can make a significant difference. It allows you to carry more resources, upgrades, and valuable items, making every game aspect more accessible and enjoyable. It's essential to resist the temptation to splurge on upgrades at this stage, as your top priority should be to increase your inventory space.\nLooking Ahead\nProper management of your inventory is a crucial aspect of playing the game successfully. When you manage your inventory in an effective way, you will have greater freedom and capability when completing quests. It is important to note that inventory management can be a time-consuming and tedious task, especially when you are starting out and have limited space. However, putting in the effort to grind for more inventory space early on can pay off significantly in the long run, as it can prevent the common problem of unexpectedly running out of space, and avoid the frustration of having to leave items behind or dropping them on the ground.\nEyes to the Sky, Explorer\nNo Man's Sky is an incredibly vast game that offers an infinite number of possibilities and exploration opportunities to the player. To make the most out of this experience, it's essential to focus on your inventory capacity early on in the game. This will help you avoid frustration and enjoy a more seamless and rewarding journey through the universe.\nBuilding a solid foundation for your inventory may require some patience and effort, but it will be worth it in the long run. You will have more room to carry the resources and equipment you need to navigate the galaxy, discover new planets, and interact with the various alien species you encounter along the way.\nWith a well-planned approach to your inventory management, you will find that the universe of No Man's Sky becomes a little more navigable and less daunting. You will have fewer interruptions and more time to appreciate the wonders and surprises that await you in this vast and beautiful game world.\nSo, get ready to embark on this journey with a plan, and don't forget to enjoy the process. Happy exploring, interloper!\n[\n](/no-mans-sky-how-to-build-a-starship/)",

    "text": "Despite headwinds, EV sales are up in the US for Q3 2024. Automakers sold 346,309 EVs in the US. Cheap lease deals are likely one reason EV sales are rising. If you want to understand the current state of electric vehicles, just look at General Motors and Mercedes-Benz. EV sales were up for the American automaker , with the new Equinox EV accounting for nearly a third of GM's Q3 EV sales. Blazer EV sales were also up, and a cheaper Silverado EV and a new Bolt are still on the way.\nMercedes wasn't as lucky, with the automaker witnessing the sales for its three EVs—the EQB, the EQE, and the EQS— fall by 42 percent from Q3 2023 to Q3 2024 . The Porsche Taycan faced a similar beating over the first nine months of the year, with sales down 50 percent globally for the model . This year, they have fallen from 5,212 to 3,394 in the US.\nDespite all that, EV sales grew 11 percent last quarter in America compared to the previous year, with an estimated 346,309 EVs sold, according to Cox Automotive . They rose 5 percent from Q2 to Q3 and accounted for a record-high 8.9 percent of new car sales last quarter.\nAutomakers offering more affordable models has helped boost sales, but so have cheap leases and higher-than-average incentives—12.29 percent of the average EV transaction price versus 7.1 percent for the rest of the industry.\nCox Automotive also pointed to the \"leasing loophole\" that gives customers more government incentives to lease rather than outright buy, causing lease rates for electric vehicles to react as you'd expect. According to the publication's data, leases made up 42.7 percent of EV sales as of July 2024 after starting a steady rise in early 2023. That's nearly double the industry average of 22 percent.\nBuyers can still find plenty of good lease deals right now. Some are as low as $99 a month with a few thousand dollars down. The down payments aren't cheap, but the math still works out to well below the average monthly new car payment—averaging over $700. The price is a huge motivator for people, especially those less certain about EV technology who want to test it without the commitment.\nPorsche The growing market of EVs, including more affordable models, has led to two of the poorest states leading the country in EV adoption. According to a recent iSeeCars study, Arkansas is the number two for growth over the last five years, with EVs accounting for 5.6 percent of the state's market share. Louisiana was number three, though EVs only make up 0.8 percent of the market there. But it's growing.\nThose who buy an EV outright will likely face a lower resale value as these leases return to dealers, but maybe that's what the technology needs. Range and charging infrastructure are no longer the top concerns for potential buyers— the cost of replacing the battery is bigger , but not by much.\nPutting more EVs on the road, leased or bought, should only increase demand for a more extensive and reliable charging network. Maybe automakers should lean into leases to push EV sales over the magical 10-percent threshold. That should lead to mass adoption and help push prices even lower.\nOf course, that'll only work if EV buyers don’t switch back to gas .\nIt's All About Price:\nPricing for the Electric Dodge Charger Is Official.

    "text": "El descenso de las precipitaciones y el aumento de las temperaturas sufridos en los últimos años llevaron a la declaración de la emergencia hídrica en Tenerife en mayo de 2024, una situación que ha sufrido ya dos prórrogas. Para paliar los efectos de esta sequía, el Ayuntamiento de Santa Cruz tomó la delantera, a través de políticas de mejora y digitalización en la eficiencia del ciclo integral del agua del municipio.\nEstas iniciativas se enmarcan dentro del Programa Estratégico de Recuperación y Transformación Económica (PERTE) para la digitalización del ciclo integral del agua de Santa Cruz de Tenerife, que el Consistorio puso en marcha el verano pasado gracias a la colaboración de la Empresa Mixta de Aguas (Emmasa), perteneciente al Grupo Sacyr. Entre las acciones que incluye el ambicioso proyecto, que ya se está ejecutando, destaca la implantación de la telelectura en el 70% del parque de contadores del municipio que, además de lograr un consumo de agua potable más sostenible, consciente y eficiente, logrará disminuir en 2.867 toneladas las emisiones de CO .\nEl alcalde, José Manuel Bermúdez, asegura que el Ayuntamiento mantiene un firme compromiso con el desarrollo de proyectos innovadores que permitan ligar a la ciudad con la sostenibilidad y la tecnología. “El programa cuenta con 22 acciones encaminadas a aprovechar los avances tecnológicos para mejorar la gestión del ciclo del agua, aumentar su eficiencia y reducir las pérdidas en las redes de consumo, para así adaptarse a las necesidades de la población”, sostiene. Además, añade que “al mismo tiempo, se busca responder a las demandas de nuestro planeta ligadas a una mayor eficiencia y eficacia de los procesos en este momento de sequía”.\nEn este sentido, el primer teniente de alcalde y concejal de Servicios Públicos, Carlos Tarife, incide en que Santa Cruz es “un municipio que avanza constantemente en la toma de decisiones relacionadas con el cuidado medioambiental y, en este caso, contra la emergencia hídrica”. De esta manera, explica que, para ello, se están implementando sistemas de medición inteligente del consumo con más capacidad de telemando y telecontrol.\nEl proyecto ya ha ejecutado la mitad de las acciones programadas y estará finalizado en mayo de 2026 En esa línea, el PERTE también incluye el monitoreo y control de vertidos en tiempo real, que permite la detección precoz de las fugas, lo que resulta imprescindible a la hora de prevenir desperdicios de este recurso escaso y fundamental para la vida.\nLa digitalización de operaciones relacionadas con el ciclo integral del agua de Santa Cruz permite, según explica el concejal, “ofrecer datos actualizados del consumo que posibilitan una gestión aún más transparente, al tiempo que propician un consumo mucho más responsable, ya que los vecinos y vecinas podrán conocer sus hábitos de consumo y racionalizarlos”.\nPara continuar avanzando en este reto, Emmasa está ejecutando ahora mismo medidas como la instalación de sensores de nivel y calidad de agua en la red de alcantarillado, pluviómetros o sondas multiparamétricas de calidad del agua, entre otras. Por otra parte, en enero de este año se comenzó a desarrollar un estudio de investigación con la cátedra BIG DATA de la Universidad de La Laguna con la intención de evaluar la relación de variables monitorizadas tras la implantación del proyecto.\nEn este momento, el proyecto se encuentra en el meridiano de su desarrollo. Ya se han puesto en marcha más de la mitad de las acciones programadas y se prevé que se finalice su ejecución en el mes de mayo de 2026.\nEl PERTE cuenta con un presupuesto total de nueve millones de euros, de los que 5,55 millones corresponden a la subvención concedida por el Ministerio de Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico, a través de los fondos europeos Next Generation, y los 3,45 millones restantes corresponden a fondos propios de Emmasa.\nTodas estas medidas colocan a Santa Cruz en una posición aventajada en la lucha contra esta crisis hídrica, que persiste en la actualidad pese al incremento de la capacidad de las balsas con las lluvias de los últimos meses.",
