    "text": "By Carol A. Gasser Moore |\nATLANTA — Federal authorities on August 11, 2025 , announced a major disruption operation that dismantled BlackSuit (formerly Royal) ransomware infrastructure — seizing four servers, nine domains and roughly $1.09 million in virtual currency through coordinated efforts by the Justice Department, DHS, FBI, IRS-CI and international partners.\nCritical Georgia connections emerge :\nIn Henry County, Georgia , the BlackSuit group hit the school system in early November 2023 , forcing the entire district offline and compromising a file storage area. The breach affected historical and procedural documents, though student information, HR, financial and email systems were spared. School officials, along with the FBI, DHS and state and local authorities, gradually restored network access, Chromebooks and core services while resetting passwords and investigating further. A significant data breach also struck an Atlanta‑based company— Young Consulting , now known as Connexure . In April 2024 , BlackSuit infiltrated its systems between April 10 and 13, exfiltrating sensitive data for more than 954,000 individuals —including names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, insurance claims and policy details. In July 2025 , the tally of affected individuals exceeded 1 million , as confirmed in a regulatory filing. The company continues to offer credit monitoring and identity protection services to victims. What this signals for Georgia\nThese incidents underscore the broad impact of the BlackSuit gang within Georgia’s education and business sectors. The type of targets—from K‑12 infrastructure to healthcare‑related software providers—highlights ransomware’s growing reach across public and private domains.\nAs of Aug. 2025 , the criminal group is believed to have compromised over 450 U.S. organizations , including those in education, healthcare, energy, and public safety, extracting roughly $370 million in cryptocurrency before the recent takedown.\nLooking ahead , while the disruption effort dealt a meaningful blow to BlackSuit’s operations, authorities caution that the gang’s significant illicit earnings may enable future resurgence. Georgia institutions are advised to heighten cybersecurity resilience—including multifactor authentication, regular backups, privileged access restrictions, and incident response planning.",

    "text": "GAZA STRIP, Palestinian Territories — Mediators pushed on with efforts for an Hamas-Israel ceasefire as fighting raged on in the besieged Gaza Strip on Thursday, deepening a dire humanitarian crisis. The Qatar-based leader of Hamas Ismail Haniyeh was expected in Cairo on Thursday or Friday for talks on a proposed truce.\nThe group was reviewing a proposal for a six-week pause in its war with Israel, a Hamas source told AFP, after mediators gathered in Paris.\nIn Gaza, there was no let-up in fighting or aerial bombardment, with the current focus of combat in Khan Yunis, where Israel says leading Hamas fighters are hiding.\nOvernight, witnesses said several Israeli air strikes hit the city, while aid and health workers have for days reported heavy fighting, particularly around two hospitals.\nAccording to the health ministry in Gaza, 119 people were killed in the latest night of strikes.\n\"There is a massacre taking place right now,\" said Leo Cans of international aid group Doctors Without Borders.\nIsrael accuses Hamas of operating from tunnels under hospitals in Gaza and of using medical facilities as command centres, a charge denied by the Islamist group, which is designated a “terrorist” organisation by the European Union and the United States.\nDue to constraints on the delivery of humanitarian aid, the population is “starving to death”, the World Health Organisation’s Emergencies Director Michael Ryan said on Wednesday.\n“The civilians of Gaza are not parties to this conflict and they should be protected, as should be their health facilities,” he added.\nIn its latest update, the UN reported heavy bombardment across the Gaza Strip, particularly in Khan Yunis, while it said 184,000 more Palestinians from the city had registered to receive humanitarian assistance after fleeing their homes in recent days.\nThree-stage plan\nAs Qatari and Egyptian-led mediation efforts intensified, Haniyeh was due in Cairo to discuss a truce proposal thrashed out in Paris last weekend with CIA chief William Burns.\nA Hamas source told AFP the three-stage plan would start with an initial six-week halt to the fighting that would see more aid deliveries into the Gaza Strip.\nOnly “women, children and sick men over 60” held by Hamas fighters would be freed during that stage in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel, the source said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks.\nThere would also be “negotiations around the withdrawal of Israeli forces”, with possible additional phases involving more hostage-prisoner exchanges, said the source, adding that Gaza’s rebuilding was also among issues addressed by the deal.\nFollowing the deadliest attack in Israel’s history on October 7, its military launched a withering air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 26,900 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.\nThe UN Conference on Trade and Development said tens of billions of dollars would be required to rebuild Gaza, which “currently is uninhabitable” as half its structures are damaged or destroyed.\nAid access\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out withdrawing troops from Gaza and has repeatedly vowed to destroy Hamas in response to the October 7 surprise attack.\nNetanyahu has also opposed releasing “thousands” of Palestinian prisoners as part of any deal.\nWith scores of Israeli hostages still trapped in Gaza, there has been mounting criticism of Netanyahu’s government that has triggered street protests and calls for an early election.\nFor people in Gaza, access to aid has been further hampered by a controversy surrounding the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, after Israel accused several of its staff of involvement in the Hamas attack.\nThe claims last week saw several donor countries, led by key Israel ally the United States, freeze funding for the agency.\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres told a UN committee he had “met with donors to listen to their concerns and to outline the steps we are taking”.\nUNRWA spokeswoman Tamara Alrifai told AFP the agency supports “an independent investigation” into the Israeli claims that led to the funding crisis.\nNetanyahu told a meeting of UN ambassadors in Jerusalem that UNRWA had been “totally infiltrated” by Hamas and called for other agencies to replace it.\nThe US State Department has said 12 UNRWA employees “may have been involved” out of 13,000 in Gaza and has said that it is “imperative” that the agency continue its “absolutely indispensable role”.\nThe war’s impact has been felt widely, with violence involving Iran-backed allies of Hamas across the Middle East surging since October and drawing in US forces among others.\nThe White House blamed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of pro-Iran armed groups, for a drone attack that killed three US soldiers at a base in Jordan on the northeastern borders with Syria.",

    "title": "US Navy Apologizing to Alaska Natives for 1800s Bombardments | Newsmax.com",
    "text": "By Sandy Fitzgerald | Thursday, 19 September 2024 03:33 PM EDT The U.S. Navy this weekend will issue the first of its formal apologies to native communities in Alaska for the assaults on two villages in the 1800s, when its ships bombarded homes, burning dwellings and food stores shortly after the United States bought the Alaskan territory from Russia in 1867. The Navy is to issue the first of two apologies to the Lingít (also known as Tlingit), communities for the assaults on Kake in 1869 and Angoon 13 years later, with the message to be delivered by Rear Adm. Mark Sucato, a senior officer who oversees the Navy's Alaskan shore presence, reported The Washington Post. The U.S. military does not often apologize to Native populations for the actions taken against their people. That may be changing, with the apology to the Alaskans and Pentagon now reviewing dozens of commendations awarded for actions of soldiers in the Wounded Knee massacre in 1890, where soldiers slaughtered nearly 300 Lakota men, women, and children. The Navy said in a statement that its \"wrongful actions\" against the Alaskan villages inflicted \"multigenerational trauma.\" The \"pain and suffering inflicted upon the Tlingit people warrants these long overdue apologies,\" spokeswoman Julianne Leinenveber said. Community leaders from the islands, located south of Juneau, said the gesture is welcomed, but enduring challenges continue. Garfield George, the housemaster of Deishú Hít, or End of the Trail House, is known as Kaaxooutch. He will help lead the ceremony in Angoon on Oct. 26 to commemorate the attack's 142nd anniversary, and said the apology will \"mean a lot.\" He added that it will correct the record about what what he called exaggerations and lies about the attacks that have held on for years. The official military accounts made it sound \"like we deserved what happened to us and that's just not true,\" George said. The Lingíts and other local tribes trace their lineage to the Alaskan panhandle as far back as 10,000 years. But when the Alaskan territory was sold to the United States, tensions rose between the American soldiers and the natives after a sentry at the military's fort in Sitka killed two unarmed Lingít men. One of the clan's leaders demanded blankets and goods in exchange for the deaths, in accordance with local customs, but when the American commanders refused, the Lingít captured four fur traders, killing two. The USS Saginaw, dispatched by the Army that February, fired on the village of Kake, with troops then going ashore to torch its buildings. Joel Jackson, the president of the Organized Village of Kake, said has not been determined if the village will accept the Navy's apology. \"It's a start of what they need to do to help us heal our people, but by no means can it erase what they did,\" he commented. The U.S. Army is in talks with local leaders to apologize for a separate assault that destroyed another Lingít village, Wrangell, spokesman Matt Ahearn said, deferring questions about Kake to the Navy. Meanwhile, 13 years later, an explosion on a whaling ship killed a medicine man named Til'xtlein from Angoon. The village demanded 200 blankets, a payment \"equal to his stature.\" However, E.C. Merriman, the commander of the U.S. forces, rejected their appeal for the blankets, demanding twice as many from Angoon and threatening to destroy the village if they were not delivered by the next day. When that did not happen, Merriman ordered the village to be bombarded. Angoon got a $90,000 settlement from the Department of the Interior in 1973, but never an apology until now.

    "text": "Interni 25 Maggio 2024 - 06:00 Dopo il sermone di venerdì scorso e le proteste, il rettore di Torino fa saltare la preghiera dell'imam Ascolta ora: \"\" Troppo impegnati a invocare la laicità della scuola quando si trattava di rimuovere i crocifissi dalle aule o impedire a Benedetto XVI di parlare a La Sapienza, hanno finito per trasformare le università italiane in moschee. Dopo la preghiera islamica e il sermone svolto venerdì scorso dall'imam Brahim Baya all'Università di Torino, ieri lo stesso imam ha dato appuntamento al Politecnico di Torino per la «preghiera del venerdì» con un invito raffigurante una moschea su cui sventolava la bandiera palestinese e una piazza occupata dalle persone in preghiera. Non appena si è diffusa la notizia di una nuova preghiera islamica da svolgersi in un'università italiana è arrivata la richiesta di diffida dal rettore del Politecnico di Torino Stefano Paolo Corgnati: «In pieno coordinamento con la ministra dell'Università e della Ricerca Anna Maria Bernini, venuto a conoscenza dell'annuncio di svolgimento della preghiera islamica del venerdì presso la sede centrale del Politecnico, ha immediatamente provveduto a inviare richiesta al Prefetto e al Questore di Torino di diffida dallo svolgere funzioni e attività presso le sedi dell'Ateneo nei confronti delle autorità religiose eventualmente coinvolte». Così è arrivato il divieto a svolgere la preghiera, una decisione che ha portato l'Imam ad affermare: «C'è una islamofobia da parte del governo, passando per l'università e i giornalisti. Trovo questa decisione incostituzionale e contro i principi di libertà religiosa della nostra Costituzione». Silvia Sardone, candidata della Lega alle elezioni Europee, ha provato a girare un video al di fuori dell'Università. Il fine era quello di spiegare quanto accaduto con il sermone. Ma l'esponente del Carroccio è stata insultata e non solo, tanto che i deputati torinesi della Lega parlano di una vera e propria aggressione da parte degli studenti. Comunque, visto che l'imam tira in ballo la Costituzione, di sicuro non rispetta i principi costituzionali né la legge inneggiare alla Jihad e alla guerra santa in un'università occupata come avvenuto giovedì con un sermone in cui Baya ha parlato di: «Un jihad che vediamo in Palestina nella sua più importante più palese manifestazione. Un jihad compiuto da donne, da uomini da bambini». D'altro canto l'imam in questione, dal 7 ottobre in avanti, attacca Israele e, solo pochi giorni fa, parlava dal palco del Salone del libro di Torino di «stato paria». Il suo sermone ha suscitato la dura reazione del Ministro dell'Università Anna Maria Bernini che ha chiesto un'immediata presa di distanze al rettore dell'Università di Torino che in una nota ha espresso: «piena condanna dell'accaduto» rimarcando «il carattere di laicità dell'istituzione universitaria». Lo stesso rettore di UniTO Stefano Guena in un'intervista a la Stampa si è però lasciato andare a dichiarazioni molto meno nette affermando: «L'imam in facoltà? Chi occupa fa entrare e intervenire chi vuole» salvo poi annunciare che lunedì terminerà l'occupazione e invitare l'imam «ad asternersi in futuro da altre iniziative» analoghe. Per il capogruppo di FdI alla Camera Tommaso Foti è «inaccettabile un ateneo trasformato in Moschea» Anche la comunità ebraica parla di un fatto «gravissimo». Negli ultimi giorni nelle università italiane stiamo infatti assistendo a un salto di qualità; la protesta contro Israele con posizioni antisioniste (e spesso antisemite) si è trasformata in un aperto elogio all'islam, prima con l'occupazione del rettorato dell'Università di Torino annunciata con la kefiah in testa, la bandiera palestinese e la scenografia da video islamico, poi con la preghiera nell'androne dell'ateneo.Una cosa è certa: nel 2007 ci fu un appello firmato da 67 docenti de la Sapienza per impedire a Benedetto XVI di parlare, un'onta che l'università italiana si porterà per sempre dietro, oggi non leggeremo nessun appello per impedire che gli atenei si trasformino in una moschea. L'odio per l'Occidente passa anche da qui. netiquette . Qui le norme di comportamento per esteso.",

    "title": "I “dupes”, le copie cinesi di design, allontanano dalle griffe le persone attente al budget",
    "text": "Numerosi articoli che sono quasi delle copie perfette di alcuni dei capi essenziali della moda più popolari al mondo, dai leggings per lo yoga di Lululemon Athletica Inc. alle borse di Hermès International SCA, stanno comparendo negli armadi di tutta la Cina a una frazione del loro prezzo intero.\nGuarda la sfilata Bottega Veneta - Autunno-Inverno 2024/25 - Womenswear - Milano - ©Launchmetrics/spotlight\nQuesti prodotti sono conosciuti in cinese come \"pingti\" e nel gergo dello shopping della Gen Z come \"dupes\". La loro popolarità riflette una reazione negativa contro i marchi tra gli acquirenti cinesi, che un tempo amavano le etichette. Ma non sono nemmeno da considerare delle contraffazioni di basso valore: i produttori locali vendono questi articoli a prezzi relativamente alti promettendo la stessa qualità dei migliori marchi globali, solo che non hanno i loghi.\nPer esempio, spiccano articoli come un soprabito in tweed a spina di pesce da 3.200 yuan (450 dollari) del produttore di abbigliamento alla moda Chicjoc, che afferma di essere realizzato con tessuti italiani ottenuti da un fornitore di Prada SpA e Bottega Veneta .\nPubblicità Le vendite di prodotti simili sono salite alle stelle dall'anno scorso, in quanto i consumatori cinesi cercano un migliore rapporto qualità/prezzo in un periodo di fiducia vacillante nell’economia. Nei 12 mesi conclusi a luglio, alcuni dei principali marchi locali che vendono alternative più economiche agli articoli somiglianti ai grandi brand hanno registrato una crescita delle loro vendite a due o tre cifre percentuali sulle piattaforme di e-commerce dominanti in Cina, Taobao e Tmall di Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., come mostrano i dati della società di analisi Hangzhou Zhiyi Technology Co. Allo stesso tempo, alcuni dei marchi stranieri emulati da tali prodotti hanno registrato una crescita più lenta, o persino dei cali nelle vendite sulle medesime piattaforme, secondo i dati.\nSebbene le vendite online non rappresentino il quadro completo della situazione per i marchi stranieri che possiedono dei negozi fisici, l'ascesa vertiginosa dei dupes è l'ultima minaccia che devono affrontare i giganti globali della vendita al dettaglio, che non riescono a comprendere cosa esattamente vogliano gli acquirenti cinesi. Il rallentamento economico sta rendendo i consumatori dell’ex Impero Celeste più parsimoniosi, ma anche marchi di fascia media come Nike Inc. e Uniqlo di Fast Retailing Co. stanno subendo dei rallentamenti nei propri giri d’affari. Invece, l'ascesa dei pingti riflette probabilmente ciò che Uniqlo ha definito “un nuovo insieme di valori per i consumatori”, lo stesso istinto che spinge le persone a cercare articoli che siano venduti direttamente dai produttori, eliminando gli intermediari dei marchi.\n“La comprensione dei beni di lusso da parte dei consumatori cinesi sta cambiando, perché la mentalità tradizionale secondo cui una borsa di lusso può segnalare uno status di prestigio sociale non è più la loro unica preferenza”, ha affermato Blair Zhang, analista senior di lusso e moda presso Mintel a Shanghai. “Con le attuali tendenze di spesa, volte alla cautela, non c'è più una cieca fiducia nei marchi noti. Invece, ci sono decisioni di acquisto più razionali, che stimolano discussioni attive su alternative maggiormente economiche”.\nL'impatto più grande determinato dai pingti potrebbe essere sul settore del lusso, che ha subito un duro colpo in Cina, in quanto proliferano degli articoli facsimile che utilizzano materiali e lavorazioni di qualità molto vicina agli originali, ma senza esibire loghi o marchi. I duplicati stanno influenzando l'esclusività che ha reso gli articoli di alta gamma così desiderabili e potrebbero danneggiare la loro futura crescita in Cina, ha affermato la società di consulenza Yaok Group in un rapporto rilasciato questo mese.\nIl produttore di pelletteria Sitoy Group Holdings Ltd. afferma nei propri video sui social media che la qualità delle sue borse da 100 dollari è quasi identica a quelle vendute per oltre 1.000 dollari quando vengono sfornate dalle stesse linee manifatturiere che producono per clienti di marchi di lusso come Prada, Tumi e Michael Kors .\nNel frattempo Chicjoc, uno dei più grandi marchi cinesi di abbigliamento fashion su Taobao e Tmall, commercializza prodotti che afferma essere realizzati con pelliccia animale prodotta a Copenaghen dallo stesso fornitore di LVMH e Fendi . L'azienda ha vendite annuali di circa 1 miliardo di yuan nel suo negozio su Taobao, mostrano i dati di Zhiyi.\nL'analista di Shenzhen Ding Xiaoying ha smesso di spendere migliaia di dollari in marchi di stilisti dopo che l’arretramento del mercato cinese ha dimezzato i suoi bonus annuali. Negli ultimi mesi, il professionista ha affermato di aver acquistato versioni pingti di pigiami e camicie Victoria's Secret ispirate ad articoli di Ralph Lauren Co. e articoli di Bottega Veneta, brand parte del gruppo Kering SA.\n“Ho spostato parte della mia spesa per l'abbigliamento su quei marchi senza loghi”, ha confermato, elogiando la qualità tessile dei duplicati. “Ora mi fido [di quei produttori] e vorrei persino che realizzassero dei loro progetti per evitare di essere citati in giudizio come imitatori”.\nI marchi locali vendono alternative più economiche da decenni, ma sono stati generalmente derisi dagli acquirenti della classe media, che hanno speso soldi in marchi identificati come status symbol. I rivenditori pingti sono entrati nel mainstream quando i prolungati lockdown per la pandemia di Covid hanno tenuto le persone a casa, facendole diventare maggiormente dipendenti dallo shopping online, dando vita a nuovi canali diretti al cliente sulle piattaforme dei social media e a show in live streaming simili a quelli che trasmette internazionalmente l’emittente di shopping domestico americana QVC .\nOnline i consumatori trovano soprattutto articoli pingti e tante volte arrivano addirittura a vantarsi nel condividere sui social di aver scoperto per primi quegli articoli che hanno la somiglianza più vicina ai prodotti di marca. Milioni di video sui social media mostrano vlogger che si vantano di prezzi e qualità. Solitamente gli acquirenti possono effettuare ordini direttamente nelle caselle di chat e ricevere gli articoli entro pochi giorni.\nPer Sitoy, uno dei più importanti rivenditori di dupes , e uno dei pochi ad essere quotati in Borsa, i marchi privati ​​hanno contribuito per quasi un terzo dei circa 841 milioni di dollari di Hong Kong (108 milioni di dollari) sulle sue vendite totali durante i sei mesi conclusisi lo scorso dicembre. I due principali negozi di Sitoy sul cugino cinese di TikTok, Douyin, hanno registrato circa 200 milioni di yuan di vendite negli ultimi 12 mesi terminati a fine luglio, più del doppio rispetto all'anno precedente, secondo i dati di Zhiyi.\nSitoy, che ha iniziato come produttore contoterzista per clienti esterni, ha visto rallentare gli ordini durante la fase centrale dell'incertezza economica e geopolitica, si legge in vari report finanziari. Per contrastare tale calo, sta investendo in dupes , trasformando un edificio di quattro piani nella sua fabbrica nella città meridionale di Dongguan in un centro di e-commerce per i propri marchi, completo di studi di live streaming, negozi al dettaglio e showroom.\nProdurre articoli per marchi globali “non è qualcosa di cui vantarsi”, afferma una donna in un video aziendale di vendita pubblicato su Douyin. “Quindi abbiamo deciso di andare in prima linea, utilizzando lo stesso livello di materiali e artigianalità dei marchi di lusso, e gli stessi lavoratori esperti, per creare i nostri marchi nazionali”.\nSitoy, Chicjoc, Chando, VFU, Hermès, Lululemon, Prada, la società madre di Tumi, Samsonite International SA, il proprietario di Michael Kors, Capri Holdings Ltd., e la società madre di SK-II, Procter & Gamble Co., non hanno risposto alle nostre richieste di commento.\nLa maggior parte dei consumatori sostiene che ci sia poca o nessuna differenza tra i pingti e gli articoli di marca che imitano. Un flacone da 330 millilitri del bestseller “Facial Treatment Essence” del produttore di cosmetici giapponese SK-II, contenente un prodotto di fermentazione naturale, in genere viene venduta a circa 1.700 yuan, rispetto a un imitazione da 569 yuan dell'alternativa cinese Chando, che pubblicizza un ingrediente simile.\nIl famoso marchio di pingti Lululemon VFU fa pagare solo 200 yuan per un paio di leggings neri da allenamento a vita alta simili a quelli del gigante americano dell'athleisure, che in genere costano quattro volte tanto.\nNonostante la fretta nell’aderire a questa corsa, non è ancora comprensibile se le start-up locali avranno la stessa resistenza dei giganti globali che stanno copiando.\nLe persone che vendono prodotti contraffatti a prezzi molto economici spesso cercano di farsi largo proprio sui canali pingti . C'è poca supervisione sui canali online e social, pochi controlli, è ancora una specie di Far West, in cui fabbriche e rivenditori possono pubblicizzare i prodotti come vogliono, rendendo difficile per i consumatori sapere cosa stanno realmente acquistando. E in genere non ci sono punizioni da parte delle piattaforme social e di e-commerce per i venditori che affermano falsamente di produrre per marchi noti.\nPer ora, questo problema non sta fermando acquirenti come la programmatrice finanziaria 45enne Jessica Wang. Di recente ha speso 3.700 yuan per un pingti di una borsa “Lindy” di Hermès, che di solito viene venduta a migliaia di dollari, da un venditore su WeChat le cui borse rispecchiano i design di tante bag di lusso.\n“È stata oltre le mie aspettative sotto molti aspetti: la pelle è così morbida, le cuciture sono delicate e la confezione è bella e curata”, ha detto Wang. “Ordinerò altre borse da quel negozio”.\nCopyright FashionNetwork.com with Bloomberg\nCopyright Bloomberg",

O acordo proposto pela Boeing foi rejeitado com 94,6% dos votos e a greve aprovada com 96%, disse Jon Holden, presidente do sindicato ‘International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751’. “Nossos membros falaram claramente esta noite”, disse o líder deste sindicato que representa mais de 30 mil trabalhadores da fabricante aeronáutica nesta região. A greve começou à meia-noite desta sexta-feira (04h00 no horário de Brasília). A paralisação ameaça a recuperação do grupo, disse o diretor financeiro da Boeing, Brian West, nesta sexta-feira. “A greve terá impacto na produção, nas entregas e nas operações” da empresa “e ameaça a nossa recuperação”, declarou em uma coletiva de imprensa. O protesto afeta duas grandes montadoras no estreito de Puget Sound e paralisa a produção dos aviões 737, 777 e 767, cujas entregas já estão atrasadas. Isto representa um problema adicional à fabricante que recebe a maior parte do pagamento (cerca de 60%) quando a aeronave é entregue. Apesar da votação esmagadora a favor da greve, o grupo Boeing afirmou em um comunicado que está “comprometido” com as negociações. “Continuamos empenhados em restabelecer nossa relação com nossos colaboradores e com o sindicato e estamos prontos para voltar à mesa de negociações para chegar a um novo acordo”, afirmou a empresa. Segundo analistas da TD Cowen, uma greve de 50 dias privaria a Boeing de entre 3 bilhões e 3,5 bilhões de dólares (16,9 a 19,79 bilhões de reais) em liquidez e teria um impacto de 5,5 bilhões de dólares (31,10 bilhões de reais) nas receitas. A proposta inicial previa um aumento salarial de 25% ao longo de quatro anos e a promessa de investimentos nesta região. Previa também a construção da próxima aeronave, anunciada para 2035, na região de Seattle, berço histórico da fabricante, que deverá garantir empregos para as próximas décadas. Porém, os trabalhadores consideraram que o acordo não era tão generoso e apontaram, por exemplo, que o aumento de 25% era ilusório porque, ao mesmo tempo, cortava um bônus anual. “Estão falando de um aumento de 25% e esse não é o caso”, disse Paul Janousek, eletricista da fábrica em Everett que votou pela greve. Janousek, de 55 anos e há 13 anos na Boeing, estima que o aumento seria de 9% com a eliminação do bônus anual. A greve ocorre em um contexto delicado para a Boeing, cuja reputação foi manchada por vários incidentes de segurança aérea. A fabricante enfrenta uma situação econômica complicada após os acidentes de dois 737 MAX 8 em 2018 e 2019, que tiraram a vida a 346 pessoas, além de vários outros problemas. “Não é segredo que nosso negócio está passando por um momento difícil, em parte devido aos nossos próprios erros do passado. (…) Uma greve colocaria em risco a nossa recuperação”, alertou Kelly Ortberg, CEO da empresa desde agosto. jmb/sw/dbh/jm/es/jc/fp/aa/jb/yr",
