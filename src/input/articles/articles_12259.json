    "title": "Manchester City de Guardiola fecha contratação de Omar Marmoush, afirma Fabrizio Romano",
    "text": "Novo reforço para Guardiola se recuperar\nO Manchester City avançou para fechar três contratações em uma semana. Depois dos zagueiros Vitor Reis, do Palmeiras, e Abdukodir Khusanov, do Lens, agora o clube tem um atacante acertado nos bastidores.\nA bola da vez no Etihad Stadium é Omar Marmoush. O jogador de 25 anos estava no Eintracht Frankfurt, da Alemanha, desde a temporada 2023/24. Agora, terá que brigar por vaga com Erling Haaland.\nSegundo o jornalista Fabrizio Romano, o vínculo contratual assinado entre as partes é válido por cinco anos. O City vai pagar 60 milhões de euros (R$ 373 milhões na cotação atual) pelo camisa 7.\nOmar Marmoush é do Manchester City. Foto: IMAGO / osnapix\nNúmeros: gols e assistências em 30 jogos\nNa temporada 2024/25, Omar Marmoush tem números impressionantes. Guardiola ficou surpreso com o desempenho do atleta no futebol alemão e pediu o reforço.\nA contratação chega à cidade de Manchester depois de disputar 30 jogos com a camisa do Frankfurt, com 21 gols e 13 assistências anotadas nas partidas que entrou em campo.\nQuando Omar Marmoush chega no Manchester City\nA vontade do egípcio em jogar nos Citizens pesou a favor do negócio no mercado da bola. O time da Alemanha não quis pagar para ver o jogador ser desvalorizado e vendeu logo.\nVeja também\nManchester City encaminha mais um reforço milionário após Vitor Reis e Omar Marmoush\nNos próximos dias, ele chega na Inglaterra para sua primeira experiência no futebol inglês. Revelado na base do Wadi Degla, do Egito, ele também já jogou no Wolfsburg.",

    "text": "Raheem Mostert (ankle) remains out Thursday for Miami Miami Dolphins running back Raheem Mostert (ankle) did not practice again on Thursday for Week 17 versus the Baltimore Ravens. Mostert has been held out of both practices this week while he manages an ankle injury, but he's expected to play on Sunday. De'Von Achane (toe) is also banged up, so Jeff Wilson could see an uptick in snaps and touches against the Ravens. Despite logging a season-low 19 snaps in last week's win over the Dallas Cowboys, Mostert still handled double-digit touches and scored a touchdown. Mostert is the RB25 in numberFire's Week 17 rankings and our models project him for 11.2 FanDuel points, with 11.9 carries, 58.7 rushing yards, 2.0 receptions, and 15.7 receiving yards. The Ravens are allowing the sixth-fewest FanDuel points per game to running backs this season and they have the No. 12 run defense in the NFL, according to our opponent-adjusted efficiency metrics.

    "text": "“Another strike against land-based weather forecasts,” Lee sighed as we both looked out the windows at torrential rain falling on the docks. I had volunteered to help with youth sailing classes on winter weekends. We would have canceled for the day, but the optimistic forecast that morning promised “clear skies by afternoon.”\nLee was there because she had convinced a traffic court judge that this would count as her required public service after she was busted for blowing through a four-way stop sign on her bike. It was not her first offense.\n“Get real. I could see there was, like, no cross traffic,” she insisted, still annoyed by the whole incident. “Anyone can watch that intersection all day, and, like, not a single car comes to a full stop. They all roll through at a safe speed once they see that it’s clear, and I do exactly the same thing, exactly, on my bike. It’s just that I’m higher up with a better view and my safe speed is like, a little faster….”\n“You’ll get over it,” advised the club’s official youth sailing instructor, recalling his grandfather’s advice about traffic tickets from the distant past: “Just pay the two dollars.”\n“If it were still two dollars,” Lee complained.\n“But our immediate problem,” I reminded her over our lunch of expertly prepared macaroni and cheese, “is that we have to come up with indoor activities for all these restless young sailors. I guess we could do another knot-tying session.”\n“We did sailing knots last week,” the instructor reminded us. “And frankly, they seemed a little bored even then.”\n“But the weather was perfect for sailing last week,” Lee recalled.\n“Right, the weather was perfect last week; the kids could have been out on the water all day. My bad.” The youth instructor was a college student and a great sailor, always in demand as big-boat crew.\n“You’ll get over it,” Lee returned the instructor’s advice.\n“Remember what they say about tacticians,” I added, seeing no need to give this kid a break. “You’re only as good as your last call.”\n“All right, here’s what we can do today,” the instructor suggested after watching the rain for another minute. “Paper boats. We can float them on the puddles in the parking lot.”\n“Even better,” said Lee, “let’s teach them to make paper self-righting lifeboats. A little more complex than your basic paper boat, but they demonstrate the significance of the roll metacenter: It’s at the center of the rocker radius, a virtual center of rotation of a floating object. And if it’s below the center of gravity, the boat will be unstable in roll, and if the boat is placed upside down on the table, the boat will right itself.”\nThe self-righting paper boat.
