    "text": "HOLLYWOOD, Fla. – South Florida Catholics are coming together in prayer after the Vatican confirmed Saturday that Pope Francis was listed in critical condition as he continues to battle severe health issues.\nThe Vatican said Francis, whose legal name is Jorge Mario Bergoglio, suffered a prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis while being treated for pneumonia and a complex lung infection.\nSunday morning report:\nSaint Mary’s Cathedral in Miami held several services on Sunday in multiple languages. One in Haitian Creole, another one in English, and one in Spanish.\nLeer en español\nRev. Robert Ayala, of Nativity Catholic Church in Hollywood, shared his deep concern for the 88-year-old pope with Local 10′s Cody Weddle.\n“He’s been an incredible Holy Father,” Ayala said. “He’s led the church and as a shepherd of the flock, we obviously want the best for him.”\nAt a pre-carnival event at the church, the pontiff’s health was a main topic of conversation among the faithful.\nVirginia Stewart, a local Catholic, expressed her commitment to prayer.\n“I pray for him and I say my rosaries for him every day,” she said.\nRichard Amsden, another local parishioner, reflected on the severity of the Pope’s condition.\n“He has bronchitis, he’s 88 years old and now with double pneumonia,” Amsden said. “Certainly he’s always in our prayers and we know that Jesus is the divine physician. And we pray that he’ll take care of him.”\nFor many Catholics, Francis is one of the few popes they have known in their lifetimes, and they are reflecting on his nearly 12-year papacy as they hold onto hope for his recovery.\nAmal Khouzam, a young parishioner, praised the Pope’s example.\n“(There’s) like an image of Christ in him,” she said. “Just the fact that he mirrors Christ in what he does.”\nDespite the sudden nature of his health decline, the faithful remain hopeful that modern medicine and their prayers will help reverse his condition.\nAyala called on the broader community to unite in prayer.\n“I hope that whoever is watching, whoever is listening, that they would join us whether they are Catholic or not,” Ayala said. “Because at the end of the day, he is a human being and if we are one family under God, then we care for each other.”\nThe Vatican says Pope Francis is in good spirits and beloved by so many who continue to pray for his health.\nCopyright 2025 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Holly Willoughby’s bedding range at Dunelm has become an unexpected source of comedic inspiration.\nThe former\nThis Morning host, 42, whose return to Dancing On Ice was recently confirmed, is behind a line of products, including pillowcases and duvet covers, at the homeware chain.\nHowever, one startled shopper, Marty Lawrence, who was making the most of the\nBoxing Day sales, admitted he mistakenly believed, due to the branding, the range was ‘commemorative’.\nSharing a picture of one of Holly’s Dunelm bedroom goods, Marty wrote on X: ‘Honestly thought Holly Willoughby had died and Dunelm were selling commemorative bedding.’\nAfter going viral, the social media post prompted a flurry of jokes, including from Dan Allen, who referring to\nHolly and Phillip Schofield’s queue saga at the Queen’s funeral, wrote: ‘I wanted to buy some but the queues were too long.’\nIn another gag, this time aimed at Holly’s return speech to This Morning after Phillip Schofield’s resignation, Mark remarked: ‘Firstly, did you sleep OK? I hope so.’\nThe original post, which went viral and has had over 100K views at the time of writing, came as I\nTV confirmed Holly would be presenting Dancing On Ice next year with new presenter Stephen Mulhern.\nHolly has been absent from screens since she left This Morning in October following 14 years on the sofa, saying it was a ‘difficult’ goodbye but made the decision for herself and her family.\nThe Wylde Moon founder said in full: ‘I have let ITV know today that after 14 years, I will not be returning to This Morning.\n‘To everyone who has ever worked on the show over the years, thank you so so much. This is such a difficult goodbye, you are incredible and I forever will be proud of what we’ve done together. Thank you to everyone at ITV for being supportive. To every guest who has sat on our sofa, thank you.\nShe departed after Phillip, 61, also left the ITV show in May this year after admitting to lying about\n‘unwise but not illegal’ affair with a younger colleague.\n‘I will miss you all so much. Holly.’\n‘Richard and Judy said, “We only look after this show, it will always belong to the viewers”.\n‘It’s been an honour to just be part of its story and I know this story has many chapters left to go. Sadly, however, I now feel I have to make this decision for me and my family.\n‘Most of all, thank you to the wonderful viewers. You’ve been so loyal, so supportive and the very best company every day.’\nHolly has kept out of the public eye following her This Morning exit, only being\nspotted for the first time last week.\nGot a story?\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the\nMetro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\nMORE :\nThis Morning viewers do ‘double take’ thinking Holly Willoughby has returned\nMORE :\nHolly Willoughby ‘in right state’ over major decision\nMORE :\nThis Morning fans’ hopes for Cat Deeley replacing Holly Willoughby crushed",

    "title": "'It was so surreal': Neighbors react to SWAT incident on Waverly Road",
    "text": "NORTH ANDOVER — Bullets flew throughout an otherwise quiet neighborhood around 9:50 p.m. Wednesday, while some residents were told to hide in their basements and others decided upon their own methods of action to stay safe. What began as a mental-health crisis call escalated into a heavy response by North Andover police officers and members of a SWAT team who scoured the neighborhood and barricaded roads during an hours-long showdown at 416 Waverly Road. Sean DeAdder, who neighbors confirmed they heard police calling for, remained barricaded in his home until he took his own life early Thursday morning. “It was pretty intense. It was a few hours,” said Kelsey Allen of 478 Wood Lane, which abuts DeAdder’s backyard. “I heard mad bullets. It was so close.” The incident began around 9:50 p.m. Wednesday, when the North Andover Police Department received a call from 416 Waverly Road reporting a man was “experiencing a mental health episode inside of the home and was armed with a firearm,” according to police. Neighbors confirmed they heard a singular gun shot around that time as well. “We initially didn’t know what was going on,” said Chad Pick of 440 Waverly Road. “We didn’t know if somebody was running around the neighborhood.” Rick Scialdone of 441 Waverly Road thought the same. He said he called the police and they didn’t confirm what was happening. “We saw some people with a flashlight. We didn’t know what it could be,” Scialdone said. “I’m not huge on guns but I have two. … and I got them out because you never know.” Allen said at 9:50 p.m. five police officers banged on her door, telling her and the woman she lives with to take cover in their basement. North Andover officers responded to the scene and were fired at by DeAdder, police said. One officer was injured after the subject fired a round at a police cruiser. Metal shards struck the officer in the head. He was transported to Lawrence General Hospital, where he was treated and released, according to police. Responding officers then took cover as the Northeastern Massachusetts Law Enforcement Council SWAT team was dispatched. A shelter-in-place order was issued for residents in the immediate area. People took to Facebook and noted that they heard multiple shots, as well as announcements over a bullhorn. “I heard the negotiator and he said, ‘Sean, put the gun down,’” Allen said. “I kept hearing the negotiators saying, ‘We’ll get you the medication that you need.’” When the SWAT team arrived, DeAdder still refused to exit the home, and he continued to fire rounds from the front and rear windows of the house, according to police. The ordeal ended around 2:30 a.m. Thursday, neighbors confirmed. A police officer returned to Allen’s house to tell her everything was safe at 3 a.m. “It was real creepy,” Allen said. “It was so surreal.” Tarps now cover the front door of the house, a window in the front, and two larger windows in the back facing Allen’s property. The fence between the two houses now is missing a section where the SWAT team entered. But DeAdder’s house was already run down, so much so that neighbors said they didn’t believe anyone lived at 416 Waverly Road. Pick even said it “stuck out” among the other houses in the neighborhood. “I didn’t even know anyone lived there,” Allen said. “The house has always looked in disrepair. I thought it was just one of the houses nobody could buy out and they just abandoned.” Scialdone said the family put a dog on a leash in their yard that “runs out when people walk.” His wife has mace now for her walks in case something was to happen, he said.

    "text": "Following nine hearings, it seems that the Lower House has gained the upper hand in its investigation into extrajudicial killings linked to former president Rodrigo Dueterte’s bloody drug war. Can the Senate, which will start its own parallel inquiry “on a clean slate” next week, quickly catch up with the House of Representatives’ quad committee?\nBy strategically utilizing its contempt powers, the committee has compelled its witnesses and resource persons to speak out against their superiors, past and present. The quad committee’s marathon hearings—from midmorning to past midnight—have led to startling confessions which helped to create a composite picture of the true scale of the drug war.\nPrincipally chaired by Rep. Robert Ace Barbers, the four-committee panel is also led by Representatives Romeo Acop, Bienvenido Abante Jr., Dan Fernandez, Aurelio Gonzales Jr., Joseph Paduano, and David Suarez.\nArticle continues after this advertisement For now, these lawmakers have all the aces, thanks to the cooperation of ex-police colonels Royina Garma and Edilberto Leonardo. The duo are erstwhile close aides of Duterte who had direct access to him and his former special assistant, Sen. Bong Go.\nFEATURED STORIES OPINION Remembering EJK victims OPINION Neutralization: Euphemism for kill orders OPINION Surviving the dysfunctional The supporting cast, but no less important, are Corrections Supt. Gerardo Padilla, Lt. Col. Santi Mendoza, Police Lt. Col. Jovie Espenido, confessed drug lord Kerwin Espinosa, and several current and former police officers involved in the assassinations of mayors.\nFollow the money. The quad committee reached a milestone in its inquiry during its eighth hearing on Oct. 11.\nArticle continues after this advertisement After weeks of hemming and hawing, Garma changed her tune and directly implicated Duterte in the drug war killings. He allegedly offered cash rewards akin to the “Davao model,” but the national implementation involved three levels of payments or rewards ranging from P20,000 to P1 million for every drug suspect killed, she said.\nArticle continues after this advertisement In a reversal of fortune, it was Duterte and his closest of confidants who were the subjects of a supposed drug war “matrix” showing how reward money for drug killings allegedly flowed from Duterte, through Go, down to then Philippine National Police chief and now Sen. Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa and Leonardo, whom Garma labeled as the “paymaster.”\nArticle continues after this advertisement Thus, in one fell swoop, Garma succeeded in providing the public with a much clearer picture of how Duterte’s open threat to kill drug suspects was translated into concrete—and deadly—terms on the ground using the Davao template.\nThe implications of Garma’s explosive revelations are too weighty to be ignored.\nArticle continues after this advertisement First, one by one, Duterte’s men and their individual roles in implementing the drug war were established. Second, this was the first time that Go was directly implicated in the drug war by a confidante of Duterte, no less. Both senators denied the allegations, even vowing to lead a parallel inquiry to clear their names (but later backed down amid objections from Senate President Francis Escudero).\nBarayuga slay. Finally, Garma acknowledged her closeness to Duterte, despite being ambiguous when asked about rumors of her romantic relationship with him, and secondly, her involvement in the murder of retired Gen. Wesley Barayuga.\nBefore midnight on Oct. 22 (the ninth hearing), Leonardo came to his senses and followed in the footsteps of Garma. Following his resignation as National Police Commission commissioner, he faced the quad committee once more to confirm the existence of a reward system and the notorious Davao Death Squad (DDS).\nLeonardo, like Garma, denied involvement in the Barayuga murder and paying cash to police who killed drug suspects, possibly to protect themselves from murder charges that would be filed against them. Padilla, the former head of the Davao penal colony, also implicated Garma in the killings of three detained Chinese drug lords in 2016. However, these unresolved murders are hanging over their heads like a sword of Damocles, compelling them to spill the beans on Duterte and his men.\nMoreover, Garma’s confessions, backed up by two sworn affidavits, are so crucial to the whole congressional investigation that Duterte himself had to phone her on Oct. 17, explaining his choice of Leonardo as the head of a planned nationwide antidrug task force.\nAs if the confessions weren’t horrific enough, Espinosa separately told the quad committee that he was coerced by Dela Rosa to falsely testify against then Sen. Leila de Lima in 2016. At the hearing, Espenido then surprisingly corroborated Espinosa’s claim. Espenido even retracted his incriminating statements against De Lima, who also appeared before the quad committee on Oct. 22 to confirm the DDS payoffs’ template for hired gunmen and their handlers.\nIn all of these, we note the diligence and hard work of the House panel members under the leadership of Speaker Martin Romualdez. They may not be as popular as senators, but these honorable lawmakers have shown undisputable competence in cross-examining and eliciting the answers that we all need to hear to lead us even closer to the truth.\n—————-\nYour subscription could not be saved.

    "text": "“Tigre, to serve you,” says Rodolfo Zamora, 65, when he introduces himself.\nHe has had that nickname since he was young and does so with pride, as can be seen in the paintings, drawings, stuffed animals and other objects inspired by tigers that are found around his farm in Oreamuno, a mountainous area in the province of Cartago, in Costa Rica. Delicious.\nHe tours the land with his wife, Hannia Villalobos, also 65 years old, while both emotionally tell the story of their project, the Rinconcito Orgánico Irazú: a well-kept 7,000 square meter space in which they have planted between 60 and 70 products since In 2006, Tigre decided to quit his job at a bank to become a farmer.\nTigre and Hannia, at first glance, are just two more producers in a predominantly agricultural area.\nBut this couple represents a minority.\nTo show it, Tigre points to his neighbors' land: “It looks green, but it is land without nutrients.”\nThe soil, in addition, is visibly affected by land erosion.\nThe passage between one farm and another is the border between two worlds: the division between production with agrochemicals - 98% of the national total - and organic production.\nView of the Rinconcito Organico Irazú farm, in Costa Rica.\nCarlos Herrera\nOrganic agriculture, which seeks to make the most of natural resources in a circular system, represents 1.9% of the total national agricultural area, according to the State of the Nation Program, a report prepared by public universities annually.\nAll organic producers must be certified by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG).\nCosta Rica, although it has promoted and committed to ecological practices for decades, is the country that uses the most pesticides per hectare, according to data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).\nThe organization analyzed the use of these agrochemicals in 100 countries between 2000 and 2020 and the Central American state topped the list with an average use of 23.4 kilograms per ten thousand square meters.\nThere is ample evidence of the danger these products pose to health, which is why they are strongly regulated in the European Union.\nIn Costa Rica this is not the case, and to find the consequences you do not have to go far from where Tigre and Hannia live.\nIn 2023, in two towns in the province of Cartago, around 10,000 people were left without access to drinking water after an aqueduct was contaminated with the pesticide Chlorothalonil, considered a carcinogenic substance and banned in the European Union (although it is produced in Germany).\nLast November, after years of pressure from environmentalists towards different governments, the Executive banned Chlorothalonil.\nIn harmony with the ground\nWhile showing the strawberries growing in his greenhouse, Tigre explains that the difference between his fruit and one with chemicals is instantly noticeable: “The flavor is delicious, tender, it is something else.”\nTigre and Hannia's farm is considered an example.\nThey have won national and international awards, receive visits from prestigious universities in Europe and the United States and give courses to people interested in starting to plant organically.\n“They are shocked to see this project stuck among the conventional,” says Hannia.\nHannia Villalobos, wife of Rodolfo Zamora and also owner of the Rinconcito Orgánico Irazú farm, in Costa Rica, walks through one of her crops.\nCarlos Herrera\nBut organic, they both emphasize, goes beyond just refraining from using chemicals.\nIn the classroom that they have set up on the farm for the courses, the couple gives a real lecture on what the process entails: not depending on external products, that the land requires minimal tillage, without using heavy machinery, that it produces its own fertilizer, harvesting rainwater, working crops by families or even how to touch plants so they grow better.\n“Everything converges in a natural and harmonious way,” explains Tigre.\nThe diversification of the products that are planted is essential for the health of the soil.\nMonoculture causes wear and tear;\nThe variety makes it rich.\nRotating crops by family, as Tigre and Hannia do, causes pests to stop reproducing and leave.\nIn a conventional plantation, where the same thing is planted over and over again, pests proliferate and there is no option but to use chemicals to kill them.\nOrganic imitates nature, where everything grows mixed.\nFor the couple, one of their frustrations is not being able to replicate organic production in the area.\nThey want to convince other farmers that conventional farming is more affected by climate change and has more unstable prices.\nAlthough this does not mean that organic is exempt.\nThe drought that affects Costa Rica this year, for example, has left Tigre and Hannia with much lower water reserves than they are used to at this time of year.\nCristian Rivera, a worker at the Rinconcito Orgánico Irazú farm, in Costa Rica, fertilizes the land with organic products. Carlos Herrera\nBeyond the economic benefits, organic stands out because it highlights how harmful pesticides are, both for consumers and for those who plant the land, they explain.\nOne of the day laborers who works for Tigre and Hannia, Cristian Rivera, 48, knows this well.\nBefore coming to Rinconcito Orgánico, he worked on another farm in the area applying chemicals.\nThe effects on his body became evident: “I couldn't even run anymore.”\nHe constantly felt exhausted and short of breath.\nNow, away from working with agrochemicals, he has regained his vitality, he explains while applying natural fertilizer in the greenhouse.\nA small, exclusive and limited market\n―Excuse me, do you know where Bryan's position is?\n―“The one with Papaya?\nHe is over there,” says a woman, pointing to a stall where three dogs are running.\nOne of these dogs is Papaya.\nIts owner, Bryan Didier, 44, has a booth at the Green Fair, a space where only certified organic producers sell in the center of the capital, San José.\nBryan's dog is named after one of his star fruits.\nWhile he serves customers, early in the morning, he offers them a piece of fresh papaya.\n“It's something else, he tastes different,” explains this producer, who has his farm in La Fortuna about three hours by car from San José.\nHe has been working the land with his father since 2006 and they currently plant about 70 products.\nBryan Didier serves his customers at his agricultural products stand at the Aranjuez Green Fair, in San José, Costa Rica.\nCarlos Herrera\nLa Fortuna is an area divided between tourism and large monoculture.\nBryan's farm is surrounded by large companies and many pesticides.\nTo prevent his land from becoming contaminated, he implemented a “living barrier” of green poppies.\nIt has worked.\nHis farm, in contrast to the desert monoculture plantations, is full of wild animals that arrived in the area on their own.\nThe four sloth bears hanging from his trees make him proud.\nTogether with two workers, he delivers the products to customers.\nShe explains to an older woman how to eat lemon peel, to another she lists in English which products she has available and which she does not.\nEnglish is heard a lot at the Green Fair.\nAnd not just in Bryan's position, who is half American, but all over the place.\nThis space is a representation of some very specific demographics of the city.\nAmericans, Europeans and wealthy Costa Ricans: the privileged sphere of the capital's society.\nMany of the producers who sell at the fair are aware that they sell to an audience that can pay the highest prices for organic products and that is informed about the damage caused by conventional agriculture.\nBryan Didier places some of his organic products at the Aranjuez Green Fair, in San José, Costa Rica.\nCarlos Herrera\nFor organic producers, however, selling at the same price as the conventional market is not an option.\nTo maintain their certification, they not only have to pay a fee of about $1,000 every year, but they must maneuver through a bureaucratic labyrinth to complete all the paperwork.\nThe MAG also has the right to carry out surprise inspections at any time and remove the certificate if all the requirements of the regulation are not met.\n“The Government is stepping on us.\nToday I wouldn't do this whole process again,” Bryan complains.\nThere are other problems, such as what Moisés Gómez (Dota, San José, 29 years old) describes as “unfair competition” in the organic area.\nThose producers who say they are certified and are not or who mix products from an organic and a conventional farm.\nMoisés Gómez at his organic agricultural products stand at the Aranjuez Green Fair, in San José, Costa Rica.Carlos Herrera\nMoisés knows this world well because his entire family is dedicated to organic agriculture in Dota, a canton south of San José.\nTogether with his parents and his three brothers, they grow several dozen products that he sells at the Green Fair.\nTheirs is the first booth you see when entering the fair.\nFrom before six in the morning there is a lot of customer movement, without a second to rest.\nUnlike Bryan and Hannia and Tigre, who are surrounded by conventional farmers, Moisés comes from a place considered among the most organically productive in the country.\nHe explains that many of his neighbors grow organically just like him and his family, so the concern about contamination of his products is much less.\nMoisés agrees, however, that there is a general problem that the organic producer is penalized instead of promoted.\nA position that Bryan, Tigre and Hannia also hold.\nDenmark, the country that produces the most organic agriculture - 90% of its products - is characterized by the fact that the Government subsidizes producers and encourages them.\nIn Costa Rica the opposite happens and planting with agrochemicals is still deeply rooted.\n“We like things ready and easy and we get used to them.\nPeople have to understand that the cheapest medicine is food.\nThat it is worth the effort,” says Bryan.",
