    "text": "CINCINNATI ( WXIX /Gray News) - A retired Cincinnati police sergeant and his family saved an Ohio couple who just happened to be vacationing in the same area in Florida. The Ramsey family is from Ohio, while the Bell family lives in northern Kentucky. Up until June 11, the two families had no idea they lived so close to one another. Some might call it a coincidence. Others will say it’s luck, but these two families call it a miracle. Dean and Shana Ramsey recall the moment they said they almost drowned while vacationing in Siesta Key, Florida. Several streets flooded that day after the area received more than 11 inches of rain, an abnormal amount, according to Sarasota County officials. “You couldn’t see anything but rain and water,” Dean Ramsey recalled. With several cars stalled on the road, the couple said they tried to pull off on what they thought was land. “The water sucked us right into that lagoon and that was it,” Dean Ramsey explained. Watching in horror from their condo was retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant Mike Bell, his wife Ginger Bell and their three young kids. The Bell family responded. “We were able to stop, slow things down, and assess and make some decisions on how we were going to move forward,” Mike Bell said. That plan started with Mackenzie Bell giving valuable information to 911. “I remembered they needed to know the address, so that’s the first thing I told her and then I told her a car is in the pond and there was two people in there,” Mike’s and Ginger Bell’s daughter, Mackenzie Bell, said. Meanwhile, the retired sergeant and his wife, who is an emergency medical doctor, took action. “I went over to the edge of the water and realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” Mike Bell recounted from that moment. “At that time, Ginger exited the front door next to the pond. I look at her and said, ‘We need flotation devices.’” That’s where little Hank Bell came in. “I didn’t want them to die, so I ran as fast as I could,” Hank Bell explained. “I went up the elevator, which is extremely slow, and I knew there were stairs that were faster. So, I ran down the stairs.” Flotation devices in hand, the Bell kids handed them to their parents who were already in the water. “He went into the lady’s side and I went into the man’s side,” Ginger Bell said. “She was able to climb out on her own, but I put the boogie board right in front of her. She got her body on the boogie board and that’s when I started paddling and we kicked over to the side.” Ginger Bell ran into some issues helping Dean Ramsey. “When he was trying to get out, his foot got stuck, so he was on his back with one foot out and one foot stuck in the steering wheel,” Ginger Bell remembered. “I looked at her and I said, ‘I’m stuck, I can’t,’” Dean Ramsey remembered. “At that time, I was like, ‘I’m going down with the car,’ but she’s like, ‘Get out of this car! You got to get out! Kick your leg!’ I started thrashing my leg and my foot popped out.” The rescue took about five minutes. Back on dry land, the Ramsey family saw their rescuers as “guardian angels.” The families say they have plans to reunite in the near future. The Bell family wants to remind residents to always be mindful of their surroundings and assess a situation before getting involved. They said if your car is going in a body of water, roll down the windows or punch them out by hitting the corners. Those tactics could save a life. Copyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "13 Dec 2024 | 10:05 AM UTC\nKosovo, Serbia: Adverse winter weather forecast across both countries through at least Dec. 15\nAdverse winter weather forecast across Kosovo and Serbia through at least Dec. 15. Hazardous driving conditions likely.\nAdverse winter weather conditions are forecast across Kosovo and Serbia through at least Dec. 15. Freezing rain and strong winds are forecast across the region over the coming days, with snowfall possible in elevated areas. Hazardous driving conditions are likely due to slippery roads and reduced visibility caused by blowing snow.\nThe Republic Hydrometeorological Service (RHMS) of Serbia has issued the following weather warnings Dec. 14:\nOrange snow and ice warnings (the middle level on a three-tier scale): Backa, Eastern Serbia, Southwestern Serbia, Srem, Sumadija, and Western Serbia regions in Serbia.\nYellow snow and ice warnings: Across Kosovo and Banat, Belgrade, and Pomoravlje regions in Serbia.\nYellow strong wind warnings: Banat Region in Serbia.\nFurther yellow snow and ice warnings are in place across Kosovo and parts of eastern and southern Serbia Dec. 15, as well as yellow strong wind warnings for Banat Region. Officials could update and extend the coverage of weather alerts over the coming days.\nIn addition to the wintry precipitation, strong wind gusts could lead to periods of blowing and drifting snow. Sporadic power outages are possible throughout the affected area.\nThe winter weather will likely cause ground transport disruptions in the region over the coming days. Traffic and commercial trucking delays are probable along regional highways. Authorities will probably close stretches of highways if driving conditions become too dangerous. Gusty winds may threaten to topple high-profile vehicles throughout the affected area. Flight delays and cancellations are likely due to ground stops and deicing operations at regional airports.\nMonitor local media for updated weather information. Verify road conditions before driving in areas where heavy snowfall is forecast. Allow extra time to reach destinations in these areas and carry an emergency kit and warm clothes if driving is necessary, especially on secondary or rural routes that could become impassable. Plan accordingly for delivery delays if routing shipments by truck through the affected area. Confirm flights. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",
