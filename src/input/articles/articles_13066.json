    "text": "Washington: US President Joe Biden on Thursday said his deputy Vice President Kamala Harris is “qualified” to lead the county.\nAt a press conference here, Biden said, “From the very beginning, I made no bones about that. She is qualified to be the President. That’s why I picked her.”\nAlso Read ‘Defiant’ Biden vows to keep running for re-election despite eroding support ‘Can’t fight against time’: Actor George Clooney asks Biden to quit US Prez race Biden could decide in days whether to remain in US Prez race, says Hawaii Governor When asked about the reasons for this, he said “Firstly because of the way she’s handled the issue of freedom of women’s bodies, to have control of their bodies and secondly, her ability to handle almost any issue on the board.”\n“This was a hell of a prosecutor. She was a first rate person and in the Senate, she was really good. I wouldn’t have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be the President,” Biden said.\nThe President mistakenly referred to Kamala Harris as Donald Trump during the press conference. He said, “I wouldn’t have picked Trump to be the Vice President, did I think she was not qualified to be President….”\n“The fact is that the consideration is that I think I’m the most qualified person to run for President. I beat him once and I will beat him again,” Biden said.\n“The idea that senators and congressmen are running for office worrying about the ticket is not unusual. And I might add, there were at least five Presidents running or incumbent presidents who had lower numbers than I have now later in a campaign,” he said.\nSo, there’s a long way to go in this campaign and so I’m just going to keep moving, he said.",

    "title": "Las lecciones de Alberto | El Heraldo de México",
    "text": "Afortunadamente, la tormenta tropical Alberto, que amenazaba a varios estados del país, principalmente Tamaulipas y Monterrey, se debilitó hasta convertirse en depresión tropical conforme recorrió México, y dejó varias lecciones que son dignas de retomar. De entrada, las entidades por las que pasó el primer fenómeno meteorológico del año vivieron una noche paradójica porque si bien había temor ante las afectaciones que podía dejar, por el otro lado, aguardaron con esperanza que llegara el agua, por lo que consideraron que valía la pena correr el riesgo. El año pasado, Nuevo León vivió una tremenda escasez de lluvia. De enero a octubre de 2023, en el estado, apenas cayeron 352 milímetros, cuando el promedio, de acuerdo a Conagua, indica que cada año llueve en la entidad alrededor de 579 milímetros. Luego del paso de Alberto, se rellenaron las presas de El Cuchillo y La Boca, e incluso hubo que abrir las compuertas para liberar agua. Sin embargo, desafortunadamente, en las primeras horas del paso de Alberto, se reportó la muerte de tres menores de edad. Uno, Azael Alberto, de 16 años, al tratar de rescatar el balón con el que jugaba en el río La Silla, y los otros dos al recibir una descarga eléctrica cuando en bicicleta pasaron por un encharcamiento donde había un cable suelto. También perdió la vida un adulto por intentar hacer una reparación eléctrica en su domicilio. Ahí, sin duda, hubo fallas de parte de Protección Civil que con explicaciones huecas trataron de justificarse. En Tamaulipas, uno de los efectos de Alberto tiene que ver con que una leyenda urbana se revivió. Desde antes de que el primer huracán del año llegara al estado, en Ciudad Madero, Altamira y Tampico, sus habitantes desarrollaban sus actividades diarias de manera normal, sin inquietarse mayormente porque saben que antes de llegar un fenómeno meteorológico de este tipo, se desvían hacia los costados y aseguran que no es la primera ocasión que esto ocurre y que se debe a la presencia de ovnis que protegen esa zona del país. Casualidad o coincidencia, esta tormenta tropical desvió su trayectoria. La noche del pasado miércoles, por las redes sociales se reportó que unas luces, cuya procedencia se desconoce, aparecieron en el cielo de Tampico, con lo que la leyenda urbana cobró mayor fuerza. Alberto pasó sin dejar daños mayores a diferencia de lo que ocurrió en el caso del huracán Otis, que destruyó Acapulco. Sin embargo, las áreas de Protección Civil de los estados deberían tener un papel más activo en el inicio de la temporada de huracanes que llaman a la emergencia. No se puede dejar todo a los ovnis, a la suerte o a las explicaciones huecas. POR ADRIANA MORENO CORDERO COLABORADORA EEZ",

    "title": "Qatari court’s commutation of death sentence of 8 Indians a major diplomatic victory",
    "text": "New Delhi: The commutation of death sentences awarded to eight former Indian Navy personnel to various sentences ranging from three to 25 years by the Qatari Court of Appeal is seen as a diplomatic victory by the Indian establishment. The death sentence was pronounced in October after the Navy personnel were detained in August 2022. The charges against them are not known, but reports hinted they have been held for espionage. The Indian Embassy’s usual response when asked about the case was that “it was a sensitive matter and please be cautious while reporting. We are making all efforts to bring back the former Navy personnel”. That the commutation comes just two months after the death penalty slapped on eight personnel shows that the Indian authorities moved heaven and earth to get the death penalty quashed. The diplomatic success came due to relentless efforts made by Indian authorities at the Indian Embassy in Doha and the External Affairs Ministry. During the COP28 summit in Dubai, held from November 30 to December 12, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, but there was no official confirmation on whether the issue figured in their unofficial talks. The commutation comes barely four weeks after this, and reports suggest it is rare to get commutation of sentences, especially for espionage charges, in Gulf countries. India would have also tapped the country’s goodwill with Gulf countries to open up a way to secure a quashing of the death sentence, which would further open the possibility of the Indian personnel being brought back home, through backchannel diplomacy. It is not clear what sort of charges have been slapped against the former Navy personnel, but international media reports hinted the charges related to carrying out espionage activities at the behest of Israel. That the commutation comes amid escalating tensions in the Gulf between Israel and Hamas points to overwhelming diplomatic efforts at play. Qatar is a major trade partner of India and houses a large chunk of the Indian diaspora. India had fully backed the former Naval personnel’s efforts to appeal against the death sentence in a higher court. The trial on this was held on November 23, 30 and December 7. Qatar also allowed Indian authorities to communicate with the detained personnel at least four times. The Indian authorities also succeeded in ending the solitary confinement of some of the convicts. The Indians convicted have been identified as Captains Navtej Gill and Saurabh Vasisht, Commanders Purnendu Tiwari, Amit Nagpal, S K Gupta, B K Verma and Sugunakar Pakala, and sailor Ragesh. India signed an agreement with Qatar in 2015, which is likely to be invoked to bring back the convicts. It allows the convicts to serve the sentence in their home country, reports said.",
