    "text": "New law in Ohio cracks down on social media use among kids: What to know [Kayla Bennett](https://www.dispatch.com/staff/8401066001/kayla-bennett/) Starting in January a new state law will make it harder for children under 16 to access social media in Ohio. On Jan. 15, [Ohio’s Social Media Parental Notification Act](https://governor.ohio.gov/administration/lt-governor/071123) will go into effect, and big name companies will have until then to comply. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed the state’s annual budget in July, which included the Social Media Parental Notification Act. Here's everything to know about Ohio's new law and how it works. What is Ohio's new social media law? The law requires companies to obtain parental consent to contractual terms of service from a parent or legal guardian before individuals younger than 16 can use the companies' platforms. This includes social media and online gaming or activity companies, such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat. It does not pertain to e-commerce platforms. If a parent or legal guardian fails or refuses to consent to the terms of service, the company must deny the child access or use of the platform. How do companies obtain consent? Companies will have to follow certain steps in order to consent from a parent or legal guardian. The steps include creating a method to determine whether the user is a child under the age of 16 and obtaining verifiable parental or legal guardian consent If the user indicates that they are under the age of 16, the following methods can be used for verification: - Sign a digital form consenting to the terms of service - Use a credit card, debit card, or other online payment system - Call a toll-free telephone number - Connect to trained personnel via video-conference - Check a form of government-issued identification Companies then must send the written confirmation of the consent to the parent or legal guardian. Why is this happening? Lt. Gov. Jon Husted pushed for the new law. He believes social media is designed to be addictive and is harming the mental health of children. He said it’s time that parents have more say in the digital lives of their children. \"We hope that more parents will either prohibit or limit the amount of interaction their children are having, amount of time their children are spending on their devices, on these apps, and put filters on it to make sure that it is limiting the age-level content if they really want their children to be seeing,\" Husted said. Some companies, like Meta, already have support features Companies like Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and other platforms, already have features in place to support teenagers and their families when using their platforms. For example, Meta has age verification technology that helps users experience appropriate content and accounts for their age. Accounts are also automatically set to private for individuals under the age of 16. Rachel Holland, a Meta spokesperson, said the company wants young people to have a safe and positive experience across the internet and that’s why they’ve built safety and privacy features into teen experiences. “We’ve developed more than 30 tools to support families, including parental supervision tools that allow teens and parents to navigate social media safely together and tools to help ensure teens have age-appropriate experiences online,” Holland said in a statement. Meta's Director of Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis recently [wrote a blog post](https://medium.com/@AntigoneDavis/parenting-in-a-digital-world-is-hard-congress-can-make-it-easier-6039e7a350b1) calling for a solution to parental consent. \"Parents should approve their teen’s app downloads, and we support federal legislation that requires app stores to get parents’ approval whenever their teens under 16 download apps,\" Davis wrote. She believes the industry should come together with lawmakers to create simple, efficient ways for parents to oversee their teens' online experiences. Instagram is now [supporting federal legislation](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/wBqFCW6KY7iDgE7z9TK9UfX?domain=about.instagram.com). “We’ll continue evaluating proposed legislation and working with policymakers on developing simple, easy solutions for parents on these important industry wide issues,” Holland said. Will Ohio's new law stick? Other states have passed laws pertaining to children’s privacy on social media platforms. However, judges have blocked those laws in some states, like in Arkansas following a lawsuit from NetChoice, a coalition of trade associations, e-commerce businesses and online consumers. NetChoice submitted [opponent testimony](https://netchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NetChoice-Opposition-to-Sub.-H.-B.-No.-33-Ohio-Unlawful-takings.pdf) for Ohio’s new legislation. Other states, like [Utah](https://socialmedia.utah.gov/#:~:text=Starting%20on%20March%201%2C%202024,access%20to%20their%20child%27s%20account), will be joining Ohio in having legislation take effect next year. In other states, Husted said, social media and online gaming or activity companies have been cowardly in the actions they’ve taken against the legislation. He said rather than stepping out in public, companies just file lawsuits to try and prevent the laws from going into effect. “I fully expect that that's being contemplated in Ohio, and I will give them fair warning that if they don't comply with this, what we simply have asked them to do, that we will be more aggressive in what we do in response,” Husted said. Companies, if they do not comply, will face civil penalties and fines, which are listed out in the [law’s revised code](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-1349.09).

    "text": "El ministro de Defensa de Alemania, Boris Pistorius, ha reiterado una vez más que la actual ofensiva sobre Ucrania \"es solo el principio\" para la Rusia de Vladimir Putin, que con los años incrementa cada vez más su capacidad armamentística y podría suponer en el futuro una amenaza mayor. \"Estamos siendo testigos de cómo Rusia está incrementando rápidamente su producción de armas y aumentando drásticamente sus fuerzas armadas\", ha manifestado Pistorius ante el Parlamento de Lituania, donde ha señalado que lo ocurrido en Ucrania debe interpretarse como la \"última llamada de atención\" a Occidente. Así las cosas, el ministro germano ha aseverado que para el presidente Putin el estilo de vida libre y democrático es su verdadero enemigo, a la par que trata de socavar la cohesión entre los Estados miembro de la Unión Europea y los países de la OTAN con métodos híbridos como ciberataques. \"Las Fuerzas Armadas alemanas están preparadas para convertirse en un pilar central de la disuasión y la defensa convencionales en Europa\", ha señalado Pistorius, que también ha asegurado estar trabajando para que el Ejecutivo germano se comprometa a elevar el gasto en defensa por encima del dos por ciento del PIB. Asimismo, el ministro de Defensa alemán ha reconocido sus planes para introducir un nuevo modelo de servicio militar obligatorio aludiendo a que \"los tiempos han cambiado\" y que solo con esta herramienta \"podrán sobrevivir las Fuerzas Armadas (de Alemania) en caso de guerra\". Alemania inició a comienzos de abril el despliegue permanente de tropas en Lituania, una medida encaminada a reforzar el flanco oriental de la Alianza Atlántica tras un acuerdo de seguridad firmado entre Berlín y Vilna a finales de 2023 y con la guerra en Ucrania como telón de fondo. En este sentido, Pistorius ha señalado que los militares alemanes pronto trabajarán \"hombro con hombro\" con las Fuerzas Armadas de Lituania. Está previsto que Berlín llegue a desplegar hasta 5.000 de sus militares en las localidades de Rudninkai y Rukla en un proceso que se estima que culmine en 2027.",

    "text": "(ZENIT Noticias / Nigeria, 28.12.2023).- La Navidad de 2023 estuvo marcada por graves actos de violencia en Bokkos, en el estado nigeriano de Plateau. Los atacantes, supuestamente más de mil fulanis, atacaron sobre todo a las comunidades cristianas del 23 al 26 de diciembre. Murieron casi 170 personas, y se espera que el número de víctimas siga aumentando. Muchos desplazados han buscado refugio en iglesias y las organizaciones religiosas son las que prestan la ayuda principal, dada la falta de apoyo gubernamental. Se han producido ataques en unas 26 comunidades, principalmente en Bokkos, pero también en partes de Mangu y en comunidades locales de Barkin Ladi, también en el estado de Plateau. Desde 1999 han aumentado los conflictos por la tierra entre los pastores fulani, de mayoría islámica, y los agricultores locales, en su mayoría cristianos. Bajo la administración del ex presidente Muhammadu Buhari, se extendió la tolerancia hacia las actividades de los pastores fulani, lo que dio lugar a bandidaje, secuestros y ataques. El padre Andrew Dewan, director de comunicaciones de la diócesis de Pankshin, en cuyo territorio se produjeron los ataques, afirma en una entrevista con Ayuda a la Iglesia Necesitada (AIN) que las víctimas constatadas son «167, pero el número está destinado a aumentar, porque todavía hay muchas personas en los hospitales, con heridas y lesiones de diversa consideración». El ataque se lanzó contra comunidades cristianas. «Vivo en esta misma comunidad y puedo confirmar que en las zonas donde se produjeron estos ataques, las víctimas son 100% cristianas, salvo unas pocas. Esta violencia comenzó por la noche en una comunidad rural llamada Mushu. Dieciocho personas fueron asesinadas y muchas otras resultaron heridas», los terroristas se trasladaron después a Tudun Mazat, «se asesinó sumariamente a personas, se incendiaron casas y cosechas de maíz, también se prendió fuego a iglesias y clínicas. Esa mañana yo había ido a esa misma comunidad para la misa de Navidad de la comunidad católica. Desde Tudun Mazat, los terroristas fulani descendieron sobre Maiyanga y mataron a trece personas. Durante la noche, atacaron otras 20 comunidades». En cuanto a la identidad de los atacantes, el sacerdote afirma que «los supervivientes y los testigos presenciales fueron categóricos al afirmar que se trataba claramente de milicianos fulani. En las comunidades donde los cristianos conviven con los fulani, no se disparó a ningún fulani ni se quemó ninguna casa fulani, por lo que no hay duda de que los atacantes eran fulani. En cuanto al motivo, no estoy seguro», continúa el padre Andrew, «pero podría estar relacionado con los ataques que tuvieron lugar en el gobierno local vecino, Mangu. Allí los fulani atacaron las comunidades y esperaban que los cristianos de Bokkos, especialmente las comunidades de la frontera con Mangu, les permitieran el acceso, pero se negaron. Así que creo que volvieron a atacar a las comunidades por este motivo». En cuanto a la matriz anticristiana, el sacerdote explica: «Para los que creen que este conflicto no es religioso, este último ataque demuestra que se trata claramente de un conflicto religioso. El hecho de que haya tenido lugar en Navidad y que los cristianos hayan sido deliberadamente atacados en una comunidad mixta, donde los musulmanes no son atacados, muestra claramente las características de un conflicto religioso. Sé que no a todo el mundo le gustaría admitirlo, pero para mí, que he estado sobre el terreno, lo he observado y he escrito sobre ello, hay indicios de un conflicto religioso». Las víctimas de esta violencia se quejan a menudo de la falta de respuesta de la policía. El padre Andrew cuenta que ésta «debería haber utilizado la inteligencia», porque antes de los atentados «había rumores, y esto debería haber puesto a la seguridad en alerta roja, pero como ocurre a menudo, les cogieron por sorpresa». En cuanto a los políticos, están «ausentes; nuestros dirigentes», añade el sacerdote, «no viven en la comunidad, por lo que no entienden los problemas que afligen a la gente». La diócesis de Pankshin se enfrenta a «una enorme avalancha de desplazados internos. Los cristianos de las aldeas afluyen a los centros urbanos en busca de refugio, alimentos y ropa, en un momento en que el clima es muy frío, comparable al que hace ahora en Europa. Debido a la falta de una respuesta oficial, a menudo son las Iglesias las que tienen que responder a estas emergencias», concluye. La presidenta ejecutiva de AIN, Regina Lynch, comentó: «Pedimos al gobierno que aborde de una vez este problema y proporcione seguridad a sus ciudadanos, e instamos a nuestros amigos y benefactores a que sigan rezando por Nigeria, del mismo modo que nosotros nos comprometemos a seguir ayudando en todo lo que podamos. Nuestros hermanos y hermanas cristianos asesinados en Nigeria, y en otros países del mundo, son los «Santos Inocentes» del siglo XXI. La sangre derramada como seguidores de Jesús será, estamos seguros, semilla de nuevos cristianos».",

    "text": "Duna Márquez\nPalma 01 NOV 2024 11:54 Mallorca se encuentra en alerta naranja durante este viernes 1 de noviembre por la DANA (sigla de depresión aislada en niveles altos) que ha dejado al menos 155 de fallecidos y decenas de desaparecidos en la provincia de Valencia.\nEl pasado lunes, Manacor vivió los efectos de este fenómeno meteorológico con fuertes precipitaciones que dejaron 174 litros por metro cuadrado que provocaron inundaciones, carreteras cortadas e intervenciones de los Bomberos de Mallorca, una de ellas en la Rafa Nadal Academy. Para este viernes se espera que regrese la DANA.\nLa DANA en España, en directo | Ascienden a 155 los muertos en Valencia por las inundaciones\nLa Agencia Estatal de Meteorología ha activado la alerta naranja en toda la isla por precipitaciones acumuladas de 50 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora, llegando a acumularse 120 litros por metro cuadrado en algunas zonas de la isla en pocas horas.\nLas lluvias se mantendrán hasta el sábado 2 de noviembre, alargándose el aviso naranja hasta primera hora de la mañana. Con el avance de las horas la alerta desaparecerá, pero las precipitaciones se mantendrán a lo largo del día.\nEl Govern pide \"máxima prudencia\" Ante la emergencia meteorológica para este día de Tots Sants, el Govern balear ha reclamado “ máxima prudencia” a los ciudadanos “las próximas horas y días” por la alerta naranja decretada. Se recomienda que se tomen precauciones y mantenerse informado de la predicción meteorológica más actualizada. Las actividades habituales y al aire libre pueden verse alteradas.\nEl Servicio de Emergencias 112 ha activado el Índice de Gravedad 1 (IG1) del Plan Meteobal por lluvias y tormentas en Mallorca y Menorca.\nPara coordinar posibles actuaciones conjuntas, la Dirección General de Emergencias ha reunido esta mañana al Grupo de Soporte Técnico del Plan con representantes, entre otros, de los Bomberos del Consell de Mallorca, Bomberos de Palma, Cuerpo Nacional de Policía, Guardia Civil, AEMET, Carreteras del Consell de Mallorca, Ibanat, SAMU 061, Recursos Hídricos y RiscBal.\nRecomendaciones para la alerta naranja en Mallorca Así, ante la posibilidad de que se produzcan inundaciones como consecuencia de las intensas lluvias y dado que este viernes se celebra la festividad de Tost Sants, se han consensuado estas recomendaciones:\nPlanificar las visitas a los cementerios en función de las condiciones meteorológicas y extremar las precauciones , prestando especial atención a las personas más vulnerables. En el hogar, asegurar puertas y ventanas y quedarse en las zonas altas de la casa. Se aconseja también retirar del exterior todo lo que pueda ser arrastrado por el agua y trasladar medicamentos, documentos y elementos de valor, así como comida y agua potable a los lugares altos de la casa. Se recomienda evitar los sótanos o zonas bajas, como garajes, y desconectar el interruptor general de electricidad en el caso de que el agua ya haya entrado en la casa. En el exterior, aconsejan alejarse de torrentes y zonas inundables y, en zona urbana, buscar refugio en un edificio. No se aconseja caminar por zonas con agua en movimiento, ya que, cuanto más rápido corre el agua, más peligro hay. Hay que evitar los desplazamientos en coche y, si es necesario circular, se debe moderar la velocidad y aumentar la distancia de seguridad. Se tiene que hacer por autopistas, autovías y carreteras principales. En caso de baja visibilidad, se debe detener el vehículo y señalizar su posición. No se debe entrar en zonas inundables, aunque parezca que hay poca agua, ya que, con poca altura de agua, los coches flotan y son arrastrados fácilmente. Si el coche comienza a flotar y es arrastrado, hay que salir del vehículo de forma inmediata y, si no se puede por la puerta, se debe hacer por la ventana. En estos casos es recomendable abandonar el vehículo y dirigirse a zonas más altas en caso de que el coche quede inmovilizado por el agua o que el nivel de agua ya llegue al eje. Aconsejan también llevar el móvil cargado y suficiente combustible en el vehículo y no aparcar en puentes, aceras o desembocaduras. En caso de emergencia, hay que llamar al 112. TEMAS",

    "text": "Opinion: Out of the ashes of the old: hope emerges from the darkness Miller is a local author, professor at San Diego City College, and vice president for the American Federation of Teachers, Local 1931. He lives in Golden Hill. For me, 2023 was the year from hell as I suffered through sudden and acute liver failure due to autoimmune hepatitis that resulted in a transplant operation in late July that saved my life with almost no time to spare. This was immediately followed by a toxic reaction to the anti-rejection medication which I was given that led to a series of dangerous seizures, periods of psychosis, mania and delirium, all of which I made my way through with plenty of scars [but also great appreciation for my good fortune](https://dougporter.substack.com/p/my-dark-nights-of-the-soul-notes). In sum, I had a few dances with death and somehow managed to elude its embrace. As [I wrote in this space](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/community-voices-project/story/2023-08-14/opinion-near-death-experience-live-failure-compassion-gratitude-hardship) just after that ordeal, “And now, as I recover, with deep gratitude and compassion for the struggle and suffering of others, it is still hard to write a piece like this, word by word, sentence by sentence, step by step. Life is about persistence in the face of hardship and if we are lucky, we can transcend and heal.” Then, three months into my recovery, I was back in the hospital for a week after coughing up blood, seemingly out of nowhere, and had to be treated with multiple antibiotics and other medications. These stopped the bleeding, [but the precise cause of this latest malady is yet to be determined](https://dougporter.substack.com/p/thanksgiving-in-dark-times). This all adds up to living with an intensified uncertainty on the personal level while the external world seems bent on piling suffering on top of radical uncertainty, from the danger and misery of wars abroad to the perils of our global leaders’ failure to adequately address the looming threat of climate catastrophe. Indeed, war, ecocide, mass shootings, civil discord, threats to democracy, extreme weather and natural disasters have become the taken-for-granted backdrop of our daily lives. Thus, as we enter a new year, it’s hard not to fall victim to despair or cynicism about our ability to right the ship. All of it brings to mind the words of the great Mary Oliver in her poem “At the River Clarion”: “I pray for the desperate earth / I pray for the desperate world / I do the little each person can do, it isn’t much / Sometimes the river murmurs, sometimes it roars.” And, at present, the river of our collective lives is roaring fiercely. The waters are unsettled, continually treacherous, and the obstacles we face can seem insurmountable. It would be naïve to suggest otherwise, yet, somehow, we must endure and persist. In my own case, this means greeting every day of my continued recovery with patience and developing a tolerance for the lack of certainty that will come with the end of my medical leave and return to work. I will have to learn to deal with life as a deeply immunocompromised person in a world that is done with worrying about COVID and other infectious diseases. In addition to this, I will not be able to count on my physical and mental endurance in the same way as I have for my entire life. So, I’ll mask up and make my way forward as best I can with no guarantees. As an educator in the humanities, the new year brings challenges with the latest technologies, hostile politics and an increasingly indifferent public. People seduced by superficial materialism, drowning in social media and the omnipresent noise of the culture will continue to raise questions about the value of a traditional higher education. My profession faces what many see as existential threats with increased instrumentalism, opportunistic culture warriors, and budgetary concerns putting the squeeze on funding for departments whose bread and butter involves reading books, talking about ideas, and delving into issues that make us ponder what the point of life is outside of the marketplace. Of course, the truth is that rather than being a useless relic, the core work of the humanities is the cure for what ails us. To read, write, and engage in the arts is an exercise in compassion, an invaluable tool in a world gone wrong. The humanities need to be defended not due to their materialist advantages but rather because they offer us a way to fill the void at the heart of our society by centering questions of human meaning. As a unionist, I hope to be at least a small part of the continuing [upsurge of labor](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/05/uaw-tesla-us-unions) as we keep fighting deep inequities in our country and build a larger sense of solidarity that provides us a [way to connect](https://www.epi.org/publication/unions-promote-racial-equity/#:~:text=Finally%2C%20unions%20help%20reduce%20racial,actual%20causal%20effect%20of%20unionization) across the deep divides that separate us.

    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- The euro helps Europe stay self-determined globally, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said in an op-ed marking the currency’s upcoming 25th anniversary.\n“Issuing the world’s second most important currency has given us greater sovereignty in a turbulent world,” Lagarde wrote in the joint article with Ursula von der Leyen, Charles Michel, Roberta Metsola and Paschal Donohoe — presidents of the European Commission, Council, Parliament and Eurogroup, respectively.\n“We face rising geopolitical tensions, not least Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine, which calls for bold collective decisions,” the officials said. “We confront an accelerating climate crisis that we can only truly solve together: carbon emissions do not stop at borders. And we face unprecedented challenges to our competitiveness from energy and industrial policies in other parts of the world.”\nLaunched by 11 countries at the start of 1999, the euro stayed an electronic currency for its first three years. The euro area now includes 20 countries, making it the payment method for some 350 million people.\n“It has made life simpler for European citizens, who can easily compare prices, trade and travel,” the leaders said. “It has given us stability, protecting growth and jobs amid a series of crises.”\nThe euro reaching the quarter-century mark on Jan. 1 shows the endurance of a monetary arrangement whose disintegration has often been predicted.\nAs the Greek crisis raged in 2015, for example, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan reckoned that “it’s just a matter of time before everyone recognizes that parting is the best strategy.” Greece didn’t leave, and instead, the region welcomed its newest member, Croatia, at the start of 2023.\nTwo other euro hopefuls haven’t been so fortunate. Romania’s bid for membership has been hampered by internal squabbling, evidenced by the highest turnover of governments in the EU. And Bulgaria, the bloc’s poorest country, this year had to abandon its plan to join in 2024.\nWhile adopting the euro is theoretically a condition of signing up to the European Union, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Sweden don’t seem interested. Denmark, which clinched an opt-out on acceding before the dawn of the currency, isn’t budging either.\n“With several countries currently in the process of joining the EU, we must retain our capacity to act decisively,” Lagarde and the other EU leaders wrote. “Enlarging and deepening are not mutually exclusive. But enlargement may require changes to how the EU is organized.”\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",
