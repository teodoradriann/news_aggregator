    "text": "North Korea tested exploding drones designed to crash into targets and leader Kim Jong Un called for accelerating mass production of the weapons, state media said Friday.\nThe country's latest military demonstration came as the United States, South Korea and Japan engaged in combined military exercises involving advanced fighter jets and a US aircraft carrier in nearby international waters, in a display of their defence posture against North Korea.\nNorth Korea's official Korean Central News Agency published photos of Kim talking with officials near at least two different types of unmanned aerial vehicles. They included those with X-shaped tails and wings that look similar to the ones the country disclosed in August, when Kim inspected another demonstration of drones that explode on impact.\n The drones flew various routes and accurately struck targets, KCNA said. Its images showed what appeared to be a BMW sedan being destroyed and old models of tanks being blown up.\nKim expressed satisfaction with the weapons' development process and stressed the need to build a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production, noting how drones are becoming crucial in modern warfare.\nKCNA paraphrased Kim as saying drones were easy to make at low cost for a range of military activities. The report did not say if Kim spoke directly about rival South Korea, which the North Korean drones are apparently designed to target.\nNorth Korea last month accused South Korea of sending its own drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the North's capital of Pyongyang, and threatened to respond with force if such flights occur again. South Korea's military has refused to confirm whether or not the North's claims were true.\nMore From This Section Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of war crimes, forced exile in Gaza Strip Ruling NPP heading for absolute majority in Sri Lanka parliamentary poll Brazil launches G20 social summit to highlight needs of low-income people Ford agrees to pay up to $165 mn fine to US govt for slow recall response Israeli strikes kill at least 12 Lebanese rescuers, 15 people in Syria Tensions in the region have escalated as Kim flaunts his advancing nuclear and missile program, which includes various nuclear-capable weapons targeting South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles that can potentially reach the US mainland.\nKim is also allegedly sending military equipment and troops to Russia to support President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine, which raised concerns in Seoul that he would get Russian technology in return to further develop his arsenal.\nIn addition to his intensifying nuclear threats, Kim has also engaged in psychological and electronic warfare against South Korea, such as flying thousands of balloons to drop trash in the South and disrupting GPS signals from border areas near the South's biggest airport.\nSouth Korean officials say North Korea will be a key topic in a trilateral summit between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba this week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Peru.\nSouth Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met on the margins of the APEC on Thursday and discussed strong concerns over deepening ties between Pyongyang and Moscow, particularly the deployment of North Korean troops to support Russia's war against Ukraine, the U.S. State Department said.\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nAlso Read N Korea ratifies defence treaty with Russia stating mutual military aid Russia amends comprehensive strategic partnership treaty with North Korea N Korean GPS manipulation disrupted many planes, vessels: South Korea North Korea fired ballistic missiles outside Japan's economic zone South Korea, EU worry about Russia's technology transfer to North Korea Topics : North Korea Kim Jong Un Military weapon Don't miss the most important news and views of the day.

    "text": "MADRID, 10 May. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nElon Musk ha anunciado una inversión de 500 millones de dólares (463,8 millones de euros) para expandir la red de supercargadores de Tesla apenas una semana después de despedir a los casi 500 empleados que trabajaban en esta división del negocio.\n\"Tesla gastará más de 500 millones de dólares (463,8 millones de euros) en expandir nuestra red de Supercargadores\", ha remarcado este viernes Elon Musk en su cuenta personal de X (antes Twitter), añadiendo que la inversión únicamente será en \"nuevos puntos y ampliaciones, sin contar con los costes operativos, que son mucho más altos\".\nHace diez días, Musk publicó que la compañía planeaba agregar cargadores a un ritmo más lento y centrarse más en el tiempo de actividad y las ubicaciones existentes que en la creación orgánica del negocio.\nERROR DE CÁLCULO\nSin embargo, haber despedido a toda la plantilla de un día para otro ha tenido un efecto colateral que están beneficiando a las petroleras que están buscando electrificar su flota.\nEntre los ejemplo, BP ha visto en la debilidad del negocio de Tesla el momento para quedarse con las instalaciones de carga rápida abandonadas que más les interesan.\nLa estadounidense Revel también está dispuesta a utilizar los supercargadores abandonados de Tesla, en este caso, en Nueva York, al tiempo que valora construir sus propias estaciones de carga en los sitios que ya cuentan con energía renovable.\nVOLANTAZOS EN LA ESTRATEGIA\nEl cambio de opinión del empresario sudafricano recuerda a cuando el director ejecutivo anunció abruptamente a principios de 2019 que Tesla cerraría la mayoría de sus tiendas y trasladaría las ventas casi por completo a Internet.\nDiez días después, después de que los propietarios se negaran a dejar que la empresa abandonara sus contratos de alquiler, Musk dio marcha atrás y anunció que Tesla aumentaría los precios de los vehículos.\nLeer más acerca de: Tesla Elon Musk",

    "title": "Canadian Soccer Business launches legal action against media partner Mediapro - North Shore News",
    "text": "Canadian Soccer Business has launched legal action against Mediapro, its media partner, over breach of contract in a move that will have a major ripple effect on the sport in Canada. Essentially the move means CSB has taken back the broadcast rights to all its properties and is looking for new broadcast/media partners. CSB, whose ownership group and board includes the Canadian Premier League owners, looks after marketing and broadcast rights for both the Canadian Premier League and Canada Soccer. Mediapro is a Barcelona-based multimedia communications group. Mediapro Canada owns OneSoccer, the streaming service that airs both CPL and Canadian national team games. The CSB move leaves OneSoccer without its core Canadian content. CSB alleges Mediapro \"failed to meet significant contractual obligations, including defaulting on the majority of its rights fees due for 2023 and failure to secure broader audiences for Canada’s national teams, the Canadian Championship and the Canadian Premier League.\" \"Our decision to pursue legal action was not one we took lightly, but we felt it was necessary to protect the tremendous investments we have made to build the game in Canada,\" CSB said in a statement. \"By taking back full control of our rights we will immediately have the opportunity to do so with new partners who have the ability to reach larger audiences.\" CSB declined further comment other than the one-paragraph statement. But it is believed the money in dispute is well into the millions. A Mediapro Canada official declined to comment or provide his name when reached by phone in Mississauga. Clearly the CSB hope is that the break with Mediapro will lead to a more satisfactory media partner and getting its product out to more viewers. OneSoccer has had a hard time getting cable providers to open their doors to its service, although the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ruled last March that Rogers Communications had given preferential treatment to its own Sportsnet service over OneSoccer. The inability to get its properties on major broadcast outlets, other than Telus, is believed to part of CSB's beef with Mediapro. And while CSB restricted its comments to Thursday's statement, it seems unlikely it would take such a radical step if it was not confident it could find a replacement media partner, given the Canadian women are in action next month at CONCACAF W Gold Cup, the Canadian men' are playing a Copa America playoff March 23 and the sixth season of the CPL kicks off April 13. The CPL unveiled Mediapro as its media partner in February 2019, less than three months before kicking off its inaugural season. The partnership with Canadian Soccer Business was announced as a 10-year deal. At the time, a source said Mediapro was investing $200 million into the Canadian project over the lifetime of the deal. Scott Mitchell, CEO of Canadian Soccer Business, called it “the single-largest commitment any company has ever made in terms of soccer in Canada.” The agreement gave Mediapro global and domestic media rights to the CPL, the Canadian Championship and Canadian men’s and women’s teams. It also included rights to League 1 Ontario matches, a feeder league under the CPL umbrella. “It’s easy to define our plan in one sentence — we want to build a home for Canadian soccer,” Oscar Lopez Garcia, then CEO of Mediapro Canada, said in 2019. The deal meant the CPL had someone to handle its game production. At the time the deal was announced, Mediapro said it had some 70 production trucks worldwide and was producing games in 16 different leagues. Mediapro also produced all Canadian national team games that fall under Canadian Soccer Business jurisdiction. The company has been in a state of flux of late. Mediapro refinanced its debts in 2022, handing its majority shareholder, Hong Kong-based Southwind Group, more control. Mediapro co-founder Jaume Roures left the company in October and there were reports around that time that Southwind was looking to sell its 80 per cent stake in Mediapro. --- Follow @NeilMDavidson on X platform, formerly known as Twitter This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 25, 2024.

    "text": "Nova Scotia Health has made changes to parking and the main entrance of the QEII Halifax Infirmary. [Learn more.](/locations-and-facilities/halifax-infirmary)\nEastern Kings Memorial Health Foundation Hand-to-Hand to Help fund makes “big impact” by providing financial help for patients undergoing cancer treatment\nIn 2004, the EKM Health Foundation and the Rotary Club of Wolfville both agreed it was important to reinvest in the community by providing grants to some of its most vulnerable citizens – those attempting to deal with the pain, anxiety and expense associated with cancer.\nThe Hand-to-Hand to Help fund is separate from the Foundation’s regular grants program and is designed to complement existing health care processes by providing relief where it is most needed.\nWhile the Foundation manages the monies for this fund, Valley Regional Hospital’s Cancer Care Patient Navigator is the “on the ground” presence who oversees the disbursal of the funds to those patients and families who are most in need.\n“That’s the nice thing about Nova Scotia. It’s community helping community,” said Dianna Hutt, cancer patient navigator, speaking about the Hand-to-Hand to Help fund. The fund provides patients and families from Greenwich to Avonport with financial help for expenses related to their cancer treatment.\n“Travel is probably the most common item,” said Hutt, who notes that patients who require radiation therapy need to travel to Halifax. The fund also supports other items as needed, including medications or uninsured items that can help with cancer treatments. Hutt noted that a patient who had undergone treatment was recently given funding to cover the cost of a lymphedema sleeve to reduce swelling in her arm, giving her regained use of the arm.\nHutt said patients and families are pleasantly shocked when she tells them the Hand-to-Hand to Help fund can help with expenses.\n“We tell patients about the travel program through the provincial government, which is accessible to families with an income of under $35,000. However, many families are over that amount but still benefit from financial help. When we can give them a $300 gas card, for instance, it makes a big impact.”\n“We’re very blessed because we do have such community support,” said Hutt. “It’s really nice to see community coming together to help support those who are going through a rough time.”\nCongratulations to the EKM Health Foundation on reaching a major fundraising milestone; since 1997, the Foundation has provided $4-million in support to health-related charitable organizations and initiatives in the communities of Eastern Kings County.\nNova Scotia Health thanks the EKM Health Foundation for their generous donations to support programs within our facilities, as well as the countless donations they’ve made to community groups helping to enable healthy people, healthy communities, for generations.",

Initially critical of the measure, Lula approved the tax after requests from Brazilian retailers facing unfair competition, especially from Chinese e-commerce. The tax is part of the Green Mobility and Innovation program. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 28-06-2024 02:27 IST | Created: 28-06-2024 02:27 IST Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday signed into law a 20% tax on international purchases of up to $50, despite having previously criticized the measure. Lula signed the bill into law during a meeting of his Council for Sustainable Economic and Social Development in Brasilia. The tax on online international low cost purchases was a request from Brazilian retailers who argue that they are being victims of unfair competition, mainly against Chinese e-commerce giants. In May, Lula had said he was willing to negotiate with lawmakers about taxing cross-border low cost purchases of up to 50 dollars, but he did not rule out the possibility of vetoing the measure. At the time, the president pointed out that the measure could impact people with lower income. The highly controversial tax was attached to a bill that creates the so-called Green Mobility and Innovation program (Mover).
