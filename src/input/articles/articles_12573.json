    "text": "Police: Surveillance video sharing program helps catch porch pirate CARBONDALE, Ill. (KFVS) - Carbondale Police are crediting the Neighbors app in catching a porch pirate. Police say they were alerted by the Ring Neighbors app that a package theft took place in the area of a of Washington and Hester Streets on Thursday, December 28. Pictures taken of the area were sent to Carbondale Police officers and detectives. Police said patrol officers found the suspect wearing the same clothing in the pictures and recovered the stolen items, which were returned to the victim. There is no word on any charges, but a Carbondale Police shared a photo of the alleged crime. The photo shows a person walking away from the camera holding what appears to be a box under one arm and a bag in the other hand. Police said the Neighbors app has proven to be a very effective tool. They believe the neighborhood surveillance sharing app creates a sense of community and increases the chances for a successful criminal investigation. Police remind subscribers to the app that they are not required to notify or communicate with police and that police do not have access to their cameras, address or information.

Roberts said after the game that his concern was \"sort of high.\"\n\"Any time he comes out of the game -- which he doesn't, his pain tolerance is very high -- that's certainly telling,\" Roberts said.\nTaylor is batting .167 with three home runs and 15 RBIs in 162 at-bats. An All-Star selection in 2021, he is a career .249 hitter with 107 homers and 423 RBIs in parts of 11 seasons with the Seattle Mariners (2014-16) and Dodgers (2016-present).\nOutman, 27, will be starting his third stint with the Dodgers this season. He is batting .153 (19-for-124) with three homers and 10 RBIs in 45 games. The third-place vote-getter for the National League Rookie of the Year in 2023, Outman is a career .234 hitter with 27 homers and 83 RBIs in 200 games since making his major league debut in 2022.\n--Field Level Media\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0",

    "title": "Adiós a las buenas noticias para los móviles Samsung y One UI 7: la actualización podría ser un desastre",
    "text": "Hace unos días te contábamos que la actualización de One UI 7 y Android 15 se adelantaba , lo que suponía una gran noticia para todos. A pesar de que tu móvil no pueda acceder a la beta, sigue siendo algo positivo, pues significa que todo el proceso va a correr más deprisa. Pues bien, hoy las alegrías se convierten en incertidumbre. La última publicación de Ice Universe , un conocido filtrador muy relacionado con Samsung, ha comentado que la versión beta podría ser un desastre .\nSegún él, la beta de One UI 7 está plagada de fallos y errores que difícilmente Samsung podrá subsanar antes de lanzarla. ¿Cuánto margen tiene la compañía? Si hacemos caso a la última información filtrada, poco. Como bien contó hace unos días la misma fuente, la versión de pruebas debería lanzarse el día 17 de noviembre . Es decir, dentro de unas 48 horas.\n\" Es posible que la versión beta de One UI 7 no se inicie sin problemas y que haya demasiados errores. \", se lee en la publicación. Para finalizar, comenta lo siguiente: \"E s muy difícil que puedan subsanar todos los defectos anteriores en medio año. \"\n¿A qué se refiere con esto último? Pues que Samsung tiene complicado utilizar la fase beta para solucionar los errores actuales , y que podría tardar más de lo previsto en dejar todo como debería. Y, si esto es cierto, no es de extrañar que más pronto que tarde se anuncien nuevos retrasos en todo el proceso.\nSamsung contra las cuerdas: o una beta llena de fallos o una actualización tardía Es difícil avecinar los pasos de Samsung en estos momentos, sobre todo basándonos en información no oficial. Pero, si tomamos estos rumores y filtraciones como ciertos, es probable que la beta de One UI 7 no sea tan popular como se esperaba . Nadie quiere un software lleno de fallos, por lo que su adopción podría ser menor , lo que se podría traducir en una cantidad de reportes más pequeña y un tiempo de desarrollo más elevado.\nEn resumen, que Samsung, si es cierto que One UI 7 tiene fallos a raudales, podría tardar más de lo normal en lanzar una versión estable de su capa de personalización . Ahora bien, es necesario esperar a que la compañía hable, publique la versión de pruebas y los propios usuarios podamos comprobar cómo de bien o mal está el nuevo software.\nPor ahora toca esperar pacientemente, pues aunque la beta de One UI 7 se haga pública el día 17 de noviembre, todo apunta a que los primeros países en poder instalarla serán Estados Unidos y Corea del Sur. Europa, por el contrario, tendría que esperar a una segunda oleada un poco más tardía.",

    "title": "'Really scary': Families brace for impact of transgender youth care ban in Ohio - ABC7 New York",
    "text": "Astrid Burkle, a 10-year-old transgender girl who lives in Ohio, said she wishes she \"could have a normal life.\" Her desire for normalcy -- a life of baking cookies with her grandmother, singing with her friends in the local choir, and going on field trips -- is shrouded by impending anti-transgender legislation passed by the statehouse. \"It's been really frustrating at times,\" Astrid told ABC News in an interview alongside her family. \"Because there's just so many people out there who are just really mean.\" Families across the state are bracing for the impact of a bill that would restrict certain transgender rights for minors. Ohio House Bill 68 is comprised of two acts: the \"Save Adolescents from Experimentation Act,\" which would ban transgender minors from receiving gender-affirming care, and the \"Save Women's Sports Act,\" which would prevent transgender girls from taking part in girls' and women's sports. An exception in this bill allows hormone-based care and surgery for intersex and cisgender youth. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine has yet to announce whether he will sign or veto the legislation - but more than three-fifths of legislators have voted in favor of the bill so far and can override his veto. Astrid's mother, Alicia Burkle said Astrid has been receiving strictly mental health care services in recent years. Therapy, Astrid said, offers a \"safe space\" to talk through her experiences. However, the restrictions placed on Astrid's future choices for care have the family questioning their options. \"Just because you've said that you're not going to allow us to get the care here in Ohio doesn't mean we're suddenly going to stop getting the care for our kids,\" said Alicia Burkle. She continued, \"We trust the science, we trust her healthcare providers. And so we're going to do what we have to do and whether that is travel out of state to get it, whether it's leave the state and move -- that's what we'll do.\" Burkle said her cisgender daughter is on hormone replacement therapy -- \"But nobody's questioning that ... So I don't understand.\" Supporters of gender-affirming care restrictions believe that gender transitioning is harmful to youth. Some say patients should wait until they are older to make this kind of health decision. State Sen. Terry Johnson, who is a retired physician, argued in favor of the bill on the Senate floor. \"If you don't know if something you're doing is going to hurt someone 10, 15, 20 years down the road -- or maybe even one year down the road -- don't do it,\" Johnson said in a Dec. 13 debate. \"The medical evidence is not there to support what we're doing in the country.\" Critics of these laws say they prevent families and physicians from making decisions about their health care and will harm transgender youth. State Sen. Paula Hicks-Hudson argued against the bill in the Dec. 13 debate. \"When we look at this legislation, let's be clear, it is not necessarily about preventing children from being exposed to these types of procedures, but it is preventing parents who are making decisions about the health care of their children,\" she said. \"It also removes that decision for health care from professionals and parents and gives it again to government.\" Gender-affirming care has been called safe, effective, and medically necessary by more than 20 major national medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association. Dr. Christopher Bolling, a member of the Ohio Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told ABC News in an interview that pediatricians and physicians are \"extremely cautious\" when it comes to gender-affirming care and often have many long conversations with people who are questioning their gender. This gives patients time to explore their identity and create an individualized approach to care. For youth approaching puberty, puberty blockers are a reversible form of gender-affirming care that allows children to pause puberty and explore their gender identity without the growth of permanent sex characteristics, according to physicians interviewed by ABC News . This option would be banned by the legislation. Often because of gender-related discrimination and gender dysphoria, transgender youth are more likely to experience anxiety, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation and attempts, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Research shows that hormone therapy can improve the mental health of transgender adolescents and teenagers, a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine found. The legislation has a grandfather clause that allows minors who are already on medication to continue to receive care. It's a benefit for some families in the state, including Nick Zingarelli, his wife and his teenage daughter who is already taking puberty blockers. Zingarelli raised his daughter in Cincinnati, Ohio -- but the family moved to Missouri in 2019 to be closer to his wife's family. His daughter came out as transgender in 2020 when she was still a preteen. He told ABC News that his daughter's coming out changed both everything and nothing about their family. \"Obviously it changed everything in terms of having to advocate for her rights,\" said Zingarelli in an interview. \"Missouri is a deep red state.\" He continued, \"And when I say that nothing at all changed -- when we told friends, family, school, everybody, it was like, 'Okay, great. So these are her new pronouns. This is her name.'\" Zingarelli said he met with doctors at the time who said there was nothing they could do for his daughter at her age except for counseling. \"So this belief that doctors are just running to get prescriptions filled and everything else as soon as gender dysphoria is disclosed is nonsense,\" said Zingarelli. Zingarelli and his family later moved back to Ohio in part to escape anti-transgender legislation in Missouri that restricted trans participation in sports and gender-affirming care. They did not expect to be faced with restrictive legislation in Ohio, the place they call home, he said. For Zingarelli, the grandfather clause protecting his daughter's care is \"not good enough,\" since it doesn't protect care in the future for children like Astrid who are not yet old enough to receive medical care. The community has been supportive of Astrid and her family, according to Astrid's father, Aaron. \"We want to be able to support our communities and the state of Ohio, but like, people are going to leave,\" said Abs Burkle, Astrid's sister. \"People are going to be hurt. They're not going to want to come back to Ohio.\" If you or a loved one is struggling with a mental health crisis or considering suicide, call or text 988.",

    "title": "Former NHL Player Drops Brutal Take on Sharks Play: 'Primitive Hockey'",
    "text": "By Antonio Losada ,\n1 hour ago Alexander Barabanov, who recently parted ways with the San Jose Sharks to move to his native country of Russia, did not hold back in his assessment of the team's playing style after cutting links with the NHL franchise.\nAfter hitting free agency and signing with Ak Bars Kazan in Russia’s Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), the former Sharks forward shared some harsh criticism regarding his time in San Jose.\nIn an interview with RG.org published on August 28 , Barabanov called out the Sharks for playing what he described as \"primitive hockey.\"\nBarabanov elaborated on his frustrations, dropping fire take after fire take.\n\"I got much pleasure from the hockey processes, from the whole league, but in the last year, I suffered from injuries, and the team played primitive hockey,\" Barabanov said. \"You run around without the puck and don't understand why you need all this. We didn't even try to keep the puck, play for your partner. It was the most simple hockey that kills the player in you.\"\nBarabanov’s comments come after a dismal season for the Sharks, who finished dead last in the NHL with a record of 19–54-9. This marked the fourth-worst winning percentage in the franchise's history and the second-lowest since the NHL implemented a salary cap after the 2004-05 lockout. Despite these struggles, the Sharks secured the first overall pick in the NHL Draft Lottery, selecting Macklin Celebrini.\n\"After all, this helped them get [Macklin] Celebrini,\" Barabanov said. \"I hope that the team will finish a rebuild. They have many good young players with great future.\"\nThe 29-year-old forward also had a challenging season last year, his last in the NHL, managing just 4 goals and 13 points in 48 games.\nRelated: Blue Jackets GM Blast Columbus 'Acceptable Losing' Culture\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

La Police nationale a rapporté que les CRS montagne et la sécurité civile étaient intervenues pour évacuer une centaine de personnes. Mais deux habitants manquaient à l’appel, avant d’être localisés dans une maison menacée par les flots.\nLes images de l’intervention du policier Damien Fillon au milieu de l’apocalypse, notamment partagées par le journaliste militant écologiste Hugo Clément, sont devenues virales sur les réseaux sociaux. «Malgré des conditions périlleuses, il a réussi à les sauver juste avant que la maison ne soit engloutie», a déclaré la police française.\nLe CRS a été hélitreuillé sur le toit de la bâtisse, qu’il est ensuite parvenu à ouvrir pour extraire les deux personnes prises au piège. «Toute la maison tremblait et je me suis rendu compte que la rivière s’engouffrait. J’ai réussi à casser le toit à coups de massette», a relaté le sauveteur à BFM TV.\nLe policier (CRS Alpes) qu’on voit sur cette vidéo s’appelle Damien Fillon. C’est mon ami.— Hugo Clément (@hugoclement)\nIl a été hélitreuillé sur le toit de cette maison engloutie par la rivière, hier à La Bérarde, hameau d’Isère totalement dévasté par une crue éclair.\nIl a enfoncé une partie du toit…\n[pic.twitter.com/mkDm47Dthk] [June 22, 2024]\nLa maison était alors déjà ensevelie à 95% : «Je mets la tête à travers le toit, je tombe nez à nez sur deux personnes accrochées aux poutres du plafond qui me disent : \"On est là, on est là\"», a-t-il poursuivi.\nEt Damien Fillon d’ajouter : «J’ai réussi à les harnacher, ils ont plus ou moins sauté dans le vide. Ensuite, j’ai réussi à les tracter hors de ce piège et les évacuer sur les berges grâce à l’hélicoptère».\nL’apocalypse ⬇️— Hugo Clément (@hugoclement)\n[pic.twitter.com/ii4bntOwVE] [June 22, 2024]\n«On a entendu les bruits d’hélicoptère, un type est descendu sur le toit, on a entendu des pas, on a dit : \"Oui, on est là, on est à deux\"», a raconté au 20h de TF1 l’un des deux rescapés, un touriste belge.\n😱 Au lendemain des violentes intempéries qui ont notamment touché l’— Guillaume Woznica (@GWoznica)\n[#Isère], les images du hameau de [#LaBérarde]font froid dans le dos… Elles témoignent de la violence de l’eau qui a quasiment tout détruit : la plupart des bâtiments sont éventrés, effondrés ou ensevelis… C’est… [pic.twitter.com/jhSJfBJ2B8] [June 22, 2024]\nLes images au lendemain de la catastrophe témoignent de la violence des torrents de boue qui ont rasé la quasi-totalité du village.",
