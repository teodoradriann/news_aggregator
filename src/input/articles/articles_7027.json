    "text": "MDJ Script/ Top Stories for Dec 30th\nPublish Date: Dec 29th\nCommercial: Henssler :15\nFrom the Henssler Financial Studio, Welcome to the Marietta Daily Journal Podcast.\nToday is Saturday, December 30th and Happy 87th Birthday to HOF pitcher Sandy Koufax.\n***12.30.23 - BIRTHDAY - SANDY KOUFAX***\nI’m Keith Ippolito and here are the stories Cobb is talking about, presented by Credit Union of Georgia.\nAll of this and more is coming up on the Marietta Daily Journal Podcast, and if you are looking for community news, we encourage you to listen and subscribe!\nBREAK: CU of GA\nSTORY 1: Cobb Unemployment Drops Below 3%\nIn November, Cobb County's unemployment rate dropped to 2.8%, down from 3.1% in October but higher than 2.4% in November 2022. The county's labor force increased by 295, with 431,345 employed and 12,226 unemployed. The rise in unemployment is attributed to individuals re-entering the workforce post-COVID-19. Economist Roger Tutterow notes that the increased unemployment rate isn't concerning if job cuts aren't occurring, highlighting a significant increase in employed workers. Marietta's November unemployment rate was 2.7%, while Smyrna's remained at 3.2%. Cobb County's unemployment rate is lower than Atlanta's (3.1%) and Georgia's (3.4%), both below the national rate of 3.7%.\nSTORY 2: Kennesaw Council Newcomer Ready to Take on Wildman's Civil War Surplus\nMadelyn Orochena, newly elected to Kennesaw City Council, aims to close Wildman’s Civil War Surplus, a Confederate-themed store in the city's downtown. Orochena, who views the store as a hindrance to progress, plans to pursue legal action or code enforcement to shut it down. While previous blight complaints were dismissed, Orochena, an arts enthusiast, hopes to transform the downtown into a vibrant destination with a diverse range of shops. She initiated a mural installation near Wildman's, emphasizing her commitment to public art. Orochena also advocates for pedestrian safety, affordable housing, and the city's overall growth and improvement.\nSTORY 3: Cobb Civil War Round Table Examines Gen. Joseph E. Johnston\nHistorian Richard McMurry discussed Gen. Joseph E. Johnston at a meeting of the Civil War Round Table of Cobb County. McMurry's latest book, \"The Civil Wars of General Joseph E. Johnston,\" provides a critical analysis of Johnston's campaigns during the Civil War. Johnston, once considered a premier Confederate general, faced challenges defending Atlanta against Gen. William T. Sherman. McMurry's research debunked long-held myths about Johnston, revealing his strategic shortcomings and conflicts with fellow officers. The discussion delved into Johnston's Atlanta campaign, which ultimately resulted in Atlanta's fall to the Union Army led by Sherman.\nWe have opportunities for sponsors to get great engagement on these shows.

The Democratic majority, leveraging Georgia's home rule powers, replaced the state-approved commission district map with its own, challenging the legality of the move. Republican Commissioners JoAnn Birrell and Keli Gambrill abstained from voting, leading to their removal from the dais. The dispute centers on whether Georgia counties can independently draw district maps. A lawsuit, initiated by Gambrill and continued by Cobb residents Catherine and David Floam, challenges the county's map, seeking a declaration of its unconstitutionality and validation of the legislature's map. The court is expected to issue a ruling soon.\nSTORY 5: No. 3: Cobb School Board Map Thrown into Question by Lawsuit\nThe third-ranked local story of 2023 in Cobb County involves a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Cobb Board of Education's districts. The lawsuit alleged an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, leading to a federal judge's order for the General Assembly to draw new districts by January 10. The judge issued a preliminary injunction, preventing future elections using the current school board map. The school district, which spent over $1.3 million defending the map, appealed the injunction to the 11th Circuit of Appeals. The contentious issue revolves around accusations of packing and bleaching voters based on race, with the school board's Republican majority drawing the map after the 2020 census.\nWe’ll be back in a moment\nBreak: DRAKE – INGLES 6\nSTORY 6: Judge upholds new Georgia congressional, legislative maps\nU.S. District Judge Steve Jones ruled that federal judges lack the authority to redistribute political power between parties, upholding Georgia's new legislative and congressional maps. The maps were redrawn during a special session following lawsuits alleging Voting Rights Act violations. Jones ordered additional Black-majority districts, aiming for Democratic gains. Despite legislative leaders crafting maps to maintain Republican advantages, Jones ruled that partisan decisions alone don't violate the Voting Rights Act. He upheld the new maps, including the elimination of a coalition district, deeming it moot. Rep. Lucy McBath plans to run in the new Black-majority district, emphasizing the importance of voters' will.\nSTORY 7: No. 4: Books, Bans and 'Good and Evil'\nThe culture wars hit Cobb and Marietta school districts as book bans ignited tensions. Cobb Schools Superintendent Chris Ragsdale fired teacher Katie Rinderle for reading \"My Color is Purple\" to students. Despite protests, the Cobb Board of Education upheld Rinderle's termination, prompting an appeal to the Georgia Board of Education. In August, Ragsdale removed \"Flamer\" and \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\" for \"sexually explicit content.\" Marietta Superintendent Grant Rivera followed suit, sparking protests. Both superintendents faced criticism and support for their decisions amid a broader debate on book censorship and education.\nBreak: Henssler :60\nSignoff-\nThanks again for hanging out with us on today’s Marietta Daily Journal podcast.

    "title": "This Blumhouse horror, starring Michael Rooker & Kim Coates, has a horrible Rotten Tomatoes ranking",
    "text": "Walking Dead's Michael Rooker and Dead City's Kim Coates appeared in a 2020 Blumhouse horror that received generally negative reviews. Another interesting Walking Dead tie-in is that series composer Bear McCreary wrote the score for the movie. The movie isn't the best horror I've ever watched, but I don't think it deserves all the hate it receives.\nThe 2020 horror film Fantasy Island has an 8% ranking on Rotten Tomatoes and received mostly negative critical reviews. Directed by Jeff Wadlow, known for Kick-Ass, Truth or Dare, and Imaginary, the story is a horror reimaging and prequel to the 1977 same-titled TV series. Wadlow co-wrote the movie with Chris Roach and Jillian Jacobs. Produced by Columbia Pictures and Blumhouse Productions and distributed by Sony Pictures, the movie may not have done well, according to critics, but it was a box-office success.\nFantasy Island follows the stories of a select group of guests invited to a secluded luxurious island to live out their most elaborate fantasies. This is similar to the original series but the movie takes a turn when the fantasies transform into horrific living nightmares.\nThe critics gave horrible reviews to the film. While it isn't a cinematic masterpiece it is an entertaining movie that is heavy on drama, light on the horror but the interesting twists make it a decent movie. It is a fun take on the original series premise.\nRooker stars in the film as a private investigator named Damon. Michael Peña, Maggie Q, Lucy Hale, Austin Stowell, Jimmy O. Yang, Ryan Hansen, and Portia Doubleday also star in the leading roles. Coates appears in a supporting role; he portrays a character named Devil Face. Several others also appear in supporting roles, including Parisa Fitz-Henley, Mike Vogel, Even Evagora, Robbie Jones, Ian Roberts, and Charlotte McKinney.\nBlumhouse's Fantasy Island was nominated for several Gold Raspberry Awards, a satirical ceremony honoring cinematic failures. The film was nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Supporting Actress, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off, or Sequel.\nRooker is known for his role as Merle Dixon in The Walking Dead and as Yondu in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He has also starred in many other notable roles, including The Outlaws, Creature Commandos, Corrective Measures, and many more. He also stars in Kevin Costner's epic western, Horizon: An American Saga.\nCoates will begin his role as Bruegel in the second season of The Walking Dead: Dead City in Spring 2025. He is best known for his role as Tig in Sons of Anarchy and has appeared in White House Plumbers, The Get Back, Children Ruin Everything, and Double Down South. One of his newest roles was in the Netflix original American Primeval as Brigham Young of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nCheck out these stories and more on Undead Walking:\nFollow Undead Walking on Twitter (X) and Facebook and sign up for the once-daily Undead Walking newsletter to avoid missing out on everything in The Walking Dead universe",

    "text": "[Indigo](/index.php?members/indigo.761342/)\nProfessional\nDon't you have the same feeling? It's like everyone here lives in the good old past. I kind a feel that we all started watching careers of Federer and Nadal and now that Nadal retires it's slapping us in face that 20 years have passed. I am on this forum since 2006, whooping 18 years. People here nowadays talk so much about the past. We have new players but no one really cares. Young members choose to be somewhere else and not on a tennis forum. It's all about Fed, Rafa or Djokovic, a wheel chair one leg in a grave trio. And then there are so many references on a daily basis about tennis in 90s and 80s and so on. Youngsters can just scratch their head on this. Yeah, I watched Sampras and Agassi as a kid back in the first half of 90s. Good years I must say. I am old too what to do. So how do you guys feel, are we all going to be stuck in the past forever now that we have seen climax of tennis with the Big 3 or is there any chance that some youth will step in both in real life and in this virtual tennis oasis? Tell me about your old (or perhaps young) experience. Thanks.",

Directly inspired by designer Emeric Tchatchoua ’s teenage memories of Montreal winter, the snow-coated, surrealistically structured collection emulates the physical structure of a storm; however, on a deeper level, the collection's name stems from its underlying message encouraging viewers to prioritize the present moment.\n“This collection is a personal reflection on moments where time feels suspended, where the mundane transforms into the extraordinary,\" Tchatchoua noted in an official post-show press release.\nDesigned to appear as though \"caught in a fleeting instant,\" the captivating compilation of garments and accessories zooms in on one moment, extrapolating style codes that contrast with the outdoor landscape and instead leaning into oversized silhouettes and soft textures. Throughout Quiet Storm – which Tchatchoua chose to present down a snow-trodden runway – he throws snow on a bevy of silhouettes, acting as an accent detail on the shoulders of trenchcoats and more subtly stamped on all-white fur collaring.\nWhite also dominates a significant portion of Quiet Storm's color palette, elevated with hits of red and blue. Standout sleek all-white garments include a quilted puffer jacket – which arrives alongside a pair of pants and gloves – among a lineup of pillow-esque pullovers and zip-ups. Collars are\nContributions come from external collaborators including seasoned partner Mitchell & Ness x NBA , Dumas Paris – on a lineup of pillows and duvets – and, a key nostalgic source of inspiration for Tchatchoua, Bruce Lee . Basketball-inspired pieces span a tailored two-toned cropped jacket in blue, a clean navy blue cardigan simply stamped with a patch on the chest and, possibly the hero piece, a suit decorated with NBA patches throughout the top half of its torso.\nThese collaborations capture different dimensions of this narrative—comfort and introspection, energy and presence, and the timeless resonance of iconic moments. Together, they deepen the story of a life lived fully in the moment,\" Tchatchoua continued.\nSift through the 3.PARADIS Fall/Winter 2025 collection in the runway images above and stay tuned to Hypebeast for continuing Paris Fashion Week coverage.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",

Bajo el lema “ ‘Cuenta conmigo”, estamos y estaremos, juntos, frente a las enfermedades hepáticas’ , la compañía ha impulsado diversas actividades para seguir avanzando en la eliminación de la hepatitis C ( VHC ), la mejora del diagnóstico y tratamiento de la hepatitis Delta ( VHD ) y los desafíos en el abordaje de la colangitis biliar primaria ( CBP ).\nDurante el congreso, además, ha tenido lugar la entrega de la 7ª Convocatoria de ‘Becas Gilead a Proyectos de Microeliminación en Hepatitis C y diagnóstico y vinculación al SNS en pacientes con Hepatitis D’ . Un programa que, en esta ocasión, permitirá a investigadores de Cataluña, Islas Canarias, Galicia, La Rioja, Navarra, Comunidad Valenciana, Comunidad de Madrid y Andalucía impulsar proyectos centrados en la mejora del diagnóstico, el tratamiento y el conocimiento de las hepatitis virales , con impacto positivo en los pacientes, la comunidad científica y la sociedad.\n“En Gilead, llevamos más de 20 años comprometidos con los pacientes con enfermedades hepáticas, apoyando proyectos de investigación e iniciativas que optimicen el diagnóstico, los circuitos de vinculación al sistema y el manejo clínico de estos pacientes. Nuestra colaboración con la AEEH ha sido constante y, a través del programa de becas Gilead-AEEH, hemos trabajado juntos durante siete años para fomentar el avance científico en este ámbito. Con la entrega de 15 nuevas becas, reafirmamos nuestro compromiso con la investigación, clave para seguir avanzando en el conocimiento y tratamiento de las hepatitis virales. Además, nuestra participación anual en el congreso de la AEEH refuerza nuestro compromiso con la actualización científica y el progreso en este campo, siempre en estrecha colaboración con profesionales sanitarios, sociedades científicas, instituciones y paciente”, explica Marisa Álvarez, directora médica de Gilead Sciences España & Portugal.\nPor su parte, Manuel Romero, presidente de la AEEH, ha recordado que “este 50º Congreso de la AEEH ha sido un espacio de encuentro y reflexión para seguir avanzando en la lucha contra las enfermedades hepáticas. Con el apoyo de aliados como Gilead Sciences, seguiremos trabajando para mejorar la vida de los pacientes, fomentar la investigación y promover la formación de los profesionales. Ejemplo de esta colaboración son las ‘Becas Gilead a Proyectos de Microeliminación en Hepatitis C y diagnóstico y vinculación al SNS en pacientes con Hepatitis D’, un motor clave para la innovación en hepatología. Gracias a este programa, que celebra su séptima convocatoria, continuamos avanzando, porque solo unidos podremos hacer frente a los desafíos que aún persisten en el ámbito de las hepatitis virales”. El congreso ha servido como escenario para abordar, de la mano de Gilead, grandes retos en enfermedades hepáticas en diferentes actividades .\n‘Cuenta conmigo’: juntos frente a la hepatitis C y Delta La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) ha fijado el objetivo de eliminar las hepatitis virales como amenaza para la salud pública para 2030. En los últimos 10 años, más de 165.000 pacientes han sido tratados en España contra la hepatitis C, lo que posiciona al país como uno de los más avanzados en la lucha por su eliminación.\nSin embargo, aún queda trabajo por hacer, ya que el 30% de los pacientes tratados presentan una enfermedad hepática avanzada (fibrosis F3/F4) , lo que subraya la necesidad de continuar con estrategias de cribado, como la liderada por Gloria Sánchez, del Hospital Universitario Río Hortega de Valladolid , centrada en el cribado de pacientes con transaminasas elevadas.\nY así se ha contado en la conferencia organizada por Gilead durante el congreso “ Cuenta conmigo: juntos frente a la hepatitis C y Delta ” y en la que han intervenido Conrado Fernández, del Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón , Gloria Sánchez Antolín, del Hospital Universitario Río Hortega , y María Buti, del Hospital Universitario Vall d’Hebron .\nAdemás, la hepatitis crónica Delta (VHD) -la forma más agresiva de las hepatitis virales- progresa más rápidamente que la B, lo que hace crucial su detección temprana. Durante la conferencia organizada por Gilead, María Buti, del Hospital Universitario Vall d’Hebron , ha destacado que la implementación del diagnóstico en un solo paso ha demostrado aumentar la identificación de casos activos de hepatitis D y reducir complicaciones futuras .\nActualmente, el tratamiento de la hepatitis Delta ha logrado una respuesta combinada (respuesta virológica y normalización de las ALT) del 57% tras 144 semanas , con evidencia preliminar de que, en vida real, en pacientes con cirrosis puede reducir el riesgo de eventos hepáticos. No obstante, la interrupción del tratamiento se asocia con recaídas y elevación de enzimas hepáticas, lo que refuerza la necesidad de garantizar el acceso a terapias sostenidas.\nSimposio de Colangitis Biliar Primaria Durante el Congreso, Gilead ha organizado también un simposio bajo el título “ Nuevos Horizontes en la Colangitis Biliar Primaria ” en el que han intervenido José Luis Calleja, del Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro , María Carlota Londoño, del Hospital Clínic de Barcelona , Antonio Olveira, del Hospital Universitario La Paz , y Javier Ampuero, del Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocío .\nDurante este simposio, se ha abordado la necesidad de dar pasos en colangitis biliar primaria (CBP) . Una enfermedad hepática autoinmune crónica que provoca la inflamación y destrucción gradual de los pequeños conductos biliares intrahepáticos, lo que da lugar a una alteración del flujo biliar y a la acumulación de ácidos biliares tóxicos que causan daños en el hígado. Los síntomas más comunes e importantes de la CBP son la fatiga y el prurito y, con el tiempo, puede progresar a fibrosis, cirrosis y, finalmente, insuficiencia hepática.\nLos expertos han puesto de manifiesto que, aunque la CBP es poco frecuente, es la enfermedad hepática más común asociada a la colestasis crónica en adultos , afectando principalmente a las mujeres, con una proporción de 9:1 entre mujeres y hombres. La mayoría son diagnosticadas entre los 30 y los 65 años.\nLos signos y síntomas de la CBP suelen desarrollarse gradualmente, y el 50% de los individuos son diagnosticados inicialmente antes de que aparezcan los síntomas. En individuos asintomáticos, la CBP se identifica de forma incidental cuando se detectan anomalías en la bioquímica hepática durante la evaluación de otro problema. Actualmente nos encontramos en un panorama en constante evolución en cuanto al manejo y tratamiento de los pacientes con CBP. Este simposio ha sido una oportunidad para debatir los desafíos actuales en el manejo de estos pacientes, así como para ofrecer una actualización sobre nuevos enfoques y tratamientos .\nBecas Gilead -AEEH Como parte de su apoyo a la innovación científica, Gilead ha entregado durante el congreso la 7ª edición de las Becas Gilead-AEEH, reafirmando su compromiso con la investigación en hepatología. Esta convocatoria impulsa la realización de proyectos de microeliminación de Hepatitis C y de diagnóstico y vinculación al SNS de pacientes con Hepatitis Delta. Este año, tras evaluar las propuestas, se han concedido 15 becas con una dotación total de 390.000 euros (240.000 euros destinados a proyectos de VHC y 150.000 euros a proyectos de VHD), con un máximo de 30.000 euros por proyecto, que se desarrollarán en Cataluña, Islas Canarias, Galicia, La Rioja, Navarra, Comunidad Valenciana, Comunidad de Madrid y Andalucía.\nDesde su lanzamiento en 2018, las Becas Gilead-AEEH han financiado 76 proyectos en 12 comunidades autónomas , con ayudas que superan los 1,8 millones de euros. Unas iniciativas que han contribuido significativamente a la eliminación de la hepatitis C en España y a la mejora en el diagnóstico de la hepatitis D, abordando distintas poblaciones y entornos sanitarios.\nEn España se han tratado más de 167.000 pacientes con hepatitis C. Sin embargo, de las personas tratadas, más del 30% tenían enfermedad hepática avanzada. Además, según los datos de la segunda encuesta de seroprevalencia, se estimaba que entre la población general existían aproximadamente 76.500 personas virémicas, de las cuales un tercio estaban sin diagnosticar. Es por ello por lo que es clave aprovechar todas las oportunidades de diagnóstico para prevenir nuevas infecciones y tratar a los pacientes en fases tempranas de la enfermedad. Con estas iniciativas, Gilead reafirma su compromiso con la innovación, la colaboración con la comunidad científica y la mejora del acceso al diagnóstico y tratamiento de las enfermedades hepáticas en España.",
