New Delhi: Billionaire Gautam Adani's group will supply clean energy to power Google's cloud services and operations in India, the two firms said on Thursday. Adani group will supply 61.4 megawatt of electricity from a new solar-wind hybrid project located at its 30 gigawatt (GW) Khavda renewable energy park in Gujarat. Google powers most of its cloud operations and services through electricity procured from the grid and is planning to run the entire operations on clean energy by 2030. Adani is expected to start commercial operations in the third quarter of 2025. At the 'Google for India' event, the search giant also announced a partnership with CleanMax for sourcing 125.4 MW of clean energy to power its offices and cloud regions in India. Of the contracted volumes, 66 MW solar energy will come from Rajasthan and 59.4 MW wind energy from Karnataka. \"These projects are expected to start commercial operations in Q4 2025 and will deliver carbon-free energy to the grid where Google operates offices and cloud regions in India,\" Google said. While Google made the announcement at the 'Google for India' event here, the Adani Group gave details in a statement. \"Through this partnership Adani will supply clean energy from a new solar-wind hybrid project located in the world's largest renewable energy plant at Khavda, Gujarat. This new project is expected to start commercial operations in the third quarter of 2025,\" the Adani group statement said. This innovative collaboration will help advance Google's 24/7 carbon-free energy goal by ensuring cloud services and operations in India are supported by clean energy and thereby contribute to the sustainable growth of Google in India. Adani had previously announced plans to set up data centres run on clean energy. It had in October 2022 leased 4.64 lakh square feet of space at its data centre in Noida to Raiden Infotech, an entity of Google. © 2024 Hyderabad Media House Limited/The Hans India.

    "title": "Donald Trump: Biden's Migration Is 'Flat-Out Economic Warfare'",
    "text": "President Joe Biden’s mass migration policy is “flat-out economic warfare” against many Americans, former President Donald Trump will tell Arizona voters in a speech Thursday.\n“Biden wants an invasion — I want a deportation,” Trump will say, according to excerpts of the draft speech the Trump campaign provided to media outlets before Thursday’s speech in Phoenix, Arizona.\nWATCH — Migrant Surge in Arizona Crippling Border Patrol Resources:\nRandy Clark / Breitbart Texas “The Biden Invasion is no accident — it is a deliberate demolition of our sovereignty and our borders,” Trump is expected to say in the speech, which will include a broader focus on pocketbook damage to critical blocs of swing voters in the battleground state.\nThis year, Latino Americans will comprise more than a fifth of the electorate in Arizona, and many feel threatened by Biden’s policy of importing numerous foreign Latinos to compete for their jobs, housing, and education opportunities.\nTrump plans to say in his speech:\nThe Biden Border Invasion is also an all-out war on the working-class minorities of our country—and it is flat-out economic warfare on African American and Hispanic American families.\nThe illegal immigration is hurting Black and Hispanic Families more than anyone else. In less than 4 years, Joe Biden has imported millions of low-wage migrants and given them welfare, free healthcare, and work permits to undercut American wages. Now, real incomes for African Americans are down by almost 6% under Crooked Joe.\nSimultaneously, illegal immigration is causing rent and housing costs to skyrocket, because we have 15 million new migrants and no place to put them.\nIn everything he does, Joe Biden puts illegal aliens first, he puts the cartels first, he puts the Open Borders lunatics first—while he betrays American citizens. As your president, I will put African Americans First, Hispanic Americans First, and I will put all Americans First. My loyalty is to you, the American People.\nTrump is also expected to slam Biden’s toothless border “shutdown” plan:\nTwo days ago, Joe Biden signed an Executive Order to officially declare his formal approval and support for the largest border invasion in the history of the world. Far from closing the border, Joe Biden’s order is pro-invasion, pro-child trafficking, pro-women trafficking, pro-human trafficking, pro-drug dealers and all the death they bring, and pro-illegal immigration.\nBiden’s action this week establishes an annual minimum of approximately two million illegal alien border crossers every single year, not including the millions that will continue to pour through as got-aways.\nTwo million is a huge number — and is roughly equal to one migrant for every two American births.\n“The Biden Invasion is no accident — it is a deliberate demolition of our sovereignty and our borders,” says the draft speech.\nUpon taking office, Joe Biden stopped the completion of the Border Wall. He instituted “catch-and-release” across the entire southern border. He halted deportations. He knowingly ripped up Remain in Mexico. He willfully terminated my Safe Third Agreements. He rescinded Title 42. He threw open the gates to millions of fighting-aged males from all over the planet. And the very first bill Joe Biden sent to Congress was a plan to give mass amnesty to millions of illegal aliens.\nBiden adopted his easy-migration policies because his progressive deputies think borders are bad for “ equity. ”\nBiden’s business allies want more consumers, more renters, and wage-cutting workers , and his Democratic Party base wants more welfare clients and dependent voters .\n2024 Election Immigration Politics Donald Trump illegal immigration immigration Immigration and Housing Immigration and Wages Joe Biden",

    "title": "San Diego Port's Harbor Drive 2.0: A Collaborative Leap Towards Sustainable Mobility",
    "text": "In a landmark decision, the Port of San Diego Board of Port Commissioners has greenlit a pivotal cooperative agreement with Caltrans and the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG). This collaboration earmarks approximately $2.2 million towards the Harbor Drive 2.0 and Vesta Bridge projects. As we navigate towards a future where sustainability and efficiency intersect, these initiatives stand as beacons of progress. The Harbor Drive 2.0 project, in particular, promises to revolutionize mobility and access along the bustling Harbor Drive, slashing emissions and refining terminal operations. With an eye on reducing carbon footprints, the project is anticipated to cut down 5,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. This bold move not only aligns with the Port's Maritime Clean Air Strategy but also propels its Health Equity for All vision forward. With construction slated to commence by 2028 and reach completion by 2030, the horizon looks promising for San Diego's port district.\nThe Intersection of Innovation and Collaboration\nAt the heart of this ambitious endeavor is a commitment to innovation and collaboration. The partnership between the Port, Caltrans, and SANDAG exemplifies a shared vision for a more sustainable and accessible San Diego. The Harbor Drive 2.0 project, with its focus on improving mobility, reducing emissions, and enhancing terminal operations, serves as a testament to what can be achieved when entities unite for a common goal. The project is a critical component of the Port's broader Maritime Clean Air Strategy, which seeks to mitigate environmental impacts and champion public health through cleaner air. This cooperative spirit extends beyond the docks and into the broader community, signaling a new era of transportation and environmental stewardship.\nCharting a Course for the Future\nAs we look towards the horizon, the implications of the Harbor Drive 2.0 project extend far beyond the immediate benefits of reduced emissions and enhanced mobility. This initiative is a cornerstone of the Port's Health Equity for All vision, which aims to create a healthier, more equitable environment for all San Diegans. By significantly lowering carbon dioxide emissions, the project not only contributes to global efforts against climate change but also addresses local air quality concerns, directly benefiting the communities surrounding the port. The anticipated reduction of 5,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year is a significant milestone in the Port's journey towards sustainability and health equity. With construction on the horizon, the project is poised to set a new standard for port operations and community health.\nBuilding Bridges Beyond Boundaries\nMoving beyond the confines of the port, the spirit of collaboration and innovation finds resonance in the Four Corners area, where Orange, Osceola, Polk, and Lake counties converge. This region, known for its proximity to theme parks and vibrant communities, faces unique challenges at the intersection of county lines. From transportation woes to water issues, officials from each county regularly convene to synchronize efforts and address shared concerns. Notably, projects like County Road 532 and Westside Boulevard are underway to alleviate congestion and enhance safety, highlighting the importance of cross-county collaboration. Additionally, the establishment of a nonprofit dedicated to fostering cooperation among the four corners exemplifies a collective commitment to regional development and problem-solving.\nIn conclusion, the approval of funding for the Harbor Drive 2.0 and Vesta Bridge projects by the Port of San Diego Board of Port Commissioners marks a significant milestone in the pursuit of a more sustainable, accessible, and equitable future. With construction anticipated to begin within the next four years, these projects promise to transform the landscape of transportation and environmental stewardship in San Diego. Simultaneously, the collaborative efforts in the Four Corners area underscore the value of unity and shared vision in addressing regional challenges. Together, these endeavors illustrate a proactive approach to shaping a future that values sustainability, efficiency, and community well-being.",

    "text": "Andrés Julián Rendón.\nAndrés Julián Rendón, gobernador electo del departamento de Antioquia, aseguró que continuará con su idea de promover un referendo que permita a las regiones del país tener una autonomía fiscal para no depender siempre del Gobierno nacional.\nAunque Rendón ya había hablado de este tema hace un mes y socializó la idea en la Federación de Departamentos, la decisión del Gobierno Petro de asumir, después de 22 años, las funciones de autoridad minera en Antioquia, volvió a revivir el asunto.\nComo la decisión cayó como un baldado de agua fría porque esas tareas estaban a cargo de la Gobernación de Antioquia, Rendón publicó un video en sus redes sociales donde anuncia que junto con la bancada del Congreso de su departamento liderarán el referendo.\n“La decisión del Gobierno Petro nos devuelve a las épocas fastidiosas del centralismo y desconoce las capacidades como región. Nos ponen un freno de mano en el desarrollo local. Con mayor razón seguiré promoviendo ese referendo constitucional que les devuelva a las regiones la autonomía, sobre todo fiscal”, dijo.\nPor esa razón desde enero de 2024 se trabajará en dicha iniciativa para impulsarla y buscar un apoyo mayoritario. Diferentes gobernadores electos están de acuerdo en que hay que acabar el centralismo, por lo que seguramente apoyarán la propuesta de Rendón.\nSobre la decisión del Gobierno Petro, la Agencia Nacional de Minería no prorrogó las actividades de control que asumió desde 2001 el departamento, relacionadas con la tramitación y celebración de contratos de concesión, también con las labores de fiscalización, seguimiento y control de esta actividad económica. Desde 2024, esta entidad será la titular del caso.",

    "title": "Alberta Premier Smith's blame on health agency chilling: emergency doctor",
    "text": "EDMONTON – The former head of the Alberta Medical Association says Premier Danielle Smith’s latest finger pointing at the province’s front-line health agency has created a “draconian” chill among workers.\nDr. Paul Parks, an emergency physician, says he’s heard from scores of health workers across Alberta who felt intimidated by the premier’s harsh critique this week of Alberta Health Services.\n“From front-line physicians, nurses, health-care workers, up to senior leadership — everybody heard the premier of the province saying that they suck, that they don’t do a good job and that they’re not valuable,” he said Thursday.\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith provides an update on what steps the government is taking related to allegations by former Alberta Health Services CEO Athana Mentzelopoulos, in Calgary, Wednesday, Feb. 19, 2025.THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh Some have even felt too intimidated to engage with his social media posts for fear of losing their jobs, he said.\n“We’re going to find ourselves in a situation in Alberta where there’s nobody willing to speak out and to actually try to advocate for patients in the system, because it’s that draconian.”\nSmith has denied any wrongdoing in response to allegations of government interference in lucrative medical contracts.\nAt a news conference Wednesday, she accused AHS leadership of stymieing the government’s mission to expand publicly funded, private surgical delivery. She also said AHS’s internal contracting processes are too opaque.\nIn a lawsuit filed last week, the former head of AHS, Athana Mentzelopoulos, alleged she was fired for looking into questionable contracts pushed by government officials as high up as the premier’s office.\nThe suit alleges government officials pressured her to sign off on contracts with surgical facilities at unjustified, inflated prices, potentially leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in profit for private clinic owners.\nSmith said she and Health Minister Adriana LaGrange weren’t involved in awarding the contracts at the centre of allegations, and the premier accused AHS leadership of stalling.\nThe government is in the middle of massive restructuring that would see four new governing health agencies in place of AHS, with AHS reduced to a service provider.\nSmith said AHS would rather keep all surgeries in its hospitals, “either because of ideology, or to protect their interests.”\nAlthough Smith and LaGrange didn’t name Mentzelopoulos on Wednesday, Mount Royal University political scientist Duane Bratt said the implication was clear.\n“They implied that she was let go because she was dragging her feet on a government priority and wasn’t giving information to the health minister as requested,” he said.\nSam Blackett, the premier’s press secretary, declined to clarify who specifically in AHS management the premier was accusing of being resistant to change.\nBlackett told The Canadian Press late Thursday the premier’s comments the day before still stand, and pointed to her claim that “from the onset of our health plan to refocus health care, AHS leadership has always shown us resistance.”\nThe government plans for AHS to conduct an internal review, along with an investigation by an unnamed external third party.\nDan Scott, the lawyer for Mentzelopoulos, rejected the implication that she stood against chartered surgical facilities and was resisting expansion.\nIn an email, he said concerns Mentzelopoulos raised last year were about making sure there was proper due diligence before finalizing the contracts for two new chartered surgical facilities in Red Deer and Lethbridge.\nMentzelopoulos also alleges in the lawsuit that high-ranking staff in the Health Ministry, as well as Smith’s former chief of staff Marshall Smith, pressured her to fire AHS employees who were critical of the government.\nThe lawsuit alleges Marshall Smith called Mentzelopoulos multiple times last summer, demanding certain employees be fired because “’powerful people’ were upset and angry” over their social media activity.\nOne employee was political podcaster and paramedic Nate Pike, who is now facing a $6-million defamation lawsuit from one of the companies at the heart of the scandal, MHCare.\nThat company’s ill-fated $70-million contract to import children’s pain medication in 2022 resulted in delivery of 30 per cent of the order.\nMultiple United Conservative Party cabinet ministers have said they accepted luxury box suite tickets to Edmonton Oilers playoff games last year courtesy of MHCare and its CEO, Sam Mraiche.\nThe Mentzelopoulos lawsuit alleges Marshall Smith told her if she didn’t fire Pike she would “look very bad” and face “consequences.”\n“This type of call from Smith was not unique,” the lawsuit says, adding Mentzelopoulos had also been pressured by a deputy minister to fire from AHS three “purported critics” of the government.\nThe lawsuit alleges the premier’s former chief of staff also called Mentzelopoulos about an anonymous X account, using the name Hansard the Cat, that had been critical of the government.\nThe lawsuit alleges Marshall Smith outlined steps to be taken to determine the identity of the person, such as hiring private detectives.\nMarshall Smith left the government last fall. Last week, he said the allegations were “outrageous and false” and that he’s eager to meet with investigators.\nMHCare’s lawyer has said any allegations of wrongdoing by the company are “unwarranted and unjustified.”\nParks said some health workers “have seen their colleagues fired and walked out the door” for engaging with social media commentary.\nHe added the government can’t investigate itself or get to the bottom of all the allegations, including worker intimidation.\n“No one body can do all that — unless it’s truly a judicial public inquiry — and nobody will have any faith in the outcome,” he said.\nThe premier has long railed against AHS, criticizing it for mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic and for being bloated with too much middle management.\nParks said AHS isn’t the same agency it was before the premier took office, replacing the board twice and the CEO three times.\nBratt said the premier’s attempt to reframe the narrative missed the mark by casting blame on AHS for getting in the way of health reform.\n“This isn’t about reforming. This is about political interference in health-care contracts,” he said.\nAlberta’s auditor general is also looking into contracting and procurement at both AHS and the health department.\nWhile Premier Smith has resisted calls for a judicial public inquiry, Bratt said eventually her government may not have a choice.\n“I just believe they’re delaying the inevitable.”\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 20, 2025.",
