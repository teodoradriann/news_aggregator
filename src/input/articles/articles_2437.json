    "text": "Birds and dolphins are early victims in Black Sea oil spill that’s contaminated 35 miles of coastline and threatens region’s ecosystem for years to come 11:41 pm, December 19, 2024 Source: Meduza\nAnapa City Administration A storm in the Kerch Strait that caused two tankers to shipwreck on December 15 has spilled oil across more than 50 kilometers (almost 35 miles) of Black Sea coastline in Russia’s Krasnodar region. On Thursday, Vladimir Putin revealed that the tankers lost nearly 40 percent of their fuel cargo — more than 3,000 metric tons (792,500 gallons) of oil. As a result, the Russian authorities have declared an emergency in the towns of Anapa, Veselovka, and Blagoveshchenskaya. Meduza reports on the cleanup effort and the extent of the pollution’s spread.\nAccording to user-generated markers posted on Yandex Maps, traces of oil have been discovered along a 54-kilometer stretch — from outside Anapa to the town of Bolshoy Utrish. Russia’s Federal Emergency Management Ministry reported on December 18 that cleanup efforts are underway along a 49-kilometer stretch of coastline in the Temryuksky and Anapsky districts. Regional authorities in Krasnodar noted that pollution spans 44 kilometers near Anapa. As of Thursday morning, December 19, Federal Emergency Management officials said they had surveyed 130 kilometers (80 miles) of coastline.\nEcologist Yevgeny Vitishko told Mediazona on Wednesday, December 18, that the oil products could reach the Bolshoy Utrish Reserve or move toward Taman via the Kerch Strait into bays that host protected bird habitats.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Ministry reported on Thursday morning that more than 5,000 rescuers and volunteers are involved in cleaning the beaches of Krasnodar Krai. According to regional authorities, some 5,500 people (including 4,000 volunteers) are helping with cleanup efforts in Anapa and the Temryuksky district. Anapa city administration officials say the cleanup operation also includes 300 military personnel and staff from more than 120 sanatoriums. Crews are removing the oil from beaches by shoveling it into garbage bags .\nRoad construction equipment has also been deployed for the cleanup. According to Federal Emergency Management officials, more than 860 tons of oil-contaminated soil had been collected in Krasnodar Krai by 1:20 p.m., Moscow time, on December 19. The Anapa city administration reported that the contaminated soil is being transported for disposal using 184 heavy vehicles, including dump trucks, loaders, and bulldozers.\nKrasnodar Krai Administration Ecologist Yevgeny Vitishko says the oil spill has harmed aquatic birds, including the great crested grebe ( Podiceps cristatus ), whose habitat stretches along the oil-polluted coastline.\nGrigory Prokopov, a research associate at the Center for Freshwater and Brackish-Water Hydrobiology, told the state media that other affected species in the disaster area include Eurasian coots, mallards, great cormorants, and many others that migrate here for the winter. He estimated that between 2,000 and 5,000 birds are in the danger zone. Vladimir Romanov, the director of the Russian Ornithological Society, says up to 10,000 birds — including swans, diving ducks, and sandpipers — may be in the affected area. He warned that pollution could kill half or more of these birds.\nOil films are particularly deadly for birds, as they cause feathers and down to stick together, explained biologist Vasily Klimov .\nA bird rescue center has been opened in the town of Vityazevo, outside Anapa. According to ecologist Yevgeny Vitishko, birds that reach the shore are exhausted and at risk of drowning. Volunteers are cleaning the oil from these animals, giving them absorbent agents, and then working with veterinarians to decide whether to release them or transport them to another location.\nThe oil spill is also causing dolphin fatalities . Dmitry Glazov, a research associate at the Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution, told the state media that the spill has affected a critical area for dolphins in the Black Sea. He noted that a similar spill in 2007 led to the deaths of many marine animals, including dolphins. “I believe that this large spill will impact the ecosystem for at least another 10 years, if not longer,” Glazov warned.\nKrasnodar Krai Operational Headquarters The Anapa region’s upcoming beach season may be disrupted, one ecologist told Agentstvo Media anonymously. “These types of oil products absorb into the sand and are very difficult to remove. The beaches might appear relatively clean, but the oil will start to vaporize when the sun heats up,” the expert explained.\nBackground\nTwo Russian tankers wreck in Kerch Strait storm, killing one sailor and risking ‘one of largest environmental disasters’ ever in Black Sea 6 days ago Background\nTwo Russian tankers wreck in Kerch Strait storm, killing one sailor and risking ‘one of largest environmental disasters’ ever in Black Sea 6 days ago\nSite Index meduza About Code of conduct Privacy notes Cookies Meduza in Russian Support Meduza Platforms Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Podcast The Naked Pravda Newsletters Monthly Daily\nUnderreported stories.

    "text": "‘It will kill them’: Sheriff warns new, more powerful fentanyl compound has made its way to Omaha\nOMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - An extremely lethal narcotic has hit the Omaha metro, and local law enforcement is seeing a disturbing trend that is bound to lead to deaths.\nFentanyl is already 50-times stronger than heroin and 100-times stronger than morphine. A lethal dose fits on the tip of a pencil. But local investigators say this new compound is even more powerful.\nWhen someone in Omaha would overdose on fentanyl, it would typically take one dose of NARCAN to block the effects of opiates on the brain and restore breathing.\nDouglas County Sheriff Aaron Hanson say it’s now taking two, sometimes even up to four or five doses of NARCAN to save a life.\n“Six months ago, we were seeing maybe one to two overdoses every week,” Hanson said. “Now, we’re seeing three or four a week. We didn’t think that we could get much more scared of the effects of fentanyl until we saw this new compound of fentanyl.”\nThe new compound in question comes after overdoses dropped nearly 40 percent after the creation of the Omaha Overdose Response Task Force more than two years ago.\nThe sheriff’s office recently uncovered evidence of fentanyl powder in one baggie, and next to it, a bottle of what appears to be Xanax — a popular prescription medication used to reduce anxiety.\nOnly these are fake Xanax pills.\n“As we speak, there’s a young man or woman getting ready to go to a club and they will ingest what they think is Adderall or Xanax, but in fact, it’s this new, more potent compound of fentanyl,” Hanson said. “And it will kill them.”\nA warning that bears repeating: Experts say 70 percent of pills that look like prescription medicine actually contain fentanyl.\nAnd life will get harder for first responders, too, because NARCAN cannot get cold, so officers can’t store it in their car during the winter. If it takes several more doses to save a life with this new compound, that creates a new set of problems that law enforcement will need to address.\nCopyright 2025 WOWT. All rights reserved.",

(Gray News) – A man discovered a goldmine of more than 600 valuable 1920s baseball cards while cleaning out his late father’s northern California home. [According to a news release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hundreds-of-rare-1920s-vintage-baseball-cards-and-babe-ruth-cards-discovered-in-california-closet-302015047.html), some of the rarest vintage baseball cards were found stored in an old tobacco tin inside a closet, including ones for Babe Ruth, “Shoeless” Joe Jackson, and Ty Cobb. Even the tobacco tin itself is from the early 1900s. The collection belonged to a man named Ed, whose last name was not given. The news release said Ed was a longtime card collector, starting when he was a kid during the early 1920s. Ed’s son said his father would often receive baseball cards from his uncles as gifts when he was a child. “Like many of those who grew up in the Depression, my father and members of his family did not discard anything,” Ed’s son said in a statement. “When I was young, elementary school age, I remember my father showing me the cards and the tin they were in.” Among the 600 cards in the tin were some of the most sought-after vintage baseball cards, including: - 1919-21 W514 “Shoeless” Joe Jackson - Nearly every player from the iconic 1919 ‘Black Sox’ team - 1921 E220 National Caramel Babe Ruth - 1922 American Caramel E121 Babe Ruth - 1919-21 Babe Ruth W514 - 1920 W519 Babe Ruth - Ty Cobb 1922 American Caramel E121 - 1921 W516 Ty Cobb - 1920 W519 George Sisler The century-old collection of rare baseball cards will be sold by [Auction Monthly](https://auctionmonthly.com/). Auction Monthly’s vice president said in a statement that he “couldn’t believe what was inside the old tobacco tin when I first opened the lid and noticed more than 600 pre-war baseball cards were all well preserved in the box.” The auction house did not give an estimate of what the collection is worth.

I will keep NATO strong. That's exactly what we did, and exactly what we'll continue to do,\" he told reporters during a tightly watched press conference.\n\"For those who thought NATO's time had passed, they got a rude awakening when Putin invaded Ukraine.

    "text": "Ahaan Panday's debut film, Saiyaara, has cemented its position as one of the biggest hits of the year, headlined by two newcomers. On Wednesday, the movie minted Rs 21 crore, taking the total to Rs 153.25 crore. Mohit Suri's musical Saiyaara saw a slight drop in its earnings on Wednesday, as per Sacnilk. The film registered higher footfall on Tuesday (July 22) than Monday, with many national chains offering discounted tickets. Saiyaara became one of the top five highest-grossing opening weekends of 2025 as the film earned Rs 83 crore within its first three days. The film crossed the Rs 100 crore mark on its fourth day of release. It's a feat that Salman Khan's Sikandar couldn't achieve this year. There's a buzz about the lead cast Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda as they were not part of any promotional events prior the release of the film. Taran Adarsh in his appreciation post for the film wrote, \"Tuesday's numbers are HIGHER than Monday's - and Monday was already HIGHER than Friday. \"What makes this feat even more commendable is that these numbers have come during a regular weekend and working weekdays... The discounted ticket pricing initiative on Tuesday certainly helped, but there's no denying that the film is in unstoppable mode.\" 'SAIYAARA' IS UNSTOPPABLE - UNSHAKEABLE... The DREAM RUN continues... #Saiyaara remains above the ₹ 20 cr mark for the fifth consecutive day – a milestone that even major films often struggle to achieve.\nTuesday's numbers are HIGHER than Monday's – and Monday was already HIGHER… pic.twitter.com/SM4qeiOaJ3 Produced by Yash Raj Films, the film deals with love, loss, and heartbreak in a poignant way. The film stars debutant Ahaan Pandey as Krish Kapoor, a struggling musician, alongside Aneet Padda as Vaani Batra, a young writer diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Mohit Suri's musical Saiyaara continues to script history at the box office as there's no sign of slowing down for the film. After five days of its release, the film crossed the Rs 150 crore mark and is eyeing Rs 200 crore next. Entertainment I Read Latest News on NDTV Entertainment.
