It has made life much worse.”\nMr Richardson said that poor governance had “run this country into the ground”, but that good governance could “turn it back around again.\nHe added that the solution to creating a fairer Bermuda was to fix the basics of good government.\nHe said: “That means creating an environment where investors want to come here, and cutting taxes and red tape to help local businesses thrive; delivering a world-class education for our children; investing in our roads and infrastructure to bring Bermuda back to where it should be, and reducing our crippling national debt.\n“Most importantly and the most basic of all, is governing with integrity and accountability — and being accountable to the people who put you in government.\n“If Premier Burt wants a fairer Bermuda, he needs to stop wasting time complaining about the ‘combined opposition’ and start fixing the problems that his government created.”\nRelated Stories Premier warns of ‘new Combined Opposition’ Parliament to reconvene early next month Commissiong mulls standing as an independent",

    "text": "En Mercado Libre es posible encontrar una amplia gama de bocinas portátiles para todo tipo de usuarios. Por ejemplo, si lo que buscas es una alternativa resistente que te de la mejor relación precio potencia, está la Xdobo Rainbow II. O bien, en el caso de que prefieras algo más práctico, este mini altavoz magnético BMLT Maglit puede ser la opción para ti por solo 286 pesos.\nBocina magnética BMLT Maglit\nSi hablamos de especificaciones técnicas, la bocina cuenta con 4W de potencia, mismos que se pueden complementar al utilizar su función TWS que nos permitirá vincular dos altavoces del mismo modelo. Además, promete una autonomía de entre tres a cinco horas dependiendo del volumen de uso y se conecta mediante Bluetooth 5 a nuestros dispositivos.\nAunque, el aspecto más destacable de este modelo es su posibilidad de acoplarse a un anillo magnético como el MagSafe que traen de fábrica los iPhone, o el que podemos encontrar en las fundas de varios teléfonos Android. Además, la Maglit viene retroiluminada con una anillo de luz LED ambar y tiene resistencia contra salpicaduras.\nTodo lo anterior, hace de este accesorio una variante ideal para aquellos que buscan elevar su experiencia de consumo de contenido de su smartphone o tablet. Aunque si tu prioridad está en la potencia de audio, puedes inclinar tu opción de compra por alguna de las otras opciones de la marca como la Xdobo X7 de 50W por 715 pesos.\nEn |",

In the Gospel of Matthew (18:21-22), Peter asked Jesus how often he should forgive someone who sins against him. Jesus replied, \"I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times,\" signifying that forgiveness should be limitless. His teaching emphasized that one should always forgive others, even if they continually make mistakes or cause harm. The parable of the Prodigal Son in Luke (15:11-32) illustrates this point where the father forgives his wayward son upon his repentance and return, emphasizing the unconditional nature of forgiveness.\nIn terms of\ntolerance\n, Jesus taught love and acceptance for all, even those who were shunned by society. In the story of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37), a man left for dead on the roadside is ignored by a priest and a Levite, but a Samaritan, a figure despised by the J ish people at the time, stops to help him. This parable taught that one's neighbor is not only those who are similar to oneself but everyone, including those who are different or even despised. It highlights the importance of compassion, tolerance, and empathy towards all beings.\nAs for\nhumility\n, Jesus himself was the embodiment of this virtue. He was born in a humble manger and lived a simple life. In Matthew (20:25-28), Jesus taught that \"whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant\". He also said, \"The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve.\" This served to emphasize that greatness comes from humbly serving others rather than seeking personal glory. Jesus' washing of his disciples' feet, as described in John (13:1-17), is a powerful symbol of humility. Despite being their master and teacher, Jesus assumed the role of a servant to teach the virtue of humility.\nAnonymous Coward (\nOP\n)\nUser ID: 82130981\nFrance\n05/20/2023 07:29 PM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: THIS IS WHAT DUMB FUCKS THINK- - -> \"I Will show GLP that I'm smart and cool too\" \"I will attack Jesus and God maybe the Bible\nLet no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.\nAnd grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.\nLet all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:\nAnd be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.\nEphesians 4:29-32\nQuoting:\nAnonymous Coward 7410837\n\"ONE ANOTHER\"\nas in other Christians.\nPaul is not talking about HEATHENS and SATANISTS..\nwe do not have to kisss HEATHENS, INFIDELS AND SATANISTS ass..\nAnonymous Coward\nUser ID: 7410837\nUnited States\n05/20/2023 07:32 PM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: THIS IS WHAT DUMB FUCKS THINK- - -> \"I Will show GLP that I'm smart and cool too\" \"I will attack Jesus and God maybe the Bible\nBut no man can tame the tongue.
