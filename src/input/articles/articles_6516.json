    "text": "Tunneleinsturz in Los Angeles: 31 Arbeiter gerettet\nAufatmen in Kalifornien: Nach dem Einsturz eines Tunnels im Großraum der US-Metropole Los Angeles hat die\nFeuerwehr alle Eingeschlossenen bergen können. 31 Menschen, wohl alle Tunnelarbeiter, seien am Mittwochabend (Ortszeit) lebend und ohne sichtbare Verletzungen gerettet worden, teilte die Feuerwehr mit. Der Unglücksort befindet etwa 30 Kilometer südlich des Zentrums von Los Angeles.\nErsten Berichten der Feuerwehr zufolge gelang es einigen Arbeitern nach dem Einsturz, über einen Berg loser Erde zu klettern. Auf der anderen Seite trafen sie demnach auf Kollegen. Anschließend seien die Eingeschlossenen mit einem Tunneltransportmittel zum Ausgang gebracht worden. Sanitäter versorgten daraufhin die Geretteten und untersuchten sie genauer, hieß es.\nEin großer Rettungseinsatz\nMehr als 100 Einsatzkräfte waren nach Angaben der Feuerwehr zum Unglücksort geeilt, darunter spezialisierte Rettungsteams. Der Einsturz passierte demnach mehr als acht Kilometer vom einzigen Tunneleingang entfernt. Es handele sich um einen im Bau befindlichen Tunnel für die kommunale Abwasserentsorgung, hieß es weiter. Die Ermittlungen zur Ursache des Einsturzes dauern an.\nEtwa eine Stunde waren die Arbeiter in dem Tunnel eingeschlossen, meldete CBS News. Der Tunnel sei insgesamt mehr als 11 Kilometer lang und etwas mehr als fünf Meter breit, schrieb der US-Sender unter Berufung auf den Betreiber.\nHinweis: Diese Meldung ist Teil eines automatisierten Angebots der nach strengen journalistischen Regeln arbeitenden Deutschen Presse-Agentur (dpa).

    "text": "LANSING, Mich. — This week has been filled with clear, dry conditions with frost and northern lights. This weekend, we will see the return of much needed rainfall to our neighborhoods. As a low pressure system tracks northeast towards the state of Michigan, we have a chance to see some light showers during the day today with a much better shot of rain this evening. A stationary front at the surface will kick off a more uniform area of showers this evening that could bring some rumbles of thunder and elevated rainfall rates. This will track at the Michigan/Indiana/Ohio border bringing more rain to our southern neighborhoods than to our northern neighborhoods. However, there is a renewed chance for showers throughout all of our neighborhoods on Sunday as the Low pressure tracks right across the state. This rain is much needed as we are abnormally dry throughout our neighborhoods according to the US Drought Monitor. As that low pressure tracks through, we will be left with dry conditions and northerly flow. This will advect in cooler temperatures to start our work week on Monday. We are tracking high temperatures in the lower 50's for Monday - Wednesday. Want to learn more about the Weather? Visit the [FOX47News Website](https://www.fox47news.com/weather).

    "text": "How to avoid losing crypto through scams like \"$SPX6900 Distribution\"\n Written by Tomas Meskauskas on\nWhat is the fake \"$SPX6900 Distribution\" site?\nOur analysis of the site (claim.spxv6900[.]com) has revealed that it is a scam website designed to mimic the real one, spx6900.com. Scammers use this deceptive web page to trick users into participating in a fake $SPX6900 token distribution. Their ultimate goal is to steal cryptocurrency from victims.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: We do not review crypto projects, please do your own research when investing money.\nFederal Trade Comission (FTC) states that since the start of 2021, more than 46,000 people have reported losing over $1 billion in crypto to scams – that's about one out of every four dollars reported lost, more than any other payment method.\nFake \"$SPX6900 Distribution\" website in detail\nSPX6900 is a meme token created for fun, with no connection to real stocks or financial markets. It has no value or financial return. The website (spx6900.com) is an unofficial fan page, not affiliated with any official organization. However, it is not meant to scam individuals, unlike the misleading site, claim.spxv6900[.]com.\nThe scam site claims to be distributing $500,000 worth of $SPX6900 tokens. It pressures users with a countdown and prompts them to connect their wallets to participate in the event. Connecting a wallet activates a cryptocurrency drainer. Scammers use this tool to transfer cryptocurrency from the victim's wallet to their own.\nOnce the transaction is made, it cannot be reversed, meaning the victim loses their funds permanently, as blockchain transactions are designed to be irreversible. This makes it impossible for the victim to recover the stolen assets. Overall, web pages like claim.spxv6900[.]com should not be trusted.\nUsers should always double-check websites or services before connecting their wallets to avoid monetary loss.\nName | Fake $SPX6900 Distribution website |\nThreat Type | Phishing, Scam, Social Engineering, Fraud |\nFake Claim | Participants will receive $SPX6900 tokens |\nDisguise | Legitimate token distribution held by spx6900.com |\nRelated Domain | claim.spxv6900[.]com |\nDetection Names (claim.spxv6900[.]com) | alphaMountain.ai (Suspicious), CyRadar (Suspicious), Fortinet (Spam), G-Data (Phishing), Seclookup (Malicious), Full List Of Detections (\n|\nTo eliminate possible malware infections, scan your computer with legitimate antivirus software.

These sites use tactics like countdowns and wallet connection prompts to trick users into taking actions that result in the loss of their crypto holdings.\nIt is important to be careful and avoid untrustworthy sites, especially when dealing with cryptocurrencies. In order to protect their assets, users are advised to verify the legitimacy of any platform before interacting with it.\nMore examples of similar scams (fake platforms) are \"[Ink Airdrop](/removal-guides/31880-ink-airdrop-scam)\", \"[$DOGE Airdrop](/removal-guides/31857-doge-airdrop-scam)\", and \"[Usual Airdrop](/removal-guides/31816-usual-airdrop-scam)\".\nHow did I open a scam website?\nFraudulent cryptocurrency platforms and other scam sites are often advertised through social media, using fake or hacked Facebook and Twitter/X accounts or hijacked WordPress sites. Online scams are also promoted through pages associated with rogue advertising networks (e.g., torrent sites and illegal movie streaming platforms).\nScammers also use [adware](/common-types-of-computer-infections#adware), phishing emails containing malicious links or attachments, misleading ads, pop-ups, or suspicious notifications from unreliable websites to trick users into opening scam websites.\nHow to avoid visiting scam pages?\nDo not allow questionable websites to send you notifications, and do not click pop-ups, links, ads, or buttons on shady sites. Avoid visiting web pages offering illegal services. Download apps and files from official websites or app stores. Do not use other channels, like P2P networks, third-party downloaders, dubious websites, unofficial app stores, etc.\nAvoid opening links or files in suspicious emails or unexpected messages received via social media. Keep your system and software up to date, and use trusted security software. Do not use questionable search engines.

Users land on their online lures after clicking on fake download buttons, using a torrent website, or simply clicking on an Internet search engine result.\nBased on users' location and device information, they are presented with a scam pop-up. Lures presented in such pop-ups range from get-rich-quick schemes to fake virus scans.\nHow to remove fake pop-ups?\nIn most cases, pop-up scams do not infect users' devices with malware.

    "text": "Agra: In the heart of India, close to Mathura’s cobbled lanes and bustling markets stands a sanctuary of hope and resilience, which gave a new lease of life to Raju the elephant.Today, Raju embodies the spirit of elephant conservation in India. At the Elephant Hospital near Mathura, Raju has become a global symbol of survival, inspiring change and transforming the landscape of elephant welfare in the country. Celebrating a decade of freedom, Raju, now a majestic 60-year-old, symbolises the journey from suffering to sanctuary. His story of exploitation sparked a revolution in how elephants are treated in India. Rescued in 2014, when nearly 70 elephants still endured the harsh realities of circus life, Raju's resilience paved the way for a brighter future. Today, elephants are no longer coerced into performing in circuses. Just a few years ago, the streets of Delhi echoed with the presence of elephants, rented out for weddings and processions. Fast forward to 2019, and these sights became a thing of the past, thanks to the profound impact of individuals like Raju. By 2019, the last of these elephants, Jasmine, was brought to Wildlife SOS, symbolising a significant shift in the capital's approach to these gentle giants. Raju's rescue shone a harsh light on the grim reality of tourist rides and the accompanying abuse. This revelation strengthened the Wildlife SOS campaign, 'Refuse To Ride', which continues to advocate against such cruelty. Kartick Satyanarayan, Co-founder and CEO of Wildlife SOS, recalled, \\\"The image of tears rolling down Raju’s eyes during his rescue a decade ago is still fresh in our memories. Jumping 10 years ahead, he is now no less than a family member, loved by all -- from staff members to caregivers, veterinarians, and visitors.\\\" Raju's story is not just about one elephant’s journey from pain to peace; it is a testament to the resilience of all elephants and the unyielding spirit of those who fight for their freedom.",

    "title": "Bangladesh: Worries in Delhi grow if Yunus demands extradition of Hasina",
    "text": "The delay in ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina seeking asylum or stay in destination to North America, the United Kingdom or Europe, has caused the elites in India’s South Block and Indian Prime Minister’s Office in New Delhi to bite their nails.\nWith every day passing, Delhi is getting jittery for the unwelcome VVIP guest, who arrived unnoticed on a special military flight from Dhaka to Hindon Air Base in Ghaziabad, near the Indian capital Delhi.\nOn August 5, Sheikh Hasina flew in a helicopter from the Prime Minister’s official residence Gonobhaban to Kurmitola Air Base. She departed on a Bangladesh Air Force C-130J transport aircraft (Flight No. AJAX 1431) and flew her to India.\nAfter a safe landing at 5:45 PM, Hasina’s transport plane landed at Hindon Airbase in Ghaziabad. Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval received her upon arrival and held an hour-long meeting high-level discussion. The agenda mostly centred around the current crisis in Bangladesh and her immediate plans.\nSheikh Hasina, the longest-serving woman prime minister in the world was elected to power for a fifth term only seven months ago in January. Her uninterrupted 15-year tenure as Bangladesh’s Prime Minister came to a dramatic end on August 5, when she fled the country amidst a mass street uprising of students and also joined by millions of people.\nThe unrest, which began with protests over job quotas on 1 July and escalated into calls for Hasina’s resignation, reached a tipping point with violent clashes in the first week of August.\nThe police and ‘Helmet Bahini’, armed vigilant gangs recruited from Awami League killed at least 400 people in the streets during the Red Revolution which lasted for the last six days of the student protests.\nHasina promoted her nephew General Waker-Uz-Zaman as the chief of the Bangladesh Army keeping in mind that she would protect her and her autocratic regime.\nThe military chief declared Hasina’s resignation in a national broadcast and stated that the military would establish a caretaker government to restore order. He also announced the formation of an interim government.\nHasina was the first leader and head of government who fled the country to avoid the wrath of the angry students and the public.\nThe following day, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar convened an all-party meeting to discuss the Bangladesh crisis. The meeting was attended by Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, Home Minister Amit Shah, Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi, and Mallikarjun Kharge.\nJaishankar said the government is in a “wait-and-watch” mode, but hands-on and in touch with the Bangladesh Army. He said Sheikh Hasina’s presence in India is a courtesy move to ensure she settles down, recovers, and feels comfortable enough to discuss her plans.\nHe also described that Hasina is in a state of shock and the government is giving her time to recover before it speaks to her over various issues, including her plans.\nJaishankar told the Indian parliament that Hasina has “requested at very short notice” to come to India following her forced resignation as Bangladesh Prime Minister.\nThe parliament was informed that an estimated 19,000 Indian nationals of which about 9,000 are students. The bulk of students returned in July.\nIndian foreign minister also referred to an address by Bangladesh Army chief General Waker-uz-Zaman – made last Monday, shortly after Hasina stepped down – in which he said, “I have met opposition leaders… we have decided to form an interim government…” and appealed for the violent protests to end.\nThe interim government headed by Nobel Laureate Dr Mohammad Yunus arrived in Dhaka in the afternoon (Thursday) and took the oath of office in the evening. He also announced a 15-member Adviser in his interim government.\nFor the restoration of democracy, a tentative date of election for the inventor of micro-credit will be announced. He also Earlier, in an exclusive interview with NDTV from Paris, where Yunus attended as a Special Guest at the Paris Olympics and had a minor operation a vile warning that “India’s north-east, Myanmar will be affected if Bangladesh becomes unstable.”\nYunus for the last 12 years faced several legal harassments and was even awarded six months imprisonment in a labour case.\nSeveral times, Hasina humiliated Yunus and even said he is a “bloodsucker” and profits from exorbitant loan interests from disadvantaged rural women.\nShe blamed Yunus for jeopardising the financial support of the World Bank for the construction of the mega project, the Padma Bridge. In a hate speech, at the inaugural event of Padma Bridge, said she wished to dip the Nobel laureate and ailing former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia into the yawning Padma River.\nHasina has nowhere to go in the next several weeks, she will stranded in a guest house on the outskirts of Delhi and India feel embarrassed to have her for long, which possibly dent the renewed bilateral relationship between two neighbours – Bangladesh and India of emerging new government under the rule of Prof Muhammad Yunus.\nSeveral political observers understand, that Yunus after holding the reign of Bangladesh, is likely to appeal to global leaders to urge India to deport Hasina to stand trial for crimes committed against the people during her 15 years of repressive rule.\nIf Delhi bigwigs do not concede to Yunus’s appeal to send back Hasina, not only bilateral relations and trade would be affected, but would also would spark an anti-India campaign resulting in a call for ‘Boycott India’ and would also more persecution against Hindus in Bangladesh, which will difficult for the interim government to neutralise.\nFirst published in The Northeast News, Guwahati, India on 8 August 2024",
