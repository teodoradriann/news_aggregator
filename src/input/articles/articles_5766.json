    "text": "3月28日消息，微博话题“佛山一公司要求员工每月加班10晚以上”冲上热搜榜，引发热议。\n据媒体报道，网曝佛山汇创塑料模具有限公司发通知称， 要求员工每月至少要加班10晚以上。\n根据网友晒出的通知单， 4月份起，每个员工每月要加班10晚以上，不足10晚的员工社保规定个人出的部分自己出，加班时间是18:30至21:30。\n对此，涉事公司公司回应称，这是自愿加班，你也可以不加班，但是如果你不加班，规定个人缴纳的社保自己缴，个人缴纳的社保大概400多元，如果你符合加班规定，自己缴纳的社保我们来缴纳，另外你也可以赚加班费，还能拿提成。\n在话题下，有网友表示“很离谱”。天眼查显示，佛山市汇创塑料模具有限公司成立于2016年，注册地址位于佛山市顺德区，法定代表人是梁庭轩，注册资本是50万元。其经营范围包括生产、加工、销售、维修模具、塑料及制品（不含废旧塑料）等等。\n【本文结束】如需转载请务必注明出处：快科技\n责任编辑：振亭",

    "text": "Alcohol can accelerate movement of food through stomach, leading to diarrhea But some alcohol can slow down food transit and cause constipation READ MORE: The drink that could end hangovers forever\nIt’s well known that drinking too much can lead to a headache, fatigue and an upset stomach, but why does knocking back one too many have you racing to the bathroom the next day?\nNow, an expert has revealed how alcohol wrecks havoc on your body and digestion.\nVincent Ho, an associate professor of gastroenterology at Western Sydney University, said alcohol messes with the way your body processes food, particularly how long it takes for food to travel through the gut.\nAlcohol can accelerate the movement of food through the stomach and intestines, causing diarrhea. It also reduces the absorption of nutrients and people who indulge in sugary alcoholic beverages are more likely to suffer in the bathroom the next day.\nBeverages such as beer and wine speed up food transit, but vodka and whisky slow it down, creating a sense of fullness or discomfort.\nThe above graph shows how long it takes the body to return to baseline following a weekend of drinking\nHowever, not all alcohol is created equal and some may actually have the opposite effect.\nBeverages such as beer and wine speed up food transit, but vodka and whisky slow it down, creating a sense of fullness or discomfort.\nA study in rats showed those exposed to high doses of alcohol experienced delays in food processing in the small bowel. This could suggest that people who engage in an episode of binge drinking – as opposed to repeated heavy drinking – may actually experience constipation more than diarrhea.\nIn a 2022 study, 500 people recorded their bowel movements and had their stools collected for analysis. Based on self-reporting surveys, researchers found people who reported a heavy drinking episode had harder, firmer bowel movements.\nResearchers believed the brief period of heavy drinking led to a delay in food being processed in the gut – and the longer food stays in the intestines, the more water is absorbed from the stool back into the body, leading to dry and hard poop.\nNot everyone experienced this, however. In people with pre existing digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome, binge drinking led to diarrhea, nausea and abdominal pain.\nAnd chronic alcohol use can even have longterm effects on your gut as it has been linked to lactose intolerance, overgrowth of small bowel bacteria and reduced nutrition absorption.\nIf you find yourself frequently experiencing digestive issues, the best thing you can do, Mr Ho said, is to limit alcohol intake and pay attention to what type of alcohol impacts you the most.\nIf you experience diarrhea after a night out, it can be helpful to avoid mixing alcohol with caffeinated drinks, which are known to cause bowel problems.\nIf constipation is the issue, staying hydrated is important. Mr Ho recommends drinking water even before you start drinking alcohol.\nAlso, drinking water in between alcoholic beverages and before you go to bed can also help avoid discomfort.\nEating protein and fiber-rich foods can be beneficial. Having food in your stomach before drinking helps cushion the effects alcohol has on the gut lining.\nMr Ho said changes in bowel movements after drinking alcohol are usually short-lived and harmless and resolve themselves in a few days.\nHowever, if symptoms persist beyond several days after drinking, it could be a sign of a digestive health condition.",

(askanews) - \"Lo dico non da vicepresidente del consiglio ma da genitore che sta studiando con i figli: mi ha raccapricciato una notizia che ho letto questa mattina che è arrivata da una scuola del Trevigiano dove, per rispetto a una famiglia musulmana, verranno esonerati dallo studio di Dante, della Divina Commedia: l'Inferno, il Purgatorio e il Paradiso, alcuni alunni; mi sembra demenziale. Adesso che nelle nostre scuole non si possa studiare Dante - poi, può piacere o no, io mi ricordo a memoria alcuni passi - perché offensivo, ecco, io penso che siamo o sull'orlo del baratro o ai limiti del ridicolo. Che venga espunto il Sommo Poeta dalle nostre classi per la pretesa di qualche famiglia che si ritiene offesa penso che sia un cedimento culturale, etico, morale ed educativo senza capo né coda\".\nCosì il vicepremier e ministro delle Infrastrutture e Trasporti, Matteo Salvini sul caso dei genitori di fede islamica di due studenti di una scuola media della provincia di Treviso che avrebbero chiesto e ottenuto che ai propri figli non venga insegnata \"La Divina commedia\" di Dante Alighieri, a loro dire \"offensiva\" per la religione musulmana.\n\"Su questo - ha precisato il ministro dell'Istruzione e del Merito, Giuseppe Valditara - abbiamo disposto un'ispezione per verificare come stanno effettivamente i fatti perché, oggettivamente, un'esclusione dal programma scolastico di uno dei pilastri della nostra letteratura e della nostra storia, per motivi religiosi, culturali o doglianze di qualche genitore, francamente non abbiamo ancora ben capito, è del tutto inammissibile\".",

    "title": "Saints initial Week 16 injury report: Alvin Kamara a DNP with 'significant' injury",
    "text": "By Jeff Nowak ,\n27 minutes ago\nThe New Orleans Saints look poised to be down yet another key player when they head to face the Green Bay Packers, and the absence could be extended.\nAlvin Kamara was absent from Thursday's Saints practice, the team's first of the week, with a groin issue that interim head coach Darren Rizzi said was more significant than initially thought.\n\"He’s gonna be week-to-week at the moment,\" Rizzi said. \"I’m gonna be honest, it doesn’t look great for this week. We’ll see what the next day brings.\"\nThe head coach had previously described the injury as a groin/adductor issue and one that Kamara noticed during the game but was likely worsened when he extended to haul in a touchdown pass from Cedrick Wilson in the third quarter. He remained in the game for a play on the next drive before heading into the blue injury tent, then back to the locker room for the remainder of the game.\nThe injury casts the final three games in serious doubt, a fact that's made more frustrating by Kamara sitting just 50 yards shy of the first 1,000-yard rushing season of his career. Rizzi won't be closing the door on his season any time soon.\n“There’s no one that wants him to get that more than me. At the same time we’re certainly gonna do the right thing by him, you know, I know it’s a goal that he wants to accomplish,\" Rizzi said. \"It’s a goal that I want him to accomplish but let’s … hopefully we get him back here towards the end and we can get him that goal.”\nKamara's absence would mean a bigger role for RBs Kendre Miller, Jamaal Williams and Jordan Mims. The Saints also signed former LSU star Clyde Edwards-Helaire to the practice squad, but he faces a quick turnaround to be ready for Monday.\nHere's how the Saints' full injury report broke down on Thursday:\nDNP = did not participate; LP = limited participation; FP = full participation\n- QB Derek Carr (left hand): DNP\n- RB Alvin Kamara (groin): DNP\n- WR Bub Means (ankle): DNP\n- WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling (chest): DNP\n- DE Chase Young (illness): DNP\n- TE Juwan Johnson (foot): LP\n- WR Chris Olave (head): LP\n- CB Kool-Aid McKinstry (shoulder): FP\nAlvin was one of five players who missed practice on the day. Two of those players were dealing with minor issues in Marquez Valdez-Scantling (chest) and Chase Young (illness). Both were held out as precautions and are expected back during the week of practice.\nThe biggest question will come in the form of Derek Carr, who is continuing to rehab but is yet to return to practice. Rizzi won't yet rule Carr out, but he did note on Thursday that it'd be Spencer Rattler starting if Carr is unable to play. Rizzi said that an injury guarantee is not expected to factor into the equation, as it has for several quarterbacks, including Carr, in previous stops.\n\"I certainly am not the salary cap guy or the contract guy, I’m a coach, but at the same time I understand that that plays into it and I understand that that’s happened in Derek’s past,\" Rizzi said. \"The fact that he wants to come back, the fact that he’s not on IR, I think kind of answers those questions, in my opinion answers those questions that that’s not an issue at the moment.\"\nThe biggest return of the day came in the form of Chris Olave, who was a limited participant in practice for the first time since being carted off the field during a loss to the Panthers in Week 9. He was cleared to return to football activity this week and his 21-day practice window has been officially opened. Rizzi wouldn't commit to Olave playing again this season, but said it would likely be left up to the player.\n\"I couldn’t be happier for him and more as a person than a football player. Really, really excited about him,\" Rizzi said. \"He was in a great mood today, all smiles, and for those that were out there probably saw him running around, that’s great.”\nThe Packers had a few DNPs. Here's how their half of the injury report broke down:\n- S Javon Bullard (ankle): DNP\n- LB Quay Walker (ankle): DNP\n- CB Corey Ballentine (knee): LP\n- TE Luke Musgrave (ankle): LP\n- CB Jaire Alexander (knee): FP\nThe Saints (5-9) visit the Packers (10-4) for a Monday Night Football showdown at Lambeau Field in Week 16. Catch all the action on WWL and Audacy.",

Le Conseil d’État a confirmé jeudi l’expulsion d’un imam de Toulouse prononcée en avril pour des propos haineux envers les juifs, selon une décision consultée par l’AFP. Le Conseil est allé dans le sens de la justice administrative, qui avait rejeté le recours en urgence déposé par Mohamed Tataïat. Cet imam de la Grande mosquée de Toulouse avait été condamné en 2022 à quatre mois d’emprisonnement avec sursis pour avoir tenu lesdits propos lors d’un prêche. Mohamed Tataïat avait été arrêté à son domicile le 19 avril, sur autorisation du juge des libertés et de la détention, [puis expulsé](/faits-divers-justice/2024/04/20/expulsion-vers-l-algerie-d-un-imam-condamne-pour-provocation-a-la-haine). Ses avocats avaient alors déposé un recours devant le juge des référés, dénonçant une expulsion expéditive et ne tenant pas compte de son comportement exemplaire depuis le prêche décrié, prononcé en 2017. Ce recours a toutefois été rejeté par le tribunal administratif de Paris, décision confirmée jeudi par le Conseil d’État. Vers un nouveau recours Arrivé en France en 1985, Mohamed Tataïat avait rejoint Toulouse deux ans plus tard pour exercer à la mosquée du quartier Empalot. Le ministre de l’Intérieur [Gérald Darmanin](/p/gerald-darmanin), qui avait signé l’arrêté d’expulsion, a pris note de la décision du Conseil d’État sur X (ex-Twitter), en se félicitant de la « fermeté » et de l’« efficacité de la loi immigration ». Vincent Brengarth, l’avocat de Mohamed Tataïat, a annoncé son intention de déposer un nouveau recours, sur le fond cette fois, et assuré que son client avait « poursuivi sans le moindre incident ses prêches depuis 2017 » et « qu’aucune menace à l’ordre public n’(avait) été démontrée par l’administration ». Dans son ordonnance fin avril, le tribunal estimait que les propos de Mohamed Tataïat « constituent une provocation explicite et délibérée à la discrimination, à la haine et à la violence contre un groupe de personnes - en l’espèce, les Juifs -, et revêtent une résonance et une gravité particulière depuis l’attaque du 7 octobre 2023 menée par le Hamas à l’encontre d’Israël ».",

    "text": "China's Snow Village Caught Using Fake Cotton Snow\nChengdu Snow Village, located in Sichuan Province, issued a public apology via social media.\nA \"snow village\"-themed tourist attraction in China was forced to temporarily close after visitors discovered that the \"snow\" used was not real but a mixture of cotton wool and soapy water.\nChengdu Snow Village, located in Sichuan Province, issued a public apology via social media.\nThe apology came after criticism from tourists who felt cheated after finding that the white expanse they expected to be covered in natural snow was actually artificial.\nThe management admitted they were forced to use fake snow due to the warmer-than-usual weather.\n\"The results we obtained did not meet our expectations and instead created a negative impression among tourists,\" said an official statement from the village.\nThey also regretted not being able to provide the snow scenes that visitors expected.\n\"We sincerely apologize for not being able to present real snow scenes and for forcing visitors to change their travel plans,\" the statement continued, as quoted by UPI.\nThe tourist attraction was temporarily closed as a result of this incident. Local officials are now examining other options to address the issue before deciding whether to reopen the destination.\nThis incident sparked discussion online. Many social media users questioned transparency in the operation of tourist destinations, especially regarding weather conditions that can affect the tourist experience.",

    "text": "All articles featured in The Beet are creative, satirical and/or entirely fictional pieces. They are fully intended as such and should not be taken seriously as news. Dear Diary, Today in my conservative WILL law course, I was told to do course evaluations. But, through a turn of bad clicks, my mouse landed on “SexWise Module.” I personally already completed my SexWise Module as a freshman, but my buddy next to me, Rom Romney, overlooked the page as it opened. His jaw dropped in shock as a glossary of sex terms appeared on the page. But in a mere accident, Romney clicked a link to a feminist ethical porn award site when he was examining the module for himself. Romney went too far. He soon saw people participating in fornication and intercourse. Romney was scared because he saw his old UW-La Crosse Chancellor Joe Gow and his wife Carmen on his screen on the porn website!! I myself was left in utter disarray! Why is Mr. Gow doing that! Why is this linked to the SexWise Module! “Oh!” Romney left out a huff and a sigh. He didn’t know what pleasure was until just now. Romney came from a nice God-fearing Catholic family in upper Michigan. He’s a sin of a baby and wasn’t supposed to be born but his nun mother is a sinner. His mother wanted to protect Romney from how babies are made so he wouldn’t repeat the mistakes she made. “Romney… I didn’t want you to find out this way. You are one of my best friends! I was gonna tell you about sex after you got married,” I muttered to him. SHAME on Jennifer Mknookin for exposing this innocent Christian child to the university’s woke DEI agenda!! HE WASN’T SUPPOSED TO KNOW. What’s next, he publicly indulges. Romney did not let out anything further. SexWise is nothing but a communist Marxist experiment of a module that hurts students by forcing them to be aware of sex. I will fix this in ASM.

    "text": "Vladimir Putin described 2024 as the \"year of the family\" (File) President Vladimir Putin praised the Russian army in his New Year's Eve address Sunday, calling for \"unity\" in a scaled-back speech that did not explicitly mention the conflict in Ukraine. In stark contrast to last year, when the Kremlin chief was flanked by soldiers in uniform, Putin described 2024 as the \"year of the family\" in front of the traditional backdrop of the Kremlin. \"We have repeatedly proved that we are able to solve the most difficult tasks and will never back down, because there is no force that can separate us,\" Putin said in the address, aired on state TV. \"To all those who are on duty, on the front line of the fight for truth and justice,\" Putin said, \"you are our heroes. Our hearts are with you. We are proud of you, we admire your courage.\" The televised New Year's Eve speech, which continues a tradition started by Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, is a holiday staple in Russia, watched in millions of households. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com It is aired just before midnight in each of Russia's 11 timezones, and is usually a summary of events of the past year as well as wishes for the year ahead.
